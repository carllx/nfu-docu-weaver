## 1 Downloading Premiere Pro
### 1. Where to get it (Explanation of Adobe Subscription)

This is Adobe Premiere Pro.
With it, you can create some absolutely amazing things.
But first, we need to get the program.
My name is Adam.
I've been using Adobe Premiere Pro for well over ten years, and I'm going to be your tutor throughout
this course.
I promise you, nothing will be too complicated.
And anything that is quite detailed, I will take my time and slowly and methodically explain it to
you.
So first things first.
Let's get the program.
If you head over to Google and search for Adobe, that's the company that makes Premiere Pro.
They also make a whole suite of other creative programs.
Let me explain to you just a little bit with regards to the Adobe model.
First off, Adobe Premiere Pro used to be a standalone program.
I say it used to be.
It still is, but you can't buy it outright.
You used to be able to purchase Adobe Premiere, Pro Photoshop, Illustrator After Effects.
All of these programs individually, none of the Adobe Suite can be bought outright.
It's quite a sweeping statement and there are certain instances where you can, but for the whole part
or for the main part, you can't.
Let me explain that a little bit further.


### 2. Standalone Program vs Creative Cloud Suite (Pros & Cons)

So here we are on the Adobe main site.
You can start a free trial.
So if you're still homing in on whether to actually invest in the programs and in the software, you
can start a free trial.
Just note that old trial software from Adobe will be restricted.
There'll be certain elements of the programme that won't work.
You also have a limited free trial.
Most of them cover for about 30 days, but you won't actually be able to get to the end of a project
to export over a certain amount of time.
So take Premiere Pro, for instance.
You'll only be able to export up to a certain length of video and it just it may be also watermarked.
So an image over that video.
So it can't really be used.
Let me deep dive a little bit.
With regards to the Adobe model.
So as you can see, first off, we have some subcategories.
So we have a photography package.
We also have all apps.
And below you can see each of the individual programs that are available on a month by month subscription.
I said that you can't buy them outright.
Used to be able to.
And what used to happen with that and the reason why Adobe have moved over to the subscription service
is firstly it ensures that they have an ongoing revenue stream for them.
Secondly, it means that they can continue to update that program effectively all the way through that
year.
You see, take Premiere Pro, for instance, Premiere Pro used to have a new version pretty much every
year to 18 months, sometimes two years if developments needed to take that long.
Now, with Premiere Pro, it's updated all the way through the year.
There are major updates normally around April and maybe around October, November, but there are also
bug fixes all the way through the year, which there were with the standalone programs.
But rather than developing something new in the program and Adobe thinking, ah, we'll wait until the
next version so people have to buy again, it's just released.
Granted, after a couple of years you are effectively paying more for a standalone product like Premiere
Pro.
However, when it was a purchasable outright license for the software and you didn't have to pay anything
more when there were new developments in the new version, say you're on Premiere Pro for season four.
That's what they used to call it.
And then the upgrade was to cs5.
You then need to pay again.
There were some times upgrade payments so you could get it for 50% rather than paying the full price.
But you still had to pay again.
At some point you've got to pay.
Also, with being able to do it as a month by month subscription, it cut down on the amount of pirated
copies that people were searching for as rather than paying £400 straight off to use a software.
As you can see with Premiere Pro here, it's £19.97.
It's not always £19.97.
Stay tuned.
Where are you going to go?
So quite simply, Premiere Pro can be bought or licensed standalone.
It can also be got within the all apps option.
Now, as you can see, all apps here is £49, 94 per month and that covers the whole creative cloud
suite.
We'll look at that in a in a couple of seconds.
What I do want to mention is that you don't always have to pay these prices.
If you're savvy and you can search on the Internet.
There are always there's always somewhere that is offering deals.
And it's not just for your first month.
If you get a good deal normally around Black Friday or New Year sales, Christmas sales or the holiday
sales, you can normally find it for a reduced amount and that reduced amount goes throughout that whole
year.
Then when you get to the end of that year, Adobe will get in contact and say, Are your prices going
back up to what it should be?
You just shop around again.
Personally, in ten years, what is it been subscription for?
Maybe six or seven years now?
Maybe a little bit longer.
I've never paid full price, so if you can shop around, you don't have to either.
So let me take a quick look at Premiere Pro standalone.
So you don't just get Premiere Pro, you also get and it's not actually explained here.
You get free free trials for their Adobe Stock images.
I've personally never used it, but you can pay annually or monthly.
The price will vary as you see £238.42.
That's an annual prepaid amount, but it's not bought outright.
You only buy in the licence for a year but also with Premiere Pro you.
Always get a Adobe Media encoder that always comes packaged with Premiere Pro, even though it's not
listed here, because that's what you also use for Premiere Pro.
Now why would you want to get any of the programs if all you're wanting to do is edit video premiere
Pro can do that?
Absolutely.
However, there are certain elements in Premiere Pro, certain elements in all of these programs that
work together with what Adobe Term as dynamic link the one product the one program that I see so much
in my premiere pro work, although we're not really going to cover it on this course because it's just
so it's so detailed and so deep dive is aftereffects.
There are motion graphics templates to name just one element.
They're called mo guts emoji art.
Very clever and to use an after effects.
McGirt in premiere pro which is something that's actually made in after effects but can be opened in
Premiere Pro you have to have after effects installed.
You don't even need to open it.
But Premiere Pro needs after effects to read the file when you're opening.
And we're not going to be working with any more goats in this tutorial, but just bear that in mind
because if that's £20 a month and that's £20 a month, you're getting already close to the £50 a month.
Also, you don't always pay.
I've never paid this price, so it might be better for you to get all apps.
The reason also to have all apps other than after effects is if you're a videographer, you probably
are also a photographer.
At least take some photos.
Lightroom is in there, which is kind of Photoshop, but much scaled down and much easier to work with
to just tweak your photos.
Illustrator in Illustrator you can make or even import already made vector graphics standalone still
graphics which can then be brought into premiere pro or brought through after effects into premiere
pro and be animated.
We're getting a little bit ahead of ourselves, but I think all I'm trying to make the case here for
is if you think you're going to use other stuff to really go into stuff is a technical term into premiere
pro.
It may be worth going with all apps however you do it.
That's how you get the program.
Once you go through either buy now on the all apps or premiere pro, you will then download what is
called Adobe Creative Cloud.


### 3. Adobe Creative Cloud Desktop

This is Adobe Creative Cloud.
And as you can see, here are all my programs that I have from the suite.
Camera roll is not a standalone product that comes with Lightroom, classic Lightroom and also Photoshop
in this creative cloud desktop app, whether you're on a PC or in a mac works exactly the same.
This keeps all of your programs up to date.
As you can see, everything is up to date.
You can set that to be automatic or when you choose to update.
If you're in the middle of a project and an update comes for, say, Premiere Pro, you're probably
best completing that project first before you update.
So you've got Premiere Pro installed.
It's all here.
Let's get it open and let's start playing.

## 2 Overview of Adobe Premiere Pro
### 1. Opening Premiere Pro & Alt vs Option
(Source:  [aliyun.com: 2. Overview of Adobe Premiere Pro - 1. Opening Premiere Pro & Alt vs Option](https://tingwu.aliyun.com/doc/transcripts/kvjonypo62eynlx3))
Once you first Open Premiere Pro, you'll be greeted with this screen.
You will be greeted with the screen every time you open premiere pro and as you have projects that you've
already worked on, these will be listed here.
It will always say Welcome to Premiere Pro and your name.
No, that's not me.
My name is Adam.
Emma is my wife and she sorts out all our bills because I'm terrible with money.
So that's why her name is there.
Just in case you're wondering.
Before we go any further, I need to point out one difference.
Depending on what system you're working on, whether it's a PC or Mac.
The one real difference between the two operating systems is one modifier key, and that is the alt
button.
This isn't my keyboard.
Mine's much cleaner than this, but on most Windows PCs or their keyboards, you will have the control,
the Windows button and the alt.
If you're on a laptop, you'll possibly have a function key as well.
Here.
Now I'm going to be referring to Control, Alt and obviously shift, which is just above quite a lot
as modifiers are used a lot in pretty much all of Adobe's programs.
When I say Alt and I'll try to remember to say the Mac version when I'm doing it, but I've been using
Premiere Pro for so long, there's a good chance I might just forget as we're running.
So what?
I mean when I say alt, if you're on a mac is this button right here and that is the option key.
There's also an alt key here, but this is the option key or the command key.
It's not clear.
So if you're on a mac and I say alt, I mean the option key.
I'll try and remember, but I'm not guaranteeing.


### 2. Starting a Project
(Source:  [aliyun.com: 2. Overview of Adobe Premiere Pro - 2. Starting a Project](https://tingwu.aliyun.com/doc/transcripts/3kprqldv26ly9xgd)) 
Understanding the layout.
So when you first open up Premiere Pro, you can either open a project.
As I said, there will be listed here, but only a certain number of them.
Or you can start a new project soon as the world together.
Let's start new project with Premiere Pro and a lot of the Adobe Suite.
When you first start a project it wants you to set where you want that project to be saved.
This is for two reasons.
One, so you don't accidentally closed on a project and you're not able to find it again because it's
saved somewhere randomly.
And secondly, it can sort out where your autosave files are the worst thing in Premiere Pro and all
of the Adobe Suite but Premiere Pro for me and maybe After Effects is you'll be spending 1015 minutes
on a project and then maybe you save it, you go and get a coffee, you then do another 2 hours work.
And if you've not saved it and there's not auto autosave on enabled on the program, if it then crashes,
you lose everything.
And that can be so debilitating.
So it gets you.
It will happen to you?
Hopefully not, but there's every chance it will happen to you and it really hurts.
So what we do is we set the save file right at the beginning and then we make sure that it runs.
AutoSave I have it set for, I think either six or 7 minutes.
We'll have a look when we're setting this up and it just gets in the way sometimes, but it's just really
reassuring knowing that it's just auto saving.
So from that moment on, you're okay, okay.
So here we go.
We've got a location.
If you need to set your location, hit browse and you can set your location where we're saving it.
I have it on a second harddrive on my computer and I'm saving it in the temporary folder under premiere
pro.
So if I select folder there, we then given the name and untitled.
So we're going to name this our project.
Now at this point you need to make sure that you've downloaded all the footage that I've supplied with
this course.
There are some things that I can't send you which I can show you where to get, but we'll cover that
when we get to it.
So there's a lot of times along here we just need to make sure of a couple of things.
If you have a graphics card built into your PC or your Mac, you need to make sure that it is selected.
I have a quite a powerful GPU in here, so I've got that selected.
So a lot of the heavy work is done by the GPU when it can.
If not, it will use the processor.
Your mileage may vary depending on what PC or MAC specification you have.
Other than that, we can leave the rest of this just untouched under scratch disks.
Scratch disks are a number of different temporary files which will be made in the background as you
go through your project.
It's fine and the default is to save it as right next to where you're saving your project.
However, it is best practice if you want to to go to a second harddrive.
I have it in my cache and I've saved it into premiere scratch files.
This isn't absolutely needed.
However, this can help if your computer is running a little bit slow and you need to offload some of
that work.
Under in jest settings.
We're leaving that we're not touching that we'll be working with proxies but were not ingesting the
footage.
Ingesting is simply a way of importing the footage in a certain way which certain design houses and
editing houses use.
We're not going to be using that in this course.
It's going to be we're going to be deep dived enough.
We're not going to cover things that really aren't pertinent to you.
And when I say I haven't used it, I really mean that.
And as I said before, earlier in this course, I've been using Premiere Pro for over ten years.
I use it professionally.
I run a media production company and I've never used ingest settings.
So once all that's fine.
We've got our project named, we've got our location where we're saving it set.
We hit.
Okay.


### 3. Understanding the Layout & Setting Up the Workspace
(Source:  [aliyun.com: 2. Overview of Adobe Premiere Pro - 3. Understanding the Layout & Setting Up the Workspace](https://tingwu.aliyun.com/doc/transcripts/4l6xqabwymo69m2y))
So once you're first in Premiere Pro, you'll be given a load of tabs along here.
There's probably actually more here than in yours because I have a certain number of layouts that I
use throughout my workflow.
You will definitely have the first four or five.
So first off, we have learning, we then have assembly.
As you can see when I'm clicking these, it's changing the layout of the program editing.
Then we have color.
Effects.
Audio graphics, captions, libraries.
You get the picture.
Personally, I only actually switch between two or three workspaces throughout my time in Premiere Pro
and we will cover those as we get to them.
So first and foremost, what do these things do?
Okay.
Well, you need to do a little bit of house clearing straight off the bat.
And I'm going to show you the most simplified and just beautiful layout that I found over my years of
using Premiere Pro.
So if you go on the editing workspace, this is the default editing workspace for Premiere Pro or how
Adobe say this is the best way to do it.
Okay, down in the bottom left is our project bin, which we will cover.
But if you want to follow along with me and set it up like this, I promise you going forward, it's
going to be a lot easier to work into.
Remember what I said about if I say I haven't used it in ten years yet?
There's a number of things along here that I have never used.
I don't really see the need for them because there are other ways to get to that information if you
need it.
Okay.
We definitely need our project bin here.
These are bins and these are windows.
These are.
Well, they're not really.
It gets complicated.
And I know that's my job to explain, but I'm not explaining things that are really relevant because
they're never relevant to anybody.
So if you tag along here, you can see that we switch this little window to different areas.
There are only two tabs in here that we're actually going to be keeping, and that is project and effects.
So if you left click on Media Browser, Right Click and close panel gone, do that again with libraries,
do it again with info, do again with markers and do it again with history already.
Much cleaner.
Now all of this can also be moved.
Pay attention to this because this is one bit that you'll do.
You move something around and it will either disappear.
It will undock.
I'll show you that.
Or you'll put it somewhere where you don't want it and then can't figure out how to move it back.
So as you can see, we have similar up here to what we had down here, but just with four taps.
So we have source, no clips.
That's an important window effect controls.
That's another important window.
Audio clip mixer.
We are not going to use that.
I never use that.
And I think it's so dangerous.
I'll explain that in a minute.
And metadata don't need metadata.
Right click close panel.
Oh, do you feel like you're having a spring clean?
Okay, so let's wait.
Before we get round here, let's just set up this area.
So what I do and I normally work in a ultrawide monitor.
In fact, I'm working on an ultrawide monitor now, but I'm actually scaled down to six by nine, so
it will play on most people's screens, if you know what that means, great.
You're ahead.
And there will be a part in this course where we will cover stuff that you kind of already know, but
it's good to go for it anyway.
It's good to pay attention and really just refresh if there are any things that I'm explaining in this
tutorial that you already know, it is a good idea not to skip ahead anyway and just keep an eye and
just refresh your knowledge and understanding.
Okay.
So this is our project window, as it were.
We're going to grab this now.
Watch what happens here.
So right over where the name is left click and then drag.
Keep your finger on the mouse button on it.
Now, as you can see, my cursor has changed to a black pointer with a little square, and now anywhere
I go, it's highlighting different areas.
Now what this is doing is this we can easily just move this round.
So I'm moving this project window.
You see how that switches between effects.
Now, this is a bit of a bold stroke, but this is where I put my project Patrick window.
You grab it, and rather than in there, which if I let go, it would actually add underneath here,
it can get really complicated.
I'm going to grab this.
I'm going to go all the way over to the left side of my monitor and then back a little bit.
And as you can see, rather than the purple colors around here, we get a green band and that green
band spans the top and bottom of this.
Whole thing let go.
And that has now pushed everything that was there over to the right.
And now this project area is huge.
Oh, how do we do that?
And so to crack it, we get there and we pull back.
So I normally have my project area about here.
Then we grab effects and we do the same.
But we don't go here because that is then going to put effects next to programs to project.
And you see what's happening here.
What we're going to do is we're going to grab effects.
I'm actually going to put it on the same level as the project window.
When I let go there, then now tat next to each other.
Remember, they were down here on their own and now up here I'm going to grab projects and go to the
left of effects and I'm also going to resize this.
You can see how customizable this is and you can really once you get into Premiere Pro and use it a
lot, you will notice just how you want a different window in a different area.
You will find your way to do this.
I know that doesn't really help.
It doesn't really.
This is the way you should do it.
I'm showing you the way I do it.
But there are so many entities that do it so many different ways.
There are other programs which you can't do this with, which is great.
If you're going from one machine to another to someone else's machine, you can add it straight away.
But at the same time, you can't manipulate all the windows to be exactly where you want them when you
want them.
So we have our project area and our effects right here.
I promise you this will make sense.
I promise you.
Just follow me along.
So Effects Controls is going to stay there.
Source clips is going to stay there as well.
Audio clip mics we're going to get rid of.
But I'm actually going to no, I'm not I'm not going to leave that.
You don't want this.
Okay.
If you've got a clip in here, which you will see soon, I promise, if you've got a clip in here and
it's highlighted and you're affecting it, it only affects that one clip.
And in my workflow, you never want to do that.
You want to actually effect a track.
But we can't see audio track mixer here.
Mm hmm.
So what we're going to do, if there's any window the ever want in a workspace and you don't want to
go to a different workspace to get it, because then when you switch back to the main workspace, it's
not there.
You go to window, click window.
And what we want is audio track mixer, which is right here.
Look at all these other windows that aren't open, all the tick boxes mean that are currently open in
your workspace.
There are so many others.
But remember some of the ones that we got rid of?
We got rid of history, we got rid of info, we got rid of learn what that was on a previous workspace.
We got rid of media browser, we got rid of Mark as so much we got rid of because we don't need it.
So let's click audio track mixer and what happens, it's actually put it right there.
In fact, that's where we want it, but we don't want audio clip mixer.
So right click and close panel Oh feels good.
Now down here are some shortcuts that clickable shortcuts but look at all this dead space.
I don't have this here.
What I do is I grab this.
And I bring it up to here and it sits at the side.
And now I grab this and size it all the way down.
So now what we have is we have our source monitor, which will have video or image in there.
We have our effects controls, which we can toggle over when we need it.
We have our audio track mixer again, which we can toggle over when we need it.
The program monitor is where your main video's going to be, and at the bottom is the timeline, which
is where we're going to edit.
There's only one more thing to do to get this workspace ready, and that is this.
In fact, I'm going to leave this and I'll show you why it doesn't need to be this big.

## 3 Setting Up Premiere Pro
### 1. Managing Existing Workspaces
(Source:  [aliyun.com: 3. Setting Up Premiere Pro - 1. Managing Existing Workspaces](https://tingwu.aliyun.com/doc/transcripts/g34dn8ogl3b3qwjz))
So we're on to starting the project for real.
I know there's been a lot of housekeeping so far, everything that you've done so far other than starting
the project.
So all of the work space, the windows, everything like that, that doesn't have to be done every time,
I promise.
And to make sure that doesn't have to be done every time.
It's quite simple to save a workspace.
So we've been editing the editing workspace.
If you're happy with where it is so far and you're thinking, I don't want to go back from here, anything
that I change within this workspace now will be changes for the good.
This is a good base for me to build my workspace, if that's what you're thinking.
Right click up here in this tab and save as a new workspace.
Now you can call it anything you like.
I've obviously done that before and I labeled it Adam editing.
So I'm going to save this, as I could say, editing workspace.
I could say anything, really.
But I'm going to label this as our editing just to make it clear which workspace we're working in.
Obviously, I am a jobbing working videographer and I don't want to save this as Adam editing because
that will totally ruin my professional workspace.
So I'm going to say this is our editing, but you can just save it as editing or your name and editing.
Editing.
I don't think I've ever used editing so many times in one sentence, but you get what I say.
You can save it any way you like.
So once we hit okay, that's now been added all the way over here.
And editing is all the way over there.
Now, it may not be a big deal, but if you can't quite see it, depending on what screen size you have,
if you click on this little double arrow and edit workspace, you can see all of the different workspaces
here.
Our editing is right at the end here.
Now it doesn't look like these can be moved, but actually we can.
If you grab it and pull it, you can actually bring it all the way to the beginning.
If I press, okay, that's now over here, you can also clean all this up if you don't want that many.
I don't know anyone who uses this many workspaces.
If we go back to right click and edit workspaces learning, you can actually drag that.
You can't delete that one because that's default with Adobe.
But you can actually say Do not show.
So you can put it under a list of do not show.
Actually, I've never done this before, but production don't want to show matter.
Logging don't want to show all panels.
That is the craziest workspace ever.
It literally opens all of these windows.
But we showed you all these windows.
It opens them all.
And if you haven't got a if you've got anything less than maybe a 50 inch screen, it goes a little
bit.
Yeah, overkill.
So we've got our editing here assembly we don't use or I'm not going to show you an assembly workspace
because everything that we do is going to be in pretty much the editing workspace other than colour
and maybe audio, possibly graphics.
But we'll see as we move along.
But you can clean this up.
But for now, I'm just going to hit.
Okay.
And as you can see, some of these moved and we're in our editing here.
Why didn't assembly go?
Maybe because it doesn't have to.
Because there's so many spaces there.
I don't know.
Let's have a look.
Assembly.
Did I not move it?
Let's move it.
See how easy this is?
You just grab what you don't want.
I don't want editing because I don't want to confuse, so I'm just going to say don't show.
You also have an overflow menu here.
So if scripting was something you didn't really want to appear but you didn't want to have to deep dive
into here, you could just put it onto the overflow menu.
And that was the overflow menu right here.
See my scripting is there.
Everything is so customizable in this.
It's brilliant.


### 2. Initial Preferences & Auto-save Setup

Now.
I said at the beginning of this, there's quite a bit.
We've done a lot of housekeeping.
There's one more bit of housekeeping we need to do before we go further, and that is making sure that
we have that autosave selected.
So to do that, we go up to the top here to edit down to preferences and down to AutoSave.
That then opens our preferences window right here.
If you did just click general, that would have been here.
It's just a bit of a quick way to get to where you want in the preferences.
We'll just hit general there and we can go straight down to Auto Save.
It's great to be in here.
I love it in here.
And we will look at it.
Just a touch of what you need to make sure that is right in here.
Okay.
So we've got the check on here for automatically save projects.
I, I think 15 minutes.
You can do a lot once you get up to speed, not necessarily while watching this tutorial, but once
you get up to speed, you can actually do quite a lot in 15 minutes.
And as a lot of the stuff that you do in in video is time to maybe better music or you're you're eyeballing
a lot of things.
Maybe you're moving around a bit of text or a bit of video, you're animating it in 15 minutes.
You can do quite a lot of work and losing that and then having to recreate it as best as you could,
that not only not only will you not be able to get it exactly how you did the first time, which isn't
necessarily always a bad thing, but it's the it's the feeling.
It's the feeling of going through all of those steps again, thinking, I've already done this.
So this is very much a personal preference as a lot of these things are in this program.
But it it kind of depends how much you're willing to put up with it.
Popping up with autosave all the time.
I normally have it at 6 minutes.
That's just a personal preference for me and that's just how I work.
Maximum project versions.
I think we're okay at 20, so once it auto saves 20 times, it will then override overwrite even the
oldest of those auto saved versions.
I'll show you what the auto saves look like as we go through as we build some auto saves in this project,
save backup project to create a creative cloud.
I've never done that.
You can actually have something within Premiere Pro and a lot of the other Adobe programs where you
can do team editing.
I've never got it quite to work.
I think that's actually within collaboration.
Yeah.
And I just I don't use that a number of a number of editing houses that maybe have people who are working
remotely or just literally collaborating in different parts of the country or different parts of the
world they will have team projects.
Isn't amazing that we can do these things now.
It's it's it blows my mind and I work in tech and online most of my life and yet I'm still blown away.
Some of the things we can do these days and I have a quick look at through these because I've actually
wiped my settings.
So let's have a quick look through and see if there's anything that I can spot that I have changed in
the past.
This you won't have this.
Mr. HALL Premiere Composer This is a plug in that I use all the time.
And we may looking forward, we may add to this course with regards to plug ins and things like that.
Let's see how we go.
But your a lot of your work can be done with plug ins and stuff and device control.
I don't really touch that this pre pre-roll is it's the playback want to actually add an effects I don't
really bother with that graphics is it will be dependent on your geographical location labels are great
a lot of videographers and editors use them.
I will show you how you can use them to help.
To help you be able to see what you need to in your timeline at a glance.
We will touch on that in media.
Okay.
This is going to be a little bit of a lesson and you can try and get your head around it as I'm saying
it.
But this could be something that you need to really understand and look at in in more detail with regards
to where you are, what you've shot, or what you'll be shooting.
So the media time base here is 25 apps I output in 25 apps.
F-Pace quite simply stands four frames per second.
So if you think about an animation, a cartoon every second, if we're running at 25 frames per second,
that would be one of those old style old school cells of a cartoon.
One of those 25 of those every second.
Okay.
That's our main output.
That's my main output.
And that is the main output of the UK.
These rules don't don't really matter as much as they used to with regards to TV screens and all that
kind of thing.
Depending on where you are geographically, they don't matter that much anymore.
They do matter in one sense, and that is Hertz, H, Z or HDR, z.
To give you the full name and I will touch on that.
So keep that in mind.
We will circle back to that.
So we are put in 25 frames per second that I have found on YouTube, on Facebook, on Instagram, outputting
in 25 Mbps is a great frame rate to give a natural feel.
That's for a lot.
A lot.
In fact, most videographers output in they may put out in 24 PE or 24 reps in the U.S. and in certain
other parts of the in the world.
But generally 25 amps is that I'm not going to overegged this right now because we are going to have
to circle back to this.
But just as it's come up here, let's just keep that in mind.
Our output is 25 frames per second.
That is not to be confused with shutter speed if you're a videographer, and it's not to be confused
with your resolution, whether it be 1080, which is full HD or 4K or even eight K when not playing
with eight K footage here you do have one 4K piece of footage in your course work that I've sent you,
Dutch, just to show you what can be done with it.
But anyway, everything else is 1080 but 25 helps keep that in mind.
What I said at the beginning was it's not that complicated, but anything that does need to be explained,
I need you to just sit there and listen and to try and get it into your head.
Let's just move on.
I think that's enough thinking for now.
Media Cache.
So depending on what your system is like, you may want to offload your cash to a different drive.
So my main program is running on the C drive.
The media cache files are also being put here on the C drive that's putting a lot of work on the C drive.
If I go to browse and I go to my computer, I actually have a cache hard drive right here.
And again this remember where we set at the scratch files in there.
I set up my mini cache in here.
It just it's on a different hard drive.
It doesn't have to bother with anything.
Again, my media cache database that will also go into my cache.
This isn't absolutely pertinent what you need to do, but it is best practice if you need to set up
on an external on a on an additional internal harddrive if you have it.
If you don't, that's absolutely fine.
Media Cache Management.
I automatically delete cache files over 90 days and I always step that down to 45.
It doesn't delete any footage, it just deletes the cache.
Your cache is what's building up in the background with Premiere Pro, and before you know it, you
may not have added anything else to your computer.
You may be working with the same two or three gigs worth of footage, but all of a sudden your harddrive
is full.
And that's because the cache is here and building up in the background to make it faster in the program.
Problem is, when that gets too much, it then actually doesn't.
It makes it slow down.
I'll show you how to clear that out as well.
I have 64 gigs on my computer.
Most laptops will come between eight and 16 gigabytes.
Now, the more gig ram you have, the faster it will run.
Just make sure that you do have some reserved for all the programs.
The things can run in the background in Windows that's Windows Explorer and all or all that that kind
of does which runs the operating system.
In the background with regards to Macs, it would be bare being able to run the iOS, as you can say,
my C my RAM is shared with AA, which is after effects premiere pro pal, which I.
It's Prelude, which doesn't actually run anymore.
I think it runs in the background.
Adobe Media Encoder Remember I said that was a program that was bundled with Premiere Pro, so that's
me during Coda, I've got piece which is Photoshop and Audition.
So yeah, 58 gigabytes of the 64 gigabytes of my RAM installed is actually shared pretty much across
Adobe playback.
This doesn't really need to be bothered with it.
When you add a transition or anything and you hit play straight away, we don't really need to touch
on that.
And that's for your sync settings.
That's just when you set up your settings, you can actually sync them and save them elsewhere.
And that's always a really good thing to do.
I'm not going to do it unless because it's going to overwrite my own settings, but it will show you
how I'm a haven't started anything yet and I don't intend to, but I will show you how to in your timeline.
Don't worry about all this.
This is absolutely fine.
There's nothing to change here.
We still on 25 frames.
A second audio transition or default transition is 1/2.
That's fine.
Still image default duration.
I'll show you that.
That's 5 seconds, that's fine.
And everything else is great.
And in trim means absolutely nothing to me.
It really doesn't.
So it shouldn't really bother you.
It's okay.
And all the changes that we've made are saved in there.
Let's just touch on that.
Sync Settings.
If you look down the bottom left hand side here, if you click that, you can actually sync your settings
now.
And in that screen, if you set it up, you will have it set up with whatever email address you set
it with Premiere Pro with Adobe, it will sync they'll settings and if you ever have to reinstall,
you just hit sync settings again and it will bring down all of those settings that you had at what's.
I finished recording this.
I will manage my sync settings and I will bring back down my old settings, but then again I'm setting
them up again so it doesn't really matter.
Okay, so that is the last bit of housekeeping, I promise to this point.
This is a long and arduous task at first, but everything you've done up until this point will not need
to be repeated.
Other than starting the project, how good does that feel that everything you've done now doesn't need
to be redone, especially if you sync your settings?
The minute that you sync to your settings, everything will be great.
Okay.
Strap in, because next chapter we are getting into bringing enough wattage and starting to play.
But brace yourself, there will be a little bit more information with regards to frame rates.
Sorry, but it does need to be covered.


### 3. Workspace Recap and Reasons Why

Now, at this point, I know that you're dying to get in and start playing.
Bear with me because I know how confusing it can get if you jump ahead and just start editing and playing
around with clips and you back yourself into a corner.
So bear with me.
This is best, best practice.
I promise.
I promise you that.
And if you follow me, whether you're following me along with the source material that I've sent, or
you just sit there and watch, I promise you, by the end, you will have a much better understanding
than if we just deep dived into it and just started playing.
Because I could start saying, Do this, do that to the other.
And it's not clear what I mean.
I've taken a lot of time and a lot of preparation to show you these things at the right time, in the
right order and the right way to set you up with your knowledge going forward.
So once you've finished this course, of course you can come back and use it as a reference.
But leaving and finishing this course, my main intention is for you to be competent enough, if not
confident enough, to really go ahead and do what you want to do.
Okay.
With that in mind, let's move on to importing your media and the variety of ways to import.
So a quick, brief recap of what we have here.
It's going to be that bear.
Everything has to be in the right order.
And I always love project first and benefits.
So in here we have where all our footage is going to be stored within the program.
Here we have our effects.
Generally, we don't need both at the same time, which is why I have them stacked in this one window
together.
The beauty of having this length here is not really because of the effects, although if you start to
deep dive, you can see how quickly this takes up space.
Some of these very briefly do also have other parts here, but I don't actually use them.
Anything within the effects panel.
With regards to these, we may touch on some of them in the future, but that's why I have it sized
here.
The reason why we have this length is because when we start adding in footage, this very quickly fills
up and I'll show you the best way to manage your footage so you can easily get to it.
There is also a search bar here, those eagle eyed among you may have seen.
But yeah, so that's that little window.
In this window we have source which will become apparent soon.
Once we have footage in here, we initially can play with it in here before it shows on here.
Effects controls again this will be when we're playing with clips will be will be down here in the timeline
and this will be your main work area.
Audio Track Mixer.
Remember, this is where we set up what we wanted.
We did not want audio clip mixer.
If at this point you haven't done that and it says audio clip mixer here, right click and close that
panel and go to window and select audio track mixer.
If it's not already there, if it opens, maybe here, grab it here and drag it, not there, but open
to this line.
So it's next to effects controls.
Here we have a few of our buttons which we may or may not use during the editing process.
And this huge program window is where our video will show down the bottom of here.
You can see a few little hot keys.
We will also be editing this, but as you can see, that grayed out at the moment and we can't get to
them until we have something on the timeline.
We can, but we can't really show you what it means.
You may feel that certain certain areas of this have been done in a strange order, but the only way
in which I've been able to show you certain parts up to now is when we've done other things.
So what I mean by that is I haven't been able to show you how to play with the workspaces until we've
set up a project, even though we haven't really started our project other than naming it and saving
it.
So the next part is to get some form of media into our project to start playing with.
Now me, I say media rather than video because in Adobe Premiere Pro we can play with video.
Of course we can also.
Play with image.
We can also play with audio and graphics, but that will come later down the line.
I say play because I see that I play for a living and that's what you need to keep in mind when you're
in Premiere Pro and in any of these programs, really it is play.
We're playing around, we're creating and nothing is cut and dried.
There are different ways to play with media.
There's different ways to present what you're editing.
But let's get that footage in to the project.

## 4 Importing Media
### 1. Variety of Ways to Import Footage

So as I mentioned, this is where all our media will be.
There are a number of ways to get your media into here.
I'll show you the two ways which are kind of default in here.
I'll show you the third way, which is the best practice for me to making sure that everything stays
together.
So first off, we can go to file and import and here's our project and I place the footage into the
same folder where we saved our project.
Now, once I double click into here, it may not show the same as yours because I'm pretty sure I'm
going to be adding more footage than is already here.
But this is where I'm starting with this.
As I said, we play.
I say we play.
This is also a creative process for me.
So what we end up with at the end may not be what I intended at the beginning, purely because if there's
a certain part within the footage and I think, Oh, we could do something like that, I'll include
that as well.
I'll drag it in at the time.
But it will also be obviously when you get this course, it will be in here.
And I'm already thinking that I'm going to be putting some kind of photo in here as well.
So I'm actually going to select this and put all this footage into a videos folder.
So you have at least a videos folder and an image folder.
So that starts the process that I actually want to show anyway.
First and foremost, this is the file and import way.
And if I double click, if I go to open, that can open that folder.
If I go to select an import folder, they'll import the whole folder.
Not only will that import the contents of that folder, but it will maintain the folder structure.
There's an easy way to do this, but that's how you do it when you double click on this.
Just like in Finder or Windows Explorer, all the footage comes up here.
Now, this is all footage from a pizza oven review I did on my YouTube channel.
Let me quickly show you what I did with that footage.
In fact, this might be a fun little exercise.
I'm going to open the project that I made my review in.
So here is the project.
This is the first time we've actually seen anything on the timeline.
I'm fully aware of that.
Let me point out a couple of things.
Before we go any further.
Firstly, if you wondering what I look like there I am better looking or worse looking than you thought.
Don't answer that question.
So if I zoom out, this is a project on the timeline.
What can you first see?
Okay, well, first off, you can see that there are small little thumbnails as you look through this
footage.
Now, those are actually representations of the footage themselves.
However, you can also see that on this video, these are two different colours.
Because remember, when I talks about labels, I go to preferences and labels.
As you can see, this right here is what's Premiere Pro Call Iris.
And this right here is what Premiere Pro call Kariba at no forest.
Yeah, I'd say it's forest.
Can't get too close, but.
Yeah.
Green.
It's some form of green.
And the reason why we use these colours and I used I don't use it in all projects.
I do use it in pretty much complicated projects.
And I use it because at a glance I can see what I'm looking at.
So I know the all the iris or what you and I would call blue are the pieces to camera.
So that's also known as a roll.
The green is what I've done.
Second camera.
So it was actually me if I just way it doesn't playback.
It was me looking at this pizza of it.
And I can see at a glance when I'm showing this kind of footage and when I'm showing this kind of footage,
I know you don't understand everything that you're looking at right now.
Don't worry.
I'm not just going to assume that we are covering this, I promise.
But what I want to show you is the footage that you've got, what can be done with it.
So here I am talking and here's all the footage that you don't have, which was explaining what I was
doing at the time.
But if I move along to here, if you've already looked at some of the footage, you will recognise this
footage.
Now, if you've already played it back, you will know that it plays back like this.
You ready?
Yeah.
That's my lovely wife, Emma.
And that's it in real time.
Now, what I've done is I've slowed it down and I've also played around with a color.
Again, we will cover this.
But very briefly, look.
You see how just with a few cuts and slowing the footage down, we actually have something that's presentable
and looks really nice.
A few more colours on that, bit more saturation than you've seen in the footage that I've seen here.
We'll go over exactly how to sort that out, too.
So that's just a brief look at what we're actually going to be doing and playing with and how the footage
can be manipulated.
See that autosave comes up all the time.
I'm just going to control and s there as well so that updates my actual project file.
That's always a good thing to remember as well when you're saving your file.
If you see AutoSave come up and you're not busy and you're here and your keyboard just hit control and
s and that will save as well.
So that will not only save on your autosave, but it will bake it in to your current project file as
well.
So everything marries up.
It's just it's a habit that you will get into.
So let's close this project right now because we're not quite there yet and we're back into our project.
So remember, we've imported the videos and we're right here.
We did that by file and import.
Now the other way to do it, if I get rid of that, I control.
And that, by the way, if you don't know the shortcut control and Z, that is probably one of the most
important shortcuts you will ever learn.
Control and Z is undo it, undo it, undo.
Who's the last thing you did?
We'll cover that in much more detail in the future.
So that's how we did it.
We did it for file and import.
The other way is to double click into this space and it will open.
The last place you were in in Premiere Pro, so that's opened up this here with the videos.
If I go back one and I import folder again, that does the exact same thing.
Here's all the footage in here.
Now let's get rid of that.
One more time, Control and Z gets rid of that.
And the other way to get it is here's our footage.
Here is the videos and here's all your videos here.
You can simply drag and drop one file and it's straight into here.
Let me undo that.
If we come back one and grab that folder, drag it in and drop it brings in that folder very much like
when we hit import and selected the folder import folder here.
However, the easiest way I find is to make build everything into here in all the different folders.
So let's say we look at the folder that I had originally for the pizza oven, so I've got my renders
here, which are all the different types of render that I put that got my images right there as thumbnails
for the review builds all that and screengrabs for the client and also video.
Hold on.
There's more than one video because the main camera was the a73.
So that was the main camera.
When I was doing my unboxing and my bit to camera, there is the A6400, which is my second camera,
which had the second angle when I was unboxing, and I also had the zoom which I didn't actually end
up using, but this was actually a recording of a zoom with the owner of the company.
I didn't end up using that footage, but the easiest way to get all of that in, I don't need the renders
because the renders wasn't there at the time.
But if I select video and hold down control and select images, that's all of those together.
If I then drag that in, that drags in to folders.
Now what I need to point out is the terminology.
This looks like a folder.
In fact, it has a folder icon.
However, this is not what it's called in Premiere Pro.
This is called a bin.
So that's a bin for my video and that's a bin for my images.
But hold on.
That says there's four items.
Okay.
There's four folders, but then there's four videos in there.
On the a6400 there's three videos in there.
And the B-roll.
Wow.
I mean, there's cooking there, which is 28 items.
You get what I'm saying?
But I dragged in the whole folder.
Yeah.
So in the folder slash bin, there's another four items in there and there's two items in the zoom.
There's five items in the B roll arc.
Ah, that's where we're going.
And there's 28 and there's all the footage there.
You get what I'm saying?
So if you drag in, by the way, it doesn't always load straightaway.
It depends the speed of your computer, but if you drag in the folders already in the hierarchy that
you want.
They all come in that way.
So we've got video and images and then we can deep dive into them.
Is that clear?
I think so.
Anyway, let's get rid of those and let's bring back in the original footage that we're using, which
is here, footage, videos.
Drag this in for now.
And these are the files that you have, the video files that you have.
I may even add some more.
We'll see for the pizza of it.
Now, see that autosave controls?
I'm happy with that.
So that is the different ways to import footage.
Now we need to understand that footage.


### 2. Understanding Frame Rates (PAL vs NTSC)
(Source:  [aliyun.com: 4. Importing Media - 2. Understanding Frame Rates (PAL vs NTSC)](https://tingwu.aliyun.com/doc/transcripts/dej8nbxkzo24qpog))
It would be really easy to just open up a program and just start trying to make it work.
And while that has elements of benefit to it, just playing with it and just seeing what you can do.
The problems that arise with that is that you can you can work in a way that one is not very effective
to, isn't very efficient, and three may actually hamper your learning in the future.
I know because I've done that.
I've done that in so many different programs.
And 2 to 3 years down the line, I've realized I've wasted so much time because of my lack of understanding
of the basics.
I preface this part because this is going to be a lot of me talking with a little bit of illustration.
But in my opinion, and I think it's a pretty solid opinion.
Understanding what I'm about to tell you can really help you in the future because you may come across
some kind of footage that you don't really understand why it is, how it is or why isn't, how your
footage that you use normally is a will.
Explain that.
Now, what we need to first understand with regards to video footage is that it's not the same everywhere,
and that is when frame rates of video is affected because of where you are.
You may or you may not know of the term Powell or NTSC.
Now I'm not going to overcomplicate this.
I'm not going to go into the scientific reasons behind it, but I am going to explain it to a level
that helps our understanding and will help you in your knowledge for when you are editing, whether
it be from footage that you have, footage that you've created or footage that has been supplied to
you now.
Powell and NTSC, if you're in the US, Canada, certain parts of South America over here in Burma,
I think that is Japan, think that's Indonesia.
Don't get I'm not really massive on my geography but as you can see from this graphic NTSC is the green
on this world map.
See Kam or Powell and Powell or sea cam is the blue or purple lilac indigo this color.
Now, I've got to be honest, before I started making this cause I'd never heard of sea cap.
Not too sure what that says about me.
However, from my very quick knowledge and quick bit of understanding, Powell and Sea Cam are pretty
much interchangeable for the areas that we are working with them.
The reason why I know that is because, one, I've looked it up and two, I have actually done work
in France and I'm in the UK and I'm on the PAL system and France.
I shot Standard because I assumed, maybe rightly, maybe wrongly, but all pretty much all of mainland
Europe was Powell and I had no problems.
Now what is Powell and what is NTSC?
In short, this is because of the electrical systems in these countries.
Now, why would electrical systems affect a video?
Well, first off, it doesn't affect the actual camera in as much as the power going to the camera,
because pretty much every camera that most people use is battery.
So what does it actually affect with regards to the power?
Well, I know for certain that the UK mains electricity is 240 volts.
The US and most of in fact all of the green areas are 110 volts short 210 volts.
Either way, the reason why that affects is because of what it does with the lighting.
Now what what you get with power is a 50 hertz flicker.
So when you're looking at a light, any light that you have on around you right now, don't don't necessarily
take into consideration your monitor, although your monitor kind of does or is affected by this as
well.
But look around at any light you have turned on right now that will have a flicker rate.
Your phone will have a flicker rate.
Your monitor will have a flicker rate.
But the lighting flicker rate is important because in poor countries the lighting will flicker at 50
hertz, which means it turns on and off, which is unseen to the naked eye.
But it will flicker at 50 hertz.
In NTSC countries, this flicker is different because of the 110 volts in the mains electricity.
This flickers at 60 hertz.
Now I may be slightly wrong with these numbers.
Don't quote me, but this is the difference that we need to be aware of.
Because depending on where you are in the world and depending on what your where your footage was captured
will affect the footage that you use now, not as much as it used to be, because, of course, everything
that was video was played on a TV screen, depending regardless of where you were, it would be on a
TV screen or a projector if it was a big cinema.
That's not necessarily as true these days because so much of the footage that we watch is online, whether
it be on a phone, tablet, a PC monitor or a laptop monitor.
However, even though those screens are flickering at different Hertz, some gaming monitors will have
a refresh rate of 144 hertz or 256 hertz.
And that's great for gaming, but that doesn't really matter with regards to the output because the
big thing is where the footage was captured.
How do I explain this a little bit further up?
I apologize.
Apologies if this seems not important, but it really is.
And I will make it clear why it's important very soon.
But let's just get our in understanding just a little bit more NTSC versus PAL.
Now this to us isn't really important.
The video bandwidth, funnily enough, the audio carrier isn't really that important.
The lines over the field isn't massively important, but this affects this next number and that is the
frames per second of your footage.
Now, pal, as you can see here is 25 frames a second.
NTSC is 29.97 frames per second.
I actually got this off a quick Google search which came up on a video converters website.
I've never used this converter, but this actually highlights where we're up with this because so many
people need to convert their footage.
We don't.
You won't need to, I promise you.
Don't worry.
But some people will do, depending on what they're doing in the footage.
I have never had to.
You should never need to.
But this really speaks to the importance of understanding power versus anti to NTSC.
So your frames per second for NTSC is 29.97, power is 25.
Now that can differ these days.
You get there was a recent Will Smith film that was actually shown in 60 frames a second.
The thing is, the quicker the frames per second, the more you see, the more the refresh rate of that.
It was a bit of a flop, the 60 frames per second film, purely because there wasn't that much motion
blur.
If you look at your hand now right in front of you and give it a quick wave, put it in front of your
screen and wave your hand in front of you.
You will actually see that there's loads of blur there depending on.
The speed that you do it.
Yeah.
You can make out your fingers, but there are actually the space between your fingers becomes muddy,
becomes blurred.
We want motion blur to make things look realistic.
The more frames per second, the more images in that second, the less blur we will get.
Why is this important?
Well, if we go back to our project here, here are our videos and let's just double click what we've
already put in.
Now we can see our clips here, but we can't really see any information.
That's when we come down to here and get ready because we're going to make some changes again to our
workspace.
As I said before, this is an organic thing that changes with you as you go through.
I have actually just seen something that has happened here when I've double clicked and we are going
to address that in the next chapter.
Yeah, let's not get ahead of ourselves.
So here's the footage that we've we've already imported.
This is the pizza oven down the bottom left here.
You can switch you can switch between your list view and what it defaults at, which is the icon view.
This is the freeform view.
I don't use it.
It was a new addition for Premiere Pro a couple of years ago and I don't know one editor that uses it.
It's useful for some people.
It causes more problems than it's worth, in my opinion.
By the way, here we have an adjustable slider, so we can actually, while we're in the icon or thumbnail
view, I call it the thumbnail view.
You can actually size up these.
See how we're in here.
And if you want to see more space here, this is a big, big tip.
Do you know where the tilde key is on your computer?
What is the tilde?
This is Tilde.
So it's what you're looking for.
Is this small little key right here.
Not this.
This.
Now, obviously, on APC, it's normally just to the left of the number one, depending on whether you
have an actual manufacturer's keyboard or a keyboard that you've bought from a third party can differentiate
as to where it is on your keyboard.
If we have a quick look here, it looks like it possibly is there for some Mac keyboards.
I'm not too sure if it will also possibly need a signifier.
I don't.
A modifier, even like a controller or an ultra shift key.
I don't think you will.
So that's what we're looking for.
We're looking for the tilde key.
So it's either it's that little squiggle there.
If we look here, it's the little squiggle.
That's a technical term.
Again, the squiggle.
I'm really I really I'm spoiling you with these technical terms.
But that's the little tilde key that we're looking for.
That little symbol on mine, it's just to the left of one.
The tilde key is something that I have only discovered the use of in Adobe in the last two years.
And it's really helped my workflow because if you have especially if you have smaller screens, this
is brilliant.
If you place your mouse wherever you want to see more of let's see here.
As you can see, we're scrolling all the way down.
Here's all our footage.
And yes, we have made it big, but we can't see at all where if you have your mouse placed, if you
press the tilde key, it maximizes that screen, that window.
You see how everything else is gone.
It's still there.
Press Tilde again and we're back.
So sometimes that can really help when you want to to work out your footage, move it around a little
bit, get a get your head around it.
It really also really helps in the effects controls.
And I will show you that.
And that is something that really frustrated me for years.
And I would have to make my space so much bigger to be able to get into the in controls at all.
It would it would ruin my life.
Not quite, but you understand what I mean?
If we haven't touched on this before and I don't think we have, you see how I've just moved that over?
I've totally ruined my workspace.
But remember, we saved our workspace.
If you ever do something, if you accidentally close a panel and oh, where's that gone?
If you come up to the editing workspace there, you're at the workspace for editing and right click
it.
Remember, we were able to save changes to this workspace, but we're also able to reset the saved layout.
If we click that, we're back to where we were.
Ha!
Breath of fresh air.
Now, what was I saying?
Yes, I was talking about the footage.
So we've made this really, really big.
And that's in the icon view, however.
Sometimes it's much, much easier if you're not looking to screw up.
We will cover over this.
This is a brilliant thing in Premiere Pro, but if we're not looking to scrub through this footage,
we want to see more details about this footage.
You click the list view and all of a sudden we're given the video title.
If you've got images in here, if you've got other types of media music, there's your name and what
I always do, because sometimes it's it's in a different order down the bottom here when I see it,
next time I will show you.
You can just literally click on here and you can actually sort it by name, which is always handy.
So what are what do we have here now?
We have the name of the footage.
We have the frame rate.
This is a hundred frames per second.
I'm going to circle back to this because I think you've gone through too much with us to NTSC and PAL
for now.
But bear with me, I'm going to come back to this.
When you mouse over, it will give you limited information that tells me that it's 1920 by 1080, which
means that's HD and the clip is 9 minutes and 61 microseconds long, sorry, 9 seconds and 61 microseconds
long and it's 100 P, which means it was shot at 100 bits.
Bits aren't really important right now and we will touch on them in a little while.
But it's the frame rate that really, really is the bit we're looking for today.
But if we look at the bottom here, we can actually scroll along because there's other information.
Hold on, do we need to scroll along?
How do we see all together, all of it on the screen at the one time?
How do we do that?
What key do we need?
That's right.
The tilde key, that thing right there.
So if we have our mouse, if I'm just over here and I hit the tilde R, that's not the right window.
That's the program monitor.
We haven't covered that yet.
So press Tilde, come back and we want to look at all of this.
So we leave our mouse in here and hit Tilde and all of a sudden we have all the information in front
of us.
Now, what I want to do is I want to change all of this again.
We're setting ourselves up for success, for efficiency, for everything that we need right in front
of us.
What you're going to do now, again, you won't have to do again, but sadly, this can't be done for
you.
So depending on whether you're on a mac or a PC, I'm pretty sure you're aware of the fact that you
can in here.
If you view under details, you have these details here very similar to what we have here.
Now, if you right click anyway here you can select all the things you want to see or things that you
don't want to see.
If you're not familiar with that this might be a little life hack for you if you don't necessarily want
the date.
I always want the date, so I'm going to leave that in.
This doesn't always cover everything with folders because obviously size and length depends on the file
inside.
So if we go in and we look at these and we go to details, we've now got size.
That's the file size, the type.
We're in AMP for my default video players.
Velshi I can highly recommend that if you don't have it download.
Velshi It's freeware, it's brilliant.
And it plays 99% of all video styles without the need of codecs or anything.
If you don't know what I'm talking about with the closed codecs, you've been very, very lucky.
You will.
So VLC is brilliant.
Whenever you just need to quickly look at a piece of video or you want to check any renders out.
So what else can we actually have here?
If we go to Moore, there is so much else we can include in these details if we want.
You understand what I'm saying here?
Great.
So let's go back into Premiere Pro and let's literally get rid of everything we don't want because there
is so much here that we do not need.
So let's right click anywhere and go to metadata display.
Oh, there's only one thing checked.
Now the reason why this is, is because if everything was in here, was checked, it would be a tick.
But because there's only a certain few things within this dropdown, you see the little arrow there.
This is a well, we call it a shutdown.
So as you see when you click, it twirls, it turns and it twirls down.
The reason why it's a line rather than a tick is because there are some things selected in this group,
but not everything.
Okay, so first off, we're going to leave name because name is grayed out.
You can't do anything about that label.
Label is this color here.
We want that.
I don't use it that much, but I like to have it.
Frame rate?
Absolutely.
We definitely need that.
Media start don't need that media and don't need that media duration.
It's good to have in video in point an out point.
I have never use that information in this been ever video duration as the same as media duration.
Right media duration, yeah.
Sorry.
Media duration.
Video duration.
It's exactly the same.
That would possibly be different if it's an image, let's cut out media duration to make sure it's video
duration in the we don't need sub clicks that we don't need that we don't need that we video info.
Yeah, we want that because the video info is telling us the resolution.
Now this is 1920 by 1080, but it quite easily could be 4K and we want that at a glance.
We want that information.
So let's leave that.
We don't necessarily need the audio information type name.
Don't need that.
Where's tape?
No, nothing.
Never heard of that description.
Don't need that.
Don't need the lock note.
Don't need captured, don't need that, don't need that.
I don't actually think we need anything else.
Good and hide.
Never ever use that in my ten years.
Okay, so I'm happy with that and there's nothing else.
Text We know that there's nothing else in here.
Text Because there's no lines if we weren't there, I have absolutely no idea what that this is.
But if I click, there's a line there.
Okay, so if I click, nothing else is in there.
So we know that everything else other than what we selected has gone.
Let's go to.
Okay, wow.
This is all the information we need.
In fact, let's go right click metadata display and save settings and let's call this video info.
So that is now saved in your settings.
Don't save it again.
Once again, if you're sinking your settings with here sink now, it will save that setting as well.
So you don't need to do this again.
So why did we do that?
Well, tilt her back.
We don't need that anymore.
We want to be out here.
Now, this has actually affected us personally.
I don't mind having to swipe around to see this.
You may prefer not to.
So, again, we can drag this out.
We don't necessarily need that much information to tell his numbers.
That's fine.
I wouldn't change.
I wouldn't move this line because your names may get longer or shorter.
And, yeah, that's okay.
In fact, you know what I'm going to do?
I'm actually going to move around this.
Can I move it around?
In fact, that I have needs going to here.
Let's Tilde again and I want the video info straight ahead right up close.
That's where I want it.
And then I want my frame rate.
That's where I want for my personal preferences.
I'm quite happy with that size.
We can move along if we want to see the duration, but yeah, I'm fine with that.
What am I going to do?
I'm going to right click and I'm going to say changes to this workspace.
That's another baked in thing that I want.
So to finish off this bit about frame rates, they know we've gone a little bit to one side to explain
other things within the whole ecosystem that is Premiere Pro.
But I like to show things as and when they come up I think that's important.
Let's Tilde and just we've got a little bit more space and I just want to talk to you finally about
this frame rate because if you're in America, if you're in any parts of the US, if you're in parts
of Canada, anywhere else that has the PAL system, in fact, let me just bring that back up again.
It wasn't the till the key.
Let's go back to here.
Anyway, here, anywhere over the green is anywhere where the NTSC is.
There's a good chance that rather than having 100 frames per second, you may have 120 frames a second.
Now, that's not to say that you can't have 25 frames per second or 60 frames per second.
But remember when I showed you before what we did with that footage and we slowed it down?
That will become very clear soon once we start working in the sequences.
Why this?
Hundred frames per second is important.
But if you're in the NTSC areas, you may have 120 frames per second and that's because of the multiplication
of the numbers.
What do I mean?
Well, 25 goes into this.
Four times.
What was the other number?
29.97.
It's also known as throw drop frame.
That's what it was known as in the industry.
Because I can see here FBS went from 30 to 29.97.
The reason why it's dropped frame is because it drops three frames every second.
So every minute it dropped a full frame.
That's just to explain that it you don't even need to understand that it's just literally the reason
why.
So if we take 25 and multiply it by four, like what I just said, let's get a calculator.
25?
No, not 28.
25 multiplied by four is 100.
If we take 29.97 and actually work at 30, let's go 30.
Multiply by you had the amount you four is 120.
So it's the divisions and the multiplications of the base frame rate.
And those frame rates are stipulated and dictated because of the hurts of the electrics around you.
That making sense.
This is a really good time to get a coffee, a drink, have a lay down, maybe.
I know we've done nothing yet with the video, but I promise you, with our learning and your continued
learning throughout your whole journey of video, understanding why frame rates will be different frame
rates, depending on where you are, is so crucial to your knowledge.
Next up, we're really going to start playing with the bends and understanding what we're going to be
doing within this area to then get into this area and the fun stuff.
I promise you it won't be too much longer.


### 3. Best Practice for Managing Footage

Moving on, it's now time to look at the best practice for managing your footage.
Now, if you remember just a couple of chapters ago, what we did is we placed all these videos into
a folder and dragged in the folder.
We're just going to develop on that idea a little bit.
And this is, again, something that you're going to need to do in your system.
But once it's done, you can use this for every single project you do.
And that is a folder template.
Now, what do I mean by a folder template?
Well, in my assets folder within my computer, I have a folder template which I have actually saved
as Z fold the template that means that it's always at the bottom Z because I'm in alphabetical order.
If I double click into here, this is my folder template.
And although there are six folders right here, there's nothing in them other than other folders.
Why?
Okay, so let me just look at this.
If we grab that and drag it into here, just like we did with the videos.
Watch what happens.
Nothing.
Why is that?
Because these are empty other than of the folders.
And what Premier Pro won't do is it won't drag in or it won't import a folder that has nothing in it.
And obviously within a folder, if it's just another empty folder, it won't drag anything.
It won't import anything in that doesn't contain some form of media.
So if that's the case, what's the point in making all these?
Because in my experience through my YouTube channel and later in my professional experience, I've been
running my YouTube channel now for about, oh, about eight years, seven or eight years.
Not too sure, but I've also been working professionally for the best part of that time, really.
I was playing around in Premiere Pro before I even started playing on YouTube, and it was the combination
of my playing on with video that made me open YouTube.
I'm saying all this because this is stuff that I've developed over time, and I really think little,
little bits like this will really help your workflow.
So what we have here, we have a series of empty folders with subfolders inside all of this inside the
folder template.
So what I do is I create all these.
So first it's animations which again is empty.
But in here, if I ever have an after after effects project that I'm working on within a project, it
will be saved in here in audio.
There's two types of audio that I use.
You could actually add SFX in here as well.
That's a nice little addition for me, so I will use that as well because quite often we add sound effects
to almost paint with with audio.
I'll cover that a little bit later on.
So in here we have music, SFX and spoken.
So obviously music will be any kind of music that we use in the project as effects will be sound effects
and spoken will be anything spoken in there, whether it be one person, two people or anything.
Now, if, if the audio in the video is the audio the using if it was recorded within the video file,
this will be empty.
But if the audio is coming from external sources, that would go into here moving down, we have images.
I use images all the time in my projects and this is something that I quite often add in here later
on and that's because the images are created within Premiere Pro.
I was thinking about sending some images for you to use.
However you're going to create in this course, you're going to create the images that you actually
then use more more of that when it comes up renders will be the final renders are in fact, this is
something I've meant to do for ages and that is to actually add Z to the end there as well because I
want renders right at the end renders are the exports from your videos when you when when you make anything
in in Lightroom or Lightroom Classic or Photoshop, what you're doing is you're exporting and they're
typically known as as image exports or image renders in video.
Again, we export the footage if you go to file and I never I always use a shortcut will be covering
shortcuts in you export and you export the media.
However, in the industry they're known as renders because you've rendered it out.
Imagine if you put loads of stuff into a stockpot and you're rendering all that down and the heat and
simmering to bake in all that goodness.
That's what this is doing.
You're rendering all the elements within the timeline to create the video.
So that's where all my renders go.
Script if there's any script for the video, I script pretty much all of my YouTube videos.
So that goes in there.
If I'm doing a corporate piece of work, the script will go in there along with any kind of work, document
and video.
I've broken this up into two main that I use and that is B-roll and to come to Cam is also known as
a role, but I don't really call it a role.
In fact, I don't know anyone who do does call it a role.
I don't know what they call it, but B-roll is everything.
B-roll is anything that isn't spoken in and to Cam or a role is a talking head, anyone talking in an
actual frame.
So those are my two.
I could deep down and put A73 and A6400.
Those are my two main cameras at the moment.
Depending on how quickly I change or how quickly more cameras come out that may date this course but
also B-roll, I could have that with the two cameras as well.
So there's my folder template and all I do is when I'm starting a new project, I will go into my folder
template, select them all control and C to copy and then I will go over to where I'm looking to build.
This would actually be done obviously before.
What we've already done, but I would just copy in to here.
I'm going to remove this because of the we already have footage in and if I move that into here, it
will get lost.
In fact, you know what, let's do that because this may a common maybe a common problem that you come
up with.
So that footage in here, let's find it.
If I right click any of them and go to reveal an explorer that will show me where that footage is saved.
And it's actually within the footage videos portion inside here.
But we've now added these folders and I want to move this into here.
Let's see what it does to Premiere Pro.
So let's go into here videos.
This is all B-roll.
So I'm going to select all of that and control an X to move out of C.
You don't need to do this if you don't want to.
I just want to highlight something that I come across quite a lot.
We're going to video and place where it should be, which is the B-roll control and B So I've cut and
pasted it.
I've moved that now and if I now coming to here, this can't find it.
It can't find the footage.
In fact it can because what Adobe has done, did you see where it came up here locating media.
All it's done is it's found where it is because it's within the same nest, within the same folder nest.
That's changed in Premiere Pro because it used to be an absolute nightmare.
Now if I'd moved it out, it would have been a different, different story.
Let me just check that that's empty.
Let me get rid of that and I'll show you what it would have done in the past or what it would do to
you if you move it to somewhere completely different.
And what it would do is let me offline that media remain on disk.
You don't need to do that, but it can't find it and it just wouldn't show anything and see how it just
it won't let me show anything.
So what you do is you find one of the pieces, let's, let's just do one and let's show you what it
then does because it uses what it did before to refine the stuff that had been moved.
I'm only going to find this pizza of a new one and it will find the rest of it for me.
I'm confident of that right click.
And what you want to do is you want to link media.
This may happen to you.
It may happen when we're in here and you close down the project, open it up again.
Maybe it's on an external hard drive.
And then when you put that external hard drive back in, it's giving it a different letter and everything
goes crazy.
So what you'll do is you right click and you go to link media.
It may give you the when you first open, it may actually you already come up with there saying, we
can't find these files.
Can you locate it?
So what I've done is I'm going to highlight that one.
If there's if there's more, they'll be all listed down here.
But you don't always have to find them all.
You only have to find a few and then a little tick button comes here.
So we got to locate and we're looking to find it now.
And here it is.
It's already taken me to where it thinks it's going to be, which is actually in premiere pro video
below it's actually found it there and is piece of in one now all of these are unlinked at the moment
if I press okay highlight on one reminding it we're looking for the last path was video B roll their
path that I'm saying is video B roll.
Highlight that press.
Okay and there it is.
It's found everything it's very clever has premiere pro so clever.
So yeah that's what I would do.
I would create a full hierarchy of folders and you bring everything in before you even start your project.
So everything is with you and then you just drag everything in.
The one folder that wouldn't be here at the start is this remember the auto sales were mentioning before,
how did we say they could save?
I think it was 20.
If we double click into here, we actually only have two auto save projects right now and we have a
clone, a copy of this, which is our project file.
It's great to have you auto saved right next to there.
It's oh, you have no idea how many times AutoSave has saved me.
So once we've got our footage into here, what I want to do is I want to show you what I mentioned in
the previous section, and that was something that happened that we need to change.
And that is when we're here in our project window and we have the video.
What is this, a bin?
Remember, it's not a folder, it's a bin.
Even though it shows our wish, it showed a bin.
I'd be great.
But when we want to get into here, we do just like in Finder on a mac or in Windows Explorer, we double
click, but what it's done is it's opened another tap.
So there's the tab we were in double click to open the end of the tab.
Now personally, I hate that because let's say there's a new bin here and I double click that it opens
again.
Ben, Ben, I haven't named it.
And before long you've got loads of stuff just going all the way along here.
And that's not what we want.
We're trying to make this a clean space so we can change that in preferences.
I'm going to close that panel, close that password back here.
If you go to edit preferences and General, what we want to do is we want to change.
Everything that we're changing comes with default.
There are so many things that are default which are great in Premiere Pro, there are certain things
that have hampered my workflow and have had to change since starting to use Premiere Pro and that's
when I want to help you with just to get that little bit further ahead at your starting point.
So this is what we want to effect.
Ben's double click what does double click, double click, double click do.
It currently defaults as open you tap.
If you hold down control and double click, it opens in place.
So it just opens in here like the hierarchy in Windows Explorer or Finder.
I have no idea why anyone would want to open a new tab when you can do the few things in here that I'll
show you which you can deep dive without leaving anywhere.
You don't need a second and third and fourth.
Ben Open all the way along here, especially how we have this set.
If you had multiple monitors, that might be okay for you.
I still think it's taken up screen real estate.
We still think it's taken up screen real estate that you don't need it to.
So if we drop this down and we want to open in place, that's what we're changing for now.
And press.
Okay.
What do we do next?
That's right.
Right click save, change this workspace.
That's all we want to do.
I'm not entirely certain that changing the workspace would change that, but it's good to have.
Don't forget also down here.
Sync settings now is always good.
Some people think their settings once a day.
Some people do it once a week.
I do it once a week.
It's only part of my Friday afternoon maintenance.
I just think the settings, just in case anything has changed, whether I can remember anything changing
or not.
So now with this pane, when we double click, we open in place.
You see, nothing extra was built here.
We don't need it.
And there's our bin again.
And then again we're still in here.
We're not going all the way along here.
It can get really messy or really quick.
Can we just delete that?
Ben Don't forget also in this list view, that's what I was just referring to before, where you can
easily deep dive everywhere.
If there was more folders here, you could deep dive all the way down here without ever having to open
another Ben or another another example of the Ben.
And don't forget, you can tilde to look at everything that's remembered.
Everything there.
We didn't want that before.
Did we save our settings before?
Maybe we didn't.
Let's get rid of these again.
There we go.
Much better.
Okay.
So well, I want to touch on now is color coding and that is affecting the color in which these videos
will look or the clips will look when they're on your timeline.
And that is as simple as highlighting the kind of video you want.
Remember, if you are using this whole breakdown and you're in B-roll and to Cam, you could say that
was B-roll and that was to Cam, you could 12 down B-roll and say, right, okay, all these videos,
I want them a certain color, etc., etc. and you just right click select the ones you want to change,
right click and go to label and say which color you want them to be.
You can change the names of these as well in preferences.
If you go to edit preferences and labels, you could actually change what these colors say they are.
So Caribbean is just like it's not green because we already have green at the bottom.
So we say maybe light green because a cerulean, I don't know.
So I'm probably not even saying that.
Right, but I'd say that it's actually sky blue.
And if we thought, okay, and we go back here and we got a label, we now have sky blue rather than
cerulean and like green instead of Caribbean.
Just so you've got a better indication of what it would be.
What I would love to see is that Adobe put the actual color to the side as well.
To give you an idea, I'm not going to change these clothes right now because I don't want to look different
in here for when you're working on your project.


### 4. Proxies

Most modern day machines don't struggle at all to edit 1080 video.
However, some older machines could struggle to playback footage filmed in 1080.
Similarly, most standard PCs laptops would struggle to edit 4K footage.
However, none of that really matters if you're using proxies.
If you find throughout this course or in your future editing that certain file types, certain file
sizes of video make your machine struggle.
That playback is stuttery or it just doesn't run as smooth as you'd like it to.
This is when we can create proxies.
What proxies do is they replace the footage that you're editing with a smaller file size so you can
work with it.
Then at the end of the editing process, you switch it back to the full size and then render out that
full resolution large clip.
Remember what I said about what rendering is?
That's when we finished our whole sequence, our whole edit, and we're exporting that final rendered
video.
So let's say that these videos here, these clips, your machine is struggling to play them back.
How do we make these smaller so we can work with them?
Well, it's quite simple.
Select them all either by the marquee tool or if it's just the odd one.
Click.
If you need to select multiple ones, you can hold down control and click say it's one, four and seven.
That's how you would select multiple clips within the same bin.
But for this exercise, we're going to select all of these.
So let's create the proxy that you're going to be working with.
Select all the clips right click and navigate down to proxy.
What you want to do here is create proxies.
If you already had proxies made and it wasn't reading from them.
That's when you would attach proxies.
But first off, we're going to create the proxy.
So if you click this and now it's going to set a template to be able to export out what we need to create
these proxies.
So first, the source is what the source is.
That's always going to be that format 8.264.
This is a simple amp for format.
It's nice and small if you wanted to size it down even further.
We could go to QuickTime.
In fact, QuickTime is probably the easiest way to make a smaller file as possible while still be able
to read it within your nle.
The non-linear editor, which is what Premiere Pro is.
However, you will need a QuickTime plugin if you're working on a PC.
So just to cover everybody, we're going to stay on a 8.26 for Codec.
MP four to drop down.
We're just going to leave it at what it comes up with.
Low resolution proxy.
That's fine for us.
Destination.
We don't need to add an ingest preset.
No need for that.
There are certain presets that you can get online, but I find that this default set up works perfectly
to be able to get a file to a size that works well enough on a low power PC.
Under destination, we can select either next to original media in a proxy folder or on a separate folder.
This is where I have a scratch files where we're looking at before here.
I think it's absolutely perfect to put it right next to the original media in a proxy folder.
I'm going to bring over the other window right now and show you exactly where that will default.
It doesn't I don't have to tell it where to go because it knows where the original footage is.
So what it's actually going to do, it's going to put it remember, we moved everything into this B-roll
folder.
It's going to actually create a folder within B-roll which says proxy or proxies.
PRESS Okay.
And it's now going to create all the proxy jobs.
Now, not only does it do that, but what it also does is it opens them immediately in and coda.
Remember the second program that I told you that we downloaded along with Premiere Pro?
It's automatically opened it and automatically encoding them.
RE Encoding them as proxies.
It doesn't do it within premiere pro, it offloads all the work.
And in that short space of time, we now have all of those videos all created with proxies.
And if we toggle over, that's where it is.
So if you come back out again, it's in the video folder on the B-roll, which is where we put it,
and then it's created a proxies folder and place them all in there.
Now let's just see the file size of the first one to have made these quite small.
So to make it easy for you to download and to easy for us to deliver it to you.
But it was originally 8.21 megabytes.
In all honesty, I won't be surprised if it's actually made them even bigger.
It has 12.4 megabytes.
You see, the footage that I've supplied you is as good as it can be with how compressed it could be
to get it to you.
But even the low resolution setting has made the proxies even bigger than the originals.
That's not normally the case, especially when you're using 4K footage.
It can really the 4K footage, 10 minutes of 4K footage can easily be three, four, five gigabytes
worth of data.
So that's how you do your proxies.
So automatically that file is linked with that file pizza oven one append proxy.
So how do we know what's being used when we're in the timeline?
Granted, we're not in the timeline yet, but that's where this little row of buttons comes in.
Remember, we're actually addressing certain things when we can as we come along them.
This is when we need to look at this button set up.
And I'm going to briefly show you now and then on the next section, we're going to take a deep dive
into this area here because there are so many things you can add to here which are really useful and
so many things that are already in here by default that you really don't need.
So there is nothing here with regards to your proxies.
What we need to do is we need to press this button here, which actually says, I don't think you can
see it because it's off my screen.
But it says Button Editor, if you single click that, you now have a load of buttons that you can drop
down into here.
In here is also all of the buttons that are down here as well, plus loads of others, including this
one, which is to toggle proxies.
We're going to drag that down to here and let go.
That's now placed it within this area of buttons and they press okay and that's saved.
It's grayed out now because there's nothing in the timeline.
But right here is how we're going to toggle the proxies on and off.
That's what we're going to do next.
Play with this area right here.


### 5. Program Monitor Button Layout

Now, this is quite a specialist section within this course.
I don't know any course out there that covers this section.
And I don't know why, because this area is pretty.
It's as effective, if not just a little bit less effective than keyboard shortcuts.
This can really help your workflow and setting up this area, which is the area of buttons underneath
the program monitor.
Setting this up right can really help your workflow.
And there are so many things in here that we don't really need.
And it may be a bit of a surprise, this button here.
What does that mean?
Yeah, it means play.
I've never clicked on that button.
But I've edited hundreds, if not more, videos.
That's because play is the spacebar.
You never use your mouse to click to play.
Similarly, stepping back a frame and stepping forward a frame that's just left and right on your keyboard
and your hand.
One hand will always be on your keyboard and one hand will always be on your mouse.
And you don't need to be reaching up here to grab things that you don't need to.
Toggling proxies is not something that you will do 100 times in an edit.
So that's fine to be there.
Pressing play you will be doing hundreds of times depending on the size of edit going back and forth
the same.
So you don't need to be coming up here to be clicking so many times as we go through this course, will
also be playing with these bits up here.
And this changes what your cursor does.
And so many courses, so many tutorials tell you to come up here and click on the res at all to cut.
And it's that travel and that means absolutely nothing right now.
But if you're down here in an edit and you're having to reach up here every time you need to cut a second,
even if it's a second round trip to go up a click and come back down, you add that second to every
single cut and that all of a sudden will add so much time onto your edit.
Just like we've done pretty much with everything up to now, everything is setting you up to have a
more efficient workflow.
So let's get this area exactly what you need and nothing more.
So you saw in the previous chapter, we clicked on this plus button and we drag down toggle proxies
down to here at marker.
It even tells you the next one at marker.
It tells you that the shortcut is m well, we don't need that here then, do we?
So let's drag that and put it back up in there.
Here.
Set in.
Mark N won't make any sense to you now, but the shortcut is I mark out.
The shortcut is, oh, we don't need them.
They're on our keyboard.
This is a space.
This creates a space in between these you see how there's a little bit of an extra space right there.
Great.
I need that.
I keep that space and we space it out nicely.
Let's get back to the editor here.
Go to in, which is shift.
I don't need that.
I've never had to say for it to go to where the endpoint is.
I just go to it.
It's it's, it's much easier than reaching up here and clicking a button.
We don't need that.
We don't need that.
We don't need that.
It's almost like a spring clean.
My wife would be very proud of me.
And here, lift, extract.
I've never used those in my life.
You don't need those.
Take that.
Yeah.
This is taking a snapshot.
This is exporting a frame.
I have a keyboard shortcut for this, but I'm going to leave this here just for now, because I want
to show you later on down the line what this can do.
It's really helpful what we are going to bring down today.
We're going to bring down effects.
What that does, it toggles on and off the effects.
If you've got a slower computer, this is really helpful to be able to be able to time up things without
taking everything else into consideration.
That's really handy.
Let's bring a little space.
This is the space.
See these down here?
There's a space after the effects.
See how it's just dragging down and dropping what else we want?
I want this, which is the safe margins.
That's really handy.
So where are you going?
Put that there.
Come on now.
Put it there.
Thank you.
Know, there's in the space.
This isn't the most intuitive design by Adobe.
They could do with cleaning this up a little bit.
Let's just leave it there for now.
Rulers, we are say guides.
We need this.
This is brand new in probably the last year, maybe a year and a half, and it comes directly from Photoshop
and this makes so many.
It's so handy.
Bring that down.
We'll use that rulers as well.
We'll use that.
So is there anything else we may need?
We do not need to toggle VR video display.
If you're looking to get into VR video display, this course is not going to get you to do that.
Revert to trim session.
Don't need that.
We don't need anything else.
Not that I can see in here.
So that's it.
How different does that look?
We don't need all of the stuff that you just you just don't use.
So right now, we have safe margins rulers.
Guides.
Tackling your proxies affects global meat export frame and comparison queue.
Comparison view is really handy when we're playing with color grading.
I'll show you what that does.
This also is an update that's coming in the last 18 months, maybe two years.
I don't use it too much.
However, it's a really handy tool, but I'll show you how to use a little bit later on.
So we now, at the end of our importing media area, we're nearly there.
I know this is a lot of information.
I know that we've been doing a lot of things effectively, blindly, because I'm showing you to change
things, but we're not actually doing anything.
Follow me and just I need your faith with this that I'm setting you up for when we're down here and
we're really deep diving into stuff, you already have the knowledge which we're going to be drawing
on, so it saves you in the long run.
Do you trust me?
I hope you do by now.
So next up, we have interpreting media.
It's just that section.
And then we're going to be bringing the video down.
And it's a short section.
It's not too long, but it's the last bits of real information that you need to know to to to lay this
good foundation.
Everything that you've learnt up to now would take, I'd say, to really get your head around it.
It would be at least a good five or six classes to get to the knowledge that you're right now.
And yet you may feel that you don't know anything, but you really do you understand about changing
these workspaces?
What is the one thing that I need to do right now because I've changed this.
Exactly.
You know, that, you know, to save this workspace, you know, that we've played around with this.
And actually by looking at it, you know that this is an overflow.
Remember the overflow up here?
This is an overflow.
So what else is in here?
We've got the source effects controls and audio mixer.
So why is it an overflow?
That's why it just wasn't big enough.
It's these little things that you will be recognizing as we go around.
Just imagine how much more familiar this area now looks to you compared to when we first started.
Even your I can tell you that there are so many workspaces here that we don't need you wouldn't you
didn't know that before you started this course.
Why am I saying all this?
Because I need you to recognize that you know so much already before you've really done anything.
And that knowledge, that knowledge of in this product, just being in this program will help you going
forward.
One more thing that always goes to the right.
I'm not typically OCD in my life, but little things within Premiere Pro and all the other ones in After
Effects.
I'm terrible.
It has to be the layout that I have.
As I said before earlier, I have a 34 inch ultrawide display.
So actually I'm moving my myself and you can't see it.
But I have probably about that much further over to here and I also have another monitor off to the
right.
Working in here is so alien to me and yet I know that so many of you are using a screen this size.
So this is where we're working at.
But if you get a different size display, if you get a different aspect ratio display, if you get a
second display, that's when you can really play as well and move things off.
You see, you see say in colors.
I'll just take this moment here in color.
This is the metric color.
You have scopes over here which we will look into.
Yeah.
Sometimes you saw how that was, was, was off a little.
Sometimes you just need to toggle back and forth just to refresh your, you know, your whole window
really.
It's, it's quite annoying, but it's a, it's an adobe thing.
But I have my limit, my scopes.
These don't live here in my big wide display that gets dragged off and I drag it all the way off onto
a second monitor and it's huge.
But what the point I want to make is that you already know so much about this program.
More, in my opinion.
And this isn't this this is it sounds a little bit like, oh, look at me.
But in my opinion, I've given you the best foundation that I've ever seen in a course.
Because so many courses.
That I've done, that I've looked through, that I've even purchased myself over the past ten years
because you're always learning in this program and all of these programs.
But none of the programs, none of the courses that I've watched and sat through have ever given me
the the combination of the foundations of this that I've given you.
You may be so bored.
You may want to know more without doing anything highly unlikely.
But I promise you, I've given you the best foundation I can to start you on your journey.
Next up were interpreting media, which is looking at the frame rates.
I know we're back to that, but the frame rates and how that will affect in your sequence.
It's not long.
It's not too long to go.
And we'll be there, I promise.
Keep the faith.
We will get there.
If you fancy, I would go back and maybe look at a few of the chapters that possibly you don't really
remember.
If you looking on the list now and you think, oh, do I remember what was in that chapter?
Just go back and have a quick read, a quick watch through, maybe even skim through the video and just
make sure you understand everything that I've said.
Don't forget, you can always go back.
You can watch this as many times as you want.
You can always go back.
And there will be times as we go through this.
Now, from this point where I'll say, remember, we touched on that in chapter two or in chapter three,
and I'll do my best not to reteach what I've already taught.
So if you get lost at any point, go back and have a look at that.
If you don't quite remember and I lose you a little bit.
Yeah, go back and watch chapter two again, chapter three again, wherever that is.
And then come back.
Don't ever be worried of re learning.
Only a fool would not try and recap that learning.
We're nearly there.
Just keep the faith.

## 5 Interpreting Media
### 1. Understanding High Frame Rates

Understanding high frame rates.
So depending on the footage that you're going to be playing with and editing in the future, this may
or may not affect you to a certain level.
If you remember, we've brought enough seven videos and we have it in a bin right here labeled videos.
If we double click into there.
As you can see, we're in icon mode right now.
It doesn't give us much information.
If we hover over, it will bring up some information.
However, if we go to the list view, remember we have the information that we have selected that we
want.
We currently have frame rate and video duration.
The information that we're looking at right now is this part, the frame rate.
Everything here under the pizza oven, one through to seven is a hundred frames per second.
That's important because when we go to the next chapter and we are setting our sequence because our
sequence will be set at 25 frames per second a quarter of this.
The reason why this is important is because Adobe Premiere Pro is very clever at working with videos
of differing frame rates.
This matters or doesn't matter as much or as little as you want.
I'm just going to drag in another piece of footage.
You won't have this.
This is just a random piece of footage that I have created.
This is another video that I have made in my YouTube channel.
I'm not using any of my client work in this tutorial purely because it was a paying client and it's
not really right to use their footage.
However, this piece of footage is from a review for a lens.
I did.
And as you can see straight on right there, it's 25 frames per second.
The only other difference is, rather than all the videos that you have, which is 1920, by 1080,
which is HD, I have 3840 by 2160, which is 4K.
This, when dragged into a 25 frames per second timeline, will play at 25 frames per second in real
time.
This, when dragged into at 25 frames per second timeline, will still play in real time.
And that's what we're looking at right now, because the higher the frame rate, the more you can actually
do with the footage.


### 2. Converting Frame Rates for Best Use

Let me get rid of this piece of video right now because we don't need that now.
But I'm just going to quickly double click and that opens in the source monitor.
That's not the program monitor.
This is the monitor where we use to view or edit.
This is to just preview our footage and if we play this back.
It plays back at real time.
Those are pellets going into the pizza oven ready to fire up.
Now, as you can see, they're all played in real time.
No problem.
But let's do something to effect this, because we can slow this down once we start editing, because
there's a hundred frames per second there.
If we're at 25 frames per second in the timeline, you can actually slow that down by four times without
any loss in quality.
You can actually slow it down a little bit further without that much loss in quality.
And we will cover that later in this tutorial.
But let's just see what we can do with this, because this is a this is a parts in premiere pro that
not many videographers, not many edit editors use.
And I think this saves a lot of work further down the line.
Now, that's pretty much everything that we've done so far.
So let's stay with that vein.
I'm going to I've got that clicked.
I'm holding down shift and clicking the end just like if I control and and selected everything.
And what we're going to do is we're going to right click and we're going to modify this footage.
And the way in which we're going to modify is we're going to interpret the footage.
Now, remember, it's a hundred frames a second right here.
This gives us the option in the interpret footage panel.
We're not touching anything else we're saying here.
Use frame rate from file a hundred frames a second.
Now that says default with anything that you put in, it assumes that you want to use the frame rate
that it was recorded at.
However, what we're going to do here is we're going to assume this frame rate and rather than one which
is going to type in 25, there's not much times or instances in Premiere Pro where you need to type
things in.
This is one of those times.
So 25 frames per second is selected and we're going to press.
Okay.
And watch here when I press.
Okay, this is now 25 frames per second footage, but nothing's changed.
But it really has because this footage right now, those eagle eyed among you may see that this little
handle went from here all the way to here.
That's because.
We have a lot more footage to play with.
Remember how it just played back?
Nice and smooth and well, real time.
If we press the spacebar now again, we have a play button here.
I don't want to play around with this because there's not really much that you can do in here.
But if we press the spacebar right now and playback.
We're actually playing back now at a quarter of the speed and because it was recorded at 100 frames
a second and then slowed down.
We keep all that information and all that quality.
That's why I filmed this at 100 frames per second, because what I wanted to do was to be able to edit
the B-roll over my review, to have it really nice and cinematic.
And it's a really overused term in the industry.
But yeah, nice, cinematic, lovely feel.
Now as you can hear, the audio has slowed down too.
It's not really anything you can do about that other than maybe on linking the audio in the edit and
speeding it up, but that really wouldn't match up.
Most B-roll is used without any audio and there's music underneath to cover that and to make up the
whole design of the video in itself.
So that's what we've done here with the frame rates we have.
You could quite easily had footage in here that was shot at 60 frames a second or 120 frames a second.
Now, if this was shot in an NTSC, remember what we're talking about before.
If this was shot in an NTSC area such as the United States of America, Canada, we looked at Burma
before Japan.
This possibly would have originally been 120 frames a second because we would have been shooting at
30 frames standard or 29.9 730 frame, drop, throw, drop frame.
You remember that.
If not, take a little look back to the previous chapter that was under the section four point to understanding
frame rates PAL versus NTSC.
So that's your frame rates and that's how to convert your frame rates into what you want to use.
Now, this isn't necessarily totally necessary because it can always be done in the edit, but I like
to start my project in the right frame rate because when we're going through the source monitor, we
can set out in and out points right here to bring in just the footage that we need, but that is getting
ahead of ourself.
We're here.
We've done everything that we need to do within the program to get ourselves ready to edit, guess what
we're doing next.
We're going to create a sequence and start playing with this footage.
You've made it, you've done your learning, you've set the foundation.
Now it's time to play with the video.
Congratulations.

## 6 Working with Sequences
### 1. Creating a Sequence

Okay, then, you crazy cats, you've waited long enough.
We're now going to start creating a sequence.
And as you can see here, drop a media to create a sequence that this is where your sequences are going
to be and this is the media.
Well, it's quite simple.
Then you just grab a video and drag it in and create a sequence, don't you?
Not quite.
And there are a couple of reasons why I've just drag that in there.
Let's just go to sequence and check sequence settings.
So the sequence settings here say it's 1920 by 1080.
That's the output that we want to do.
In all honesty, all of my videos on YouTube are just a couple are all still 1920 by 1080 HD.
There are some creators that are uploading in 4K.
It's great that we can shoot in 4K.
I still don't think we're there yet to deliver in 4K.
However, if you dropped a 4K piece of footage in here and dropped it into here, it would have set
the sequence to 4K.
There's a reason why I don't do that, and there's a couple of things in here that I want to set from
the get go, which is why we don't just drag and drop also labels or names, the sequence, the name
of the actual file that we first drag in.
And you can also see something else that's changed here.
I'm just going to Tilde remember that.
So we can see everything in here.
Don't think this size.
It's to size up a little bit so we can see.
So on here you can see one icon which is different from the others.
Now, we'll take a quick look at these.
This has two icons within the icon.
There's a little filmstrip icon there and there's a soundwave icon there.
That means that it's a video file with audio.
Thanks and simple.
What this means is it means it's a sequence.
So as you can see, there's actually two names there, pizza m one and pizza oven one.
But if we drag this out a little bit, it's pizza oven one, MP four.
So that's confirming this icon that it's a video, this has nothing after it, which means it's a sequence
because that's what we built the sequence from just going to Tilde again to close this or minimize it,
at least bring down that size as well.
And what we're going to do is we're going to undo Control and Z.
And that was dragging that on, going to control and Z again to get rid of the sequence that it created.
Because there is another way to do this and a better way, again, setting yourself up for success.
And that is we're going to come all the way out.
So we're in the root of the project, not with in a folder or a bin.
And what we do is we're going to create another bin.
There are a couple of ways to do this.
You can, wherever you are in the project folder, you can go to file new and bin or you can see the
shortcut control and B, I've never used that.
Or you can just right click in an empty space here and click New Bin.
That's the way I do it.
So that's where I'm going to do it.
And what it does is it opens up a new bin, it creates a new bin, and it already has the title there
to edit.
We're going to name this bin sequences.
We do that because depending on what bin you're in, when you create a sequence, it will place the
sequence inside that bin.
Let's just try that.
I'm going to just go controlling and it's going to get a little red and create a sequence and it places
the sequence in here.
Now, you can't see where it is.
And I promise you, sequences are the things you really need to be able to keep track of.
If you can't find your sequence, you've created it somewhere accidentally.
You will do this and you can't find it.
The easiest way to find is to come all the way to the root of your project folder and click in the search
bar and just simply type s, e, q and all the way through.
Regardless of how many bins you have here, remember, bins are folders, regardless of how many bins
you have here.
It will show all of the sequences.
The reason why we're also not just dragging in to here is because I want to be able to label the sequence
what it is.
So let's control and Z, let's play off that search first, controlling that number of times and let's
create that bin again.
So right click New Bin and we're going to title this sequences and hit enter.
I hit the I type the enter all the way over to the right of my keyboard where the number key is.
If you're entering, if you've put your title in here, you've reworded and you hit return, which is
the one just above the right hand shift.
It will go to the next item, whether it be a bin or a file, any kind of media to retitle that as well.
That's quite frustrating for me and I don't know why that's still the case in Premiere Pro.
If you do that, just click anywhere, either here or anywhere in Premiere Pro, even if you just titled
it, if you click out, it will then just accent that and action it.
So it's done that accent, action it.
So we now have two bins.
We have a bin with our footage in and we have an empty bin of sequences.
You see how when we double click it doesn't open and open and open, but you can 12 down these as well,
so you can keep everything in view if you prefer.
So with sequences created the bin, we're going to double click into there.
You see how that happens again, what we need to do is double click it when it's not been selected and
now we're in here, we're going to create a new sequence.
There are a number of ways to do this.
It's not a right click like you did with a new bin.
You can either go to file new and sequence or what I always do once I'm in the area, this area where
I want to create the sequence, I type control.
And and that brings up this, which is the new sequence taskbar.
And this is where we create our sequence for our timeline.
Now, as you can see under here, I already have a number of custom sequences built.
How did I do that?
Well, it's quite simple.
You only have to do this once for each type of sequence you want to create.
As you can see, I already have ten, 80, 25 maps.
All the details are here for what that means.
I have 4K YouTube White.
That is a 4K size.
It's 38, 40 by 21, 60, 25 frames a second still.
And it's a progressive scan, 48,000 hertz for the audio.
That's all.
Absolutely fine.
We don't really need to bother with that.
Five.
Four is not quite square, but it's a nice dimension for video on Instagram when you want it slightly
taller than square.
However, we do have square as well.
We also have Ultra HD, which actually isn't Ultra HD.
I made this wrong and I always meant to delete that.
So I'm actually going to like, Oh yeah, yeah.
So I highlight it and I'm going to delete that preset and then it refreshes.
This will refresh again once we make our preset.
And I also have vertical, which is instead of 1920, by 1080 it's 1080, by 1920.
So for vertical video stories in Facebook or Instagram.
So how do we make this?
It's really quite simple.
All you need to do is go to any of these.
We're going to we're going to make it easy and we're going to go to digital.
SLR doesn't really matter.
We're going to 12 down 1080, and we're going to select the 25 frames.
Now, this needs to be thought of if you're in an NTSC area.
This is for PAL.
So 25.
Frames a second is for people 24 frames per second.
We haven't mentioned that so far.
24 frames per second.
24 frames per second is considered more of a cinematic frame rate.
I don't use it personally.
And then we have 30 frames per second, which is effectively remember this 29.9, seven frames per second.
It says it's 30, but it's not.
It's 29.9, seven or 30 drop frame.
This is the only real thing that you'll change depending on where you are.
But again, it doesn't really matter that much anymore because of the world of the internet and everyone
watching the same thing in different parts of the world.
Again, this only really matters with the footage and where it was captured, where it was captured
at 50 hertz or 60 hertz, which will be clear in 25 frames per second or 29.97 or 30 frames a second
or multiplications of that.
So whether it's 25, you go to 50, 50, you go to 100 with 30, you go 30 to 60 and 60 to 120 frames
a second to members covering that.
I'm sure you do if you don't.
Chapter 55.1 was understanding frame rates and chapter 4.2 was POW versus NTSC.
If this has gone on, we had a little bit the first time, maybe take a little trip back and just refresh
your knowledge with regards to that.
So we're going to make a preset of 25 frames per second, 1080 that we've highlighted this.
We're then going to go to settings how we want 1920 by 1080.
That's absolutely fine.
All of this is absolutely fine.
What we want to do is we want to have maximum render quality.
Now, this all depends on your machine, whether it's whether it's got four gigabytes or eight gigabytes
of RAM or 16 gigabytes.
I have 64 gigabytes in my machine.
That's not showing off.
I'm a content creator and I run a media production business, so I need as much as I can get.
I'm actually considering upgrading to 128.
But anyway, that's that's by the by.
So the warning says setting the optimized rendering performance to memory is highly recommended when
max quality or max big depth rendering is on.
These settings are designed for high performance systems, which I have.
Please check Adobe Premiere Pro Support Center for Recommended System Requirements.
It's a really good document is the Pro Support Center for sending you to sleep.
However, it does have some good information, so if you're not quite sure with regards to your machine
and I could cover in here so many different eventualities, it's best you just doing the homework yourself
and finding exactly what the best setting is for you, for your machine.
I'm going to click okay and leave that.
However, my machine, I'm terrible.
I love to see everything as perfect as possible.
So you'll see in my workflow I actually slow myself down because I want to be able to watch back properly.
Well, we'll deal with that.
I will cover that.
When we get to that.
Everything else is absolutely fine.
We don't want to do this every single time just to check tracks.
This is a default, so your sequence will automatically open with three video tracks and three audio
tracks.
That's fine.
You can always add or delete.
You can add additional tracks or remove.
It doesn't really matter.
That's easily done within the sequence.
VR Video.
We are not working with VR video.
It blows my mind.
So all of this is done.
We're going to save the preset so we don't have to do this again and we're going to name this preset.
As you saw, I have saved mine as 1080 something 16 nine I'm not too sure, but I'm not going to say
that.
But you would put the name in that you want to save it and then you'd press okay.
When you press okay, what would happen is this would refresh and you would have custom down here.
I'm not quite sure if the custom is already there at the beginning, but it sure will be there once
you create a preset because it will be a custom preset.
Also, once you open a sequence with one of these wants, this will always be the default.
Then it opens up.
Don't run into the mistake that I've made a number of times and I normally create in ten 8025 apps.
But there's the time where I create a square sequence, and then when I've come back into here, even
if I've saved everything, closed out, started a brand new project and started a sequence.
I haven't even looked here.
I've just renamed and hit okay and realized, ah, it's still on square.
So this will remember the last sequence you made whenever that was, and it will already have it highlighted
and selected.
So make sure you select the one that you want which is ten 8025 apps that.
What I want to call this, and then we're going to name the sequence because if we don't, we just press,
okay, under in our sequences bin, we'll just have sequence zero two, not zero one.
Because remember, we already made the sequence before which we didn't use.
I used it two to illustrate, but we're going to highlight this and we're going to call this pizza oven.
Now, actually, I'm going to call this pizza oven sequence for two reasons.
One, we already have pizza oven, one, two, three, four and so on for the footage.
Also, I want to highlight when we get to the end of all this, what you do to render out and the name
of the save file.
Bear that in mind, it will be a while until we get to that, but this will come into effect, especially
when we get to that point.
Okay.
In fact, I'm going to say pizza oven sequence and I'm going to say 1080.
So that's going to tell me that it's in 1080, I could say 69 for those you don't quite yet understand
aspect ratio 69, the old style TVs were for three, so it was four across and three down.
It's just a ratio.
The 1080 by 19, 1920 by 1080 sorry is 69.
So that's 16 along to nine down.
It's the smallest fraction you can get and it's what widescreen TV is.
Now you also have more and more different aspect ratios.
One aspect ratio that you will know is one by one, which is square.
Obviously it's one along by one down that square.
That's the images and videos, particularly on Instagram.
But then we have four or five, so this should be four across by five down.
So it's almost square but a little bit taller.
Anyway, we're going to save this sequence as pizza of in sequence 1080 and press okay now because we
did control and end in this pen it's created this sequence in this bin and as we can see pizza oven
in sequence 1080 and here is our sequence ready to work in.
What are we going to do next?
Well, yeah, it is that time we're going to bring some footage into here, but via here.


### 2. Understanding Aspect Ratio & How It Applies to Video

Before we go any further, let's just take a moment to go through aspect ratios.
So aspect ratios are what we were talking about in the previous section, which are the ratios that
set the height and the width of a video.
This will also apply to image, but seen as though we're talking about a video editor, we're going
to discuss it, how it affects video.
And to do that, first off, I'm just going to go to create another sequence and just remember 1920
by 1080.
If you divide these numbers into each other, you will get the smallest fraction possible, which is
16 over nine.
Now, that may be harking back to your days in maths at school, and depending on how long ago that
was and how good you were at it, it may it may throw your mind into a bit of turmoil.
Don't worry, we're not going to be doing fractions.
What I want to do is I want to show you this graphic.
This perfectly illustrates what I'm talking about without the whole 1920, by 1080 or 1080, by 1920.
I personally don't know them off by heart.
And in all honesty, you don't really need to.
You can always find the dimensions with a quick web search.
So first off, 16 by nine, which is 19, 20 by 1080.
If you look at it on a mobile device, the coloured area here is what 16 by nine is.
However, you and I both know that if you rotate the phone that as long as you've got screen rotation
on, that will fill most of, if not all of the screen, depending on the dimensions of the screen.
Okay, good.
Moving on.
One by one, it may look bigger, but what we're actually looking at on a vertical phone is the width.
The width of the actual video will span the width of a vertical phone.
Everything else will then fall around it.
So on a vertical phone, one by one is like that when it's turned horizontal.
This is the only aspect ratio which will stay the same.
Pretty much four by five is what we were talking about before, which is four by five.
That's good for four.
As it says here, Instagram and Facebook feeds, Vertical Video.
There are two types of vertical well, you could say three types of vertical video because it's actually
all these 3 to 3 Facebook only.
I don't really use this.
Maybe that is a Facebook standard.
I don't use it, but you could always play around with it.
And 916, which is the inverse of 16 by nine, is that clear?
Good.
Now, let's just see a few of these in action.
If we go back to control and end to start a new sequence, and if we look at some of the presets that
I have already made, 4K 3840 by 2160, that will be 16 by nine because it's just four times these all
pretty much five four is 1080 by 1350 again the maths will lead to five.
Full square is 1080 by 1080.
So that's one by one.
The same length and vertical is the inverse of 1080 by 1920, by 1080, which is 1080 by 1920.
See these numbers as I switch between those two, they switch.
Okay.
So that is aspect ratio.
But the problem is, is that these numbers don't correspond or they do correspond, but they don't clearly
correspond at a glance to these, which is why it's so important that once you decide what aspect ratio
you want to build in, you get that maths, you get it made in a custom preset and then it's done for
you and it's done for you in perpetuity.
It's always there for you then.
So that is aspect ratios.
We will also play with a few of the of the aspect ratios later down the line because it's quite important
to be able to repurpose and edit for different circumstances.
If you've made a full video here, but you then want to make a highlight reel in square or maybe place
some of it in vertical video for a story that can now be done in Premiere Pro.
I say it can now be done.
It could always be done, but there's actually a much easier way to be able to do it these days because
of an update.
Like I said, these updates are always coming from Adobe because of the subscription service, and as
long as you continue your subscription, you will continue to get those updates in mind that if you
stop a subscription.
You stop your access to Adobe Premiere Pro and all of the other suite.
Anyway, that's getting out of ourselves and off on a slight tangent.
So that is aspect ratios.
We're now going to continue and we're going to work with in this 1920 by 1080, which is a 16 by nine
sequence.


### 3. Source Monitor (In & Out, Video Only)

So now we have our sequence ready for taking media video in this case.
I say media because media covers video, photo graphics and also audio, whether that be sound effects,
spoken audio or music.
So just to quickly recap here, we have our sequence in our project bin, which is inside a bin labeled
sequences.
And we have a timeline now created right here ready to take media.
Here we have our videos.
If we toggle between the list view and the icon view, we can see that all the videos are here.
Now, if we look carefully at this, I'm just going to Tilde so you can see this better.
I'm going to size up this footage.
And if we look very briefly, you can see when the mouse is nowhere near any of these, we get just
a representation of the video, one frame from the video.
But if we put our mouse over the video, if you look at the very bottom right down here, you can see
that there's a blue line and then there's a gap that moves along like a cursor.
And as we scrub along.
This is called scrubbing.
You can see that it actually plays through the video.
This is a really handy tool if you've got a lot of footage or a really long video that you're looking
to use.
This is a really handy way of finding where in the footage you want.
So you don't want any of this.
You just want to get it just as he starts to pull out the pellets that's there.
So, you know, by sight, it's about a third into the video.
You see how this works with all of the video clips even inside here all the way around.
It's a really good way to have a quick check if you've got loads of different clips that are similar
of the same thing, kind of like this.
I'm thinking, I want to see when the pizza is put in and it's closed.
Okay, well, that's the pizza coming out.
That's not right.
Pizza.
Okay, hold on.
She's opening.
That's my wife, Emma's hand opening there.
And arcade, there's the pizza going in and you can see exactly where that is.
Now, if we take it a step further, if I tell that out, we want to first get this into our source
monitor.
You don't have to toggle over to it.
There's a quick way to get it into your source monitor, which is double click.
But you can also.
Just drag that into your source monitor.
Now, this is the source monitor.
This is the program monitor.
The source monitor is a it's a supporting video monitor or actual monitor media because images can come
in here as well to support the main output of your video.
And in here, this is such a great part of Premiere Pro, because remember how we're scrubbing through
here.
We can scrub through here.
Did you see how the play had actually started here?
It wasn't right at the beginning.
That's because when we double clicked it, let's just close this fan out.
Get that out of there.
Not close.
All because that would close all of the taps.
But if we did that, it won't let us do it now.
But if we go into that and then we close all that on the closes in there.
But let's to just do a quick recap.
If I close panel, what do I do?
I could go to window and bring back the source monitor here.
But I could also.
That's right.
Right.
Click and reset to save layout.
Brilliant.
When we save the layout the first time it had the audio track mixed up, which is why that then defaults
back.
No biggie.
We're back to the source monitor.
The point I'm making is that as you scrub through, if that's the bit that you want right there, you
see as the palettes are just coming through.
Stop the mouse and double click and the play had will.
Well, it will bring the video into the source monitor and the play head will be ready right at the
point where you were at.
So that's using the source monitor.
Now, what you can do is you can instead of you can bypass the source monitor.
And sometimes I do, but not always.
You can bypass the source monitor and drag your clip down into the timeline.
And as you can see in the timeline, it's brought in a video track and an audio track, but it's brought
the whole thing.
Sometimes you may want to edit with the whole thing and just work your way along, but there's a there's
another way of doing it.
So you can just bring in what you need so it doesn't overcomplicate things.
There's no right or wrong way with regards to this.
Bringing in your footage into the timeline, whether it be straight into the timeline from your your
footage bin or via the source monitor, it just depends on your personal preference.
And in all honesty, I switch between the two.
I mainly use the source monitor when I'm bringing in additional clips.
I usually build within the sequence first, but seen as though we're talking about the source monitor.
Let's just go back to here a second and let's say we want to stop the clip in our timeline from here.
Well, that's easily done.
You see how the play head is at that section in that video clip.
What we could do is we could mark an endpoint, which is not that icon.
It's actually this icon.
I don't use any of these buttons.
I use shortcuts just like we do with here.
So we got rid of so much of the stuff that's they're not really going to tidy this up.
It doesn't really bother me and I don't ever really use anything in it, so I don't really feel the
need to clean it out.
It just stays there.
It also helps if one of my second editors, if they use it, I've never asked them, but if they use
it and they're on this machine, they can use it.
Fine.
So what I'm doing here is I've got this video clip in the source monitor and I have the play had at
the point where I want it so as you can mouse over and it says Mark in and it gives you the letter I
saw on the keyboard.
I'm going to press I and you see what that's done.
I'm going to Tilde now so you can see it better.
All of this section of the video up until the play head has not been included.
We now have effectively a bracket.
The endpoint starts here and then you have this running all the way along the rest of the clip.
Now there is actually another handle, which is an out point right at the end.
But because it goes to the whole end of the clip, you can't see it.
So let's drag and see where we want to finish it.
Maybe about there.
So what do we do?
It's so intuitive.
You just hit.
Oh, so I-4 in and of out.
So we want to be out of that clip by then.
So we want to be in.
There and out there.
I never recap with these.
I always double check myself with that.
But yeah, so that's fine.
If you want to tweak it a little bit, you can always grab this and move it out a little bit more.
You see how it's moving past and actually the video is going with you even though the play head is still
here.
When I let go, it goes back to where the play head is, but it helps me to focus and to get exactly
where I want it to go.
In fact, I'm going to bring it back.
Just sit there.
That's where I wanted to go.
I'm going to Tilde to close that down again or to minimize it.
And we now have that clip ready, already selected with the parts that we want selected and ready to
go.
Let me just quickly touch over this area fit.
So this is a zoom area.
You have it the same on here as well.
You have fit and you have a half.
What this is corresponding to is this video in this window.
So if we go to 50%, that's zoomed it right in.
If we go to 10%, it goes all the way out.
So we could be led to believe that we're actually kind of probably around 20, maybe just a little bit
less.
We're at about 23, 24% size.
It doesn't really mean anything.
But when we get into here and we start to do things and we possibly need to come out a little bit,
it will be clearer.
But understanding what these do really helps.
Secondly, we have this dropdown here as well, which is your playback resolution.
It seems to default at half resolution.
That doesn't mean that it will only be half resolution when you export out these two selections for
your resolution is just to help your machine.
If you're using a 4K footage or even eight K footage and your machine isn't capable of playing it back
at full speed or full resolution.
You can help yourself out and help your machine out by stepping down the resolution.
It's only for playback.
It's not for output.
So now that we have this clip selected with what we want to use in our clip, how do we then get that
down to here?
Well, there are a couple of ways.
Firstly, it's not clear at first, but if you put your mouse or your cursor anywhere within, see that
save auto, save run and just going to it's just going to prompt me to control this again.
Remember, you need auto save autosave will save your it will save your hair line if nothing else.
And if we want to get this in here, it's not clear at first, but if you put your cursor anywhere within
the video in the source monitor, just like as if it was in here and just click and grab and drag.
We've now brought it into the sequence, onto the timeline.
The timeline is in the sequence.
They're interchangeable.
The term is kind of interchangeable, but this is known as the timeline.
So what we can do is we can just let go.
So now that is on track for of the video and track four of the audio.
We'll get into this a little bit more.
But what I want to do is I want to stay clean also.
It's not right the way to the beginning.
Look, there's nothing there I'm going to control and Z to undo.
Don't forget, that is the number one keyboard shortcut you will ever use.
I can't wait to get into keyboard shortcuts because there's one shortcut that I've been using or not
not being able to use all the way through the building of this course so far.
And it's I can't wait to get it added, but I don't want to add it yet because I want to share it with
you.
So we're going to drag this now and we're going to do it nice and tidy.
So rather than just dropping it wherever I want.
Still clicking, still dragging, I'm going to bring it all the way down.
You see how the audio comes to meet the video?
So the audio is the part there at the bottom and the video is on the top.
If we look here, you've got V here and A here.
So what we can do is we bring it all the way down so it's on track.
One of the video and track one of the audio and we're going to bring it all the way over to the beginning.
You see how it just stops there.
Let go.
Ah, hello.
We now have a clip which is feeding the program monitor.
This is your output for the video.
Now, let's say you don't want the video and the audio into here.
You only want the video.
Well, this is really handy because you see here you can see a video icon and here a waveform icon or
an audio icon.
Remember here, remember these icons here you have a video icon and a waveform which shows it's video
with audio.
It's exactly the same here.
So what do you think we do if we grab right in the middle of the video and bring it down and it brings
down everything?
What do you think?
If you got it.
Well done.
You grab right here.
There's no click.
You just grab it.
And look, it's only the video.
So with the video.
And without the video.
Now, as I said in the previous chapter, most B-roll is used without the audio anyway.
So sometimes to keep it even cleaner you can use just the video.
But let's say you only want the audio quite the same.
Exactly the same premise.
That's just the audio.
And they've come in separately so they don't even have anything in here to say that they're out of sync
with each other.
Adobe's really good premiere pro is really good and there are times when you bring a video in.
Very briefly, let me show you this.
If I unlink, oh, another shortcut that isn't set up yet, if I unlink that and I move that off and
then if I link them again.
It will tell me that there's a difference.
This video is minus 4 seconds and 4 seconds and 20 microseconds, maybe off sync from this.
Get a little bit of ahead of ourselves there.
So that's getting the video into here.
However, there's also a shortcut, if you don't mind getting the photo.
The video and the audio in here is a really quick way to do this.
So we're in here, we set the endpoint, we set the outpoint press comma straight in.
What it does is it places the video that you've selected, the endpoint and the outpoint.
It places it into the timeline where your cursor is and it places your cursor at the end of that file.
Just to illustrate that, again, I'm going to move that play.
Had the set cursor, play it, move the cursor, move the play head a little bit further, come back
into here and hit comma again, see how it placed it, exactly where the player head is, well done.
And then place the play head right at the end of that clip.
If you're going through multiple clips and you're trying to work out or just get in a rough cut, that's
a really easy way to do it.
Let me just quickly show you that.
I'm just going to bring my my play head right back to the beginning.
You can drag this around, which is easy.
If you click in anywhere here, it won't move the play head because obviously you could be clicking
on other things that are on other tracks.
But if you click where this area is, where the numbers are, which is 15 seconds, 30 seconds and so
on, you can move your play head around or you can just drag.
Or if it's over here and you have the home key on your keyboard, they go straight to the beginning.
So let's quickly do this.
Watch how quickly we can build up a sequence by just that, in, out and comma.
We've already picked that first one up.
Safe control.
Thank you.
We're going to double click into this next one.
Oh, he's taking the fight.
You see how it started halfway through because I clicked at this point.
Let's get him.
Okay.
We're going to get there.
So let's go in that.
That's good.
One out, comma.
Let's move along.
Yeah.
When I get that, Emma jumps out of the way and I want to get.
Yes, sir.
I want to go in there.
I don't want to show that.
I don't want to be out there.
So let's in out comma.
Moving along.
Okay.
Now we're in the fire and see how I'm scrubbing fast.
But it's not playing fast, you know?
I'm just.
I'm just searching within the video.
I want that trouble going back.
So that's just as I'm starting to move.
So in with the I key play.
That's good.
Let's go pose that out, comma.
And I think that's enough for now.
But let's watch what we've got back.
I'm just going to mute this track.
I will cover this.
We're literally just discussing this at the moment.
I'm trying to show you with it being used in the timeline, just how quickly you can build up.
Your sequence.
In fact, that takes quite a long time.
We don't really need that much, so I'm going to delete that.
Don't have to, but we haven't covered the cutting yet.
So let's change this.
And I want let's have two instances there.
So let's have him just starting.
That's good out comma, see how everything moves along so nothing got overwritten that's a nice little
touch within premiere pro let's get a bit weights all of it like cascading.
That's out there moves along again and then it goes to that.
Okay.
So then we're going to highlight all these again.
I will cover all this and we're back muted there.
We're back to the beginning.
And let's have a look now.
And as you can see in very short time, we've managed to create this little sequence that doesn't take
too long, doesn't over labor, everything, but shows all the different elements that we wanted to
show.
It's not taken that long at all.
The only thing to then level this up will be able to maybe time those cuts between the clips with music.
But once again, we're getting ahead of ourselves and we will get to that.
So that is the use of the source monitor.
The source monitor.
Really, for want of a better term, the source monitor is your friend.
Don't forget, if you set an in and out pointing, you don't want that anymore.
Within this space, you just right click away.
The hand is right click and you want to clear in and out.
Done out.
Send that clear in and out.
You don't necessarily have to do this.
There are some times, however, that I've come across and I've already mocked up a piece of footage
and it can confuse things.
So if you don't need it anymore, it's always good to go back and clear the in and out of a selection
in a clip, but it doesn't really have to be.
So that is your source monitor.
We're now starting to put files, clips into the timeline.
We're now starting to edit video.
So how do we really work with these video layers and why would we want more than one layer of video?
Because, let's be honest, there's only one screen.
We'll cover that next.


### 4. Understanding Video Tracks (Layering)

So we've learned about the source monitor and how to bring those clips down onto the timeline.
We've learned about the project.
Let's make this smaller.
This is just really hurting my eyes.
Yeah, let's keep it as the.
I actually live like this, but let's just leave it like this because it looks pretty and it looks much
more professional, doesn't it?
So we've learned about clips and scrubbing through them and finding where in a clip we want.
Okay, so we now need to understand the timeline.
First off, this is really quite important.
You need to make sure that the things here that I have checked are checked for you.
They should be on by default.
This is snapping.
That needs to stay on.
There are times where it can come off.
And we will.
I will show you instances where it may be easier not to have snapping on, and I'll explain when snapping
is working at first.
So you can see what I mean.
I need to leave this on as well in certain overwrite sequences as nests or individual clips.
I'm not going to I'm not going to deep dive into what that actually means purely because I always have
it on and it works for me in my workflow.
And whether you like it or not, you're learning my workflow.
It works for me and it's worked for well.
It's been developed by me over ten years.
We live this on as well.
Linked selection at marker is something that, as you can see, there's M there.
So we never use that because I use the keyboard shortcut and this is handy, it's useful and it's actually
a setting.
It's not toggled on and off.
Tug a pressure.
That's a word.
You don't toggle this on and off.
It's something else in here which I will get to when we're talking about workspaces even further down
the line.
Yes, we still have things to talk about with regards to the workspaces.
Remember, these are all the workspaces you'll have less than me.
But yes, there are other workspaces that we need to work into once we start really deep diving into
the edits.
But first steps first.
So what we want to talk about in this section is video tracks and layering and actually discussing the
video tracks will have some some similarities with the audio tracks, but one big thing will be more
obvious than others, which is why it's not anything like the audio track, and that is what we're talking
about.
At the end of the last section, there is one program monitor.
There is one video shown at any one time.
So what is layering?
Well, if you work and if you've ever worked in any kind of image editing, you'll understand layers.
If you've ever worked with Photoshop or Illustrator, the thing that's on top, the thing that is closest
to you is what scene?
The thing that is thing is is not very descriptive, but for want of a better word, everything that's
behind the front layer is behind it.
And if it's smaller than the front layer, it's behind an unseen.
That's the same with the video tracks, but instead of front and back, it's top and bottom.
So here's video track three, video track two, and video track one.
We can always add more video tracks.
If you go to anywhere within this space and right click, you can add a track or add tracks.
So you don't have to just add one at a time.
You can add multiple, you can also delete tracks, but you can also create tracks without having to
do that by just dragging up.
And Premiere Pro will create another track.
I'll show you that when we get to that point.
So here we are with our clips and we've cleared our sequence out.
Again, what I want to do is I'm just going to drag in this clip to here and I don't want the audio.
So just to recap, I've set an endpoint and an out point and just going to drag the video and put that
onto track one because the play head is at the beginning, it's shown it up on the program monitor.
If the play head was here, it's not reading anything because the clip isn't there.
So it's back to nothing black video, but it's not black video, it's just nothing because you can actually
import black video.
I've never done that.
But Adobe gives you the option to.
Still don't know why after ten years.
So here, right to the beginning, I dragged my play head right back, right to the back.
And that is where we're starting now.
We have all this space here and yet only this little clip.
So let's have this clip.
Fill more of the space, not making it bigger control and Z, but just to zoom in a bit.
Now, there's a couple of ways you can do this.
And there are actually three ways to zoom in this timeline.
We have the width, we have the height of the video tracks, and we also have the height of the audio
tracks.
Now, you can do that with these handles.
You can actually you see how this handle is here and this handle is here.
Where have we seen that before?
Well, we've seen that before when we were something like this in the source monitor, when we interpreted
the footage.
Do you remember that?
Well, that's exactly the same representation here, because the timeline has defaulted to be just over
10 minutes long.
In fact, if we take our playard, remember we hit home to go to the beginning.
Well, if we if you have the end key, it may be a function modifier.
And if you're on a laptop or if you have the end key and hit that, that goes not to the end, but to
the end of what you have in the timeline.
So don't confuse the end for the end of the timeline.
If you hit end, it only goes to the end of the last clip you have, whether it be a video, an image
or some kind of audio, you can't get to the end by shortcutting.
If you drank the play head, however, you get right to the end and there's actually 10 minutes, 4
seconds and 18 frames well to show white defaults is that I'm pretty sure there's some kind of maths
in there, but yeah, that's where we're at.
Bearing in mind just to touch over this.
Hours, minutes, seconds, frames.
How do we know that that is absolutely frames?
Well, let's go back to the beginning and let's play this better video with the spacebar.
While we're in here, you see, and there's a little blue highlight around this window, the timeline
window.
If I was in here, if this was selected and I press the spacebar, it would play up there.
But we're down here clicking here, and the blue signifier around here means that this is where any
of our shortcuts are.
Keyboard shortcuts will affect one of those keyboard shortcuts is spacebar.
So we're going to hit that and watch this clock.
So it didn't get to 60.
So that's not seconds.
It's not even one hundredths of a second.
It goes to 24.
Why 24?
Well, because there's 25 frames per second in our sequence.
So if you go one more, it goes to 1/2.
The way in which you go forward and back one frame is actually the cursor on your keyboard, left and
right.
So you can actually go back and forth just by each frame.
Now, do you see how this right here isn't in focus?
It's blurred.
Remember what we talked about very early on with your hand moving quickly in front of your face and
that creating blur?
Well, there's motion blur here, too.
That's because it was filmed with 180 degree rule.
Not going to go too much into that.
In fact, I'm not going to go any more into that if because that's more videography rather than editing.
But if that kind of tweaks your interest, have a search for the 180 degree camera rule or video rule,
and that will explain how you get motion blur or how you absolutely guarantee a natural motion blur
in footage.
So yeah, even if we're going frame by frame and we stop, there will still be blur here.
And that's because of motion blur.
But back to here.
We're down here on the timeline and we want to see more of it.
We've tracked this all the way out.
We can see far too much in the clip that we have now is tiny.
Okay.
Well, leaving that handle there, grabbing this handle here and pulling back to the left, we'll zoom
in.
You actually have the clip now going off the timeline.
You can't see all of the clip.
Move that back.
Brilliant.
The shortcut for this is if you're on a trackpad, it'll be your two fingers or whatever it is to scroll
now.
Control and save the auto.
Save those save.
By the way, I'm just making sure to bake it into the project file in the folder.
But what we're looking for on a if you've got a keyboard and a mouse, we're using the scroll wheel
on the mouse.
If you don't have a scroll wheel, it's whatever affects the scroll wheel on a lot of trackpads on laptops,
it's two finger up or down.
So if we hold down the alt key, which is the option on a mac, I remembered it once.
Don't expect me to remember it all the time.
It's the key immediately to the left of your spacebar.
So the holding, the alt key and scrolling down will zoom out, holding the alt key and scrolling up.
We'll zoom in.
And where it zooms into.
Depends on where your mouse is.
So if I placed my mouse over here and I zoom in, you see how it grows out from where my mouse is.
Again, if I go all the way over here and I zoom out.
It retreats back to where my mouth is.
It's something that you will get used to and it will become second nature.
I also have a mouse which has a thumb wheel on it and I use that to go back and forth, up and down
the timeline.
But you can do that with your scroll wheel or your trackpad by not holding alt and just scrolling down.
I just use the thumb because it makes sure that I'm actually moving and manipulating the timeline in
the way that I want to.
So I'm scrolling down now on the wheel, which you would be going either down or up on your trackpad.
And as you can see from here and the numbers are going all the way down the timeline, scroll up and
I'm coming back.
The quicker way to do that, if I was all the way down here, would be to hold down alt zoom out and
then get your mouse over here and zoom in and you move your way around.
Now there is a keyboard shortcut to show all of the timeline, and it depends where it is on your keyboard,
but on my keyboard it's to the left of Z and that is the back slash key.
Let me zoom all the way in and I'm using that key just to the left of Z.
And I press that and it shows everything that's in the timeline, not the whole timeline, but it zooms
out to where all of the footage that I've got is in frame.
The reason why I'm telling you this is because I never use this key.
And the reason why I'm telling you that I never use this key is because I change the reason I change
the effects that that key has.
It's my number one shortcut.
We're not there yet.
But if you find that useful when we set our keyboard shortcuts, you're going to need to find a different
key.
As I said, this is so customizable and although I can show you a certain way to do it and to manipulate
the footage, manipulate the program, and to work with the program, it is inevitably you that will
decide exactly what you want to be able to do with the footage and what signify is what shortcuts,
what workflow that you want.
There's no hard and fast rule here.
It's just it's just the way it is.
So now we have a video on video track one.
Let's see what happens when we put a video onto a video track, too.
First off, let's get the play head and get it right back to the beginning of the sequence, which on
the keyboard is home and let's go into track to double click.
And there we have the video already represented where my mouse was when I clicked all footage.
Now pull it back a little bit and okay, we've got my father in law.
This is Joey, by the way.
We've got my father in law who's just lit the fire.
Let's bring him back a little bit.
And I want to go in there and I want to go out there.
So that's if in oh four out now I just want the video again and I'm just going to drag this in.
So let's see what happens when I drag it in.
Okay.
So I have a represent I have a representation of this clip.
In fact, let me just zoom out a little bit alt or option on the keyboard and scroll down and now let's
drag it in.
It's a little bit longer if I bump this right up to the end.
It's a little bit longer than the other clip.
Now, let me show you snapping first while we're here.
If you look here, when I bring this clip in, look around here and you'll see.
I want the video.
You see that?
There's a small little arrow just below my my mouse cursor here.
See how it's disappeared?
That's saying I want to snap and that's trying to snap to two things.
In this instance, it's two things.
It's trying to snap to the beginning, because I've got pretty close to the beginning of the timeline.
It's also you see how at the top there's one of those hours as well.
So it's trying to snap to the beginning.
It's also trying to snap to the beginning of the other clip.
So still holding my left mouse button.
If I drag this over and get towards the end of the first clip.
Now we have that black line and we have that arrow.
You see the arrow that's coming right here.
Look at the corner right here.
That's now confirming that that black line intersects right at the end of the other clip.
Now, I could drop this on to track one video, track one just by letting go of the mouse while that
clip is in that space.
So now we have two videos or two clips, sorry, on video track one.
And if I scroll through.
Nice, easy cut, very similar to what we did up here with in and out and comma to automatically put
it down.
Now, what happens if I'm halfway through this clip just by moving the play head and I grab this clip,
the second clip, and bring it onto a video track?
One, video track.
Two.
Sorry.
And let go.
Well, I can't see video track one.
Now, remember, it's top to bottom.
So rather than front to back in video in image editing software, we're looking from top to bottom.
So if you imagine you're stood here looking straight down like a planned view, the only thing you can
see is this clip, because it's the same size or bigger than the clip below.
How do I prove that to you?
Well, if I go to effects controls, don't remember this.
We are going to be talking about this.
But here's the scale of the video.
If I scale this down, the other clip is behind.
And if I play them, if I take the play head right back to the beginning and press spacebar, they're
both playing at the same time.
They're both in the same time, within the video, within the timeline.
But because they're at the same time, they're playing consequently together.
This, that makes sense.
I hope it does.
I think it does.
So everything that's above takes precedence.
So if you've got something on top of a track below that is taking up the full screen, it will cover
everything that's below.
Why would you want to do this?
Well, let's say that this is not this video, but it's something else.
In fact, do you remember the project that we were looking at before the actual review video I made
for my channel with this?
Let's bring that back.
And now you've got your eye in with regards to video one and video two in the different tracks.
Let's see if you can notice why I've done what I've done.
Okay, so here we are.
We're in the timeline and zooming out and moving around so you can see everything.
And I'm hoping that this is a little bit more clearer than the last time we saw this piece of editing.
Now, first and foremost, let me just quickly draw your eye to over here.
Remember that we we were bringing in different folders.
Well, here's an example of that.
So the video within the video, we had the A73, we have the A6400, and we have all the B-roll.
There's the cooking mamba and the dough and the tomato sauce.
You see how much is in here?
However, when we twirl it all back down, it's all nice and neat.
It makes such a difference.
I've actually got two projects open at the moment because still we have these videos and along the top
we still have our sequence right here because the sequences can tab all the way along.
This can really help or it can really confuse depending on what's happened.
And if you've done something blindly and not thought about it, it's this is the most important reason
why we keep off sequences where they are.
Because let's say this chair outdoors.
Number one review this was the this is the make of the pizza oven.
If I close that sequence, how do I get it back?
Well, if I go into sequences, it's right there.
If that was somewhere in here, I'd have had to search for AC Q and it could have been in any host of
bins.
But here it is right here, and if I double click on it straight in now, if I selected it and double
clicked, remember what happens.
It wants me to rename the file, which is why I clicked off it and then double clicked on it.
So let me show you what I mean with regards to the layering and why you would want to put different
layers on the same thing you want to you want to override or yeah, you want to override the video that's
being shown.
Well, here I'm talking that's a lovely, lovely frame I'm talking about here, which is my wife cutting
and making the tomato sauce.
As I'll say in the video, we very quickly discovered that there was a better way to do it.
But I've got the footage, so I'm getting it.
But have a look while we're playing back.
Let me zoom in a little bit more.
Remember, hold down the alt or option on the Mac and you can see that we have.
This video track, which is on track one which is me talking.
Another lovely freeze frame.
Adam.
Then we have the B-roll on here, followed by another piece of B-roll on here and continued B-roll.
And then somewhere where it's not B-roll.
Let's see what that translates to on the one video screen that we have.
I'm going to unmute this.
You're going to continue to hear my voice.
Voice, sorry about that.
But let's just see it in let's just see it in practice and why we would layer video on top of the video.
So I'm ready to go.
Anna, my legend of a wife, set off prepping what we needed for the pizzas.
First the tomato sauce.
And although we've since found a stupidly easy recipe that requires no cooking at all, we filmed her
making the tomato sauce recipe on the char outdoors website, so we're -- well going to use some of
that footage that said the pizzas tasted amazing and that tomato sauce.
Oh.
Then the day before we were due to cook, she started me.
You see what's just happened?
I brought myself back, but then went back to here.
Because this is the beauty of B-roll.
B-roll.
If I didn't have this B-roll, I'm going to deselect or hide.
Hide?
Yeah.
Hide this video track.
So I'm going to go back to where we were, and I'm going to see this little eye here.
I'm going to toggle the track output.
So I'm going to turn that off.
Not deleting anything.
I'm just turning it off.
I'm also going to turn off track three, which is up here.
There's no actual reason why that's up on track three.
But it was what I was building and I had other stuff that was around and I just placed it on top and
I realized, okay, I don't need anything else.
So I just deleted it, but it stayed up on track three.
So I'm actually going to remove track three as well.
And let's just very briefly watch that back and see the difference that same project.
Thank you.
I'm ready to go.
Emma, my legend of a wife set off prepping what we needed for the pizzas.
First the tomato sauce.
And although we've since found a stupidly easy recipe that requires no cooking at all, we filmed her
making the tomato sauce recipe on the char outdoors website.
It's just a talking head and doesn't matter how pretty or in this case, on precis you are, it's boring,
which is where B-roll comes in.
But what we don't want to do is we don't want to cut up this because we can then move things around.
We're getting a little bit of ahead of ourselves, but I think this is a really good illustration.
Let's say this piece of footage here, let's toggle back on those tracks, this piece of footage here.
We came along and let me meet him.
We came to that point with like, right, okay, let's bring in that tomato sauce.
So I brought it in and rather than actually putting it on track to put on track one, okay.
So yeah, okay, that's cool.
And I then come back there and that's great, but oh, right.
Okay, let's, let's decide that I then want to move that and I want to move it over to here.
So if we're now playing back, if prepping what we needed for the pizzas, first the tomato sauce and
although we've since found it, see what happened, this has overwritten what was on video track one.
Now, do you remember what your number one shortcut is?
Undo.
That's only got one undo again control NZ brilliant.
We've lifted it up.
So then we're back here because we can easily move that along back where we were intending it to be
on video track one, but we still have all the main video underneath for us, so we're not overwriting
everything play again if prepping what we needed for the pizzas.
First the tomato sauce and although we've since so it's back that's why we layer on top for video it
just helps us and it doesn't make the decisions final.
If this was here and the alto option and scroll up or scroll down and it was in here and then we want
it to move round here.
It's a pain.
It can be rectified.
And I will show you how to, but it can be rectified like that.
And but that's too many clicks.
And if you start moving the video around, it can be really difficult to repair a hole that you've punched
in the video when you didn't really need to do it initially.
Just stay on a different video track.
Does that make sense?
I hope it does.
So that's how we or why we use video tracks and tracks in general with audio, it's a little bit different.
Nothing overwrites, anything because nothing's seen.
Everything is to do with audio levels or effects that you're applying to certain tracks or certain clips,
and that's why you would have different audio tracks.
With regards to video, it dictates what's being shown on the screen and that is key.
So that is video layers and how it affects your timeline.
Let me save that project.
Always save that project and just close that project right now.
So we're back to here.
So again, let's see, we were moving this around on video track too.
If we then move that down and think, Oh no, we actually want to move it a little bit further along,
it's overwritten here.
We can drag this out to bring it back, but it would have been so much easier just to drag it on track
to now you can keep on going.
So let's say we move this up to track three track these would be that.
Let's remember when I said you could right click and add track.
Well, if we just drag it up into the empty space and let go, it's already create a track four and
we can create track five and track six and so on.
And if we keep going up, we can't go any further.
Is that limited?
No.
But if we hold down, shift and zoom, see how we're shrinking this way rather than just out and this
way, if we go, if we say if we use alt, it will resize one track.
I never really want to do that.
I always want to do more together.
So you hold down shift and it sizes them all vertically.
But we can still keep going, see.
But then very soon you've got.
Very thin, very thin video clips and you can't see what's on it.
You've got to then zoom in to be able to see what's on it.
And it's there we go.
It's there right at the beginning.
So what we like to do is try and at least minimize what how many video tracks we use.
But using more than one video track can really help you to get the effect you want without baking in
your decision and without almost destructively editing.
We don't want to edit destructively.
This is non-destructive.
It's just overlapping.
We can move this around.
Whereas if it was here and we moved it around and then come back, it's destructed.
That it's destroyed.
Destroyed.
That it's destructively edited.
Controls that.
Controls that.
Controls that.
We're back here.
That is video layering.
Next section, we're going to be discussing shortcuts and how they help you in your editing process.
This hour, I've been waiting to get to this point.
I have some great shortcuts that I use that really help your workflow.
You're probably nowhere near as excited as I am, but shortcuts are the life of an editor.

## 7 Program Updates
### 1. Why We Have Updates, Update Types & What Changes You Need to Know

Program updates.
First and foremost, why are we talking about this now?
Well.
I've just had one.
And it's as good a time as any to explain the importance of program updates.
So this is Creative Cloud Desktop.
We talked about this very briefly at the beginning as to where to get your any of the actual programs
that you need.
So here is you can see all of the programs that I have are currently up to date.
However, we're in the end of October, we just started it's the it's in November now, but in October
quite often we have major updates normally around October.
So going into the autumn and going to the spring, so around March, April, there's another major update.
So we've an update here to Premiere Pro.
If I look at all the versions we currently have, Premiere Pro 22.0 and the previous version was 15.4.
Now, I'm not too sure why we've leapt to version 22.
I'm sure someone could explain that.
I've always kept my premiere pro all of my programs up to date because there are bug fixes and a whole
host of reasons why you need to keep your programs up to date.
But there are also a couple of reasons why you wouldn't update and I'll explain them now, but the fact
that we're on 2.0 is a big deal and one that is the main reason why I'm doing this right now, because
you will see a difference going forward in this tutorial and I want to at least address why and therefore
you can have that in your knowledge base going forward.
So, okay, that's all good all up to date.
Now, the first reason why I have to show you this now is because I've gone to double click the program
file to open it up because I saved everything and shut it down and I'm recording again now and I'm great.
Greeted with this text box.
Now the project was saved in a previous version of Adobe Premiere Pro must be converted.
The original file will not be modified.
That's cool.
So what does this mean?
Well, you cannot open a newer version of anything Adobe, but we're looking at Premiere Pro here.
But this applies to all of the Adobe Suite.
You can apply it open a newer version of Premiere Pro Project with an older version of Premiere Pro.
It just can't happen purely because there are so many updates that you get with Premiere Pro that those
newer files won't be compatible.
They're not backwards compatible because we're always pushing forward with the updates.
However, you can be forward compatible and that's where this text box comes in because we've been saving
our project and that was just the file name.
However, what Premiere Pro wants to do now is to save a copy of this.
So what this will do is it will convert our project dot PR page.
There is there is a file extension for Premiere Pro and instead of saving it going from this point on
as our project, it will be saving as our project amendment or appending one.
So this will be the file type that you're looking for from here on in.
Now, you can always go in here in delete the underscore one, but I like to keep those versions just
in case.
And it never has happened to me.
But just like with the auto saves, everything is done for a reason and it is to avoid as many headaches
as possible.
So I always leave this and you'll see.
Let's, let's just click through and I'll show you what happened.
So you press okay and I'm saving it defaults to save next to the original.
Project.
Now, if I quickly navigate to.
This folder, you can now see that we have our project here and then our project appended one.
That's absolutely fine.
I will always leave that project because as you've seen how easy it is.
If I double click that if something went wrong with this, obviously this wouldn't have any auto.
But if something went wrong with this, with the conversion, I could always just double click this
open again.
If I just do that now, it will want to convert it.
But it's now give me an appending of two because it knows that number one has been created.
But just to go back here, we will always still have this and we'll always have this.
You always go for the latest version.
If you've got a project that you're working on or building through and it goes through two versions,
there will be number two here as well, but I've never had that.
I probably will do if I have some long term clients and I use projects that I built two years ago,
maybe 18 months to two years ago, and I always go in and we and we and we swap out different things
and anyway, but you can have so what you would always use is the latest version of that.
Is that clear?
I think it is.
Now why do we have updates?
Well, everything changes.
As you can see now is a really good way of explaining the reason why you should sync your settings.
Because I haven't been thinking my settings because I haven't wanted to override anything.
But I think this is a good time to show you.
My workspace is pretty much the same as what we're working with before, but just a few minor tweaks.
And first and foremost, I have the essential graphics tab here.
Don't worry about that right now, but we will address this.
And I also have a plugin premiere composer, by the way, you may have noticed in your work sheet there
are links towards the bottom of that worksheet and that well those will point to certain things that
I, I discuss throughout this course that I think may help you, but I can't give them to you to download
because I don't have the rights to redistribute.
We will be addressing this as well and it's a really important point.
But for now, just know that if there's anything in here that doesn't necessarily come with Stock Premiere
Pro, I will link to it.
And the great thing is this is free.
I'm not going to get to that yet because it's such an exciting thing, but you need to understand more.
But yeah, so this is my main workstation.
It's actually much wider normally because I am on a 34 inch ultrawide, but this is my workstation and
this is what we're going to be using from now on.
The only difference is probably this has been kind of just made a little bit skinnier than what where
we've been working at before.
But yeah, I'm happy with this.
We're going to go forward with this.
So the changes you need to know is that if you're not sinking your settings, your settings will be
gone because you haven't sent them.
Now thankfully I am sinking and it's, it's pulled in my settings even though they're not sinking,
but it's pulled them in when it did have a fresh install because it's a new install, it's an upgrade
but it's a new install.
So it gets rid of older versions of Premiere Pro and it installs the absolute newest.
Now the other things that you need to know are that there will be certain things that are supported
in newer versions, like there's a certain there's a certain style of support now within Premiere Pro
that can work with a ten bit and even 12 bit footage that's going a little bit advanced right now.
But the great thing with Premiere Pro is that it really is one of the editors.
It's an elderly and non-linear editor of the industry, so it's used throughout the industry.
So then you get the support for pretty much all cameras and audio equipment and all that kind of stuff.
So you will always get those updates, which is why it's really important to update when you can.
Now I say when you can because we spoke about this quite early on, but this is a subscription service
now and you pay per month for this.
The great thing is, is that you get these updates throughout the year just like we've had right now.
You don't have to wait for the next time and then you don't have to pay it all over again or pay a discounted
upgrade fee, which is still in the hundreds of pounds or dollars to upgrade to the newest version.
But the thing is with that is that you could be halfway through a project and you don't always want
to update the program straightaway because there's an argument that because of the model that Adobe
use now.
We are always using a beta version.
We're not Swedes.
It's been tested, but it's been tested to a certain level.
And quite often if you're in the middle of a project and at the time is ticking down, you have a deadline
to hit.
And if something goes wrong or something doesn't quite come over with the update and say you're using
a plug in, say like premiere composer, or there's another plug in that I use quite often.
I don't even know if it's going to be this unique meal, which is an audio leveling plugin that's a
bought one, but it's really good.
And if that hasn't come over and I've already got a project with these things active, it can be a real
headache.
So my best advice would be if you're on, if you're in the middle of a project, I mean, I'm running
between six and ten projects at any time, depending on what clients have, what work.
And but I try and not update while I'm in the middle of a project.
Now, that can be easier said than done because you can have so many projects that are overlapping.
But yeah, just be mindful of that.
You can always roll back to a previous version like you saw in in that.
Let me just get back to that.
You can always roll back since I have updated this and it's not quite right and I need to step back.
I can always go to here other versions and I can step back to 15 .4.1, which was the last I have no
idea why we're at 22 now, but 15 .4.1, which was the last stable version that I was running.
And look, I mean, you can even go much older, but I wouldn't advise that you just don't have the
support.
But yeah, so update as often as you can.
I just wouldn't have auto updates because it might update in the middle of a project and you do not
want that.
You you just don't just.
That's yeah.
As I said, this is a little bit of a crowbar section put in here, but I needed to show you before
we went any further and I hope you can appreciate why.

## 8 Keyboard Shortcuts
### 1. Why Use Shortcuts

Right then, you crazy cats.
We are now getting on to a subject that I.
I cannot stress enough the importance of.
And that is keyboard shortcuts.
We are now point eight in our course and as you can imagine, I scream recorded and will continue scream
good everything I'm doing.
And then what I do is then I bring all those screen recordings into a separate premiere pro project.
I quickly ed times are about half times where I've had to pause and I bring them all together and then
I export those individual clips.
Now, I didn't really I thought I did, but maybe I didn't realize just how much I use one particular
keyboard shortcut.
And it's obvious it's the cutting, it's the, it's the splitting tracks keyboard shortcut.
And I use it so much.
And the key that I use generally is the backslash key.
Let me get a a picture of a keyboard.
In fact, we can get that up by bringing up the keyboard shortcuts.
Let me just bring this up first just quickly and then I'll talk you through how to get it up in front
of yourself.
But first and foremost, here is a keyboard that shows all the different shortcuts kind of that are
already set for you.
Some of them I use, some of them I've never used.
And yeah, I can actually see one.
I've tried to get rid of all my keyboard shortcuts, but I can see one that is still there.
Anyway, what I used to cut is actually on my keyboard.
It's just to the left of Z and that is the backslash key.
Now it's not on here, but that doesn't mean it's not within the memory of here.
It's actually up here.
Here you go.
But it's not there on my keyboard.
So don't necessarily take this as red.
This is just the adobe keyboard that is set out.
Now, first and foremost, I want to show you what I mean by cut, because obviously we haven't done
anything like that yet.
So I'm going to be running a lot of keyboard shortcuts at you from now on.
And I'm going to say as often as I can, they got control.
And yes, thank you for the update for the autosave.
I'm going to say them when I can remember to say them, and I really hope I do, but apologies if I
don't remember all of them.
But I'm going to zoom in to this part.
And to do that I'm holding the alt or option on the Mac and scrolling up on my mouse wheel.
Now if you own a touchpad that would be alt and to finger up or down to zoom in or out.
I think some of them do a pinch to zoom as well.
Don't quote me if you want to be a decent editor, always get yourself a separate mouse, preferably
with a scroll wheel.
I use the the master from Logitech.
I think it's an amazing mouse.
I'll leave a link in the documentation for the for the mouse that I use and it's brilliant because it
has so many programmable buttons.
We won't be touching on that in this course purely because I can't guarantee that you'll have it.
But that's what I use.
So I'm zooming in.
Also option on a mac and scrolling up to just give myself a little bit more room here.
I can then scroll up or down to move down the timeline.
I also have a thumbnail that I can do that with, but yes, so that helps us to go up and down the timeline.
You can also grab this little play head and move it around to go up and down your timeline.
Don't worry, we will cover this again.
I'm just trying to get you a little bit, at least used to it just to be able to explain what I mean
by cutting.
It's not cutting.
It's not a cut.
It's a split because obviously copy and paste still exists in this world.
If I selected this and what's the keyboard shell for?
Copy and paste, even in word or any anything, it's controlling extra cuts.
Now, if I cut this, it's got rid of it.
Yeah, that's, that's like what you cook and you copy and paste.
So I'm going to control and Z to undo that.
So we don't want to cut it.
We want to split it.
And now a lot of tutorials that I see they'll, they'll bring you to a certain point and go, okay,
so split that.
So you come all the way up here and you already know how little I like to be moving my mouse around.
But the.
Erase it all, remember, in the old days.
Or if you're not young enough to remember that congratulations.
But they used to splice with a razor and splice the tape.
So we still have elements of the old world of tape and film here.
So we have a razor tool unused that then changes.
You see how Mike is my cursor.
It now changes to a razor and you come down here and you click there and then you've got to go back
up here and click there to go back to your selection tool.
And there you are, Split Control Z to undo undo again.
Now you can do it quicker.
Razor, I think is R yeah.
And V is my selection tool which is there I know isn't razor because.
That's right.
Anyway, you're not going to know that.
You're never going to need to know that because you're never going to be going all the way up here to
get the razor tool.
So the keyboard shortcut is controlling key.
Look at your keyboard.
How much of a pain is that to hold down control and hit K and to cut that?
Now we don't want to do that.
I will explain with regards to highlighting clips and clips that are active and clips that aren't,
but just follow me and do exactly what I say right now and I will set you up for success.
And I know that sounds completely twee, but that's what we're going to do.
So we're going to create your own shortcuts.


### 2. Creating Keyboard Shortcuts for Efficient Workflow

Shortcuts.
So we've touched on very briefly why we use shortcuts, because they are a shortcut.
They make it quicker for you to make your workflow quicker.
And I remember when I was first watching tutorials and getting my learning on, as it were, for Premiere
Pro, and I was always told time is money, and yet it is when you're doing this professionally and
something say a cut that would take maybe one and a half to 2 seconds to do the control and k o going
all the way up here.
That only takes 2 seconds.
But if you imagine in an edit, the edit they showed you a while back with so many cuts, you take that
second and a half to 2 seconds.
Say minute.
I meant seconds, the second and a half to 2 seconds and multiply that out by every single cut you've
done.
If you're able to shave a second of that time, that saves you a lot of time.
It speeds you up and it gets the technicality out of the way so you can create.
So you start to play the keyboard as if it were a piano.
And I know that sounds very twee and I don't mean it to sound as cliche as it does, but you do.
You get to a point where you're at one, you've got one hand on the keyboard, one hand on your mouse,
and never the two come off the other.
And it's just it honestly, it's, it's like making music.
So follow what I do and just do them now, all of these shortcuts, and I promise you it will help you
in the future.
So we go to edit right off the top left and let's go to keyboard shortcuts.
So this brings up your keyboard now rather than going all the way through here and trying to search
for what we're going to be putting shortcuts on, let's just do it now.
The first first one that I want to change is this one here, because it's not actually by default.
L By default it changes the speed in which we play back.
I don't work.
I don't work with that.
It's not the way I work.
I don't jog, which I do, but I jog and shuffle by dragging this play head.
Now you can play back and l by design will play back at a faster speed.
That doesn't suit my workflow, so I don't use it.
And I have been tasked to do this to bring you along my journey and use my technique.
So if you don't mind, that's what I'm going to do.
So I'm going to change the L two link.
I will explain some of these I want explain some some of these.
So if you go if you search the link here and it used to be control l two link let me just get rid of
that.
So here it was as default.
So we go to link and you scroll down and it's clip link in here is the shortcut.
If you click to the side of it, it brings up that box where you can delete that shortcut or just click
to the sign.
It creates a new little box and type in what you want.
That's what we want.
We want.
L don't do anything else.
We're just going to go away now and we're going to carry on.
Just to confirm, by the way, just in case you're wondering, that is there, but don't ever click
cancel always click.
Okay, I love and apply button here just so I could bake that into myself.
Okay, that's been done.
If I don't do anything else that's been applied but actually has been applied, it's applied by default
as you've done that once you click out and then you press okay to confirm it.
Okay.
So let's move on to the next one and it's that cut and it's actually called add edit.
So you type add and as there it is, add and in a sequence add edit and it's controlling.
Okay, we don't want that.
So I'm going to click in here and I'm going to click my button.
I can't wait to bring this back and I'm going to hit that and that backspace as you see it just added
it to there as well, which actually, as I said before, isn't where it is on my keyboard.
You can do whatever you like if you have that button, I assign it to that button.
I don't use the Zoom tool either.
In fact, the times I hit Z when I don't mean to, but yeah, I don't use the zoom tool either.
So if you don't have backspace here, feel free.
Backspace a backslash.
I feel free to do the Z tool, but going through here I will be saying just cut or split and I will
be using the backslash tool that Claire got right next one.
Next.
This won't mean anything to you right now, but just do it next.
I guess what I'm going to do and done, I will explain.
These are promise.
And one that's really important is enable.
So enable.
I'll explain that at some point as well.
I know I'm repeat myself, but instead of shift E, we're just going to do no, no, we're not going
to do a we are going to do zero.
I have a number pad to the right of my keyboard.
I have this number pad and I always have zero.
If you don't have zero on here, you could always do this form, but this can also affect your multi-camera.
So if I can make any suggestion with regards to what to use instead I would use I would keep just shift
e if it is using a modifier as in shift, but I would just as e e just as easily.
Also say forward slash if you want to.
I don't use this.
I've never used forward slash too much selection.
No, I just don't do it.
So I would do that.
Do we do link yet?
We've done link.
We've done the oh export frame.
I'll explain this very, very shortly.
Pull in.
If you type in export, you want to come down to here and you want to look for frame export frame which
is actually control shift.
See and what I actually changed that to is the letter.
See if you look in here, see actually isn't anything by default.
So I do it as C, I remember it, click in, click in, say thank you.
I remember as I'm taking a capture and capturing something.
So let me just very briefly show a couple of these hits, okay?
Okay.
It's okay.
You can always come back to that as you as you.
So you can always come back to it and you can always dial in more shortcuts.
Are there was one more shortcut?
Yeah, there was.
So I'm just highlighting exactly what I'm saying and it's paste attributes.
So if you type, if you search for paste attributes, it's controls shift v, I change it to pay.
As you can see, nothing is by default in P.
That doesn't mean that the version that you're using in the future doesn't have something there under
P, but for right now it doesn't.
And whether it was or wasn't, I don't use it anyway.
So I'm going to click in to here, click to the side and type P and that's now my paste attributes that
comes in very handy later down the way and it's such a it's such a powerful tool is paste attributes
to okay so what does all this mean?
Okay so I've shown you how easy it is to cut straight with the back slash button or that if you haven't
got the backslash button, it's just so, so easy to link.
Yeah, I do want to show you a link.
Here are the export frame.
So you see this, this is export frame as you can see if you mouse over certain ones of these.
And in fact, that would be the only one.
Brilliant.
Thanks.
It will tell you what the shortcut is.
Now, as you can see there, it says control shift plus e is the shortcut.
However, it's also included C, because we've added that to why there isn't a comma before it that
should really default is comma but that's that's on Adobe but it does confirmed that we have actually
made C one of the shortcuts for that.
Now what does that do.
Well, if you're looking to get a thumbnail or a series of images from your footage, it's as easy as
finding where you're going to switch to full resolution just to be on the safe side.
And I just remembered another keyboard shortcut and see and what that does is it brings up this little
dialog box.
So we're asking for a name to save.
We're asking for a format in yours.
I have no idea why Adobe do this but they're format defaults is BNP never want that ever to pat down
and put it in JPEG and never think about it again.
You could always do PNG, which is a slightly higher quality, but JPEG has never done me wrong.
And then that say fire and you browse to where it's going now where mine's going is remember we made
up these I have an images folder done and I want to save that.
Oh it's just off the bottom there.
Sorry about that.
Select that folder.
Good.
I want to fire saving as a jpeg.
That's where my save puff is and I import into project.
Now it's up to you.
You can import it into project if it's an image that you're then going to be using within here.
There are times where you do need that and we will cover that.
But just as easy not to import into project and.
Okay.
And nothing's happened.
As you know.
Well, now, if I had a selected to import into a project that would have shown up here.
But here it is right here.
And this is just an image that we've exported.
Now, if you're looking for somewhere in your video to get an image for a thumbnail to then take it
to another project, I mean, put some text over it or something like that.
That's the perfect way to do it.
It's an easy way just to get an image or if you need the image for some other reason in the project,
which we will cover in in future chapters.
But that's the way to get your image and then you imported into the project.
But anyway, that's what that shortcut does.
Now, to enable or disable, I use this a lot, but just to highlight very quickly how to use that.
Nothing is selected right here because I clicked into an empty space.
But if I click on this and then hit the number pad to zero, which is what I have for enable, it literally
disables it and then brings it back.
Now there are times where you just want to delete that footage, but then there are times where you
want to just disable it.
And again, we will touch over that nesting that's a little bit more advanced, which we will look into
as well as linking.
But for here, I'm just glad that you have all your shortcuts in there.
And I have my favorite shortcut, which is that lovely backslash to add that.
Edit Honestly, going forward, this will make things so much easier.
So those are shortcuts.
Can we have a little look at some more shortcuts?
Yeah.
Let's.
Because there are a few there are a few other shortcuts as well as the.
Cut, which I love, and that is ripple delete.
Now what is Ripple Delete?
Let's move this bad boy over here.
And to Ripple Delete, it's hell.
I'll show you.
I've done a cut there and I'll do another cut here.
Now I want to delete this.
Now if I just have that selected and press delete it removes it.
But now I've got some blank space here in the sequence.
That's a ripple delete if I control and z to undo that delete and if I hold shift and delete it's deleted
that and then closed up the space.
That's called a ripple delete.
But there's actually a step less that you need to do.
Let me undo, undo and undo and and do again.
Let's move that back down there.
So here's this clip.
And let's say we want to cut there and we want to come back in here rather than.
Editing.
Cut it.
I'm saying cutting, but you know what I mean.
If I cut here and then delete that, there's a quick away and that's.
Q And what.
Q does, if you look at your keyboard, you've got Q and you've got W o accidentally pressed it, ruined
it.
Q and W.
Work with opposite ends of the scale.
So cue is delete everything to the left or before the play head of that clip.
So that will cut and delete and move everything up.
That makes sense.
If I use W, rather than deleting this portion and moving everything up, it will delete the portion
to the right of the play head and everything up.
It won't close of the space because this space is still there within the timeline.
But if I hit W.
Dale So those are really good shortcuts to know as well.
Q W and backslash.
Now our backslash, which is I'd add it again, default is control and K.
No idea why that's a thing.
I love this.
I love one of my favorite other shortcuts is the alt key.
So if you look at your keyboard and mac uses, that's the option key to the left of the spacebar.
Alt to the left of the spacebar is an amazing modifier.
Say I want to duplicate this.
I could control and see.
Then maybe over here and control and V.
So that's copy and paste.
We know that from word.
So there it is.
And there it is again.
There's a quicker way to do that and that is to highlight it.
Hold down the alt or option key on the mac and drag.
Keep your alt selected.
And let go of your mouse button and there is a duplicate that works so well when you want to duplicate
things above themselves.
And there are reasons why you would want to do that again.
We will cover that in the future, but that's really important.
The alt key is brilliant.
It also overwrites a minefield that I'm going I don't want to go too fast with this, but let's bring
up our source monitor.
And which clip was this?
I'm going to right click and reveal and project.
And it was this.
Now let's say that we want to change that up.
That's the in and out point that we had a double clicked, opened it up in the source monitor and that's
the in and out that we have.
So here
to there is this clip.
If we track that, it should match up perfectly.
It does that.
So we want to change that.
But say we're in a timeline and we don't want to move anything around.
That's absolutely fine.
Let's set a different in and out point that's clear this in and out point by right clicking and clear
in and out and let's select I there I let's set out there.
Now, if I've done it too short, let's see how much that takes up.
That's actually shorter than what we had.
So if I grab this just the just the video, remember, we're just grabbing the video and hold down the
alt key and come over to that clip.
And let go.
That's now replaced that footage with different footage.
And because we had a longer clip than what we selected, it will just keep it in to keep it the exact
same length as the clip we had in the timeline.
Timeline will always override what was in the source monitor purely because timeline is the main workspace.
That makes sense.
I think it does.
And then it controls that because I want that footage in that control.
That again is undo.
This is a I nearly just did I do this without even thinking.
You see what I've just done there?
I've clicked in there and it's highlighted that space.
Let me click out again.
This is another version of Ripple Delete, but this is a way to delete empty space.
Now, if you're if you've got a music track down here and you're running the video and you've left that
blank space because something else is going to go in there, but you've edited to the beat.
You want that in.
Well, you may want that space or you may have something else that you're going to be putting in there.
But if you've got blank space and you don't want it, of course you could grab this and you could pull
it up and let go.
By the way, if snapping isn't turned on, turn it on.
Now, this snapping, as you can see, I'm moving things around and nothing is like I'm moving freely.
If I turn snapping on.
Watch this.
You see how there's a little bit of play where it snaps to the end of things?
I always want this up.
This is a big deal to me, so I could move that up and snap it up against there.
However, if I highlight that space and just press delete that ripple deletes the space in between the
clips.
A really nice and easy way to get that where you want it without having to try and fine tune it, allowing
this and allowing the snap to take it and then let go.
Because you could quite easily, if you do it, if you're going quickly, that's not okay.
That snap and let go.
Oh yeah, I've gone past the snap.
So the easiest way to just go all nice and clean, been done and there you have nothing in between.
Another shortcut which is really handy, which is actually by default, is the default transition.
What is the transition?
We are going to be touching on that very soon.
But to apply a default transition is shift and D.
So D for default.
How do we do that?
How do we apply that?
Well, you see how this mouse is changing.
This cursor is changing what it is depending on.
Where I have it.
Well, this is giving me the dialog to be able to shorten or lengthen the clip just by getting up to
here.
I need to explain this first while I talk about transitions, bear with me.
So if you put your your mouse or your cursor towards the end and drag, click and drag.
All of a sudden we can bring more in.
Remember anything we're doing in here?
Cutting, deleting.
It's completely nondestructive.
All the files are still here.
It's just we're changing.
What parts of the files we want need to understand that it's non-destructive.
So let's say that we're happy with where we have these two clips going against each other.
But I want to apply a transition.
I want to apply a crossfade, which is also known as a dissolve across.
Dissolve.
Well, I go to Effects and I go to video effects, I go to transition.
And I want a I don't want any of those.
I want a video.
Where is it?
You see, this is the problem.
I've never I'm never in here.
That much.
Let's go for it to dissolve.
So let's search for dissolved.
This is so and oh, it's like video transitions.
Dissolve, cross, dissolve.
Now have a look here.
Firstly, I've searched for that.
Anything that you know that is within Premiere Pro or anything that you don't know is in Premiere Pro,
you can always search for it.
So handy now.
This blue box is really important because you will have two different blue boxes, one for video and
one for audio.
And what this tells me is that my default transition is across dissolve.
My default video transition is across dissolve.
What does that mean?
That means when I use the shortcut for for default transition, it will apply across dissolve.
So there are two ways to apply this.
I've sent them to show you the really long way and then going to show you how easy it is.
Bearing in mind to get to this point, we've had to first try and deep dive and find it and we couldn't
find it.
And we clicked into here, searched, dissolve, and now we've got it.
So we can grab this with the left mouse button and drag it.
Look at that.
That now is between the two clips.
You can easily put it on the end clip, which actually is a fade to black.
You can put at the beginning of the clip, which is a fade from black.
Let me show you that.
Let go.
I want to get this play head right back to the beginning.
I'm just going to hit the shortcut home.
Really easy.
I could also have used up.
What do you mean by up?
Well, this video one track is highlighted, which means that I can work my way along here without doing
this.
I'm somewhere right here if I press up.
It goes to the beginning of the current clip that I'm on.
Now, if all goes back down, goes forward.
So if I'm now here and I want to go to the end of this clip, effectively the beginning of the next
clip, I press down.
Brilliant.
Sam again goes to the end of the next clip.
If I had alltrack alltrack.
Alltrack and alltrack.
Why we've done this.
Well, let's activate v three video three, but let's not activate video four.
Okay, so let's just put into context what you've just been shown.
So I'm just using the up and down arrows on the keyboard if I press down.
It goes to there.
Now, if I press down again, will it go to here?
No, it won't.
It will go to the beginning of here because V two is highlighted.
So down goes right to the beginning of air.
This is really handy when you need to move around and I promise you this.
Getting used to this and the shortcuts that work within a sequence does speed you up so much, but it's
understanding the basics of this first.
So now at this point, we're at the beginning of the first clip on video two.
So if I press down again, where will it go?
Will it go to the end of that clip?
Will it go to the beginning of this clip?
Will it go to the beginning of this clip?
Well, if we see here, B1, B2 B three are all highlighted.
So what is the next end or beginning?
It's this here, so it will go to there.
If I press down again, it won't go to the end of this clip, even though it's highlighted.
It won't go to the beginning of this clip.
It will go to the beginning of this clip, even though it's not being read.
Because, remember, we read from the top down.
So anything on top will be read on here.
But it's still reading it because it's activated.
It's selected.
If I press down again, go to there.
Yeah.
You know where we're going on to here.
Now, if I press down again, will it go to the beginning of this clip on track for how to think about
it?
And if not, where will it stop?
I've just moved it up a little bit just to make sure.
Yeah, you're right.
It will not stop at the beginning of this clip.
It will stop at the end of this clip.
Watch.
It.
Won't read this because it's not highlighted.
There are reasons why we would do this.
Say we want to effect loads of these clips, but we don't want to effect some.
Let's take AFI one and go back to the beginning.
Now, if I press down, it goes to the beginning of that track.
It might be because all you want to do is search along a certain video track.
It really helps.
I promise you.
So how do we apply a default transition?
Well, first, I'm going to highlight all these by drawing a marquee around it and just pressing delete
and just got rid of those because I don't need them.
I only duplicated them to show that.
So control is another really important key on your keyboard to control.
I've never seen anyone show this and it's something that I picked up on very early in my workflow.
But if you got control, hold down control and then drag a marquee.
All it does is it affects the ends of clips.
Now if I let go that's now highlighted those two clips and Adobe now knows that I want to concentrate
on the split between these two clips.
I do because I want to apply a default transition to cross dissolve.
Now, if I didn't highlight those, as you saw before, I just dragged.
And the highlighted over here.
Now, if I put it right at the beginning, it will just fade in from black.
If I put it at the end, it will fade to black.
And then just bring in that second clip.
I want to cross this all between the two.
It's a bit of a fine balance with your mouse.
Obviously, if you zoomed in, it'd be a little bit easier.
But as you're about to see, you will never do this.
I've let go.
And I now I'm going to hold down the alto option on the Mac and zoom in by scrolling up my Maxwell.
And here we have a cross dissolve.
What does that mean?
Well, if I highlight it and go to Effects Control, you can see what it means.
It's going to cross between A and B.
A is the first one.
B is the second one.
That's right here.
If I.
Tilde there.
So you can see it a little bit better.
This is actually showing the cross point between clip one and clip two.
A being pizza oven one being pizza oven two.
Now that's because they're from two different clips, a footage, but it could easily be pizza oven
one and pizza oven one as well.
Just a different part within it.
Don't really need to know, understand that.
But what you can see right now is you actually have both clips on the screen at this point.
That's because it's right at the big right in the middle of this default transition.
Let's bring this back a little bit.
And press play by hitting the space button.
Space button spacebar crust is off right there.
Now let's control Z to get rid of that crust dissolve and let's do it much quicker.
Hold down control.
Draw that mark.
Let go and shift D done.
And you can do it even quicker.
Let's just press up.
See what we did that we went up to put where we want this to be and shifting.
Didn't work.
Why didn't it work?
Because nothing at the end was selected.
You don't always have to do the end.
You can highlight them all and then apply the default transition.
But.
The reason why we do a control and drag, because as you can see, it's applied across crust is all
on there as well.
So what it will do is it will apply the default transition to all ends of all clips selected.
We don't want that.
We don't want that at all.
It's to show that again.
Or to abide by by the way to delete you just select the cross, dissolve, select the transition that's
in place and just press delete.
Don't ever be frightened of pressing delete.
Anyway, let's highlight these both again by drawing the marquee tool, which is purely just drawing
a square around it like you would in Finder or Windows Explorer to select files and shifting again.
Default transition, default transition, default, transition.
Now, you may want that, but we don't want that right now.
Control Z too, to undo that and hold down control.
And now we're just highlighting the gene that we want to effect with the default transition.
That guy, the mouse button that go on control.
You can see that's what we're talking about.
We're looking at this bit right here between the two shift and D it just applies that devolve transition
to there.
Now you can change the default time of the default transition.
You can do that really easily by going to edit.
Preferences and going down to playback.
And what this does now.
Completely wrong timeline.
So the video transition default duration right now is ten frames now where we have this at 25 frames
a second, remember?
So that means that it's under a second.
Now, you can change that.
You can change it to be, say, 25 frames.
Highlight that, 25 press.
Okay.
It won't affect things that are already in, but it will affect everything you do after you see how
that's a longer transition.
It's a much bigger cross dissolve.
But there's a reason why I don't do that and I don't have it that long, because you can affect the
time of the default transition or any transition once it's in.
Let me just go back and change that to where it was.
Was ten frames, right.
I'm just going to put that back.
In fact, we're going to come back in here in a second.
But, yeah, let's just do one thing a lot.
The reason why I leave it at ten frames.
Just it.
Then I'm going a bit fast so I control, track it over and shift and d the reason why is because you
can easily make a transition longer or shorter.
You really need to pay attention to what your cursor is doing depending on where you are.
Member This changed depending on the ends of the clip.
Well, we can do the same.
With a transition.
See how that mouse has changed and oh, there we go.
So it's telling you when the cost itself starts and when the cost dissolve ends and the duration of
it.
Ten frames.
Well, you can make it longer by just literally dragging it.
And drag it out.
Look how long we can make it.
I mean, seriously, you can make it as long as you want.
It's almost the longest dissolve in cinema cinematography history.
Look, you can make that as long as you want.
I mean, that could be the look that you're going for.
In fact, I've seen a number of documentaries that have things like that.
So leaving it at ten frames is perfect for me because I think just a nice quick cross dissolve if you
ever need it.
Boom.
Done.
In fact, that's too long.
Yeah, that's ten frames.
That's why it's just nice.
Boom.
You straighten?
I do a lot of beauty.
A number of our clients are beauty industry companies and a nice quick ten frame cross dissolve is more
than enough.
Now, obviously, that's not the only transition you have.
I mean, just in dissolves alone, there are lows in the dip to white.
Dip to white is a good one again, because it's not the default.
You have to grab it.
And drop it in.
But you can change.
Say you want it to y as your default.
You can right click and set selected to default transition.
I don't know why I can't read as default transition and just like that it changes it.
The blue box around it to that default transition.
I don't want to do that.
I'm going to change that before I forget.
But dip to white is exactly what it says on the tin.
Do you ever see any documentaries?
And someone's being interviewed and they put them up.
The the industry standard is to edit to white.
Because what it does is it says, I'm cutting.
I'm taking them out of context, but I'm making sure that you're aware that it's been a cut.
It's not just a jagged cut.
If you've never seen that, I've never been aware of it.
I promise you, you will see that from now on.
By the way, you may be seeing certain artefacts on my screen, and that is like it's it's it's almost
like a screen tearing.
What you should see horizontal lines here.
Maybe not now.
Make a liar of me.
Why don't you cross this out?
Maybe.
Let's do a dip for block.
I just want to highlight.
So.
I see that just.
Now.
Now, when I play full speed, you see this, there's some horizontal lines going along here and it
gets better.
The more times I play it through.
It's just called screen tearing.
And it's not the final output.
It's a bug that is currently going on with my graphics processor.
I have the I have a very powerful Nvidia graphics card, but for some reason I'm playback.
It does those horizontal lines, but it's never in the final edit.
I don't actually say it anymore because I know that it's not going be there in the final edit.
So if you are seeing horizontal lines in your own stuff, depending on the calibration and the setup
of your system, don't worry about it more often.
Well, the screen time will not be there in the final edit.
So.
That's keyboard shortcuts.
I know we went off a little bit with with transitions, but this is a whole thing that we're going to
be talking about very shortly.
Your keyboard shortcuts can speed up your workflow just immeasurably, and we will be using them pretty
much from here on in.

## 9 Manipulating Media
### 1. Effects Control (Position, Scale, Rotation)

So now we're on to manipulating media.
And in essence, that's exactly what video editing is.
You're manipulating any media that you bring in.
It could be argued, or it could at least be stated that we've already started our manipulation of media,
because this clip right here has a beginning there and then ending there.
Remember, we have a depth to wait just here, but we've already trimmed the beginning and trimmed the
end, so we've already started to manipulate the media.
So what do I mean by this next section of manipulating media?
I think I've said it enough times now.
Well, this is a standard 16 by nine video.
By that I mean there's the ratio is 16 across by nine down.
If you remember your maths at school, everything came down to the lowest common denominator.
If I seem to remember rightly so.
If we say 5/15, then the five can be taken down to one and five goes into 15.
How many times.
Five, ten.
15.
Good.
So 5/15 is one third.
Yeah.
So with regards to that ratio, one third is 1 to 3.
This is 16 to 9, 16 does not go into nine.
So that's why we call it 16 by nine.
That's the ratio.
There are other ratios.
There's one, two, one, which is square, which we will talk about a little bit further on when we
kind of we kind of recap over setting up a sequence for your different outputs.
But for now, we're working in 16 by nine and this 16 by nine is set by the size of the video, which
was 16 by nine, 1920 by 1080, that 1920, resolution 1920, always width first by the height.
So it's the exact x axis by the y axis.
But this is 1920 by 1080, which when you divide down is 16 by nine.
And we're working with in that kind of realm, that template of a size, but we can still manipulate
this further.
So how we do that is if I just hold down alt and scroll down to zoom out a little bit.
We still have our two clips here and what we can do is we can manipulate this media further.
So let's say I want to you may think of it as a zoom or a crop if you want to get closer to here.
Well, the easy way to do that say we want to maybe this little bit of rubbish that's over here, it's
not actually rubbish.
It's out of focus.
I think it was maybe some bird or something, but we don't necessarily want that in, so we want to
zoom in a little bit.
So let's just if we scrub through.
We see that that kind of stays where it is.
So that's not going to be a problem.
We just need to get it out of any frame really, and it will stay out for the entirety of this clip.
So what we do is we make sure that the clip on the timeline is highlighted and got up effects controls.
If you can't see this, don't forget we have our workspaces.
It has been a minute since I recorded the previous section of the course, and for those eagle eyed
among you, you'll see that I've streamlined my workspaces even further.
And this is also a change.
This is a further update of Premiere Pro.
So if you are seeing this in your version and you weren't seeing it in mine, that's why.
So the color of the labels, remember we could we could change the the label color here to different
colors depending on what our footage is.
Well that now represents here as well on the outside of a pen and on here, again, the color is here.
So obviously we've got the blue color, whatever.
What is that color?
It's Iris.
Of course it is.
So that's what shows here.
It's just another update with regards to how Premiere Pro is working.
And if you do have a fully updated version of Premiere Pro, you will always have the latest but error
on the side of caution.
As I said, if you're in the middle of a project, try not to update the program.
I've lost hours of work in the past purely because of an update.
Anyway, we're not talking about that.
We're talking about manipulating of media.
So because we've got effects controls here and if you haven't got it, window and effects controls will
bring it up.
And there's a number of things in here.
Already.
But as you do more things, more things will be added below.
But let's just deal with what's here right now.
We won't be dealing with absolutely everything, but we'll be dealing with a number of things.
First and foremost, if you're going to make any change to the size of this uniform, scale is always
important to leave checked.
I'll show you why.
If uniform scale is unchecked and say we want to change the height or the width, only the height or
the width will be affected.
Just going to skip a little bit ahead here and say, watch if I drag this out.
It only goes width wise and no one likes the aspect ratio that's not intended to makes people fat or
makes them look thin and outstretched.
And we don't like that.
So Control Z and we're just going to have uniform scale here.
But as you saw there, you only have to mouse over a number and it gives you this kind of drag finger,
drag and mouse cursor.
And that means that you can you can click in and dial in numbers, but you can also just click a number
and drag it.
So this right here, up and down is left to right.
So that's your X axis control Z to know.
Don't want that control Z to undo that.
And the right hand side is your y axis up and down.
So obviously with the scale up and down is going to be zooming in and out.
And because we have uniform scale on, we can zoom all the way.
Obviously, you don't want to do too much depending on the quality of your footage.
Now, this is 1920 by 1080, and the sequence that we have is 1920 by 1080.
But if this was a 4K clip here and we were still outputting in 1920 by 1080, so HD.
Bear in mind, I run a media production company.
I shoot generally in 4K.
I can't shoot this in 4K because it's slow motion right now.
In 2022, my stupidly expensive camera only shoots slo mo in 1080, but I only actually put out in 1082
clients and no one's ever requested 4K.
It's just it's just one of those things they may do in the future.
But I literally just put out in 4K.
So if that was the case, if I brought in 4K into here rather than the scale being 100, it would actually
be 50.
And you could zoom in past and not lose any any resolution, any quality whatsoever.
That's why shooting in 4K is good, especially when you're putting out in 1080.
But as we said, we want to get rid of this little bit here.
So we're going to track this just a little and then we pop.
Now, that took quite a bit of time to get going.
And if you want to really fine tune this, the little twirl down here, wherever you see these, there's
more options or there's at least additional things that you can do, if we will, down the scale.
We actually have a slide bar.
And if I'm fine tuning, I much prefer using this.
You see how much easier that is to fine tune.
So there we go we fine tuned that there.
Now what I'm going to do is I'm going to toggle on one of these.
Remember these shortcuts we put down here, we got rid of the play in a lot because we don't really
need it.
This is really handy.
Safe margins simply click that and that gives you the safe margins for the 1920 by 1080 ratio or the
16 by nine ratio.
And what I use this for often is to check where the center points are and the middle points are just
to make sure that I mean, there is a case for rule of thirds.
So putting something on this line or this line here or this line here, in this line here, and that
kind of draws the eye more.
But if you want something absolutely central focus, just clicking on the safe margins and bringing
this up, just it can really help when you're trying to eyeball.
Bear in mind that even if you leave this on when you come to export, these don't render with it.
They're just an overlay.
They're not actually on the video.
So we've zoomed in a little.
And what I'd like to do, because we've zoomed in, there's a little bit of video all the way out a
little bit, the clip all the way around the outside that we can play with.
We've got a Yukon in 112.4.
So what I want to do is I want to bring this down a little because there's quite a bit of space down
here that we'd like to fill and there's not going to be loads, but I'd like just a little.
So remember we had the scale and we were zooming, we were scrolling up and down to zoom in and out.
Well, this is the left to right.
You see how that's given us just a little bit more?
There's more that there's actually more than I thought there was going to be.
So controls that I want to do I want to bring this down.
So if we grab the Y-axis and pull this down a little bit, you see where the black is there.
So I'm just going to bring that up just to meet.
So now we've, we've, we've come down just a little bit.
If I reset this, this resets parameters back to default as it was put in, it actually has gone quite
a bit control Z to undo the reset and I'm much, much happier with that now.
We don't have that.
We have a tiny little bit of it there.
And if we want to fine tune that, how do we do that?
Yeah, we make sure that this is all the way down and.
Just.
There we go.
Done and dusted now.
What a lovely little hint that I have found in my time to do with this and this.
This kind of goes across the whole thing, though.
Pay attention, because there will be little, little shortcuts, little added little bonuses throughout
the whole rest of this tutorial, this whole course and that you may pick up on.
I've been doing this now for oh, wow, six, seven years.
Professionally, maybe eight.
I don't like to show my age professionally, and I still watch tutorials.
I still get courses just because you never know the tiniest little thing that someone may pick up.
I did a tutorial on my own YouTube channel a while back and someone mentioned it was it was for compositing
images and someone commented quite recently is that oh I love that shortcut of alt and click and drag
to change the brush size in Photoshop.
I thought that was hilarious because that was that was just something that I was doing to be able to
show what I was doing.
But it was that little shortcut that was picked up on and it makes all the difference.
When you have enough of these little shortcuts in your arsenal, your workflow can be great.
It can be so much quicker.
And also the the program gets less in your way of your creative flow.
I know that sounds very twee, but it's true.
Let's just get off these tape margins.
And this is too I'm what I'm leading up to.
If you're trying to get something moved around here, you're going here and then you're going here.
And all this.
Controls that, controls that.
The beauty is that you're fine tuning here, but if you literally just want to eyeball and grab this
and move it somewhere, you can't.
But you can because we just have to select motion and watch on here when I click motion, not effects
because that toggles on and off the effects that are being applied in this part of the effects controls.
But if I click motion of sudden we've got the wireframe all the way around and we have this little X
in the middle.
Let me just tell you this.
This X in the middle.
Now, what this is, is the anchor point, and we'll touch on that very soon.
But just to point out that that's what this looks like when we've got motion selected.
And what that is doing is that's engaging global motion movement with the clip.
What does that mean?
Well, that means now because it's highlighted, because it's selected within the program monitor,
we can click and drag it.
How cool is that?
It's so, so handy when you need to do just that quick.
Move that over there.
Move that round there.
It's more like like Photoshop or Illustrator.
And the beauty is, if you let me just controls at that, if you want to stay on a certain axis when
you're clicking and dragging, I'm all the way up here now, right?
I'm not moving my mouse, but watch when I press shift.
It now takes me on the vertical so I can't go anywhere over to the left.
I can't go anywhere off to the right.
That is literally if you want to stay, if you just want to go up or down.
Perfect.
Now, if I want to go all the way up to the side rather than up or down, start clicking and dragging
to the left and hold down shift.
And now I can only go left to right.
I promise you, that may seem the tiniest little thing right now, but oh my word, it makes such a
difference when you're trying to manipulate your media.
Just a brief little touch down to rotation.
Rotation works exactly the same way in as much as you click and drag and we can rotate the video.
Sometimes you need to correct say you wanted.
This isn't going to be right, but say we want it to be.
This was actually straight and our horizon was off.
We could manipulate it by dragging a little like that.
Does that look straight?
Well, this is where we need safe margins because you.
Yeah, okay, that works.
But what if safe margins isn't close enough?
Well, yeah, we could click and drag it up an eyeball and then bring it back down.
But we could also show guides.
Now, these are very powerful and these have only just been added to Premiere Pro in the last 12, 18
months.
And you see how I mouse over and I can click and drag these.
Well, if I click and drag that up to the line that I want to get on, we can now see actually it's
way off.
The annoyances is that you can't just undo and bring that back down because that will undo the movement
in that.
I'd love them to have the undo memory in the safe margins, but, you know, a little at a time.
So we want to get this rotation right.
And if we eyeball it and try and track, remember how I mean, I was tracking all that time, but it
only starts of moving at that point and it's still not right.
So yeah, yeah.
Maybe it is.
Maybe it is.
The annoyance with rotation in my mind is that when you twirl down, you don't get a slider, you get
this, which is it's it's just as clunky as dragging the number.
But let's say we were kind of it wanted to fine tune it, say you want it to move back a little bit.
Well, we know that's -3.0.
We could click in there and you see how that now becomes a text file that you can edit?
Well, let's say -2.8.
Once you press enter or we turn it dials in that number.
Now, why have I done rotation?
Well, because I wanted to highlight the fact that although we've done the rotation right, we've now
got a bit of a black bar up here, because if I zoom out a little, you can see that our footage is
completely skewed.
Let me just bring that safe margin back down and then just not safe margin guide and talk about off
and let's talk about up as well.
You see how we're completely out.
So if I controls that and bring it in, that angle is maintained.
So how do we fix that?
Well, there are two ways and two ways, because we know how much footage we've got down here.
So we can either zoom in further with this and just get rid of that black bar.
But you saw how much you had to zoom in because we're zooming in globally.
What we could also do is we could drag up.
Just a little bit.
See how we do that?
This is where I'm manipulating here.
And just the tiniest little bit.
Or, of course, we could cut motion, grab it.
Hold down shift and go up so we can only go up.
This is manipulating media and it's these little minutia that will really level up your video editing
once you get to that stage.
It's it's so, so powerful.
Now, down here is Anchor Point.
I don't often use my anchor point, but let's show you why.
Maybe you would use your anchor point.
Maybe you've you've got a piece of footage and you don't want to be moving it up.
You want to be growing out, but growing it out or scaling up brings up everything.
And, you know, you're zooming in all the way.
Well, it's zooming in, it's scaling up.
Need to use the actual proper term.
It's scaling up and scaling down from the center because that's where the anchor point is.
Now, if I go to say now 50%, let's go to 25% so you can see all of this.
If I move my anchor point down to say the bottom corner and you can hold shift and it will snap out,
maybe now you can hold shift.
It used to be shift up, control it, shift in after effects, hold down control and you can snap it.
So now the anchor point is down here at the bottom corner.
Well, what does that mean?
Well, it means that we used to grow and scale up from the center.
Now we're going to be scaling up from the bottom.
Right.
So this should take a lot, lot less.
Wow.
I didn't even have to slide that.
It was just where I'd clicked.
You see where we're growing from?
We're growing from right down here.
That's where we were.
And now I.
Wow.
Well, hold on.
Let's dial in and see where we're at at 114.
If we say 115, so 115, that's almost covered it.
I think we could probably get with one one, five, maybe seven.
And we're covered.
We're completely covered.
Are we?
Are we now let's have a look.
Let's Tilda now there's a tiny speck, you see.
So again, maybe 116 and let's fit and not quite you see it.
But the good thing is, is that because we're growing from the bottom right down here, that's you see
how, how much you need to manipulate your screens to be able to see things right from here.
We're growing so we know that we're actually only scaling up the minimum we need to because we're growing
up and scaling up towards the part that we need to cover.
I know this sounds a lot.
Maybe I'm making a big deal about this, but it's it's errors in this part and the manipulation of the
media that editors go wrong with.
And it can really it's those little things that can that can change the whole feel of an edit.
It really can.
So that's why I'm focusing on this.
It may seem like the tiniest little bit, but I promise you it isn't.
I'm just going to be sad that because that's really ruining my life right now, and I'm going to bring
that back down to about here, and I am more than happy with that.
So next, we're going to look at this bit with regards to picture in picture and how we can use what
we've learned here in effects controls and then maybe bringing in some form of crop to then have a picture
in picture or side by side and really deep diving into manipulating media to work exactly how you want
it to.


### 2. Picture (with Crop, Drop Shadow & Colour Matte)

So on we go and onwe build with our knowledge of effects controls.
And just as I mentioned in the previous section, this is where we are going to be learning not only
about picture in picture, but we're going to be picking up other things along the way.
And one of those things that we're going to be touching on is color.
Matt, what is a color?
Matt.
Well, what it is, quite simply, is a blank piece of color.
In your video, we will get to that in a section, but I just want you to have that in mind.
A color map and a double take.
So what we want to do here is I want to use what we've built on, what we've learned in the previous
section and build on that.
So that's the effects controls within here for any particular clip.
Now, just to make it clear, I've got this selected, this clip selected.
So these are the effects controls for this clip.
Now, if I select this, even if I don't bring the play head over, if I select this, watch up here.
All those values changed because what we were changing around here is not affecting this.
It's a different clip.
So let's bear that in mind.
What we're also going to be talking in talking about in here is nesting and the reason for nesting.
Well, firstly, what it is, but also why you would need to.
So you're probably fully aware of the term picture.
In picture, it's a picture within a picture.
And sometimes you may want to do that to be able to show more than one thing onscreen at the same time.
A number of YouTube channels do it where they have the person who's talking down here and they're reacting
to a video which takes up all of this.
Their picture is within the picture.
What we're going to use it for in this sequence is to show two stages of this.
These wood pellets going into the pizza oven and lighting it at the same time.
Often it's used to speed up the message that's being brought across.
Maybe you are limited to a 32nd or a minute long video on social media.
That's where picture in picture can come in really handily.
So I don't affect these at the moment, and you may be getting bored of viewing these two clips, but
what I'm trying to do is I'm trying to change as little as possible with regards to the footage that
we're using right now.
So then you can focus on what we're actually doing to the footage rather than the footage that makes
sense.
I hope it does.
So I'm going to make a duplicate of this.
So anyway, here, just with the main point at all, the selection tool, which is shortcut V and we
select by just clicking and dragging what's called a marquee an M, a q, u e, maybe another able to
show a marquee around it very much like you would do in a number of other creative programs.
But we draw a marquee over and you can see that both these clips are selected, click out and they are
selected.
So what we're going to do is we're going to select those both and then we're going to hold down alt
or option on the Mac and drag.
All of a sudden we have another copy, let go of that of the mouse and then let go of a and we now have
two copies of a one copy each of these two.
We can easily move that around just as we would.
We can split it.
And as you see, it doesn't affect this at all.
This for all intents and purposes, these are two new clips that are completely independent of these.
Just to be clear, if I control's that a few times we didn't have to drag up initially.
We just drag away and let go.
And there we are.
There are two clips.
These are the two that we're going to be playing with right now.
So if I get my mouse head or my play head over and here is the first clip that we're going to be playing
with now, I'm going to delete this transition by zooming in and selecting it.
See how that's just selected up effects controls.
Now that we've got effects controls here, you can actually do a number of things with regards to a
number of transitions, but we're not going to touch on that for now.
This is selected, I'm just going to press delete and that has now removed that transition.
So it just goes one clip into the other.
So what we want to do now is we want to scale down these clips to be able to have them both in the same.
Picture.
So picture in picture.
But do we really want to scale both down or do we want to scale just one down?
Well, let me give you a for instance.
Remember, it's the top down set up within a sequence or anything that's the highest is seen.
If I dragged this clip over there, we now have this clip rather than this clip.
So what I want to do is I want to place this picture first.
We're going to change this pop paste this picture in this picture.
How do I do that?
Well, quite simply, we go back up to the effects control panel with our clip selected, and let's
start scaling down a little.
You see how they're now both on screen in our program monitor?
If I go back to the beginning and play, you can see that both clips are playing at the same time.
On the same screen.
Now, what I want to do is I want to move that down to the bottom right now, of course.
Now I've scaled it down.
I can always move it around and move it down here.
Or I can click on the motion and drag it down to the bottom.
Right.
But what else could I do?
Think about what we just touched on on the previous section.
But me, rather than controlling that.
Don't forget, you can.
Completely.
We set the parameters.
Remember this?
This is our anchor point.
And remember it's visible because we've clicked on motion.
So we're going to grab this and remember that we all learned it's control, holding down control, and
we can snap it right down to here and then we can just scale down.
And rather than scaling down in the middle, which is what happened at first, we scaling down to the
side.
You see how learning that little thing with regards to the anchor point can really speed up what you're
trying to achieve.
So now if we play these both side by side.
We've got picture in picture.
Now, let's say we wanted them both on the same screen, but both the same size.
Well, that runs into a problem that we've got.
And let me explain why.
Let's just reset that.
Moved that out of the way for now.
Because if we did the same and scaled down, remember, we've already affected this.
So if we scale down now, all of a sudden we're scaling down from a different anchor point.
But also we've got this in here, which is what we had in before.
Now we could crop it, but we're not getting there yet.
So let's make a different decision.
What I'm going to do is I'm going to nest this clip.
Now, what nesting does is it creates an outer clip with this clip inside, simply for all intents and
purposes, within this sequence, we are baking in those details, those changes, these parameters.
And the way in which we do this is you select and press.
And now I can't remember if that's my own keyboard shortcut.
You would right click and select nest here, but let's just double check our keyboard shortcuts.
Remember, we played with these in the past.
So end is nest.
See how it's there?
If yours isn't there and you need to set it, you'll just go simply to this little search bar here,
right nest.
And in this shortcut, there won't be anything there.
All you do is click in here that opens a little bit of a dialog box and press the letter end and then
press okay.
That's the shortcut for nesting.
So let's nest this.
Now it always comes up with the default.
If you've got more than one sequence that's already nested, it will continue to number and sometimes
it just comes up with any number.
Obviously I went to nest before to the actual program things.
That was number one.
It's now trying to tell me this is number two, I'm going to rename this.
It's already ready to be editable or edited.
Even so I'm going to just put wood pellets and if I press okay, that now has created a nested sequence
up here.
You don't really have to worry about this, but I like to keep this tidy and sadly, this is something
that you have to do manually.
So in an empty space, if you don't have empty space, you would just click here for a new bin.
I always just right click and you, Ben, and I'm going to title this again, just like the nest.
We have an editable text right away.
I'm just going to write nests and press enter.
I'm going to drag this into here, just like file explorer or Finder.
It's now nicely nestled in the nest bin.
So what does that mean?
Well, now we've nested.
As you can see, all these are now back to 100%, nine 6540.
This is reset.
That's because it's baked in what we want into this file.
But that doesn't mean it can't be then edited.
We've only had one sequence along this time along this area, one timeline sequence within this area
before.
But if we double click this, it's now opened another sequence.
But a sequence that's only got one video and one audio channel.
It has to have an audio channel.
It just default.
There's an audio channel in there.
But in this nest, which is effectively its own timeline, we have.
All the details within the effects control for this clip.
Does that make sense?
The reason why we've done this is because we want to keep that framing, that composition, which is
different from the original composition.
And the reason why I want to do this is because we're now going to affect this as if it was a standalone
set clip without having to then crop anywhere we've effectively cropped in because if we now start to
grow down or scale down, there's not those.
There's not this.
Here.
You see, I have just affected that if I now go back to where that nasty clip is in.
And I reset.
It's all offset because within the next eclipse, which is now here, it's offset.
I hope that makes sense.
Let me control that.
Let me undo that.
Just so we're back to where we wanted on this that clip, and I'm going to reset this and reset this.
So we're back.
The reason why we're doing this is because we now want to do picture in picture.
With this other clip.
Now I know that doesn't necessarily seem like it's any different, but I assure you it is.
And if you come back to this at some point during your learning of Premiere Pro, you'll know how different
it is.
So what we want to do is we want to have this clip and this clip at the same time.
What did I do then?
Just to be able to look underneath.
I enabled and disabled this clip.
I've set this to zero on my keyboard.
And as you see, when I toggle.
It almost greys out this clip.
I use this all the time just to have a quick look below and see what is below to make sure I know where
I'm at.
You can easily turn it off with the little output, toggle track output here that closes the eye so
you can see it.
But that affects the whole track and I've left that closed a number of times on renders not to go back.
So I just like to enable and disable the track.
Again, if yours doesn't do that keyboard shortcuts down here type enable.
And the actual default is shift e.
I just have a zero.
I have a number.
If you don't have a keyboard with a number pad.
You should get one.
It's just so, so much easier with anything that you're doing.
As you can see, the only shortcut that I have set for my number pad is the zero.
But if you imagine if you're trying to dial in numbers here, it's much easier to do it with a number
pad than it is to use the numbers across the top of your keyboard.
It's just easier if you are on a laptop and there is not one.
You can always get a little USB number pad to the side.
I used to I used to have one of those when I used to edit solely on a laptop and it just made the world
of difference.
So let's get some picture in picture going on here.
We've got the fire starting on this one.
So we're going to want this to the right, I think, and we're not going to have it scaled down.
I want them both the same size.
So let's.
Let's reset the anchor point first.
And let's reset everything.
You see how that's now pushed down to the bottom.
That's because everything has changed, because my anchor point was a different place.
Resetting the position has brought that back up, and if I click on motion, the anchor points is right
in the middle.
If you ever have a problem and things aren't working out right and you're you're as sure as anything
that you're doing it right.
Always check your anchor.
Point is nine 6540.
If you're working in 1080, it will be slightly different if you're working at a different resolution.
But anchor point is always the first place I go to.
So what we're going to do is we're going to drag this over to the side a little bit.
And it doesn't really give us much room for the other clip.
And I want a little bit of a hand in.
So I'm going to click the bottom clip and I'm going to drag him the other way.
There was showing in that.
That's being on the safe margin.
So we know exactly where center is.
Okay.
That's not really going to work for me because I'd like to have a bit more of my work and it looks quite
a tall image actually how it's working out once it's behind.
But I could also do with a little bit more here.
Let's just see how this plays and see how it looks.
That looks quite good.
Packing a lot of space here.
And it's not really working for me.
So what we're going to do is we're actually going to add a crop effect into this sequence to be able
to bring this more here.
Because you see, if this being the top clip, if I dragged it, moreover, yeah, okay, we'd see more
of the behind, but we're seeing less of the clip that we want.
So what I'm going to do is let's keep the safe margins on again.
So I've got an easy eyeball on where the center is.
And I'm going to go to the effects panel again.
If you don't have this window and effects will bring up this effects panel and you can deep dive and
12 down.
Remember these little 12 things?
You can twirl all of these.
I may have more than you because I have a number of plugins and things like that, but you can twirl
down in all of these.
I hate doing that.
Thankfully we have a search bar, so I'm just going to click here and type crop.
And that gives me the crop effect within the transform area of video effects.
That's exactly what we want.
So I'm going to grab this crop and I'm going to drag it on this clip.
See what just happened there.
Let me just undo and show you again.
Watch in the effects panel, in fact, control panel that adds all parameters for a crop.
Brilliant.
What we could have done, Control said, is actually with this clip highlighted on the effects control
panel shown there.
We could just drag it into that.
But it's best practice to drag it onto the clip that you're wanting to manipulate just to make sure
you're dragging it on the right clip.
The amount of times that I've dragged into here and something else was a bit like, say, this clip
back here was highlighted and then I'm going back and forth with a crop and it's why isn't doing a thing.
And then I ignore it and go back here and all of a sudden this clip is completely cropped over here.
So that's what we wanted to do.
We wanted to do it with this clips of this clip is highlighted.
We've got our crop effect in here.
And then it's just as simple as dragging these numbers to crop where you want it.
So left will be the left, top, top, right, right and bottom bottom.
What I'm going to do is I'm going to cull this down just like you've done with the scale I like to work
down, because I'd like to really fine tune.
Look at that.
So we're cropping.
Into the clip.
There's no zooming in.
There's no scaling up.
There's no movement.
It's just a crop.
And because I've gone straight on the safe margins here, or if I use my ruler slash guides.
By the way, if your ruthless last guys aren't showing window and.
Show guides.
It's not a window.
It's in view.
It's one of the only things that isn't in window.
But just to make sure that you can see your guides here.
There is rules here as well.
But yeah.
So we can see that this is set to exactly where we want.
Right in the middle.
So now if we play this back.
You've got two elements being shown at the same time.
That is picture in picture.
And it works so, so very well.
We're going to build on this at some point, and that is to be able to manipulate the the crop and manipulate
the motion and actually be able to move these things around while they're playing.
That's a little bit later on.
I want to cover a few of the things first, but that is really where we can we can just make amazing
things.
If you haven't already got it yet, you can make amazing things in this program.
It's just it's fascinating.
I absolutely love it.
But before we finish off with the picture in picture, what I want to do is I want to give you another
version of what we could do with the picture and picture building on what we first did.
So let me just undo everything and remember how we set the anchor point to the bottom here and scaled
down.
Well, what I want to do first is I want to crop it.
In fact, I'm going to scale it down and then crop to include just what we want.
Just to show you it may is probably not going to look better than what we had it before.
But let's just click on the anchor point.
Let me hold down control, drag it down to the bottom, and then I'm going to scale it down just to
about here.
Now, the reason why I'm stopping here is because I don't necessarily need, like, this part.
Okay?
It's my father in law, and he'll probably take offense, but, you know, I'm willing to run the risk.
So we actually want about here.
So let's move over to the side.
You don't always have to crop.
You can just move him to the side because it's then going off so it won't be used.
But now, in hindsight, maybe we should have it the other way around.
Maybe we should have fire being the big bit rather than the the the pellets being poured in.
So let's control that controls that controls and get it all the way.
And what I'm going to do is I'm going to bring the wood pellets onto the top as let them both within
the mosquito and just bring them down just to just for cleanliness.
And I'm actually rather than scaling down to the bottom.
Right, I'm going to scale down to the top left.
Just tell the story going from left to right.
So let's have the nest.
This is the nest now selected.
And click on the anchor point and let's drag this up to the top left.
Snap it into place there and then with the 12 down and scale down from the top left.
I'm happy with that.
And now we're going to move this over.
So we can see it better.
But hold on.
We've now got black behind.
Remember what I mentioned about the climate?
That's when this is going to come into place.
But let's.
Let's finesse this exactly how we want it first.
So let's bring the world powers again.
This is all eyeballing.
So we're kind of deciding where we want it.
I'm playing around.
Nothing is destructive.
It's completely non-destructive.
So everything can be done, can be undone.
So this is here.
That's fine.
But this isn't where I want it to be.
In all honesty, I'd like it the other way around.
I really would.
I'd like him to be this side.
And because we've got no text or anything on screen, it might not really be a problem if we've got
this reversed.
So let's do that.
How do we do that?
Well, there's a couple of ways, but the easiest way is to add an effect.
And the effect we're looking for is flip.
And obviously we don't want a vertical flip.
If we drag the vertical flip, remember how we drag down the crop and nothing had changed.
We then had to manipulate it.
Well, these have the manipulation built into them.
Vertical flip.
If I drag this on the bottom clip, which is the big clip in the actual program monitor.
We're upside down vertical.
We flip around the vertical control Z, get rid of that and we're going to put on the horizontal flip.
So now all of a sudden, you see what I mean?
It makes sense.
If I mute that effect.
We've got a lot of dead space here.
And we it just doesn't work.
It doesn't work as well for my eye.
So let's turn back on that horizontal flip that looks good for me.
I may want to tweak him over just a little more.
And actually, with that in mind, we could then zoom up or scale up this a little bit more.
And because we're still with the anchor point at the top left, it's working really well because it's
zooming, scaling, and it stop saying that it's scaling up from where I want it to.
And if I click a motion, I can just finesse that where I want it.
And okay, I'm happy with that.
What I actually think is that I want to crop a little bit at the bottom.
We're going to get rid of this black.
But just for now, I want to crop in a little bit from the bottom here.
So let's go back to our effects list and type in crop once more.
And we're going to drag this onto the bottom clip.
So right here and then we go into 12 down the bottom crop percentage and just bring it up just a little
bit.
Yeah.
No, actually, I want to bring everything down a little bit, just so we got some space kind of all
around, so I'm going to highlight that bottom clip.
And bring him down a little bit.
Maybe bring him in a little bit.
Okay.
We've got loads there and I kind of want some space.
If we're going to have some space for my eye, I kind of want some space all the way around.
So let's put that exactly where we want it.
And then we already have the crop effect applied, and then we're just going to slowly slide up that
right crop.
Yeah, that makes sense for me.
I'm going to just reposition that just a little bit more.
I like that.
I'm happy with that.
Let's just play them both.
That's good.
Good.
I'm happy with that.
So we want we don't want black around the outside.
I'm not happy with that.
It doesn't really look that good.
I want white.
How do we do that?
Well, what we need is a color map.
So, again, not in the effects, because you can't create anything in the effects.
You can only add bends in here.
And because it's kind of footage, it needs to be within the project area.
So if we right click remember we hit New Bend before and we were down here and we you could create new
been here.
Well, just to the side you've got new item or again, right click and new item.
You get the same selection depending regardless of whether you right click or you go to the bottom.
And what we want is we want a color map.
So just click that.
And now what we're doing is we're confirming the settings for this color mat.
And while it will always default us is the settings of the sequence that you're working on.
I've never had to tweak this, so I always just go straight through and hit.
Okay.
Now what we're doing is selecting the color that we want.
I said I wanted white, but actually I want a slight off white.
So you see how this automatically has a little circle.
You can only see a quarter of it up in the top left.
That's black.
That's if you ever watched Father Ted.
That's Priest Black.
That's proper black.
And this right down the bottom corner is proper white.
We're selected within the RGV scale and we're up in the red area right now.
So you could select literally any color that you wanted.
So you wanted a green click into here, and then you've got all these different types of green throughout
the color space.
Also, if you have a hex code, a hex code is a series of numbers and letters which identify an actual
color.
You could just dava in there if you're working for brand colors.
But what I'm going to do is I'm going to just, you see, how I can drag around.
And this box is changing color.
It's going to drag around.
It doesn't really matter what color you've got when you go far enough to the left because you've left,
you just got the gradient from black all the way through to white.
And I'm going to have it maybe just that, just a, just a very light grey.
So that's what I'm going to select.
I'm quite happy with that.
I'm going to press.
Okay.
And it gives you now the option to choose the name.
I can be quite lazy and I just hit okay in after effects.
It literally puts in a name there for you.
So it will actually put like grey or dark blue or but it's really quite clever.
I'm surprised the premiere pro haven't updated that yet.
Maybe if you're watching in the future, they have finally got around to updating that.
I'm not too sure, but this is text that's ready to be edited, so I'm just going to type in light grey.
If you're not in the UK or if you in the U.S., that grey may be a typo for you.
I assure you in the UK it isn't.
Let's not get into that.
I'm just press, okay.
And as you can see, the light grey is now here ready to be dragged in like a clip.
So let's do that.
Drag it in.
Drop it on the timeline and.
Okay.
We're covering everything.
Now, we want this to be on for the duration of these two clips.
So just like anything, we drag it out.
This is unlimited, by the way.
You can drag it out to be as short or as long as you want.
It can be from one frame to 17000000 hours if you really wants it to.
But we're going to drag this to the end of these two clips.
But remember, we're top down.
We're always top down with.
Our premier pro sequences.
So what's at the top is being seen above anything else.
So we need to get this below the two.
And to do this, you just simply mark and select these two and then just drag them up and above.
If you want to make sure you don't deviate up and down the sequence, you can hold down shift.
And then I can't drag it anywhere other than vertically within this sequence.
So I'm going to drag them above the light gray and let go of my mouse button.
And all of a sudden we now have gray behind, which I'm sure you'll agree is much prettier than just
black.
We can go one step further and we will, and I'll show you this now I'm just going to bring these down.
So select them all.
Now I'm going to drag down.
I'm going to hold down shift just to make sure it doesn't deviate from where we're at now to give this
just that little bit.
Next level, we've got a picture on a picture it is picture in picture, but it's it's more picture
on a picture and it's cutting within.
And we've kind of created a space with the light gray colour matte behind.
So what I want to do is I want to give some kind of depth of feel, not depth of field, which is a
term in photography, in videography, but a depth of field.
So a feeling of not necessarily 3D, but just just more than just a flat design like this.
And the way in which we do that is we go to effects and we're going to search for a drop shadow.
There's our drop shadow and we're going to grab this drop shadow and let's just drag it on the first
one for now.
And as you may or may not be able to see, let's tell the that you've got a slight shadow on the edge
here.
Now this has also added drop shadow within the effects controls of this clip, which is actually a nest.
And what I always do.
And you don't have to, but you can select a different colour of shadow if you wish.
I mean, you can you can even you can even make the shadow red if you wanted.
See how the red comes around here.
You may want to do that.
You may not want to, depending on the effect that you're going for, but the the opacity always defaults
at 50.
Now, first and foremost, I always take that to 100.
What you're left with initially is just a black line all the way around.
Now, that might be enough for you, but what I then will do is I will increase the distance.
From the subject.
Never that much.
We've come to what distance is 15.2.
It depends again on the size and resolution of the clip that you're using.
Sometimes I only have to take it to like five a distance of five.
The direction is the direction the light would be shining depending to to create your shadow.
I always like my drop shadow to be bottom.
Right.
I'm not too sure why.
But then the big thing is the softness.
So what this will do is this will blur.
No, it won't blur.
It kind of softens it.
It kind of just smudges it out.
But in a uniform way.
So if I drop this down, obviously, remember, you can just track up and down with the numbers.
But I like I like it.
And if we increase that, you see how that's changed that?
You see how nice that is?
That's just a nice little soft.
Just a lovely little touch on it because this clip is on top of this clip.
It does actually put a little bit of the shadow of the clip onto the clip below.
No, I want to do the same with the clip below.
Now, I could easily do that by dragging on and making a note of everything that I've done and then
doing it to this clip.
But the easier way, not the easiest.
But the easier way is to select the drop shadow control and C to copy and then click the pizza oven,
which is the next one down.
Scroll down to an empty space.
Click in and control and v.
But then places that right here.
So we now have that exact same drop shadow on both clips.
There is, however, an easier way.
Let me control that.
So we've taken that drop shadow off and we're going to make use of a keyboard shortcut that I told you
to do very early on.
And that is.
Paste attributes.
Let me just double check in case you hadn't hadn't done it.
But if we search in keyboard shortcuts for paste, we have paste attributes here.
The default shortcut is control alt v as three, literally three keys.
I just have it as p i set it is p.
And this is why.
Because this is such a powerful tool.
I use it all the time.
So which is the clip that we've got the drop shadow on?
That's this one.
Which is this one?
And you can see the drop shadows right there.
So with this selected, I'm just simply going to control and see copy to the clipboard.
That clip.
Now I'm going to select this clip.
And rather than I can't control V into here because I've selected the clip and have copied.
But if I copy, it's just going to give me another another instance of that whole clip.
Don't want that.
I've got this bottom clip selected and instead of control v, I'm clicking p p is paste attributes.
So just like you can copy and paste the motion settings and over everything and the more effects and
tweaking that you do on a clip, the more things will actually be available here to paste.
What I have here is Drop Shadow, so I'm going to uncheck the motion because I don't want to paste the
attributes of the motion.
All I want to do is paste the attributes of the drop shadow.
It's okay.
And we have our drop shadow and it's now in the effects controls.
Now that might seem an extra way of shortcutting that you don't necessarily need, but if you have three
or four different things that are placed on a clip, maybe you've done a color grade and maybe you've
done some movement and you just want to you want to copy all of that and replicate it on another clip.
Paste Attributes will save you so much time.
So now we have our picture on a picture which is kind of picture in picture, and we have a column at
behind it and we have a lovely drop shadow adding just this lovely little, Oh, I love a drop shadow.
It just gives that little bit more.
So what I'm going to do is I'm going to prevent this.
So I'm going to get to the beginning and I'm going to press eye on my keyboard.
Remember how we used to do it in the source monitor?
And let me go to our videos and we selected I and Alpha in and out.
Well within the actual timeline.
We can select it here and we can press down one site with if we get actually in here again and press
down, that goes to the end of the clip and we're going to press oh, and then we're going to press
enter.
That does nothing.
That's because there are no effects to pre render.
You see how this is yellow?
Yellow means it's not pre-rendered.
Red means it needs a render.
And green means it's pre-rendered and ready for full playback.
You don't have to, but I always do when I especially when I've applied an effect just to make sure
that I'm seeing it exactly how it will come out.
So I hold down control and hit enter and this runs a full rendering of that.
Do you see how that's now changed from yellow to green and then going to right click and play in and
out because it just annoys me.
But if we now hit Tilde to big screen or full screen even and hit play.
Perfect.
So we've been able to see it in the full resolution, how we want it.
And as I said before, quite often you need to do this because you're held for time and you need to
tell the story.
And more steps than you have time for.
And being able to do a picture and picture like this can not only save time, but can look really nice
with the storytelling that you're doing.

## 10 Transitions
### 1. Applying Transitions

And on we move to transitions.
Now, it may feel like I'm only touching on certain subjects and then we're moving to other things.
And you be absolutely right if you thought that what the intention is, is to get you the basics of
the different panels and the different things you can do within Premiere Pro, and then throughout this
course we'll build on those things.
So, so moving on, we're going to be talking about transitions.
And if you remember early on, we did actually apply our first transition, which was to white nice,
simple transition, boom, done.
However, there are so many different transitions we can do.
We've come back to these two clips here, just so you know, where we're working with these again.
So we're not adding anything new other than the different techniques.
So just like we did in the previous section, we're going to delete this transition.
We don't have to but can easily be overwritten, but we're just going to delete it for now.
So if we go to our effects, I remember where we were searching in for crop and drop shadow.
Well, there are a list of video transitions and quite handily they're right to the bottom here under
video transitions.
So if we twirl this down, there's going to be a number of transitions in here that you don't have.
Film impact is a great plug in that I use, and towards the end of this course I will be including overviews
and so maybe deep dives into a number of plug ins that I use on a daily basis, some completely free,
some additional purchases, but all are worthwhile and I am not pushing these things just to help people
sell things.
Premiere Pro Depending on where you are financially and where you are within your journey is expensive
enough, but Premiere Pro sadly can't do everything.
And that's why we have plugins and third party plugins, graphics, all that kind of stuff to help us
with our workflow.
As I said, a number of these are free and will always be free, but you can buy more packs on them,
so we're not going to be touching on film impact for now, although I may be looking at them a little
bit later on in this course.
But what you can see here, anything that's here that's not written film impact are stuck included with
Premiere Pro, there's 3D motion.
If you twirl down, you can see all these.
A number of them are quite dated.
A number of them are quite I was going to say basic, but a basic transition is quite good.
Some of them they look to almost be coming out of the eighties and nineties.
Let's take cube spin, for example, to apply to and transition.
That isn't your default.
You just grab it and drag it between at the beginning, at the end or between two clips.
And this is cube spin.
And if I play it back to you.
Yeah, it's it's not great.
You can you can affect the duration of a transition by getting to either one end.
Obviously either end, if it's in the middle of a clip at the end, it's going into the clip is at the
beginning of the end and dragging it out so we can make the cube spin as beautiful as it is.
Please note the sarcasm last even longer.
You'll get one, you get one.
I mean, hopefully you'll get what I mean by like nineties effects.
I mean nineties if they're lucky control Z to get rid of that or to that change and then controls it
again just to get rid of it forever.
Flip over.
Exactly.
Very similar.
Oh wow.
I mean, seriously, that would be a home movie in 1992.
But in all honesty, if it's used at the right time, in the right place and in the right context,
it could be useful.
What I mainly use are the dissolves just purely because they're lovely.
Crossfade is my default.
How do I know about.
Well, I can see here because it's got a blue metal box around it.
And what that means is that the shortcut shift D or control D, depending on what you're playing to
shift works with everything.
Control D works sometimes on some clips.
So I just use shift.
But if I have these two clips and I select them, if I hit shift, it applies that transition.
The cross dissolve to all points where cross dissolve could be applied.
So crust dissolve.
Out of nothing is a fade in.
It's effectively a fade in that we go to between the two clips and we cross dissolve.
It's it's a it's crossfade.
I don't know why they don't use the term crossfade, but that's what it is.
It dissolves one to the other and then across dissolve on the end of a clip is just out.
Yeah, we're not doing anything.
It's just out to black.
However, if we get rid of that and we had, say, a color matte.
Harking back to the previous section.
I do shifts d.
It's not going to do anything.
And that's because there are already transitions in play.
And this is a different clip to this.
So how do we apply a transition to here?
But we've already said cross dissolve, drop it onto here.
My shortcut for this is to hold down control.
When I don't hold down control, we have these options.
We have to trim that way or to trim that way.
If I hold down control and I go between the two, you see how the mouse cursor changes.
If I click, that actually just highlights the clip, the clip and then clip beginning the second clip
being a column.
And if I then drag.
My cross on onto there.
That would just be the norm.
But because I've highlighted it, if I shift D, I'm telling Premiere Pro, I've highlighted these ends
of these two clips.
That's where I want to apply my default transition shift being cross dissolve and that rather than fading
to black face to light gray.
These color mats are so handy.
I mean, more handy than even I give them credit.
But anyway, back to transitions.
So we have this cross dissolve applied here and here.
What else can we use?
Well, we did it before we could have a dip to white.
Bearing in mind that if there's another transition already on this overwrites the transition, you can't
have more than one transition running on two clips.
It just wouldn't work.
So to wait, we had that before.
Again, we can change out the duration so we can have a slower dip to wait.
Almost like a dreamy sequence.
There we have film dissolve, which you see how we kept that length because we'd already set the length
on a previous transition and we just overwritten it with another transition.
If we playback film dissolve.
It's very similar to cross dissolve.
In fact, I think you'd be hard pushed.
To notice the difference.
I don't know.
I've never noticed a difference between a film dissolve and crosses off.
However, if you select any kind of transition between two clips or at the end or at the beginning of
a clip, you then will get options appear.
With regards to that transition and we've got it here starting from a and going to be it's calling this
A and this B, we always go down the alphabet as we go along the sequence.
That's not to say that another clip on here would then be C and D, because this is already B, but
then the transition that will be here will be affecting this one and this one's then this becomes a
and the next one becomes B in relation to that transition.
That makes sense.
I think it does show actual sources, doesn't really make much of a difference.
It really makes no difference to the actual thing here.
But it will make a difference in the effects controls and you can actually select where it starts.
If I tilt out now and I move it along, it will actually start dissolving in a different stage.
I'm showing you this purely to show you I've never effected any of these within the Transition Effect
Controls center at start center.
That would you see how that centered it there?
Because that's how we did it.
You could start at curtain or move it along.
It just literally moves along a little bit more.
What it does cleverly is it does actually keep although this clip isn't here, this clip is completely
taken over.
It has continued this clip playing beneath.
Just so it doesn't go straight to black.
But let me show you how that would look if it didn't do that.
If I bring that up and add my dissolve on there, it would then go to black and then bring it up.
So it is quite clever that Premiere Pro will do that and it will continue that clip playing just until
the transition is completely in.
What I mean by in is that the transition is finished whenever the transition is finished.
The next clip is 100% in morph.
Cut is really handy, although it can it can only really be used in certain circumstances.
So you have a talking head and someone is doing a bit to come in and you've had to cut it and you can't
cover it with B-roll.
That being another bit of footage over the top to hide the cut move cut can come in really handy.
It's a really good transition when you're doing product videos and you're trying to bring in different
things on a on a static shot.
But if I show you what Move Cut does here, it's a really CPU intensive transition.
And it's amazing how intensive it is when you judge just how small it looks within this whole setup.
You see how this is all such pixelate.
It's because it's trying to morph one into the other.
You see how this is also gone red.
I'm just going to pre render in there out there and control and enter just a pre render just thinking
that might not be default.
So just to double check, I'm just going to go to keyboard shortcuts and bring this over and I'm going
to type in a render.
So render into out is control enter.
That's what I have set.
Remember when we try to hit enter before and it was render effects into out.
If there are no effects it won't render, it won't pre render.
So I have this set to control enter.
I have a feeling that this wasn't the default, so you might need to set that.
But I have it control enter and it works perfectly for me.
So that's why I've done that.
I've just rendered intro right click in the grey space and clear in and out.
You don't have to do that, but it's just nice of my I, I if I playback this morph cut.
I mean, you've seen what they're trying to do and you've probably seen different music videos that
maybe have that effect.
It's quite nice.
And if you actually if we deep dive and think about it, what it does is that the beginning of the start
of the of the transition, it pauses that video so it can then morph into the next video.
It's paused, pause, paused.
And as we get to the end of the transition, we continue.
Now, this footage, it hasn't really worked too well with.
It's really quite pixelated and the two scenes are very different.
So it doesn't really show off the morph cut, but it really can be quite powerful to I, to be honest,
I don't use it half as much as what I should.
Especially if you're on YouTube and you're doing product tutorials or product reviews.
It can be really quite nice and it can be really visually attractive.
And the one thing you want to be is visually attractive when you're trying to show a product or service
and having the morph is really quite nice.
Non additive dissolve is kind of yeah.
I've never really liked that if I do a pre render because it has gone right, so it needs some form
of rendering to show it properly.
I've never liked it.
It kind of just doesn't really do anything for me.
It doesn't.
It doesn't.
But again, it depends what your project is.
It depends.
I don't know, maybe doing an absolute whacky music video and that would be exactly what you need.
So yeah, we then have immersive video, which is kind of let me just show you, I'm going to get the
gradient wipe there and VR gradient wipe and it just it's gone before it starts.
So you've always got to give a bit more.
And yeah, it does exactly what I've shown there.
You can add other things because it's a gradient wipe a gradient, any kind of gradient you can do like
a simple gradient will be say white at the top block at the bottom in a column at maybe.
And it's the gradient.
Does it gradually gradient gradually as it gradually moves from white to black.
And this is producing some form of gradient and you can actually select an image to replace the gradient.
It's it's never a transition I've ever used before.
And as a result, I don't I don't really rate it.
And these are light leaks and they're not the best light leaks in the business.
It kind of it it does what you want it to kind of but I just I've never liked the light leak built into
Premiere Pro.
We have light rays which is very similar to light leaks.
Again, these kind of things you need to drag out a little bit more.
I mean, that's again, that's very 1996.
It's really quite dated.
I'm not too sure why Adobe haven't updated their transitions in a long time.
These are the same ones that that were around when I first started playing with with Premiere Pro,
but I mean, VR random blocks.
Yeah.
Okay.
Maybe if you like again you can deep dive and maybe change it up a bit at the block width.
Brilliant.
Doesn't really do anything for me.
Random seed.
Yeah.
I mean, it's just, it's, it's, it's a non transition for me really.
We have Iris.
Iris is quite good if you like that sort of thing.
Just a nice boom.
You see how it's cut.
So let's just, let's just take a second and work out what this is doing because you could do this.
You couldn't quite yet because we haven't got into key framing.
But you can see that what this has done is it's placed this clip already playing in here like we had
before with the with the as was dissolve that was it was continuing in even though we only started at
the cut.
But what this is doing is it's, it's added a crop and then it's moving the crop out.
See, there's no actual growth here.
It's just the crop is opening up through to reveal.
The next clip.
So that's an Irish box?
Yeah, an ice box.
Ice cross does exactly the same, but it's a little bit more.
See where the crap is now, that would be quite hard to do manually.
So that's if you're looking for that, that's always good.
A diamond is the diamond shape, but you can change the board with in stuff like this.
So if you up it a little bit, you see how we've now got a kind of stroke and you can then change the
colour if that's the kind of thing you wanted to do.
So we have that.
I mean, that's it's not necessarily my, my taste or my style, but that's quite a powerful thing to
have in Premiere Pro.
That's quite nice.
Still, it's been around since it kind of began.
And then we have Iris Round, which is more like an iris, which I think was the the genesis of the
iris effects.
And then they just changed the shape.
You see how halfway through we are at a pretty much a complete circle and then we come back past, then
out the boundaries to reveal at the end.
These can all be used in the right circumstance.
Page Pale is an page turn, a kind of what you'd expect them to be?
I don't know.
I think it could be done better.
Page ten is the same, but it's more like a fold and coming down.
I mean, it is clever because you're seeing the reflection of.
This here where you can see a pergola or pergola and you can see that coming down.
And is if you look at the actual video, it has flipped it around to show it in reverse on the other
side of the page.
But it doesn't really impressed me, the ones that a lot of people use push.
So you can push it to one side.
If you want to drive on the story, you can also change the direction.
So say that's pushing to the left.
If we highlight it and click here, we want it to push to the right.
But this is a very linear movement.
And by linear I mean it starts and it stops.
There's no it's it's what we call easing in in graphic design, emotion design.
And it's it's where you kind of you start slow, you ramp up speed, and then you slowly slow down again.
It's those little things that you don't necessarily notice and your audience don't notice.
But when you have something other than a linear movement, it just shows it that little bit better.
And if you have it's these again, it's these little attention to detail.
And when you have them and you have a number of them in one project, it just levels up.
The quality slide is very similar to push in as much as you see how rather than push where everything
moves, you see how a is moving off and B is moving in.
If you have slide one, just slides over the top again, that's going to the right.
You can have it going to the left if you want.
So these are manipulator all is that word within the effects controls as well.
If you haven't noticed already, the effects controls panel is a really, really important part of Premiere
Pro.
Just a couple more splits is exactly that split from the center and you can have it going.
Top to bottom as well.
Just by making sure you've highlighted this and selecting the different arrows, which denotes the direction
of this particular transition and whip.
Finally, within the slide section.
It's kind of like it's a movement.
It's kind of like a push, but it also has kind of a motion blur in there as well.
Yeah, it doesn't really do anything for me, WIP.
I mean, as you can see, there are so many here.
Band WIP is a really old effect.
But it works.
And people still use it.
They really do.
Fondos exactly what you think.
It's just a center split, but it's called bond doors.
In the the industry, it's so it's so strange.
Venetian blinds which is a real, real hark back to 1980s cinema.
And they used to drag out that kind of transition.
And I'm going through these new for numerous reasons.
One is almost like a walk down memory lane for me, but also to to show you how easy it is to be able
to switch out of transition and and try different transitions and see what works for you across Zoom.
I mean, that's probably the most impressive one that you could do.
I mean, it's not always to be used.
Two.
Let's use that as my way of going to the next bit, because as I said, I was going to talk about some
plug ins and this one is free.
And the transitions that I show you are within the free starter packs.
You'll never have to pay for it and you can use it whatever you want.
But let's take that cross zoom.
Now, you may think that that's impressive.
That effectively zooms in and then zooms out.
Okay.
Let's get rid of that.
And without explaining anything, I'm just going to show you this.
And then we'll get to the point where I'll show you what I'm talking about.
A quick restart there.
And this is premier composer.
So we did into our camera zoom.
Into it.
So not only do we have a transition, we also have a sound.
Let's just leave the sound up for now.
Play ahead where it needs to be right between the two clips and at.
Now, let me just disable that for now and let's just show you that cross zoom again.
And now let's compare that to this.
Now, that may not look like much, but that's got easing in there.
It's everything.
If we drag that out a little bit, just like we did the other transitions.
But that for me is just, oh, I love it.
Also, we can have a sound.
I will explain this very, very shortly.
But now we've got the sound and a little bit of sound design goes a long way.
I told us that.
Now let's get rid of that.
And rather than an intro, let's just do a simple zoom in.
And this is when a zoom transition can really come into its own.
Oh, good luck.
Absolutely.
Love it.
But say you don't want to zoom.
You want a pan.
So, like, move to the side.
Okay.
Let's just turn off the sounds for now.
I'm going to pan and I'm going to go pan left.
I'm going to include sound.
I'm going to add, I don't I don't think you'll realize just how lucky you are to be in a time when
these things are available.
That literally was one click to select it and one click to add it, another click to say, Yeah, add
sound.
And that's that effect right there, that single effect which could not be duplicated and just made
into a single click effect that used to take between ten and 15 minutes.
When you got fast to be able to do that, it's just, Oh, I love it.
I'm going to spend some time on Premiere Composer later on in the course.
It's by a company called Mr. Horse, and you've probably already noticed, but there are a series of
links at the bottom of the worksheet, and those are external links that I have collated to include
the things that we're talking about, and they're things that I really value as a professional videographer,
professional editor in the industry for well over seven years.
I think it's actually eight.
I don't really want to admit that because it kind of gives away my age at least, maybe slightly.
But yeah, and I use them on a day to day basis and I use at least one element, if not more in all
of my projects.
So any plug ins that I include with you will be so useful to you.
Transitions can make or break a product, a project.
It can it can elevate what you're doing to a whole new level.
But I can't stress enough.
You don't always need a transition.
A simple clip going into another clip is timeless.
It's classic.
You only use a transition when you need to.
And again, I can't stress this enough.
If you feel the story is being told, not just fine, but as good as it can be without transition.
Don't feel you need to put a transition in there.
You don't always need to.
You really don't.
But if you do, make sure your transitions are good quality.
I'm just going to do one more and this is going to touch on what we looked at before.
Here's this.
Horrible, horrible.
Lately.
I mean, that's going from pink and magenta all the way through to green and cyan and it's absolutely
awful.
I know it seems like I'm bashing Premiere Pro.
I don't mean to that, but there are certain areas where they've really, really improved in recent
years, and then there's some areas that they've literally done nothing.
And it's probably because there are so many free solutions out there that they don't really feel the
need to and they're concentrating on the nitty gritty of it.
But yet again, that is an awful light leak.
Like get rid of that, get my play head right the big, get the middle and let's have a look.
I like links.
I'm just going to move this out a little bit so we can kind of see and that's probably the one I want.
I've got that sound here.
Again, this isn't a deep dive into premiere composer.
We will do that shortly, but there's no sound with the like.
But if I add that and we're done, and if I go in and out.
How nice is that?
I mean, that's just so much better.
That's a light.
Like, if I go into organic light leaks, these like these are perfect for beauty.
I mean, they're so perfect for beauty.
This one within organic.
I've used this on countless beauty shoots for clients for for beauty clients in the industry.
You may have seen a number of adverts on TV that actually have this because I know that because I produced
the video and I mean, it's just it's just effortless.
And you can change the tent.
It's like, here's a tent here that says it's blue.
We could change it to horrible, garish green.
We could get even closer to what Premiere Pro was.
But you see how this is staying.
Orange is because it's around the edges.
See how the around the edges is giving the green.
You may be able to see in this kind of footage.
But yeah, this is such a better light leak than the ones that come built in.
But again, we will we will look at that in a future, future video.
But that is the start and the basics of transitions.
I'm very briefly going to go in the next section talking about your default transition and how to decide
what your default transition is.
And if it's not the one that set us stuck.
How to make it your Default Transition.


### 2. Understanding Default Transitions

So finally on this section with regards to transitions, we're going to look at default transitions
and I've touched on it previously, but just to nail exactly what I mean by default transitions, this
right here is a transition as we already know that's across dissolve now to apply that quickly rather
than going to effects finding cross dissolve and dragging on to here control Z to undo, I can quite
simply select that end shift date and I know that it's going to have to cross dissolve because we have
the blue box around here.
There's no blue box around depth to black or additive resolve or even band wipe.
But let's say whatever realm you decided that band wipe was to be your default transition, we can quite
simply make that your default transition by right clicking and set selected as default transition.
And now no longer do we have a blue box around cross dissolve.
We now have a blue box around band wipe.
So if we do the same, select the end shift D that now has given us a default transition which is band
white.
I don't want that.
Let's go back to Cross Dissolve.
But there are a couple of other things, or at least one of the thing you need to note with regards
to defaults, and that is the length of time of that transition.
Let's just apply the default transition again and go to the end.
Look here, we're in 25 frames.
Remember when we set up our sequence?
I think the setting is 1920 by 1080 or 69 and it's 25, 25 frames a second.
This counter is frames, seconds, minutes and hours.
So our default transition is ten frames.
Let's say we wanted to change that.
All we have to do is go to edit.
Preferences.
I would go straight into general.
And go to timeline in here.
It shows you the default durations for your video transition, an audio transition which we haven't
touched on yet and is still image default duration.
Now the still image default duration is when you drag on any image or it also includes color maps.
Just to prove that it's defaulted.
It's 12 frames.
Let's just go back in and track in that light gray.
And as you can see.
Right ten frames and we are still with the climate.
If we go to the end of it 12 frames.
So your default image duration includes color maps, any kind of graphics that you drag in here, whether
it be vector graphics, whether it be a Photoshop file, because they all work they all work in the
Adobe Suite.
And you can you can manipulate them in different ways depending on what you're using.
But obviously you can then drag this out.
Same with the default transition duration.
It's set as ten, but you can drag that out.
But let's say your during your editing process, you feel a need a longer and you know, you're you're
adding transitions.
You think every single time I'm adding a transition, I'm needing more time in that transition.
Well, this is where you change it.
Edit preferences and you go down to timeline.
You can go edit preferences and then go straight to timeline.
But I just hit General and then just find it and we can change it.
So you can change it from frames 2 seconds and obviously 25 frames.
If I went into that not too injured of what if I that be a long transition but say we go from 25 frames
we could then drop it 2 seconds and that obviously defaults as 1/2 because we're in 25 frames per second
sequence.
Similarly, we can change the still duration.
Let's say to 1/2, I'm pretty sure it used to be 1/2 on mine.
I've reset my settings since, so that's okay and let's see how that affects.
So that's let's just leave the play head where it was.
So that's where the end of the default transition used to be.
Now if I select the end and shift D, we're now all the way up to 1/2.
So as you can see with this, it's a slower transition in not only that, but if we applied it here,
we'd now rather than be five frames this way and five frames that way, making up the ten frames, we're
now a full second between.
The transition.
For me a second is too long, but let's just carry on.
We were at 12 frames where we not for the for the column.
By the way, when you're within a sequence on the timeline, right and left on your cursor, we'll go
forward and back a frame up and down goes to the end of the clips, but that's only if it's selected.
Let's bring up another clip here.
Make it shorter just to show that if I deselect or toggle off that target, if I press down, it still
goes to the end of this clip here.
If that was toggled on, I go, oop, that goes to the end of that clip.
And just showing going down, it goes to the end of that clip.
That's really it's an easy one to get wrong.
And it's such a great and powerful way to quickly go through your footage.
If you don't want to skip dialing in exactly what you want your default transition to be and how long
you want it to be can really speed up your workflow.
Let me show you, for instance, let's say these are obviously two different clips and let's say we
have another two different clips and maybe another and then maybe another also.
And you've got all these and you think, Oh.
I'd like to view it back, but I'd like to view it all back with the default transition.
That's really quite simple to do in here.
With your default transition, we hold down control, remember from the previous section and draw a
marquee.
And rather than if I did hold down control, it would select everything.
But if I hold the control and draw market over.
All of a sudden we have engaged and selected just the ends of the clips.
If I hit Shift D, it applies the transition to each and every one of those ends.
So then just with literally one click, you've got the default transitions running all the way through
the sequence.
That's why deciding on a knowing what your default transition is and the duration of that default transition
can really help you out.
The annoying thing, which is what I really wish.
I really wish Adobe would sort this out but say I've held down shift and I've selected a number of transitions,
all these cross transitions here.
If I pull out one, it only affects that one.
That's frustrating, but maybe that will change in a future bug fix.
I don't think it's a bug, but I do think it would be something that I would love to add.
So yeah, dialing in your default transition duration is really important and understanding how to apply
it can save you a lot of time.
Next up, we're on to audio.
