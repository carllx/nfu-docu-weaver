## Hylomorphism
 [[Aristotle]] 有一个著名的论点，即每个physical object都是 **Matter** 和 **Form** 的复合体。这一学说被称为 "hylomorphism"(同态)，是希腊语中物质（hulê）和形式（eidos或morphê）的组合词。亚里士多德的hylomorphism对中世纪哲学的发展有很大影响，在当代形而上学(contemporary [[metaphysics]])中也得到了一些复兴。


## Platonic solids
Plato's development of Platonic solids is significant because he associated them with the four classical elements (earth, air, water, and fire) and the fifth element (aether) that he believed composed the physical world². He also used them to explain the structure and harmony of the cosmos in his dialogue Timaeus².

Platonic solids have some significance for the theory of shape and shapeless, which is part of Plato's theory of forms⁶. According to this theory, the physical world is not as real or true as timeless, absolute, unchangeable ideas, or forms, that are the essences of all things⁴⁶. The physical world is only a shadow, or image, of the true reality of the realm of forms⁴.

Plato's theory of forms implies that there is a form of shape, which is the perfect and eternal idea of shape, and that all physical shapes are imperfect and changing imitations of this form⁶. Similarly, there is a form of shapeless, which is the idea of the absence of shape, and that all physical things that lack shape are imitations of this form⁶. Platonic solids, as regular and symmetrical polyhedra, are closer to the form of shape than other irregular and asymmetrical shapes, and therefore more real and true in Plato's view²⁶.
