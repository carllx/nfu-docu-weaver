## 01-01 Course introduction

- Hi everyone, this is
Pierrick from P2 Design.

I'm so happy to welcome you to Alive!,

the animation course in Blender.

In this training course,
we will learn the tools,

the fundamentals, and principle

while manipulating and animating.

As any other art form, you
won't get good at animation

by watching video tutorials.

You do need to practice
as much as possible.

I'm here to teach you my best practices

to help to learning and
improving your animation skills.

Videos are shot to offer the
best learning experience.

I advise you to watch each video once

and then rewatch them and follow along.

Each chapter will focus
on a specific theme,

principle, or level of animation.

Whatever your skill level,

I advise you to take this
course from the beginning,

because they are big chances
you will learn something,

or at least it will
refresh your animator mind.

In the next video,

I will go through the current
content of the course,

but the course will be also updated

and I will add the more
content through free updates.

The course come with a ball rig,

a little police squirrel character rig,

a Battle mech rig,

and the character Trident.

You are free to use those rig

for your non-commercial projects.

You can post any of the
animation you will do

with those characters on your social media

or for your portfolio,

but you can't use these rigs
or any content of the course

for commercial project.

And you must not re-distribute
or share any of the content

of the course, whether it's
Blende file or video files.

The course come with the
documentation where you will find

the list of all the videos included.

The difficulty level of each
chapter will be defined,

my freestyle level.

One star is beginner,

two star intermediate, and
three star is advanced.

You will also find links to the
different external resources

use in this course.

And they will be labeled
in a yellow color.

The video labeled in blue are theoretical

and tools focused video.

So I advise you to watch them
all and come back to them

often so that you don't miss any detail.

Let's jump into the next video
and see what's the content of

the course.




------------------------

## 01-02 Course content and how to use it
﻿1
- [Instructor] In this video,

we will have a quick look
at the course content

and how to use it.

At this stage, you should have
downloaded all the content.

You will find a read-me file

that I invite you to read

with some legal informations.

And for each chapter, you
will find a zipped file

or multiple zipped files.

I suggest you unzip those
chapters in a specific folder.

The zipped file will
include all the videos

but also all the English
subtitles of those videos.

One of the zip provided
include all the course files.

You must unzip those file
in the dedicated folder.

Simply right click on the zip file

and choose Extract to
course files folders.

You will find a dedicated folder

for each chapter of the course.

And those dedicated folders
includes all the Blender files,

textures and whatever
resource you will need

during those chapters.

It's important to keep the structure

and hierarchy of those folders

as it is in the zipped file

because of the most files are linked

or are sourcing textures
with a relative path

into those folder.

You will find one Blender file

or multiple Blender file
per lecture or lesson.

This way you can choose whether to start

from the beginning with your own animation

or to use one of the provided file at,

or to use one of the provided file

at a given point in time.

You will also find video reference

for the specific exercises,

and any other resources
used by the Blender file.

Let's have a quick look
through the course contents.

Two is a must-watch

because this is where you will learn

how Blender deals with data.

And since your job will
be to animate those data,

you'd better be aware of how it works.

This is also the chapter

where you will have your first experience

with the animation tool

and how to read and use them.

The graph editor is often confusing

for beginners animator,

so it's very important that
you watch those videos.

This way you'll be prepared
to jump into chapter three.

It's the most extensive
chapter of the course

where you will learn how
to use an armature rig

to perform your first
simple polished animation,

to manipulate your first character,

create a full set of animations,

and then combine them to
reproduce this short animation.

If you're a beginner

or have a bit of experience
animating in Blender,

then I advise you to
follow this whole chapter

and do the exercises multiple time

until you get comfortable.

I will repeat this a lot during the course

but animation is an art form.

Failing is totally normal,

and only practice will make you progress.

In chapter four, we will focus

on learning other animation technique.

We will create a new set of animation

using this robot rig.

And we will see how we can use constraints

and space switching

to generate additional
motion onto our character,

getting convincing result
in a matter of minutes.

We will apply this to a walk cycle,

this artillery shot

and also to shoot rockets
from a moving robot.

This way, you will be able

to reproduce all the
animation in this short movie.

And for those of you eager to learn

how to create the FXs and the environment,

I've already published

and will published
additional tutorials for free

on my YouTube channel regarding
those specific subjects.

In chapter five and six,

you will be introduced
to character locomotion

and body mechanics

through fully detailed lessons

on how to build a run
cycle and a walk cycle.

We will go deeper into reference analysis,

and I will try to teach you

how to correctly study your reference

and get the best from them.

From there, I will guide you

through the whole blocking stage,

'til the final polishing.

In chapter seven, I will
teach you all my techniques

to get great poses

from deep reference analysis

to stylization technique
to push your poses

and the appeal of your
character way further.

Finally, in chapter eight,

the most advanced chapter,

you will apply all what you have learned

during the course to create
this combo animation.

And I'll be there over eight hours

of video to teach you everything

from the base blocking

to creating the breakdowns,

the blocking plus, the
first pass of spline

to the final polishing stage,

and adding some details and FXs

so that you can create a great

and polished animation that you'll be able

to proudly feature in your
demo reel or portfolio.

## 01-03 Advised ressources
﻿1
- [Instructor] Before
we jump into animation,

I'd like to show you my table.

It's made of some exotic wood

and it's very useful too.

Nope, it's not a course about table

but I'd like to show you some resources

that could be useful.

The first one is obviously
"The Animator's Survival Kit"

by Richard Williams.

This is a classic.

I guess all the animators have
this book in their shelves,

and to be perfectly
honest, it doesn't get old.

But you will find in there tons

of lesson about the
principles of animation

and so many drawings that
are still used to this date

to teach animation.

It also comes with a lot of stories

about animation a few decades ago.

But definitely, a must-have.

The next book, which is one

of my favorite is "Drawn to
Life" by Walt Stanchfield.

This is a book that was recommended to me

by my animation mentor, Jeremy Collins,

and while it's mostly focused on drawing,

everything in there is
appliable to animation,

especially when it comes to staging

and creating great poses.

The last book I'd like
to advise is a classic.

It's "The Illusion of Life"

from Frank Thomas and Ollie Johnston.

Beyond the educational content,

it's fascinating to learn stories

about Disney, the studio that
has almost created animation.

While you don't need those book,

I do believe that having them

and reading them will really help you

to dive into the art of animation.

There are tons of quality book
about animation and drawing,

and it's always good to get a step back

from the screen and take
a good book and chill.

I'd like to recommend
you also a YouTube video

by Alan Becker about the

It has more than eight million of views,

and this is definitely because
it's one of the best video

about the 12 principle of animation.

It's short, super well
illustrated and explained.

A must-watch.

And finally, I truly advise
you to use SyncSketch.

SyncSketch is an online media player

that allows you to read
almost every video format,

and allows you to draw on screen,

to leave notes and to create
reviews and share them.

Definitely one of the best
platform to share your reviews

or get feedback from other animators.

This is the tool I use every day

for all my reviews,

and also in this course

whenever I'm analyzing any reference.

If you're looking for an offline solution,

I advise you Keyframe Pro media player.

You can get a free version of it.

There is also a paid version of it

with additional functionalities,

but personally, I prefer
to use SyncSketch.
