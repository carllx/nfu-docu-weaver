Transcript:
(00:04) all right welcome back to another touched he's an editorial and this is the first one where you actually kind of see me and probably also the last one and yeah today we're gonna look at slit scanning and I've prepared this little network here and yeah I've been greatly inspired by recent Instagram posts like this is nothing new but yeah kind of a lot of people have been posting this kind of technique lately and mostly this guy called Francois voce I don't know and yeah he's got a lot of cool artworks dealing with kind of slit scanning and
(00:48) time warping and that kind of stuff and we're gonna look at something a bit similar to this and yeah I think he's working with after After Effects we're gonna work with touch designer yeah maybe also have a look at what slit scanning actually is on the Wikipedia or somewhere else and as you can see down here just is pretty much the effect we're going for all right so I am I can also recommend you watch the the video on slit scanning by Tall JB I'm gonna link that because it's kind of how I learned slit scanning I guess but this
(01:28) is a like is a similar technique but also yeah a bit different I guess so alright I'm gonna work with like we're gonna work with our webcam or it also works with any movie file or any kind of noise or anything that moves pretty much all right so I'm gonna go go ahead and delete this and we're actually gonna start with a movie file in because I don't want to see myself the whole time so let's just take a some kind of movie something that's moving because they're all not it's not actually not very great movie examples
(02:12) cuz they're not moving a lot anyways let's start with a fit top attach to this because I really know that my webcam is quite a weird resolution so I'm gonna just have it fit into at st. 1280 by 720 and let's set the fit to fit outside so nothing changes because this is the same resolution as to fit but it's gonna change for the webcam let's then add a null here and we're gonna and go from here so I'm gonna attach a composite here and this actually needs to be a composite because we we're gonna use more than one input and I'm gonna
(02:58) set this to over more than two inputs I mean okay so let's add a rectangle now or actually before that that's at the end here I'm gonna add a level I transform and I know okay so I just did that by holding shift down okay so I would have a BG here as always like a just a null called BG from tone turning the display on for and I'm gonna change the Alpha to 1 and turn the comp over background color on I'm gonna get back to the level later this is just for kind of post-processing alright so back to the rectangle here let's change its Y to
(03:51) 1 and the size 2.0 free and let's go to the fit top - its comment page and right click on a resolution here say copy parameter and pass that on here because we want to want to have the same resolution here as the fit okay now we can add a multiply here and down in here just switch these around it looks better alright so this is pretty much what's lit scanning is doing that you have kind of a slit that you're looking through and only what you see there kind of appears so you only see like a part of the image as big a distance lit yep so
(04:45) what we want to do now is we want to move this current frame here too to one of these sides what if there are two sites that exist so either X minus or X plus so I wouldn't how do we do that we use a feedback so let's add a composite here again and let's change the operation to over and let's add a feedback here and a transform to that and let's add the transform again into the composite here now we can actually just put that in here and on here changed the order and now on the transform we can or let's actually first
(05:38) let's direct as composite onto the feedback and on the transform that's now changed just to like minus point zero zero one and there we go there you are you have your kind of slitscan already working so we're kind of just always going from the middle going to the to the left right now because we're going we're saying go - and the thing is you can't can't really see that right now I'm gonna show you what the video device then I'm going to show myself now there em and as you can see now this is like a weird format it's like us I mean
(06:14) it's not that weird it's just 640 by 400 it's just a low not weird anyways and I'll fit that into here and so I can work with it better as you can see it's kind of this this effect I mean this also looks nice but it's kind of like distorting like displacing this and I don't actually want that to happen so to do not have that happening just select these two and set them to nearest pixel on the common page so as you can see now we have a much nicer at scanning effect going on okay so that's basically it actually that's that's really kind of
(06:57) the effect that we're going for and now I showed you in the beginning that this was kind of going to both sides and actually before I before I do that I'm gonna add a flip in here or insert a flip and trying to flip backs on because I want to because it kind of makes more sense I feel like because my otherwise it's mirrored and it's a bit weird just just see if that feels good for you okay so in the beginning I had had this going to both sides so I'm just doing that with having by having two feedback loops so I'm just gonna
(07:39) actually before I do that I'm gonna add a transform here and I'm going to shift this a bit to the left so interested just a tiny bit actually more take point so you were free something like that so it's just a bit shift drifted to the left here and yeah before I show you the second loop let's look at the speed of this so we can just change this to like 0.
(08:17) 2 and yeah now it's going there faster it's also a nice effect that you can also can fit past as you can see all the different slits in there so it's kind of like having a words resolution so to counter this you can go to the rectangle and maybe turn up the softness here to like oops point zero two and then it's like slightly blurred and you can see them a bit less and it still it just doesn't look that great anymore you could also turn this off and might just make this let's size just smaller as you can see you know these slits here are like yeah
(08:57) smaller can make them even even smaller I mean yeah you can still kind of see the the slits going on and I generally just recommend setting this to to be kind of slower it just makes for a nicer effect okay now we're you know that let's just select all of these so these five operators and copy and paste them in here and let's change this to let's actually just go to this transform right click on this say copy parameter and pasta in here pass the reference in here and just put a minus in front and them just inverts that so now this rectangle
(09:45) is kind of shifted to the left this one is kind of shifted to the right at the exact same amount okay so now we can go to the transform here and take this minus away and go maybe to both of these and pull stem both these feedbacks and now if I direct us and and go to the comp and change the order you can now see there's only like a slight like a slight original picture of me in the in the center that's just kind of the the arranged between this and this rectangle and then we have like slits going to the left and so that's
(10:29) going to the right so now you can do some weird stuff here which is actually quite a lot of fun to play with like yeah I've been sitting in front of this longer than I want to admit anyways so so yeah that's that's the basic setup you can really go crazy with how you place these you can use circles you can use anything this is just like a like a basic set up just one example of how to do this so be creative for fence please okay you can see my laughs anyways so I'm gonna show you a few more things that can now you can make this even more
(11:12) interesting one of them being you can just add a displace here I always love working with displaces and you can just displace it by itself so it's pretty extreme I'm going to set the Y to zero and I'm gonna set the X to like a point zero three point zero two you can see this makes for a really weird trippy effect and yes it's pretty neat so yeah cool stuff and the other thing is one of the like just working with a time machine pretty much and it's one of the slitscan techniques that told presented in his video that is linked in the description
(12:05) so for that we're gonna use a I'm gonna bypass the time at the displace for that we're gonna need a texture for ye so I'm gonna add a texture for D top in here just looks like this and I'm not gonna change the the cache or anything cashy still not sure how to pronounce that and I'm gonna add a time machine and then I'm gonna put that in here so we're gonna see our texture free D now because we need a second input here and that is actually like we're gonna use a ram for that so I want the ramp to be the same resolution so I can can I just
(12:52) don't know let's go back to fit and right click in here copy this parameter and past that and here okay and now I want this to be vertical and we can just put that in here and now as you can see like we have this weird kind of warping effect and when you change like the ramp here it's gonna be it different so it's actually quite a lot of fun as well to play with so you can like nicely combine these together and use the displace on them and you have some really crazy effect just with your webcam and yeah looks super weird
(13:41) all right and you can obviously change the order of this and all so it's okay a different kind of looking effect yeah I on the level here is just really for you know adjusting the level like the brightness and contrasts on the thing nothing fancy yeah that's pretty much it I hope you enjoyed this tutorial and as I said please be creative with this there's a lot of different appliances for this applications I don't know and yeah have fun mostly so I'll see you all in the next video
