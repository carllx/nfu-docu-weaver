## 25 Transitions
### 1. Introduction

By now.
We know how to make transitions inside Premiere Pro, but it's a lot more than just cutting a clip and
taking in a transition from the Internet.
Transitions can change the emotion of your audience.
They can sometimes give a different energy from your video.
The length of your cuts, the amount of graphics, the type of cut.
These things are all going to help convey your message through your video.
So it's really important to know what your transitions mean and when you should use a certain type of
transition in editing.
Transition is how you go from video a into video.
There are thousands of ways out there.
Some use animations and others can use some really interesting effects.
So let's start with some basic knowledge.
When you're dealing with a simple video such as the interview and the transitions that you're doing
aren't that crazy.
By simple transitions, I mean things that aren't that complicated, such as a simple cut, a fade,
a dissolve.
CROSSFADE And things that just aren't that distracting when you see them.
So these simple transitions are used when you want the audience to really pay attention to what is being
said and you want them to focus.
So this can be an interview, a short film, a sad film, and others.
You don't want the audience to get too excited.
You don't want them to feel the tension.
So if you have a really sad scene between two people, you don't want to put like a 3-D rotate transition
because the focus will be lost and the audience will now be distracted by the three D transition.
So let's take a look at an example.
This is an interview between two people, and I want you guys to pay attention to the transitions and
when these transitions are being made.
Here.
We have an interview.
There's nothing crazy going on.
There is, like a battle scene.
It's just two people talking to each other.
Well, DC Harry Potter totally, isn't it?
Yeah.
I feel like it unlocks for people something from their childhood, something that feels so, so deep
inside them and like something that they've always known.
It has a level of familiarity that is just so intense and special.
When I talk about prep and whatever else it was like in the build up to the movie, I really felt the
pressure of that, not just from me loving those films, but knowing how much this character means to
so to so many people.
What was it you didn't?
So they're in one room, but we get many different cuts from other angles.
Notice how the transitions were just the simple cut.
There was no fade, no dissolve, no no 3D animations.
It was just a simple cut from video A into video B.
Now notice how halfway they bring a scene from something that is not happening in that interview room.
So we get some shots from the Beauty and the Beast animation and this is happening Mid-interview Now,
here's something about video editing.
You always have two types of clips.
One is your a role and one is your B role.
A role is your primary video B role is your supplementary video.
So with your primary video, it's basically what your entire clip is about.
So if it's an interview, every clip that has the two people talking is considered an a role.
But a scene like this, like this animation or a scene of some trees and whatever else that the people
are talking about, these are considered B roles, meaning that they're just there to complement the
roles and they're not as important as the roles in this example.
This is a B role, and all of these guys where there's the interview happening are considered roles.
So with videos like this, you're always switching between roles and big roles, but the event is just
constantly there.
So throughout this whole thing, the voice of these two people are there just to avoid people getting
bored from the interview.
They're going to add in these roles and complement the speech of these two people.
So again, we get a clip from outside the interview room, and this is constant throughout the entire
interview.
This kind of technique is also common in travel vlogs, where the person giving commentary is the role,
and these and all of these beautiful scenes are considered roles.
So we got some roles.
Until the subject comes in and talks about their trip in Switzerland.
So in these videos, we don't want anyone to get distracted with graphics, 3-D designs and all that.
You want people to be focused on what's happening inside the video and therefore it's really important
to not use dramatic transitions.
On the other hand, there are some situations where you want to use dramatic transitions.
An example where you want to use these dramatic transitions is on music videos.
So here I have a music video by this person and the music is pretty hype and the person who edited this
wants to make sure that the audience stay pumped with the music and with all the graphics.
So let's take a look at the go and blow a bag instead of real you want on that block.
When I see what's going on, I won't worry about the other side when that -- was going on.
And we don't hang with different --.
No, that's what we own the only time.
So notice all the glitch, all the zooms, the turns and all that.
They are happening at a really fast rate, which as we learned, creates tension and gives our audience
adrenaline.
So in music videos, especially when the music is like not peaceful and mellow, you're going to see
a lot of these transitions and a lot of really cool techniques can be found in these types of videos.
So once in a while, just go watch your favorite rappers music videos and you're going to find really
cool effects -- on drums.
That's the city thing I hate.
The -- would be trying to swish the block up.
I'll be with the Killers.
So these types of transitions where you get really fast stuff and you get more graphics than usual are
quite common inside music videos.
So imagine you have this really awesome song, but you're just looking at a picture of a flower.
You're going to get bored and and probably click away because you're just listening to music and not
really watching anything.
So reserved d really intense transitions for videos where you want to build adrenaline.
On the other hand, we have videos where you want to have long transitions.
So something good is happening in this scene, but we don't want people to get really tense for it.
So the transitions are really simple and they're just cuts.
So moving forward with the lessons we're going to learn about a lot of different transitions, some
of them being rather mellow, other ones being really intense and graphic.
And then by the end of this category, you're going to know what type of transmissions you need to use
for your video.
So without further ado, let's learn about different types of cuts.


### 2. Types of Cuts in Editing

So let's learn about all the different cuts that we use during editing.
These cuts will be really important moving forward.
You're going to have to use them and depending on what's happening inside the video, you would have
to choose the right cut.
The first cut is the base of every other cut, and that is when we just do a simple split.
We have used this cut a lot in the previous lessons.
And I will show you an example in our poem Video Lesson.
#### 1. Hard Cut
So all of these cuts that we did are considered hard cuts.
There's nothing going on.
We just cut from video A to video B, and this is great for videos where you want people to remain calm
and focused on what's happening inside the video.
So this type of cut is used in almost every video out there, whether it's a high music video, a sad
movie, happy movie, action film.
These are really good because people can stay focused on the dialogue, let's say, or just the narration.
So in this example, we had someone read poetry, and I wanted people to just listen to that poetry
and just get these supplementary cuts, which, as we learned, are called B roles.
So if I did some crazy transition in this poem video, you would not be focused on what the narration
is saying, but you would be distracted and focused on this really intense transition.
So let's see what that would look like.
Go to the effects menu and I'm going to look for a transition.
I'm going to grab like an Irish cross.
So this is what the transition looks like.
Now we're going to see this in our poem video.
So I got every audio track there to take my despair, but I hear no response.
So as you saw, that was pretty distracting and it was really random.
And this is something you definitely want to avoid because in editing, you don't want to just show
off with your transition skills when the time is not appropriate.
So these types of transitions are usually seen in like.
A basic photo collage and they're not really use in professional setting unless it's for something special
or something comedic.
Otherwise, you don't want to use a cut that is too distracting when your video is calm and peaceful.
So let's get rid of that and stick with these simple cuts.
So we had the simple cut in the poem video, the commercial video that we did.
Then you can use it in every situation.
#### 2. Jump Cut
The second type of cut is called the jump cut, and you create some sort of variation within your entire
clip.
So let's go here and grab a talking video like this.
We have a video of these two people just talking.
And let's say this video was like 20 minutes long.
You don't want to just stare at two people talking that whole 20 minutes.
So one strategy was to use B rolls.
I'll get into that in a second.
But another strategy to keep the audience engaged during this video is to use jump cuts.
So we're going to go through here.
We're going to make a cut.
Keep the video going for a little bit.
Make the cuts again.
And we're just going to zoom in in this one video section.
So let's scale it up by like one 30%.
And we're going to get something like this.
You have probably seen this cut a lot in YouTube videos, gaming videos, and just something where there's
a lot of narration.
Now, what comes after the jump?
Depends on what type of video you're making.
If it's a professional, let's say, interview, you would want to change the angles of the video.
But if it's like a YouTube clip, that's not as important since people just watch it for entertainment
purposes.
Jump cuts can also be used in a recording, for example, here.
Let's say the subjects did something wrong.
You can just cut that bit out, causing another jump Cut.
So you can either use jump cuts to hide your mistakes or just get rid of a section that you do not want.
Or create variation in a video that is just long and not as entertaining.
Jump cuts are quite common in montages, too.
Let's say we have this montage of someone just boxing for a really long time, and in montages they
create a lot of jump cuts.
I'm going to make some random cuts here.
Then this can show that this person has been practicing all day long and the time has passed.
Again, sometimes you may want to scale this in so there's more variation.
Maybe zoom in onto his bicep, zoom in on to a clock in the back, and just show that this character
has been practicing for a very long time.
So that was our second cut.
#### 3. Action cut
The third cut is when you cut exactly on a certain motion.
So this is referred to as the action cut.
So I have two clips of boxers and I grab them right in.
And you're just looking for a set of motion.
So in this case, it would be this person punching.
Look for motion blur.
Make a cut right there with command, K, control K on windows, and then go to your second clip.
Look for a punch that has a motion blur.
Now, here we're getting some light changes.
So because it's called an action cut, you would want to do it on some sort of action.
It doesn't necessarily have to be sports or like cars.
It could also be like someone waving their hands, someone walking, someone jumping, just any sort
of movement that involves motion blur.
You would want to keep that for this type of transition.
So this type of cut can show that the action is constant and there was no pauses.
So if I have different clips of people boxing, cutting on the punches that they do, I can keep the
action going without any interruptions.
So here's another example.
When both of the subjects are kind of bending over, ducking a punch.
Because they had motion blur both of the videos.
This is considered an action cut.
Our next two cuts are the cut and the cut.
This type of cut is something we have used quite a lot in the previous lessons, especially in the poem
Beauty Lesson, where we learned about vocal sound design.
Beginning with the card it is when you introduce the audio from video to into video one.
So you're kind of showing a sneak peek of that scene when it's not even on screen.
Now let me show you what that looks like.
So here is an example of a cat.
You have a video where there's people talking and then a video of the seagulls flying in the air.
But we begin to hear the seagulls sound effect on this video.
So this is video one.
This is video two.
But the audio begins on video one.
This is our audio.
So before we can see the seagulls on screen, we can hear their voice.
So if you take a look right here, these are the three videos that we're dealing with.
So it's called a GE cut because of the sheep.
This is the top and this is the bottom.
This is a cut.
When you introduce the audio of the second clip into the first clip.
This is used quite a lot in dialogue videos or just videos where people are speaking.
Used for sound effect purposes like this, or just when you want to switch between a a role and a bureau.
So that's what a Jacob is.
Now, the opposite of a cut is called the cut.
That is when the audio from video one continues into video two.
We had this in the the same project.
So this right here is an El cut.
So the first video ends here, but the audio continues even after it has finished.
So this is the first video.
You can see that the audio is stretching out onto video number two.
This is called an EL cut and the shape is pretty much like an EL.
Let's play this back.
So before we see video two, we're getting the audio from video one.
This is used quite often in almost every video, especially when you're dealing with sound effects.
Using cuts and cuts can introduce audio in a smoother way.
It's really important that you ease the audio in instead of just showing it out of nowhere.
You don't want the audience to get startled by a new audio and instead you want them to kind of slowly
get introduced as to what's going to happen in the next clip, either using a cut to introduce the concept
of the second video when the audience is still on the first video, or use an lke to let the audio from
video one linger onto video two.
So these two cuts are one of the most important cuts out there, and they can really help elevate your
editing and make you look more professional.

#### 6. Parallel Cut
Cut to number six is called parallel cutting.
So that means that you have two clips and you're just switching between the two.
So we had this happen in the commercial video that we did.
In the scene where she was partying.
Here we go.
So when she was partying, it's all happening in one night we had this video.
And then we had this video.
So we were constantly switching from this video onto this video.
And then as we got closer to the end, we kind of split up this transition.
Doing this can create suspense and the audience is just waiting to see what's going to happen after
all of these tension.
It also doesn't have to be in one setting.
The boxing video is a good example.
If you have two people doing one activity into different rooms, you can still use this.
You can still use this technique to create suspense.
So let's say in this example, these two people are rivals and they're both practicing for the final
match.
Switching between these guys can help create tension and lets us know as the audience that these two
are just practicing really hard and the suspense builds on as to who's going to win this final match.
So it doesn't have to be in one setting, but the two videos should be related or else it's going to
be considered a hard cut, which is the first cut that we learnt about.
Our next cut is called a cutaway.
This is again a very popular cut.
It's used in like interviews, movies and it's basically when you switch from your a role to your role.
So we saw the Emma Watson interview earlier where first we got different angles of the two people talking
and then we cut into a clip of Beauty and the Beast.
So we switched from the A role, which was Emma Watson and the interview person talking into the B-roll,
which was the animation.
So doing this can help the audience not get bored because interviews can be quite long and you just
don't want to see those two people on screen from start to finish.
And it can also help make your videos look more professional.
So if you have a talking head of yourself and you're talking about cars for 10 minutes, you want to
add some stock footage of cars just to help complement what you're seeing.
Otherwise, the chances of people clicking away will be increased.
So make sure that you have good and suitable B-roll ready for your animals.
Our next cut is called the match Cut.
And this can be a little bit more complicated because it's directly related to the type of video that
you have.
So when you have one motion at the start of video, you want that same motion at the start of video
B and then you're just going to connect these to motions resulting in a match cut.
So this is a B B-roll by this person and B roll into filmmaking.
Community also refers to really professional shots of either product, a procedure such as cooking,
craft making and all that.
It's basically a bunch of creatively filmed videos put together in a really seamless way.
They can be very fun to look at, very cinematic, very relaxing.
And this is different from the B-roll that we were talking about until now.
So let's take a look at the beginning of this video.
So notice all of the swiping motion.
This was not done with Premiere Pro.
This was done with the camera.
Now with Premiere Pro, you can make it smoother.
But about 90% of the work is in the camera movement.
So we had the same setting in the first video.
It's the same shelf.
We're kind of panning upwards and then downwards.
The person is panning in one motion and then starting the second video with that exact same motion.
This results in a match cut.
So as you can see, everything is so seamless, it looks like everything was shot in one go, but it
was not.
And the reason why it feels so seamless is because of all of those camera movements.
So if you are filming your own videos, consider adding these type of transitions so that you can create
a match cut inside Premiere Pro.
Our next cut is when we switch from something really intense into something really chill or the other
way around.
So that's when you have something really epic like this boxing video and then you cut into this really
peaceful video of food.
So here there's a lot of tension and then here everything is peaceful.
It can work the other way, too.
You have a peaceful clip and then you jump into something intense.
Now, we had this in the commercial video as well.
Where the subject wakes up.
So we created that tension with really fast cuts and then we jump into the scene of the subject, just
sleeping.
So the audience feels the tension, fills the suspense, and then they get greeted by a really peaceful
clip.
The next cut is a very basic cut, which isn't as popular in professional setting unless you're trying
to create something peaceful.
So if you go to our poem video, listen, at the end of our video, we have a fade to black effect.
And this is considered a crossfade.
It's basically when you use fade in your cuts.
So this can either be fade to black, which is what we had here.
It can be a dissolve between two videos.
So something like this.
It just kind of fades into video Number two.
We have fade to White and a lot of other ones, which you can find right here.
We have a group for it, Cross dissolve, black, white.
All of these guys are kind of like a beginner transition for most of you starting out and maybe tempting
to use these transitions, but it's best not to because it can show that you're inexperienced with the
theory of cuts and transitions and you're just putting something in between your clips to make it look
better.
But these, while they look like really seamless and cool, they're not exactly professional.
So you're just going to make your video look unprofessional by putting in these transitions.
But there are times where you would want to use these, and that is four times where you have a very
slow paced chill video.
So if you have like these peaceful clips where nothing is happening, the camera isn't moving as much,
and maybe you have a motivational speech in the back, a piano music, you just want to add like a simple
crossfade to keep the chill pace throughout the transition.
So that's our crossfade cuts.
Our next cut is a different type of a match cut.
The previous one that we saw was related to camera movement, but this one is when you just have different
videos but with one movement.
So if I have this video of this person walking and I have another video of a person walking in a similar
frame layout, I can put these two together and it would be even better to match the two subjects.
So let me show you what I mean.
I'm going to cut this right here.
Let's pretend this is two different videos and I'm going to add a tint to the second one.
Just to make it look like it's a different type of video.
So if these are my two videos, I'm cutting exactly on the similar movement.
So when the person is moving their right leg forward, I'm going to make a cut into my second video
that starts with my subject moving their right leg forward.
So this is a match cut that is not directly related to how you filmed the video.
Our next cut is for choose an object that covers your camera to transition into Vision B, for example,
right here, the wall covers the camera.
And when I go past this wall, I can transition into my second video.
So I'm going to wait for the wall to exit.
Cut it right here.
Delete this one and bring my second video, and then I'm just going to cut this.
Of course, you want to make it look like the lighting is good or else this will not look as seamless.
So you would bring this up, mask out these extra bits to introduce the second video.
We will focus on how tos in a further lesson.
I just want to introduce you guys to the different cuts.
And moving forward, we're going to get an in-depth tutorial with examples on how to use these cuts.
So these were the 12 cuts that you should know and always think of them when you're choosing your transitions.
Each of them can make your audience feel a certain way, so it's important to know how to use them and
when to use them.
Now that we know what the different cuts mean and what they look like, it's now time to create them
inside Premiere Pro.


### 3. Basic Action Transitions

So let us begin with our first style of transitions, which concerns the action cut that we learnt about.
For this example, I have a lot of videos that have action and in all of these videos there's some sort
of action that involves a lot of motion blur.
So I made a sequence, dragged all of my videos into the timeline, corrected their frame size and just
place them next to each other.
So you want to place them in a way where there is variation.
So I have a boxing video here.
Then it cuts into someone doing a push up.
So you don't want it to be repetitive because it will be hard to tell that there is a transition to
begin with.
So first we want to work with the duration of each clip.
You can see that some of them are pretty long, while on the other hand, some of them can be really
short.
So depending on what's happening inside the video, we want to make cuts.
Let's analyze the first clip.
So it's just a video of someone punching.
You want to just isolate.
The most epic moment in my case would be like this where the glove comes in front of the camera.
So I can start the video here.
That way I can put a cross to self transition at the start.
A little bit after he makes that punch, I'm going to make my cut.
So this is what we have from my first clip.
Bring in the second clip.
So here the situation is a little different because we have another type of action.
I'm going to start my video here
and it when he does one pushup up.
So you're looking for a start and finish in all of your videos.
So just repeat this with all of the videos until you have a very short compilation of all of these actions.
Again, make sure that each clip contains the full action, so the start of the action and the end.
Later on, we're going to make the cuts and finish the transitions.
So I'm going to do that and then I'll be right back.
So I cut all of my videos.
I also color coded them so it's easier to work with moving forward.
If I played the video back.
We just have a bunch of hard cuts in between each clip.
Now this on its own can be a video, but it will be very slow paced because we got really long cuts.
We got no maybe speed ramping, we have no transitions.
And that can take our video which contains a lot of epic action and make it boring.
So the transition that we are about to do is perfect for this scenario.
All right.
So now analyze each of your clips in mid action.
We want to make a cut.
Let's see our first video.
So right on the final punch made action.
We're going to make a cut and have the next video begin from the starting point.
Then again we're going to make a cut mid action.
Get rid of the rest and just continue until the end of your timeline.
So I cut all of my clips and now they look like this.
One tip about positioning clips like this is to put a longer action next to a shorter action.
So right here we have this action of someone clapping.
And this is pretty short.
So you're going to take a clip that has a longer action and place it right next to that short one.
This will give your video more of a body and it can make it look better.
Again, we have this long shot, put it next to a short video, especially when that short video has
a fast action.
So like, I'm going to put it next to this ball.
And now this is looking pretty good.
Let's play this back.
All right.
So this is the most simplest way of an action cut.
So we're going to elevate this with some speed ramping.
I'm going to start these speed ramping from this video.
The first one is fast enough because of all the flashing lights so we can start the speed ramping here
since since the action is a little slower.
So right click on the f x box right here.
Time remapping speed.
And we're just going to stretch this up so we can see the rubber band.
Now either using the pen tool or command control on your keyboard, we're going to create keyframes.
Let's zoom in right here.
I'm going to speed everything up until he's about to go down, grab my pen tool and make a keyframe.
So it's going to speed up when he goes down.
All right.
I'm going to grab the first bit, pull it down.
And second bit, I wanted to go up.
If you want to see a preview set, you're in an out point with I and O on your keyboard, then hit enter.
So I did something like this.
And if you open up the key frame, you can kind of stretch this transition.
And get something like this.
So this is how we can speed ramp and it will just give us a better result.
So it's a lot better than seeing someone do a push up in slow motion and you're just going to have to
repeat this for any other clip That is not as fast.
For example, here in the previous video, the punching is pretty fast, but here it's pretty slow.
So to make this clip interesting, I'm going to use speed ramping.
Enabled time remapping.
Make your first keyframe where?
Where he is about to make a punch.
And another one where he pulls back.
So the first bit, I'm going to make it faster.
Second, which will be normal.
Third -- will be fast again.
Let's render this.
And see what it looks like going to enable a loop so I can see the speed and then move forward.
So now we get that little jump which is perfect.
Option or alt then hit X to get rid of the in and out points.
All right, let's get rid of this.
We have another situation here.
So I'm going to do the opposite of what we did in the first push up video.
Enable time remapping.
Zoom right in and make your keyframes.
So we get this slow motion and I'm just going to stretch this out.
So he can do a full push up.
There we go.
So that's a lot better.
The next clip is pretty fast, so there's no need to do anything.
And here we have another slow clip going to stretch it out.
Time remapping.
And make my keyframes.
So for this one, I'm going to make my first keyframe when the tire is about to fall.
And then speed up the first bit, leaving the second bit slowed down.
So you see the tire falling in slow motion.
In and out point.
Render.
So I slowed down too much to go for like 70%.
And remember, this is depending on your video.
If you have a video with higher frame rates, then the slow motion will be a lot better.
But I got mine from the internet, so it's most likely 30 FBS or 25.
So I cannot go really slow with these settings.
So I'm rendering this one last time and now we can see a preview.
So this is one style of transition when you cut on the action and if needed, use speed ramping to make
that clip more interesting.
In the next lesson, we're going to elevate this by using a Zoom technique.
So I will see you guys in the next lesson.


### 4. Basic Zoom Transitions

Now we're going to elevate this with some Zoom animations.
As always, you don't want to put all of your tricks in the first video.
Think of the first video as like an introduction to the rest of your skills.
So skip the first video.
Moving on to the second one, you can just kind of zoom in and zoom out depending on the action.
So for example, in the bike video, we have the perfect opportunity to use a zoom out transmission
because the subject is far away and the action that they're doing is in slow motion.
Did the transform effect from the Effect panel?
And we're using the transform effect because we have the option to add motion blur.
That's why we're not using the motion within the video itself.
So down here at Transform Me a keyframe for scale and then go backwards to the beginning and just increase
the scale to like 150.
Again, this depends on your video.
If your video is low quality, the void zooming in too much.
I'm also going to use my position.
Let's first make a keyframe at the current settings, push it here and match it with the second scale
keyframe.
In the first one, we're going to move it so that the subject is at the center of my screen.
So we get something like this.
It's a little too slow, so I'm going to grab them both.
Right click temporal interpolation and do ease in.
Now, when I open these up, we get the points that I can alter with.
Let's see the difference.
So that's a lot better.
But I have the option to just make this even better.
Use the handles to push this to the other side.
So it's like fast at the beginning, then slow near the end.
Do the same thing with the second set of keyframes.
So now we get this zoom out effect for our bike video.
On the other hand, we can have like zoom in effect.
On one of our other videos.
Grab this video at the transform effect.
Right on this one doesn't have any time remapping keyframes, so it should be pretty easy to do.
Make a key frame for scale.
Bring your play head at the end and scale it in by maybe 150.
So we have this pretty simple zoom in transition.
For this one, I'm going to do the opposite.
So grab it.
Transform.
Here.
We're going to have 150 at the start.
100 at the end.
So we have two opposite animations here.
And I sing one of too little Let's go for like 180.
So we have a nice zoom out, zoom in transition.
Let's do the same thing here.
Starting with 100.
Going to a frame here and typing in 150 so we get something like this.
And it's actually pull this near the end.
So there's no pause.
All right.
The rest are time.
Remapped.
This one is good.
So we have all of the transitions right now.
Now we're going to add something called motion Blur, and it really helps elevate your transitions.
So go into the videos that have the transform effect.
Scroll down and disable this option.
Then we're going to increase the shutter angle to 360 degrees.
Do this with all of the other videos that have the transform effect.
This way, we're going to get motion blur at the corners of our video, which can help make our clip
look more seamless and just a lot better.
Close these off.
30, 60.
There we are.
So Motion Blur is really good for these action videos and to render this in and out.
And notice how we did not use any crossfade or any, like, crazy transitions.
That's because we want to keep the focus on the action and have the audience be pumped as to what the
subjects are doing.
So if we did use something epic, like a 3D rotation, a page flip, things like that, then we would
just distract the audience from seeing our great footage.
So now this is what we have.
So that's pretty good.
Kept things really simple, yet effective.
One less thing is to add like cinematic bars, because some of these clips had black bars and you can
see that they get stretched in when we have our transform effect.
So let's make a new adjustment layer and add the crop effect.
So now, regardless of what the videos have, I have my own black bars.
To make this perfect, you would have to add these sound effects and do some sound design.
We already know how to do that.
So if you want your action videos to look better, just use some sound design and we're pretty much
ready to go.
So this was our first transition style.
Really simple, yet effective.
In the next lesson, we're going to learn more about transitions and the different styles out there.
See you guys in the next lesson.


### 5. Sweep Glow

Now we're going to learn about this cool effect, which can spice up your videos.
So let's get started.
This effect requires videos where the object is clearly visible.
You want to make sure that your video is sharp and that the lighting is good.
If your video is too dark or if there's like blur involved, then the effect may not look as crisp.
So I have two videos right here, both of them, of course, and I'm just going to grab them into my
timeline.
So let's begin with our first video.
Duplicate your clip and we're going to put on our first effect.
And that is defined edges effect.
Basically, this effect is going to target the edges of your subject or object.
So you can see why it's important to have a nice and clear video.
But we're going to get the edges alone and not the background.
To do that, just go to the effect controls and invert the fine edges effect.
So now we just get the lines and not the background.
Once we have this, we can click away.
This on its own is a pretty cool effect.
But we can take this a step further.
Then look for our next effect, which allows us to tend whatever we have on that video at the tint effect
right on top effect controls, then map y to anything else you want.
So I will choose a cyan and now the edges are that color.
You can leave with one color throughout the entire clip, but I'm going to change it by creating a frame,
pushing it forward.
And then maybe around here changing the color to do something else.
Let's try.
Let's try a magenta.
And that's pretty good.
So this is what we have so far.
All right.
Now what we want to do is to make these lines glow.
Right now, it's looking a little flat.
So grab your glow effect.
We are glow at this on top of controls.
Down here, we have some options.
First of all, we're going to work with the glow itself.
So reduce from the threshold so we don't make the other random sort of glow.
But just the lines.
Let's stick with, like, point 60.
And isolate the bigger parts of the car.
Next is radius.
This is how much of the glue is showing out.
So if you reduce it, you're going to get better results.
Going to stick with like 20.
And finally, we have the brightness which you want to increase strive for.
You can even go higher.
You will get a different result.
My thing.
I'll go with like 4.5.
And that is looking good.
The problem is that the glue is adding a white color to my clip.
To fix that, just check this box.
And put on whatever color that you had before.
You can even grab the Eyedropper tool and select it here.
So now if I just make my in and out point, we can see a preview.
So when we play this back, we have this really nice.
It almost looks like an animation and it's looking pretty cool.
So you can increase the radius if the lines are too small for you.
But I'm going to stick with the following numbers.
All right, Now let's move on to our next effect, which is going to take these lines and basically
add some sort of wave to it so they will not be as strict.
Let me show you what I mean.
Grab the turbulent displace effect added above.
It's going to give you an error.
Simply grab it above var glue and the problem should be solved.
Open up turbulent displays.
You can see how it's making the lines wiggly.
This is what I mean.
Begin by reducing the size.
So it's not that we've.
Going to stick with 20.
You can go higher if you want.
And then finally, work with the amount.
So you can either make it really intense or something a little mellow.
And it goes like 85.
And this is pretty good.
Close, triple and displays.
And now we want to take all of these glowy lines and leave out the darker bits.
To do that.
We're going to go to the effects panel and look for the extract effect.
Add this right above.
And now we're going to get these white lines go to effect controls and we're going to set black input
level to zero.
And remove softness completely, then increase your white inputs level.
Until you get the lines that you want.
If you don't want the extra bits, just add on to this so that you only get details from the car.
Just take a look.
Think 50 is nice.
Invert the effect and then we're going to head up here to change the blending mode.
That way we can get this effect on the original video.
There we are.
We now have these lines all over the car, bring extract above tent, and now you're going to get those
lines.
If the wiggly lines are too much, you can always just go back and remove from the turbulent displace
effect.
So just reduce the amount.
Let's try 40.
So now we have this effect, which looks pretty awesome.
You can now simply fade out the top with you use opacity frames and anything else.
So maybe around here.
I don't want the glowing effect.
So go to opacity, make a keyframe for 100%, and then move forward, turning it into zero.
So very slowly these lines are going to fade.
And it's actually better to limit the space between the two key frames.
And there is our glowing line effect.
Now let's try it with a video that does not have any small detail.
So there's no ground and we only have the wheel.
Once again, duplicate this.
I'm going to copy all of the effects we had here so that we don't start from scratch.
Right click copy.
Go to your other duplicate.
Right click.
Paste.
Attributes.
Over here, we want to disable everything except for the effects.
Make sure that all of the effects are selected and then we can hit.
Okay.
So are we going to get all of this Now?
All I have to do is to change the blending mode into screen.
Now, a transition that you can do is to grab your duplicate video, cut it into equal pieces with your
eraser tool.
Mine will be four pieces.
And then just change the blending mode into something else.
So let's try Lean your Dutch.
Though back to none.
So are normal.
So we get these glowing lines, go to this one.
Once again, one of your Dutch.
And then go back to normal so we can get this cartoonish transition, which is pretty good for like
music videos or car clips.
So this is what it looks like.
Now, if you're not a fan of these chunky jewelry lines, there is some way that you can tweak the settings
and get a thinner line.
To do that, click on your duplicate move the extract effect above find edges, and immediately you
can see that you get less chunkier lines and less of those finer details.
Now go to your extract effect and we're going to make that sweeping animation.
Turn the white input level to zero.
Make a keyframe at the start.
Go near the end and turn this all the way to like.
200.
And this way we're going to get that sweeping animation.
Let's render this.
Once we render it, this will look a lot better.
And you can just copy and paste these key frames as many times as you want, which is what I did here.
Also notice when you have less tiny details, you'll get a better result.
So here we had the cement and the fine edges effect catches that.
So the best thing to do is to grab a video where it's mostly the object or the subject going to go in
here and bring my tint keyframes.
A little bit closer.
So I'm going to make one for Cyan.
In between the two white input keyframes.
For the second one, I will make it magenta.
So this was a really simple effect that you can do inside of Premiere Pro using some built in effects.
We did not need to use any plugins or any outsourced materials, so this will be a nice touch that you
can add on top of your clips.
See you guys in the next lesson.


### 6. Sky Flip

We're going to learn about this really simple and awesome transition that you can do with your travel
videos.
So let's get started.
For this video, you're going to need to clips that have similar sky.
The less clouds, the better, because you're going to be masking one on top of the other.
And those clouds can look really weird.
So clear skies are the best.
And once again, make sure that the color of the sky is similar.
Make a new sequence right here.
And let's call this flip transition.
Here.
You want to drag your first clip and then the second clip.
If your video is too big, just right click.
Said to frame size.
Just make sure that there isn't any black bars so we may have to scale it in.
By a few points.
So once we have this, we're going to drag the second video and put it above the first one.
So right when you want the transmission to happen.
I want my first video on screen for a little bit before I transition into the second one.
Drag the second one right there and we're going to let it be.
We can keep a little bit of the second video and then get rid of the excess.
So you should have something like this.
Now, we're going to grab the second clip, then rotated 180 degrees so that it's upside down.
Using position why we're going to pull it up so that the sky matches the sky in one.
Grab the pen tool right here or this shape tool to just create a shape around the edge right here.
So make a rectangle.
Around this middle line.
Let's pull these down.
Invert your selection.
So we get everything but this line, then feather out the edges so we don't see that cut.
So maybe 190 click away once you're finished.
So we have this right now.
I'm going to grab mine a little bit closer.
Like so.
And the goal here is to make these two guys blend in.
So once we have this, we're going to grab those clips, right click replace with after effect composition.
So once we are in after Effects, we're going to begin by renaming our videos.
This is video number two.
Video number one.
Color coding also helps.
Then we're going to make a new adjustment layer, and this will act as our control layer.
So we're going to first have a smoother transition.
For the second video, you can see that it's suddenly pops up above the first video.
So we're going to grab it a P on our keyboard, make a keyframe a few seconds forward, go to the beginning
and just pull this up until we don't see it anymore.
So now we're going to get like a smoother motion for video number two.
And I can see that my mask is a little off, so I'm just going to grab it until I don't see that harsh
line.
Always be sure to do the same with the other point.
Zoom right in.
So that's my first transition.
I'm going to grab them both and ease.
This will give us a smoother transition for the position keyframes and make it look less stiff.
Now grab both of your videos and connect it to the control layer.
Go to your control layer s and just zoom out until you can see both videos.
We can clearly see that the sky here is a gray and the sky in this video is blue.
To match it, we're going to use the metric color on video number two and maybe you would sound like.
Color wheels, basic adjustments.
We can give it the same color.
So grab the colors for highlights and get a similar blue.
It's really important that they look kind of related.
But of course, we cannot make them identical.
Just something basic like this.
Extending the mask can also help.
So.
Just extend it until you see the clouds and go up here, increase the vibrance, get like a deeper blue
and add some contrast.
So now it's looking a lot better and similar to the first video.
Close this off.
And bring the scale back to 100.
All right.
Once we have this, we're going to grab our control layer, open up the transform settings, and begin
the transformation.
So at the start of your transition, which I wanted to be around here after this guy has calmed down
or better yet, made animation somewhere around here, we're going to make a keyframe for position and
rotation.
Go near the end and make a keyframe for rotation, but this time with 180 degrees.
So now we're going to get the first video upside down and using position Y, I can pull this guy up.
Revealing video number two.
Just make sure that we don't get any black bars.
There you go.
So the presence of Speedo number one is not that bad because we matched the two colors.
So now we have this flip transition, which is looking pretty good.
The faster the transition, the better.
Because if there's any problem with your masking your keyframes, you can hide it all with some speed.
So once we're done, I just pull these guys closer.
It's f nine on your keyboard.
You can check your shortcuts right here and edit keyboard shortcuts and look for these in so you can
see which keys you need to press to get this effect.
All right.
So once we have this, when we do the turn, there's actually some black bars and we can easily fix
this with the motion tile effect.
Add this onto both videos.
Video number one, we do.
Number two, go to video number one, increase the output width and the output height until we don't
see those black bars.
Next, we're going to mirror the edges so things look a lot better.
Do a full turn.
Make sure you do not reveal anything else.
Now on to feature number two.
Grab it.
We're going to do the same thing, but without the height, because the height concerns the area that
we masked.
So you just want to work with the width.
And mirrored the aegis.
All right, Looking good.
Now, if you're not happy with this one, you can just scale this in.
With the control layer.
So just increase this until you don't see those black bars.
112.
That's pretty good.
So now we're not seeing those black bars.
Now we're going to add a simple wiggle expression just to make things look smoother.
Hold down alter option and click on D stopwatch on position.
We're going to type legal parentheses.
Three, five.
Click away once you're done.
And are we going to get like a shaky effect which can hide away any imperfections in our transition?
Once I'm done, I'm going to hit se command se to save this.
Go back into Premiere Pro.
And I got myself.
And nice flip transition.
So you can keep yours horizontal, but I'm going to make mine vertical by simply going in my project
panel New sequence.
Name it here.
Final.
Go into my settings, switch the numbers.
So it's 1080 by 1920 and this will give me a vertical video.
Now add the transitions linked composition, right?
And slide key settings go into effect controls and just extend this until it fills the screen.
So now this is going to look a lot better and it's pretty good for like Tik Tok or any other platform
you can use position to just push this.
In a better place.
Then it cut my video right here.
Command K, control K, and now we got ourselves a really nice transition.
So that was really easy to do and it's a very viable transition nowadays.
You can use it on your travel videos or any other clip.
So I hope you guys enjoyed this simple transition and I will see you guys in the next lesson.


### 7. Dolly - Vertigo Zoom

In today's lesson, we're going to learn about this really simple effect that you can do in Premiere
Pro.
So let's get started.
This effect is called the vertical zoom or the dolly zoom.
It's quite popular in films, and you have probably seen it on social media, too.
For this to work, we're going to need clips that have movement.
So here I have a compilation of just nature scenes.
As you can see, the camera is moving inwards or outwards.
That's exactly what we need.
Rotations are not exactly what we need here, so we're looking for a simple position change from back
to front.
So choose the parts that you want and bring them into Premiere Pro.
So once you have both of your clips on your timeline, we're going to begin by grabbing the clip heading
over to effect controls.
And then we just extend this here.
So basically, you want to take a look at the movement inside the video and then scale it out the opposite
way.
So here we're going inwards towards the mountains.
But I can just reverse this.
And use scale key frames to kind of stretch out the horizon.
So right click reverse and now it's going to go away from the mountains.
Another tip is to fast forward your clip.
If the movement is really slow, so hit are on your keyboard till you get this tool, the great stretch
tool.
Click and drag it towards the other side to speed it up and it go for like this much.
And now the movement is happening a lot faster.
All right, let's hit we get our selection tool and begin with a scale keyframe.
Make a keyframe for 100% at the start of your video, then go all the way to the end and scale this
up by, let's see, 150.
This depends on your video.
If it's a lower quality clip, then you will not really have the option to scale in that much.
So I can't really go too far or else it's going to get all blurry.
So depending on how much you can zoom in with your video, you would put in your scale number.
So now when I play this back, we have that stretch effect.
So you want to make your preview panel full screen with the key next to the shift bar on the left.
And now I can see this zoom effect.
Click that button again and you're back to square one.
If at any point you felt like the transition is too fast, you can grab the right tool again and stretch
this out.
Then to go with 5 seconds, which is half of what we had.
Now there are instances where you have a subject clearly being the focus of the video such as this one.
So over here we have the drone going towards the boat and then towards the sun.
Do the same thing, but this time our scale key frames need to be the opposite.
So at the start, we're going to put in 160.
And near the end we're going to turn it back to 100.
So this will give us the zoomed in effect.
And stretch it out for as long as you need to.
I'm going to just cut my video here.
Now, another thing is to keep your subject centered with this effect.
So because it stretches it out, you may move your subject to one corner.
To avoid that, we can just go to the start again and make position keyframes.
So because I'm zoomed in here at 160, I can use my position keyframes and make sure that everything
is perfect.
Start the stopwatch, go to the end, and just reset this back to what it was.
Which was 965 540.
So this way the subject will not wander off to one side when we have this effect.
So that's how easily you can do this with your subjects.
It's really important that your camera movement is there or else with a still video you will not get
this effect.
And to do the same position thing here since the middle of the path is pushed towards the left.
So make a keyframe for whatever the position settings are.
Then go to the end.
Pushed us to where it should be.
So now we're going to get an effect like this.
It gets stretched towards the center of your video.
So that's how we can do the vertical or the dolly zoom effect.
It's pretty awesome to do.
And now we can move on to another simple transition that we can do inside Premiere Pro.


### 8. Photo Puzzle

In today's lesson, we're going to learn about this really cool and really simple photo puzzle effect
using Premiere Pro.
So let's get started.
I have a bunch of images here, and this effect does not require Photoshop or any other platform.
So I have a bunch of images right here, and they all share a similar frame size.
They're all vertical shots.
And because we're going to be using the pen tool, it's really important that your images have a clear
edge because we don't want to spend too much time with the pen tool removing all the details.
So if there is good contrast between your elements within the image, then removing it will be pretty
easy.
So here's another example.
We have a clear cut of a pool.
Here we have this sand mountain, and they're all really easy to remove with the pencil.
We're going to make a sequence from one of these images.
I'm going to go with one that is a vertical shot.
So this one, drag it right in.
This is the tallest one.
That's why I chose it.
And now everything else will go inside the frame size.
All right, We can close this off.
And begin with our first image.
So this depends on how many cuts you want to make on each image.
And based on those cuts, you're going to have more slides to work with.
So for my first image, I want three cuts.
One of my subject, one of the mountain and another of the sky.
So I'm going to duplicate this three times.
Hold down option or alt click and drag right above.
And then we want to offset each one so we get this staircase effect.
So for the first one, let's zoom right in on the subject.
Grab your first image.
Go to the controls.
Grab the pen tool right here and mask around your subject.
It doesn't have to be perfect because this is a cut out effect.
So those harsh lines are actually favored.
If you hold down inch, you're going to get the hand tool which can help you navigate through the different
parts of your image and then go back with the pen tool and finish your mask.
Once you have a cut out of your subject, you can bring these points closer so you get less of the sand.
This way, the cut out will look better.
You can also click and drag to choose a few points together and just pull them down.
Once you're done, you should have a nice cut out of your subject.
Next, we just want to go in here and remove from the mask whether we want those harsh cuts so it can
look like a cutout rather than like a soft selection of your subject.
So do this with your other layers.
This time we're going to focus on the mountain with a few points.
And you can see right now that if I had a really complicated mountain, this would take forever.
So that's why it's important to.
Get really simple shapes.
Hit, enter on your keyboard and then make sure that you're not cutting away the mountain.
So pull these points up and make it perfect.
So now I have the mountain and I can just delete my third duplicate instead, duplicate the second one
and just invert my selection.
So I get everything but the sky.
To go on this invert.
And now we have the sky.
This is what it looks like.
So this is layer one.
Layer two and layer three.
Put them all together.
We get our original image.
When I play this back, we're going to get.
This effect.
Be sure to remove the feather or else you're going to get a black line between your layers.
So this is my first image.
And the closer you put these together, the faster the effect will be.
Now we're going to bring in our next set of images.
Let's see which one looks better and it grab something that has a completely different color palette
such as this one.
Bring it right above keeping the same amount.
And first, I just need to scale this up.
And then what you want to do is to always color code your images so that it becomes less confusing.
So anything with the color pink is my first image.
Anything with the color yellow is my second image.
Here, I'm going to use the pool.
So just make points.
Around the corner.
It's pretty easy since they have sharp edges.
So I have the pool here.
Remove from the mask Feather.
By holding down option or alt.
Track it right above.
And just invert the selection so we get everything but the pool.
So far, this is what we have.
And we're just going to keep doing this until we have all of our cuts and all of our images.
So once you're done, you should have six images, each one with a different cutout.
Now, I just wanted to show you guys some other ways that you can stack these guys on top of each other
so that they look a little different.
One technique is to reverse it, meaning that once you have your second image laid out, you're going
to let it be on screen for a few seconds, then reverse the movement.
So I'm going to cut the pool right here, get rid of it, And then we have the hole once again.
But now we're going to reveal the next image, starting with the background.
And then put this guy right above.
So we have this sandwich effect, and I'm just going to duplicate this.
Let's pull this up on floor, duplicate this and put it right here.
So one is on the bottom.
The duplicate of this is above.
And the third image, the second cut, I mean, it's going to be offset like so.
So let me just show you what I mean here.
This is the first image that is of the grass.
Second one is a duplicate of this, which now goes on top.
Third is the sky.
So put it all together and we have the reverse movement.
To reveal our next image.
Another technique is for when you have like a surrounded area like this.
This is what it looks like.
We're going to put this right above my first image, and that's going to like kind of put this new image
in a cave and allow me to just show my other half.
It's just put it right here.
And now we have our image.
So you're kind of making a puzzle, essentially, with all of your different cuts.
We get our next image.
Let's see how we can bring in the next one.
So we have three cuts here.
One of the subject, one of the water and another of the sky.
Open this up.
I'm going to put the subject right in the middle.
It's going to look really random, but we're going to introduce the water behind the cave.
I think this was the cave.
So this is the cave.
I'm going to cut the inside so we get this hole and then introduce the water right underneath.
Put them both together.
So the sunset is there too.
I may have to fix up my mask later.
But now we have another effect.
He can also have the cave.
Stay there for a bit longer before we introduce our final image.
So you just playing around with the different things, see what our last image is.
All right, so we have another three parter.
Which means that I can put the car right there.
Then bring in the next items.
So we have this staircase play this back and we have a really nice effect.
So the effect is good, but it's a little too slow for me.
I'm going to work with the speed.
And another thing that you can do is to add a simple preset from the numeric presets here.
So let's go for like, cinematic, something that is vintage like.
And you can just drag it onto all of these clips.
You can try different ones for each image.
Just to make it look fun.
And this is why it's important to color code all of your images.
So you will have an easier time when you're color grading them.
You could also use the color panel, but that's going to take a while.
So just stick with these simple things.
You can also see a preview of the preset before you apply it onto your video.
So right there in the controls, you can see the effect panel, you can see the little cuts.
And based on how it looks on my video, I can decide which one to choose.
Now, to avoid a black screen at the start of my video, I'm going to grab everything and pull it up
one floor.
Get a color match in my project panel.
And perhaps choose like a either white or a neutral color.
Bring it right underneath and we get something that is better.
We can cut it after the first image has revealed itself, and then we will not have a black screen.
You can also create some sort of animation and take it a step further.
This is, of course, optional, but in instances where you have a separate subject, for example,
here we have a car I can add like a position keyframe, a skill keyframe, and just and make this more
dynamic.
So for this one, I'm going to move my play head here before the rest of the image shows up.
Make a keyframe for position, go back to the beginning and like, push it in the direction that the
car would be coming from.
If you want to add motion blur, you can add the transform effect and get that right there.
So now this car is going to zoom in and the rest of the image will follow after.
Let's try this with our second subject.
We're going to maybe have him come from below and rotate.
Make your keyframe for position and rotation.
Push them back.
And then go forward.
We use position Y to just push it completely away.
Just make sure that it doesn't collide with the second and third layers.
So here I just pushed it down and maybe we can rotate it at 36 degrees.
So it's kind of like flip in here if you want to do that.
Or you can do like a slight turn.
Go forward so you can see and kind of do like a window effect.
Going to go with -90.
Match it with the first keyframe, and now it's going to like.
Show up to pull this down.
It's going to show up like this and then match with all the other images.
I'm also going to cut the cave a little bit after.
And then the car shows up.
And if you have any other elements, you can do that.
Let's try scale on the tiny subject we have here.
Zoom right in.
Grow like halfway through.
Make a keyframe for scale at 100.
Go to the beginning and make it zero.
So it's going to scale in, and then we get the rest of the image.
Now all that's left to do is to work with the speed.
We don't want to slow animation.
And it grabbed both of these and just push them back like so.
Then bring the rest in.
So I'm just working with the speed of the layers.
Play it back, experiment until you get something you're happy with and then you're done.
You got yourself a nice travel montage, so it was really easy and simple to do, and you can use this
for any other purpose.
It's a pretty trendy effect nowadays, so you can just hop on the trend and use it to spice up your
videos.
So I hope you guys enjoyed this lesson and I will see you in the next one.


### 9. Zoom Split

Let's see how we can do this.
Really simple and awesome transition using Premiere Pro.
I have two clips right here.
Are you going to grab them right into the timeline?
So first, we're going to take a look at our really simple zoom transition and then see how we can elevate
it with some additional settings.
Begin by making a new adjustment layer.
And placing it right in between the transition.
So it should be right above and the center of the cut should be the center of the adjustment layer.
Go to your effects panel and look for the transform effect.
Add this on your adjustment layer and we're just going to go to the controls and make some simple scale
keyframes.
So we're going to begin right here.
With 100% scale.
Go to the center.
Bring it up to like 400 to try 300.
And then go back to 100.
When we play it back.
This is what we have.
So to speed the sub, just pull the numbers in.
The most important thing is that the middle key frame needs to be right on that cut.
Then based on that, we can pull the two other frames closer and get a faster result.
Now to make this smoother, we're going to enable motion blur.
Scroll down here, turn this option off, then add to the shutter angle.
The higher the better I'm going to go with to 50.
And now we're going to get this effect.
It's looking good.
Below the adjustment layer, we want to add a simple cross dissolve transition.
Let's get a dissolve transition and added in between.
So this is one effect that you can do to bring the key frames closer.
And now we get this really simple zoom transition.
Now, let's take this a step further by adding new effects.
I'm going to delete all that we made.
Then begin with my first video right where you want the transition to happen.
Are you going to make a cut, command or control key on Windows?
And now this is going to be related to the transition and in label, the second video is something else
so that we stay organized.
Now we're going to duplicate this cut option or alt click and drag or add above.
So like the top duplicate opacity and using the polygon tool, we're going to make a mask, grab the
ruler and put it on 960, which is half of 1920.
That is the dimension of our sequence.
So now we're going to grab that polygon mask and just make a shape on this half.
So just pull these guys back.
You can zoom out a little so that you can see the corners of the video.
So now we have this half effect.
And you also want to remove the mask feather.
So when I hide my first original video, we have half of our subject.
Now we're going to copy the mask, select it, command C or Control C, go to the original cut and paste
it Here.
Select opacity, then hit Command V or Control V to paste the effects.
Now on this, we want to invert it so we get the other side.
So we have one side here and the other right here.
So now what we want to do is to hide away the mask properties on each of these layers.
Grab the first one right click.
Nest.
Let's call this left side.
Do the same thing with the bottom one and call it the right side.
So now we're not getting the mask properties and this will not interfere with any of the other effects
that we are about to add on.
Go to the effects panel and look for the transform effect.
Added onto the left side effect controls.
And we're going to kind of have the left side move from the center into the left, revealing the second
video.
So go to where you want this transition to happen.
Going to wait until the subject's face is at the center of this line.
Make a keyframe for position.
Push it back around here.
We're going to just pull it all the way outside of frame.
So we have something like this.
That's looking good.
Enable motion blur.
Disable this option at 360 so we can get motion blur.
All right.
And now what we're going to do is to just copy this Transform effect, Command Z, Control Z.
Pasted onto the right side nest.
So now we just need to go in right side and alter the second keyframe because we want this to go to
the opposite side, select the second keyframe, and just pull it to the opposite end.
So now we have this window effect.
For the video.
I'm just going to change the key frame.
So right click on the second one.
He's in.
First one, Ease out.
Do the same thing with the other side.
So now we're just going to move these guys up one floor and bring our third video.
Cut the start with you right around here and put these guys down, and you should have something like
this.
Grab all three.
Right click nest and to call this transition hit.
And now on the transition we can add the transform effect and have it kind of zoom in on what's happening.
So let's see.
Think I'll go back, bring the other video in right underneath your transmission.
Cut this bunch of it.
And from the top stuff, you can get rid of the first video since it's out of frame and cut the exact
same amount from video number two.
So you should have something like this.
Video one.
These are also parts of figure one.
And then we have video to grab all three, right click next one more time.
It's call this transition.
And now on this transition, we're going to add the transform effect.
And then right before this transition happens, we're going to make a keyframe four anchor point position
and scale go forward until after the transition happens.
And make another set of key frames in the middle of all of this.
We're going to use a scale to zoom in.
Let's try 180.
And of course, we're going to change the anchor point if you want.
If you're not happy with where it is thing, I'll actually skip anchor point.
And instead use position to kind of have these subjects face in the middle.
There we go.
Play this back.
And we have something like this again.
The closer you bring the keyframes, the faster the effect will be.
Pull these guys in.
Then we got ourselves a zoom in transition.
If you don't want it to bounce, you can remove the second set and then you'll just get the video.
So we have all of this.
I'm going to again enable motion Blur 30, 60 degrees, and that will just make everything perfect.
To hide away the blackboard situation.
I'm going to bring in another adjustment layer right above and actually just on top of the whole sequence.
All right.
On this, we're going to add the cinematic crop, which we already know how to make the crop effect
and just hide away the current blackboard that we have with the new blackboard.
So now we won't see the bar here when we are zooming in on this video.
You can also skip this step by just assuming in the video before you begin the transition.
So instead of this video being at 100, you can start it with like here.
So you can avoid putting the crop effect.
Going to get rid of the ruler and now we're done with our transition.
So this was a really simple transition and it actually looks quite cool.
You can try this with any other videos, but as we learned, transitions like this build tension and
excitement.
So you would want to use this transition for like really hyper videos such as like a music video that
we have here where the music is exciting and we want to match that energy with our transition.
So I hope you guys enjoyed this simple transition.
Let's move on to the next lesson.


### 10. Mask Tunnel

In today's lesson, we're going to see how we can do this transition.
So let's get started.
Begin by making a sequence from your first video.
So I have this video of the camera zooming in towards the logo, and this is perfect for me to just
put in my next clip and have it look like we're going through the logo and seeing our second video.
So if you want to get your own clips, make sure that there is something with a lot of contrast so we
can mask it out easily.
Let's zoom into our timeline and decide when we want to zoom in into our first video.
So right around here, I'm going to right click.
Insert frame hold segment.
So now we have a freeze frame.
And we can actually get rid of the rest.
So right under this freeze frame, we're going to duplicate it.
I'm going to hide away the duplicate for now and work with the one on the bottom.
So on the bottom section, we're going to grab the pen tool under opacity and just mask out the logo.
So this should be pretty easy.
You don't have to be perfect with it, but the cleaner the better.
We are going to use some motion blur so your mistakes won't be as noticeable.
Switch between etch and P to make a point and then use dx hand tool which is edge to move your canvas
around.
So I got my logo nice and clean.
Remove the feather so we get a clean cut out of the logo.
Now you can zoom in onto the video or the freeze frame and just make sure that there isn't any red visible.
This way we can avoid.
A interruption in our transition.
So just focus on the black line.
So once I have my cut out, I'm going to click away.
And bring back my first video.
So we can actually delete the duplicate duplicate the masked version.
And simply invert it.
So now on the duplicate, we have the car, but not the logo.
In the original video.
We just have to look at nest each of these ones individually.
Call the top nest frame and eat bottom nest logo.
All right.
So now we want to add on the transform effect.
And put it onto each one.
Click on the logo layer effect controls and kind of make the logo like slide down.
So it's like a door opening to show the rest of the video.
We're going to make a key frame for position and move a few frames forward.
Then pull this down completely.
So the logo should just slide down
like so enable motion blur 360 shutter angle and turn off this option.
So it just disappears.
Like so after the logo goes away, we're going to make a key frame on the frame nest for position and
scale.
Move forward again, just a few frames.
Not that much.
Use scale to just completely get rid of the frame.
And if needed, if you felt like the logo is moved towards the side, we can.
Push it with the position X and Y so that the logo can stay centered when we scale it up.
I have to go back to my logo layer and pull this down even more.
So after this, you should not be seeing anything and just get a black screen.
Now, on your frame, you want to enable the motion blur, just as we did with the logo video.
Now bring these guys up.
Creating room down here for our second video.
Let's see.
Yeah.
Put your second video underneath.
Check the frame size.
And now when we play it all back, we get this transition.
So now I just need to work with the speed of my transition and make everything perfect.
So right now I think he's a little uncoordinated.
So go to your local layer.
And let's see, put our plan ahead exactly where the transition happens.
Going to stretch this out.
So right here, my logo leaves.
And around here, the frame is already gone.
So have your plate hit on the second key frame on the logo.
Next move in one frame towards the right.
Go to your frame video the frame layer and just pull these guys back so that the frame moves after the
logo.
So there's a little pause and this is all optional.
You can even just simply fade out the logo.
And don't create a pause for it.
Set.
You're in and out point Render your video so you can see a before and after.
Enable loop.
Play this back.
And now this is what we have.
So once I pay this back, I want to take a longer pause between the frame and the logo moving away.
So after the logo is gone, I'm going to wait a few seconds before the frame moves out.
So just pull these guys back so we can see a sneak peek of what's happening behind the car and then
see the rest.
If you want, you can make the first bit of the second video a freeze frame or maybe like do a zoom
effect and make this a different color and try to zoom this in.
So let's move on to the beginning of this second video.
Grab our transform effect, make a keyframe for scale.
Pull the 100% scale key frame after the frame is gone and it cut this transition.
So after the frame is no longer in sight, we have a 100% scale transition going forward.
Right at the beginning of this transition, we're going to increase this by like maybe 200 places back
and we get like this zoom effect.
This can make our work more dynamic.
Enable motion Blur.
Motion Blur is really important in all of these, so don't skip out on that.
Optionally, we can add a rotate effect as well.
At the start of this video, zero degrees rotation.
Match it with the second scale keyframe.
At the beginning, we're going to add maybe 90 degrees because we're zoomed in.
There shouldn't be much of a problem.
If you saw that you're getting black bars, we can increase the scale because we have motion blur.
You can scale in more than usual.
So don't be worried about that.
Let's strive for 100.
And that's looking good again, going slowly, make sure we're not getting any other black bars.
And we're pretty much ready to go.
All right.
So now onto the second video.
We're going to do the same thing, but perhaps with a different movement.
You can just stop here or maybe zoom in through like this little area.
I just left this out optionally.
So right when you want the transition to start, right click.
Insert frame hold segment.
Get rid of the rest and we're going to grab it.
Zoom in to that little compartment that we want to mask out, hold down edge.
Zoom in even more.
All right.
Using the pen tool.
We're going to mask this out.
So grab this
pen tool.
And because this is a small detail, you don't have to be perfect.
You can already see that the edges of this part is blurred out, so you don't have to spend that much
time on it.
Remove feather.
Work with your points a little until you're happy.
Once we have this, we're going to duplicate this section on the top one inverted.
So we get everything but this small section.
Again, we're going to nest each one so we don't get any complications.
We call this pouch line.
And this one.
Rubin in College Tunnel.
So this is the outline and that's the tunnel.
Zoom right out.
And now we're going to once again use any animation out there to get rid of this tiny section.
You can try scale rotation or even just opacity.
It's really up to you.
So you can try anything to get rid of this tiny bit, put the transform effect onto your nested clip,
effect controls, and use any of these options.
This is a few of the examples you can use scale to make it smaller.
You can use position X or Y to go to bring it up down, left.
Right.
Or use rotation to kind of flip it out of the scene.
So there are many options.
I'm just going to stick with a classic position keyframe, start your stopwatch, go in a few frames,
push it up out of sight, turn off outline and make sure it's not hanging around anywhere and should
have this tiny thing just flying up out of your frame.
Enable motion blur, as always.
And now we have this tiny section that we can use now over here because the hole is towards the right.
We need to use a little bit more of the options.
So first add the transform effect on your outline nest and after the hole is gone, which isn't that
noticeable.
So we can actually do it right here.
Add a keyframe for position and scale.
Make a keyframe for anchor point as well.
Pull it at the start.
Move forward a few frames.
And first we're going to change the anchor point towards the middle.
And then you scale to just move straight into that section.
So just switch between anchor point.
Scale and position until you're just past that section.
So we're going to stop somewhere around here, and this should be enough of a fast effect for the transition
to go through.
Around here like a frame.
After this last keyframe, we're going to add a opacity keyframe.
So 100% on the last keyframe, we're going to set it to zero.
So this just fades out and we're left with our third video, which will be right underneath.
Get rid of the rest of these nested clips.
Pull this up and bring in our last video.
Let's take a look at a preview and then work with the speed and keyframe placement.
So when I play this back, it's a little too fast.
I'm going to adjust the length of my layers and the keyframes to get something that I need.
And we actually forgot to add motion blur to the second video, so just do that.
Add motion blur to both of your clips.
It's really important.
Once I have worked with the speed and my layers, I got myself a transition like this.
You can make this slower or faster to the way you like it.
I want mine to be fast.
So I left mine like this.
So those were two transitions that you can do using masking and the transform effect.
They are very simple and versatile and great for action videos, music videos, or just any epic video
where you want a lot of excitement.
So I hope you guys enjoyed this lesson.
Now let's move on to the next one.


### 11. Motion Swipe

This effect is really cool and really simple to do.
So let's get started and see how we can make it inside.
Premiere Pro I have two clips right here.
Both of them are of cars, and the reason why we're choosing cars is because we're going to do a lot
of masking and tracking.
So you want to find objects that are easy to mask out and of course easy to track.
So contrast is really important.
You don't want your subject to blend in with the background.
Let's begin with our first video and make a sequence.
Over here.
We're going to duplicate this clip, hold down optional alt and bring it right above.
Next, we're going to hide our original shot.
And with the duplicate, we're going to mask out the car.
So go to effect controls pen tool and begin drawing your shape.
It doesn't have to be perfect, but make sure that it's good enough so that Premiere Pro can track the
movement.
Cut your video if necessary, and then track the mask.
So because the car didn't move as much in this video.
Premiere Pro did a good job.
Now duplicate this and nest this layer that we just made the mask on.
Leave the duplicate alone and just nest this.
Let's call this motion.
So you should have something like this.
On the nested layer.
We're going to grab the offset effect and this is going to kind of clone your mask multiple times.
So go right here if you add to the shift center to.
You can see that we're getting multiple clones of the car.
And because we have this duplicate above, it's going to look a lot better.
So be sure to leave this on.
And now with the motion on this layer, we're going to let's first bring it back to the original place.
Make a keyframe at the beginning.
Go to the end of your timeline or the end of this asset clip and increase this all the way so that it
does multiple turns.
So let me play this back.
And the more you add to this, the faster it will be.
So I'm going to go back here 32,767 and you're just going to get this effect.
How to make this look better, because right now it just looks like a bunch of clones.
We're going to just add a blur effect.
Go to your effects panel and look for the directional blur effect on your motion layer.
At the directional blur effect controls directional blur and just add to the length.
Then you want to make sure that direction is in the same way as your offset frames.
So that would be 90 degrees and now it's going to go that way.
Just like the offset keyframes.
Finally to fill in the little gaps between each of the duplicates.
We're going to push this one four up.
We're going to leave the top layer up, lock it, then duplicate the nest layer and offset it so that
we can fill in the gaps.
We're essentially looking for one line.
Of motion.
And on the top layer, you can feather out the edges so that it doesn't look.
That's sharp and go into each of the nested clips to add to that feather amount.
So I'm going to add like 50 for feathering and decrease from the mask expansion.
-38 for this 54 mask feather.
Do the same thing in the other one.
So now this will give us a better result.
And now I have this effect.
And to remove from my selection here.
There you go.
So now you can just add any other transition or add some other effects on it.
I'm just going to nest everything.
Hit.
Okay.
And just add maybe a transformer effect.
With this, I can do a zoom out effect.
Have your play head forward.
Somewhere here, make a key frame for skill and position.
We may need position.
Go to the beginning of your video and just scale in towards the car, maybe focus on the light here
and then using position.
We're going to choose a better view.
Enable motion blur and you got yourself a better.
Transition.
So we get like a swipe and then all of these cars.
So this is one way that you can use this.
So to avoid seeing these people, we're going to go to our second scale keyframe and just zoom in more
than we need to select.
130 in the beginning is 225.
And then in the second position, keyframe, we're going to like push this down.
So we just see the torso and not their faces.
This can be less distracting.
We can now work with the key frames.
Let's try these in and work with the.
Handles.
And now we have a better movement.
Now, for the second example.
We're going to do something a little different.
So here we again have a car.
But first of all, we don't have any other elements and we're doing these turns.
So the camera is kind of showcasing the car.
To the audience.
Then they cut it right here before the camera pans backwards.
So like right around here, cut the rest, and we should just have a slow movement of the camera around
the car.
Right click on the icon.
Enable Time remapping and stretch out this track.
Once we have this, we're going to make some keyframes to make this more dynamic.
Grab your pen tool and maybe around here I want to slow down.
Around here.
I wanted to be fast again.
Grab your selection tool and just make those adjustments.
Something like this.
I'm going to slow down the middle section just by a bit so you get this.
Perfect.
So once I have this, I'm going to repeat what we did, beginning with a duplicate of my video.
First, let's test it because we applied speed ramping.
Call it speed.
Duplicate this and put it right above on this.
We're going to mask out our car beginning at the start of the video.
It doesn't have to be that perfect because one, it's further away.
And two, we're going to use a lot of motion blur.
All right.
I have my selection, and we're just going to increase the feather, then mask expansion.
Then we're going to track the mask.
Which again, should be pretty easy because the car doesn't move that much.
Once you're done with the key framing, I'm going to duplicate this again.
Now that we have the keyframes, right click and next this pull this motion car on motion car, we're
going to repeat what we did.
Offset.
Enable the stopwatch at the beginning.
Go to the end and increase this to the max amount, which is 32,000 767.
Now we got ourself this fast movement.
Go to the effect controls, blurt this out with a simple directional blur.
On motion car.
You can lock speed duplicate to avoid ruining things.
And then we're going to increase the amount.
Quite a lot.
Changing the direction to the well motion of the car.
So we have this fast movement.
You may have to work with your masking here.
You just need to go in your speed layer and work with these key frames.
An easier way to get a cleaner mask is to have maybe after Effects or MOCA.
But I'm just trying to keep it simple here so you can just modify the mask if you want.
Now, here we have the option to kind of color these repetitions.
Go right here.
Get the tint effect added on motion car.
And we can map black to any color you want.
Really?
Let's try a vibrant cyan.
Then.
Okay, so this becomes a ghost thing that is going through your car.
Now we're going to duplicate this, the motion car effect and remove the tint from the top duplicate.
Then just grab the bottom duplicate which had the blue tint.
Offset this so that it does not start with the
original coloring.
So we have this like colored ghost effect and you can just keep on doing this until you get like until
you have multiple colors.
So I'm going to duplicate motion one more time, offset it this time, change black into something different.
Let's try magenta.
So now we get cyan.
Magenta.
Push this up to this one more time with the yellow.
So we have like C and K.
Here we are.
So we have these colors going through the car and creating something awesome.
You can invert things, add colors, and really just get creative with this effect.
It's really up to you and how you like it.
So that's how we can do this motion swipe effect and get something really cool.
You can also switch things up so you get a vertical effect rather than a horizontal one.
Instead of adding it to this part on position X, you can do position Y so that the repetitions go vertically.
So I hope you guys enjoyed this simple effect.
Let's move on to the next lesson.


### 12. Freeze Frame

In today's lesson, we're going to learn three freeze frame transitions that you can do inside Premiere
Pro.
So let's get started.
You're going to need four videos for these transitions.
And in all of them, you want to make sure that your subject is well separated from the background.
This will make masking easier.
Let's make a sequence from our clips.
Place your videos right next to each other and then color code your layers.
Once your layers are ready, we're going to begin with our first transition.
I'm going to push these to the side so we can focus on one transition at a time.
Duplicate your second video by holding down option or alt clicking and dragging it up.
Select your duplicate right click.
At frame hold.
This is going to give you a freeze frame that we can just use to make the transition.
Once you have your frame hold, you want to get rid of the parts where everything is normal.
So you're basically looking for the freeze frame and the original video to play at the same time.
So if I hide my freeze frame layer, the bottom layer has the exact same movement.
Now hold down, shift on your keyboard and click on this button once and I can just pull this freeze
frame over.
Cut the extra bits from the freeze frame so you should have something like this.
It should freeze and then freeze without any interruption.
So this should look like it's one video and that's how the transition will take place.
If you are one frame off, you're going to ruin the whole thing.
So make sure that you check like this so that there isn't any interruptions.
If you were a few frames off, just delete this duplicate again, add frame hold and then cut the two
videos on exactly one frame.
All right, so this is my freeze frame right now.
I'm just going to use my I'm just going to mask out my subject.
So click on this effect controls.
Opacity, grab my pen tool and then I can just draw around my subject.
Hit a V on your keyboard and make this full screen.
If you don't know why your shortcut for this is, just go to keyboard shortcuts.
So I'm just hitting this key on my keyboard to get this full screen effect.
You can change your shortcut right here.
All right.
Once I have this on full screen, I can have a better view as to where I am asking.
So click and drag to make curves and just go around your subject.
We are going to be using motion blur for this, but you still want to make sure that it's good enough
so that we don't get like white lines around our subject.
When we do the transition.
Once you're done, you should have a cutout of your subject.
Click that key again.
That was for full screen and get back to your original layout.
All right.
So I have this right now.
It's looking good.
I'm just going to remove the feather and turn off my first food track so I can check if everything is
good.
So I'm getting a few of these lines.
This is an easy fix with mask expansion.
Let's go for negative six and add the tiniest amount of feather.
So five for feather, negative six for mask expansion.
Now you should have a pretty good cut out of your subject.
We're just going to miss this right click.
Nest.
Let's call this subject mask.
All right, Get rid of this.
And now you should have something like this.
So before we move forward, play it back.
The cutout should appear, and then right after the video continues.
So there should be no breaks and no complications here.
All right, let's add a transformer effect.
Right.
And our subject mask.
Now, you can animate this any way you like, so you can make it count from below, from the left to
right, not from above, because the bottom is connected.
So choose your preferred method of animation.
I'm just going to bring it from below.
So make a keyframe for position.
Bring it forward, Maybe.
Few frames forward.
And I can see that this is five frames.
Count five frames back and extend this freeze frame.
Go into your nested clip and increase it so that you have more than five frames.
Ten frames Extend this.
Go back to your original sequence and now you should have 10 seconds off your freeze frame.
So now make a keyframe for position at the end of your first frame.
Go to the beginning and pull it in whichever direction you want.
So mine will be from below, Pull it down and you should have something like this.
Let's right click on these two.
The closer you bring these two, the faster the transition to play with the speed and see what looks
better.
Grab both of your keyframes.
Right click.
Let's make it busier.
So this will come in a lot better.
And not to be stiff.
All right, then come down here and enable motion blur.
Let's try 200 degrees.
If it's too much, we can just reduce from it.
All right.
I want mine to be a little slower.
I'm going to bring it back
and just play around with the positioning.
All right, let's try 150 so I can see a little bit on my subject when they emerge from below.
Cool.
So this is the most basic way of a freeze frame transition.
It was really easy to do.
Didn't take that much time.
And now moving forward, we're going to just elevate this and add some additional stuff.
Now, one thing that you want to do is to set contrast between your video one and video two.
So because I have the same subject in different angles.
One thing that I can do is to add some sort of color grading or special effect to make this look a little
different.
Go to the effects panel and I will add maybe.
The Lumia trip reset.
Let's take a look.
Monochrome.
Maybe make something extreme.
And now the transition will stand out a lot better and see it stands out better.
Once you have your preset.
You can actually go in here and fix the amount.
There you go.
We have the metric color stuff so we can just work with this and make it either brighter or darker.
All right, so this was my first transition.
Let's move on to the next one.
So the next one will be from this video onto this video.
So again, it's a subject I'm just going to skip to around here so we get a different angle.
Let's cut the first bit and maybe we can start it when he's about to take off his jacket.
So once we have this, we're going to repeat what we did.
Option or alt click and drag right above.
Go to the beginning of this second video, right click on the duplicate add frame hold.
So you should have a picture on the top track.
Now, with this picture, we're going to again, mask it out, use mass expansion and feather to make
it perfect and then we can continue with the rest of the effect.
So I'm just going to do that real quick and then I'll be right back.
So here is my subject.
Once I hide my first trick, I can see that I'm good to go.
So now we want to move back ten frames again.
Hold downshift.
Go back twice.
Bring this over and cut the area where it interacts with you, too.
So again, we have this picture situation and that's pretty good.
So now we're going to repeat what we did, which is to nest this freeze frame.
Now, this mask subject, add the transform effect right above.
And just add that animation.
This time I will make them come from the other side.
So go to the end of the mask subject layer position and then go to the beginning.
Pull it towards the right or towards the left.
Make sure they are completely out of frame.
And of course, enable motion blur.
Let's go with 140.
So now we have this effect.
So now we're going to grab the video again, get one frame of it.
So click it.
Hit this once to get one frame.
Cut the stream duplicated and move your mask subject to one layer up.
Bring this underneath.
So stretch this like so at frame hold.
And you should have like a picture of this motion.
And this is the same as our subject mask layer.
So just extend this as the, the same length as your mask subject layer and delete this cut meet.
So now basically you have one cut, which is the subject alone, one cut which is everything.
So you have the subject and the background.
They are both freeze frames, go to your mask subject, nest into your video and copy mask one, command
your control Z, Go back here and paste it into your freeze frame.
Select opacity, Command V and now you have two freeze frames, one that has the animation and one that
doesn't.
The reason why we didn't just duplicate the nest is because the nested layers are connected.
So if I alter it with the settings in one duplicate, it's going to affect our main layer.
So that's why we didn't just duplicate this.
So now on this, we're going to invert the mask.
So we want the background and not the subject background subject.
So that's what we need.
On the background layer, I'm going to just nested first.
Call this background or be in your effects panel, Look for the crop effect.
And add it on your background layer.
Now bring your mask subject right here, and we're just going to move in 5 seconds forward.
Bring our Transform keyframe here so we get like 5 seconds of the subject just chilling.
We can alter this later.
Let me just let me just change this to here.
All right.
So we have our mask subject has a keyframe for the right side, comes in to the middle five frames later.
All right, now, on this second keyframe, we're going to grab the background layer.
Make a keyframe for top and bottom.
So for bottom, we're going to bring it up 50%, which is half of our video.
Top will also be 50%.
So the background should be hidden.
Go forward in time till the end of your transition and turn it back to zero.
So you should get this window effect just showing up from behind your subject.
Pull these guys a frame forward so we get like a full display before we move on to the rest of the video.
So the subject just comes in like this.
And then the background shows up.
Then the video just continues.
All right.
Looking good for the background.
I'm just going to add some sort of blur because I'm not a fan of these harsh lines, directional blur
on the background freeze frame, go to effect controls and just blur it as necessary, change the direction
to whichever you prefer.
And now we have a better look.
Let's do 140.
So now we get this.
Affect.
Going to reduce the length a little so it looks a bit more natural.
Just a little bit of blur.
So this way we can have the background showing up and the subject showing up in a creative way.
So this is what we have.
You can always alter the key frames so that the background shows up with the subject or later.
It's really just a matter of moving these key frames forward or backwards.
So this was our second freeze frame transition.
Let's look at our third one, pull in my final video, and now we're just transitioning into this clip.
So for our third transition, we have this video and I'm just going to go in forward until we're closer
to the subject.
Let's do something like this.
Cut it where you want it to start.
Get rid of the excess bit, then put it next to your first video.
So video two, Video one.
Over here, we're going to bring our play at the start of video to the last video.
Good.
One frame.
Cut it and just duplicate.
So pull this up by holding down option or alt.
Then clicking and dragging it up.
Now on this guy, we're going to right click.
Ad frame hold increases.
So we get a picture of our subject.
Now, we're going to bring this over our last video by going back ten frames.
Bring this backwards.
So we have our previous video picture that lasts for 10 seconds and then we cut it here to get the rest
of our video.
Okay, So.
All right, So we're going to do something a little different.
But of course, it begins with the same masking procedure.
So I made my mask from the subject with the following mask, feather and expansion settings.
So now we want to do a simple position key framing.
Go to the end of your freeze frame.
Add a key frame for position.
Go to the beginning and just pull your subject completely out of frame.
Since he is on a vehicle, I want to make it look like he's riding in on the left towards the original
point.
So now we have this zoom effect.
Let's make the keyframes busier.
So now we're going to duplicate this freeze frame for as many times as you want and then offset each
one.
So we get this clone effect.
They all show up in the same position, but we just want to make it.
Offset like this.
Go to your top two clones and push this back.
So by the end of this transition, all of the clones are in one place.
They're just backwards like this.
And if you want to increase this, we can actually go to the first position keyframe and change it from
what it was.
So maybe push it back.
Even more.
And that's going to give us.
The a little space between our subjects.
So in the original, we had 1821.
Here we can have something more than 1821.
So let's go for like 1921.
And for the final one, we can go for like
-2131.
So you're just changing the positioning and this will give us this clone effect.
All right.
So now to have the clones stand out, we're going to add like a tense effect onto each one, especially
the one in the middle.
So I tend to the middle one map.
Like to like a random color.
All right, amount to tint.
We can lower this.
We try, like a reddish color maybe.
All right, looking good.
And we can have the third one, kind of the first one, actually, to have like a blue effect, blue
color.
I mean, just to bring this whole thing together.
Reduce the amount to 40.
Just as we did with the first clone.
So there we go.
We have this effect.
So now we have our movement.
You bring us back, said my in and out point, and we can take a look at a preview.
So it now looks a little awkward because we haven't added Blur yet and we're just going to do that real
quick.
We can cut the access bit from clone number two and three since the key frames are the end here.
Just pull them back one frame so we don't cut out the animation.
All right.
Now, nest, all of these three.
Call them clones.
And now, on the clone layer, we can just add anything.
Really?
So it can be like a directional blur.
A flicker effect, tinta effect.
Anything you want.
So let's start with directional blur.
And add -65 degrees so that the direction matches the movement.
So here is the final transition.
It was really simple to do and freeze frames are just a great way to play around with your subjects
cut out.
Again, this is a really high transition, so make sure it's relevant to what's happening inside your
video.
Now that we know some transitions using freeze frames, let's move on to our next lesson.


### 13. Cross Object

This transition is really easy and really cool and we're going to make it into this lesson.
So let's get started.
You're going to need some videos.
I got four here because we're going to do two transitions.
Now, the type of video is really important because we're going to need objects that cover the camera.
So this is one example.
You can see that this area of the wall is covering the camera and then we reveal the subject.
I have another video that does the same.
So we get this object covering the screen.
So you're going to need to videos like this.
The other two can be any other clip.
Begin by making a sequence from your first video.
Drag your second video underneath.
So pull your first video up.
Second video underneath.
Now, because the pan motion happened in the beginning, I'm just going to reverse my video so that
we get to see our subject first and then do the transition.
So now my video is reverse.
And I can do my transition here.
So bring your play head to where the other end of your object shows up.
Somewhere around here and we're going to make a mask the go to where we can see half of the video.
Grab your pen tool and just make a straight line.
Now, the type of object that covers the camera is important because it can save you a lot of time if
you have a maybe a geometric shape like this.
So you can see with one line I was able to just mask out that part of my video, close off the mask.
And there we are.
Further at the edges with ten.
Let's click away and I think we'll need a little bit more.
If needed, you can try mask expansion.
Let's try negative five and go for like 24 feather.
So mark this area on your keyboard so that we know this is the first mask and then we're going to make
our first keyframe for a mass path.
So the marker is going to remind us where our first keyframe has to be.
So we may not do the keyframes and we're just going to make a track movement.
And since the camera is moving in one direction and we have a rectangle, I just need to go to the end
and just pull this guy back.
So just grab it and pull it to where the column is.
So now you should have like a smooth movement from your last keyframe until the first one.
And then just continue until column has left.
Always be sure to check your keyframes, because sometimes we get like a harsh edge or there is a need
to like rotate your mask.
Let's set our in and out points, render this and see if we have a clean transition.
So we do have that.
Now we just need to repeat this before our first keyframe.
So going forward, I'm just going to extend my mask.
You can grab the points here and just pull it to the other side.
So we get something like this and then before that, there's no need to do anything.
Let's render this and take a look.
And now we get the wall just going away and us getting the second video.
Now around here, we want to make the video disappear so I can just cut it after this point.
And there's my second video.
So it's as simple as that.
It's all about the type of video that you have and your masking.
So this was our first transition.
Let's move on to the second one or the second video.
We have a unique situation where the object does cover the camera, but not all the way.
So what we're going to do is to just zoom in on this video so that.
The subject just covers the entire screen.
You can use position X and Y to make it happen.
So now we get a complete coverage.
When the camera goes blue.
So now once we have this, we're going to take this into after effects so that we can do some sort of
flipping.
Grab both of these clips, right click after Effects composition once we're in after Effects.
Go ahead and name your layers.
The first one is the rock, the second one is landscape.
So what we're going to do is to just duplicate the rock layer, going to change the color so that it's
easier to work with, command your control.
DX And we're going to hit R to completely flip it over 180 degrees.
There we go.
Now we're going to zoom out and kind of have the video underneath the first one.
So this is Rock to bring it underneath rock and with position, we want to just pull this down.
Completely out of frame.
So once we have this, we're going to reverse the first video.
So we get the camera moving towards the rock, and then here we can kind of flip into the landscape.
Zoom in right here.
Let's add a freeze frame.
I'm just going to pull this here so we get this picture, but before everything is normal.
So right on this picture, I'm going to make a mask.
With my pen tool, we can actually use the Polygon tool.
Just make a little cut at the bottom, invert your mask and feather it out quite a bit.
All right.
So we don't want the mask here before this.
Make a key frame for a mask path.
One here, go back one frame and just move this completely out of frame so we don't get the mask.
And then we get the mask.
So right on this layer, when we get the mask, we're going to push our second video up.
So hit pee on your rock to make a keyframe on position, push it back, matching it with the second
keyframe up here.
We're going to pull it up.
We have to reverse this layer first so we get the rock at the same time.
Make a keyframe for position.
When the mask is not there, move forward to when the mask is there and just pull it up.
Try to match the positioning of the rock so we can actually create a mask layer at the bottom of the
second rock to.
Inverted.
And we can feather it out.
If you see the edge here, just use the position keyframes to kind of pull it higher than it was something
like this.
So now the two rocks look like they're from one place.
All right, looking good.
Let's add a marker right where these are happening.
Then bring the second video underneath.
So now we're going to make a new adjustment layer.
Call this control rock length to to rock reduce to control rock.
It's P and we're just going to, like, flip this over when the transition needs to happen.
So make a keyframe for position.
Go forward.
And just pull this up until we are on the other side and of course, completely out of frame.
Make a freeze frame for this video.
Right click.
Freeze frame.
And just leave it on screen until it leaves.
So extend this.
So we should get this elevator effect, of course.
And longer, the better.
On rock, too.
We also want to, like, make this area a bit better.
So let's make to mask.
Grab it.
Zoom right in.
And using the pen tool, we're going to just follow the curve.
Click and drag to make your curve.
And because it's a rock.
We can like take a little bit inwards and make this look better, close it off like this, and we're
going to change the mask type to subtract, of course, add to the feather.
And now we have a softer edge when we're doing the elevator effect is easier Keyframes Go to the speed
graph and just fix this up.
So we get a smoother movement in this back.
Pretty good.
So just play around with your key frames until you have what you're looking for.
But now we can reveal our second video and make it look like we went underneath the rock, which was
here.
Once you're done, hit command se control se on windows, then go back to Premiere Pro.
So this was another transition that you can do really simple and it just needs a certain type of camera
movement in your video in order to make this work.
So I hope you guys enjoyed this lesson and I will see you in D next one.


### 14. Speed Ramp

We're going to be creating these really cool transitions using speed ramping.
So let's get started.
So I have a clip right here, which I just cut into pieces based on the movements we already know how
to use speed ramping inside Premiere Pro.
But in today's lesson, we're going to see how we can use it creatively to get really cool transitions.
Later on, we're going to add some cool effects and just take it to the next level.
So we're going to do three transitions in this lesson.
The first one is going from this clip to this clip.
So notice that all of these videos have some sort of movement.
And that's precisely what we need.
If your videos are static or shot on a tripod, then this will not look great.
Begin by stretching your video track and then enable time remapping on all of these layers.
So let's begin with the first transition.
So let's push these videos aside.
And all of these videos on their own are in slow motion, so you're going to have to speed them up quite
a bit more than you normally would.
So I'm going to make my first point here.
Hold down command or control.
Click to make your point.
Leaves you first bit to be normal for the second bit, we're just going to go really high.
Because like we said, the videos are in slow motion and we just want to make them look faster.
So you can see even this is pretty slow.
So go even higher to like just a crazy amount.
This is a transition, so take it up to the max amount and then we're going to get a good transition.
Once you have this, we're going to separate the marker here so we can get a more gradual effect.
So that was our first video To see the transition.
We need our second clip.
So here the camera is moving out.
On the car and I'm going to get this video instead, because in the first one we had a rotation effect
and I want that in the second video to.
So here we're going to do the opposite, meaning that the video is going to be fast in the beginning
and then slow after.
So hold down command or control somewhere around here.
Pull this up a lot.
Trying to match the amount that we had.
So this is the simplest format of a speech transition.
But now for the rest of the clips, we're going to level up as we go.
So the first one, let's bring it in.
And make our transition.
So we're going to just do something similar.
Fast, slow.
Command or control.
Then make this fast again.
Then do the same thing on the other video.
So pull this up.
Same amount.
And then get rid of the rest.
So now this is what we have.
Now let's put something in between these two clips just to make it look cool.
So begin by making a new adjustment layer.
Then added above the two clips.
Put your head in between the clips and then count five frames from each side.
Then go back to the middle and count five frames.
All right.
On the adjustment layer, we're going to add an effect which is called We Are Glitch.
Add this on your adjustment layer.
And you're going to go to the effect controls.
So we get this glitch that you can see right here.
Go to the center of your two videos and set a keyframe for Master Amplitude at 100.
Go to the beginning.
Turn this to zero and the end zero.
So we're going to get this glitch effect.
And the closer you bring these, the better.
So just experiment.
So I'm going to set mine to frames from the start and did two frames on the end.
All right, so that's the amplitude.
Next, we want to add some color distortion.
So open distortion right here.
It's a little folder.
Come down to color distortion and go to the middle, increasing it to 100.
So you're going to get more of this RG Separation.
Make a keyframe, go to the first keyframe from Master Amplitude, then turn it to zero.
So we're going to get this glitch effect.
Really simple transition.
Let's take a look.
You can always work with the key frames to get a slower or faster result.
All right, let's do this one more time with our last clip and add another graphic transmission.
So here we already have these slow motion going on.
Going to increase this and speed this up by holding down command control, increasing it to the same
amount.
So now we're going to do another transition here.
Starting with an adjustment layer.
Again, we're going to count five frames going to the left, five frames going to the right.
On this, we're going to add an effect called var chromatic aberration at this right above.
So this is going to separate the RG values.
But there is no glitch.
Sit down here.
Bring your head at the center and we're going to randomize the operation.
So let's try 25.
Negative six.
Then go to the beginning or like a few frames before this, turning these back to zero.
Repeat this on the other side.
Three frames forward.
000.
So we're going to get a chromatic aberration effect.
Next, we're going to put on some fallout invert, which is going to give it like a flash effect.
Turn this on and each keyframe, we want to invert it.
So one is inverted, one is not.
And just keep doing this until you reach the end of the transition so that glitches in with some RGB
separation.
So that's pretty good.
I may have to increase the length, which I can simply do by increasing my adjustment layer.
Let's make each side ten frames and alter the key frames.
So this was a really simple transition that you can do inside Premiere Pro and you can just alter the
key frames and their spacing to get a different result.
So I hope you guys enjoyed these really simple speed trap transitions.
Let's move on to the next lesson.


### 15. Fast & Easy Transition Ideas

In today's lesson, we're going to see how we can create these really fast and easy transitions.
I have three videos right here, and we're going to begin by making a sequence.
The first transition is a speed blur transition.
You're going to zoom in onto your timeline, have your head right in between the two and count five
frames from each side.
Hold down, shift and just change your color.
Hold downshift, click this once five frames, make a marker, then go back five frames.
Another marker.
Now we're going to cut this bit so we get these pieces.
So we just cut this for reference.
Go to the effects panel and look for the directional blur effect.
Add it onto this cut and the same one onto the other cut.
Effect controls.
And we're going to move to the last frame of the first video.
Let me just extend this.
Make a key frame at the end for a large number, maybe 200.
Then add your direction.
Let's go for 60.
Start the stopwatch on these numbers, then go back three frames.
Reset the parameters so we get the original video.
So we get this blur effect.
If you're seeing these black edges, we can simply zoom in onto our video by going in here.
So maybe 110.
And be sure to do it for your for the rest of the video.
Now, go on to your second cut at the start of the video.
And repeat the same numbers.
So 110 for scale, 60 direction to 100 blur length enable the stopwatch for these to move into three
frames and reset the parameters.
Be sure to skip the other video.
And now we have a really simple speed blur effect that you can use in any video.
And now we have this really simple speed blur effect that you can use in any video.
Now the direction that you choose determines the direction of your speaker.
So this was 60.
But if I change this into maybe 180, I will get a different result.
Let's try 180 degrees and now we're going to get a different direction for the speed blur.
So this was our first transition.
Let's delete these two middle sections and bring the video back.
The second transition is going to be a flash transition.
We're going to begin with a simple adjustment layer added right in between and cut it based on the markers
that we made.
So now we should have this adjustment layer right in between the two videos and get the brightness and
contrast effect.
Add this right on and we're going to bring the planet in between the two videos, increase the brightness
and contrast.
So we get this really bright look.
Make a keyframe, go back three frames.
One, two, three.
Reset the parameters.
Repeat that on the other side.
You can make this even longer, but this is how it's going to look.
This was our second transition.
Let's move on to the third one.
The third transition involves some position keyframes.
We're going to have our two videos again.
So have your play head in the middle.
Hold down.
Shift.
Move back five frames by clicking on this button.
Now we're going to make a keyframe for position.
Go to the end of this video and just pull the clip entirely out of frame.
So I'm not sure if we have it right.
Let's zoom in.
So choose the direction.
And you just need to make this simple motion.
Once you have this, we're going to right click here.
To make the movement better.
Right on this key frame.
Move one frame back, make it cut.
And we're just going to pull these guys one level up, putting the second video underneath.
So when the first clip moves to the side, we get the second one underneath.
Now I'm going to add a simple directional blur effect
right on this guy.
And I will just increase the amount.
So go to the first keyframe.
Of the position value and turn on the stopwatch before that reset the parameters.
So now you're going to get this speed polar movement.
And that is our third transition.
You can try this in any other direction, and it's pretty easy to customize.
Our last transition is a little bit more complex only because we're going to be masking.
So I will delete these two videos and get our third clip.
So for the third clip, let's get a color match with like a nude color.
Put it right underneath and have our clip over it.
This move in one frame.
Make a cut.
Right click on this.
So we have this picture and then we get the rest of the video.
So we're going to just grab the controls and make a really rough cut out so this does not have to be
perfect.
We actually want the rough edge here and we just want a really obvious cut out.
So it's like we have cut out this subject from paper.
Zoom out and close the mask so there is a rough cut out.
Remove the feather so that it looks perfect.
Once I click away, we have this.
We have our subject show up like a sticker.
Now, on this sticker you can apply some color grading with the three presets.
I think I will go with like a monochrome version.
I change my colour, matte into maybe a light blue just so it looks better.
Go back to effect controls and first have your subject show up in a really awkward way.
Go forward in time, maybe
five frames forward.
Make a keyframe for position and rotation.
Then go backwards and completely remove the subject from the screen.
Make another one for rotation.
So as these subject is making their way up, we want to add some random rotation keyframes.
So maybe it's 4.5 degrees there.
Six here.
Here.
It can like, go the other way and we're making it look like.
The subject is just flipping around to get on screen.
And this is the final area where they settle.
Going to make more space here so we can do the rest of our animation and then make a marker.
So from the start until this point, the sticker is coming up and now we're just going to begin extending
the mask path.
So make a keyframe for the current path that you have.
And we're just going to extend it as if it were a cut out animation.
So we're going to grab the mask.
And very awkwardly pull these points up.
So again, it doesn't have to be perfect.
Just kind of slowly introduce the rest of the video by pulling these out.
You can also click and drag to choose multiple points and move them at the same time.
So once you made this cut out, we're going to go forward until you can see the whole frame.
So once you have this, you want to just create some space between each keyframe.
So now we have an effect like this.
And that is pretty good.
Let's just move the video back so it reveals on the blue mat and then it just plays like normal.
So you can do this with other clips.
If you want to make it a transition, you just have to replace color mat with another video.
Let's delete that and put in our first clip so that this becomes a transition from video, a YouTube
video be.
You can add some paper textures and make this the way you want it.
And that is our final transition.
So I hope you guys enjoyed these really fast and easy transitions.
And now let's move on to our next lesson.


### 16. More Transition Ideas

In today's lesson, we're going to learn about some masking transitions that you can do inside Premiere
Pro.
So let's get started.
I have four videos right here and that totals two three transitions.
Go ahead and download them from your resource pack and import them into Premiere Pro.
So let's start with an easy one.
We're going to get our first clip, make a sequence, put the second clip right next to it.
Label your second clip.
And bring it above the first clip.
So I have my second video on top of the first one.
And we're going to begin by moving into the effects controls, then using the pen tool draw like a slice
from this video.
So like a slanted rectangle going around your subject.
Something like this, then duplicate this layer option or alt click and drag and we're going to grab
the mask on the duplicate and just move it onto another side.
You can do like three slices or two depends on you.
I'm going to go with three.
So pull one here, pull the second one towards the center.
The third one.
We're going to move it to the other side.
Hide your first layer and make sure that the spacing between these guys is good.
So once you have your three slices, we're going to add the crop effect on all three.
So.
One, two, three.
Go on to the first one.
So I'm going to make a keyframe for bottom zero, pull it forward, and then 100 at the beginning.
So we're going to have this reveal, which is really slow right now.
So just pull them in closer to get a faster result.
To make this even better, we're going to right click.
This year.
So now that is looking so much better.
Next, we want to do the same thing on all the other ones.
I think I'll just copy crop command so you can see.
Go to my third clip.
Which is the one on the other side and paste it here.
So now both of these guys are going to come in like this.
The middle one, I will have it come from the other way so we can just make a keyframe for top.
Let me just match it with the previous keyframes.
Have you play it here and now.
I can go in the middle video and make a keyframe for top add 0%.
Go to the beginning and make it 100.
Turn them both into busier.
And now we should have.
Reveals like this.
If you want them to show up at different times, you just need to work with the crop keyframes.
So, for example, I will go in my second video and pull the keyframes a little forward so that they
show up after my first slice.
So grab the first keyframe, move it two frames forward, and now they're not going to show up at the
same time.
Do the same thing with your third keyframe, and then you're going to have.
Like a more randomized version.
Let's turn these to into busier.
And I'm going to start this here.
So first cut, shoes up, second cut, and then the third cut.
It's only a matter of changing the position of these key frames.
So once the lines have revealed our video, we're going to begin with mask expansion, keyframes.
After my slices are here.
And to go to my first clip zero four mass expansion, move like three frames forward and just extend
it until it reaches the other slice.
Repeat this with slice number two.
So zero.
One, two, three.
And just extend the amount until you don't get any black bars.
So now we should have like a slice review and going to have the reveal happen at the same time.
So I'm going to have my plate here, go to my next video and make sure that the first keyframe.
Starts there as well.
So the reveal happens at the same time.
So there is my transition looking good if I bring my other video back.
It's going to look something like this.
You can make this look better by adding some motion blur and just making it perfect.
So I'm just going to do a color animation, move these guys one floor up.
Get a color preset.
Duplicate your first video and add that preset on it.
So I guess I'll go with this.
It's going to be black and white, and I can just do a simple opacity animation.
So like when the animation for my second video happens, the first video turns black and white, 100%
opacity bullet forward, then 0%.
So it's going to turn.
Black and white.
And then the second video shows up five frames before the transition move in my second key frame.
So this will happen faster.
Vizier to two key frames.
And that is our first transition.
This way I can see a better contrast between video one and video two.
So that was our first transition.
We can just go ahead and nest all of these color transition one move forward, cut everything, command
K or control K, and now I can get ready for my next transition.
Video One can be cut a little sooner too.
So now I need to transition from this video onto our next video.
Which is this video.
So I have my second video right after the first one.
We were first going to grab some rulers and slice up our video into into the amount of slices that we
want.
So I want three.
Therefore I need two rulers.
Next, we're going to grab the polygon mask.
And match the points to the rulers.
And just duplicate this for as many slices as you need.
Second, duplicate grab your mask path and just pull this up.
Third one.
Mask path.
Pull it down.
So when you move the rulers, your feet, you should just look normal.
And we're not supposed to get these black lines.
So zoom right in and move them up or down if needed.
So now when I click away, my video just looks normal.
But in reality, we just cut it into three pieces.
So when you play it back, there should be no black lines and everything should look normal.
Now we're going to pull these three above transition one or your previous video and just have these
guys show up from the left to the right.
So go to the effects panel and get the transform effect, placing it on one of them.
Go inside.
Go to the beginning of the video.
Then count five frames.
On this fifth frame, we're going to make a key frame for position.
Go to the beginning and just pull this completely towards the right.
So it should be out of frame.
Turn these into busier.
And add motion blur.
Let's take a look.
So now this guy is going to be like this and it will just show up.
If the motion blur is too much, you can just lower the amount to get a smoother result.
Now copy the transform effect and paste it onto your other two cuts.
Next, we just need to offset the key frames so they show up one at a time.
So this will be my first slice.
Let's count two frames, one to go to the second slice and pull this forward.
So the second slice will show up after two frames.
Finally go to your third slice, which is this one count two frames and bring the keyframes forward.
So you should get like this staircase effect.
And that's looking pretty good.
So this is my second transition.
Let's miss these call this transition, too.
So that was our second transition.
Let's move on to the final one for the final transition.
I have this video.
It's a clear cut of a subject.
When I make sure that the head of your subject is separated from the top.
From the start of the video.
Right click.
Go to the beginning of your video, right click, insert, frame, hold segment.
So this is the picture.
We just need three frames from it.
We may cut it later.
Command K, get rid of that.
And this is the rest of transition to which we just cut by accident.
So we have this picture and then the rest of the video place.
Now, grab the picture, go to the beginning, and just mask out your subjects.
If you hold down option, you get to work with one of these handles.
And that's perfect for these situations where you have a curve here, but you don't want to curve here.
Once you have a cut out of your subject, are you going to click away?
Make sure that everything is good and make the feather less for points or a feather.
And now we're going to do a simple position animation, move into frames, keyframe for position, go
back to frames and move this completely out of frame.
So it's going to show up from the side.
And if you want it to last longer, just push this aside and increase your freeze frame.
So I'm going to count five frames from the beginning of this freeze frame and pull this frame back so
we get something like this.
I will count ten frames from the beginning.
Hold downshift.
Click on this twice and move the second key frame for ten frames.
And now it shows up a lot slower.
All right, so now we're just going to duplicate this for as many times as we need.
Now, on each of these guys, we're going to offset the position.
Key frames.
This is the first one.
Let's have the subject show up.
The top one is actually your main one.
So these three are your duplicates.
Now go to the beginning and I think I'll have my come from below instead of the side.
So I can do like, a clone effect from the left and the right.
So go to the beginning and we're going to reset all of these guys.
Then we're just going to push this down all the way.
So the top one shows up from below.
And we want it to happen pretty fast.
Maybe three frames.
It shows up from below and ends up where the video is.
So.
1253 Now for these guys, we're going to have it come from these sides.
So go to your top video where the subject shows up.
We're going to move into our first duplicates, have it be exactly where the first video is, and then
we're just going to move in a few frames for frames, push it to the side, maybe like next to them,
and then at the end of the transition, push it back.
So just copy the first keyframe, paste it there.
So if I hide the other two and before the first video shows up, we want the bottom video to just not
be here.
So let's make a opacity keyframe 100%, move it one frame forward, then 0%.
So there's nothing.
And then our clone shows up.
All right.
And I think I'll delete these, too, and just copy the first clone so that it's easier duplicated once.
Move to the first keyframe.
And now instead of like here, we're going to push it to the opposite end.
So we get like.
Clones.
Of our subject.
And then it goes back in and the place.
Now you can just duplicate these too many times and have it look like he has just a lot of clones.
So for this one, go to the middle and change the position so that you fill in those gaps.
The top layer should be your center clone.
So if you want, you can just pull this way up and just have it out of sight, duplicate these guys
and fill up the little gaps.
Be sure to move them into center keyframe.
You can also work with the orders so that they don't go on top of each other and behind one another.
So now we get this effect.
And to separate the main subject from the rest, we can add a simple monochrome three preset.
Faded.
Put it on all of your clothes.
So we're just showing that these guys are the clones.
He is the main person.
So that was another set of transitions that you can do inside Premiere Pro.
They're all really easy and you can just put them onto your next video.
So I hope you guys enjoyed this set of transitions.
Let's move on to our next lesson.
