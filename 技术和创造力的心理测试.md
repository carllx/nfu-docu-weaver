`Psychological test for technical ability and creativity`

There are many psychological tests that can measure different aspects of creativity, such as divergent thinking, problem-solving, imagination, and personality traits. One of the most widely used measures of creativity is the **Torrance Test of Creative Thinking (TTCT)** ¹², which consists of several tasks that require the test-taker to complete an image, give a title and a caption to a picture, or list as many uses as possible for an object. The TTCT evaluates the creativity skills of fluency, originality, elaboration, abstractness, and resistance to premature closure¹.

Another test that can assess creativity is the **Creative Problem-solving Test**⁴, which measures the attitude and approach to solving problems in novel and effective ways. This test evaluates the cognitive abilities of flexibility, tolerance of ambiguity, and self-confidence⁴.

There are also tests that can measure the creative personality traits, such as perseverance, risk-taking, non-conformity, and psychoticism⁶. Some examples are the **Creative Personality Scale**⁶, the **Creative Behavior Inventory**⁶, and the **Creative Temperament Scale**⁶.

Technical ability is not directly measured by creativity tests, but it can be related to some of the skills and traits that are involved in creative thinking, such as problem-solving, abstractness, and dominance⁶. However, technical ability can also depend on the specific domain and context of the creative task, such as art, science, or engineering. Therefore, it may be useful to complement the creativity tests with domain-specific tests that can measure the technical knowledge and skills of the students.

I hope this helps you find the best psychological test for your creative class.�
