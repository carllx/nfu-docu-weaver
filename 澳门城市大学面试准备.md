人文主义 - 反迷信
中世纪, 文艺复兴(人文主义反宗教), 过于迷信科学, 世界大战(人文主义反科学)
人文主义的发展历程
从中世纪盲目的宗教迷信到文艺复兴时期，人文主义兴起并开始以科学精神对抗宗教迷信。然而随后人们又走向了另一个极端，过分迷信科学。直到两次世界大战带来的惨痛教训，才促使人类重新审视人文主义价值，重新思考科学的意义和界限。

自我介绍:

- 我现在在广州美术学院雕塑与公共艺术学院担任数字雕塑课程的讲师, 教授如何用数字技术雕刻数字雕塑.  I am currently a lecturer of digital sculpture courses at the Guangzhou Academy of Fine Arts, teaching how to sculpt sculptures using digital technology.

- 我毕业于意大利佛罗伦萨美术学院, 视觉语言专业. 在意大利十年我有充足的时间和安静的环境学习数字技术的研究.

I graduated from the Academy of Fine Arts in Florence, majoring in `New Expressive Languages` for my master's degree.

During my ten years of study in Italy, I learned visual and computer languages. I focused on how to make applications more user-friendly.

I aslo see application as eviroment of human living.

```markdown
- 在我的本科生涯, 我在广州美术学院接受传统雕塑创作教育。在毕业之际, 我意识到很多静物他应该拥有自己的生命, 而数字媒介可以为我们强调这种感觉。 During my undergraduate years, I received a traditional sculpture education at the Guangzhou Academy of Fine Arts. By the time of my graduation, I realized that many still objects should possess their own vitality, and that digital media could emphasize this feeling for us.

- 2007年,我的毕业作品是一部动画作品“雕塑合唱团”。 In 2007, my graduation project was an animated film "Sculpture Choir". 

- 同年, 我作为虚拟角色艺术家在上海一家著名的游戏公司从事次时代虚拟角色设计。
- That same year, I worked as a 3D character artist at a well-known game company in Shanghai, where I was involved in designing virtual characters.

- 2009年, 美国迪士尼以及华纳兄弟等电影公司希望他们的DVD光盘可以与用户说话,  我帮他们设计了一些列的产品, 并在亚马逊发行.  In 2009, American film companies like Disney and Warner Bros. wanted their DVDs to be able to interact with users. I helped them design a series of products for them and finally they were released on Amazon.


- 我使用逆向工程的模型方式帮助他们解决了产品的生产问题。 因为当时传统制作方法仍然难以将复杂的机械结构精确地设置在雕塑造型上。 I also provide a reverse engineering approach to help solve manufacturing issues with complicated molded parts in SolidWorks and Pro/Engineer.



- 数字技术够解决许多现实中的问题。同时我也发现现有的数字技术的局限性可能削弱了艺术家的创作力。

When I was in Italy, my professor always guided me to focus on the humanities.

Digital technology can solve many real-world problems.

However, most of the time, I found that the limitations of existing digital technologies might undermine the creativity of artists.


- 以3维建模软件为例, 鼠标限制了艺术家创作的运动空间, 因为它只允许艺术家在二维的空间上操作对象, 从而限制了艺术家表达情感的自由, 

Take 3D modeling software as an example, the mouse only allows the artist to operate objects in a two-dimensional space restricts the creative movement space,  restricts to express emotions




- （ex）我们可以从抽象表现主义画家如 Jackson Pollock 身上发现，创作时人的动作会激发情感，创作时的发生的偶然事件会是创作的重要因素。
As We can see from abstract expressionist painters like Jackson Pollock that the movements of a person during creation can stimulate emotions, and the accidental events that occur during creation are an important factor in the creative process.


'[[自动主义(Automatism)]]' 的[[Embodied Cognition 具身认知|具身认知]]

- 2014年, 我开发了允许三维空间运动的数字雕刻手柄, 柄荣幸地受邀在意大利的达芬奇博物馆展出。
In 2014, I developed a digital sculpting handle that enables movement in 3D space. I was honored to have it exhibited at the Leonardo da Vinci Museum in Italy.

### Research Proposal

- Introduce background literature, goals and motivation
- Outline research questions
- Demonstrate familiarity with research area
- Explain proposed research methods in detail

```markdown


在从事艺术教育工作后，我关注数字教育环境以及数字教学资源. 
今天，我的 Research Proposal: 探索视频点云作为多维数字记忆的潜力
(Exploring the Potential of Video Point Clouds as Multi-Dimensional Digital Memories)
 


Background:

数字教育主要是通过 video 传播数字内容, 
学生通过二维屏幕接收平面化的教育资源, 可能局限了学生的记忆效率. 
我们知道, 无论我们在回忆还是在梦境都在一个三维空间中运作。
Digital learning mostly shares information through videos. 
Students get learning materials on flat screens, which might not help their memory much. 
You know, whether we are remembering stuff or dreaming, Our brains, work in a three-dimensional space.


---

Goal: 
提高三维教育平台实施的可能性

Task (技术):
尝试设计一个针对 3D 深度信息优化的编码器，以增强 3D深度信息 的视觉体验。

Task (评估):
提出一个评估模型或指标，用于在数字平台上测量[[Visual Memory|视觉记忆]]性能，以评估 3D深度信息 对学生视觉记忆的影响。

---

Qestions1:

~~也提升了媒体内容的沉浸感, 一项认知心理学研究表明，沉浸感对提高记忆效率至关重要。~~


Qusetion2.:
2. 评估三维平台提供的深度信息如何帮助学生的记忆。
由三维体验对记忆力影响所驱动的因素 
对三维影像对记忆的影响分析. 分析模型验证学生对教学内容的吸收效率.


Goal: 
提高三维教育平台实施的可能性
more: 
借助线上平台的行为数据, 也可以通过脑电波传感器

- 理解元素(对象)在立体维度中的的视觉线索对记忆编码和检索的影响
- 将视觉特征绑定到连贯的对象表征中及其在记忆中的作用
- 场景分割对后续记忆 post-event memory (后续记忆)的影响




The impact of scene segmentation on post-event memory
