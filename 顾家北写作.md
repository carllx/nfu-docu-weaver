这里是将雅思写作中构思观点时常见的问题归纳为三类:

1. 观点不充分
- 缺乏代表性, 针对的人群太小,不是主要的优点或缺点(例4)
- 一个例子写成观点,没有概括性(例3)
- 太空泛, 没有实际意义(例4)

2. 观点之间逻辑不清
- 两个观点重复,没有区分度(例2)
- ABC之间没有逻辑和因果关系(例5)

3. 观点不恰当
- 与常识不符(例6)
- 不同的观点混写在一块(例7)

- 解释why: 解释A和B之间的因果关系. 
- Background: 把A和B放在一个大的背景下理解, 思考这个观点是在什么大的背景/话题下提出的

第二轮(然后细化观点):
- 根据题目确定A、C或两者,不确定的部分进行具体化.检查 A -> B, B -> C之间是否有逻辑跳跃,如果有,第二轮细化补充中间的步骤
- 3 what does it mean.
- 4  how,  Any real example.

第三轮(最后拓展和支持观点):
- (选一)5结果why: 解释B为什么是问题或好处
- (选一)7特定化for whom/where:观点对哪些人或在什么条件下更适用
- (选一)8对比: 如果不是这样的话..
- 6和7也可以放在B之后

BackGround(开题)
- [backGround] Many parents today are so busy with their work that they can hardly play an important role in the upbringing of their children.


- [View] While some people argue that chidcare centres can perform well in looking after children, I believe that other members of family can also be involved.
	Nursery, kindergartens, preschools, organizations which provide childcare services.
	For many working families, nurseries, kindergartens and other organizations can help them look after children.


主体

- [B]Teachers who work for these organisations normally have academic qualifications and also receive specialised training.
- [B]Children will be well cared for. For example, teachers may choos e educational games which can promote children's brain development, and nourishing food which can benefit children's health.
- [拓展]In contrast, grandparents may not have relevant knowledge and sometimes the ways they feed or play with children may not be a ppropriate.

People who live in large cities can benefit from urban life to some extent, but I would argue that they are also prone to health problems.
A 城市人口集中，B 污染严重，C 对身体造成伤害
解释：车多，工厂很多
举例：汽车尾气、工业废气、生活污水
对比：而农村人少，污染少，对身体更好

People in urban areas may suffer poor health because cities are overcrowded.

many city dwellers travel by car and this means that car emissions have become a serious problem and caused air pollution. there are many factories and this is also an environmental problem, since industrial fumes are normally toxic. In addition, sewage is dischar ged into rivers to contaminate water. Because of this, residents ar e likely to contract respiratory diseases and water- borne diseases . In contrast, rural areas are less populated, and this is why people can enjoy good health there.
