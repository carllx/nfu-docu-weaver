Boden uses examples such as jazz improvisation, chess, story writing, physics, and the music of Mozart together with computing models from the field of artificial intelligence to uncover the nature of human creativity in the arts, science and everyday life. The second edition of The Creative Mind has been updated to include recent developments in artificial intelligence, with a new preface, introduction and conclusion by the author.

  abstract = {This paper describes a study to assess the influence of a variety of factors on reported level of presence in immersive virtual environments. It introduces the idea of “stacking depth,” that is, where a participant can simulate the process of entering the virtual environment while already in such an environment, which can be repeated to several levels of depth. An experimental study including 24 subjects was carried out. Half of the subjects were transported between environments by using virtual head-mounted displays, and the other half by going through doors. Three other binary factors were whether or not gravity operated, whether or not the subject experienced a virtual precipice, and whether or not the subject was followed around by a virtual actor. Visual, auditory, and kinesthetic representation systems and egocentric/exocentric perceptual positions were assessed by a preexperiment questionnaire. Presence was assessed by the subjects as their sense of “being there,” the extent to which they experienced the virtual environments as more the presenting reality than the real world in which the experiment was taking place, and the extent to which the subject experienced the virtual environments as places visited rather than images seen. A logistic regression analysis revealed that subjective reporting of presence was significantly positively associated with visual and kinesthetic representation systems, and negatively with the auditory system. This was not surprising since the virtual reality system used was primarily visual. The analysis also showed a significant and positive association with stacking level depth for those who were transported between environments by using the virtual HMD, and a negative association for those who were transported through doors. Finally, four of the subjects moved their real left arm to match movement of the left arm of the virtual body displayed by the system. These four scored significantly higher on the kinesthetic representation system than the remainder of the subjects.},

  abstract = {The effectiveness of virtual environments (VEs) has often been linked to the sense of presence reported by users of those VEs. (Presence is defined as the subjective experience of being in one place or environment, even when one is physically situated in another.) We believe that presence is a normal awareness phenomenon that requires directed attention and is based in the interaction between sensory stimulation, environmental factors that encourage involvement and enable immersion, and internal tendencies to become involved. Factors believed to underlie presence were described in the premier issue of Presence: Teleoperators and Virtual Environments. We used these factors and others as the basis for a presence questionnaire (PQ) to measure presence in VEs. In addition we developed an immersive tendencies questionnaire (ITQ) to measure differences in the tendencies of individuals to experience presence. These questionnaires are being used to evaluate relationships among reported presence and other research variables. Combined results from four experiments lead to the following conclusions:  the PQ and ITQ are internally consistent measures with high reliability; there is a weak but consistent positive relation between presence and task performance in VEs; individual tendencies as measured by the ITQ predict presence as measured by the PQ; and individuals who report more simulator sickness symptoms in VE report less presence than those who report fewer symptoms.},

The nature of agency within online, networked “systems” and “communities” is crucial to these developments. Electronic networks enable exchange and collectivist strategies that can question existing structures of power and governance. Networks are public spaces that offer enhanced possibilities of interventions into the social world and of archiving and filtering these interventions over time in an ongoing process. Networked activism and tactical response as well as artistic practice that merges physical and virtual space and augments physical sites and existing architectures are among the practices that are important to the impact of digital public art on governance.},

The compression is lossless and therefore is also suitable for storing the unfiltered, raw scan data. Our method is based on an octree decomposition of space. The point-cloud is encoded in terms of occupied octree-cells. To compress the octree we employ novel prediction techniques that were specifically designed for point sampled geometry and are based on local surface approximations to achieve high compression rates that outperform previous progressive coders for point-sampled geometry. Moreover we demonstrate that additional point attributes, such as color, which are of great importance for point-sampled geometry, can be well integrated and efficiently encoded in this framework.},

The result is an understanding of organizing and its conditions and consequences that is necessarily limited. I then argue for an alternative approach, one that posits the constitutive entanglement of the social and the material in everyday life. I draw on some empirical examples to help ground and illustrate this approach in practice and conclude by suggesting that a reconfiguration of our conventional assumptions and considerations of materiality will help us more effectively recognize and understand the multiple, emergent, and shifting sociomaterial assemblages entailed in contemporary organizing.},

This paper explores immersion further by investigating whether immersion can be defined quantitatively, describing three experiments in total. The first experiment investigated participants' abilities to switch from an immersive to a non-immersive task. The second experiment investigated whether there were changes in participants' eye movements during an immersive task. The third experiment investigated the effect of an externally imposed pace of interaction on immersion and affective measures (state anxiety, positive affect, negative affect). Overall the findings suggest that immersion can be measured subjectively (through questionnaires) as well as objectively (task completion time, eye movements). Furthermore, immersion is not only viewed as a positive experience: negative emotions and uneasiness (i.e. anxiety) also run high.},

Methods to assess the visual quality of digital videos as perceived by human observers are becoming increasingly important, due to the large number of applications that target humans as the end users of video. Owing to the many approaches to video quality assessment (VQA) that are being developed, there is a need for a diverse independent public database of distorted videos and subjective scores that is freely available. The resulting Laboratory for Image and Video Engineering (LIVE) Video Quality Database contains 150 distorted videos (obtained from ten uncompressed reference videos of natural scenes) that were created using four different commonly encountered distortion types. Each video was assessed by 38 human subjects, and the difference mean opinion scores (DMOS) were recorded. We also evaluated the performance of several state-of-the-art, publicly available full-reference VQA algorithms on the new database. A statistical evaluation of the relative performance of these algorithms is also presented. The database has a dedicated web presence that will be maintained as long as it remains relevant and the data is available online.},

  abstract = {3DTV technology has brought out new challenges such as the question of synthesized views evaluation. Synthesized views are generated through a depth image-based rendering (DIBR) process. This process induces new types of artifacts whose impact on visual quality has to be identified considering various contexts of use. While visual quality assessment has been the subject of many studies in the last 20 years, there are still some unanswered questions regarding new technological improvement. DIBR is bringing new challenges mainly because it deals with geometric distortions. This paper considers the DIBR-based synthesized view evaluation problem. Different experiments have been carried out. They question the protocols of subjective assessment and the reliability of the objective quality metrics in the context of 3DTV, in these specific conditions (DIBR-based synthesized views), and they consist in assessing seven different view synthesis algorithms through subjective and objective measurements. Results show that usual metrics are not sufficient for assessing 3-D synthesized views, since they do not correctly render human judgment. Synthesized views contain specific artifacts located around the disoccluded areas, but usual metrics seem to be unable to express the degree of annoyance perceived in the whole image. This study provides hints for a new objective measure. Two approaches are proposed: the first one is based on the analysis of the shifts of the contours of the synthesized view; the second one is based on the computation of a mean SSIM score of the disoccluded areas.},

  abstract = {Despite typically receiving little emphasis in visualization research, interaction in visualization is the catalyst for the user's dialogue with the data, and, ultimately, the user's actual understanding and insight into these data. There are many possible reasons for this skewed balance between the visual and interactive aspects of a visualization. One reason is that interaction is an intangible concept that is difficult to design, quantify, and evaluate. Unlike for visual design, there are few examples that show visualization practitioners and researchers how to design the interaction for a new visualization in the best manner. In this article, we attempt to address this issue by collecting examples of visualizations with ‘best-in-class’ interaction and using them to extract practical design guidelines for future designers and researchers. We call this concept fluid interaction, and we propose an operational definition in terms of the direct manipulation and embodied interaction paradigms, the psychological concept of ‘flow’, and Norman's gulfs of execution and evaluation.},

I support this claim with four ideas about cognition: (1) interacting with tools changes the way we think and perceive -- tools, when manipulated, are soon absorbed into the body schema, and this absorption leads to fundamental changes in the way we perceive and conceive of our environments; (2) we think with our bodies not just with our brains; (3) we know more by doing than by seeing -- there are times when physically performing an activity is better than watching someone else perform the activity, even though our motor resonance system fires strongly during other person observation; (4) there are times when we literally think with things. These four ideas have major implications for interaction design, especially the design of tangible, physical, context aware, and telepresence systems.},

  abstract = {Computational Creativity, Concept Invention, and General Intelligence in their own right all are flourishing research disciplines producing surprising and captivating results that continuously influence and change our view on where the limits of intelligent machines lie, each day pushing the boundaries a bit further. By 2014, all three fields also have left their marks on everyday life machine-composed music has been performed in concert halls, automated theorem provers are accepted tools in enterprises R\&D departments, and cognitive architectures are being integrated in pilot assistance systems for next generation airplanes. Still, although the corresponding aims and goals are clearly similar (as are the common methods and approaches), the developments in each of these areas have happened mostly individually within the respective community and without closer relationships to the goings-on in the other two disciplines. In order to overcome this gap and to provide a common platform for interaction and exchange between the different directions, the International Workshops on Computational Creativity, Concept Invention, and General Intelligence (C3GI) have been started. At ECAI-2012 and IJCAI-2013, the first and second edition of C3GI each gathered researchers from all three fields, presenting recent developments and results from their research and in dialogue and joint debates bridging the disciplinary boundaries. The chapters contained in this book are based on expanded versions of accepted contributions to the workshops and additional selected contributions by renowned researchers in the relevant fields. Individually, they give an account of the state-of-the-art in their respective area, discussing both, theoretical approaches as well as implemented systems. When taken together and looked at from an integrative perspective, the book in its totality offers a starting point for a (re)integration of Computational Creativity, Concept Invention, and General Intelligence, making visible common lines of work and theoretical underpinnings, and pointing at chances and opportunities arising from the interplay of the three fields.},

This comprehensive book concentrates on the work of art therapists: what they do, where they practice, and how and why art and therapy can combine to help the search for health and understanding of underlying problems. In this third edition, new developments in the profession are clearly described, including sections on neuroscience, research, private practice and the impact of technology on the therapeutic setting. Caroline Case and Tessa Dalley\&nbsp;are highly experienced in the teaching, supervision and clinical practice of art therapy. Using first-hand accounts of the experience of art therapy from therapists and patients, they cover such aspects as the influence of psychodynamic thinking, the role of the image in the art process and the setting in which the art therapist works. The Handbook of Art Therapy also focuses on art therapists themselves, and their practice, background and training. The book includes an extensive bibliography, encompassing a comprehensive coverage of the current literature on art therapy and related subjects, and contains a glossary of psychoanalytic terms. Covering basic theory and practice for clinicians and students at all levels of training, this is a key text for art therapists, counsellors, psychotherapists, psychologists and students at all levels, as well as professionals working in other arts therapies.},

We derive a multi-slice forward model for homogenous volumetric scattering, then develop a reconstruction algorithm that exploits sparsity in order to further constrain the problem. By using 4D measurements for 3D reconstruction, the dimensionality mismatch provides significant robustness to multiple scattering, with either static or dynamic diffusers. Experimentally, our high-resolution 4D phase-space data is collected by a spectrogram setup, with results successfully recovering the 3D positions of multiple LEDs embedded in turbid scattering media.},

  abstract = {Changing network conditions pose severe problems to video streaming in the Internet. HTTP adaptive streaming (HAS) is a technology employed by numerous video services that relieves these issues by adapting the video to the current network conditions. It enables service providers to improve resource utilization and Quality of Experience (QoE) by incorporating information from different layers in order to deliver and adapt a video in its best possible quality. Thereby, it allows taking into account end user device capabilities, available video quality levels, current network conditions, and current server load. For end users, the major benefits of HAS compared to classical HTTP video streaming are reduced interruptions of the video playback and higher bandwidth utilization, which both generally result in a higher QoE. Adaptation is possible by changing the frame rate, resolution, or quantization of the video, which can be done with various adaptation strategies and related client- and server-side actions. The technical development of HAS, existing open standardized solutions, but also proprietary solutions are reviewed in this paper as fundamental to derive the QoE influence factors that emerge as a result of adaptation. The main contribution is a comprehensive survey of QoE related works from human computer interaction and networking domains, which are structured according to the QoE impact of video adaptation. To be more precise, subjective studies that cover QoE aspects of adaptation dimensions and strategies are revisited. As a result, QoE influence factors of HAS and corresponding QoE models are identified, but also open issues and conflicting results are discussed. Furthermore, technical influence factors, which are often ignored in the context of HAS, affect perceptual QoE influence factors and are consequently analyzed. This survey gives the reader an overview of the current state of the art and recent developments. At the same time, it targets networking researchers who develop new solutions for HTTP video streaming or assess video streaming from a user centric point of view. Therefore, this paper is a major step toward truly improving HAS.},

Helen Armstrong's carefully curated introduction to groundbreaking primary texts, from the 1960s to the present, provides the background necessary for an understanding of digital design vocabulary and thought.Accessible essays from designers and programmers are by influential figures such as Ladislav Sutnar, Bruno Munari, Wim Crouwel, Sol LeWitt, Muriel Cooper, Zuzana Licko, Rudy VanderLans, John Maeda, Paola Antonelli, Luna Maurer, and Keetra Dean Dixon. Their topics range from graphic design's fascination with programmatic design, to early strivings for an authentic digital aesthetic, to the move from object-based design and to experience-based design.

This chapter will provide an overview of this history. It will trace the contemporary emergence of the robot back to the appearance of clockwork and mechanical automata in the early modern period. In so doing, the chapter will make two key contributions to this book’s study of robots and art. Firstly, it will argue that the concept of a robot predates the emergence of the word robot by several centuries, and that our understanding of the contemporary concept is enriched by recognition of this longer history. Secondly, it will show that, from its very inception, the history of robots has been closely entwined with that of art—evident not least in the fact the term itself derives from the context of theatre. This history continues to be reflexively present in contemporary performance.},

  abstract = {As machines take over more tasks previously done by humans, artistic creation is also considered as a candidate to be automated. But, can machines create art? This paper offers a conceptual framework for a philosophical discussion of this question regarding the status of machine art and machine creativity. It breaks the main question down in three sub-questions, and then analyses each question in order to arrive at more precise problems with regard to machine art and machine creativity: What is art creation? What do we mean by art? And, what do we mean by machines create art? This then provides criteria we can use to discuss the main question in relation to particular cases. In the course of the analysis, the paper engages with theory in aesthetics, refers to literature on computational creativity, and contributes to the philosophy of technology and philosophical anthropology by reflecting on the role of technology in art creation. It is shown that the distinctions between process versus outcome criteria and subjective versus objective criteria of creativity are unstable. It is also argued that we should consider non-human forms of creativity, and not only cases where either humans or machines create art but also collaborations between humans and machines, which makes us reflect on human-technology relations. Finally, the paper questions the very approach that seeks criteria and suggests that the artistic status of machines may be shown and revealed in the human/non-human encounter before any theorizing or agreement takes place; an experience which then is presupposed when we theorize. This hints at a more general model of what happens in artistic perception and engagement as a hybrid human-technological and emergent or even poetic process, a model which leaves more room for letting ourselves be surprised by creativity—human and perhaps non-human.},

With it, we in this paper devise a new no-reference/blind metric for image quality assessment (IQA) of contrast distortion. For local details, we first roughly remove predicted regions in an image since unpredicted remains are of much information. We then compute entropy of particular unpredicted areas of maximum information via visual saliency. From global perspective, we compare the image histogram with the uniformly distributed histogram of maximum information via the symmetric Kullback–Leibler divergence. The proposed blind IQA method generates an overall quality estimation of a contrast-distorted image by properly combining local and global considerations. Thorough experiments on five databases/subsets demonstrate the superiority of our training-free blind technique over state-of-the-art full- and no-reference IQA methods. Furthermore, the proposed model is also applied to amend the performance of general-purpose blind quality metrics to a sizable margin.},

  abstract = {The dominant sequence transduction models are based on complex recurrent or convolutional neural networks in an encoder-decoder configuration. The best performing models also connect the encoder and decoder through an attention mechanism. We propose a new simple network architecture, the Transformer, based solely on attention mechanisms, dispensing with recurrence and convolutions entirely. Experiments on two machine translation tasks show these models to be superior in quality while being more parallelizable and requiring significantly less time to train. Our model achieves 28.4 BLEU on the WMT 2014 English-to-German translation task, improving over the existing best results, including ensembles by over 2 BLEU. On the WMT 2014 English-to-French translation task, our model establishes a new single-model state-of-the-art BLEU score of 41.8 after training for 3.5 days on eight GPUs, a small fraction of the training costs of the best models from the literature. We show that the Transformer generalizes well to other tasks by applying it successfully to English constituency parsing both with large and limited training data.},

  abstract = {In controversies about technology and society, there is no idea more pro vocative than the notion that technical things have political qualities. At issue is the claim that the machines, structures, and systems of modern material culture can be accurately judged not only for their contributions of efficiency and pro ductivity, not merely for their positive and negative environmental side effects, but also for the ways in which they can embody specific forms of power and authority. Since ideas of this kind have a persistent and troubling presence in discussions about the meaning of technology, they deserve explicit attention.1 Writing in Technology and Culture almost two decades ago, Lewis Mumford gave classic statement to one version of the theme, arguing that "from late neo lithic times in the Near East, right down to our own day, two technologies have recurrently existed side by side: one authoritarian, the other democratic, the first system-centered, immensely powerful, but inherently unstable, the other man-centered, relatively weak, but resourceful and durable."2 This thesis stands at the heart of Mumford's studies of the city, architecture, and the his tory of technics, and mirrors concerns voiced earlier in the works of Peter Kropotkin, William Morris, and other nineteenth century critics of industrial ism. More recently, antinuclear and prosolar energy movements in Europe and America have adopted a similar notion as a centerpiece in their arguments. Thus environmentalist Denis Hayes concludes, "The increased deployment of nuclear power facilities must lead society toward authoritarianism. Indeed, safe reliance upon nuclear power as the principal source of energy may be possible only in a totalitarian state." Echoing the views of many proponents of appropri ate technology and the soft energy path, Hayes contends that "dispersed solar sources are more compatible than centralized technologies with social equity, freedom and cultural pluralism."3 An eagerness to interpret technical artifacts in political language is by no means the exclusive property of critics of large-scale high-technology systems. A long lineage of boosters have insisted that the "biggest and best" that science and industry made available were the best guarantees of democracy, freedom, and social justice. The factory system, automobile, telephone, radio, television, the space program, and of course nuclear power itself have all at one time or another been described as democratizing, liberating forces. David Lilienthal, in T.V.A.: Democracy on the March, for example, found this promise in the phos 121},

  abstract = {Social robotics entertains a particular relationship with anthropomorphism, which it neither sees as a cognitive error, nor as a sign of immaturity. Rather it considers that this common human tendency, which is hypothesized to have evolved because it favoured cooperation among early humans, can be used today to facilitate social interactions between humans and a new type of cooperative and interactive agents – social robots. This approach leads social robotics to focus research on the engineering of robots that activate anthropomorphic projections in users. The objective is to give robots “social presence” and “social behaviors” that are sufficiently credible for human users to engage in comfortable and potentially long-lasting relations with these machines. This choice of ‘applied anthropomorphism’ as a research methodology exposes the artefacts produced by social robotics to ethical condemnation: social robots are judged to be a “cheating” technology, as they generate in users the illusion of reciprocal social and affective relations. This article takes position in this debate, not only developing a series of arguments relevant to philosophy of mind, cognitive sciences, and robotic AI, but also asking what social robotics can teach us about anthropomorphism. On this basis, we propose a theoretical perspective that characterizes anthropomorphism as a basic mechanism of interaction, and rebuts the ethical reflections that a priori condemns “anthropomorphism-based” social robots. To address the relevant ethical issues, we promote a critical experimentally-based ethical approach to social robotics, “synthetic ethics”, which aims at allowing humans to use social robots for two main goals: self-knowledge and moral growth.},

In this article, we address whether and how contemporary social classes are marked by distinct lifestyles. We assess the model of the social space, a novel approach to class analysis pioneered by Bourdieu's Distinction. Although pivotal in Bourdieu's work, this model is too often overlooked in later research, making its contemporary relevance difficult to assess. We redress this by using the social space as a framework through which to study the cultural manifestation of class divisions in lifestyle differences in contemporary Norwegian society. Through a Multiple Correspondence Analysis (MCA) of unusually rich survey data, we reveal a structure strikingly similar to the model in Distinction, with a primary dimension of the volume of capital, and a secondary dimension of the composition of capital. While avoiding the substantialist fallacy of predefined notions of 'highbrow' and 'lowbrow' tastes, we explore how 168 lifestyle items map onto this social space. This reveals distinct classed lifestyles according to both dimensions of the social space. The lifestyles of the upper classes are distinctly demanding in terms of resources. Among those rich in economic capital, this manifests itself in a lifestyle which involves a quest for excitement, and which is bodily oriented and expensive. For their counterparts rich in cultural capital, a more ascetic and intellectually oriented lifestyle manifests itself, demanding of resources in the sense of requiring symbolic mastery, combining a taste for canonized, legitimate culture with more cosmopolitan and 'popular' items. In contrast to many studies' descriptions of the lower classes as 'disengaged' and 'inactive', we find evidence of distinct tastes on their part. Our analysis thus affirms the validity of Bourdieu's model of social class and the contention that classes tend to take the form of status groups. We challenge dominant positions in cultural stratification research, while questioning the aptness of the metaphor of the 'omnivore', as well as recent analyses of 'emerging cultural capital'.},

In this paper, we propose a novel 3D generative modeling framework to efficiently generate object shapes in the form of dense point clouds. We use 2D convolutional operations to predict the 3D structure from multiple viewpoints and jointly apply geometric reasoning with 2D projection optimization. We introduce the pseudo-renderer, a differentiable module to approximate the true rendering operation, to synthesize novel depth maps for optimization. Experimental results for single-image 3D object reconstruction tasks show that we outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of shape similarity and prediction density.},

We introduce multi-source shape-from-silhouette (MS-SfS) combined with fusion of different geometry data as crucial components for accurate reconstruction in sparse camera settings.

  abstract = {Volumetric media, popularly known as holograms, need to be delivered to users using both on-demand and live streaming, for new augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR) experiences. As in video streaming, hologram streaming must support network adaptivity and fast startup, but must also moderate large bandwidths, multiple simultaneously streaming objects, and frequent user interaction, which requires low delay. In this paper, we introduce the first system designed specifically for streaming volumetric media. The system reduces bandwidth by introducing 3D tiles, and culling them or reducing their level of detail depending on their relation to the user's view frustum and distance to the user. To allocate bits among different tiles across multiple objects, we introduce a simple greedy yet provably optimal algorithm for rate-utility optimization, whose utility measures is based not only on the underlying quality of the representation, but on the level of detail relative to the user's viewpoint and device resolution. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm provides superior quality compared to existing video-streaming approaches adapted to hologram streaming, in terms of utility and user experience over variable, throughput-constrained networks.},

  abstract = {Point clouds are a new modality for representation of plenoptic content and a popular alternative to create immersive media. Despite recent progress in capture, display, storage, delivery and processing, the problem of a reliable approach to subjectively and objectively assess the quality of point clouds is still largely open. In this study, we extend the state of the art in projection-based objective quality assessment of point cloud imaging by investigating the impact of the number of viewpoints employed to assess the visual quality of a content, while discarding information that does not belong to the object under assessment, such as background color. Additionally, we propose assigning weights to the projected views based on interactivity information, obtained during subjective evaluation experiments. In the experiment that was conducted, human observers assessed a carefully selected collection of typical contents, subject to geometry and color degradations due to compression. The point cloud models were rendered using cubes as primitive elements with adaptive sizes based on local neighborhoods. Our results show that employing a larger number of projected views does not necessarily lead to better predictions of visual quality, while user interactivity information can improve the performance.},

It argues that the art–theoretical tropes raised by current speculations on artworks created by autonomous technical systems have been inherent to debates on modern and postmodern art throughout the 20th century. Moreover, the author suggests that the notion of the machine derives from a mythological narrative in which humans and technical systems are rigidly figured as both proximate and antagonistic. The essay develops a critical perspective onto this ideological formation and elucidates its critique in a discussion of a recent series of artworks and a text by US American artist Trevor Paglen.},

Do machine artworks demonstrate creativity, or are they a type of new media from which artists extend their creativity with? Will solely machine-created artworks be acceptable by our artworlds? This article probes these questions by first identifying the frameworks for defining and explaining art and evaluating its suitability for explaining machine artworks. It then explores how artworks have a necessary relationship with their human artists and the wider context of history, institutions, styles, and approaches and with audiences and artworlds. The article then questions whether machines have such a relational context and whether machines will ever live up to our standard of what constitutes an artwork as defined by us or whether machines are good only for assisting creativity. The question of intellectual property, rights, and ownership are also discussed for human--machine artworks and purely machine-produced works of art. The article critically assesses the viability of machines as artists as the central question in the historical discourse, extended through art and the artworld and evaluates machine-produced work from such a basis.},

  abstract = {Even though architectural modelling radically evolved over the course of its history, the current integration of Augmented Reality (AR) and Virtual Reality(VR) components in the corresponding design tasks is mostly limited to enhancing visualisation. Little to none of these tools attempt to tackle the challenge of modelling within immersive environments, that calls for new input modalities in order to move away from the traditional mouse and keyboard combination. In fact, relying on 2D devices for 3D manipulations does not seem to be effective as it does not offer the same degrees of freedom. We therefore present a solution that brings VR modelling capabilities to Grasshopper, a popular parametric design tool. Together with its associated proof-of-concept application, our extension offers a glimpse at new perspectives in that field. By taking advantage of them,one can edit geometries with real-time feedback on the generated models, without ever leaving the virtual environment. The distinctive characteristics of VR applications provide a range of benefits without obstructing design activities. The designer can indeed experience the architectural models at full scale from a realistic point-of-view and truly feels immersed right next to them.},

  abstract = {Volumetric media, popularly known as holograms, need to be delivered to users using both on-demand and live streaming, for new augmented reality and virtual reality experiences. As in video streaming, hologram streaming must support network adaptivity and fast startup, but must also handle large bandwidths, multiple simultaneously streaming objects, and frequent user interaction, which requires a low delay. In this paper, we introduce the first system to our knowledge designed specifically for streaming volumetric media. The system reduces bandwidth by introducing 3D tiles and culling them or reducing their level of detail depending on their relation to the user’s view frustum and distance to the user. Our system reduces latency by introducing a window-based buffer, which in contrast to a queue-based buffer allows insertions near the head of the buffer rather than only at the tail of the buffer, to respond quickly to user interaction. To allocate bits between different tiles across multiple objects, we introduce a simple greedy yet provably optimal algorithm for rate-utility optimization. We introduce utility measures based not only on the underlying quality of the representation, but on the level of detail relative to the user’s viewpoint and device resolution. The simulation results show that the proposed algorithm provides a superior quality compared with the existing video-streaming approaches adapted to hologram streaming, in terms of utility and user experience over variable, throughput-constrained networks.},

This article argues that trajectory may be complicated by the emergence of a new type of mobile technology: mobile virtual reality (MVR). While an increasing number of handsets are specifically developed with MVR in mind, there is little to no research that situates this phenomenon within the continuum of MCS. The intention of this paper is accordingly twofold. First, the article conceptualizes MVR as a connective tissue between the two sequential tropes of MCS: physical distraction and spatial enhancement. Second, the article introduces the concept of ‘dislocated space’ as a way of understanding the embodied space MVR might configure.},

Especially in the context of the extremely rapid development of the Virtual Reality (VR) and Augmented Reality (AR) markets, volumetric video is becoming a key technology. In this paper, a new capture and processing system for volumetric video is presented, called 3D Human Body Reconstruction (3DHBR). The system is based on 16 stereo pairs of high-resolution cameras capturing a moving person in 360 degree. A novel stereo approach provides depth information from all perspectives, which is then fused to a single consistent 3D point cloud. A meshing and mesh reduction algorithm finally produces a sequence of meshes that can be integrated into common render engines. Given that, an integration of realistic dynamic 3D reconstructions of moving persons in VR and AR applications is possible.},

  abstract = {Point clouds provide a flexible geometric representation suitable for countless applications in computer graphics; they also comprise the raw output of most 3D data acquisition devices. While hand-designed features on point clouds have long been proposed in graphics and vision, however, the recent overwhelming success of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for image analysis suggests the value of adapting insight from CNN to the point cloud world. Point clouds inherently lack topological information, so designing a model to recover topology can enrich the representation power of point clouds. To this end, we propose a new neural network module dubbed EdgeConv suitable for CNN-based high-level tasks on point clouds, including classification and segmentation. EdgeConv acts on graphs dynamically computed in each layer of the network. It is differentiable and can be plugged into existing architectures. Compared to existing modules operating in extrinsic space or treating each point independently, EdgeConv has several appealing properties: It incorporates local neighborhood information; it can be stacked applied to learn global shape properties; and in multi-layer systems affinity in feature space captures semantic characteristics over potentially long distances in the original embedding. We show the performance of our model on standard benchmarks, including ModelNet40, ShapeNetPart, and S3DIS.},

The main drawback of this representation is the size of the data since typical point clouds may contain millions of points, usually associated with both geometry and color information. Consequently, a significant amount of work has been devoted to the efficient compression of this representation. Lossy compression leads to a degradation of the data and thus impacts the visual quality of the displayed content. In that context, predicting perceived visual quality computationally is essential for the optimization and evaluation of compression algorithms. In this paper, we introduce PCQM, a full-reference objective metric for visual quality assessment of 3D point clouds. The metric is an optimally-weighted linear combination of geometry-based and color-based features. We evaluate its performance on an open subjective dataset of colored point clouds compressed by several algorithms; the proposed quality assessment approach outperforms all previous metrics in terms of correlation with mean opinion scores.},

  abstract = {Analysis of social media using digital methods is a flourishing approach. However, the relatively easy availability of data collected via platform application programming interfaces has arguably led to the predominance of single-platform research of social media. Such research has also privileged the role of text in social media analysis, as a form of data that is more readily gathered and searchable than images. In this paper, we challenge both of these prevailing forms of social media research by outlining a methodology for visual cross-platform analysis (VCPA), defined as the study of still and moving images across two or more social media platforms. Our argument contains three steps. First, we argue that cross-platform analysis addresses a gap in research methods in that it acknowledges the interplay between a social phenomenon under investigation and the medium within which it is being researched, thus illuminating the different affordances and cultures of web platforms. Second, we build on the literature on multimodal communication and platform vernacular to provide a rationale for incorporating the visual into cross-platform analysis. Third, we reflect on an experimental cross-platform analysis of images within social media posts (n = 471,033) used to communicate climate change to advance different modes of macro- and meso-levels of analysis that are natively visual: image-text networks, image plots and composite images. We conclude by assessing the research pathways opened up by VCPA, delineating potential contributions to empirical research and theory and the potential impact on practitioners of social media communication.},

  abstract = {Compression of RGB images is today a relatively mature field with many impressive codecs available to choose from that can achieve high compression ratios for lossless and lossy compression. However, for 3D depth images, the field is not as developed, although the goal remains the same – to compress both stilland movingimages in order to reduce system bandwidth and storage space requirements. In this white paper, we introduce a method by which depth from Intel RealSense depth cameras can be compressed using standard codecs, with the potential for 80x compression. Our approach is based on colorizing the depth image in a way that best reduces depth compression artefacts. We will define some key performance metrics, compare results obtained with different compression codecs, and introduce a post-processing technique that helps mitigate some of the worst depth artefacts.},

  abstract = {Volumetric video (VV) pipelines reached a high level of maturity, creating interest to use such content in interactive visualisation scenarios. VV allows real world content to be captured and represented as 3D models, which can be viewed from any chosen viewpoint and direction. Thus, VV is ideal to be used in augmented reality (AR) or virtual reality (VR) applications. Both textured polygonal meshes and point clouds are popular methods to represent VV. Even though the signal and image processing community slightly favours the point cloud due to its simpler data structure and faster acquisition, textured polygonal meshes might have other benefits such as better visual quality and easier integration with computer graphics pipelines. To better understand the difference between them, in this study, we compare these two different representation formats for a VV compression scenario utilising state-of-the-art compression techniques. For this purpose, we build a database and collect user opinion scores for subjective quality assessment of the compressed VV. The results show that meshes provide the best quality at high bitrates, while point clouds perform better for low bitrate cases. The created VV quality database will be made available online to support further scientific studies on VV quality assessment.},

  abstract = {Interpenetration of ideas, culture, economics, raw materials and etc. are causing globalization in our society. This trend is also assisted by the growing technological innovations. Society is increasingly turning to digital tools to provide fast communications, access to information and goods through the global network, especially needed during the pandemic. In terms of art, these factors contribute to shifting the range from classical means of expression to contemporary art forms focused on digital media. Historically, the discovery of photography in the 19th century radically changed art. Painting frees itself from the function of reflecting objective reality and seeks new means of expression and meaning. In the early 20th century, new trends in the avant-garde art seek to depict intangible things away from visible reality such as the inner world of the artist, emotions, symbols, music, time and more. One of the brightest trends - Cubism is a typical example. It seeks a way to show objects rationally from several sides simultaneously - three-dimensional, but unfortunately it is limited by the means of expression - the two-dimensional surface of the canvas. Digital technologies today have a solution to this problem. They provide digital tools that completely change painting. The canvas no longer exists in the familiar way in which the artist works. It is becoming history. With the invention of VR glasses, the boundaries of visible reality and imagination in art have been removed to enter a new virtual world. Tilt Brush technology goes one step further, giving the opportunity to the artist to create 3D images with a brush in hand while moving in the virtual world he creates. Canvas doesn’t exist, it is a virtual digital world three-dimensional arising from the imagination of the artist and existing only through the eyes of the pink VR glasses. Here comes the question, will technology displace the artist's hand?

In this context, the so-called lenslet light field (LLF) cameras are able to go beyond the conventional 2D visual acquisition models, by enriching the visual representation with directional light measures for each pixel position. LLF imaging is associated to large amounts of data, thus critically demanding efficient coding solutions in order applications involving transmission and storage may be deployed. For this reason, considerable research efforts have been invested in recent years in developing increasingly efficient LLF imaging coding (LLFIC) solutions. In this context, the main objective of this paper is to review and evaluate some of the most relevant LLFIC solutions in the literature, guided by a novel classification taxonomy, which allows better organizing this field. In this way, more solid conclusions can be drawn about the current LLFIC status quo, thus allowing to better drive future research and standardization developments in this technical area.},

It is the first telepresence system that is demonstrably better than 2D videoconferencing, as measured using participant ratings (e.g., presence, attentiveness, reaction-gauging, engagement), meeting recall, and observed nonverbal behaviors (e.g., head nods, eyebrow movements). This milestone is reached by maximizing audiovisual fidelity and the sense of copresence in all design elements, including physical layout, lighting, face tracking, multi-view capture, microphone array, multi-stream compression, loudspeaker output, and lenticular display. Our system achieves key 3D audiovisual cues (stereopsis, motion parallax, and spatialized audio) and enables the full range of communication cues (eye contact, hand gestures, and body language), yet does not require special glasses or body-worn micro- phones/headphones. The system consists of a head-tracked autostereoscopic display, high-resolution 3D capture and rendering subsystems, and network transmission using compressed color and depth video streams. Other contributions include a novel image-based geometry fusion algorithm, free-space dereverberation, and talker localization.},

The topics first cover the building elements for the metaverse, e.g., virtual scenes and characters, auditory, textual elements. Next, several remarkable types of novel creations in the expanded horizons of metaverse cyberspace have been reflected, such as immersive arts, robotic arts, and other user-centric approaches fuelling contemporary creative outputs. Finally, we propose several research agendas: democratising computational arts, digital privacy, and safety for metaverse artists, ownership recognition for digital artworks, technological challenges, and so on. The survey also serves as introductory material for artists and metaverse technologists to begin creations in the realm of surrealistic cyberspace.},

To a limited extent, government buildings which are open to the public, such as public libraries are public spaces, although they tend to have restricted areas and greater limits upon use. Although not considered public space, privately owned buildings or property visible from sidewalks and public thoroughfares may affect the public visual landscape, for example, by outdoor advertising. Recently, the concept of Shared space has been advanced to enhance the experience of pedestrians in public space jointly used by automobiles and other vehicles. Public space has also become something of a touchstone for critical theory in relation to philosophy, (urban) geography, visual art, cultural studies, social studies and urban design. The term 'public space' is also often misconstrued to mean other things such as 'gathering place', which is an element of the larger concept of social space. Public spaces have often been valorized as democratic spaces of congregation and political participation, where groups can vocalize their rights.One of the earliest examples of public spaces are commons. Malls, regardless of private ownership percentage, are examples of 'public space' since no fees or paid tickets are required for entry.},

Although most point cloud processing systems are developed to improve viewer experiences, little work has been dedicated to perceptual quality assessment of 3D point clouds. In this work, we build a new 3D point cloud database, namely the Waterloo Point Cloud (WPC) database. In contrast to existing datasets consisting of small-scale and low-quality source content of constrained viewing angles, the WPC database contains 20 high quality, realistic, and omni-directional source point clouds and 740 diversely distorted point clouds. We carry out a subjective quality assessment experiment over the database in a controlled lab environment. Our statistical analysis suggests that existing objective point cloud quality assessment (PCQA) models only achieve limited success in predicting subjective quality ratings. We propose a novel objective PCQA model based on an attention mechanism and a variant of information content-weighted structural similarity, which significantly outperforms existing PCQA models. The database has been made publicly available at https://github.com/qdushl/Waterloo-Point-Cloud-Database.},

Using inertial measurement units mounted on foot is a feasible approach to improve the positioning accuracy for the human motion capture system. This paper presents a lightweight and low cost wireless inertial motion capture system for the simultaneous reconstruction of human body attitude and displacement. First of all, the device is based on human sensor networks and distributes 15 sensor nodes on the key human limbs. Then, after an initial sensor alignment with the reduced error, a zero‐speed update algorithm is used to calculate foot displacement. In addition, to constantly update the human posture information, a kind of motion reconstruction method based on the gradient descent method was used to fuse the sensor data. Finally, a new method of three‐dimensional human body reconstruction is proposed, which is different from the traditional motion capture system. Through unconstrained traversal of the root, the human posture and foot trajectory are combined to realize the synchronous reconstruction of posture and displacement. It is concluded from the experiment results that the estimation errors are well controlled, and motion patterns are consistent with the actual situation.},

  abstract = {Point clouds are essential for storage and transmission of 3D content. As they can entail significant volumes of data, point cloud compression is crucial for practical usage. Recently, point cloud geometry compression approaches based on deep neural networks have been explored. In this paper, we evaluate the ability to predict perceptual quality of typical voxel-based loss functions employed to train these networks. We find that the commonly used focal loss and weighted binary cross entropy are poorly correlated with human perception. We thus propose a perceptual loss function for 3D point clouds which outperforms existing loss functions on the ICIP2020 subjective dataset. In addition, we propose a novel truncated distance field voxel grid representation and find that it leads to sparser latent spaces and loss functions that are more correlated with perceived visual quality compared to a binary representation.

  abstract = {In this paper, we examine the emergent concept of chronotope and its deployment for the examination of space-time relations in research on learning and education. Chronotopes have been defined in terms of socially emergent configurations of space-time, where space and time are considered as interdependent social constructions. Chronotope is seen as a conceptual and analytical tool that allows reaching a sociocultural and dialogical understanding of human action and interaction in space-time. We argue that the existing chronotopic research has not been sufficiently explicit concerning how units of analysis are selected and conceptualized. To facilitate a wider adoption of this concept, we introduce and discuss four dimensions of chronotopic units of analysis (foregrounding processes, dialogicality, material-discursive features of space-time, and interdependency of space-time). We illustrate these dimensions by discussing how they were implicitly or explicitly included in the conceptualization of the unit of analysis in exemplary studies. In particular, we show how including one or more of these dimensions enabled to make “visible” educationally relevant phenomena and to discuss significant aspects of pedagogical practice. In all, our article contributes to make explicit and discuss the methodological foundations for using chronotope to research the space-time relations of learning.},

  abstract = {Augmented reality (AR) is getting popular, and among other content creation techniques, volumetric video allows to bring dynamic real world content as captured by cameras into such applications. To develop efficient algorithms for compression and transmission of the volumetric media, it is important to understand how users will consume this new form of dynamic 3D content. In this paper, we analyse the user behaviour for the volumetric video consumption in AR. In particular, we study the distribution of users’ viewpoints, relative locations, and average distances from the content. For this purpose, we built an Android AR application using the volumetric video and conducted a user study remotely. The results show that users spent most of their time looking at the frontal part of the volumetric video, and this indicates the importance of the face in visual attention. The collected user behaviour data are made public to support further research.},
