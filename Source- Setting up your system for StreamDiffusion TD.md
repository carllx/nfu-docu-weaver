Transcript:
(00:01) hey there everyone uh it's been a while since I had uh another video but um there's a new Tool uh called stream defusion TD that uh came out um this this spring uh by uh this really great developer uh simulate uh and some of my students were just looking at this Tool uh it's for doing uh real time um diffusion um AI generative images in touch designer uh with a really great frame rate um so the tool has a really great getting started um by simulate on YouTube um but some of my students uh were having some trouble uh
(00:47) with if you if you're not coming from a computer science background some of the before installing um might be a little bit confusing if you're not super familiar with python or or working with um this sort of a system system so I wanted to create a video and uh kind of go through those steps together um you can just see at a glance here first like the the system itself this is just really beautiful really good parameters um real time you can change the prompts here and we get a really nice I'm getting I'm almost yeah 910 10 frames
(01:30) per second I'm running on a a 3080 um so that is pretty exciting so let's let's look through these steps here how you can actually get this set up properly and determine if uh if your computer can actually run this so I've got um if you look down in the description I got links to all these things I'm going to go through uh but I'm going to maybe just give a few tips um so for the first one here if if you're like really like maybe not not sure how to dive into this or you're not even sure what kind of GPU you have
(02:01) maybe um so you can check out this link here uh it kind of goes through of how you can determine exactly which GPU you have uh so this uh only runs on a Windows PC it must have an Nvidia GPU and that Nvidia card must be uh Cuda compatible U and so Cuda is basically a bridge between uh the code that you might write or or that gets run uh and make that run on the GPU whereas most of the time when we're coding that code gets uh executed by the CPU so this is a way to utilize the processing power of gpus to run uh some sort of applications
(02:44) so you go to this Cuda page like okay you found out which model GPU you have go to Cuda page like is that GPU uh compatible right most likely you would have uh either a GeForce here Nvidia RTX like one of these so click this little list and uh and make sure that your card is on this list uh so it's got a pretty wide uh capability um the difference just basically is it might run but your frame rate might be very very slow if you have maybe an older card um so check that list make sure it's on the list uh you need Python and not only just python you
(03:28) need version 3.10 uh and so on on um simulates page here it says python uh in other places say 3.10.9 actually I recall there's specifically it said that uh here it just says 3.10 uh I'm running 310.10 I believe um so the important thing to know is you cannot just download the latest version uh if you're not familiar with how python Works um it's it's different from Maybe otherc appli where um you can count usually on backwards compatibility not so with python if there's an application written in 3.10 and you're running
(04:11) 3.12 things things are going to break there's just a lot of dependencies a lot of differences um and so we don't want this 3123 here we go to specific release uh and by looking at this list here you can kind of see how the the releases don't really go in order right so let's say in February there's 118 but then uh later in March there's another 3.
(04:35) 8 that came out right so it's not really going in a chronological order uh so that kind of shows you how each of these versions uh has something different happening with it right uh so I'll just go down here and like I said I'm running 31010 uh other way uh places the dot simulates it's listed as 3109 so download that um an important thing also for all of these maybe let's go through python we Cuda and all this stuff uh when you download it um it's also important to if you see a little box that says add to path or add to system path make sure
(05:16) that's checked um I'll explain what that means exactly in a little bit it involves something called environment variables on Windows but if you see that make sure that's checked um and that that would go for python Cuda and also a this git client that we're going to download in a second here okay next step Cuda must be we see this here 11.
(05:40) 8 or 12.1 so same thing so this most recent Cuda toolkit is 12.4 do not download 12.4 right so make sure you download the the version that um is specifically asked for uh so let's go to Archive and here we see all of the archived toolkits uh I downloaded 11 .8 uh so I know that works uh you can try 12.
(06:08) 1 if you if you wish um so download that again if you see something that says add to system path check that when you're installing uh next one Visual Studio 2022 the free community download uh so this basically you know this is an IDE for for writing code uh it also gives uh kind of build tools so basically what's happening with simulates um tool that was created it's it needs uh some behind the scenes it's going to be building uh something on your system and visual stool gives those tools in order to to to build um the necessary libraries and all that stuff
(06:48) so you need to download it um and also it specifies um you need to have a desktop environment for C++ I believe uh so in in the install if it asks you that um you're downloading for desktop C++ next up ndi SDK um so ndi if you're not familiar with it it's a really wonderful networked video uh protocol for sharing video um between applications between devices across the network um so what's happening with this Tool uh it is essentially using p python to uh access the generative AI model and it's getting images from that but then
(07:37) it needs to send those images which are in uh the python land and send it over to uh this touch designer uh top representation right so to do that we're using something called ndii python um so we need the ndii SDK um tools here so you have to put in register your name and all that and you'll receive a link to your email where you can download it next up uh something called git so um these tools live on the all the dependencies the libraries that we're using lives on a repository uh online somewhere a GitHub repo so git is a
(08:19) client uh that's an application on your desktop computer uh which enables you know from a command prompt on on your computer you can um you know type A Certain command like git so and so and you automatically grab things from some online repository uh so we need to do this like as part of the process when you're installing the stream diffusion TD stuff it uses this to automatically grab the things online that it needs and download it with with without you having to uh worry about it uh so we get that again if it asks you to add to system
(08:55) path make that is checked during the install um um if maybe let's let's go through this if you have these installed and maybe you're not sure if they are in your system path or you need to add it manually you're like oh shoot I forgot to do that during the install um here's here's how we do it so we uh we need to find and we can uh we can kind of look look at these here okay there we we go um so do simulate offers this if git is already installed and not in path this is a a link here um this is another link that I
(09:39) found for adding python to path this is basically the same process um you can use any of these I find if if you're not really confident with all the stuff probably you'd want to manually add um using this method so we go through manually add git so let's let's just go through all this so this is kind of talking about doing a little search I'm going to search for maybe edit the system environment variables let's check that okay so system properties will pop up and down here I see environment variables and I don't want user
(10:17) variables for me I want system variables so I go down here let's see I hit there we go path uh and then I hit edit so I've already done this but you can see python is there um I added git before Cuda is in there somewhere uh so why why do we need to do this it's kind of like uh what this does if I can I open up another command prompt there we go cool um as a developer we can run we can do python commands directly from the command prompt like this so if I did I don't know let's do version boom okay so this python um is
(11:09) accessing the python.exe executable file that lives somewhere in my system and it runs this um you know this this thing called version it just pops back what version of python that I have uh if python was not in my path environment to variables this would not work um so what path does is from anywhere on your system it allows you to use these applications that are listed in path to do some sort of a a command um so as a a part of what the stream diffusion is doing uh it's using G it's using Cuda it's using python so all those things
(11:47) have to be in your path environment variable here in order to basically get permission uh to be to be run from any location uh so that's just in a nutshell like why we're doing that cool uh so if you need to uh if you need to add python to path you can check this also it's similar uh similar process of just uh pasting in the exe file in that environment variable um also touch designer so this only works in 2023 versions uh so check check your version uh if you look here in the official downloads looks like uh 2023 versions
(12:25) first came around December 5th of last year uh so definitely I mean try to try to get up to the the most recent version there um I also had a problem when I had installed all the stuff um I was getting a Vulcan error in touch designer when I first um opened it and I realize like my Nvidia driver was a little bit old so also update your Nvidia driver so you can go here uh put in your details and download the driver also some people might have do I have this open here uh some of these have like a GeForce experience uh application so this will
(13:11) typically if you hit drivers uh this will show you you can check for updates this this is a little bit easier um way to do that than trying to find it online so update your driver and once you do all that I think it should work um and then basically what you do is you know go through at that point you can look through uh simulates tutorial uh he goes through kind of installing and and running it for the first time to install the stream diffusion things um creating a virtual environment U for your system and you should be good to go
(13:55) from there this is really exciting uh and also shout out to um this was based on work by these researchers uh we could see names here um this was a paper that came out if you look at archive here this came out December of last year um basically giving the um you know if if you're into computer science if if you're literate in that at all you can look through all of this uh so the the beauty of what has done for us is you know taking all this which is open for anyone but then it's it's a pretty high um learning curve if
(14:37) you're not really fluent in in Python land um so he's taken this and and made this really great talks um also I should emphasize so this this isn't just a free download uh you need to um follow. simulate on the the cheapest patreon level is $5 a month U so follow that and you can um get these tools um if you go for the $10 month uh there's also some other exciting I haven't had chance to look at these yet but looks like some really cool um AI plus touch designer tools that he's created so absolutely support um this Creator I think it looks really
(15:21) exciting so thank you let's try it out
