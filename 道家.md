### Tao is God?
平衡、和谐以及理解世界的 "无形 "方面的概念是道家哲学(Taoist philosophy)的核心，并在西方体现在从伦理学到[[Metaphysics]] 的广泛的哲学主题。"
对 [[Nature|万物的本质]] 的洞察

道德经 提出了一种 Metaphysics 的观点，即世界是由一种叫做 Tao"道 "的自然和神秘的原则所支配的，它是万物之源(source of all things)，是和谐与平衡之道。大音希声，大象无形 "这句话表明，Tao 是 **non-physical 非物理的**，是**non-conceptual 非概念的**，它不能被任何表象(representation)或描述所捕获。这可能对**物理主义physicalist**和**[[Naturalism]]自然主义**对Reality的描述构成挑战，这些描述假定一切存在的事物都可以用物理规律和自然现象来解释。

(参见David Chalmers (Metaphysics) 的论文 Facing Up to the Problem of Consciousness《直面意识问题》，了解更多关于解释物理过程如何产生主观经验的难题）。

形而上学的理论中, 学者们相信世界由一种Source of all things 或神秘原则所支配吗?
There is no definitive answer to whether scholars believe that the world is governed by a source of all things or a mystical principle, as different metaphysical theories have different assumptions and implications about the nature and origin of reality. However, some possible perspectives are:

- **Aristotelian metaphysics**: Aristotle, the ancient Greek philosopher, proposed that the world is composed of substances that have essence and form, and that there is a **prime mover** or **unmoved mover** that is the source and cause of all motion and change in the world, and that is also the highest good and the object of desire for all things⁴. Aristotle's prime mover is not a personal or interventionist God, but a metaphysical principle that is pure actuality, immaterial, eternal, and perfect.
- **Platonic metaphysics**: Plato, another ancient Greek philosopher and the teacher of Aristotle, proposed that the world is divided into two realms: the **intelligible realm** of the **forms** or **ideas**, which are the eternal and unchanging archetypes of all things, and the **sensible realm** of the **particulars**, which are the imperfect and changing copies of the forms. Plato's forms are not physical or material entities, but abstract and universal concepts that can only be grasped by reason and intuition. Plato's forms are also the source and standard of truth, beauty, and goodness for all things.
- **Spinozist metaphysics**: Baruch Spinoza, a 17th-century Dutch philosopher, proposed that the world is a single substance that has infinite attributes, and that this substance is identical to **God** or **Nature**. Spinoza's God or Nature is not a personal or transcendent being, but an immanent and deterministic principle that governs all things according to necessary and rational laws. Spinoza's God or Nature is also the cause and effect of itself, and the only thing that exists and can be known.
- **Kantian metaphysics**: Immanuel Kant, an 18th-century German philosopher, proposed that the world is divided into two aspects: the **phenomenal world** of the **appearances**, which are the objects of our sensory and empirical experience, and the **noumenal world** of the **things in themselves**, which are the objects of our rational and speculative thought. Kant's things in themselves are not accessible or knowable by human cognition, but are the ultimate reality that underlies the appearances. Kant's things in themselves are also the source of our moral and practical freedom, as they are not subject to the causal and deterministic laws of the phenomenal world.

学者们是否认为世界是由一个非概念性的、非物理性的万物之源或神秘的原则所支配，并没有明确的答案，因为不同的形而上学理论对现实的性质和起源有不同的看法:

- **Idealist metaphysics**: [[理想主义|Idealism]] is the view that reality is fundamentally mental or spiritual, and that the physical world is either a manifestation, a projection, or an illusion of the mind or spirit.  
[[理想主义]]认为，现实从根本上是精神或心灵的，物质世界要么是心灵或精神的表现、投射，要么是幻觉。

Some idealist metaphysicians, such as George Berkeley and Christian Science, argue that there is a **non-conceptual, non-physical source of everything**, namely **God**, who is the only true substance and the creator and sustainer of all things.  
一些[[理想主义|唯心主义]]形而上学者，如乔治-伯克利和基督教科学，认为有一个**非概念的、非物理的万物之源，即**上帝，他是唯一的真实物质，是万物的创造者和维持者。

Other idealist metaphysicians, such as Immanuel Kant and Arthur Schopenhauer, argue that there is a **mystical principle** that underlies and transcends the phenomenal world, namely the **thing in itself** or the **will**, which is unknowable and irrational, but can be experienced through intuition or aesthetic contemplation  
其他[[理想主义|唯心主义]]形而上学者，如伊曼纽尔-康德和阿瑟-叔本华，认为有一个**神秘的原则**，作为现象世界的基础并超越现象世界，即**事物本身**或**意志**，它是不可知和非理性的，但可以通过直觉或审美沉思来体验。
- **Materialist metaphysics**: [[唯物主义|Materialism]] is the view that reality is fundamentally physical or material, and that the mental or spiritual world is either a product, a function, or an epiphenomenon of the physical world. Some materialist metaphysicians, such as Democritus and Daniel Dennett, argue that there is a **non-conceptual, non-physical source of everything**, namely **atoms** or **physical laws**, which are the basic and indivisible units and rules of all things. Other materialist metaphysicians, such as Karl Marx and Friedrich Nietzsche, argue that there is a **mystical principle** that shapes and transforms the material world, namely the **dialectic** or the **will to power**, which is a dynamic and creative force that drives history and evolution.
- **Dualist metaphysics**: [[二元论|Dualism]] is the view that reality is composed of two distinct and irreducible substances or realms, such as mind and body, spirit and matter, or good and evil. Some dualist metaphysicians, such as René Descartes and Manichaeism, argue that there are two **non-conceptual, non-physical sources of everything**, namely **God** and **Satan**, who are the opposite and conflicting principles of all things. Other dualist metaphysicians, such as Plato and Taoism, argue that there are two **mystical principles** that balance and complement each other, namely the **forms** or the **yin and yang**, which are the archetypal and harmonious patterns of all things.
