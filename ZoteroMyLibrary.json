  {"id":"1994slaterDepthPresenceVirtual","abstract":"This paper describes a study to assess the influence of a variety of factors on reported level of presence in immersive virtual environments. It introduces the idea of “stacking depth,” that is, where a participant can simulate the process of entering the virtual environment while already in such an environment, which can be repeated to several levels of depth. An experimental study including 24 subjects was carried out. Half of the subjects were transported between environments by using virtual head-mounted displays, and the other half by going through doors. Three other binary factors were whether or not gravity operated, whether or not the subject experienced a virtual precipice, and whether or not the subject was followed around by a virtual actor. Visual, auditory, and kinesthetic representation systems and egocentric/exocentric perceptual positions were assessed by a preexperiment questionnaire. Presence was assessed by the subjects as their sense of “being there,” the extent to which they experienced the virtual environments as more the presenting reality than the real world in which the experiment was taking place, and the extent to which the subject experienced the virtual environments as places visited rather than images seen. A logistic regression analysis revealed that subjective reporting of presence was significantly positively associated with visual and kinesthetic representation systems, and negatively with the auditory system. This was not surprising since the virtual reality system used was primarily visual. The analysis also showed a significant and positive association with stacking level depth for those who were transported between environments by using the virtual HMD, and a negative association for those who were transported through doors. Finally, four of the subjects moved their real left arm to match movement of the left arm of the virtual body displayed by the system. These four scored significantly higher on the kinesthetic representation system than the remainder of the subjects.","author":[{"family":"Slater","given":"Mel"},{"family":"Usoh","given":"Martin"},{"family":"Steed","given":"Anthony"}],"citation-key":"1994slaterDepthPresenceVirtual","container-title":"Presence: Teleoperators & Virtual Environments","DOI":"10.1162/pres.1994.3.2.130","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[[1994,1,1]]},"note":"MAG ID: 1586856071","page":"130-144","title":"Depth of presence in virtual environments","type":"article-journal","volume":"3"},

  {"id":"1998witmerMeasuringPresenceVirtual","abstract":"The effectiveness of virtual environments (VEs) has often been linked to the sense of presence reported by users of those VEs. (Presence is defined as the subjective experience of being in one place or environment, even when one is physically situated in another.) We believe that presence is a normal awareness phenomenon that requires directed attention and is based in the interaction between sensory stimulation, environmental factors that encourage involvement and enable immersion, and internal tendencies to become involved. Factors believed to underlie presence were described in the premier issue of Presence: Teleoperators and Virtual Environments. We used these factors and others as the basis for a presence questionnaire (PQ) to measure presence in VEs. In addition we developed an immersive tendencies questionnaire (ITQ) to measure differences in the tendencies of individuals to experience presence. These questionnaires are being used to evaluate relationships among reported presence and other research variables. Combined results from four experiments lead to the following conclusions: \nthe PQ and ITQ are internally consistent measures with high reliability;\nthere is a weak but consistent positive relation between presence and task performance in VEs;\nindividual tendencies as measured by the ITQ predict presence as measured by the PQ; and\nindividuals who report more simulator sickness symptoms in VE report less presence than those who report fewer symptoms.","author":[{"family":"Witmer","given":"Bob G."},{"literal":"Michael J.

To compress the octree we employ novel prediction techniques that were specifically designed for point sampled geometry and are based on local surface approximations to achieve high compression rates that outperform previous progressive coders for point-sampled geometry.

I then argue for an alternative approach, one that posits the constitutive entanglement of the social and the material in everyday life.

  {"id":"2008jennettMeasuringDefiningExperience","abstract":"Despite the word's common usage by gamers and reviewers alike, it is still not clear what immersion means. This paper explores immersion further by investigating whether immersion can be defined quantitatively, describing three experiments in total. The first experiment investigated participants' abilities to switch from an immersive to a non-immersive task. The second experiment investigated whether there were changes in participants' eye movements during an immersive task. The third experiment investigated the effect of an externally imposed pace of interaction on immersion and affective measures (state anxiety, positive affect, negative affect). Overall the findings suggest that immersion can be measured subjectively (through questionnaires) as well as objectively (task completion time, eye movements). Furthermore, immersion is not only viewed as a positive experience: negative emotions and uneasiness (i.e. anxiety) also run high.","author":[{"family":"Jennett","given":"Charlene"},{"family":"Cox","given":"Anna L."},{"family":"Cairns","given":"Paul"},{"family":"Dhoparee","given":"Samira"},{"family":"Epps","given":"Andrew"},{"family":"Tijs","given":"Tim"},{"family":"Walton","given":"Alison"}],"citation-key":"2008jennettMeasuringDefiningExperience","container-title":"International Journal of Human-computer Studies \\/ International Journal of Man-machine Studies","DOI":"10.1016/j.ijhcs.2008.04.004","issue":"9","issued":{"date-parts":[[2008,9,1]]},"note":"MAG ID: 2079476777","page":"641-661","title":"Measuring and defining the experience of immersion in games","type":"article-journal","volume":"66"},

Methods to assess the visual quality of digital videos as perceived by human observers are becoming increasingly important, due to the large number of applications that target humans as the end users of video. Owing to the many approaches to video quality assessment (VQA) that are being developed, there is a need for a diverse independent public database of distorted videos and subjective scores that is freely available. The resulting Laboratory for Image and Video Engineering (LIVE) Video Quality Database contains 150 distorted videos (obtained from ten uncompressed reference videos of natural scenes) that were created using four different commonly encountered distortion types. Each video was assessed by 38 human subjects, and the difference mean opinion scores (DMOS) were recorded. We also evaluated the performance of several state-of-the-art, publicly available full-reference VQA algorithms on the new database. A statistical evaluation of the relative performance of these algorithms is also presented. The database has a dedicated web presence that will be maintained as long as it remains relevant and the data is available online.","author":[{"family":"Seshadrinathan","given":"Kalpana"},{"family":"Soundararajan","given":"Rajiv"},{"family":"Bovik","given":"Alan C."},{"family":"Cormack","given":"Lawrence K."}],"citation-key":"2010seshadrinathanStudySubjectiveObjective","container-title":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","DOI":"10.1109/tip.2010.2042111","issue":"6","issued":{"date-parts":[[2010,6,1]]},"note":"MAG ID: 2117535912","page":"1427-1441","PMID":"20129861","title":"Study of Subjective and Objective Quality Assessment of Video","type":"article-journal","volume":"19"},

There are many possible reasons for this skewed balance between the visual and interactive aspects of a visualization. One reason is that interaction is an intangible concept that is difficult to design, quantify, and evaluate. Unlike for visual design, there are few examples that show visualization practitioners and researchers how to design the interaction for a new visualization in the best manner. In this article, we attempt to address this issue by collecting examples of visualizations with ‘best-in-class’ interaction and using them to extract practical design guidelines for future designers and researchers. We call this concept fluid interaction, and we propose an operational definition in terms of the direct manipulation and embodied interaction paradigms, the psychological concept of ‘flow’, and Norman's gulfs of execution and evaluation.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,1,24]]},"author":[{"family":"Elmqvist","given":"Niklas"},{"family":"Moere","given":"Andrew Vande"},{"family":"Jetter","given":"Hans-Christian"},{"family":"Cernea","given":"Daniel"},{"family":"Reiterer","given":"Harald"},{"family":"Jankun-Kelly","given":"TJ"}],"citation-key":"2011elmqvistFluidInteractionInformation","container-title":"Information Visualization","container-title-short":"Information Visualization","DOI":"10.1177/1473871611413180","ISSN":"1473-8716","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[[2011,10,1]]},"language":"en","page":"327-340","publisher":"SAGE Publications","source":"SAGE Journals","title":"Fluid interaction for information visualization","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1177/1473871611413180","volume":"10"},

  {"id":"2014besoldComputationalCreativityResearch","abstract":"Computational Creativity, Concept Invention, and General Intelligence in their own right all are flourishing research disciplines producing surprising and captivating results that continuously influence and change our view on where the limits of intelligent machines lie, each day pushing the boundaries a bit further. By 2014, all three fields also have left their marks on everyday life machine-composed music has been performed in concert halls, automated theorem provers are accepted tools in enterprises R&D departments, and cognitive architectures are being integrated in pilot assistance systems for next generation airplanes. Still, although the corresponding aims and goals are clearly similar (as are the common methods and approaches), the developments in each of these areas have happened mostly individually within the respective community and without closer relationships to the goings-on in the other two disciplines. In order to overcome this gap and to provide a common platform for interaction and exchange between the different directions, the International Workshops on Computational Creativity, Concept Invention, and General Intelligence (C3GI) have been started. At ECAI-2012 and IJCAI-2013, the first and second edition of C3GI each gathered researchers from all three fields, presenting recent developments and results from their research and in dialogue and joint debates bridging the disciplinary boundaries. The chapters contained in this book are based on expanded versions of accepted contributions to the workshops and additional selected contributions by renowned researchers in the relevant fields. Individually, they give an account of the state-of-the-art in their respective area, discussing both, theoretical approaches as well as implemented systems.

The effect of scattering is to spread angular (spatial frequency) information, which can be measured by phase space imaging. We derive a multi-slice forward model for homogenous volumetric scattering, then develop a reconstruction algorithm that exploits sparsity in order to further constrain the problem. By using 4D measurements for 3D reconstruction, the dimensionality mismatch provides significant robustness to multiple scattering, with either static or dynamic diffusers. Experimentally, our high-resolution 4D phase-space data is collected by a spectrogram setup, with results successfully recovering the 3D positions of multiple LEDs embedded in turbid scattering media.","author":[{"family":"Liu","given":"Hsiou-Yuan"},{"family":"Jonas","given":"Eric"},{"family":"Tian","given":"Lei"},{"family":"Zhong","given":"Jingshan"},{"family":"Recht","given":"Benjamin"},{"family":"Waller","given":"Laura"}],"citation-key":"2015liu3DImagingVolumetric","container-title":"Optics Express","DOI":"10.1364/oe.23.014461","issue":"11","issued":{"date-parts":[[2015,6,1]]},"note":"MAG ID: 1778307852","page":"14461-14471","PMID":"26072807","title":"3D imaging in volumetric scattering media using phase-space measurements","type":"article-journal","volume":"23"},

  {"id":"2015seufertSurveyQualityExperience","abstract":"Changing network conditions pose severe problems to video streaming in the Internet. HTTP adaptive streaming (HAS) is a technology employed by numerous video services that relieves these issues by adapting the video to the current network conditions. It enables service providers to improve resource utilization and Quality of Experience (QoE) by incorporating information from different layers in order to deliver and adapt a video in its best possible quality. Thereby, it allows taking into account end user device capabilities, available video quality levels, current network conditions, and current server load. For end users, the major benefits of HAS compared to classical HTTP video streaming are reduced interruptions of the video playback and higher bandwidth utilization, which both generally result in a higher QoE. Adaptation is possible by changing the frame rate, resolution, or quantization of the video, which can be done with various adaptation strategies and related client- and server-side actions. The technical development of HAS, existing open standardized solutions, but also proprietary solutions are reviewed in this paper as fundamental to derive the QoE influence factors that emerge as a result of adaptation. The main contribution is a comprehensive survey of QoE related works from human computer interaction and networking domains, which are structured according to the QoE impact of video adaptation. To be more precise, subjective studies that cover QoE aspects of adaptation dimensions and strategies are revisited. As a result, QoE influence factors of HAS and corresponding QoE models are identified, but also open issues and conflicting results are discussed. Furthermore, technical influence factors, which are often ignored in the context of HAS, affect perceptual QoE influence factors and are consequently analyzed. This survey gives the reader an overview of the current state of the art and recent developments. At the same time, it targets networking researchers who develop new solutions for HTTP video streaming or assess video streaming from a user centric point of view. Therefore, this paper is a major step toward truly improving HAS.","author":[{"family":"Seufert","given":"Michael"},{"family":"Egger","given":"Sebastian"},{"family":"Slanina","given":"Martin"},{"family":"Zinner","given":"Thomas"},{"family":"Hobfeld","given":"Tobias"},{"family":"Tran-Gia","given":"Phuoc"}],"citation-key":"2015seufertSurveyQualityExperience","container-title":"IEEE Communications Surveys and Tutorials","DOI":"10.1109/comst.2014.2360940","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2015,1,21]]},"note":"MAG ID: 1986570368","page":"469-492","title":"A Survey on Quality of Experience of HTTP Adaptive Streaming","type":"article-journal","volume":"17"},

  {"id":"2016stephensWeHaveAlways","abstract":"Although the “robot” is a twentieth century concept, machines that conform to the same definition—are capable of carrying out complex actions automatically—are part of a much longer history. This chapter will provide an overview of this history. It will trace the contemporary emergence of the robot back to the appearance of clockwork and mechanical automata in the early modern period. In so doing, the chapter will make two key contributions to this book’s study of robots and art. Firstly, it will argue that the concept of a robot predates the emergence of the word robot by several centuries, and that our understanding of the contemporary concept is enriched by recognition of this longer history. Secondly, it will show that, from its very inception, the history of robots has been closely entwined with that of art—evident not least in the fact the term itself derives from the context of theatre.

  {"id":"2017coeckelberghCanMachinesCreate","abstract":"As machines take over more tasks previously done by humans, artistic creation is also considered as a candidate to be automated. But, can machines create art? This paper offers a conceptual framework for a philosophical discussion of this question regarding the status of machine art and machine creativity. It breaks the main question down in three sub-questions, and then analyses each question in order to arrive at more precise problems with regard to machine art and machine creativity: What is art creation? What do we mean by art? And, what do we mean by machines create art? This then provides criteria we can use to discuss the main question in relation to particular cases. In the course of the analysis, the paper engages with theory in aesthetics, refers to literature on computational creativity, and contributes to the philosophy of technology and philosophical anthropology by reflecting on the role of technology in art creation. It is shown that the distinctions between process versus outcome criteria and subjective versus objective criteria of creativity are unstable. It is also argued that we should consider non-human forms of creativity, and not only cases where either humans or machines create art but also collaborations between humans and machines, which makes us reflect on human-technology relations. Finally, the paper questions the very approach that seeks criteria and suggests that the artistic status of machines may be shown and revealed in the human/non-human encounter before any theorizing or agreement takes place; an experience which then is presupposed when we theorize. This hints at a more general model of what happens in artistic perception and engagement as a hybrid human-technological and emergent or even poetic process, a model which leaves more room for letting ourselves be surprised by creativity—human and perhaps non-human.","author":[{"family":"Coeckelbergh","given":"Mark"}],"citation-key":"2017coeckelberghCanMachinesCreate","container-title":"Philosophy & Technology","DOI":"10.1007/s13347-016-0231-5","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[[2017,9,1]]},"note":"MAG ID: 2521584897","page":"285-303","title":"Can Machines Create Art","type":"article-journal","volume":"30"},

  {"id":"2017winnerArtifactsHavePolitics","abstract":"In controversies about technology and society, there is no idea more pro vocative than the notion that technical things have political qualities. At issue is the claim that the machines, structures, and systems of modern material culture can be accurately judged not only for their contributions of efficiency and pro ductivity, not merely for their positive and negative environmental side effects, but also for the ways in which they can embody specific forms of power and authority. Since ideas of this kind have a persistent and troubling presence in discussions about the meaning of technology, they deserve explicit attention.1 Writing in Technology and Culture almost two decades ago, Lewis Mumford gave classic statement to one version of the theme, arguing that \"from late neo lithic times in the Near East, right down to our own day, two technologies have recurrently existed side by side: one authoritarian, the other democratic, the first system-centered, immensely powerful, but inherently unstable, the other man-centered, relatively weak, but resourceful and durable.\"2 This thesis stands at the heart of Mumford's studies of the city, architecture, and the his tory of technics, and mirrors concerns voiced earlier in the works of Peter Kropotkin, William Morris, and other nineteenth century critics of industrial ism. More recently, antinuclear and prosolar energy movements in Europe and America have adopted a similar notion as a centerpiece in their arguments. Thus environmentalist Denis Hayes concludes, \"The increased deployment of nuclear power facilities must lead society toward authoritarianism. Indeed, safe reliance upon nuclear power as the principal source of energy may be possible only in a totalitarian state.\" Echoing the views of many proponents of appropri ate technology and the soft energy path, Hayes contends that \"dispersed solar sources are more compatible than centralized technologies with social equity, freedom and cultural pluralism.\"3 An eagerness to interpret technical artifacts in political language is by no means the exclusive property of critics of large-scale high-technology systems. A long lineage of boosters have insisted that the \"biggest and best\" that science and industry made available were the best guarantees of democracy, freedom, and social justice. The factory system, automobile, telephone, radio, television, the space program, and of course nuclear power itself have all at one time or another been described as democratizing, liberating forces.

  {"id":"2018damianoAnthropomorphismHumanRobotCoevolution","abstract":"Social robotics entertains a particular relationship with anthropomorphism, which it neither sees as a cognitive error, nor as a sign of immaturity. Rather it considers that this common human tendency, which is hypothesized to have evolved because it favoured cooperation among early humans, can be used today to facilitate social interactions between humans and a new type of cooperative and interactive agents – social robots. This approach leads social robotics to focus research on the engineering of robots that activate anthropomorphic projections in users. The objective is to give robots “social presence” and “social behaviors” that are sufficiently credible for human users to engage in comfortable and potentially long-lasting relations with these machines. This choice of ‘applied anthropomorphism’ as a research methodology exposes the artefacts produced by social robotics to ethical condemnation: social robots are judged to be a “cheating” technology, as they generate in users the illusion of reciprocal social and affective relations. This article takes position in this debate, not only developing a series of arguments relevant to philosophy of mind, cognitive sciences, and robotic AI, but also asking what social robotics can teach us about anthropomorphism. On this basis, we propose a theoretical perspective that characterizes anthropomorphism as a basic mechanism of interaction, and rebuts the ethical reflections that a priori condemns “anthropomorphism-based” social robots. To address the relevant ethical issues, we promote a critical experimentally-based ethical approach to social robotics, “synthetic ethics”, which aims at allowing humans to use social robots for two main goals: self-knowledge and moral growth.","author":[{"family":"Damiano","given":"Luisa"},{"family":"Dumouchel","given":"Paul"}],"citation-key":"2018damianoAnthropomorphismHumanRobotCoevolution","container-title":"Frontiers in Psychology","DOI":"10.3389/fpsyg.2018.00468","issued":{"date-parts":[[2018,3,26]]},"note":"MAG ID: 2791549227","page":"468-468","title":"Anthropomorphism in Human-Robot Co-evolution.","type":"article-journal","volume":"9"},

  {"id":"2018flemmenSocialSpaceCultural","abstract":"This analysis affirms the validity of Bourdieu's model of social class and the contention that classes tend to take the form of status groups, and challenges dominant positions in cultural stratification research, as well as recent analyses of 'emerging cultural capital'. In this article, we address whether and how contemporary social classes are marked by distinct lifestyles. We assess the model of the social space, a novel approach to class analysis pioneered by Bourdieu's Distinction. Although pivotal in Bourdieu's work, this model is too often overlooked in later research, making its contemporary relevance difficult to assess. We redress this by using the social space as a framework through which to study the cultural manifestation of class divisions in lifestyle differences in contemporary Norwegian society. Through a Multiple Correspondence Analysis (MCA) of unusually rich survey data, we reveal a structure strikingly similar to the model in Distinction, with a primary dimension of the volume of capital, and a secondary dimension of the composition of capital. While avoiding the substantialist fallacy of predefined notions of 'highbrow' and 'lowbrow' tastes, we explore how 168 lifestyle items map onto this social space. This reveals distinct classed lifestyles according to both dimensions of the social space. The lifestyles of the upper classes are distinctly demanding in terms of resources. Among those rich in economic capital, this manifests itself in a lifestyle which involves a quest for excitement, and which is bodily oriented and expensive. For their counterparts rich in cultural capital, a more ascetic and intellectually oriented lifestyle manifests itself, demanding of resources in the sense of requiring symbolic mastery, combining a taste for canonized, legitimate culture with more cosmopolitan and 'popular' items. In contrast to many studies' descriptions of the lower classes as 'disengaged' and 'inactive', we find evidence of distinct tastes on their part. Our analysis thus affirms the validity of Bourdieu's model of social class and the contention that classes tend to take the form of status groups. We challenge dominant positions in cultural stratification research, while questioning the aptness of the metaphor of the 'omnivore', as well as recent analyses of 'emerging cultural capital'.","author":[{"family":"Flemmen","given":"Magne"},{"family":"Jarness","given":"Vegard"},{"family":"Rosenlund","given":"Lennart"}],"citation-key":"2018flemmenSocialSpaceCultural","container-title":"The British journal of sociology","DOI":"10.1111/1468-4446.12295","issued":{"date-parts":[[2018]]},"source":"Semantic Scholar","title":"Social space and cultural class divisions: the forms of capital and contemporary lifestyle differentiation.","title-short":"Social space and cultural class divisions","type":"article-journal"},

However, these methods are computationally wasteful in attempt to predict 3D shapes, where information is rich only on the surfaces. In this paper, we propose a novel 3D generative modeling framework to efficiently generate object shapes in the form of dense point clouds. We use 2D convolutional operations to predict the 3D structure from multiple viewpoints and jointly apply geometric reasoning with 2D projection optimization. We introduce the pseudo-renderer, a differentiable module to approximate the true rendering operation, to synthesize novel depth maps for optimization. Experimental results for single-image 3D object reconstruction tasks show that we outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of shape similarity and prediction density.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,2,20]]},"author":[{"family":"Lin","given":"Chen-Hsuan"},{"family":"Kong","given":"Chen"},{"family":"Lucey","given":"Simon"}],"citation-key":"2018linLearningEfficientPoint","container-title":"Proceedings of the AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence","ISSN":"2374-3468","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2018,4,27]]},"language":"en","license":"Copyright (c)","number":"1","source":"ojs.aaai.org","title":"Learning Efficient Point Cloud Generation for Dense 3D Object Reconstruction","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://ojs.aaai.org/index.php/AAAI/article/view/12278","volume":"32"},

Despite recent progress in capture, display, storage, delivery and processing, the problem of a reliable approach to subjectively and objectively assess the quality of point clouds is still largely open. In this study, we extend the state of the art in projection-based objective quality assessment of point cloud imaging by investigating the impact of the number of viewpoints employed to assess the visual quality of a content, while discarding information that does not belong to the object under assessment, such as background color. Additionally, we propose assigning weights to the projected views based on interactivity information, obtained during subjective evaluation experiments. In the experiment that was conducted, human observers assessed a carefully selected collection of typical contents, subject to geometry and color degradations due to compression. The point cloud models were rendered using cubes as primitive elements with adaptive sizes based on local neighborhoods. Our results show that employing a larger number of projected views does not necessarily lead to better predictions of visual quality, while user interactivity information can improve the performance.","author":[{"family":"Alexiou","given":"Evangelos"},{"family":"Ebrahimi","given":"Touradj"}],"citation-key":"2019alexiouExploitingUserInteractivity","DOI":"10.1109/qomex.2019.8743277","issued":{"date-parts":[[2019,6,1]]},"note":"MAG ID: 2923105923","page":"1-6","title":"Exploiting user interactivity in quality assessment of point cloud imaging","type":"article-journal"},

This article probes these questions by first identifying the frameworks for defining and explaining art and evaluating its suitability for explaining machine artworks. It then explores how artworks have a necessary relationship with their human artists and the wider context of history, institutions, styles, and approaches and with audiences and artworlds. The article then questions whether machines have such a relational context and whether machines will ever live up to our standard of what constitutes an artwork as defined by us or whether machines are good only for assisting creativity.

Little to none of these tools attempt to tackle the challenge of modelling within immersive environments, that calls for new input modalities in order to move away from the traditional mouse and keyboard combination. In fact, relying on 2D devices for 3D manipulations does not seem to be effective as it does not offer the same degrees of freedom. We therefore present a solution that brings VR modelling capabilities to Grasshopper, a popular parametric design tool. Together with its associated proof-of-concept application, our extension offers a glimpse at new perspectives in that field. By taking advantage of them,one can edit geometries with real-time feedback on the generated models, without ever leaving the virtual environment. The distinctive characteristics of VR applications provide a range of benefits without obstructing design activities. The designer can indeed experience the architectural models at full scale from a realistic point-of-view and truly feels immersed right next to them.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,1,18]]},"author":[{"family":"Coppens","given":"Adrien"},{"family":"Mens","given":"Tom"},{"family":"Gallas","given":"Mohamed-Anis"}],"citation-key":"2019coppensParametricModellingImmersive","container-title":"arXiv:1906.05532 [cs]","issued":{"date-parts":[[2019,6,13]]},"source":"arXiv.org","title":"Parametric Modelling Within Immersive Environments: Building a Bridge Between Existing Tools and Virtual Reality Headsets","title-short":"Parametric Modelling Within Immersive Environments","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://arxiv.org/abs/1906.05532"},

  {"id":"2019sakerHybridSpaceDislocated","abstract":"Research in the field of mobile communication studies (MCS) has generally moved away from focusing on how mobile phones distract users from their physical environment to considering how the experience of space and place can be enhanced by locative smartphone applications. This article argues that trajectory may be complicated by the emergence of a new type of mobile technology: mobile virtual reality (MVR). While an increasing number of handsets are specifically developed with MVR in mind, there is little to no research that situates this phenomenon within the continuum of MCS.

  {"id":"2019schreerCapture3DVideo","abstract":"Volumetric video is regarded worldwide as the next important development step in the field of media production. Especially in the context of the extremely rapid development of the Virtual Reality (VR) and Augmented Reality (AR) markets, volumetric video is becoming a key technology. In this paper, a new capture and processing system for volumetric video is presented, called 3D Human Body Reconstruction (3DHBR). The system is based on 16 stereo pairs of high-resolution cameras capturing a moving person in 360 degree. A novel stereo approach provides depth information from all perspectives, which is then fused to a single consistent 3D point cloud. A meshing and mesh reduction algorithm finally produces a sequence of meshes that can be integrated into common render engines. Given that, an integration of realistic dynamic 3D reconstructions of moving persons in VR and AR applications is possible.","author":[{"family":"Schreer","given":"Oliver"},{"family":"Feldmann","given":"Ingo"},{"family":"Renault","given":"Sylvain"},{"family":"Zepp","given":"Marcus"},{"family":"Worchel","given":"Markus"},{"family":"Eisert","given":"Peter"},{"family":"Kauff","given":"Peter"}],"citation-key":"2019schreerCapture3DVideo","DOI":"10.1109/icip.2019.8803576","issued":{"date-parts":[[2019,9,1]]},"note":"MAG ID: 2971005514","page":"4310-4314","title":"Capture and 3D Video Processing of Volumetric Video","type":"article-journal"},
  {"id":"2019schwarzEmergingMPEGStandards","abstract":"Due to the increased popularity of augmented and virtual reality experiences, the interest in capturing the real world in multiple dimensions and in presenting it to users in an immersible fashion has never been higher. Distributing such representations enables users to freely navigate in multisensory 3D media experiences. Unfortunately, such representations require a large amount of data, not feasible for transmission on today's networks. Efficient compression technologies well adopted in the content chain are in high demand and are key components to democratize augmented and virtual reality applications. Moving Picture Experts Group, as one of the main standardization groups dealing with multimedia, identified the trend and started recently the process of building an open standard for compactly representing 3D point clouds, which are the 3D equivalent of the very well-known 2D pixels. This paper introduces the main developments and technical aspects of this ongoing standardization effort.","author":[{"family":"Schwarz","given":"Sebastian"},{"family":"Preda","given":"Marius"},{"family":"Baroncini","given":"Vittorio"},{"family":"Budagavi","given":"Madhukar"},{"family":"Cesar","given":"Pablo"},{"family":"Chou","given":"Philip A."},{"family":"Cohen","given":"Robert A."},{"family":"Krivokuća","given":"Maja"},{"family":"Lasserre","given":"Sébastien"},{"family":"Li","given":"Zhu"},{"family":"Llach","given":"Joan"},{"family":"Mammou","given":"Khaled"},{"family":"Mekuria","given":"Rufael"},{"family":"Nakagami","given":"Ohji"},{"family":"Siahaan","given":"Ernestasia"},{"family":"Tabatabai","given":"Ali"},{"family":"Tourapis","given":"Alexis M."},{"family":"Zakharchenko","given":"Vladyslav"}],"citation-key":"2019schwarzEmergingMPEGStandards","container-title":"IEEE Journal on Emerging and Selected Topics in Circuits and Systems","DOI":"10.1109/JETCAS.2018.2885981","ISSN":"2156-3365","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2019,3]]},"page":"133-148","source":"IEEE Xplore","title":"Emerging MPEG Standards for Point Cloud Compression","type":"article-journal","volume":"9"},

  {"id":"2019wangDynamicGraphCNN","abstract":"Point clouds provide a flexible geometric representation suitable for countless applications in computer graphics; they also comprise the raw output of most 3D data acquisition devices. While hand-designed features on point clouds have long been proposed in graphics and vision, however, the recent overwhelming success of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for image analysis suggests the value of adapting insight from CNN to the point cloud world. Point clouds inherently lack topological information, so designing a model to recover topology can enrich the representation power of point clouds. To this end, we propose a new neural network module dubbed EdgeConv suitable for CNN-based high-level tasks on point clouds, including classification and segmentation. EdgeConv acts on graphs dynamically computed in each layer of the network. It is differentiable and can be plugged into existing architectures. Compared to existing modules operating in extrinsic space or treating each point independently, EdgeConv has several appealing properties: It incorporates local neighborhood information; it can be stacked applied to learn global shape properties; and in multi-layer systems affinity in feature space captures semantic characteristics over potentially long distances in the original embedding. We show the performance of our model on standard benchmarks, including ModelNet40, ShapeNetPart, and S3DIS.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,2,20]]},"author":[{"family":"Wang","given":"Yue"},{"family":"Sun","given":"Yongbin"},{"family":"Liu","given":"Ziwei"},{"family":"Sarma","given":"Sanjay E."},{"family":"Bronstein","given":"Michael M."},{"family":"Solomon","given":"Justin M."}],"citation-key":"2019wangDynamicGraphCNN","container-title":"ACM Transactions on Graphics","container-title-short":"ACM Trans.

  {"id":"2020zermanTexturedMeshVs","abstract":"Volumetric video (VV) pipelines reached a high level of maturity, creating interest to use such content in interactive visualisation scenarios. VV allows real world content to be captured and represented as 3D models, which can be viewed from any chosen viewpoint and direction. Thus, VV is ideal to be used in augmented reality (AR) or virtual reality (VR) applications. Both textured polygonal meshes and point clouds are popular methods to represent VV. Even though the signal and image processing community slightly favours the point cloud due to its simpler data structure and faster acquisition, textured polygonal meshes might have other benefits such as better visual quality and easier integration with computer graphics pipelines. To better understand the difference between them, in this study, we compare these two different representation formats for a VV compression scenario utilising state-of-the-art compression techniques. For this purpose, we build a database and collect user opinion scores for subjective quality assessment of the compressed VV. The results show that meshes provide the best quality at high bitrates, while point clouds perform better for low bitrate cases. The created VV quality database will be made available online to support further scientific studies on VV quality assessment.","author":[{"family":"Zerman","given":"Emin"},{"family":"Ozcinar","given":"Cagri"},{"family":"Gao","given":"Pan"},{"family":"Smolic","given":"Aljosa"}],"citation-key":"2020zermanTexturedMeshVs","DOI":"10.1109/qomex48832.2020.9123137","issued":{"date-parts":[[2020,5,26]]},"note":"MAG ID: 3037401511","page":"1-6","title":"Textured Mesh vs Coloured Point Cloud: A Subjective Study for Volumetric Video Compression","type":"article-journal"},

  {"id":"2021blazhevaTiltBrushNew","abstract":"Interpenetration of ideas, culture, economics, raw materials and etc. are causing globalization in our society. This trend is also assisted by the growing technological innovations. Society is increasingly turning to digital tools to provide fast communications, access to information and goods through the global network, especially needed during the pandemic. In terms of art, these factors contribute to shifting the range from classical means of expression to contemporary art forms focused on digital media. Historically, the discovery of photography in the 19th century radically changed art. Painting frees itself from the function of reflecting objective reality and seeks new means of expression and meaning. In the early 20th century, new trends in the avant-garde art seek to depict intangible things away from visible reality such as the inner world of the artist, emotions, symbols, music, time and more. One of the brightest trends - Cubism is a typical example. It seeks a way to show objects rationally from several sides simultaneously - three-dimensional, but unfortunately it is limited by the means of expression - the two-dimensional surface of the canvas. Digital technologies today have a solution to this problem. They provide digital tools that completely change painting. The canvas no longer exists in the familiar way in which the artist works. It is becoming history. With the invention of VR glasses, the boundaries of visible reality and imagination in art have been removed to enter a new virtual world. Tilt Brush technology goes one step further, giving the opportunity to the artist to create 3D images with a brush in hand while moving in the virtual world he creates. Canvas doesn’t exist, it is a virtual digital world three-dimensional arising from the imagination of the artist and existing only through the eyes of the pink VR glasses. Here comes the question, will technology displace the artist's hand?

In this context, the so-called lenslet light field (LLF) cameras are able to go beyond the conventional 2D visual acquisition models, by enriching the visual representation with directional light measures for each pixel position. LLF imaging is associated to large amounts of data, thus critically demanding efficient coding solutions in order applications involving transmission and storage may be deployed. For this reason, considerable research efforts have been invested in recent years in developing increasingly efficient LLF imaging coding (LLFIC) solutions. In this context, the main objective of this paper is to review and evaluate some of the most relevant LLFIC solutions in the literature, guided by a novel classification taxonomy, which allows better organizing this field. In this way, more solid conclusions can be drawn about the current LLFIC status quo, thus allowing to better drive future research and standardization developments in this technical area.","author":[{"family":"Brites","given":"Catarina"},{"family":"Ascenso","given":"João"},{"family":"Pereira","given":"Fernando"}],"citation-key":"2021britesLensletLightField","container-title":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems for Video Technology","DOI":"10.1109/TCSVT.2020.2976784","ISSN":"1558-2205","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2021,1]]},"page":"339-354","source":"IEEE Xplore","title":"Lenslet Light Field Image Coding: Classifying, Reviewing and Evaluating","title-short":"Lenslet Light Field Image Coding","type":"article-journal","volume":"31"},

Roads (including the pavement), public squares, parks and beaches are typically considered public space. To a limited extent, government buildings which are open to the public, such as public libraries are public spaces, although they tend to have restricted areas and greater limits upon use. Although not considered public space, privately owned buildings or property visible from sidewalks and public thoroughfares may affect the public visual landscape, for example, by outdoor advertising. Recently, the concept of Shared space has been advanced to enhance the experience of pedestrians in public space jointly used by automobiles and other vehicles.\nPublic space has also become something of a touchstone for critical theory in relation to philosophy, (urban) geography, visual art, cultural studies, social studies and urban design. The term 'public space' is also often misconstrued to mean other things such as 'gathering place', which is an element of the larger concept of social space. Public spaces have often been valorized as democratic spaces of congregation and political participation, where groups can vocalize their rights.One of the earliest examples of public spaces are commons.

Using inertial measurement units mounted on foot is a feasible approach to improve the positioning accuracy for the human motion capture system. This paper presents a lightweight and low cost wireless inertial motion capture system for the simultaneous reconstruction of human body attitude and displacement. First of all, the device is based on human sensor networks and distributes 15 sensor nodes on the key human limbs. Then, after an initial sensor alignment with the reduced error, a zero‐speed update algorithm is used to calculate foot displacement. In addition, to constantly update the human posture information, a kind of motion reconstruction method based on the gradient descent method was used to fuse the sensor data. Finally, a new method of three‐dimensional human body reconstruction is proposed, which is different from the traditional motion capture system. Through unconstrained traversal of the root, the human posture and foot trajectory are combined to realize the synchronous reconstruction of posture and displacement. It is concluded from the experiment results that the estimation errors are well controlled, and motion patterns are consistent with the actual situation.","author":[{"family":"Qiu","given":"S."},{"family":"Zhao","given":"Hongkai"},{"family":"Jiang","given":"Nan"},{"family":"Wu","given":"Donghui"},{"family":"Song","given":"Guangcai"},{"family":"Zhao","given":"Hongyu"},{"family":"Wang","given":"Zhelong"}],"citation-key":"2021qiuSensorNetworkOriented","container-title":"International Journal of Intelligent Systems","DOI":"10.1002/int.22689","issued":{"date-parts":[[2021]]},"source":"Semantic Scholar","title":"Sensor network oriented human motion capture via wearable intelligent system","type":"article-journal"},

As they can entail significant volumes of data, point cloud compression is crucial for practical usage. Recently, point cloud geometry compression approaches based on deep neural networks have been explored. In this paper, we evaluate the ability to predict perceptual quality of typical voxel-based loss functions employed to train these networks. We find that the commonly used focal loss and weighted binary cross entropy are poorly correlated with human perception. We thus propose a perceptual loss function for 3D point clouds which outperforms existing loss functions on the ICIP2020 subjective dataset. In addition, we propose a novel truncated distance field voxel grid representation and find that it leads to sparser latent spaces and loss functions that are more correlated with perceived visual quality compared to a binary representation.

  {"id":"2021ritellaUsingChronotopeResearch","abstract":"In this paper, we examine the emergent concept of chronotope and its deployment for the examination of space-time relations in research on learning and education. Chronotopes have been defined in terms of socially emergent configurations of space-time, where space and time are considered as interdependent social constructions. Chronotope is seen as a conceptual and analytical tool that allows reaching a sociocultural and dialogical understanding of human action and interaction in space-time. We argue that the existing chronotopic research has not been sufficiently explicit concerning how units of analysis are selected and conceptualized. To facilitate a wider adoption of this concept, we introduce and discuss four dimensions of chronotopic units of analysis (foregrounding processes, dialogicality, material-discursive features of space-time, and interdependency of space-time). We illustrate these dimensions by discussing how they were implicitly or explicitly included in the conceptualization of the unit of analysis in exemplary studies. In particular, we show how including one or more of these dimensions enabled to make “visible” educationally relevant phenomena and to discuss significant aspects of pedagogical practice. In all, our article contributes to make explicit and discuss the methodological foundations for using chronotope to research the space-time relations of learning.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,2,3]]},"author":[{"family":"Ritella","given":"Giuseppe"},{"family":"Rajala","given":"Antti"},{"family":"Renshaw","given":"Peter"}],"citation-key":"2021ritellaUsingChronotopeResearch","collection-title":"SI: The Unit of Analysis in Learning Research: Approaches for Imagining a Transformative Agenda","container-title":"Learning, Culture and Social Interaction","container-title-short":"Learning, Culture and Social Interaction","DOI":"10.1016/j.lcsi.2020.100381","ISSN":"2210-6561","issued":{"date-parts":[[2021,12,1]]},"language":"en","page":"100381","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"Using chronotope to research the space-time relations of learning and education: Dimensions of the unit of analysis","title-short":"Using chronotope to research the space-time relations of learning and education","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2210656118302265","volume":"31"},

  {"id":"2021suHolographicCommunicationTechnology","abstract":"At present, video communication is mostly two-dimensional communication, and holographic immersive communication cannot be realized. With the advent of the 5G era, relying on the high-speed and low-latency characteristics of 5G networks, holographic communication that integrates human-computer interaction technology, artificial intelligence, sensor technology, holographic projection display technology, etc., can completely break the boundaries between local and remote spaces, and provide users with an immersive communication experience. In this paper, we combine holographic imaging technology to introduce the definition of holographic communication, and summarize the exploration results of major research institutions in this field in recent years. Finally, the system framework and key technologies of holographic communication are analyzed. Through the investigation of the difficulties in holographic communication technology, we have summarized the future technical research directions.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,1,20]]},"author":[{"family":"Su","given":"Minglan"},{"family":"Zhang","given":"Chaoying"},{"family":"Liu","given":"Qiaoqiao"},{"family":"Liang","given":"Baolin"},{"family":"Wang","given":"Jianxiu"}],"citation-key":"2021suHolographicCommunicationTechnology","container-title":"2021 International Conference on Neural Networks, Information and Communication Engineering","DOI":"10.1117/12.2615108","event-title":"2021 International Conference on Neural Networks, Information and Communication Engineering","issued":{"date-parts":[[2021,10,15]]},"page":"437-441","publisher":"SPIE","source":"www.spiedigitallibrary.org","title":"Holographic communication technology","type":"paper-conference","URL":"https://www.spiedigitallibrary.org/conference-proceedings-of-spie/11933/119331Z/Holographic-communication-technology/10.1117/12.2615108.full","volume":"11933"},

  {"id":"2021zermanUserBehaviourAnalysis","abstract":"Augmented reality (AR) is getting popular, and among other content creation techniques, volumetric video allows to bring dynamic real world content as captured by cameras into such applications. To develop efficient algorithms for compression and transmission of the volumetric media, it is important to understand how users will consume this new form of dynamic 3D content. In this paper, we analyse the user behaviour for the volumetric video consumption in AR. In particular, we study the distribution of users’ viewpoints, relative locations, and average distances from the content. For this purpose, we built an Android AR application using the volumetric video and conducted a user study remotely. The results show that users spent most of their time looking at the frontal part of the volumetric video, and this indicates the importance of the face in visual attention. The collected user behaviour data are made public to support further research.","author":[{"family":"Zerman","given":"Emin"},{"family":"Kulkarni","given":"Radhika"},{"family":"Smolic","given":"Aljosa"}],"citation-key":"2021zermanUserBehaviourAnalysis","container-title":"2021 13th International Conference on Quality of Multimedia Experience (QoMEX)","DOI":"10.1109/qomex51781.2021.9465456","issued":{"date-parts":[[2021,6,14]]},"note":"MAG ID: 3174510075","page":"129-132","title":"User Behaviour Analysis of Volumetric Video in Augmented Reality","type":"article-journal"},
