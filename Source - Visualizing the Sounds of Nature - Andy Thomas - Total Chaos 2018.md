(00:05) the moment [Music] myself creating these highly digital highly detailed organic tasteless using the same brush and Photoshop and in recent years I've just started getting into the animation side of things [Music]
(01:23) [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Applause] and I'm going to the graffiti in my
(03:16) early years and we got on the ground warehouse right katisa melon and this wasn't rain back then there's some general populations you wouldn't know about us and we all kind of had a little can go along there's a big influence on my life they electronica music and dancing and stuff but we have to sweat house sat in the industrial era melon face to do an eBay artwork and stuff and result wise I started doing twice myself in about 1990 a graphic design at the time so I was looking to like tight places and all
(04:00) that kind of stuff so I did heaps of these wires all my early start and people in graphic design I've and some of these pictures here like I always had this idea in my mind
(05:02) like yes well go to electronic parts and start to listen to the sounds of structure so this is kind of closest thing that kind of creating more animations a lot more more into the magistrata jeans and lots of sketches and I started to try and create programs these in ZBrush and mixing photography so I got out on night trips you take photos of plants and insects and kind of mix them out to give up some exactly that just hatred a child enables a brush is helping stop one day I decided to kind of combine which is the variance of one
(06:06) big giant structure and I was quite pleased with the result mechanical ones and all different types of Intel tree structures a couple of mice and as I was doing these I kind of realized how beautifully like things like moss and trees blended together and I started kind of done a bit more research about fractal theories to make sure this idea of myself with hidden patterns throughout nature on different scales so this is a beautiful example and we see these all throughout the night shows with repeating patterns like
(07:07) beautiful things like rivers and mountains and wiping blood cells all have these branching out structures it's almost like it's language through the universe I was really fascinated by this concept and did lots of research on this a big galaxy and a hurricane continent massively different scales the sign of Congress happiness when you say and this idea of self-similarity so I assume a lot object exactly proximately similar to a part of itself that's a kind of theory of fractal theory so I started
(07:56) taking my montages and I montage my montages and I got some really interesting results quite powerful results they have in signing that some things have lots of patience and sit there for a long time connecting these things I was interested in things like hotter bollock shapes when I was in the hospital I hated mathematics when I read my local innovation of examples of these things pop wallet checks make sure and I sold them and recently I've discovered how to create some of these things with computers switch back to VI
(09:11) so this is using a Danish and exporter so you get these beautiful kind of shapes created by mathematics really and Dex coded you know dating and this isn't new to me so I can kind of get under the hood and get a basic understanding of Hollywood but I couldn't construct one from scratch just yet experimenting and making artwork out of these threats all this getting some interesting results and a lot of the time when I'm doing my heart without night I find that stuck on my computer inside doing about nature
(10:11) and this is really disconnect so sometimes I'll if I can't go for walks in nature I'll go something like an aquarium and taking photos so here's an example of that go in beautiful heart block shapes and fractal shapes create sketches and stuff afterwards and interesting web pages using the same brush and combine them and you can say someone's were fading influence and some of these things from is got the museum and tech buyers crystals insects and crystals belong together dogs throw pitches
(11:08) but type things in like literally trying to weekly I not sure as such and it's all abstract kind of stocks by that for example reading is a brush just being one time I've been pacing in my artwork and people will probably familiar with his new brushwork fly and you know we had one fish montages and again you can say buckle in this particular pace of these black down pictures of galaxies and coral and insects and kind of mix them all off together my whole stack of surveys kind of makeshift distorted images
(12:11) see that and here's an example of one that we might trade cases that's a but I type in Queensland so let's do the trade and I'll just do sketches on top of it shapes divisive polygon shapes and how something is a brush and with this one I just went crazy to the same brush and spin just like my robot waits to solve it and creating this really detailed stuff anything son you must [Music]
(13:31) yes I'll just Isis model and carving sculpting with my Wacom tablet influence from tiger and all sorts of kind of soft pastel it's a very long time and then tightening the whole thing and he wants to hold them in three studio max and say brush and then later right so that's the end result learning
(15:24) complex detailed picture and some close-ups some of the faces in there and I'll take photos and things like just an example it's like it's in the water getting my macro lens I'll have lots to I'll even create some black in is a brush and makes it real fuzz like I'm twisting nature and twisting reality into forms that I want to take like I go on nature walks we've been part of well it's a museum so I do sketches along the way take those spend like away from them forest going around compartes of the
(16:18) world and after this trip I thought to myself what does the sound of New Zealand right parts look like so it's an abstract concept who's watching sound it's kind of like in jeopardy really but this is my interpretation of some of the sounds that I heard even for us okay
(17:45) so I'll scheme chooses when they quickly but basically sculpting ancient stock to ZBrush I'll get like textures from photos I'm taken and I'll pack that onto all these different paces times many fathers to it miss Gao max - Oh working man doing tests regulars and I'll actually sit there with a glass roof over in Photoshop piece of loss Block in which is inside time I could probably get like new beliefs going outside
(18:51) I'd like to do it sketching stuff on top of it at the same time so building his picture up thinking about how expensive it i mean it y I've got a part of it I've been knowing how these blend with each other Scotty's program character was just a beautiful fractal color images the key that father and I really say like stamps like flashing lights and colors in our minds if this is a pebble program to kind of capture that so I'm constantly drawing stuff on top
(20:05) and again I like a lot the idea of mixing things when we difference Kyle's like I was talking about before with the tractor kind of theories and stuff so it's segwayed and even makes me like this is walking again walking stops in the long just Mikey well they didn't get inside I already have pictures of galaxies in these sauces textures results out of that again like the idea of things working on different scales fine image
(21:18) so and myself and one stuff providing some of these things with particle effects and animation so I this was one of the results [Music] [Music] [Music]
(22:44) there's all these things a tree in my eye [Music] sounds distorted software [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music]
(24:04) [Music] [Music] so I've tried to this one I decided to other strip it back a bit and here's some of the quickly shades on this background this one so I'll like it references Detroit sketches I'll do like little tests that one was using a few effects and just making again like looking in textures in nitrogen Maybach this is optimized and it's an interesting ones it's like
(25:15) Australian you all ploughs and drawings and sketches and getting ideas about nature and then recreating particles and then I love drawing these sketches first to get my life down create some new boards just heaps of reference and stuff inspiration and after that I kind of put myself all experiment which is stripping it right back being less complex and this is a whale sound aside it's like getting a wave form of the whale sound and every time if it's [Music] [Music]
(26:30) [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] so basically what's going on here is a
(28:26) couple of bird sounds I'm taking them to Ableton and then using the waveform in pedestrian acts as a trigger so basic geometry and using the only that flight controller so they change the size of the sky look structure the geometry and then using the geometry as medium they accepted a and then snuck in a pod is back in again pretty simple really so I think more and more of these and
(29:34) some of the early experiments I did was just using electronic sounds slow again with this particular one I'm using the audio flight controller to create the host record it's like a visual sound structure [Music] so if I said by the way I find almost telling the crystals and off-site time and a chance to associate with each pod track and I really liked the TV try three so
(30:43) this is one of the mobility first pieces of animations I did sorry
(31:46) using Phoenicia max julia flood control i found by a sub don't mean Janie a little bit about a year ago structure [Music] so basically what's going on man is just using a hit expression yeah channel mauka right on tell me to go that the particles to go from the zero hour to like deposited thousand or
(32:50) something there is harmless wide for happens it it's particles so after experimenting electronic sounds I decided to delve into what it's selling for I came back to make sure again and where I live I'm Philip I own the seats of Beautiful's with its star just been enjoying what to sketches starting there and this is one of the first that I just and I really like to know it's like year-old velocity vectors and
(34:04) how beautiful our and when I see sound I'm seeing motion as well structure so I started creating all these sketches know I'm utilizing like the velocity effectiveness in sketching out velocity at this point I had a little more understanding about particle effects I'm thinking about that as I'm doing my sketches drawing auto attacks and stuff concepts going and on my first one to delve into this man goes really interesting example he was hiding velocity vectors here which is interesting futurism I was obsessed
(34:56) with in high school and around this time they were experimenting with visualizing and as well just frozen in time so I thought I can do the same thing and sound and this is like a frozen bird sound so I'm thinking about the movement of this thing as I'm doing it but it's rising in time just to experiment with reminiscing beer a Krakatoa of particles on top of there again like looking at things tonight sure a hot ball excite and then succinct lanes and stop replicate them into makes
(36:01) beautiful kind of day forms and so in my first this is my first example of trying to recreate this animated way [Music] [Music] so using a wife phones to trigger particle size [Music]
(37:50) so I after that I had a lot of people into me in Santa Ana my shorts a tryst with Jimena because so I getting lots of commissions and stuff it's like the cheapest ammunition in the Netherlands Kamisha need to do some animation so I've just got heaps of reference that I stopped doing sketches and stuff and I created this place thanks guys using the sand dollar cause it's a naughty guy on canary so again I'm using white for mr.
(38:31) that sound animation the particles [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] Aaron
(39:56) psychokinesis and structure its gets challenging go to be fast routes to my life and so after that I went on a big journey a couple of years ago and I went to Thailand and Finland's in Brazil I went from hot to cold to hot again I went to Thailand first God showed me around doing sketches and stuff as a guy
(41:01) I'm taking photos of lots of little thing there I've got to Finland where the government action institution you unconditionally travel around Finland and record the next bounce and I can imagine show them apply on their big screen there so that was a really good project so I'll go around with my macro lens and take photos and sketches do a little quick kind of Lux and let's write a software I really like this photo again it's going back to that being install similarity comes on the plane and I'm looking out at these
(41:49) clouds and then at 0.392 feet things to my look just like the clouds that's quite fast made my way back to the Arctic Circle and recorded dispersion and the sneak routes to Pizza photos and sketches and creating stuff in the 3d software at same time little sketches as I go that's why these places can't activate I'll make sure I love the textures in your eyes lots of sketches and this is a black woodpecker so I've done this little quick sketch and I managed to get a good recording of that
(42:43) one [Music] with my yeah [Music] so again GCC Phoenix FDIC a challenge in the Amazon
(44:34) this buddy is beautiful parrot that paradise that we track these two Charles to find and I didn't really have the time that's photographic equipment to taxpayers and thirds but was managed to get some english shots in this one i made a series about nations these birds nails using particle effects [Music] a text quite well like love tender
(45:59) involves well how am i selling them quicker than others like way back hey guys including the ring ring so yeah so I and that was played at these random festival in which I thought was delicious intensity for the project and finally just recently New York has conditioning unit she's licensed the work concert tour coming out in a few wait so that's where I want to next [Music] [Applause]
