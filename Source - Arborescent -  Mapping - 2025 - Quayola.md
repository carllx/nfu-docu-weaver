00:00:26,081 --> 00:00:26,902
This is Quayola.
这是Quayola。
2
00:00:26,922 --> 00:00:29,504
I'm a media artist based in Rome.
我是罗马的媒体艺术家。
3
00:00:29,924 --> 00:00:36,869
My work is heavily focused on technology, but not just as a tool, but also as a theme.
我的工作主要专注于技术，而不仅是一种工具，而且是主题。
4
00:00:37,329 --> 00:00:42,193
I'm interested in exploring the poetics of how technology is changing the way we look at the world.
我有兴趣探索技术如何改变我们对世界的看法。
5
00:00:42,353 --> 00:00:46,216
I look back at certain traditions, but with a very different pair of eyes.
我回头看某些传统，但有一双截然不同的眼睛。
6
00:00:48,448 --> 00:00:59,739
One of these, it's the tradition of landscape painting, which is something that I've been exploring throughout the years, the idea of observing nature as a vehicle to discover new aesthetics.
其中之一这是我多年来一直在探索的景观绘画的传统，这是==将自然视为发现新美学的工具==的想法。
7
00:01:02,201 --> 00:01:11,990
So you could say that my work, on one side, deals with technology, but also deals with the tensions and equilibrium between past, present and future.
因此，您可以说我的工作在一方面处理技术，但也涉及过去，现在和未来之间的紧张和平衡。
8
00:01:12,819 --> 00:01:29,373
The possibility of working with such an iconic masterpiece as Casa Batlló, it's certainly a great honor for me because some of the ideas, some of the rules behind its design, its composition, are so aligned to the inspirations that I have in my work.
与CasaBatlló这样的标志性杰作合作的可能性，对我来说，这无疑是一个荣幸的荣誉，因为一些想法，其设计背后的一些规则，其组成，与我在作品中的灵感相符。
9
00:01:29,693 --> 00:01:31,795
And I really saw that in ==Gaudí's work==.
我真的在高迪的作品中看到了这一点。
10
00:01:31,815 --> 00:01:44,841
You can see nature everywhere, the way things have been built, felt almost like something that wasn't designed, wasn't constructed, but almost grown out of himself.
您可以在任何地方看到==大自然已经建立了东西，几乎感觉像是没有设计的，没有建造的，但几乎是从自己身上长大的==。
11
00:01:45,141 --> 00:01:50,423
How sometimes he was really crafting processes and then following those processes.
有时他真的在制作过程，然后遵循这些过程。
12
00:01:50,703 --> 00:01:55,144
And the design is really a kind of documentation of such experimental process.
==设计确实是这种实验过程的文档==。
13
00:01:55,464 --> 00:02:03,787
And for me, this is really remarkable to kind of trust and emphasize and celebrate the complexity of nature.
对我而言，这确实是值得注意的，可以信任并强调和庆祝自然的复杂性。
14
00:02:06,826 --> 00:02:15,342
I've always seen Barcelona as a really forward-thinking city, where experimentation was at its core.
我一直认为==巴塞罗那是一个非常有远见的城市==，实验是其核心。
15
00:02:19,082 --> 00:02:43,436
Arborescent consists in a celebration both of the natural world, especially sort of botanical structures, that by moving with the wind, create complexity, create beauty, create sort of harmony, and how those dynamics relate and are influenced by the facade itself and by the geometry that ultimately will be used to project this stuff.
==树木是在自然世界的庆祝活动中组成的，特别是植物结构，通过与风一起移动创造复杂性，创造美丽，创建一种和谐，以及这些动态如何相关并受到立面本身以及最终将用于投射这些东西的几何形状的影响==。
16
00:02:44,602 --> 00:02:48,126
Music and images are developed and composed exactly at the same time.
音乐和图像是同时开发和制作的。
17
00:02:49,007 --> 00:02:57,698
I am also a musician, I also make music, and I think creating audiovisual compositions is really at the core of this project.
我也是音乐家，也是音乐家，我认为创建视听作品确实是该项目的核心。
18
00:03:04,065 --> 00:03:16,269
Arborescent, it is about nature, it is about contemplating nature as a vehicle to discover something new, to discover new aesthetics, to make you think about something else that might be familiar, but perhaps can be looked at in new ways.
树木，这是关于自然的，这是关于将自然作为发现新事物的工具，发现新的美学，让您思考可能熟悉的其他事情，但也许可以通过新的方式看待。
19
00:03:16,589 --> 00:03:20,170
And then the same thing somehow happens also with the facade of Casa Batlló.
然后，在卡萨·巴特洛（CasaBatlló）的立面上也发生了同样的事情。
20
00:03:20,210 --> 00:03:26,432
The more you look at it, the more you explore it with different systems, with different pair of eyes, the more you discover.
您看得越多，您就越多用不同的系统，不同的眼睛探索它，发现的越多。
21
00:03:27,733 --> 00:03:30,113
Arborescent, it's a celebration of our nature.
树木，这是对我们天性的庆祝。
22
00:03:30,614 --> 00:03:31,514
It's always been.
一直都是。
