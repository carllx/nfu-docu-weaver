State 与 Status 的区别
_Status_ would refer to the `progress` of a project, e.g. in testing, in preliminary research, etc. _State_  would refer more to the `condition` of a project, e.g. green-lighted, cancelled, on hold for financial analysis.
e.g. In considering this I asked myself two questions: What is the status of X? What sort of state is X in?
