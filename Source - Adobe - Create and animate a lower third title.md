00:00:00,700 --> 00:00:11,020
Premiere Pro allows you to create animated multiplayer titles and graphics that you can save as motion graphic templates for future use

2
00:00:11,110 --> 00:00:14,690
Let's take a look at the workflow to follow along

3
00:00:14,700 --> 00:00:18,140
download the sample files that accompany this tutorial

4
00:00:18,410 --> 00:00:22,360
I'm working on a project that's going to use the font Myriad Pro

5
00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:24,990
If your system doesn't have this font installed

6
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:27,260
it's included with Adobe Typekit

7
00:00:27,410 --> 00:00:29,720
part of your Creative Cloud license

8
00:00:29,790 --> 00:00:33,520
If you see a warning advising you that you don't have the font

9
00:00:33,530 --> 00:00:39,400
just check the box to sync it from Type Kit and then click the Sync Fonts button

10
00:00:39,450 --> 00:00:40,900
Wait for the fonts to sync

11
00:00:40,910 --> 00:00:47,250
and you'll want to reload the project so that existing titles using the font will be rendered correctly

12
00:00:47,710 --> 00:00:51,770
I'm in the graphics workspace in Premiere Pro

13
00:00:52,190 --> 00:00:55,790
I have this Brook pull segment sequence open

14
00:00:56,010 --> 00:01:01,390
It's a simple presentation where I'd like to show the speaker's names with a lower third title

15
00:01:01,670 --> 00:01:04,450
I'll just play the start so you can see what we have

16
00:01:04,510 --> 00:01:08,790
I'm switching over to Illustrator because this is kind of where we first started or dabbled in 3D

17
00:01:08,790 --> 00:01:09,160
right

18
00:01:09,160 --> 00:01:19,340
So the vector illustration 3D I'm going to position the playhead over the first clip right at the start of the sequence where I'd like my new title to begin

19
00:01:19,350 --> 00:01:28,150
All I need to do to create a new title is select the Type tool and I'll click somewhere in the picture and begin with the subject's name

20
00:01:28,370 --> 00:01:36,450
You'll notice in the sequence that the title is added to the lowest unlocked video track with enough space for the clip

21
00:01:36,490 --> 00:01:37,010
In this case

22
00:01:37,010 --> 00:01:38,060
that's video 3

23
00:01:38,070 --> 00:01:41,250
but actually I've got a two shot on that track

24
00:01:41,260 --> 00:01:42,820
Later in the sequence

25
00:01:42,820 --> 00:01:45,940
You can see it just there towards the end

26
00:01:45,990 --> 00:01:54,300
so I'm going to scroll up a little bit and I'm going to pull this graphic up onto a track that I've already named lower thirds

27
00:01:55,720 --> 00:01:57,390
Once you've added your text

28
00:01:57,390 --> 00:02:00,860
you can begin to change the settings for it in the Essential Graphics panel

29
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:06,540
And you'll notice that the edit pane of the Essential Graphics panel has come up automatically

30
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:13,020
HoweverI need to select the whole item and at the moment I am in the process of editing the text

31
00:02:13,030 --> 00:02:15,920
so I need to deselect and then re-select the layer

32
00:02:16,150 --> 00:02:22,620
I can do that by choosing the selection tool and then clicking on that item or just in the essential graphics panel

33
00:02:22,810 --> 00:02:25,110
I can click away from the layer and then select it

34
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:28,240
And now I've got the whole item and I can make some changes to it

35
00:02:28,380 --> 00:02:31,310
I'm going to set the font to

36
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:32,670
I think

37
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:34,470
mirrored Pro

38
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,620
I'll choose the bold type

39
00:02:37,650 --> 00:02:39,810
I'll turn on the faux bold as well

40
00:02:39,820 --> 00:02:42,120
just to give some extra weight to the font

41
00:02:42,310 --> 00:02:49,570
And then I am going to switch to the selection tool and I'm going to position this somewhere down near the bottom left corner of the video

42
00:02:50,070 --> 00:02:57,900
You'll notice I can click and drag or click and type to add numbers here in the Essential Graphics panel for this layer item as well

43
00:02:57,910 --> 00:02:58,320
In fact

44
00:02:58,320 --> 00:03:02,450
I think I'm going to set this manually to 140 horizontally

45
00:03:02,710 --> 00:03:08,950
and I'm pressing the Tab key on my keyboard and I'm going to put in 915 pixels vertically

46
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:10,950
This is just for precision

47
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:12,510
And that looks pretty good

48
00:03:12,520 --> 00:03:15,890
So I'm going to add a new text layer by going back to the type tool

49
00:03:16,290 --> 00:03:19,940
And I'll just click anywhere in the image for now

50
00:03:19,950 --> 00:03:24,170
And I'll add his job title 3D compositor

51
00:03:24,290 --> 00:03:25,970
Now I'll go to my selection tool

52
00:03:25,980 --> 00:03:27,650
so the item is selected

53
00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:32,380
and this time I'm going to use the italic form of mirrored Pro

54
00:03:33,090 --> 00:03:35,000
And let's move this down

55
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:39,590
And I think I need to put in some different font sizes

56
00:03:39,590 --> 00:03:42,610
Those are a little too large for this image

57
00:03:42,650 --> 00:03:46,110
Let's go for maybe 45 point

58
00:03:46,110 --> 00:03:52,970
For this smaller layer I'll just click and type that in tab away from the number and for the upper layer there

59
00:03:53,120 --> 00:04:03,430
maybe let's go for 65 point I'm going to select the lower layer and let's position that also at 140 pixels horizontally

60
00:04:03,620 --> 00:04:05,580
but maybe a little bit lower

61
00:04:05,590 --> 00:04:06,550
maybe 970

62
00:04:06,550 --> 00:04:08,360
972 vertically

63
00:04:08,630 --> 00:04:11,950
Of course this position is a science craft and an art

64
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:14,910
and you'll be making your own choices for positioning

65
00:04:15,140 --> 00:04:17,330
I think that kind of works for me Now

66
00:04:17,340 --> 00:04:23,920
let's say the director of this program suggests that we have a rectangle to surround the text

67
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:26,080
I'm going to go to the pen tool here

68
00:04:26,090 --> 00:04:29,220
I'm going to click and hold and select the Rectangle tool

69
00:04:29,330 --> 00:04:35,920
and I'm going to zoom out so I can see around the image and I'm going to drag from off screen here

70
00:04:36,540 --> 00:04:39,940
just across and over the text like that

71
00:04:39,990 --> 00:04:40,580
You'll notice

72
00:04:40,580 --> 00:04:41,000
of course

73
00:04:41,070 --> 00:04:42,810
that because this is a new layer

74
00:04:42,810 --> 00:04:43,750
it's added on top

75
00:04:43,750 --> 00:04:46,300
so it's in front of the existing text layers

76
00:04:46,430 --> 00:04:52,180
And you can see that up here at the top right corner of the essential graphics panel I'm going to take that shape layer

77
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:55,440
drag it down under and behind the text

78
00:04:55,580 --> 00:04:56,530
and now that I've done that

79
00:04:56,540 --> 00:04:58,490
I can see the positioning is not ideal

80
00:04:58,580 --> 00:05:02,480
Soso I'll go back to my selection tool and just pull that down little

81
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:05,650
something like that looks okay to ​‌​‌​​‌‌​​‌‌​​‌‌​‌​‌​​‌‌‌‌‌‌​​‌‌​​‌‌​​‌‌‌​​‌​​‌‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌​​​‌​​‌‌‌​​‌‌‌​‌​‌​‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌​‌​‌​​‌‌‌‌‌‌​​‌‌‌​​‌​​‌‌​‌​‌​​‌‌‌‌‌‌​​‌‌​​​‌​​‌‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌​‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌‌‌‌‌​​‌‌​‌​‌​​‌‌‌​​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌‌‌‌​​​‌‌‌​‌‌​​‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌‌​​‌‌‌​​‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌​​‌‌​​‌‌​​‌‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌‌​​‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌​​‌​​‌‌‌‌‌​​​‌‌​‌​‌​​‌‌‌​‌‌​​‌‌​‌‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌‌​​‌‌‌​‌​‌‌‌​​‌‌​‌​‌‌‌​‌‌​​‌​​‌‌​​‌‌​​‌‌​‌‌‌‌‌​‌​​​‌​​‌‌​‌‌​​​‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌​‌‌‌​​‌‌‌‌‌​​​‌‌​‌‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌​​‌‌​‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌​‌​‌​​‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌​‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌​‌‌​​​‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌​‌​‌‌‌​‌​‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌‌​​‌‌​‌‌‌‌‌​‌‌​​‌​​‌‌​‌​‌​​‌‌​‌​‌‌‌​‌‌​​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌‌​​‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌​​‌‌‌​​‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌​‌‌‌​​‌‌​​‌‌​​‌‌​‌‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌​​​‌‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌​‌​‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌​​‌‌​‌‌​​​‌‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌​‌‌​​​‌‌​‌​‌‌‌​‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌​‌‌​​​‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌​​‌‌​​​‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌‌​‌‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌‌‌‌​​​‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌​​‌​​‌‌​‌​‌‌‌​‌​‌‌‌​​‌‌​‌‌​​​‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌​‌‌‌​​‌‌‌‌‌​​​‌‌​‌​‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌‌​​‌‌‌​‌​‌‌‌‌‌​‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌‌​​‌‌‌‌‌‌​​‌‌​‌‌‌​​‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌‌​​‌​​‌‌​​‌‌​​‌‌‌​​‌​​‌‌‌​​‌​​‌‌​‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌me

82
00:05:05,660 --> 00:05:16,770
Now let's give it a color and rather than using the color swatch in the color picker I'm going to use the eye drop Ofer I'm just clicking to select it and I'll choose this dark ish background

83
00:05:17,060 --> 00:05:19,950
And now let's animate that coming on screen

84
00:05:19,960 --> 00:05:23,860
I'm going to set the playhead on the timeline to about one second in

85
00:05:23,860 --> 00:05:32,360
That's close enough and now with this shape layer selected I'm going to click right here on the toggle animation for position icon

86
00:05:32,650 --> 00:05:35,280
this icon is telling me what the controls are for

87
00:05:35,330 --> 00:05:38,180
but it also toggles animation off and on

88
00:05:38,260 --> 00:05:43,610
I'm going to click this and in doing so I'm adding a keyframe for the position for this layer

89
00:05:44,320 --> 00:06:01,020
So now I can move my playhead back to the start and just to keep this nice and level horizontally I'm going to drag the horizontal position control left until that rectangles off screen that way I haven't modified the vertical position at all

90
00:06:01,330 --> 00:06:04,330
And let's play that back and see how it looks

91
00:06:04,340 --> 00:06:07,980
I'm switching over to Illustrator because this not bad

92
00:06:08,060 --> 00:06:13,530
Now let's fade the text up just after the rectangle has finished moving on screen

93
00:06:13,570 --> 00:06:24,420
I've just scrub to a point after the rectangles arrived and I'm going to select both text layers in the essential graphics panel I'm holding down the Shift key here to select both

94
00:06:24,430 --> 00:06:29,840
and you can see all the controls that I can apply on mass to multiple layers are now visible

95
00:06:30,250 --> 00:06:38,560
I'm going to turn on keyframes in for Opacity and I'm going to pull the opacity control right the way down to 0

96
00:06:39,410 --> 00:06:46,970
Now let's move the playhead on a little and I'll pull the opacity back up once again

97
00:06:46,980 --> 00:06:50,440
I'll go back to the beginning of the sequence and let's take a look

98
00:06:51,650 --> 00:06:55,560
I'll just deselect so we don't have those highlights for the layers

99
00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:58,680
I'm switching over to Illustrator because this is kind of where we

100
00:06:59,130 --> 00:07:00,840
wellI think that kind of works

101
00:07:01,090 --> 00:07:09,500
I'm going to shorten the clip a little bit because the default duration for still image media in Premiere Pro right now is 5 seconds

102
00:07:09,610 --> 00:07:16,140
So I'm just going to trim this back so it's not overlapping the second clip down here

103
00:07:16,150 --> 00:07:18,970
And I think that rectangle is not really working for me

104
00:07:18,970 --> 00:07:25,080
So I'm going to select the graphic in the sequence and I'm just going to turn the visibility for the layer off

105
00:07:25,090 --> 00:07:27,870
So we still have the layer there in case we want it later

106
00:07:27,870 --> 00:07:28,530
But for now

107
00:07:28,570 --> 00:07:31,180
it's not impacting our title

108
00:07:31,350 --> 00:07:33,500
It has given me an idea though

109
00:07:33,630 --> 00:07:36,190
So I'm going to select these text layers again

110
00:07:36,230 --> 00:07:39,920
and I'm going to turn off the animation for opacity

111
00:07:40,150 --> 00:07:42,260
I get a warning saying this is going to delete keyframes

112
00:07:42,260 --> 00:07:43,200
and that's okay

113
00:07:43,620 --> 00:07:53,520
So now we don't have that fade up now with the graphic selected in the timeline panel I'm going to go to my Effect Controls panel

114
00:07:53,950 --> 00:08:01,970
All the changes made in the Essential Graphics panel add and update effects in the Effect Controls panel where they're fully editable

115
00:08:02,060 --> 00:08:03,030
Here's that shape layer

116
00:08:03,040 --> 00:08:03,840
for example

117
00:08:03,850 --> 00:08:06,660
where you can see the visibility is turned off

118
00:08:07,180 --> 00:08:10,310
I'm going to position my playhead at the start of the clip

119
00:08:11,160 --> 00:08:14,030
I'm going to expand the opacity for the whole clip

120
00:08:14,040 --> 00:08:15,970
and I'm going to add a mask

121
00:08:16,950 --> 00:08:20,740
I'll position this down off screen

122
00:08:22,180 --> 00:08:25,700
and now I'm going to enable animation for the mask path

123
00:08:26,030 --> 00:08:28,560
Move my playhead into the sequence a little

124
00:08:29,640 --> 00:08:31,650
make sure that mask is selected

125
00:08:32,190 --> 00:08:36,260
and reshape the mask so we can see the text

126
00:08:38,280 --> 00:08:38,710
In fact

127
00:08:38,710 --> 00:08:41,970
I kind of like the idea of it having an angle for the text as well

128
00:08:42,750 --> 00:08:47,590
I'm going to turn up the feathering so we have a soft edge

129
00:08:48,380 --> 00:08:50,700
And now you can see the keyframes have been added

130
00:08:50,710 --> 00:08:51,970
I'm going to deselect

131
00:08:52,020 --> 00:08:53,800
click back to the start of the sequence

132
00:08:55,090 --> 00:08:56,670
set my zoom to fit

133
00:08:56,760 --> 00:08:58,250
and let's take another look

134
00:08:58,760 --> 00:09:08,140
I'm switching over to Illustrator because this is kind of what perfect I'd like to use this new animated title in other parts of this project and in other projects

135
00:09:08,270 --> 00:09:13,660
So I'm going to export the animated title as a motion graphics template

136
00:09:14,330 --> 00:09:23,300
Again I'm selecting the clip in the sequence and I'm going to the graphics menu and I'm choosing export as motion graphics template

137
00:09:24,190 --> 00:09:28,270
At the top of this dialog box I've got the option to name the new template

138
00:09:28,390 --> 00:09:31,050
I'm going to call this presenter lower third

139
00:09:31,090 --> 00:09:34,400
We can then specify where the motion graphics template files going to go

140
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:41,380
Now I'm gonna choose the local templates folder because it's preset and directly accessible in the essential graphics panel

141
00:09:41,450 --> 00:09:45,700
I could choose local drive and just make it a file to share with other systems

142
00:09:45,750 --> 00:09:48,520
or I can choose one of my libraries

143
00:09:48,750 --> 00:09:53,160
You'll notice we have the option to include a video thumbnail and that actually allows you to hover

144
00:09:53,160 --> 00:09:56,970
scruband see the animation displayed in the essential graphics panel

145
00:09:56,980 --> 00:09:57,880
That's a great idea

146
00:09:57,890 --> 00:09:59,360
and I'm going to include it

147
00:09:59,410 --> 00:10:05,080
I also have these options to give me warnings if there are fonts that are not available on Typekit

148
00:10:05,080 --> 00:10:08,380
because of course you might have installed other fonts on your system

149
00:10:08,510 --> 00:10:12,650
If the motion graphics template uses effects that are not included with Premiere Pro

150
00:10:12,650 --> 00:10:18,940
because of course you could have third party effects and if the templates incompatible with mobile devices

151
00:10:19,020 --> 00:10:23,120
If you're producing a version that can't be used on any of the Adobe mobile apps

152
00:10:23,260 --> 00:10:25,290
I'm also going to put a keyword in here

153
00:10:25,300 --> 00:10:30,910
I'm going to just put the keyword in show 3 to help me remember which show this is associated with

154
00:10:31,080 --> 00:10:34,050
And that's going to be searchable in the Essential graphics panel

155
00:10:34,080 --> 00:10:35,040
I'll click OK

156
00:10:37,140 --> 00:10:43,010
And now let's add that motion graphics template to the second clip in our sequence

157
00:10:43,340 --> 00:10:47,160
I'm going to go to the Browse pane in the Essential Graphics panel

158
00:10:47,550 --> 00:10:52,180
And you'll notice here I can toggle between browsing Adobe Stock or browsing my templates

159
00:10:52,350 --> 00:10:59,680
I'm going to put a check in the box for the local templates folder rather than browsing inside specific libraries

160
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:07,680
And to save me searching manually I'm going to put in that tag that I added when I created the motion graphics template

161
00:11:07,840 --> 00:11:09,040
Show 3

162
00:11:09,740 --> 00:11:10,850
There's my lower third

163
00:11:11,240 --> 00:11:13,730
and I'll just increase the size of this thumbnail

164
00:11:13,740 --> 00:11:22,530
So you can see as I hover the mouse over the thumbnail I'm seeing that animation just as I would see the contents of a clip in the project panel

165
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:30,460
I'll drag this into my sequence and I'm going to place it right after the first lower third that I've got

166
00:11:30,780 --> 00:11:33,650
I'm going to select the graphic right away

167
00:11:33,660 --> 00:11:37,450
You can see I've got my editable layers available

168
00:11:38,220 --> 00:11:41,000
Let's move the playhead on a little so I can see the text

169
00:11:41,750 --> 00:11:42,710
Go to my type tool

170
00:11:43,220 --> 00:11:45,360
click on the first line of text

171
00:11:45,380 --> 00:11:48,090
I'm going to press Ctrl A here on Windows

172
00:11:48,090 --> 00:11:49,760
That would be command A on Mac OS

173
00:11:49,770 --> 00:11:51,820
and I'll put in the subject's name

174
00:11:53,340 --> 00:11:55,830
Click on to the layer that has the job title

175
00:11:56,060 --> 00:11:57,840
Again I'm pressing Ctrl A or CA

176
00:12:00,500 --> 00:12:07,120
And that's all I need to do to change the contents of the motion graphics template that's now been incorporated into my sequence

177
00:12:07,410 --> 00:12:10,750
I will just deselect and play that through

178
00:12:11,010 --> 00:12:11,390
Right

179
00:12:11,390 --> 00:12:13,520
So the vector illustration three DS

180
00:12:13,900 --> 00:12:17,150
Now I can see that there's an issue at the end of this graphic

181
00:12:17,160 --> 00:12:24,800
My mask is going to need to be adjusted because it's not long enough to show all of this longer job title

182
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:29,410
So let's select the motion graphics template in my sequence

183
00:12:29,420 --> 00:12:30,700
select the mask

184
00:12:32,180 --> 00:12:38,980
and I'm going to jump back to that keyframes so I don't add unnecessary keyframes and just stretch this out

185
00:12:40,640 --> 00:12:41,380
That looks better

186
00:12:41,720 --> 00:12:42,690
Or deselect

187
00:12:43,240 --> 00:12:45,700
jump back and play three

188
00:12:45,710 --> 00:12:46,100
right

189
00:12:46,100 --> 00:12:47,600
So the vector illustration

190
00:12:47,810 --> 00:12:48,660
perfect

191
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:55,110
That motion graphics plate is now available for use in other projects and as you've seen

192
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:56,650
is fully editable

193
00:12:56,760 --> 00:12:59,890
If anything needs adjusting when it's used again
