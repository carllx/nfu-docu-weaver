### **What is Montage?**

Montage(蒙太奇)是一种电影剪辑技巧，它将一系列短镜头组合在一起，将时间、信息或空间浓缩成一个简洁的画面序列。 创造出全新的意义的过程。

 

Montage can be used to:

- **Summarise a topic.** This could be an introduction to characters, story, or the world of the film.
- **Condense time, information or space.** This can be used to show a character's progression, such as in a training montage, or to quickly convey a lot of information to the audience.
- **Make a point.** By juxtaposing different images, a montage can create a visual metaphor that conveys a specific message or idea.
- **Evoke an emotional response.** This can be done through the use of music, quick cuts, and other editing techniques.

### **Different Methods of Montage**

Sergei Eisenstein, a pioneering Soviet filmmaker, identified five methods of montage:

- **Metric Montage:** Cutting shots to a specific length, regardless of content. This method often creates a disorienting or jarring effect.
- **Rhythmic Montage:** Cutting based on the content of the shots. This is also known as continuity editing. The length of each shot is determined by what is happening within the scene.
- **Tonal Montage:** Cutting based on the emotional tone of the shots. This can be used to create a specific mood or feeling.
- **Overtonal Montage:** Cutting according to the overall themes of the film, aiming to evoke an emotional response from the audience. This is a more complex method that combines elements of the previous three.
- **Intellectual Montage:** Cutting together very different shots to create a visual metaphor. This method requires the audience to think about the relationship between the images to understand the underlying message.

These methods are often used in combination.

### **Examples of Montage in Film**

- **Requiem for a Dream:** Uses a combination of metric and intellectual montage to show the chaotic effects of drug addiction.
- **Rocky:** Uses rhythmic montage to show Rocky Balboa’s training progression.
- **Whiplash:** Uses tonal montage to show the pain and determination of a young drummer.
- **Edge of Tomorrow:** Uses a combination of rhythmic and tonal montage to show Tom Cruise's character training to avoid death in a time loop.
- **BlacKkKlansman:** Uses intellectual montage to link the events of the film to present-day issues of racism.

### **Thinking in Montage**

- **Selection, Order, Rhythm:** The core components of editing. Focus on choosing the right shots, arranging them purposefully, and controlling their duration for impact.
- **Invisible Art:** Strive for editing that seamlessly guides the audience's emotions and understanding without drawing attention to itself.
- **Know the Footage:** Deeply familiarise yourself with the material to make informed decisions about shot selection and arrangement.
- **Trial and Error:** Editing is an iterative process. Experiment with different cuts and sequences to discover the most effective approach.
- **Structure:** Consider the overall structure of your edit and how individual scenes and sequences fit together.
