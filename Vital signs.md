In academic literature, signs or characteristics of life in an object are often referred to as "biomarkers." Other terms that may be used include "life indicators," "life signs," "biological indicators," and "biosignatures." These terms are used to describe any measurable property of an object that provides evidence of past or present life. Examples of biomarkers include chemical compounds, morphological features, and isotopic ratios.  
在学术文献中，物体中的生命迹象或特征通常被称为“生物标志物”。其他可能使用的术语包括“生命指标”、“生命体征”、“生物指标”和“生物印记”。这些术语用于描述提供过去或现在生命证据的物体的任何可测量属性。生物标志物的例子包括化合物、形态特征和同位素比率。

1.  Vital signs(生命体征): This term is often used to describe various physical and physiological indicators that can be used to determine if an organism is alive or dead, such as heart rate, blood pressure, and breathing rate.  
    该术语通常用于描述可用于确定生物体是活着还是死亡的各种物理和生理指标，例如心率、血压和呼吸率。
2.  Biomarkers(生物标志物): This term refers to specific measurable indicators of biological processes, such as enzymes, hormones, or proteins, that can be used to assess the health or well-being of an organism.  
    生物标志物：该术语是指生物过程的特定可测量指标，例如酶、激素或蛋白质，可用于评估生物体的健康或福祉。生物体中可测量的物质，其存在表明存在某种现象
    
3.  Life signs(生命体征): This term is used to describe various features or characteristics that are associated with living organisms, such as the ability to grow, reproduce, respond to stimuli, or maintain homeostasis.  
    生命体征：该术语用于描述与生物体相关的各种特征或特征，例如生长、繁殖、对刺激做出反应或维持体内平衡的能力。
    
4.  Life processes(生命过程): This term refers to the various metabolic and physiological processes that are essential for life, such as cellular respiration, photosynthesis, and DNA replication.  
    生命过程：这个术语指的是生命所必需的各种代谢和生理过程，例如细胞呼吸、光合作用和 DNA 复制。
    
5.  Life functions(生命机能): This term refers to the various physiological functions and activities that are necessary for life, such as respiration, circulation, and movement.  
    生命机能：指生命所必需的各种生理机能和活动，如呼吸、循环、运动等。
    

These words and phrases are used in academic literature to describe the signs or characteristics of life in an object, and they are helpful in understanding the essential components and processes that define life.  
这些词和短语在学术文献中用来描述物体中生命的迹象或特征，它们有助于理解定义生命的基本组成部分和过程。
