Transcript:
(00:06) I know I've made some very poor decisions recently but I can give you my complete assurance that my work will be back to normal I still got the greatest enthusiasm and confidence in the mission anybody know who said that huh how or were you too high to remember he later in the dialogue said honestly I think you ought to sit down calmly take a stress pill and think things over that's sort of what we're doing um Kubrick as most of you know was a genius a filmmaker of remarkable breaths and change but also a truly great
(01:02) photographer to which many people don't realize that he was a documentarian journalist before he started making films and so that idea of a person like that represents everything that the lens and Screen arts in this program aspires to um lastly um I want to put up I just hit it right somebody did it do it no um that's my first encounter of the first kind I didn't make that picture Adam Bell made that picture using photoshops generator an AI based program it's an abstraction it's a space it's a
(02:09) photograph it's something I am never really quite seen an image like that he made that what last November I think he made about 20 of them in about five minutes printed this one and so it sort of represents that slab for me from 2001. it's a remarkable image that you know we think okay we know those kind of images it's vague it's a enigmatic it's confusing it's in a way unrepocable and so that's what really said okay let's let's buy into this let's let's accept what's going on um lastly I want to just go through a bunch of
(03:07) terms the terms we all are hearing but we probably most of us don't know anything about some we do some we don't algorithm artificial intelligence artificial neutral Network back propagation they bailarism next networks Big Data chat box clustering cognitive Computing Computing Vision convolutional new neural networks known as cenn data mining data science deep learning decision trees expert systems genetic algorithm heuristics image recognition machine learning natural landscape processing neutral networks object
(03:55) recognition pattern recognition Predictive Analytics Quantum Computing reinforcement learning robotic self-organized Maps support vectors swarm intelligence tensorflow unsupervised learning virtual agents voice recognition adversarial learning Auto encoder biasm optimism cloud computing data data augmentation Dropout and unsolvable learning evolutionary algorithms Federated learning Gans there's more and those are all kind whoops I'm sorry I didn't mean to do that um there are many more of those in those are terms that
(04:42) are used all the time in this yeah I'll let you do it but there's some cautionary terms that I'd like to just begin to outline and I'm sure we're going to hear more of them today deep fake blue media red media Deep Mind indirect normality provenance cannons reverse porn alignment interpersonal interoperability research conversion goals discriminator good Hearts law art World art schools artists Geeks luddites slack data ethereal Source compiler thinking brush emitter artist emitter machine scaping bias Source capitalism
(05:26) commodity anagrams and terms so lastly since we did a little research there have been something like one million seven hundred thousand articles written about AI since late 2021. that's how prevalent it is so now I'd like to introduce Adam Bell who along with his colleague Natasha to put this all together Adam did so much of the nuts and bolts the everyday putting the stuff up it's a remarkable Enterprise thank you for your patience [Applause] good morning thank you Charles for that kind introduction and welcome and thank
(06:21) you all for joining us here today in person and Via our live stream uh before I introduce today's keynote speaker I just want to say a few brief words of thanks and review the day we've got a pack schedule and uh so I'm going to try and be brief following our Keynote speaker we will have a session on AI and the Arts education after a lunch break we'll resume with two sessions one on the ethical legal and social implications of AI and another on the creative applications of AI we've Consolidated the Q a sessions at the end
(06:59) of each session so if possible we ask that you come to the aisle and use the mic the moderators will also repeat any questions that you have if you can't reach a mic from your seating area we have a full day and limited time for questions but we're going to do our best to make sure that we're encouraged debate discussion because I'm sure there's going to be a lot that come up today the program which hopefully you guys grabbed in the lobby has a QR code inside that will take you to an event page that has the presenter bios the
(07:37) schedule schedule excuse me and additional readings to save time we're going to forego lengthy introductions for all of our distinguished speakers and instead they'll be reintroduced to you uh by the the moderators um first I want to thank Charles for initiating this event and helping make it a reality and Natasha Chuck my co-organizer for conceiving the framework for today's Symposium and bringing much needed criticality and rigor to the structure of today's sessions special thanks to the rest of the MFA photo video and related media
(08:14) Department uh Aaron Davis Alice Lee and Randy West for all their help putting this together and for all the students helping today I also want to thank SBA president David Rhodes our sponsor of the visual arts Foundation the office of academic and Affairs including the Provost Chris ciphers and Michael Severance the operation manager for all their support and assistance in making this event a reality and to the staff of the SVA theater who are helping today I also want to thank Adorama who is one of our sponsors and for their generous
(08:49) support lastly I just want to thank David Ross the chair of MFA our practice for putting me in touch with today's keynote speaker keto Style keto star will modestly lists her bio as being quote a filmmaker and writer who lives in Berlin for those of us familiar with her work and writing no she is much much more her film's installations essays and lectures provocatively explore the evolving nature of images in contemporary life and the ways that they are shaped and distorted by capitalist systems of control and surveillance her
(09:26) work is often humorous but is deeply revealing and pointed speaking to our contemporary moment I don't think it's an exaggeration to say that she's one of the most influential and widely respected artists today not only for her creative and theoretical work but also for her outspoken political views and integrity such as her recent refusal to accept the Hugo ball Prize or her withdrawal from the 2022 documenta both due to the respective institutions inability to address ongoing and historic anti-semitism Star Wars work has been widely exhibited
(10:02) in Solo and group exhibitions internationally including her most recent 2020 survey I Will Survive presented by the steitalic museum in Amsterdam in collaboration with the pompidou in Paris she's the also the author of several highly acclaimed collections of essays including The Wretched of the screen and duty-free art art in the age of planetary War she is currently of the professor of experimental film and video at the udk University arts in Berlin in an interview published by Moma star was asked quote what does it mean to be
(10:39) an artist today rejecting the market-driven pretense of the art world she speculated that perhaps art should quote look listen and interpret with precision imagine without compromise or fear today as we address the topic of AI and the lens-based images and all the questions and anxiety that that relationship provokes this astute advice should remain foremost in our minds is my great honor to introduce uh [Applause] foreign
(11:55) thank you thank you so much everyone for being here at this early time of the day and thank you so much for the very generous introduction and invitation I have to apologize because actually I haven't been automated enough you know I'm still recovering from a very heavy flu so I'm going to be somewhat diminished already if you need machine machine learning it's not yet there you know I would have loved to present some shiny Avatar of mine delivering this talk uh you know on my behalf instead but we I think we have to wait some
(12:35) years and then it's going to be really really expensive 

## AI 图像生成器的局限性

okay so my talk is called mean images and I wanted to Think Through you know all these new renderings by the new prompt based generators such as Dao e my journey stable diffusion you name it you've all played around with them you know what I mean but what why am I calling them mean images I was very inspired by a quote by novelist Ted Chang a while ago he described the text output of chat GPT I think it was in a text in the New Yorker he described it as a blurry jpeg of all the text in the
(13:24) web so basically he described this text output as something like a semantic poor image I thought okay yes um this output is sort of compressed it's diminished it's you know a bit um it's it's poor basically but there is also another quality to it which I think is really decisive namely that it is kind all these renderings are made out of the average booty from the internet so basically what happens is that millions of pictures are scraped from the internet and then they are sort of 

(14:08)  **averaged into some mean or median** and this is basically driving the output of most of these generators so mean in the sense of median or statistics and I think this is a really important background for many of these images and I will come back to this later but on the other hand this English term mean also has a lot of different meanings meanings being one of them all of which apply mean refers to a sort of shabby or minor Origins to something that is also the norm and also equaling to something which is nasty and I will also come back to this point later it
(14:52) relates to meaning but it also has something in common with the term Commons and also with the term means in financial or instrumental terms so the term mean is in itself some kind of composite you know that bakes together somewhat incompatible meanings within one framework but they are also far from being sort of random hallucinations because they do pick up on latent social patterns that encode conflict significations a sort of vector coordinates and they visualize real existing social attitudes and this is
(15:36) also why I think they are quite interesting they are social dreams without sleep that process Society is somewhat irrational functions to their logical conclusions and also they rely on vast infrastructures that are basically creating huge amounts of pollution of carbon emissions and they also create disenfranchised labor that exploits political conflict as a resource so this was the too long to read version now I would be happy to go home but I'm going to go into detail with all of these 

## Janus Head(双面头)问题

okay what is this this is a very
(16:25) interesting glitch that um emerged last autumn when people started using application which is called dream fusion and what is dream Fusion doing it's basically transforming text prompts into 3D models or Point clouds and people started noticing if you generate 3D models through these applications then they will start showing many heads right they will have heads all over the place pointing in all kinds of different directions and they called this the Twitter users the Janus problem or the Janus head problem um what is Janus it's this Roman god
(17:12) obviously who is known for **being portrayed having several heads looking into different directions one into the past one into the future** but it is also the God of War and Peace the god that stands in to signify a moment of break or of transition and so but I think that this jainous head problem also touches on a very interesting issue because you have basically several individuals being portrayed as one entity so it also points to the problem of the relation between the individual and the many or the one and the crowd or the group and
(18:01) the individual the class etc etc etc what is the relation for example between private and common interests it's also something which would one could see baked into this kind of representation um this is a very interesting tool which probably most of you know already it's a web tool um a search engine called have I been trained developed by Matt dryhurst and Holly Herndon and you are able through this search engine to check whether your own images have been used to train machine learning models in this case a model called stable diffusion which was
(18:49) trained on a huge scale data set called The Lion 5B 5B for 5 billion text image Pairs and through using this tool you can check if your own images have been used to train this model or not and I entered my name and sure enough this is what I came up not surprising I guess if you enter your own names well you will all show up in that database as well 

## AI 对社会符号的提取

what do diffusion models do as you all know they render you know some rendering upon giving a prompt input by first adding and then subtracting some noise so I was curious to see how with the
(19:40) model deal with this kind of input with this kind of training data and I entered a very very simple prompt it was just an image of hito style and this is what I got which is not the most flattering before after juxta position for sure I cannot really recommend this treatment maybe one could call it an mandatory inter artificially intelligent hair loss device so this thing looks rather mean or maybe even demeaning but I think that this is precisely the point because the question is not is it mean or not yes it is but
(20:26) what kind of mean is it whose mean is it which one and stable diffusion renders a number any any number of portraits of mine in this kind of state of Frozen age rate and you don't really exactly know how it gets from you know the training data to this output but on the other hand you know usually people would blame it on some kind of Black Box algorithm where secret operation take place this is not the case with stable diffusion **we know the code it's out in the open so this is not a black box algorithm** what this
(21:07) actually is is a white box algorithm which means that I have been white boxed it is a social filter if you like it is an approximate of how Society through a filter of averaged internet garbage sees me all it takes is to sort of remove the noise of reality from my photos and just extract the social signal instead and this is what you get but I'm not complaining because actually I think it's fair enough I have my own internal model of what stable diffusion actually looks like so if you prompt me to tell you what does stable diffusion
(21:53) look like it looks like this this is the only one and only true portrait of diffusion models and I'm running this kind of Revenge algorithm operation in my own head so the question is what happened on the way from these more traditional photographs to what I call statistical renderings what happened and I think that these statistical renderings shift the focus of representation from establishing fact to expressing probabilities they are data visualizations that do not really require any longer sort of indexical
(22:40) reference that photographs used to have but um they basically render probabilities and what they do is they represent the norm by signaling the mean and they represent likenesses with likelinesses let me give you one example that's a very strange paper from something which is called the racial faces in the wild database uh what is this supposed to be and my own face again is entangled with one of these render ghosts racial render goes on the right hand side where does this come from in 2016 my name popped up in this list and this is a list of people
(23:41) who were part of something and this is 2016 right so this is the Stone Age of machine learning this is the Paleolithic this is like I don't know 100 000 years ago anyway uh this was a database it still is a database called Microsoft celeb and it contained the names and photos of 100 000 people who somehow happen to be on the internet and all of these people were parts of this database and this is information which was released and generated by Adam Harvey and Jules LaPlace in the scope of their project megapixel where they looked into
(24:22) a lot of these large-scale databases and you can see basically all the people that were content in there and I tell you I would be so unhappy if I wasn't on that list you know I think it's a real honor to be part of these people but what was this list actually used for if your name was mentioned on the list then Microsoft would encourage researchers to download photos of your face to build a biometric profiles of yours and I had become part obviously of an early training data set for more inclusive facial recognition algorithms
(25:05) and sure enough other researchers used it among them the racial faces in the wild guys who had the specific goal to make facial recognition more diverse and racially inclusive by you know these kind of algorithms being able to recognize people other than white people and they um came up with came up with sorry okay yeah 

## 统计学与优生学的历史背景

came up with this contraption which was able to sort of segregate four different types racial phenotypes from one another which is what these render ghosts are about on the right hand side and it's no coincidence that they recall
(25:59) these early statistical photographic Composites from the 19th century made by Francis Goten who was the founder of statistics on the one hand but also Eugenics on the other hand and he came up with a photographic method to visualize what he called certain types this is the so-called Jewish Jewish type he also had types referring to certain illnesses but also to criminality and the interesting thing is that he tried to visualize all these types essentially to get rid of them right because they were supposed to be overcome or
(26:41) eliminated by attempts of what they called plant breeding racial Improvement and so on and so on so the the science of Statistics in its early days is very much entwined with eugenicism and the render goes turned out to be actual mug shots and this background has been explored quite a lot by people like Wendy Chan for example Lila Lee Morrison they went a lot into you know figuring out this background but this is not exactly where um statistics is today because over the course of the 20th century there were of
(27:27) course many many improvements refinements fine-tuning being made as Jordan joke explained in his book revolutionary mathematics this was more or less by integrating a lot of tools which were basically based on Market imaginaries including parameters such as costs and affordances and contracts into calculation and in his um and his words disintegrated the mathematics of a well-calibrated casino into statistical science 

(28:16)  which means that the calculation of probability was **optimized for profitability and the interesting thing now with the**
**statistical renderings is that they enhance** this operation with a quasi-magical effect because what seems to happen with all the prompt generator renderings is somehow magically categories start emerging out from the data and this is a real difference you know to how data used to be visualized before because you know there were graphs and diagrams and clusters and and whatnot you know but now data are being visualized in the exact shape of this thing they are supposed to represent so for example you would be visualizing a
(28:58) weather report through the image of a cloud and thus you have this impression of immediacy you know of the lack of any kind of mediation or alienation sort of the statistical reality itself seems to sort of emanate from these renderings and Galton did this for faces somehow but the interesting thing with the prompt renderings is that they not only do it for persons or people but also for objects for actions basically for the whole of reality in a way these operations are racializing reality they tend to emulate neural networks tend to
(29:44) emulate a market logic in which reality is permanently at auction and if we go back to these sort of strange elephants and and scrollers then we can see how this really works out because you remember the very basic example to remain to explain statistics to anyone is the example of the coin which is thrown up in the air and then it somehow comes back with a probability of 50 percent of being either heads or tails if the coin is not rigged and if the experiment is even and fair and here we can see that somehow there is a very interesting
(30:37) model of probability going on in here because with these animals you know if we throw them so to speak up in the air they will come down heads and heads not heads and tails the probability for them coming down tails is very much diminished right so we have to conclude that there is a sort of fork of probability Theory going on Within These models which we can could describe as the head and head solution and how does this work out with the examples I just mentioned with those because they're the the goal of 

### 种族分类偏见强化机制

![bg fit left:50% vertical](https://i.imgur.com/kH8wlr7.webp)

(31:18) these operations was to make you know facial recognition more diverse and inclusive and thus reducing bias but this example end up basically in order to reduce bias fine-tuning bias you know and improving basically racial discrimination and that's an interesting head and head solution so one of the consequences of this data set was that a company called say **Sense Time** use these kinds of materials it is a computer vision surveillance company that provided surveillance to Chinese authorities to Monitor and track **Uygurs**
(32:08) minority members has been flagged numerous time for human rights violations Etc so it seems that the combination of my own name and face was not only used to optimize Machine Vision for racial classification but that this was put into practical application by a real existing autocracy to sort of identify and surveyor members of ethnic minorities and as I said this is an example from the Stone Age right a facial recognition machine learning etc etc by now all your faces and names have been used for a similar operations there is no doubts
(32:54) about that so this is one of the reasons why you know the idea of reducing bias within large-scale data sets and machine learning models Etc only superficially solves problems because it limits changes to parts of the output to make it sort of more palatable on a cosmetic level for Western audiences but it also leaves the structures of the industry and its modes of production intact and what do I mean with that because I mean who who is who is doing the labor basically that's the question who is owning the means of production in this
(33:44) kind of mean production and if we go back to this example of trying to eliminate buyers then this is quite simple reducing bias is mainly done by training so-called filters which are then basically responsible for getting rid of harmful illegal biased offensive etc etc material so how is this being done you need a lot of people basically humans who are subjected to exactly the same thing which you do not want to see and they have to identify and tag it there have been a lot of um examples out on the public recently of
(34:33) the so-called ghost workers or micro workers which very often are based in the so-called Global South who are tasked with this kind of Labor Venezuela for example is a very important hub for this kind of micro work but also places like Iraq and Palestine are quite important hubs of micro labor where people are basically tasked to tag and identify the material which other people are not supposed to see and interestingly enough this does not only happen in the global South I was part of a group effort with a German weekly called decide recently
(35:16) where some of my colleagues did some research and found out that also in Germany there is a huge population of people who are bought from so to speak legal labor because they are refugees or waiting for Refugee status etc etc who are doing this kind of Labor to um and this is one example from one person who was doing this kind of job in Germany who is describing how he had basically to identify pictures of cards and try to decide whether these were suicide attempts or not and then he had to go to therapy like all of his
(36:02) colleagues none of which all of which were very very educated all of them had masters degrees were scientists and so on and they were supposed to sit at the desks for 10 hour shifts to basically tag and identify a picture violin pictures another interesting testimony also it's so recent I haven't even managed to translate it is that there is a large contingent of course of Syrian refugees in Germany who are also doing this labor who during the recent earthquake in turkey and Syria suddenly saw pictures you know of their home regions of their
(36:41) hometowns even of their own houses being destroyed and they were supposed to basically tag these images so they would not possibly you know traumatize everyone else so that's the kind of in a way Global labor situation that is also created precisely by the fact of trying to reduce or eliminate harm or bias there is a reality being created of a sort of global class society in which political conflict and displacement and also War basically produces the kind of disenfranchised people who would be willing to take on
(37:28) this kind of jobs and that's one of the consequences of what I could call in this case the mean production the mean modes of production in this field there's also some more absurdish consequence which is that there are many machine learning applications which just pretend to be artificially intelligent or even based on any kind of computation because what happens if you put any kind of query there will actually be a human at the end of the line which masquerades as an artificial intelligence but which basically answer the questions
(38:16) themselves these are quotes from a researcher who interviewed people in France one student who was tasked to do this kind of labor was basically impersonating an AI to give recommendations for luxury travel to people who wanted to have this kind of information and this leads to what Astra Taylor calls so-called photomation it's not automation but people pretending to be AIS so the interesting thing is that maybe these labor conditions also bring me back to a more General observation namely what is the relation of
(39:02) statistics and reality and what are these renderings showing us actually is maybe not reality but something something related and many people including myself we have interpreted this shift from a science which is based on causality towards one which is based on probability and correlation as a sort of slide into magic and Alchemy but I think that this slide also captures a very a real existing aspect of reality namely the fact that reality in itself is sometimes more structured like a casino than any sort of logical you know
(39:47) construction I read this blog post by a young person who was explaining why they were playing video games in times of depression so whenever they would feel they were getting depressed they would start playing certain video games because there was you know a sense of calculable reward in there so if you would basically plant a crop in a video game and irrigate it and you know take care of it then at the end of the day you would have a crop or if you would want to build a house or something and just keep building it and it takes a long
(40:31) time but at the end of the day you have a house and this person said this is not what it works like in reality you know there is no logical correlation between input and output the effort does not correspond at all to the result so the the the causality is broken but not it this is reality it is broken in there is a whole section of Labor um both in the very precarious end but also on the high end in which basically correlation is the norm you know you you don't know I mean it's a kind of Lottery and in this case it's it's also way more
(41:14) rational to basically buy a lottery ticket than to expect any wage from the labor you're performing because this is no longer the Paradigm that reality operates in and this is something which in a way those statistical renderings pick up on right they portray a world in which causality and logic has receded to certain you know sectors and we are basically chance and random operations and pure luck are the norm foreign and this is also how a writer called Phil Jones describes you know the reality of micro work he says workers
(42:08) operate increasingly in a quasi magical economy of gambling and Lottery and he has this memorable term that wage transforms into a wager so basically it transitions into the realm of pure chance and contingency all these things in my view make one thing very clear which is that you know we talk about training a lot when we talk about machine learning about models data sets blah blah blah and so on and it always seems as if you know something on the side of the machine is being trained but I think that actually the
(42:53) main thing that's being trained is not the machine or models or anything it's ourselves so it's us as users that are being trained and this makes also one thing quite clear um what are we being trained to do and this is quite interesting they train basically the people who use these kind of applications they train them to get used to new production pipelines to new software Stacks which integrate all these machine learning applications Etc we are being trained to get used to a production environment in which we
(43:40) have to pay constantly rent to some Corporation or another to even you know not only do our work but even be able to access our own work Adobe Cloud I don't know how many people are still stuck in there is a real you know example of how you have to pay rent every month to a corporation to even be able to open your own files right and that is supposed to be the norm that you are getting trained to to get used to this kind of environments in which large-scale corporations like for example Microsoft provide the whole pipeline you know from
(44:22) the cloud cloud service Azure in the case of Microsoft via the softwares over the Hardwares etc etc down to the last piece of input and in order to use these Monopoly environment and Microsoft have announced I think two days ago that they were going to implement GPT for Based Services into their office suite etc etc etc so this is what we are being trained to do to accept these kinds of Monopoly pipelines as a sort of new normality and to get used you know to have to pay rent to them every month and so basically what people are being
(45:07) trained is to accept this infrastructure which is a massive top-down Cloud infrastructure based on this kind of cheap click labor performed by people in Conflict regions Etc and also this is something I have written a whole other text upon there is a of course tremendous environmental impact also that is tied to this kind of massive Cloud operation environments so there's a lot of carbon emissions etc etc energy dependencies I can't really go into that but that's also a very important aspect of that so if we go back to this Janus head
(45:49) problem then one would start to have to think about also to untrain oneself from this system of multiple extortion and extraction which would mean to activate so to speak the other perspective of the whole jainus system which indicates transition as I said in the beginning it indicates transition from one system into another and why should one not try to decide to transition away from this perspective which looks onto a past made of stolen data because we I so we all know and I've hinted at it many times already that
(46:40) most of the data that are used for these kinds of operation are basically hijacked you know they are basically kidnapped from the web through big scraping operations and so basically this these whole operations rest on a lot of unpaid labor which is appropriated and privatized in some kind of prime module accumulation kind of move and this is also what generates a lot of the recent backlashes against so-called AI art you know there's many artists who have said oh my God my work was stolen my style was appropriated I'm not getting paid for it
(47:25) we have to stop it and this is completely understandable that it this would be the gut reaction against this kind of appropriation structural appropriation attempt that's going on in in this activity of training data for for all these models it would be to demand individual recompensation or to implement opt-in or out buttons from these training activities which already have been implemented well I think maybe that's a good first step very good first step but maybe not enough because there's also an argument
(48:06) to be made for data to be in the public domain right not protected by individual copyright if we think for example of photographs of looted archaeological artifacts you know from Mesopotamia or anywhere the copyright usually resides with the same museums that have stolen so do should we have to respect this kind of copyright shouldn't these data really rather have to be in some kind of public domain what is the line what is the balance between these two aspects and one very simple or not simple but obvious solution would be to start

## 数据共享机制的倡议
(48:52) basically recognizing that there is a comment within the mean so to speak because the comments or some kind of formal comments forms the hidden base of any stolen data set and one possible step to sort of start articulating or even solving this problem would be to redefine both of these scrape data collection but also all the models trained on them as something which are in fact data Commons what is the data Commons it's basically a collection of data which is [Music] organized and administrated by you know Common owners of this database this is a
(49:41) this is a definition from a book called platform socialism about what data comments are and those data comments would also need to include Provisions that you know use such of any kind of these models would need to be recompensated not only on an individual base but also on a communal base and that such compilations would be so to speak a jointly managed resource and this could be so to speak a first step to recover the commons from within the means the mean modes of production in which they are administrated right now

## 结语与呼吁
(50:24) and I was just imagining you know for every prompt render that people generate now and there's a lot a lot of them I think it costs like a hundred thousand dollars a day just to answer all the queries of Dao e so if a fraction of a cent you know for every one of these queries would go into this kind of peer-to-peer system um of a communal database then one could think about peer-to-peer art funding or other sorts of you know attempts to benefit a common art ecosystem in a completely different way so basically there are two options in


(51:15) the JNS head model the one is to remain stuck within a monopolist idea of a future in which there are proprietary pipelines expropriated data and massive global inequality for click workers but the upside on this is that you get you know free renderings or fluffy robots on horsebacks on the other hand or on the other head rather you could also opt for a period of resilient small Tech with minimum viable configurations powered by renewable energies which does not require sift and extraction exploitation energy waste and overall mean modes of
(52:08) production and one could also try to untrain oneself from all this beliefs about the inevitability of technological progress about nicely aligned agis and automated performance art by deliberately unhinged chatbots and why should you really want to opt for this solution because the best thing is about it is that you will not be required to lose your hair thank you [Applause] thank you I can crawl I can crawl it's fine I can
(53:27) make some exercise it's all right thank you so much for your I'm here it's dark and I'm crawling to make some exercise some not so digital machine learning exercise but uh thank you so much for the talk and for all your work but you mentioned uh Janice and you talk about these two faces and one of the very famous prayers for jainus is to keep track of time to keep Thai and emotion and keep time secure and in the same way that you talk about this enjoyment and all these images coming together or being molded together it's almost as all these times
(54:09) are coming together and being joined together in some way so if you could comment upon this a very complicated consolation between what is at the same time What can be seen as the end of culturality and end of this out of joint of time with this almost miraculous Fusion of time in the context where you know it all seems as magic but it's been used for for profit and for everything that causality build in place maybe I'll just use this in the meantime thanks a lot for the question okay um yeah well I mean you gave the answer
(54:54) already thanks for that maybe I can expand just a little on that um of course anything that's being trained is trained on past data which means that we have a preponderance of past in all these data and the interesting thing is that now it will require a huge effort to keep these things updated the models so for example if you want to integrate something like gpt4 into search it means that the model has to be retrained constantly in a real-time way which means that you know it will require a huge amount of energy
(55:35) also just to keep the database to the to the point in time of yesterday right and so basically this updating will be one of the very interesting problems happening and I'm sure it can be soft somehow but on the other hand why that's really the question I mean why do we why does anyone need to make all this effort and basically waste of energy in order to serve me up with the address of a fictional restaurant if I want to go out and eat somewhere you know I mean you really ask yourself what's the point what are we updating to actually what is
(56:20) it what's the benefit hello um hi so I the question that was forming while you were talking was is there is there a better way I guess when you're talking about sort of the physics of all these things that are exploitative and Etc so then you kind of answered it which was this um more democratically organized participatory AI model and my question now is I hear that sort of solution offered with things like web3 as an example without going off the rails but of course then with web3 there's all of these issues and further physics of that but
(57:12) the promise there is you will be liberated from web 2 and you'll have more control Etc so you're sort of offering a similar idea with this Democratic data set which I think is a great idea but do you foresee problems with that and as a follow-up is there something that I can do today to sort of move towards a democratically participatory AI model it's a really great question yeah I mean this this is something that also occurred to me that basically these prompt renderings or statistical renderings in this year are the equivalent of nfts
(57:51) in 2021 first by the amount of well excitement or hysteria they generate but also because both are onboarding tools into technological environments so basically nfts were things that taught people about you know crypto mechanics about wallets about exchanges etc etc and similarly The Prompt renderings are teaching people about you know the the whole terminology of machine learning and how to use these things and how to get used for them to them etc etc and also it seems to me pretty remarkable how very quickly one
(58:35) web3 which was based on crypto has been sort of replaced with a web3 that is based on machine learning applications such as GPT uh three four whatever so there has been this very very quick turnover where one you know stale promise is immediately replaced with tomorrow's still promise so to speak um yes but both point to a problem which is completely irresolved and which I think is like the heart of all of them is the idea to automate basically the question of how do people live together you know how do they share resources how
(59:18) do they make up their minds how do they make decisions and both are attempts to sort of automate this problem and to come up with basically well automated solutions to them technological solutions but this this question cannot be automated because it's fundamentally about how humans you know deal with one another this is nothing a machine can really do on their behalf because it's just so tricky and so awful and such an intractable problem right how to you know even share the smallest common property let alone the state the welfare
(1:00:00) system or whatever no so basically the this is the irresolved question and this is why it keeps come coming up back again and it's being processed so to speak and you know given new technological um disguisements but the question as such doesn't change and the fact that it won't be solved by technology doesn't change either just come down to the mics I think we have time for maybe two more questions um I just have a quick question uh having found yourself on a variety of these engines and lists that you kind of
(1:00:57) showed us today is there anything that you're doing on an individual level to increase your privacy or your security that maybe we could imply it's too late too late for that [Laughter] on social media for many years that could help but also it's too late for that so yeah maybe already think now about the next problem and try to solve that that that's gone yeah hi thanks for the great talk um I'm wondering if there's anything for the AI research community that can do right now to help Elevate some of these societal challenges that we're seeing
(1:01:54) you mean this AI going to help Society no no the research part like uh research yes of course I mean absolutely you know the AI discourse of machine learning discourse is so much uh steeped into stereotypes and mythology you know mainly mythology it's all about this old Frankenstein Story the robots that are going to take over etc etc and just to debunk that and make it more Technical and actually material and real I think that's really really important right to to try to show the things that are really happening while people are
(1:02:38) talking about the robot apocalypse I just was on the west coast few weeks ago and was so also because I haven't been there since the pandemic I was so surprised to see so many of the downtowns there empty and well disrupted in a very very real sense of the world would so this is basically what's happening as a real world consequence of technological disruption on a lot of different layers that basically the physical material environment Urban fabric of many people is changing as we speak right and I think it's way more
(1:03:23) interesting to focus on these real world effects you know than to sort of keep talking about yeah I mean there is a novelty about what's happening that's undeniable there is a sort of almost um there's a very very distinct shift happening nowadays but it would be very important to spell it out its real consequences and not you know the mythological um ramifications of it anyone have one there's a gentleman over there hi thank you for the great Symposium and I just wonder I just went to the museum Museum of Modern Art like last week and
(1:04:18) so the inados unsupervised and uh I think it's really good show and I really like the visual like narrative and it's really attractive but compared to your work to the inados anados show um I think the his work is like the the context is the empty I I didn't I couldn't like recognize any kind of the context from his work but your work has some meaning and the um I think the meaning is more important for the most of the artworks so I just wonder like how do you think about anados work sorry that that's too difficult you have
(1:05:04) to ask my AGI version you know once I've been automated just ask it just ask it this kind of really difficult question I cannot comment on my colleague's work really that's not that's not possible hello I feel like AI there's a lot of pessimism going on I was wondering if there's any in a you know in in 10 years we see like oh there can be a lot of bad things happening do you have a optimistic view in 10 years of how AI can actually help well I don't but I mean undeniably there's a lot of things that you know um machine learning can do for example
(1:05:49) it's very good at pattern recognition it's very good at diagnosing you know certain or let's say interpreting for example radiological findings for example right or solving a lot of computational tasks that were previously just too too render intensive to solve so there is some benefit right to machine learning in many ways is maybe just really not on the level of these unhinged chat Bots you know that we are being you know fed for entertainment basically I think that's all the time we have for questions so I just want to thank uh
(1:06:36) hito again for her brilliant and insightful talk thank you


是的，AI生成的图像往往参考了与弱势群体和犯罪标记相关的人群。
这种现象来源于AI训练数据集中的固有偏见。正如Hito Steyerl在演讲中指出，AI生成的图像是通过从互联网上收集大量图像并“平均化”后得出的，反映了社会偏见、统计学中的历史问题以及现有的歧视性社会结构。例如，AI在面部识别和种族分类中的应用可能进一步强化和复制种族偏见，从而带来系统性的歧视和不公平。这些问题与AI模型的训练机制、背后的数据集以及标记劳动的剥削性本质直接相关。

为什么说 AI 训练数据集中如何带有偏见?


AI训练数据集带有偏见的原因包括：

1. **训练模型的数据来源可能包含偏见**：图中展示的是RFW（Racial Faces in the Wild）数据库的样本，按种族分类为Caucasian、Indian、Asian、African，聚焦于统计学意义上的“平均面孔”。训练数据的收集依赖互联网抓取和已标记的数据集，而这些数据来源本身可能反映了社会中的隐性或显性偏见。

2. **数据标注承载社会偏见**：数据标注的方式可能带有社会预设的种族、文化或性别标签。例如，高加索人（Caucasian）可能被过度代表，而其他人种的数据相对较少，这种不平衡性会导致模型更倾向于训练集中的主流类别。

3. **偏向于平均化或规范化的倾向**：图中最后列展示的平均面孔显示了一种统计上的“中间值”代表性，但这种归纳忽略了个体差异，或强化了特定群体在其他群体中的“异类”化。

4. **社会和历史因素的映射**：统计分类在历史上与科学种族主义和优生学等概念紧密相关（如Francis Goten的合成照片），这些历史背景可能无意中延续到现代AI模型中，影响其应用，例如种族面部分类。

因此，AI训练数据集和模型的偏差不仅源于技术层面，也深刻受到社会、历史及文化因素的制约。
