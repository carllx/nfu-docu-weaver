(-- `Descartes’ Method (Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy)` [stanford](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/descartes-method/))

The text is about Descartes’ method of science, which he explains in his work called the Rules. Descartes defines science as a kind of knowledge that is certain and clear, and he rejects any knowledge that is doubtful or probable. He also says that all sciences are connected and should be learned by using one method. The text focuses on two parts of this method: intuition and deduction. Intuition is when we understand something clearly and easily, without any doubt. For example, we can intuit that we exist, that we think, or that a triangle has three sides. Deduction is when we use logical reasoning to draw conclusions from what we have intuited. For example, we can deduce that the sum of the angles of a triangle is 180 degrees, or that God exists, from what we have intuited. Descartes thinks that intuition and deduction are the only ways to achieve certain and evident knowledge, and he uses them to build his system of science.

['这段文字是关于 Descartes 的科学方法的，他在他的作品"Rules(规则)"中解释了这种方法。', '笛卡尔将科学定义为一种确定而清晰的knowledge，他拒绝任何有疑问或可能的知识。', '他还说，所有的科学都是相通的，应该用一种方法来学习。', '文中重点介绍了这种方法的两个部分：直觉和演绎。', '直觉是指我们清楚而容易地理解某事，没有任何疑问。', '例如，我们可以直觉到我们的存在，我们的思维，或者一个三角形有三条边。', '演绎是指我们使用逻辑推理，从我们的直觉中得出结论。', '例如，我们可以从我们的直觉中推断出一个三角形的角度之和是180度，或者上帝存在。', '笛卡尔认为，直觉和演绎是获得确定和明显的知识的唯一途径，他用它们来建立他的科学体系']


René Descartes was a French philosopher and mathematician who is known as the father of modern philosophy. He developed a method of rational inquiry based on clear and distinct ideas that could be deduced from self-evident principles[1](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Rene-Descartes).

According to Descartes, nature is a broad term that can refer to different kinds of things. He divides the simple natures into three classes: intellectual, material, and common[2](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/descartes-method/).

-   Intellectual natures are the objects of the mind, such as knowledge, doubt, ignorance, volition, etc.
-   Material natures are the properties of extended things, such as extension, shape, motion, etc.
-   Common natures are the universal attributes of all things, such as existence, unity, duration, etc.

Descartes also uses the term nature to refer to the essence or nature of a thing, which is what makes it what it is. For example, the nature of a body is extension, the nature of a mind is thought, and the nature of God is perfection[3](https://libquotes.com/ren%C3%A9-descartes/quotes/nature).

Descartes also uses the term nature to refer to the laws or principles that govern the natural world, which he believes are established by God and can be discovered by human reason. For example, he argues that the nature of light is to move in straight lines, and the nature of matter is to conserve its quantity of motion[2](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/descartes-method/).
