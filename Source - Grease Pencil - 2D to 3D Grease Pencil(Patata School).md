## 1_00 Welcome!
------------------------
Welcome to 2D to 3D grease pencil in blender
This course is so special
We are for the first time exploring grease pencil design pattada School
Gris pencil is a set of tools that will allow you to make 2D animation inside Blender
These 2D animations can be played on the fly
can be incorporated with your 3D work
and can be animated frame by frame
The potential of grease pencil in Blender hasn't been fully explored
and that's what we are inviting you to do here
We're giving you a main example
We're gonna teach you how​‌​‌​​‌‌​​‌‌​​‌‌‌​‌‌​​‌‌​‌​‌​​‌‌​​‌‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌‌​‌‌​​‌‌​​‌‌​​‌‌​‌​‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌​‌‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌‌​​‌‌​‌​‌‌‌​‌​‌​‌​​‌‌‌‌‌‌​​‌‌​​​‌​​‌‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌​‌​‌​​‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌​‌​‌​​‌‌​‌‌‌​​‌‌‌​​‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌​​​‌‌‌​‌‌​​‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌‌​​‌‌​​‌‌​​‌‌‌​‌‌​​‌‌​​‌‌​​‌‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌‌​​‌​​‌‌​​​‌​​‌‌​‌​‌​​‌‌‌‌‌‌​​‌‌‌‌‌‌​​‌‌‌‌‌‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌‌​​‌‌‌​‌​‌‌‌​​‌‌‌​‌‌​​‌‌‌‌‌​​​‌‌​​‌‌​​‌‌‌​​‌​​‌‌​​​‌​​‌‌‌​​‌​​‌‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌​‌‌‌​​‌‌‌‌‌​​​‌‌​‌‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌​‌​‌‌‌​‌‌​‌‌​​‌‌​‌​‌​​‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌​‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌​‌‌​​​‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌​​‌‌​‌​‌‌‌​‌​​​‌​​‌‌​‌‌‌‌‌​‌​‌​‌​​‌‌​‌​‌​​‌‌​‌​‌‌‌​‌‌​​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌‌​​‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌​​‌‌‌​​‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌​‌‌​​​‌‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌​‌‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌‌​​‌‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌‌​​‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌​​‌‌‌‌‌‌​​‌‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌​‌​‌‌‌​‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌​​‌‌​​‌‌​​‌‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌​​​‌‌‌‌‌​​​‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌​​‌​​‌‌​‌​‌‌‌​‌​‌‌‌​​‌‌​‌‌​​​‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌​‌‌‌​​‌‌‌‌‌​​​‌‌​‌​‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌‌​​‌‌‌​‌​‌‌‌‌‌​‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌‌​​‌‌‌‌‌‌​​‌‌​‌‌‌​​‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌‌​​‌​​‌‌​​‌‌​​‌‌‌​​‌​​‌‌‌​​‌​​‌‌​‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌ to use Crest pencil
and then we're gonna give you three examples coming from work from members of atata school
having three different styles that have been translated into 3D means that you're gon na have the opportunity to understand what is behind a 3D translation
Which elements are we still going to have in 2D using this pencil
Which elements are we completely going to move into the 3D world
We're very proud of this course and we think it gives an opportunity like no other for 2D illustrators to get into the 3D world
There is no longer need to be scared about jumping into the 3D world
All the things you love
like frame by frame animation or onion skin can be used now inside of Blender
Once you learn how to use grease pencil
it's going to feel so natural to be drawing inside a 3D program
In this course
we're going to blur the borders between what is 2D and what is 3D
In the main part of this course
we're going to be looking at how to model this little dog inspired by our own dog Mickey
We're going to be modeling the main part in 3D and then make in so many different element like the plants in which we are going to keep the 2D feeling of the illustration
but adding animation at the same time
Then we're going to move into the examples
In the first example from Noah
we're going to keep the 2D feeling on the illustration
but at the same time
we're going to teach you how you can read cars that look like 2D cars
but actually can be looked at from any angle
Next
we're going to look at Rose's illustration
In this case
the main part is moving into the 3D world
but we are keeping so many different elements in 2D
the little accents
the small
We think this style hasn't been explored enough
In the third illustration from Natalia
we're going to be looking at how to translate a more complex illustration into a 3 D1 that is still is retaining so many of the elements from the 2D
we're going to be adding the shadows using grease pencil
The cable from the phone is going to be made using grease pencil and also the text that was in the original illustration
All of the examples are done using Eev
That means that we can play with them live
We're not going to have to be waiting for any random times
We are very excited to see how many people will incorporate all of this knowledge into their professional practices
So please jump into this course and don't forget to bring your own illustrations with you



## 1_01 Introduction to Grease Pencil
------------------------
Welcome back to grease pencil time
Yeahgrease pencil is so exciting
Grease pencil is amazing re-standing it was something that I had seen people use around
but I was like
ohsounds so difficult
but actually it's not that difficult
Let's kind of I'm going to get rid of the plane of the background for a second and I'm going to get rid of that reference just so we can see what's happening with wrist
So I'm gonna be looking at it from the front
I have my doggie there and I'm gon na add and you see here with grease pencil
Here you are
we have a few different ones
we have blank stroke monkey C
an art collection
and art and object line art
We're going to cover them all at some point or another
but for now
the one we're going use the most is blank
So blank is gonna add a grease pencil object to the scene with nothing applied
So when I added the blank there
my grease pencil is called G pencil
I'm going to have to decide where I'm going to draw
For now
let's imagine that we're going to draw one of our plants
So I'm going to say plant one
So I have my plant one that is going to be my grease pencil
and grease pencil has materials
but they look a bit different
You see
as soon as we generate a grease pencil
it comes with a material called black
So we already know that we're going to be using the color black and it has activated stroke
but not fill
So in order to paint in grease pencil
right now we are not in painting mode
we're gon na have to
we could do it just by going here and selecting drill mode
but there is an especially select a created tab that Blender has done for us for grease pencil
but it's hidden
You need to go here in plus to the animation and add that to the animation tab
And as soon as you do it
you are back in this 2D animation and you see that we are there into the animation and one of the things I don't like is that the 2D animation puts the lighting from the same world
I'm going to deactivate it
I'm going to put the lighting that we had before
I love this warm lighting
I love how it looks when I rotate it
so it looks like it's similar to the other one
and I like it because kind of we're having parallelisms between the two worlds
Now we're going to press the Y because we're looking at the world from the from the front
and you see that I have my deep plant selected
I have a pencil there
suggest I'm painting on that layer
and let's see what things that we have in here
If we click here
we have different types of brushes
we have airbrushed ink pen
different ink pens
We're going to be providing as well different brushes
But this one's I having enough with them
It's amazing how much you can do with them
Let's see what happens if I paint
So I'm gon na
just go around with this one already I have painted something in the air
which is pretty amazing and not only I painted something in the air happens in something in the air that has a bit of a 3D nest to it
Like you see
like when I look at it from the side
it's still having a bit of volume
And what I painted here
the cool thing is that it can be modified
it's a bit confusing because Greece
Spencerpeople think that it's Photoshop
but in reality that it's something a bit more like Illustrator
So we change now front rower mode to
for example
sculpt mode
We have a new different mode in which I'm not assuming that you can see that there is a line that is defined in this entire shape and actually that line is made of little points
We'll see it later
But for example
I have in my sculpt bolt smoothen
and if I smooth
let's see what happens when I smooth it out
my entire shape now gets smoother
you see it's getting smooth
or I can pinch it
I can just select my radius and I can modify and modify my shape
I can make even do it in 3D
so now I'm painting in 3D
this is crazy that you can do this
not only that
you can do it like that
you can do frame by frame animation with a 3D shape
floating in the air
absolutely bonkers when I discovered I was like
ohmy goodness
this is just the best thing ever
and if I go to edit mode
you can see the reality of it all
you can select some of this and you can see that in reality
this shape is made of these little tiny points that are all connected to one another and the fact that these little tiny points are there has many advantages
for example
I can select these points and I can go here to my radius and I can change the radius of my points to make them bigger
and you see that now there's no gradient between them
but today we learned another tool we learned this proportional editing tool
So now if I do that now I can make a change with the shape of my mouse and I can make it to grow in one area
I get thinner or another amazingly cool this as well
so you can really make lines
you were saying
ohthere'll be more brushes
but you can
but this you already got enough
you can do
yeahthere are all the brushes I'm gonna go back to the draw mode
and I'm gonna
for example
use this airbrus I love this one
it's generating this cloud in the air that it kind of works in 3D
you see it is a cloud that is all shaped in 3D
and again
thisthis cloud can be modified
you can smooth it out with my with this shape
I can pinch it
you know
can pinch this cloud in 3D and move it
and it all continues being in 3D with me
so just amazing stuff
we're going to be discovering so many techniques
we were saying as we were saying when we saw spider-man the amount of stuff
they had done with this was amazing
Ohsorry
I deleted everything
I didn't want to
I just want go
I wanted to go to sculp mode and use the eraser
so I'm gonna make it very big and just erase everything I made
Okay
so should we check
how do we do to draw one of the plants
we are going to activate my empty object and now sometimes I don't know why
sometimes I generate
I have some problems with the original materials that come here
sometimes I delete them and I start again when I'm generating my own material
And you need to understand one thing is the material
another thing is the drawing pen you're using
In reality I've been discovering that this pen is defining how those dots are being drawn
so some dots are being bigger and smaller
so in order to generate this irregularity
the program is generating bigger and smaller dots
but the color of those dots is dictated by the material
Right now we don't have any material
so it's completely white
But if I go here and I'm going to try to draw
for example
this plant
so in order to draw this plant I'm going to generate a new material
the first thing I'm going to do I want to make a material that is only stroke
So the two types of materials
filled materials and stroke materials
So the stroke material is the one like we use in Photoshop that generates a stroke
And I'm going to just draw next to it
I'm going to draw it there and I'm gon na have something that looks a bit like that plant is not very good
I'm gon na be trying to be a bit more smooth
Keep in mind I'm using my mouse
we have a tablet
but I want people to know that this can be done with the mouse
By the way
where I'm drawing is dictated here
right now I'm drawing at the stroke origin and I'm looking at it from the front view
And I like that because now drawing this origin
we're going to be looking at more modes
but for now
this is good
So now that we learned that we make that shape
that's good
and now we're going to go into my edit mode and I'm going to select the points at the very top and we have the proportional editing and I'm going to scale them down
And Amm going to make this a bit smaller
and I'm going to scale them down
okaylike that
or maybe a bit bigger
And I'm going to select the points on the bottom
and I'm going to scale them up
It's great as well
if you're using your mouse with the sculpting tool because if you do draw a little bit more jaggedy
you can just smooth it out quite easily
YeahI love this
the sculpting tool like that to use it for that
So now I'm going to make the lines that are coming here for the plants
So I'm going to go back to my draw mode
I'm going to go to my paint and I'm going to make one line there
another line there
and another line there
And if you're finding this confusing
I mean
I have both objects here together
I can move this one a bit to the left
but you can see now that I have my shape that is having dots and it's kind of imitating that we can make our own version
But like for now
this is good
The thing that we are doing now
we're going to make these shapes and these shapes
I'm gon na make them in another layer
So if we go here to see that this looks a bit like a spaghetti
this is the first layer
so I'm going to say that this is my plant
my plant strokes
So my plant strokes are there
I can activate them or deactivate them
And I'm going to make a new layer
And now it's going to be my leaves
So now in my leaves I'm going to use a different material
So instead of using this material for my leaves I'm going to use a new material up
I'm gonna use a new material I'm gonna apply new and instead of a stroke I'm going to use a fill
And my field is going to be this color
Okay
so this now when I go to draw
everything looks the same
I'm using the same ink
then graph
then look at what happens when I draw one of these circles
I can draw like that and now I draw
yeahand it's filling it in itself
Yeahwe can
by the way
activated so it has a stroke and feel at the same time
That's possible as well
So now I'm gon na do something that feels and that's a stroke outside
and that's quite nice because I can draw like that
draw like that and draw like that
and the reason why I'm making two layers
look what's happening now
You see that this is strokes
Here are on front
but here actually these materials in front
So I can go here and I can put my leaves
move them under my stroke
and I have the order I wanted
Perfectas simple as that
Okaynow that we are there
we can just go and generate the rest of the plants
So we make this one on the left
Okay
so for this plant on the left
we're gonna make
rememberwe're working every time with a new grease Sten
new propenal blank gon na
call it G 2
And I feel like now you're kind of really getting what this entire thing is about
you know
like I'm going to deactivate my dog and I
instead of working up
I forgot to put my little cylinder in there instead of working there so far away because my dog is in the middle
I can be working from the origin
So sometimes it's good to work from the origin and I'm gon na deactivate my plant
One plan 2 is here
and I'm going to be even more from the origin
Okay
plan 2
And now I'm going to go to my Chr mode
You can imagine now what's going to be stroke and what's going to be filled when it's there
I got go and just do my
I can do a stroke and feel if we wanted to have this effect
but actually I'm not gonna do that and I'm gonna show people a really cool thing that it's much better for making these weekly edges
So I'm going to only use fill for this material
I'm going to make it
I could call this material if I want some green material makes sense
and also you can name these layers
it just called GP layers can be plant main layer
you know like the more if you're someone that really likes putting names on things
just go for it
Okay
and now I'm gonna draw the shape of these plants are gon na go there
I'm drawing with my mouse
so it is not really easy to draw this
but luckily we have all the sculpting tools that are going to help us later
so I have that there
It wasn't that bad
you know
like for being done without a graphics tablet
that's not that bad
But remember
if we select the plant and we go to sculpt mode
we have the smooth and we can now smooth it all out
smooth and smooth and smooth
and I love this this thing for smoothing it and we can just move it as well if those two are touching Tomas together
Okaythat's looking quite good.

### Modifier Effect
And I was saying to people that we don't need to use the stroke with the wiggling because
you know
this can animate and I don't want to be animating the wiggle every single time of having to make a million drawings
And you see here we have a new thing that's called visual effect properties
This only appears on the grease pencil
And also we have the modifiers are modifiers we use all the time
Nowbecause they are dynamic
they are completely different depending on what we are doing
So in order to apply the effects
one of the things we need to make sure is that they only apply on the viewport
Shading is the most advanced of them
And right now we went back to this ugly lighting because the program is using our scene lights and the world
but we don't want that
We just using the HD R S from from the program
And let's for example
add the Pixel 8 effect and now when we add it and we change the size of the pixels
we see that now we made this pixelated effect in our drawing
I don't know in which cases
but it might be that someone wants to use grease pencil to create something that looks like an old video game
And if you​‌​‌​​‌‌​​‌‌​​‌‌‌​‌‌​​‌‌​‌​‌​​‌‌​​‌‌​​‌‌​‌‌‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌​‌​‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌​‌‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌‌​​‌‌​‌​‌‌‌​‌​‌​‌​​‌‌‌‌‌‌​​‌‌​​​‌​​‌‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌‌​​‌​​‌‌‌‌‌‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌​‌​‌​​‌‌​‌‌‌​​‌‌‌​​‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌​​​‌‌‌​‌‌​​‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌‌​​‌‌​​‌‌​​‌‌‌​‌‌​​‌‌​​‌‌​​‌‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌‌​​‌​​‌‌​‌‌​​​‌‌​‌​‌​​‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌​‌‌‌​​‌‌‌‌‌‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌‌​​‌‌‌​‌​‌‌‌​​‌‌​‌‌​​​‌‌‌​​‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌​​‌‌​‌​‌​​‌‌​​​‌​​‌‌‌​​‌​​‌‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌​‌‌‌​​‌‌‌‌‌​​​‌‌​‌‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌​‌​‌‌‌​‌​‌‌‌​​‌‌​‌​‌​​‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌​‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌​‌‌​​​‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌‌​​‌​​‌‌​‌​‌‌‌​‌​‌‌​​​‌‌​‌‌‌‌‌​‌​‌​‌​​‌‌​‌​‌​​‌‌​‌​‌‌‌​‌‌​​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌‌​​‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌​​‌‌‌​​‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌​‌‌​​​‌‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌​‌‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌​‌​‌‌‌​‌​‌​‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌​​‌‌‌‌‌‌​​‌‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌​‌​‌‌‌​‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌​​​‌‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌​​‌‌‌​​‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌​​​‌‌‌‌‌​​​‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌​​‌​​‌‌​‌​‌‌‌​‌​‌‌‌​​‌‌​‌‌​​​‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌​‌‌‌​​‌‌‌‌‌​​​‌‌​‌​‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌‌​​‌‌‌​‌​‌‌‌‌‌​‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌‌​​‌‌‌‌‌‌​​‌‌​‌‌‌​​‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌‌​​‌​​‌‌​​‌‌​​‌‌‌​​‌​​‌‌‌​​‌​​‌‌​‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌ deactivate in the end
alyzed suddenly look at that
you are making a 3D kind of shape that is pixelated
It's really cool as you move around
And I guess you can animate with this as well
Yeahyou can completely animate with this
You could have another effect
For example
you could have this wave distortion and this wave distortion
you can change the amplitude
you can change the period to make it longer
you could as well change the face
So you could put some keyframes on this and make it look like a plant under the sea
The one I'm going to use actually is a modifier
so the modifiers are dynamic
so they change depending on the object we have
and here we have the modifiers that can be applied to grease pencil
and I love this one
the noise modifier
If we change the position
we change the amount to that
but then we can change the
I think it's the
let me see with the thickness strength noise scale here we are if we change the noise scale and we make it quite high
and now we make the position a bit smaller
look what we made
we made something that looks like those squiggles
especially when you look at it from from the distance
But now here in randomized
you see there is step 4
so we are making it so it changes every four steps
so we can make a step 1
So now every keyframe we move is changing
but I love that you can make for example
every five frames
So now when I play
is doing that brilliant without you having to do it
You every time It looks as if someone drew many
many times
but I didn't
Okaythat effect looks fantastic
Let's make sure that we are back in the frame 1 because that's gonna be very important when then we start learning of our animation
And now let's go back to my plane
Noto my plane
sorryto my reference
And now we're going to draw these lines there
So super simple to draw those lines
Basically what we did before
we're going to go make a new layer
plant strokes
We know that we want them in at the front of our shape
so they are there
and now we're going to add a new material
And we can just call this
I don't know
dark green
for example
dark green
And now this dark green is only going to have a stroke
We're gon na select the color of the dark
Did I select the color
I can zoom in a tiny bit more just to make sure that I selected that one
Perfectand I'm going to go here to the front
I'm just going to go to my draw mode and just draw those lines
So I'm going to draw one there
That might be a bit too thick
so I'm going to change the radius there
perfect
I'm going to do one there
one there
and one there
And you see what's happening
This squiggle
this effector I'm applying is applying as well to these lines
so I can just make them a tiny bit accentuated
But it's really cool because all of these lines inside these are getting that animation effect
Okay
that's looking quite good to me
That's looking fantastic
Obviouslywe now need to do every single of the plant
and I don't want to be boring people with making the plant
so I'm going to draw them all and we're going to meet when all the plants are drawn
And then we're going to be checking how to arrange them
Because remember that these now are 3D objects
We can move them around the scene and situate them so we get the effect that and in the next lesson as well as showing you how to we are arranging everything
we're gon na see how to animate it because animating it is a and animations we're going to use as well for the mouth of our Carter
So there's a lot of stuff coming
so be ready for the next lesson
Okaysee you
see you there



## 3_01 Introduction to Grease Pencil
------------------------
Hello Katie
Hello
Welcome to our course 2 D2 3D using grease pencil in blender
And here we have the final result of what we are going to be making today
And not only that looks already quite cool
but also we're gon na see how to animate it
And another cool thing we have here
you can see that Blender is working completely live
We are rendering quite a really nice render using Eev
We can modify the elements completely live without having to wait for render time
And that's something that I find very exciting
somewhat like working on a video game
need to be waiting for the render to happen
We've been really excited about Chris Pencil for a long time now
actually
We've seen a few other artists doing different types of things with it
But this mixing 3D and 2D is something that we've really wanted to get into
Yeahrecently we went to the cinema to see spider-man across the spider-verse and they used themselves Gree Pencil
Many artists work there with Blender and gree pencil
and it's amazing how they were mixing 3D stuff
but then adding little details that were suggesting or making references to the original comic
Yeahactually
whilst we were watching it
I didn't know that they were using Blender and grease pencil
and I was watching it thinking
how are they making this beautiful style
Because yeah
like you're saying
they had the definition of the characters jaw lines or cheekbones
And so you could see really clearly the 2D star
But as they turned
you have the three DS
So that's just one rendering of grease pencil
And this is all part of a wider thing that we are doing right now in Pattaya school
which is exploring how we can get sketches and people's ideas into the 3D world
We want to expand how the 3D world looks
And we think for that
we're going to have to discover new techniques
And Grease pencil is a perfect one for that
So we can see here the original illustration that was drawn for this course and this illustration has a few details
It's very simple
there are not that many colors and the shapes are quite simple
There are things that we wanted to translate into the 3D world
One of them is the brush that was used
This was drawn by k．t
using Procreate
so it was done with an ipad
but it could have been done in Photoshop or whatever other program
but then you have all these kind of nice
how would you say it's kind of a cryon or I don't know
what's the effect
Yeahsort of charcoal is soft edge like that
I mean
in reality
you also could have done it on pencil and paper
Yeahthat's really what this is imitating in the end
but we have all of these brush packs also available in Pattaya school
actually
Yeah
and this entire illustration is inspired by our dog Mickey
We recently acquired a dog variant
and I think that this is another reference or another
the idea for people
just try to look for something in your life that is important to you in the moment and try to illustrate that because we are going to put more love and care
Right now
we're thinking a lot about our dog behind us right now
So we are making drawings about our dog
but just think of what is inspiring you in life and try to go for it in your illustration totally
And the other thing that we had is that we decided that these shapes would be 2D and the dog would be 3D
That's an arbitrary decision
We could have done a different thing
Maybe the dog in 2D and the shapes in 3D
depending on what we do
that's going to be a different translation because the dog
for example
in 3D
we are not going to be able to make this beautiful curved lines that are showing a bit
You know
this is representing hair and are showing a bit of behind the background
So we're have thinking about how those things translate
but the final result that we achieve is going to depend on what you want you can decide you can start with your own illustration and follow it maybe to turn your own dog or if you love cats or whatever pets
make a few plans and then follow the tutorial
We recommend following the tutorial by doing your own thing
I think that especially for people doing this course
we recommend if you've never done a course in Blender before
we have an entire introduction to Blender
so go for that you're gon na deduce the program and when you get to th​‌​‌​​‌‌​​‌‌​​‌‌‌​‌‌​​‌‌​‌​‌​​‌‌​​‌‌​​‌‌​​​‌​​‌‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌‌​​‌​​‌‌​​‌‌​​‌‌​‌​‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌​‌‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌‌​​‌‌​‌‌‌​​‌‌​‌​‌​​‌‌‌‌‌‌​​‌‌​​​‌​​‌‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌‌​​‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌‌​​‌‌‌​‌​‌​‌​​‌‌​‌‌‌​​‌‌‌​​‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌​​​‌‌‌​‌‌​​‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌‌​​‌‌‌​‌‌​​‌‌‌​‌‌​​‌‌​​‌‌​​‌‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌‌​​‌​​‌‌​‌​‌​​‌‌​‌​‌​​‌‌‌‌‌‌​​‌‌‌‌‌‌​​‌‌‌‌‌‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌‌​​‌‌‌​‌​‌‌‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌​​‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌​​‌‌​‌​‌‌‌​‌​​​‌​​‌‌‌​​‌​​‌‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌​‌‌‌​​‌‌‌‌‌​​​‌‌​‌‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌​‌​‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌​‌​‌​​‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌​‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌​‌‌​​​‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌​‌​‌‌‌​‌​‌‌‌​​‌‌​‌‌‌‌‌​‌​‌​‌​​‌‌​‌​‌​​‌‌​‌​‌‌‌​‌‌​​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌‌​​‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌​​‌‌‌​​‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌​‌‌​​​‌‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌​‌‌‌‌‌​‌​​​‌​​‌‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌​‌​‌‌‌​‌‌​‌‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌​​‌‌​‌​‌​​‌‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌​‌​‌‌‌​‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌​‌‌​​‌‌​​‌‌​​‌‌​​‌‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌​​​‌‌‌‌‌​​​‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌​​‌​​‌‌​‌​‌‌‌​‌​‌‌‌​​‌‌​‌‌​​​‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌​‌‌‌​​‌‌‌‌‌​​​‌‌​‌​‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌‌​​‌‌‌​‌​‌‌‌‌‌​‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌‌​​‌‌‌‌‌‌​​‌‌​‌‌‌​​‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌‌​​‌​​‌‌​​‌‌​​‌‌‌​​‌​​‌‌‌​​‌​​‌‌​‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌is

All right
see you there

## 3_02 Animating with Grease Pencil
------------------------
So after the time lapse in which we do all those plants
let's really organiz​‌​‌​​‌‌​​‌‌​​‌‌‌​‌‌​​‌‌​‌​‌​​‌‌​​‌‌​​‌‌‌‌‌​​​‌‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌​​​‌​​‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌​‌​‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌​‌‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌‌​​‌‌​‌‌‌​​‌‌​‌​‌​​‌‌‌‌‌‌​​‌‌​​​‌​​‌‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌​‌​‌​​‌‌‌‌‌‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌‌​​‌‌‌​‌​‌​‌​​‌‌​‌‌‌​​‌‌‌​​‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌​​​‌‌‌​‌‌​​‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌‌​​‌‌‌​‌‌​​‌‌‌​‌‌​​‌‌​​‌‌​​‌‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌‌​​‌​​‌‌​‌​‌​​‌‌​‌​‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌‌​​‌‌‌​‌​‌‌‌​​‌‌‌​‌‌​​‌‌‌​​‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌​​‌‌‌​‌‌​​‌‌​​​‌​​‌‌‌​​‌​​‌‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌​‌‌‌​​‌‌‌‌‌​​​‌‌​‌‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌​‌​‌‌‌​‌​‌‌‌​​‌‌​‌​‌​​‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌​‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌​‌‌​​​‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌​‌​‌‌‌​‌​‌‌‌‌‌​‌​‌‌‌‌‌​‌​‌​‌​​‌‌​‌​‌​​‌‌​‌​‌‌‌​‌‌​​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌‌​​‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌​​‌‌‌​​‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌​‌‌​​​‌‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌​‌‌‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌​‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌​​‌‌​‌​‌​​‌‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌​‌​‌‌‌​‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌‌​​‌​​‌‌​​‌‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌​​​‌‌‌‌‌​​​‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌​​‌​​‌‌​‌​‌‌‌​‌​‌‌‌​​‌‌​‌‌​​​‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌​‌‌‌​​‌‌‌‌‌​​​‌‌​‌​‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌‌​​‌‌‌​‌​‌‌‌‌‌​‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌‌​​‌‌‌‌‌‌​​‌‌​‌‌‌​​‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌‌​​‌​​‌‌​​‌‌​​‌‌‌​​‌​​‌‌‌​​‌​​‌‌​‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌e them
And this lesson is going to be about how to animate not only those plants
but also the eyes and the mouth of our Carter believe
So I'm gonna select these plants and some of them
the anchor point is gonna be in the correct position
but this one
for example
needs to be a bit more up
Other ones
for example
the anchor point is in the incorrect position
So we just affect only origins and we put this at the very beginning angle
as simple as that
So with the new exclusive of animation
I guess
we are actually not going to animate using that mode
It could
it's possible completely to animate like that
So we could animate a bit of rotation doing this
So we would be moving all the objects at the same time
but we want something a tiny bit more complex
so that's not really giving us what we wanted
Okay
that's good there
and I think this plant
oh no
this one needs to be there
So all the plants now have the anchor points where they should
So now we are going to activate my reference image and let's see where the elements were in the reference image so we can see that this plant was here
we can see that this one
oh I'm going to move it up so it's not intersecting there
This one was a bit behind the Carter
this one was a bit like that
That's looking good there
and now it doesn't need to be exact
but it's good to kind of start putting everything in position
so it looks pretty okay and this one
Ohthis 1 I forgot
I know it's good
this one goes down
okaythat's looking good
that's having enough plants surrounding my car
The only 1 I would put this one a bit on front
I like that it was covering a bit of leg
it's nice to have the surrounding of the character because as well in that if we do that people are really going to see how this all was in 3D
especially when they move
that's going to be very lovely
Okay
so I'm already seeing one little problem is that I have some keyframes that are on the 0．62
that's because I was drawing on the layer 62 and that's very typical
no worries if that happens we're gon na solve that
but it's something that I've done wrong
I think the first plant probably was drawn on the frame one
but these ones were drawn not second
but frame 62 accidentally
so we're gon na solve that in a second
so should we start kind of checking how animation works
Yeah
let's find out
okaywe're gon na go here to 2D animation
that's the way we're going to modify and as I was saying
we don't need 250 frames of animation
Probably something like 100 is going to be enough
And now 100
we can zoom in a tiny bit there
So we go from one to 100 and now I'm gon na
go to frame 1
I'm going to try to move everything I can
I'm gonna select everything in that shape
move it to frame 1
You see that those shapes disappeared because there was nothing on that frame
So that's why it's important to go now to plan for
I'm going to move it to frame 1
Okayso these are all the ones accidentally
okaynice to know you can fix that easily
Yesand it's good
sometimes it can be confusing that
And it's normal because sometimes we are testing the animation and we forget that
So now all my plants are in frame 1
and let's see how we can do animation
So we have a few different ways of animating in grease pencil
One of them is frame by frame animation
so we draw something on the first frame
then we draw on the next one and go frame by frame
So a bit like we would do
for example
in programs like Photoshop or Procreate or Animate
Another way in which we could do it is we could just have two positions and then tell the program to interpolate between them a bit more what we do when we are animating in 3D or for example
how we would do it in After Effects
So we're going to be looking at those both ways of doing it
Now we're going to deactivate
I'm gonna hide everything
I'm gonna go to my frontal view
put a new grease pencil
and I put it here
a blank grease pencil
and let's start understanding how it works
You see here we have the timeline
Make sure you are in this timeline
Exactly this one
That is the one that appears when we have the 2D animation and we have grease pencil selected because it happened to me in the past that I have the normal timeline in layout and that timeline you can not copy and paste grease pencil keyframes
Okay
We want to make sure we're in 2D animation
exactly draw something
I'm going to draw this shape
And if it's not very visible
let's maybe make it so the material of the line of the stroke is white
So I'm going to draw this line
and now I'm going to go to a different frame
And here we have activated
I have activated this because it's convenient to activate my auto key if you don't have it activated
If I draw here now
my drawing got added to the first keyframe
The program is deducing that because I didn't create new keyframes
I just wanted my drawing to be added only to the first one
Actuallythe keyframe get added when I created the grease pencil that twice before I was in frame 60 and it got added to the frame 60
Oh yeah
but now what we're going to do when we have it in this auto key mode
when I go to another frame and I draw the line
for example
I can draw the line here
Now the previous line disappear and there is this connection between the two keyframes
And you see now I go from one to another
So now I could go later and I could make my line to go there
and I could go later and make my line to move there
And now let's see what's happening
Now's starting to generate this animation
Do you see that
Right now I don't have any reference on where my previous line was
If I go
I think another of the modes
if you go here to this viewport shading
you see that we have in green the previous line and in purple
the next line
That is really
really useful because that's going to allow us to know what's happening
And if you want to modify that in audio scaling
here you see that we have the mode keyframes
You can change the opacity of how those lines appears
And you can say how many frames before and after appear
So right now
we only have one frame before and one frame after
but we can do two
So now I actually don't have any more after
I only have one
but now we're getting two levels of green and one of purple
That's great
and anyone who knows about 2D animation will find that super useful
Yeah
we'll be having more courses in 2D animation in the school
but for now
we want you to understand that this is the way in which you would do frame by frame animation inside this program keyframes
by the way
if you don't want them to delay that
you could also copy the keyframe
go here to 26 and paste it
Let me see
copypaste
And now what I did is I went from one keyframe and I copied it in another one
but the keyframe once it's there
we can go to
for example
sculpt mode sculpted
and now what I'm doing is I'm having that keyframe and now it's changing when I have it there
Okayso you can have a very smooth change like that
Yeahand it means that you don't need to draw again
I can just copy this
paste it
copypaste up
copy paste
and now modified
and you can see where the previous one was
and you can animate with the sculpting
You know
it's a way of animating just with the scope
That's a nice way of doing it
Yeah
and this is exactly what we're going to do for the plants
so we're just going to use a scoped mode to generate a bit of a gentle rotation
and then we're going to see how the program can interpolate between these positions
And before we move
let's explain what I mean with interpolate V between these positions
So you see that we have this shape there
and I'm going to copy and paste it because I think people are going to understand it much better like that
and I'm going to put that there
and I'm going to make a new position of this shape I'm gonna put that there
And for interpolation to work well
we need shapes that are similar
So because I'm doing a sculpting
the number of points on the shape are going to be the same
So I have one shape that starts here
another shape that continues there if you want to interpolate between them right now there is none
no interpolation we're going to have to be either
I think it's in way paint mode or in edit mode works as well
But if we not way paint
if I say we paint
I think is in the draw mode
sorryin Dr mode
So in draw mode
when we go here to draw animation
you see that here we have different types of animation
but also we have interpolated sequence
So we need to be in between the two keyframes
It's a bit confusing
You need to be between the two curve frames
We go to draw interpolate sequence
and now we have here a menu
and you see automatically generated all these keyframes
If you move
you're not going to be able to modify
but if you go here
you can say step
So you can say only add keyframes every two or 3 keyframes
And now you can do different modes
So you can have linear
you can have cube
Quantic can take
by the way
if you're finding this confusing
if you just put your mouse and keep it there
it tells you this is weakest transition
almost linear
but with a slight curvature
If you go to quintet
it says quinty kissing
That one is not expressing much
much more
For example
in back
it tells you touby kissing with overshoot and settle bounce is telling you exponentially the came parable bounce
like when objects collide
so it's telling that use this one if you have
for example
a ball bouncing
sure and you can see the little line on the side gives you quite an indication to yes
and when I selected it modifies it there
And now there is a transition between the two lines created by the program
This is not like an after effect
you can modify it live
you know if it's done it done
if you want to do it again
you just delete those keyframes that are blue because those are in between keyframes
And now we do it again
And we do interplay sequence
And we
for example
put more steps
So I can put
ohsorry
less steps
So we put one
and now it's much more smooth because it goes from one shape to a number
Okaythat's really nice
perfect
So with that in mind I'm gonna delete this one and I'm going to go and I'm going to activate the first of my plants
Let's one for example
this one
And what I'm going to do is I'm going to make sure selecting the plant
I have a keyframe there and this animation is going to loop only on is going to reach frame 20 and then in frame 4 is going to go back again
And I know that our entire sequence is 100 frame
So I'm going to show you how to look that forever and ever
So I'm going to go to my frame 1
I'm going to copy Ctrl C and paste in frame 20 my animation
So now that we have there I'm gonna do it again
Ctrl C and in frame 40 is going to be the animation
Right now we have the animation three times the same
but now we're going to go into the one in the middle and we're going to see how we're going to modify
So I'm going to go to my sculpt mode and for doing that gender rotation
you see that we have this twist there
And I'm going to make it a bit big
and I'm going to start doing that
So I'm rotating my shape
and now I'm going to grab it with a big one
I'm going to start grabbing it
so I'm going to rotate it and grab it
okayjust like you were doing
practicing with the line before
but you can do now with your plant
And we have a problem here
It looks like I'm going to now make the act deactivate that
It looks like we have a problem and is that we didn't copy the two layers
we only copied one of them
You see that that is because we have the layer Co one MDP layer
that's my fault for not naming the layers
So I'm going to delete those layers
It's good for people to see the mistakes that come and I need to make sure that I select both layers
both the stroke and the main layer
So I'm going to I'm going to have to go back because I made many mistakes
okay
I'm going to delete all of that
delete the keyframes
We're gon na go to the first layer and copy both of them to frame 20
I think I need to copy them 1 by one
Let me see Ctrl CC plus V
ctrl C
ctrl V
and now I'm gon na
do control B
ctrl C Ctrl and ctrl C Ctrl
and now it's to Na be in the region in the middle
And now
yesI need to make sure that when I do this rotation I'm affecting both layers at the same time
It's looking much better and now I'm going to be pinching them
I'm moving them there
you know
now I'm going quite fast
but when I did it in the original animation
I took my time
taking your time means that you can make it quite gentle and with a lot of love
but I want to go a bit faster there
And now what I'm going to do is here I'm going to be in draw mode and I'm going to go to draw interpolate sequence and I'm gon na do steps of three
so it doesn't go that many
and for now I like the sinusoidal 1
It's just going to go there
and I'm going to do draw interplace sequence and the singles soid all is happening again
The only thing that we need is the other shape
we're going to select layer 1
because it's the stroke draw interplay sequence and draw interpolate sequence
So now both the stroke and the main part are just having that animation
So now someone might be wondering
how do I do this so it repeats again and again forever
So in order to do that
we're going to add a modifier to this plant
And I'm going to go here to the time offset modifier
And the time offset modifier is really simple
The only thing we are doing is telling the program how many frames of set
That means like where do we start the animation with my offset
But here in the custom range
I can say I can
I'm going to repeat my animation from frame 0 to frame 40
So from frame one actually to frame 40
and I want to put it is in the mode it is going to be
has a different ones
I think regular is the one that repeats forever
We could do
for example
ping pong
And what it does is that when it reaches one
it goes the other way or reverse
It kind of applies to in reverse animation direction
but the regular one just repeats our animation forever
So now when I have that there
my plant is just animating all the time
okay
So it doesn't add any new keyframes
it just it just knows and repeats forever
I can make my animation even longer now
and it's just continue forever
And you're adding the modifier to the Creese pedestal
I'm adding the modifier to the grease pencil
that means that I can have different loop speeds in different moment
And by the way
if you are finding that this animation
it might be that right-hind is going a bit too fast
Too too fast
Yeahso we could modify the keyframes by selecting them all and just putting them
I think it's possible
by the way
just to get the keyframes and scaling them
you see
So if we start from 0 and now we do scaling
I think it's scale into animation
The only problem we do that now is my animation is 70 frames
So remember to do that on your time of so now we're having a way slow animation that's easier
And how did you do the scaling
Just pressing S as simple as that
So what I'm going to do now is I'm going to go plant by plant
and I'm going to be animating them all
And so I'll see you in a second



## 3_03 Animating the Eye
------------------------
Hello Katie
hello again
Here we are with all our lovely animated plants
So should we make the eyes and the mouth
Yeahso for the eyes
I could make them and draw them exactly on top of our car
but in reality they can be floating a bit because we are never gon na get it
You know
So lateral that we're gonna say that trick
So I'm gonna go
I'm gonna create again
a eraas pencil
gonna call it blank
and I'm gonna call it eyes
And the techniques we're going to use for this
we actually have been used in them
Everyone's going to feel quite comfortable making this one
if you have been following
welleverything
So I'm going to go to draw mode
There's one thing that we can do in drone mode
I'm going to go to my materials
I'm going to delete this and create a new one because sometimes it generate some problems there
I'm gonna just select the white
I'm gonna make the white part of the eye first
and you have all these shapes so we can make circles
If you are not very good at drawing to just make a circle like that
that you have an eye
NiceI will definitely that easy PC
So now that we have that there
I think I could press
I have to press enter
The material is the white material for the eye and the layer here
very important to draw in layers is the I white
So now that we have that one
we're gon na need another black
And you can see it's quite big because it's kind of going to be cut
So I'm going to make a new layer and then is the pupil the black part
Yeahis pupil
Okaynow that we have that there I'm going to generate a new material and my new material ISS going to be only a field and it's going to be black
I'm going to use the circle again
and what I'm going to do is I'm going to make my material there
I'm going to press enter
So now that we have that drone there
one of the things we can do is masks
So we can use the white of the eye to mask the black part of the eye
You know
we have the pupil in one layer
we have the I white in another
And if you see here
if you select the iwh
you can use that as a mask
So you see that if you select use mask
so we can use a mask
I think we need to use it on the pupil
We select the mask here
we press plus
and we select the I white
So now the pupil is going to only appear where the eye white is
And as soon as I do it I'm cutting one shape to another
okay
And it's amazing because it's not only that I'm cutting one shape to another because we're gonna use this in animation
And again
I started from frame 30 five-eight
so I'm gonna go to frame one
make sure that I move my shapes to frame 1
and I'm gonna gonna see how I do this
So first I'm gonna put it in position

I'm going to deactivate my anchor point
I'm going to put that in front and I'm going to put my eye in a place that I like and you can rotate it in 3D so my eye can be there and I can scale it
And depending on what you're making
you know
you can have your eyes in different ways
That's looking good
Or maybe the eye in the reference was a bit smaller and a bit higher
Soso nice
I always love the way you add eyes to a character so is alive
but now what we can do is we have to have animation
So I know that this white of the eye is not going to be animated
but the black part
the pupil is
So let's see how we can do that
We can go to my pupil here and let's add on frame 10
I'm going to do a copy and paste
so in frame 10 I'm gon na have a different position for the pupil and we can go
for example
to in edit mode if we want
There are many ways of doing it
I can just lock my eye white and in edit mode I press A
so I select everything and now we can move
I can use my normal
the normal of my polygons
I think because I rotate it in that case
it kind of it goes together
it goes in the same direction
And now imagine I change the position of my eye
So I put my eye there
and now I'm going to go on frame 20
I'm going to copy and paste
I don't need to put it in frame 20 to be honest
I can put it a bit later and I can put a frame before frame in frame 26
So I'm going to hold on the same position and then from 26 to 30 I'm going to have a new position that maybe it's going to be looking down there and now I'm going to go and I'm going to go from frame 30 to frame 40
we're going to be in the same position
but from 40 to 47
for example
we're going to go and change that
So right now we still don't have interpolations
we have a little animation
but there is no interpolation happening between it
but if we want it to interpolate
it's really easy
we know that there is a transition between frame 0 and frame 10
so we're going to go here and going to be in drop mode
and we're going to do exactly what we did before interplay sequence
and now I'm getting an animation between one place and another
Now this holds
and now I'm going to have an animation here is going to be a bit longer through interplay sequence
so now I'm going to have a relationship between there and there
and now between there and there
I'm going to make it a bit longer Drew Interpolate sequence and others
There is an animation between there and there
So now my dog
it is looking around and I want to start once I get there
I should now like have an ending to this animation
so you can look forever
So I'm going to do copy and paste from up
Let me see from this position until 63 and 63 to 70
I'm liking this 70 because I go to the original position and I'm gon na double draw interplay sequence
So now I know that I end and frame 70 in exactly the same position where I started
right
And now you can keep going for like we did before
just adding a time offset modifier
I'm in regular mode
custom range 0 to 70
So now I know on frame 70
my animation starts again
So now when I play
my doggie is cooking around
Greatso simple
and you get so much character there
yeah



## 3_04 Animating the mouth + Final Render
------------------------
So should we do the mouth
Yeahlet's see how we're gonna do this
Yeah
so for the mouth
it's gonna be very simple
We are basically doing the same
we are making a blank frame
we are on the black grease pencil frame and we are going to be in frame 1
and I'm gonna call this mouth and let's see how we can make it
We are going go to my front view
so I'm making sure that I'm drawing in the correct place and we can activate where are you reference you are hidden
I think it's because we have all of this movie activated
okayI can see now how my mouth is
so I'm going to be selecting my mouth and I'm going to just try to put it in a similar position
I'm going to select my then
and I'm going to first draw here in the air
and then I'm going to move it in the correct position
I'm going to draw it a few times until I like it
that's good
and now that I have that there I'm going to go to my object mode
change my origins because I want it to be staying there
And for now I'm not gonna rotate it
I can rotate it later
but for my drawing when I'm still drawing for me
I like it just keeping it flat and in reality it works well like that
so I'm going to just keep that there and put my mouth there
and that's looking adorable
My dog is getting a lot of personality
the kid
so let's see how we can just animate this mouth in a simple way
One of the things that we could do is make the mouth appear and disappear
so we can just
let's say we are starting in frame time
we want to have the entire mouth
I'm going to be in drawing mode and I'm maybe on frame 8
I'm going to go in drum mode
I'm going to have my mouth starting to disappear
frame 6
my mouth is there and frame 4
my mouth is a little dot
so I'm having this animation of the mouth and so we kind of hold the mouth until frame 50
I'm copying and pasting this
and now I'm going to make my mouse disappear and my mouse appear left to right
and maybe now it's going to be the opposite ISS going to start disappearing like that
So up here there
now it gets at the beginning
I like it not that much variation
and then I get a lot of speed
That's a way of drawing
which I'm imitating the style of the curve that we would do if we were doing an easy in and out
You know
it gets faster
it's lower
it's a bit more fluid
that's a nice personality there
Okay
so now we are gonna call this layer
we can call it here mouth
if I change the layer here
when we go here to our layers
we are changing it here as it's just a different place to change
it's going to add a new layer and I'm going to call this tongue
And I know that tank was not in the original illustration
but it was in the animation that we made because we thought
ohit would be so pretty to have a tongue kind of moving left to right
So I'm going to deactivate
Oh no
Ithis is the material I'm using for the mouth
I need to make a new material
So I'm going to make this new material and I'm going to make it fill
and I'm going to make this pink material that we can use for my tongue
That's looking good
And now I'm going to just start drawing my tongue
Probably it starts after the entire month appeared
So maybe on frame 15 is the first frame of it
and we are now going to start drawing it
So at the beginning
we only have a tiny bit of time appearing
I can not see it very well
so I'm gon na make this color a bit more saturated
Okaythat's more pretty
And now we
because we have this mode activated
auto kinging is going to be quite easy now to start drawing a bit more
so I'm going to do the second position of my tongue
actually I can make a tiny bit bigger there
so my tongue appear there
and now for my third position
I like the tongue to kind of stay a lot behind
It's just
you know
it's getting bigger
but it's kind of licking the side of the mouth
I think it's so cute
I love these additions that you can make in 3D like you're saying it's not in the 2D
even if you could make a 2D animation
once you've got going with your model
you can have so much extra fun with it
Yeah
and I really would like to see
you know
if people are making their car or their hamster
what are they going to put here
Yeahbecause maybe you can do something that's really specific to you
I think that our dog Mickey glicks his mouth quite a lot actually
Yeahalways hungry
Soso that's good
It goes there
And now when we have that there
probably we're gon na have to be coming in
If I had a graphics tablet
I could be drawing a more detailed one
but I think I like it
and now that goes there and then I'm gon na
just copy that last frame or I can just click of it to create a frame
and then I delete whatever I need
So up
make sure that if I try to delete
we can block the other layer
So we can block the mount layer and when I delete and make sure that I'm only deleting my tongue layer
okayso I think it's that animation is working well there
And I'm gon na go to this mode so I can see what's happening
And now I can see that my animation is there
and then it returns
But I think once it gets smaller
it should start again
So in frame 60
I think we should start again
so we're going to go now to this mode
add modifier time of set custom range 0 to 60
And now my animation plays forever
I have my
and I really like as well
by the way
because my ranges are different
one goes from 0 to 60 and my eyes are from 0 to 70
As we repeat more and more
they are out of sync
so it feels a bit more alive because the mouth
sometimes it's moving when the eyes are looking at one place
and sometimes it's moving when the eyes are looking at another place
We're adding more and more variation with all of these combinations of things
The only thing now before just rendering our entire thing
the only thing I would recommend is that we can simply go and put a bit of the noise that we were using before
And also I can align this mouth
So to align this mouth in object mode
I can just put it there and rotate it
But the only thing I would do now is just add in my modifiers
I would put this noise where you are the noise and do the same we did before
You know
like we can change the noise scale so we can make the noise scale quite high and the position quite soft
So it's just adding a tiny bit of that
Yeaha bit more of the hand drawn feeling
And because the steps are every 4
we are having this kind of thing that is changing all the time and it's adding a really nice effect
If we have an effect that we like and we want to copy to another place
it's really easy
The thing you need to do is select all the objects
So for example
select this plant and this plant and this plant
and maybe the mouth as well
and then
and then select continue doing shift and select the object in which you have the effect that you like
For example
here on the eye
that needs to be the last one
And now we go to noise here and we say copy to select it
I now automatically my program has copied that noise to every single of my layers
so now all my layers are having that noise applied
I need my beta in the mouth
To be honest
I would do the noise a bit softer
so we just can select the mouth and modified
no worries
they are not connected
it simply in position
we're gon na make it a tiny bit smaller because I think it was a bit too much for the mouth
so that's starting to look really good
very lovely by the way
some people are going to think
is there another way of drawing
like can you draw on a surface and it is possible I'm going to show you just as a final extra thing
I'm going to show you that if we add a grease pencil
there is one mode in drawing that instead of drawing on my origin
you can draw on a surface and it's possible to draw
I'm going to just make sure that I am in the correct position
do draw
and I probably was in some random layer 392
My goodness
let's go to frame 1
not to this crazy one
okay
And let's draw in there
So we are now selecting the drone mode and I'm gonna draw in there
And it looks like I'm drawing flat
but because we are drawing in surface
look what happened
I was drawing on top of my object
but it's quite separated and the separation is defined by this
It's defined by this offset
So the offset happens because a lot of times when you're drawing this and by mistake
it intersects the geometry
So usually you want to put something quite small to look as if you are completely drawing on top of the object
And when I do that
now for real I'm drawing on top
And this can be very useful
You know
you could have done the post there using this mode
but it can lead to problems because it's quite difficult to control
You don't really know what you're doing
It's not super intuitive to be drawing so much in 3D
so for now
I only recommend doing it when it's really necessary to do so
And you can see that for this type of 2D animation on top
it's not completely necessary
so we're going to have to be a bit clever about the usage of this mode
But we are then going to be looking
you know
the content on the school
He's expanding more on grease pencil
We are doing all the projects with all the people's illustrations and showing how they can be adapted
and sometimes that mode will be used
So it's not that we are against it
it's only that we are just being a bit careful when to use it
Makes sense
Only use something complicated if it's really necessary
Yes
and oh
a final
final little thing is that when we are rendering
because we are not using any
single light or the world
if you want to render this animation
when you do render animation
So far I haven't found a way in which I can render this animation
And it doesn't go to this ugly mode
You know
I know that I need to position the camera and everything
Let's do that so people understand what I mean
I'm going to go there
And now when I do render animation
you see that it's rendering with the original light from my scene
And it's doing it even if I delete the lights from my scene
I'm going to delete that and you'll to go render render animation and still applying the original light
That's because we deactivated the lights and we wanted to use this kind of Hdri that comes with Blender So far
maybe someone can tell us
So far
we haven't discovered exactly how to do to render with this light
But there's like everything in life
There is a little trick
and it is this trick is quite useful as well if you
for example
want to render this mode
but you want to talk to your friends
all of these kind of lines that are appearing and you want them to see how cool is the look of the program
So if you want to do that
you simply have to go to here to inside
I think it's inside
let me see
Now I started talking and now I'm not going to know where it is so
In view here
in any of the modes
when we go to view
we can go and do viewport render animation
We first need to select where we are rendering our animation like we always do
And now when we do viewport render animation
we render the viewport for the animation range of this scene
So when I click there
it's rendering this mo​‌​‌​​‌‌​​‌‌​​‌‌‌​‌‌​​‌‌​‌​‌​​‌‌​​‌‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌‌​​‌‌‌‌‌‌​​‌‌​‌​‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌​‌‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌‌​​‌‌‌​​‌‌‌​‌​‌​‌​​‌‌‌‌‌‌​​‌‌​​​‌​​‌‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌‌​​‌‌‌​‌​‌​‌​​‌‌​‌‌‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌‌‌‌​​​‌‌‌​‌‌​​‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌‌​​‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌‌​‌‌​​‌‌​​‌‌​​‌‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌‌​​‌​​‌‌‌​​‌‌‌​‌​‌​‌​​‌‌​​​‌​​‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌‌​​‌‌‌​‌​‌‌‌​​‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌‌​​‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌​​‌‌‌​​‌​​‌‌​​​‌​​‌‌‌​​‌​​‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌​‌‌‌​​‌‌‌‌‌​​​‌‌​‌‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌​‌​‌‌‌​‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌​‌​‌​​‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌​‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌​‌‌​​​‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌​‌‌​​​‌‌​‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌‌​​‌‌​‌‌‌‌‌​‌​‌​‌​​‌‌​‌​‌​​‌‌​‌​‌‌‌​‌‌​​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌‌​​‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌​​‌‌‌​​‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌​‌‌‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌​‌‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌​‌​‌‌‌​‌‌​​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌​​‌‌​‌​‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌​‌​‌‌‌​‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌​​‌‌​​‌‌‌​​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌​​​‌‌‌‌‌​​​‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌​​‌​​‌‌​‌​‌‌‌​‌​‌‌‌​​‌‌​‌‌​​​‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌​‌‌‌​​‌‌‌‌‌​​​‌‌​‌​‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌‌​​‌‌‌​‌​‌‌‌‌‌​‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌‌​​‌‌‌‌‌‌​​‌‌​‌‌‌​​‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌‌​​‌​​‌‌​​‌‌​​‌‌‌​​‌​​‌‌‌​​‌​​‌‌​‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌de
And this is very useful because we love showing like work in progress to our friends
We love showing how it works and it solves the problem here
So we do view render report animation
Now we are rendering that
of course
we need to make sure that we don't have that empty layer there
So and let me make sure that I'm zoom in enough and now I do view is a behavior there view for render animation
And here I am
I'm rendering my animation with the look and the Hdri that comes in Blender lately
I know that's a little extra
but it's good to know because sometimes people say
how do you do to finish the render
And that's how you do it perfect



## 4_01 Noah Albrecht Part 1
------------------------
Hello Katie
Hi and welcome to Noah Sin
I love this one and we are going to be analyzing a bit how it was made
We want people to be able to make their own illustrations
So what we're going to be doing here is we're going to provide everyone this file
This file as well has some animation
So when you play
you can see how we use grease pencil to animate this little
the deer having a bit of a snooze
And also we want to explain how materials will build
Like we know that we are always used grease pencil or grease pencil
It's super versatile and depending on how we use it
we can achieve completely different results
Yeah
and this one's really interesting because when I'm looking at it now
it looks just like
no is a 2D illustration
but you're moving around it in 3D
Not only that
we also
if we go here into post mode
we have created some animation
So the car is rigged
You can see here how I can move the legs
I have the little pole
so I can check where the leg is pointing at
And even the tail animates with the lovely band
We
yesthis illustration is a bit different from what we've done before
We are not going for a different 3D style
Look
What we are trying to achieve is exactly the same look that the original illustration had
I think the original illustration is somewhere around here
Yeahso we are achieving the same look that the original illustration h​‌​‌​​‌‌​​‌‌​​‌‌‌​‌‌​​‌‌​‌​‌​​‌‌​​‌‌​​‌‌​​‌‌​​‌‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌​‌‌‌‌‌​‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌​‌​‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌​‌‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌‌​​‌‌‌​​‌‌‌​‌​‌​‌​​‌‌‌‌‌‌​​‌‌​​​‌​​‌‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌​‌​‌‌‌​‌​‌​‌​​‌‌​‌‌‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌‌‌‌​​​‌‌‌​‌‌​​‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌‌​​‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌‌​‌‌​​‌‌​​‌‌​​‌‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌‌​​‌​​‌‌‌​​‌‌‌​‌​‌​‌​​‌‌‌‌‌​​​‌‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌‌​​‌‌‌​‌​‌‌‌​​‌‌​‌​‌‌‌​‌‌​​‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌​​‌‌‌​​‌‌‌​‌​​​‌​​‌‌‌​​‌​​‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌​‌‌‌​​‌‌‌‌‌​​​‌‌​‌‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌​‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌‌​​‌‌​‌​‌​​‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌​‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌​‌‌​​​‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌​‌‌​​​‌‌​‌​‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌​‌‌‌‌‌​‌​‌​‌​​‌‌​‌​‌​​‌‌​‌​‌‌‌​‌‌​​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌‌​​‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌​​‌‌‌​​‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌​‌‌‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌​‌‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌​​​‌‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌​‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌​​‌‌​‌​‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌​‌​‌‌‌​‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌‌​‌‌​​‌‌​​‌‌​​‌‌​‌​‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌​​​‌‌‌‌‌​​​‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌​​‌​​‌‌​‌​‌‌‌​‌​‌‌‌​​‌‌​‌‌​​​‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌​‌‌‌​​‌‌‌‌‌​​​‌‌​‌​‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌‌​​‌‌‌​‌​‌‌‌‌‌​‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌‌​​‌‌‌‌‌‌​​‌‌​‌‌‌​​‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌‌​​‌​​‌‌​​‌‌​​‌‌‌​​‌​​‌‌‌​​‌​​‌‌​‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌ad
but we are being able now to look at it in 3D and look at it from every angle
So I figure you had to build in 3D
right
Yes
we can look at here at how this was made
This all came from a 3D model
and then we wrecked and then we applied a few things
So you can see here that I have a little bit of a bump
We're going to explain how that was created
and the reason why was that was created
The first thing we're going to show here is I'm going to go file new general
I'm not going to save this
And I want to show how we made the main part of the material on this program
So we have a problem is that when we have 3D
even if we are using Eev
we are getting some type of lighting
You can see here when I rotate it is affecting my
the layers like the different faces of my cube
If I want the cube to have a completely solid color
what we can do is automatically this cube comes with a material called material
So we can go here into my
is this in shading
And we are going to get rid of the principal bsdf This is the one that we usually use has all the specular rough
but we don't really want to do that
We don't want to use any of those properties because the only thing that we're going to need is an emission
So this is an emission color
So animation is a single color
a solid color that the material is going to emanate
but it's not light
it's not an emission in terms of light
we I'm not going to illuminate the scene
The only thing we're going to apply is this color to the
and now when I changed my color
whatever color I use
my material is going to be exactly that color
I can go here to layout
and now we only have one option in my material
which is the color that's it
that's can
So it looks completely flat
but you are still moving around
It still is a 3D cube
exactlywe still have a 3D cube
If we go to the previous setting
we are still there
but now when I look at it from here
it's all the time going to look completely flat
That's what we did with the illustration from No
I can go back here to the illustration from Noah
And you can see here that most of the materials
or actually all the materials I have here
if I go inside my material setting
I have just one material with one emission
Okay
we have another thing that we have in this project that maybe someone might be wondering
why is that
When we go here
we are having all these bumps
Yeahso we wanted to do this thing
We wanted to get a little bit of a wiggly edge around all my 3D objects because that allows us
when we rotate
it looks as if it was like just drawn with with a hand drawn pen
But one of the problems that we had is that there is an option inside this program that kind of was supposed to be used for doing that
So if you select VR
you can go to add grease pencil that you have a collection line art
That means that we are going to apply linear to this entire collection
And the first thing I discovered that you need to do is you need to be looking at the scene through a camera
So I'm going to be looking at it through my camera
I'm going look my camera to the view
So I'm going to be looking at it
So the camera I'm going to be selecting here I'm going to add Kristen
so seeing lineart and as soon as I do it
we are seeing what the program is doing is adding lines on the edge of my entire object
And right now you're getting all of these little dots for one reason
The reason why we're getting is because we are applying another effect
which in this case is this display toate my displays
I'm going to deactivate my displays here and I'm going to deactivate my displays here
Ohmy displays only
I'm going to deactivate displays so you can see what the program can do
It can generate these linear that covers around my object and theres a lovely effect of
of like
you know
like if it was an outline
yeahit looks like a cartoon
doesn't it
And again
you can move around it in 3D
The problem with this effect is first is a bit slow
So you can see that it's slowing down my program quite a lot
And I always wanted to have something that was live that could work live in my stream
But my second problem is that I can change the color
but I would have to generate a single lineart pair material in order to have the color of the edge to be how I wanted it
And then I could go into my line art
You know
when I generated my linear
I could go into
where are you
Is this this line art
YeahI could go into line and apply effects
I could apply
for example
a noise to make it more quickly
to give you that jagged edge
But in reality
Iyou only wanted the jagged edge
I didn't want that outline because this
this illustration
there is an illustration when we show it
I'm going to show it again
didn't have an it
The only thing I have is the squibbing edges
So I decided I was going to do it
applying some noise to the material
And to apply noise to the material
I wanted to apply a displacement noise
So that would allow my geometry to Dis
And to apply a displacement noise
usually you can do it inside your shading panel
Do you remember like you go to shading
there's a displacement map and you add it
The problem is that because we're using evon
not cycles Eev doesn't allow for displacement because it takes quite a lot of time to display some material
So if you're using Eev
instead of applying your displacement as a texture in the material
we can simply go to the object and apply a modifier
And the modifier is called display
So you add a modifier and you need to find it here is here in where are you
Displays
Displayshere it is
You can see that
So after I applied that
the only thing I need to do is load the texture
And in this case
I loaded a noise texture
You can just generate a noise inside the program or you can load a noise texture
you can create a noise texture inside Photoshop it however you want
So once you apply the noise texture
when you activate it
what it's doing is I can see it here
it modifying the entire geometry
putting it up and down in reality is up and down everywhere
not only in the edges
but because my viewing is completely flat for the human eye looks as if it's only in the edges
Yeahand so is that a much lighter way it works
It is a bit heavy
but as you can see
it's moving quite well
And the cool thing about it is that you can change how heavy it is depending on the subdivisions you have in your geometric
because obviously I cannot display something if there is not enough you
So imagine if I have only one subdivision
So you can see that with one subdivision
it's very difficult to see the effect because there is no enough geometry
But I can make
for example
two subdivisions
and I'm starting to see more
and I can make 3
I can make four
and I can make 5
I can make 6
if I make 6
my program might start going a bit slowly
But the cool thing about subdivision is I can put three here
and I can put five in my render time
so I can be working completely fine in my project
and then when I render it in the end
it's going to render well
So this was the most kind of flexible way
I found to do this type of effect
So remember
simply add a displacement texture after a subdivision
put a noise in it
and then you're going to be able to get those quickly edges perfect
The other things I did about this
as well as modeling that
you know
like modeling is basically coming from cube
You can imagine this is a cube with the extrusion from the leg
This head was a separate object
The only other thing was creating all the grease pencil object
So this was an animation that I made and instead of animating it three times
I made only one animation in which I made this set to move around
like from going to one position
you can see I made this position
this position here
and this position here
And then I made transitions between them
But instead of making it three times
what I did is I only made one
and then I copied them a few times
and then I used the time of set that we use in our main course
and then I changed the time of
you know
like it goes from 1 to 71
But now I can change my frame offset
So if you wanted to have a fourth copy
you could do the same
you make another copy
and now when you make the frame of you are simply making them animate at different times
that's very clever as simple as that
and then all the grease pencil I'm using I'm using the noise effect
so they are always changing every
you know
I don't know how many frames
every four frames
Because it creates that effect as if something is hand-drawn
I really like doing that
And in the course
we learn about how you can draw grease pencil onto the surface of an object
It looked like you did that here
Yeahso I only did it actually for this 1
I did it for the nose
I think for the rest I drew in a completely flat way and then I adapted it
But you can do it if you feel like
as I'm saying
sometimes it does work that well
I think I used it
I used it actually as well for this DOC
but you can see here I used quite a lot of distance
you can see the distance between this grease pencil and the DOC
but I can
I recommend only using it if you really need it
If not
rememberyou can always draw in a completely flat way and then you can simply move the object to the position and then you can use the sculpting
you know
always with the sculpt mode
you can modify and move your objects
So you can just adapt them and rotate them and make them to go a bit closer to the geometry
Oh yes
you can kind of get just where you want
And the cool thing as well
you can see here is that grease pencil gets affected by armature
So when I created my armature now when I go into my post mode I'm moving everything and my entire grid pencils is moving with my geometry
So in the next mini
minimini lesson
we're gon na see how it is to rig this character without having to use all the complexity
From Rigby we made a simple rig
I know that there is an entire course about rigging in school
but I know a lot of people is going to Na want to know how do we rig something like this tail and how they will RI these legs without having to go through the entire rectify
So we're going to have this little lesson and we're going to explain it
and then you're gon na be able to make things like this yourself
Perfect to see you in the next lesson
bye



## 4_02 Noah Albrecht Part 2
------------------------
Welcome back
everyone
So this is an E specials sex learning
which we can explain how we can do very simple rigs
We have here the main part of the body with the legs
I'm going to explain how we can build simple rigs with Ik
Ik means that we're going to be able to select the position of the leg
moving it around
and then the entire body is going to follow
And also we're gonna see how to make the tail after that
Ni​‌​‌​​‌‌​​‌‌​​‌‌‌​‌‌​​‌‌​‌​‌​​‌‌​​‌‌​​‌‌‌​‌‌​​‌‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌‌​‌‌​​‌‌‌​​‌​​‌‌​‌​‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌​‌‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌‌​​‌‌‌​​‌‌‌​‌​‌​‌​​‌‌‌‌‌‌​​‌‌​​​‌​​‌‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌‌‌‌‌​​‌‌​‌​‌​​‌‌​‌‌‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌‌‌‌​​​‌‌‌​‌‌​​‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌‌​​‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌‌​‌‌​​‌‌​​‌‌​​‌‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌‌​​‌​​‌‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌​‌​‌​​‌‌‌‌‌‌​​‌‌​‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌‌​​‌‌‌​‌​‌‌‌​​‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌​​​‌‌​​‌‌​​‌‌​‌‌‌‌‌​‌​​​‌​​‌‌‌​​‌​​‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌​‌‌‌​​‌‌‌‌‌​​​‌‌​‌‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌​‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌​‌​‌​​‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌​‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌​‌‌​​​‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌​​‌‌​‌​‌‌‌​‌​‌​‌​​‌‌​‌‌‌‌‌​‌​‌​‌​​‌‌​‌​‌​​‌‌​‌​‌‌‌​‌‌​​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌‌​​‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌​​‌‌‌​​‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌​‌‌‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌​‌‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌​​​‌‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌‌​​‌​​‌‌‌​​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌​​‌‌​‌​‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌​‌​‌‌‌​‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌​‌​‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌​​‌‌​​‌‌​​‌‌​‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌​​​‌‌‌‌‌​​​‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌​​‌​​‌‌​‌​‌‌‌​‌​‌‌‌​​‌‌​‌‌​​​‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌​‌‌‌​​‌‌‌‌‌​​​‌‌​‌​‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌‌​​‌‌‌​‌​‌‌‌‌‌​‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌‌​​‌‌‌‌‌‌​​‌‌​‌‌‌​​‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌‌​​‌​​‌‌​​‌‌​​‌‌‌​​‌​​‌‌‌​​‌​​‌‌​‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌ceokay
Anyone doing this
We recommend first doing an entire course on rigging because I think that that course gives a lot of knowledge about how bones work
But if you want to do a quick break
this might work
So we're going to start by adding an armature is here and a single bone
We only need one bone
I'm going to go to the frontal view
I'm going to go in my transparent mode and the beginning of the bone
it depends on on how you want my chain here is I'm going to start my tail from here
So what I'm going to do is I'm going to rotate my bone there with pressing CT
I do rotations of 5 degrees at a time
And now the cool thing about the bones
if we go into edit mode is that they can be treated a bit like any modeling
So if I press E
I can extrude them and I can extrude towards here
And then I can extrude again where to where my head is
If you send the course of rigging with us
you know that sometimes we don't rig with the head included because usually heads are rigid
And in this case
the head is rigid
So what we do is we model entire head
then we put it all together
we parent it all together
and then we just attach it to this final bone
So we rotate that final bone
the head moves
but it's not getting affected by the weights because I don't like the formations of heads
Yeahunless you are doing the formation of heads
but in most cases we are not
Okay
now we're going to start extruding leg
So I'm going to go one time there
another time there to the middle
another time down
And now I'm going to do it again
one time
one time again there
not the time there
By the way
it's possible if you wanted
it's possible to do this extreme applying with a symmetry
but for this case
because it's so simple
we are not doing it with symmetry
And with this one
how did you
how did you decide exactly
Because obviously this moose coming from the 2D is a completely graphical 2D characters
So how do you choose where you want the bones to go
To be honest
when I model this one
because I love so much how they were not in the same position
the other model is not
is even less symmetric than what we are doing right now
So it was completely me just guessing and doing it
and then checking again
and then check again and check again
There was no science at all to it
It's just a pure game of guessing and taking what it works
But it's a good question because I think a lot of times people think that there is much more planning than there is
But this has been mainly
you know
trying trial and error to know if you make your own character right now with crazy proportions
But the thing is very important now is that the situation of where the bones are is to be in somehow related to where my cuts are in my geometry
And I'm gonna show you because the geometry right now has a subdivision
But in reality
it is a super simple geometry
I'm gonna show you without transparency and I'm gon na go to my edit mode
You see that I made this
it's very simple
but it has some cuts here on the knees and these cuts here on the knees are in these two positions
And if I check my armature and I'm going to try to make it transparent
you see that here
the middle
the circle of my bones needs to be between these lines
These cuts in the middle
the more it is between these lines
the much better it is going to be
because then when it bends
it's going to bend very smoothly while still being a cart that is going to bend animate very well because we don't have that geometry
This is the geometry that the weights are going to be playing with
but then it's going to be softened out with a subdivision after
Okaythat makes sense
but in the body
you're not thinking about that then because that would be a much smoother animation in what do you mean in the body
You're not thinking about where you're positioning the weights depending on the cuts that you have in the geometry
Not really
because in the in the
in the body
the body
the bones are really
really in the middle
So a bone that I bend here is gonna affect almost all the geometry
Ithe thing on the left
the bone is really near the edge
And if I just didn't have
iffor example
I had the bone a bit too high up
when it bends
it's going to kind of make the two points collapse against one another and it's going to look very ugly
I think that it's very important in these cases to just do it simple and practice with a really
reallyreally simple geometry
because you're going to understand much better how it works
Once we have that
the only thing we need to do is just select my geometry
I'm going to call this body
I'm going to select my armature
so with Ctrl click I'm going select the armature and then we do right click parent with automatically weights
That means that the program is going to automatically calculate the weights depending on the distance from the bone to the different phases
the geometry
And as soon as I do it
now if I go
my geometry goes inside my body goes inside my armature
and if I go now into post mode
I can go activate transparency
If I go into post mode
if I rotate any of my bones
you can see that my Carter is basically raked
you know
and it's raking quite well
You know
it's not perfect here
like you correct this bend
but because we're going to be having a flat shading
this is absolutely not relevant
It's going to look good
And if I want as well
I can always go into my body and in object mode
I can select my body and I can add more subdivisions so I can get smoother
But no worries about this not being perfect because then we're gon na
make it all squid with my noise
So I always say this as well to people
you know
only worry I'm gon na do two subdivisions
I only only worry about things and details if they are actually going to be visible
But if they are not
this should be fine
And now people are gonna be wondering how do you do
Because if I try not to move this of the bone
this just rotates And people are going to think
how do you do
So you can just have this Ik system in which you select the location of the feet
and then they follow
So we did an inverse kinematic Ik system for that
And to do the Ik system
the first thing I need to do is I'm you're going to have to do this leg by leg
but I'm only going to do it with this right front leg
And I'm going to generate a couple more bonds
I'm going to go into my edit mode and I'm going to activate transparency
So I know what I'm going to do
And let's make sure that I'm selecting this one in the front and I'm going to do E to generate a new bone
And now I'm going to go to my foot
and I'm going to do it again to generate another new bone
So now this new bones I'm going to separate them
If I press split
if you see
if I try to move this bone
they all follow
But now if I do right click and split
now they are separated from the from the entire chain
And I'm going to do that with both of them
So now I have these two independent bones that are floating there that are going to be used as a reference
This one on the top
we're going to put names to know to get confused and we're going to call it poll and this would be right knee in the front
You can pull whatever names you do
pull R
knee F makes sense
And then this bone is going to be called foot because the foot and this is going to be on the right front
so R and f
right and front
okay
So now what we want is this little bone to control the chain of the leg
And there's a little trick before doing it
I can move this knee a tiny bit to the front and already indicating how my knee is going to bend because if not
it can sometimes make a mistake and bend backwards a bit
If I was how those animals bend backwards
flamingo like a flamingo
yeahor maybe this duck could be bending backwards
that's mistake
Okaythe moves doesn't
So we're going now go into post mode
Somehow this happens post mode and I'm going to select this bone
which is my foot
and I'm going to shift click and I'm going to select this one that is going to be the end of my chain
Whatever you are doing
you always want to do the end of the chain bone
And now I'm going to do right click and I'm going to actually
it's not right click here
I think it's in post
We're going to do inverse kinematics
add Ik to bone
So I'm going to do that
thatand then it's asking me again
act to active bone
So as soon as I do it
let's see what is happening
This bone got turned into yellow
This bone
nothing is showing
And then when I click in this bone
you see that there's t​‌​‌​​‌‌​​‌‌​​‌‌‌​‌‌​​‌‌​‌​‌​​‌‌​​‌‌​​‌‌‌​‌‌​​‌‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌‌​‌‌​​‌‌‌​​‌​​‌‌​‌​‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌​‌‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌‌​​‌‌‌​​‌‌‌​‌​‌​‌​​‌‌‌‌‌‌​​‌‌​​​‌​​‌‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌‌‌‌‌​​‌‌​‌​‌​​‌‌​‌‌‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌‌‌‌​​​‌‌‌​‌‌​​‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌‌​​‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌‌​‌‌​​‌‌​​‌‌​​‌‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌‌​​‌​​‌‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌​‌​‌​​‌‌‌‌‌‌​​‌‌​‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌‌​​‌‌‌​‌​‌‌‌​​‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌​​​‌‌​​‌‌​​‌‌​‌‌‌‌‌​‌​​​‌​​‌‌‌​​‌​​‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌​‌‌‌​​‌‌‌‌‌​​​‌‌​‌‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌​‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌​‌​‌​​‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌​‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌​‌‌​​​‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌​​‌‌​‌​‌‌‌​‌​‌​‌​​‌‌​‌‌‌‌‌​‌​‌​‌​​‌‌​‌​‌​​‌‌​‌​‌‌‌​‌‌​​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌‌​​‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌​​‌‌‌​​‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌​‌‌‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌​‌‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌​​​‌‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌‌​​‌​​‌‌‌​​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌​​‌‌​‌​‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌​‌​‌‌‌​‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌​‌​‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌​​‌‌​​‌‌​​‌‌​‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌​​​‌‌‌‌‌​​​‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌​​‌​​‌‌​‌​‌‌‌​‌​‌‌‌​​‌‌​‌‌​​​‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌​‌‌‌​​‌‌‌‌‌​​​‌‌​‌​‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌‌​​‌‌‌​‌​‌‌‌‌‌​‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌‌​​‌‌‌‌‌‌​​‌‌​‌‌‌​​‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌‌​​‌​​‌‌​​‌‌​​‌‌‌​​‌​​‌‌‌​​‌​​‌‌​‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌his yellow arrow
This is telling us the beginning of the Ik
so this is telling us there is a chain of things happening
and this is going until the very end of the chain
So when you move that initial foot right back to the tailor is going to move
the entire car is gonna move
and this doesn't make any sense
this is not looking good
So what we want is when I move this tailbone
this bone will move
this bone will move
but that said
how long is this chain
I see one bone and two bones right Now
if I go here and if I go into my options
you can see that the program automatically added an Ik bone constraint and the chain length is 0
Zero for this program means infinite
So we didn't select how long it was
So it was up to the very end of the BU
But now we're going to do a chain of two
So let's see what happens
Actually I'm going to do first chain of three because sometimes people make a mistake and they do a chain of three
So if I do a chain of three
when I now move this bone
things look good
but my chain is a too long
So I'm getting this kind of a strange thing in which my
it's moving like the bone that it should be not moving
Let's make instead of that
a chain of two
And now we're going to see that my entire system up
I need to move this one
My entire system starts making more sense
I'm going to deactivate transparency and going to go to this mode
and I'm going to see that now my me is Ben in a much more natural way
The only problem I have is that I have no ability to say where my knee is pointing
And for that
we usually use poles
And if you remember we had selected
we made one bone that was called pole
our knee
So let's see how we can do to use that as a poll
We can go to my options here
my Ik
and you see here it says pull target
the pole target I can select and I select
And but the first thing I selected is this armature
It is just the armature
but now we need to select within the armature which bone
And if I write here
pole or knee is one that we generated before and we need one extra step
And is that the pole angle is always wrong
but 99% of the time
if we put 90%
it will work
So as soon as I put 90%
now my yellow arrow is pointing at the end of this chain
And now you can see that when I go here
now I can use this pole to select where my knee is pointing at
very nice
So this is basically how I rigged the Carter
I did this for every single of the legs
and then you can say
ohbut it's looking ugly
I don't like that I'm seeing these ugly bones
That'sthat's just visuals
but the visuals that I made in the project that I made to make it more pretty is I did a few things
I went into my object mode and I generated a mesh
You can make whatever mesh you want
In this case
I can make a circle
I can make it a bit smaller
So that's going to be my circle reference
And I can make it disappear because I don't want to see my render
This is going to be simply a geometry I'm going to use because now when I go into my post mode
I can select any of my bones and I go here into my options
and you see a area that it says view for display
I can select that this display as a custom object
and I can select that circle
I can do the same with the bone that is at the end of the chain and I can select that circle my pole is going to be this circle and my pole is going to be and my foot is going to be a circle as well
Sometimes because the pole
you know
for whatever reason
you can make a different type of circle that looks a bit different or you can as well rotate it
translate it
You can do
for example
change the scale and make an elongated like that
and as long as you make all your posts to look the same
people understand what's going on exactly
And the other thing I did is all the bones that were not relevant
and I didn't want the people to be playing with
I just selected height
so I don't show them
So now it's a very magical thing
which I only saw in this circle
and people can change the length of my knee if you are having a bit of a bend
you see that this is not bending very well
this is not perfect
This can be corrected with doing weights
But what I recommend that the problem happened here is that probably the bone was a bit too low
so the bending is not happening in a completely linear way
so I would have put the bone a bit higher
so there's a bit more straight leg
But in reality
because of how this entire thing is made
this is good enough for whatever we are the purpose right now
So you'd recommend rather than using the weight painting
which we learn about in the longer course
you'd recommend more focusing on the preparation 100 preparation is much better than spending a lot of time painting
If you need to paint
you know
we explain in the other course how to do it
But most of the times I forget about painting
I just do it with a bit of preparation
And now that we learned this
want how I'm going to delete this and I'm going to show how I made the tail And the tail is much more simple than people think
If you now understand how this works
I'm going to do it simply with a cylinder and I'm going to make a few
I know actually I can go into my cylinder
I'm going to deactivate this
I'm going to now select my cylinder
I'm going to rotate it 90 degrees and I'm going to scale this
Oh
why is my cylinder rotated like that
Okay I'm going to delete it
and I'm going to start by cylinder again
mes cylinder
and actually I can do it in the options here
so I'm going to do a bit of depth that looks a bit like a tail already
and I'm gon na be a bit thinner
okay
And I can do a vertical because I can explain how it works here
So the way to do my tail is like this
I'm going to go to my edit mode
Of course
in order for my tail to bend I'm gon na need some cuts because even though right now it's not gon na work
it's one of the problems sometimes people have is that they forget that you need cuts for this to work
Click and now I'm going to do number of cuts and I'm going to do a few of them
So this is quite soft
okay
I'm going to do 23
that's going to give me quite a lot of bending
remember that then you can put everything inside the subdivision surface
Okay
so now I'm going to go to my object mode
I'm going to look in front and I'm going to add armature
and I'm going to add a single bone
I need to activate transparency to see that bone and let's put the beginning of my chain
I'm going to go in here and I'm going to start extruding in my edit mode
I'm going to start extruding
What I can do is I can do extrude with E
and I think if you press X
no set
If I press set
I make sure that I'm moving only in the set axis
so I'm gon na do a chain of bones
maybe I don't need the chain to be that long because I'm gon na get bored
So e set and how do you decide how big to make the bones here
I guess you don't want to overlap the geometry
the size of the bones is not relevant
is more of an indication is the way the program is representing them
so it's fine if I made them so big that they overlap the geometry
it's only an indication from the program
So the distance between the volumes
the more volumes we have
the smoother the chain is going to be
but of course our program is going to get a bit slower
But yeah
that's a very good question because at the beginning
I thought that the size of the bone was relevant
but in reality you can go here and change
TheI think
in custom properties is
ohmaybe not in here
but I'm sure if you go into post mode
we can select the bone and I can go and check how it looks
And if I change how it looks and I can make a custom object or chase how it looks and it could be smaller
it's not really relevant to the end of the end
the end result
Okay
now that we have that there
we're going to do exactly what we did before
I'm going to select my cylin cylinder
I'm going to call it tail
and I'm going to select cylinder armature
At this point
probably everyone is an expert on this
you're just going to do right click parent with automatic weights
And now my tail is inside my armature
If I go to post mode
I can just rotate and my tail is rotating
And if it's not smooth enough
it's because remember that we can just go into object mode and add
I can select that and add a modifier and I can add a subdivision surface with a couple of subdivisions and I can shade it all smooth
and I can be this mode
And now you can see that when I go into my post mode
I can select any of my bones and I can start rotating and it's looking nice
and it's smooth for my tail
But the thing that we wanted is to be able to select the last point of the chain of my tail and be able to move the entire tail
And it's exactly the same that we've done before
So oh I'm going to
I don't know why going
but I deleted some of the subdivisions
I'm going to do say the smooth
but I wanted to reset the armature
By the way
if you want to reset the armature
you don't do it like that
I did it wrong
just like all the ones with A
and then you go post transform
Ohno
clear transform all
And now all my transformations get completely cleared
So what I'm going to do now is I'm going to do exactly the same
I'm going to go to edit mode
I'm going to generate a copy of this bone
I'm going to select this
I'm going to split it
So now this is split
and now I'm going to go into my pose mode and select this bone
select this last part of the chat
and we're going to go into pause or pose inverse kinematics
I k to 1
and as soon as I added
we have this that turn yellow and you can not see it
but there is a yellow line that is going all the way to the end of my chain
In this case I'm not even going to have to say in the program how long is my chain because it just went to the very end of my chain and that's what I wanted
So now if I move this in post mode
let's see how this magically my entire tail works
And it looks like a tail
that's great
So does it always
the chain always goes automatically to the final bone
always to the final one
So in this case
because it was good
that's fine
If I wanted the beginning of my tail to be a bit straight and only having in the end bend
I can always select the bone that is telling me the length of the chain
Go here and make my chain length of
for example
you know
You can
I think people now can start understanding what the system is
You know
now if I move it
only the end
if my chain is moving and at the beginning it's completely straight
It's great to see that because I'm kind of imagining what crazy characters people are coming up
Yeah
this looks a bit like you could make one of these things that sometimes they are in America to sell cars and you see them in the UK as well
that they move with the movement of the wind
I love
Yeahand the cool thing about this
of course
you can add a pole to select where this looking at
like we did it before
but I think with this
we have explained enough how to do this rigging on the character
I hope you all enjoyed it
I'm go
go and just show the project one second before
Remember that you are going to be able to access this project the same thing that happened by the way with this
this is just if you go into post mode
these ones that are controlling the head and the body are simply the same Are I selected one of the bones and I made it look a bit like that
so it looked a bit prettier
The same with the head is exactly the same
and by the way
you can see that here
my tail has a bit of grease pencil that is attached to the tail that actually was included when I did pairing with automatic weight and automatically blender applied the weight to the tail and included the grease pencil
which is amazing
A little treat
So I think now at this point
everyone knows how to make every single element on this
I really think that you should instead of trying to copy exactly the illustration from Noah and the version we made in 3D
you should make your own version
Yeahwe'd love to see more people's illustrations appearing here
moving around them in 3D
In the next lesson
we're going to check another illustration
and I think it my favorite
I mean
the three of them are my favorites
but like I really love the translation that happened in the next illustration
Thank you and really well done to know albrech again
thank you very much



## 4_03 Rose Caille
------------------------
So welcome to this illustration from Rose Kaya
And I love this one
I love as well that in this one
as well as having the illustration
we have a beautiful animation
YeahI love seeing the 3D animation mixed with the 2D animation
I think that's something people were really interested in and seeing that frame by frame
puffs of smoke along with this really smooth 3D is really lovely
Yeah
and you know
like when we received this illustration that we have in here
we had to decide what were we going to do
Like we didn't know which parts were going to be 3D
which parts were going to be 2D
and maybe even which parts were not present
I think that I really love how this illustration was very flat
but it had a bit of texture
a bit of gradients made here with this noise
And I thought it was a shame if we were going to lose that in 3D
On the other hand
I thought that many of the shapes
including the wheels and the motorbike and how this felt ter would be a shame not to show that we had made it in 3D
So it was a different approach is very different from Noi
which we made an illustration that looked exactly like the original in this one
We did a reinterpretation
something that I really love about this illustration as well
There's all of the details that are inside of it
seeing how she has on the motorbike
that little flower sticker and the cross there
And I think the colors are really nicely contained
but it's full of detail and I think that's what looks super nice when you get into 3D
Yeah
when we go here
back to the illustration
see that everything got translated
Actuallyevery single element ended up being there
You know
the flowers are there
the bird is there
and even the elements that were in the illustration
like the little details are just appearing on this
And to generate the effect of the speed happening
And those are simply some grease pencil layers that are being multiplied again and again
and we are using the same effect
The time of to change at which time they appear
So we only animated 1
and then we repeat it again and again
And we are generating that speed in the illustration
just like you did with the little Zs
in exactly the same effect
The other thing that we have
ohby the way
I love that you can put in misshaped materials
And if you are using Eev
the only thing you need to go is I actually right now
Now we activate it in cycles up
but like we can use Eev all the time
I did a cycle test
but like when we go in evol see here you have bloom
So when I have bloom
what I can do is if I have an emission material
I can make it to look as if it's just glowing my entire scene
You can only do this in evol
can not do it in cycles
In cycles
you need to do it with post processing
But I love that you can do this effect in evol
and it works so well
and it's generating this super cool look for illustrations
If the lights are just emanating so much
The other details I want to talk about is how the hair was created
The hair was created simply using metal metabolism
if you've never used them before
are super useful
I'm going to just save this illustration
make a new project for a second
and I'm going to delete my cube and my metabolism basically work like this
I'm going to add a metabolite
add a ball
and you can just create copies or either you create a copy Ctrl C
Ctrl V of the metabolism
then you move here
or you can as well if you are in edit mode
if you select the object
you can do Shift D and just start creating copies of it
But you see
as I'm creating copies I'm generating this soft transition between my shapes and then inside the metabolite here
you can change how much the resolution happens on the viewer and on the render
So you could have less resolution on the viewer if your computers have been a slower and have a smaller distance on the render
So it's
I mean
the smoother when you are done with the project
But you can see the shorter I make my resolution
the smoother and smoother the stuff looking
So now that we understand how the hair was created
we're going to be seeing how the hair was animated
not only the hair
but many of the elements you see that we are having here
Even I love the effect that is happening on the little bird
I love looking at it from close up because you can see the movement from the wind
And some people might think that that's very complex to animate
but that's so simple
The only thing we are applying there and I can select my bird
I can have it here
And the only thing I'm doing with my bird is I'm going to add a wave effect
And you can see here exactly the settings I can show them here
I just play it with them
You know
you have a speed
you can make it animate is lower
This effect as well is cycling
that means like cycling or cycling
I don't cycling
so it's repeating all the time and again and again
And we can do different weight
So I could do something very saturated with here
I'm starting to show and break the effect
or I can make it quite soft and you can see that this effect obviously works better when I have more subdivisions
but I was trying to do not that many subdivisions for to be able to play well
But then you can do more subdivisions for the render when we finish the illustration
when we go to render it out
you can have more subdivisions
But in reality at this distance
I thought that there was no need for more
You're getting that wind effect
and then I went through every single element
including these arms
and I just did the same
I applied the wave and it is generating this effect looking like the clothes are flowing with the wind
That's really lovely
How did you know about the wave effect
How did you think to use that one specifically
OhI was just starting playing with them
I was just going around being like
what can I use to not to have to animate frame by frame something and it to look good
And I found that wave effector
like there are so many effectors
and sometimes I Google things when I don't know
like I haven't used some of them
but I think that if they are
there is because at some point they will become useful
So I don't think you should learn them all
I think you can incorporate them as you go
Yeahthat makes sense
It's really lovely as well to see because I feel like it looks exactly like I would imagine the 3D result would look
but so much more seemed to be trial and error
Yeah
and the other thing that we have in here is these papers
And these papers are also using the wave effector
You can see that they are bending in the air
but they have something else as well as the wave effector that you can see that there are all these lines that are following paths
And this follow path is super easy to make and is very useful
For example
we're making a car that is going around the circuit
Or if we are making
in this case
some papers that are flying from the motorbike
So in order to have them
you can see that each of these papers are having in here in the object constraint
I have a follow path
You see that there
and then I have an offset on the follow path
so I'm gon na do it in a new project so people know what I was doing
So I'm going to make I'm going to make
instead of a cube I'm going to make a plan so people can see already how this was made
And I'm going to go to my edit mode and remember the wave effector doesn't work if there are no subdivisions
So you need to do click and do a few subdivisions and then click and do a few subdivisions
If not
is not going to show
Now I'm going to go into my modifiers and I'm going to add a wave modifier
And now hopefully
if everything goes well
when I go to object mode
we already have that effect
you know
And the wave modifier
you can see that now is applying from the middle
You can only do one of the sides
So if now you do
one of the sides is applying like a flat
Okay
so I have my plane flying already
what is the next thing I need to do
The next thing I need to do is my plan to be following some path
So I'm going to add a curve and I'm going to add a the Seer curve
and I'm going to tap
press top and scale it
I'm going to scale it
and maybe I'm going to rotate it because I think it makes more sense to look a bit more
Like with Ctrl
I can do increments of 5 and I'm gon na have
Imagine that this is the beginning of my motorbike tour is going to be there
and then my paper is gonna go and fly up and then go down
I could
you know
change the shape
Just pressing E
I can make more points and I can move them as well in the 3D space so I can make some of the papers to go backwards and some to go front
And now the only thing I need to do is go to my plane
go to my constraints
and then I can do a follow path
Where I do follow path
here you are
and now I need to save the target
The target is of the Sr curve that I have in there
And now I did
I did the follow path on my the year curve
You see the accident I did
you can see that the effect applied in the busier curve
but in reality I should do it in my plane
not in the busier curve because the plane
what is gonna follow the path
So now I'm gonna do the same again
The plane should be the one having this gear
It looks like the gears from a bicycle
And now I'm going to select my VR curve
So now I know that my paper is following my VCR curve
If I do
offset is going to go from one place to another
fantasticand then I have a few different things
you know
I can do follow curve
That means that now the paper is pointing towards the curve
So it curves with the curve
That's looking much better
So if you have it moving a bit up and down like that
your paper is going to do the exactly
So I don't need to be rotating myself
the paper
the paper now is working well
And then the next thing I can do is add a keyframe at the beginning in my offset and a keyframe
I'm only going to do this 20 frames
So I can add another keyframe at the end
There we are
put another keyframe
And now when I play I'm getting it by effect
Fantasticand you just have that several times to have lots of papers from
I have several times what I did
by the way
because I know that at the beginning I wanted them to appeare from the
from the box
from the little folder
and I didn't want to have any problems like
I don't know
having to come out from the folder and it's not visible
So the only thing I do is that they scale them up
You see at the beginning
they are really tiny and then they scale them up very quickly
and then they continue through the scene
Sometimes those simple solutions are enough because your brain covers the rest
you see how you just imagine that probably they are appearing
but in reality
it's just a simple scale
You completely do
And at the end
how is it that they disappeared exactly the same
When they reach the end
You can see here in each of my planes
I get to the end and I scale them down completely
and not only I scale them down
I think actually what I do as well
as well as scaling them down
you can change the disability of the paper

I don't know exactly what it is
I'm gon na try to show here
You see here I do a scale down
so I have a few keyframes here
but the other thing I do
and I don't know why it's disappearing
Ohit disappears because then invisibility
I have a keyframe saying
showing viewport
showing render
and then in 100
I made that only two keyframes that doesn't show in viewport or renders
and there is a bit of a CLT in this program because now when I get here
all the keyframes disappear because the program is like I'm not seeing anything
And that's why it's kind of a bit confusing
And now I need to select it again
but it's simply that I told the program to make the optic disappear
That's a clever trick
okaynow that we have that I can tell you that the rest was done
the arms were made with the same cube technique
starting from spline that we've done in our course on how to brake
how to model in Blender
So if you've done that
you have it and the motorbike started from a cube
Wheels are simple toruses that are in there and the smoke was done with frame by frame animation in a grease pencil layer in which I use a fill in white
Okay
like we've just learned how to do
Yeahand the only little thing that we have that we haven't really covered much in this course
we will have an entire course dedicated at some point on how to do painting
on painting textures is that we paint all these textures in the program
but so far I had to use a little We're going to put the link of the brushes we use
we bought them
it's only 5 dollars
we bought them from someone else that they sell them on
I have don't know if it's gum road or another of this website
but we want to generate at some point a library inside
but at the school
so people don't have to pay those 5 dollars
But so far
the only thing I did is using those brushes to generate these little dots
So I'm going to link
I'm going to put a link to the brush we use from there
but in order to do that
like we've done in other courses
we simply selected the geometry where you be unwrapped like we did in the beginning of this course
And then we painted on top with the texture
So that was basically it
The rest is just spending time and putting some love on it
Yeah
it's really nice to see that all of the same techniques that we've been teaching in every course are applied to this illustration and even if every character looks so different they all come from the same cube
I really hope that people do something that I love doing
This is such a privilege to be able to access this file
So I hope you go through the file and start exploring experimenting
Sometimes even I find that sometimes people ask us questions they like
ohwhy is this thing not being used
And it's because on the way of making it
we ended up just getting rid of something
So I think it's good sometimes to see how the process of the creation of this was made
because not everything is being used
not everything that we tried work
And I think that's the way you should do when you are making your illustrations and turning them into 3D
A lot of experimenting
Try to get all the knowledge you've been getting through all courses and applying it to your straight
I think that's completely true
And if you're trying to make something that looks new and unique
then you probably have to do some experimentation yourself
Yes100 percent
and we can't wait to see all of your results
please share them with us
And big well done again to Rose Kai for her beautiful TD character
And in the next lesson
we're gonna take a completely different style of illustration that was done using Gris pencil
but I think that was very
a good example of how grease pencil is so flexible because the other illustration just doesn't look at all of these ones
We'll see you then
bye

And he had a very different style
I'm going to show here the style that she had
Her illustration was like this
and I really loved how this illustration had so many little details
like all these dots to generate shadows
I love the colors of the illustration
how graphical the character is
but of course
it was a big challenge
You know
at the beginning we were thinking
are we going to translate like these outlines in the illustration
And we tried
we tried different things and this is the final result
Yeah
I really like the position as well this character is in
It's kind of interesting translating that position into 3D
I think
because the proportions of the face is slightly different from how a realistic face would be
You know
the positioning of the mouth and the one cheek being slightly bigger than another
And I think it's interesting to see that translation so directly
Yeah
to be honest
this illustration works very well if you rotate it even here
But if you start going this way
starts breaking
you see around this area
just like it doesn't look good
Like I think up to from here to here is looking quite good
And I like that
I like that allows for some level of movement around
but in the moment it what it breaks
it just breaks
Okay
let's look at some of the things we did
This animates a bit
We have some animation here for the text that's appearing saying hello
And also we have some animation happening in the cable
And I love that we also have some animation happening
some boiling happening on the on these hat that looks like a
is this an apple
I thought maybe as well could be a Toto
I don't know
it's some fruit
But like we are having this illustration with a lot of boiling effects happening
But the main thing how everything started with with modeling and the way to do it with modeling was just I went into a front view
I started with a cube and I slowly started extruding using the techniques we use
Everything started from my cube
And then in the moment where I was comfortable with how it was looking
but it was not perfect
I just applied all the subdivisions of the cube
and then I went into sculpting
And then when we arrived into sculpting
I started
I only used cree-english bit of this elastic deformation grab
and then I used a lot of inflate
So I started doing for the breast
I started doing a bit of inflation and pinching it to just have all the modifications I wanted
And then for this neck
for example
I just started from a cylinder and I extruded some of the corners of the cylinder to generate this flower effect and the same for the head
You know
you see that this is exactly the same
There's a bit of inflation here
a bit of Cree inflation here
The nose started from a cube
I just want you to know that there were no tricks here
This is only just going bit by bit sculpting all the elements
I was about to say that it sounds not real
it sounds like there must be some kind of hidden trick somewhere
but that's exactly how it was made
And I think that can be quite a nice thing for people to realize as well
The more that you practice and the more that you understand looking at 3D objects in the real world as well
the better you can understand modeling
And you're wondering
how is grease pencil useful in this
Project is useful in many ways
One of them is that
for example
you can have this boiling in this cable
This is was drawn in completely flat way
And then because of how a grosbeak
you can then go into sculpt mode
do your grab mode
and start kind of bending the cable and putting it behind the hand
And I love that
I love that grease pencil allows for these 3D
it's last to the movement of the objects
AlsoI love that you can have these shadows that are just little dots that I have sputter around here and they boil
and that effect
I think is beautiful and a 3D illustration I've never seen before
to be honest
I've never seen something like that
Same here
this you see
you can have all of these effects that are applying
they're just applying a noise
but then I have have all the things if I go to my final render mode
and I have I have it here and that should be look like that I'm gonna deactivate my scene like in a scene world because I just want to use the automatic lighting
I can apply
Do you see that there is this double layer that it looks yellow and it looks red on the front and it goes with the animation
it works completely fine that is coming from this original illustration and it's so easy to do so the only thing you need to do is
and remember that in order to see those effects
you need to be viewport shading mode
But if I select it here
one of the effects that I have is called shadow
but a shadow can be any color
so it's just a creative way of using the shadow you made the black
it's just a shadow that you have for the effect
But if you make your shadow that low color
subtlyyou're having the look that the original illustration had
and I love that type of flexibility
I'm still discovering how to use the kind of mill option that grease stencil has because look at all these effects for sure at some point it's going to be useful to have this pixelate effect that is going to pixelate our entire illustration know like different effects can be used in different situations
And I think that what I like is just looking at them and then discovering slowly when are they useful or when I'm gon Na use them
YeahI think that's really interesting too
and sometimes you might accidentally come across something like that pixelate
and then at some point you'll think
ohyeah
I remember that all exactly
If you're wondering why didn't use this effect like wrist pencil for the eyes is because so far it doesn't work well with transparency
So when I drew it
then I couldn't see a bit of the eyes through the transparency
I wanted to be able to see it there
So I did it with a normal
painting it with a brush
I just UV unwrapped the entire head
and then I painted bit by bit
And the same he things here for the for my banana
I did the same
And then for my hand
I simply made the same effect
I just made some bones and I can just show here with transparency
And I just made some bones
and then I parented them with automatic weights
And then I have suddenly this hand that it's actually raked
which it's not something that we are
you know
like we're showing off much
But in reality
you could just rotate these fingers and they can rotate with the illustration
You know
like we could Riga
make our our animation
a little animation with the character
Maybe it's kind of coming to grab the phone or doing whatever
Besides that
this illustration
I think is quite simple in the way was animated
The only thing that maybe some people are going struggle with is just doing this frame by frame animation in which I transform this speech bubble into a circle
But that's just done in frame by frame
Maybe at some point we're gonna talk a bit more about different effects to animated transitions or fire or effects in frame by frame
But there are so many references on the internet that you can find out your favorite style of animation
I recommend looking at them frame by frame
You can download them and go frame by frame and check how it was made
Great idea
Besides that
do you have any other questions about this one
I was wondering how you chose the level of detail to add on to the 3D character because there are some extra details in the 2D
say on the banana or in the hair there
and how did you choose how much to put in 3D
This is about your personal choice
Would you like
would you think that is gonna work
I don't have an answer for that
but I do agree at some point when we started putting some of those lines in the hair
it started feeling 2 BC 2 crowded
you know
So it's a personal choice
The same thing with
you know
the shadows here are not painted
are the natural shadows that occur with the ambient occlusion
but the shadows in here are painted and they are boiling and that's just a decision
it's an artistic decision that might be different
You know
if Natalia starts making this illustration in 3D herself
she might have different decisions
YeahI think it's interesting for people to start actually thinking of the 3D illustration
how it translates from the 2D illustration
what the differences and similarities are and how you're keeping the same spirit
that's sort of what we wanted to cover a lot in this course as well
not only the technical aspects of how you model certain things and how you use the grease pencil
but also what you're actually deciding to translate and how you're doing that
YeahI think a lot of people think that the technical bit is the most relevant one or that there is some secret button or something that turns things into 3D that's not the case
You know
we go case by case and that's why the illustrations look unique and special and they end up
you know
if this
even if they started been made by Natalia
it has in the end a bit of a cabeza patata look because we transformed it and I think that that's an important thing
the more you improve as a 3D artist
the more you're going to be able to put your personal touch on everything you make
even if you're translating someone else's illustration
you're going to be able to put to a little detail
probably we went more pastel with this colors than in the original illustration from Natalie because of how we like these pastel colors
the color palette kind of gets slowly shifted and moved towards what you like and I really want people to start exploring 3D in that way
you know
remember 3D is not something that touch from the rest of the art if you like something you can apply it to 3D I completely agree and with that thank you so much for following up here
this was so nice to have this illustration from Natalia
thank you so much for sending it and well done everyone
thank you for following along with the course and please share your results and even share your 2D illustrations
if you have any questions for us or for any of the other students about recommendations for how you might transform it into 3D
just let us know
yeahand please continue sharing your work
It's just how we learn
What people want is how we discover if actually people understood what was happening
And we love seeing translations like this
love to see everyone's do the illustrations
transforming 3D using grease pencil
Thanks everyone
bye
