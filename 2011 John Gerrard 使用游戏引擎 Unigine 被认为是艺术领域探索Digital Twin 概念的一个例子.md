One prominent example of practice is the British artist John Gerrard, who uses the game engine Unigine to create surreal simulated landscapes (Figure 6b).  
一个突出的实践例子是英国艺术家 John Gerrard，他使用游戏引擎 Unigine 创建超现实的模拟景观（图 6b）。

Gerrard states that while there is always the concept of duration in traditional cinema, his work, though still visually presented as video, is theoretically endless because of the use of real-time simulation techniques [73].  
杰拉德表示，虽然传统电影中始终存在持续时间的概念，但他的作品虽然仍以视频形式呈现，但由于使用了实时模拟技术，理论上是无穷无尽的[73]。

This idea is best reflected in one of his early works, One Thousand Year Dawn (2005), in which the simplistic image shows a character standing on a beach facing a sunrise that is set to take a thousand years to complete.  
这个想法在他的早期作品《一千年黎明》（2005 年）中得到了最好的体现，其中简单的图像显示了一个角色站在海滩上，面对着需要一千年才能完成的日出。

Many of Gerrard’s recent works feature meticulously reconstructed virtual representation of industrial and agricultural facilities, such as data centers, solar power plants, and pig farms, often in remote and uninhabited locations.  
杰拉德最近的许多作品都精心重建了工业和农业设施的虚拟表现，例如数据中心、太阳能发电厂和养猪场，通常位于偏远和无人居住的地方。

Gerrard "simulates" the form and dynamics of these facilities, while the time-of-day and weather in the images are synchronised with the location of the facility.  
杰拉德“模拟”[[simulates]]了这些设施的形式和动态，而图像中的时间和天气与设施的位置同步。

He conceptualises these works as digital portraits of such facilities.  
他将这些作品概念化为这些设施的数字肖像。

During the production process, the artist’s team took thousands of photographs in the fields around the facilities, which were then used to reconstruct the sites as detailed virtual environments.  
在制作过程中，艺术家团队在设施周围的田野中拍摄了数千张照片，然后将这些照片重建为详细的虚拟环境。

In this sense, Gerrard’s work can be considered an example of the exploration of the concept of the [[数字孪生 Digital twin]] within the field of art.  
从这个意义上说，杰拉德的作品可以被认为是艺术领域探索数字孪生概念的一个例子。
