  abstract = {ABSTRACT             In this study, structural equation modeling is applied to examine the determinants of students' satisfaction and their perceived learning outcomes in the context of university online courses. Independent variables included in the study are course structure, instructor feedback, self-motivation, learning style, interaction, and instructor facilitation as potential determinants of online learning. A total of 397 valid unduplicated responses from students who have completed at least one online course at a university in the Midwest were used to examine the structural model. The results indicated that all of the antecedent variables significantly affect students' satisfaction. Of the six antecedent variables hypothesized to affect the perceived learning outcomes, only instructor feedback and learning style are significant. The structural model results also reveal that user satisfaction is a significant predictor of learning outcomes. The findings suggest online education can be a superior mode of instruction if it is targeted to learners with specific learning styles (visual and read/write learning styles) and with timely, meaningful instructor feedback of various types.},

  abstract = {Purpose -- The objective of this paper is to further explore relationships among social influence, blog platform qualities and usage intention for improving the understanding of the effect that social influence exerts on bloggers' usage intention. Design/methodology/approach -- Based on the IS success model, the authors propose a conceptual framework incorporating information quality, system quality, blog function quality and social influence as key determinants of bloggers' usage intention. Empirical data from 613 participants were collected via a web survey. Findings -- The results show that information quality, system quality and blog function quality, i.e. the technical factors, positively influence bloggers' usage intention. Among these qualities, system quality is the most prominent. For social factors, social influence significantly affects bloggers' usage intention directly and indirectly through blog platform qualities. A multi-group analysis revealed the differences between blog readers and writers in the perceptions of blog platform qualities and the intensity of path coefficients among factors in the conceptual model. Practical implications -- Results from this study can be used as guidance for blogging service providers to enhance and develop blog platform functions. Moreover, the differences between blog readers and writers revealed in the findings can help service providers to develop campaigns to strengthen their usage intention accordingly. Originality/value -- This paper advances the understanding of the effects of social influence on users' perception of information system qualities as well as usage intention. Social influence exhibits strong effects on users' perception of blog platform qualities. Specifically social influence not only directly affects bloggers' usage intention but also has an indirect effect on intention through the mediation of blog platform qualities.},

  abstract = {The current study explores the students' behavioral intention to use social media and actual social media use in higher education, specifically the perception of their academic performance and satisfaction. The study is theoretically based on the technology acceptance model (TAM) with evaluation information system success models (ISSM). Theoretically, five independent constructs were identified as contributory to behavioral intention to use social media, and actual social media use towards the students' satisfaction and performance impact was analyzed. A questionnaire survey based on the technology acceptance model (TAM) and information system success model (ISSM) was utilized as the key method for collecting data and disseminated to 1200 students from four public universities of Malaysia chosen through a random sampling technique. For data analysis, the SPSS and structural equation modeling (SEM-Amos) were used. Outcomes obtained from the students' behavioral intention to use and actual social media usage indicates a positive and constructive influence on satisfaction and academic performance in higher education. In addition, both male and female students were satisfied with perceived usefulness ({$\beta$} = 0.095, t-value = 3.325, p {$<$} 0.001 and {$\beta$} = -0.045, t-value = -2.079, p {$<$} 0.001, respectively), perceived ease of use ({$\beta$} = 0.108, t-value = 3.29, p {$<$} 0.001 and {$\beta$} = 0.307, t-value = 12.365, p {$<$} 0.001, respectively), perceived technology fit ({$\beta$} = 0.14, t-value = 4.769, p {$<$} 0.001 and {$\beta$} = 0.277, t-value = 12.358, p {$<$} 0.001, respectively), information quality ({$\beta$} = 0.108, t-value = 3.825, p {$<$} 0.001 and {$\beta$} = 0.109, t-value = 5.087, p {$<$} 0.001, respectively), and system quality ({$\beta$} = 0.232, t-value = 7.573, p {$<$} 0.001 and {$\beta$} = 0.176, t-value = 7.429, p {$<$} 0.001, respectively). Therefore, we encourage students to use social media for educational purposes and encourage more interactions with peers at higher education institutions. The study's empirical findings present strong support for the integrative association between the TAM and the ISSM in using online learning platforms to improve students' academic achievements and satisfaction. This could help decision makers in universities, higher education institutions, and colleges to plan, evaluate, and implement online learning platforms in their institutions.},
