Based on your notes, it appears that you have written a response to the question "Do you think it is important to do some preparation before you travel to new places?" You have organized your response using the "First be agreeable - explain why - make a contrast - provide an example - find a balance" framework. You have also provided examples of words and phrases related to travel, preparation, and bags. However, it seems that you have not directly addressed the question about the importance of preparation for a specific topic such as a DIY vape guide or a research paper. If you need help with that, I can certainly provide some guidance. For example, for a DIY vape guide, you might want to emphasize the importance of researching the materials and equipment needed, understanding safety precautions, and following instructions carefully. For a research paper, you might want to stress the importance of conducting thorough research, developing a clear thesis, and adhering to the journal's manuscript requirements.
