A very relevant topic! 😊

Here are some article notes related to the sentence "制定一个全面的检索策略，以确保能够找到所有相关的研究。" (Formulate a comprehensive search strategy to ensure that all relevant research can be found.)

**Article:** "Developing a Search Strategy" by the National Institute of Health (NIH)

**Summary:**

* A well-designed search strategy is crucial for identifying all relevant studies in a literature search.
* A comprehensive search strategy should include multiple databases, search terms, and filters to minimize bias and ensure that all relevant studies are captured.
* The strategy should be tailored to the specific research question and population of interest.

**Key points:**

1. **Define the research question**: Clearly articulate the research question or objective to guide the search strategy.
2. **Identify relevant databases**: Search multiple databases, including PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, and relevant grey literature sources.
3. **Develop search terms**: Use a combination of keywords, MeSH terms, and Boolean operators to capture relevant studies.
4. **Apply filters**: Use filters such as study design, publication date, and language to refine the search results.
5. **Evaluate search results**: Critically appraise the search results to ensure that all relevant studies are included.
6. **Iterate and refine**: Refine the search strategy as needed based on the search results and feedback from experts.

**Additional resources:**

* The Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions (Chapter 5: Searching for studies)
* The PRISMA-P Statement (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis Protocols)
