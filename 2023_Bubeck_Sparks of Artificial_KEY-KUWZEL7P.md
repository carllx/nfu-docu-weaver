> Artificial intelligence (AI) researchers have been developing and refining [[LLMs|large language models]] (LLMs) that exhibit remarkable capabilities across a variety of domains and tasks, challenging our understanding of learning and cognition. The latest model developed by OpenAI, GPT-4, was trained using an unprecedented scale of compute and data. In this paper, we report on our investigation of an early version of GPT-4, when it was still in active development by OpenAI. We contend that (this early version of) GPT-4 is part of a new cohort of LLMs (along with ChatGPT and Google's PaLM for example) that exhibit more general intelligence than previous AI models. We discuss the rising capabilities and implications of these models. We demonstrate that, beyond its mastery of language, GPT-4 can solve novel and difficult tasks that span mathematics, coding, vision, medicine, law, psychology and more, without needing any special prompting. Moreover, in all of these tasks, GPT-4's performance is strikingly close to human-level performance, and often vastly surpasses prior models such as ChatGPT. Given the breadth and depth of GPT-4's capabilities, we believe that it could reasonably be viewed as an early (yet still incomplete) version of an artificial general intelligence (AGI) system. In our exploration of GPT-4, we put special emphasis on discovering its limitations, and we discuss the challenges ahead for advancing towards deeper and more comprehensive versions of AGI, including the possible need for pursuing a new paradigm that moves beyond next-word prediction. We conclude with reflections on societal influences of the recent technological leap and future research directions.

> <span class="highlight" style="background-color: [[ffd400]]">Text-to-image synthesis models have been widely explored in recent years, but they often suffer from a lack of spatial understanding capabilities and the inability to follow complex instructions [GPN+22]. For example, given a prompt such as “draw a blue circle on the left and a red triangle on the right”, these models may produce images that are visually appealing but do not match the desired layout or colors. On the other hand, GPT-4 can generate code from a prompt, which can be rendered as an image, in a way that is true to the instructions to a higher degree of accuracy. However, the quality of the rendered image is usually very low. Here, we explore the possibility of combining GPT-4 and existing image synthesis models by using the GPT-4 output as the sketch. As shown in Figure 2.8, this approach can produce images that have better quality and follow the instructions more closely than either model alone. We believe that this is a promising direction for leveraging the strengths of both GPT-4 and existing image synthesis models. It can also be viewed as a first example of giving GPT-4 access to tools, a topic we explore in much more depth in Section 5.1.</span>  
> 文本到图像的合成模型已经被广泛探索，但它们往往缺乏空间理解能力，无法遵循复杂的指令[GPN+22]。例如，给定一个提示，如 "在左边画一个蓝色的圆，在右边画一个红色的三角形"，这些模型可能会产生视觉上吸引人的图像，但不符合所需的布局或颜色。另一方面，GPT-4可以从提示中生成代码，这些代码可以被渲染成图像，其方式与指令的真实程度更高。然而，渲染的图像的质量通常很低。在这里，我们通过使用GPT-4的输出作为草图，探索将GPT-4和现有的图像合成模型相结合的可能性。如图2.8所示，这种方法可以产生质量更好的图像，并且比单独的任何一个模型都更接近指令。我们认为这是一个有希望的方向，可以利用GPT-4和现有图像合成模型的优势。它也可以被看作是让GPT-4获得工具的第一个例子，我们将在第5.1节中更深入地探讨这个问题。 ([p18](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/BCA4EPXC?page=18&annotation=ETMTBXAW))
