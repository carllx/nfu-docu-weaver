(00:00) [Music] one [Music] so hello hello hello it's captain panic speaking and welcome to another touch designer tutorial this time we will have a look at how to create a watercolor painting out of any image you put into this setup so it works with this hand or it's pretty cool with landscapes too and we will have a look at how to create this kind of blurred out version which looks like you used more water in your watercolor
(01:04) and then i have this more detailed version and i also have a version where you have a little bit of structure and it's more like a gouache or oil painting maybe i'm not that familiar with the colors but i feel like it looks like you used a color with structure so um yeah as always we start from scratch and i will see you on my screen there we go and i already loaded in my image and set it to my resolution and connected it to the background so we can see what's going on so um the first thing we need to do is bring some more structure into this
(02:05) image and we do so by adding some grain so what we will do is insert a comp after outfit and out of that fit we head into a noise and we change the noise type from simplex 3d to random gpu so you can see this just creates a random kind of grain using our color coordinates so when we connect this to our comp we get some some grain on here um and right now i'm going to keep all those parameters on default we might make some changes later okay so then i will add another after this comp since we are heading into a feedback loop now
(03:05) and i will create a composite here so um this composite will have the operation mode maximum and then out of that now let's put our feedback in connect this to the comp make this one the target layer and when we play we see nothing and this is completely fine since we will insert some stuff now and since we're using is the limit there's nothing going on so now let's bring in some movement and we do that by adding a displace after our feedback and let's change the displace weight to another point 991 for now and now let's take care of the map we are
(04:07) going to use to displace so um out of that feedback i will create a a noise and change the output to noise so we just take the resolution of this feedback into our noise here and also i will animate that noise so we'll type abs time dot seconds and i'm going to multiply it with null point null one so it's it has movement but it's barely there so just really really slightly and then i will copy that noise since we will need two noises which we will combine to displace so um let's have a look at the parameters of
(05:13) our first noise so i want a lot of details so i will bring up the harmonics to 10 and in our second noise i will bring the harmonics to 10 too and in the second noise i'm changing the seat to something else so we don't have the same noise twice and then out of the first noise we head into a reorder and our second noise will be the second input of the reorder and since our displacement only uses red and blue we don't need any green input so the output of the green will be set to zero and then we want to bring in the second
(06:04) noise we have here right now we are only using the first noise because we only have input 1 here so for our blue input which will be the vertical source for the displacement we will change to input two so now we combine those two noises in one web which we can use to displace so let's bring this in here and now we can already see some effect going on and right now our displacement is kind of cool but i want it to be even more detailed and have more of this watercolor feeling and to get even more details we will copy each of these noises
(06:55) and let's give us some space here and we will use so for this noise we'll go into the second input of this noise so you can see it creates a a noise out of this noise and the same thing we will do with our second noise just use this and plug it in here and then we will change this to our first input this one to our second input and now you can already see we have more detail going on so when we pulse our feedback it gives us this really fine details which is basically already a watercolor fee excuse me i've been joking
(07:50) um i won't cut it out you just have to live with this weird noise you might know i love noise so um yeah and now i want to blur those edges a little bit more so it's it's like the one i showed in the beginning so we have this more water in our watercolor and actually what i'm going to do too is insert a keyboard in chop so we can reset our feedback using our key one so we can start that over and over again since it's so cool um okay um you might hear that my pc is going a little bit great crazy i don't know why exactly but yeah
(08:52) okay so let's continue and [Music] let's bring in some more blur and we will do that by bringing in a blur okay so now you can see we get those more blurred out edges which are really cool but a little bit too heavy so i bring this down to two so it's really just slightly since now we will insert another displace to give us even more details and more fading out so bring in a displays and once again we set this this place to a really low per meter so now 0.
(09:50) 991 is fine and then we give us some some space here and then out of this displays we head into a comp and we will use our null here as the second input for the comp set the operation mode to soft light and then head into a slope and change this to strength five and step sample step five five and then let's plug this one in here and now we have more a little bit more details and evolution in our displacement so it's kind of if we set this to a higher higher number you can see it a little bit better so we get more evolution and those colors mix into each other
(10:54) pretty well when you insert that second display so it adds some really nice details and fluffiness to our watercolor so okay and now let's have a look at how to insert a little bit of structure in here so we have those oil painting feelings so this is actually pretty easy and we'll insert a composite and out of this i will add into a emboss change the strength to 12.
(11:37) so really high and then go up with the midpoint and just plug it into our composite and there we go so um now you can play with that midpoint until you like it also the direction of your structure out of which way you want the light to come so this is kind of cool to give the whole thing a little bit of 3d feeling so it's more analog and yeah okay one thing i forgot is the thing where we add even more water so i will just use my more blurry version again and then i will insert into the feedback loop another blur but this time not just a blur
(12:32) but i luma blur instead and the second input which will define where to blur that image will be a noise heading out of that displace so create a noise change the output to noise use this one as a second input too and plug it in here now and then turn up the black filter with and then you can already see wherever it's black here we blur that image here so if i set this really high you can see we blur nearly everything but if we work with a pretty low number we get some nice blurred out areas and some are not blurred out so it's
(13:26) more of this random irregular feeling you have with watercolor and to have a little bit of more of control you could change the exponent to null so you have this kind of thresholded image where you can play with the seat to have a better look and sharper edges which can define this a little bit better so um yeah basically that's it about the technique i wanted to show um it's pretty cool with every image i didn't find any image which didn't work and also it's pretty cool with movies or abstract shapes and yeah i hope you can use this in the future
(14:25) and i hope you liked it i hope you enjoyed it and hopefully hear you next time stay tuned and bye bye
