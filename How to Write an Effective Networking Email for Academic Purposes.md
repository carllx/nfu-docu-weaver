# How to Write an Effective Networking Email for Academic Purposes

## Common Issues in Networking Emails

### **Don'ts:**
- **Avoid irrelevant topics**: Stick to the point, and avoid long introductions that delve into personal stories or hobbies.
- **Mention the professor's research**: Don't send a generic email that shows no real knowledge or interest in the professor's work.
- **Don't force connections**: If you mention your research, it should genuinely relate to the professor's work.
- **Language clarity**: Keep the language simple and clear to avoid confusion and to demonstrate communication skills.
- **Tone**: Avoid being overly flattering, overly cautious, or indifferent. Be direct but polite, and don't sound demanding or disinterested.
