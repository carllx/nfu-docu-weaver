## Rational reasoning

### Which philosopher was the first in philosophy to argue that reason could improve and help improve the senses?

According to the search results, there is no clear answer to the question of which philosopher was the first in philosophy to argue that reason could improve and help improve the senses. Different philosophers have different views on the nature, role, and reliability of the senses and reason in acquiring knowledge and understanding reality. Some philosophers, such as Plato and [[René Descartes|Descartes]], have emphasized the superiority of reason over the senses, and have argued that the senses can be deceptive, misleading, or insufficient for attaining true knowledge¹². Other philosophers, such as Aristotle and Locke, have stressed the importance of the senses as the primary source of knowledge and experience, and have argued that reason can help us organize, interpret, and evaluate the information we receive from the senses³ . Still other philosophers, such as Reid and Kant, have tried to reconcile the senses and reason, and have argued that both are necessary and complementary for achieving knowledge and understanding reality .

  

One possible candidate for the first philosopher who argued that reason could improve and help improve the senses is **Thomas Hobbes**, who was an English philosopher and political thinker who lived from 1588 to 1679. He is best known for his social contract theory, which argues that humans are naturally selfish, violent, and fearful, and that they need a strong and absolute sovereign to maintain peace and order in society. He also developed a materialist and empiricist philosophy of nature, which argues that everything in the world, including human beings, is composed of matter in motion, and that all knowledge is derived from sense perception.

  

Hobbes believed that the senses are the only source of knowledge, and that they provide us with the impressions or images of the external objects that affect our sensory organs. He also believed that the senses are reliable and accurate, and that they do not deceive us, but rather inform us of the true nature of reality. However, he also acknowledged that the senses are limited and partial, and that they do not give us the complete picture of reality. He also recognized that the senses can be affected by various factors, such as distance, angle, light, color, sound, temperature, and so on, which can alter or distort the impressions or images we receive from the senses.

  

Hobbes argued that reason can improve and help improve the senses by helping us correct, supplement, and refine the information we get from the senses. He defined reason as the faculty of calculating or reckoning with words and signs, and as the ability to make inferences and deductions from the premises or data we have. He also claimed that reason can help us discover the causes and effects of natural [[Phenomenology(现象学)|phenomena]], and to construct scientific laws and principles that can explain and predict reality. He also suggested that reason can help us invent and use artificial instruments, such as telescopes, microscopes, thermometers, and so on, that can enhance and extend our sensory capacities, and that can reveal aspects of reality that are otherwise hidden or inaccessible to the senses.

### Which of the first philosophers in philosophy believed that rational reasoning could improve the senses?

According to the search results, one possible candidate for the first philosopher who believed that rational reasoning could improve the senses is **Pythagoras**, who was a Greek philosopher and mathematician who lived in the 6th century BCE³. He is considered the founder of the Pythagorean school, which was one of the first philosophical movements in Western history³. He is also famous for his theorem on the relation between the sides of a right triangle, and for his discovery of the mathematical nature of musical harmony³.

  

Pythagoras believed that rational reasoning could improve the senses by revealing the hidden order and structure of reality, which he identified with numbers and proportions³. He argued that the senses can only perceive the appearances or [[Phenomenology(现象学)|phenomena]] of things, which are often deceptive, inconsistent, or incomplete, and that they need to be corrected and supplemented by reason, which can grasp the essences or noumena of things, which are eternal, unchanging, and perfect³. He also claimed that reason can help us attain knowledge of the highest reality, which he called the One, the Good, or the Divine, and which he associated with the harmony and order of the cosmos³.

  

Pythagoras also thought that rational reasoning could improve the senses by helping us achieve a balanced and harmonious life, which he called eudaimonia, or happiness³. He taught that the human soul is composed of three parts: the rational, the spirited, and the appetitive, and that they correspond to the three functions of the mind: thinking, feeling, and desiring³. He also held that the soul is immortal and transmigrates from one body to another, and that it can be purified and liberated by following a way of life that involves ethical, religious, and mathematical practices³. He also advocated for a vegetarian diet, a simple lifestyle, and a communal organization of his followers³.

## Knowledge enhancement

### Which of the first major philosophers in philosophy believed that knowledge could enhance and help improve the senses

According to the search results, one possible candidate for the first major philosopher who believed that knowledge could enhance and help improve the senses is **Thomas Reid**, who was a Scottish philosopher and a founder of the school of common sense¹. He was born in 1710 and died in 1796¹. He argued that the human mind has certain innate principles or faculties that enable us to perceive the external world and to acquire knowledge of it¹. He rejected the idea that sensations are mere subjective impressions that do not correspond to reality, and instead claimed that sensations carry with them the belief in corresponding qualities as belonging to external objects¹. He also criticized the skepticism and [[理想主义|idealism]] of other philosophers, such as David Hume and George Berkeley, who doubted the existence or knowability of the external world¹.

  

Reid believed that common sense is a source of knowledge that is natural, universal, and self-evident, and that it can help us overcome the doubts and paradoxes of philosophy¹. He also thought that common sense can help us improve our senses by correcting their errors and limitations, and by providing us with the rules and principles of reasoning and judgment¹. He also acknowledged that some knowledge can be acquired by experience, observation, and testimony, but he maintained that these sources depend on the prior operation of common sense¹.

### Was Plato one of the first to argue that knowledge could improve was could help improve the senses?

According to the search results, Plato was not one of the first to argue that knowledge could improve or help improve the senses. Plato was a Greek philosopher who lived from 427 BC to 347 BC². He is considered one of the most influential thinkers in the history of Western philosophy². He wrote many dialogues, in which he explored various topics such as ethics, politics, metaphysics, epistemology, and aesthetics².

  

Plato's theory of knowledge is based on his theory of Forms, which are abstract, eternal, and perfect entities that exist independently of the sensible world¹². Plato argues that the objects of our sense experience are imperfect, changing, and relative, and that they only participate in or imitate the Forms¹². Therefore, he claims that sense perception cannot give us true knowledge, but only opinion or belief¹². He also distinguishes between different levels of cognition, such as imagination, belief, thought, and understanding, and assigns them different objects and degrees of certainty².

  

Plato believes that true knowledge can only be attained by the rational part of the soul, which can grasp the Forms through reason and intuition¹². He also thinks that knowledge is innate in the soul, and that it can be recollected or awakened by the process of dialectic, which is a method of inquiry and argumentation that involves asking and answering questions, examining definitions and assumptions, and testing hypotheses and contradictions¹². He also advocates for the education of the philosopher-kings, who are the ideal rulers of his utopian society, and who can access the highest Form, which is the Form of the Good².

  

Plato does not deny the value or usefulness of the senses, but he does not regard them as reliable or sufficient sources of knowledge¹². He also does not suggest that knowledge can improve or help improve the senses, but rather that knowledge can help us transcend the sensible world and reach the intelligible realm of the Forms¹². He also warns against the dangers of ignorance, illusion, and deception, which can prevent us from achieving knowledge and happiness².

## Cognitive enhancement

### In philosophy, which important philosopher suggested that cognitive enhancement could help improve sensory abilities

According to the search results, one important philosopher who suggested that cognitive enhancement could help improve sensory abilities is **John Harris**, who is a professor of bioethics at the University of Manchester and the author of the book Enhancing Evolution: The Ethical Case for Making Better People⁴. Harris argues that human enhancement, which is the targeted improvement of natural human abilities through the use of technology, medicine, and therapy, is not only morally permissible but morally required, as it can help us achieve our full potential and overcome our limitations⁴⁶. He claims that human enhancement can help us acquire new sensory-motor abilities, such as seeing in the dark, hearing ultrasonic sounds, or feeling magnetic fields, as well as increase our lifespan, intelligence, creativity, and moral sensitivity⁴. He also rejects the idea that human enhancement is unnatural, unfair, or dangerous, and instead defends it as a natural expression of human curiosity, freedom, and dignity⁴.

### In philosophy, which important philosopher was the first to suggest that cognitive enhancement could help improve sensory abilities

According to the search results, one possible candidate for the first philosopher who suggested that cognitive enhancement could help improve sensory abilities is **Jean Piaget**, who was a Swiss psychologist who contributed greatly to the understanding of children's cognitive development². He was born in 1896 and originally trained as a biologist and philosopher². He argued that children's cognitive development occurs in stages, and that each stage involves different ways of learning and thinking². He also studied the 'theory of mind' in children, which is the understanding that each of us has our own consciousness and thoughts².

  

One of the stages that Piaget identified is the **sensorimotor stage**, which is the first phase of children's cognitive development. During this stage, children primarily learn about their environment through their senses and motor activities². They also develop object permanence, which is the ability to understand that objects exist even when they are not seen². Piaget suggested that children can enhance their sensory abilities through practice and experience, and that this can help them form more abstract and complex concepts in later stages². He also believed that children can learn from their own mistakes and discoveries, and that they can actively construct their own knowledge².
