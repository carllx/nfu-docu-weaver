00:00:01,200 --> 00:00:02,130
- [Instructor] In this video,

2
00:00:02,130 --> 00:00:04,360
we are going to set up our camera.

3
00:00:04,360 --> 00:00:07,050
Initial goal of this combo animation

4
00:00:07,050 --> 00:00:10,360
is not to teach you how
to frame your character.

5
00:00:10,360 --> 00:00:13,410
I think the camera now will
help us take some decision

6
00:00:13,410 --> 00:00:14,950
during the position stage.

7
00:00:14,950 --> 00:00:17,560
Since I don't have a clear direction

8
00:00:17,560 --> 00:00:20,750
regarding the framing of this animation,

9
00:00:20,750 --> 00:00:23,090
it wasn't planned ahead,

10
00:00:23,090 --> 00:00:27,350
what I'm doing is that I'm
just positioning my 3D view

11
00:00:27,350 --> 00:00:29,960
and see how I can frame my character.

12
00:00:29,960 --> 00:00:34,210
Play a few frame of the
animation and see if it works.

13
00:00:34,210 --> 00:00:36,810
By default Blender 3D view is set

14
00:00:36,810 --> 00:00:39,480
to a 50 millimeter focal length.

15
00:00:39,480 --> 00:00:42,260
So this is something we
have to take in account

16
00:00:42,260 --> 00:00:45,050
whenever we are trying
to frame our character,

17
00:00:45,050 --> 00:00:47,170
pretty freely for the time being.

18
00:00:47,170 --> 00:00:50,050
On the initial pose when
I'm facing the character,

19
00:00:50,050 --> 00:00:51,320
it looks pretty cool.

20
00:00:51,320 --> 00:00:55,270
His base pose reads pretty
well and we do understand

21
00:00:55,270 --> 00:00:58,090
that his objective is the punching bag.

22
00:00:58,090 --> 00:00:59,850
But when I play the animation,

23
00:00:59,850 --> 00:01:02,150
the punches don't look that powerful

24
00:01:02,150 --> 00:01:05,370
and the character is
often hidden by the bag.

25
00:01:05,370 --> 00:01:07,940
When we have build those first poses,

26
00:01:07,940 --> 00:01:11,520
we have intentionally
created straight shapes

27
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:12,780
for our character.

28
00:01:12,780 --> 00:01:15,880
So there are big chances that those shapes

29
00:01:15,880 --> 00:01:18,160
will read well from side view.

30
00:01:18,160 --> 00:01:20,580
In this regard, we will probably

31
00:01:20,580 --> 00:01:24,840
favorize a side view for
those two initial punches.

32
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:27,810
Whether we are facing the
inside of the character

33
00:01:27,810 --> 00:01:31,660
or the outside or back of the
character, when he's punching.

34
00:01:31,660 --> 00:01:34,110
While I'm pretty convinced of the framing

35
00:01:34,110 --> 00:01:35,710
for the beginning of the combo,

36
00:01:35,710 --> 00:01:39,770
when the hook happened, I
don't feel like it reads well.

37
00:01:39,770 --> 00:01:43,630
While if I rotate the 3D
view to face the character,

38
00:01:43,630 --> 00:01:46,423
I better see the anticipation and I also

39
00:01:46,423 --> 00:01:49,540
better see the arc built by the fists.

40
00:01:49,540 --> 00:01:54,210
So I know that I will have to
transition from a side view

41
00:01:54,210 --> 00:01:56,960
to a more frontal view of the character.

42
00:01:56,960 --> 00:01:59,900
Also I think like it looks a little better

43
00:01:59,900 --> 00:02:03,920
when we get closer to the
ground to frame the hook.

44
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:06,400
The characters look more impressive

45
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:08,260
and he's dominating the view.

46
00:02:08,260 --> 00:02:10,120
Now regarding the kick,

47
00:02:10,120 --> 00:02:13,190
the anticipation looks
very good from there

48
00:02:13,190 --> 00:02:15,220
but the character get hidden by the bag

49
00:02:15,220 --> 00:02:16,710
during the kicking pose.

50
00:02:16,710 --> 00:02:19,920
And there is a lot of
verticality into the pose

51
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:23,440
so I feel like we lose a bit
the orientation of the kick.

52
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:26,550
While if we continue
rotating a bit the camera,

53
00:02:26,550 --> 00:02:29,040
we get a very interesting framing

54
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:31,750
because we can see the
eyes of our character

55
00:02:31,750 --> 00:02:35,650
in the negative space drawn
by the leg and the arm.

56
00:02:35,650 --> 00:02:37,400
We still I've have a very strong

57
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:40,030
orientation of the kicking pose,

58
00:02:40,030 --> 00:02:43,090
so it doesn't ruin all the
work we have done before.

59
00:02:43,090 --> 00:02:47,710
One thing we can do to improve
those close range action shot

60
00:02:47,710 --> 00:02:51,280
is to increase the angle of view

61
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:55,080
by reducing the focal
length of our 3D view.

62
00:02:55,080 --> 00:02:58,550
I will switch from 50 to 30 millimeters

63
00:02:58,550 --> 00:03:02,090
and while it doesn't really
improve the side view,

64
00:03:02,090 --> 00:03:04,270
when it comes to spinning strikes,

65
00:03:04,270 --> 00:03:06,470
like the hook or the kick,

66
00:03:06,470 --> 00:03:08,700
it does look way better for sure.

67
00:03:08,700 --> 00:03:12,870
The characters look stronger
and the arcs reads way better.

68
00:03:12,870 --> 00:03:16,110
Finally, that will be cool if in the end,

69
00:03:16,110 --> 00:03:18,760
the punching bag was still framed

70
00:03:18,760 --> 00:03:21,290
and projected away from the camera.

71
00:03:21,290 --> 00:03:23,130
Because it communicates the fact

72
00:03:23,130 --> 00:03:26,220
that our character has extra human power

73
00:03:26,220 --> 00:03:28,710
and he kicked so hard that he has

74
00:03:28,710 --> 00:03:31,320
broken the chains of the punching bag.

75
00:03:31,320 --> 00:03:35,410
So it does improve the
understanding of the current shot,

76
00:03:35,410 --> 00:03:37,710
so it does improve staging.

77
00:03:37,710 --> 00:03:40,590
Now regarding the camera initial position,

78
00:03:40,590 --> 00:03:43,670
here is a cool trick I've
learned from Daniel Dettol

79
00:03:43,670 --> 00:03:46,610
while I was working on
this specific animation.

80
00:03:46,610 --> 00:03:50,890
He explained me that it's
better to set the camera

81
00:03:50,890 --> 00:03:54,910
so that it rotates the
opposite way as the character.

82
00:03:54,910 --> 00:03:59,330
Our character is pivoting
around this side of the bag.

83
00:03:59,330 --> 00:04:01,830
So if we place the camera to the side

84
00:04:01,830 --> 00:04:05,030
and we follow the motion of the character,

85
00:04:05,030 --> 00:04:07,410
we will mostly be looking at his back.

86
00:04:07,410 --> 00:04:09,860
Plus in the end, we will probably have to

87
00:04:09,860 --> 00:04:12,840
revise the camera
position a little backward

88
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:16,510
to be sure that we properly
frame the kicking pose.

89
00:04:16,510 --> 00:04:19,840
But why if we place the
camera on the other side?

90
00:04:19,840 --> 00:04:23,500
We will have a continuous
rotation of the camera,

91
00:04:23,500 --> 00:04:26,660
with an easing at the end into the kick,

92
00:04:26,660 --> 00:04:30,260
and it will move the opposite
way of the character.

93
00:04:30,260 --> 00:04:33,290
So it will increase the rotation feeling.

94
00:04:33,290 --> 00:04:35,380
When you are following
a car on the highway,

95
00:04:35,380 --> 00:04:38,660
you feel like the car is pretty static.

96
00:04:38,660 --> 00:04:40,730
While when the car is running

97
00:04:40,730 --> 00:04:42,910
the opposite direction as you're,

98
00:04:42,910 --> 00:04:46,190
both speed are added on top of each other,

99
00:04:46,190 --> 00:04:48,960
and it feels like it goes super fast.

100
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:51,120
So let's add our camera.

101
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:54,580
If it's not already the
case go to your preferences,

102
00:04:54,580 --> 00:04:56,700
add on, and search for camera,

103
00:04:56,700 --> 00:04:59,570
and activate the camera, add camera rigs.

104
00:04:59,570 --> 00:05:02,050
This is the same add on we've been using

105
00:05:02,050 --> 00:05:04,910
for our squirrel character scene.

106
00:05:04,910 --> 00:05:07,350
From there make sure
you are in object mode,

107
00:05:07,350 --> 00:05:11,973
press Shift, A, go to camera,
and add a dolly camera rig.

108
00:05:14,170 --> 00:05:16,920
With the dolly camera rig object selected

109
00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:20,090
press Control, Tab to switch to pose mode.

110
00:05:20,090 --> 00:05:22,980
But we need to create an
action to control the camera.

111
00:05:22,980 --> 00:05:25,250
So I will switch to the action editor,

112
00:05:25,250 --> 00:05:28,570
create a new action,
give it a relevant name,

113
00:05:28,570 --> 00:05:30,220
and click the shield icon

114
00:05:30,220 --> 00:05:32,800
so that I'm sure I won't lose the section.

115
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:34,847
With all the camera controllers selected

116
00:05:34,847 --> 00:05:38,870
I will press I to insert the
key frame on all transformed.

117
00:05:38,870 --> 00:05:41,920
Or you can choose to use
only rotation and location

118
00:05:41,920 --> 00:05:46,040
since there is no scaling
influencing the camera frame.

119
00:05:46,040 --> 00:05:48,580
From there, I'm testing each controller

120
00:05:48,580 --> 00:05:51,870
and see what range of
motion I can have with them.

121
00:05:51,870 --> 00:05:54,940
For example, this one, I can just move it.

122
00:05:54,940 --> 00:05:57,230
I can't rotate it nor scale it.

123
00:05:57,230 --> 00:06:00,400
So I will just get rid of
all the transform channel

124
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:02,580
but the location transform channels.

125
00:06:02,580 --> 00:06:04,330
The camera offset controller

126
00:06:04,330 --> 00:06:07,570
can be moved and rotated, but not scaled.

127
00:06:07,570 --> 00:06:10,880
So I will get rid of the
scaling transform channels.

128
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:14,770
I know that the aim controller
can only be moved in space,

129
00:06:14,770 --> 00:06:17,090
it can't be rotated nor scaled,

130
00:06:17,090 --> 00:06:21,240
and the root controller
can be moved and rotated,

131
00:06:21,240 --> 00:06:22,870
but the scaling has no (indistinct)

132
00:06:22,870 --> 00:06:24,440
so I can get rid of them.

133
00:06:24,440 --> 00:06:27,560
You can basically key
frame any of the properties

134
00:06:27,560 --> 00:06:29,930
of the camera but in the end the only one

135
00:06:29,930 --> 00:06:32,300
we are going to use is the focal length.

136
00:06:32,300 --> 00:06:36,140
So I'm going to add another key
frame onto the focal length.

137
00:06:36,140 --> 00:06:39,230
From there I will switch
my secondary 3D view

138
00:06:39,230 --> 00:06:41,560
to the camera view by pressing zero.

139
00:06:41,560 --> 00:06:44,340
From there I will use the
main camera controller

140
00:06:44,340 --> 00:06:48,000
to move the camera, and the aim controller

141
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:51,120
to target whatever I want to be framed.

142
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:54,030
I advise you to only use
those two controllers,

143
00:06:54,030 --> 00:06:55,440
that's way enough.

144
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:57,220
And the less controller you will use,

145
00:06:57,220 --> 00:06:59,500
the smoother will be your camera motion.

146
00:06:59,500 --> 00:07:01,760
But my next advice is to push

147
00:07:01,760 --> 00:07:05,030
the passepartout opacity to 100%.

148
00:07:05,030 --> 00:07:07,120
This way you won't see what's out of frame

149
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:09,330
and it won't distract you.

150
00:07:09,330 --> 00:07:11,280
And what you will have on screen

151
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:13,160
will be what will be outputted

152
00:07:13,160 --> 00:07:16,120
whenever you are going
to render your animation.

153
00:07:16,120 --> 00:07:17,910
From there, animate your camera

154
00:07:17,910 --> 00:07:21,360
using the less key frame as possible.

155
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:25,200
First find the right
position for the first frame

156
00:07:25,200 --> 00:07:27,340
while the camera stays still,

157
00:07:27,340 --> 00:07:30,180
then find the position of the camera

158
00:07:30,180 --> 00:07:34,210
whenever it's facing the
character for the hook motion.

159
00:07:34,210 --> 00:07:36,690
From there reach the kicking pose

160
00:07:36,690 --> 00:07:39,529
and set the camera and the aim target

161
00:07:39,529 --> 00:07:42,150
so that you frame it as you have planned

162
00:07:42,150 --> 00:07:44,630
And whenever you are moving the 3D view.

163
00:07:44,630 --> 00:07:46,790
Then everything is about smoothing

164
00:07:46,790 --> 00:07:49,060
the motion using the graph editor.

165
00:07:49,060 --> 00:07:52,660
I must say that I'm not a
specialist of camera framing

166
00:07:52,660 --> 00:07:55,000
or camera shooting as a gameplay animator

167
00:07:55,890 --> 00:07:58,870
so I will keep it as simple as possible.

168
00:07:58,870 --> 00:08:02,670
But if you're up to, watch
as much anime reference,

169
00:08:02,670 --> 00:08:06,880
movie reference, whatever
style of animation you like,

170
00:08:06,880 --> 00:08:10,070
and try to understand how the camera move.

171
00:08:10,070 --> 00:08:11,660
This is the best way to learn.

172
00:08:11,660 --> 00:08:13,750
Just watch other animation

173
00:08:13,750 --> 00:08:16,770
and try to mimic their camera style.

174
00:08:16,770 --> 00:08:20,340
So as explained before, I'm
just setting a key frame

175
00:08:20,340 --> 00:08:25,250
on those two controllers
on the golden poses.

176
00:08:25,250 --> 00:08:29,300
I'm slightly traveling toward
the bag until frame 25.

177
00:08:29,300 --> 00:08:33,060
Then on frame 41, I'm lowering the camera,

178
00:08:33,060 --> 00:08:37,090
I'm reducing the focal
length to 30 millimeters,

179
00:08:37,090 --> 00:08:40,320
and then I make sure that
I'm facing the character.

180
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:43,500
Just focus on your current composition,

181
00:08:43,500 --> 00:08:47,300
on the current pose, on the current frame.

182
00:08:47,300 --> 00:08:50,380
Tweak the target and
tweak the camera position

183
00:08:50,380 --> 00:08:53,810
until you are happy with
what you are framing

184
00:08:53,810 --> 00:08:56,440
during the punch and
during the anticipation,

185
00:08:56,440 --> 00:08:59,560
and then go directly to the kicking pose.

186
00:08:59,560 --> 00:09:03,400
In my case, it's going to
be frame 74 and from there,

187
00:09:03,400 --> 00:09:05,820
I don't care about the camera motion

188
00:09:05,820 --> 00:09:08,420
or what it has been doing before.

189
00:09:08,420 --> 00:09:12,130
I'm just focusing on framing the character

190
00:09:12,130 --> 00:09:15,870
so that I check all the
details I wanted to have.

191
00:09:15,870 --> 00:09:19,287
I want to read the
directionality of the kick.

192
00:09:19,287 --> 00:09:21,630
But since my character is watching left,

193
00:09:21,630 --> 00:09:25,910
I want to frame him on the
right third of my camera.

194
00:09:25,910 --> 00:09:29,550
And finally, I want to make
sure that I read well his head

195
00:09:29,550 --> 00:09:34,160
in the negative space
drawn by his leg and arm.

196
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:36,670
From there I will jump on the frame

197
00:09:36,670 --> 00:09:39,090
where the bag hit the ground,

198
00:09:39,090 --> 00:09:42,060
and I will make sure that
I'm framing everything.

199
00:09:42,060 --> 00:09:43,610
From there, load the camera

200
00:09:43,610 --> 00:09:45,450
in the beginning of your animation.

201
00:09:45,450 --> 00:09:48,260
So duplicate the keys on frame zero

202
00:09:48,260 --> 00:09:51,080
until frame five or seven.

203
00:09:51,080 --> 00:09:53,810
What we don't want is
the camera to stop moving

204
00:09:53,810 --> 00:09:56,510
as the character hasn't stopped moving.

205
00:09:56,510 --> 00:09:58,970
Once you are done make
sure that you are easing

206
00:09:58,970 --> 00:10:01,360
into the different camera position.

207
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:05,390
Think of the camera as a very heavy object

208
00:10:05,390 --> 00:10:07,360
so you can move it fast,

209
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:11,430
but it won't settle into
the next pose very quickly.

210
00:10:11,430 --> 00:10:15,360
As an example, let's take
the X location channel

211
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:17,120
off the camera controller.

212
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:22,120
There is a very fast motion
between frame 25 and frame 38,

213
00:10:23,240 --> 00:10:28,240
but the camera reaches its
final position only on frame 48.

214
00:10:28,650 --> 00:10:31,730
So it's easing until frame 48.

215
00:10:31,730 --> 00:10:34,197
So basically your graph
editor will look like that.

216
00:10:34,197 --> 00:10:36,050
You will have a pose,

217
00:10:36,050 --> 00:10:38,680
then you will have a next extreme pose.

218
00:10:38,680 --> 00:10:40,700
So it could be the motion between

219
00:10:40,700 --> 00:10:42,690
the straight punch and the hook.

220
00:10:42,690 --> 00:10:45,430
And what I do to make
the camera ease is that

221
00:10:45,430 --> 00:10:48,340
I will duplicate the extreme movement

222
00:10:48,340 --> 00:10:50,740
by 10 frame for example,

223
00:10:50,740 --> 00:10:53,840
and then I will move
the value of the curve

224
00:10:53,840 --> 00:10:56,610
where the camera was supposed to stop

225
00:10:56,610 --> 00:10:59,320
towards the previous frame a little bit.

226
00:10:59,320 --> 00:11:01,990
This way the camera
will continue on moving,

227
00:11:01,990 --> 00:11:06,490
but it will slow down until
it reaches its final position.

228
00:11:06,490 --> 00:11:09,280
This is pretty easy to use
illustrate with this cube.

229
00:11:09,280 --> 00:11:11,550
When it does only two keys,

230
00:11:11,550 --> 00:11:15,090
it slows until its final
pose pretty rapidly.

231
00:11:15,090 --> 00:11:19,150
But if we modify its curve
as we did previously,

232
00:11:19,150 --> 00:11:22,270
we do feel like the cube is slowing down

233
00:11:22,270 --> 00:11:26,320
as if it was heavier so
it looks way more natural.

234
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:28,900
So now that you have your extreme poses

235
00:11:28,900 --> 00:11:31,140
for your camera controller,

236
00:11:31,140 --> 00:11:34,210
you should do this on each channels.

237
00:11:34,210 --> 00:11:36,650
The thing is that once you have created

238
00:11:36,650 --> 00:11:39,280
this easing on all your channel,

239
00:11:39,280 --> 00:11:42,660
you can perfectly switch
back to the action editor

240
00:11:42,660 --> 00:11:45,140
and offset the keys if you're not happy

241
00:11:45,140 --> 00:11:47,270
with the timing of your motion.

242
00:11:47,270 --> 00:11:50,950
But at least you have
created this natural feeling.

243
00:11:50,950 --> 00:11:54,660
But now to add some extra
detail to your camera.

244
00:11:54,660 --> 00:11:58,500
Spot the frame where your
character is hitting the bag,

245
00:11:58,500 --> 00:12:01,730
then select the aim
controller of the camera

246
00:12:01,730 --> 00:12:04,150
and select the Z location curve.

247
00:12:04,150 --> 00:12:07,500
What we'll do is that on
each impact on the bag,

248
00:12:07,500 --> 00:12:10,230
we will add a slight noise modifier

249
00:12:10,230 --> 00:12:11,940
to create a camera shape.

250
00:12:11,940 --> 00:12:14,560
To get access to the modifier stack,

251
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:17,910
make sure you have at
least one key active,

252
00:12:17,910 --> 00:12:19,510
one key you have clicked.

253
00:12:19,510 --> 00:12:22,270
From there in the modifiers panel,

254
00:12:22,270 --> 00:12:25,130
click add modifier and choose noise.

255
00:12:25,130 --> 00:12:27,820
Your whole curve will become a mess.

256
00:12:27,820 --> 00:12:30,850
So we need to restrict the frame range

257
00:12:30,850 --> 00:12:35,570
of the noise modifier by
clicking the checkbox.

258
00:12:35,570 --> 00:12:38,760
From there start your
noise on that impact frame,

259
00:12:38,760 --> 00:12:43,140
the frame 43, and end it
five or six frame later.

260
00:12:43,140 --> 00:12:45,070
And then make sure that you blend

261
00:12:45,070 --> 00:12:48,180
out of the noise over
five frame for example.

262
00:12:48,180 --> 00:12:49,870
From there, make sure you reduce

263
00:12:49,870 --> 00:12:52,000
the strength of the noise modifier

264
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,820
or the camera will shake as if

265
00:12:53,820 --> 00:12:56,100
a T Rex was entering the stage.

266
00:12:56,100 --> 00:12:58,780
The value of 0.1 should be enough.

267
00:12:58,780 --> 00:13:02,530
And this is exactly the same
setup I've created off camera.

268
00:13:02,530 --> 00:13:05,380
Then you can copy the current modifier

269
00:13:05,380 --> 00:13:06,950
by clicking this icon.

270
00:13:06,950 --> 00:13:09,430
Then you can paste it a couple of time,

271
00:13:09,430 --> 00:13:11,817
clicking the icon next to it.

272
00:13:11,817 --> 00:13:14,320
Put the next impact on the bag

273
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:18,020
and then set the second
noise modifier accordingly.

274
00:13:18,020 --> 00:13:21,090
In this case, the kick occur on frame 74

275
00:13:21,090 --> 00:13:23,630
and the noise stop on frame 80.

276
00:13:23,630 --> 00:13:27,060
And I have increased the strength to 0.2

277
00:13:27,060 --> 00:13:30,040
since the kick is a more powerful strike.

278
00:13:30,040 --> 00:13:32,390
So it makes the camera
shake a little more.

279
00:13:32,390 --> 00:13:35,170
And then for the third noise modifier,

280
00:13:35,170 --> 00:13:38,250
I've set the range around the frame 95,

281
00:13:38,250 --> 00:13:39,893
when it hits the ground.
