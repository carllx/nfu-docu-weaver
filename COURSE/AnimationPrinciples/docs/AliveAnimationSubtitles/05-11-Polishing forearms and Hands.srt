1
00:00:00,400 --> 00:00:03,780
- So this is the final
stage of this animation,

2
00:00:03,780 --> 00:00:07,350
where we will polish the
forearms and the hands.

3
00:00:07,350 --> 00:00:09,070
As we did before with the arm,

4
00:00:09,070 --> 00:00:13,000
I advise you to use the
wrist tweaker controller

5
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:14,420
to track the arcs.

6
00:00:14,420 --> 00:00:17,780
If we have a look to the final
version of this run cycle,

7
00:00:17,780 --> 00:00:21,710
we can see that the
forearm eats it's extreme

8
00:00:21,710 --> 00:00:23,850
at frame three when moving back.

9
00:00:23,850 --> 00:00:27,250
This is the moment where
the elbow is the most open.

10
00:00:27,250 --> 00:00:29,390
Then when we're studying the reference,

11
00:00:29,390 --> 00:00:33,600
we have seen that as the
elbow is reaching its extreme

12
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:35,470
on frame eight,

13
00:00:35,470 --> 00:00:39,370
the four arm is bending
inward to compensate.

14
00:00:39,370 --> 00:00:44,370
After frame eight, the elbow
or arm start to rotate forward

15
00:00:44,830 --> 00:00:49,400
and the forearm is still
closing until frame 11

16
00:00:49,400 --> 00:00:52,540
and from frame 12 to frame 15,

17
00:00:52,540 --> 00:00:56,660
the forearm is slightly
open before closing again,

18
00:00:56,660 --> 00:01:00,000
while it reaches its highest point.

19
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,980
So as we watch the references,

20
00:01:01,980 --> 00:01:05,430
we understand that it's
a little more complex

21
00:01:05,430 --> 00:01:08,090
than a simple follow-through animation.

22
00:01:08,090 --> 00:01:11,730
Forearm polished, we can
now jump to the hands.

23
00:01:11,730 --> 00:01:14,820
Only play with the rotation
channels of the hands.

24
00:01:14,820 --> 00:01:18,330
There is not that much to
track regarding the hands.

25
00:01:18,330 --> 00:01:22,500
We could track one of the knuckle joints,

26
00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:26,890
if we do want to track the
arcs of the tip of the hands.

27
00:01:26,890 --> 00:01:30,460
In my case, I jumped back to the reference

28
00:01:30,460 --> 00:01:33,810
and I'm really focusing
on using both hands.

29
00:01:33,810 --> 00:01:38,110
You can see how it dives
inward as if he was swimming.

30
00:01:38,110 --> 00:01:42,480
So my goal is not to have
this level of exaggeration,

31
00:01:42,480 --> 00:01:44,560
in this kind of swimming motion,

32
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:47,830
where he's really trying
to pull himself forward.

33
00:01:47,830 --> 00:01:50,620
Again, it does show us that the hand

34
00:01:50,620 --> 00:01:54,160
is not only dragging
back during the motion.

35
00:01:54,160 --> 00:01:55,870
So instead of showing you all,

36
00:01:55,870 --> 00:01:59,290
I've pushed each controller
in the rough editor.

37
00:01:59,290 --> 00:02:02,320
We'll have a look to the
final results on the right.

38
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:04,380
When the hand is moving forward,

39
00:02:04,380 --> 00:02:06,950
as it reaches the passing pose,

40
00:02:06,950 --> 00:02:10,040
it's relaxed as it is dragging a bit.

41
00:02:10,040 --> 00:02:14,040
This is the time where the
Z value is at its maximum.

42
00:02:14,040 --> 00:02:18,020
Then as the arm reaches
its extreme pose forward,

43
00:02:18,020 --> 00:02:20,710
the hand curves toward the head

44
00:02:20,710 --> 00:02:24,710
and as the arm comes down,
the hand drags a bit.

45
00:02:24,710 --> 00:02:27,620
So on frame zero 24,

46
00:02:27,620 --> 00:02:30,420
the hand is reaching its opposite extreme

47
00:02:30,420 --> 00:02:34,430
where the thumb is getting
closer to the forearm

48
00:02:34,430 --> 00:02:36,310
by rotating the wrist.

49
00:02:36,310 --> 00:02:40,500
Then the Z curve makes a
quick bump on frame three.

50
00:02:40,500 --> 00:02:44,180
This is where the hand is
trying to reach backward

51
00:02:44,180 --> 00:02:46,910
to get this kind of swimming pose,

52
00:02:46,910 --> 00:02:50,890
as if the character was trying
to pull himself forward.

53
00:02:50,890 --> 00:02:54,740
The wrist and forearm are almost aligned.

54
00:02:54,740 --> 00:02:59,420
And then as the arm reaches
its extreme on the back,

55
00:02:59,420 --> 00:03:00,810
the hand is curving forward

56
00:03:00,810 --> 00:03:03,340
as if it was compensating the movement

57
00:03:03,340 --> 00:03:06,920
of the elbow and get
ready to dive forward.

58
00:03:06,920 --> 00:03:08,440
So from the side view,

59
00:03:08,440 --> 00:03:11,390
mostly working on the Z turn and rotation,

60
00:03:11,390 --> 00:03:13,920
we can see that it's a little more complex

61
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:16,430
than a simple drag again.

62
00:03:16,430 --> 00:03:18,020
If we now have a close look

63
00:03:18,020 --> 00:03:21,120
to the Y and X rotation curves,

64
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:25,010
we can see they have a sinusoidal shape

65
00:03:25,010 --> 00:03:28,150
because they will mainly
influence the twisting

66
00:03:28,150 --> 00:03:31,720
of the wrist and its left to right motion.

67
00:03:31,720 --> 00:03:35,480
So they are mainly used to
keep a nice shape of the wrist

68
00:03:35,480 --> 00:03:37,760
that doesn't look too broken.

69
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:42,760
The hand is slightly more
rotated inward around frame 14

70
00:03:42,860 --> 00:03:46,040
during the passing as if it was pointing

71
00:03:46,040 --> 00:03:48,660
toward the place it wants to be.

72
00:03:48,660 --> 00:03:52,120
So, that's not super complicated
when it comes to work

73
00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:56,500
from the front view, just try
not to have two broken wrists.

74
00:03:56,500 --> 00:04:00,440
And if you have something to
remember about this polishing

75
00:04:00,440 --> 00:04:04,280
it's that the hand is
not necessarily dragging

76
00:04:04,280 --> 00:04:08,343
during the run cycle animation,
which is a common mistake.

77
00:04:09,240 --> 00:04:12,470
From there, we will be
able to mirror the motion

78
00:04:12,470 --> 00:04:15,040
of the left arm onto the right arm.

79
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:19,710
So I've pressed Alt + H
to unhide all the curves.

80
00:04:19,710 --> 00:04:24,160
And then I will select all the
controllers of the left arm,

81
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:25,540
the shoulder, arm, forearm,

82
00:04:25,540 --> 00:04:29,400
and the hand controller we have polished.

83
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:31,070
In the graph editor press eight,

84
00:04:31,070 --> 00:04:32,660
to select all the curves,

85
00:04:32,660 --> 00:04:35,730
press Control + C to copy the curves.

86
00:04:35,730 --> 00:04:38,540
And then I will jump onto the other arm,

87
00:04:38,540 --> 00:04:42,510
select the shoulder, arm,
forearm, and hand controller.

88
00:04:42,510 --> 00:04:45,600
Select all the keys but
the one on frame zero

89
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:47,830
and delete them and then select

90
00:04:47,830 --> 00:04:49,790
all the keys on frame zero

91
00:04:49,790 --> 00:04:52,130
and press Control + Shift + V

92
00:04:52,130 --> 00:04:54,540
to paste the mirrored animation.

93
00:04:54,540 --> 00:04:57,160
Then, as we did for the previous cycles,

94
00:04:57,160 --> 00:05:00,960
I will duplicate over the
curve by pressing Shift + D,

95
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:02,720
X and 24

96
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:06,220
to offset them by 24 frames on the x-axis.

97
00:05:06,220 --> 00:05:08,660
Then I will press eight
to select everything,

98
00:05:08,660 --> 00:05:11,950
press G X minus 12,

99
00:05:11,950 --> 00:05:15,000
to offset them back by 12 frames.

100
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,860
This way we have a 12 frames offset

101
00:05:17,860 --> 00:05:20,100
between the right arm and the left arm.

102
00:05:20,100 --> 00:05:23,010
Finally, I will move the
play head on frame zero.

103
00:05:23,010 --> 00:05:26,600
Press I to insert the key
frame on all controllers,

104
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:29,910
then select all the keys I
just returned on frame zero.

105
00:05:29,910 --> 00:05:32,690
Press V and set the angles to three.

106
00:05:32,690 --> 00:05:35,270
I will then select them again,

107
00:05:35,270 --> 00:05:37,960
press Shift + D and 24

108
00:05:37,960 --> 00:05:41,110
to duplicate them on frame 24.

109
00:05:41,110 --> 00:05:44,450
And now I can get rid of any key frames

110
00:05:44,450 --> 00:05:48,710
before and after frame zero and frame 24

111
00:05:48,710 --> 00:05:52,070
and our run cycle is finally done.

112
00:05:52,070 --> 00:05:55,290
In the next video I will just
share with you a few tips

113
00:05:55,290 --> 00:05:59,190
on how you can change a bit
your run cycle with ease.

114
00:05:59,190 --> 00:06:01,440
As always when it comes to art,

115
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:04,870
you will have to make multiple run cycles

116
00:06:04,870 --> 00:06:06,983
until you get them right.
