00:00:00,700 --> 00:00:03,420
- [Instructor] Before we start
working with the NLA editor,

2
00:00:03,420 --> 00:00:06,860
we need to clean up our
character animations.

3
00:00:06,860 --> 00:00:08,610
First get back to object mode,

4
00:00:08,610 --> 00:00:10,600
get rid of the cylinder,

5
00:00:10,600 --> 00:00:13,270
select our character rig in object mode

6
00:00:13,270 --> 00:00:16,500
and press Alt+G Alt+R Alt+S.

7
00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:18,213
On the current claiming action,

8
00:00:18,213 --> 00:00:21,010
reactivate the roots motion.

9
00:00:21,010 --> 00:00:23,580
And for all our animation

10
00:00:23,580 --> 00:00:28,090
we need to get rid of any
animation of the root boom.

11
00:00:28,090 --> 00:00:31,460
So I will switch to show only selected

12
00:00:31,460 --> 00:00:33,740
and then with my root boom selected

13
00:00:33,740 --> 00:00:36,140
I will get rid of the last key frame.

14
00:00:36,140 --> 00:00:37,740
I will press CTRLl+Tab

15
00:00:37,740 --> 00:00:40,320
to switch back to the action editor,

16
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:44,890
open the temporary action I
created for the idle animation,

17
00:00:44,890 --> 00:00:49,243
hold shift and click on the
cross icon to close the action.

18
00:00:49,243 --> 00:00:53,100
Holding Shift will remove
the action from the file.

19
00:00:53,100 --> 00:00:56,660
Now the closed action as zero users.

20
00:00:56,660 --> 00:00:58,710
And when I will rebuild the file

21
00:00:58,710 --> 00:01:01,730
it will be removed from
our action library.

22
00:01:01,730 --> 00:01:04,190
I will also make sure
that I have no root motion

23
00:01:04,190 --> 00:01:06,140
on my idle animation

24
00:01:06,140 --> 00:01:09,810
and Alt+G Alt+R and Alt+S

25
00:01:09,810 --> 00:01:12,190
to reset the position of the roots.

26
00:01:12,190 --> 00:01:15,890
Then I get rid of all the
other key frames of the root.

27
00:01:15,890 --> 00:01:18,170
I will do the same for the run cycle

28
00:01:18,170 --> 00:01:22,460
making sure that my character
is cycling on position

29
00:01:22,460 --> 00:01:24,270
without any root motion

30
00:01:24,270 --> 00:01:27,210
and remove all the temporary actions.

31
00:01:27,210 --> 00:01:29,720
In the end I only kept the keying,

32
00:01:29,720 --> 00:01:30,920
the run cycle,

33
00:01:30,920 --> 00:01:33,720
the idle and the climbing cycle.

34
00:01:33,720 --> 00:01:36,810
All the other action have no users.

35
00:01:36,810 --> 00:01:39,700
Hence the zero in front of their name.

36
00:01:39,700 --> 00:01:43,110
Now I can go to file, click revert,

37
00:01:43,110 --> 00:01:45,359
it will reload the current file

38
00:01:45,359 --> 00:01:49,700
and the zero users
action have disappeared.

39
00:01:49,700 --> 00:01:52,820
From there, I can double
check each actions

40
00:01:52,820 --> 00:01:55,770
and if you want to make it even cleaner,

41
00:01:55,770 --> 00:01:59,940
you can duplicate the
first key of the route

42
00:01:59,940 --> 00:02:04,130
and move it onto the very
last key of the animation.

43
00:02:04,130 --> 00:02:05,820
This is not necessary.

44
00:02:05,820 --> 00:02:07,503
So don't do it if you don't want.

45
00:02:08,550 --> 00:02:12,240
So let's get started with the NLA editor.

46
00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:16,020
So, I will push a bit
my action eight window,

47
00:02:16,020 --> 00:02:20,350
expand the timeline and
switch to the NLA editor.

48
00:02:20,350 --> 00:02:24,570
By default, you will find out an NLA track

49
00:02:24,570 --> 00:02:28,230
for each of the object
you have in your scene.

50
00:02:28,230 --> 00:02:32,730
So we can see a track for
our squirrel mesh object

51
00:02:32,730 --> 00:02:36,360
that also include a track
for the shape key used

52
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:38,410
to animate the eyes

53
00:02:38,410 --> 00:02:41,680
and a track for our squirrel rig,

54
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:44,660
including a track called keying

55
00:02:44,660 --> 00:02:47,700
because we have our keying action opened

56
00:02:47,700 --> 00:02:49,550
in the keying editor.

57
00:02:49,550 --> 00:02:52,320
Most of the shortcuts
and filters are the same

58
00:02:52,320 --> 00:02:56,190
as in the graph editor
and the action editor,

59
00:02:56,190 --> 00:02:58,620
so I won't go over them again.

60
00:02:58,620 --> 00:03:00,540
Since I'm working only on the rig,

61
00:03:00,540 --> 00:03:03,410
I will click the show selected only.

62
00:03:03,410 --> 00:03:07,530
If I open the different
actions in the action editor,

63
00:03:07,530 --> 00:03:12,530
I will see them appearing onto
the track of the NLA editor.

64
00:03:13,500 --> 00:03:17,440
But I can't use them in
the NLA editor this way.

65
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:20,570
To use them in the NLA editor track,

66
00:03:20,570 --> 00:03:22,890
I need to convert them to strip

67
00:03:22,890 --> 00:03:24,710
by clicking this icon

68
00:03:24,710 --> 00:03:28,260
or click the same icon
in the action editor

69
00:03:28,260 --> 00:03:32,100
and push down the action into the track,

70
00:03:32,100 --> 00:03:34,810
converting it to a strip.

71
00:03:34,810 --> 00:03:38,830
Think now of your action
as an audio or video strip

72
00:03:38,830 --> 00:03:41,660
that you can move in time using the G key

73
00:03:41,660 --> 00:03:44,393
as you will do in a DVD auditor.

74
00:03:45,750 --> 00:03:48,110
In the action editor near the push down,

75
00:03:48,110 --> 00:03:51,110
there is another button called stash.

76
00:03:51,110 --> 00:03:52,990
This is something I never use

77
00:03:52,990 --> 00:03:55,770
but I will show you what it's made for.

78
00:03:55,770 --> 00:03:59,430
If I click it, it will
create a new NLA track

79
00:03:59,430 --> 00:04:01,920
with a new strip idle finished.

80
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:05,510
The NLA track is locked and disabled,

81
00:04:05,510 --> 00:04:09,100
so it does no influence
on our character rig.

82
00:04:09,100 --> 00:04:14,100
It is basically here to
replace the fake user we create

83
00:04:14,100 --> 00:04:18,540
when we click on the shield
icon in the action editor.

84
00:04:18,540 --> 00:04:22,470
If I remove the fake
user from my idle finish

85
00:04:22,470 --> 00:04:24,070
and close the action

86
00:04:24,070 --> 00:04:26,800
or open another one and save the file.

87
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:29,870
When they will revert
or reload my document,

88
00:04:29,870 --> 00:04:32,780
the idle action is still there

89
00:04:32,780 --> 00:04:36,500
because the NLA track is
considered being a user.

90
00:04:36,500 --> 00:04:38,560
That's why we have two users

91
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:42,010
whenever we are opening the
action in the action editor.

92
00:04:42,010 --> 00:04:45,200
But I think it makes the NLA editor messy

93
00:04:45,200 --> 00:04:47,640
having all those additional tracks.

94
00:04:47,640 --> 00:04:51,800
So I prefer to protect my
animation using the fake chooser

95
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:53,650
and getting rid of the track

96
00:04:53,650 --> 00:04:57,033
by simply selecting it
and pressing the X key.

97
00:04:58,170 --> 00:05:01,947
If I select the run cycle
strip and press the Tab key,

98
00:05:01,947 --> 00:05:04,020
the trip will turn to green

99
00:05:04,020 --> 00:05:08,410
meaning that the current
action is in edit mode

100
00:05:08,410 --> 00:05:11,893
and I can see the action
loaded in the action editor.

101
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:15,560
I will close the idle
action in the action editor

102
00:05:15,560 --> 00:05:20,230
so that we only have our
current NLA track available.

103
00:05:20,230 --> 00:05:24,980
If I press shift+D, I
can duplicate the strip.

104
00:05:24,980 --> 00:05:29,540
And if I press Alt+D, I can
make a link to duplicate

105
00:05:29,540 --> 00:05:33,440
as we will do with any
object in the 3D viewport.

106
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:35,200
So as for an object,

107
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:37,890
you can consider this
strip as a container.

108
00:05:37,890 --> 00:05:42,380
So if I press N or I click
the arrow icon to expand

109
00:05:42,380 --> 00:05:43,740
the properties panel,

110
00:05:43,740 --> 00:05:45,800
going into the strip tab,

111
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:49,460
I can see where the current
trip starts and ends

112
00:05:49,460 --> 00:05:52,630
among a lot of different
options that we will be covering

113
00:05:52,630 --> 00:05:53,850
in a few minutes.

114
00:05:53,850 --> 00:05:56,160
But also the action used,

115
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:58,910
the same way will add with a mesh object,

116
00:05:58,910 --> 00:06:02,330
the object is a container
and we have meshed data.

117
00:06:02,330 --> 00:06:04,790
So we can see that the third strip

118
00:06:04,790 --> 00:06:08,350
is using a new run cycle action

119
00:06:08,350 --> 00:06:11,130
with the suffix tag 002.

120
00:06:11,130 --> 00:06:13,330
The second one, another action

121
00:06:13,330 --> 00:06:16,370
and the first one, our original action.

122
00:06:16,370 --> 00:06:18,940
When I press Tab to enter edit mode

123
00:06:18,940 --> 00:06:21,370
and modifying the current action,

124
00:06:21,370 --> 00:06:23,883
we can see that the third strip

125
00:06:23,883 --> 00:06:28,740
that we have created using
the linked duplicate action

126
00:06:28,740 --> 00:06:30,730
is colored in red.

127
00:06:30,730 --> 00:06:34,170
I will make a quick
modification to the action.

128
00:06:34,170 --> 00:06:36,477
I will then go back into the NLA editor

129
00:06:36,477 --> 00:06:38,270
and press the Tab key

130
00:06:38,270 --> 00:06:42,710
and I can see that I am
playing the modified animation.

131
00:06:42,710 --> 00:06:45,440
But if I scrub over the second strip,

132
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:48,540
we can see that he's
playing another animation

133
00:06:48,540 --> 00:06:50,870
the ones that hasn't been modified.

134
00:06:50,870 --> 00:06:53,830
But if I scrub over the third strip,

135
00:06:53,830 --> 00:06:57,630
we can see that it's
playing the same action.

136
00:06:57,630 --> 00:06:59,390
as for the first one.

137
00:06:59,390 --> 00:07:01,310
Since the action are linked,

138
00:07:01,310 --> 00:07:04,280
modifying one will modify the other.

139
00:07:04,280 --> 00:07:07,170
You can add a new strip to an NLA track

140
00:07:07,170 --> 00:07:10,650
by pressing Shift+A and
choosing the action.

141
00:07:10,650 --> 00:07:13,250
But at least on this version of them

142
00:07:13,250 --> 00:07:16,360
they are all at the time
I'm recording this video,

143
00:07:16,360 --> 00:07:19,500
you have to make sure that
your NLA track is active

144
00:07:19,500 --> 00:07:22,880
by simply clicking it to select it.

145
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:26,140
I guess it will be cool
if blender automatically

146
00:07:26,140 --> 00:07:29,223
add a new track if you don't
have any tracks selected.

147
00:07:30,300 --> 00:07:33,133
In the meantime, just
remember this little tip.

148
00:07:34,500 --> 00:07:36,670
Let's have a look to the different option

149
00:07:36,670 --> 00:07:39,270
available in the NLA editor.

150
00:07:39,270 --> 00:07:40,220
When I duplicate NLA strip,

151
00:07:40,220 --> 00:07:45,200
by default blender will
create another NLA track.

152
00:07:45,200 --> 00:07:47,900
Double-clicking on the
track will allow you

153
00:07:47,900 --> 00:07:49,860
to rename the track.

154
00:07:49,860 --> 00:07:53,740
You can reorder the track
position by right clicking on it

155
00:07:53,740 --> 00:07:56,120
and choosing whatever you want to do

156
00:07:56,120 --> 00:08:00,150
or using Page up and Page
down or Shift+Page up

157
00:08:00,150 --> 00:08:02,100
and Shift Page down.

158
00:08:02,100 --> 00:08:03,990
With the idle track selected,

159
00:08:03,990 --> 00:08:08,120
I can press Shift+A and
select the idle action,

160
00:08:08,120 --> 00:08:12,662
it will create a new strip
using the idle action.

161
00:08:12,662 --> 00:08:15,250
The numerous strip will be created

162
00:08:15,250 --> 00:08:18,480
where the play head is positioned.

163
00:08:18,480 --> 00:08:20,360
To create a new track,

164
00:08:20,360 --> 00:08:24,200
I have to create a new action
in the properties panel.

165
00:08:24,200 --> 00:08:26,120
By default, the action is empty.

166
00:08:26,120 --> 00:08:29,640
So I need to create a
key frame on the bone

167
00:08:29,640 --> 00:08:33,240
to be able to push it down
and add this new track.

168
00:08:33,240 --> 00:08:37,130
Or I can simply browse
through my action library,

169
00:08:37,130 --> 00:08:39,053
choose one and push it down.

170
00:08:40,250 --> 00:08:43,220
The huge power of the NLA editor

171
00:08:43,220 --> 00:08:47,320
is to allow to combine different actions.

172
00:08:47,320 --> 00:08:48,650
As I told you before,

173
00:08:48,650 --> 00:08:53,030
I asked you to think of it as video clips.

174
00:08:53,030 --> 00:08:56,680
So as my first run cycles comes to an end

175
00:08:56,680 --> 00:08:59,740
I should be able to see my idols strip.

176
00:08:59,740 --> 00:09:01,440
But nothing happened.

177
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:04,680
And this is because of
the extrapolation mode

178
00:09:04,680 --> 00:09:07,350
of our first run cycles strip.

179
00:09:07,350 --> 00:09:09,960
As it is set to old forward

180
00:09:09,960 --> 00:09:13,000
when this strip it's N,

181
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:17,100
it will keep our character
in the latest pose

182
00:09:17,100 --> 00:09:19,830
or in the latest read key frame

183
00:09:19,830 --> 00:09:22,040
of the action containing the strip.

184
00:09:22,040 --> 00:09:24,506
This extrapolation is displayed as

185
00:09:24,506 --> 00:09:28,840
low Pacitti yellowish
background or grayish background

186
00:09:28,840 --> 00:09:30,910
when the strip is not selected.

187
00:09:30,910 --> 00:09:33,910
Setting the extrapolation mode to nothing

188
00:09:33,910 --> 00:09:36,920
will get rid of the old forward

189
00:09:36,920 --> 00:09:39,330
and idle animation with play.

190
00:09:39,330 --> 00:09:41,840
Sitting the extrapolation mode to hold

191
00:09:41,840 --> 00:09:44,210
will work as the hold forward.

192
00:09:44,210 --> 00:09:47,070
It will extrapolate the latest pose

193
00:09:47,070 --> 00:09:51,060
and it won't allow us to
read the idle animation.

194
00:09:51,060 --> 00:09:52,820
The subtle difference is that

195
00:09:52,820 --> 00:09:54,380
if I choose old forward

196
00:09:54,380 --> 00:09:57,610
you can see that the
influence of the strip

197
00:09:57,610 --> 00:10:00,200
doesn't occur before it

198
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:04,140
but while it will override
any strip that comes after

199
00:10:04,140 --> 00:10:07,040
and is not on the same NLA track.

200
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:09,200
It wants to override any strip

201
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:11,860
that is available prior to heat.

202
00:10:11,860 --> 00:10:14,170
So in the end, it is useful only

203
00:10:14,170 --> 00:10:16,460
if you don't have any strip before.

204
00:10:16,460 --> 00:10:20,379
You can see that my character
is in the run cycle pose

205
00:10:20,379 --> 00:10:23,060
while if I choose old forward,

206
00:10:23,060 --> 00:10:24,730
it is in the rest pose

207
00:10:24,730 --> 00:10:27,683
if it has nothing to read
prior to this NLA trip.

208
00:10:29,530 --> 00:10:34,140
By default, our blending
mode is set to replace.

209
00:10:34,140 --> 00:10:37,850
It means that any strip
that has these landing mode

210
00:10:37,850 --> 00:10:42,450
and is super in the NLA track stack,

211
00:10:42,450 --> 00:10:46,210
will replace any other strip
on other analytic tracks,

212
00:10:46,210 --> 00:10:48,820
exactly as a video editor will work.

213
00:10:48,820 --> 00:10:52,030
If I set the blending mode to add,

214
00:10:52,030 --> 00:10:55,630
we will get a totally crazy results.

215
00:10:55,630 --> 00:10:59,050
And this is because, in the NLA editor

216
00:10:59,050 --> 00:11:03,240
the blending mode applies
to the keyed value.

217
00:11:03,240 --> 00:11:07,130
So in this case, all of our controller

218
00:11:07,130 --> 00:11:11,070
that are all keyed in each action

219
00:11:11,070 --> 00:11:13,610
are added one on top of the other.

220
00:11:13,610 --> 00:11:17,740
So currently, the scaling of
one from the first action,

221
00:11:17,740 --> 00:11:21,870
is added by the scaling of
one on the second action.

222
00:11:21,870 --> 00:11:24,900
And it's the same for the
location and rotation.

223
00:11:24,900 --> 00:11:29,420
This is why we get this crazy
Frankenstein transformation

224
00:11:29,420 --> 00:11:31,730
of our squirrel character.

225
00:11:31,730 --> 00:11:33,840
If I switched to substructure,

226
00:11:33,840 --> 00:11:37,010
it will mostly set all the scale to zero.

227
00:11:37,010 --> 00:11:39,600
So our characters will disappear.

228
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:42,640
And if I use the multiply blending mode,

229
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:45,060
we won't have any problem with the scaling

230
00:11:45,060 --> 00:11:48,900
but the rotation and location
is pretty hard to predict.

231
00:11:48,900 --> 00:11:51,470
So those blending modes are generally used

232
00:11:51,470 --> 00:11:54,020
in very specific cases,

233
00:11:54,020 --> 00:11:56,990
but there is one mode that is super useful

234
00:11:56,990 --> 00:11:58,810
is to combine mode.

235
00:11:58,810 --> 00:12:01,420
If I try to combine the run and the idle

236
00:12:01,420 --> 00:12:03,110
it will still look weird

237
00:12:03,110 --> 00:12:05,500
but let me prepare something for you.

238
00:12:05,500 --> 00:12:07,950
I will push the idle animation away

239
00:12:07,950 --> 00:12:10,500
regroup my boyfriend cycle.

240
00:12:10,500 --> 00:12:12,340
Then unselect the track,

241
00:12:12,340 --> 00:12:15,090
click on the new action

242
00:12:15,090 --> 00:12:18,940
and I will simply move my route boom.

243
00:12:18,940 --> 00:12:23,630
So I will key its location on
frame zero and unframed 24.

244
00:12:23,630 --> 00:12:27,920
I will move it by 1.4 meters on the y-axis

245
00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:31,110
as we did, when we were
doing the run cycle.

246
00:12:31,110 --> 00:12:32,890
I will then select those keys

247
00:12:32,890 --> 00:12:36,480
make sure that they are
into linear interpolation.

248
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:38,900
And now when I play the animation,

249
00:12:38,900 --> 00:12:41,570
we can see that the motion of the root

250
00:12:41,570 --> 00:12:45,030
is combined with our run cycle.

251
00:12:45,030 --> 00:12:49,813
And if I now put the idle
at the end of this strip,

252
00:12:50,850 --> 00:12:54,490
since I will root
locomotion strip is on hold,

253
00:12:54,490 --> 00:12:57,130
our squirrel character will stay in place

254
00:12:57,130 --> 00:12:59,550
and we will have a perfect blending

255
00:12:59,550 --> 00:13:03,350
between the run cycle
and the idle animation.

256
00:13:03,350 --> 00:13:06,600
So now, just imagine what we could do

257
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:09,980
if I was to edit the locomotion,

258
00:13:09,980 --> 00:13:11,870
add a bit of rotation,

259
00:13:11,870 --> 00:13:13,520
switch left to right,

260
00:13:13,520 --> 00:13:16,840
and then add also a bit of rotation

261
00:13:16,840 --> 00:13:19,380
on the root of the body of our character.

262
00:13:19,380 --> 00:13:21,580
This way, from a base run cycle,

263
00:13:21,580 --> 00:13:25,616
I can input variation into
my characters locomotion

264
00:13:25,616 --> 00:13:28,070
into his behavior

265
00:13:28,070 --> 00:13:31,920
and this can be perfect to
rapidly prototype a shot

266
00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:36,690
for example or to iterate
on different variation

267
00:13:36,690 --> 00:13:38,560
of the same animation.

268
00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:40,091
You don't really know
where your characters

269
00:13:40,091 --> 00:13:41,570
are supposed to go,

270
00:13:41,570 --> 00:13:45,360
you want to test different
poses different animation.

271
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:49,933
That's a good way to do it
without reanimating everything.

272
00:13:49,933 --> 00:13:53,450
This is why NLA editor
is often the compounded

273
00:13:53,450 --> 00:13:56,030
to the layers tool in Maya.

274
00:13:56,030 --> 00:13:59,020
And they was able to
create these variation

275
00:13:59,020 --> 00:14:02,340
of our animation in three minutes.

276
00:14:02,340 --> 00:14:06,400
So it's not perfect
but that's a good pace.

277
00:14:06,400 --> 00:14:07,770
To make our life easier,

278
00:14:07,770 --> 00:14:10,970
there are also blend in and out options.

279
00:14:10,970 --> 00:14:13,990
I will create a new
action for our character.

280
00:14:13,990 --> 00:14:17,790
It will be a simple rotation
of the ed controller

281
00:14:17,790 --> 00:14:20,570
that will hold for the whole animation.

282
00:14:20,570 --> 00:14:22,780
I will suggest extrapolation to nothing

283
00:14:22,780 --> 00:14:25,410
and the blending mode to combine.

284
00:14:25,410 --> 00:14:29,150
Now when my character is
executing its run cycle

285
00:14:29,150 --> 00:14:32,430
he has his head turn towards us.

286
00:14:32,430 --> 00:14:36,180
The blend in and out option
are pretty straightforward.

287
00:14:36,180 --> 00:14:39,660
If I add the 10 frame on the blend in,

288
00:14:39,660 --> 00:14:42,720
it will take 10 frames
before our character

289
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:44,740
as his head turned.

290
00:14:44,740 --> 00:14:46,920
And the blend out will work the same

291
00:14:46,920 --> 00:14:50,690
whatever the value I
will put in the blend out

292
00:14:50,690 --> 00:14:55,690
it will these number of frame
to reset to his initial posts.

293
00:14:56,530 --> 00:14:59,270
It's like playing with the influence

294
00:14:59,270 --> 00:15:01,403
of the head rotation track.

295
00:15:02,620 --> 00:15:04,840
And since the influence is a value,

296
00:15:04,840 --> 00:15:07,330
we can animate this influence.

297
00:15:07,330 --> 00:15:10,120
So I will set it to
zero on the first frame

298
00:15:10,120 --> 00:15:12,730
and to zero on frame 24.

299
00:15:12,730 --> 00:15:14,700
Open the graph editor

300
00:15:14,700 --> 00:15:19,700
and now I can access to curve
of the influence of this layer

301
00:15:21,520 --> 00:15:24,230
and create the blending by myself.

302
00:15:24,230 --> 00:15:27,100
Within the values that
goes from zero to one,

303
00:15:27,100 --> 00:15:30,010
I can tell blender how much influence

304
00:15:30,010 --> 00:15:35,010
I want this NLA track to
have on top of my run cycle.

305
00:15:35,300 --> 00:15:39,130
So here it doesn't look like
something really beautiful,

306
00:15:39,130 --> 00:15:40,553
but that's very handy.

307
00:15:41,490 --> 00:15:45,209
Enabling the auto blending
will automatically create

308
00:15:45,209 --> 00:15:49,639
the blend in and blend
out based on the position

309
00:15:49,639 --> 00:15:54,639
of the strips on the top
track and the bottom track.

310
00:15:55,110 --> 00:15:57,690
We can see the influence curve appearing

311
00:15:57,690 --> 00:15:59,270
on the blending strip.

312
00:15:59,270 --> 00:16:01,050
Here it's blending in,

313
00:16:01,050 --> 00:16:06,050
but if I move the ed terms
strip before the other strips,

314
00:16:06,080 --> 00:16:07,663
it will blend out.

315
00:16:10,520 --> 00:16:13,890
Another fantastic
feature of the NLA editor

316
00:16:13,890 --> 00:16:16,853
is to be able to manipulate time.

317
00:16:17,890 --> 00:16:22,420
If I select my run cycles
strip and press S to scale,

318
00:16:22,420 --> 00:16:27,420
the strip will be currently
scaled from the play head

319
00:16:27,800 --> 00:16:32,070
and it will basically affect
the frame start and frame end.

320
00:16:32,070 --> 00:16:34,420
Doubling the size of this strip

321
00:16:34,420 --> 00:16:37,820
will play the action twice slower.

322
00:16:37,820 --> 00:16:41,640
If I increase it to 44 frames for example,

323
00:16:41,640 --> 00:16:45,140
I will almost be playing
it in a slow motion

324
00:16:45,140 --> 00:16:48,890
four times slower than
the original animation.

325
00:16:48,890 --> 00:16:50,380
So that's a fantastic tool

326
00:16:50,380 --> 00:16:52,673
if you want to create slow motion effects.

327
00:16:53,580 --> 00:16:56,320
If I make this three plank shorter

328
00:16:56,320 --> 00:16:58,783
then the animation will be accelerated.

329
00:16:59,920 --> 00:17:04,030
The reversed option will simply
play the current animation

330
00:17:04,030 --> 00:17:05,500
in reverse.

331
00:17:05,500 --> 00:17:06,790
I've made some research

332
00:17:06,790 --> 00:17:09,670
and some experience with
the cyclic strips time

333
00:17:09,670 --> 00:17:12,690
and I absolutely don't
know what it's made for.

334
00:17:12,690 --> 00:17:15,440
If I change the length of the action clip,

335
00:17:15,440 --> 00:17:20,250
it will automatically change
the length of the active strip.

336
00:17:20,250 --> 00:17:23,210
And since we have a cycle
modifier on our curve,

337
00:17:23,210 --> 00:17:27,460
our animation is repeating
even beyond the frame 12

338
00:17:27,460 --> 00:17:29,570
but we can make the animation repeating

339
00:17:29,570 --> 00:17:32,310
by simply increasing the repeat value.

340
00:17:32,310 --> 00:17:34,450
Even if I go into the graffiti task

341
00:17:34,450 --> 00:17:38,450
select all my key and
clear the cyclic modifier,

342
00:17:38,450 --> 00:17:40,640
the animation will be repeating,

343
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:42,603
so it will be cycling.

344
00:17:43,570 --> 00:17:48,570
If I shorten the action clip
not the strip the action clip,

345
00:17:48,900 --> 00:17:52,280
then the action won't be played entirely.

346
00:17:52,280 --> 00:17:56,740
Pressing the Y key will
split the active strip

347
00:17:56,740 --> 00:17:59,520
where the play ed is positioned.

348
00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:02,330
The thing cyclic option will automatically

349
00:18:02,330 --> 00:18:05,730
reset the wrench of the action clip

350
00:18:05,730 --> 00:18:10,290
based on the first and last
key frame within the action.

351
00:18:10,290 --> 00:18:13,780
If you modify the action
length within the action

352
00:18:13,780 --> 00:18:16,730
and edit all through the tweaking,

353
00:18:16,730 --> 00:18:20,220
then clicking this button
or enabling cyclic,

354
00:18:20,220 --> 00:18:24,960
will automatically reset the
wrench of the action clip.

355
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:28,750
One of the super cool
feature of the NLA editor

356
00:18:28,750 --> 00:18:32,680
is to be able to animate the strip time.

357
00:18:32,680 --> 00:18:34,750
I have made my actions clip longer,

358
00:18:34,750 --> 00:18:37,840
I will enable the animated strips time

359
00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:39,330
and insert a key frame.

360
00:18:39,330 --> 00:18:43,580
Now in my graffiti tall, I
have a new curve available.

361
00:18:43,580 --> 00:18:46,080
I will duplicate the created key frame

362
00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:48,030
and move it on frame 12

363
00:18:48,030 --> 00:18:50,963
and it's value I will input 12

364
00:18:50,963 --> 00:18:53,590
and switch everything to vector.

365
00:18:53,590 --> 00:18:57,150
It basically means that
I have created a curve

366
00:18:57,150 --> 00:19:02,150
that treated 12 frame over
12 frame in a linear fashion.

367
00:19:03,060 --> 00:19:07,420
So my animation is playing at real time.

368
00:19:07,420 --> 00:19:09,600
Now, if I offset value,

369
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:12,670
it will play at a slower time.

370
00:19:12,670 --> 00:19:16,330
I think a curve that allow
us to modify the speed

371
00:19:16,330 --> 00:19:20,052
at which we are reading
an action into a strip,

372
00:19:20,052 --> 00:19:24,890
will allow us to create
incredible slow motion.

373
00:19:24,890 --> 00:19:27,280
So instead of scaling the whole strip,

374
00:19:27,280 --> 00:19:29,810
I can choose whenever I want my action

375
00:19:29,810 --> 00:19:31,870
to be played at real time

376
00:19:31,870 --> 00:19:34,130
or to dance slow down.

377
00:19:34,130 --> 00:19:37,090
And if I reduce the value of the curve,

378
00:19:37,090 --> 00:19:40,480
I can even play the action in reverse.

379
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:43,810
You can create tracer overwatch effects,

380
00:19:43,810 --> 00:19:46,690
super easily with this kind of thing.

381
00:19:46,690 --> 00:19:51,240
This is why the NLA editor
should we not be overlooked.

382
00:19:51,240 --> 00:19:55,010
Because even if you want
to use those everyday,

383
00:19:55,010 --> 00:19:59,440
it can owe you to do tons
of thing with a lot of ease

384
00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:01,483
and with incredible results.

385
00:20:03,470 --> 00:20:06,480
There's a last couple of
things I'd like to show you

386
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:07,860
in this video.

387
00:20:07,860 --> 00:20:12,060
Pressing Shift+T will all you
to add a transition strip,

388
00:20:12,060 --> 00:20:16,133
but you need to have two
active strip selected.

389
00:20:17,290 --> 00:20:20,700
It will create a strip
that will automatically

390
00:20:20,700 --> 00:20:24,010
blend one action to the other

391
00:20:24,010 --> 00:20:26,900
creating a linear interpolation.

392
00:20:26,900 --> 00:20:30,500
You can add those strip
through the ad menu.

393
00:20:30,500 --> 00:20:35,320
If you are using speakers in
your 3D scene to play sound,

394
00:20:35,320 --> 00:20:40,320
then you can add sound strip,
pressing the Shift+K shortcut,

395
00:20:41,470 --> 00:20:43,610
or going to the ad menu.

396
00:20:43,610 --> 00:20:48,280
You can group multiple
actions strip pressing CTRL+G

397
00:20:48,280 --> 00:20:51,650
allowing you to manipulate them all at ons

398
00:20:51,650 --> 00:20:55,143
and you can ungroup them
pressing Ctrl+Alt+G.

399
00:20:57,500 --> 00:21:01,110
To summarize, we have
seen that the NLA editors

400
00:21:01,110 --> 00:21:03,920
allows us to combine multiple strips

401
00:21:03,920 --> 00:21:07,350
as if we where working
on the video editor.

402
00:21:07,350 --> 00:21:12,120
We need to push an action
to make it an NLA strip.

403
00:21:12,120 --> 00:21:16,580
The stash option can be used
to replace the fake user.

404
00:21:16,580 --> 00:21:18,350
We can duplicate, clone

405
00:21:18,350 --> 00:21:22,053
or add an action as a
strip into the track.

406
00:21:23,030 --> 00:21:26,320
We can use extrapolation
and blending options

407
00:21:26,320 --> 00:21:30,560
to combine different
strip on different tracks.

408
00:21:30,560 --> 00:21:35,560
Action in the NLA tracks
affect only the keyed channels.

409
00:21:36,430 --> 00:21:38,580
You can blend multiples strips

410
00:21:38,580 --> 00:21:40,880
from different tracks together.

411
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:43,560
Scaling this trip will accelerate

412
00:21:43,560 --> 00:21:46,580
or slow down the bound action.

413
00:21:46,580 --> 00:21:50,420
You can split a strip pressing the Y key.

414
00:21:50,420 --> 00:21:54,520
You can edit the timing of
an animation using the curve.

415
00:21:54,520 --> 00:21:58,890
You can create transition
strips with shift+T

416
00:21:58,890 --> 00:22:02,910
and finally you can
group or ungroup strips

417
00:22:02,910 --> 00:22:05,843
with Ctrl+G and Ctrl+Alt+G.
