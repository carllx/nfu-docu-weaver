00:00:00,670 --> 00:00:03,490
- [Instructor] Before we jump
into animating our character,

2
00:00:03,490 --> 00:00:06,630
we will go through a
little reference analysis.

3
00:00:06,630 --> 00:00:09,370
Here are a couple of
references you can use

4
00:00:09,370 --> 00:00:11,570
and that we are going to analyze.

5
00:00:11,570 --> 00:00:14,950
As usual, you will find a
link in the documentation.

6
00:00:14,950 --> 00:00:19,600
As for the run cycle, we can
identify specific key poses

7
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:21,570
that we are going to block.

8
00:00:21,570 --> 00:00:23,530
The first one is the contact pose,

9
00:00:23,530 --> 00:00:26,700
where the front foot heel
is contacting the ground

10
00:00:26,700 --> 00:00:29,450
and the body starts to get lower.

11
00:00:29,450 --> 00:00:33,250
Then, a few frames later,
we have the down pose.

12
00:00:33,250 --> 00:00:35,210
This is the time where the back foot

13
00:00:35,210 --> 00:00:37,170
is about to leave the ground,

14
00:00:37,170 --> 00:00:41,670
and where the center of
gravity is at its lowest point.

15
00:00:41,670 --> 00:00:45,120
This is also the moment where
the weight is totally shifted

16
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:48,390
onto the side of the
foot touching the ground.

17
00:00:48,390 --> 00:00:50,420
Next is the passing pose.

18
00:00:50,420 --> 00:00:54,240
Generally, the arms are
almost aligned with the body

19
00:00:54,240 --> 00:00:57,160
and the center of gravity is aligned

20
00:00:57,160 --> 00:00:58,950
with the supporting foot.

21
00:00:58,950 --> 00:01:00,780
The back foot is catching up

22
00:01:00,780 --> 00:01:04,803
just before the up pose, or pushing pose.

23
00:01:04,803 --> 00:01:09,240
This is the time where the
COG is at its highest point.

24
00:01:09,240 --> 00:01:12,560
The contacting foot heel
is starting to raise,

25
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:16,270
while the opposite foot is
swinging forward pretty fast.

26
00:01:16,270 --> 00:01:18,070
And the center of gravity

27
00:01:18,070 --> 00:01:22,230
is starting to move toward
the next contact pose.

28
00:01:22,230 --> 00:01:25,630
And so the cycle repeat on the other side.

29
00:01:25,630 --> 00:01:28,160
So as for our run cycle,

30
00:01:28,160 --> 00:01:31,020
a classic walk cycle can be mirrored.

31
00:01:31,020 --> 00:01:33,290
As for the run cycle, we will have

32
00:01:33,290 --> 00:01:37,250
to nail the center of
gravity up-and-down motion,

33
00:01:37,250 --> 00:01:39,983
and also left-to-right motion.

34
00:01:39,983 --> 00:01:43,010
Let's have a look to the shoulder and hips

35
00:01:43,010 --> 00:01:45,530
of those walking characters.

36
00:01:45,530 --> 00:01:47,470
Let's start with the twisting motion

37
00:01:47,470 --> 00:01:50,470
on the rotation around the vertical axis.

38
00:01:50,470 --> 00:01:53,460
As for the run cycle, it's
pretty straightforward.

39
00:01:53,460 --> 00:01:57,450
The hips will twist
toward the leading foot.

40
00:01:57,450 --> 00:01:59,560
So on this contact pose,

41
00:01:59,560 --> 00:02:03,210
the hips are twisting toward the left foot

42
00:02:03,210 --> 00:02:07,290
and the shoulders are
twisting the opposite way.

43
00:02:07,290 --> 00:02:11,160
So we will find here a
lot of common mechanism

44
00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:14,050
that we add during the run cycle,

45
00:02:14,050 --> 00:02:16,500
and those mechanism will also apply

46
00:02:16,500 --> 00:02:19,880
whenever we are animating
other body mechanic.

47
00:02:19,880 --> 00:02:23,412
The other classic motion is
the leaning of the shoulder

48
00:02:23,412 --> 00:02:25,940
versus the leaning of the hips.

49
00:02:25,940 --> 00:02:27,830
If we have a look to the down pose,

50
00:02:27,830 --> 00:02:30,430
which is one of the most contrasted pose,

51
00:02:30,430 --> 00:02:34,250
the hips are raising
toward the contacting foot

52
00:02:34,250 --> 00:02:37,550
because the leg is pushing
to support the weight.

53
00:02:37,550 --> 00:02:39,520
And as seen during the run cycle,

54
00:02:39,520 --> 00:02:42,490
we have a contrapose here also,

55
00:02:42,490 --> 00:02:45,500
where the shoulder are
leaning the opposite way.

56
00:02:45,500 --> 00:02:48,310
When we were walking on
the run cycle animation,

57
00:02:48,310 --> 00:02:50,350
we have seen that the shoulder

58
00:02:50,350 --> 00:02:52,840
were kind of leading the animation,

59
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:56,040
pulling the body forward and upward.

60
00:02:56,040 --> 00:03:00,650
Think of the walk cycle as a
controlled falling forward.

61
00:03:00,650 --> 00:03:05,650
We push our body forward, and
as we fall, our foot catch up.

62
00:03:05,830 --> 00:03:08,580
The arms are swinging in reaction;

63
00:03:08,580 --> 00:03:11,430
they are not leading the animation.

64
00:03:11,430 --> 00:03:14,358
And so we get a pendulum,
or swinging motion,

65
00:03:14,358 --> 00:03:19,358
back and forth, with an
easing on both extreme

66
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:22,540
and a subtle drag of the hands.

67
00:03:22,540 --> 00:03:26,930
We will also have a bit of a
swinging motion in the feet,

68
00:03:26,930 --> 00:03:29,150
and as the feet contact the ground,

69
00:03:29,150 --> 00:03:31,990
it then move at constant speed.

70
00:03:31,990 --> 00:03:36,060
There is also a bit of
left-to-right motion on the feet

71
00:03:36,060 --> 00:03:38,260
where, during the passing pose,

72
00:03:38,260 --> 00:03:42,540
they get on the outside, and
during the contacting pose,

73
00:03:42,540 --> 00:03:47,130
they are a bit on the centered
line beneath the character.

74
00:03:47,130 --> 00:03:51,340
These are some of the basics
that we do need to nail

75
00:03:51,340 --> 00:03:54,770
when we are going to
(indistinct) our walk cycle.

76
00:03:54,770 --> 00:03:59,070
We could analyze those
references for a long time,

77
00:03:59,070 --> 00:04:02,910
but let's get into blocking our walk cycle

78
00:04:02,910 --> 00:04:04,780
and we'll get into detail

79
00:04:04,780 --> 00:04:08,163
whenever we are polishing
each part of the character.
