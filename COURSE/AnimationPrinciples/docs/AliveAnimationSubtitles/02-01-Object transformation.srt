1
00:00:00,440 --> 00:00:04,650
- In blender almost any
input can be animated.

2
00:00:04,650 --> 00:00:08,580
Whether it's an object
position, the armature

3
00:00:08,580 --> 00:00:12,770
or a character, or even
the color of an object.

4
00:00:12,770 --> 00:00:15,950
Let's start simple with
object transformation.

5
00:00:15,950 --> 00:00:17,120
In this chapter,

6
00:00:17,120 --> 00:00:20,060
we will focus on object animation.

7
00:00:20,060 --> 00:00:23,720
An understanding what an
object is, is crucial.

8
00:00:23,720 --> 00:00:27,200
An object in blender is a simple container

9
00:00:27,200 --> 00:00:30,270
and depending on what kind
of object you've added

10
00:00:30,270 --> 00:00:32,802
it contains different objects datas

11
00:00:32,802 --> 00:00:36,710
like mesh datas, camera
datas or empty datas.

12
00:00:36,710 --> 00:00:38,780
These datas can be transferred

13
00:00:38,780 --> 00:00:41,000
from one object to the other.

14
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:44,280
The important thing
regarding object animation

15
00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:47,364
are not these object on mesh datas,

16
00:00:47,364 --> 00:00:49,710
but the object transform data.

17
00:00:49,710 --> 00:00:52,270
The position of the
object in space reserved

18
00:00:52,270 --> 00:00:54,400
of its location transform.

19
00:00:54,400 --> 00:00:58,450
Its orientation is based
on its rotation values

20
00:00:58,450 --> 00:01:02,150
and size is the result
of its original size

21
00:01:02,150 --> 00:01:05,280
multiplied by its current scale.

22
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:09,420
For example, acute mesh
that is one meter tall

23
00:01:09,420 --> 00:01:12,220
and has a scale of 1.5

24
00:01:12,220 --> 00:01:16,730
will be 1.5 meter tolls in the viewport.

25
00:01:16,730 --> 00:01:19,950
These coordinates and
transform information

26
00:01:19,950 --> 00:01:23,400
are affecting the origin of the object.

27
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:27,680
So while the mesh object
might look offset,

28
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:31,580
its position is not
linked to its geometry,

29
00:01:31,580 --> 00:01:34,660
but only to its origin point.

30
00:01:34,660 --> 00:01:37,730
So basically when transforming an object

31
00:01:37,730 --> 00:01:41,100
you're just transforming its origin point.

32
00:01:41,100 --> 00:01:43,290
We can see that everything rotates

33
00:01:43,290 --> 00:01:47,130
or scale around or
toward the origin point.

34
00:01:47,130 --> 00:01:51,800
We can see this doted line
between my mouse cursor

35
00:01:51,800 --> 00:01:54,850
and the origin point of the object,

36
00:01:54,850 --> 00:01:58,610
showing the pivot to use
for this transformation.

37
00:01:58,610 --> 00:02:01,370
The current location of the object

38
00:02:01,370 --> 00:02:04,360
is based on this origin point.

39
00:02:04,360 --> 00:02:09,030
And it's measured based on the
origin of the blender scene

40
00:02:09,030 --> 00:02:12,150
or the origin of old space.

41
00:02:12,150 --> 00:02:15,550
So by default the origin of an object

42
00:02:15,550 --> 00:02:18,070
is it's transformation pivot

43
00:02:18,070 --> 00:02:20,420
and what we are going to animate.

44
00:02:20,420 --> 00:02:22,670
even if an object seems to be made

45
00:02:22,670 --> 00:02:26,030
of multiple object the
only important thing

46
00:02:26,030 --> 00:02:29,060
for animation is its origin point.

47
00:02:29,060 --> 00:02:31,650
You can use the different gizmos available

48
00:02:31,650 --> 00:02:34,680
in the tool panel to
transform your object.

49
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:38,500
I generally prefer to use
the shortcuts G to move,

50
00:02:38,500 --> 00:02:43,440
S to scale and R to
rotate combined with XYZ

51
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:47,450
and shift to constraint
around specific axis.

52
00:02:47,450 --> 00:02:51,630
To summarize, any kind of
object has an origin point.

53
00:02:51,630 --> 00:02:53,620
When animating an object,

54
00:02:53,620 --> 00:02:56,930
we are manipulating its origin coordinate.

55
00:02:56,930 --> 00:02:59,290
So manipulating an object,

56
00:02:59,290 --> 00:03:02,553
is manipulating a single point in space.
