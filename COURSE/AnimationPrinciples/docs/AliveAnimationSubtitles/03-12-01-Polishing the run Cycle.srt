1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:03,570
- Finally, the polishing
stage of our run cycle

2
00:00:03,570 --> 00:00:06,550
or gem cycle animation, as you wish.

3
00:00:06,550 --> 00:00:10,380
With all of our keys
selected, I will press T

4
00:00:10,380 --> 00:00:13,160
and switch to Bézier interpolation.

5
00:00:13,160 --> 00:00:16,440
This is what we call
splining the animation,

6
00:00:16,440 --> 00:00:18,690
because we are just changing the curve

7
00:00:18,690 --> 00:00:20,963
from constant to spline.

8
00:00:20,963 --> 00:00:23,390
And I must say that from our blocking

9
00:00:23,390 --> 00:00:25,430
it already looks pretty cool.

10
00:00:25,430 --> 00:00:28,210
I will quickly clean up the ROOT bone.

11
00:00:28,210 --> 00:00:30,360
So I will select it

12
00:00:30,360 --> 00:00:34,110
and use the only selected
option in the action editor.

13
00:00:34,110 --> 00:00:36,200
When doing a locomotion cycle

14
00:00:36,200 --> 00:00:38,890
it's better to have a constant speed.

15
00:00:38,890 --> 00:00:40,850
So I just need to keep the first

16
00:00:40,850 --> 00:00:45,850
and last key frame and switch
them to linear interpolation.

17
00:00:46,020 --> 00:00:49,810
Linear interpolation means constant speed.

18
00:00:49,810 --> 00:00:52,320
And while we are polishing the animation

19
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:55,550
we can enable or disable the ROOT motion

20
00:00:55,550 --> 00:00:58,625
to check the motion path of our character,

21
00:00:58,625 --> 00:01:02,010
while moving forward or in place.

22
00:01:02,010 --> 00:01:03,430
For the polishing stage,

23
00:01:03,430 --> 00:01:04,930
it can be interesting

24
00:01:04,930 --> 00:01:08,370
to use the properties I
have created on the streak.

25
00:01:08,370 --> 00:01:09,530
You can access them

26
00:01:09,530 --> 00:01:12,841
selecting the property bone
on top of the character.

27
00:01:12,841 --> 00:01:16,300
The hide properties are
not supposed to be keyed.

28
00:01:16,300 --> 00:01:18,230
That's a mistake I have made.

29
00:01:18,230 --> 00:01:19,760
So I will just try click on it

30
00:01:19,760 --> 00:01:21,940
and choose to clear key frames.

31
00:01:21,940 --> 00:01:23,930
Hiding the legs and hiding the tail

32
00:01:23,930 --> 00:01:26,120
while we are polishing the torso,

33
00:01:26,120 --> 00:01:28,610
for example, will help a lot,

34
00:01:28,610 --> 00:01:30,570
because we won't be distracted

35
00:01:30,570 --> 00:01:33,550
by the legs motion nor the tail motion.

36
00:01:33,550 --> 00:01:35,890
And so we can approach the animation

37
00:01:35,890 --> 00:01:39,660
of the torso of our
character as a bouncing ball.

38
00:01:39,660 --> 00:01:41,920
A very common rule in animation

39
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:44,480
is that everything is a bouncing ball.

40
00:01:44,480 --> 00:01:48,030
That's why the bone simple
exercise is so important.

41
00:01:48,030 --> 00:01:50,480
Whenever you are learning animation.

42
00:01:50,480 --> 00:01:52,140
Finally, as always

43
00:01:52,140 --> 00:01:55,010
it's very important to use the motion path

44
00:01:55,010 --> 00:01:58,360
as explained before I've
added to my quick favorite

45
00:01:58,360 --> 00:02:02,160
so I can rapidly access
them, pressing the Q key

46
00:02:02,160 --> 00:02:06,033
but you can also find it
under the armature properties.

47
00:02:07,150 --> 00:02:10,090
Let's starts by polishing
the torso controller

48
00:02:10,090 --> 00:02:12,470
or the root of the torso, if you will.

49
00:02:12,470 --> 00:02:14,050
I've hidden the tail

50
00:02:14,050 --> 00:02:17,210
but I advise you to also hide the legs

51
00:02:17,210 --> 00:02:20,050
because they are a bit
distracting in the end.

52
00:02:20,050 --> 00:02:22,770
I've hidden them a little later on

53
00:02:22,770 --> 00:02:25,890
but it's better to hide
them right at the beginning.

54
00:02:25,890 --> 00:02:28,860
I will first work on the Z location curve

55
00:02:28,860 --> 00:02:32,750
since it's the most
influential curve in the motion

56
00:02:32,750 --> 00:02:35,600
of this controller, it's
pretty straightforward

57
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:39,430
because it does really looks
like our bouncing ball curve.

58
00:02:39,430 --> 00:02:41,780
There are two main differences.

59
00:02:41,780 --> 00:02:45,500
I've slightly scaled the upper vector.

60
00:02:45,500 --> 00:02:47,800
So that my character is kind of

61
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:51,030
floating when it's
reached its highest point.

62
00:02:51,030 --> 00:02:54,530
So it brings a bit of
style into my animation.

63
00:02:54,530 --> 00:02:56,060
And the second thing is

64
00:02:56,060 --> 00:03:00,720
that we have a slight
easing on the contact frame

65
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:05,700
because the legs of our character
are absorbing the shock.

66
00:03:05,700 --> 00:03:07,600
So we don't have a broken vector

67
00:03:07,600 --> 00:03:10,060
on frame zero and frame 12.

68
00:03:10,060 --> 00:03:14,580
Remember that frame zero and
frame 12 must be the same.

69
00:03:14,580 --> 00:03:17,070
So I will basically revise a bit

70
00:03:17,070 --> 00:03:22,070
the position of frame one and
11, and then they I will scale

71
00:03:22,470 --> 00:03:24,940
my key frame on frame six,

72
00:03:24,940 --> 00:03:26,540
when I'm editing the curve,

73
00:03:26,540 --> 00:03:29,710
especially this kind of broad curve.

74
00:03:29,710 --> 00:03:31,880
I often only press the cue key

75
00:03:31,880 --> 00:03:35,250
in the 3D view port to
access my quick favorite.

76
00:03:35,250 --> 00:03:37,630
And I update the motion path.

77
00:03:37,630 --> 00:03:39,730
Don't forget to check the animation

78
00:03:39,730 --> 00:03:43,340
both with the ROOT enabled and disabled.

79
00:03:43,340 --> 00:03:45,790
Here the video is sped up twice

80
00:03:45,790 --> 00:03:49,500
but you have the curve in
reference on the top right corner.

81
00:03:49,500 --> 00:03:50,490
And at this stage

82
00:03:50,490 --> 00:03:52,710
you should be able to polish the curve.

83
00:03:52,710 --> 00:03:54,370
Again as an art form,

84
00:03:54,370 --> 00:03:57,140
I can't teach you
everything about animation

85
00:03:57,140 --> 00:04:00,260
because a lot of it is
about feeling the motion.

86
00:04:00,260 --> 00:04:03,510
So you have to feel if you
want to hold your character

87
00:04:03,510 --> 00:04:07,510
a little more in the air or
make him jump a little higher,

88
00:04:07,510 --> 00:04:10,200
a little lower, that's about you.

89
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:12,250
The thing I'm pretty convinced here

90
00:04:12,250 --> 00:04:14,450
is that the leg are really distracting.

91
00:04:14,450 --> 00:04:16,850
So don't forget to hide them right now.

92
00:04:16,850 --> 00:04:19,739
I'm now switching to the X rotation curve

93
00:04:19,739 --> 00:04:24,700
and the weird thing here is
that we have our XYZ rotation

94
00:04:24,700 --> 00:04:26,850
but also W your rotation.

95
00:04:26,850 --> 00:04:29,830
And there is also this
strange quaternion name.

96
00:04:29,830 --> 00:04:32,080
Don't worry about that for the time being

97
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:36,120
we will be focusing on the
X, Y, and Z rotation curve.

98
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:40,820
We can kind of ignore the
W quaternion rotation curve

99
00:04:40,820 --> 00:04:42,150
for the time being.

100
00:04:42,150 --> 00:04:46,530
And I will explain you Euler
and quaternion rotation later

101
00:04:46,530 --> 00:04:47,450
in this course,

102
00:04:47,450 --> 00:04:49,860
the X rotation curve allows us to

103
00:04:49,860 --> 00:04:53,060
lean our character forward and backwards.

104
00:04:53,060 --> 00:04:56,620
We can see, we have an
important change on the rotation

105
00:04:56,620 --> 00:04:59,691
or orientation of the
torso of our character

106
00:04:59,691 --> 00:05:02,880
when it's contacting
and leaving the ground.

107
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:05,750
I've created a little
plateau in the middle when

108
00:05:05,750 --> 00:05:08,090
our character is floating in the air

109
00:05:08,090 --> 00:05:11,580
the key on zero and 12 are identical

110
00:05:11,580 --> 00:05:13,250
and I've rotated the angles

111
00:05:13,250 --> 00:05:16,160
so that we have a continuous
flow of the curve.

112
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:18,420
When I'm editing this rotation curve,

113
00:05:18,420 --> 00:05:23,420
I'm thinking of how I want
my character to behave.

114
00:05:23,470 --> 00:05:27,620
It's a very light animal
with a lot of agility.

115
00:05:27,620 --> 00:05:30,470
So I want a very smooth motion.

116
00:05:30,470 --> 00:05:32,400
So I want to shape the body

117
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:36,920
of my character so that it
follows the flow of the jump.

118
00:05:36,920 --> 00:05:38,760
And I curve the body even more

119
00:05:38,760 --> 00:05:42,780
when the character is landing
and pushing to jump again.

120
00:05:42,780 --> 00:05:44,070
When I got this feeling

121
00:05:44,070 --> 00:05:46,680
I fixed the first and last key frame

122
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:50,280
aligning them using the individual origin.

123
00:05:50,280 --> 00:05:54,090
It allows you to rotate both
key frame independently,

124
00:05:54,090 --> 00:05:57,180
and then I've created this little plateau.

125
00:05:57,180 --> 00:06:00,330
To have my character slightly flatter

126
00:06:00,330 --> 00:06:03,210
or horizontal while in the air.

127
00:06:03,210 --> 00:06:05,740
It will make it float a bit more.

128
00:06:05,740 --> 00:06:09,523
And here is the result after
polishing the X rotation.

129
00:06:14,290 --> 00:06:19,040
The Y Location, motion of our
character is barely noticeable

130
00:06:19,040 --> 00:06:20,870
because most of the forward

131
00:06:20,870 --> 00:06:24,930
and backward motion is
generated by the ROOT bone.

132
00:06:24,930 --> 00:06:26,900
And I've used the Y location

133
00:06:26,900 --> 00:06:29,400
of the body control during the bulking

134
00:06:29,400 --> 00:06:32,680
only for very subtle
adjustment of the pose.

135
00:06:32,680 --> 00:06:34,100
So I've zoomed on the curve

136
00:06:34,100 --> 00:06:36,180
because the value are very subtle.

137
00:06:36,180 --> 00:06:39,273
And what I will do is
just to align the curve

138
00:06:39,273 --> 00:06:41,810
on frame zero and frame 12.

139
00:06:41,810 --> 00:06:45,070
This will remove any
jitter during the cycle.

140
00:06:45,070 --> 00:06:48,244
We can enable later on the cycle modifier

141
00:06:48,244 --> 00:06:51,320
so that you will see the
continuity of your curve,

142
00:06:51,320 --> 00:06:55,610
and it might be a little
more intuitive to edit them

143
00:06:55,610 --> 00:06:56,800
to align them.

144
00:06:56,800 --> 00:07:01,392
I will apply the same process
to the Y and Z rotation curve.

145
00:07:01,392 --> 00:07:04,870
They are here to slightly twist the torso

146
00:07:04,870 --> 00:07:09,660
of our character and slightly
rotate it side to side.

147
00:07:09,660 --> 00:07:13,040
So they just communicate
a bit, the fact that we

148
00:07:13,040 --> 00:07:16,310
haven't been using tweening
when our character is landing

149
00:07:16,310 --> 00:07:20,890
meaning that his front legs
don't land at the same time.

150
00:07:20,890 --> 00:07:22,460
So there will be a bit

151
00:07:22,460 --> 00:07:25,850
of twisting in the
shoulders and in the torso

152
00:07:25,850 --> 00:07:29,760
because everything is
connected on our character.

153
00:07:29,760 --> 00:07:32,200
And this is something super important

154
00:07:32,200 --> 00:07:34,540
when you are animating a character,

155
00:07:34,540 --> 00:07:37,300
remember that everything is connected.

156
00:07:37,300 --> 00:07:40,540
So if you move your hand,
it will, at some point

157
00:07:40,540 --> 00:07:42,450
make your legs move.

158
00:07:42,450 --> 00:07:45,702
I know it's a bit extreme,
but just keep this in mind

159
00:07:45,702 --> 00:07:50,320
so that you won't forget to
kind of polish a bit everything

160
00:07:50,320 --> 00:07:53,210
or think about it whenever you are working

161
00:07:53,210 --> 00:07:55,600
on the extremity of your contractor.

162
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:59,670
So what I will do for the Y
and Z quaternion rotation,

163
00:07:59,670 --> 00:08:02,370
since those are very subtle motion,

164
00:08:02,370 --> 00:08:05,780
I will just create a
subtle flow in the curve,

165
00:08:05,780 --> 00:08:08,830
making sure that when the curve is going

166
00:08:08,830 --> 00:08:12,000
from one extreme frame 12 to the other

167
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,970
frame zero, it does flow properly.

168
00:08:14,970 --> 00:08:17,440
So I create a slight overshoot

169
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:20,910
by pushing the key number two, a bit down.

170
00:08:20,910 --> 00:08:24,130
The idea's to get smoother
changes in the curve

171
00:08:24,130 --> 00:08:27,970
instead of adding very
brutal changes in the curve.

172
00:08:27,970 --> 00:08:30,240
So it's a bit the same with the Z curve.

173
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:31,400
When I zoom on it,

174
00:08:31,400 --> 00:08:33,900
we can see that we have a peak at the end.

175
00:08:33,900 --> 00:08:35,950
I will smooth the curve down,

176
00:08:35,950 --> 00:08:37,955
rotate the very last key frame,

177
00:08:37,955 --> 00:08:39,650
duplicated it on frame one.

178
00:08:39,650 --> 00:08:42,523
Now my curve is diving
between frame zero and one.

179
00:08:42,523 --> 00:08:46,320
So I will just push down a
bit the key frame number one

180
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:48,000
onto the front two

181
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:51,410
to get a smoother curve
on its whole shape.

182
00:08:51,410 --> 00:08:54,870
We haven't used scaling so
those curves are perfectly flat.

183
00:08:54,870 --> 00:08:57,150
So the first pass of polishing is done

184
00:08:57,150 --> 00:08:58,560
for the body controller.

185
00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:01,260
Those curves will probably be adjusted

186
00:09:01,260 --> 00:09:03,470
when we have polished the chest,

187
00:09:03,470 --> 00:09:05,533
hips and head of our character.
