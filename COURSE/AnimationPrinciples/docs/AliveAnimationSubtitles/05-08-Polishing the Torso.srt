00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,310
- [Instructor] In this video,

2
00:00:01,310 --> 00:00:04,680
we are going to polish the
torso of the character.

3
00:00:04,680 --> 00:00:07,370
Since it's pretty subtle on the run cycle,

4
00:00:07,370 --> 00:00:09,210
especially for a light character,

5
00:00:09,210 --> 00:00:13,020
I like to start with the left
to right location motion.

6
00:00:13,020 --> 00:00:15,450
So basically whenever your character

7
00:00:15,450 --> 00:00:17,590
is contacting with the crown,

8
00:00:17,590 --> 00:00:21,280
the contacting leg will
first absorb the impact

9
00:00:21,280 --> 00:00:24,000
and then push the character up,

10
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,900
but also a bit on the opposite side.

11
00:00:26,900 --> 00:00:30,920
Your character should be moving
to what the contacting foot

12
00:00:30,920 --> 00:00:33,900
one or two frame after the contact,

13
00:00:33,900 --> 00:00:36,650
so that he has time to
compensate the momentum

14
00:00:36,650 --> 00:00:38,210
of the previous move.

15
00:00:38,210 --> 00:00:42,100
Then there will be an
acceleration during the pushing

16
00:00:42,100 --> 00:00:44,110
toward the other side.

17
00:00:44,110 --> 00:00:46,810
And when the character is airborne,

18
00:00:46,810 --> 00:00:49,860
my go-to is to use a linear curve.

19
00:00:49,860 --> 00:00:52,780
But there won't be any noticeable dumping

20
00:00:52,780 --> 00:00:55,010
while your character is in the air.

21
00:00:55,010 --> 00:00:58,470
There is no opposite force
to absorb the momentum

22
00:00:58,470 --> 00:01:00,510
of the side to side motion.

23
00:01:00,510 --> 00:01:04,270
So in our case, the
contacting frame is frame two

24
00:01:04,270 --> 00:01:09,270
and frame 14, then takes two
frame to get to the extreme.

25
00:01:09,590 --> 00:01:12,210
And then as the character is pushing,

26
00:01:12,210 --> 00:01:15,000
his body is moving on the other side.

27
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:18,010
Once you are done with
the side to side motion,

28
00:01:18,010 --> 00:01:22,360
we can work on the forward
and backward motion.

29
00:01:22,360 --> 00:01:27,170
People, and myself included,
often forget to add forward

30
00:01:27,170 --> 00:01:30,060
and backward motion to the torso root.

31
00:01:30,060 --> 00:01:32,450
It's not a big deal if you forget to,

32
00:01:32,450 --> 00:01:34,730
as it's gonna be pretty subtle,

33
00:01:34,730 --> 00:01:38,300
But this slight variation
will bring a bit of texture

34
00:01:38,300 --> 00:01:40,030
to your run cycle.

35
00:01:40,030 --> 00:01:41,890
The rule is pretty simple.

36
00:01:41,890 --> 00:01:45,150
As your character is falling forward,

37
00:01:45,150 --> 00:01:48,180
as the torso is getting down,

38
00:01:48,180 --> 00:01:52,210
his torso root will
slightly shift forward.

39
00:01:52,210 --> 00:01:55,730
During the pushing pose
and while he's airborne,

40
00:01:55,730 --> 00:01:59,200
torso root will slightly travel backward.

41
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:01,940
So if you have a look to the Y curve,

42
00:02:01,940 --> 00:02:04,840
you can see that the
values we are working with

43
00:02:04,840 --> 00:02:06,810
are very, very subtle.

44
00:02:06,810 --> 00:02:10,050
So whenever you are checking
the curve as a reference,

45
00:02:10,050 --> 00:02:14,513
don't forget to check out
the values on the left side.

46
00:02:14,513 --> 00:02:19,160
To make the X rotation
motion a little more obvious.

47
00:02:19,160 --> 00:02:24,160
I've parented this stretched
tube to our torso controller.

48
00:02:24,580 --> 00:02:27,990
If you focus on the tip of this tube,

49
00:02:27,990 --> 00:02:31,920
you will be able to clearly
see the rotation motion.

50
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:36,500
The X rotation drives the
leaning forward and backward

51
00:02:36,500 --> 00:02:39,090
of our character torso root.

52
00:02:39,090 --> 00:02:43,640
What I want to emphasize here
is that whenever the character

53
00:02:43,640 --> 00:02:48,500
is pushing on his leg, his
torso is leaning forward.

54
00:02:48,500 --> 00:02:52,280
Think of a lion jumping,
pushing on his root

55
00:02:52,280 --> 00:02:54,390
with his shoulder inward.

56
00:02:54,390 --> 00:02:57,260
Then he will reach his highest point,

57
00:02:57,260 --> 00:03:01,804
and as he fall down, the
shoulder or the upper torso

58
00:03:01,804 --> 00:03:05,790
will kind of drag behind the root,

59
00:03:05,790 --> 00:03:09,740
and so, the X rotation
will go the other way.

60
00:03:09,740 --> 00:03:13,180
While this rotation motion
should be noticeable,

61
00:03:13,180 --> 00:03:18,180
don't over-commit and input
too high rotation values,

62
00:03:18,340 --> 00:03:22,610
because on top of this,
we will also add rotation

63
00:03:22,610 --> 00:03:24,780
into the chest controller.

64
00:03:24,780 --> 00:03:29,780
And as the chest controller
is inside of the torso root,

65
00:03:29,820 --> 00:03:31,940
it will rotate even more.

66
00:03:31,940 --> 00:03:35,110
A quick tip, whenever you are
working on a chain like this,

67
00:03:35,110 --> 00:03:38,400
I will deactivate the chest controller,

68
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:42,010
this way, the upper body
rotation of my character

69
00:03:42,010 --> 00:03:45,460
is only driven by our torso root.

70
00:03:45,460 --> 00:03:49,060
And it makes it easier to read the motion.

71
00:03:49,060 --> 00:03:51,800
The second tip regarding this motion

72
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:54,880
is that since our character
is taking two step

73
00:03:54,880 --> 00:03:58,410
during the whole cycle,
we just need to work

74
00:03:58,410 --> 00:04:02,476
on all of the cycle, and then
we can duplicate the curve

75
00:04:02,476 --> 00:04:05,560
onto frame 12 to 24.

76
00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:08,470
Another good practice
I should have shown you

77
00:04:08,470 --> 00:04:11,070
at the very beginning of this video

78
00:04:11,070 --> 00:04:13,603
is to hide the arms of the character.

79
00:04:14,460 --> 00:04:18,060
Since we are not working
on the arms at the moment,

80
00:04:18,060 --> 00:04:21,830
they can be a bit distracting
and training-wise,

81
00:04:21,830 --> 00:04:24,720
it is good for you to only see the torso,

82
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:27,780
so that you will get used to its motion.

83
00:04:27,780 --> 00:04:30,790
As usual, we are not into a linear close,

84
00:04:30,790 --> 00:04:33,940
so I will jump onto the
hips before I finished

85
00:04:33,940 --> 00:04:36,940
to polish the rotation of the torso root.

86
00:04:36,940 --> 00:04:40,800
The first thing I check is
which channel I will need

87
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:45,270
to twist the hips, and it's
the Z quaternion channel.

88
00:04:45,270 --> 00:04:48,370
The twisting is the simplest motion

89
00:04:48,370 --> 00:04:52,710
regarding the hips motion
since it follows the legs.

90
00:04:52,710 --> 00:04:57,494
So when the left foot is
forward or left leg is forward,

91
00:04:57,494 --> 00:04:59,700
the Z curve is pushed down,

92
00:04:59,700 --> 00:05:04,320
so that the hips are twisting
forward on their left side.

93
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:06,380
And during the passing pose,

94
00:05:06,380 --> 00:05:08,880
the hips will twist the other way.

95
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:12,930
So we have a pretty smooth
curve with a slight plateau,

96
00:05:12,930 --> 00:05:17,280
as we are favorizing the
airborne pose of the character.

97
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:21,710
So it's a moment where the hips
are not twisting that much.

98
00:05:21,710 --> 00:05:25,100
And then we transition
from one side to the other

99
00:05:25,100 --> 00:05:26,293
during the passing.

100
00:05:27,930 --> 00:05:30,850
The next hips motion we will work on

101
00:05:30,850 --> 00:05:33,300
is the left to right tilting,

102
00:05:33,300 --> 00:05:37,270
and it's one of the most
important motion of the hips.

103
00:05:37,270 --> 00:05:40,070
It's not the easiest one to get right,

104
00:05:40,070 --> 00:05:43,860
because too much tilting
will look very feminine,

105
00:05:43,860 --> 00:05:46,840
while not enough will look very stiff.

106
00:05:46,840 --> 00:05:51,840
This motion is mainly driven
by the Y rotation channel.

107
00:05:52,500 --> 00:05:54,570
And what we do want to emphasize

108
00:05:54,570 --> 00:05:57,730
is the pushing of the legs on the hips.

109
00:05:57,730 --> 00:06:01,770
So I'm slightly reducing
the amplitude of the curve

110
00:06:01,770 --> 00:06:04,880
so that I can then re-increase it

111
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:07,330
during the pushing on frame four.

112
00:06:07,330 --> 00:06:11,510
So we have our contact pose
on frame two and frame 14,

113
00:06:11,510 --> 00:06:13,915
and on frame four and frame 16,

114
00:06:13,915 --> 00:06:18,480
we need a quick rotation
change or shifting,

115
00:06:18,480 --> 00:06:22,070
this way we can fill the
impact of the contacting frame

116
00:06:22,070 --> 00:06:26,350
and the fact that the hips
will react with a slight delay.

117
00:06:26,350 --> 00:06:29,340
In between those two impact motion,

118
00:06:29,340 --> 00:06:32,690
the hips are smoothly
tilting the other way.

119
00:06:32,690 --> 00:06:35,110
As always, for all our cycle,

120
00:06:35,110 --> 00:06:38,920
just make sure that your
frame zero and your frame 24

121
00:06:38,920 --> 00:06:40,923
are the same by duplicating them.

122
00:06:41,920 --> 00:06:45,230
Now our hips motion start
to look pretty good.

123
00:06:45,230 --> 00:06:49,170
We can now polish the
body, X rotation axis,

124
00:06:49,170 --> 00:06:53,090
which will be the tilt
forward and backward.

125
00:06:53,090 --> 00:06:56,090
This one is pretty easy to get right.

126
00:06:56,090 --> 00:06:58,540
As the leg reach the contact pose

127
00:06:58,540 --> 00:07:03,470
and switch to the passing pose,
the hips will tilt forward.

128
00:07:03,470 --> 00:07:06,800
And then during the
pushing and the airborne,

129
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:08,630
they will tilt backward.

130
00:07:08,630 --> 00:07:10,460
Just imagine that the hips

131
00:07:10,460 --> 00:07:13,030
are currently pulling the front foot,

132
00:07:13,030 --> 00:07:15,180
so when contacting the ground,

133
00:07:15,180 --> 00:07:18,660
the hips will surge forward for the foot,

134
00:07:18,660 --> 00:07:21,090
and then when pushing and going up,

135
00:07:21,090 --> 00:07:23,890
they will pull the foot back.

136
00:07:23,890 --> 00:07:27,460
This motion is linked to
the extradition of the top,

137
00:07:27,460 --> 00:07:29,130
so we have already polished it,

138
00:07:29,130 --> 00:07:32,010
so you can keep it very subtle.

139
00:07:32,010 --> 00:07:35,530
Again, don't forget to double
check the graph editor values.

140
00:07:35,530 --> 00:07:38,808
While the X rotation curve
looks pretty contrasted,

141
00:07:38,808 --> 00:07:42,030
the range of value we are
working on is very small,

142
00:07:42,030 --> 00:07:45,710
so in the end, the X
rotation is not that big.

143
00:07:45,710 --> 00:07:48,990
As we have slightly modified
the orientation of the hips

144
00:07:48,990 --> 00:07:52,280
during the motion, we can see
that on the contacting pose,

145
00:07:52,280 --> 00:07:54,800
the leg are not full straight.

146
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:57,270
While it may look a little more natural,

147
00:07:57,270 --> 00:08:00,652
as explained in the
beginning of this chapter,

148
00:08:00,652 --> 00:08:05,270
it's better to have an
exaggerated pose for the contact.

149
00:08:05,270 --> 00:08:08,180
So I'm just getting back
to both foot controllers,

150
00:08:08,180 --> 00:08:12,120
and I'm slightly offsetting
the Y location curve

151
00:08:12,120 --> 00:08:15,130
on the contact frame for both feet.

152
00:08:15,130 --> 00:08:17,420
As our hips are now polished,

153
00:08:17,420 --> 00:08:20,840
we can jump back onto
the torso controller,

154
00:08:20,840 --> 00:08:23,260
work on the zero rotation channels,

155
00:08:23,260 --> 00:08:25,200
that is the twisting of the body,

156
00:08:25,200 --> 00:08:27,700
but will be very close to what we have

157
00:08:27,700 --> 00:08:30,180
on the zero rotation of the hips.

158
00:08:30,180 --> 00:08:33,590
They will be just out of frame of delay

159
00:08:33,590 --> 00:08:35,750
compared to the hips twisting.

160
00:08:35,750 --> 00:08:37,870
But the torso twist and the hips twist

161
00:08:37,870 --> 00:08:40,307
are kind of the same behavior.

162
00:08:40,307 --> 00:08:43,270
The fast twisting during the passing,

163
00:08:43,270 --> 00:08:46,580
where I switch from one side to the other,

164
00:08:46,580 --> 00:08:48,780
and then some kind of plateau

165
00:08:48,780 --> 00:08:51,100
where we have a slight overshoot

166
00:08:51,100 --> 00:08:52,943
when our character is airborne.

167
00:08:53,900 --> 00:08:56,530
Once you are done with
the twisting motion,

168
00:08:56,530 --> 00:09:00,240
there is a bit of tilting
left to right also.

169
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:04,090
So we have to play on the
Y quaternion rotation.

170
00:09:04,090 --> 00:09:07,040
I do advise you to keep it super subtle,

171
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:10,513
because if you push the
tilt left to right too far,

172
00:09:10,513 --> 00:09:13,660
your character will look out of balance

173
00:09:13,660 --> 00:09:16,290
or its run cycle will look a bit sloppy.

174
00:09:16,290 --> 00:09:21,290
That could be a good call for
a Hulk-ish kind of run cycle

175
00:09:21,320 --> 00:09:24,090
or a knock or a big barbarian,

176
00:09:24,090 --> 00:09:27,100
but for our character,
that would be too much.

177
00:09:27,100 --> 00:09:29,600
So in the end, you can see
that the range of motion

178
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:33,490
is pretty limited, and I'm
just smoothing the curve.

179
00:09:33,490 --> 00:09:36,690
The W rotation has almost no influence,

180
00:09:36,690 --> 00:09:39,131
so I haven't worked on this curve.

181
00:09:39,131 --> 00:09:43,640
And in the next video, we will
work on the chest controller,

182
00:09:43,640 --> 00:09:45,033
the neck and the head.
