00:00:00,067 --> 00:00:02,870
[Instructor] There are a
couple of animation principle

2
00:00:02,870 --> 00:00:05,350
we haven't talked about yet.

3
00:00:05,350 --> 00:00:08,470
Line of action and exaggeration.

4
00:00:08,470 --> 00:00:12,090
The cool thing about both those principle

5
00:00:12,090 --> 00:00:14,620
is that they both apply

6
00:00:14,620 --> 00:00:17,870
to animation but also drawing

7
00:00:17,870 --> 00:00:21,420
as they define the quality of a pose

8
00:00:21,420 --> 00:00:23,370
not the quality of the motion.

9
00:00:23,370 --> 00:00:28,180
But since motion and
good animation is about

10
00:00:28,180 --> 00:00:33,180
a sequence of poses then it
does relate also to animation.

11
00:00:33,180 --> 00:00:37,500
So let's first have a look
to what a line of action is

12
00:00:37,500 --> 00:00:38,620
into a pose.

13
00:00:38,620 --> 00:00:40,740
In the words of Preston Blair,

14
00:00:40,740 --> 00:00:44,800
former veteran animator
at the Walt Disney studio

15
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:46,987
and also Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer,

16
00:00:46,987 --> 00:00:49,857
"The line of action is an imaginary line

17
00:00:49,857 --> 00:00:52,900
"extending through the
main action of the figure."

18
00:00:52,900 --> 00:00:55,964
Basically it's a line or a curve

19
00:00:55,964 --> 00:00:59,900
that does support the
silhouette of your character

20
00:00:59,900 --> 00:01:04,060
and give direction to its
motion or to its current pose.

21
00:01:04,060 --> 00:01:06,080
It's here to guide the eyes

22
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:09,590
and build to the whole dynamism of a pose.

23
00:01:09,590 --> 00:01:11,550
Whether it's dynamic or not.

24
00:01:11,550 --> 00:01:13,353
The shape of your line of action

25
00:01:13,353 --> 00:01:16,880
may turn your pose in
something more static.

26
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:19,650
So it's not about drawing dynamism,

27
00:01:19,650 --> 00:01:24,000
it's about drawing directionality
to make the pose clearer.

28
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,550
Let's see a couple of example.

29
00:01:26,550 --> 00:01:28,793
Line of action is about simplifying

30
00:01:28,793 --> 00:01:32,120
how a silhouette or a character reads.

31
00:01:32,120 --> 00:01:34,500
On the character it often starts from

32
00:01:34,500 --> 00:01:36,700
a contracting point or a pushing point

33
00:01:36,700 --> 00:01:38,583
to the opposite extremity.

34
00:01:38,583 --> 00:01:43,230
Because the line of action is
not always but often driven

35
00:01:43,230 --> 00:01:46,600
by the force applied into a pose.

36
00:01:46,600 --> 00:01:50,090
So good line of action
will translate momentum

37
00:01:50,090 --> 00:01:52,630
or directionality to your motion.

38
00:01:52,630 --> 00:01:55,980
So whenever you are building
a pose for your character,

39
00:01:55,980 --> 00:02:00,090
the whole pose should
support the line of action.

40
00:02:00,090 --> 00:02:03,360
All the line of action should
support the whole pose.

41
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:05,720
In this case I've posed the back

42
00:02:05,720 --> 00:02:09,160
but also the tip of the finger
of the end of my character

43
00:02:09,160 --> 00:02:11,260
to support the line of action.

44
00:02:11,260 --> 00:02:12,440
Same thing here.

45
00:02:12,440 --> 00:02:14,490
The way the character is posed

46
00:02:14,490 --> 00:02:17,640
make the line of action super obvious.

47
00:02:17,640 --> 00:02:20,870
So the line of action
helps to read the pose

48
00:02:20,870 --> 00:02:23,373
and helps to read the motion.

49
00:02:23,373 --> 00:02:26,720
If we see the evolution
of the line of action

50
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:28,730
through those poses,

51
00:02:28,730 --> 00:02:33,730
we can see it extending as
our character is jumping.

52
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:38,140
There absolutely no doubt about
the orientation of the jump

53
00:02:38,140 --> 00:02:42,500
so it simplified the
readability of the lecture

54
00:02:42,500 --> 00:02:45,720
of this jumping moment or action.

55
00:02:45,720 --> 00:02:49,490
The line of action is not
necessarily a straight line

56
00:02:49,490 --> 00:02:50,760
or a simple curve.

57
00:02:50,760 --> 00:02:53,140
It can have an S shape

58
00:02:53,140 --> 00:02:55,950
clearly translating the
fact that our character

59
00:02:55,950 --> 00:03:00,160
is gathering energy to
extend on the next pose.

60
00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:03,400
So beyond simplifying the readability,

61
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:06,380
the line of action will
also define the flow

62
00:03:06,380 --> 00:03:07,890
of your animation.

63
00:03:07,890 --> 00:03:11,470
So the line of action is the
best friend of the animator

64
00:03:11,470 --> 00:03:15,521
because it will help
you to see and simplify

65
00:03:15,521 --> 00:03:19,260
the poses of your character through time.

66
00:03:19,260 --> 00:03:21,320
So when you build your animation

67
00:03:21,320 --> 00:03:23,490
and when you build your poses,

68
00:03:23,490 --> 00:03:27,044
you need to first think
of the line of action.

69
00:03:27,044 --> 00:03:30,970
And then while posing
make sure that your pose

70
00:03:30,970 --> 00:03:34,090
is currently supporting
this line of action.

71
00:03:34,090 --> 00:03:37,740
So it's always about going back and forth

72
00:03:37,740 --> 00:03:42,740
between what drives the pose
and what the pose defines.

73
00:03:42,820 --> 00:03:47,090
Let's now about a bit one of
the 12 principles of animation,

74
00:03:47,090 --> 00:03:49,000
which is exaggeration.

75
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:49,833
For me,

76
00:03:49,833 --> 00:03:53,750
this is one of the most
important principle of animation

77
00:03:53,750 --> 00:03:57,560
especially regarding my
own style of animation,

78
00:03:57,560 --> 00:04:01,940
which tend to be pretty
cartoonish or stylized let's say.

79
00:04:01,940 --> 00:04:06,400
And this whole chapter will be
about exaggeration in a way.

80
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:10,570
I have very few interests
to super realistic animation

81
00:04:10,570 --> 00:04:12,900
where there is no exaggeration.

82
00:04:12,900 --> 00:04:16,080
Though exaggerating in
animation doesn't mean

83
00:04:16,080 --> 00:04:17,970
it won't look realistic.

84
00:04:17,970 --> 00:04:21,720
Great animator will clean
motion capture the data

85
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:25,188
and know the spots where
they can push the pose

86
00:04:25,188 --> 00:04:29,445
or exaggerate the animation
to make it more appealing

87
00:04:29,445 --> 00:04:33,630
and better sell the animation or the idea.

88
00:04:33,630 --> 00:04:37,950
Exaggeration is not about
building extreme poses

89
00:04:37,950 --> 00:04:40,400
but better sell an idea.

90
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:44,340
Here I've just built a pose
where a character is punching.

91
00:04:44,340 --> 00:04:46,950
I've used the reference
and tried to match it.

92
00:04:46,950 --> 00:04:50,980
So I'm not here to tell you
if this pose is good or not

93
00:04:50,980 --> 00:04:53,250
but I feel like it does work

94
00:04:53,250 --> 00:04:55,610
and sell that the character is punching.

95
00:04:55,610 --> 00:04:59,370
But now what if I take
this pose and I push it

96
00:04:59,370 --> 00:05:01,580
or I exaggerate it.

97
00:05:01,580 --> 00:05:02,413
Don't worry,

98
00:05:02,413 --> 00:05:05,650
I will explain the whole
process in the next videos

99
00:05:05,650 --> 00:05:09,100
and we are going to build
a bunch of different poses.

100
00:05:09,100 --> 00:05:11,530
What we need to understand here is that

101
00:05:11,530 --> 00:05:13,550
I'm taking the same idea,

102
00:05:13,550 --> 00:05:18,240
my character is throwing a
punch and I'm exaggerating it,

103
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:21,080
meaning that I will push the pose further

104
00:05:21,080 --> 00:05:24,010
both in its directionality

105
00:05:24,010 --> 00:05:27,230
but also in the intention
of the character.

106
00:05:27,230 --> 00:05:29,410
No longer punching his target

107
00:05:29,410 --> 00:05:32,880
but he's trying to punch
through his target.

108
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:36,820
If we now compare both
poses we have similarities.

109
00:05:36,820 --> 00:05:40,360
On both poses our character is punching

110
00:05:40,360 --> 00:05:44,630
and while the line of action
on the first character is clear

111
00:05:44,630 --> 00:05:49,580
by pushing the line of action
forward toward the punch

112
00:05:49,580 --> 00:05:53,650
we are making the idea that
our character is punching

113
00:05:53,650 --> 00:05:55,160
way more obvious.

114
00:05:55,160 --> 00:05:57,370
We are exaggerating it.

115
00:05:57,370 --> 00:05:59,410
While it may makes the pose

116
00:05:59,410 --> 00:06:02,510
a little less realistic in this case

117
00:06:02,510 --> 00:06:06,820
it makes it way more appealing
and way more readable.

118
00:06:06,820 --> 00:06:10,770
A good test is to show
those two poses to a child.

119
00:06:10,770 --> 00:06:14,950
He will certainly point out the right pose

120
00:06:14,950 --> 00:06:16,540
as its favorite one

121
00:06:16,540 --> 00:06:20,020
because it better shows the
intention of the character.

122
00:06:20,020 --> 00:06:21,780
The big disclaimer here,

123
00:06:21,780 --> 00:06:24,060
no children were harmed or involved

124
00:06:24,060 --> 00:06:25,790
in the recording of this course.

125
00:06:25,790 --> 00:06:30,260
While exaggeration can be
used to communicate intention

126
00:06:30,260 --> 00:06:33,790
it can be also used to
communicate emotions.

127
00:06:33,790 --> 00:06:35,460
Whether it's joy,

128
00:06:35,460 --> 00:06:40,460
anger or in this case some
kind of shininess and sadness

129
00:06:41,010 --> 00:06:45,700
by pushing the character
pose and calling him more

130
00:06:45,700 --> 00:06:48,080
I am closing the line of action.

131
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:49,950
The head is leaning more.

132
00:06:49,950 --> 00:06:52,950
The fingers also looked more tortured.

133
00:06:52,950 --> 00:06:56,700
So in the end the
emotion on the right pose

134
00:06:56,700 --> 00:07:01,540
are more convincing and our
character will look more alive.

135
00:07:01,540 --> 00:07:04,870
Finally we can also use exaggeration

136
00:07:04,870 --> 00:07:08,290
to improve the readability of the motion.

137
00:07:08,290 --> 00:07:10,330
When the character is jumping

138
00:07:10,330 --> 00:07:13,610
I'm pulling his body or elongating it

139
00:07:13,610 --> 00:07:15,530
though I'm exaggerating his shape

140
00:07:15,530 --> 00:07:17,520
to make the jump read better.

141
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:19,360
Especially at full speed.

142
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:23,600
So we can use exaggeration
to build what we call smears

143
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:27,220
that in a way simulate the
motion blur of a camera.

144
00:07:27,220 --> 00:07:30,630
And allow us to better feel the motion.

145
00:07:30,630 --> 00:07:33,690
To summarize we have seen
that the line of action

146
00:07:33,690 --> 00:07:36,090
can be applied to animation,

147
00:07:36,090 --> 00:07:38,280
drawing or even photography.

148
00:07:38,280 --> 00:07:41,860
The line of action simplifies
the readability of the pose.

149
00:07:41,860 --> 00:07:44,280
It conveys the directionality,

150
00:07:44,280 --> 00:07:47,254
momentum and or stability of the pose.

151
00:07:47,254 --> 00:07:51,171
It helps to read the
flow of the animation.

152
00:07:51,171 --> 00:07:53,820
The animator should use the line of action

153
00:07:53,820 --> 00:07:56,670
to build his poses and use his poses

154
00:07:56,670 --> 00:07:59,660
to clearly define the line of action.

155
00:07:59,660 --> 00:08:03,935
Exaggeration improves
the appeal and dynamism.

156
00:08:03,935 --> 00:08:08,935
It better communicates the
ideas and the character feelings

157
00:08:08,950 --> 00:08:11,833
and it can improve fast
action readability.

158
00:08:12,833 --> 00:08:15,000
(silence)
