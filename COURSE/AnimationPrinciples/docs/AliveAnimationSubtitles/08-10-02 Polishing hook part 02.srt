00:00:00,200 --> 00:00:02,080
- [Instructor] As in the previous videos,

2
00:00:02,080 --> 00:00:05,480
after I polished the torso
on the center of gravity

3
00:00:05,480 --> 00:00:08,880
of my character, I like
to work on the feet.

4
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:13,400
This will help us to figure
out how to polish the hips

5
00:00:13,400 --> 00:00:15,740
and, later on, the upper chest.

6
00:00:15,740 --> 00:00:18,200
As our character is pulling his right leg,

7
00:00:18,200 --> 00:00:20,900
I want to slightly raise
the foot from the ground.

8
00:00:20,900 --> 00:00:24,080
So I will duplicate one
of the keys of the Z curve

9
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:25,880
and then slightly push it up.

10
00:00:25,880 --> 00:00:28,930
From there, I will move
the newly created keys

11
00:00:28,930 --> 00:00:32,570
around frame 21 when the foot
gets pulled from the ground.

12
00:00:32,570 --> 00:00:35,370
Then I will convert the contacting frame.

13
00:00:35,370 --> 00:00:38,550
The key to vectors is
that we have a hard hit

14
00:00:38,550 --> 00:00:39,900
of the foot on the ground.

15
00:00:39,900 --> 00:00:42,440
This is generally my go-to when it comes

16
00:00:42,440 --> 00:00:46,340
to the Z location curve of the
foot when it hits the ground.

17
00:00:46,340 --> 00:00:48,770
This will ensure that
the food is accelerating

18
00:00:48,770 --> 00:00:50,600
before it touch the ground.

19
00:00:50,600 --> 00:00:52,760
I'm not saying that you should do this

20
00:00:52,760 --> 00:00:55,270
every time your foot is going down,

21
00:00:55,270 --> 00:00:57,140
but most of the time, this is true

22
00:00:57,140 --> 00:00:59,540
so I generally just switch to vector

23
00:00:59,540 --> 00:01:03,080
and then if I have to
revise, I revise later on.

24
00:01:03,080 --> 00:01:06,030
From there, I will revise a
bit the rotation of the foot

25
00:01:06,030 --> 00:01:09,890
so that the ankle gets
more aligned with the knee

26
00:01:09,890 --> 00:01:13,310
and the foot does drag a
bit while it is pulled.

27
00:01:13,310 --> 00:01:17,060
Basically, I want the foot
to lean toward its next pose.

28
00:01:17,060 --> 00:01:20,720
From there, I will just
slightly tweak the heel motion

29
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:23,600
so that it hits the ground a little harder

30
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:25,730
when the character is shifting his weight

31
00:01:25,730 --> 00:01:27,260
on top of the right foot.

32
00:01:27,260 --> 00:01:29,800
I will raise it, touch
the heel before the hit,

33
00:01:29,800 --> 00:01:33,670
and on the hit frame, I will
convert the curve to vector.

34
00:01:33,670 --> 00:01:35,680
Finally, as an extra detail,

35
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:39,060
I will work a bit on the
toes of the right foot.

36
00:01:39,060 --> 00:01:42,980
I will simply make them
drag by rotating them down

37
00:01:42,980 --> 00:01:45,120
while the foot is getting up

38
00:01:45,120 --> 00:01:49,430
and rotating them a bit up
while the foot is getting down.

39
00:01:49,430 --> 00:01:52,170
And then I will slap them on the ground

40
00:01:52,170 --> 00:01:53,740
a couple of frames later

41
00:01:53,740 --> 00:01:56,000
by switching the handle to vector.

42
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,130
From there, remember what I've said

43
00:01:58,130 --> 00:02:00,520
during the blocking stage that the feet

44
00:02:00,520 --> 00:02:02,860
are always moving while on the ground?

45
00:02:02,860 --> 00:02:05,390
As the leg is pulling onto the right foot,

46
00:02:05,390 --> 00:02:08,070
I will slightly rotate it toward the hips.

47
00:02:08,070 --> 00:02:10,200
As I'm reviewing the leg motion,

48
00:02:10,200 --> 00:02:13,400
I can see that there is a little
glitch or pop on the knee.

49
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:15,960
Since the leg doesn't get fully extended,

50
00:02:15,960 --> 00:02:18,320
this is not a problem due to the rig

51
00:02:18,320 --> 00:02:20,630
or to the inverse kinematic mechanisms.

52
00:02:20,630 --> 00:02:23,370
So I will just double check my pull target

53
00:02:23,370 --> 00:02:26,900
as there must be a very
quick change in its position.

54
00:02:26,900 --> 00:02:28,200
And this is the case.

55
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:30,710
I have a couple of keys
close one to the other,

56
00:02:30,710 --> 00:02:32,850
with different position
for the pull target.

57
00:02:32,850 --> 00:02:35,130
To fix the issue, I will simply get rid

58
00:02:35,130 --> 00:02:37,790
of the in-between keys so that Brendan

59
00:02:37,790 --> 00:02:42,460
will automatically interpolate
from frame 32 to frame 36.

60
00:02:42,460 --> 00:02:45,600
And this will smooth the
knee motion for free.

61
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:48,070
During the hook, the right foot get pulled

62
00:02:48,070 --> 00:02:50,530
but it feels like it's hitting the wall

63
00:02:50,530 --> 00:02:53,370
whenever it's getting to its final pose.

64
00:02:53,370 --> 00:02:56,310
Has a hard stop and I'd
like to smooth this a bit

65
00:02:56,310 --> 00:02:58,880
so that I get a bit of
feeling as if the foot

66
00:02:58,880 --> 00:03:00,190
was sliding on the ground.

67
00:03:00,190 --> 00:03:02,960
To do so, I will simply offset the keys

68
00:03:02,960 --> 00:03:07,430
from frame 45 to 47 and
then I will push the values

69
00:03:07,430 --> 00:03:09,660
of the keys on frame 44.

70
00:03:09,660 --> 00:03:13,920
This way, the value of the
curves on frame 44 and 47

71
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:16,760
are almost the same, but not the same.

72
00:03:16,760 --> 00:03:19,910
This way it will a feel
like the foot is stopping,

73
00:03:19,910 --> 00:03:22,050
but it will still move a little bit

74
00:03:22,050 --> 00:03:24,650
as if it was sliding a bit on the ground.

75
00:03:24,650 --> 00:03:26,610
Then I revised the rotation curve

76
00:03:26,610 --> 00:03:30,444
to make the food drag toward
its previous position.

77
00:03:30,444 --> 00:03:33,310
So basically I'm rotating the foot

78
00:03:33,310 --> 00:03:36,235
toward its previous
position based on the speed.

79
00:03:36,235 --> 00:03:38,670
The faster it moves forward,

80
00:03:38,670 --> 00:03:40,840
the more it's rotating backwards.

81
00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:43,060
And as the leg is pulling the foot,

82
00:03:43,060 --> 00:03:45,470
I'm slightly raising the hip.

83
00:03:45,470 --> 00:03:48,330
As explained when we were
polishing the torso root

84
00:03:48,330 --> 00:03:50,670
of our character, we need his weight

85
00:03:50,670 --> 00:03:52,920
to be supporting on one leg to be able

86
00:03:52,920 --> 00:03:54,910
to easily raise the other leg.

87
00:03:54,910 --> 00:03:58,580
And on frame 26, it feels like
the weight of the character

88
00:03:58,580 --> 00:04:00,610
is centered between the two feet.

89
00:04:00,610 --> 00:04:03,890
So I will offset the
movement of the left foot

90
00:04:03,890 --> 00:04:06,090
by one frame so that the foot

91
00:04:06,090 --> 00:04:08,410
start leaving its current position

92
00:04:08,410 --> 00:04:11,840
once the weight is more on the right foot.

93
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:14,310
Then I want the foot to
move fast in the beginning

94
00:04:14,310 --> 00:04:16,620
and then ease into its final position,

95
00:04:16,620 --> 00:04:18,120
so I will scale the curve.

96
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:20,480
And then, as we did for the right foot,

97
00:04:20,480 --> 00:04:25,060
I will input a new Q frame
in between the two position

98
00:04:25,060 --> 00:04:27,530
and push a bit the Z location up,

99
00:04:27,530 --> 00:04:29,870
so that it feels like the foot is raising

100
00:04:29,870 --> 00:04:31,550
before it hits the ground.

101
00:04:31,550 --> 00:04:33,500
Then, using the heel controller

102
00:04:33,500 --> 00:04:35,860
and the foot rotation controller,

103
00:04:35,860 --> 00:04:38,410
I will make sure that the foot opens

104
00:04:38,410 --> 00:04:43,180
toward the next position,
meaning that I will make it slide

105
00:04:43,180 --> 00:04:45,360
onto its inner edge.

106
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:48,210
And after it hits its contact pose,

107
00:04:48,210 --> 00:04:50,491
I will make it tilt to the outside

108
00:04:50,491 --> 00:04:52,550
so that it flatten on the ground.

109
00:04:52,550 --> 00:04:55,050
From there, as we did for the right foot,

110
00:04:55,050 --> 00:04:57,550
I will work a bit on the
toes to make them drag

111
00:04:57,550 --> 00:05:01,790
so whenever the character is
moving his leg to his left,

112
00:05:01,790 --> 00:05:04,321
the toes will slightly drag to the right.

113
00:05:04,321 --> 00:05:06,590
If you are beginning in animation,

114
00:05:06,590 --> 00:05:09,635
and this is the first time
you do this kind of exercise,

115
00:05:09,635 --> 00:05:13,460
note that those details
are not that important.

116
00:05:13,460 --> 00:05:16,290
They will sure bring some
interesting information

117
00:05:16,290 --> 00:05:19,560
to your animation, but
you should always focus

118
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:23,100
on the broad motion on
the center of gravity,

119
00:05:23,100 --> 00:05:25,260
the chest, the position of the foot,

120
00:05:25,260 --> 00:05:26,910
the position of the hands.

121
00:05:26,910 --> 00:05:30,880
Works on those little details
only at the very last moment.

122
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:34,640
Basically always work from
the root of the motion,

123
00:05:34,640 --> 00:05:39,190
in this case, the center
gravity, to the tip of the chain,

124
00:05:39,190 --> 00:05:42,363
the tip of the feet, the tip of the hands.
