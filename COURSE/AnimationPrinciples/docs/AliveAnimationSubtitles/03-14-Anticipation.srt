1
00:00:00,730 --> 00:00:03,190
- [Narrator] Anticipation
is a very common rule

2
00:00:03,190 --> 00:00:05,400
or principle of animation.

3
00:00:05,400 --> 00:00:07,890
If we have a look to the throw animation,

4
00:00:07,890 --> 00:00:10,680
the current pose will be the key pose.

5
00:00:10,680 --> 00:00:12,610
A moment where the character

6
00:00:12,610 --> 00:00:15,290
is releasing whatever he is throwing.

7
00:00:15,290 --> 00:00:16,820
In the previous video,

8
00:00:16,820 --> 00:00:20,270
we've seen that anticipation
was a motion built

9
00:00:20,270 --> 00:00:24,470
to gather energy to prepare
for the next motion.

10
00:00:24,470 --> 00:00:28,220
On these pose we can clearly
read the anticipation.

11
00:00:28,220 --> 00:00:31,740
The whole body of the
character is leaning backward

12
00:00:31,740 --> 00:00:36,538
with his arm extended backward
before he swings forward.

13
00:00:36,538 --> 00:00:39,030
Anticipation of two proposes,

14
00:00:39,030 --> 00:00:41,490
the first one is gathering energy

15
00:00:41,490 --> 00:00:43,550
or preparing for the next motion,

16
00:00:43,550 --> 00:00:46,660
but it's also a matter of readability

17
00:00:46,660 --> 00:00:48,480
and strength in the motion.

18
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:51,610
This example I've
removed the anticipation,

19
00:00:51,610 --> 00:00:54,460
the character is switching
from idle directly

20
00:00:54,460 --> 00:00:55,900
to withdraw motion.

21
00:00:55,900 --> 00:00:59,800
And compared to the animation
with the anticipation

22
00:00:59,800 --> 00:01:04,800
it clearly looks less powerful
and also less readable.

23
00:01:04,830 --> 00:01:08,070
So the anticipation as two proposes

24
00:01:08,070 --> 00:01:10,890
prepares the audience to what is coming

25
00:01:10,890 --> 00:01:14,120
and it adds strength to any motion.

26
00:01:14,120 --> 00:01:17,180
Anticipation is oftenly called antic

27
00:01:17,180 --> 00:01:20,480
and it can append any time in a motion.

28
00:01:20,480 --> 00:01:22,440
On this double a kick,

29
00:01:22,440 --> 00:01:25,970
the anticipation occur at this point.

30
00:01:25,970 --> 00:01:29,500
Character jumps from idle into this pose,

31
00:01:29,500 --> 00:01:33,130
raise whole body is
quashed before the release.

32
00:01:33,130 --> 00:01:35,530
When we think of our bond symbol,

33
00:01:35,530 --> 00:01:38,340
whenever it's quashing
when it hits the ground

34
00:01:38,340 --> 00:01:42,490
we could think of it as being
some sort of anticipation.

35
00:01:42,490 --> 00:01:46,030
Anticipation can be used
for any kind of motion.

36
00:01:46,030 --> 00:01:49,830
It's not necessarily connected
to a strong movement.

37
00:01:49,830 --> 00:01:53,490
On this animation when the
character is turning around

38
00:01:53,490 --> 00:01:55,620
to check what is stuck in his back

39
00:01:55,620 --> 00:01:58,030
he has a slight surprise move

40
00:01:58,030 --> 00:02:02,100
and there is a little
anticipation in his head motion.

41
00:02:02,100 --> 00:02:04,780
His whole body and head goes down

42
00:02:04,780 --> 00:02:07,920
before going up to communicate surprise.

43
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:10,390
When an anticipation is very fast

44
00:02:10,390 --> 00:02:15,270
we can call it a micro
anticipation or micro antic.

45
00:02:15,270 --> 00:02:16,910
On this combo sequence

46
00:02:16,910 --> 00:02:20,050
there are multiple
anticipation on the character.

47
00:02:20,050 --> 00:02:22,420
I'd like to focus on two of them,

48
00:02:22,420 --> 00:02:25,970
when she's moving forward
to give the first punch

49
00:02:25,970 --> 00:02:29,110
she's slightly leaning and crouching

50
00:02:29,110 --> 00:02:32,660
this way she will have
more power into her punch.

51
00:02:32,660 --> 00:02:36,920
So this certain anticipation
fit the jab punch.

52
00:02:36,920 --> 00:02:41,050
When the character is about
to dodge the mannequin falling

53
00:02:41,050 --> 00:02:44,500
she slightly raises her body on two frames

54
00:02:44,500 --> 00:02:47,600
before diving into this curvy motion.

55
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:51,180
Those two frame where she's
blinking with her eyes

56
00:02:51,180 --> 00:02:53,090
are the micro anticipation

57
00:02:53,090 --> 00:02:56,260
before she dodges the falling mannequin.

58
00:02:56,260 --> 00:02:58,420
To summarize we have seen that

59
00:02:58,420 --> 00:03:03,420
anticipation can be used to
gather energy before any motion.

60
00:03:04,260 --> 00:03:08,900
It generally make the current
animation look stronger.

61
00:03:08,900 --> 00:03:12,450
It improves the readability
of the animation

62
00:03:12,450 --> 00:03:16,010
by preparing the audience
to the next move.

63
00:03:16,010 --> 00:03:21,010
Anticipation can also be used
to emphasize subtle motion.

64
00:03:21,310 --> 00:03:24,280
We can use very short anticipation

65
00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:28,123
called micro anticipation or micro antic.
