00:00:00,200 --> 00:00:01,920
- [Instructor] Welcome to chapter four.

2
00:00:01,920 --> 00:00:05,460
In this chapter, we will
be using another technique

3
00:00:05,460 --> 00:00:09,270
to animate the robot character we can see

4
00:00:09,270 --> 00:00:12,010
in the second teaser of the course.

5
00:00:12,010 --> 00:00:14,290
While in the previous chapter,

6
00:00:14,290 --> 00:00:18,010
we have been blocking,
detailing the animation,

7
00:00:18,010 --> 00:00:21,270
then going to spline and polish it,

8
00:00:21,270 --> 00:00:25,890
in this chapter, we are going
to use the layered approach.

9
00:00:25,890 --> 00:00:28,250
The idea is to pose the robot

10
00:00:28,250 --> 00:00:31,330
and then directly work into spline

11
00:00:31,330 --> 00:00:33,770
or using the graph editor

12
00:00:33,770 --> 00:00:36,080
onto different part of the body.

13
00:00:36,080 --> 00:00:38,940
We will start with the torso root motion,

14
00:00:38,940 --> 00:00:41,320
creating the up and down

15
00:00:41,320 --> 00:00:45,360
and then we will work onto
the feet of the character.

16
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:47,466
The idea is to animate the other part

17
00:00:47,466 --> 00:00:50,310
of the character in reaction

18
00:00:50,310 --> 00:00:53,220
of the previous part we will animate.

19
00:00:53,220 --> 00:00:55,470
So I will animate the torso,

20
00:00:55,470 --> 00:00:59,580
then the arms, reacting to
the motion of the torso.

21
00:00:59,580 --> 00:01:03,370
In this chapter, we will
also learn the fundamentals

22
00:01:03,370 --> 00:01:05,077
of space switching

23
00:01:05,077 --> 00:01:08,780
and using constraint when animating.

24
00:01:08,780 --> 00:01:12,860
With this method, we will be
able to use the base motion

25
00:01:12,860 --> 00:01:15,090
of the torso and the legs

26
00:01:15,090 --> 00:01:18,240
to drive the other parts of the robot,

27
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:23,230
creating very realistic
animation very easily.

28
00:01:23,230 --> 00:01:25,100
We will use all those methods

29
00:01:25,100 --> 00:01:27,800
to create this walk cycle,

30
00:01:27,800 --> 00:01:31,260
an artillery shot with a cool recoil

31
00:01:31,260 --> 00:01:34,350
and finally, combining the walk cycle

32
00:01:34,350 --> 00:01:36,150
with a rocket shot.

33
00:01:36,150 --> 00:01:38,530
This is a super exciting chapter

34
00:01:38,530 --> 00:01:39,980
with a lot of technique

35
00:01:39,980 --> 00:01:43,920
that we are going to use
later on in the course.

36
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:45,193
Let's get started.
