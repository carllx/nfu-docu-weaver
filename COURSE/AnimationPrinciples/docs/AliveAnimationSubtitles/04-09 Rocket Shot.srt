1
00:00:00,890 --> 00:00:04,830
- In this video, we are going
to animate the rocket shot.

2
00:00:04,830 --> 00:00:07,780
The main difficulty is to isolate

3
00:00:07,780 --> 00:00:10,834
the motion of the rocket
from the walk cycle.

4
00:00:10,834 --> 00:00:12,480
Let's get started.

5
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:14,740
First thing I'm going to
do is to make sure that

6
00:00:14,740 --> 00:00:18,450
our walk cycle is currently cycling.

7
00:00:18,450 --> 00:00:20,970
So I will display all the bones.

8
00:00:20,970 --> 00:00:23,320
I will go into the Graph Editor.

9
00:00:23,320 --> 00:00:25,680
Click the Show Hidden option.

10
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:27,720
Press Alt+H to make sure that

11
00:00:27,720 --> 00:00:30,350
all the curves are displayed

12
00:00:30,350 --> 00:00:34,120
and then I will press
Shift+E and Make Cycle.

13
00:00:34,120 --> 00:00:37,110
I will then set the end of my animation

14
00:00:37,110 --> 00:00:40,580
to an arbitrary value of 400 frames

15
00:00:40,580 --> 00:00:42,090
because I don't know yet

16
00:00:42,090 --> 00:00:43,080
how long it will take

17
00:00:43,080 --> 00:00:45,170
to the rocket to touch

18
00:00:45,170 --> 00:00:46,300
or hit

19
00:00:46,300 --> 00:00:48,210
the cube further away.

20
00:00:48,210 --> 00:00:50,040
Now we have a looping walk cycle.

21
00:00:50,040 --> 00:00:52,135
So let's go ahead and
work on the rocket shot.

22
00:00:52,135 --> 00:00:52,968
(rockets whooshing)

23
00:00:52,968 --> 00:00:54,470
The first thing we can do

24
00:00:54,470 --> 00:00:58,640
is to display our rocket layer in the rig.

25
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:01,120
We will have a controller for our rocket.

26
00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:05,030
I will select the very first
one on the top left corner.

27
00:01:05,030 --> 00:01:06,720
And I will get rid of

28
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:09,800
all the key frames but the very first.

29
00:01:09,800 --> 00:01:13,653
Then I will go on frame
40 and insert a key frame.

30
00:01:13,653 --> 00:01:16,160
This is again, pretty arbitrary.

31
00:01:16,160 --> 00:01:18,500
The idea is to set this key frame

32
00:01:18,500 --> 00:01:22,250
as being the beginning of
the shooting animation.

33
00:01:22,250 --> 00:01:24,590
It's a lot better to have a
few frames in the beginning

34
00:01:24,590 --> 00:01:28,190
so that our brain can
analyze what's happening.

35
00:01:28,190 --> 00:01:31,840
Like, the robot is
walking and then shooting.

36
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:34,110
It is if we were creating some staging

37
00:01:34,110 --> 00:01:35,877
for this shooting animation.

38
00:01:35,877 --> 00:01:38,100
Add a key frame on frame 40.

39
00:01:38,100 --> 00:01:40,430
Now, using Local Space,

40
00:01:40,430 --> 00:01:42,280
I will go on frame 50

41
00:01:42,280 --> 00:01:45,370
and I will get the first rocket out,

42
00:01:45,370 --> 00:01:48,320
moving it along it's Y-axis.

43
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:51,427
If we now frame our curve or zoom on it

44
00:01:51,427 --> 00:01:54,170
we can see there is a repetition

45
00:01:54,170 --> 00:01:57,370
because of the cyclic modifier we added

46
00:01:57,370 --> 00:01:59,350
in the beginning of the video.

47
00:01:59,350 --> 00:02:02,370
So I will select all my rocket curves,

48
00:02:02,370 --> 00:02:04,200
press Shift+E

49
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:06,433
and choose Clear Cyclic.

50
00:02:06,433 --> 00:02:09,600
We can see that all the
curves are straight and flat

51
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:13,030
while the Y-curve is
slightly bending downward.

52
00:02:13,030 --> 00:02:16,460
We can hide all the curve, but the Y-curve

53
00:02:16,460 --> 00:02:19,130
so that we can work on the forward motion

54
00:02:19,130 --> 00:02:23,220
of the rocket while it's
getting out with ease.

55
00:02:23,220 --> 00:02:24,870
We just scale up

56
00:02:24,870 --> 00:02:27,530
the initial key frame handle

57
00:02:27,530 --> 00:02:30,650
so that we get more easing
whenever the rockets

58
00:02:30,650 --> 00:02:33,660
start to get out of the rocket launcher.

59
00:02:33,660 --> 00:02:36,990
And then I will just go
to a further key frame

60
00:02:36,990 --> 00:02:38,390
again, arbitrary

61
00:02:38,390 --> 00:02:40,650
and move the rocket further away.

62
00:02:40,650 --> 00:02:42,792
The idea here is not to build the motion

63
00:02:42,792 --> 00:02:45,730
but to show you the current issue we have.

64
00:02:45,730 --> 00:02:48,135
The rocket is a child
of the rocket launcher.

65
00:02:48,135 --> 00:02:52,430
Hence it inherits any motion
from the rocket launcher.

66
00:02:52,430 --> 00:02:56,020
So we will need to find a
way to isolate the rocket

67
00:02:56,020 --> 00:02:57,610
from the rocket launcher.

68
00:02:57,610 --> 00:03:00,750
We'll delete the last
key frame I have created

69
00:03:00,750 --> 00:03:03,640
so that we just stick
with the two key frames

70
00:03:03,640 --> 00:03:05,580
where the rocket is getting out

71
00:03:05,580 --> 00:03:07,800
of the rocket launcher and stop.

72
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:10,420
I will rotate the tip of the curve handle

73
00:03:10,420 --> 00:03:14,970
so that we don't have any
easing out of the rocket.

74
00:03:14,970 --> 00:03:17,520
From there, we will need
to use space switching

75
00:03:17,520 --> 00:03:20,050
to be able to animate the rocket.

76
00:03:20,050 --> 00:03:22,080
So I will go back into Object Mode

77
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:23,820
and add an Empty.

78
00:03:23,820 --> 00:03:25,590
In the Object Display option

79
00:03:25,590 --> 00:03:27,957
I will make sure that it shows In Front.

80
00:03:27,957 --> 00:03:28,790
(rockets whooshing)

81
00:03:28,790 --> 00:03:31,470
The idea is to bake the
motion of the rocket

82
00:03:31,470 --> 00:03:34,440
while it's getting out
of the rocket launcher,

83
00:03:34,440 --> 00:03:35,510
on the Empty.

84
00:03:35,510 --> 00:03:39,480
So on our Empty let's add a
Copy Transform Constraint.

85
00:03:39,480 --> 00:03:41,400
Source the armature,

86
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:44,430
and then source the ROCKET-1 bone.

87
00:03:44,430 --> 00:03:46,320
And when the Empty is constrained

88
00:03:46,320 --> 00:03:48,310
we can bake the action,

89
00:03:48,310 --> 00:03:51,430
choosing the Initial
Frame as being frame 0

90
00:03:51,430 --> 00:03:54,900
and ending on the current
frame of frame 50.

91
00:03:54,900 --> 00:03:58,260
We'll press Q to get
to my Quick Favorites.

92
00:03:58,260 --> 00:04:00,010
Choose "Bake Action."

93
00:04:00,010 --> 00:04:04,320
As usual, enable Visual Keying
and Clear Constraint and set.

94
00:04:04,320 --> 00:04:06,768
You can check the Override Current Action,

95
00:04:06,768 --> 00:04:09,860
even if there is no action for the Empty.

96
00:04:09,860 --> 00:04:11,530
Blender will create one.

97
00:04:11,530 --> 00:04:13,400
Set the Start Frame to 0

98
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:15,650
and the End Frame to 50.

99
00:04:15,650 --> 00:04:18,170
We can get rid of the
Scale Transform Channels

100
00:04:18,170 --> 00:04:20,400
since we won't be using them.

101
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:22,630
And if we now play the animation,

102
00:04:22,630 --> 00:04:25,450
we can see the Empty following the rocket.

103
00:04:25,450 --> 00:04:28,820
Now, the idea is to reverse the constraint

104
00:04:28,820 --> 00:04:32,740
so that the rocket is
constrained by the Empty.

105
00:04:32,740 --> 00:04:35,260
So I will select my rocket controller,

106
00:04:35,260 --> 00:04:37,150
go to the Bone Constraint

107
00:04:37,150 --> 00:04:39,460
add a Copy Transform Constraint

108
00:04:39,460 --> 00:04:40,920
and solve the Empty.

109
00:04:40,920 --> 00:04:44,350
And now the rocket is
following the Empty motion.

110
00:04:44,350 --> 00:04:47,610
Since the Empty motion has the same motion

111
00:04:47,610 --> 00:04:49,610
as the rocket initially

112
00:04:49,610 --> 00:04:53,000
it will fall, but since the Empty is not

113
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,510
the child of the robot,

114
00:04:54,510 --> 00:04:56,500
we can move the rocket freely

115
00:04:56,500 --> 00:04:59,330
or we can move the Empty freely.

116
00:04:59,330 --> 00:05:03,640
So now it's just a matter
of creating the animation

117
00:05:03,640 --> 00:05:04,830
using the Empty.

118
00:05:04,830 --> 00:05:07,520
What I want to do for this rocket launch

119
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:09,490
is to have it in two-time.

120
00:05:09,490 --> 00:05:13,110
First, they get out of the rocket launcher

121
00:05:13,110 --> 00:05:15,330
as if they were pushed away

122
00:05:15,330 --> 00:05:16,910
and then they will fall.

123
00:05:16,910 --> 00:05:19,200
The little wings will open

124
00:05:19,200 --> 00:05:22,030
and then the rockets will fly away.

125
00:05:22,030 --> 00:05:25,490
So what I've done is that
I've set a first key frame

126
00:05:25,490 --> 00:05:29,050
where I want the rocket to kind of fall.

127
00:05:29,050 --> 00:05:30,860
And then the next key frame

128
00:05:30,860 --> 00:05:34,800
is where the rocket
will hit our cube shape.

129
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:37,340
Since it's a pretty simple motion

130
00:05:37,340 --> 00:05:40,180
just work with pose extremes

131
00:05:40,180 --> 00:05:43,650
as if you were animating
a regular character.

132
00:05:43,650 --> 00:05:45,570
We just set the first extreme

133
00:05:45,570 --> 00:05:48,680
which is the "down" pose of the rocket

134
00:05:48,680 --> 00:05:49,720
and the next one

135
00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:52,510
which is when it hits the target.

136
00:05:52,510 --> 00:05:54,810
From there we will just tweak the curve

137
00:05:54,810 --> 00:05:56,930
to get the right motion.

138
00:05:56,930 --> 00:05:59,910
Again, now, it's a matter
of creative process.

139
00:05:59,910 --> 00:06:02,680
If you want the rocket
to go straight forward

140
00:06:02,680 --> 00:06:04,620
to the target, you can do it.

141
00:06:04,620 --> 00:06:09,180
I do like the idea that the
rocket gets shot in two-time.

142
00:06:09,180 --> 00:06:11,250
First, it gets out.

143
00:06:11,250 --> 00:06:12,730
Then the wing opens

144
00:06:12,730 --> 00:06:15,350
and then it goes toward the target.

145
00:06:15,350 --> 00:06:20,330
I think it adds a more interesting
rhythm to the animation.

146
00:06:20,330 --> 00:06:22,820
And while I'm recording this video

147
00:06:22,820 --> 00:06:26,060
I'm planning to use them
to create the teaser

148
00:06:26,060 --> 00:06:27,410
for the course.

149
00:06:27,410 --> 00:06:30,290
And I want to launch three rockets

150
00:06:30,290 --> 00:06:33,240
so that it will bring us even more rhythm.

151
00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:35,670
I have the shot going in three parts.

152
00:06:35,670 --> 00:06:38,030
The rockets gets out,

153
00:06:38,030 --> 00:06:39,280
then it falls,

154
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:41,620
and then it flies away.

155
00:06:41,620 --> 00:06:44,059
And I will kind of multiply that

156
00:06:44,059 --> 00:06:46,770
three-times, using three rockets.

157
00:06:46,770 --> 00:06:48,710
Animation-wise, what I did

158
00:06:48,710 --> 00:06:51,620
is that there is a slight slowing down

159
00:06:51,620 --> 00:06:53,720
on the Y-axis of the rocket,

160
00:06:53,720 --> 00:06:56,340
so that it kind of floats

161
00:06:56,340 --> 00:07:00,020
before the reactor of the rocket ignites.

162
00:07:00,020 --> 00:07:01,740
And then it accelerates

163
00:07:01,740 --> 00:07:04,880
on the Y-axis until the impact.

164
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:07,160
This is why I'm using vector handles

165
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:08,660
on the very last key frame

166
00:07:08,660 --> 00:07:10,370
so that we are sure we don't get

167
00:07:10,370 --> 00:07:13,690
any easing in the last position.

168
00:07:13,690 --> 00:07:16,250
In the end, I spent most of the time

169
00:07:16,250 --> 00:07:18,530
tweaking the rotation curve to get

170
00:07:18,530 --> 00:07:21,140
the rocket pointing at the target.

171
00:07:21,140 --> 00:07:26,140
While we could use Aim Space,
with a Tracking Constraint,

172
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:29,350
you could add an Empty
object onto the cube

173
00:07:29,350 --> 00:07:33,106
and use it to add a Don't
Track Constraint on the Empty

174
00:07:33,106 --> 00:07:36,270
that is used to manipulate the rocket.

175
00:07:36,270 --> 00:07:38,490
That could save you a bit of time.

176
00:07:38,490 --> 00:07:41,990
But in the end, this is not
a very complex animation.

177
00:07:41,990 --> 00:07:45,600
We are manipulating only
one rotational axis.

178
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:49,140
So it's a good exercise
to do it by hand, too.

179
00:07:49,140 --> 00:07:52,870
So I will let you there
until the end of the video.

180
00:07:52,870 --> 00:07:56,450
You can double check the
curves on the example file,

181
00:07:56,450 --> 00:07:57,710
but at this stage

182
00:07:57,710 --> 00:08:01,270
you should be able to
animate this on your own.

183
00:08:01,270 --> 00:08:04,460
Don't forget to then
get back to the rocket

184
00:08:04,460 --> 00:08:08,160
and deploy the little wings
using the Rotation Controller.

185
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:10,240
I will see you in the next video

186
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:14,252
where we will shoot with
the artillery cannon.

187
00:08:14,252 --> 00:08:19,252
(somber electronic music with
rising piano progression)

188
00:09:57,937 --> 00:10:00,437
(music fades)
