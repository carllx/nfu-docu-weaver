1
00:00:00,100 --> 00:00:02,760
- Before we jump into the next chapter,

2
00:00:02,760 --> 00:00:05,790
there is a couple of more
poses I'd like to show you.

3
00:00:05,790 --> 00:00:08,480
The first one is a katana pose

4
00:00:08,480 --> 00:00:11,720
and we are going to use the
double-handed sword to do it.

5
00:00:11,720 --> 00:00:14,890
The second pose is going
to be a flying knee.

6
00:00:14,890 --> 00:00:17,270
For those two poses, I will go through

7
00:00:17,270 --> 00:00:19,250
the analysis of the reference,

8
00:00:19,250 --> 00:00:23,350
and then I will give you some
hints on how to improve them.

9
00:00:23,350 --> 00:00:25,730
As usual, the first
thing you need to do is

10
00:00:25,730 --> 00:00:28,980
to identify the line of
action in your character.

11
00:00:28,980 --> 00:00:32,450
Since the character has
been swinging to his left,

12
00:00:32,450 --> 00:00:35,010
there is big probabilities
that he was pushing

13
00:00:35,010 --> 00:00:36,180
with his right leg.

14
00:00:36,180 --> 00:00:40,790
We will also be able to
identify another line of action

15
00:00:40,790 --> 00:00:43,070
going through the left leg.

16
00:00:43,070 --> 00:00:46,100
It's interesting to
see all those two lines

17
00:00:46,100 --> 00:00:48,190
form a triangular shape.

18
00:00:48,190 --> 00:00:50,760
So this is something we
will have to try to match

19
00:00:50,760 --> 00:00:51,890
in our pose.

20
00:00:51,890 --> 00:00:53,310
From there as usual,

21
00:00:53,310 --> 00:00:55,970
I'm drawing some lines on the character

22
00:00:55,970 --> 00:00:57,930
to see the orientation of the face,

23
00:00:57,930 --> 00:01:01,840
the orientation of the torso,
check the hips position

24
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:05,110
and outline some of
the interesting shapes.

25
00:01:05,110 --> 00:01:08,910
Going to use anatomical
part as point of reference,

26
00:01:08,910 --> 00:01:11,170
like the clavicles and the pecs

27
00:01:11,170 --> 00:01:13,750
to figure out the chest orientation

28
00:01:13,750 --> 00:01:17,310
or the eyes to figure
out the head orientation.

29
00:01:17,310 --> 00:01:18,190
For this pose,

30
00:01:18,190 --> 00:01:21,550
I advise you to switch
to inverse kinematics

31
00:01:21,550 --> 00:01:23,110
for the arm controllers,

32
00:01:23,110 --> 00:01:25,180
powering the weapon to the left hand.

33
00:01:25,180 --> 00:01:27,940
From there, offset, a bit, the weapon

34
00:01:27,940 --> 00:01:30,840
so that there is enough
room for the right hand

35
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:31,800
on the handle.

36
00:01:31,800 --> 00:01:33,130
Then, as usual,

37
00:01:33,130 --> 00:01:37,740
try to first match the right
position for the torso root.

38
00:01:37,740 --> 00:01:38,710
In this case,

39
00:01:38,710 --> 00:01:43,420
it is slightly twisted toward
the left arm of the character.

40
00:01:43,420 --> 00:01:45,810
It is slightly leaning forward

41
00:01:45,810 --> 00:01:49,110
and it is tilting toward the
right arm of the character.

42
00:01:49,110 --> 00:01:51,650
Once your torso root is roughly posed,

43
00:01:51,650 --> 00:01:53,490
you should pose the feet.

44
00:01:53,490 --> 00:01:56,660
First, check out the
orientation of the feet,

45
00:01:56,660 --> 00:01:59,570
and then double check that
your center of gravity is

46
00:01:59,570 --> 00:02:02,150
currently aligned with those feet,

47
00:02:02,150 --> 00:02:04,210
so that your character is balanced.

48
00:02:04,210 --> 00:02:07,420
Finally, carefully watch
the knees orientation

49
00:02:07,420 --> 00:02:09,710
and don't forget to use the pole targets

50
00:02:09,710 --> 00:02:12,280
to rectify the leg's shape.

51
00:02:12,280 --> 00:02:15,750
You will be able to see
the whole posing process

52
00:02:15,750 --> 00:02:19,210
in a slow-paced time-lapse
in the next video.

53
00:02:19,210 --> 00:02:21,040
When posing the arms,

54
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:23,610
double check the position of the elbows

55
00:02:23,610 --> 00:02:25,600
and the position of the hands.

56
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:28,270
Watch for the angles made by the elbows

57
00:02:28,270 --> 00:02:31,650
and carefully watch for hands orientation.

58
00:02:31,650 --> 00:02:35,360
Then, use the shoulder
controller to reach those poses.

59
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:36,660
When working on the hands,

60
00:02:36,660 --> 00:02:40,130
don't forget to use
the pan bone controller

61
00:02:40,130 --> 00:02:44,030
and try to draw a nice
curling shape of the finger.

62
00:02:44,030 --> 00:02:47,360
Make sure that your hand
doesn't look like a box.

63
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:49,760
Finally, don't forget that you can use

64
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:51,760
the sword controller to tweak

65
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:53,963
the sword orientation and position.

66
00:02:54,990 --> 00:02:56,180
To push this pose,

67
00:02:56,180 --> 00:02:59,060
you have to increase its directionality.

68
00:02:59,060 --> 00:03:02,350
Since the center of gravity
is pushed to the right,

69
00:03:02,350 --> 00:03:04,620
I will just push it even more.

70
00:03:04,620 --> 00:03:07,620
And as the character is
slightly leaning to the left,

71
00:03:07,620 --> 00:03:09,900
I will make him lean even more.

72
00:03:09,900 --> 00:03:13,460
And since there is quite
a lot of spine twisting

73
00:03:13,460 --> 00:03:15,340
engaged into this pose,

74
00:03:15,340 --> 00:03:18,150
I will make the body twist even more.

75
00:03:18,150 --> 00:03:20,810
The final touch was to fix some issues

76
00:03:20,810 --> 00:03:22,820
regarding the initial pose.

77
00:03:22,820 --> 00:03:23,900
On the initial pose,

78
00:03:23,900 --> 00:03:25,150
the sword doesn't tread well

79
00:03:25,150 --> 00:03:27,290
because it's overlapping with the body.

80
00:03:27,290 --> 00:03:30,030
So while my first concern
was to make the character

81
00:03:30,030 --> 00:03:32,060
look more dynamic,

82
00:03:32,060 --> 00:03:35,270
I've also made sure that
the sword better reads

83
00:03:35,270 --> 00:03:36,723
on the pushed pose.

84
00:03:39,080 --> 00:03:40,880
For this new pose, as usual,

85
00:03:40,880 --> 00:03:42,930
I'm looking for the line of action,

86
00:03:42,930 --> 00:03:45,963
and since the character just jumped,

87
00:03:45,963 --> 00:03:47,560
it's pretty easy to find it.

88
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:49,630
While the line of action is currently

89
00:03:49,630 --> 00:03:51,910
supporting the motion of the character,

90
00:03:51,910 --> 00:03:54,870
remember that we are here to translate

91
00:03:54,870 --> 00:03:57,050
the motivation of the character.

92
00:03:57,050 --> 00:04:00,230
And his purpose is currently
to hit his opponent

93
00:04:00,230 --> 00:04:02,430
as hard as possible with his knee.

94
00:04:02,430 --> 00:04:05,150
So when we are going to push this pose,

95
00:04:05,150 --> 00:04:08,110
instead of focusing on the line of action,

96
00:04:08,110 --> 00:04:11,340
I will focus on the
directionality of the knee

97
00:04:11,340 --> 00:04:14,630
and make sure that the
whole pose of the character

98
00:04:14,630 --> 00:04:16,380
supports this idea.

99
00:04:16,380 --> 00:04:19,360
Once I was able to match
the reference pose,

100
00:04:19,360 --> 00:04:21,880
I've pushed the pose of my character

101
00:04:21,880 --> 00:04:25,070
so that we do feel the
directionality of the knee.

102
00:04:25,070 --> 00:04:28,680
And it's to make your whole
character becoming a hero

103
00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:30,340
pointing at the target.

104
00:04:30,340 --> 00:04:32,870
I've shortened the angle of the left knee

105
00:04:32,870 --> 00:04:34,800
so that it looks more pointy,

106
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:38,650
but I rotated the torso backward
so that it's more aligned

107
00:04:38,650 --> 00:04:40,380
with the directionality of the knee.

108
00:04:40,380 --> 00:04:43,260
And finally, I make sure that both arms

109
00:04:43,260 --> 00:04:45,410
are supporting the current pose

110
00:04:45,410 --> 00:04:49,070
and don't forget to support
the pose, even in the finger.

111
00:04:49,070 --> 00:04:53,620
Make sure that the hands read
well and make the fingers

112
00:04:53,620 --> 00:04:57,540
track toward their previous
position in the movement.

113
00:04:57,540 --> 00:05:00,580
But you should also pose
the toes of the character.

114
00:05:00,580 --> 00:05:03,132
Double check the orientation of the feet.

115
00:05:03,132 --> 00:05:05,910
Basically check each
part of your character,

116
00:05:05,910 --> 00:05:09,950
rotate around the pose and
make sure that each features of

117
00:05:09,950 --> 00:05:13,210
the body are supporting the current pose

118
00:05:13,210 --> 00:05:15,710
and make sure that the current pose

119
00:05:15,710 --> 00:05:19,509
does translate or communicate
the will of the character.

120
00:05:19,509 --> 00:05:21,900
This is the mindset you need to have

121
00:05:21,900 --> 00:05:24,030
whenever you are creating a pose,

122
00:05:24,030 --> 00:05:27,970
whether it's an action pose
like this one or an acting pose.

123
00:05:27,970 --> 00:05:31,500
If your character is
feeling fear, for example,

124
00:05:31,500 --> 00:05:35,130
how should his hand be
posed to translate the fear?

125
00:05:35,130 --> 00:05:37,810
What kind of shape should his body make?

126
00:05:37,810 --> 00:05:40,780
How do I pose the shoulder,
how do I pose the head?

127
00:05:40,780 --> 00:05:43,400
What kind of shape do I do with the eyes?

128
00:05:43,400 --> 00:05:44,340
So again,

129
00:05:44,340 --> 00:05:47,570
whenever you are building
the pose, ask yourself

130
00:05:47,570 --> 00:05:51,320
what it communicates
and if it does it well.

131
00:05:51,320 --> 00:05:55,740
And if each part of the
character currently communicates

132
00:05:55,740 --> 00:05:57,250
the same idea.

133
00:05:57,250 --> 00:06:00,560
Use reference to get
a good quality of pose

134
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:02,480
and a good believability,

135
00:06:02,480 --> 00:06:05,560
push the pose to better
communicate the idea

136
00:06:05,560 --> 00:06:07,750
and connect with your audience,

137
00:06:07,750 --> 00:06:12,430
whether it's for gameplay
animation or film animation.

138
00:06:12,430 --> 00:06:14,150
This is the end of this video.

139
00:06:14,150 --> 00:06:16,550
The next video will be the time-lapses

140
00:06:16,550 --> 00:06:19,600
of the two different
poses we've just studied.

141
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:21,753
And I will see you in the next chapter.
