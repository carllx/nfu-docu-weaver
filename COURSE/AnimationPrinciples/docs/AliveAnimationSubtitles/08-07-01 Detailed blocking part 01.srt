1
00:00:00,090 --> 00:00:03,810
- In this video, we will start
to Detailing our Blocking.

2
00:00:03,810 --> 00:00:05,850
It currently looked like that

3
00:00:05,850 --> 00:00:09,730
and our goal is to add
as many poses as possible

4
00:00:09,730 --> 00:00:13,013
to avoid any interpretation
of the Blocking.

5
00:00:13,013 --> 00:00:16,410
Here you can see the result
of this Detailed Blocking

6
00:00:16,410 --> 00:00:18,000
or Blocking plus.

7
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,590
Your objective when you're
doing the Blocking plus

8
00:00:20,590 --> 00:00:24,220
or Detailed Blocking is
to spot any big changes

9
00:00:24,220 --> 00:00:26,860
in the silhouette or
pose of your character

10
00:00:26,860 --> 00:00:30,870
and create an intermediate
pose or a transition pose.

11
00:00:30,870 --> 00:00:34,900
This is also the moment where
you will lock the anticipation

12
00:00:34,900 --> 00:00:36,170
and your overshoot.

13
00:00:36,170 --> 00:00:38,970
So, that when you will switch into Spline,

14
00:00:38,970 --> 00:00:43,110
you will have as less floating
and timing issue compared

15
00:00:43,110 --> 00:00:44,720
to the Blocking as possible.

16
00:00:44,720 --> 00:00:48,320
The first pose I'm going
to work on is the overshoot

17
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:49,930
of the right cross.

18
00:00:49,930 --> 00:00:53,400
The current post we are seeing
is the extreme we have built

19
00:00:53,400 --> 00:00:56,360
during the Blocking stage
and here is you overshoot.

20
00:00:56,360 --> 00:00:59,070
I'm extending the whole body on one frame.

21
00:00:59,070 --> 00:01:02,600
I'm creating this pose one
frame after the extreme.

22
00:01:02,600 --> 00:01:06,016
It'll create a visual
pop that will better sell

23
00:01:06,016 --> 00:01:07,730
the speed of the punch.

24
00:01:07,730 --> 00:01:10,050
It's a pretty easy pose to achieve.

25
00:01:10,050 --> 00:01:13,880
Just twist a bit more the
chest, align the hips,

26
00:01:13,880 --> 00:01:17,930
move the torso controller
forward and then extend the arm.

27
00:01:17,930 --> 00:01:20,980
But we can lean a bit more
the head into the shot

28
00:01:20,980 --> 00:01:23,410
and spread the left arm backward

29
00:01:23,410 --> 00:01:26,350
as it was swinging in the previous post.

30
00:01:26,350 --> 00:01:29,070
From there it's all about exaggeration.

31
00:01:29,070 --> 00:01:32,520
Take the chest controller
and move it on the y-axis.

32
00:01:32,520 --> 00:01:36,160
Don't rotate it but
currently change its location

33
00:01:36,160 --> 00:01:37,730
and do the same with the arm.

34
00:01:37,730 --> 00:01:41,860
I'm taking each controller
and I'm moving them forward

35
00:01:41,860 --> 00:01:44,300
on their local Y-axis.

36
00:01:44,300 --> 00:01:47,960
When you're pushing the pose
or you are pushing the rig,

37
00:01:47,960 --> 00:01:50,710
it might generate some visual artifact,

38
00:01:50,710 --> 00:01:54,100
especially regarding the
deformation of the chest.

39
00:01:54,100 --> 00:01:55,780
This is the time where you can use

40
00:01:55,780 --> 00:01:59,390
the torso three controller,
move them and scale them a bit

41
00:01:59,390 --> 00:02:02,850
to fix the shape of the
torso and its silhouette.

42
00:02:02,850 --> 00:02:04,710
As explained in the previous chapter,

43
00:02:04,710 --> 00:02:07,373
I was not really satisfied
with the frame 21.

44
00:02:08,380 --> 00:02:11,180
Because it feels like the
character is falling forward.

45
00:02:11,180 --> 00:02:13,580
So, I've decided to remove this pose

46
00:02:13,580 --> 00:02:16,620
and we will create a better pose later on.

47
00:02:16,620 --> 00:02:18,480
Before I delete the key frame,

48
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:21,830
I will simply move them away
at the end of the animation

49
00:02:21,830 --> 00:02:25,700
so, that I can watch the
animation without this pose

50
00:02:25,700 --> 00:02:28,000
and then put it back in if needed.

51
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,520
Or if I want I can switch the poses

52
00:02:30,520 --> 00:02:33,850
by simply moving the key frame in and out

53
00:02:33,850 --> 00:02:36,890
and play the animation and
choose the one I prefer.

54
00:02:36,890 --> 00:02:38,420
Once my choice is made,

55
00:02:38,420 --> 00:02:41,570
I can get rid of the pose
I don't need anymore.

56
00:02:41,570 --> 00:02:43,610
The next pose I need to build

57
00:02:43,610 --> 00:02:47,540
is the Transition into
the hook anticipation.

58
00:02:47,540 --> 00:02:50,150
So, basically at the
end of the right cross,

59
00:02:50,150 --> 00:02:51,940
the right foot is catching up

60
00:02:51,940 --> 00:02:55,160
and our characters need
to pull its right arm

61
00:02:55,160 --> 00:02:56,710
back into it's guard.

62
00:02:56,710 --> 00:03:00,000
The center of gravity is
still mainly supported

63
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:04,840
by the left foot but it's
shifting towards the right foot.

64
00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:07,720
As I often do whenever
I am building a pose

65
00:03:07,720 --> 00:03:10,590
that is very different
from the previous one,

66
00:03:10,590 --> 00:03:13,480
I will cancel the
rotation on the chest hips

67
00:03:13,480 --> 00:03:17,410
and even on the center of
gravity or torso root controller.

68
00:03:17,410 --> 00:03:20,320
I've also canceled the
old transform on the neck,

69
00:03:20,320 --> 00:03:22,750
on the head, on the
shoulders and the arms.

70
00:03:22,750 --> 00:03:24,710
But if we have a look
at the reference pose,

71
00:03:24,710 --> 00:03:27,700
we can see that the center
of gravity is mostly

72
00:03:27,700 --> 00:03:28,940
upon the left leg.

73
00:03:28,940 --> 00:03:31,910
While the hips are
mostly pointing forward,

74
00:03:31,910 --> 00:03:36,030
the chest is slightly dragging
and so does the right arm.

75
00:03:36,030 --> 00:03:38,790
So, it's a bit extended Transitioning

76
00:03:38,790 --> 00:03:41,290
into the hook anticipation.

77
00:03:41,290 --> 00:03:43,610
We will sure need additional poses

78
00:03:43,610 --> 00:03:45,590
to Detail this Transition,

79
00:03:45,590 --> 00:03:48,580
but it already improve
a lot the readability

80
00:03:48,580 --> 00:03:49,690
of the animation.

81
00:03:49,690 --> 00:03:52,330
Make sure that the top
of the body's delayed

82
00:03:52,330 --> 00:03:53,970
compared to the hips

83
00:03:53,970 --> 00:03:56,933
so, that the chest and the
arms are dragging a bit.

84
00:03:59,230 --> 00:04:02,350
Since we have a foot position change

85
00:04:02,350 --> 00:04:06,210
between the current pose
and the hook anticipation,

86
00:04:06,210 --> 00:04:09,370
I you advise you to create
the pose where the foot

87
00:04:09,370 --> 00:04:12,760
is currently contacting
with its new location.

88
00:04:12,760 --> 00:04:16,170
During the Blocking stage,
you should create a pose

89
00:04:16,170 --> 00:04:18,970
each time a foot is contacting the ground.

90
00:04:18,970 --> 00:04:21,970
So, what I will do is that
on the anticipation pose

91
00:04:21,970 --> 00:04:23,820
with the foot controller selected,

92
00:04:23,820 --> 00:04:26,480
I will press Ctrl+C to copy its pose.

93
00:04:26,480 --> 00:04:27,880
Since this is the moment

94
00:04:27,880 --> 00:04:29,930
where the foot is contacting the ground,

95
00:04:29,930 --> 00:04:34,490
I will make sure that it
touches it with its inner edge,

96
00:04:34,490 --> 00:04:38,010
and they will slightly
raise the tip of the toes

97
00:04:38,010 --> 00:04:39,850
and rotate the toes backwards.

98
00:04:39,850 --> 00:04:41,890
But whenever you're trying to raise a leg,

99
00:04:41,890 --> 00:04:46,010
your center of gravity will
shift toward the supporting leg.

100
00:04:46,010 --> 00:04:50,550
So, I've pushed the center of
gravity on to the right foot.

101
00:04:50,550 --> 00:04:54,200
Finally, our character was
still pulling his right arm back

102
00:04:54,200 --> 00:04:56,160
and his left arm in front.

103
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:59,180
So, the chest will be
slightly rotating backward

104
00:04:59,180 --> 00:05:01,540
and the left arm is
raised near the temples

105
00:05:01,540 --> 00:05:03,470
of the character in guard.

106
00:05:03,470 --> 00:05:05,640
Whenever you think
you're done with a pose,

107
00:05:05,640 --> 00:05:08,290
don't forget to scrub
through your animation

108
00:05:08,290 --> 00:05:12,120
and see how it flows between
the previous and the next one.

109
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:14,370
You will most likely feel the need

110
00:05:14,370 --> 00:05:17,230
to whether fix the pose you're working on

111
00:05:17,230 --> 00:05:19,937
or rework the previous or next pose.

112
00:05:19,937 --> 00:05:22,430
The pose you will have the
clearer will be the flow

113
00:05:22,430 --> 00:05:23,670
of your animation.

114
00:05:23,670 --> 00:05:27,110
So, you will not surely
retract the arcs of the ends

115
00:05:27,110 --> 00:05:29,370
of the head of the chest of your character

116
00:05:29,370 --> 00:05:32,170
and maybe fine tune the different poses

117
00:05:32,170 --> 00:05:35,000
so, that those arc currently looks good.

118
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,000
As you can see, I have a big gap

119
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,920
between the current
anticipation of the hook

120
00:05:39,920 --> 00:05:41,480
and the hook itself.

121
00:05:41,480 --> 00:05:43,740
To better sell the power of the hook,

122
00:05:43,740 --> 00:05:46,010
I want this long anticipation.

123
00:05:46,010 --> 00:05:48,030
So, we need to hold the current pose

124
00:05:48,030 --> 00:05:50,800
and so, we will create a moving hold.

125
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:55,000
So, basically it's a pose that
is very close to what we have

126
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:59,550
on the frame 35, but I'm just
pushing it a little more.

127
00:05:59,550 --> 00:06:03,430
Animation wise, it will
look as if we were holding

128
00:06:03,430 --> 00:06:06,680
the pose 35 for five frames,

129
00:06:06,680 --> 00:06:08,940
but our character will still be moving.

130
00:06:08,940 --> 00:06:11,910
This why we called this a moving hold.

131
00:06:11,910 --> 00:06:15,390
Also, they really help to
lock your anticipation.

132
00:06:15,390 --> 00:06:18,130
So, that whenever we will switch to spline

133
00:06:18,130 --> 00:06:21,740
our character won't be
transitioning from the anticipation

134
00:06:21,740 --> 00:06:25,200
directly into the hook in a slow motion,

135
00:06:25,200 --> 00:06:28,330
but he will hold the current anticipation

136
00:06:28,330 --> 00:06:30,820
and rapidly transition into the hook.

137
00:06:30,820 --> 00:06:33,630
Note that there is a
difference between this

138
00:06:33,630 --> 00:06:34,850
and an overshoot.

139
00:06:34,850 --> 00:06:37,480
Here I am not making the arms dragging

140
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:39,250
instead I'm contracting them.

141
00:06:39,250 --> 00:06:42,620
So, I'm slightly closing
the shape on the arms.

142
00:06:42,620 --> 00:06:46,253
It's not a reaction to the
momentum of the previous pose.

143
00:06:47,770 --> 00:06:51,380
At some point, don't forget
to also pose the bag.

144
00:06:51,380 --> 00:06:54,020
The most important poses are the poses

145
00:06:54,020 --> 00:06:56,630
where the bag is in contact
with your character.

146
00:06:56,630 --> 00:06:59,830
If the other poses are not
right, that's not a big deal.

147
00:06:59,830 --> 00:07:04,340
We will be able to almost
animate them in straightforward

148
00:07:04,340 --> 00:07:07,380
once we have polished
our character animation.

149
00:07:07,380 --> 00:07:09,830
It will be way easier
to play with the curve

150
00:07:09,830 --> 00:07:14,220
to get our pendulum right
than trying to block it.

151
00:07:14,220 --> 00:07:15,750
But if you are motivated,

152
00:07:15,750 --> 00:07:18,990
I advise you to try to block
the motion of the back.

153
00:07:18,990 --> 00:07:22,750
At least that's a good training
because you will have to try

154
00:07:22,750 --> 00:07:26,130
to figure out the position
of the bag in space,

155
00:07:26,130 --> 00:07:28,990
based on the pose of your character

156
00:07:28,990 --> 00:07:32,710
and the timing between one
punch and the next, for example.

157
00:07:32,710 --> 00:07:36,060
Also it will improve your
Blocking readability.

158
00:07:36,060 --> 00:07:38,360
But again, this is not mandatory
