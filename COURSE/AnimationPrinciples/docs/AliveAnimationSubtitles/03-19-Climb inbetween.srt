1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,810
- [Instructor] Since it's
a pretty complex animation,

2
00:00:02,810 --> 00:00:06,560
we do need more poses
in the blocking stage

3
00:00:06,560 --> 00:00:08,720
so let's add some in-betweens.

4
00:00:08,720 --> 00:00:12,880
The first pose I've been
working on was the pushing pose,

5
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:16,220
the character is getting
almost fully extended

6
00:00:16,220 --> 00:00:21,220
the front legs or hands are
just about to leave the trunk,

7
00:00:21,380 --> 00:00:24,050
the back legs are not extended yet,

8
00:00:24,050 --> 00:00:26,790
pressing Shift S I've snapped the cursor

9
00:00:26,790 --> 00:00:28,960
to the leg of my character,

10
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:31,620
now I can push the foot backward

11
00:00:31,620 --> 00:00:34,930
and then move to root bone forward

12
00:00:34,930 --> 00:00:38,944
or upward since our
character is rotated to match

13
00:00:38,944 --> 00:00:41,550
the previous position of the foot

14
00:00:41,550 --> 00:00:45,950
so that we don't have this
sliding contact effect.

15
00:00:45,950 --> 00:00:49,070
The trick here is that I input the value

16
00:00:49,070 --> 00:00:54,070
of the movement with the keyboard
pressing G then Z to move

17
00:00:54,710 --> 00:00:56,780
along the global Z axis

18
00:00:56,780 --> 00:01:01,420
and press 0.08 to move
by eight centimeters,

19
00:01:01,420 --> 00:01:05,710
this way, I do know how
much I have moved the foot

20
00:01:05,710 --> 00:01:08,100
and I will offset the root bone,

21
00:01:08,100 --> 00:01:12,880
but also the hands of the
character by the same value

22
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:16,960
this way I'm sure that I will
have corresponding motion

23
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:19,440
for all the parts of the characters.

24
00:01:19,440 --> 00:01:23,480
It's a good way to do this
because it's very accurate

25
00:01:23,480 --> 00:01:24,962
but it's also a bad way

26
00:01:24,962 --> 00:01:29,962
because it's a very constraint
way to do this thing,

27
00:01:30,230 --> 00:01:34,210
this is why I advised you
not to use any root motion

28
00:01:34,210 --> 00:01:37,130
for the blocking of this
animation in the previous video

29
00:01:37,130 --> 00:01:39,590
but to show doing so that's not bad

30
00:01:39,590 --> 00:01:42,830
because this is something
we will have to do later on,

31
00:01:42,830 --> 00:01:46,830
so it gives us a base to work on,

32
00:01:46,830 --> 00:01:50,809
doing it the hard way
here might not be the most

33
00:01:50,809 --> 00:01:53,460
intuitive way to do it

34
00:01:53,460 --> 00:01:55,430
that's what I'm meaning

35
00:01:55,430 --> 00:02:00,220
but I will have a solid base
to go into polishing them.

36
00:02:00,220 --> 00:02:02,127
Dispose is the one where the head

37
00:02:02,127 --> 00:02:04,390
has the biggest spacing compared

38
00:02:04,390 --> 00:02:05,550
to the previous pose,

39
00:02:05,550 --> 00:02:07,210
it's one of the first pose

40
00:02:07,210 --> 00:02:09,370
where the character is pushing forward,

41
00:02:09,370 --> 00:02:12,830
so I will extend the neck of
the character quite a bit,

42
00:02:12,830 --> 00:02:17,770
it feels like the front
legs are a bit too extended

43
00:02:17,770 --> 00:02:19,570
and on the reference we can see

44
00:02:19,570 --> 00:02:22,810
that the front legs are not
touching the trunk anymore

45
00:02:22,810 --> 00:02:24,710
so I will put them into a pose

46
00:02:24,710 --> 00:02:27,760
where they just took off the tree trunk.

47
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:30,610
Since this in-between
is starting to define

48
00:02:30,610 --> 00:02:32,390
the emotion of the character

49
00:02:32,390 --> 00:02:36,020
because we have the extreme
poses and this is an in-between

50
00:02:36,020 --> 00:02:39,420
so it makes the transition
between those two poses,

51
00:02:39,420 --> 00:02:41,447
this is why I'm playing the animation

52
00:02:41,447 --> 00:02:44,680
of curbing through the frames a lot

53
00:02:44,680 --> 00:02:47,430
beyond matching the reference pose

54
00:02:47,430 --> 00:02:50,210
I'm trying to feel the
emotion of the character.

55
00:02:50,210 --> 00:02:52,520
Try to fix the orientation of the arms

56
00:02:52,520 --> 00:02:55,180
I'm facing some kind of
issues with the rings,

57
00:02:55,180 --> 00:02:57,890
some limitations, this is pretty usual

58
00:02:57,890 --> 00:03:00,970
with this kind of inverse
kinematic controllers

59
00:03:00,970 --> 00:03:02,420
so I reset the rotation

60
00:03:02,420 --> 00:03:05,600
and instead I'm using
those tweaker controllers

61
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:08,020
to give a better shape to the arms,

62
00:03:08,020 --> 00:03:09,600
so I advise you to deal

63
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:12,220
with the shape of the arms
using those controller

64
00:03:12,220 --> 00:03:14,113
for this specific animation.

65
00:03:15,850 --> 00:03:18,690
The next critical pose for me is the one

66
00:03:18,690 --> 00:03:21,803
whenever the character is contacting

67
00:03:21,803 --> 00:03:24,300
with the surface of the tree trunk,

68
00:03:24,300 --> 00:03:28,475
this contact frame is occurring
between frame 15 and 20

69
00:03:28,475 --> 00:03:31,000
so I will set it up from 18

70
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:34,170
for example, it really doesn't
matter from the time being

71
00:03:34,170 --> 00:03:36,320
we are just breeding the different poses

72
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:38,050
and then at the end of the video

73
00:03:38,050 --> 00:03:41,150
we will do a rapid timing paths.

74
00:03:41,150 --> 00:03:43,030
The first thing I do to switch

75
00:03:43,030 --> 00:03:45,980
to this new pose is to move the root bone

76
00:03:45,980 --> 00:03:49,400
so I've been trying to move
it using the same technique

77
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:51,330
as for the previous pose

78
00:03:51,330 --> 00:03:54,250
meaning that I'm moving the root bone

79
00:03:54,250 --> 00:03:57,890
entering a proper value with the keyboard,

80
00:03:57,890 --> 00:04:01,840
but since my character has no
contact with the tree trunk

81
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:05,660
it doesn't really matter if
shall not really accurate

82
00:04:05,660 --> 00:04:07,560
with the position of the root bone

83
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:10,820
right now, there won't be
that much of the problem

84
00:04:10,820 --> 00:04:13,360
we will be able to
offset a bit the position

85
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:16,430
of the root bone during
the polishing stage.

86
00:04:16,430 --> 00:04:18,490
What's important here is that

87
00:04:18,490 --> 00:04:21,120
since there is no contacting frame,

88
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:23,740
no part of the character contacting

89
00:04:23,740 --> 00:04:26,850
with the tree trunk or with the ground

90
00:04:26,850 --> 00:04:31,060
for example, the fact
that the root bone motion

91
00:04:31,060 --> 00:04:33,640
is not perfect, doesn't matter,

92
00:04:33,640 --> 00:04:37,630
we won't have any sliding foot effect here

93
00:04:37,630 --> 00:04:40,480
because there is no
contact with the ground.

94
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:43,170
So in the end, because of this foot motion

95
00:04:43,170 --> 00:04:46,540
and the squeal to have
everything perfectly aligned

96
00:04:46,540 --> 00:04:49,050
and to try, I spent
most of the time trying

97
00:04:49,050 --> 00:04:52,464
to figure out a way to
position the hands properly

98
00:04:52,464 --> 00:04:54,790
while it wasn't important,

99
00:04:54,790 --> 00:04:57,740
the only thing important is
to make sure that the position

100
00:04:57,740 --> 00:05:01,734
of the hands are correct
compared to frame 20

101
00:05:01,734 --> 00:05:05,180
and even if there is a bit of a challenge

102
00:05:05,180 --> 00:05:07,269
a bit of a difference this is something

103
00:05:07,269 --> 00:05:10,498
we'll be able to fix when we are polishing

104
00:05:10,498 --> 00:05:14,090
by moving the curve or
duplicating the curves,

105
00:05:14,090 --> 00:05:17,490
what's matter here is really
the pose of the character,

106
00:05:17,490 --> 00:05:21,120
so the front legs are
almost fully extended,

107
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:23,510
the back legs are catching up pointing

108
00:05:23,510 --> 00:05:27,360
toward their landing pose.

109
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:31,070
And finally, we have
still the hip sat down

110
00:05:31,070 --> 00:05:34,279
dragging a bit, but they
are slowly catching up,

111
00:05:34,279 --> 00:05:37,830
while the chest and head
are getting very close

112
00:05:37,830 --> 00:05:42,540
to their final pose or to
the pose we have on frame 20,

113
00:05:42,540 --> 00:05:44,730
so you can see on the reference

114
00:05:44,730 --> 00:05:46,700
that the curvature of the body

115
00:05:46,700 --> 00:05:51,700
of our character is slowly
getting back into it's S shape.

116
00:05:53,180 --> 00:05:56,050
The next pose is more of a breakdown

117
00:05:56,050 --> 00:05:58,581
that in in-between onto this breakdown

118
00:05:58,581 --> 00:06:01,760
between frame zero and
five, because on frame five

119
00:06:01,760 --> 00:06:06,500
our character ends a normal
angle contacting the tree trunk

120
00:06:06,500 --> 00:06:09,160
with all my read controller selected,

121
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:11,120
I'm pressing a Shift E,

122
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:14,120
then when I moved the mouse left to right

123
00:06:14,120 --> 00:06:16,900
I changed the value of the breakdown,

124
00:06:16,900 --> 00:06:19,250
I will set it to 50%,

125
00:06:19,250 --> 00:06:22,180
then they will left click to confirm

126
00:06:22,180 --> 00:06:24,850
this way blender has
automatically interpolated

127
00:06:25,850 --> 00:06:29,230
all the controller of my character by 50%

128
00:06:29,230 --> 00:06:31,890
between frame zero and frame five,

129
00:06:31,890 --> 00:06:35,760
now I don't want to move
the hand controllers,

130
00:06:35,760 --> 00:06:39,550
so I go back on frame zero
select one of the hand controller

131
00:06:39,550 --> 00:06:42,970
press Shift S snap the cursor to it,

132
00:06:42,970 --> 00:06:46,560
then I go back onto frame
two my break down pose

133
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:50,390
and press Shift S selection to cursor

134
00:06:50,390 --> 00:06:54,610
the hand will be snapped
on to the same position

135
00:06:54,610 --> 00:06:56,860
as on frame zero,

136
00:06:56,860 --> 00:07:01,145
I will repeat the process for
the other hand and this way

137
00:07:01,145 --> 00:07:06,145
my whole character body
and root has moved by 50%,

138
00:07:06,450 --> 00:07:11,450
and I can work on this pose
and the feet position is fixed,

139
00:07:12,700 --> 00:07:15,270
thanks to this little manipulation.

140
00:07:15,270 --> 00:07:20,270
So now I can work on the torso
controller to refine the pose

141
00:07:20,760 --> 00:07:22,780
and offset the different element

142
00:07:22,780 --> 00:07:27,650
because if everything
is interpolated by 50%

143
00:07:27,650 --> 00:07:31,380
I will have a very robotic
motion of my character.

144
00:07:31,380 --> 00:07:34,040
So here, as we have explained before

145
00:07:34,040 --> 00:07:36,570
during the reference analysis

146
00:07:36,570 --> 00:07:40,900
I'm pushing a lot the neck
and chest of my character

147
00:07:40,900 --> 00:07:43,570
while the hips are dragging a bit back,

148
00:07:43,570 --> 00:07:46,700
from there what I did is that I have taken

149
00:07:46,700 --> 00:07:48,944
all the key frame of each pose

150
00:07:48,944 --> 00:07:52,460
and I have set them every two frames,

151
00:07:52,460 --> 00:07:54,870
so one on frame zero one on frame two,

152
00:07:54,870 --> 00:07:57,730
four, six, eight, 10, and 12.

153
00:07:57,730 --> 00:08:02,490
I feel like this cycle
should be 12 frame long

154
00:08:02,490 --> 00:08:06,610
so I'm just kind of distributing
the different posts evenly

155
00:08:06,610 --> 00:08:08,905
for the time being because I'm not working

156
00:08:08,905 --> 00:08:12,270
on the timing of the animation right now

157
00:08:12,270 --> 00:08:14,863
but it does help reading the animation.

158
00:08:16,810 --> 00:08:19,585
The last pose I wanted
to create is the one

159
00:08:19,585 --> 00:08:23,100
where the back legs are
contacting with the tree trunk

160
00:08:24,110 --> 00:08:28,000
as explained why we were
locking the idle animation

161
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:31,980
you should create a
bring down pose each time

162
00:08:31,980 --> 00:08:35,830
there is a drastic change in
the pose of your character

163
00:08:35,830 --> 00:08:39,410
meaning that here the back feet are abohm

164
00:08:39,410 --> 00:08:42,240
and then they are
contacting with the surface

165
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:45,460
in this regard, their mechanical function

166
00:08:45,460 --> 00:08:49,620
and the way they move is changing a lot

167
00:08:49,620 --> 00:08:52,210
because when they are floating in the air

168
00:08:52,210 --> 00:08:54,730
you should be looking for arcs

169
00:08:54,730 --> 00:08:58,280
while when they are impacting
with the tree trunk,

170
00:08:58,280 --> 00:09:00,740
you're not looking anymore for arcs

171
00:09:00,740 --> 00:09:03,000
but mostly for a linear interpolation

172
00:09:04,090 --> 00:09:06,940
as the foot is sliding along the surface.

173
00:09:06,940 --> 00:09:09,290
So it's better to add a breakdown

174
00:09:09,290 --> 00:09:12,090
to this pose than trying
to figure this out

175
00:09:12,090 --> 00:09:13,760
during the polishing stage,

176
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:15,910
this pose was pretty quick to achieve

177
00:09:15,910 --> 00:09:18,210
because we have already depends

178
00:09:18,210 --> 00:09:21,710
on the front legs already
contacting the tree trunks

179
00:09:21,710 --> 00:09:23,850
and the only thing we
had to do is to make sure

180
00:09:23,850 --> 00:09:28,030
that the back legs are
contacting and the hips catch,

181
00:09:28,030 --> 00:09:32,039
I've made a quick timing paths
here, but I will show you

182
00:09:32,039 --> 00:09:35,383
how to get a better timing
paths in the next video.

183
00:09:37,012 --> 00:09:41,530
Lastly, I couldn't help
polishing a bit to tail motion

184
00:09:41,530 --> 00:09:46,530
but honestly, at this stage
it's mostly a waste of time,

185
00:09:47,250 --> 00:09:52,250
don't work the tail for the
time being since it's ending

186
00:09:52,380 --> 00:09:55,610
and following the body, we will work on it

187
00:09:55,610 --> 00:09:58,580
during the polishing stage
once we have finished

188
00:09:58,580 --> 00:10:00,430
the whole motion of the body.

189
00:10:00,430 --> 00:10:04,570
What was a little more
important here is to rotate

190
00:10:04,570 --> 00:10:07,237
around your character,
check out all the poses

191
00:10:07,237 --> 00:10:11,193
and then fix a bit the pole
target to give a better

192
00:10:11,193 --> 00:10:15,450
orientation to the knees and also check

193
00:10:15,450 --> 00:10:18,290
out the elbow tweaker bones,

194
00:10:18,290 --> 00:10:21,450
you can see that my elbows
are pointing in word

195
00:10:21,450 --> 00:10:23,920
and it doesn't look super natural,

196
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:27,900
so double check each poses
and check that the silhouette

197
00:10:27,900 --> 00:10:30,940
show character, the shape
of the arms of the legs

198
00:10:30,940 --> 00:10:34,900
et cetera, looks good
from every point of view.

199
00:10:34,900 --> 00:10:37,030
In the next video, we will revise

200
00:10:37,030 --> 00:10:39,480
the timing of this animation is still

201
00:10:39,480 --> 00:10:42,453
in step mode before jumping into spline.
