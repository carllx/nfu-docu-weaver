1
00:00:00,590 --> 00:00:02,670
- Let's gets starting with the blocking

2
00:00:02,670 --> 00:00:07,050
of the climbing cycle of
our squirrel character.

3
00:00:07,050 --> 00:00:10,370
For the previous animation,
we will start fresh.

4
00:00:10,370 --> 00:00:13,740
I will duplicate the keying action

5
00:00:13,740 --> 00:00:17,600
rename it off free climbing blocking

6
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:20,120
and make sure that it does affect chooser

7
00:00:20,120 --> 00:00:22,910
by clicking the little shield icon.

8
00:00:22,910 --> 00:00:26,210
I will select the rig
and instead of protecting

9
00:00:26,210 --> 00:00:28,700
the character vertically in pose mode,

10
00:00:28,700 --> 00:00:31,460
I will rotate it in object mode

11
00:00:31,460 --> 00:00:34,930
so that we can have a
vertical representation

12
00:00:34,930 --> 00:00:39,010
of the character but it
will still be moving forward

13
00:00:39,010 --> 00:00:41,140
whenever we are animating it.

14
00:00:41,140 --> 00:00:45,070
It's also better to
create a tree trunk dummy.

15
00:00:45,070 --> 00:00:48,220
So in object mode, I will press Shift + A

16
00:00:48,220 --> 00:00:51,210
and add a cylinder and I will scale it

17
00:00:51,210 --> 00:00:53,350
in edit mode vertically.

18
00:00:53,350 --> 00:00:56,890
I will make sure that
its silhouette is aligned

19
00:00:56,890 --> 00:00:59,620
with the z-axis so that it's aligned

20
00:00:59,620 --> 00:01:01,220
with the origin of the document.

21
00:01:02,130 --> 00:01:06,470
The initial pose I will
use the squashed pose

22
00:01:06,470 --> 00:01:09,030
of the character in the video reference.

23
00:01:09,030 --> 00:01:12,980
Can use the corresponding then
their file as a reference,

24
00:01:12,980 --> 00:01:15,350
all the picture in this video.

25
00:01:15,350 --> 00:01:18,120
First in object mode, I'm
make sure that my character

26
00:01:18,120 --> 00:01:21,650
is properly aligned with the tree trunk.

27
00:01:21,650 --> 00:01:24,670
I always start the blocking off of pose

28
00:01:24,670 --> 00:01:28,160
by moving the main controller of the body

29
00:01:28,160 --> 00:01:32,030
and trying to find the
contact pose for the feet.

30
00:01:32,030 --> 00:01:34,740
One important thing when
you watch a reference

31
00:01:34,740 --> 00:01:38,340
is to see the position of
the different body feature

32
00:01:38,340 --> 00:01:40,880
compared one to the other.

33
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:42,650
If we have a look to the back feet,

34
00:01:42,650 --> 00:01:45,590
they're more forward than the hips.

35
00:01:45,590 --> 00:01:49,120
The hips are currently hanging in the void

36
00:01:49,120 --> 00:01:52,890
and the back legs are pulling the body up.

37
00:01:52,890 --> 00:01:56,540
The tail motion on this
animation will be pretty subtle.

38
00:01:56,540 --> 00:02:00,280
So I just place it so
that it's smoothly hanging

39
00:02:00,280 --> 00:02:02,760
and not clipping with the tree truck.

40
00:02:02,760 --> 00:02:06,140
Then I'm working on the
feet and hand position

41
00:02:06,140 --> 00:02:09,400
so that they are contacting
with the tree trunk, why?

42
00:02:09,400 --> 00:02:14,400
You generally aligned the feet
with the running direction.

43
00:02:14,420 --> 00:02:16,750
In the case of this animation,

44
00:02:16,750 --> 00:02:20,840
I've opened the feet and
the hands in a V-shape.

45
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:24,030
This way, our character
will have a better grab

46
00:02:24,030 --> 00:02:25,530
on the tree trunk.

47
00:02:25,530 --> 00:02:27,200
When they look at my reference,

48
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:30,720
I would slightly push the hands up.

49
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:34,430
Imagine you are hanging
on to a wall or a tree,

50
00:02:34,430 --> 00:02:38,030
your arm will mainly be stretched.

51
00:02:38,030 --> 00:02:41,980
The main difference here is
that the character is very light

52
00:02:41,980 --> 00:02:44,990
so he won't be stretching his arm

53
00:02:44,990 --> 00:02:49,760
or his arm won't be as extended
as if he was very heavy.

54
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:52,240
But this is something
I will have to consider

55
00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:56,150
whenever I'm starting to
polish my character animation

56
00:02:56,150 --> 00:02:58,220
is make sure that we have the feeling,

57
00:02:58,220 --> 00:03:00,570
he's pulling himself up.

58
00:03:00,570 --> 00:03:04,950
Finally as I felt that the
character was a bit too squashed,

59
00:03:04,950 --> 00:03:09,950
I've just pulled a bit the
hips and the chest controller.

60
00:03:10,070 --> 00:03:12,563
And we are done with this first pose.

61
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:16,530
When it comes to block the second pose,

62
00:03:16,530 --> 00:03:20,750
I advise you to go for one
of the most extreme pose.

63
00:03:20,750 --> 00:03:23,510
Don't try to block the next pose

64
00:03:23,510 --> 00:03:25,570
in the emotion of the character.

65
00:03:25,570 --> 00:03:27,930
The second advice is that you can choose

66
00:03:27,930 --> 00:03:30,630
whether you move the root bone or not.

67
00:03:30,630 --> 00:03:32,770
I've decided to move the root bone

68
00:03:32,770 --> 00:03:36,520
and try to compensate
the position of the feet,

69
00:03:36,520 --> 00:03:39,740
and it was some kind of extra work.

70
00:03:39,740 --> 00:03:42,840
You can animate your character on place

71
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:44,890
and then during the polishing stage

72
00:03:44,890 --> 00:03:47,440
or during the splaining stage,

73
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:49,870
we will input some linear motion

74
00:03:49,870 --> 00:03:52,470
of the root bone to fix that.

75
00:03:52,470 --> 00:03:57,440
Important thing here is not
to answer any technical issue,

76
00:03:57,440 --> 00:04:00,100
but really to match the references.

77
00:04:00,100 --> 00:04:03,420
As the second extreme
pose, I've selected the one

78
00:04:03,420 --> 00:04:06,670
where our character is
about to lose contact

79
00:04:06,670 --> 00:04:07,970
with the tree trunk.

80
00:04:07,970 --> 00:04:10,980
The front legs are already not contacting

81
00:04:10,980 --> 00:04:12,850
the tree trunk anymore,

82
00:04:12,850 --> 00:04:15,780
but the front leg are
still in contact with it.

83
00:04:15,780 --> 00:04:17,600
The key feature we have seen that

84
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:20,010
during the reference analysis,

85
00:04:20,010 --> 00:04:24,060
is that the body is getting
closer to the tree trunk

86
00:04:24,060 --> 00:04:26,950
as the character is pushing the hips,

87
00:04:26,950 --> 00:04:30,160
chest and head get really extended,

88
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:33,090
the head and chest extend first

89
00:04:33,090 --> 00:04:36,480
and those three body features gets more

90
00:04:36,480 --> 00:04:40,140
or less aligned into a straight pose.

91
00:04:40,140 --> 00:04:44,640
So one important thing too is
that we have to push the pose.

92
00:04:44,640 --> 00:04:47,330
So here I feel like the pose is okay

93
00:04:47,330 --> 00:04:51,270
but not pushed as much as I liked it to.

94
00:04:51,270 --> 00:04:54,270
It's better to push it a little too much

95
00:04:54,270 --> 00:04:58,770
as it's going to be a
very fast-paced animation.

96
00:04:58,770 --> 00:05:02,720
So we need quite of a
striking silhouette change

97
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:06,470
of our character so that the
animation will read well.

98
00:05:06,470 --> 00:05:08,120
Only to the mistake I've made

99
00:05:08,120 --> 00:05:10,350
and I will need to fix later on,

100
00:05:10,350 --> 00:05:13,760
is that I've used the main body controller

101
00:05:13,760 --> 00:05:16,810
and pushed the character up a lot.

102
00:05:16,810 --> 00:05:18,900
So you can use the body controller

103
00:05:18,900 --> 00:05:21,340
for the left to right up and down motion,

104
00:05:21,340 --> 00:05:25,150
but avoid moving it too
much forward and back

105
00:05:25,150 --> 00:05:28,580
because this is a motion
that will be mostly generated

106
00:05:28,580 --> 00:05:33,260
by the root motion and the
locomotion of the character.

107
00:05:33,260 --> 00:05:35,950
Slightly adjust the hands of my character

108
00:05:35,950 --> 00:05:38,823
and I think we are good
to go for the next pose.

109
00:05:40,190 --> 00:05:43,870
As explained before, I
haven't made my life easier

110
00:05:43,870 --> 00:05:47,010
by choosing to move the root bone.

111
00:05:47,010 --> 00:05:50,964
So what I'm doing here is
that I'm trying to figure out

112
00:05:50,964 --> 00:05:54,700
how much of a distance
the character is moving

113
00:05:54,700 --> 00:05:56,380
during one jump.

114
00:05:56,380 --> 00:06:00,810
So I'm trying to figure out
a point on the tree trunk

115
00:06:00,810 --> 00:06:03,940
or the back of the tree and the head

116
00:06:03,940 --> 00:06:06,880
and hips position of the character.

117
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:10,130
In the end, I figured that the character

118
00:06:10,130 --> 00:06:12,930
was moving his whole body

119
00:06:12,930 --> 00:06:17,840
and the hips were getting
further away by one head.

120
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:22,490
So the character is jumping
off it's full body length

121
00:06:22,490 --> 00:06:24,440
plus one head.

122
00:06:24,440 --> 00:06:26,630
Since we are building a cycle,

123
00:06:26,630 --> 00:06:30,090
the first and last pose
should be the same.

124
00:06:30,090 --> 00:06:34,180
So I will duplicate the first
pose and move it on frame 20.

125
00:06:34,180 --> 00:06:37,150
And holding the D key and left clicking,

126
00:06:37,150 --> 00:06:39,140
I will draw some reference point

127
00:06:39,140 --> 00:06:41,640
to measure the position of the head

128
00:06:41,640 --> 00:06:44,560
and then the position of
the hips of the character.

129
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:46,710
So I move the base of the hips,

130
00:06:46,710 --> 00:06:50,200
one head further than
the position of the head

131
00:06:50,200 --> 00:06:51,830
on the previous pose.

132
00:06:51,830 --> 00:06:53,500
This is not rocket science,

133
00:06:53,500 --> 00:06:56,350
you can push it a little
further if you want

134
00:06:56,350 --> 00:07:01,100
it will make your jumping
motion a little more dynamic.

135
00:07:01,100 --> 00:07:03,670
The next pose I want to work on

136
00:07:03,670 --> 00:07:06,460
is when our character is airborne.

137
00:07:06,460 --> 00:07:10,270
So I just push a bit the root bone up

138
00:07:10,270 --> 00:07:13,370
because our character is
traveling through space.

139
00:07:13,370 --> 00:07:15,840
And then we can start
reworking the silhouette

140
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:17,650
of our character.

141
00:07:17,650 --> 00:07:19,940
This is the point where the front legs

142
00:07:19,940 --> 00:07:22,460
are fully extended forward,

143
00:07:22,460 --> 00:07:25,970
the body shape of the character
is pretty straightened

144
00:07:26,810 --> 00:07:30,630
but the head and the chest
are slowly catching up

145
00:07:30,630 --> 00:07:33,400
meaning that the distance
between those two

146
00:07:33,400 --> 00:07:35,680
is getting a little smaller

147
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:38,970
while the hips are really dragging.

148
00:07:38,970 --> 00:07:40,660
When you are posing the legs,

149
00:07:40,660 --> 00:07:43,730
make sure that you look
at it from every angles

150
00:07:43,730 --> 00:07:46,523
and realign the knees with the body.

151
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:50,210
I also make sure that both the feet

152
00:07:50,210 --> 00:07:54,310
and the ends of the character
are not symmetrical,

153
00:07:54,310 --> 00:07:56,560
It will look a bit boring.

154
00:07:56,560 --> 00:08:00,930
For this motion, I haven't
set any left to right motion

155
00:08:00,930 --> 00:08:04,100
into the spine nor any twisting.

156
00:08:04,100 --> 00:08:05,980
I guess there should be some

157
00:08:05,980 --> 00:08:09,340
but it's pretty hard to
figure out right now,

158
00:08:09,340 --> 00:08:12,890
while in the polishing,
based on the contacting pose

159
00:08:12,890 --> 00:08:16,800
we might be able to input a bit of it.

160
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:21,450
As our main key poses or
golden poses are now down,
