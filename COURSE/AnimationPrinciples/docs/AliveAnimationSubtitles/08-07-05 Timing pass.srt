00:00:01,620 --> 00:00:03,170
- [Instructor] Here is
the final timing pass

2
00:00:03,170 --> 00:00:05,320
for our blocking of the animation.

3
00:00:05,320 --> 00:00:07,620
As explained before, there is no motion

4
00:00:07,620 --> 00:00:09,500
between frame zero and frame five.

5
00:00:09,500 --> 00:00:12,510
Those first frames are just
here so that we can have a look

6
00:00:12,510 --> 00:00:13,730
through the whole scene,

7
00:00:13,730 --> 00:00:16,800
see our character in the fighting stance,

8
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:19,990
and start to think of
what's going to happen.

9
00:00:19,990 --> 00:00:24,510
From there, our character is
easing into the first bench.

10
00:00:24,510 --> 00:00:29,240
So, we first have three frames
later, the anticipation,

11
00:00:29,240 --> 00:00:32,580
with this moving forward
and a bit downward.

12
00:00:32,580 --> 00:00:34,010
A couple of frames later,

13
00:00:34,010 --> 00:00:37,450
we have our contact pose and
a couple of frames later,

14
00:00:37,450 --> 00:00:41,340
the current jab, with
another extended left arm

15
00:00:41,340 --> 00:00:43,860
and a frame later, the same pose,

16
00:00:43,860 --> 00:00:47,240
but with the arm back into position.

17
00:00:47,240 --> 00:00:50,220
This little trick creates
a more snappy impact.

18
00:00:50,220 --> 00:00:54,100
Then we have a fast transition
into the right cross.

19
00:00:54,100 --> 00:00:55,920
On only two frames,

20
00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:59,940
our character starts to
swing it's right arm.

21
00:00:59,940 --> 00:01:01,120
Two frames later,

22
00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:03,970
we have the impact with the bag.

23
00:01:03,970 --> 00:01:06,970
And one frame later, we get the overshoot.

24
00:01:06,970 --> 00:01:11,970
So this time we create the
overextension of the arm,

25
00:01:12,010 --> 00:01:14,350
a frame after the impact.

26
00:01:14,350 --> 00:01:17,470
so that there is more
the sense of penetration

27
00:01:17,470 --> 00:01:20,550
than just little snappy punch.

28
00:01:20,550 --> 00:01:22,520
And it takes three more frames

29
00:01:22,520 --> 00:01:24,720
for our character to recover

30
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:27,050
its normal body shape, let's say.

31
00:01:27,050 --> 00:01:28,980
Then over five frames,

32
00:01:28,980 --> 00:01:32,700
the right food is catching up
and then pushing, in a way,

33
00:01:32,700 --> 00:01:35,210
the left foot over two frames.

34
00:01:35,210 --> 00:01:37,540
From there, our character is ready to go

35
00:01:37,540 --> 00:01:39,410
into the anticipation of the hook.

36
00:01:39,410 --> 00:01:43,006
So he will ease out into the anticipation.

37
00:01:43,006 --> 00:01:47,260
So it will take five frames
to get into the anticipation

38
00:01:47,260 --> 00:01:49,547
and five additional frames of moving

39
00:01:49,547 --> 00:01:51,620
all the weaving overshoot.

40
00:01:51,620 --> 00:01:55,460
Or an exaggerated anticipation
so that the hook will look

41
00:01:55,460 --> 00:01:56,830
even more powerful.

42
00:01:56,830 --> 00:01:59,140
From there over a couple of frames,

43
00:01:59,140 --> 00:02:02,668
we have the fast swing,
one from later, the impact,

44
00:02:02,668 --> 00:02:05,015
two frame later the overshoot,

45
00:02:05,015 --> 00:02:08,070
and on frame forty seven, the recoil.

46
00:02:08,070 --> 00:02:09,150
On frame fifty,

47
00:02:09,150 --> 00:02:11,960
we have the down pose after the hook,

48
00:02:11,960 --> 00:02:15,670
then it takes six frame
for the right foot to reach

49
00:02:15,670 --> 00:02:16,980
its contact pose.

50
00:02:16,980 --> 00:02:20,100
And from there five
additional frames to get

51
00:02:20,100 --> 00:02:24,240
into the down pose that will
serve as the anticipation

52
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:25,710
before the switch kick.

53
00:02:25,710 --> 00:02:29,290
From our micro-anticipation
on frame sixty one,

54
00:02:29,290 --> 00:02:32,510
our character will be pushing
on two frames and will be

55
00:02:32,510 --> 00:02:34,230
airborne on frame sixty six.

56
00:02:34,230 --> 00:02:36,430
On there we are animating on once

57
00:02:36,430 --> 00:02:39,996
the contacting of the left
foot, then the right foot,

58
00:02:39,996 --> 00:02:42,390
then a slight down pose.

59
00:02:42,390 --> 00:02:45,950
From there, I want to build
a strong easing of the foot.

60
00:02:45,950 --> 00:02:49,807
So we have two frames for
the foot to leave the ground.

61
00:02:49,807 --> 00:02:54,807
And then it's animating on once
until the impact on the bag.

62
00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:57,960
The impact is put over all four frames,

63
00:02:57,960 --> 00:03:00,430
so that our character is holding the pose

64
00:03:00,430 --> 00:03:03,300
for a long time and need
to look more impactful.

65
00:03:03,300 --> 00:03:05,873
from there, the left foot is easing

66
00:03:05,873 --> 00:03:08,930
into a drop to what it's contact pose

67
00:03:08,930 --> 00:03:11,620
ten frames later on frame eight eight.

68
00:03:11,620 --> 00:03:13,620
Six frame later on the right foot,

69
00:03:13,620 --> 00:03:14,690
is contacting back,

70
00:03:14,690 --> 00:03:19,283
before easing five frames
later into the new idol pose.
