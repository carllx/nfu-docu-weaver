- [Tutor] Welcome to chapter six.

2
00:00:01,510 --> 00:00:04,900
In this chapter, we are
going to build another cycle

3
00:00:04,900 --> 00:00:07,860
and it's going to be vanilla walk cycle.

4
00:00:07,860 --> 00:00:11,160
As explained before, we
are doing this walk cycle

5
00:00:11,160 --> 00:00:15,270
after the run cycle, because
it's a little bit harder,

6
00:00:15,270 --> 00:00:19,400
since it's more subtle to
get an appealing result.

7
00:00:19,400 --> 00:00:22,890
As usual, we'll go through
a reference analysis

8
00:00:22,890 --> 00:00:27,250
and we'll try to identify
the main mechanism involved

9
00:00:27,250 --> 00:00:29,460
into a good walk cycle.

10
00:00:29,460 --> 00:00:33,350
Starting from scratch, we'll
build the main key poses

11
00:00:33,350 --> 00:00:38,350
of the walk cycle, and then
we'll mix our post to pose

12
00:00:38,380 --> 00:00:41,700
and layered approach to polish the walk.

13
00:00:41,700 --> 00:00:45,070
I will guide you through the whole process

14
00:00:45,070 --> 00:00:49,290
from polishing the feet to
the fingers of the character.

15
00:00:49,290 --> 00:00:50,493
Let's get started.
