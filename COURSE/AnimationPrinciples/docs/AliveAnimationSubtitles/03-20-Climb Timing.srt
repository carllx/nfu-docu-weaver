1
00:00:00,890 --> 00:00:03,060
- I will show you a quick method

2
00:00:03,060 --> 00:00:04,760
to double-check your timing.

3
00:00:04,760 --> 00:00:07,060
First we will check with root motion

4
00:00:07,060 --> 00:00:09,370
and then without root motion.

5
00:00:09,370 --> 00:00:11,510
I've already made a quick timing pass

6
00:00:11,510 --> 00:00:14,300
in the previous video
without explaining it,

7
00:00:14,300 --> 00:00:16,600
because it wasn't very good.

8
00:00:16,600 --> 00:00:18,380
The idea was just to check

9
00:00:18,380 --> 00:00:20,300
the follow of the different poses

10
00:00:20,300 --> 00:00:23,600
but you don't need to
work on timing for this.

11
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:25,670
Now is the timing path

12
00:00:25,670 --> 00:00:28,430
before I switch to spline.

13
00:00:28,430 --> 00:00:29,840
So to check it,

14
00:00:29,840 --> 00:00:31,550
since I have root motion

15
00:00:31,550 --> 00:00:34,460
I've kept my root activated,

16
00:00:34,460 --> 00:00:38,630
and I will now simply use
my quick favorite menu

17
00:00:38,630 --> 00:00:41,800
to calculate the motion
path of the root bone

18
00:00:41,800 --> 00:00:44,300
setting it from frame zero to frame 12.

19
00:00:44,300 --> 00:00:46,570
This way I will be able to see

20
00:00:46,570 --> 00:00:49,610
the spacing of my root bone

21
00:00:49,610 --> 00:00:52,770
between the different
poses we have created.

22
00:00:52,770 --> 00:00:57,770
And since the root bone is
supposed to have a linear motion

23
00:00:58,130 --> 00:01:00,740
since we are doing a cycle,

24
00:01:00,740 --> 00:01:04,560
I can try to make the
spacing match the timing.

25
00:01:04,560 --> 00:01:06,330
If we have a loop to the spacing

26
00:01:06,330 --> 00:01:09,370
between frame three and frame five,

27
00:01:09,370 --> 00:01:11,550
we can see that the position of

28
00:01:11,550 --> 00:01:14,610
the root bone hasn't changed that much.

29
00:01:14,610 --> 00:01:18,093
It means that since we have
a linear interpolation,

30
00:01:19,660 --> 00:01:22,270
those two keyframes should be very close,

31
00:01:22,270 --> 00:01:23,260
one to the other.

32
00:01:23,260 --> 00:01:27,230
So I will offset the frame
five onto frame four.

33
00:01:27,230 --> 00:01:31,860
Now if I keep this mindset
to analyze my spacing

34
00:01:31,860 --> 00:01:35,420
I can see that from
frame zero to frame one,

35
00:01:35,420 --> 00:01:37,840
I have a pretty large spacing

36
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:39,790
and I have the same spacing

37
00:01:39,790 --> 00:01:42,350
between frame one and frame three.

38
00:01:42,350 --> 00:01:44,090
So I have the same spacing

39
00:01:44,090 --> 00:01:45,820
between those two poses

40
00:01:45,820 --> 00:01:48,040
or almost the same spacing

41
00:01:48,040 --> 00:01:49,720
but the timing is different.

42
00:01:49,720 --> 00:01:51,850
The first one is on one frame,

43
00:01:51,850 --> 00:01:53,940
the second one on two frames.

44
00:01:53,940 --> 00:01:56,170
So I will offset my keyframes

45
00:01:56,170 --> 00:01:59,180
from frame three to frame two.

46
00:01:59,180 --> 00:02:01,260
So in the end I am animating

47
00:02:01,260 --> 00:02:03,993
in those first four poses onwards.

48
00:02:04,980 --> 00:02:06,740
And during the polishing stage

49
00:02:06,740 --> 00:02:09,120
I will be able to revise a bit

50
00:02:09,120 --> 00:02:11,810
the spacing between the
different part of the body.

51
00:02:11,810 --> 00:02:13,830
From there I can evaluate

52
00:02:13,830 --> 00:02:18,360
the distance between the
frame seven and the frame 10,

53
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:20,810
and the frame three and the frame seven.

54
00:02:20,810 --> 00:02:23,620
And the spacing is quite the same as

55
00:02:23,620 --> 00:02:25,870
between frame zero and frame two,

56
00:02:25,870 --> 00:02:29,800
so timing-wise I think that
I should have two frames

57
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:32,170
between my airborne pose

58
00:02:32,170 --> 00:02:34,410
and the contacting poses.

59
00:02:34,410 --> 00:02:37,100
So I will move my airborne pose

60
00:02:37,100 --> 00:02:39,530
from frame seven to frame five,

61
00:02:39,530 --> 00:02:41,260
and then I should be moving

62
00:02:41,260 --> 00:02:43,440
frame 10, 11, and 12

63
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:46,270
on frame seven or frame eight.

64
00:02:46,270 --> 00:02:49,230
Again the timing and spacing of

65
00:02:49,230 --> 00:02:52,670
the animation will be refined during

66
00:02:52,670 --> 00:02:56,510
the polishing stage in spline modes,

67
00:02:56,510 --> 00:02:59,250
but this is a good way

68
00:02:59,250 --> 00:03:04,070
if you can't feel your
timing to check it out.

69
00:03:04,070 --> 00:03:06,041
Try to make it logical.

70
00:03:06,041 --> 00:03:08,150
And it does show case again

71
00:03:08,150 --> 00:03:10,500
that having a detailed blocking

72
00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:13,780
can really help the animation process.

73
00:03:13,780 --> 00:03:16,280
If you have animated your character

74
00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:19,140
without moving the root bone

75
00:03:19,140 --> 00:03:22,030
then use the features of your character

76
00:03:22,030 --> 00:03:24,820
that are contacting the tree trunk

77
00:03:24,820 --> 00:03:26,630
to guess the spacing.

78
00:03:26,630 --> 00:03:30,350
When I check the back-right
foot of my character,

79
00:03:30,350 --> 00:03:31,800
I have the same spacing

80
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:34,110
between frame zero and one

81
00:03:34,110 --> 00:03:36,970
and between frame one and three.

82
00:03:36,970 --> 00:03:40,120
So I can choose to move
the pose number three

83
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:41,820
onto frame number two.

84
00:03:41,820 --> 00:03:44,870
And when I see the different of spacing

85
00:03:44,870 --> 00:03:47,570
between the current pose and the next one,

86
00:03:47,570 --> 00:03:51,430
it's even smaller so
this change of position

87
00:03:51,430 --> 00:03:54,340
should happen within one frame,

88
00:03:54,340 --> 00:03:55,820
even less than one frame

89
00:03:55,820 --> 00:03:58,230
so I will move it onto frame three.

90
00:03:58,230 --> 00:04:01,000
Then I want my character to float a bit

91
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:04,350
so I will keep in airborne for two frames,

92
00:04:04,350 --> 00:04:06,510
for example, I can track

93
00:04:06,510 --> 00:04:10,640
the front hands to see
the different of spacing

94
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:12,520
between those two frames,

95
00:04:12,520 --> 00:04:16,730
and I believe that this
airborne position will be

96
00:04:16,730 --> 00:04:19,440
the extreme so it will
be quite of right in

97
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:21,050
the middle of the jump,

98
00:04:21,050 --> 00:04:23,150
so I can move frame 10

99
00:04:23,150 --> 00:04:24,850
and all the next poses

100
00:04:24,850 --> 00:04:26,290
onto frame seven.

101
00:04:26,290 --> 00:04:29,640
So in the end, during our blocking stage

102
00:04:29,640 --> 00:04:34,640
we have created almost
a pose for each frame,

103
00:04:34,900 --> 00:04:37,050
and this is because we are working

104
00:04:37,050 --> 00:04:40,250
on the fast motion animation.

105
00:04:40,250 --> 00:04:44,310
And this will happen when
you work on combat animation

106
00:04:44,310 --> 00:04:46,890
for example, where your character

107
00:04:46,890 --> 00:04:48,890
change poses very fast.

108
00:04:48,890 --> 00:04:51,630
You can't keep an empty frame

109
00:04:51,630 --> 00:04:55,110
if there is a lot movement
that happen in this frame,

110
00:04:55,110 --> 00:04:57,430
you will have to detail your blocking.

111
00:04:57,430 --> 00:04:59,350
The good news here is that

112
00:04:59,350 --> 00:05:03,283
it's going to be way easier
to polish this animation.
