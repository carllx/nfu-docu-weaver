00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:02,030
- [Instructor] In the
beginning of this chapter,

2
00:00:02,030 --> 00:00:04,870
we've been talking about exaggeration

3
00:00:04,870 --> 00:00:06,060
and line of action.

4
00:00:06,060 --> 00:00:10,160
Exaggeration can be
used to amplify feeling.

5
00:00:10,160 --> 00:00:12,140
If you want to communicate anger,

6
00:00:12,140 --> 00:00:14,510
just make your character mad, for example.

7
00:00:14,510 --> 00:00:18,420
But we have also seen that
we can use exaggeration

8
00:00:18,420 --> 00:00:22,760
to give whether more impact
or more freely to the motion.

9
00:00:22,760 --> 00:00:27,180
Look at all, the Trident
here is completely bent,

10
00:00:27,180 --> 00:00:29,370
helping to read the arc of motion.

11
00:00:29,370 --> 00:00:32,110
Next frame, all the limbs are reshaped

12
00:00:32,110 --> 00:00:34,890
to exaggerate this pinning
motion of the character

13
00:00:35,910 --> 00:00:37,350
or on this landing pose.

14
00:00:37,350 --> 00:00:40,427
The character is stretched
toward the ground

15
00:00:40,427 --> 00:00:43,120
clearly supporting the line of action

16
00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:45,230
and the directionality of the jump.

17
00:00:45,230 --> 00:00:48,680
And if you did your homework,
this should remind you,

18
00:00:48,680 --> 00:00:51,320
this should remind you
something, right there.

19
00:00:51,320 --> 00:00:53,410
Whenever we are stretching the ball,

20
00:00:53,410 --> 00:00:55,200
we create some kind of smear

21
00:00:55,200 --> 00:00:57,650
and we are exaggerating its motion

22
00:00:57,650 --> 00:00:58,847
and the same occur

23
00:00:58,847 --> 00:01:01,340
whenever we are squashing
the ball on the ground.

24
00:01:01,340 --> 00:01:05,690
It's another exaggeration
that better sell the impact.

25
00:01:05,690 --> 00:01:09,160
So how can we apply those
principles to our character?

26
00:01:09,160 --> 00:01:12,450
When we are first in the
light the reference pose

27
00:01:12,450 --> 00:01:15,440
output the different line
of action of the pose

28
00:01:15,440 --> 00:01:17,610
using the red and orange line.

29
00:01:17,610 --> 00:01:20,010
So now what if we push those lines?

30
00:01:20,010 --> 00:01:21,990
What if we exaggerate them?

31
00:01:21,990 --> 00:01:26,240
The goal is to build
our shape or silhouette

32
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:29,170
based on the motion of the character

33
00:01:29,170 --> 00:01:33,680
as if he was pulled by the
inertia of the movement.

34
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:37,810
As our line of faction is
curving, just push the curve.

35
00:01:37,810 --> 00:01:42,360
And as our character is twisting,
just support the twists,

36
00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:46,300
creating a rotation motion
within the hum and the sword.

37
00:01:46,300 --> 00:01:50,890
We can also build a strong
smear upon the sword

38
00:01:50,890 --> 00:01:53,220
to simulate motion blur.

39
00:01:53,220 --> 00:01:56,050
To do it, let's go back into pose mode.

40
00:01:56,050 --> 00:01:58,740
I will duplicate the initial pose

41
00:01:58,740 --> 00:02:00,730
and I will start by pushing

42
00:02:00,730 --> 00:02:04,210
the center of gravity of
our character to the right,

43
00:02:04,210 --> 00:02:06,520
in the direction of the motion

44
00:02:06,520 --> 00:02:09,890
or in the direction of
the force is applying

45
00:02:09,890 --> 00:02:13,940
to strike the ball or maybe
cut is opponent in half

46
00:02:13,940 --> 00:02:17,770
to be able to shape the silhouette
of our character at will

47
00:02:17,770 --> 00:02:20,360
we will need to enable the tweaker bones.

48
00:02:20,360 --> 00:02:22,030
All the yellow controllers,

49
00:02:22,030 --> 00:02:25,340
I'll use to reshape each part of the arms,

50
00:02:25,340 --> 00:02:28,120
the legs, torso, or even the whip.

51
00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:30,300
So as we need in the previous video,

52
00:02:30,300 --> 00:02:32,870
I'm slightly pushing the pose.

53
00:02:32,870 --> 00:02:36,730
And then I will start using
those tweaker controllers,

54
00:02:36,730 --> 00:02:38,560
starting with the left leg.

55
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:43,060
My goal will be to shape the
whole left side of my character

56
00:02:43,972 --> 00:02:46,010
as a single curve.

57
00:02:46,010 --> 00:02:49,520
Note that I will mainly
build the shape to camera.

58
00:02:49,520 --> 00:02:51,400
It's all down to create smears

59
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:53,650
that can read from all the angles

60
00:02:53,650 --> 00:02:56,100
and focusing on the camera point of view

61
00:02:56,100 --> 00:02:59,920
will alow you to push
the pose even further.

62
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:02,570
The bigger knee tweaker controller

63
00:03:02,570 --> 00:03:04,820
allows you to push the knee with the thigh

64
00:03:04,820 --> 00:03:06,090
and shin following.

65
00:03:06,090 --> 00:03:08,980
While the smallest one will allow you

66
00:03:08,980 --> 00:03:12,910
to shape each joint of
this thigh and the shin.

67
00:03:12,910 --> 00:03:14,800
So, as we did so far,

68
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:17,230
just repeat the process several time.

69
00:03:17,230 --> 00:03:18,830
Push should be the pose.

70
00:03:18,830 --> 00:03:21,910
Shape the arm and the
leg into a curvy shape.

71
00:03:21,910 --> 00:03:24,760
And whenever you reach a satisfying shape,

72
00:03:24,760 --> 00:03:28,600
just try to push it by
repeating the process.

73
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:30,260
As you get more experience,

74
00:03:30,260 --> 00:03:32,930
you will be able to reach your extreme

75
00:03:32,930 --> 00:03:34,990
or exaggeration faster.

76
00:03:34,990 --> 00:03:38,520
Another important thing
is not to over-focus

77
00:03:38,520 --> 00:03:40,520
on one part of the character,

78
00:03:40,520 --> 00:03:43,480
and this is why you
should often add a loop

79
00:03:43,480 --> 00:03:45,310
to the silhouette of short character.

80
00:03:45,310 --> 00:03:47,610
The first step to give a better shape

81
00:03:47,610 --> 00:03:50,110
to the sword is to first bend it.

82
00:03:50,110 --> 00:03:54,120
To do so, you can use the sword
master rotational controller

83
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:56,510
available on the root of the blade

84
00:03:56,510 --> 00:03:59,580
by pressing R and D twice, I can rotate it

85
00:03:59,580 --> 00:04:01,740
along its local Z axis.

86
00:04:01,740 --> 00:04:04,480
Then you can use each
individual controllers

87
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:08,480
to whether tweak the rotation
or location or to scale them.

88
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:12,810
Here, I'm currently scaling
them along their local X axis.

89
00:04:12,810 --> 00:04:14,570
Starting from the tip of the sword

90
00:04:14,570 --> 00:04:17,450
And then going up until
the root of the sword.

91
00:04:17,450 --> 00:04:21,470
Look, all, we already improve
the character's silhouette.

92
00:04:21,470 --> 00:04:25,160
And we do feel like the
sword is currently swinging.

93
00:04:25,160 --> 00:04:29,100
From this point, my goal would
only be to push the pose.

94
00:04:29,100 --> 00:04:33,580
So I need to accentuate
the curvature of the body

95
00:04:33,580 --> 00:04:36,940
on the left side so that
I have better continuity

96
00:04:36,940 --> 00:04:40,010
between the left leg and the torso.

97
00:04:40,010 --> 00:04:43,100
This will support the line
of action of our character.

98
00:04:43,100 --> 00:04:46,680
I will also slightly tweak
the shape of the blade,

99
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:48,360
so that it is smoother.

100
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:51,970
I just need to re walk
a bit the X local scale

101
00:04:51,970 --> 00:04:53,800
of the different tweaker bones

102
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:56,230
to avoid those jacket profiles.

103
00:04:56,230 --> 00:04:59,740
So don't forget to test each controller.

104
00:04:59,740 --> 00:05:03,380
I've also used the tweaker
bone within the torso

105
00:05:03,380 --> 00:05:05,800
to give it a more curved shape.

106
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:08,160
Progressively push the pose,

107
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:10,240
and don't be afraid to fail.

108
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:13,840
If you can't nail a good pose at once

109
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:15,390
that's perfectly fine.

110
00:05:15,390 --> 00:05:18,740
While I do believe I ended
up with a satisfying pose,

111
00:05:18,740 --> 00:05:22,150
I am convinced it can be improved a lot

112
00:05:22,150 --> 00:05:24,130
and a more experienced animator

113
00:05:24,130 --> 00:05:28,480
will probably get a better
pose than mine faster.

114
00:05:28,480 --> 00:05:32,540
As any other art form
becoming good at animation

115
00:05:32,540 --> 00:05:34,910
is just a matter of practicing.

116
00:05:34,910 --> 00:05:38,130
And someone practicing
every day for four hours

117
00:05:38,130 --> 00:05:40,890
will be better than someone
practicing once a week

118
00:05:40,890 --> 00:05:43,800
for one hour,
while it may sound abused,

119
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:46,240
this is something I'd like to remind you,

120
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:48,770
And I will probably remind you often

121
00:05:48,770 --> 00:05:50,690
during this whole course.

122
00:05:50,690 --> 00:05:53,030
And if you lack of confidence,

123
00:05:53,030 --> 00:05:56,180
just stop telling yourself
that you lack of talent.

124
00:05:56,180 --> 00:05:58,390
I personally don't believe in talent

125
00:05:58,390 --> 00:06:02,010
and whenever you meet any
artist that is very good

126
00:06:02,010 --> 00:06:04,750
as it's art and you make the effort

127
00:06:04,750 --> 00:06:06,680
to dig a bit into his career.

128
00:06:06,680 --> 00:06:08,860
You understand that they don't land there

129
00:06:08,860 --> 00:06:10,110
because they were talented,

130
00:06:10,110 --> 00:06:12,970
but just because they were working a lot.

131
00:06:12,970 --> 00:06:15,000
So I will let you there.

132
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,900
Don't hesitate to experiment
with the body shape,

133
00:06:17,900 --> 00:06:20,660
stretch the EDD to give it speed.

134
00:06:20,660 --> 00:06:24,360
Just try to affirm. And don't
forget that it's okay to fail.

135
00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:26,910
So if this pose doesn't look right to you

136
00:06:26,910 --> 00:06:29,447
just restart from scratch.

137
00:06:29,447 --> 00:06:32,197
(relaxing music)
