- [Instructor] I'd like
to finish this chapter

2
00:00:02,240 --> 00:00:04,370
with a little tip video.

3
00:00:04,370 --> 00:00:06,590
We have seen in the previous chapters

4
00:00:06,590 --> 00:00:09,470
that we can use the NLA editor

5
00:00:09,470 --> 00:00:11,850
to layer different animations

6
00:00:11,850 --> 00:00:13,860
and modify the current one.

7
00:00:13,860 --> 00:00:16,100
To create an ad term, for example,

8
00:00:16,100 --> 00:00:19,940
or to transition between
two different animations.

9
00:00:19,940 --> 00:00:23,950
But what you can do to
rapidly modify your run cycle

10
00:00:23,950 --> 00:00:28,340
and create iterations is to
simply offset different curves

11
00:00:28,340 --> 00:00:30,360
on your main controllers.

12
00:00:30,360 --> 00:00:34,670
For example, here, I've offset
the X quaternion rotation

13
00:00:34,670 --> 00:00:35,920
of the torso.

14
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:39,640
Now, I'm doing the same
with the neck controller.

15
00:00:39,640 --> 00:00:43,110
I will do the same with
the hips, with the chest,

16
00:00:43,110 --> 00:00:45,400
and this is very easy to push those curves

17
00:00:45,400 --> 00:00:49,890
to get a totally new
attitude for our character.

18
00:00:49,890 --> 00:00:51,830
On a locomotion cycle,

19
00:00:51,830 --> 00:00:54,780
you will generally favorize the rotation

20
00:00:54,780 --> 00:00:58,350
around the x-axis of the
different torso controller.

21
00:00:58,350 --> 00:01:02,730
But you can also move the Y
location of the torso root,

22
00:01:02,730 --> 00:01:06,050
and get a more cartoony,
afraid-like run cycle.

23
00:01:06,050 --> 00:01:08,950
Or in the other end,
push everything forward

24
00:01:08,950 --> 00:01:13,950
so that you get a way more
accelerated, dynamical run cycle.

25
00:01:15,090 --> 00:01:17,320
This is a very good and fast technique

26
00:01:17,320 --> 00:01:20,820
to explore different
versions of your cycle.

27
00:01:20,820 --> 00:01:24,480
And that can be very useful
in a studio environment

28
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:27,690
to explore different
moods for your run cycle.

29
00:01:27,690 --> 00:01:30,510
You can play with all the
different controllers.

30
00:01:30,510 --> 00:01:34,340
You can offset the Y location
of the foot, for example,

31
00:01:34,340 --> 00:01:37,830
so that they will be
offset forward or backward

32
00:01:37,830 --> 00:01:39,480
during the run cycle.

33
00:01:39,480 --> 00:01:42,360
You may want to fix the neck orientation

34
00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:44,990
using the secondary controllers.

35
00:01:44,990 --> 00:01:48,200
In one word, have fun with your animation!

36
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:51,680
And make additional
use of the work you did

37
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:53,350
on this run cycle.

38
00:01:53,350 --> 00:01:56,520
It will sure need a pass of polish

39
00:01:56,520 --> 00:02:00,040
once you've totally changed
the pose of your character,

40
00:02:00,040 --> 00:02:04,660
but it's a very fast and painless
way to explore new poses,

41
00:02:04,660 --> 00:02:08,033
new attitude, and bring
life to your character.
