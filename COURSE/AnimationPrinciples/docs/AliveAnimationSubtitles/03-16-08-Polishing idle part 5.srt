1
00:00:00,859 --> 00:00:05,293
This is the final part of the
polishing stage of the idle.

2
00:00:06,300 --> 00:00:07,740
It's gonna be a quick one

3
00:00:07,740 --> 00:00:10,630
because there is not
that much of an action.

4
00:00:10,630 --> 00:00:15,610
In the end, our character is
getting into its anticipation

5
00:00:15,610 --> 00:00:20,290
before jumping into the run
cycle to flee the danger.

6
00:00:20,290 --> 00:00:23,930
You now should know that we
are going to track all the arts

7
00:00:23,930 --> 00:00:26,270
especially the head motion.

8
00:00:26,270 --> 00:00:28,240
For this segment of the animation,

9
00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:31,850
the body controller
will lead the animation.

10
00:00:31,850 --> 00:00:35,810
Then the chest is dragging,
then the head is dragging.

11
00:00:35,810 --> 00:00:39,533
We can really feel that
the head is getting

12
00:00:39,533 --> 00:00:42,523
(indistinct) by the hips
motion of the character.

13
00:00:43,940 --> 00:00:45,380
And since after the idle,

14
00:00:45,380 --> 00:00:50,250
we have a pretty extreme
motion with our run cycle.

15
00:00:50,250 --> 00:00:55,250
The idea was to eat the
extreme pose on frame 104.

16
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:58,870
And on the next pose, we will push

17
00:00:58,870 --> 00:01:01,910
that extreme compressing our character

18
00:01:01,910 --> 00:01:06,910
to a maximum before it goes
into the jumping action.

19
00:01:08,800 --> 00:01:12,070
Since most of the last
pose were duplicated

20
00:01:12,070 --> 00:01:13,840
from the run cycle,

21
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:16,710
the handle of the curve might be rotated.

22
00:01:16,710 --> 00:01:21,120
So, I will select them, press
V and switch to auto clump.

23
00:01:21,120 --> 00:01:24,110
Then polishing the body
controller was pretty fast.

24
00:01:24,110 --> 00:01:27,540
I, (indistinct) a bit on
to the rotation curves

25
00:01:27,540 --> 00:01:32,380
so that I get a bit of easing
before reaching the frame 104

26
00:01:32,380 --> 00:01:34,800
which is our extreme pose

27
00:01:34,800 --> 00:01:38,870
that we are going to push on frame 105.

28
00:01:38,870 --> 00:01:42,019
Then I've worked on the chest rotation,

29
00:01:42,019 --> 00:01:45,540
the idea was to make the chest dragging.

30
00:01:45,540 --> 00:01:48,150
So, I've slightly delayed the rotation

31
00:01:48,150 --> 00:01:51,840
by pulling a bit the curves down

32
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:54,650
toward their previous value.

33
00:01:54,650 --> 00:01:59,490
And as I reach frame 103,
I slightly rotate the curve

34
00:01:59,490 --> 00:02:02,580
so that I get a natural overshoot.

35
00:02:02,580 --> 00:02:06,410
'Cause I'm getting a nice
arc with a nice spacing,

36
00:02:06,410 --> 00:02:09,700
you will see me pushing
the X rotation curve

37
00:02:09,700 --> 00:02:11,543
down on frame 105.

38
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:15,320
This is where I'm really pushing the pose

39
00:02:15,320 --> 00:02:19,593
to have a very strong anticipation
before the jump forward.

40
00:02:20,980 --> 00:02:23,388
Polishing the head
rotation was pretty simple.

41
00:02:23,388 --> 00:02:25,730
I've made the head dragging

42
00:02:25,730 --> 00:02:30,450
and I got rid of any twisting
or unwanted rotation.

43
00:02:30,450 --> 00:02:34,250
The idea is to get a very clean rotation

44
00:02:34,250 --> 00:02:39,250
toward the extreme pose as our
character is going to flee.

45
00:02:39,940 --> 00:02:43,570
There is no secondary motion in the head

46
00:02:43,570 --> 00:02:46,740
because it's a very fast transition

47
00:02:46,740 --> 00:02:49,350
to the anticipation before the run.

48
00:02:49,350 --> 00:02:54,160
Then I've quickly reworked
the heels animation

49
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:58,340
to make sure that their timing
was a bit offset compared

50
00:02:58,340 --> 00:03:01,560
to the head timing and
the whole body timing.

51
00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:04,290
The idea is to change the pose of the head

52
00:03:04,290 --> 00:03:08,200
within one or two frames to
get to very snappy rotation,

53
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:11,130
very snappy motion of the heels.

54
00:03:11,130 --> 00:03:14,860
Then I spent some time
trying to create an eye blink

55
00:03:14,860 --> 00:03:17,420
as the character while
he's rotating his head

56
00:03:17,420 --> 00:03:20,950
but I didn't kept this additional motion.

57
00:03:20,950 --> 00:03:23,460
Because as the eyes are blinking

58
00:03:23,460 --> 00:03:27,240
it creates a slight
glitch into the animation.

59
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:32,240
And we already have a very fast
motion of the head rotating

60
00:03:32,290 --> 00:03:37,290
but the silhouette of our
character get a drastic change

61
00:03:37,340 --> 00:03:41,450
and it creates a lot
of visual information.

62
00:03:41,450 --> 00:03:44,460
Adding the eye blink on top of this,

63
00:03:44,460 --> 00:03:49,230
make this portion of the
animation very noisy in the end.

64
00:03:49,230 --> 00:03:53,210
The other thing is that, this
black dot that is the eye

65
00:03:53,210 --> 00:03:58,210
of our character, really help
tracking the head motion.

66
00:03:58,360 --> 00:04:01,560
So, it really helps the audience following

67
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:05,440
the head rotation in this particular case.

68
00:04:05,440 --> 00:04:08,270
So, if you make the eye disappear

69
00:04:08,270 --> 00:04:11,280
while the character is rotating very fast,

70
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:15,930
it's like, he blinks and
then he's in another pose.

71
00:04:15,930 --> 00:04:18,270
That really doesn't read well.

72
00:04:18,270 --> 00:04:20,775
So in end, I've just slightly squashed

73
00:04:20,775 --> 00:04:25,020
the eyes so that we get
a different head shape

74
00:04:25,020 --> 00:04:28,160
but I've kept the eyes opened.

75
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:30,075
So, adding secondary motion

76
00:04:30,075 --> 00:04:35,075
will sure bring more
appeal to your animation,

77
00:04:35,450 --> 00:04:38,610
but sometime it will
make sure animation worst

78
00:04:38,610 --> 00:04:41,650
by destroying its readability.

79
00:04:41,650 --> 00:04:44,945
So, be careful with this and if adding

80
00:04:44,945 --> 00:04:48,350
this kind of secondary
motion then looks weird

81
00:04:48,350 --> 00:04:52,340
and you can't identify the
problem on your animation

82
00:04:52,340 --> 00:04:54,060
just get rid of it.

83
00:04:54,060 --> 00:04:56,670
Secondary motion like an eye blink

84
00:04:56,670 --> 00:05:00,290
is here to support the animation.

85
00:05:00,290 --> 00:05:03,530
To make it more readable
or more interesting.

86
00:05:03,530 --> 00:05:05,000
When polishing the hips,

87
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,146
I've just make it drag a bit compared

88
00:05:07,146 --> 00:05:10,260
to the main body controller,

89
00:05:10,260 --> 00:05:14,020
and I've made sure that I
add some kind of big drop

90
00:05:14,020 --> 00:05:18,100
between frame 104 and 105

91
00:05:18,100 --> 00:05:22,473
to again push the pause on frame 105.

92
00:05:22,473 --> 00:05:26,840
This is going to be our micro
anticipation before the jump

93
00:05:26,840 --> 00:05:30,340
so every controller that defines

94
00:05:30,340 --> 00:05:33,703
the silhouette of our character
should be pushed a bit.

95
00:05:34,850 --> 00:05:37,200
The feet steps were very fast.

96
00:05:37,200 --> 00:05:39,020
There is nothing new compared

97
00:05:39,020 --> 00:05:41,330
to the previous polishing stage.

98
00:05:41,330 --> 00:05:43,610
Just make sure that you
have different timing

99
00:05:43,610 --> 00:05:45,510
for the different feet.

100
00:05:45,510 --> 00:05:48,770
And make sure that your
spacing is correct,

101
00:05:48,770 --> 00:05:51,680
avoiding easing whenever the foot is going

102
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:53,910
to contact with the ground.

103
00:05:53,910 --> 00:05:58,100
This is why I almost
always switch my contacting

104
00:05:58,100 --> 00:06:02,830
location channels to vector.

105
00:06:02,830 --> 00:06:06,450
And then as usual, I
will polish a bit more

106
00:06:06,450 --> 00:06:10,130
the foot motion by
inputting a bit of rotation

107
00:06:10,130 --> 00:06:14,930
to make the tip of the feet
drag compared to their location.

108
00:06:14,930 --> 00:06:18,310
One super important
secondary motion I wanted

109
00:06:18,310 --> 00:06:20,660
to add was the breathing motion.

110
00:06:20,660 --> 00:06:23,800
To create it, you have to
use the chest controller,

111
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:27,630
and use the X and Z scale channels.

112
00:06:27,630 --> 00:06:31,490
Because the Y scale channel will push

113
00:06:31,490 --> 00:06:33,980
in a way the head forward

114
00:06:33,980 --> 00:06:38,350
while the X and Z scale will
make the chest slightly bigger.

115
00:06:38,350 --> 00:06:42,480
To figure this out, I've
just been moving the curve

116
00:06:42,480 --> 00:06:46,470
up and down and see how
my character behaves.

117
00:06:46,470 --> 00:06:48,630
And once I was happy with it,

118
00:06:48,630 --> 00:06:52,990
I've tried to find the right
spacing for this animation.

119
00:06:52,990 --> 00:06:54,520
After a couple of tests,

120
00:06:54,520 --> 00:06:59,463
I found that using six frame
to make a full breathing cycle,

121
00:07:00,520 --> 00:07:04,930
kind of marched what I wanted
to have for this character.

122
00:07:04,930 --> 00:07:07,000
When you watch the reference, you can see

123
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:10,290
that the belly of the
character is moving very fast.

124
00:07:10,290 --> 00:07:13,940
And this is very common,
the smaller an animal

125
00:07:13,940 --> 00:07:16,560
the faster we'll be it's breathing.

126
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:20,888
I haven't created any breathing variation

127
00:07:20,888 --> 00:07:23,670
on this animation because again,

128
00:07:23,670 --> 00:07:28,460
that will take time and
the benefit was pretty low,

129
00:07:28,460 --> 00:07:30,637
but adding the secondary motion

130
00:07:30,637 --> 00:07:33,220
of the breathing was very important

131
00:07:33,220 --> 00:07:36,110
and it really brings
something new to the table.

132
00:07:36,110 --> 00:07:40,648
So, in the end on frame 20
and 26, I've slightly scaled

133
00:07:40,648 --> 00:07:45,648
down the X and Z and on frame
23, I've slightly scaled up.

134
00:07:46,830 --> 00:07:50,700
Then I will get rid of
all the next key frame,

135
00:07:50,700 --> 00:07:52,850
select those three key frame press Shift

136
00:07:52,850 --> 00:07:56,990
to duplicate X constraint on the X axis

137
00:07:56,990 --> 00:07:59,920
and move by six frame on the right.

138
00:07:59,920 --> 00:08:03,370
And then, I've pressed
a Shift+R several time

139
00:08:03,370 --> 00:08:05,870
to repeat the operation.

140
00:08:05,870 --> 00:08:09,360
Just press Shift+R until you have filled

141
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:13,560
your timeline until a frame 105.

142
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:15,810
These little secondary action,

143
00:08:15,810 --> 00:08:19,867
the breathing motion really
adds to the animation

144
00:08:19,867 --> 00:08:23,210
and I feel like it
betterly define the kind

145
00:08:23,210 --> 00:08:25,830
of character we are currently animating.

146
00:08:25,830 --> 00:08:30,280
Adding these fast paced
secondary action really

147
00:08:30,280 --> 00:08:33,650
makes our character feeling more alive.

148
00:08:33,650 --> 00:08:37,020
As I finished polishing
this idle animation,

149
00:08:37,020 --> 00:08:40,360
I want to isolate it from the run cycle.

150
00:08:40,360 --> 00:08:42,380
So I will insert a keyframe

151
00:08:42,380 --> 00:08:46,320
on all the channels on
the last frame, 105,

152
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:50,800
and on the first frame of
this idle, the frame 12.

153
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:54,740
Then I will select all
the keys on the frame 105,

154
00:08:54,740 --> 00:08:58,100
press the V key and switch
the handle type to free.

155
00:08:58,100 --> 00:09:00,859
I will do the same on frame 20.

156
00:09:00,859 --> 00:09:05,859
This way we can remove the
previous frame and the last frame

157
00:09:06,270 --> 00:09:10,657
without any influence on
frame 12 and frame 105.

158
00:09:11,890 --> 00:09:14,420
From there, we can duplicate our action,

159
00:09:14,420 --> 00:09:19,420
make sure it does a fake user
by clicking the shield icon.

160
00:09:19,610 --> 00:09:23,510
And then we can remove frame 0 to frame 11

161
00:09:23,510 --> 00:09:27,240
and all the key frame after frame 105.

162
00:09:27,240 --> 00:09:30,100
Then select all the keys and offset them

163
00:09:30,100 --> 00:09:33,900
so that the first key
frame starts on frame zero.

164
00:09:33,900 --> 00:09:37,900
And now we have our
cleaned up idle animation

165
00:09:37,900 --> 00:09:40,283
ready to be used later on.
