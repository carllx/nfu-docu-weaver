00:00:00,250 --> 00:00:02,500
- [Instructor] We have left last video

2
00:00:02,500 --> 00:00:06,160
with our happy bouncing
ball, bouncing and bouncing.

3
00:00:06,160 --> 00:00:09,910
But now, I'd like it
to move forward a bit.

4
00:00:09,910 --> 00:00:11,720
So let's do that together.

5
00:00:11,720 --> 00:00:14,610
The first thing I will do is to press

6
00:00:14,610 --> 00:00:17,780
three on my num pad to
switch to side view.

7
00:00:17,780 --> 00:00:22,600
Now, instead of making my
animation loop over 24 frame,

8
00:00:22,600 --> 00:00:25,750
I'd like to make the
animation a little bit longer.

9
00:00:25,750 --> 00:00:28,470
So I will re-open my timeline,

10
00:00:28,470 --> 00:00:31,850
and I'd like to repeat
the animation four time.

11
00:00:31,850 --> 00:00:35,700
So I can tie in all time 24 frames

12
00:00:35,700 --> 00:00:38,250
to get to the right frame number.

13
00:00:38,250 --> 00:00:41,270
But the problem is that
my bouncing ball animation

14
00:00:41,270 --> 00:00:44,430
is not repeating over those 96 frames.

15
00:00:44,430 --> 00:00:47,510
So the more logical
method to make it repeat

16
00:00:47,510 --> 00:00:50,420
will be to select all my keyframe,

17
00:00:50,420 --> 00:00:52,783
duplicate them by pressing Shift + D,

18
00:00:53,842 --> 00:00:56,920
X to move them on the x-axis,

19
00:00:56,920 --> 00:01:00,310
and type in 24 so that they will be moved

20
00:01:00,310 --> 00:01:03,250
by 24 frame on the x-axis.

21
00:01:03,250 --> 00:01:07,430
Then, I can press Shift +
R to repeat the operation.

22
00:01:07,430 --> 00:01:09,800
The problem with this
method is that if we have

23
00:01:09,800 --> 00:01:13,410
any modification to be
added to the animation,

24
00:01:13,410 --> 00:01:16,250
we will have to reduplicate everything

25
00:01:16,250 --> 00:01:18,550
or modify it on each bounce.

26
00:01:18,550 --> 00:01:22,720
While it's not super painful
on such a simple animation

27
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:24,700
duplicating only four time,

28
00:01:24,700 --> 00:01:27,130
this is not an efficient way to do it.

29
00:01:27,130 --> 00:01:29,240
So I will reset what I've done

30
00:01:29,240 --> 00:01:32,450
and with all my keys and curves selected,

31
00:01:32,450 --> 00:01:35,190
I will press Shift + E to open

32
00:01:35,190 --> 00:01:37,740
the keyframe extrapolation menu.

33
00:01:37,740 --> 00:01:41,370
By default our keyframe
extrapolation is set to constant.

34
00:01:41,370 --> 00:01:43,320
It means that whenever I reach

35
00:01:43,320 --> 00:01:46,530
the very last keyframe in my animation,

36
00:01:46,530 --> 00:01:48,620
the value won't be changing anymore.

37
00:01:48,620 --> 00:01:50,500
That's why we get flat curve.

38
00:01:50,500 --> 00:01:52,980
But judging by this extrapolation menu,

39
00:01:52,980 --> 00:01:54,590
we can see that we can switch it

40
00:01:54,590 --> 00:01:58,630
to linear extrapolation
or even make a cycle.

41
00:01:58,630 --> 00:02:02,550
You can also access the
extrapolation operation

42
00:02:02,550 --> 00:02:06,440
through channel panel in the
header of the graph editor.

43
00:02:06,440 --> 00:02:08,290
With all the curves selected,

44
00:02:08,290 --> 00:02:10,560
let's choose make cyclic.

45
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:12,940
Boom, our animation is now

46
00:02:12,940 --> 00:02:15,800
cycling infinitely on the timeline.

47
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:18,830
And the cool thing about
using extrapolation

48
00:02:18,830 --> 00:02:23,290
is that modifying our
animation will be repeating

49
00:02:23,290 --> 00:02:25,497
and updating the along the whole timeline.

50
00:02:25,497 --> 00:02:26,330
(graphic swooshes)

51
00:02:26,330 --> 00:02:27,630
With this problem fixed,

52
00:02:27,630 --> 00:02:30,480
I'd like my ball to move forward in space.

53
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:34,120
So I'd like to animate
the y-axis of the ball.

54
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:38,010
So I will insert a single
keyframe on the y-axis,

55
00:02:38,010 --> 00:02:42,810
go to frame 24, move the
ball by about nine meters,

56
00:02:42,810 --> 00:02:45,070
go back onto the transform channel,

57
00:02:45,070 --> 00:02:48,160
right-click and insert a single keyframe.

58
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:50,380
If I now play the animation,

59
00:02:50,380 --> 00:02:51,960
the ball will move forward

60
00:02:51,960 --> 00:02:54,560
only on the keyframe we have inserted,

61
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:57,490
and since Blender is creating by default

62
00:02:57,490 --> 00:02:59,840
a new keyframe with the bezier mode,

63
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:02,840
we have an acceleration and a deceleration

64
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:05,920
of the ball so it doesn't
look super unnatural.

65
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:08,120
While this kind of locomotion

66
00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:10,750
could be a little more complex,

67
00:03:10,750 --> 00:03:12,820
we will consider that our ball

68
00:03:12,820 --> 00:03:15,540
is moving at a constant speed.

69
00:03:15,540 --> 00:03:18,180
So I will select both handle,

70
00:03:18,180 --> 00:03:21,390
press the V key and switch them to vector.

71
00:03:21,390 --> 00:03:24,260
You could have chosen to press the T key

72
00:03:24,260 --> 00:03:26,133
and switch to linear interpolation,

73
00:03:27,110 --> 00:03:29,863
but I prefer to use vector interpolation

74
00:03:29,863 --> 00:03:32,030
to keep the handles available.

75
00:03:32,030 --> 00:03:33,450
When I watch this motion,

76
00:03:33,450 --> 00:03:36,320
I feel like the ball should
move a little further.

77
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:39,140
So I can take my last control point

78
00:03:39,140 --> 00:03:41,250
and move it a bit up more

79
00:03:41,250 --> 00:03:44,460
or insert a new value
in the transform channel

80
00:03:44,460 --> 00:03:47,173
and don't forget to insert the keyframe.

81
00:03:47,173 --> 00:03:50,760
Or we can directly change
the value of the keyframe

82
00:03:50,760 --> 00:03:54,080
by going into the F-Curve properties

83
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:57,890
and enter 10 meters in
the value of the keyframe.

84
00:03:57,890 --> 00:04:00,070
This is a good method when you want

85
00:04:00,070 --> 00:04:02,480
to enter very precise values.

86
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:07,230
Now, I'd like my ball to continue
moving on on each bounce.

87
00:04:07,230 --> 00:04:10,770
So I could duplicate the
last keyframe, offset it

88
00:04:10,770 --> 00:04:14,660
or insert a new a keyframe
and set it to 20 meter.

89
00:04:14,660 --> 00:04:19,070
But again, if we want to modify
the timing of our animation

90
00:04:19,070 --> 00:04:21,090
making the jump a bit a longer,

91
00:04:21,090 --> 00:04:23,470
I will have to modify those, too.

92
00:04:23,470 --> 00:04:25,680
And on a more complex animation,

93
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:27,370
that would be very painful.

94
00:04:27,370 --> 00:04:31,420
So let's get rid of this
and find another solution.

95
00:04:31,420 --> 00:04:33,700
If we go back to the extrapolation menu,

96
00:04:33,700 --> 00:04:36,480
we will find an option that allow us

97
00:04:36,480 --> 00:04:39,163
to create a linear extrapolation.

98
00:04:39,163 --> 00:04:43,090
Blender will take the last
two keyframe of an animation,

99
00:04:43,090 --> 00:04:45,440
and it will do an extrapolation

100
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:48,640
based on the value
differences between those two.

101
00:04:48,640 --> 00:04:52,150
So that's a great step
forward in our animation,

102
00:04:52,150 --> 00:04:54,030
but there is something that bother me.

103
00:04:54,030 --> 00:04:56,180
When our ball hit the ground,

104
00:04:56,180 --> 00:04:58,900
it stays on the ground for a few frame.

105
00:04:58,900 --> 00:05:01,860
The problem is that
it's sliding currently,

106
00:05:01,860 --> 00:05:03,790
and it doesn't look good.

107
00:05:03,790 --> 00:05:05,200
I'd like the ball to stay

108
00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:06,927
where it is when it's on the ground

109
00:05:06,927 --> 00:05:09,980
and move forward whenever it's airborne.

110
00:05:09,980 --> 00:05:13,940
To fix it, I can simply
duplicate the very first frame

111
00:05:13,940 --> 00:05:16,050
and move it on frame three,

112
00:05:16,050 --> 00:05:17,910
but I need this new motion

113
00:05:17,910 --> 00:05:20,600
to repeat along the full animation.

114
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:24,990
So I will press Shift + E and
choose constant extrapolation

115
00:05:24,990 --> 00:05:27,890
to get rid of the linear extrapolation.

116
00:05:27,890 --> 00:05:30,840
But now, my animation
is no longer repeating,

117
00:05:30,840 --> 00:05:34,920
and whenever I'm re-adding
a linear extrapolation,

118
00:05:34,920 --> 00:05:39,730
it will just continue on
moving instead of stopping

119
00:05:39,730 --> 00:05:42,150
whenever the ball is
contacting the ground.

120
00:05:42,150 --> 00:05:45,170
So I can try using a cyclic extrapolation,

121
00:05:45,170 --> 00:05:47,930
but the problem is that
the ball will get back

122
00:05:47,930 --> 00:05:51,740
to its original position after each cycle.

123
00:05:51,740 --> 00:05:54,740
So I'd like it to cycle
but with an offset.

124
00:05:54,740 --> 00:05:57,720
And what we can do is
select one of the key

125
00:05:57,720 --> 00:06:01,740
of the curve an go to
the modifier tabs here.

126
00:06:01,740 --> 00:06:05,130
And we can add a cycles modifier.

127
00:06:05,130 --> 00:06:08,180
So it works exactly as if we were

128
00:06:08,180 --> 00:06:10,580
adding the cyclic extrapolation,

129
00:06:10,580 --> 00:06:15,320
but we do now have option
on the cycle behavior.

130
00:06:15,320 --> 00:06:19,740
I can change the way it act
before and after the cycle.

131
00:06:19,740 --> 00:06:22,560
So if I go onto the after,

132
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:26,450
I can ask Blender to use
the repeat with offset.

133
00:06:26,450 --> 00:06:31,420
And what it does is that it
takes the very last keyframe

134
00:06:31,420 --> 00:06:34,590
and use it as a new starting point.

135
00:06:34,590 --> 00:06:39,040
So offsetting the animation
is currently adding it

136
00:06:39,040 --> 00:06:41,978
on top of the latest keyframe.

137
00:06:41,978 --> 00:06:43,030
(graphic swooshes)
An extra motion

138
00:06:43,030 --> 00:06:44,090
is missing, though.

139
00:06:44,090 --> 00:06:45,740
If we watch this video,

140
00:06:45,740 --> 00:06:48,860
you'll find the link in the resources PDF,

141
00:06:48,860 --> 00:06:51,880
I'd like you to focus on the body shape

142
00:06:51,880 --> 00:06:54,890
and orientation of this lynx.

143
00:06:54,890 --> 00:06:56,810
During this gorgeous motion,

144
00:06:56,810 --> 00:06:59,950
we can see the squashing and stretching,

145
00:06:59,950 --> 00:07:03,720
but we can also see some
rotation of the body.

146
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:08,720
The body in the beginning is
oriented toward the up point

147
00:07:08,750 --> 00:07:12,540
and then oriented toward
the landing point.

148
00:07:12,540 --> 00:07:15,470
So we do need to input those information

149
00:07:15,470 --> 00:07:17,400
on our bouncing ball.

150
00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:19,786
To get a better preview
of the motion of the ball,

151
00:07:19,786 --> 00:07:20,619
(graphic swooshes)

152
00:07:20,619 --> 00:07:22,430
I will calculate the motion path.

153
00:07:22,430 --> 00:07:24,420
As seen in the previous video,

154
00:07:24,420 --> 00:07:27,010
I will go into the object option,

155
00:07:27,010 --> 00:07:29,990
motion path and click calculate the path.

156
00:07:29,990 --> 00:07:33,230
I will change the path type to in range

157
00:07:33,230 --> 00:07:36,330
and change the end frame to 96.

158
00:07:36,330 --> 00:07:39,740
This will give us the
motion path of our ball,

159
00:07:39,740 --> 00:07:41,900
and it's going to be easier for us

160
00:07:41,900 --> 00:07:45,150
to figure out how much
we have to rotate it.

161
00:07:45,150 --> 00:07:48,350
The idea is to simply rotate the ball

162
00:07:48,350 --> 00:07:53,350
toward its next position
or its next frame position.

163
00:07:53,390 --> 00:07:56,180
And once we have past the highest point,

164
00:07:56,180 --> 00:08:00,113
we will make the ball pointing
toward the previous frame.

165
00:08:01,190 --> 00:08:03,303
Since our first frame is exactly the same

166
00:08:03,303 --> 00:08:04,430
(graphic swooshes)

167
00:08:04,430 --> 00:08:07,130
as the latest frame, or frame 24,

168
00:08:07,130 --> 00:08:09,510
I will jump to frame 24

169
00:08:09,510 --> 00:08:12,360
and give the correct
orientation to the ball.

170
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:15,830
It seems that 11 degrees looks fine.

171
00:08:15,830 --> 00:08:19,920
Then, I will right-click and
insert a single keyframe.

172
00:08:19,920 --> 00:08:23,160
A new channel has appeared
in the graph editor.

173
00:08:23,160 --> 00:08:25,650
It's our X ruler rotation.

174
00:08:25,650 --> 00:08:27,510
So I will now go back to the frame

175
00:08:27,510 --> 00:08:30,750
where the ball is currently
leaving the ground

176
00:08:30,750 --> 00:08:35,750
and rotate it by minus 12.5
degree toward its next position.

177
00:08:37,030 --> 00:08:39,740
So now as we have did before,

178
00:08:39,740 --> 00:08:42,380
I will duplicate the last frame,

179
00:08:42,380 --> 00:08:45,540
frame 24 of this ruler rotation,

180
00:08:45,540 --> 00:08:48,350
and move it onto frame zero,

181
00:08:48,350 --> 00:08:53,120
pressing Shift + D, X and
moving it with the mouse.

182
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:55,520
Now that the initial frame zero

183
00:08:55,520 --> 00:08:58,330
and final frame 24 are the same,

184
00:08:58,330 --> 00:08:59,830
I can select my curve

185
00:08:59,830 --> 00:09:03,690
and press Shift + E and make it cyclic,

186
00:09:03,690 --> 00:09:06,600
and it already looks pretty cool.

187
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:08,400
So while the motion I'm seeing

188
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:11,310
right now is pretty satisfying,

189
00:09:11,310 --> 00:09:14,980
you know that we need to
check it frame-by-frame.

190
00:09:14,980 --> 00:09:18,887
As any craft, a perfect
animation doesn't exist,

191
00:09:18,887 --> 00:09:21,330
and the level of quality you will reach

192
00:09:21,330 --> 00:09:25,530
depend on the time you can
spend on your animation.

193
00:09:25,530 --> 00:09:29,770
In this case, I'd like to polish
the animation a little more

194
00:09:29,770 --> 00:09:33,370
by making frame number one pretty flat,

195
00:09:33,370 --> 00:09:35,430
because I don't really like the fact

196
00:09:35,430 --> 00:09:38,190
that the ball is slightly leaning backward

197
00:09:38,190 --> 00:09:41,760
when it's getting in
its flattest position.

198
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:43,130
In the graph editor

199
00:09:43,130 --> 00:09:46,130
with the X ruler rotation curve selected,

200
00:09:46,130 --> 00:09:49,480
I will press I to insert a new keyframe

201
00:09:49,480 --> 00:09:51,970
and choose only selected.

202
00:09:51,970 --> 00:09:53,630
This way, Blender won't add

203
00:09:53,630 --> 00:09:56,700
any additional keyframes
on the other curves

204
00:09:56,700 --> 00:09:59,770
and our graph editor will remain clean.

205
00:09:59,770 --> 00:10:04,130
Then, I can grab this key,
move it on the y-axis,

206
00:10:04,130 --> 00:10:07,470
holding Shift to get a
more precise movement.

207
00:10:07,470 --> 00:10:11,540
And I will call this first
bouncing ball animation done.

208
00:10:11,540 --> 00:10:14,290
The technique we have used in this video,

209
00:10:14,290 --> 00:10:18,900
adding a rotation motion
based on the location motion,

210
00:10:18,900 --> 00:10:21,430
the up and down motion of the ball,

211
00:10:21,430 --> 00:10:24,050
is called the layered approach.

212
00:10:24,050 --> 00:10:26,370
It means that you add layers

213
00:10:26,370 --> 00:10:30,310
and layers of motion
during the polishing stage,

214
00:10:30,310 --> 00:10:32,290
not during the blocking stage.

215
00:10:32,290 --> 00:10:36,400
And we'll study this technique
more in depth later on.

216
00:10:36,400 --> 00:10:38,795
To summarize, we have seen that we

217
00:10:38,795 --> 00:10:41,090
(graphic swooshes)
can create cycles using

218
00:10:41,090 --> 00:10:45,650
the Shift + E shortcut and
choose different extrapolation.

219
00:10:45,650 --> 00:10:50,650
We can access more advanced
cycle option using modifiers.

220
00:10:51,990 --> 00:10:56,140
We can use current motion
of the ball as the guide

221
00:10:56,140 --> 00:11:00,723
to add new motion to it
in a layered approach.
