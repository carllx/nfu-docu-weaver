1
00:00:00,610 --> 00:00:03,320
- [Instructor] Let's continue
polishing the idle animation

2
00:00:03,320 --> 00:00:04,420
of our character.

3
00:00:04,420 --> 00:00:07,200
We will be focusing on the next portion

4
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:08,600
of this animation

5
00:00:08,600 --> 00:00:12,740
where our character is
switching to a sitting pose.

6
00:00:12,740 --> 00:00:15,453
Let's have a quick look
to the body motion first.

7
00:00:16,330 --> 00:00:20,120
I will make a little draw-over
using SyncSketch here.

8
00:00:20,120 --> 00:00:22,400
When transitioning on frame 28.

9
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:26,050
We can see that the body of our character

10
00:00:26,050 --> 00:00:30,330
is moving a little up
in micro-anticipation.

11
00:00:30,330 --> 00:00:33,060
This is an anticipation, very subtle,

12
00:00:33,060 --> 00:00:35,721
that occur on only one frame.

13
00:00:35,721 --> 00:00:40,450
The idea here is not to
input that much of energy

14
00:00:40,450 --> 00:00:41,650
into the movement

15
00:00:41,650 --> 00:00:44,490
but to give a little
contrast to the next move,

16
00:00:44,490 --> 00:00:46,400
and let the audience know

17
00:00:46,400 --> 00:00:49,290
that our character will be sitting.

18
00:00:49,290 --> 00:00:52,110
Thanks to the locally
style of our character,

19
00:00:52,110 --> 00:00:55,280
it's pretty easy to track its motion.

20
00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:58,170
I just want to show you
the design of the arc

21
00:00:58,170 --> 00:01:00,890
when our character is sitting.

22
00:01:00,890 --> 00:01:02,650
But also the spacing.

23
00:01:02,650 --> 00:01:05,950
Our character is
contacting with the ground

24
00:01:05,950 --> 00:01:08,050
but he will slow down.

25
00:01:08,050 --> 00:01:12,080
There will be an ease
into the sitting pose

26
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:14,520
so that he doesn't hurt his butt.

27
00:01:14,520 --> 00:01:17,290
This arc and spacing
does read on the curve.

28
00:01:17,290 --> 00:01:21,640
On frame 28, I'm creating
the little micro-anticipation

29
00:01:21,640 --> 00:01:24,900
by just pushing the curve a little up.

30
00:01:24,900 --> 00:01:27,590
Then I've created the arc motion,

31
00:01:27,590 --> 00:01:30,420
using the motion path as usual.

32
00:01:30,420 --> 00:01:32,700
And I'm creating the easing out

33
00:01:32,700 --> 00:01:35,120
with our curve flattening in the end

34
00:01:35,120 --> 00:01:37,990
of the motion on frame 36 here.

35
00:01:37,990 --> 00:01:41,060
Once I'm happy with the
main body controller,

36
00:01:41,060 --> 00:01:42,960
I always work on the chest.

37
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:45,020
So if we track the shoulder

38
00:01:45,020 --> 00:01:48,970
that is directly influenced
by the chest motion,

39
00:01:48,970 --> 00:01:51,400
I've created a dragging motion,

40
00:01:51,400 --> 00:01:55,060
mainly working on the
rotation curve of the chest.

41
00:01:55,060 --> 00:01:57,730
If you compare the
tracking of the blue line

42
00:01:57,730 --> 00:01:58,850
with the red line,

43
00:01:58,850 --> 00:02:03,010
we can see that we get a nice
C shape with the blue line,

44
00:02:03,010 --> 00:02:07,330
and a nice S shape with
the dragging chest.

45
00:02:07,330 --> 00:02:09,500
As we use the tip of the nose

46
00:02:09,500 --> 00:02:11,280
to track the head motion,

47
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:13,307
you can use the neck controller

48
00:02:13,307 --> 00:02:16,650
to track the chest motion.

49
00:02:16,650 --> 00:02:18,810
Note that I've hidden the limbs.

50
00:02:18,810 --> 00:02:22,431
It makes the readability
of the torso way better.

51
00:02:22,431 --> 00:02:23,530
(screen whooshing)

52
00:02:23,530 --> 00:02:27,110
When working on the head
before I track my arc,

53
00:02:27,110 --> 00:02:28,330
the first thing I've done

54
00:02:28,330 --> 00:02:31,580
was to remove this bump on the z rotation.

55
00:02:31,580 --> 00:02:34,503
It didn't fit the current
motion of the head,

56
00:02:34,503 --> 00:02:38,080
just adding extra noise to the movement.

57
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:39,410
And it doesn't make sense

58
00:02:39,410 --> 00:02:42,570
that our character shake
his head left to right

59
00:02:42,570 --> 00:02:45,060
when switching to the sitting pose.

60
00:02:45,060 --> 00:02:48,240
Motion wise, the head is
slightly dragging compared

61
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:49,550
to the torso,

62
00:02:49,550 --> 00:02:52,000
but I haven't input that much rotation

63
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:55,200
because I want my
character to be in control.

64
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:59,160
If you input too much up and
down rotation to the head,

65
00:02:59,160 --> 00:03:00,880
it will feel a bit weird

66
00:03:00,880 --> 00:03:03,220
as if the head was very heavy.

67
00:03:03,220 --> 00:03:06,140
So we can see that the arc of the head

68
00:03:06,140 --> 00:03:10,970
is very close to the arc
made by the torso controller.

69
00:03:10,970 --> 00:03:13,950
Here we can see the result
with the body controller,

70
00:03:13,950 --> 00:03:16,400
chest and head polished.

71
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:19,010
I did work on the ears and the nose

72
00:03:19,010 --> 00:03:20,609
as in the previous video,

73
00:03:20,609 --> 00:03:23,540
working with the straighter head method,

74
00:03:23,540 --> 00:03:27,053
meaning that I'm
animating quite on the fly

75
00:03:27,053 --> 00:03:29,370
as the animation goes,

76
00:03:29,370 --> 00:03:33,530
inputting a very, very subtle
follow-through animation

77
00:03:33,530 --> 00:03:35,000
to the ears.

78
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,760
And then I did the same
with the tip of the nose.

79
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:41,500
Since the sitting motion is pretty slow,

80
00:03:41,500 --> 00:03:44,760
pretty subtle, pretty light, whatever,

81
00:03:44,760 --> 00:03:46,681
your follow-through animation

82
00:03:46,681 --> 00:03:49,730
should be very subtle too.

83
00:03:49,730 --> 00:03:52,990
So it's just an extra motion

84
00:03:52,990 --> 00:03:56,550
that will give a bit more
life to your character.

85
00:03:56,550 --> 00:03:58,730
If you're not comfortable with this,

86
00:03:58,730 --> 00:04:02,782
it's better not to do
it than overdoing it.

87
00:04:02,782 --> 00:04:04,520
Before the head turn,

88
00:04:04,520 --> 00:04:06,950
I like to add an eye blink.

89
00:04:06,950 --> 00:04:08,810
I oftenly use eye blink

90
00:04:08,810 --> 00:04:13,090
whenever the character is
changing his head stance,

91
00:04:13,090 --> 00:04:15,710
like a big head turn in our case,

92
00:04:15,710 --> 00:04:18,290
but also if our character is surprised

93
00:04:18,290 --> 00:04:20,820
and push his head up very quickly,

94
00:04:20,820 --> 00:04:25,090
I like to use the eyes to
support this animation.

95
00:04:25,090 --> 00:04:28,180
I'm doing the same eye
motion on both eyes,

96
00:04:28,180 --> 00:04:31,680
and the idea is to have a slight ease in

97
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:33,240
and a slight ease out.

98
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:36,040
Shape wise, the eye is fully open.

99
00:04:36,040 --> 00:04:39,620
Then it's closing a bit on the next frame.

100
00:04:39,620 --> 00:04:42,900
On the third frame, it's totally closed.

101
00:04:42,900 --> 00:04:44,397
And then when reopening,

102
00:04:44,397 --> 00:04:46,990
it will open just a bit

103
00:04:46,990 --> 00:04:50,263
and then on the next
frame, it's fully opened.

104
00:04:51,377 --> 00:04:52,210
(screen whooshing)

105
00:04:52,210 --> 00:04:54,840
Next step was to animate the tail.

106
00:04:54,840 --> 00:04:57,780
In this case, the tail is not used

107
00:04:57,780 --> 00:05:01,580
to balance or in reaction to the motion

108
00:05:01,580 --> 00:05:03,360
of the character's body.

109
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:06,130
The idea was to create a wiping motion

110
00:05:06,130 --> 00:05:08,470
before our character sit.

111
00:05:08,470 --> 00:05:11,670
As if he was relaxing
his tail before sitting.

112
00:05:11,670 --> 00:05:14,750
Think a bit as if you
were going on the beach,

113
00:05:14,750 --> 00:05:18,220
on the sand, and you were
just wiping your towel

114
00:05:18,220 --> 00:05:20,590
before laying onto it.

115
00:05:20,590 --> 00:05:23,223
That's exactly what I
wanted to communicate here.

116
00:05:25,650 --> 00:05:29,550
The final stage was to
polish the hands animation

117
00:05:29,550 --> 00:05:31,550
or front legs animation.

118
00:05:31,550 --> 00:05:34,480
As always, the arcs are
the most important thing

119
00:05:34,480 --> 00:05:35,610
you have to watch for,

120
00:05:35,610 --> 00:05:39,900
so make sure that you draw
nice arcs with the motion path.

121
00:05:39,900 --> 00:05:41,310
And using the rotation,

122
00:05:41,310 --> 00:05:43,600
make the tip of the fingers

123
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:47,210
or the tip of the foot slightly
dragging in the motion.

124
00:05:47,210 --> 00:05:49,000
You can add a slight overshoot

125
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,380
when you reach the top position.

126
00:05:51,380 --> 00:05:53,070
Beyond those classics,

127
00:05:53,070 --> 00:05:55,480
there are two things
you have to watch for.

128
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:57,630
First, avoid the twinning.

129
00:05:57,630 --> 00:06:00,450
So we have broken the twinning in the pose

130
00:06:00,450 --> 00:06:01,730
during the blocking,

131
00:06:01,730 --> 00:06:05,930
making the left hand going
higher than the right hand,

132
00:06:05,930 --> 00:06:09,110
but it's better also to break the twinning

133
00:06:09,110 --> 00:06:10,440
in the timing,

134
00:06:10,440 --> 00:06:15,440
meaning that here my right
hand hit its highest point one

135
00:06:16,410 --> 00:06:19,410
or two frame prior than the left hand.

136
00:06:19,410 --> 00:06:22,930
Also, the right hand is
moving slightly faster

137
00:06:22,930 --> 00:06:24,250
than the left hand

138
00:06:24,250 --> 00:06:26,650
because the character is pushing with it.

139
00:06:26,650 --> 00:06:29,300
So there is an impulsion
on the right hand,

140
00:06:29,300 --> 00:06:32,830
while the left hand that
doesn't contact the ground.

141
00:06:32,830 --> 00:06:36,370
It's just continuing the previous motion.

142
00:06:36,370 --> 00:06:39,020
So beware of the spacing
between the right hand

143
00:06:39,020 --> 00:06:40,360
and the left hand.

144
00:06:40,360 --> 00:06:42,380
The next video will be a time lapse

145
00:06:42,380 --> 00:06:46,380
of me polishing this whole
section of the animation.

146
00:06:46,380 --> 00:06:48,090
Just double check the notes

147
00:06:48,090 --> 00:06:50,700
that I have highlighted in this video

148
00:06:50,700 --> 00:06:54,573
into the next one, and I'll
see you in the video after.
