00:00:00,810 --> 00:00:02,340
- [Instructor] Before we start creating

2
00:00:02,340 --> 00:00:04,480
our run cycle animation.

3
00:00:04,480 --> 00:00:07,370
We need to study a bit some references.

4
00:00:07,370 --> 00:00:09,890
You can easily find some breakdowns

5
00:00:09,890 --> 00:00:12,800
of run cycle animation online

6
00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:16,410
but it's always a good thing
to study some references

7
00:00:16,410 --> 00:00:17,770
to train your eyes,

8
00:00:17,770 --> 00:00:21,540
to learn what to look for
and to avoid mistakes.

9
00:00:21,540 --> 00:00:25,720
While I will make a
slightly stylized run cycle,

10
00:00:25,720 --> 00:00:27,810
the physicality and principle

11
00:00:27,810 --> 00:00:31,440
of a realistic run cycles still apply.

12
00:00:31,440 --> 00:00:35,490
Only the rhythm and the
amplitude or the exaggeration

13
00:00:35,490 --> 00:00:37,170
will make the difference.

14
00:00:37,170 --> 00:00:40,520
You will find the link to
different reference videos,

15
00:00:40,520 --> 00:00:43,880
I've picked on YouTube
in the documentation.

16
00:00:43,880 --> 00:00:46,600
I will use since sketch to currently study

17
00:00:46,600 --> 00:00:48,590
the ones I'm showing you right now.

18
00:00:48,590 --> 00:00:50,150
When working on the run cycle,

19
00:00:50,150 --> 00:00:52,570
we will mainly focus on for poses.

20
00:00:52,570 --> 00:00:56,230
So down or passing pose, the push,

21
00:00:56,230 --> 00:01:00,790
the up pose and finally,
the straight leg just before

22
00:01:00,790 --> 00:01:02,990
the contact and the end of the cycle.

23
00:01:02,990 --> 00:01:05,460
when working on the cycle analogies,

24
00:01:05,460 --> 00:01:09,690
I advise you to focus on
one feature at a time.

25
00:01:09,690 --> 00:01:11,580
The first thing I will check here

26
00:01:11,580 --> 00:01:15,940
is the shape of the spine and
the overall line of action

27
00:01:15,940 --> 00:01:18,630
between the contact
pose and the down pose,

28
00:01:18,630 --> 00:01:21,530
we can see how the whole characters spine

29
00:01:21,530 --> 00:01:26,490
and line of action from the
foot form some kind of S shape.

30
00:01:26,490 --> 00:01:27,670
So from the front view,

31
00:01:27,670 --> 00:01:31,546
if we isolate the spine from
the hips and the shoulder,

32
00:01:31,546 --> 00:01:33,700
it creates a C shape.

33
00:01:33,700 --> 00:01:35,400
And from the side view,

34
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:38,230
it does create a C shape for what too,

35
00:01:38,230 --> 00:01:41,040
during the down pose or passing pose,

36
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:43,330
the shape is almost the same,

37
00:01:43,330 --> 00:01:46,400
but it's getting slightly straighter.

38
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:50,070
I think the pushing pose is
one of the most iconic pose

39
00:01:50,070 --> 00:01:52,500
during a run because the line of action

40
00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:54,500
is super easy to read,

41
00:01:54,500 --> 00:01:58,450
creating both from the side
view and the front view,

42
00:01:58,450 --> 00:02:01,110
a nice elongated arc.

43
00:02:01,110 --> 00:02:02,740
During the up pose,

44
00:02:02,740 --> 00:02:05,290
our character's spine from the front view

45
00:02:05,290 --> 00:02:07,270
is almost straight

46
00:02:07,270 --> 00:02:09,620
and from the side view while the character

47
00:02:09,620 --> 00:02:11,730
is slightly leaning forward,

48
00:02:11,730 --> 00:02:14,970
the spine is also looking a bit straight.

49
00:02:14,970 --> 00:02:18,130
This is the time where we
will be mirroring the cycle

50
00:02:18,130 --> 00:02:22,610
in a way and shifting
the shape of the torso

51
00:02:22,610 --> 00:02:23,903
onto the other side.

52
00:02:24,770 --> 00:02:28,620
One of the most important thing
to get right when animating

53
00:02:28,620 --> 00:02:32,550
a character is the relation
between the shoulders

54
00:02:32,550 --> 00:02:33,840
and the hips.

55
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:35,900
The thing you must keep in mind,

56
00:02:35,900 --> 00:02:39,270
whenever you are posing
the torso of your character

57
00:02:39,270 --> 00:02:42,710
is counter posing or contra posto.

58
00:02:42,710 --> 00:02:46,640
The human spine is a bull of a
very little compression sense

59
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:49,470
to the discs we have between our bones.

60
00:02:49,470 --> 00:02:53,670
And when aging those
discs get a little stiffer

61
00:02:53,670 --> 00:02:54,950
and a little smaller,

62
00:02:54,950 --> 00:02:58,040
this is why when getting
old you often lose

63
00:02:58,040 --> 00:02:59,590
like one centimeter.

64
00:02:59,590 --> 00:03:00,423
In this case,

65
00:03:00,423 --> 00:03:03,100
you don't really need to
think about the relationship

66
00:03:03,100 --> 00:03:05,740
between your shoulder
position and the hips.

67
00:03:05,740 --> 00:03:08,500
But when you are leaning on a side,

68
00:03:08,500 --> 00:03:12,160
you will generally
compensate this rotation

69
00:03:12,160 --> 00:03:15,810
by pushing onto your leg
to support the weight

70
00:03:15,810 --> 00:03:17,290
that has shifted.

71
00:03:17,290 --> 00:03:19,410
As you trying to keep balance,

72
00:03:19,410 --> 00:03:22,370
your hips will be raising upon the tool

73
00:03:22,370 --> 00:03:23,880
of the lean shoulder.

74
00:03:23,880 --> 00:03:26,100
So when you're posing your character,

75
00:03:26,100 --> 00:03:30,320
always think of a V-shape
formed by the plane

76
00:03:30,320 --> 00:03:33,660
of the shoulders and
the plane of the hips.

77
00:03:33,660 --> 00:03:34,493
From the side view,

78
00:03:34,493 --> 00:03:37,170
we will have exactly the same behavior.

79
00:03:37,170 --> 00:03:39,260
If you lean forward to pick something

80
00:03:39,260 --> 00:03:41,290
on the ground for example,

81
00:03:41,290 --> 00:03:44,310
your hips will naturally
rotate the opposite way

82
00:03:44,310 --> 00:03:46,160
so that you keep balance.

83
00:03:46,160 --> 00:03:47,290
Just make a test,

84
00:03:47,290 --> 00:03:50,610
try bending forward and
rotate your hips backwards,

85
00:03:50,610 --> 00:03:53,600
you will have a very
hard time keeping balance

86
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:56,260
and you will tend to
move your whole body back

87
00:03:56,260 --> 00:03:59,540
so that your feet are
aligned with your neck.

88
00:03:59,540 --> 00:04:02,220
So the relation between your shoulders,

89
00:04:02,220 --> 00:04:07,200
your hips and your feet is
always about keeping balance.

90
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:11,060
And counter posing also
helps here during a twist.

91
00:04:11,060 --> 00:04:14,320
If you twist your upper body right,

92
00:04:14,320 --> 00:04:17,450
there are big chances that
you will slightly compensate

93
00:04:17,450 --> 00:04:18,850
with your hips.

94
00:04:18,850 --> 00:04:21,770
So if we now get back to our references,

95
00:04:21,770 --> 00:04:23,900
it will be kind of obvious.

96
00:04:23,900 --> 00:04:26,910
When the left side of
the hips of Usain Bolt

97
00:04:26,910 --> 00:04:29,090
are twisted forward

98
00:04:29,090 --> 00:04:33,110
his right shoulder is twisting
forward to compensate.

99
00:04:33,110 --> 00:04:35,250
And you can observe exactly the same thing

100
00:04:35,250 --> 00:04:36,363
on the front view.

101
00:04:37,380 --> 00:04:39,170
If we get a little further in the video,

102
00:04:39,170 --> 00:04:41,430
we can clearly see this twisting

103
00:04:41,430 --> 00:04:44,300
with the left shoulder forward while

104
00:04:44,300 --> 00:04:46,730
the hips are twisting the opposite way.

105
00:04:46,730 --> 00:04:49,220
If we have a look at some of the key poses

106
00:04:49,220 --> 00:04:50,880
of our characters,

107
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:54,010
we will easily find our V-shapes during

108
00:04:55,023 --> 00:04:55,856
the passing or down pose

109
00:04:55,856 --> 00:04:57,550
all the weight is on one foot,

110
00:04:57,550 --> 00:04:59,600
pushing the hips upward.

111
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:03,140
If you have a hard time
distinguishing the hips

112
00:05:03,140 --> 00:05:06,020
you can use the silhouette
of the character.

113
00:05:06,020 --> 00:05:09,960
So we can see the hips
raising from left to right

114
00:05:09,960 --> 00:05:13,690
and the shoulder leaning
down from left to right.

115
00:05:13,690 --> 00:05:15,700
During the up pose where both feet

116
00:05:15,700 --> 00:05:16,990
are no longer on the ground,

117
00:05:16,990 --> 00:05:20,370
we generally have almost a straight hips

118
00:05:20,370 --> 00:05:22,150
and straight shoulders.

119
00:05:22,150 --> 00:05:24,870
Some kind of parallel hips and shoulders,

120
00:05:24,870 --> 00:05:28,990
since the body is no longer
supporting any weight,

121
00:05:28,990 --> 00:05:33,400
but prepare to transition
into bending the other way.

122
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:35,910
But as we transitioned
to the contact pose,

123
00:05:35,910 --> 00:05:39,224
we can see the hips and
shoulder counter posing again

124
00:05:39,224 --> 00:05:40,858
into a V-shape.

125
00:05:40,858 --> 00:05:42,090
And from there,

126
00:05:42,090 --> 00:05:45,240
we'll be transitioning
into a new passing pose

127
00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:48,310
where the leg is pushing the hips upward

128
00:05:48,310 --> 00:05:50,623
and the shoulders are compensating.

129
00:05:52,580 --> 00:05:53,780
In the run cycle,

130
00:05:53,780 --> 00:05:56,940
one of the most important
thing is up and down

131
00:05:56,940 --> 00:05:58,780
of the center of gravity.

132
00:05:58,780 --> 00:06:03,037
But the most common mistake
I see on beginners run cycle

133
00:06:03,037 --> 00:06:05,190
are the left to right motion.

134
00:06:05,190 --> 00:06:07,880
The first very important
thing to think about

135
00:06:07,880 --> 00:06:12,180
is that the faster you run,
the less left to right motion

136
00:06:12,180 --> 00:06:13,200
you will have.

137
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:17,400
And this is why run cycles
are easier than walk cycle

138
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:20,440
is that you don't have
to think that much about

139
00:06:20,440 --> 00:06:22,870
the weight shifting from left to right,

140
00:06:22,870 --> 00:06:25,630
but there is still a bit of it.

141
00:06:25,630 --> 00:06:30,050
The side to side motion
will reach its extreme

142
00:06:30,050 --> 00:06:32,960
a bit after the contact pose.

143
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:37,070
When the athlete is
pushing on his leg to jump,

144
00:06:37,070 --> 00:06:40,950
his leg is pushing on
the opposite direction.

145
00:06:40,950 --> 00:06:43,430
So when pushing on the right leg,

146
00:06:43,430 --> 00:06:46,780
his body is translating to the left

147
00:06:46,780 --> 00:06:51,620
and it will take a couple of
frame after the contact pose

148
00:06:51,620 --> 00:06:55,860
for the body to absorb this translation

149
00:06:55,860 --> 00:06:58,380
and then go back into a pushing pose

150
00:06:58,380 --> 00:07:01,410
that will push the body the opposite way.

151
00:07:01,410 --> 00:07:03,860
And it's gonna be a bit
of the same regarding

152
00:07:03,860 --> 00:07:04,980
the up and down.

153
00:07:04,980 --> 00:07:08,450
While it's pretty easy to spot the up pose

154
00:07:08,450 --> 00:07:10,310
when the character is air bound

155
00:07:10,310 --> 00:07:13,640
the down pose doesn't occur
whenever the character

156
00:07:13,640 --> 00:07:15,680
is contacting with the
ground but a few frame after,

157
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:20,680
because again that the body
needs some time to compensate

158
00:07:22,060 --> 00:07:23,853
the weight and the momentum.

159
00:07:25,310 --> 00:07:28,800
The relationship between
the hands and the legs

160
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:30,820
is not that complicated.

161
00:07:30,820 --> 00:07:32,960
As for the hips and the shoulder,

162
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:35,240
they behave the opposite way,

163
00:07:35,240 --> 00:07:37,610
when the right leg is moving forward,

164
00:07:37,610 --> 00:07:39,850
the left hand is moving forward.

165
00:07:39,850 --> 00:07:41,910
When the right hand is back,

166
00:07:41,910 --> 00:07:43,800
the left foot is back

167
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:46,810
and we will find the same kind of behavior

168
00:07:46,810 --> 00:07:48,740
during a walk cycle.

169
00:07:48,740 --> 00:07:53,290
But there is a subtle but
very important difference.

170
00:07:53,290 --> 00:07:57,440
In the run cycle hands are
not reacting to the motion,

171
00:07:57,440 --> 00:07:59,410
but they are leading the motion.

172
00:07:59,410 --> 00:08:02,170
If we track the left hand of Usain Bolt

173
00:08:02,170 --> 00:08:06,590
we can see that it reaches
its extreme forward pose

174
00:08:06,590 --> 00:08:10,030
or upward pose before the right foot.

175
00:08:10,030 --> 00:08:14,370
And as the foot reaches
its extreme forward pose,

176
00:08:14,370 --> 00:08:19,280
the left fist has already
started swinging backward.

177
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:20,870
So during the forward motion,

178
00:08:20,870 --> 00:08:25,860
the fist arrives first and
pulls the body up and forward.

179
00:08:25,860 --> 00:08:28,690
And then it swings backward

180
00:08:28,690 --> 00:08:32,330
so that the left hand can arrive first

181
00:08:32,330 --> 00:08:34,200
compared that to the left hand.

182
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:36,830
And when we hit the passing pose,

183
00:08:36,830 --> 00:08:41,240
we can see that the left hand
is already a bit backward

184
00:08:41,240 --> 00:08:43,710
compared to the right foot.

185
00:08:43,710 --> 00:08:45,640
And this is why sprint athletes tend

186
00:08:45,640 --> 00:08:48,420
to have a very muscular upper body.

187
00:08:48,420 --> 00:08:51,390
It allows them to
generate a lot of momentum

188
00:08:51,390 --> 00:08:55,310
and energy using their arms
to pull their whole body.

189
00:08:55,310 --> 00:08:56,143
Again here,

190
00:08:56,143 --> 00:08:59,210
we can see the left fist moving forward

191
00:08:59,210 --> 00:09:02,560
while the right leg is still dragging back

192
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:04,940
and now the leg is catching up.

193
00:09:04,940 --> 00:09:08,800
So you need to remember that
to get a believable run cycle,

194
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:11,979
whether it's stylized or not.

195
00:09:11,979 --> 00:09:14,310
Arms are leading the motion,

196
00:09:14,310 --> 00:09:17,430
shoulder and hands are leading the motion.

197
00:09:17,430 --> 00:09:18,483
To wrap up this video,

198
00:09:18,483 --> 00:09:22,140
we will have a quick look
to the arc made by the legs.

199
00:09:22,140 --> 00:09:24,842
Here, I've traced the left leg motion,

200
00:09:24,842 --> 00:09:27,600
which using a sprint
athlete as a reference

201
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:29,960
can be a little misleading depending

202
00:09:29,960 --> 00:09:33,080
on what kind of front
cycle you want to do.

203
00:09:33,080 --> 00:09:35,440
If you're an average person like me,

204
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:38,090
there is very little
chance that when you run,

205
00:09:38,090 --> 00:09:40,200
you hit this kind of pose.

206
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:43,730
So never forget that when
you are studying references,

207
00:09:43,730 --> 00:09:46,000
put them in their context.

208
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,610
What are you looking at?

209
00:09:47,610 --> 00:09:50,850
So in the context of the
more classic run cycle,

210
00:09:50,850 --> 00:09:53,230
even if it is a bit athletic,

211
00:09:53,230 --> 00:09:56,840
your motion path will
mostly looks like that.

212
00:09:56,840 --> 00:09:58,870
We can also see that those athletes

213
00:09:58,870 --> 00:10:00,600
are very light on their feet,

214
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:03,900
mostly running on the tip of their feet

215
00:10:03,900 --> 00:10:05,965
while we may furtherize a rolling foot

216
00:10:05,965 --> 00:10:10,965
from the heel to the tip when
we will do our own cycle.

217
00:10:10,970 --> 00:10:15,040
It will be also important to
study the shape of the arm.

218
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:17,370
Look at when it reaches the back,

219
00:10:17,370 --> 00:10:21,510
it's mostly angled and
then it gets straight

220
00:10:21,510 --> 00:10:23,360
during the passing pose.

221
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:28,360
And then it gets very angled
when reaching its higher pose.

222
00:10:28,680 --> 00:10:31,640
We've the elbow leading the motion,

223
00:10:31,640 --> 00:10:36,600
meaning that the elbow
will reach its extreme pose

224
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:40,150
a little before the hand, maybe one frame.

225
00:10:40,150 --> 00:10:43,230
Since we will be using forward kinematics

226
00:10:43,230 --> 00:10:44,850
to animate the arms,

227
00:10:44,850 --> 00:10:48,580
we don't really need to track
the arc on the reference.

228
00:10:48,580 --> 00:10:49,940
You can do it,

229
00:10:49,940 --> 00:10:54,220
but I believe that the
pose is more important.

230
00:10:54,220 --> 00:10:57,410
A final thought is the
position of the foot

231
00:10:57,410 --> 00:10:58,850
when landing on the ground.

232
00:10:58,850 --> 00:11:01,820
You can see on the right reference that

233
00:11:01,820 --> 00:11:05,900
the foot will be slightly
shifting to the inside

234
00:11:05,900 --> 00:11:07,690
when hitting the ground.

235
00:11:07,690 --> 00:11:11,650
These are little details
that can make your run cycle

236
00:11:11,650 --> 00:11:14,520
way more believable or interesting.

237
00:11:14,520 --> 00:11:18,070
Also you should avoid
to make a straight line

238
00:11:18,070 --> 00:11:19,740
with the foot motion.

239
00:11:19,740 --> 00:11:23,290
You should make a slight
left to right arch

240
00:11:23,290 --> 00:11:25,020
during the passing pose,

241
00:11:25,020 --> 00:11:28,660
where the foot we get to
the side during the passing

242
00:11:28,660 --> 00:11:33,110
and get a little centered
during the contact frame.

243
00:11:33,110 --> 00:11:36,220
We could analyze those reference forever.

244
00:11:36,220 --> 00:11:38,300
So what we will do is that we will jump

245
00:11:38,300 --> 00:11:41,610
into the blocking of our run cycle

246
00:11:41,610 --> 00:11:42,950
and for each pose,

247
00:11:42,950 --> 00:11:46,723
we will try to think
about all those details.
