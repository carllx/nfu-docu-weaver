1
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:03,450
- In this video, we
are going to polish the

2
00:00:03,450 --> 00:00:06,110
chest controller, the neck, and the head.

3
00:00:06,110 --> 00:00:07,320
Regarding the chest,

4
00:00:07,320 --> 00:00:10,750
I will start with the
X Quaternion rotation.

5
00:00:10,750 --> 00:00:13,810
In this case, it controls the tilt forward

6
00:00:13,810 --> 00:00:15,490
and backward of the chest.

7
00:00:15,490 --> 00:00:19,486
And the method here is to
emphasize the motion we add

8
00:00:19,486 --> 00:00:22,540
in the root of the torso.

9
00:00:22,540 --> 00:00:24,780
So when the character is pushing up,

10
00:00:24,780 --> 00:00:28,070
the chest will be pushing down.

11
00:00:28,070 --> 00:00:30,470
And when the character is falling,

12
00:00:30,470 --> 00:00:32,640
the chest will rise a bit.

13
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:37,050
So it's very close to the
motion we add on the torso root,

14
00:00:37,050 --> 00:00:39,750
but we've a one frame delay.

15
00:00:39,750 --> 00:00:42,280
Contact frame is on frame two,

16
00:00:42,280 --> 00:00:44,700
and between frame four and frame six,

17
00:00:44,700 --> 00:00:48,090
we have the fastest move downward

18
00:00:48,090 --> 00:00:51,760
as the chest is reacting to
the impact on the ground.

19
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:55,243
Then the chest is raising
in a smoother fashion.

20
00:00:56,320 --> 00:00:59,120
Regarding the twisting
of the torso using the

21
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:03,670
Z Quaternion rotation seen in
the beginning of the chapter,

22
00:01:03,670 --> 00:01:08,460
during a fast run, arms and
shoulders are leading the motion

23
00:01:08,460 --> 00:01:11,160
because they are pulling the body up.

24
00:01:11,160 --> 00:01:15,430
And their motion is directly
linked to the torso twisting.

25
00:01:15,430 --> 00:01:19,730
So you can see here, I'm
highlighting the current chest

26
00:01:19,730 --> 00:01:21,536
Z Quaternion rotation,

27
00:01:21,536 --> 00:01:24,110
and in slight transparency,

28
00:01:24,110 --> 00:01:26,590
we can see the Z Quaternion rotation

29
00:01:26,590 --> 00:01:29,060
of the torso root controller.

30
00:01:29,060 --> 00:01:33,000
And we can see that the torso
root is slightly delayed

31
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:34,760
compared to the chest

32
00:01:34,760 --> 00:01:39,340
because the chest twist is
leading the torso twist.

33
00:01:39,340 --> 00:01:42,940
Then you will find our usual mechanism.

34
00:01:42,940 --> 00:01:46,750
The twist is going fast
during the passing pose

35
00:01:46,750 --> 00:01:49,760
and kind of hold during the air pose.

36
00:01:49,760 --> 00:01:51,610
With our chest polished,

37
00:01:51,610 --> 00:01:54,203
we can now jump onto the neck and head.

38
00:01:57,110 --> 00:01:59,190
The head and neck should not be something

39
00:01:59,190 --> 00:02:02,230
that complicated to
animate during a run cycle,

40
00:02:02,230 --> 00:02:03,680
but I did a mistake,

41
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:06,760
and I don't want you to
get into this pitfall.

42
00:02:06,760 --> 00:02:09,790
When you're running, your
head is pretty stable,

43
00:02:09,790 --> 00:02:12,540
meaning that it doesn't
move that much up and down,

44
00:02:12,540 --> 00:02:13,790
left to right, etc.

45
00:02:13,790 --> 00:02:16,351
So that you can focus on your target,

46
00:02:16,351 --> 00:02:18,340
where you're going.

47
00:02:18,340 --> 00:02:22,230
So your neck is currently
compensating the movement of the

48
00:02:22,230 --> 00:02:24,040
chest and torso.

49
00:02:24,040 --> 00:02:26,370
The mistake I did was trying to animate

50
00:02:26,370 --> 00:02:31,070
the neck and head with the
neck folder still enabled.

51
00:02:31,070 --> 00:02:33,797
And see that right now, my
head is moving a lot and

52
00:02:33,797 --> 00:02:38,390
our character looks more like
a chicken than a human being.

53
00:02:38,390 --> 00:02:39,840
Probably in the same case.

54
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:43,860
To fix this easily select the X key bone,

55
00:02:43,860 --> 00:02:47,620
which is the properties
bone, and hide every channel,

56
00:02:47,620 --> 00:02:49,790
but the neck follow channel.

57
00:02:49,790 --> 00:02:53,110
On there on frame zero
set the value of the

58
00:02:53,110 --> 00:02:55,640
neck follow property to zero.

59
00:02:55,640 --> 00:02:59,740
And now duplicate the key on frame 24.

60
00:02:59,740 --> 00:03:03,632
So now our property value
is zero all the way,

61
00:03:03,632 --> 00:03:06,890
and the neck is no longer
following the torso.

62
00:03:06,890 --> 00:03:10,110
It means that the neck
is no longer aligned

63
00:03:10,110 --> 00:03:13,610
with the torso either,
which looks pretty painful.

64
00:03:13,610 --> 00:03:16,930
The neck controller selected
in the graph editor,

65
00:03:16,930 --> 00:03:21,147
I've hidden all the channels,
but the X Quaternion rotation,

66
00:03:21,147 --> 00:03:24,620
which is the tilting forward and backward.

67
00:03:24,620 --> 00:03:28,530
And what I will do is that I
will offset the whole curve

68
00:03:28,530 --> 00:03:30,823
on the y-axis in the graph editor

69
00:03:30,823 --> 00:03:33,260
until the neck is aligned.

70
00:03:33,260 --> 00:03:36,220
Due to the master neck
controller behavior,

71
00:03:36,220 --> 00:03:39,530
we can see that the neck is
slightly bending forward,

72
00:03:39,530 --> 00:03:41,480
which doesn't looks pretty good,

73
00:03:41,480 --> 00:03:45,950
but we can easily fix it by
selecting the first tweaker bone

74
00:03:45,950 --> 00:03:49,470
of the neck, or forward kinematic bone,

75
00:03:49,470 --> 00:03:52,680
and reposition it in the 3D view.

76
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:54,160
Once you're done with this controller,

77
00:03:54,160 --> 00:03:57,940
you can select the second
tweaker bone of the neck,

78
00:03:57,940 --> 00:04:00,220
and rotate it the opposite way,

79
00:04:00,220 --> 00:04:03,710
so that we get a more
natural shape for the neck.

80
00:04:03,710 --> 00:04:06,970
From there, we can
select both controllers,

81
00:04:06,970 --> 00:04:09,490
get rid of all the other keys,

82
00:04:09,490 --> 00:04:11,964
but the one we've just created.

83
00:04:11,964 --> 00:04:16,220
So basically all the keys,
but keys on frame zero,

84
00:04:16,220 --> 00:04:20,010
and duplicate the keys on
frame zero to frame 24.

85
00:04:20,010 --> 00:04:22,340
With our neck shapes corrected,

86
00:04:22,340 --> 00:04:25,760
we can now get back to the neck controller

87
00:04:25,760 --> 00:04:27,710
and work on its motion.

88
00:04:27,710 --> 00:04:30,596
Since the neck rotation is now isolated

89
00:04:30,596 --> 00:04:35,158
from the rest of the chain,
the torso root, and the chest,

90
00:04:35,158 --> 00:04:39,100
the head wobbles way less than before.

91
00:04:39,100 --> 00:04:42,660
And we can now animate
the head X rotation,

92
00:04:42,660 --> 00:04:46,370
a bit as we did for the chest X rotation.

93
00:04:46,370 --> 00:04:49,720
As the character falls,
the head is dragging a bit.

94
00:04:49,720 --> 00:04:51,330
So it's raising.

95
00:04:51,330 --> 00:04:53,992
After the impact of the contact frame,

96
00:04:53,992 --> 00:04:57,866
the neck bends forward
as the head is falling.

97
00:04:57,866 --> 00:05:00,150
Do need to bring a bit of

98
00:05:00,150 --> 00:05:03,480
up and down motion to the
neck with the X rotation

99
00:05:03,480 --> 00:05:07,460
because the head has
weight, but not too much.

100
00:05:07,460 --> 00:05:10,500
Then I've used the Y
Quaternion rotation and

101
00:05:10,500 --> 00:05:15,500
Z Quaternion rotation to
stabilize the head in space.

102
00:05:15,590 --> 00:05:17,950
Since my Y curve was messy,

103
00:05:17,950 --> 00:05:20,880
I've decided to remove
all the keys between

104
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:22,710
frame zero and frame 24.

105
00:05:22,710 --> 00:05:27,436
Then I reset the value to
zero by moving the whole curve

106
00:05:27,436 --> 00:05:31,390
and switch back the
end goals to auto clap.

107
00:05:31,390 --> 00:05:34,448
Now we have a clean
curve we can work with.

108
00:05:34,448 --> 00:05:38,900
Go on to animate the head
position and stabilize a bit

109
00:05:38,900 --> 00:05:40,439
the head in space.

110
00:05:40,439 --> 00:05:44,080
When I feel that the head
is moving to the right,

111
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:45,600
I move it to the left

112
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:49,298
using the Y Quaternion
rotation curve of the neck.

113
00:05:49,298 --> 00:05:53,780
We don't want the head to
have no left to right motion,

114
00:05:53,780 --> 00:05:55,546
but we do want to reduce it

115
00:05:55,546 --> 00:06:00,490
so that the run looks more
controlled by the character.

116
00:06:00,490 --> 00:06:04,196
As usual, you can double check
the curve as a reference,

117
00:06:04,196 --> 00:06:07,540
but don't forget that if you
don't have the same timing

118
00:06:07,540 --> 00:06:11,860
in your run cycle, my curve may not fit.

119
00:06:11,860 --> 00:06:14,053
You need to understand the principles.

120
00:06:15,210 --> 00:06:17,823
Then worked on the Z Quaternion curve

121
00:06:17,823 --> 00:06:19,810
with the same goal in mind,

122
00:06:19,810 --> 00:06:22,410
kind of stabilized a bit the head.

123
00:06:22,410 --> 00:06:25,140
I didn't work the Z curve that much.

124
00:06:25,140 --> 00:06:28,000
I've kept the values very subtle.

125
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:31,875
It was just to fix a bit the
head position frame by frame.

126
00:06:31,875 --> 00:06:36,280
So I don't have that much to
add to this since it's pretty

127
00:06:36,280 --> 00:06:40,595
close to the process I was
applying to the Y rotation curve.

128
00:06:40,595 --> 00:06:42,610
Just looking at the head,

129
00:06:42,610 --> 00:06:45,983
trying to stabilize its position in space,

130
00:06:45,983 --> 00:06:49,600
but I keep a bit of side to side motion.

131
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:50,433
In the lee,

132
00:06:50,433 --> 00:06:53,000
I didn't pose the head that
much during the blocking,

133
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:56,140
so all my rotation curves are flat,

134
00:06:56,140 --> 00:07:01,140
and I will only work on the
X Quaternion rotation curve.

135
00:07:01,200 --> 00:07:03,150
As usual, we want to bring motion,

136
00:07:03,150 --> 00:07:05,238
but as explained before,

137
00:07:05,238 --> 00:07:08,810
I don't want to feel like
the head is wobbling in

138
00:07:08,810 --> 00:07:12,370
all directions and my
character can't support

139
00:07:12,370 --> 00:07:14,310
the weight of his head,

140
00:07:14,310 --> 00:07:16,560
but we want to make the drag a bit,

141
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:18,270
but not that much.

142
00:07:18,270 --> 00:07:21,494
To do so, the tip is to track whether the

143
00:07:21,494 --> 00:07:24,500
chin or the nose of your character.

144
00:07:24,500 --> 00:07:26,350
When the head is raising,

145
00:07:26,350 --> 00:07:29,520
the chin will drag a bit down,

146
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:32,520
and when the head is going down,

147
00:07:32,520 --> 00:07:34,960
the chin will slightly rise.

148
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:37,320
And we are finally done with polishing

149
00:07:37,320 --> 00:07:39,423
the whole torso of our character.
