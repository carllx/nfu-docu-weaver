1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,170
- With the layered approach,

2
00:00:02,170 --> 00:00:06,700
we focus on building the
motion channel by channel

3
00:00:06,700 --> 00:00:10,420
The idea is not to go
through a blocking stage

4
00:00:10,420 --> 00:00:14,500
then detailed blocking,
spinning, and polishing.

5
00:00:14,500 --> 00:00:16,090
We will directly work

6
00:00:16,090 --> 00:00:20,770
in the graph editor on specific
parts of the character.

7
00:00:20,770 --> 00:00:23,810
We will start from the
root of the character

8
00:00:23,810 --> 00:00:27,340
and in reaction, we will animate the legs.

9
00:00:27,340 --> 00:00:31,200
This is the whole concept
about the layered approach.

10
00:00:31,200 --> 00:00:34,970
We will first work on
the up and down motion

11
00:00:34,970 --> 00:00:38,894
of the root of the torso
and in reaction the legs

12
00:00:38,894 --> 00:00:43,140
and then the left to
right motion of the torso.

13
00:00:43,140 --> 00:00:46,500
With the file opened and
the King set selected,

14
00:00:46,500 --> 00:00:48,510
I've duplicated the action

15
00:00:48,510 --> 00:00:51,200
and then will rename it: walk.

16
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:53,100
Will activate the fix user

17
00:00:53,100 --> 00:00:55,270
to make sure we don't
lose what we are doing

18
00:00:55,270 --> 00:00:58,150
and activate the auto key framing.

19
00:00:58,150 --> 00:01:01,660
First controller will walk
with is the tussle route.

20
00:01:01,660 --> 00:01:03,240
As for this scleral character,

21
00:01:03,240 --> 00:01:06,138
it's the main controller of the torso.

22
00:01:06,138 --> 00:01:08,110
So we start with selecting
the property's bone

23
00:01:08,110 --> 00:01:11,250
and set to zero, the
follow arm properties.

24
00:01:11,250 --> 00:01:13,960
This might be something we
will change along the way,

25
00:01:13,960 --> 00:01:18,210
reset it to one or to zero,
depending on our needs.

26
00:01:18,210 --> 00:01:19,790
First motion we will work on

27
00:01:19,790 --> 00:01:23,410
is the up and down motion of the torso.

28
00:01:23,410 --> 00:01:26,840
And we will work on
the Z location channel.

29
00:01:26,840 --> 00:01:30,550
The goal is to focus on
one channel at a time.

30
00:01:30,550 --> 00:01:34,690
So selecting the visibility
bone, I will hide everything

31
00:01:34,690 --> 00:01:37,141
but the torso so that we can really focus

32
00:01:37,141 --> 00:01:39,950
on the motion of the torso.

33
00:01:39,950 --> 00:01:41,042
For this animation

34
00:01:41,042 --> 00:01:46,042
I will work with a frame
rate of 30 frame per seconds.

35
00:01:46,580 --> 00:01:49,840
You can stick to the 24
frame per second rhythm,

36
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:51,090
if you want.

37
00:01:51,090 --> 00:01:54,030
It's a matter of personal preferences.

38
00:01:54,030 --> 00:01:57,490
So normally like to work
at 30 frames per second

39
00:01:57,490 --> 00:02:00,560
because I'm used to animate for games.

40
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:02,941
And a lot of movies are now set to 25

41
00:02:02,941 --> 00:02:05,850
to 30 frame per seconds.

42
00:02:05,850 --> 00:02:09,260
But we will cycle range of 30 frame,

43
00:02:09,260 --> 00:02:12,600
in the end I've used a 36 frame

44
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:15,398
cycle for the up and down motion,

45
00:02:15,398 --> 00:02:19,810
but you can choose to
do it faster or slower.

46
00:02:19,810 --> 00:02:24,810
Here I want to create a very
slow pace and heavy walk cycle.

47
00:02:26,190 --> 00:02:30,000
But you could do a run
cycle with the same method.

48
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,684
With my roots torso selected,

49
00:02:31,684 --> 00:02:34,910
I will directly jump
into the graph editor.

50
00:02:34,910 --> 00:02:37,630
The controller is aligned with world space

51
00:02:37,630 --> 00:02:41,611
so we can work directly on the Z location.

52
00:02:41,611 --> 00:02:43,460
I have an up and down motion

53
00:02:43,460 --> 00:02:46,640
for both the left step and the right step.

54
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:49,630
So on the one whole work cycle,

55
00:02:49,630 --> 00:02:52,710
the up and down motion will repeat twice.

56
00:02:52,710 --> 00:02:54,440
I will arbitrary go to

57
00:02:54,440 --> 00:02:56,960
frame five and raise about here.

58
00:02:56,960 --> 00:02:58,820
The idea here is just to get

59
00:02:58,820 --> 00:03:01,780
an extra key frame on our torso.

60
00:03:01,780 --> 00:03:04,290
The motion will be pretty simple.

61
00:03:04,290 --> 00:03:06,789
If we want to make our character heavy,

62
00:03:06,789 --> 00:03:10,420
we need to make it raise pretty slowly

63
00:03:10,420 --> 00:03:13,200
because it has to push a lot of weight

64
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:15,511
and whenever the torso is getting down

65
00:03:15,511 --> 00:03:19,280
it will kind of fall pretty fast.

66
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:22,260
And we can build a pretty
strong overshoot to

67
00:03:22,260 --> 00:03:24,560
communicate this weight.

68
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:26,050
And as I said, tall

69
00:03:26,050 --> 00:03:29,603
I've inputted a very
slight up-and-down motion

70
00:03:29,603 --> 00:03:33,381
on the few frame to create
some kind of vibration

71
00:03:33,381 --> 00:03:38,381
or bones of the whole torso
as if the body was bouncing as

72
00:03:38,682 --> 00:03:42,310
it touched its lowest position.

73
00:03:42,310 --> 00:03:46,050
This will bring a pretty
clunky or robotic motion.

74
00:03:46,050 --> 00:03:48,970
I will keep on showing
the Z location curve

75
00:03:48,970 --> 00:03:50,370
so that you have a reference.

76
00:03:50,370 --> 00:03:52,045
As any animation process,

77
00:03:52,045 --> 00:03:53,491
it's a creative process,

78
00:03:53,491 --> 00:03:58,491
so I wasn't planning on doing
this on 36 frame at first.

79
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:02,460
To be perfectly honest,
I wasn't knowing all

80
00:04:02,460 --> 00:04:06,400
mini frame would take
an up-and-down motion.

81
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:10,063
It's just about playing the
animation, making sounds

82
00:04:10,063 --> 00:04:14,170
with my mouse to feel the
weight of the character.

83
00:04:14,170 --> 00:04:18,610
And in the end, a little
more than one second per step

84
00:04:18,610 --> 00:04:22,070
looks slow enough to
communicate the weight

85
00:04:22,070 --> 00:04:23,660
of the robot character.

86
00:04:23,660 --> 00:04:27,130
A couples of details
regarding the curve shape.

87
00:04:27,130 --> 00:04:30,230
At first, the character
is raising pretty fast

88
00:04:30,230 --> 00:04:33,510
and when it's reaching its top position

89
00:04:33,510 --> 00:04:35,730
it's slightly slowing down.

90
00:04:35,730 --> 00:04:38,600
Then we have some kind of
plateau shape on the curve.

91
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:42,530
This will make the robot
hold a bit in the up position

92
00:04:42,530 --> 00:04:45,560
for a few frames, and
it will kind of serve

93
00:04:45,560 --> 00:04:48,090
as an anticipation before the fall.

94
00:04:48,090 --> 00:04:52,200
Note that the curve is
not perfectly flat here.

95
00:04:52,200 --> 00:04:54,650
I've slightly rotated the handle,

96
00:04:54,650 --> 00:04:58,670
so that even if you took
still, it's still moving a bit.

97
00:04:58,670 --> 00:05:00,630
This is a moving hold.

98
00:05:00,630 --> 00:05:03,070
If you have a perfectly flat curve here

99
00:05:03,070 --> 00:05:04,690
it won't look natural.

100
00:05:04,690 --> 00:05:07,660
As your character will stop moving.

101
00:05:07,660 --> 00:05:11,560
Here is my up and down
motion of the torso root.

102
00:05:11,560 --> 00:05:14,863
In the next video, we
will add the foot motion.
