1
00:00:00,790 --> 00:00:03,410
- [Instructor] Now that we
understand the very basic

2
00:00:03,410 --> 00:00:05,160
of using an armature,

3
00:00:05,160 --> 00:00:08,250
let's do a new bouncing ball animation

4
00:00:08,250 --> 00:00:10,910
but with some more advanced mechanic.

5
00:00:10,910 --> 00:00:12,200
For this animation,

6
00:00:12,200 --> 00:00:15,660
we will be exclusively
working from a side view.

7
00:00:15,660 --> 00:00:19,150
It's like working on a
2D animation in a way.

8
00:00:19,150 --> 00:00:23,530
So I will create a new action
by duplicating our keying set

9
00:00:23,530 --> 00:00:25,510
and I need bouncing ball.

10
00:00:25,510 --> 00:00:29,110
It means that this action
will keep the keying set

11
00:00:29,110 --> 00:00:30,340
we have created before

12
00:00:30,340 --> 00:00:33,380
or the keyframe we have inserted before.

13
00:00:33,380 --> 00:00:37,040
And I've enabled the only
active keying set option

14
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:38,260
in the auto keying

15
00:00:38,260 --> 00:00:41,940
and enabled the filter available.

16
00:00:41,940 --> 00:00:45,790
On frame zero, I will
position my bouncing ball

17
00:00:45,790 --> 00:00:49,280
at about nine meters on the z-axis,

18
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:51,660
using the root controller.

19
00:00:51,660 --> 00:00:53,410
This controller will allow us

20
00:00:53,410 --> 00:00:55,180
to move the ball in space,

21
00:00:55,180 --> 00:00:57,200
while the other will be used

22
00:00:57,200 --> 00:01:00,358
for secondary motion
like squash and stretch

23
00:01:00,358 --> 00:01:03,520
and rotation or revolution of the ball.

24
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:05,820
We can plan our animation

25
00:01:05,820 --> 00:01:09,020
by directly drawing on the screen.

26
00:01:09,020 --> 00:01:10,530
I'm holding the D key

27
00:01:10,530 --> 00:01:13,611
while left clicking and
dragging on my screen

28
00:01:13,611 --> 00:01:16,430
to use the grease pencil notes.

29
00:01:16,430 --> 00:01:19,260
Here I've made a beautiful drawing

30
00:01:19,260 --> 00:01:21,153
of the path of the ball

31
00:01:21,153 --> 00:01:23,400
that we are going to animate.

32
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:26,440
The idea is to bring a
bit of physics into it

33
00:01:26,440 --> 00:01:28,770
so that it looks more believable

34
00:01:28,770 --> 00:01:32,930
and input a bit of damping
until the ball stop.

35
00:01:32,930 --> 00:01:36,360
You can access your
annotation in the view panel

36
00:01:36,360 --> 00:01:39,470
under Annotation and
click the minus button

37
00:01:39,470 --> 00:01:41,270
if you want to remove it.

38
00:01:41,270 --> 00:01:43,790
As soon as you make a new drawing,

39
00:01:43,790 --> 00:01:46,040
a new annotation will appear.

40
00:01:46,040 --> 00:01:47,540
You can change the color

41
00:01:47,540 --> 00:01:51,520
by clicking the little
vignette next to its name.

42
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:53,160
These annotation are in 3D,

43
00:01:53,160 --> 00:01:55,190
so you can rotate around them

44
00:01:55,190 --> 00:01:58,080
and you can create new annotation layers

45
00:01:58,080 --> 00:02:01,430
or new annotation slot by
clicking the plus button.

46
00:02:01,430 --> 00:02:03,630
If you make multiple drawing

47
00:02:03,630 --> 00:02:05,654
on multiple keyframe,

48
00:02:05,654 --> 00:02:09,190
a new drawing will be
created on each frame,

49
00:02:09,190 --> 00:02:11,970
allowing you to do awesome animation

50
00:02:11,970 --> 00:02:13,140
with the annotation

51
00:02:13,140 --> 00:02:15,410
or a crappy drawing like this one.

52
00:02:15,410 --> 00:02:16,710
All joke apart,

53
00:02:16,710 --> 00:02:18,930
it's very handy whenever you want

54
00:02:18,930 --> 00:02:21,050
to review your animation

55
00:02:21,050 --> 00:02:23,540
or plan the next move.

56
00:02:23,540 --> 00:02:26,100
Let's start animating our bouncing ball.

57
00:02:26,100 --> 00:02:28,430
I will select all the existing key,

58
00:02:28,430 --> 00:02:31,300
press T and set them to constant

59
00:02:31,300 --> 00:02:34,400
so that we can start our new animation

60
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:37,350
as we did before by the blocking stage.

61
00:02:37,350 --> 00:02:40,840
We will be animating in pose to pose

62
00:02:40,840 --> 00:02:45,250
by first setting our main
keyframe on golden keys.

63
00:02:45,250 --> 00:02:47,330
Then create some in between

64
00:02:47,330 --> 00:02:49,290
and then start polishing.

65
00:02:49,290 --> 00:02:53,800
So I'm currently trying to match
the different extreme poses

66
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:54,950
of the ball.

67
00:02:54,950 --> 00:02:58,160
The different poses when it hit the ground

68
00:02:58,160 --> 00:03:01,910
and the different poses when
it is at its highest point

69
00:03:01,910 --> 00:03:02,800
in the air.

70
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:06,570
Seeing that I don't have a
green line between the keys

71
00:03:06,570 --> 00:03:08,500
on my action editor,

72
00:03:08,500 --> 00:03:11,680
I figured there was
still busy interpolation.

73
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:13,520
So I've pressed T

74
00:03:13,520 --> 00:03:16,630
and reset to constant all the keyframe.

75
00:03:16,630 --> 00:03:18,650
As I've erased my annotation,

76
00:03:18,650 --> 00:03:22,570
I have a hard time figuring
out the position of my ball.

77
00:03:22,570 --> 00:03:25,030
But there is tools that could help me

78
00:03:25,030 --> 00:03:27,110
and that we have already used.

79
00:03:27,110 --> 00:03:29,050
It's the motion path.

80
00:03:29,050 --> 00:03:32,550
So while I'm trying to
figure out the spacing

81
00:03:32,550 --> 00:03:35,550
of the ball from one frame to the other,

82
00:03:35,550 --> 00:03:38,650
it would be easier if I add an ID

83
00:03:38,650 --> 00:03:41,190
of the previous position of the ball.

84
00:03:41,190 --> 00:03:42,770
So instead of fighting

85
00:03:42,770 --> 00:03:45,160
with my animation and my brain,

86
00:03:45,160 --> 00:03:47,640
trying to figure out or remember

87
00:03:47,640 --> 00:03:50,700
where the ball was in the previous frame,

88
00:03:50,700 --> 00:03:54,800
I will simply add up to
the armature properties,

89
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:56,990
not the object properties.

90
00:03:56,990 --> 00:04:01,340
And here I will find exactly
the same motion path menu

91
00:04:01,340 --> 00:04:03,290
that we have seen previously

92
00:04:03,290 --> 00:04:07,100
but this time, we are using
it at the armature level,

93
00:04:07,100 --> 00:04:10,830
meaning that I'm currently
tracking my root ball.

94
00:04:10,830 --> 00:04:13,390
And I can track any of
the bounce of the ball

95
00:04:13,390 --> 00:04:16,000
or even multiple bounce at once.

96
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,280
I've previously set a couple

97
00:04:18,280 --> 00:04:22,190
of quick favorite I can
access pressing the Q key.

98
00:04:22,190 --> 00:04:24,230
You can create your quick favorite

99
00:04:24,230 --> 00:04:26,510
or assign your own shortcut

100
00:04:26,510 --> 00:04:29,130
to any tool in the window

101
00:04:29,130 --> 00:04:30,710
by right clicking on it.

102
00:04:30,710 --> 00:04:34,170
From there, it's way
easier to position the ball

103
00:04:34,170 --> 00:04:36,160
from one key to the other.

104
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:39,650
I'm creating a new
keyframe every five frame.

105
00:04:39,650 --> 00:04:41,510
This is pretty arbitrary.

106
00:04:41,510 --> 00:04:44,560
You could use every 10 frame or whatever.

107
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:47,200
I'm used to use every five frame.

108
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:50,330
And when all my golden keys will be done,

109
00:04:50,330 --> 00:04:54,070
I will then go into a slight timing path

110
00:04:54,070 --> 00:04:57,350
where I will move all those
keyframe left to right

111
00:04:57,350 --> 00:05:00,470
to revise the timing of the animation.

112
00:05:00,470 --> 00:05:02,970
Here I'm writing the ultimate pose

113
00:05:02,970 --> 00:05:05,590
and then I will play my animation

114
00:05:05,590 --> 00:05:07,543
or scrub through the timeline

115
00:05:07,543 --> 00:05:09,680
to fill the motion.

116
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:11,220
See if the up and down

117
00:05:11,220 --> 00:05:15,010
and forward motion feels natural.

118
00:05:15,010 --> 00:05:17,330
And this is something
you have to train about.

119
00:05:17,330 --> 00:05:20,670
You have to train your eye about this.

120
00:05:20,670 --> 00:05:22,683
And this require experience.

121
00:05:22,683 --> 00:05:25,210
And you will get experience only

122
00:05:25,210 --> 00:05:28,530
by animating, not watching videos.

123
00:05:28,530 --> 00:05:31,720
So even if you are a
more advanced animator,

124
00:05:31,720 --> 00:05:34,423
I advise you to do this exercise.

125
00:05:34,423 --> 00:05:38,180
And if you are a
beginner, embrace failure.

126
00:05:38,180 --> 00:05:40,500
Failing is an important step

127
00:05:40,500 --> 00:05:41,990
in the learning path.

128
00:05:41,990 --> 00:05:44,510
The sooner you accept failure,

129
00:05:44,510 --> 00:05:46,420
the faster you will learn.

130
00:05:46,420 --> 00:05:48,100
And being a good artist

131
00:05:48,100 --> 00:05:50,570
is not really about your success

132
00:05:50,570 --> 00:05:53,570
but the way you bounce
back after a failure

133
00:05:53,570 --> 00:05:56,060
and the way you learn from it.

134
00:05:56,060 --> 00:05:59,690
All right, let's stop our
philosophical discussion here

135
00:05:59,690 --> 00:06:02,110
and let's go with animation.

136
00:06:02,110 --> 00:06:03,730
In my action editor,

137
00:06:03,730 --> 00:06:06,420
I'm moving all the keyframe of the ball

138
00:06:06,420 --> 00:06:07,650
on the timeline.

139
00:06:07,650 --> 00:06:09,310
The smaller the bounce,

140
00:06:09,310 --> 00:06:13,520
the fewer the frame I will
have between two keyframes.

141
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:18,200
And then I'm moving the latest
pose pretty further away

142
00:06:18,200 --> 00:06:21,730
because the ball will be
slowing down before it stops.

143
00:06:21,730 --> 00:06:24,110
So it will take some time to get there.

144
00:06:24,110 --> 00:06:26,250
To quickly manipulate the key,

145
00:06:26,250 --> 00:06:29,230
you can box select them
as we have seen before

146
00:06:29,230 --> 00:06:30,876
or click the summary

147
00:06:30,876 --> 00:06:33,410
so that you will get all
the keyframe underneath.

148
00:06:33,410 --> 00:06:36,220
You can watch my timing on the timeline

149
00:06:36,220 --> 00:06:37,360
but don't feel wrong

150
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:39,810
if your timing is not the same as mine

151
00:06:39,810 --> 00:06:43,000
because it depend on the
height of your bounce.

152
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,690
And we will certainly revise the timing

153
00:06:45,690 --> 00:06:47,240
during the animation.

154
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:50,690
But try to make it feel
as natural as possible

155
00:06:50,690 --> 00:06:52,787
as soon as possible.

156
00:06:52,787 --> 00:06:57,060
We will now start detailing
this blocking path,

157
00:06:57,060 --> 00:07:00,062
meaning that we will
add a few more keyframe

158
00:07:00,062 --> 00:07:03,150
and input a bit of squash and stretch,

159
00:07:03,150 --> 00:07:07,000
using the upper and
lower green controllers.

160
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,790
I will start by adding those stretching

161
00:07:09,790 --> 00:07:11,760
and squashing information

162
00:07:11,760 --> 00:07:14,560
on top of the existing keyframes.

163
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:16,560
As explained in the previous chapter,

164
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:18,910
when the ball is contacting the ground,

165
00:07:18,910 --> 00:07:21,380
it reaches it at full speed.

166
00:07:21,380 --> 00:07:23,670
So it is full stretched.

167
00:07:23,670 --> 00:07:26,050
And since the first pose is the one

168
00:07:26,050 --> 00:07:28,820
where our ball has the maximum speed,

169
00:07:28,820 --> 00:07:32,520
it is the pose where it
will be the most stretched.

170
00:07:32,520 --> 00:07:34,610
You can use the stretching controller

171
00:07:34,610 --> 00:07:38,520
to orient the ball toward
its previous frame.

172
00:07:38,520 --> 00:07:41,610
Just translate it a little backward.

173
00:07:41,610 --> 00:07:43,750
This controller only allow you

174
00:07:43,750 --> 00:07:47,070
to move it using its
location, not its rotation.

175
00:07:47,070 --> 00:07:49,600
The ball will automatically stretch

176
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:51,780
toward the green controllers.

177
00:07:51,780 --> 00:07:55,150
I will then scrub through the next frame

178
00:07:55,150 --> 00:07:58,020
and with my green
controller still selected,

179
00:07:58,020 --> 00:08:00,160
I will press Alt + G

180
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:02,980
to cancel any location transformed on it.

181
00:08:02,980 --> 00:08:05,540
I will take the lower squash controller

182
00:08:05,540 --> 00:08:08,690
and I will push it up just a little touch

183
00:08:08,690 --> 00:08:10,000
to make the ball squash

184
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,250
when it slow down in the air.

185
00:08:12,250 --> 00:08:14,480
I can see that I have
a little interpolation

186
00:08:14,480 --> 00:08:15,660
between my keyframe,

187
00:08:15,660 --> 00:08:17,530
so I will select them all, press T

188
00:08:17,530 --> 00:08:19,640
and reset them to constant.

189
00:08:19,640 --> 00:08:21,470
This happen sometime when you try

190
00:08:21,470 --> 00:08:23,600
to add the constant interpolation

191
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:25,330
on a single keyframe.

192
00:08:25,330 --> 00:08:26,930
So I will go ahead

193
00:08:26,930 --> 00:08:28,820
and input a bit of stretching

194
00:08:28,820 --> 00:08:31,880
and orientation to the ball on each frame

195
00:08:31,880 --> 00:08:33,500
and as I go along,

196
00:08:33,500 --> 00:08:36,040
I will reduce the stretching strength

197
00:08:36,040 --> 00:08:38,400
on each consecutive bounce

198
00:08:38,400 --> 00:08:40,790
because the ball is losing energy.

199
00:08:40,790 --> 00:08:45,100
Each time, I slightly translate
the upper green controller

200
00:08:45,100 --> 00:08:47,090
toward the previous frame

201
00:08:47,090 --> 00:08:48,810
and when it's up in the air,

202
00:08:48,810 --> 00:08:52,060
I'm slightly moving the
lower controller up.

203
00:08:52,060 --> 00:08:54,790
I have forgotten to insert a keyframe

204
00:08:54,790 --> 00:08:56,560
on each channels.

205
00:08:56,560 --> 00:08:59,080
So in the action editor,

206
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:00,680
I will go on each keyframe,

207
00:09:00,680 --> 00:09:03,815
press I and choose all channels.

208
00:09:03,815 --> 00:09:06,650
I can now add some breakdowns

209
00:09:06,650 --> 00:09:09,243
or in between to my animation.

210
00:09:09,243 --> 00:09:12,780
This will really help
me reading the animation

211
00:09:12,780 --> 00:09:14,400
in the blocking stage.

212
00:09:14,400 --> 00:09:16,640
So what we are going to do now

213
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:21,380
is add the squash just
after landing of the ball.

214
00:09:21,380 --> 00:09:24,070
Be very cautious with
the squash and stretch

215
00:09:24,070 --> 00:09:27,510
because it translate the
softness of the ball.

216
00:09:27,510 --> 00:09:28,960
If you're going to extreme,

217
00:09:28,960 --> 00:09:32,000
your ball will look like a water balloon.

218
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,600
As impact occur on frame eight,

219
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:38,190
on frame nine, I will
slightly squash the ball.

220
00:09:38,190 --> 00:09:42,580
Then on frame 10, before the
ball is leaving the ground,

221
00:09:42,580 --> 00:09:46,950
I will stretch it a bit
toward the next position.

222
00:09:46,950 --> 00:09:50,270
To do so, again select
the upper controller

223
00:09:50,270 --> 00:09:54,420
and press G to move it
towards the frame 13.

224
00:09:54,420 --> 00:09:57,310
See how after the bounce I'm stretching

225
00:09:57,310 --> 00:09:59,570
the ball less than before?

226
00:09:59,570 --> 00:10:01,810
Because as it touch the ground,

227
00:10:01,810 --> 00:10:02,990
it's losing energy,

228
00:10:02,990 --> 00:10:05,130
so I can't make it stretch

229
00:10:05,130 --> 00:10:08,330
as much as when it was
going to touch the ground.

230
00:10:08,330 --> 00:10:11,140
Again, I did a little
mistake along the way.

231
00:10:11,140 --> 00:10:12,960
If you check frame 18,

232
00:10:12,960 --> 00:10:14,950
we can see that our bouncing ball

233
00:10:14,950 --> 00:10:16,900
is not touching the ground

234
00:10:16,900 --> 00:10:19,400
and I'm offsetting its root controller

235
00:10:19,400 --> 00:10:20,730
to fix the problem

236
00:10:20,730 --> 00:10:25,110
but the issue doesn't come from
the root controller position

237
00:10:25,110 --> 00:10:28,560
but from the second squash
and stretch controller.

238
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:29,880
The lower one.

239
00:10:29,880 --> 00:10:31,840
When I inserted the keyframe

240
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:34,700
on all the controller previously,

241
00:10:34,700 --> 00:10:38,072
I've forgotten to reset its position

242
00:10:38,072 --> 00:10:40,880
when the ball was touching the ground.

243
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:43,045
So currently, this controller

244
00:10:43,045 --> 00:10:46,280
is still in its squash position

245
00:10:46,280 --> 00:10:51,100
as when the ball is in the air
position on frame 22 and 13.

246
00:10:51,100 --> 00:10:54,340
And this is why the blocking
stage is so important

247
00:10:54,340 --> 00:10:57,603
because if I was already
splining my animation,

248
00:10:57,603 --> 00:11:00,840
I would have a hard time to stop this

249
00:11:00,840 --> 00:11:04,300
and I will be fighting this
deformation with my curves.

250
00:11:04,300 --> 00:11:07,040
So with the lower green
controller selected,

251
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:09,180
I will go over all the keyframe

252
00:11:09,180 --> 00:11:10,710
and press Alt + G

253
00:11:10,710 --> 00:11:12,754
and you can see the ball getting back

254
00:11:12,754 --> 00:11:15,250
into its original shape.

255
00:11:15,250 --> 00:11:17,960
And now I can fix the root position

256
00:11:17,960 --> 00:11:19,270
on each of those frames.

257
00:11:19,270 --> 00:11:22,260
Now, to make my action
editor a bit cleaner

258
00:11:22,260 --> 00:11:25,610
and more readable, I will
collapse all the panel

259
00:11:25,610 --> 00:11:28,150
because I don't need
to see all the channels

260
00:11:28,150 --> 00:11:30,766
and starting with the
root bounce controller,

261
00:11:30,766 --> 00:11:33,640
I will duplicate the frame 18

262
00:11:33,640 --> 00:11:35,280
and move it on frame 20

263
00:11:35,280 --> 00:11:37,890
and get rid of frame 19.

264
00:11:37,890 --> 00:11:40,620
Since the ball position doesn't change

265
00:11:40,620 --> 00:11:42,210
between those two frames,

266
00:11:42,210 --> 00:11:45,210
I don't need to have
a keyframe in between.

267
00:11:45,210 --> 00:11:48,584
And duplicating frame 18 on frame 20

268
00:11:48,584 --> 00:11:51,400
will ensure I have consistency

269
00:11:51,400 --> 00:11:55,440
into my animation or at
least onto the position

270
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:58,050
of my ball when it's on the ground.

271
00:11:58,050 --> 00:12:02,120
I will also duplicate frame 26 on frame 27

272
00:12:02,120 --> 00:12:04,300
because the ball is still on the ground

273
00:12:04,300 --> 00:12:05,490
on this frame.

274
00:12:05,490 --> 00:12:07,730
Then I'm checking each frame

275
00:12:07,730 --> 00:12:11,080
and I see that I need to
revise a bit the squashing

276
00:12:11,080 --> 00:12:12,780
with the lower controller

277
00:12:12,780 --> 00:12:16,030
because it's still very
strong on frame 29.

278
00:12:16,030 --> 00:12:18,540
So I press Alt + G to cancel it

279
00:12:18,540 --> 00:12:21,400
and then press G and Alt + Shift

280
00:12:21,400 --> 00:12:24,940
to move it on the z-axis very subtly.

281
00:12:24,940 --> 00:12:28,550
From there, I will play
my animation several time

282
00:12:28,550 --> 00:12:30,410
to fill the timing.

283
00:12:30,410 --> 00:12:33,020
So I can see that on the first bounce,

284
00:12:33,020 --> 00:12:34,970
there is something a bit off.

285
00:12:34,970 --> 00:12:38,610
Having the first upper
position on frame 13

286
00:12:38,610 --> 00:12:40,780
is a bit too soon

287
00:12:40,780 --> 00:12:43,250
and we configure this in the timeline,

288
00:12:43,250 --> 00:12:45,770
the upper pose is on frame 13

289
00:12:45,770 --> 00:12:48,700
and the contact pose on frame 18.

290
00:12:48,700 --> 00:12:53,010
So I only have three
frame to get up in the air

291
00:12:53,010 --> 00:12:54,760
and five to fall down.

292
00:12:54,760 --> 00:12:57,900
So I will offset all the
keyframe from frame 13

293
00:12:57,900 --> 00:12:59,270
by one frame

294
00:12:59,270 --> 00:13:04,130
and then I will move all the
keyframe from frame 18 or 19

295
00:13:04,130 --> 00:13:05,830
by one frame back

296
00:13:05,830 --> 00:13:08,240
so that I get an even spacing

297
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:11,160
between the upper pose and the lower pose.

298
00:13:11,160 --> 00:13:15,060
The first bounce uses
eight frame to complete.

299
00:13:15,060 --> 00:13:17,490
So I guess we can use six frame

300
00:13:17,490 --> 00:13:19,610
to complete the second bounce.

301
00:13:19,610 --> 00:13:22,160
So frame 20 will be the contact post.

302
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:23,980
23, the upper pose,

303
00:13:23,980 --> 00:13:25,656
26, the next contact.

304
00:13:25,656 --> 00:13:30,470
And the final bounce
could use one frame less.

305
00:13:30,470 --> 00:13:33,740
So our bouncing ball
timing is quite logical.

306
00:13:33,740 --> 00:13:35,650
I start with an eight-frame bounce,

307
00:13:35,650 --> 00:13:37,350
then a six-frame bounce

308
00:13:37,350 --> 00:13:40,540
and finally, a four-frame bounce.

309
00:13:40,540 --> 00:13:43,610
It's totally fine if
your timing is different.

310
00:13:43,610 --> 00:13:48,610
The important thing is to
get this logical pattern

311
00:13:48,820 --> 00:13:51,640
between the first bounce
and the last bounce

312
00:13:51,640 --> 00:13:53,790
with a decreasing number of frame

313
00:13:53,790 --> 00:13:55,470
between each bounce.

314
00:13:55,470 --> 00:13:57,850
This logical approach of motion

315
00:13:57,850 --> 00:14:02,340
will help us solve some
animation problem later on.

316
00:14:02,340 --> 00:14:04,030
It's not a rule of thumb though

317
00:14:04,030 --> 00:14:08,190
because animation is also
a matter of randomness.

318
00:14:08,190 --> 00:14:13,070
Our ball could be bouncing on
an uneven ground, for example,

319
00:14:13,070 --> 00:14:16,700
so it will make the timing
a bit off at some point.

320
00:14:16,700 --> 00:14:18,250
But in your learning path,

321
00:14:18,250 --> 00:14:21,920
it's important to understand
the logic of motion.

322
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:23,460
In this specific case,

323
00:14:23,460 --> 00:14:26,020
the fact that the ball is losing energy

324
00:14:26,020 --> 00:14:28,280
on each bounce so the timing

325
00:14:28,280 --> 00:14:31,430
between each contact pose will be shorter,

326
00:14:31,430 --> 00:14:34,140
in the next video, we
will polish the animation

327
00:14:34,140 --> 00:14:35,570
using the graph editor.

328
00:14:35,570 --> 00:14:37,260
To summarize, we have seen

329
00:14:37,260 --> 00:14:40,620
that we can use the
grease pencil annotation

330
00:14:40,620 --> 00:14:42,880
to plan our animation.

331
00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:46,610
Using the motion path display is important

332
00:14:46,610 --> 00:14:48,840
even at the blocking stage

333
00:14:48,840 --> 00:14:52,760
as it really help us figuring
out the motion of the ball.

334
00:14:52,760 --> 00:14:56,470
We have to be careful when
using squash and stretch

335
00:14:56,470 --> 00:14:59,500
because it does communicate the softness

336
00:14:59,500 --> 00:15:02,010
or the material of our ball.

337
00:15:02,010 --> 00:15:05,900
So ask yourself what kind
of ball am I animating?

338
00:15:05,900 --> 00:15:08,670
We can tackle our animation timing

339
00:15:08,670 --> 00:15:10,800
with a logical approach.

340
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:13,080
Our bouncing ball will lose energy

341
00:15:13,080 --> 00:15:17,363
on each bounce so there will
be smaller and smaller until.
