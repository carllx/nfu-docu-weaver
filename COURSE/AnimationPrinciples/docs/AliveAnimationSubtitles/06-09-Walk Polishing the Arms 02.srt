00:00:00,870 --> 00:00:02,010
- [Instructor] This video, we are going

2
00:00:02,010 --> 00:00:06,410
to finish our walk cycle
animation, polishing the arms.

3
00:00:06,410 --> 00:00:09,480
If you want to track your arcs on the arm,

4
00:00:09,480 --> 00:00:12,470
I suggest you track the tweaker controller

5
00:00:12,470 --> 00:00:13,530
of the elbow.

6
00:00:13,530 --> 00:00:16,440
Then we can select our arm controller

7
00:00:16,440 --> 00:00:19,143
and we can isolate the rotation channels.

8
00:00:19,143 --> 00:00:22,020
For the whole chain down to the fingers,

9
00:00:22,020 --> 00:00:25,590
we will only be playing
with rotation channels

10
00:00:25,590 --> 00:00:26,860
from now on.

11
00:00:26,860 --> 00:00:30,650
The most influential channel
for the rotation of the arm

12
00:00:30,650 --> 00:00:34,690
in our swinging motion is
the z quaternion rotation.

13
00:00:34,690 --> 00:00:36,300
Again, polishing this curve

14
00:00:36,300 --> 00:00:38,370
is gonna be pretty straightforward.

15
00:00:38,370 --> 00:00:40,330
It is mostly about cleaning the curve

16
00:00:40,330 --> 00:00:42,850
than really reworking the animation

17
00:00:42,850 --> 00:00:44,770
or the motion of the arm.

18
00:00:44,770 --> 00:00:46,700
From view, I will press Alt + B

19
00:00:46,700 --> 00:00:49,252
and frame half of my character

20
00:00:49,252 --> 00:00:52,660
so that I won't be
distracted by the right arm

21
00:00:52,660 --> 00:00:55,963
in the back when walking
from the side view.

22
00:00:55,963 --> 00:00:57,280
The idea is to make sure

23
00:00:57,280 --> 00:00:59,440
that we hold a bit the arm forward

24
00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:02,640
and backward when it reaches its extreme.

25
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:05,110
While the arms were leading the animation

26
00:01:05,110 --> 00:01:07,090
during the run cycle,

27
00:01:07,090 --> 00:01:09,460
in the case of a walk cycle,

28
00:01:09,460 --> 00:01:12,620
especially this relaxed walk cycle,

29
00:01:12,620 --> 00:01:15,890
the arm are swinging in
reaction to the fall.

30
00:01:15,890 --> 00:01:18,750
So they will be delayed
compared to the motion

31
00:01:18,750 --> 00:01:20,040
of the foot.

32
00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:24,250
Just make sure that your
arms hit their extreme a bit

33
00:01:24,250 --> 00:01:26,151
after the contact post.

34
00:01:26,151 --> 00:01:29,880
In our case, we have our
contact pose on frame zero

35
00:01:29,880 --> 00:01:32,233
and the extreme is on frame two.

36
00:01:33,150 --> 00:01:36,840
Once you get a decent result
using the z-quaternion curve,

37
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:39,720
you should switch to
the y-quaternion curve.

38
00:01:39,720 --> 00:01:42,710
My case, it add almost the same behavior

39
00:01:42,710 --> 00:01:45,110
as the z-quaternion curve

40
00:01:45,110 --> 00:01:49,250
and its motion was added
upon the z-quaternion curve.

41
00:01:49,250 --> 00:01:51,350
Polishing this curve allows us

42
00:01:51,350 --> 00:01:53,086
to refine the swing motion,

43
00:01:53,086 --> 00:01:57,450
especially on the easing
toward both extreme.

44
00:01:57,450 --> 00:02:00,230
That animation is not a linear workflow.

45
00:02:00,230 --> 00:02:03,750
Based on your blocking, you
may not have the same result

46
00:02:03,750 --> 00:02:05,840
as what I have on screen.

47
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:07,830
This is why it can be hard sometime

48
00:02:07,830 --> 00:02:09,540
to follow an animation course

49
00:02:09,540 --> 00:02:13,930
where you may not have exactly
the same behavior curve wise.

50
00:02:13,930 --> 00:02:16,970
So your goal is not to focus on the curve

51
00:02:16,970 --> 00:02:19,360
but on the motion itself.

52
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:22,550
In my case, when I reached the extreme,

53
00:02:22,550 --> 00:02:26,150
especially when the arm was swinging back,

54
00:02:26,150 --> 00:02:28,910
it feels like it was hitting a wall.

55
00:02:28,910 --> 00:02:31,430
It was reaching its extreme back

56
00:02:31,430 --> 00:02:34,070
and then kind of bouncing forward.

57
00:02:34,070 --> 00:02:37,410
Polishing the y-curve did fix the problem.

58
00:02:37,410 --> 00:02:40,610
This rotation curve allows
us to move the elbow away

59
00:02:40,610 --> 00:02:42,800
from the chest of our character.

60
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:46,930
So basically, when the elbow
is passing by the chest,

61
00:02:46,930 --> 00:02:49,140
you would move it away

62
00:02:49,140 --> 00:02:51,810
and when it's in the back of the chest

63
00:02:51,810 --> 00:02:54,440
or forward in both extreme,

64
00:02:54,440 --> 00:02:56,473
we will move it a bit inward.

65
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:00,660
With the arm polished,

66
00:03:00,660 --> 00:03:03,090
we can jump onto the forearm.

67
00:03:03,090 --> 00:03:04,550
As advised before,

68
00:03:04,550 --> 00:03:07,520
if you want to track
your arcs on the forearm,

69
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:12,420
I advise you to track the
arcs of the wrist controller.

70
00:03:12,420 --> 00:03:14,420
The cool thing about the forearm

71
00:03:14,420 --> 00:03:16,460
is that generally speaking,

72
00:03:16,460 --> 00:03:18,760
it can only rotate around one axis.

73
00:03:18,760 --> 00:03:22,360
So we will only have to polish one curve,

74
00:03:22,360 --> 00:03:24,270
the z rotation curve.

75
00:03:24,270 --> 00:03:28,120
That might not be the case
for a very stylized animation

76
00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:31,150
where you want to break the
limbs or stuff like that

77
00:03:31,150 --> 00:03:33,760
to create stylized motion.

78
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:35,070
Basically, we want the hand

79
00:03:35,070 --> 00:03:36,870
to drag compared to the elbow.

80
00:03:36,870 --> 00:03:39,710
So as the arm is swinging forward,

81
00:03:39,710 --> 00:03:44,120
I will bend the forearm a big backward.

82
00:03:44,120 --> 00:03:48,350
We will reach the extreme
as the arm is almost passing

83
00:03:48,350 --> 00:03:50,550
on frame number eight.

84
00:03:50,550 --> 00:03:53,910
As the elbow hits its forward position,

85
00:03:53,910 --> 00:03:55,500
the hand will catch up

86
00:03:55,500 --> 00:03:57,740
and the elbow will bend the other way.

87
00:03:57,740 --> 00:04:02,530
The forearm will reach the
other extreme on frame 21

88
00:04:02,530 --> 00:04:05,653
as the arm starts to swing backward.

89
00:04:06,550 --> 00:04:08,640
It's pretty easy to polish this curve

90
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:11,820
and you should have something
quite similar to mine.

91
00:04:11,820 --> 00:04:13,450
It might be offset in time,

92
00:04:13,450 --> 00:04:16,490
depending on the timing of your walk cycle

93
00:04:16,490 --> 00:04:19,940
and also depending on
the amount of rotation

94
00:04:19,940 --> 00:04:21,270
you are inputting,

95
00:04:21,270 --> 00:04:24,550
the amount of dragging
you're inputting to.

96
00:04:24,550 --> 00:04:26,380
The more the hand is dragging,

97
00:04:26,380 --> 00:04:29,217
the more the forearm will look loose

98
00:04:29,217 --> 00:04:34,217
and the more your walk
cycle will feel relaxed.

99
00:04:34,350 --> 00:04:37,660
From there, we can jump
into polishing the hand.

100
00:04:37,660 --> 00:04:39,690
It's gonna be exactly the same process

101
00:04:39,690 --> 00:04:42,640
but this time on multiple axis.

102
00:04:42,640 --> 00:04:45,890
Polishing the hand rotation
won't be a difficult task.

103
00:04:45,890 --> 00:04:48,240
I'm first trying to figure out

104
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:50,350
which channel does what

105
00:04:50,350 --> 00:04:54,000
and I will start by
polishing the z channel.

106
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:57,160
Orientate the hand forward or backward.

107
00:04:57,160 --> 00:04:58,500
So from our side view,

108
00:04:58,500 --> 00:05:02,320
this is the first most
influential channel.

109
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:04,960
The goal is to make the hand rotate

110
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:07,970
with a bit of delay
compared to the forearm.

111
00:05:07,970 --> 00:05:10,880
One major mistake you should avoid

112
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:14,280
is to bend the hand too much backward.

113
00:05:14,280 --> 00:05:18,080
Try it yourself and rotate
your own hand along this axis.

114
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:19,650
You will see that when it comes

115
00:05:19,650 --> 00:05:21,890
to rotating the hand backward,

116
00:05:21,890 --> 00:05:24,170
you are pretty limited in the range

117
00:05:24,170 --> 00:05:26,160
of rotation you can reach.

118
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:28,817
And it's even worth the other way.

119
00:05:28,817 --> 00:05:32,843
So don't overdo this backward
and forward rotation.

120
00:05:34,360 --> 00:05:36,660
Regarding the x-quaternion rotation,

121
00:05:36,660 --> 00:05:38,930
the inward and outward rotation

122
00:05:38,930 --> 00:05:41,080
or orientation of the hand,

123
00:05:41,080 --> 00:05:43,890
the motion range is not really a problem.

124
00:05:43,890 --> 00:05:47,800
From the front view, whenever
the arm is swinging outward,

125
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:50,380
I make sure to make the hand drag a bit

126
00:05:50,380 --> 00:05:52,810
by rotating it inward

127
00:05:52,810 --> 00:05:55,850
and as the arm swing inward,

128
00:05:55,850 --> 00:05:58,810
I make sure to rotate
the hand a bit backward

129
00:05:58,810 --> 00:06:00,133
toward the outside.

130
00:06:01,070 --> 00:06:04,070
Note that I have a bit
of clipping on my model.

131
00:06:04,070 --> 00:06:05,580
During the passing pose,

132
00:06:05,580 --> 00:06:08,940
the sum is crossing the
psi and cut the mesh.

133
00:06:08,940 --> 00:06:12,250
So I will have to slightly open the arms

134
00:06:12,250 --> 00:06:15,853
during the passing pose
by pushing the x curve.

135
00:06:16,827 --> 00:06:18,780
So while the motion may feel good,

136
00:06:18,780 --> 00:06:21,620
I need to fix a bit this kind of problem.

137
00:06:21,620 --> 00:06:25,720
So I will increase the
x rotation amplitude

138
00:06:25,720 --> 00:06:28,910
of the arms so that it
move a bit more away

139
00:06:28,910 --> 00:06:33,610
from the thigh and I will also
slightly offset my x curve

140
00:06:33,610 --> 00:06:37,180
for the hand so that I
also move the hand away

141
00:06:37,180 --> 00:06:38,340
from the side.

142
00:06:38,340 --> 00:06:41,540
Don't forget to check your
animation from every angle.

143
00:06:41,540 --> 00:06:43,230
So animate from the side view,

144
00:06:43,230 --> 00:06:45,150
front view and back view

145
00:06:45,150 --> 00:06:48,030
and often turn around your character.

146
00:06:48,030 --> 00:06:52,082
You should also check your
animation in perspective mode.

147
00:06:52,082 --> 00:06:55,880
Not only in autographic mode.

148
00:06:55,880 --> 00:06:59,600
After that, I worked a bit
on the y-rotation curve,

149
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:02,370
which makes the hand twist.

150
00:07:02,370 --> 00:07:06,450
There is not much twisting
in this walk animation

151
00:07:06,450 --> 00:07:08,630
but still, it's important to polish it

152
00:07:08,630 --> 00:07:11,790
so that we have a smooth movement.

153
00:07:11,790 --> 00:07:16,460
I've also worked on the
W-quaternion rotation curve.

154
00:07:16,460 --> 00:07:20,400
The idea is not that it will
influence that much the pose

155
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:23,820
of our character or the motion of the hand

156
00:07:23,820 --> 00:07:25,270
but I just want to make sure

157
00:07:25,270 --> 00:07:27,220
that it flows perfectly

158
00:07:27,220 --> 00:07:30,790
and that it blends from
one cycle to the other.

159
00:07:30,790 --> 00:07:33,590
So the idea is mostly to clean the curve

160
00:07:33,590 --> 00:07:37,383
than to improve the current
motion or modify it.

161
00:07:38,710 --> 00:07:42,160
I often don't work on the
w-quaternion rotation,

162
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:45,160
especially for such subtle motion

163
00:07:45,160 --> 00:07:47,060
but especially on cycles,

164
00:07:47,060 --> 00:07:50,480
it can sometime input some glitches

165
00:07:50,480 --> 00:07:52,240
if you don't have a good flow

166
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:55,240
between your very first
and very last keys.

167
00:07:55,240 --> 00:07:58,098
As soon as I add the
satisfying hand motion,

168
00:07:58,098 --> 00:08:02,770
so basically our whole
arm moving in space,

169
00:08:02,770 --> 00:08:05,640
I decided to mirror the motion

170
00:08:05,640 --> 00:08:08,950
onto the other arm to
have a better overview

171
00:08:08,950 --> 00:08:11,080
of our current walk cycle.

172
00:08:11,080 --> 00:08:14,150
I won't show you again how to copy

173
00:08:14,150 --> 00:08:16,650
and paste mirrored a curve

174
00:08:16,650 --> 00:08:19,510
or several curves onto the other side

175
00:08:19,510 --> 00:08:20,900
of your character

176
00:08:20,900 --> 00:08:24,230
since we've been doing
this several time already.

177
00:08:24,230 --> 00:08:25,760
And both the arms in action

178
00:08:25,760 --> 00:08:28,580
makes the walk cycle looks really cool.

179
00:08:28,580 --> 00:08:31,000
The final touch will be to work a bit

180
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:34,760
on the palm deformation and the fingers.

181
00:08:34,760 --> 00:08:36,800
We can input a bit more details

182
00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:41,010
into our motion by
slightly animating the palm

183
00:08:41,010 --> 00:08:42,470
and the fingers.

184
00:08:42,470 --> 00:08:43,610
Regarding the palm,

185
00:08:43,610 --> 00:08:47,110
I will only be playing
with the z rotation,

186
00:08:47,110 --> 00:08:49,440
compressing a bit the bones

187
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:52,380
and simply inputting a bit of delay

188
00:08:52,380 --> 00:08:55,980
in the rotation of this
pastor palm controller.

189
00:08:55,980 --> 00:08:59,530
So I'm only using the z Euler rotation.

190
00:08:59,530 --> 00:09:02,100
Whenever the hand is swinging forward,

191
00:09:02,100 --> 00:09:04,550
I will slightly open the palm.

192
00:09:04,550 --> 00:09:07,910
Whenever the hand is swinging backward,

193
00:09:07,910 --> 00:09:10,350
I will slightly close the palm.

194
00:09:10,350 --> 00:09:13,830
Then I will just make sure
that my curve cycle properly

195
00:09:13,830 --> 00:09:14,833
and I'm done.

196
00:09:15,705 --> 00:09:17,990
To add on with the palm
bone can be interesting

197
00:09:17,990 --> 00:09:20,870
to add a bit of rotation in the fingers

198
00:09:20,870 --> 00:09:22,173
and in the thumb.

199
00:09:23,280 --> 00:09:26,100
Again, it's just about making the thumb

200
00:09:26,100 --> 00:09:28,330
and the fingers drag a bit.

201
00:09:28,330 --> 00:09:31,350
So whenever the hand is moving forward,

202
00:09:31,350 --> 00:09:36,130
I make the fingers rotate
backward and vice versa.

203
00:09:36,130 --> 00:09:37,660
The only thing you have to check

204
00:09:37,660 --> 00:09:42,507
and figure out is on which
axis your fingers can rotate.

205
00:09:42,507 --> 00:09:44,000
And the best way to do it

206
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,630
is just to check your own hand.

207
00:09:46,630 --> 00:09:49,540
Your thumb can rotate along every axis

208
00:09:49,540 --> 00:09:53,250
but the y-axis, you can't
really twist your thumb.

209
00:09:53,250 --> 00:09:55,640
You can easily curl your finger

210
00:09:55,640 --> 00:09:57,430
but when it comes to twisting,

211
00:09:57,430 --> 00:09:59,490
it's almost impossible

212
00:09:59,490 --> 00:10:04,250
and they have a very small
range of side-to-side motion,

213
00:10:04,250 --> 00:10:07,380
so you can input a bit
of side-to-side motion

214
00:10:07,380 --> 00:10:10,930
into your finger as a dragging motion

215
00:10:10,930 --> 00:10:13,140
but it has to be every subtle.

216
00:10:13,140 --> 00:10:17,180
I will favorize the hand close/open motion

217
00:10:17,180 --> 00:10:18,590
of the fingers.

218
00:10:18,590 --> 00:10:21,900
Since there is not that much to explain

219
00:10:21,900 --> 00:10:25,940
about animating the fingers
for this walk cycle,

220
00:10:25,940 --> 00:10:28,110
I will let you with a bit of music

221
00:10:28,110 --> 00:10:30,650
to finish this little time lapse

222
00:10:30,650 --> 00:10:33,700
and have our whole walk cycle done.

223
00:10:33,700 --> 00:10:35,480
See you in the next chapter

224
00:10:35,480 --> 00:10:38,430
where we will learn
how to create appealing

225
00:10:38,430 --> 00:10:40,003
and convincing poses.

226
00:10:43,512 --> 00:10:46,262
(tranquil music)
