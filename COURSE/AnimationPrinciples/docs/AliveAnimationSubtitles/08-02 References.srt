00:00:00,200 --> 00:00:02,620
- [Instructor] If you've
watched the previous chapter,

2
00:00:02,620 --> 00:00:05,970
it's no surprise for you that
the first thing we need to do

3
00:00:05,970 --> 00:00:07,740
is search for references.

4
00:00:07,740 --> 00:00:10,550
This video, I will show
you what I'm looking for

5
00:00:10,550 --> 00:00:14,920
in my references and how I
use them to plan my animation.

6
00:00:14,920 --> 00:00:18,970
I'm convinced that we are in
the golden era of learning,

7
00:00:18,970 --> 00:00:21,569
or there is a bunch of stupid
things on the internet,

8
00:00:21,569 --> 00:00:25,480
and you can waste your whole
life watching funny cats

9
00:00:25,480 --> 00:00:26,380
and stuff like that.

10
00:00:26,380 --> 00:00:28,480
Nowadays, you can find tutorials

11
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:30,200
for almost everything in life.

12
00:00:30,200 --> 00:00:34,700
You won't necessarily get good
references from tutorials,

13
00:00:34,700 --> 00:00:38,090
but you can learn a lot about
the purpose of a stance,

14
00:00:38,090 --> 00:00:39,867
the purpose of a footwork,

15
00:00:39,867 --> 00:00:41,950
how the body's supposed to be moved

16
00:00:41,950 --> 00:00:44,610
to land an accurate
switch kick, for example.

17
00:00:44,610 --> 00:00:47,400
Watching this kind of video
would bring your attention

18
00:00:47,400 --> 00:00:51,760
to small details, whether they
are cultural or technical.

19
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:55,060
And those little details
will bring believability

20
00:00:55,060 --> 00:00:57,590
and authenticity to your animation.

21
00:00:57,590 --> 00:01:01,620
So it's always a good move
to mix your references

22
00:01:01,620 --> 00:01:03,500
with watching tutorials.

23
00:01:03,500 --> 00:01:08,230
And you should not limit you
references to real life videos.

24
00:01:08,230 --> 00:01:11,270
You can use drawings,
you can use video games,

25
00:01:11,270 --> 00:01:12,590
you can use movies.

26
00:01:12,590 --> 00:01:14,210
One of the most important thing

27
00:01:14,210 --> 00:01:16,760
is that you enjoy the
reference you've taken

28
00:01:16,760 --> 00:01:19,897
because whatever is appealing
to you in this video,

29
00:01:19,897 --> 00:01:23,940
it will stimulate you to put
them into your own animation.

30
00:01:23,940 --> 00:01:27,450
Finally, when it comes
to real life references,

31
00:01:27,450 --> 00:01:31,160
try to find the references
from the master on their art.

32
00:01:31,160 --> 00:01:33,630
Since I want to do a Muay Thai combo,

33
00:01:33,630 --> 00:01:36,530
I'm watching for references
featuring the masters

34
00:01:36,530 --> 00:01:41,530
at this art, like Saenchai,
Jacquot, Liam Harrison,

35
00:01:41,729 --> 00:01:43,852
or Jonathan Haggerty.

36
00:01:43,852 --> 00:01:46,430
Then you need to plan your own animation.

37
00:01:46,430 --> 00:01:48,160
If you are working in the movie industry,

38
00:01:48,160 --> 00:01:51,570
you will probably have a
storyboard or an animatic.

39
00:01:51,570 --> 00:01:53,240
If you're working for games,

40
00:01:53,240 --> 00:01:55,840
you will probably have a list of moves

41
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:57,770
provided by the game designers.

42
00:01:57,770 --> 00:01:59,500
And if you are working for yourself,

43
00:01:59,500 --> 00:02:02,420
then you can choose whatever
kind of move you want to do.

44
00:02:02,420 --> 00:02:05,730
But I advise you to do a
minimum of planning ahead

45
00:02:05,730 --> 00:02:08,430
and then edit your references accordingly.

46
00:02:08,430 --> 00:02:12,110
In my case, I want to
do a left jab, a cross,

47
00:02:12,110 --> 00:02:15,090
followed by a powerful hook,

48
00:02:15,090 --> 00:02:17,460
and then going into a switch kick.

49
00:02:17,460 --> 00:02:20,750
It's a pretty common combo
in kickboxing and Muay Thai

50
00:02:20,750 --> 00:02:23,130
and, animation wise, it's interesting

51
00:02:23,130 --> 00:02:26,010
because the first two
punches are straight,

52
00:02:26,010 --> 00:02:28,960
then the second draw a nice curve,

53
00:02:28,960 --> 00:02:32,270
and the last move draw
an even bigger curve.

54
00:02:32,270 --> 00:02:35,670
So we will have a nice contrast in shapes.

55
00:02:35,670 --> 00:02:39,920
I've gathered multiple
references from different people

56
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:41,220
doing the same move.

57
00:02:41,220 --> 00:02:44,000
And then using a video editing software,

58
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,980
you can use a Blender, for example,

59
00:02:45,980 --> 00:02:49,330
I make sure I'm syncing
all the videos together.

60
00:02:49,330 --> 00:02:51,182
And I use the extreme to do it.

61
00:02:51,182 --> 00:02:53,400
In this case, the different hits

62
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:54,970
of the punches and the kick.

63
00:02:54,970 --> 00:02:58,670
Finally, don't hesitate
to rework the timing

64
00:02:58,670 --> 00:03:02,320
of your references until
you get a nice rhythm.

65
00:03:02,320 --> 00:03:07,130
You can slow some parts,
accelerate other, or just cut in.

66
00:03:07,130 --> 00:03:09,696
No, listen to the hits on the reference.

67
00:03:09,696 --> 00:03:12,530
(men yell)

68
00:03:12,530 --> 00:03:15,640
Now, what I will do is
that I will cut the sound

69
00:03:15,640 --> 00:03:17,651
and only keep the impact.

70
00:03:17,651 --> 00:03:20,138
(punches thwap)

71
00:03:20,138 --> 00:03:20,971
(men yell)

72
00:03:20,971 --> 00:03:23,810
And it goes like, pum-pum, pum, pum.

73
00:03:23,810 --> 00:03:26,730
So while I was looking
for contrast in the motion

74
00:03:26,730 --> 00:03:30,420
of the reference, there is
also contrast in the rhythm.

75
00:03:30,420 --> 00:03:33,300
And if at some point you
have some linear reason

76
00:03:33,300 --> 00:03:36,350
into your reference, use video editing

77
00:03:36,350 --> 00:03:39,110
to get to a mock contrasted rhythm.

78
00:03:39,110 --> 00:03:42,550
And the best way to do it
is to do it with your mouth.

79
00:03:42,550 --> 00:03:45,230
Make the sound and the
rhythm with your mouth,

80
00:03:45,230 --> 00:03:47,900
tum, tum, tum, tum,

81
00:03:47,900 --> 00:03:51,390
and change it to ta-tum, tum, tum.

82
00:03:51,390 --> 00:03:52,910
Once you find a good rhythm,

83
00:03:52,910 --> 00:03:56,410
just edit your references
and go to the next step.

84
00:03:56,410 --> 00:03:59,300
With my reference exported,
the first thing I do

85
00:03:59,300 --> 00:04:02,660
is that I load it into
SimSketch or Keyframe Pro.

86
00:04:02,660 --> 00:04:05,310
From there, I will
scrub through the video.

87
00:04:05,310 --> 00:04:10,010
And I need to identify the
golden poses or the extreme.

88
00:04:10,010 --> 00:04:12,780
I'm looking at the poses
where the character

89
00:04:12,780 --> 00:04:14,500
are the most impactful.

90
00:04:14,500 --> 00:04:17,910
So it's generally the moment
where they hit the bag

91
00:04:17,910 --> 00:04:20,110
or just one frame after,

92
00:04:20,110 --> 00:04:22,770
as the punch goes a bit through the bag.

93
00:04:22,770 --> 00:04:24,570
For those first punches,

94
00:04:24,570 --> 00:04:27,900
this is the moment where the
body is fully in extension.

95
00:04:27,900 --> 00:04:30,880
And I will then do the same with the hook

96
00:04:32,260 --> 00:04:33,163
and the kick.

97
00:04:35,190 --> 00:04:38,520
Then I will try to spot
the contrasting poses.

98
00:04:38,520 --> 00:04:41,870
In this case, the
anticipation for the hook

99
00:04:41,870 --> 00:04:44,460
and the anticipation for the kicks.

100
00:04:44,460 --> 00:04:48,620
Once I spot them, we
can analyze those poses.

101
00:04:48,620 --> 00:04:50,680
So, as we did in the previous chapter,

102
00:04:50,680 --> 00:04:53,880
the first thing I'm looking
at are the line of action.

103
00:04:53,880 --> 00:04:56,320
On the idle stance,
the weight is generally

104
00:04:56,320 --> 00:05:00,250
on the rear foot so that
they can block incoming kicks

105
00:05:00,250 --> 00:05:02,955
with the front leg or the front shin.

106
00:05:02,955 --> 00:05:06,320
Which means the line of
action will generally go

107
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:10,450
through the punching fist and
the real leg that is pushing.

108
00:05:10,450 --> 00:05:12,740
On the hook, the energy generally come

109
00:05:12,740 --> 00:05:14,820
from the front leg and the hips.

110
00:05:14,820 --> 00:05:18,550
And finally, on the kick,
it's quite easier to identify

111
00:05:18,550 --> 00:05:21,250
by just watching the
silhouette of the character.

112
00:05:21,250 --> 00:05:23,260
One goes from the pushing foot

113
00:05:23,260 --> 00:05:25,300
and the other on the swinging leg.

114
00:05:25,300 --> 00:05:28,840
From there, I will be looking
at the secondary shape

115
00:05:28,840 --> 00:05:32,960
exactly as we did during
the previous chapter.

116
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:36,010
They generally help to
define the silhouette

117
00:05:36,010 --> 00:05:39,940
of the character once we have
defined the line of action.

118
00:05:39,940 --> 00:05:42,230
From there, I will go more into detail

119
00:05:42,230 --> 00:05:45,390
and I will try to define
the orientation of the chest

120
00:05:45,390 --> 00:05:48,908
using the shoulder line,
the orientation of the hips,

121
00:05:48,908 --> 00:05:52,210
and the orientation of
the head using the eyes.

122
00:05:52,210 --> 00:05:56,180
I'm also drawing lines
on the tip of the feet

123
00:05:56,180 --> 00:05:59,400
so is that I can remember
that I need to double check

124
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:01,130
the orientation of the feet.

125
00:06:01,130 --> 00:06:02,880
It's super important.

126
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:06,743
It's super important to pay
extra attention to the feet

127
00:06:06,743 --> 00:06:11,150
because they will directly
influence the hips' orientation.

128
00:06:11,150 --> 00:06:15,040
And we need an extra attention
for this specific animation

129
00:06:15,040 --> 00:06:19,870
because footwork in combat
sport is super important,

130
00:06:19,870 --> 00:06:23,120
as it delivers power and balance

131
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:26,850
and so it will bring
believability to your animation.

132
00:06:26,850 --> 00:06:29,340
So once you've done this
for your golden poses,

133
00:06:29,340 --> 00:06:32,610
you will have to do it for
the breakdowns, et cetera.

134
00:06:32,610 --> 00:06:35,550
So now that know my reference workflow,

135
00:06:35,550 --> 00:06:37,640
let's jump into the next video where we

136
00:06:37,640 --> 00:06:40,110
will start blocking our animation,

137
00:06:40,110 --> 00:06:43,273
using the key poses we have defined here.
