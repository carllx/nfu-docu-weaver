1
00:00:00,130 --> 00:00:02,450
- [Instructor] We will
start polishing the torso

2
00:00:02,450 --> 00:00:04,570
with the hips controller.

3
00:00:04,570 --> 00:00:06,560
As mentioned in the previous video,

4
00:00:06,560 --> 00:00:09,420
you should always start
polishing the controllers

5
00:00:09,420 --> 00:00:13,660
that have the most influence
or that move the most.

6
00:00:13,660 --> 00:00:15,730
In the case of the hips controller,

7
00:00:15,730 --> 00:00:20,020
it's gonna be the tilting
motion and twisting motion.

8
00:00:20,020 --> 00:00:22,320
And those are driven by the rotation,

9
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:24,510
I've hidden all the other key.

10
00:00:24,510 --> 00:00:26,310
Now I'm testing each curve

11
00:00:26,310 --> 00:00:29,050
to check what channel does what.

12
00:00:29,050 --> 00:00:32,220
The Z curve twist, the Y curve tilt.

13
00:00:32,220 --> 00:00:34,830
So I will start with the Y curve.

14
00:00:34,830 --> 00:00:38,100
I can now hide all the other curves.

15
00:00:38,100 --> 00:00:41,780
The hips motion is pretty
critical on the walk cycle.

16
00:00:41,780 --> 00:00:44,290
If it's off, it won't be convincing.

17
00:00:44,290 --> 00:00:47,800
If you add too much motion,
it will look too feminine.

18
00:00:47,800 --> 00:00:50,330
If you don't add enough motion,

19
00:00:50,330 --> 00:00:53,380
it won't look realistic or convincing.

20
00:00:53,380 --> 00:00:55,110
But there are some common rules

21
00:00:55,110 --> 00:00:56,440
whatever the weight

22
00:00:56,440 --> 00:01:00,030
or whether your character
is a male or a female.

23
00:01:00,030 --> 00:01:02,010
The hips will rapidly tilt

24
00:01:02,010 --> 00:01:04,690
as soon as the leg is
supporting the weight.

25
00:01:04,690 --> 00:01:08,130
So basically, one frame
after the contact pose,

26
00:01:08,130 --> 00:01:11,850
you will have a drastic
change in your curve shape.

27
00:01:11,850 --> 00:01:15,460
And as soon as you get
over the passing pose,

28
00:01:15,460 --> 00:01:18,630
it will slightly rotate the other way.

29
00:01:18,630 --> 00:01:21,839
A bit like the side to side motion we add

30
00:01:21,839 --> 00:01:24,120
with the center of gravity.

31
00:01:24,120 --> 00:01:28,330
So this is what I'm working
on, onto the curve right now.

32
00:01:28,330 --> 00:01:30,840
I'm getting a fast change in the motion

33
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:32,550
over a couple of frame

34
00:01:32,550 --> 00:01:36,080
before transitioning
into a slight plateau.

35
00:01:36,080 --> 00:01:38,870
So I'm done with the
first half of the cycle.

36
00:01:38,870 --> 00:01:42,127
I will remove all the keys after frame 16.

37
00:01:42,127 --> 00:01:44,160
I will then select all the keys

38
00:01:44,160 --> 00:01:47,430
from frame 0 to 16 and duplicate them

39
00:01:47,430 --> 00:01:51,140
and offset them between frame 16 and 32.

40
00:01:51,140 --> 00:01:55,620
My 2D cursor is already
aligned with the zero value.

41
00:01:55,620 --> 00:01:59,330
I can switch the pivot point to 2D cursor

42
00:01:59,330 --> 00:02:03,390
and then scale the keys from 16 to 32

43
00:02:03,390 --> 00:02:07,410
by minus 1 onto the Y axis.

44
00:02:07,410 --> 00:02:11,830
Then I will duplicate
frame 0 onto frame 32,

45
00:02:11,830 --> 00:02:13,790
and I will clean my curve.

46
00:02:13,790 --> 00:02:17,370
This way I have a perfectly
mirror motion of the hips.

47
00:02:17,370 --> 00:02:20,380
Then you can scale this
curve on the Y axis

48
00:02:20,380 --> 00:02:24,410
to whether increase or
decrease the tilting motion.

49
00:02:24,410 --> 00:02:25,790
Don't forget this is something

50
00:02:25,790 --> 00:02:28,330
we will be able to edit later on

51
00:02:28,330 --> 00:02:31,500
as we also work on the
twisting of the hips.

52
00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:36,490
So I'm considering this as a
decent polish of the Y curve

53
00:02:36,490 --> 00:02:38,393
and I will jump on the Z curve.

54
00:02:39,940 --> 00:02:43,430
As a switch to the Z
quaternion rotation curve

55
00:02:43,430 --> 00:02:44,580
of my hips,

56
00:02:44,580 --> 00:02:47,590
we must admit that this
is quite a surprise

57
00:02:47,590 --> 00:02:50,250
that the curve already looks pretty cool.

58
00:02:50,250 --> 00:02:53,350
I think I've nailed the
twisting motion of the hips

59
00:02:53,350 --> 00:02:55,380
during the blocking stage.

60
00:02:55,380 --> 00:02:57,460
Since I don't really know what to do,

61
00:02:57,460 --> 00:02:59,410
I've doubled check the reference.

62
00:02:59,410 --> 00:03:00,690
If we have a closer look,

63
00:03:00,690 --> 00:03:05,260
we can see that the hips
twist has a slight delay

64
00:03:05,260 --> 00:03:07,530
compared to the foot contact.

65
00:03:07,530 --> 00:03:11,690
As the character on the
left reach its contact pose,

66
00:03:11,690 --> 00:03:14,310
we can see the hips twisting forward

67
00:03:14,310 --> 00:03:16,560
for a couple of frames.

68
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:20,460
So what I will do is simply
offset the whole curve

69
00:03:20,460 --> 00:03:22,270
for a couple of frame

70
00:03:22,270 --> 00:03:26,040
and insert a keyframe on frame 32

71
00:03:26,040 --> 00:03:27,780
and then set it to 3

72
00:03:27,780 --> 00:03:30,370
and duplicate it on frame 0.

73
00:03:30,370 --> 00:03:34,060
I will then get rid of
the keyframe on frame 34,

74
00:03:34,060 --> 00:03:38,200
and I will call the Z quaternion
rotation polishing done.

75
00:03:38,200 --> 00:03:41,150
The X rotation is super subtle.

76
00:03:41,150 --> 00:03:45,910
I will just push the key on
frame 8 a little downward,

77
00:03:45,910 --> 00:03:47,500
back foot is pushing,

78
00:03:47,500 --> 00:03:50,650
it pushes a bit the hips forward

79
00:03:50,650 --> 00:03:52,600
and then it goes the other way.

80
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:55,640
The X rotation motion is super subtle.

81
00:03:55,640 --> 00:03:58,510
Just duplicate this revised frame 8,

82
00:03:58,510 --> 00:04:01,450
16 frame later on frame 24

83
00:04:01,450 --> 00:04:04,083
and I will call the X rotation curve done.

84
00:04:05,030 --> 00:04:07,640
We can now jump onto the chest controller

85
00:04:07,640 --> 00:04:10,180
and work on its rotation.

86
00:04:10,180 --> 00:04:14,460
I will start by working on both
Y and Z quaternion rotation

87
00:04:14,460 --> 00:04:16,320
at the same time.

88
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:19,160
The Y rotation will drive the tilt

89
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:21,320
while the Z will drive the twist.

90
00:04:21,320 --> 00:04:25,350
My goal is to build a bit
of contrast on the motion

91
00:04:25,350 --> 00:04:29,090
and slightly delay the motion of the chest

92
00:04:29,090 --> 00:04:32,430
compared to what we have
done during the blocking.

93
00:04:32,430 --> 00:04:35,470
It's about one frame or half the frame.

94
00:04:35,470 --> 00:04:38,360
Meaning that will push up a bit the key

95
00:04:38,360 --> 00:04:40,660
where the curve is starting to get down

96
00:04:40,660 --> 00:04:42,380
like on frame 8.

97
00:04:42,380 --> 00:04:45,190
And I will push a bit down the keys

98
00:04:45,190 --> 00:04:47,560
where the curve is starting to raise

99
00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:49,550
like on frame 24.

100
00:04:49,550 --> 00:04:51,450
Have a look to both polished curve,

101
00:04:51,450 --> 00:04:53,810
we can see that they are pretty smooth,

102
00:04:53,810 --> 00:04:57,980
meaning that they are going
from one extreme to the other

103
00:04:57,980 --> 00:04:59,520
in a smooth fashion,

104
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:02,710
without big changes in their shape.

105
00:05:02,710 --> 00:05:06,540
But we still recognize our usual pattern

106
00:05:06,540 --> 00:05:11,350
when we try to bring contrast
between two extremes,

107
00:05:11,350 --> 00:05:14,720
with a slight plateau
between those two extreme,

108
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:19,720
and then the value of the
curve changing a little faster

109
00:05:19,890 --> 00:05:23,100
during the passing or
during the transitions.

110
00:05:23,100 --> 00:05:25,020
The fact that we get this plateau

111
00:05:25,020 --> 00:05:28,980
make the shoulder easing into the extreme

112
00:05:28,980 --> 00:05:31,530
as if there was some kind of momentum

113
00:05:31,530 --> 00:05:34,023
during the swinging of the shoulders.

114
00:05:34,940 --> 00:05:38,110
And the result is pretty
close to what we have blocked.

115
00:05:38,110 --> 00:05:40,300
Just trying to get linear curve

116
00:05:40,300 --> 00:05:42,350
with a bit more contrast.

117
00:05:42,350 --> 00:05:43,930
Swing a bit with the timing,

118
00:05:43,930 --> 00:05:47,620
whenever the shoulder should
raise or twist forward.

119
00:05:47,620 --> 00:05:51,230
Just double check the
reference frame by frame,

120
00:05:51,230 --> 00:05:54,260
and you should find the right timing.

121
00:05:54,260 --> 00:05:57,200
Then regarding the shape of the curve,

122
00:05:57,200 --> 00:05:59,840
been following all the lessons so far,

123
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:02,170
you should be a little more comfortable

124
00:06:02,170 --> 00:06:04,440
with editing those curve

125
00:06:04,440 --> 00:06:08,140
and those S shape with a slight plateau

126
00:06:08,140 --> 00:06:12,070
will be read as for the
Z quaternion rotation

127
00:06:12,070 --> 00:06:14,960
and hold forward and backward

128
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:16,630
during the twisting,

129
00:06:16,630 --> 00:06:19,270
and for the Y quaternion rotation

130
00:06:19,270 --> 00:06:23,750
and hold upward or downward
during those extremes.

131
00:06:23,750 --> 00:06:27,220
Once I was done with the Z
and Y quaternion rotation,

132
00:06:27,220 --> 00:06:30,510
I switched to the X quaternion rotation

133
00:06:30,510 --> 00:06:31,990
to be super subtle,

134
00:06:31,990 --> 00:06:34,490
because if you go extreme on this,

135
00:06:34,490 --> 00:06:37,660
your character will look
drunk or unbalanced.

136
00:06:37,660 --> 00:06:39,830
And we will input more up and down

137
00:06:39,830 --> 00:06:43,070
using the Z location of this controller.

138
00:06:43,070 --> 00:06:46,030
In the end, I'm just
taking the whole curve

139
00:06:46,030 --> 00:06:48,300
and offsetting it by two frame.

140
00:06:48,300 --> 00:06:53,290
But the character bend a bit
forward just after the impact.

141
00:06:53,290 --> 00:06:55,570
And as it's pushing,

142
00:06:55,570 --> 00:07:00,300
then it will start bending
backward after the up pose.

143
00:07:00,300 --> 00:07:04,460
And the bend backward will
be pushed as it fall down

144
00:07:04,460 --> 00:07:07,500
as his body is getting lower and lower.

145
00:07:07,500 --> 00:07:10,290
So, there is not that
much editing on that curve

146
00:07:10,290 --> 00:07:14,220
but just offsetting it
in time on the X axis

147
00:07:14,220 --> 00:07:16,560
by two or three frame.

148
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:20,850
Then I will duplicate
frame 32, set it to 3,

149
00:07:20,850 --> 00:07:22,560
move it on frame 0

150
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:25,100
and then get rid of any keys

151
00:07:25,100 --> 00:07:28,133
that goes beyond the
frame 0 and the frame 32.

152
00:07:29,340 --> 00:07:33,060
Explain before, one extra
detail I'd like to add

153
00:07:33,060 --> 00:07:36,770
is the up and down motion
of the chest controller.

154
00:07:36,770 --> 00:07:40,150
It is currently driven
by the Z location curve

155
00:07:40,150 --> 00:07:41,780
of the chest controller.

156
00:07:41,780 --> 00:07:43,840
The curve is currently flat

157
00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:46,650
because I haven't posed any location

158
00:07:46,650 --> 00:07:48,320
during the blocking stage.

159
00:07:48,320 --> 00:07:52,260
The idea is to animate
the Z location curve

160
00:07:52,260 --> 00:07:55,220
based on the motion of the torso root.

161
00:07:55,220 --> 00:07:58,290
So I'm tracking the motion
path of the torso root

162
00:07:58,290 --> 00:08:02,200
to double check whenever
it's accelerating down,

163
00:08:02,200 --> 00:08:04,680
but you don't really need to do it.

164
00:08:04,680 --> 00:08:07,080
By simply going frame by frame,

165
00:08:07,080 --> 00:08:10,520
you will feel the moment the
body's accelerating down,

166
00:08:10,520 --> 00:08:13,310
and the moment the body
is accelerating up.

167
00:08:13,310 --> 00:08:17,420
The idea is to create an
overlapping motion of the chest

168
00:08:17,420 --> 00:08:20,840
whenever the body hits its lower pose,

169
00:08:20,840 --> 00:08:23,080
we will then, one frame later,

170
00:08:23,080 --> 00:08:27,310
or two frame later, push the chest down.

171
00:08:27,310 --> 00:08:30,100
We will hold a bit this
pose for a couple of frame

172
00:08:30,100 --> 00:08:32,140
as the body is raising.

173
00:08:32,140 --> 00:08:34,890
And then just after the up pose,

174
00:08:34,890 --> 00:08:37,720
when the body is falling down,

175
00:08:37,720 --> 00:08:39,630
we will raise the chest.

176
00:08:39,630 --> 00:08:41,470
As the chest is dragging,

177
00:08:41,470 --> 00:08:44,180
it's falling, but with a bit of delay.

178
00:08:44,180 --> 00:08:49,180
I've mainly work the curve
between frame 14 and frame 22,

179
00:08:49,260 --> 00:08:52,220
because this is the time
where we have a big change

180
00:08:52,220 --> 00:08:54,150
in the cock position.

181
00:08:54,150 --> 00:08:57,170
And this is your to work on this segment

182
00:08:57,170 --> 00:09:01,800
and then duplicate the
keys around frame 0 and 32

183
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:05,920
then working the transition
from frame 32 to 0.

184
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:10,260
In the end, this bouncing
motion will occur twice

185
00:09:10,260 --> 00:09:12,410
during our walk cycle.

186
00:09:12,410 --> 00:09:17,410
So once I've polished the one
between frame 14 and frame 22,

187
00:09:18,340 --> 00:09:23,340
I can duplicate my keys so
that it repeats 16 frame later.

188
00:09:23,480 --> 00:09:24,810
It's a very subtle bounce

189
00:09:24,810 --> 00:09:28,020
but it brings a bit of
texture to our motion.

190
00:09:28,020 --> 00:09:30,370
While we need to bring a bit of motion

191
00:09:30,370 --> 00:09:31,920
in the neck and head,

192
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:34,800
we will keep it as subtle as possible

193
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:38,290
unless you want to
build a goofy walk cycle

194
00:09:38,290 --> 00:09:41,840
that could fit a drunk
guy or even the babies

195
00:09:41,840 --> 00:09:46,460
that has a lot of trouble to
hold his head in position.

196
00:09:46,460 --> 00:09:49,750
You don't want to move the
head and the neck too much

197
00:09:49,750 --> 00:09:51,070
during your walk cycle

198
00:09:51,070 --> 00:09:53,720
or your character will
look like a chicken.

199
00:09:53,720 --> 00:09:54,760
So for the neck,

200
00:09:54,760 --> 00:09:58,660
I will only work on the
X quaternion rotation.

201
00:09:58,660 --> 00:10:01,550
When the character is moving up,

202
00:10:01,550 --> 00:10:05,300
clean a bit forward to
make the head dragging.

203
00:10:05,300 --> 00:10:08,460
And when the body will be falling forward,

204
00:10:08,460 --> 00:10:10,760
the neck will move backward.

205
00:10:10,760 --> 00:10:13,830
And I will apply the same
principle for the head.

206
00:10:13,830 --> 00:10:15,670
Right now I'm just making sure

207
00:10:15,670 --> 00:10:19,720
that my cycle is repeating
over my whole curve.

208
00:10:19,720 --> 00:10:21,910
Though each time I find a spot

209
00:10:21,910 --> 00:10:24,270
where I feel like my animation is right,

210
00:10:24,270 --> 00:10:29,270
I can duplicate the keys
and move them by 16 frame.

211
00:10:29,410 --> 00:10:32,300
This way I'm sure I get a consistent cycle

212
00:10:32,300 --> 00:10:33,590
that look right.

213
00:10:33,590 --> 00:10:36,190
Then I will do exactly the same thing,

214
00:10:36,190 --> 00:10:38,660
but this time with the head controller.

215
00:10:38,660 --> 00:10:40,720
Just track the tip of the nose

216
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:42,780
or the chin of your character

217
00:10:42,780 --> 00:10:44,570
as a point of reference.

218
00:10:44,570 --> 00:10:48,620
And again, keep this motion
as subtle as possible.

219
00:10:48,620 --> 00:10:51,090
You may not see it, just feel it,

220
00:10:51,090 --> 00:10:55,360
like the head is a bit
wobbling but very subtly

221
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:58,520
so that we feel like the
character is in control.

222
00:10:58,520 --> 00:11:00,340
If you feel comfortable enough,

223
00:11:00,340 --> 00:11:03,497
you can add a bit of Z quaternion rotation

224
00:11:03,497 --> 00:11:06,340
to create a bit of side to side delay

225
00:11:06,340 --> 00:11:08,070
in the rotation of the head

226
00:11:08,070 --> 00:11:10,400
but it has to be super subtle.

227
00:11:10,400 --> 00:11:14,160
Even more subtle than
this X rotation curve.

228
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:15,090
So in the end,

229
00:11:15,090 --> 00:11:16,950
if you don't animate the other channel,

230
00:11:16,950 --> 00:11:19,000
that's perfectly fine.

231
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,650
The torso polishing done.

232
00:11:20,650 --> 00:11:24,140
I'd like to add extra bit of details

233
00:11:24,140 --> 00:11:25,410
and to add a bit of bouncing

234
00:11:25,410 --> 00:11:27,820
on the pectoral muscle of the character.

235
00:11:27,820 --> 00:11:31,760
If you display the torso
tweak layer of bones,

236
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:35,450
you will find a controller
for pectoral muscle.

237
00:11:35,450 --> 00:11:38,450
The idea is that we will be
only animating one of them

238
00:11:38,450 --> 00:11:40,360
on its Z location,

239
00:11:40,360 --> 00:11:43,030
and then we will copy and paste its curve

240
00:11:43,030 --> 00:11:44,590
onto the other one.

241
00:11:44,590 --> 00:11:48,220
I will only animate direction
of the pectoral muscle

242
00:11:48,220 --> 00:11:49,310
on the impact.

243
00:11:49,310 --> 00:11:51,810
If it was a female character,

244
00:11:51,810 --> 00:11:53,600
there will be a lot of motion,

245
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:55,590
whether up and down, side to side,

246
00:11:55,590 --> 00:11:58,860
because women breast
is mainly made of fat.

247
00:11:58,860 --> 00:12:00,320
In the case of our character,

248
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:02,340
I only want to create motion

249
00:12:02,340 --> 00:12:04,730
whenever we are reaching the impact frame.

250
00:12:04,730 --> 00:12:07,830
So as the torso travels fast down

251
00:12:07,830 --> 00:12:09,720
before the contact frame,

252
00:12:09,720 --> 00:12:12,720
I will slightly raise the Z curve

253
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:15,680
to push the pectoral muscle up,

254
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:16,970
hold for a couple of frame,

255
00:12:16,970 --> 00:12:19,970
and then I will push it down super fast.

256
00:12:19,970 --> 00:12:23,453
We create a slight S curves
that goes up and down

257
00:12:23,453 --> 00:12:25,890
with a smaller and smaller amplitude

258
00:12:25,890 --> 00:12:29,520
will create a slight bouncing effect

259
00:12:29,520 --> 00:12:32,530
that is losing strength over time.

260
00:12:32,530 --> 00:12:34,950
I was happy with this first bounce,

261
00:12:34,950 --> 00:12:38,200
as usual, I've duplicated all the keys

262
00:12:38,200 --> 00:12:41,340
and moved them back by 16 frame.

263
00:12:41,340 --> 00:12:43,440
From there, I can copy the curve,

264
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:45,600
select the other controller,

265
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:48,720
then double-click its Z location channel,

266
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:50,590
get rid of all the key

267
00:12:50,590 --> 00:12:52,650
but the first and the last,

268
00:12:52,650 --> 00:12:56,210
and just press Control
+ V to paste the motion.

269
00:12:56,210 --> 00:13:00,730
Now both pectoral muscle
move with the same bounce.

270
00:13:00,730 --> 00:13:03,740
If you want to push a bit your walk cycle,

271
00:13:03,740 --> 00:13:05,620
you can apply the same effect

272
00:13:05,620 --> 00:13:07,570
on the butt of the character.

273
00:13:07,570 --> 00:13:10,040
But I will call the torso polishing done,

274
00:13:10,040 --> 00:13:13,137
and now we need to polish
the shoulders and the arms.
