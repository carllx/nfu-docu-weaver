00:00:00,830 --> 00:00:01,663
- [Instructor] In this video,

2
00:00:01,663 --> 00:00:04,490
we are going to polish
the legs of the character.

3
00:00:04,490 --> 00:00:05,650
It's pretty important

4
00:00:05,650 --> 00:00:08,380
because it will help
defining the silhouette

5
00:00:08,380 --> 00:00:10,152
of our character.

6
00:00:10,152 --> 00:00:13,430
It will also communicate
its weight and agility.

7
00:00:13,430 --> 00:00:15,330
Here you can see the final result

8
00:00:15,330 --> 00:00:17,705
of the whole character polished.

9
00:00:17,705 --> 00:00:20,130
Try to use the file
provided as a reference.

10
00:00:20,130 --> 00:00:21,720
Since they are the biggest,

11
00:00:21,720 --> 00:00:24,490
I will start with the back
legs of the character.

12
00:00:24,490 --> 00:00:27,590
Since we are using inverse
kinematic mechanism

13
00:00:27,590 --> 00:00:29,440
for those leg, the location

14
00:00:29,440 --> 00:00:32,000
are the most influential transform channel

15
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:33,780
for the animation of the legs.

16
00:00:33,780 --> 00:00:36,910
This is the first channel
we are going to edit.

17
00:00:36,910 --> 00:00:38,840
Now the legs of our character

18
00:00:38,840 --> 00:00:41,510
are dragging a lot toward the ground,

19
00:00:41,510 --> 00:00:43,880
making them looks very heavy,

20
00:00:43,880 --> 00:00:48,010
and like our character has
a hard time raising them.

21
00:00:48,010 --> 00:00:51,151
So we will need to rework the leg position

22
00:00:51,151 --> 00:00:52,813
while in the air.

23
00:00:52,813 --> 00:00:55,080
But we do need to keep a bit of delay

24
00:00:55,080 --> 00:00:56,240
on the leg motion

25
00:00:56,240 --> 00:00:58,467
since they are dragged by the body.

26
00:00:58,467 --> 00:01:00,130
And the first thing I will do

27
00:01:00,130 --> 00:01:04,510
is to offset by one frame
all the keys on frame six,

28
00:01:04,510 --> 00:01:08,020
putting a bit of delay
on the air extreme pose

29
00:01:08,020 --> 00:01:09,060
of the leg.

30
00:01:09,060 --> 00:01:12,620
From the side view, I will
be working on the z location

31
00:01:12,620 --> 00:01:15,280
and y location curve of the leg.

32
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:17,810
So I will hide all the other channel

33
00:01:17,810 --> 00:01:20,160
and focus on those curves.

34
00:01:20,160 --> 00:01:23,100
And while I'm polishing
the motion of the foot,

35
00:01:23,100 --> 00:01:25,960
I'm watching every single frame.

36
00:01:25,960 --> 00:01:29,210
The further you get
from the center of mass

37
00:01:29,210 --> 00:01:32,580
of your character, the
biggest will be the arcs.

38
00:01:32,580 --> 00:01:35,320
So when you are animating legs or hands

39
00:01:35,320 --> 00:01:36,820
on a character,

40
00:01:36,820 --> 00:01:39,920
it's very important to
track what you are doing

41
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:42,500
and to polish it as much as possible

42
00:01:42,500 --> 00:01:46,250
'cause a sudden gap in your curve

43
00:01:46,250 --> 00:01:49,410
will make the motion of
those parts very broad

44
00:01:49,410 --> 00:01:51,130
or very large.

45
00:01:51,130 --> 00:01:54,550
You will get a big glitch into the arc.

46
00:01:54,550 --> 00:01:56,900
Another thing to remember
is that a falling object

47
00:01:56,900 --> 00:01:59,640
will accelerate before it hits the ground.

48
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:01,500
So make sure that your spacing

49
00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:04,110
is the biggest before hitting the ground

50
00:02:04,110 --> 00:02:05,920
and when leaving the ground.

51
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:09,070
And you can convert the contacting frame

52
00:02:09,070 --> 00:02:10,503
with the ground to vector.

53
00:02:10,503 --> 00:02:13,330
It's the best way to avoid
easing in the first step.

54
00:02:13,330 --> 00:02:15,830
Finally, to have a better readability

55
00:02:15,830 --> 00:02:16,990
of the first leg,

56
00:02:16,990 --> 00:02:18,800
what I will do is go in front view

57
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:20,430
and press Alt + B

58
00:02:20,430 --> 00:02:22,950
and frame off of the character.

59
00:02:22,950 --> 00:02:25,450
It will enable the view clipping mode.

60
00:02:25,450 --> 00:02:27,700
It's like creating a tunnel

61
00:02:27,700 --> 00:02:30,529
and whatever is outside of this tunnel

62
00:02:30,529 --> 00:02:33,230
won't be shown in the 3D viewport.

63
00:02:33,230 --> 00:02:36,080
It's support handy to cut the visibility

64
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:38,060
of your character in half.

65
00:02:38,060 --> 00:02:41,020
While it's very useful
in modeling for sure,

66
00:02:41,020 --> 00:02:43,770
that's also very useful in animation.

67
00:02:43,770 --> 00:02:46,170
Just press Alt + B again

68
00:02:46,170 --> 00:02:48,003
to clear the clipping view.

69
00:02:48,982 --> 00:02:52,030
I'll advise you to
calculate the motion path

70
00:02:52,030 --> 00:02:54,360
of the foot as soon as possible.

71
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:57,900
You can see that I have a
very decent arc right away

72
00:02:57,900 --> 00:03:01,030
but I will polish it
using the motion path.

73
00:03:01,030 --> 00:03:03,300
The main thing I will focus on here

74
00:03:03,300 --> 00:03:06,370
is to make sure that the
character is pulling his leg

75
00:03:06,370 --> 00:03:08,780
as high as possible when jumping.

76
00:03:08,780 --> 00:03:10,530
So it will drag in the beginning

77
00:03:10,530 --> 00:03:14,060
and then it will catch up
and even get very close

78
00:03:14,060 --> 00:03:15,110
to its belly.

79
00:03:15,110 --> 00:03:17,750
So as my arcs looks very smooth

80
00:03:17,750 --> 00:03:21,300
and as I'm pretty satisfied
with the motion of the leg,

81
00:03:21,300 --> 00:03:22,930
I will switch to the front view

82
00:03:22,930 --> 00:03:26,840
to work on the x location
curve of the leg.

83
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:28,960
Here the method is pretty simple.

84
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:32,103
You want to avoid zigzagging motion.

85
00:03:32,103 --> 00:03:34,420
And when the foot is stuck on the ground,

86
00:03:34,420 --> 00:03:37,810
you may not have any
left and right motion.

87
00:03:37,810 --> 00:03:39,600
So polishing the x curve

88
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:41,580
is pretty straightforward.

89
00:03:41,580 --> 00:03:44,490
We apply the same rule
as when we are working

90
00:03:44,490 --> 00:03:45,550
on the under curve.

91
00:03:45,550 --> 00:03:48,550
Whenever the leg is contacting the ground,

92
00:03:48,550 --> 00:03:51,743
I will switch the handle type to vector.

93
00:03:51,743 --> 00:03:56,060
The next channel that
inputs the most motion

94
00:03:56,060 --> 00:03:59,170
into the foot then will be the x rotation.

95
00:03:59,170 --> 00:04:03,060
So this is the next curve
I will be working on.

96
00:04:03,060 --> 00:04:06,060
While I was pretty satisfied on the arc

97
00:04:06,060 --> 00:04:07,240
of the leg here,

98
00:04:07,240 --> 00:04:10,290
I've made quite a big mistake.

99
00:04:10,290 --> 00:04:13,400
I've worked the foot animation only

100
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:16,950
without root motion and that's a mistake.

101
00:04:16,950 --> 00:04:19,770
I advise you to check your animation with

102
00:04:19,770 --> 00:04:23,118
and without root motion
as often as possible

103
00:04:23,118 --> 00:04:26,430
because in the end, what
you will be animating

104
00:04:26,430 --> 00:04:28,810
or seeing into your animation

105
00:04:28,810 --> 00:04:31,840
will be your character
moving with the root motion.

106
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:33,770
It will be moving forward,

107
00:04:33,770 --> 00:04:36,254
not moving on place like that.

108
00:04:36,254 --> 00:04:39,460
And while the arc of the leg looks cool

109
00:04:39,460 --> 00:04:40,870
without root motion,

110
00:04:40,870 --> 00:04:43,130
when I've enabled the root motion,

111
00:04:43,130 --> 00:04:45,220
it didn't look that great.

112
00:04:45,220 --> 00:04:49,630
It's not going to be a major
issue on the animation here

113
00:04:49,630 --> 00:04:52,380
but I will have to fix it later on.

114
00:04:52,380 --> 00:04:53,950
So that's an issue.

115
00:04:53,950 --> 00:04:57,250
And you will save time if
you switch to root motion

116
00:04:57,250 --> 00:04:58,610
as soon as possible.

117
00:04:58,610 --> 00:05:00,980
Back to our foot x rotation.

118
00:05:00,980 --> 00:05:04,350
The main focus is to
get a smooth transition

119
00:05:04,350 --> 00:05:05,990
while in the air

120
00:05:05,990 --> 00:05:09,940
and to get a pretty fast flopping motion

121
00:05:09,940 --> 00:05:11,820
when leaving the ground.

122
00:05:11,820 --> 00:05:14,543
The foot is pushing the body forward.

123
00:05:14,543 --> 00:05:16,840
This is why we have a pretty big change

124
00:05:16,840 --> 00:05:19,200
between frame two and frame four

125
00:05:19,200 --> 00:05:21,750
and I'm polishing the
curve between frame one

126
00:05:21,750 --> 00:05:24,910
and frame two so that
the foot doesn't clip

127
00:05:24,910 --> 00:05:26,040
with the ground,

128
00:05:26,040 --> 00:05:29,580
which is represented by the y-axis here.

129
00:05:29,580 --> 00:05:31,130
One of my main concern

130
00:05:31,130 --> 00:05:35,110
was to choose whether I
would input foot roll or not.

131
00:05:35,110 --> 00:05:37,560
And I've decided to go ahead with it.

132
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:42,020
That's why our character is
landing on the ball of the foot

133
00:05:42,020 --> 00:05:44,990
and then it switches to
a flat foot position.

134
00:05:44,990 --> 00:05:47,340
You can think of it as a foot roll

135
00:05:47,340 --> 00:05:49,110
from the heel to the toes

136
00:05:49,110 --> 00:05:53,080
but on digit grad, like
cat, dogs or squirrel,

137
00:05:53,080 --> 00:05:55,920
the heel is currently
not touching the ground.

138
00:05:55,920 --> 00:05:58,670
So I'm not here to give
you an anatomic course

139
00:05:58,670 --> 00:06:02,040
but it's important to take
this into consideration

140
00:06:02,040 --> 00:06:06,310
because you will intuitively
translate human motion

141
00:06:06,310 --> 00:06:08,400
onto animal motion.

142
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:11,850
While it can work or be a stylized choice,

143
00:06:11,850 --> 00:06:14,580
it's important again to watch reference

144
00:06:14,580 --> 00:06:17,380
of animal and understand the behavior

145
00:06:17,380 --> 00:06:19,980
of the different part of their body,

146
00:06:19,980 --> 00:06:22,960
depending on their function or purpose.

147
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:26,340
Here I'm polishing the x
and y rotation of the foot.

148
00:06:26,340 --> 00:06:29,650
The idea is to make the
foot point a little inward

149
00:06:29,650 --> 00:06:31,540
when it's leaving the ground

150
00:06:31,540 --> 00:06:33,660
and point a little outward

151
00:06:33,660 --> 00:06:36,187
when it's going to contact the ground.

152
00:06:36,187 --> 00:06:38,500
One last thing, on the contact frame,

153
00:06:38,500 --> 00:06:42,560
I want the foot to contact
with the ground slightly

154
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:44,590
with its outer edge.

155
00:06:44,590 --> 00:06:47,200
This is a very subtle motion you will find

156
00:06:47,200 --> 00:06:49,570
in the foot motion of a human being

157
00:06:49,570 --> 00:06:51,260
during a walk cycle.

158
00:06:51,260 --> 00:06:54,790
The foot has a slight
tilt from left to right,

159
00:06:54,790 --> 00:06:56,620
while pushing on the ground.

160
00:06:56,620 --> 00:06:58,570
So even if it's very subtle,

161
00:06:58,570 --> 00:07:01,200
it's better to input this information

162
00:07:01,200 --> 00:07:04,670
in the foot motion of
our squirrel character.

163
00:07:04,670 --> 00:07:08,130
When I got onto polishing
the other back leg,

164
00:07:08,130 --> 00:07:10,100
finally made the clearer move

165
00:07:10,100 --> 00:07:13,200
to check my animation
with the root motion on

166
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:15,840
as I told you in the
beginning of this video.

167
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:19,500
And this is where I
spotted the weird curvature

168
00:07:19,500 --> 00:07:21,847
of my arc for the left leg.

169
00:07:21,847 --> 00:07:24,340
You can see some kind of vertical easing

170
00:07:24,340 --> 00:07:25,427
on the motion path.

171
00:07:25,427 --> 00:07:29,090
We had to get back onto the
polishing of the left leg.

172
00:07:29,090 --> 00:07:30,260
Fix this issue.

173
00:07:30,260 --> 00:07:31,840
And that's perfectly normal

174
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:34,790
that you have to refine
every single controller

175
00:07:34,790 --> 00:07:37,530
each time you are polishing one of them.

176
00:07:37,530 --> 00:07:40,510
As I told before, since
everything is connected,

177
00:07:40,510 --> 00:07:44,110
fixing a bug somewhere
or a bad motion somewhere

178
00:07:44,110 --> 00:07:47,250
may modify the perception
you have of the other part

179
00:07:47,250 --> 00:07:49,970
and you will have to polish it again.

180
00:07:49,970 --> 00:07:53,830
As every art form, an
animation is never finished.

181
00:07:53,830 --> 00:07:55,960
It's up to you and your schedule

182
00:07:55,960 --> 00:07:57,630
to call it done.

183
00:07:57,630 --> 00:07:59,520
The second important point

184
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:02,220
is to watch the silhouette
of your character.

185
00:08:02,220 --> 00:08:05,350
I don't think there is a
shortcut in Blender to do so

186
00:08:05,350 --> 00:08:07,800
but you can go to the shading option,

187
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:11,010
switch to flat and then object.

188
00:08:11,010 --> 00:08:15,360
This way, your character will
turn into a single solid color

189
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:18,180
that will help reading its silhouette.

190
00:08:18,180 --> 00:08:20,620
The idea is to avoid some part of the body

191
00:08:20,620 --> 00:08:24,310
to overlap and make the
silhouette harder to understand.

192
00:08:24,310 --> 00:08:26,840
For example, here if I overlay both feet,

193
00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:28,660
one one top of each other,

194
00:08:28,660 --> 00:08:30,960
the silhouette is harder to understand.

195
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:32,430
While if I separate them,

196
00:08:32,430 --> 00:08:34,600
I can see there are two feet.

197
00:08:34,600 --> 00:08:36,600
So this is not something you will be able

198
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:38,210
to manage all the time

199
00:08:38,210 --> 00:08:40,480
because sometimes, the point of view

200
00:08:40,480 --> 00:08:43,410
makes your body part overlapping

201
00:08:43,410 --> 00:08:45,150
but just keep it in mind.

202
00:08:45,150 --> 00:08:47,650
That's also why the position of the heel

203
00:08:47,650 --> 00:08:51,900
is slightly offset so that
we can see both heels tip.

204
00:08:51,900 --> 00:08:54,260
On the final polishing stage,

205
00:08:54,260 --> 00:08:57,810
I have tweaked the
position of the pull target

206
00:08:57,810 --> 00:08:59,660
to make sure that the legs

207
00:08:59,660 --> 00:09:02,730
were not pointing outward too much.

208
00:09:02,730 --> 00:09:05,890
This is not really about
polishing any motion here.

209
00:09:05,890 --> 00:09:10,630
It's mostly about fixing bugs
from the inverse kinematic.

210
00:09:10,630 --> 00:09:13,030
But I'm moving the controller in space

211
00:09:13,030 --> 00:09:14,670
whenever I feel the need,

212
00:09:14,670 --> 00:09:16,386
then playing with its curve.

213
00:09:16,386 --> 00:09:20,240
So I will lead you there
with a little time lapse

214
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:23,400
where I will be polishing both back legs

215
00:09:23,400 --> 00:09:26,210
and I'll see you a little
later in this video

216
00:09:26,210 --> 00:09:28,020
to polish the front legs.

217
00:09:29,516 --> 00:09:32,266
(tranquil music)

218
00:14:50,027 --> 00:14:53,150
For the front leg, I didn't
make the same mistake

219
00:14:53,150 --> 00:14:55,030
as for the back leg

220
00:14:55,030 --> 00:14:57,860
and mainly worked with root motion.

221
00:14:57,860 --> 00:15:01,550
The process is basically the
same as for the back leg,

222
00:15:01,550 --> 00:15:04,920
so I will just give you the two key points

223
00:15:04,920 --> 00:15:08,130
that you have to figure
out for this motion.

224
00:15:08,130 --> 00:15:11,500
The front legs are the
first to get in contact

225
00:15:11,500 --> 00:15:14,900
with the ground when your
character is landing.

226
00:15:14,900 --> 00:15:17,630
While it's important to make them drag

227
00:15:17,630 --> 00:15:19,350
in the beginning of the jump,

228
00:15:19,350 --> 00:15:22,320
when the character is
then losing altitude,

229
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:26,050
it's important to show that
the squirrel is in control.

230
00:15:26,050 --> 00:15:29,500
So you may not swing the
arms all the way around.

231
00:15:29,500 --> 00:15:32,370
Since we want to show that our character

232
00:15:32,370 --> 00:15:35,000
is in control of its run cycle,

233
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:40,000
then he will aim at the
target point he will land on

234
00:15:40,110 --> 00:15:41,350
with his arms.

235
00:15:41,350 --> 00:15:42,970
If we look at this reference

236
00:15:42,970 --> 00:15:45,480
where the character is shaking his arms

237
00:15:45,480 --> 00:15:47,550
and legs all the way around,

238
00:15:47,550 --> 00:15:50,420
we clearly understand
that he's not in control

239
00:15:50,420 --> 00:15:51,470
of the situation.

240
00:15:51,470 --> 00:15:54,270
Again, you have ask yourself
how to move the legs

241
00:15:54,270 --> 00:15:58,460
but also why you will move
them in a certain way.

242
00:15:58,460 --> 00:16:01,870
Again, animation is
like any other art form.

243
00:16:01,870 --> 00:16:04,760
If you want to make it believable,

244
00:16:04,760 --> 00:16:06,220
it has to make sense.

245
00:16:06,220 --> 00:16:09,370
From the timing, the
behavior of our character

246
00:16:09,370 --> 00:16:12,180
is mainly based on its weight,

247
00:16:12,180 --> 00:16:14,090
its agility, et cetera

248
00:16:14,090 --> 00:16:16,160
but as we go along in this course,

249
00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:18,450
we will try to ask also ourself

250
00:16:18,450 --> 00:16:21,180
how does my character feel?

251
00:16:21,180 --> 00:16:24,290
And how can we translate those emotion

252
00:16:24,290 --> 00:16:27,550
through motion, through animation?

253
00:16:27,550 --> 00:16:31,620
So keep this in mind whenever
you are animating something.

254
00:16:31,620 --> 00:16:34,005
The other thing here I want to avoid

255
00:16:34,005 --> 00:16:38,710
is to have the legs or
front arm over extending.

256
00:16:38,710 --> 00:16:41,370
This current rig is stretchable

257
00:16:41,370 --> 00:16:44,650
but it doesn't look that
good on this character.

258
00:16:44,650 --> 00:16:48,450
And also, even if the
animation is a bit stylized,

259
00:16:48,450 --> 00:16:53,100
I'd like to keep it on the
realistic side of things.

260
00:16:53,100 --> 00:16:56,560
I advise you to try to keep
this animation grounded,

261
00:16:56,560 --> 00:16:58,580
at least for this chapter

262
00:16:58,580 --> 00:16:59,890
because later on,

263
00:16:59,890 --> 00:17:03,110
when we will be working
on humanoid character,

264
00:17:03,110 --> 00:17:05,610
we will push the style a little further.

265
00:17:05,610 --> 00:17:08,673
Realistic animation is
a very hard exercise

266
00:17:08,673 --> 00:17:11,660
because it's about very subtle motion.

267
00:17:11,660 --> 00:17:13,110
Here I have a couple of frame

268
00:17:13,110 --> 00:17:16,360
where the character has
his front foot contacting

269
00:17:16,360 --> 00:17:17,193
with the ground.

270
00:17:17,193 --> 00:17:20,260
I've placed the 3D cursor as a guide

271
00:17:20,260 --> 00:17:21,890
by Shift + right clicking

272
00:17:21,890 --> 00:17:24,090
and tweaking the y location curve,

273
00:17:24,090 --> 00:17:27,430
I will make sure that the
foot is on the same position

274
00:17:27,430 --> 00:17:29,510
on both contacting frame.

275
00:17:29,510 --> 00:17:32,980
Then I will duplicate the
last frame on the first one

276
00:17:32,980 --> 00:17:36,630
so that both the first and
last frame of the cycle

277
00:17:36,630 --> 00:17:38,510
are the same as usual.

278
00:17:38,510 --> 00:17:43,510
So here you have the key component
to polish the front legs.

279
00:17:43,620 --> 00:17:46,210
Avoid overextending limb,

280
00:17:46,210 --> 00:17:50,050
avoid unnecessary and
goofy motion of the limbs,

281
00:17:50,050 --> 00:17:52,220
aim at the landing point.

282
00:17:52,220 --> 00:17:54,710
Make sure that the feet stays in place

283
00:17:54,710 --> 00:17:56,980
whenever there are
contacting with the ground

284
00:17:56,980 --> 00:17:59,670
and don't forget to check the silhouette

285
00:17:59,670 --> 00:18:02,860
whenever you are working
on both front legs.

286
00:18:02,860 --> 00:18:05,610
I will leave you there
with a little time lapse

287
00:18:05,610 --> 00:18:07,820
of me finishing this polish

288
00:18:07,820 --> 00:18:09,710
and I'll see you in the next video

289
00:18:09,710 --> 00:18:13,291
where we are going to polish
the tail of our character.

290
00:18:13,291 --> 00:18:16,041
(tranquil music)
