00:00:00,540 --> 00:00:01,373
- [Instructor] In this video,

2
00:00:01,373 --> 00:00:03,030
we will work on the first shot.

3
00:00:03,030 --> 00:00:05,620
I've already added a camera rig

4
00:00:05,620 --> 00:00:08,100
and I've already created a keying set

5
00:00:08,100 --> 00:00:09,950
for the different controllers

6
00:00:09,950 --> 00:00:13,050
but also the camera
properties you can access,

7
00:00:13,050 --> 00:00:14,600
pressing the N key.

8
00:00:14,600 --> 00:00:18,450
I have keyed the focal length
and the focus distance.

9
00:00:18,450 --> 00:00:20,470
I will now move my mouse cursor

10
00:00:20,470 --> 00:00:22,830
onto the 3D view we have on the right

11
00:00:22,830 --> 00:00:24,290
with the camera view.

12
00:00:24,290 --> 00:00:27,760
Press Z and switch to rendered view mode.

13
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:30,100
I'm using the Eevee render engine

14
00:00:30,100 --> 00:00:32,771
and the scene is pretty light.

15
00:00:32,771 --> 00:00:37,060
Is it should render properly
on almost every graphic cards.

16
00:00:37,060 --> 00:00:39,800
Let's now have a look to the organization

17
00:00:39,800 --> 00:00:40,750
of the scene.

18
00:00:40,750 --> 00:00:44,890
All the assets are organized
into the scene collection

19
00:00:44,890 --> 00:00:47,140
and there are sub-collections.

20
00:00:47,140 --> 00:00:51,890
All the collections tagged in
green includes all the assets

21
00:00:51,890 --> 00:00:53,460
for the environment

22
00:00:53,460 --> 00:00:55,580
so that you can deactivate them

23
00:00:55,580 --> 00:00:59,460
whenever your computer is
slowing down, for example.

24
00:00:59,460 --> 00:01:02,580
The set collection
includes all the lights,

25
00:01:02,580 --> 00:01:05,070
the lights effect and the camera.

26
00:01:05,070 --> 00:01:07,110
The particle emit collection

27
00:01:07,110 --> 00:01:09,571
includes all the particle emitters

28
00:01:09,571 --> 00:01:12,090
that generates the falling leaves

29
00:01:12,090 --> 00:01:14,190
but also the birds flying

30
00:01:14,190 --> 00:01:17,100
that we can see in the
beginning of the teaser.

31
00:01:17,100 --> 00:01:19,560
I won't show you how to
create all those assets

32
00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:22,420
because this is not the
purpose of this course.

33
00:01:22,420 --> 00:01:26,670
All the bushes and trees
are currently instanced.

34
00:01:26,670 --> 00:01:29,660
As when we link an asset
from another scene,

35
00:01:29,660 --> 00:01:32,430
you can instance an asset into the scene.

36
00:01:32,430 --> 00:01:33,263
So you can see,

37
00:01:33,263 --> 00:01:37,330
those are empty object
instancing a collection.

38
00:01:37,330 --> 00:01:41,580
Those collect are under
the asset main collection.

39
00:01:41,580 --> 00:01:44,370
So if you want to modify the tree model,

40
00:01:44,370 --> 00:01:47,130
you have to do it in those assets

41
00:01:47,130 --> 00:01:49,420
but I advise you not to do it.

42
00:01:49,420 --> 00:01:52,070
But if, for example, I scale down one

43
00:01:52,070 --> 00:01:55,570
of the trees, you can see that
now the trees are very small

44
00:01:55,570 --> 00:01:57,140
in my main scene.

45
00:01:57,140 --> 00:02:01,010
So you can easily duplicate
and change the orientation

46
00:02:01,010 --> 00:02:03,700
or scale of the objects that are available

47
00:02:03,700 --> 00:02:06,530
in the scene to create
your own environment

48
00:02:06,530 --> 00:02:08,233
or tweak this one if you will.

49
00:02:09,850 --> 00:02:11,960
Let's now import our character.

50
00:02:11,960 --> 00:02:14,940
I will make sure I have
my main scene selected.

51
00:02:14,940 --> 00:02:19,940
Go to File, Link, insert for
the squirrel finished file.

52
00:02:20,150 --> 00:02:22,150
I will go into the collection

53
00:02:22,150 --> 00:02:25,290
and link our squirrel collection.

54
00:02:25,290 --> 00:02:27,330
I can move it on the y-axis

55
00:02:27,330 --> 00:02:29,050
so that we can see it.

56
00:02:29,050 --> 00:02:30,590
From there in the outliner,

57
00:02:30,590 --> 00:02:34,110
I will expand the squirrel library,

58
00:02:34,110 --> 00:02:36,120
search for the collection, right click.

59
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:39,830
ID Data, Add Library Override Hierarchy.

60
00:02:39,830 --> 00:02:41,970
It has created a new collection,

61
00:02:41,970 --> 00:02:46,170
including our rig and
our character centered

62
00:02:46,170 --> 00:02:47,310
in our scene.

63
00:02:47,310 --> 00:02:49,650
So we can now select the source

64
00:02:49,650 --> 00:02:51,040
and get rid of it.

65
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:54,520
I can now select the
armature of my character

66
00:02:54,520 --> 00:02:58,040
and place it wherever I want in the set.

67
00:02:58,040 --> 00:02:59,380
From there, let's check

68
00:02:59,380 --> 00:03:02,390
if we have all our animation available.

69
00:03:02,390 --> 00:03:04,450
Select the character armature.

70
00:03:04,450 --> 00:03:07,670
I advise you to use the
outliner to select it

71
00:03:07,670 --> 00:03:09,490
because on complex scenes,

72
00:03:09,490 --> 00:03:11,540
selection can be a bit messy.

73
00:03:11,540 --> 00:03:14,300
From there, in the 3D
view, press Control + Tab

74
00:03:14,300 --> 00:03:15,550
to switch to pose mode

75
00:03:15,550 --> 00:03:17,530
and in the action editor,

76
00:03:17,530 --> 00:03:21,370
have a look at the
different linked animation.

77
00:03:21,370 --> 00:03:23,100
Logging set can be useful,

78
00:03:23,100 --> 00:03:24,540
so I will duplicate it,

79
00:03:24,540 --> 00:03:27,320
so now I have a new
copy of the keying set.

80
00:03:27,320 --> 00:03:29,070
I remember I have named

81
00:03:29,070 --> 00:03:33,120
my final run cycle animation Runcycle.

82
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:36,370
So as I find it, I will duplicate it

83
00:03:36,370 --> 00:03:39,500
and since I'm missing the idle animation

84
00:03:39,500 --> 00:03:42,510
we have created in the previous videos,

85
00:03:42,510 --> 00:03:44,173
I will go to File,

86
00:03:45,050 --> 00:03:48,350
choose Link, but you can
append the animation,

87
00:03:48,350 --> 00:03:50,320
browse into my Blender file

88
00:03:50,320 --> 00:03:52,440
and go to the Action folder

89
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:54,200
and choose the idle.

90
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:57,150
If you have append it, it will be added

91
00:03:57,150 --> 00:03:59,520
as a new animation.

92
00:03:59,520 --> 00:04:02,800
If you have linked it, just
browse in your library,

93
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:05,150
select it and click on the icon

94
00:04:05,150 --> 00:04:06,920
to make it a new action.

95
00:04:06,920 --> 00:04:08,080
To create this shot,

96
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:10,890
we will combine the run cycle and the idle

97
00:04:10,890 --> 00:04:15,252
and we will layer some root
motion using the NLA editor.

98
00:04:15,252 --> 00:04:18,620
We can now switch back to object mode

99
00:04:18,620 --> 00:04:22,250
and we will position our
character more or less

100
00:04:22,250 --> 00:04:26,410
where he has to land where
he jump out of the bush.

101
00:04:26,410 --> 00:04:27,980
Don't worry, we will be able

102
00:04:27,980 --> 00:04:31,080
to fine tweak its position later on.

103
00:04:31,080 --> 00:04:33,510
Since we have a pretty noisy ground,

104
00:04:33,510 --> 00:04:35,760
you don't really care if your character

105
00:04:35,760 --> 00:04:37,740
is perfectly contacting the ground.

106
00:04:37,740 --> 00:04:39,070
Just raise him a bit

107
00:04:39,070 --> 00:04:42,570
so that we can distinguish its feet.

108
00:04:42,570 --> 00:04:45,520
To make my life easier, since
I will be mainly working

109
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:47,760
on the character, I will make sure

110
00:04:47,760 --> 00:04:51,760
that I will make all the
other collection unselectable

111
00:04:51,760 --> 00:04:53,620
by clicking this icon.

112
00:04:53,620 --> 00:04:55,640
If it's not available for you,

113
00:04:55,640 --> 00:04:58,410
just go in the filter and activate it.

114
00:04:58,410 --> 00:05:01,480
Now I will go back in
pose mode on my character.

115
00:05:01,480 --> 00:05:05,090
I will load its keying animation,

116
00:05:05,090 --> 00:05:10,090
duplicate it and rename it to
create a locomotion action.

117
00:05:10,540 --> 00:05:14,290
This is the action we will
layer on top of our run cycle

118
00:05:14,290 --> 00:05:17,490
and idle to move our character in space.

119
00:05:17,490 --> 00:05:20,380
Now we can open the NLA editor

120
00:05:20,380 --> 00:05:23,380
where we will combine
those different actions.

121
00:05:23,380 --> 00:05:27,260
I will enable the show
only selected option

122
00:05:27,260 --> 00:05:29,990
and I will get rid of all those NLA tracks

123
00:05:30,920 --> 00:05:32,240
that are not used.

124
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:36,100
We have a first NLA track
that is available called run,

125
00:05:36,100 --> 00:05:38,770
so as seen in the NLA video,

126
00:05:38,770 --> 00:05:41,210
if I close my action,

127
00:05:41,210 --> 00:05:43,840
then the NLA track will be rigged.

128
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:46,420
And we can see one cycle of the run cycle.

129
00:05:46,420 --> 00:05:50,510
I can press Shift + A
and add an idle action

130
00:05:50,510 --> 00:05:54,000
so that our character
will make one run cycle,

131
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,440
then jump into the idle

132
00:05:56,440 --> 00:06:00,010
and then I can add a more run cycle action

133
00:06:00,010 --> 00:06:03,710
after the idle or you can
duplicate the current one.

134
00:06:03,710 --> 00:06:06,030
I will duplicate it three times

135
00:06:06,030 --> 00:06:09,930
so that our character
will make three cycle.

136
00:06:09,930 --> 00:06:13,420
Or you can simply change the strip length.

137
00:06:13,420 --> 00:06:16,980
Since there is a cycle
modifier on the curve,

138
00:06:16,980 --> 00:06:19,700
the character will repeat the run cycle.

139
00:06:19,700 --> 00:06:21,770
But this might not work

140
00:06:21,770 --> 00:06:24,320
since we have linked the animation.

141
00:06:24,320 --> 00:06:26,410
And it might create conflict,

142
00:06:26,410 --> 00:06:29,580
so the NLA editor won't
allow you to do so.

143
00:06:29,580 --> 00:06:32,870
But we will see that later
as it's a bit complex

144
00:06:32,870 --> 00:06:35,840
and we don't need to dive into this topic.

145
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:38,610
Now I will select the first NLA track

146
00:06:38,610 --> 00:06:43,610
and press Shift + A and add
our locomotion animation to it.

147
00:06:44,210 --> 00:06:45,880
The strip is almost empty

148
00:06:45,880 --> 00:06:48,850
because the action is only
one frame for the time being,

149
00:06:48,850 --> 00:06:51,643
so let's open it in the action editor.

150
00:06:52,500 --> 00:06:55,770
The idea is to key our first move.

151
00:06:55,770 --> 00:06:58,600
If you remember well, our run cycle

152
00:06:58,600 --> 00:07:01,870
was performed within 12 frames

153
00:07:01,870 --> 00:07:05,070
and our character was moving by 0.7 meter

154
00:07:05,070 --> 00:07:07,870
in the negative direction.

155
00:07:07,870 --> 00:07:10,200
My root bone selected in post mode.

156
00:07:10,200 --> 00:07:15,200
I will type in -0.7 meter
in the y location channel

157
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:17,290
and insert a keyframe.

158
00:07:17,290 --> 00:07:20,710
Remember to enable the
autokeying in the timeline

159
00:07:20,710 --> 00:07:24,050
and the keying set to available only.

160
00:07:24,050 --> 00:07:27,360
I can add a keyframe by simply pressing I

161
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:28,910
in my action editor.

162
00:07:28,910 --> 00:07:32,680
Then I will select my
root keys and press V

163
00:07:32,680 --> 00:07:34,490
to switch them to vector.

164
00:07:34,490 --> 00:07:36,530
Since I already have a track

165
00:07:36,530 --> 00:07:38,920
with the locomotion action onto it,

166
00:07:38,920 --> 00:07:43,080
I can close the locomotion
action in the action editor

167
00:07:43,080 --> 00:07:45,210
and my character is still moving,

168
00:07:45,210 --> 00:07:47,890
reading the locomotion track.

169
00:07:47,890 --> 00:07:51,710
If I disable it, the character
will read the next track

170
00:07:51,710 --> 00:07:53,490
with the idle in the run.

171
00:07:53,490 --> 00:07:57,700
To combine them, we need to
change the strip blending mode.

172
00:07:57,700 --> 00:07:59,550
And this is where it's a bit tricky.

173
00:07:59,550 --> 00:08:01,825
At the time I'm recording this video,

174
00:08:01,825 --> 00:08:06,825
I've tested it on Blender 2.91 and 92

175
00:08:07,010 --> 00:08:10,730
and we can't edit the strip behavior used

176
00:08:10,730 --> 00:08:12,283
by a linked data,

177
00:08:13,220 --> 00:08:14,540
which is a bit weird

178
00:08:14,540 --> 00:08:17,180
since we can modify the action

179
00:08:17,180 --> 00:08:20,270
but we can't modify the
way the action are used

180
00:08:20,270 --> 00:08:22,000
with the NLA editor.

181
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:26,290
To fix this, and I believe
this is a temporary fix,

182
00:08:26,290 --> 00:08:30,450
and the behavior will change
with newer Blender versions,

183
00:08:30,450 --> 00:08:33,580
we need to make our rig fully local,

184
00:08:33,580 --> 00:08:37,700
breaking the link between the
scene and the original file.

185
00:08:37,700 --> 00:08:41,620
Simply left click on the
override icon near the name

186
00:08:41,620 --> 00:08:42,800
of your object.

187
00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:45,700
From there, the strip option are available

188
00:08:45,700 --> 00:08:47,140
and we can change them,

189
00:08:47,140 --> 00:08:50,150
making this run cycle action, for example,

190
00:08:50,150 --> 00:08:52,330
longer and repeating over time.

191
00:08:52,330 --> 00:08:54,560
Or more important in our case,

192
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:57,570
selecting the locomotion action

193
00:08:57,570 --> 00:09:01,080
and switching its
blending mode to combine.

194
00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:04,887
This way we get both the locomotion action

195
00:09:04,887 --> 00:09:08,380
and the running cycle
action combined together.

196
00:09:08,380 --> 00:09:10,530
And since we are using Alt + forward,

197
00:09:10,530 --> 00:09:13,380
our character keep the last position

198
00:09:13,380 --> 00:09:15,170
of the root bone we have keyed,

199
00:09:15,170 --> 00:09:19,410
exactly as shown in the NLA editor video.

200
00:09:19,410 --> 00:09:23,140
So now that we are able to
move our character in space,

201
00:09:23,140 --> 00:09:25,430
let's position hin properly based

202
00:09:25,430 --> 00:09:27,360
on the camera position.

203
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:30,030
I will also clean up a bit my file

204
00:09:30,030 --> 00:09:33,400
by renaming the locomotion
track, locomotion.

205
00:09:33,400 --> 00:09:36,730
From there, select the
armature of the character

206
00:09:36,730 --> 00:09:39,450
and make sure that you are in object mode.

207
00:09:39,450 --> 00:09:43,007
The goal is not to animate
the position of our character

208
00:09:43,007 --> 00:09:46,530
but just properly frame
where he'll be standing

209
00:09:46,530 --> 00:09:49,540
while performing his idle animation.

210
00:09:49,540 --> 00:09:53,220
So by moving the armature
object in object mode,

211
00:09:53,220 --> 00:09:56,890
I'm kind of setting where
the animation starts

212
00:09:56,890 --> 00:10:00,090
and the idea here is to do it in top view

213
00:10:00,090 --> 00:10:03,940
and double check in my
camera view how it looks.

214
00:10:03,940 --> 00:10:06,480
The character goes through the bush

215
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:09,920
and kind of land in the
middle of the screen.

216
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:11,420
So it looks great to me

217
00:10:11,420 --> 00:10:13,970
but you are free to move
the bush a little bit

218
00:10:13,970 --> 00:10:16,890
and then we will edit the camera position.

219
00:10:16,890 --> 00:10:19,773
So now I'd like to make my character move

220
00:10:19,773 --> 00:10:21,320
once he's escaping.

221
00:10:21,320 --> 00:10:23,967
So we need to edit our locomotion action

222
00:10:23,967 --> 00:10:26,180
and we can press the Tab key

223
00:10:26,180 --> 00:10:31,180
to enter tweak mode and
automatically access our action

224
00:10:31,190 --> 00:10:32,580
in the action editor.

225
00:10:32,580 --> 00:10:35,880
We can duplicate frame 12 and move it

226
00:10:35,880 --> 00:10:37,860
on frame 104.

227
00:10:37,860 --> 00:10:41,100
This way, the root of our
character doesn't move.

228
00:10:41,100 --> 00:10:43,500
Now for the next 12 frames,

229
00:10:43,500 --> 00:10:47,780
I'd like to move my
character by 0.7 meters.

230
00:10:47,780 --> 00:10:52,780
So I will input a value of
-1.4 meter on my y-axis.

231
00:10:54,200 --> 00:10:57,230
And Blender should
automatically write the key.

232
00:10:57,230 --> 00:11:00,150
But it doesn't and when I try to force it,

233
00:11:00,150 --> 00:11:01,860
pressing the I key,

234
00:11:01,860 --> 00:11:03,640
I get an error message.

235
00:11:03,640 --> 00:11:05,830
Blender tells me that this action

236
00:11:05,830 --> 00:11:07,730
is used in the NLA editor

237
00:11:07,730 --> 00:11:11,730
but the NLA editor has no
influence to using this action.

238
00:11:11,730 --> 00:11:14,030
But when I check the NLA strip

239
00:11:14,030 --> 00:11:15,870
and I check the action influence,

240
00:11:15,870 --> 00:11:18,500
it's set to one but what's happening here

241
00:11:18,500 --> 00:11:22,470
is that our locomotion strip
on the locomotion track

242
00:11:22,470 --> 00:11:23,940
is too short.

243
00:11:23,940 --> 00:11:27,610
So it has no influence
beyond the frame 12.

244
00:11:27,610 --> 00:11:31,480
Hence Blender doesn't allow
to insert the keyframe.

245
00:11:31,480 --> 00:11:32,760
To fix this problem,

246
00:11:32,760 --> 00:11:36,610
we can ask Blender to
automatically update the length

247
00:11:36,610 --> 00:11:37,840
of the strip.

248
00:11:37,840 --> 00:11:41,150
We just need to go to
the action clip option

249
00:11:41,150 --> 00:11:43,820
and enable synchronize length.

250
00:11:43,820 --> 00:11:46,650
Now if I change the value of the y-axis

251
00:11:46,650 --> 00:11:47,520
of the root bone,

252
00:11:47,520 --> 00:11:51,470
Blender will automatically
insert a keyframe as usual.

253
00:11:51,470 --> 00:11:54,000
I will select the newly created key,

254
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,310
press the V key

255
00:11:55,310 --> 00:11:57,810
and switch its handle type to vector.

256
00:11:57,810 --> 00:12:00,000
So that we have now fixed this problem

257
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,730
and we can move our character in space,

258
00:12:02,730 --> 00:12:06,030
I like to give some
variation to the animation.

259
00:12:06,030 --> 00:12:08,500
Instead of making our character moving

260
00:12:08,500 --> 00:12:11,900
in a straight line, I
like him to rotate a bit

261
00:12:11,900 --> 00:12:13,460
on the second jump.

262
00:12:13,460 --> 00:12:15,110
So I will go into top view

263
00:12:15,110 --> 00:12:17,850
and I will disable the bush collection

264
00:12:17,850 --> 00:12:20,990
so that we have a better
overview of our character.

265
00:12:20,990 --> 00:12:22,660
I will rotate it a bit

266
00:12:22,660 --> 00:12:27,180
and offset it a bit on the
side, only using the root bone

267
00:12:27,180 --> 00:12:30,440
and being on frame 160.

268
00:12:30,440 --> 00:12:34,124
Then I will move the
playhead 12 frames later

269
00:12:34,124 --> 00:12:36,860
on frame 128

270
00:12:36,860 --> 00:12:40,650
where our character will
land for the next time

271
00:12:40,650 --> 00:12:42,880
and I will offset its position.

272
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:45,340
It doesn't have to be super accurate.

273
00:12:45,340 --> 00:12:49,530
I'm just trying to offset
my character by 0.7 meter

274
00:12:49,530 --> 00:12:51,100
in the same direction.

275
00:12:51,100 --> 00:12:54,330
Since our character is
jumping out of the frame,

276
00:12:54,330 --> 00:12:58,348
it doesn't matter if it's
not perfectly accurate.

277
00:12:58,348 --> 00:13:01,040
The motion might look a bit
robotic from the top view

278
00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:03,670
but from the side view or the camera view,

279
00:13:03,670 --> 00:13:05,380
it does look pretty cool.

280
00:13:05,380 --> 00:13:07,870
That's another thing
we haven't tackled yet

281
00:13:07,870 --> 00:13:11,550
is that you generally
animate to camera view,

282
00:13:11,550 --> 00:13:14,540
meaning that it doesn't
matter how it looks

283
00:13:14,540 --> 00:13:16,450
from other angles.

284
00:13:16,450 --> 00:13:18,800
The thing is that it has to look straight

285
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:22,090
from what will be outputted in the movie.

286
00:13:22,090 --> 00:13:25,170
So now if you want, you
can add some extra motion

287
00:13:25,170 --> 00:13:26,340
to your character.

288
00:13:26,340 --> 00:13:28,900
To keep things simple for this animation,

289
00:13:28,900 --> 00:13:31,260
we will only add a bit of rotation

290
00:13:31,260 --> 00:13:33,090
in the main torso controller.

291
00:13:33,090 --> 00:13:37,710
Add a keyframe on all
channels on frame 104.

292
00:13:37,710 --> 00:13:39,990
From there, I will try
to have a better angle

293
00:13:39,990 --> 00:13:44,140
on my character and select the
main root torso controller.

294
00:13:44,140 --> 00:13:46,540
We will go on frame 109,

295
00:13:46,540 --> 00:13:49,067
more or less in the middle of the jump

296
00:13:49,067 --> 00:13:53,070
and the idea is to slightly
twist our character

297
00:13:53,070 --> 00:13:56,120
toward the direction he's jumping to.

298
00:13:56,120 --> 00:14:00,454
So the idea is to slightly
rotate the main controller

299
00:14:00,454 --> 00:14:02,410
on the local y-axis.

300
00:14:02,410 --> 00:14:06,410
So I will switch the pivot point to local,

301
00:14:06,410 --> 00:14:10,370
press R and then Y to
constraint on the local y

302
00:14:10,370 --> 00:14:12,618
and slightly lean our character.

303
00:14:12,618 --> 00:14:15,420
Then on the frame where he's landing,

304
00:14:15,420 --> 00:14:19,160
I will press Alt + R
to cancel the rotation.

305
00:14:19,160 --> 00:14:21,510
This will just add a little twist

306
00:14:21,510 --> 00:14:24,760
to the character body while
he's changing rotation,

307
00:14:24,760 --> 00:14:27,200
making it look more natural.

308
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:28,530
What I want to show you there

309
00:14:28,530 --> 00:14:31,010
is that you can fine tweak your animation

310
00:14:31,010 --> 00:14:33,020
at will using this method.

311
00:14:33,020 --> 00:14:36,270
If you want, you can lay
a bit of head rotation

312
00:14:36,270 --> 00:14:37,840
or tail rotation

313
00:14:37,840 --> 00:14:39,800
and this is a very good method

314
00:14:39,800 --> 00:14:42,140
to get high-quality results

315
00:14:42,140 --> 00:14:45,670
without spending too much
time on the animation.

316
00:14:45,670 --> 00:14:48,250
So it's a perfect method for beginners

317
00:14:48,250 --> 00:14:51,620
or if you are tight on the time budget.

318
00:14:51,620 --> 00:14:55,550
Now is the perfect time to
work on our camera animation.

319
00:14:55,550 --> 00:14:58,407
If you press Tab or select
another action strip,

320
00:14:58,407 --> 00:15:02,400
Blender will automatically
exit the tweak mode.

321
00:15:02,400 --> 00:15:05,380
And the length of our locomotion strip

322
00:15:05,380 --> 00:15:09,680
has been updated thanks to
the synchronize length option.

323
00:15:09,680 --> 00:15:11,810
From there, I can press Control + Tab

324
00:15:11,810 --> 00:15:13,750
to get out of pose mode

325
00:15:13,750 --> 00:15:15,930
on our squirrel armature.

326
00:15:15,930 --> 00:15:19,690
Make sure that I make
my collection selectable

327
00:15:19,690 --> 00:15:21,740
and I will select the camera rig

328
00:15:21,740 --> 00:15:22,990
and press Control + Tab.

329
00:15:22,990 --> 00:15:27,280
The dolly rig action
should already be assigned

330
00:15:27,280 --> 00:15:28,750
to this armature.

331
00:15:28,750 --> 00:15:30,300
The first thing to do

332
00:15:30,300 --> 00:15:32,950
is to frame our main shot.

333
00:15:32,950 --> 00:15:35,180
I think it's easier to keyframe first

334
00:15:35,180 --> 00:15:39,100
where you want to go
than where you come from.

335
00:15:39,100 --> 00:15:40,450
So I will go on a frame

336
00:15:40,450 --> 00:15:42,108
where I can see my character

337
00:15:42,108 --> 00:15:46,100
and I will lower the aim
controller of the camera

338
00:15:46,100 --> 00:15:48,670
to better listen to the character.

339
00:15:48,670 --> 00:15:52,200
Then I will increase the
focal length of the camera

340
00:15:52,200 --> 00:15:55,760
so that we are a bit more
zoomed onto the main subject

341
00:15:55,760 --> 00:15:57,260
of our animation.

342
00:15:57,260 --> 00:15:59,330
This is going to be my default pose,

343
00:15:59,330 --> 00:16:02,410
so I will move the keyframe on frame zero.

344
00:16:02,410 --> 00:16:04,700
I will then select all those keyframe

345
00:16:04,700 --> 00:16:06,530
and move them away in time.

346
00:16:06,530 --> 00:16:08,860
It doesn't matter where I put them.

347
00:16:08,860 --> 00:16:12,120
So let's now create our first framing

348
00:16:12,120 --> 00:16:15,280
by moving the aim controller of the camera

349
00:16:15,280 --> 00:16:16,910
towards the sky.

350
00:16:16,910 --> 00:16:20,553
I will also slightly move
up the camera controller.

351
00:16:20,553 --> 00:16:23,050
It will just add a bit more texture

352
00:16:23,050 --> 00:16:24,960
to the camera animation.

353
00:16:24,960 --> 00:16:27,300
Just imagine you have the
camera on your shoulder

354
00:16:27,300 --> 00:16:29,710
and you're raising and looking at the sky

355
00:16:29,710 --> 00:16:30,710
at the same time.

356
00:16:30,710 --> 00:16:33,800
So there is a bit of
translation and rotation.

357
00:16:33,800 --> 00:16:36,150
For the time being, this
shot is pretty blurry,

358
00:16:36,150 --> 00:16:38,760
so I will search for the focal distance

359
00:16:38,760 --> 00:16:40,450
and I will increase it's value

360
00:16:40,450 --> 00:16:43,710
until I get a sharper result.

361
00:16:43,710 --> 00:16:46,970
So now we have our camera
going back to the ground.

362
00:16:46,970 --> 00:16:49,530
It will stop here for a few frames,

363
00:16:49,530 --> 00:16:53,210
then have a look to the bush
where our character is hidden

364
00:16:53,210 --> 00:16:55,260
and then follow the character.

365
00:16:55,260 --> 00:16:58,320
So we can select the keys on frame 60

366
00:16:58,320 --> 00:17:01,663
and duplicate them on frame 78 or 80.

367
00:17:02,590 --> 00:17:05,023
So there, I will go on frame 94 or 95

368
00:17:05,023 --> 00:17:07,550
and I will move my end controller

369
00:17:07,550 --> 00:17:09,610
toward the main bush.

370
00:17:09,610 --> 00:17:12,290
Then I will go into the action editor,

371
00:17:12,290 --> 00:17:16,290
press I and insert a keyframe
on every controllers.

372
00:17:16,290 --> 00:17:19,000
The base animation of our camera

373
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:21,510
is now what we need to do

374
00:17:21,510 --> 00:17:26,030
is to synchronize the movement
of our squirrel character

375
00:17:26,030 --> 00:17:28,620
with the current set we have created.

376
00:17:28,620 --> 00:17:30,700
And with the NLA editor,

377
00:17:30,700 --> 00:17:32,180
it's gonna be very easy.

378
00:17:32,180 --> 00:17:33,480
Let's press Control + tab

379
00:17:33,480 --> 00:17:38,083
to get out of pose mode, select
our squirrel character rig

380
00:17:39,080 --> 00:17:41,350
and in the NLA editor,

381
00:17:41,350 --> 00:17:44,400
I just need to select all the strips,

382
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:48,480
press G to offset them onto frame 100.

383
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:51,430
If we uncheck the show
only selected option,

384
00:17:51,430 --> 00:17:54,820
we can see also our camera action.

385
00:17:54,820 --> 00:17:56,750
And if we play our animation,

386
00:17:56,750 --> 00:17:58,880
we can see our camera getting low

387
00:17:58,880 --> 00:18:01,920
and our character jumping out of the bush.

388
00:18:01,920 --> 00:18:05,490
So now let's select back our camera rig

389
00:18:05,490 --> 00:18:06,690
and press Control + Tab

390
00:18:06,690 --> 00:18:08,600
to get back into pose mode.

391
00:18:08,600 --> 00:18:11,400
I will move the last keys for our camera

392
00:18:11,400 --> 00:18:14,110
whenever the camera is framing the bush

393
00:18:15,230 --> 00:18:19,090
by two keys so that I have
a slightly smoother motion

394
00:18:19,090 --> 00:18:21,780
and then I will duplicate those keys

395
00:18:21,780 --> 00:18:24,183
and move them on frame 109.

396
00:18:25,230 --> 00:18:27,490
This is the moment our camera will start

397
00:18:27,490 --> 00:18:30,330
to rotate to follow the character.

398
00:18:30,330 --> 00:18:33,070
So I make sure there is a slight delay

399
00:18:33,070 --> 00:18:36,640
between the time our
character jump out of the bush

400
00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:40,130
and the time our camera
is starting to rotate.

401
00:18:40,130 --> 00:18:41,800
It will look more natural.

402
00:18:41,800 --> 00:18:44,830
Do not make your camera
anticipate the motion

403
00:18:44,830 --> 00:18:46,030
of your character.

404
00:18:46,030 --> 00:18:48,310
That will look fake or CG.

405
00:18:48,310 --> 00:18:51,790
Now we can duplicate
our keys from frame 60,

406
00:18:51,790 --> 00:18:55,320
which are the frames that
are focused on the character

407
00:18:55,320 --> 00:18:57,603
and move them around frame 125.

408
00:18:58,600 --> 00:19:00,770
From there, we need to increase the length

409
00:19:00,770 --> 00:19:02,080
of our animation.

410
00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:06,820
So I will set the end on frame 250.

411
00:19:06,820 --> 00:19:10,820
To do so, position the
playhead on frame 250

412
00:19:10,820 --> 00:19:12,160
and press Control + End.

413
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:17,044
Now I can duplicate
the keys from frame 125

414
00:19:17,044 --> 00:19:19,750
to the frame 203.

415
00:19:19,750 --> 00:19:22,940
This is when our character
is preparing to flee.

416
00:19:22,940 --> 00:19:26,560
And since I want a bit of
delay for the camera reaction,

417
00:19:26,560 --> 00:19:30,970
I will duplicate or
offset those keys on 209.

418
00:19:30,970 --> 00:19:34,509
Now I can move on frame 227

419
00:19:34,509 --> 00:19:37,970
and offset the aim controller

420
00:19:37,970 --> 00:19:39,230
toward the bush on the right

421
00:19:39,230 --> 00:19:42,120
where our character is disappearing.

422
00:19:42,120 --> 00:19:43,900
Now if we check the animation,

423
00:19:43,900 --> 00:19:46,100
we can see that our camera is trying

424
00:19:46,100 --> 00:19:49,230
to follow the character
but we have a bit of delay,

425
00:19:49,230 --> 00:19:51,550
which looks pretty natural.

426
00:19:51,550 --> 00:19:54,570
Now the final touch on
the camera animation

427
00:19:54,570 --> 00:19:57,290
to make it look less robotic

428
00:19:57,290 --> 00:19:59,710
is to add a very slight overshoot

429
00:19:59,710 --> 00:20:01,660
through the graph editor.

430
00:20:01,660 --> 00:20:04,270
I'm not really good at animating cameras

431
00:20:04,270 --> 00:20:05,700
but what I can tell you

432
00:20:05,700 --> 00:20:08,640
is that try to keep your camera motion

433
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:10,800
as simple as possible.

434
00:20:10,800 --> 00:20:12,050
With that being said,

435
00:20:12,050 --> 00:20:14,280
just switch to the graph editor

436
00:20:14,280 --> 00:20:16,737
and with the aim controller selected,

437
00:20:16,737 --> 00:20:20,010
I will expose all the different channels

438
00:20:20,010 --> 00:20:22,330
and hide the rotation channels

439
00:20:22,330 --> 00:20:24,110
since they are not used.

440
00:20:24,110 --> 00:20:25,460
And now what I will do,

441
00:20:25,460 --> 00:20:29,560
whenever a curve hit a
keyframe before a hold,

442
00:20:29,560 --> 00:20:31,880
where the camera is not moving anymore,

443
00:20:31,880 --> 00:20:34,586
I will slightly rotate the handles.

444
00:20:34,586 --> 00:20:37,970
That will create a very subtle overshoot

445
00:20:37,970 --> 00:20:40,030
that will make our camera motion

446
00:20:40,030 --> 00:20:43,400
way more believable and interesting.

447
00:20:43,400 --> 00:20:46,050
From there, we will
just add the final touch

448
00:20:46,050 --> 00:20:48,970
to our animation, making the bush move

449
00:20:48,970 --> 00:20:51,330
and adding some particles.

450
00:20:51,330 --> 00:20:53,750
So I will make myself a bit of room

451
00:20:53,750 --> 00:20:55,310
in the different editor.

452
00:20:55,310 --> 00:20:57,060
Get back to pose mode

453
00:20:57,060 --> 00:21:00,800
and select the bush our
character is jumping from.

454
00:21:00,800 --> 00:21:03,300
I will position the playhead more or less

455
00:21:03,300 --> 00:21:06,640
just before the camera is
rotating toward the bush.

456
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:08,470
And with the bush selected,

457
00:21:08,470 --> 00:21:11,980
I will insert a keyframe on its rotations.

458
00:21:11,980 --> 00:21:14,530
From there, I can switch
to the action editor.

459
00:21:14,530 --> 00:21:17,830
We don't need to use the
graph editor for this.

460
00:21:17,830 --> 00:21:19,610
And to make the bush shake,

461
00:21:19,610 --> 00:21:22,080
I will go just two frame later,

462
00:21:22,080 --> 00:21:24,960
slightly rotate it on the left.

463
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:27,200
Go two or three frame later,

464
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:29,468
slightly rotate it on the right.

465
00:21:29,468 --> 00:21:32,750
Repeat it two or three time

466
00:21:32,750 --> 00:21:36,460
and finished with its original keyframe

467
00:21:36,460 --> 00:21:40,560
by simply duplicating the
first keyframe we have set.

468
00:21:40,560 --> 00:21:42,390
I will then offset those keys,

469
00:21:42,390 --> 00:21:45,930
create a hold by duplicating the last key

470
00:21:45,930 --> 00:21:49,420
and move it whenever the
character is jumping out

471
00:21:49,420 --> 00:21:50,253
of the bush.

472
00:21:50,253 --> 00:21:52,210
And I will repeat the process,

473
00:21:52,210 --> 00:21:53,800
making a slight shake

474
00:21:53,800 --> 00:21:56,320
whenever he's getting through the bush.

475
00:21:56,320 --> 00:21:58,950
From there, I will just
offset the first group

476
00:21:58,950 --> 00:22:02,030
of keys just before the camera is rotating

477
00:22:02,030 --> 00:22:03,300
toward the bush.

478
00:22:03,300 --> 00:22:05,780
The bush shakes, the camera turn.

479
00:22:05,780 --> 00:22:08,730
Now we need to adjust the particles.

480
00:22:08,730 --> 00:22:12,290
In object mode, go into
the particle collection,

481
00:22:12,290 --> 00:22:14,470
select the bush emitter.

482
00:22:14,470 --> 00:22:17,050
Our character is jumping out of the bush

483
00:22:17,050 --> 00:22:19,290
on frame 104.

484
00:22:19,290 --> 00:22:23,310
Knowing that, let's go
into the properties editor,

485
00:22:23,310 --> 00:22:25,940
select the particles property

486
00:22:25,940 --> 00:22:28,120
and under the Emission tab,

487
00:22:28,120 --> 00:22:31,323
change the start and end value to 102,

488
00:22:32,270 --> 00:22:35,630
two frames prior our
character is jumping out

489
00:22:35,630 --> 00:22:36,810
of the bush.

490
00:22:36,810 --> 00:22:41,100
It's basically a simply plane
emitting leaves particles.

491
00:22:41,100 --> 00:22:44,530
So you can adjust its position if you want

492
00:22:44,530 --> 00:22:47,060
and I've just shown you how to modify

493
00:22:47,060 --> 00:22:49,520
when it emits the particles.

494
00:22:49,520 --> 00:22:50,570
I won't go further

495
00:22:50,570 --> 00:22:53,210
because this is not a
course about particles

496
00:22:53,210 --> 00:22:57,420
and particle system could
require a full course.

497
00:22:57,420 --> 00:22:59,530
When you're happy with your particles,

498
00:22:59,530 --> 00:23:03,180
if you want to make sure that
they will render properly,

499
00:23:03,180 --> 00:23:05,320
go to the Cache tab,

500
00:23:05,320 --> 00:23:08,120
check the Disk Cache option,

501
00:23:08,120 --> 00:23:10,320
and whether click the Bake button

502
00:23:10,320 --> 00:23:14,490
or Bake All Dynamics, it will
bake all the particle system

503
00:23:14,490 --> 00:23:15,323
in the scene.

504
00:23:15,323 --> 00:23:17,800
If you need to tweak the particle setting,

505
00:23:17,800 --> 00:23:19,440
just delete the bake

506
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:22,850
and bake again after you
have tweaked your settings.

507
00:23:22,850 --> 00:23:26,060
If you want to adjust
the birds in the sky,

508
00:23:26,060 --> 00:23:27,708
it's the same system.

509
00:23:27,708 --> 00:23:29,560
Just unzoom a bit

510
00:23:29,560 --> 00:23:31,770
and you will find a particle emitter

511
00:23:31,770 --> 00:23:34,100
for the birds or you
can select it directly

512
00:23:34,100 --> 00:23:35,920
into the collections.

513
00:23:35,920 --> 00:23:39,590
Then you can offset the
start and end values,

514
00:23:39,590 --> 00:23:41,360
even before frame zero

515
00:23:41,360 --> 00:23:44,270
so that those birds will be emitted

516
00:23:44,270 --> 00:23:46,350
before the animation start

517
00:23:46,350 --> 00:23:49,350
and they will be in frame on frame zero.

518
00:23:49,350 --> 00:23:53,630
So for this current shot,
a value of -64 and 0

519
00:23:53,630 --> 00:23:55,530
is currently good.

520
00:23:55,530 --> 00:23:56,610
And when you're done,

521
00:23:56,610 --> 00:23:59,143
don't forget to bake the dynamics.
