00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:02,540
- [Pierre] Now that we
have a better understanding

2
00:00:02,540 --> 00:00:06,280
of object transformation,
let's start animating.

3
00:00:06,280 --> 00:00:08,890
We will work on the classic bouncing ball.

4
00:00:08,890 --> 00:00:12,870
Since I'd like to be able to
squash and stretch the ball

5
00:00:12,870 --> 00:00:14,557
during the animation,

6
00:00:14,557 --> 00:00:19,557
using its very center as a
pivot point is not ideal.

7
00:00:19,970 --> 00:00:24,100
What I'd like to do instead
is adding its origin point

8
00:00:24,100 --> 00:00:26,230
on the base of the ball

9
00:00:26,230 --> 00:00:29,880
as this is going to be the
contacting point of the ball

10
00:00:29,880 --> 00:00:32,320
with our imaginary ground.

11
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:34,880
So I will simply enter edit mode,

12
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:39,880
select every vertices
and press G, Z, and one

13
00:00:40,130 --> 00:00:43,940
to move everything off
one meter on the Z axis.

14
00:00:43,940 --> 00:00:45,980
When they get back into object mode,

15
00:00:45,980 --> 00:00:48,130
I still have the same sphere,

16
00:00:48,130 --> 00:00:51,600
but its origin is now on its place.

17
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:54,390
By default, the timeline in Blender

18
00:00:54,390 --> 00:00:56,350
is in the bottom of the screen.

19
00:00:56,350 --> 00:00:57,890
When you press space,

20
00:00:57,890 --> 00:01:01,120
you can see that we are
playing an animation,

21
00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:05,030
meaning that blender is going
through the different frame

22
00:01:05,030 --> 00:01:06,400
of the document.

23
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:10,290
The play head in the
timeline indicate which frame

24
00:01:10,290 --> 00:01:12,220
you are currently reading.

25
00:01:12,220 --> 00:01:15,000
We can change the length of the animation

26
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:18,700
by setting the end frame
and the beginning frame.

27
00:01:18,700 --> 00:01:21,420
I will set the beginning frame to zero

28
00:01:21,420 --> 00:01:23,560
and end frame to 24.

29
00:01:23,560 --> 00:01:25,170
When I press play,

30
00:01:25,170 --> 00:01:29,280
we can see the play head
moving till frame 24

31
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:31,680
and getting back to frame zero.

32
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:34,260
This value indicates
you in the current frame

33
00:01:34,260 --> 00:01:37,940
that is also alight on
top of the play head.

34
00:01:37,940 --> 00:01:41,400
Animation in Blender
is basically recording

35
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:46,050
a different transformation
to an object in time,

36
00:01:46,050 --> 00:01:48,380
meaning that we can recall the location,

37
00:01:48,380 --> 00:01:52,410
rotation or scale of an
object on different frames.

38
00:01:52,410 --> 00:01:54,190
To insert a key frame,

39
00:01:54,190 --> 00:01:58,610
we simply need to have our
object selected in space

40
00:01:58,610 --> 00:02:00,500
and press the I key.

41
00:02:00,500 --> 00:02:02,810
A menu will pop up asking you

42
00:02:02,810 --> 00:02:05,520
which kind of key frame you want to write.

43
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:08,790
Basically, do you want
to recall the location,

44
00:02:08,790 --> 00:02:11,480
the rotation, the scale of the object

45
00:02:11,480 --> 00:02:13,610
or a combination of those?

46
00:02:13,610 --> 00:02:15,610
When I select location,

47
00:02:15,610 --> 00:02:19,740
we can see that in the
transform channel of my object,

48
00:02:19,740 --> 00:02:22,490
the location input turn to yellow.

49
00:02:22,490 --> 00:02:27,160
And on the timeline, I get
a little yellow indicator

50
00:02:27,160 --> 00:02:30,810
that tells me we have
recorded a key frame.

51
00:02:30,810 --> 00:02:34,800
The key frame is a simple
registered value in time.

52
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:39,570
In our case, we have registered
or recorded the location

53
00:02:39,570 --> 00:02:42,740
of our object on frame zero.

54
00:02:42,740 --> 00:02:45,220
I will place to play head on frame 10

55
00:02:45,220 --> 00:02:50,220
and move my object higher and
insert a location key frame.

56
00:02:50,420 --> 00:02:53,820
Now I can see a new key
frame on my timeline,

57
00:02:53,820 --> 00:02:58,170
and as soon as I move the
play head from left to right,

58
00:02:58,170 --> 00:03:02,720
I can see sphere moving
from its previous position

59
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:06,770
on frame zero, to the next
position we have key framed

60
00:03:06,770 --> 00:03:07,990
on frame 10.

61
00:03:07,990 --> 00:03:11,920
We have recorded two position
on two different frame

62
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:16,280
and what we are seeing now
is Blender interpolating

63
00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:18,910
or creating an interpolation

64
00:03:18,910 --> 00:03:22,310
between those two position in space.

65
00:03:22,310 --> 00:03:26,160
key frames can be manipulated
in the timeline as objects,

66
00:03:26,160 --> 00:03:28,550
so you can move them using G,

67
00:03:28,550 --> 00:03:31,580
you can press Shift + D to duplicate them.

68
00:03:31,580 --> 00:03:35,330
You can box select them,
press X to delete them.

69
00:03:35,330 --> 00:03:38,520
You can insert a new key
frame by simply hovering over

70
00:03:39,370 --> 00:03:42,290
a transformed channel and pressing I

71
00:03:42,290 --> 00:03:46,780
or right-clicking and choose
between insert key frame

72
00:03:46,780 --> 00:03:49,370
or insert single key frame

73
00:03:49,370 --> 00:03:51,910
if you just want to add a key frame

74
00:03:51,910 --> 00:03:54,600
on the X location, for example.

75
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:56,850
Right clicking will also hollow you

76
00:03:56,850 --> 00:04:01,010
to delete all the key frames
from the selected channel

77
00:04:01,010 --> 00:04:04,560
or choose delete only single key frame

78
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:08,440
to delete a specific X, Y, or Z channel.

79
00:04:08,440 --> 00:04:11,420
So let's start our exercise on frame zero

80
00:04:11,420 --> 00:04:13,640
and insert a key frame.

81
00:04:13,640 --> 00:04:16,570
Let's moved the play head to frame 12

82
00:04:16,570 --> 00:04:21,370
and then move our sphere
or ball on the Z axis

83
00:04:21,370 --> 00:04:23,620
by eight meters.

84
00:04:23,620 --> 00:04:27,590
We can see that our transformed
channels have changed color.

85
00:04:27,590 --> 00:04:30,380
The X and Y are still on green,

86
00:04:30,380 --> 00:04:34,420
meaning that they have
been key framed previously

87
00:04:34,420 --> 00:04:37,310
and their values haven't changed.

88
00:04:37,310 --> 00:04:41,160
And the Z key frame as turned to orange,

89
00:04:41,160 --> 00:04:45,780
meaning that we have
transformed the Z value,

90
00:04:45,780 --> 00:04:47,970
but it's not recorded yet.

91
00:04:47,970 --> 00:04:49,520
And this is a big warning,

92
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:52,300
because as soon as I
will move the play head,

93
00:04:52,300 --> 00:04:56,780
my ball will return to its
first key frame position,

94
00:04:56,780 --> 00:04:59,860
meaning that I have lost
the Z transformation

95
00:04:59,860 --> 00:05:04,110
I've performed on frame 12
because I haven't recorded it.

96
00:05:04,110 --> 00:05:06,070
So I will jump back to frame 12,

97
00:05:06,070 --> 00:05:09,050
move my sphere of eight meters

98
00:05:09,050 --> 00:05:12,040
and then press I to insert a key frame.

99
00:05:12,040 --> 00:05:15,350
If I now scrub through
frame zero to frame 12,

100
00:05:15,350 --> 00:05:17,730
I can see the ball rising in the air.

101
00:05:17,730 --> 00:05:20,680
So transformed channels
are colored in yellow

102
00:05:20,680 --> 00:05:23,470
whenever I'm hitting a key frame

103
00:05:23,470 --> 00:05:26,710
and they are green whenever I'm in between

104
00:05:26,710 --> 00:05:28,700
or during an interpolation.

105
00:05:28,700 --> 00:05:30,640
I can select the first key frame,

106
00:05:30,640 --> 00:05:34,920
press Shift + D and move
it onto the very last frame

107
00:05:34,920 --> 00:05:37,570
so that I have a looping action.

108
00:05:37,570 --> 00:05:40,440
To create a loop you just
have to make your first

109
00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:43,070
and last frames being the same.

110
00:05:43,070 --> 00:05:45,410
You can move from frame to frame

111
00:05:45,410 --> 00:05:48,580
by pressing the left and right arrow.

112
00:05:48,580 --> 00:05:51,810
Whenever you will press
the up and down arrow,

113
00:05:51,810 --> 00:05:56,000
you will jump from the
previous to the next key frame.

114
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,970
Pressing Shift + right and Shift + left

115
00:05:58,970 --> 00:06:03,070
will bring you to the very last
of the very first key frame.

116
00:06:03,070 --> 00:06:06,670
You can perform all those
play head manipulation

117
00:06:06,670 --> 00:06:10,320
using the UI in the
header of the timeline.

118
00:06:10,320 --> 00:06:12,060
As we have seen before,

119
00:06:12,060 --> 00:06:15,060
anytime while I'm moving
our object somewhere,

120
00:06:15,060 --> 00:06:17,160
we need to insert a key frame

121
00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:20,270
or we will lose the
manipulation we have done.

122
00:06:20,270 --> 00:06:22,980
While it might be okay to press I

123
00:06:22,980 --> 00:06:25,950
each time we perform a manual manipulation

124
00:06:25,950 --> 00:06:28,100
on the single bouncing ball,

125
00:06:28,100 --> 00:06:31,100
when you will start
animating a full character

126
00:06:31,100 --> 00:06:35,310
with thousands of controls,
that's gonna be very tedious.

127
00:06:35,310 --> 00:06:39,460
Fortunately, there is
the record button here

128
00:06:39,460 --> 00:06:43,630
that allow us to auto
key any transformation.

129
00:06:43,630 --> 00:06:45,220
As soon as I move the sphere,

130
00:06:45,220 --> 00:06:49,020
you can see that new
keys are being recorded

131
00:06:49,020 --> 00:06:51,747
for every channel of
this fear automatically.

132
00:06:51,747 --> 00:06:54,540
Not that whenever you
are using this option

133
00:06:54,540 --> 00:06:56,750
and moving your object in space,

134
00:06:56,750 --> 00:07:00,110
you are warned that there
is an auto keying going on

135
00:07:00,110 --> 00:07:03,090
on the top right corner
of your (indistinct)

136
00:07:03,090 --> 00:07:04,740
As explained in the beginning,

137
00:07:04,740 --> 00:07:09,460
we can keep frame mostly every
kind of value in Blender,

138
00:07:09,460 --> 00:07:11,450
and it can be a color.

139
00:07:11,450 --> 00:07:14,970
If I select the material
preview of my sphere

140
00:07:14,970 --> 00:07:18,060
and I click this little rounded icon,

141
00:07:18,060 --> 00:07:21,870
it will add a key frame
on the color value.

142
00:07:21,870 --> 00:07:24,520
And I can find this key
frame on the timeline.

143
00:07:24,520 --> 00:07:27,840
If I go a little further
now and change the color,

144
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:29,843
since the auto keying is on,

145
00:07:29,843 --> 00:07:33,690
it will insert a new key
frame of this new color.

146
00:07:33,690 --> 00:07:36,700
And whenever I scrub through the timeline,

147
00:07:36,700 --> 00:07:40,483
I can see the color
interpolation of the sphere.

148
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:46,800
To summarize, we have seen
that we can use the timeline

149
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:49,520
to navigate through the different frames.

150
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:52,330
We have seen that we
can create a key frame

151
00:07:52,330 --> 00:07:56,560
by recording any value, whether
it's a transformed channel,

152
00:07:56,560 --> 00:08:00,010
a color or whatever we
want onto a specific frame.

153
00:08:00,010 --> 00:08:03,490
Blender will automatically
create an interpolation

154
00:08:03,490 --> 00:08:05,200
between two key frames.

155
00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:08,420
Key framed values appear in yellow,

156
00:08:08,420 --> 00:08:11,050
animated values appear in green

157
00:08:11,050 --> 00:08:15,380
unrecording value changes
are shown in orange

158
00:08:15,380 --> 00:08:18,353
and gray value are just unanimated values.
