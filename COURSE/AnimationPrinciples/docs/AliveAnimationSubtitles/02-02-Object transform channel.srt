00:00:00,450 --> 00:00:01,600
- [Man] The previous video,

2
00:00:01,600 --> 00:00:03,800
we have seen that object transform

3
00:00:03,800 --> 00:00:06,720
is based on its pivot point.

4
00:00:06,720 --> 00:00:10,220
Now let's see what we are
currently transforming.

5
00:00:10,220 --> 00:00:13,020
As a Blender user and a 3D artist,

6
00:00:13,020 --> 00:00:18,020
you know that in space we are
using the x-, y-, and z-axis

7
00:00:18,680 --> 00:00:20,720
to move our objects.

8
00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:24,810
We can find the representation
of those axes on the grid

9
00:00:24,810 --> 00:00:29,810
with the x- and y-axes being
those red and green lines.

10
00:00:29,960 --> 00:00:33,970
And also on the view widget
on the top right corner,

11
00:00:33,970 --> 00:00:37,110
that allow us to switch
to the different views.

12
00:00:37,110 --> 00:00:39,750
When an object is not transformed,

13
00:00:39,750 --> 00:00:43,090
its position is aligned
with the world origin.

14
00:00:43,090 --> 00:00:47,950
As soon as we input some
values into its x-coordinate,

15
00:00:47,950 --> 00:00:52,950
for example, it will slide,
moving along the x-ward axis,

16
00:00:53,700 --> 00:00:55,740
and it will behave the same whether

17
00:00:55,740 --> 00:00:58,900
we are playing with the y or z value.

18
00:00:58,900 --> 00:01:01,500
There is no limitation to those value,

19
00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:04,090
they can be positive or negative,

20
00:01:04,090 --> 00:01:07,870
and our object will move
left, right, up, and down,

21
00:01:07,870 --> 00:01:10,790
or front and back, depending on those.

22
00:01:10,790 --> 00:01:15,060
If I enter a value of
one and one on x and z,

23
00:01:15,060 --> 00:01:20,060
we can see our object offset
from the center of our scene.

24
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:22,730
When it comes to rotation,

25
00:01:22,730 --> 00:01:26,820
we don't rotate along an
axis, but around an axis.

26
00:01:26,820 --> 00:01:29,960
If I rotate around the x-axis,

27
00:01:29,960 --> 00:01:32,860
I can see my x rotation value changing,

28
00:01:32,860 --> 00:01:37,860
and my object is currently
rotating around the red arrow.

29
00:01:38,050 --> 00:01:41,340
And as always, the origin of the object

30
00:01:41,340 --> 00:01:45,300
is used as the origin of the rotation.

31
00:01:45,300 --> 00:01:47,266
If you have difficulties understanding

32
00:01:47,266 --> 00:01:50,620
on which axis you are going to rotate,

33
00:01:50,620 --> 00:01:53,470
you can activate the rotation gizmo

34
00:01:53,470 --> 00:01:55,680
that make it more obvious.

35
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:59,240
If I now perform a scanning pressing S

36
00:01:59,240 --> 00:02:03,430
and concentrate it on
the x-axis pressing x,

37
00:02:03,430 --> 00:02:06,400
you can see that I'm scaling my object

38
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:08,500
along the selected axis.

39
00:02:08,500 --> 00:02:12,190
The same on the y-axis
here or on the z-axis.

40
00:02:12,190 --> 00:02:16,230
So, scaling is along the object axis.

41
00:02:16,230 --> 00:02:20,330
One last option that
is available for object

42
00:02:20,330 --> 00:02:22,050
is delta transform.

43
00:02:22,050 --> 00:02:24,830
When I go into the object properties,

44
00:02:24,830 --> 00:02:28,160
I can see this delta transform panel

45
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:31,110
that looks like the
classic transform panel.

46
00:02:31,110 --> 00:02:35,470
Delta transforms behave
the same way as transform,

47
00:02:35,470 --> 00:02:39,800
but they are added on top
of your transformation.

48
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:43,470
So you can see here, when
I add the delta transform

49
00:02:43,470 --> 00:02:48,410
of one and one on top of my
one and one classic transform,

50
00:02:48,410 --> 00:02:53,410
my object is offset to the
position two on x and two on z.

51
00:02:54,690 --> 00:02:59,420
To be honest, I almost never
use the delta transform,

52
00:02:59,420 --> 00:03:03,690
and I don't think we will be
using it during this course.

53
00:03:03,690 --> 00:03:06,670
It can be useful whenever
you want to offset

54
00:03:06,670 --> 00:03:10,930
an existing object animation, for example.

55
00:03:10,930 --> 00:03:14,000
Let's say you have animate
an up and down motion

56
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:17,740
and you want to easily
offset it on the side.

57
00:03:17,740 --> 00:03:21,160
Using the delta transform
will make your life easier.

58
00:03:21,160 --> 00:03:23,270
But there are other way to do it,

59
00:03:23,270 --> 00:03:26,040
and we will see that during the course.

60
00:03:26,040 --> 00:03:29,540
To summarize, we have seen
that location, transformation,

61
00:03:29,540 --> 00:03:32,780
and scaling are done along the axis,

62
00:03:32,780 --> 00:03:37,030
while rotation is done around the axis,

63
00:03:37,030 --> 00:03:41,503
and we can offset an animation
using delta transform.
