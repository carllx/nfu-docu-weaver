00:00:00,540 --> 00:00:02,970
- [Instructor] The first
pose we've been working on

2
00:00:02,970 --> 00:00:06,510
was a static pose or a balanced pose.

3
00:00:06,510 --> 00:00:10,520
In this new video I like
to tackle motion poses

4
00:00:10,520 --> 00:00:14,780
and we will try to push it
to an extreme using smears

5
00:00:14,780 --> 00:00:16,510
and rebel limbs.

6
00:00:16,510 --> 00:00:20,390
So the first thing you need
to do and I truly advise you

7
00:00:20,390 --> 00:00:24,860
to do it whatever your
animation level is to identify

8
00:00:24,860 --> 00:00:26,960
the line of action on the pose.

9
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:29,800
Even if it seems very
obvious on this picture,

10
00:00:29,800 --> 00:00:32,610
drawing this line will help
you whenever you are going

11
00:00:32,610 --> 00:00:35,670
to build your pose
because it will be written

12
00:00:35,670 --> 00:00:37,070
in your subconscious.

13
00:00:37,070 --> 00:00:41,120
I know it is I'm the first to
rush into posing my character

14
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:44,830
whenever I'm starting a new
animation and this is not

15
00:00:44,830 --> 00:00:46,670
the right way to do it.

16
00:00:46,670 --> 00:00:51,110
But what I'm sure is that
whenever I do this work prior

17
00:00:51,110 --> 00:00:54,990
to start posing my character,
I generally get a better

18
00:00:54,990 --> 00:00:55,823
result.

19
00:00:55,823 --> 00:00:59,590
Second thing I do is to
define the lines of interests.

20
00:00:59,590 --> 00:01:03,420
In this case, we have a nice
angle with the right leg,

21
00:01:03,420 --> 00:01:07,840
the left arm, and the overall
shape made by the connection

22
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:10,740
between the two arms and the baseball bat.

23
00:01:10,740 --> 00:01:15,160
Then as in the previous video,
I will define the orientation

24
00:01:15,160 --> 00:01:18,270
of the face, the torso, and
the hips of the character

25
00:01:18,270 --> 00:01:21,730
by drawing lines on top of the character.

26
00:01:21,730 --> 00:01:26,310
Again, this will really
improve my posing process

27
00:01:26,310 --> 00:01:29,700
helping me reading the current
pose and the orientation

28
00:01:29,700 --> 00:01:32,300
of the different features of the body.

29
00:01:32,300 --> 00:01:34,830
So I will open my previous file,

30
00:01:34,830 --> 00:01:38,520
I will duplicate the current
action and I will rename

31
00:01:38,520 --> 00:01:40,230
it, pose number two,

32
00:01:40,230 --> 00:01:44,240
I will get rid of all the key
frame on frame number two,

33
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:47,580
and then I will go on frame
zero, enter pose mode,

34
00:01:47,580 --> 00:01:52,120
select all my controllers
and press Alt+R, Alt+G,

35
00:01:52,120 --> 00:01:56,750
Alt+S to reset the
rotation scale and location

36
00:01:56,750 --> 00:01:58,410
of all the controllers.

37
00:01:58,410 --> 00:02:02,370
From there in the 2D editor,
I will open the new reference

38
00:02:02,370 --> 00:02:03,230
picture.

39
00:02:03,230 --> 00:02:07,320
Since this new picture is
not framed as the other,

40
00:02:07,320 --> 00:02:09,310
we need to rework our camera,

41
00:02:09,310 --> 00:02:14,030
the current camera as an
horizontal format while the new one

42
00:02:14,030 --> 00:02:17,160
needs to be into a vertical format.

43
00:02:17,160 --> 00:02:20,000
To change the format ratio of the camera

44
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:23,530
we need to go into our output properties,

45
00:02:23,530 --> 00:02:26,530
scroll up till you reach the dimension tab

46
00:02:26,530 --> 00:02:31,530
and replace the resolution
X by 1080 and Y by 1920.

47
00:02:32,660 --> 00:02:35,950
From there, I will make
sure that I'm in object mode

48
00:02:35,950 --> 00:02:40,520
and I will click on the outer
edge of the camera frame,

49
00:02:40,520 --> 00:02:44,320
this will select the camera
and I can roughly reposition

50
00:02:44,320 --> 00:02:47,200
it using our two rotating G to move.

51
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:50,750
Since the reference picture
has probably been taken

52
00:02:50,750 --> 00:02:55,310
from afar, I will increase
the focal length to 60,

53
00:02:55,310 --> 00:02:59,050
I guess a focal length of
80 or 90 would be better,

54
00:02:59,050 --> 00:03:02,040
but for the time being
we will stick to these.

55
00:03:02,040 --> 00:03:04,830
While our character has no baseball bat,

56
00:03:04,830 --> 00:03:07,170
he's equipped with some weapons.

57
00:03:07,170 --> 00:03:11,520
We can go towards the
visibility properties and enable

58
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:14,170
the two ended sword or long sword.

59
00:03:14,170 --> 00:03:16,990
We can continue these as these
are some bad-ass baseball

60
00:03:16,990 --> 00:03:21,270
bat and we now need to
enable it's rig layer.

61
00:03:21,270 --> 00:03:25,140
By default these two ended
sword is parented to the right

62
00:03:25,140 --> 00:03:29,160
hand, meaning that it will
follow any motion or movement

63
00:03:29,160 --> 00:03:30,370
of the right hand.

64
00:03:30,370 --> 00:03:33,370
If we head over the
weapons properties tab,

65
00:03:33,370 --> 00:03:37,470
we can change the parenting
of the sword or of any

66
00:03:37,470 --> 00:03:39,400
of the weapons of the character.

67
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:42,910
Changing the parent will
whether parent it to the right

68
00:03:42,910 --> 00:03:46,800
hand, left hand, or give it no
parent so that we can move it

69
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:50,320
freely inward space where
we can definitely pose

70
00:03:50,320 --> 00:03:54,010
our character using forward
kinematics for the arms.

71
00:03:54,010 --> 00:03:56,180
Whenever we are manipulating an object,

72
00:03:56,180 --> 00:03:58,860
we've both and in contact with it,

73
00:03:58,860 --> 00:04:03,780
it's easier to have at least
one or both end set to inverse

74
00:04:03,780 --> 00:04:04,850
kinematic.

75
00:04:04,850 --> 00:04:08,490
So in the arm properties
panel, I will set the arm

76
00:04:08,490 --> 00:04:13,490
fkik.l and .r to one so
that we switch to arm

77
00:04:13,830 --> 00:04:16,140
inverse kinematic controllers.

78
00:04:16,140 --> 00:04:19,790
From there, we can enable
the arm inverse kinematic

79
00:04:19,790 --> 00:04:24,790
controllers layer and hide
the arm forward kinematically.

80
00:04:24,900 --> 00:04:28,970
From there we can pose the
arm of our character by simply

81
00:04:28,970 --> 00:04:32,090
selecting the end controller and moving it

82
00:04:32,090 --> 00:04:36,710
and adjust the elbow orientation
using the pole target

83
00:04:36,710 --> 00:04:39,160
exactly as we did with the feet.

84
00:04:39,160 --> 00:04:42,850
There are a lot of animators
that prefer to use inverse

85
00:04:42,850 --> 00:04:45,370
kinematic all the way from their arms.

86
00:04:45,370 --> 00:04:49,970
I personally prefer forward
kinematic to build nice arcs,

87
00:04:49,970 --> 00:04:53,510
but whenever I have
contacting pose with the hands

88
00:04:54,834 --> 00:04:58,640
on the wall, on the ground,
or on an object like that,

89
00:04:58,640 --> 00:05:01,400
I generally switch to inverse kinematic.

90
00:05:01,400 --> 00:05:05,450
The first thing I will do is
press control tab to jump back

91
00:05:05,450 --> 00:05:09,870
into object mode and I will
select the camera and hide it,

92
00:05:09,870 --> 00:05:13,620
this way I can start working
in front orthographical view

93
00:05:13,620 --> 00:05:16,480
without having the camera
object in the middle

94
00:05:16,480 --> 00:05:17,430
of the screen.

95
00:05:17,430 --> 00:05:21,090
As usual, I can always
start posing my character

96
00:05:21,090 --> 00:05:25,170
with the center of gravity
or torso root controller.

97
00:05:25,170 --> 00:05:27,730
As we have looped to
the reference picture,

98
00:05:27,730 --> 00:05:32,720
our goal is to figure out
where the torso is pointing at.

99
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:37,000
Once I get a very basic
ID of my torso pose

100
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,920
we can pose the feet,
they are very important

101
00:05:39,920 --> 00:05:43,530
since they are supporting
the weight of our character,

102
00:05:43,530 --> 00:05:47,820
they will define its
balance and the orientation

103
00:05:47,820 --> 00:05:48,830
of the hips.

104
00:05:48,830 --> 00:05:51,910
When posing the feet, if you
have to rotate them forward

105
00:05:51,910 --> 00:05:55,740
or backward, I advise you
to favorize the foot roll

106
00:05:55,740 --> 00:05:59,360
controller, it has a pretty
natural behavior regarding

107
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:02,530
the posing of the character
and when animating it

108
00:06:02,530 --> 00:06:05,710
it's easier than rotating
the feet and compensating

109
00:06:05,710 --> 00:06:06,630
any contact.

110
00:06:06,630 --> 00:06:10,180
Don't forget to pose the
toes of the character.

111
00:06:10,180 --> 00:06:13,120
And before you focus on the whole leg,

112
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:17,770
just focus on the feet
orientation of the reference.

113
00:06:17,770 --> 00:06:22,070
For the time being I'm just
roughly posing each controller

114
00:06:22,070 --> 00:06:25,760
as seen in the previous
video you can hardly get

115
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:30,310
to the right pose or the right
position of each controller

116
00:06:30,310 --> 00:06:35,170
in one shot, you need to refine
the pose of each controller

117
00:06:35,170 --> 00:06:38,850
by going back and forth on
each of them one by one.

118
00:06:38,850 --> 00:06:42,470
With the feet controllers
and the leg I can pose,

119
00:06:42,470 --> 00:06:46,410
roughly post, I can go
ahead and work a bit more

120
00:06:46,410 --> 00:06:48,730
onto the torso of the character.

121
00:06:48,730 --> 00:06:52,820
I need to twist the torso even
more, twist a bit the chest

122
00:06:52,820 --> 00:06:56,130
controller, make it lean to the side,

123
00:06:56,130 --> 00:06:58,920
basically push the pose a little more.

124
00:06:58,920 --> 00:07:02,420
Then I'm watching the head
orientation of the reference

125
00:07:02,420 --> 00:07:06,020
picture and I'm trying too
match, rotating the neck

126
00:07:06,020 --> 00:07:08,890
controller will offset the
head and then I can change

127
00:07:08,890 --> 00:07:11,900
the orientation on the head
using the head controller.

128
00:07:11,900 --> 00:07:15,270
As usual the shoulder are very
important because they will

129
00:07:15,270 --> 00:07:19,690
shape the chest and the overall
silhouette of the character,

130
00:07:19,690 --> 00:07:23,314
but they will also change
the behavior of the arms

131
00:07:23,314 --> 00:07:26,500
especially when using inverse kinematic.

132
00:07:26,500 --> 00:07:29,710
But before I even try
to refine the shoulders

133
00:07:29,710 --> 00:07:32,650
I will position the
hands of the character.

134
00:07:32,650 --> 00:07:36,280
You watch carefully the
reference, the right hand palm

135
00:07:36,280 --> 00:07:41,280
is pointing up while the left
hand home is pointing down.

136
00:07:41,530 --> 00:07:45,430
So I need to rotate the
right hand accordingly,

137
00:07:45,430 --> 00:07:48,800
then I will position it
in front of the character

138
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:51,440
and roughly both in space.

139
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:55,010
Once I have a rough
pose for the right hand,

140
00:07:55,010 --> 00:07:59,170
I will pose the left hand
and position it on the handle

141
00:07:59,170 --> 00:08:00,060
of the sword.

142
00:08:00,060 --> 00:08:04,460
Here you can see we have a
lot of tension into our arm,

143
00:08:04,460 --> 00:08:08,350
and this is because we haven't
posed the shoulder yet.

144
00:08:08,350 --> 00:08:13,070
We need to rotate the shoulder
inward to loosen the arm

145
00:08:13,070 --> 00:08:16,260
and get a nice angle with the elbow.

146
00:08:16,260 --> 00:08:20,380
Watch out for this nice
and smooth C-shape boat

147
00:08:20,380 --> 00:08:22,060
by the shoulder line.

148
00:08:22,060 --> 00:08:24,340
Whenever you are posing the elbow,

149
00:08:24,340 --> 00:08:27,100
double check their position in space,

150
00:08:27,100 --> 00:08:30,100
be aware whenever you are posing,

151
00:08:30,100 --> 00:08:33,600
don't try to guess, just
watch the reference.

152
00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:37,860
The left elbow is pointing to
the sky making a nice angle

153
00:08:37,860 --> 00:08:42,190
with the shoulder while the
right elbow is pushed toward

154
00:08:42,190 --> 00:08:43,670
the chest of the character.

155
00:08:43,670 --> 00:08:47,430
A common mistake you need to
absolutely avoid is trying

156
00:08:47,430 --> 00:08:52,150
to reach any weapon pose using
only the hand controller,

157
00:08:52,150 --> 00:08:57,070
your hand have a pretty
limited range of rotation.

158
00:08:57,070 --> 00:09:00,810
So you can't break the wrist
to orientate the plate,

159
00:09:00,810 --> 00:09:04,570
but whenever you are manipulating
and object in your hand,

160
00:09:04,570 --> 00:09:08,570
the way you move your finger
you open your palm or not

161
00:09:08,570 --> 00:09:11,010
will change the orientation of the object.

162
00:09:11,010 --> 00:09:15,930
So please move the object
using the object controller.

163
00:09:15,930 --> 00:09:19,360
Getting back on to our
pose we can see that both

164
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:21,730
end are very close one to the other,

165
00:09:21,730 --> 00:09:25,870
so I fix that and now I'm
rotating the shoulder so that

166
00:09:25,870 --> 00:09:30,400
I can reach the same range
of motion or range of pose

167
00:09:30,400 --> 00:09:31,790
as on the reference.

168
00:09:31,790 --> 00:09:35,810
When I pose the hand, again
I try not to break the wrist

169
00:09:35,810 --> 00:09:39,360
too much and if I need to
compensate the rotation

170
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:43,210
of the sword I will do it
using the sword controller.

171
00:09:43,210 --> 00:09:47,690
Now that I have a roughly
posed both hand and I want

172
00:09:47,690 --> 00:09:51,600
to move both of them or change
the orientation of the sword

173
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:56,500
at hands, I'm using the active
controller as the rotation

174
00:09:56,500 --> 00:09:58,930
point or pivot points.

175
00:09:58,930 --> 00:10:01,890
This way I can select
both hand controller,

176
00:10:01,890 --> 00:10:05,770
make sure that I select last
or make active the right hand

177
00:10:05,770 --> 00:10:10,770
controller, this way both end
rotating around the right hand

178
00:10:10,840 --> 00:10:11,930
pivot point.

179
00:10:11,930 --> 00:10:15,410
And since we are using inverse
kinematic, both end get

180
00:10:15,410 --> 00:10:17,380
posed pretty natural,

181
00:10:17,380 --> 00:10:21,940
and I can do the same process
by selecting both hands

182
00:10:21,940 --> 00:10:25,430
and then selecting the torso
controller for example.

183
00:10:25,430 --> 00:10:28,450
As I'm turning around my
pose to make sure it works

184
00:10:28,450 --> 00:10:31,770
from every angle, I will
first select both end

185
00:10:31,770 --> 00:10:34,420
and finally the torso controller.

186
00:10:34,420 --> 00:10:38,180
And now whenever I move or
rotate the torso controller,

187
00:10:38,180 --> 00:10:41,550
the ends follow, good practice
is to test the different

188
00:10:41,550 --> 00:10:42,490
pivot points

189
00:10:43,820 --> 00:10:47,190
so that you get familiar
with them and can switch

190
00:10:47,190 --> 00:10:51,100
whenever you think it's
more relevant to pose faster

191
00:10:51,100 --> 00:10:52,260
or with ease.

192
00:10:52,260 --> 00:10:55,330
So as seen for the previous
pose, don't forget to turn

193
00:10:55,330 --> 00:10:58,320
around your character and
make sure that the pose

194
00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:00,230
works from any angle.

195
00:11:00,230 --> 00:11:05,000
Now that I have a better
pose or at least a base pose,

196
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:08,650
I will go back to object
mode and they will unhide

197
00:11:08,650 --> 00:11:10,880
the camera by pressing Alt+H.

198
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:14,400
With the camera selected, I
will go back onto the camera

199
00:11:14,400 --> 00:11:19,120
properties and I will set
the focal length to 90

200
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:24,120
and now we have a way better
focal length that better match

201
00:11:24,300 --> 00:11:26,320
the current reference picture.

202
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:29,350
With the focal length
corrected I will jump back

203
00:11:29,350 --> 00:11:33,500
into pose mode, select
both end and finally select

204
00:11:33,500 --> 00:11:36,780
the torso root controller
and I will tweak the pose

205
00:11:36,780 --> 00:11:40,980
of my character to better
match or try to better match

206
00:11:40,980 --> 00:11:42,140
the reference pose.

207
00:11:42,140 --> 00:11:45,240
When you're watching your
reference, take one feature

208
00:11:45,240 --> 00:11:49,800
like the elbow and try to
clearly identify its orientation.

209
00:11:49,800 --> 00:11:52,580
My left elbow is currently pointing up

210
00:11:52,580 --> 00:11:54,760
while on the reference it's pointing down,

211
00:11:54,760 --> 00:11:58,070
so I will simply fix that by
rotating a bit the shoulder

212
00:11:58,070 --> 00:12:00,720
controller and lowering the pole targets,

213
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:03,920
then I will control the other
elbow and make sure that

214
00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:07,180
it doesn't clip too much
inside my character.

215
00:12:07,180 --> 00:12:09,457
Another good practice
whenever you are watching

216
00:12:09,457 --> 00:12:13,000
the reference is to draw straight lines,

217
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:16,610
to see the position for
example, of the head compared

218
00:12:16,610 --> 00:12:20,540
to the foot or the left elbow
compared to the left foot,

219
00:12:20,540 --> 00:12:24,280
I can see that I need to
push my left foot a little

220
00:12:24,280 --> 00:12:25,660
on the outside.

221
00:12:25,660 --> 00:12:28,660
So there are a lot of moment
where you won't be able

222
00:12:28,660 --> 00:12:33,040
to perfectly match the reference
because the range of posing

223
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:37,130
of your character depend
on his proportions.

224
00:12:37,130 --> 00:12:40,880
Our current character is more
elongated than the female

225
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:43,080
character on the reference for example,

226
00:12:43,080 --> 00:12:47,950
so his arms are a little
longer and I have a lot of time

227
00:12:47,950 --> 00:12:51,890
trying to perfectly match the
position of his harm compared

228
00:12:51,890 --> 00:12:53,460
to the female character.

229
00:12:53,460 --> 00:12:58,230
So your goal is trying to
match but not trying to match

230
00:12:58,230 --> 00:13:02,890
at all costs, at some point
you need to figure out whether

231
00:13:02,890 --> 00:13:06,240
the pose you have, but please you are not.

232
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:11,140
Again, animation is enough
form, so I can't teach you

233
00:13:11,140 --> 00:13:14,590
the perfect way to pose
your character or tell you

234
00:13:14,590 --> 00:13:17,780
this is or this kind of pose must be bad.

235
00:13:17,780 --> 00:13:22,020
You are here to learn
all to bad a good pose,

236
00:13:22,020 --> 00:13:24,220
not this specific pose.

237
00:13:24,220 --> 00:13:26,980
And then you need to bring
your style to the pose,

238
00:13:26,980 --> 00:13:31,200
again I'm comparing the
reference pose with my character

239
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:34,690
trying to find the right
balance or at least the right

240
00:13:34,690 --> 00:13:35,523
momentum.

241
00:13:35,523 --> 00:13:39,260
Here we don't need to get our
character perfectly balanced

242
00:13:39,260 --> 00:13:43,460
since he's in motion, so its
center of gravity is moving

243
00:13:43,460 --> 00:13:44,420
in space.

244
00:13:44,420 --> 00:13:47,690
I could tweak this pose
forever, but for the time being

245
00:13:47,690 --> 00:13:51,480
we are going to rapidly pose
the finger around the handle

246
00:13:51,480 --> 00:13:52,500
of the weapon.

247
00:13:52,500 --> 00:13:57,360
So I will pose each finger
one by one trying to match

248
00:13:57,360 --> 00:14:01,270
a convincing pose, but
this is not the main focus

249
00:14:01,270 --> 00:14:05,870
of this video, so I will just
let you with a time-lapse

250
00:14:05,870 --> 00:14:08,020
where I'm posing those fingers.

251
00:14:08,020 --> 00:14:11,670
Don't forget that you can also
find tweaking the position

252
00:14:11,670 --> 00:14:14,640
of the feet and the position of the toes,

253
00:14:14,640 --> 00:14:18,800
but we will work on and posing
in a dedicating the video,

254
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:21,980
for the time being I'll
see you in the next one

255
00:14:21,980 --> 00:14:23,840
where we will push the current pose.

256
00:14:31,930 --> 00:14:34,597
(upbeat music)
