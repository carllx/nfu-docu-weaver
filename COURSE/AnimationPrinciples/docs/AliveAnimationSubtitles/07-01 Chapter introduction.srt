00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:01,950
- Welcome to Chapter Seven,

2
00:00:01,950 --> 00:00:05,190
where we are going to learn
how to create good poses

3
00:00:05,190 --> 00:00:06,730
for our character.

4
00:00:06,730 --> 00:00:09,860
I will try to teach you
all the fundamental rules

5
00:00:09,860 --> 00:00:12,410
to build poses from a reference.

6
00:00:12,410 --> 00:00:15,720
We will talk about the
most common mistakes we do

7
00:00:15,720 --> 00:00:17,880
whenever we're posing a character

8
00:00:17,880 --> 00:00:19,730
and how to avoid them.

9
00:00:19,730 --> 00:00:24,160
I will also try to explain you
how to study your references.

10
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:27,610
What do you have to
look for in first place?

11
00:00:27,610 --> 00:00:30,090
And we will talk about the little details

12
00:00:30,090 --> 00:00:32,950
that can improve your pose and some tips

13
00:00:32,950 --> 00:00:35,050
to help you pose faster.

14
00:00:35,050 --> 00:00:37,930
Once we are comfortable with basic posing,

15
00:00:37,930 --> 00:00:41,160
we will see how we can improve our pose

16
00:00:41,160 --> 00:00:44,830
by pushing them so that
they better communicate

17
00:00:44,830 --> 00:00:48,290
the will of our character
and its personality.

18
00:00:48,290 --> 00:00:50,893
So open Blender and let's get started.
