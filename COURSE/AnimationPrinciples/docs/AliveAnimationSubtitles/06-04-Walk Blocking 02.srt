00:00:00,600 --> 00:00:03,700
- [Instructor] Let's go ahead
with our walk cycle blocking.

2
00:00:03,700 --> 00:00:04,700
Before we go ahead,

3
00:00:04,700 --> 00:00:06,840
we need to check our frame rate.

4
00:00:06,840 --> 00:00:10,650
Since I'm using the same
file as the run cycle,

5
00:00:10,650 --> 00:00:14,400
my frame rate is still
30 frame per seconds.

6
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:16,530
As explained in the previous video,

7
00:00:16,530 --> 00:00:18,650
it's pretty common for feature film

8
00:00:18,650 --> 00:00:22,040
to use a 24 frame per second frame rate.

9
00:00:22,040 --> 00:00:25,500
And since I'm used to
animate for video game,

10
00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:28,480
I tend to use 30 frame per seconds.

11
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:30,940
I will stick to 30 frame per second,

12
00:00:30,940 --> 00:00:32,530
but it doesn't really matter

13
00:00:32,530 --> 00:00:35,710
if you want to switch
to 24 frame per seconds.

14
00:00:35,710 --> 00:00:39,600
A walk cycle can be on 18, 24, 26, 30,

15
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:41,860
whatever number of frame you want,

16
00:00:41,860 --> 00:00:45,090
depending on the style of
walk cycle you are doing.

17
00:00:45,090 --> 00:00:47,030
For vanilla walk cycle,

18
00:00:47,030 --> 00:00:52,030
we generally use 24 frames,
based at 24 frame per second.

19
00:00:52,623 --> 00:00:55,400
Basically, a cycle of one second.

20
00:00:55,400 --> 00:00:58,970
So I will stick to those
24 frame for a cycle,

21
00:00:58,970 --> 00:01:02,730
but I will keep my 30 frame
per second frame rate.

22
00:01:02,730 --> 00:01:06,490
So it will be a little
less than one second cycle.

23
00:01:06,490 --> 00:01:09,820
And if I feel like I
need to change the length

24
00:01:09,820 --> 00:01:12,240
of the walk cycle to have a good feedback,

25
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:13,530
I will do it later on.

26
00:01:13,530 --> 00:01:16,390
So don't get stuck with numbers.

27
00:01:16,390 --> 00:01:18,950
You can change the number of frame at reel

28
00:01:18,950 --> 00:01:21,470
depending on the visual feedback.

29
00:01:21,470 --> 00:01:23,530
So to mark the end of the cycle,

30
00:01:23,530 --> 00:01:26,330
I will duplicate all
the keys from frame zero

31
00:01:26,330 --> 00:01:28,760
and move them on frame 24.

32
00:01:28,760 --> 00:01:30,583
I will place the playhead on frame 23,

33
00:01:31,718 --> 00:01:33,350
and I will press Control + End,

34
00:01:33,350 --> 00:01:37,800
so that our animation plays
from frame zero to frame 23.

35
00:01:37,800 --> 00:01:39,510
So the first thing I will do

36
00:01:39,510 --> 00:01:42,320
is re-enable all my controllers,

37
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:45,500
I will select them all and
I will press Control + C

38
00:01:45,500 --> 00:01:47,120
to copy the current pose,

39
00:01:47,120 --> 00:01:50,560
go to frame 12 and press
Control + Shift + V

40
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:52,380
to mirror the pose.

41
00:01:52,380 --> 00:01:54,490
Since our character is symmetrical,

42
00:01:54,490 --> 00:01:59,320
we can mirror it halfway
through the cycle on frame 12,

43
00:01:59,320 --> 00:02:01,610
and since we are at the blocking stage,

44
00:02:01,610 --> 00:02:04,220
I will select all my keys, press T,

45
00:02:04,220 --> 00:02:05,700
and switch to constant

46
00:02:05,700 --> 00:02:09,210
so that I don't have any
interpolation on my controllers.

47
00:02:09,210 --> 00:02:13,120
The next pose we are going
to build is the down pose.

48
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:14,420
Looking at the reference,

49
00:02:14,420 --> 00:02:19,240
it's the moment where the torso
root is at its lowest point.

50
00:02:19,240 --> 00:02:22,240
The front foot has already
starting moving backward,

51
00:02:22,240 --> 00:02:26,070
but it's not centered beneath
the center of gravity.

52
00:02:26,070 --> 00:02:30,090
The back foot just left
or is leaving the ground.

53
00:02:30,090 --> 00:02:32,890
This depends on your work cycle style

54
00:02:32,890 --> 00:02:34,720
or the reference you are using.

55
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:37,030
The front arm start swinging backward

56
00:02:37,030 --> 00:02:40,770
while the back arm is
starting swinging forward.

57
00:02:40,770 --> 00:02:43,800
The hips are pushed by
the contacting legs,

58
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:46,720
while the shoulder are
tilting the opposite way.

59
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:48,800
Let's start posing our character.

60
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:50,510
I will move to frame three

61
00:02:50,510 --> 00:02:53,360
and insert a keyframe on all controllers.

62
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:55,340
We will basically build the key pose

63
00:02:55,340 --> 00:02:56,790
every three frames.

64
00:02:56,790 --> 00:02:59,820
As for the first pose, I
will start with the feet,

65
00:02:59,820 --> 00:03:03,030
so I will cancel the rotation on the toes

66
00:03:03,030 --> 00:03:05,590
and the heel controller on the front foot,

67
00:03:05,590 --> 00:03:07,720
and I will move it backward.

68
00:03:07,720 --> 00:03:09,570
Since it's contacting the ground,

69
00:03:09,570 --> 00:03:12,690
I'm moving it straight on the y-axis.

70
00:03:12,690 --> 00:03:14,960
I will lower the center of gravity

71
00:03:14,960 --> 00:03:17,090
using the torso controller

72
00:03:17,090 --> 00:03:20,000
and as I'm putting
weight onto the left leg,

73
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:23,900
I will shift the center of
gravity toward the left leg.

74
00:03:23,900 --> 00:03:27,040
I will push the back leg
further away backward,

75
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:29,590
and I will rotate the heel controller.

76
00:03:29,590 --> 00:03:32,530
This way, the heel will
reach its highest point

77
00:03:32,530 --> 00:03:34,760
before the foot leave the ground,

78
00:03:34,760 --> 00:03:36,910
keeping the leg slightly bent.

79
00:03:36,910 --> 00:03:41,610
Finally, I will slightly push
the center of gravity forward.

80
00:03:41,610 --> 00:03:46,200
I will tilt and rotate the
hips toward the supporting leg

81
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:48,960
and I will also slightly twisted them.

82
00:03:48,960 --> 00:03:52,810
We can now build our contact
pose with the chest controller

83
00:03:52,810 --> 00:03:57,090
by making it leaning a bit
toward the supporting foot.

84
00:03:57,090 --> 00:04:00,150
I will also slightly twist the chest

85
00:04:00,150 --> 00:04:02,850
to follow the arm motion.

86
00:04:02,850 --> 00:04:05,720
I will slightly rotate
the shoulder backward

87
00:04:05,720 --> 00:04:08,360
and then rotate the arm backward,

88
00:04:08,360 --> 00:04:11,370
and I will slightly rotate the forearm

89
00:04:11,370 --> 00:04:15,400
and hand forward to build
a follow through motion

90
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:17,080
or dragging motion.

91
00:04:17,080 --> 00:04:19,530
I will do the same on the other arm.

92
00:04:19,530 --> 00:04:22,760
I will slightly move the shoulder forward,

93
00:04:22,760 --> 00:04:25,677
and then I will rotate
the arm forward a bit

94
00:04:25,677 --> 00:04:29,270
and the forearm and hand backward,

95
00:04:29,270 --> 00:04:31,660
so the arm is a bit extended.

96
00:04:31,660 --> 00:04:34,850
My character pose feels
a bit out of balance,

97
00:04:34,850 --> 00:04:38,560
so I will tweak the position
of the center of gravity

98
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:41,490
and I will also tweak the arm position

99
00:04:41,490 --> 00:04:43,790
on the very first pose we built

100
00:04:43,790 --> 00:04:47,800
because I felt that the arm
was a bit too, on the outside.

101
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:49,710
Since I've refined the pose,

102
00:04:49,710 --> 00:04:52,200
I need to re-mirror it on frame 12

103
00:04:52,200 --> 00:04:55,120
and reduplicate it on frame 24

104
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:58,070
or at least paste the new pose.

105
00:04:58,070 --> 00:05:00,790
From there, I will jump
between frames zero

106
00:05:00,790 --> 00:05:04,133
and frame three using
the up and down arrow,

107
00:05:04,133 --> 00:05:07,630
and see, or merge, the center
of gravity of the character

108
00:05:07,630 --> 00:05:08,463
is moving.

109
00:05:08,463 --> 00:05:11,380
It will reach its
extreme side to side pose

110
00:05:11,380 --> 00:05:12,920
onto the next one.

111
00:05:12,920 --> 00:05:15,860
So I need to find a good in between here.

112
00:05:15,860 --> 00:05:17,750
The second thing I've been watching

113
00:05:17,750 --> 00:05:20,390
was the position of the front hand.

114
00:05:20,390 --> 00:05:23,590
In the front view, when I
was comparing the poses,

115
00:05:23,590 --> 00:05:26,940
it seems that the hand
wasn't moving in space.

116
00:05:26,940 --> 00:05:30,330
So I've slightly rotated
the forearm backward.

117
00:05:30,330 --> 00:05:32,930
And we can now work on the next pose.

118
00:05:32,930 --> 00:05:35,060
Next pose is the passing pose.

119
00:05:35,060 --> 00:05:37,520
It's the moment where the supporting foot

120
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:40,531
is right under the center of gravity.

121
00:05:40,531 --> 00:05:42,790
The opposite leg is catching up,

122
00:05:42,790 --> 00:05:46,690
both arm are almost
aligned with the torso,

123
00:05:46,690 --> 00:05:49,290
the hips are no longer twisted,

124
00:05:49,290 --> 00:05:52,900
but this is the time where the
leg pushed the most on them

125
00:05:52,900 --> 00:05:54,870
and they are raising the most.

126
00:05:54,870 --> 00:05:58,040
The chest is no longer twisting neither

127
00:05:58,040 --> 00:05:59,860
and depending on your reference,

128
00:05:59,860 --> 00:06:02,310
it might be almost horizontal

129
00:06:02,310 --> 00:06:07,110
or slightly tilting toward
the supporting leg too.

130
00:06:07,110 --> 00:06:09,340
Building a soft contour posing.

131
00:06:09,340 --> 00:06:12,710
Note that we will have to
slightly move the person leg,

132
00:06:12,710 --> 00:06:16,370
the one that not contacting
the ground to the side.

133
00:06:16,370 --> 00:06:18,420
Let's now work on our character

134
00:06:18,420 --> 00:06:21,300
so I will jump onto frame six,

135
00:06:21,300 --> 00:06:24,970
I will move the left foot
backward, along the y-axis,

136
00:06:24,970 --> 00:06:28,640
under the center of
gravity of my character

137
00:06:28,640 --> 00:06:31,450
and then on frame six
in the action editor,

138
00:06:31,450 --> 00:06:33,810
I will key all the controllers.

139
00:06:33,810 --> 00:06:36,130
This is the time where
the center of gravity

140
00:06:36,130 --> 00:06:41,130
reach it's extreme on the
side, toward the supporting leg

141
00:06:41,170 --> 00:06:43,370
and also moment where the character

142
00:06:43,370 --> 00:06:46,500
starts pushing on the
supporting leg so we can raise

143
00:06:46,500 --> 00:06:47,860
the center of gravity.

144
00:06:47,860 --> 00:06:52,180
Now I will position the right
leg just before the left leg

145
00:06:52,180 --> 00:06:53,570
and raise it a bit.

146
00:06:53,570 --> 00:06:56,870
We also need to rotate the heel upward

147
00:06:56,870 --> 00:06:59,730
and as explained before,
from the front view,

148
00:06:59,730 --> 00:07:02,240
I will slightly move it to the left

149
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:04,310
and rotate it to the left.

150
00:07:04,310 --> 00:07:06,330
One super important thing to mention

151
00:07:06,330 --> 00:07:09,080
whenever you are building a walk cycle.

152
00:07:09,080 --> 00:07:13,320
Humans and mammals, in general, are lazy.

153
00:07:13,320 --> 00:07:16,840
So we are raising our
foot as less as possible,

154
00:07:16,840 --> 00:07:19,150
meaning, that during the passing pose

155
00:07:19,150 --> 00:07:22,130
where the foot reach its highest point,

156
00:07:22,130 --> 00:07:23,890
keep it close to the ground.

157
00:07:23,890 --> 00:07:27,173
A beginner mistake is to
raise the foot, way to high.

158
00:07:28,300 --> 00:07:30,680
Now, jumping onto the hips controller,

159
00:07:30,680 --> 00:07:33,320
this is the moment where
the leg pushed the most

160
00:07:33,320 --> 00:07:36,690
onto the hip, so we need
to raise it to the side

161
00:07:36,690 --> 00:07:40,950
and regarding the twisting,
we can almost cancel it.

162
00:07:40,950 --> 00:07:42,860
I will do the same with the chest.

163
00:07:42,860 --> 00:07:45,650
I will almost cancel any twisting

164
00:07:45,650 --> 00:07:48,960
and I will, very slightly, make it tilt

165
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:50,870
toward the pushing leg

166
00:07:50,870 --> 00:07:54,643
so I'm canceling its rotation
and slightly tilting it.

167
00:07:55,900 --> 00:07:58,780
Regarding the arms, it's
pretty straightforward.

168
00:07:58,780 --> 00:08:02,470
You can slightly move the
shoulder backward or forward

169
00:08:02,470 --> 00:08:05,320
depending on the motion of the arm,

170
00:08:05,320 --> 00:08:08,290
mainly move the arm controller

171
00:08:08,290 --> 00:08:11,360
and slightly catch-up with the forearm,

172
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:13,810
and make the hand drag a bit.

173
00:08:13,810 --> 00:08:15,860
You can use the reference provided to,

174
00:08:15,860 --> 00:08:18,090
to refine your pose.

175
00:08:18,090 --> 00:08:20,300
I'm not yet posing the fingers,

176
00:08:20,300 --> 00:08:22,110
and as you have may noticed,

177
00:08:22,110 --> 00:08:25,670
I haven't posed neither
the neck or the head.

178
00:08:25,670 --> 00:08:28,750
This is because we will work
on this animation a bit,

179
00:08:28,750 --> 00:08:31,520
as we did regarding the run cycle.

180
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:33,120
We are blocking the main pose,

181
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:36,830
trying to make them as
accurate as possible,

182
00:08:36,830 --> 00:08:38,500
and during the polishing stage,

183
00:08:38,500 --> 00:08:42,220
we will bring a bit of up and
down on the chest and the head

184
00:08:42,220 --> 00:08:45,400
and a bit of rotation in
the head and the fingers.

185
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:48,120
The raised foot need a little more work,

186
00:08:48,120 --> 00:08:50,530
we need to raise the heel away more

187
00:08:50,530 --> 00:08:53,930
and also, slightly rotate
the toes toward the ground

188
00:08:53,930 --> 00:08:55,810
as they are dragging.

189
00:08:55,810 --> 00:08:59,590
After reviewing my poses
and the references,

190
00:08:59,590 --> 00:09:03,480
I've decided to rotate more
the foots on the outside.

191
00:09:03,480 --> 00:09:05,890
On some reference and
depending on the character

192
00:09:05,890 --> 00:09:07,320
you are animating,

193
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:10,500
the foots can be slightly
rotated to the side

194
00:09:10,500 --> 00:09:12,380
even when hitting the ground.

195
00:09:12,380 --> 00:09:15,270
Rotating the foot on the
outside or the inside

196
00:09:15,270 --> 00:09:18,000
will define your character profile.

197
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:22,100
It could be extremely open
for a cowboy, for example,

198
00:09:22,100 --> 00:09:26,420
or tilting toward the inside
for a shy kid or a shy girl,

199
00:09:26,420 --> 00:09:27,253
for example.

200
00:09:27,253 --> 00:09:28,800
For the sake of this course,

201
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:30,380
I will keep it straight.

202
00:09:30,380 --> 00:09:32,623
And we can jump on the final pose.

203
00:09:33,460 --> 00:09:36,480
Let's have a look to the
latest pose we need to block.

204
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:39,510
It's the up pose or pushing pose.

205
00:09:39,510 --> 00:09:42,000
The supporting leg is
slightly on the back,

206
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,660
and it's heel starts to raise.

207
00:09:44,660 --> 00:09:47,220
The other foot is slightly forward,

208
00:09:47,220 --> 00:09:49,620
and it has starting rotating

209
00:09:49,620 --> 00:09:54,000
so that the heel can get in
contact in the next pose.

210
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,700
The arms are swinging
the opposite direction

211
00:09:56,700 --> 00:09:58,810
compared to the legs

212
00:09:58,810 --> 00:10:02,920
and almost reach their extreme
poses that they will reach

213
00:10:02,920 --> 00:10:04,420
in the next pose.

214
00:10:04,420 --> 00:10:06,997
The hands are moving the faster in space

215
00:10:06,997 --> 00:10:10,170
between the passing and the pushing pose.

216
00:10:10,170 --> 00:10:13,770
The hips are still pushed
by the supporting leg,

217
00:10:13,770 --> 00:10:17,270
but they have start shifting
toward the other one.

218
00:10:17,270 --> 00:10:18,750
They are as usual,

219
00:10:18,750 --> 00:10:22,180
slightly twisting toward
the different feet.

220
00:10:22,180 --> 00:10:24,860
The chest is twisting in the opposite way

221
00:10:24,860 --> 00:10:27,960
and is slightly raised
toward the front arm.

222
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:30,840
As the leg push, the center of gravity

223
00:10:30,840 --> 00:10:33,730
is moving toward the opposite foot.

224
00:10:33,730 --> 00:10:36,400
Let's build this final
pose and see how it look.

225
00:10:36,400 --> 00:10:39,270
I will jump on from nine
and insert a key frame

226
00:10:39,270 --> 00:10:41,010
on all controller.

227
00:10:41,010 --> 00:10:44,040
We can push the center of gravity up,

228
00:10:44,040 --> 00:10:48,520
and start moving it on the
opposite side of the pushing leg.

229
00:10:48,520 --> 00:10:52,420
I will move the pushing leg
backward along the y-axis

230
00:10:52,420 --> 00:10:56,900
and then I will raise the heel
using the heel controller.

231
00:10:56,900 --> 00:10:58,250
I'm raising the heels

232
00:10:58,250 --> 00:11:00,740
so that I have a subtle
bending in the leg.

233
00:11:00,740 --> 00:11:04,490
I will then select the other
foot and move it forward.

234
00:11:04,490 --> 00:11:07,880
I will then rotate it backward
using the heel controller

235
00:11:07,880 --> 00:11:12,440
and relax a bit, the toes, by
rotating them a bit forward.

236
00:11:12,440 --> 00:11:16,200
I will keep them slightly
rotated toward the ground

237
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:19,020
so that we can feel that
they are dragging the feet.

238
00:11:19,020 --> 00:11:21,850
I will slightly rotate the foot controller

239
00:11:21,850 --> 00:11:24,440
toward the outside and
from the front view,

240
00:11:24,440 --> 00:11:27,710
I will slightly push it on the inside

241
00:11:27,710 --> 00:11:30,190
toward the contacting pose.

242
00:11:30,190 --> 00:11:32,170
Since I rotated a bit the foot,

243
00:11:32,170 --> 00:11:35,301
I need to align the knee
by moving the pole targets

244
00:11:35,301 --> 00:11:37,110
slightly to the outside.

245
00:11:37,110 --> 00:11:40,450
I will slightly reduce
the tilting of the hips

246
00:11:40,450 --> 00:11:42,880
and then I will slightly twist them

247
00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:45,470
so that they are align with the feet.

248
00:11:45,470 --> 00:11:47,640
I will slightly tilt the chest

249
00:11:47,640 --> 00:11:51,750
so that it's slightly
upward toward the front arm,

250
00:11:51,750 --> 00:11:56,360
the left one, and twist it
toward the front arm too,

251
00:11:56,360 --> 00:11:59,240
then I would rotate the front arm forward

252
00:11:59,240 --> 00:12:03,900
and slightly twist it so
that it almost match the pose

253
00:12:03,900 --> 00:12:05,270
on frame 12.

254
00:12:05,270 --> 00:12:08,580
This is why I'm comparing both poses.

255
00:12:08,580 --> 00:12:10,490
As explained previously,

256
00:12:10,490 --> 00:12:15,340
the arms almost reach their
extreme pose during the pushing

257
00:12:15,340 --> 00:12:18,980
and reach their extreme
during the contact pose.

258
00:12:18,980 --> 00:12:23,160
So the shoulder and elbow
are easing into frame 12.

259
00:12:23,160 --> 00:12:25,300
The forearm is catching up

260
00:12:25,300 --> 00:12:28,200
and the hand is likely dragging backward.

261
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:32,080
As usual, you can use the
image reference to guide you.

262
00:12:32,080 --> 00:12:34,850
As seen during the run cycle chapter,

263
00:12:34,850 --> 00:12:36,640
a good blocking is important,

264
00:12:36,640 --> 00:12:39,100
but it doesn't mean that we won't be able

265
00:12:39,100 --> 00:12:43,090
to modify the animation
during the polishing stage.

266
00:12:43,090 --> 00:12:46,615
It can be harder to spot the
problem during the blocking,

267
00:12:46,615 --> 00:12:48,960
and it's sometimes pop to the eye

268
00:12:48,960 --> 00:12:52,960
whenever switching to spline
or playing the whole animation.

269
00:12:52,960 --> 00:12:55,340
So just make the best looking you can

270
00:12:55,340 --> 00:12:59,890
and then copy each pose by
selecting all the controller,

271
00:12:59,890 --> 00:13:02,290
press Control + C to copy the pose,

272
00:13:02,290 --> 00:13:06,560
jump 12 frame later and
press Control + Shift + V

273
00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:09,710
and repeat the process for each poses.

274
00:13:09,710 --> 00:13:11,160
Once you are done with this,

275
00:13:11,160 --> 00:13:13,890
you can finally play your animation

276
00:13:13,890 --> 00:13:17,100
and see your walk cycle blocked.

277
00:13:17,100 --> 00:13:19,400
I advise you to watch it for a moment,

278
00:13:19,400 --> 00:13:21,293
rotate around the character

279
00:13:21,293 --> 00:13:26,293
and also switch between
autographic and perspective view.

280
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:27,620
In my case,

281
00:13:27,620 --> 00:13:30,060
I feel like there's
something a little off.

282
00:13:30,060 --> 00:13:33,460
My character is pushed too much forward.

283
00:13:33,460 --> 00:13:37,370
So instead of reworking
each poses one by one,

284
00:13:37,370 --> 00:13:39,830
I will select the torso controller

285
00:13:39,830 --> 00:13:42,410
and I will switch to the graph editor

286
00:13:42,410 --> 00:13:45,210
and isolate the y location curve.

287
00:13:45,210 --> 00:13:46,810
Remember what we have seen

288
00:13:46,810 --> 00:13:50,670
in the very last lesson
of the run cycle chapter?

289
00:13:50,670 --> 00:13:54,210
We can offset a whole curve
from a transform channel

290
00:13:54,210 --> 00:13:56,240
to modify the animation.

291
00:13:56,240 --> 00:13:59,710
I've hidden all the curve, but the y curve

292
00:13:59,710 --> 00:14:03,350
and I will press G and Y to constraint it

293
00:14:03,350 --> 00:14:05,900
on the y-axis in the graph editor

294
00:14:05,900 --> 00:14:09,240
and move it up so that it will push

295
00:14:09,240 --> 00:14:13,620
the torso controller off my
character slightly backward.

296
00:14:13,620 --> 00:14:16,530
And now he looks way more balanced.

297
00:14:16,530 --> 00:14:17,710
In the next video,

298
00:14:17,710 --> 00:14:20,260
we will be able to jump into splining

299
00:14:20,260 --> 00:14:24,047
and polishing the different
features of our character.
