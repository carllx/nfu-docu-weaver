1
00:00:00,750 --> 00:00:03,520
- [Instructor] It's time
to finally start polishing

2
00:00:03,520 --> 00:00:06,400
our squirrel idle animation.

3
00:00:06,400 --> 00:00:08,060
It will be kind of similar

4
00:00:08,060 --> 00:00:11,710
as when we have been
polishing the run cycle.

5
00:00:11,710 --> 00:00:14,820
We will start with the
most influential controller

6
00:00:14,820 --> 00:00:19,310
of our character like the
torso or the body controller,

7
00:00:19,310 --> 00:00:22,390
then polish the contact paws, the feet

8
00:00:22,390 --> 00:00:24,360
and then all secondary motion

9
00:00:24,360 --> 00:00:27,460
and follow through like
the tail and the face.

10
00:00:27,460 --> 00:00:29,980
You can choose whether to polish fully

11
00:00:29,980 --> 00:00:32,290
each controller one by one

12
00:00:32,290 --> 00:00:35,860
but when I work on long
sequences like that

13
00:00:35,860 --> 00:00:38,480
I prefer to work by chunk,

14
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:42,690
like working on the first
two paws and polish them

15
00:00:42,690 --> 00:00:45,220
and then go to the paws three and four

16
00:00:45,220 --> 00:00:47,180
and polish them, et cetera.

17
00:00:47,180 --> 00:00:50,240
I think it's a little more motivating

18
00:00:50,240 --> 00:00:51,870
when you do this by chunk

19
00:00:51,870 --> 00:00:53,990
because doing a long shot like that

20
00:00:53,990 --> 00:00:56,350
and polishing only one controller

21
00:00:56,350 --> 00:00:58,850
will show results only on the long-term

22
00:00:58,850 --> 00:01:02,350
and sometime it can be
hard to stay motivated.

23
00:01:02,350 --> 00:01:05,510
But this is really a
matter of personal choice

24
00:01:05,510 --> 00:01:08,970
so you can work the
whole animation at once

25
00:01:08,970 --> 00:01:12,470
focusing first on the
torso and then the legs,

26
00:01:12,470 --> 00:01:14,750
and then all the secondary motion

27
00:01:14,750 --> 00:01:19,555
or do as I will polishing
each segment of the animation.

28
00:01:19,555 --> 00:01:20,388
(air whooshing)

29
00:01:20,388 --> 00:01:21,800
Just a big warning in here

30
00:01:21,800 --> 00:01:25,680
I selected all the key frame
and switch them to busy.

31
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:28,670
And this is a mistake since my root motion

32
00:01:28,670 --> 00:01:31,740
is supposed to use a linear interpolation.

33
00:01:31,740 --> 00:01:35,200
This is not a big deal, but
it leads to some mistakes

34
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:39,790
into my transition between the
run cycle and the idle pose,

35
00:01:39,790 --> 00:01:42,620
so make sure you select
your root controller

36
00:01:42,620 --> 00:01:44,780
and press T and switch it back

37
00:01:44,780 --> 00:01:47,010
to linear before going further.

38
00:01:47,010 --> 00:01:48,500
When I play the animation

39
00:01:48,500 --> 00:01:52,370
it doesn't look that bad when
we switch to spline mode.

40
00:01:52,370 --> 00:01:56,020
And this is because we have
detailed a lot our blocking.

41
00:01:56,020 --> 00:01:58,870
But there is definitely
something weird happening

42
00:01:58,870 --> 00:02:00,690
about the head rotation.

43
00:02:00,690 --> 00:02:03,230
The head of our character is twisting

44
00:02:03,230 --> 00:02:04,690
or flipping the wrong way.

45
00:02:04,690 --> 00:02:06,710
This is a super classic bug

46
00:02:06,710 --> 00:02:09,344
whenever you switch to spline

47
00:02:09,344 --> 00:02:10,843
and we will see how to fix this.

48
00:02:10,843 --> 00:02:13,650
I will explain our rotation behavior

49
00:02:13,650 --> 00:02:17,170
in a more detailed video
in the next chapter.

50
00:02:17,170 --> 00:02:19,610
So before we even start polishing class

51
00:02:19,610 --> 00:02:21,460
we'll go into the graph editor

52
00:02:21,460 --> 00:02:25,810
and we will fix it when you
get this kind of bug, it's 100%

53
00:02:25,810 --> 00:02:29,470
because of the curves as we
are using quaternion rotation

54
00:02:29,470 --> 00:02:34,200
for the neck and head, we
have four rotation channels.

55
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:37,640
And when I frame my curve
pressing the dot key

56
00:02:37,640 --> 00:02:41,333
on the num pad, we can see this
huge drop on the W channel.

57
00:02:42,330 --> 00:02:44,880
And basically what's happening is Blender

58
00:02:44,880 --> 00:02:47,710
using the shortest path to turn the head.

59
00:02:47,710 --> 00:02:49,470
So instead of rotating

60
00:02:49,470 --> 00:02:52,860
with the nose facing the
front part of the character

61
00:02:52,860 --> 00:02:57,290
it's going back because the
turn is short term this way

62
00:02:57,290 --> 00:03:00,920
and this is the common
problem with quaternions.

63
00:03:00,920 --> 00:03:04,610
To fix this I didn't
really fix the curve first

64
00:03:04,610 --> 00:03:08,230
and then try to match the previous pose.

65
00:03:08,230 --> 00:03:11,780
So I will simply push this W curve up

66
00:03:11,780 --> 00:03:14,380
so that it has a better continuity.

67
00:03:14,380 --> 00:03:17,540
And then I will slightly
tweak the other curve

68
00:03:17,540 --> 00:03:21,802
so that the head is getting
back to its original position.

69
00:03:21,802 --> 00:03:24,770
When you get this kind of curve dropped,

70
00:03:24,770 --> 00:03:27,090
you generally have a whole chunk

71
00:03:27,090 --> 00:03:30,460
of your animations that
is slightly offsetting.

72
00:03:30,460 --> 00:03:33,750
So I will select the Z rotation curve

73
00:03:33,750 --> 00:03:35,840
and push it a little up.

74
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:38,900
So I'm guessing it's the Z rotation curve

75
00:03:38,900 --> 00:03:42,540
because I have a huge drop
on the Z rotation curve too.

76
00:03:42,540 --> 00:03:46,527
And I can see that
between frame 72 and 95,

77
00:03:46,527 --> 00:03:49,940
the head was offset compared
to what I have done before.

78
00:03:49,940 --> 00:03:53,330
So the trick here is to test each curve

79
00:03:53,330 --> 00:03:56,830
and see which one is
bugging and then offset it.

80
00:03:56,830 --> 00:03:58,750
So that it's betterly aligned

81
00:03:58,750 --> 00:04:01,860
with the previous key frame of this curve.

82
00:04:01,860 --> 00:04:04,920
So I'm just tweaking the
position of the curve.

83
00:04:04,920 --> 00:04:07,290
And I just focus on the pose

84
00:04:07,290 --> 00:04:10,170
of my character on the current key frames.

85
00:04:10,170 --> 00:04:12,400
I am fixing the pose.

86
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:15,300
I'm not thinking about the animation,

87
00:04:15,300 --> 00:04:18,570
the interpolation of
the curve or whatever.

88
00:04:18,570 --> 00:04:23,490
I'm just kind of reshaping
the poses of my character.

89
00:04:23,490 --> 00:04:27,500
And so if you're happy with
the current poses I have

90
00:04:27,500 --> 00:04:29,610
meaning that they are close

91
00:04:29,610 --> 00:04:32,000
to what I have during the blocking stage.

92
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,113
I can move on and start polishing.

93
00:04:34,963 --> 00:04:35,796
(air whooshing)

94
00:04:35,796 --> 00:04:39,110
So this is something that
is becoming very common

95
00:04:39,110 --> 00:04:42,140
into this course is that
the first thing I do

96
00:04:42,140 --> 00:04:46,310
is work on the torso root of my character.

97
00:04:46,310 --> 00:04:49,100
Because as I've explained before,

98
00:04:49,100 --> 00:04:50,760
this is one of the controller

99
00:04:50,760 --> 00:04:53,930
that will add the most
influence onto the character

100
00:04:54,930 --> 00:04:58,160
and to get a good
visualization of the spacing

101
00:04:58,160 --> 00:05:01,510
and the arcs I've
calculated the motion path.

102
00:05:01,510 --> 00:05:03,870
The first thing I'm working on

103
00:05:03,870 --> 00:05:08,180
is the follow through
animation after the landing.

104
00:05:08,180 --> 00:05:11,510
This is why I've pushed my curve down

105
00:05:11,510 --> 00:05:15,060
in an overshoot just
after the contact pose

106
00:05:15,060 --> 00:05:19,090
our character has a huge speed going down.

107
00:05:19,090 --> 00:05:23,460
So we need to absorb the
impact and then it recovered

108
00:05:23,460 --> 00:05:27,130
and we have our Z location
getting stabilized.

109
00:05:27,130 --> 00:05:29,350
So we have just created some kind

110
00:05:29,350 --> 00:05:34,070
of overshoot and now I will
switch on to the Y curve

111
00:05:34,070 --> 00:05:36,330
and I will do exactly the same

112
00:05:36,330 --> 00:05:39,206
as our character is contacting the ground

113
00:05:39,206 --> 00:05:42,310
while we're moving forward
he's absorbing the inertia.

114
00:05:42,310 --> 00:05:45,360
So I do create a slight overshoot here,

115
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:48,830
so whatever the trend
form channel you are using

116
00:05:48,830 --> 00:05:52,910
you will see this kind of
shape in my curves very often.

117
00:05:52,910 --> 00:05:55,670
This is really the archetype shape

118
00:05:55,670 --> 00:05:59,590
of a curve for a follow
through or an overshoot.

119
00:05:59,590 --> 00:06:02,200
So it doesn't apply for impacts

120
00:06:02,200 --> 00:06:06,760
where the curve will stop
right on the contact pose.

121
00:06:06,760 --> 00:06:09,720
But as soon as you have a
lot of verticality in a curve

122
00:06:09,720 --> 00:06:14,270
that means that the motion is
very fast or very important.

123
00:06:14,270 --> 00:06:16,260
So as soon as it stop,

124
00:06:16,260 --> 00:06:18,820
you will have a bit of overshoot

125
00:06:18,820 --> 00:06:20,480
or follow through animation,

126
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:23,450
meaning that there is a bit of inertia

127
00:06:23,450 --> 00:06:27,970
and you can apply it to
scaling rotation and location.

128
00:06:27,970 --> 00:06:29,600
The more you will input

129
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:32,310
and the longer there
will be, the more weight

130
00:06:32,310 --> 00:06:35,690
and lack of control, you will get,

131
00:06:35,690 --> 00:06:39,550
the tighter and smaller those overshoots,

132
00:06:39,550 --> 00:06:43,980
the lighter or controlled
the motion will look like.

133
00:06:43,980 --> 00:06:48,020
As the main body controller
arc start to look decent,

134
00:06:48,020 --> 00:06:52,570
I can now switch to the
rotation of this controller.

135
00:06:52,570 --> 00:06:54,970
I always apply the same rule.

136
00:06:54,970 --> 00:06:58,310
I start with the X rotation curve

137
00:06:58,310 --> 00:07:03,310
because it's the most
influential into this motion.

138
00:07:03,320 --> 00:07:05,760
So I'm kind of tracking the head,

139
00:07:05,760 --> 00:07:07,620
when I'm rotating the whole body

140
00:07:07,620 --> 00:07:11,000
because this is what will
give you the curvature

141
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,190
of the whole body.

142
00:07:12,190 --> 00:07:14,950
And as I polish, the X rotation,

143
00:07:14,950 --> 00:07:18,470
which shows the most from a profile view,

144
00:07:18,470 --> 00:07:22,610
I also rework the Y location.

145
00:07:22,610 --> 00:07:25,080
So when I'm polishing my curve,

146
00:07:25,080 --> 00:07:28,780
it happened that I offset a lot of them.

147
00:07:28,780 --> 00:07:31,460
This way I'm retiming the animation.

148
00:07:31,460 --> 00:07:35,150
If I feel like the landing
animation is too long,

149
00:07:35,150 --> 00:07:40,150
I can offset a bunch of
key frame by one frame back

150
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:43,440
and it will happen a little faster.

151
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:46,270
In front view, I'm
working on the Y rotation

152
00:07:46,270 --> 00:07:48,530
which is the twisting of my character.

153
00:07:48,530 --> 00:07:52,320
When he lands, I twist
toward the left hand

154
00:07:52,320 --> 00:07:54,840
which is the first contacting the ground

155
00:07:54,840 --> 00:07:58,300
and where the character
will put his weight

156
00:07:58,300 --> 00:08:02,440
and when he's raising on the right hand

157
00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:05,983
I'm twisting toward this point too.

158
00:08:05,983 --> 00:08:07,660
With the Z rotation curve,

159
00:08:07,660 --> 00:08:11,980
I'm creating the side-to-side rotation

160
00:08:11,980 --> 00:08:13,560
and what I will do here

161
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:17,230
as I have a drastic
change in the orientation

162
00:08:17,230 --> 00:08:21,990
of my character is input
a very slight overshoot.

163
00:08:21,990 --> 00:08:25,340
So creating those
overshoot, or follow through

164
00:08:25,340 --> 00:08:28,470
in the curve is not an automatism,

165
00:08:28,470 --> 00:08:31,730
but when you see this kind
of shape in your curve,

166
00:08:31,730 --> 00:08:34,930
meaning that it's going
down or high very fast

167
00:08:34,930 --> 00:08:38,110
and then it stopped creating a plateau.

168
00:08:38,110 --> 00:08:40,710
Just try to add a bit of an overshoot

169
00:08:40,710 --> 00:08:43,730
and see if it does fit your animation.

170
00:08:43,730 --> 00:08:46,610
Again, I can't tell you
this is the way to go

171
00:08:46,610 --> 00:08:50,180
because animation, as any form of art,

172
00:08:50,180 --> 00:08:52,206
is about experimentation

173
00:08:52,206 --> 00:08:57,206
and what we work for this
specific squirrel animation,

174
00:08:57,260 --> 00:08:59,800
won't work for all the squirrel animation

175
00:08:59,800 --> 00:09:01,920
you're going to be doing.

176
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:05,410
This might not fit the type of style

177
00:09:05,410 --> 00:09:07,580
you are looking for into your animation

178
00:09:07,580 --> 00:09:09,530
whether it's super realistic

179
00:09:09,530 --> 00:09:11,510
or it's super stylized.

180
00:09:11,510 --> 00:09:13,170
But what I want to say here,

181
00:09:13,170 --> 00:09:16,560
is that it's a matter of experience.

182
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:19,010
I'm giving you the foundation

183
00:09:19,010 --> 00:09:21,820
to create this kind of animation,

184
00:09:21,820 --> 00:09:23,810
and then you have to train your eyes

185
00:09:23,810 --> 00:09:26,620
by animating and animating again.

186
00:09:26,620 --> 00:09:29,520
But this is a cool tip
you should keep in mind

187
00:09:29,520 --> 00:09:31,660
and when you get more experience

188
00:09:31,660 --> 00:09:33,780
you will know when you have to dial

189
00:09:33,780 --> 00:09:37,270
the intensity of your
overshoot, get rid of them

190
00:09:37,270 --> 00:09:39,660
or add even more of them.

191
00:09:39,660 --> 00:09:43,600
On the specific pose I'm
rotating the body controller

192
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:48,400
and lowering it and also
rotating the chest controller

193
00:09:48,400 --> 00:09:50,470
to avoid the right leg

194
00:09:50,470 --> 00:09:53,990
contacting the ground to be overextended.

195
00:09:53,990 --> 00:09:57,050
This is something you can also fix

196
00:09:57,050 --> 00:10:01,070
in the second time using the
little tweaker controller

197
00:10:01,070 --> 00:10:04,960
the small sphere on the
elbow of the character.

198
00:10:04,960 --> 00:10:07,710
Unless this is something
you are looking for

199
00:10:07,710 --> 00:10:09,500
if you're doing on purpose

200
00:10:09,500 --> 00:10:14,500
having a stretch, lean on
your character, very straight,

201
00:10:14,950 --> 00:10:17,570
will look stiffened,
won't look that natural.

202
00:10:17,570 --> 00:10:19,150
So here I'm not saying

203
00:10:19,150 --> 00:10:24,150
that you can't have this leg
fully stretch as I am here

204
00:10:24,370 --> 00:10:29,370
but I will not all the pose
with the lean totally stretched.

205
00:10:29,560 --> 00:10:34,560
So I've done whatever I could
to fix the shape of the arm.

206
00:10:35,420 --> 00:10:40,350
But if I can, then I'm totally
fine using the tweaker bone

207
00:10:40,350 --> 00:10:44,760
pushing it back a little to
have a slight bend in the arm.

208
00:10:44,760 --> 00:10:48,470
Even if in the end, it's a
little longer than it should be,

209
00:10:48,470 --> 00:10:49,357
we won't see it

210
00:10:49,357 --> 00:10:51,165
and the silhouette will look better.

211
00:10:51,165 --> 00:10:51,998
(air whooshing)

212
00:10:51,998 --> 00:10:53,280
When polishing the head,

213
00:10:53,280 --> 00:10:56,380
the first thing I do is to track the nose.

214
00:10:56,380 --> 00:11:00,270
So here I have a controller
for the nose, so that perfect.

215
00:11:00,270 --> 00:11:03,330
I will calculate the motion path onto it.

216
00:11:03,330 --> 00:11:06,270
As usual, I start with the X rotation

217
00:11:06,270 --> 00:11:09,060
because it's the most
influential controller

218
00:11:09,060 --> 00:11:11,630
on this part of the character.

219
00:11:11,630 --> 00:11:14,970
And the idea here is to
make the head dragging

220
00:11:14,970 --> 00:11:17,010
compared to the rest of the body.

221
00:11:17,010 --> 00:11:19,880
So since the head is further away

222
00:11:19,880 --> 00:11:23,140
from the center of
gravity of our character,

223
00:11:23,140 --> 00:11:27,560
that is represented by
the main body controller,

224
00:11:27,560 --> 00:11:32,100
it will kind of drag, it
will be delayed in its motion

225
00:11:32,100 --> 00:11:35,000
but I want to make this subtle again.

226
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:38,470
We are working on the very light character

227
00:11:38,470 --> 00:11:42,470
so I don't want its head to
wobble all the way around.

228
00:11:42,470 --> 00:11:45,580
It will drag, but just a touch.

229
00:11:45,580 --> 00:11:49,650
The overshoot must be
as short as possible.

230
00:11:49,650 --> 00:11:53,100
If we were animating a baby, for example,

231
00:11:53,100 --> 00:11:56,010
it would lack of control in its head.

232
00:11:56,010 --> 00:12:01,010
So that will be a great moment
to make it drag a lot more,

233
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:04,180
build stronger overshoot,

234
00:12:04,180 --> 00:12:06,820
and even made the head wobble.

235
00:12:06,820 --> 00:12:09,770
But this is not the case for our character

236
00:12:09,770 --> 00:12:12,280
is currently very agile.

237
00:12:12,280 --> 00:12:15,730
And I want to show that
he's controlling his landing

238
00:12:15,730 --> 00:12:18,610
and his head is more driven by curiosity

239
00:12:19,800 --> 00:12:21,620
than its own weight.

240
00:12:21,620 --> 00:12:24,410
As soon as the rotation are fixed

241
00:12:24,410 --> 00:12:28,430
and I've done it also on the
chest controller previously,

242
00:12:28,430 --> 00:12:31,020
I work on the location curve of the head.

243
00:12:31,020 --> 00:12:34,380
The idea is to squash
the head inside the body

244
00:12:34,380 --> 00:12:36,570
whenever he is raising very fast.

245
00:12:36,570 --> 00:12:39,030
And then when he get curious

246
00:12:39,030 --> 00:12:44,030
or when he hit its final
poses, I push the head forward.

247
00:12:44,910 --> 00:12:46,680
One very important thing

248
00:12:46,680 --> 00:12:48,710
is that squash and stretch

249
00:12:48,710 --> 00:12:51,902
is not only about scaling something

250
00:12:51,902 --> 00:12:54,730
or really squashing it.

251
00:12:54,730 --> 00:12:57,330
It can be represented by the distance

252
00:12:57,330 --> 00:12:59,930
between two controllers in this case,

253
00:12:59,930 --> 00:13:02,940
the head getting more into the body

254
00:13:02,940 --> 00:13:05,240
but the head doesn't get squashed.

255
00:13:05,240 --> 00:13:07,950
The neck does get squashed a bit

256
00:13:07,950 --> 00:13:11,260
but we currently don't
really see a deformation

257
00:13:11,260 --> 00:13:15,380
but the silhouette of our
character overall get shortened.

258
00:13:15,380 --> 00:13:18,220
So it gets squashed a bit.

259
00:13:18,220 --> 00:13:20,870
So here you can see that
I'm playing in the plane

260
00:13:20,870 --> 00:13:23,140
and throbbing through my timeline,

261
00:13:23,140 --> 00:13:26,320
playing with the Y and Z location curve,

262
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:29,240
just to get this slight head bop

263
00:13:29,240 --> 00:13:32,500
when it comes to its extreme pose,

264
00:13:32,500 --> 00:13:35,840
creating the slight shake of the head

265
00:13:35,840 --> 00:13:39,100
using the location
instead of the rotation,

266
00:13:39,100 --> 00:13:40,603
as we explained before,

267
00:13:41,860 --> 00:13:44,430
won't translate a lack of control

268
00:13:44,430 --> 00:13:48,440
because our character eyes are stable.

269
00:13:48,440 --> 00:13:51,420
He's looking at a point in space.

270
00:13:51,420 --> 00:13:55,680
While if we were doing this
overshoot with the rotation

271
00:13:55,680 --> 00:13:58,410
the eye will be kind of jiggling

272
00:13:58,410 --> 00:14:00,980
in the space, in the screen space,

273
00:14:00,980 --> 00:14:03,880
on what we are seeing in our animation.

274
00:14:03,880 --> 00:14:07,490
And it will then look like
our character is controlling

275
00:14:07,490 --> 00:14:08,700
what he's doing.

276
00:14:08,700 --> 00:14:12,120
As I'm getting close to
having the head polished,

277
00:14:12,120 --> 00:14:16,230
look at how I slightly move
this point on the curve.

278
00:14:16,230 --> 00:14:20,350
So I don't want to get a
perfect plateau of the curve.

279
00:14:20,350 --> 00:14:23,210
I want to keep very subtle movement

280
00:14:23,210 --> 00:14:25,203
that we call moving holds.

281
00:14:25,203 --> 00:14:26,711
(air whooshing)

282
00:14:26,711 --> 00:14:27,930
As I'm pretty happy with my head motion,

283
00:14:27,930 --> 00:14:31,610
I will now be working on
the nose of the character.

284
00:14:31,610 --> 00:14:34,630
The idea here is to
create a secondary motion.

285
00:14:34,630 --> 00:14:37,960
So the nose will simply be dragging a bit

286
00:14:37,960 --> 00:14:40,770
while our character is raising the head.

287
00:14:40,770 --> 00:14:44,810
If we watch the motion path
from frame 14 to frame 17

288
00:14:44,810 --> 00:14:47,410
we can see that we have a lot spacing

289
00:14:47,410 --> 00:14:49,630
meaning that the head is moving fast.

290
00:14:49,630 --> 00:14:52,020
So this is where the nose of our character

291
00:14:52,020 --> 00:14:53,580
will be dragging the most.

292
00:14:53,580 --> 00:14:57,090
And it does show onto the curve here.

293
00:14:57,090 --> 00:15:00,280
So I'm not using the graphing
tool to control the nose.

294
00:15:00,280 --> 00:15:03,040
I am moving it directly into space.

295
00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:04,990
And then I may use the graph editor

296
00:15:04,990 --> 00:15:08,730
just to slightly polish
the position of the nose.

297
00:15:08,730 --> 00:15:13,150
On frame 19, I've created
a little bump in the curve

298
00:15:13,150 --> 00:15:16,990
so that we have some kind of
bouncing motion of the nose

299
00:15:16,990 --> 00:15:21,640
as our character reaches its
highest point with the head

300
00:15:21,640 --> 00:15:26,240
all those little element give
texture to our animation,

301
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:30,090
small details and I will be
doing the same with the eyes.

302
00:15:30,090 --> 00:15:32,670
I won't be animating the night blink

303
00:15:32,670 --> 00:15:35,410
but then we'll very
slightly close the eyes,

304
00:15:35,410 --> 00:15:38,060
our character is raising his head.

305
00:15:38,060 --> 00:15:42,210
All of these little details
are like squash and stretch.

306
00:15:42,210 --> 00:15:44,740
They are supporting the animation.

307
00:15:44,740 --> 00:15:48,620
So I haven't been using the
squash and stretch controller

308
00:15:48,620 --> 00:15:51,070
on top of the head of the character

309
00:15:51,070 --> 00:15:53,430
because it doesn't really fit

310
00:15:53,430 --> 00:15:56,070
what I wanted for this animation,

311
00:15:56,070 --> 00:15:58,900
but using the eyes and the tip of the nose

312
00:15:58,900 --> 00:16:02,820
and slightly dragging them
backward kind of input

313
00:16:02,820 --> 00:16:06,270
this squash and stretch
feeling of the motion.

314
00:16:06,270 --> 00:16:08,303
I will proceed the same with the ears.

315
00:16:08,303 --> 00:16:11,970
I will make them drag whenever
there is a fast motion

316
00:16:11,970 --> 00:16:14,695
and I will create a slight overshoot

317
00:16:14,695 --> 00:16:16,960
or jiggling of the heels.

318
00:16:16,960 --> 00:16:21,200
Very subtle whenever there
is a stop into the motion.

319
00:16:21,200 --> 00:16:24,040
So I've been animating the nose,

320
00:16:24,040 --> 00:16:28,410
the ears and the eyes using
the straight-ahead method.

321
00:16:28,410 --> 00:16:32,350
And it's ideal for this
kind of secondary motion

322
00:16:32,350 --> 00:16:34,260
where you can't really predict

323
00:16:34,260 --> 00:16:37,610
where the heels are going to be rotating,

324
00:16:37,610 --> 00:16:39,830
where the nose is going to be,

325
00:16:39,830 --> 00:16:44,580
while you have all the other
controllers to polish first.

326
00:16:44,580 --> 00:16:47,770
This is the kind of motion
that is really hard to block

327
00:16:47,770 --> 00:16:49,360
or to predict.

328
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:51,800
This is a technique that I use a lot

329
00:16:51,800 --> 00:16:55,450
whenever I'm animating
fingers, for example,

330
00:16:55,450 --> 00:16:58,700
I will shape the end
ring, the blocking stage

331
00:16:58,700 --> 00:17:02,500
but I won't necessarily
put a lot of detail

332
00:17:02,500 --> 00:17:05,630
during the breakdowns and stuff like that.

333
00:17:05,630 --> 00:17:08,900
Since a lot of things can
happen in the animation

334
00:17:08,900 --> 00:17:11,830
of the eyes, the fingers, the ears,

335
00:17:11,830 --> 00:17:14,080
the ponytail, whatever,

336
00:17:14,080 --> 00:17:18,300
all those secondary
elements of a character,

337
00:17:18,300 --> 00:17:22,380
I oftenly animate them using
the straight ahead method

338
00:17:22,380 --> 00:17:27,090
meaning that I've blocked my
character, or least most of it.

339
00:17:27,090 --> 00:17:32,090
And then on top of this, I will
add those additional motion

340
00:17:32,540 --> 00:17:34,890
or additional animation

341
00:17:34,890 --> 00:17:38,520
that are currently following the broad

342
00:17:38,520 --> 00:17:41,170
and main animation of your character.

343
00:17:41,170 --> 00:17:44,010
And you've probably,
haven't seen me working

344
00:17:44,010 --> 00:17:46,120
on each curve of those controllers

345
00:17:46,120 --> 00:17:48,110
and that's perfectly fine.

346
00:17:48,110 --> 00:17:51,870
At some point you don't
need to polish each curve.

347
00:17:51,870 --> 00:17:55,440
You can simply watch the
animation and watch the spacing

348
00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:59,320
in the 3D viewport and
see if it does work.

349
00:17:59,320 --> 00:18:02,350
Curved editing is super important

350
00:18:02,350 --> 00:18:06,400
but it's not mandatory
for every controllers.

351
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:08,750
So I rapidly polish the hips

352
00:18:08,750 --> 00:18:11,650
because it was mainly compensating

353
00:18:11,650 --> 00:18:13,290
the motion of the character

354
00:18:13,290 --> 00:18:15,200
or the movement of the character.

355
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:17,510
And I can now switch my attention

356
00:18:17,510 --> 00:18:18,685
to the feet of the character.

357
00:18:18,685 --> 00:18:19,568
(air whooshing)

358
00:18:19,568 --> 00:18:22,430
I tend to be kind of
lazy whenever I'm working

359
00:18:22,430 --> 00:18:23,970
on the feet of character.

360
00:18:23,970 --> 00:18:26,170
And that's a very big mistake.

361
00:18:26,170 --> 00:18:27,940
So this is one of the thing

362
00:18:27,940 --> 00:18:31,120
I'm trying to improve in my animation.

363
00:18:31,120 --> 00:18:33,820
Feet tend to have a lot of motion

364
00:18:33,820 --> 00:18:38,710
and a lot of beginner tend to
keep them still on the ground.

365
00:18:38,710 --> 00:18:40,300
So you should avoid it.

366
00:18:40,300 --> 00:18:43,290
Whenever you feel like your
character is losing balance

367
00:18:43,290 --> 00:18:45,310
maybe offset a bit the foot

368
00:18:45,310 --> 00:18:48,800
and create some kind of very small step.

369
00:18:48,800 --> 00:18:52,380
One of the very important
thing regarding walks

370
00:18:52,380 --> 00:18:54,800
and whatever kind of steps you are doing,

371
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:58,810
is that any character,
whether it's an animal

372
00:18:58,810 --> 00:19:02,460
or a human being will try to put as less

373
00:19:02,460 --> 00:19:05,170
energy into it as possible,

374
00:19:05,170 --> 00:19:10,090
meaning that you will raise
your leg as less as possible.

375
00:19:10,090 --> 00:19:12,330
When we see the original motion path

376
00:19:12,330 --> 00:19:13,750
shown on the screen right now,

377
00:19:13,750 --> 00:19:16,920
we can see that I had
the very eye position

378
00:19:16,920 --> 00:19:18,950
of the foot on frame 14.

379
00:19:18,950 --> 00:19:21,940
This is why I edited the Z curve

380
00:19:21,940 --> 00:19:23,530
of the location of the foot.

381
00:19:23,530 --> 00:19:24,410
And when I update,

382
00:19:24,410 --> 00:19:27,870
you can see that now the
curve is looking a bit better.

383
00:19:27,870 --> 00:19:30,630
The forward spacing is a little weird

384
00:19:30,630 --> 00:19:33,660
because I have a big
acceleration on the Y curve

385
00:19:33,660 --> 00:19:35,367
and then it slowed down.

386
00:19:35,367 --> 00:19:39,040
So I'm kind of flattening
them with the Y curve

387
00:19:39,040 --> 00:19:43,550
and also lowering the foot
just before the contact pose.

388
00:19:43,550 --> 00:19:45,800
When the foot was moving forward,

389
00:19:45,800 --> 00:19:47,830
I edited the rotation of the curve

390
00:19:47,830 --> 00:19:52,200
so that it just drags a bit backward.

391
00:19:52,200 --> 00:19:54,740
And then when it's
contacting on the ground,

392
00:19:54,740 --> 00:19:57,920
I will slightly raise it to have this kind

393
00:19:57,920 --> 00:20:00,840
of slap motion only on one frame.

394
00:20:00,840 --> 00:20:02,430
That's perfectly fine,

395
00:20:02,430 --> 00:20:05,380
but we will feel this
is a very important tip

396
00:20:05,380 --> 00:20:07,950
that will make your animation
looks a little better.

397
00:20:07,950 --> 00:20:10,030
Whenever you are doing a step

398
00:20:10,030 --> 00:20:13,820
whether for a whole cycle
or an animation like that,

399
00:20:13,820 --> 00:20:17,980
you should avoid flat curve
on the rotation channels

400
00:20:17,980 --> 00:20:21,250
during the contact pose on frame 16.

401
00:20:21,250 --> 00:20:25,590
Having it flat on the next
frame is totally fine.

402
00:20:25,590 --> 00:20:29,530
There is always a bit of
control of foot slapping

403
00:20:29,530 --> 00:20:33,600
on one or two frame, and
then the curve get flat.

404
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:36,350
So as this first step is polished,

405
00:20:36,350 --> 00:20:39,620
I can work on the elbow
joint of my character

406
00:20:39,620 --> 00:20:42,200
as the front leg get over extended.

407
00:20:42,200 --> 00:20:44,700
It seems to be bending the wrong way,

408
00:20:44,700 --> 00:20:48,860
so I will just frame by
frame, push a bit back

409
00:20:48,860 --> 00:20:53,600
this tweaker your controller,
just to get a slight bending.

410
00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:56,160
I don't need to care about the curve here,

411
00:20:56,160 --> 00:20:59,187
I'm just caring about the
shape of my character.

412
00:20:59,187 --> 00:21:00,020
(air whooshing)

413
00:21:00,020 --> 00:21:02,520
All right, let's move
on the left front leg

414
00:21:02,520 --> 00:21:04,290
or left hand if you will.

415
00:21:04,290 --> 00:21:06,490
The first thing I will do as usual

416
00:21:06,490 --> 00:21:09,500
is calculate the path of this hand

417
00:21:09,500 --> 00:21:11,750
and it has really become an automatism

418
00:21:11,750 --> 00:21:14,880
for me to use the motion
path in production.

419
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:16,950
With it, I can see right away

420
00:21:16,950 --> 00:21:20,710
that the motion of the
foot is not correct.

421
00:21:20,710 --> 00:21:22,610
The arc as in it's shape

422
00:21:22,610 --> 00:21:26,730
where I'd like it to have
more of a C-shape forward.

423
00:21:26,730 --> 00:21:29,400
I'd like to create a foot roll motion

424
00:21:29,400 --> 00:21:33,060
on the next frame from
the tip of the foot.

425
00:21:33,060 --> 00:21:34,370
So from the side view,

426
00:21:34,370 --> 00:21:38,760
I shift right click on
to the tip of the foot.

427
00:21:38,760 --> 00:21:40,890
Then I will switch the pivot point

428
00:21:40,890 --> 00:21:43,030
to be using the 3D cursor.

429
00:21:43,030 --> 00:21:45,930
And I will rotate the foot forward.

430
00:21:45,930 --> 00:21:49,050
Since this is a pose I would spend time

431
00:21:49,050 --> 00:21:51,570
to get right, using the graph editor.

432
00:21:51,570 --> 00:21:55,210
It's better to pose it
directly in the 3D view.

433
00:21:55,210 --> 00:21:59,010
So is that Blender will
write the curves for me.

434
00:21:59,010 --> 00:22:02,900
And then I just need to polish
using this in-between curve

435
00:22:02,900 --> 00:22:04,570
we've just created.

436
00:22:04,570 --> 00:22:07,020
From there, I have enough information

437
00:22:07,020 --> 00:22:08,810
to start polishing the curve

438
00:22:08,810 --> 00:22:12,480
working first on the Z and Y location,

439
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:16,320
here I'm building a slight
overshoot on the Y axis

440
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:19,980
so that the character will
push his hand forward.

441
00:22:19,980 --> 00:22:24,039
And then the back as it
reaches the highest point

442
00:22:24,039 --> 00:22:26,900
and they will update my motion path to see

443
00:22:26,900 --> 00:22:29,390
if my arch is looking good.

444
00:22:29,390 --> 00:22:31,736
And then I will slightly tweak

445
00:22:31,736 --> 00:22:36,270
the plateau shape of the Y and Z curve

446
00:22:36,270 --> 00:22:40,510
to avoid having a pure holding here.

447
00:22:40,510 --> 00:22:43,530
I want to add a slight moving hold

448
00:22:43,530 --> 00:22:47,560
so that the hand feels
connected to the body

449
00:22:47,560 --> 00:22:49,270
that is still moving.

450
00:22:49,270 --> 00:22:53,900
The left-to-right motion of the
front foot is pretty subtle.

451
00:22:53,900 --> 00:22:57,240
So I will just smooth out the curve

452
00:22:57,240 --> 00:23:01,130
and input a bit of an
overshoot on frame 20

453
00:23:01,130 --> 00:23:04,710
and a bit up jiggle on frame 25.

454
00:23:04,710 --> 00:23:07,643
So when I polish to location
channel, for example,

455
00:23:07,643 --> 00:23:11,510
I always double check my animation
through different angles.

456
00:23:11,510 --> 00:23:13,630
I also play the hold section.

457
00:23:13,630 --> 00:23:15,050
I'm polishing to make sure

458
00:23:15,050 --> 00:23:19,440
that everything looks
connected and relevant.

459
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:22,010
From there, I can work on the rotation.

460
00:23:22,010 --> 00:23:27,010
So why the rotation is the
main motion of this front leg

461
00:23:27,300 --> 00:23:29,800
on this part on the animation,

462
00:23:29,800 --> 00:23:33,030
polishing the rotation of
the front foot or the hand

463
00:23:33,030 --> 00:23:37,000
of the character will
really improve the motion.

464
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:40,550
So I'm just mainly working on the X

465
00:23:40,550 --> 00:23:45,340
but only on rotation first,
adding a bit of dragging.

466
00:23:45,340 --> 00:23:49,480
Then I work on the Y and
Z pattern on rotation

467
00:23:49,480 --> 00:23:53,580
just to add a bit of twisting
and a bit of dragging

468
00:23:53,580 --> 00:23:56,830
on the left and right motion of the hand.

469
00:23:56,830 --> 00:23:57,940
And the here again,

470
00:23:57,940 --> 00:24:01,550
I will bend a slight
overshoot on the curve.

471
00:24:01,550 --> 00:24:04,850
So you can see that curve
wise in the graph editor

472
00:24:05,850 --> 00:24:09,830
you will often get the same kind of shape

473
00:24:09,830 --> 00:24:12,370
the same curve behavior.

474
00:24:12,370 --> 00:24:14,993
So don't be afraid by the graph editor

475
00:24:14,993 --> 00:24:18,400
this is something you will
get used to very fast,

476
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:19,639
if you practice.

477
00:24:19,639 --> 00:24:20,472
(air whooshing)

478
00:24:20,472 --> 00:24:22,730
Polishing the tail was
pretty straightforward

479
00:24:22,730 --> 00:24:26,650
as it is mostly a follow
through animation.

480
00:24:26,650 --> 00:24:29,510
So I do believe you now understand

481
00:24:29,510 --> 00:24:32,070
that I always work with the channel

482
00:24:32,070 --> 00:24:34,700
that input the most motion.

483
00:24:34,700 --> 00:24:39,060
This is why I stopped
with the X rotation curve.

484
00:24:39,060 --> 00:24:41,490
So this is a pretty different behavior

485
00:24:41,490 --> 00:24:43,960
compared with the run cycle

486
00:24:43,960 --> 00:24:47,230
or the gym cycle we've made before.

487
00:24:47,230 --> 00:24:50,660
Here, I want faster whipping motion,

488
00:24:50,660 --> 00:24:53,540
meaning that the motion of the tail

489
00:24:53,540 --> 00:24:57,680
is not supporting the
movement of the character.

490
00:24:57,680 --> 00:25:00,171
It's not drawing the shape

491
00:25:00,171 --> 00:25:04,600
and the path of the
character through space.

492
00:25:04,600 --> 00:25:09,550
I'm using the tail here with
fast and snapping motion

493
00:25:09,550 --> 00:25:12,160
to show the attitude of the character.

494
00:25:12,160 --> 00:25:13,980
When we watched the reference,

495
00:25:13,980 --> 00:25:16,860
we can see that the tail move very quickly

496
00:25:16,860 --> 00:25:18,640
and then just stop.

497
00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:23,640
So I want those the little wavey
motion to happen very fast.

498
00:25:24,570 --> 00:25:27,410
On the first contact,
the motion of the tail

499
00:25:27,410 --> 00:25:30,790
is here to balance the character.

500
00:25:30,790 --> 00:25:32,490
But as soon as he stop,

501
00:25:32,490 --> 00:25:37,490
the tail motion will be mostly
used to show the character

502
00:25:37,530 --> 00:25:39,890
the emotion of our character

503
00:25:39,890 --> 00:25:43,280
whether he's happy, curious, or whatever.

504
00:25:43,280 --> 00:25:46,240
And having those rapid change

505
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:47,920
in the shape of the tail

506
00:25:47,920 --> 00:25:51,110
really translate the fast pace

507
00:25:51,110 --> 00:25:56,110
of the metabolism of small
mammals, like the squirrel,

508
00:25:56,220 --> 00:25:58,460
the mouse, et cetera.

509
00:25:58,460 --> 00:26:02,480
If you think of the tail
of a cow or an elephant

510
00:26:02,480 --> 00:26:07,000
it can move quickly, but
it won't stop instantly.

511
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:08,470
There will be inertia.

512
00:26:08,470 --> 00:26:11,060
There will be follow through animation.

513
00:26:11,060 --> 00:26:13,140
While on this character,

514
00:26:13,140 --> 00:26:14,820
the follow through might be like

515
00:26:14,820 --> 00:26:16,600
on two or three frame maximum

516
00:26:16,600 --> 00:26:19,010
and you just freezing the hair.

517
00:26:19,010 --> 00:26:22,100
So I'm repeating the same
concept again and again

518
00:26:22,100 --> 00:26:24,620
but all of those follow through animation

519
00:26:24,620 --> 00:26:27,670
can translate the weight of your character

520
00:26:27,670 --> 00:26:29,330
or the stiffness.

521
00:26:29,330 --> 00:26:33,300
Here, for example, while
the tail is very flexible

522
00:26:33,300 --> 00:26:35,784
at some point it's full of muscle

523
00:26:35,784 --> 00:26:39,750
and our character can
kind of hold it in place.

524
00:26:39,750 --> 00:26:42,360
Like whip it's tail and it stop it.

525
00:26:42,360 --> 00:26:45,470
And I think this is a very specific motion

526
00:26:45,470 --> 00:26:49,080
of the squirrel tail that
will make it more believable

527
00:26:49,080 --> 00:26:54,070
or at least that will input
this squirrel-like motion

528
00:26:54,070 --> 00:26:56,840
to our digital character.

529
00:26:56,840 --> 00:26:59,520
On those fast-paced motion,

530
00:26:59,520 --> 00:27:03,390
It's pretty hard to get a nice tail shape.

531
00:27:03,390 --> 00:27:06,160
And this is why on this specific part

532
00:27:06,160 --> 00:27:08,653
I'm almost animating on the ones.

533
00:27:09,570 --> 00:27:14,210
It means that I have a key
frame on almost each frame.

534
00:27:14,210 --> 00:27:17,370
This is what animating on ones means,

535
00:27:17,370 --> 00:27:19,960
is that you will have a different pose

536
00:27:19,960 --> 00:27:24,580
or different key frame on
each frame of your animation.

537
00:27:24,580 --> 00:27:26,920
When animating digitally,

538
00:27:26,920 --> 00:27:30,020
we kind of always animate on ones

539
00:27:30,020 --> 00:27:31,587
meaning that our character

540
00:27:31,587 --> 00:27:34,520
has a different pose on each frame

541
00:27:34,520 --> 00:27:39,490
but when animating traditionally
or making 2D drawings

542
00:27:39,490 --> 00:27:43,370
it happened sometime that you
will keep the same drawing

543
00:27:43,370 --> 00:27:45,710
on one, two or three frames.

544
00:27:45,710 --> 00:27:49,860
In this case, you will be
animating on two or on three.

545
00:27:49,860 --> 00:27:53,530
So it's not correct to say
that I'm animating on ones

546
00:27:53,530 --> 00:27:57,280
because I'm putting a
key frame on each frame

547
00:27:57,280 --> 00:28:00,460
but that's kind of a way of talking

548
00:28:00,460 --> 00:28:02,730
or saying that at some point,

549
00:28:02,730 --> 00:28:07,380
you might need to detail
your animation on ones

550
00:28:07,380 --> 00:28:10,410
and insert a key frame on every frame.

551
00:28:10,410 --> 00:28:15,410
And for each of those poses,
especially on action motion

552
00:28:16,540 --> 00:28:18,370
or on very fast motion

553
00:28:18,370 --> 00:28:21,080
like the tail motion of your character.

554
00:28:21,080 --> 00:28:25,020
In the end of polishing the
segment of the animation

555
00:28:25,020 --> 00:28:28,760
I've been working with the
tweaker bone of the back leg

556
00:28:28,760 --> 00:28:33,290
to keep the back leg
slightly bent the right way,

557
00:28:33,290 --> 00:28:35,360
slightly bent forward.

558
00:28:35,360 --> 00:28:39,510
That was kind of a long video
with a lot of information.

559
00:28:39,510 --> 00:28:42,653
I will keep the next one
as short as possible.
