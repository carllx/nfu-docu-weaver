00:00:01,020 --> 00:00:02,660
- [Pierre] As any Blender editor,

2
00:00:02,660 --> 00:00:06,560
you can navigate in the timeline
using your middle mouse.

3
00:00:06,560 --> 00:00:09,840
You can move selected items by pressing G,

4
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:11,720
you can scale them using S,

5
00:00:11,720 --> 00:00:15,010
which will push them
further from the play head.

6
00:00:15,010 --> 00:00:18,030
But pressing R won't rotate the key frame.

7
00:00:18,030 --> 00:00:19,520
What it will do instead,

8
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:22,210
it will all you to change
the key frame type.

9
00:00:22,210 --> 00:00:26,490
Changing the key frame type
won't affect your animation.

10
00:00:26,490 --> 00:00:30,630
It's only a visual
modification of your key frames

11
00:00:30,630 --> 00:00:34,500
that may allow you to better
organize your animation.

12
00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:37,040
I personally never use it
(drowned out by whooshing)

13
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:39,900
Pressing the zero key on the numpad

14
00:00:39,900 --> 00:00:44,350
will center your timeline
position around the play head.

15
00:00:44,350 --> 00:00:46,350
When you have some key selected,

16
00:00:46,350 --> 00:00:49,390
pressing the dot key on the numpad

17
00:00:49,390 --> 00:00:52,343
will frame or focus the selection.

18
00:00:53,210 --> 00:00:57,740
Pressing the home key will
frame the whole animation

19
00:00:57,740 --> 00:01:01,660
from the very first to
the very last key frame.

20
00:01:01,660 --> 00:01:05,470
You can preview a part of
your animation by pressing P

21
00:01:05,470 --> 00:01:09,010
and dragging and hold on the
section you want to repeat.

22
00:01:09,010 --> 00:01:11,550
Press Alt + P to clear the preview.

23
00:01:11,550 --> 00:01:13,610
You can activate the preview range

24
00:01:13,610 --> 00:01:15,820
by clicking the clock icon

25
00:01:15,820 --> 00:01:19,323
and then setting the
starting and ending frame.

26
00:01:24,350 --> 00:01:27,360
You can set the beginning
of your animation,

27
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:29,230
pressing Control + Home.

28
00:01:29,230 --> 00:01:32,580
And you can set the end by
pressing Control + Home.

29
00:01:32,580 --> 00:01:34,760
When you activate the preview range

30
00:01:34,760 --> 00:01:37,740
with the clock icon is
using Control + Home

31
00:01:37,740 --> 00:01:41,670
and Control + Home, will set
the beginning and the end

32
00:01:41,670 --> 00:01:43,300
of the preview range.

33
00:01:43,300 --> 00:01:46,070
My timeline here is just showing me

34
00:01:46,070 --> 00:01:48,860
the key frame of the selected items.

35
00:01:48,860 --> 00:01:52,660
If I go into view and
uncheck only key frames

36
00:01:52,660 --> 00:01:54,100
from selected object,

37
00:01:54,100 --> 00:01:57,070
every key frame in the
scene will be displayed.

38
00:01:57,070 --> 00:02:00,750
My character currently I've
a subdivision modifier.

39
00:02:00,750 --> 00:02:03,210
If I go to the rendering properties,

40
00:02:03,210 --> 00:02:06,740
I can see that simplify
has been activated.

41
00:02:06,740 --> 00:02:10,640
It allows you to disable
every subdivision modifier

42
00:02:10,640 --> 00:02:14,910
in the scene, increasing
the playback performances.

43
00:02:14,910 --> 00:02:18,600
When deactivated, we can
see that my frame range

44
00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:21,230
in the top left corner turned to red

45
00:02:21,230 --> 00:02:25,430
meaning that Blender is not
able to reach the frame rate

46
00:02:25,430 --> 00:02:27,130
I've set previously.

47
00:02:27,130 --> 00:02:31,320
While this scene is supposed
to run at 30 frames per second,

48
00:02:31,320 --> 00:02:34,270
here I am below 14 frames per second.

49
00:02:34,270 --> 00:02:35,760
While it is not optimal,

50
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:38,450
Blender allow us to drop frames

51
00:02:38,450 --> 00:02:42,000
so that we have a bit sort
of timing of the animation,

52
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,730
meaning that it will
drop some of the frame

53
00:02:44,730 --> 00:02:48,330
to make sure that the
action run at the same speed

54
00:02:48,330 --> 00:02:51,780
as if we were displaying
the 30 frames per seconds.

55
00:02:51,780 --> 00:02:54,870
To allow this, just go
to the playback option,

56
00:02:54,870 --> 00:02:59,110
to the no sync and choose
whether frame drop or AV sync.

57
00:02:59,110 --> 00:03:02,170
We can see that the
animation timing has changed

58
00:03:02,170 --> 00:03:06,430
and it's trying to catch
up with its regular speed.

59
00:03:06,430 --> 00:03:09,110
Hopefully you won't
need to use this option

60
00:03:09,110 --> 00:03:12,550
as I will try to provide
pretty low poly characters

61
00:03:12,550 --> 00:03:16,200
to be animated, but it's
important to note it.

62
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:18,590
With Control + Shift, plus left click,

63
00:03:18,590 --> 00:03:23,590
you can select all the keys
after or before the play head.

64
00:03:24,130 --> 00:03:28,290
You can press B click and drag
or just left click and drag

65
00:03:28,290 --> 00:03:30,330
to make a box selection.

66
00:03:30,330 --> 00:03:32,050
The timeline is mainly here

67
00:03:32,050 --> 00:03:35,210
to give you an overview of your animation.

68
00:03:35,210 --> 00:03:38,700
I never use it to work
on my current key frame.

69
00:03:38,700 --> 00:03:41,810
The summary line is
just here to let me know

70
00:03:41,810 --> 00:03:44,820
if there are a key frame
on the current frame.

71
00:03:44,820 --> 00:03:48,780
Here, we can see we have a key
frame on every single frame

72
00:03:48,780 --> 00:03:50,850
from zero to 30.

73
00:03:50,850 --> 00:03:53,970
This key frame belongs
to different controller

74
00:03:53,970 --> 00:03:58,510
of our character and are
stored into an action

75
00:03:58,510 --> 00:04:00,930
that is torn into the armature.

76
00:04:00,930 --> 00:04:03,770
We will discuss about armature later on,

77
00:04:03,770 --> 00:04:07,850
here I just want to show you
the IRO key of the timeline.

78
00:04:07,850 --> 00:04:11,560
If I add a cube to the scene
and add key frames to this cube

79
00:04:11,560 --> 00:04:15,080
you can see that now these
keys are also displayed

80
00:04:15,080 --> 00:04:16,370
in the timeline.

81
00:04:16,370 --> 00:04:19,520
Selecting a key on the summary

82
00:04:19,520 --> 00:04:21,760
will select all the corresponding keys

83
00:04:21,760 --> 00:04:23,980
of the armature and the cube.

84
00:04:23,980 --> 00:04:28,230
This can be great to
offset a whole set of keys.

85
00:04:28,230 --> 00:04:31,250
But if we want, we can
only move, for example,

86
00:04:31,250 --> 00:04:33,793
the X location key of the cube.

87
00:04:36,020 --> 00:04:38,730
Another great feature of the timeline

88
00:04:38,730 --> 00:04:41,050
is that we can add markers.

89
00:04:41,050 --> 00:04:45,440
While you can use them only
for organization's sake,

90
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:49,090
they can be very useful to switch camera.

91
00:04:49,090 --> 00:04:51,660
When you add two camera
into your Blender scene

92
00:04:51,660 --> 00:04:54,740
and press zero to go into camera view,

93
00:04:54,740 --> 00:04:57,620
you can switch from
one camera to the other

94
00:04:57,620 --> 00:04:59,620
into the scene options.

95
00:04:59,620 --> 00:05:02,820
But if you will, you
can go in the timeline

96
00:05:02,820 --> 00:05:05,640
and add a couple of markers.

97
00:05:05,640 --> 00:05:10,370
You can add them pressing M or
going to Marker, Add Marker.

98
00:05:10,370 --> 00:05:13,260
Now, with one of my camera selected

99
00:05:13,260 --> 00:05:15,480
and one of the marker selected,

100
00:05:15,480 --> 00:05:19,400
I will go to marker and
bind camera to marker.

101
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:21,990
Now I will select the second marker,

102
00:05:21,990 --> 00:05:25,760
select the second camera
and repeat the process

103
00:05:25,760 --> 00:05:28,550
or press Control + B in the timeline.

104
00:05:28,550 --> 00:05:30,550
In the 3D viewport, pressing zero,

105
00:05:30,550 --> 00:05:32,450
I will jump into camera view.

106
00:05:32,450 --> 00:05:35,150
And when I will play the animation,

107
00:05:35,150 --> 00:05:37,850
each time I will hit those marker,

108
00:05:37,850 --> 00:05:41,530
Blender will automatically
switch to the bound camera.

109
00:05:41,530 --> 00:05:43,860
This is way easier and cleaner

110
00:05:43,860 --> 00:05:46,500
than trying to animate the camera.

111
00:05:46,500 --> 00:05:49,870
To summarize, we have seen
that navigating the timeline

112
00:05:49,870 --> 00:05:53,280
is close to navigating
any Blender editors.

113
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:56,840
We have seen a bunch
of different shortcuts.

114
00:05:56,840 --> 00:06:00,050
And we have seen that we
can create different markers

115
00:06:00,050 --> 00:06:04,220
in the timeline and bind
the multiple cameras to them

116
00:06:04,220 --> 00:06:07,480
so that we can jump from
one camera to the other

117
00:06:07,480 --> 00:06:09,953
directly through the animation.
