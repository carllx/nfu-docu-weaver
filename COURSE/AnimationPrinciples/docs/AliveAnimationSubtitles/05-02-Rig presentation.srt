1
00:00:00,590 --> 00:00:02,730
- Let me present to you the new character

2
00:00:02,730 --> 00:00:05,650
we will be using called Tridents.

3
00:00:05,650 --> 00:00:09,950
You will find in the
chapter five file folder,

4
00:00:09,950 --> 00:00:13,140
the file called Trident rig final.

5
00:00:13,140 --> 00:00:16,811
It's a new character rig
that is quite more complex

6
00:00:16,811 --> 00:00:19,490
that one we add before.

7
00:00:19,490 --> 00:00:23,490
Fortunately, the UI has
been properly organized

8
00:00:23,490 --> 00:00:24,980
by my friend, Fin.

9
00:00:24,980 --> 00:00:27,400
If you don't get this specific UI,

10
00:00:27,400 --> 00:00:29,530
just open the text editor,

11
00:00:29,530 --> 00:00:33,250
open the TRIDENT_riggy.py

12
00:00:33,250 --> 00:00:35,430
search for the file in the library

13
00:00:35,430 --> 00:00:37,150
and press the play button.

14
00:00:37,150 --> 00:00:41,100
The register option under
text should be enabled.

15
00:00:41,100 --> 00:00:45,240
You will find a UI that is
very close to what we add from

16
00:00:45,240 --> 00:00:47,334
the squirrel character and the Mac,

17
00:00:47,334 --> 00:00:50,060
allowing us to show our ID,

18
00:00:50,060 --> 00:00:52,910
the different controllers
of the character.

19
00:00:52,910 --> 00:00:55,640
Starting with the root bone as usual.

20
00:00:55,640 --> 00:00:59,400
But before, let's have
a look at the outliner.

21
00:00:59,400 --> 00:01:03,300
We have a master collection
called Trident character,

22
00:01:03,300 --> 00:01:06,070
including two secondary collection.

23
00:01:06,070 --> 00:01:09,290
One including the rig and the other

24
00:01:09,290 --> 00:01:12,690
including the different
parts of the character.

25
00:01:12,690 --> 00:01:14,640
The character himself,

26
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:17,990
but also the weapons he has.

27
00:01:17,990 --> 00:01:22,330
By default, the character
is shaded in solid mode,

28
00:01:22,330 --> 00:01:25,350
showing its diffuse texture.

29
00:01:25,350 --> 00:01:27,660
You can switch to previous mode

30
00:01:27,660 --> 00:01:30,680
to see the full rendered character.

31
00:01:30,680 --> 00:01:34,330
If at some point you
see a bright pink color,

32
00:01:34,330 --> 00:01:37,930
it means that one of the texture is lost.

33
00:01:37,930 --> 00:01:40,640
All the character's textures can be find

34
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:45,030
in the textures folder
of chapter five folder.

35
00:01:45,030 --> 00:01:48,040
The texture path is set to relative,

36
00:01:48,040 --> 00:01:52,760
so if you keep your blend file
close to the texture folder,

37
00:01:52,760 --> 00:01:54,140
you will never lose them.

38
00:01:54,140 --> 00:01:55,800
Let's have a look to the rig.

39
00:01:55,800 --> 00:01:59,100
For this rig, I've created
two different roots.

40
00:01:59,100 --> 00:02:02,280
One master and a secondary root.

41
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:05,310
It can be useful in certain cases.

42
00:02:05,310 --> 00:02:06,840
Let's have a look to the torso.

43
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:11,740
We have a master controller
as for our squirrel character

44
00:02:11,740 --> 00:02:14,390
and then the controller for the hips

45
00:02:14,390 --> 00:02:16,740
and a controller for the chest.

46
00:02:16,740 --> 00:02:19,840
You will also find a
controller for the neck

47
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:20,930
and the head.

48
00:02:20,930 --> 00:02:23,910
All those controllers
can be freely rotated,

49
00:02:23,910 --> 00:02:26,270
scaled, or translated.

50
00:02:26,270 --> 00:02:28,853
When activating the torso tweak layer,

51
00:02:28,853 --> 00:02:33,810
you will be able to access
those yellow round controllers.

52
00:02:33,810 --> 00:02:38,320
These are tweaker bone that
will allow you to modify

53
00:02:38,320 --> 00:02:41,600
the shape of each joint of the character.

54
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:43,810
It's perfect to fix some poses

55
00:02:43,810 --> 00:02:46,560
or create squash and stretch effects.

56
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:49,030
All the yellow controllers
on the character

57
00:02:50,057 --> 00:02:51,470
are tweaker bones.

58
00:02:51,470 --> 00:02:54,810
This torso tweak layer
also give you access

59
00:02:54,810 --> 00:02:57,590
to secondary controller of the torso

60
00:02:57,590 --> 00:03:01,470
that uses a forward
kinematic for each joint.

61
00:03:01,470 --> 00:03:04,700
Splitting the hips
controller into two parts,

62
00:03:04,700 --> 00:03:07,430
the chest controller into three parts,

63
00:03:07,430 --> 00:03:10,260
the neck and head in one part each.

64
00:03:10,260 --> 00:03:12,120
The face layer will give you access

65
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:15,340
to the main face controllers,
including the jaw,

66
00:03:15,340 --> 00:03:17,830
the nose, the mouth, the cheek

67
00:03:17,830 --> 00:03:19,990
that can be moved individually

68
00:03:19,990 --> 00:03:22,620
to shape the face of
the character at will.

69
00:03:22,620 --> 00:03:25,600
The eyes and eyebrow of the character

70
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:27,850
have automated shapes.

71
00:03:27,850 --> 00:03:32,490
They can be moved up and
down or on the local y-axis

72
00:03:32,490 --> 00:03:36,040
to get to different
shape, like a happy face

73
00:03:36,040 --> 00:03:37,586
a frown, a surprise,

74
00:03:37,586 --> 00:03:41,870
following you to rapidly
create different stereotyped

75
00:03:41,870 --> 00:03:44,410
expressions for your character.

76
00:03:44,410 --> 00:03:47,040
The face secondary, will give you access

77
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:49,650
to all the face tweaker bone.

78
00:03:49,650 --> 00:03:52,340
Allowing you to shape the eyes at will,

79
00:03:52,340 --> 00:03:55,873
rework the brow shape to
draw whatever you want.

80
00:03:56,730 --> 00:03:58,700
By default, the legs of the character

81
00:03:58,700 --> 00:04:01,430
use inverse kinematic mechanism,

82
00:04:01,430 --> 00:04:03,700
meaning that if you move the foot,

83
00:04:03,700 --> 00:04:06,300
the knee will automatically bend.

84
00:04:06,300 --> 00:04:08,700
It's the same behavior we had

85
00:04:08,700 --> 00:04:11,320
with the squirrel character controllers.

86
00:04:11,320 --> 00:04:14,060
The poles controller will allow you

87
00:04:14,060 --> 00:04:16,100
to orientate the knee at will.

88
00:04:16,100 --> 00:04:19,600
There is also a forward kinematic layer

89
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:22,170
and we will see or we
can switch from inverse

90
00:04:22,170 --> 00:04:24,990
to forward kinematic a little later on.

91
00:04:24,990 --> 00:04:29,490
You will also find our
yellow tweaker bones.

92
00:04:29,490 --> 00:04:33,800
The biggest one on the main
joint, like the ankles,

93
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:37,740
knee and hips will allow
you to reshape the whole leg

94
00:04:37,740 --> 00:04:40,790
based on its natural joint.

95
00:04:40,790 --> 00:04:44,570
While the secondary controllers
will allow you to completely

96
00:04:44,570 --> 00:04:48,420
modify the shape of the
leg to create rubber limbs.

97
00:04:48,420 --> 00:04:51,580
Very nice for cartoony animations.

98
00:04:51,580 --> 00:04:53,730
There are also a couple of controllers

99
00:04:53,730 --> 00:04:56,387
to reshape the butt of the character.

100
00:04:56,387 --> 00:04:59,520
And we will find the
same kind of arrow key

101
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:01,343
on the arm of the character.

102
00:05:02,324 --> 00:05:03,460
We will find the shoulder bones

103
00:05:03,460 --> 00:05:05,830
as being the root of the arms

104
00:05:05,830 --> 00:05:09,030
and then forward kinematic controllers,

105
00:05:09,030 --> 00:05:10,840
tweaker bones, etc.

106
00:05:10,840 --> 00:05:13,270
It's also possible there to switch

107
00:05:13,270 --> 00:05:16,860
between the forward kinematic
and inverse kinematic.

108
00:05:16,860 --> 00:05:18,860
We will check that in a few second

109
00:05:18,860 --> 00:05:21,610
when looking at the rig properties.

110
00:05:21,610 --> 00:05:24,579
The finger controller are
pretty straightforward.

111
00:05:24,579 --> 00:05:29,290
Near the pinkie, you will
find this master pan bone

112
00:05:29,290 --> 00:05:30,540
that will allow you

113
00:05:30,540 --> 00:05:34,550
to curve the whole palm of each hands.

114
00:05:34,550 --> 00:05:37,155
the same root will allow you to orientate

115
00:05:37,155 --> 00:05:42,155
the thumb and each finger
as its own master bone.

116
00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:46,600
On each finger, rotating
the second joint bone

117
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:51,600
will allow you to bend both
the second and third joint.

118
00:05:51,960 --> 00:05:55,480
Finally, each joint
can be rotated, scaled,

119
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:57,630
and moved at will.

120
00:05:57,630 --> 00:06:01,550
The different weapons,
are all both the same way.

121
00:06:01,550 --> 00:06:04,800
You will find a master
bone that more or less

122
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:07,400
have the shape of the current weapon.

123
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:11,400
Allowing you to orientate
Eaton's space and move it.

124
00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:14,721
Then, you will find a
forward kinematic chain

125
00:06:14,721 --> 00:06:19,460
that is ideal to curve the
weapons and give them nice shape

126
00:06:19,460 --> 00:06:23,240
whenever you are doing stylized animation.

127
00:06:23,240 --> 00:06:28,240
And as usual, the yellow bones
will be our tweaker bones.

128
00:06:28,310 --> 00:06:33,310
Moving them with allow you to
modify the shape of each joint

129
00:06:33,495 --> 00:06:35,870
of the different weapons.

130
00:06:35,870 --> 00:06:39,560
You can hide or unhide all
the tweaker controllers

131
00:06:39,560 --> 00:06:43,870
and layers using the eye
icon on the top right corner.

132
00:06:43,870 --> 00:06:45,920
Let's have a look to the rig property.

133
00:06:45,920 --> 00:06:49,230
The head follow and neck follow sliders

134
00:06:49,230 --> 00:06:51,780
allows you to enable or disable the fact

135
00:06:51,780 --> 00:06:54,950
that the neck is following the orientation

136
00:06:54,950 --> 00:06:56,460
of the chest or not.

137
00:06:56,460 --> 00:07:00,690
It's the same principle
regarding the head and the neck.

138
00:07:00,690 --> 00:07:04,780
If I disable the head follow
and I rotate the neck,

139
00:07:04,780 --> 00:07:07,920
the head stay in the same orientation.

140
00:07:07,920 --> 00:07:11,410
This is super useful for dance animations

141
00:07:11,410 --> 00:07:13,561
or run cycles, for example.

142
00:07:13,561 --> 00:07:16,170
And then we will find the same option

143
00:07:16,170 --> 00:07:19,030
for the arm and the legs.

144
00:07:19,030 --> 00:07:22,810
When enabling arm follow,
we can see that now

145
00:07:22,810 --> 00:07:26,980
the arms are following the
rotation of the shoulders.

146
00:07:26,980 --> 00:07:30,790
While when disabled, they will
keep their own orientation,

147
00:07:30,790 --> 00:07:35,150
making it easier to
stabilize their orientation.

148
00:07:35,150 --> 00:07:38,800
By default, the legs are
set to inverse kinematic.

149
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:42,160
This is perfect for any
contacting controller.

150
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:46,160
In this case, the legs
contacting with the ground.

151
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:48,680
But we can switch to forward kinematic

152
00:07:48,680 --> 00:07:50,960
by switching this value to zero.

153
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:55,300
We can see the leg snapping
into another position

154
00:07:55,300 --> 00:07:57,770
following the orientation

155
00:07:57,770 --> 00:08:00,180
of the forward kinematic controller,

156
00:08:00,180 --> 00:08:03,950
so it can be enabled in the layer system.

157
00:08:03,950 --> 00:08:06,670
This can be useful to draw nice arcs

158
00:08:06,670 --> 00:08:09,980
whenever your character
is making big jumps

159
00:08:09,980 --> 00:08:12,170
or kicking something for example.

160
00:08:12,170 --> 00:08:15,900
We will find exactly the same
mechanism for the other leg,

161
00:08:15,900 --> 00:08:17,740
but also for the arms.

162
00:08:17,740 --> 00:08:19,780
Setting the values to zero,

163
00:08:19,780 --> 00:08:22,210
will switch to forward kinematic.

164
00:08:22,210 --> 00:08:25,230
To one, will switch to inverse kinematic.

165
00:08:25,230 --> 00:08:29,480
By default the arm are using
forward kinematic mechanism,

166
00:08:29,480 --> 00:08:32,360
but you can switch to inverse kinematic.

167
00:08:32,360 --> 00:08:36,060
Again, this is super useful
whenever your character

168
00:08:36,060 --> 00:08:38,120
is contacting with something.

169
00:08:38,120 --> 00:08:40,320
When doing push ups, for example,

170
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:43,360
or interacting with another character.

171
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:47,420
You will find the parent option
for the legs and the arms.

172
00:08:47,420 --> 00:08:50,280
By default the leg inverse
kinematic controller

173
00:08:50,280 --> 00:08:53,230
are parented to the
root, so they don't move

174
00:08:53,230 --> 00:08:55,120
whenever the torso is moved.

175
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:57,400
And the pose target is independent.

176
00:08:57,400 --> 00:09:00,680
When switching the parenting value to one,

177
00:09:00,680 --> 00:09:03,940
the pole will be parented
to the foot controller.

178
00:09:03,940 --> 00:09:08,080
Meaning that rotating the foot
will also rotate the knee.

179
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:10,890
This is the method I generally use.

180
00:09:10,890 --> 00:09:15,720
Switching the value to two
will also parent the foot

181
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:19,830
to the torso controller,
but not to the hips.

182
00:09:19,830 --> 00:09:21,700
That can be useful whenever

183
00:09:21,700 --> 00:09:24,560
you make your character jump for example.

184
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:27,280
You will find the same option regarding

185
00:09:27,280 --> 00:09:30,300
the inverse kinematic arms controller,

186
00:09:30,300 --> 00:09:34,048
but only when one value
that allow you to parent

187
00:09:34,048 --> 00:09:38,770
the inverse kinematic
controllers to the torso root.

188
00:09:38,770 --> 00:09:41,090
Again, they won't follow the chest,

189
00:09:41,090 --> 00:09:43,370
but they will follow the torso root.

190
00:09:43,370 --> 00:09:47,052
I've heard the same kind of
mechanism for the weapons.

191
00:09:47,052 --> 00:09:51,360
Allowing you to whether
snap them to the left hand,

192
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:54,910
right hand or not snap them at all

193
00:09:54,910 --> 00:09:57,780
so that they can move freely in space.

194
00:09:57,780 --> 00:09:58,920
This can be useful

195
00:09:58,920 --> 00:10:02,400
whenever you want to throw
the weapon for example.

196
00:10:02,400 --> 00:10:05,630
The weapon emit option
will allow you to play

197
00:10:05,630 --> 00:10:09,260
with the strength of the
emission shader on the weapons.

198
00:10:09,260 --> 00:10:10,680
If you press play, you can see

199
00:10:10,680 --> 00:10:13,610
that the shader is currently animated.

200
00:10:13,610 --> 00:10:16,910
Bringing a magical touch to those weapons.

201
00:10:16,910 --> 00:10:20,780
On top of this, you will
find a weapon spawn option

202
00:10:20,780 --> 00:10:23,300
that will allow you to make the weapons

203
00:10:23,300 --> 00:10:26,770
progressively disappear or appear

204
00:10:26,770 --> 00:10:28,913
with a nice dissolve effect.

205
00:10:29,750 --> 00:10:31,550
As for the squirrel character,

206
00:10:31,550 --> 00:10:34,080
you will find visibility properties

207
00:10:34,080 --> 00:10:38,290
that allows you do hide
different part of the character,

208
00:10:38,290 --> 00:10:41,450
making its silhouette easier to read

209
00:10:41,450 --> 00:10:46,080
or allowing you to focus on
specific part when animating.

210
00:10:46,080 --> 00:10:50,960
Last but not least you
will find a snap utilities.

211
00:10:50,960 --> 00:10:52,620
This will allow you to change

212
00:10:52,620 --> 00:10:55,740
from inverse kinematic
to forward kinematic

213
00:10:55,740 --> 00:10:58,880
and also align the controllers together.

214
00:10:58,880 --> 00:11:03,040
Allowing a seamless switch
between the two mechanisms.

215
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:05,910
A disclaimer here. Due to the complexity

216
00:11:05,910 --> 00:11:09,490
of the rig mechanism and
the rubber limbs system,

217
00:11:09,490 --> 00:11:13,070
it can be sometimes not 100% accurate

218
00:11:13,070 --> 00:11:15,590
but the pose can be fixed in one second.

219
00:11:15,590 --> 00:11:18,120
And this is way faster
than trying to align

220
00:11:18,120 --> 00:11:19,680
the controller by hand.

221
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:21,840
I'm not used to have this in production

222
00:11:21,840 --> 00:11:23,463
so this is really a bonus.
