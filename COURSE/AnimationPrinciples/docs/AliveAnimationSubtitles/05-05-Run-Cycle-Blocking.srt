00:00:00,033 --> 00:00:01,110
- [Instructor] In this video,

2
00:00:01,110 --> 00:00:04,840
we will start the blocking
stage of our run cycle.

3
00:00:04,840 --> 00:00:06,620
To create this run cycle,

4
00:00:06,620 --> 00:00:09,290
we will mix the layered approach

5
00:00:09,290 --> 00:00:11,270
with the blocking approach.

6
00:00:11,270 --> 00:00:14,080
In this video, we will
create the main poses

7
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:16,603
before jumping into spline

8
00:00:16,603 --> 00:00:20,530
and polish each part
of the body one by one.

9
00:00:20,530 --> 00:00:23,730
Note that nothing is carved into stone

10
00:00:23,730 --> 00:00:28,560
and those poses might evolve
during the polishing stage.

11
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:32,310
It's important to use the
video reference you will gather

12
00:00:32,310 --> 00:00:33,980
on the internet

13
00:00:33,980 --> 00:00:36,130
and to guide you during
this blocking stage,

14
00:00:36,130 --> 00:00:37,730
I'm providing a picture

15
00:00:37,730 --> 00:00:39,710
with the different main poses.

16
00:00:39,710 --> 00:00:41,630
The last thing I'd like to address

17
00:00:41,630 --> 00:00:45,200
before we jump into it
is that most of the time,

18
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:47,550
I'm using global coordinates

19
00:00:47,550 --> 00:00:51,080
with individual origin for my manipulators

20
00:00:51,080 --> 00:00:53,440
but I often use local space,

21
00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:55,450
especially for the forearms

22
00:00:55,450 --> 00:00:57,950
that can rotate only along one axis.

23
00:00:57,950 --> 00:01:00,800
Though I generally press R to rotate

24
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:05,220
and then Z twice to switch to local space.

25
00:01:05,220 --> 00:01:08,850
This is why you will
often see me press Z, Y

26
00:01:08,850 --> 00:01:12,970
or X twice to switch from global to local.

27
00:01:12,970 --> 00:01:16,750
If you are used to work
with widget manipulators,

28
00:01:16,750 --> 00:01:21,490
then I advise you to directly
switch to local space.

29
00:01:21,490 --> 00:01:23,720
This way you will get more familiar

30
00:01:23,720 --> 00:01:25,990
with the controller alignment.

31
00:01:25,990 --> 00:01:29,420
I personally exclusively use a shortcut.

32
00:01:29,420 --> 00:01:32,730
This is why I often stay in global space.

33
00:01:32,730 --> 00:01:37,090
The idea is to create a
slightly stylized run cycle

34
00:01:37,090 --> 00:01:41,500
but the fundamentals of a
realistic venular run cycle

35
00:01:41,500 --> 00:01:42,650
will be there.

36
00:01:42,650 --> 00:01:45,165
Making it stylized will be mostly

37
00:01:45,165 --> 00:01:47,813
about contrasting the timing

38
00:01:47,813 --> 00:01:51,000
and exaggerating a bit the poses

39
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,170
but making it looks cool

40
00:01:53,170 --> 00:01:57,420
will require us to have a good physicality

41
00:01:57,420 --> 00:02:01,440
and realistic fundamentals,
so let's get started.

42
00:02:01,440 --> 00:02:03,360
The first thing we are going to do

43
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:06,620
is to link our character into the scene.

44
00:02:06,620 --> 00:02:09,510
So let's get rid of all the default object

45
00:02:09,510 --> 00:02:12,900
in our scene and then go to File, Link

46
00:02:12,900 --> 00:02:15,610
and in the chapter five file,

47
00:02:15,610 --> 00:02:20,610
you will find the
TRIDENT-CHARACTER RIG_final file.

48
00:02:20,760 --> 00:02:22,410
Go to Collection

49
00:02:22,410 --> 00:02:25,910
and choose the first
collection, TRIDENT-CHARACTER.

50
00:02:25,910 --> 00:02:27,550
Double click the collection

51
00:02:27,550 --> 00:02:29,810
and it will appear in the outliner.

52
00:02:29,810 --> 00:02:33,736
Now, to be able to expose
the rig of our character,

53
00:02:33,736 --> 00:02:36,593
unfold the imported collection

54
00:02:36,593 --> 00:02:39,560
and right click on the sub-collection,

55
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:41,580
go to ID Data

56
00:02:41,580 --> 00:02:45,910
and choose Add Library Override Hierarchy.

57
00:02:45,910 --> 00:02:48,790
This will give us access
to the current rig

58
00:02:48,790 --> 00:02:51,410
and the different object of the character

59
00:02:51,410 --> 00:02:53,520
and if any update were made

60
00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:55,920
on the original linked file,

61
00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:58,020
it will automatically update

62
00:02:58,020 --> 00:02:59,190
in your scene.

63
00:02:59,190 --> 00:03:01,710
We have now a new character collection

64
00:03:01,710 --> 00:03:03,430
with two sub-collection,

65
00:03:03,430 --> 00:03:06,540
including the rig and
the different models.

66
00:03:06,540 --> 00:03:10,810
We can get rid of the file
we've imported just before,

67
00:03:10,810 --> 00:03:14,170
the one with the orange collection icon.

68
00:03:14,170 --> 00:03:16,270
From there, we can select the rig,

69
00:03:16,270 --> 00:03:19,630
switch into pose mode by
pressing Control + Tab.

70
00:03:19,630 --> 00:03:20,858
Then when animating,

71
00:03:20,858 --> 00:03:24,920
I personally like to
switch the shading to flat

72
00:03:24,920 --> 00:03:27,250
with texture object

73
00:03:27,250 --> 00:03:30,740
and enable the cavity and shadows.

74
00:03:30,740 --> 00:03:32,830
In the 3D view properties panel,

75
00:03:32,830 --> 00:03:36,360
you will find the rig properties panel.

76
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:38,960
Here, in the visibility tab,

77
00:03:38,960 --> 00:03:42,420
you can disable the weapon's visibility.

78
00:03:42,420 --> 00:03:46,870
Set the length of our cycle, 24 frames.

79
00:03:46,870 --> 00:03:50,860
So I will go on frame zero
and press Control + Home

80
00:03:50,860 --> 00:03:55,230
and then go on frame 23
and press Control + End.

81
00:03:55,230 --> 00:03:58,570
Since from 24 on frame 0 will be the same,

82
00:03:58,570 --> 00:04:02,490
I don't want to read
from frame 0 to frame 24

83
00:04:02,490 --> 00:04:05,630
but jump from frame 23 to frame 0.

84
00:04:05,630 --> 00:04:07,690
There with the dope sheet opened,

85
00:04:07,690 --> 00:04:10,877
I will switch to the Action Editor

86
00:04:10,877 --> 00:04:15,877
and I will duplicate the current
animation called Keying Set

87
00:04:16,280 --> 00:04:20,030
to create our run blocking animation.

88
00:04:20,030 --> 00:04:22,570
Don't forget to click the shield icon

89
00:04:22,570 --> 00:04:27,060
to make sure you set a
fake user to the animation

90
00:04:27,060 --> 00:04:29,110
and won't lose it.

91
00:04:29,110 --> 00:04:30,960
Another thing I advise you to do

92
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:33,780
before we start blocking the animation

93
00:04:33,780 --> 00:04:38,340
is to create a second 3D
viewport in perspective,

94
00:04:38,340 --> 00:04:39,810
showing your character.

95
00:04:39,810 --> 00:04:43,440
While we generally animate
in autographic view,

96
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:46,510
that's always a good thing
to have a perspective view,

97
00:04:46,510 --> 00:04:48,890
just to preview the animation.

98
00:04:48,890 --> 00:04:52,280
So let's now create our first pose,

99
00:04:52,280 --> 00:04:54,970
the straight leg pose.

100
00:04:54,970 --> 00:04:56,760
This is the one where the front leg

101
00:04:56,760 --> 00:05:00,130
is getting straightened
just before contacting

102
00:05:00,130 --> 00:05:01,434
with the ground.

103
00:05:01,434 --> 00:05:04,107
The back leg is pointing backward

104
00:05:04,107 --> 00:05:07,100
and as seen in the video reference,

105
00:05:07,100 --> 00:05:11,200
the front arm has already
started swinging backward.

106
00:05:11,200 --> 00:05:13,580
So from a side view, you should be able

107
00:05:13,580 --> 00:05:15,840
to see both elbows.

108
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:18,290
Left shoulder is twisting forward

109
00:05:18,290 --> 00:05:21,477
and the hips are twisted
in the opposite direction.

110
00:05:21,477 --> 00:05:23,670
For the animation of this character,

111
00:05:23,670 --> 00:05:26,598
we will be using 30 frame per seconds.

112
00:05:26,598 --> 00:05:31,200
This is the usual frame rate
used in video games production.

113
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:33,830
And the one I'm used to animate with.

114
00:05:33,830 --> 00:05:36,280
It's only to work on cinematic animation,

115
00:05:36,280 --> 00:05:39,070
then you can stick to
24 frame per seconds.

116
00:05:39,070 --> 00:05:41,340
In the end, whatever the frame rate,

117
00:05:41,340 --> 00:05:44,340
the goal is to make your
animation feels good.

118
00:05:44,340 --> 00:05:47,540
It's not that important
during the blocking stage.

119
00:05:47,540 --> 00:05:50,110
So we can now start positioning the feet

120
00:05:50,110 --> 00:05:51,290
from a side view.

121
00:05:51,290 --> 00:05:53,840
When it comes to rotating
the foot backward

122
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:57,970
and forward, I advise you to
use the foot roll controller,

123
00:05:57,970 --> 00:06:01,828
rotating it on its x local axis.

124
00:06:01,828 --> 00:06:03,570
It will make your life way easier

125
00:06:03,570 --> 00:06:06,860
since it's built to create this kind

126
00:06:06,860 --> 00:06:08,980
of rotation and mechanism.

127
00:06:08,980 --> 00:06:11,790
Since we won't be
animating the root bones,

128
00:06:11,790 --> 00:06:14,910
you can hide them through the rig UI.

129
00:06:14,910 --> 00:06:17,390
Now pose the second foot,

130
00:06:17,390 --> 00:06:20,690
again using the foot roll
to rotate the foot forward

131
00:06:20,690 --> 00:06:23,190
and then rotating the toes backward.

132
00:06:23,190 --> 00:06:25,920
As usual, I will probably
go back and forth

133
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:29,430
onto this pose while
building the other poses.

134
00:06:29,430 --> 00:06:32,760
In your case, just use
the reference provided

135
00:06:32,760 --> 00:06:35,009
or build your own poses.

136
00:06:35,009 --> 00:06:38,050
It's very important to pose your character

137
00:06:38,050 --> 00:06:39,700
from different angles.

138
00:06:39,700 --> 00:06:41,570
Don't stay in side view.

139
00:06:41,570 --> 00:06:43,560
That will be a big mistake.

140
00:06:43,560 --> 00:06:45,820
When it comes to twisting the hips

141
00:06:45,820 --> 00:06:49,060
on the global z-axis, it's
pretty straight forward.

142
00:06:49,060 --> 00:06:51,480
Just follow the position of the legs.

143
00:06:51,480 --> 00:06:53,233
Since the right leg is forward,

144
00:06:53,233 --> 00:06:56,610
just twist the right
side of the hips forward.

145
00:06:56,610 --> 00:06:59,060
Then the torso the opposite direction,

146
00:06:59,060 --> 00:07:01,320
the left side forward.

147
00:07:01,320 --> 00:07:03,200
A very important thing here

148
00:07:03,200 --> 00:07:05,604
is that the torso root controller

149
00:07:05,604 --> 00:07:09,480
will be your main controller
to position the torso

150
00:07:09,480 --> 00:07:10,820
of your character.

151
00:07:10,820 --> 00:07:13,900
This is the controller
you have to move the most

152
00:07:13,900 --> 00:07:16,143
to get your character into position.

153
00:07:16,143 --> 00:07:19,060
Then the chest and hips controller

154
00:07:19,060 --> 00:07:22,800
are here to tweak the
pose of your character.

155
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:26,020
And this is why here I prefer
to console the rotation

156
00:07:26,020 --> 00:07:29,590
of hips and chest by pressing Alt + R,

157
00:07:29,590 --> 00:07:33,310
the main shape using the
torso root controller

158
00:07:33,310 --> 00:07:35,830
and then fine tweak the pose

159
00:07:35,830 --> 00:07:37,560
using the chest controller

160
00:07:37,560 --> 00:07:39,230
and the hips controller.

161
00:07:39,230 --> 00:07:42,360
It can be very hard to get a correct pose.

162
00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:46,190
In my case, I won't be able
to reach it right away.

163
00:07:46,190 --> 00:07:49,350
So try your best to match the reference

164
00:07:49,350 --> 00:07:52,130
and then go on the next pose.

165
00:07:52,130 --> 00:07:54,860
You will naturally get back to this pose

166
00:07:54,860 --> 00:07:58,200
to adjust it compared to the other poses.

167
00:07:58,200 --> 00:08:00,560
Posing the arms will definitely help

168
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:02,260
to get a better silhouette.

169
00:08:02,260 --> 00:08:05,340
I will slightly rotate
the front shoulder upward

170
00:08:05,340 --> 00:08:09,540
and forward and then I will
work with the arm controller

171
00:08:09,540 --> 00:08:11,790
that can rotate on all axes

172
00:08:11,790 --> 00:08:13,110
to match the reference.

173
00:08:13,110 --> 00:08:15,120
When rotating the forearm,

174
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:19,380
don't forget to favorize its local z-axis,

175
00:08:19,380 --> 00:08:24,120
since elbows and knees
can normally rotate only

176
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:25,190
on one axis.

177
00:08:25,190 --> 00:08:26,430
To make our life easier,

178
00:08:26,430 --> 00:08:29,620
we will pull the hand with a closed fist.

179
00:08:29,620 --> 00:08:32,260
Watch your own hand as a reference

180
00:08:32,260 --> 00:08:35,801
and make sure that the
fist is slightly curling.

181
00:08:35,801 --> 00:08:38,530
Don't make a box shape with the hand.

182
00:08:38,530 --> 00:08:39,920
Look it from every angle

183
00:08:39,920 --> 00:08:43,680
and you will notice that the
joint always form a curve.

184
00:08:43,680 --> 00:08:45,760
Take the time to properly pose one

185
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:48,210
of the hand and then we will mirror it

186
00:08:48,210 --> 00:08:49,550
on the other side.

187
00:08:49,550 --> 00:08:51,620
My favorite controller for the hands

188
00:08:51,620 --> 00:08:54,210
is the master palm controller.

189
00:08:54,210 --> 00:08:58,700
It allows you to move all
the palm bones at once

190
00:08:58,700 --> 00:09:00,320
with a nice falloff

191
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:03,960
and build nice base and shapes.

192
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:06,350
There I will curve each finger,

193
00:09:06,350 --> 00:09:09,600
rotating them on their local x-axis.

194
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:11,370
The first joint is supposed

195
00:09:11,370 --> 00:09:15,160
to be rotated almost at 90 degrees.

196
00:09:15,160 --> 00:09:17,030
Then I will pose the thumb

197
00:09:17,030 --> 00:09:19,080
and then adjust the finger accordingly.

198
00:09:19,080 --> 00:09:21,940
As I explained in the very
beginning of the video,

199
00:09:21,940 --> 00:09:24,190
it's better to enable cavity

200
00:09:24,190 --> 00:09:26,980
and shadows onto your flat shading

201
00:09:26,980 --> 00:09:30,290
so that you can see the
geometry a little better

202
00:09:30,290 --> 00:09:32,830
and betterly read the pose.

203
00:09:32,830 --> 00:09:36,120
Again, take the time
to create a nice pose,

204
00:09:36,120 --> 00:09:37,960
adjust each joint.

205
00:09:37,960 --> 00:09:42,490
Don't forget to slightly
compress the palms inwards

206
00:09:42,490 --> 00:09:45,490
and then adjust the thumb position.

207
00:09:45,490 --> 00:09:48,300
There are different poses for closed fist,

208
00:09:48,300 --> 00:09:51,970
depending on the people and
the reference you are watching.

209
00:09:51,970 --> 00:09:55,330
The best reference still
being your own fist

210
00:09:55,330 --> 00:09:58,010
because you can see it from every angle

211
00:09:58,010 --> 00:10:02,240
and you can also feel the
pose in your own hand.

212
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:05,000
Once we have reached a satisfying pose,

213
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:08,035
we can select all the
hand bones controller,

214
00:10:08,035 --> 00:10:11,100
press Control + C to copy the pose

215
00:10:11,100 --> 00:10:13,090
and then Control + Shift + V.

216
00:10:13,090 --> 00:10:15,490
This will automatically mirror the pose

217
00:10:15,490 --> 00:10:16,502
on the other side.

218
00:10:16,502 --> 00:10:21,502
With my finger posed, I can
now readjust the position

219
00:10:21,530 --> 00:10:22,910
of the arms.

220
00:10:22,910 --> 00:10:25,070
Don't forget, you can both rotate

221
00:10:25,070 --> 00:10:26,837
and move the shoulder controller

222
00:10:26,837 --> 00:10:29,350
and that the arm controller

223
00:10:29,350 --> 00:10:31,488
can be rotated in all direction

224
00:10:31,488 --> 00:10:34,580
while the forearm controller

225
00:10:34,580 --> 00:10:39,350
should be rotated only
along its z local axis.

226
00:10:39,350 --> 00:10:42,000
You can slightly rotate the hand inward

227
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,640
to break a bit the wrist

228
00:10:43,640 --> 00:10:47,220
and get a more opening shape for the arm.

229
00:10:47,220 --> 00:10:48,810
Don't go too extreme

230
00:10:48,810 --> 00:10:52,147
because your wrist
motion is pretty limited.

231
00:10:52,147 --> 00:10:53,600
Take a few seconds

232
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:56,140
and try rotating your fist forward

233
00:10:56,140 --> 00:10:59,400
and backward and then try to rotate it

234
00:10:59,400 --> 00:11:01,040
from left to right.

235
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:02,880
You will see that its motion

236
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:05,140
is currently very limiting.

237
00:11:05,140 --> 00:11:08,100
Posing the right arm is
pretty straightforward.

238
00:11:08,100 --> 00:11:11,500
Don't forget to check your
pose from the front view

239
00:11:11,500 --> 00:11:15,450
and realign the knees
and the feet if needed.

240
00:11:15,450 --> 00:11:19,216
Don't forget to double check
the reference I have provided

241
00:11:19,216 --> 00:11:22,020
and rewatch the previous video

242
00:11:22,020 --> 00:11:25,780
where we have breaked
down the run cycle poses,

243
00:11:25,780 --> 00:11:28,540
using real-life references.

244
00:11:28,540 --> 00:11:31,100
In the neck, it's important to switch

245
00:11:31,100 --> 00:11:34,330
to NECK-FOLLOW, instead of HEAD-FOLLOW

246
00:11:34,330 --> 00:11:36,600
where the base of the neck gets aligned

247
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:39,175
with the torso, which is more natural

248
00:11:39,175 --> 00:11:42,230
and then we can tweak its position

249
00:11:42,230 --> 00:11:44,330
and tweak the head position.

250
00:11:44,330 --> 00:11:47,770
From there, don't forget to
slightly tweak the position

251
00:11:47,770 --> 00:11:50,980
and orientation of your foot of your knees

252
00:11:50,980 --> 00:11:54,950
and we finally have our first pose done.

253
00:11:54,950 --> 00:11:57,215
As explained in the
beginning of this video,

254
00:11:57,215 --> 00:12:01,430
this might not be the
final straight leg pose

255
00:12:01,430 --> 00:12:05,003
but that's a good start
to work onto the next one.
