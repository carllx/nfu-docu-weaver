1
00:00:01,020 --> 00:00:04,530
- Let's go ahead with the
blocking stage of our run cycle.

2
00:00:04,530 --> 00:00:09,530
We will now work on the down
pose also called passing pose

3
00:00:09,800 --> 00:00:13,310
where the contacting foot
is more or less aligned

4
00:00:13,310 --> 00:00:16,387
with the center of
gravity of our character

5
00:00:16,387 --> 00:00:18,550
and the opposite foot is passing,

6
00:00:18,550 --> 00:00:22,800
almost passing the center of
gravity depending on the kind

7
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:24,080
of run you're doing.

8
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:26,480
Note that the torsal route has a bit

9
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:28,930
of left to right motion,

10
00:00:28,930 --> 00:00:32,730
where the weight is shifting
toward the contacting foot.

11
00:00:32,730 --> 00:00:36,950
But this left to right
motion need to be more subtle

12
00:00:36,950 --> 00:00:39,120
than on the work cycle

13
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:42,160
or your character will feel very heavy.

14
00:00:42,160 --> 00:00:45,060
Next pose, I'm not
thinking about the timing.

15
00:00:45,060 --> 00:00:48,050
We have four poses on 12 frames,

16
00:00:48,050 --> 00:00:50,770
I will key every free frames.

17
00:00:50,770 --> 00:00:53,030
So I will jump on frame free

18
00:00:53,030 --> 00:00:55,074
and key all the controllers.

19
00:00:55,074 --> 00:00:58,836
As in the action editor
and choose all channels.

20
00:00:58,836 --> 00:01:00,510
During the blocking stage,

21
00:01:00,510 --> 00:01:05,110
it's important to key the whole
character on each main poses

22
00:01:05,110 --> 00:01:09,180
to avoid any foot sliding
or weird interpolation

23
00:01:09,180 --> 00:01:11,100
of the different controllers

24
00:01:11,100 --> 00:01:12,939
or the right foot to the ground level,

25
00:01:12,939 --> 00:01:16,780
cancel the rotation on the foot role

26
00:01:16,780 --> 00:01:20,110
and place it under the
root of the character.

27
00:01:20,110 --> 00:01:22,230
You, what I told you
in the previous video,

28
00:01:22,230 --> 00:01:26,040
in this case, I need to
slightly raise my character

29
00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:29,580
on the first poofs
because on the down pose,

30
00:01:29,580 --> 00:01:33,840
I feel like he's too low
compared to the previous one.

31
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:36,340
So I will push the character up,

32
00:01:36,340 --> 00:01:40,700
selecting both the feet and
the torso root controller.

33
00:01:40,700 --> 00:01:43,360
As he is pushing on his right leg,

34
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:46,370
his hips will raise on the right side

35
00:01:46,370 --> 00:01:49,640
and the hips should not
be twisted that much

36
00:01:49,640 --> 00:01:51,570
since we are in the passing pose

37
00:01:51,570 --> 00:01:55,300
and the shoulders and hips
will be kind of aligned

38
00:01:55,300 --> 00:01:56,330
with the feet.

39
00:01:56,330 --> 00:02:00,300
Here is one of the most
important tip of this video,

40
00:02:00,300 --> 00:02:02,230
whenever I'm building a new pose

41
00:02:02,230 --> 00:02:05,610
if I can't get a good result right away,

42
00:02:05,610 --> 00:02:10,610
I will cancel the rotation of
the torso root and repose it.

43
00:02:11,180 --> 00:02:14,670
Press Alt + R to cancel
rotation on the hips

44
00:02:14,670 --> 00:02:16,380
and the torso routes

45
00:02:16,380 --> 00:02:18,650
and then rebuild the pose.

46
00:02:18,650 --> 00:02:22,520
It's better to do so than
trying to match the pose

47
00:02:22,520 --> 00:02:24,340
from the previous one.

48
00:02:24,340 --> 00:02:28,180
If we have made some
transformation that doesn't fit.

49
00:02:28,180 --> 00:02:30,270
You will be fighting with your ring

50
00:02:30,270 --> 00:02:32,100
and at the end of the blocking,

51
00:02:32,100 --> 00:02:35,350
you will have lots of weird pose

52
00:02:35,350 --> 00:02:37,310
in your different controller

53
00:02:37,310 --> 00:02:40,310
while it may look kind of, okay,

54
00:02:40,310 --> 00:02:42,980
your rig will be kind of broken.

55
00:02:42,980 --> 00:02:44,150
So trust me,

56
00:02:44,150 --> 00:02:46,910
you may take a little more time blocking

57
00:02:46,910 --> 00:02:48,730
your poses this way,

58
00:02:48,730 --> 00:02:53,120
but whenever you feel like the
character is not responding,

59
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:56,070
or the rig is not responding properly,

60
00:02:56,070 --> 00:02:58,700
just cancel the rotation
and rebuild the pose

61
00:02:58,700 --> 00:03:00,910
from scratch.

62
00:03:00,910 --> 00:03:04,800
You will save them a lot of
time during the polishing.

63
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:06,250
Back to our pose,

64
00:03:06,250 --> 00:03:09,980
don't forget that the
feet have a slight right

65
00:03:09,980 --> 00:03:12,460
to left movement while in air.

66
00:03:12,460 --> 00:03:15,510
Position of the foot depend on the people

67
00:03:15,510 --> 00:03:18,280
and on the speed at which you are running.

68
00:03:18,280 --> 00:03:22,509
Some people will have their
feet going on the outside during

69
00:03:22,509 --> 00:03:26,060
the passing pose other on the inside.

70
00:03:26,060 --> 00:03:28,560
Since we are blocking
the pose don't forget

71
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:30,480
to select all your keys and set them

72
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:32,636
to constant interpolation.

73
00:03:32,636 --> 00:03:35,690
Regarding the global arm position.

74
00:03:35,690 --> 00:03:38,960
You will generally keep your
arms close to your body,

75
00:03:38,960 --> 00:03:40,490
the faster you run.

76
00:03:40,490 --> 00:03:44,170
So basically what you have
to think about when working

77
00:03:44,170 --> 00:03:47,980
on your poses is the
faster, the straighter.

78
00:03:47,980 --> 00:03:50,360
since you've matched your video reference

79
00:03:50,360 --> 00:03:52,410
or the reference provided,

80
00:03:52,410 --> 00:03:56,259
don't hesitate to fine
tweak the first pose.

81
00:03:56,259 --> 00:03:57,092
Then the second pose,

82
00:03:57,092 --> 00:04:00,400
maybe lean a bit more
forward the character

83
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:03,720
to make him look like
a little more dynamical

84
00:04:03,720 --> 00:04:06,350
that will surely refine those poses

85
00:04:06,350 --> 00:04:09,008
when we will be working on the curves.

86
00:04:09,008 --> 00:04:12,410
Let's now jump on to the push pose.

87
00:04:12,410 --> 00:04:14,670
This is one of the most beautiful

88
00:04:14,670 --> 00:04:18,400
and iconic extreme of
a run cycle it's where

89
00:04:19,368 --> 00:04:21,900
the contacting leg is straight back

90
00:04:21,900 --> 00:04:26,010
and the leading arm is
at its maximum speed.

91
00:04:26,010 --> 00:04:29,350
As the arm and the shoulder up pulling

92
00:04:30,319 --> 00:04:33,110
the body upward in the first video,

93
00:04:33,110 --> 00:04:36,930
the leading arm and shoulder
will hit their extremes

94
00:04:36,930 --> 00:04:38,580
before the feet.

95
00:04:38,580 --> 00:04:43,440
The fist generally don't have
a big side to side motion.

96
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:45,880
It can be tempting to cross

97
00:04:45,880 --> 00:04:49,480
the right hand toward the left shoulder,

98
00:04:49,480 --> 00:04:51,810
but that's kind of a mistake.

99
00:04:51,810 --> 00:04:56,790
You will get a cool pose,
but less realistic run cycle.

100
00:04:56,790 --> 00:04:58,770
In the case of this exercise,

101
00:04:58,770 --> 00:05:02,750
even if we do a slightly
stylized run cycle,

102
00:05:02,750 --> 00:05:05,600
try to match something pretty realistic.

103
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:09,310
You can make then some badass run cycle,

104
00:05:09,310 --> 00:05:13,330
once you master the run cycle principles.

105
00:05:13,330 --> 00:05:15,740
So I will go on frame six.

106
00:05:15,740 --> 00:05:18,930
I will raise the heel
of the contacting leg

107
00:05:18,930 --> 00:05:22,150
and cancel any rotation on the toes.

108
00:05:22,150 --> 00:05:24,480
Then I will move the leg backward

109
00:05:24,480 --> 00:05:27,000
and slightly raise the torso.

110
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:30,760
I gain advise you to use
the foot roll controller,

111
00:05:30,760 --> 00:05:32,490
to orientate the foot

112
00:05:32,490 --> 00:05:36,020
and make the toes slightly
dragging backwards.

113
00:05:36,020 --> 00:05:38,460
As usual for this kind of cycle,

114
00:05:38,460 --> 00:05:43,320
the hips will be twisting
toward the forward leg

115
00:05:43,320 --> 00:05:45,720
and the torso root and chest controller

116
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:48,290
will be twisting the opposite direction.

117
00:05:48,290 --> 00:05:51,570
The left shoulder need to be raised back

118
00:05:51,570 --> 00:05:56,390
and the left elbow is
almost at its highest point.

119
00:05:56,390 --> 00:06:00,368
I've slightly the left
forearm and left hand forward

120
00:06:00,368 --> 00:06:02,770
to make them drag a bit.

121
00:06:02,770 --> 00:06:07,290
I will then raise the right
shoulder and push it forward

122
00:06:07,290 --> 00:06:09,410
and I will raise the right right arm,

123
00:06:09,410 --> 00:06:12,640
twisted it so that I keep the face clear

124
00:06:12,640 --> 00:06:14,750
from the right hand.

125
00:06:14,750 --> 00:06:17,990
The final touch is to make the legs feet

126
00:06:17,990 --> 00:06:20,660
and knees a little straighten,

127
00:06:20,660 --> 00:06:23,260
so that we get a good aerodynamics

128
00:06:23,260 --> 00:06:25,083
and the pose that tells you,

129
00:06:25,083 --> 00:06:27,210
hey, I'm going forward.

130
00:06:27,210 --> 00:06:30,260
This relies a lot on lines of action,

131
00:06:30,260 --> 00:06:33,720
but we will deal with
this animation principle

132
00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:36,430
a little later in this course.

133
00:06:36,430 --> 00:06:40,720
For the time being, just look
at all the silhouette tells us

134
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:44,063
that the character is
pushing up and forward.

135
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:50,038
The last pose we will have
two bird is the up pose.

136
00:06:50,038 --> 00:06:52,700
This is going to be
pretty straight forward

137
00:06:52,700 --> 00:06:57,230
since this is when most
of our controllers hits

138
00:06:57,230 --> 00:06:59,290
their extreme poses.

139
00:06:59,290 --> 00:07:02,500
Make sure you're twisting
the chest and the hips

140
00:07:02,500 --> 00:07:03,880
to the maximum,

141
00:07:03,880 --> 00:07:06,730
the left shoulder and left elbow

142
00:07:06,730 --> 00:07:09,550
are at their highest point.

143
00:07:09,550 --> 00:07:13,460
So does the right shoulder
and the right hand

144
00:07:13,460 --> 00:07:16,700
and then pose the feet
according to the reference,

145
00:07:16,700 --> 00:07:21,070
making sure that the
right leg is dragging back

146
00:07:21,070 --> 00:07:23,350
with the toes also dragging

147
00:07:23,350 --> 00:07:26,690
to get a nice arrow shape of the leg

148
00:07:26,690 --> 00:07:29,910
that points toward the previous position

149
00:07:29,910 --> 00:07:32,190
of the foot in space.

150
00:07:32,190 --> 00:07:34,520
And then as usual don't hesitate

151
00:07:34,520 --> 00:07:36,865
to rework each controller
to get a better pose.

152
00:07:36,865 --> 00:07:41,055
Don't forget to double
check the video reference.

153
00:07:41,055 --> 00:07:46,055
As you may get some more
details like the left elbow.

154
00:07:46,640 --> 00:07:49,740
is getting higher and the left forearm

155
00:07:49,740 --> 00:07:52,030
is slightly bending inward.

156
00:07:52,030 --> 00:07:54,070
Don't target to slightly twist the arm

157
00:07:54,070 --> 00:07:55,880
to keep the head clear

158
00:07:55,880 --> 00:08:00,170
and finally you should
scrub through your animation

159
00:08:00,170 --> 00:08:02,090
as often as possible.

160
00:08:02,090 --> 00:08:05,870
So that you can fine
tweak the previous poses

161
00:08:05,870 --> 00:08:08,320
so that the flow looks great.

162
00:08:08,320 --> 00:08:09,810
Once I'm done with that,

163
00:08:09,810 --> 00:08:13,150
I will make sure I add a
key frame on all the channel

164
00:08:13,150 --> 00:08:14,370
of this key.

165
00:08:14,370 --> 00:08:15,931
And then I will,

166
00:08:15,931 --> 00:08:20,650
then I will go back on frame
zero in the 3d viewport.

167
00:08:20,650 --> 00:08:22,232
Select all the controllers,

168
00:08:22,232 --> 00:08:27,202
press Ctrl + C to copy the
pose and then go to frame 12

169
00:08:27,202 --> 00:08:29,172
and in the 3d viewport
press control Shift + V

170
00:08:29,172 --> 00:08:30,839
to mirror the pause.

171
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,470
Then I just have to repeat the process,

172
00:08:35,470 --> 00:08:37,660
go on frame free copy the pause

173
00:08:37,660 --> 00:08:41,890
then go 12 frames later on frame 15

174
00:08:41,890 --> 00:08:45,670
and paste the mirrored pause
and repeat the process.

175
00:08:45,670 --> 00:08:48,830
Finally, I will just have to duplicate

176
00:08:48,830 --> 00:08:52,924
all the keys from frame
zero onto frame 24.

177
00:08:52,924 --> 00:08:54,450
Once I'm done

178
00:08:54,450 --> 00:08:57,170
and it seems that the cycles work,

179
00:08:57,170 --> 00:09:01,240
I will insert a key frame
on every single keys

180
00:09:01,240 --> 00:09:02,930
I have created

181
00:09:02,930 --> 00:09:05,700
so that all my controllers are keyed

182
00:09:05,700 --> 00:09:08,340
and we have our linear, our cycle.

183
00:09:08,340 --> 00:09:11,540
As we can finally see our whole cycle.

184
00:09:11,540 --> 00:09:15,190
We can finally check what's
working and what's not.

185
00:09:15,190 --> 00:09:16,050
In my case,

186
00:09:16,050 --> 00:09:19,232
I feel like the animation lack of dynamism

187
00:09:19,232 --> 00:09:21,800
to get more dynamic run cycle,

188
00:09:21,800 --> 00:09:24,083
you can push the torso route forward

189
00:09:24,083 --> 00:09:28,320
and lean your character
forward too a little more.

190
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:30,430
When birding a run cycle,

191
00:09:30,430 --> 00:09:34,690
the more horizontal you get the
more dynamism you will have.

192
00:09:34,690 --> 00:09:39,480
If you think about the
stereotypical anime ninja run cycle

193
00:09:39,480 --> 00:09:41,040
like in our route.

194
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:44,370
So legs are generally pushed
to back while the torso

195
00:09:44,370 --> 00:09:48,090
is pushed forward and
is almost horizontal.

196
00:09:48,090 --> 00:09:51,035
Once you've tweaked all your pose.

197
00:09:51,035 --> 00:09:55,040
Don't forget to again to again
mirror them on each keys.

198
00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:59,420
Here is the result I got
from our blocking stitch.

199
00:09:59,420 --> 00:10:02,950
The run cycle looks pretty
cool, pretty natural

200
00:10:02,950 --> 00:10:05,891
not too dynamic, not too stylized

201
00:10:05,891 --> 00:10:09,200
which is perfect to learn our fundamental.

202
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:12,250
Since we've been keying every free frame

203
00:10:12,250 --> 00:10:14,970
in some kind of thinning our fashion,

204
00:10:14,970 --> 00:10:17,290
the run cycle works.

205
00:10:17,290 --> 00:10:18,480
What we can do now,

206
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:21,270
is offset some of the key poses

207
00:10:21,270 --> 00:10:24,050
to slightly stylized our run cycle.

208
00:10:24,050 --> 00:10:27,740
For a light skilled and agile character.

209
00:10:27,740 --> 00:10:30,730
We want to favorize the airborne pause.

210
00:10:30,730 --> 00:10:35,200
The idea is to hold the
up pose a little longer

211
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:39,860
and switch from the
straight pose down pose

212
00:10:39,860 --> 00:10:42,310
and pushing pose a little faster,

213
00:10:42,310 --> 00:10:45,580
the process in itself
is not super complicated

214
00:10:45,580 --> 00:10:47,030
and not super interesting.

215
00:10:47,030 --> 00:10:51,700
I'm just moving some keys until
I get to the right timing.

216
00:10:51,700 --> 00:10:54,130
So in the end I've set the down

217
00:10:54,130 --> 00:10:58,130
or passing pose on frame free and 15.

218
00:10:58,130 --> 00:11:02,220
The pushing pose on frame five and 17,

219
00:11:02,220 --> 00:11:04,460
so that we have only two frame between

220
00:11:04,460 --> 00:11:06,482
the down and pushing pose.

221
00:11:06,482 --> 00:11:09,690
So that the foot is rapidly
sliding on the ground

222
00:11:09,690 --> 00:11:11,676
before we get back into the air

223
00:11:11,676 --> 00:11:15,583
with the up pose on frame eight and 20.
