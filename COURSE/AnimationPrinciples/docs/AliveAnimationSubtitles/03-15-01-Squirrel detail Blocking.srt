1
00:00:00,770 --> 00:00:03,130
- It's time to detail our idol blocking

2
00:00:03,130 --> 00:00:05,990
and also give it a timing path.

3
00:00:05,990 --> 00:00:09,870
Character is entering the
shot after a run cycle.

4
00:00:09,870 --> 00:00:12,540
Have a look around smell the air,

5
00:00:12,540 --> 00:00:16,500
held something and flee
into a neuron cycle.

6
00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:20,920
The first thing I will do is
to offset the second jump.

7
00:00:20,920 --> 00:00:23,310
So I will select the root bone

8
00:00:23,310 --> 00:00:25,630
and I will change the last key

9
00:00:25,630 --> 00:00:30,140
by increasing its value
by minus 0.7 meter.

10
00:00:30,140 --> 00:00:34,760
This is the distance our
character is traveling per bounce.

11
00:00:34,760 --> 00:00:37,140
Enter the stage the route is at zero,

12
00:00:37,140 --> 00:00:40,540
travel by minus 0.7 during the first jump

13
00:00:40,540 --> 00:00:45,540
then stop and stays at minus
0.7 during the second jump,

14
00:00:46,010 --> 00:00:49,870
it will travel to minus 1.4 meters.

15
00:00:49,870 --> 00:00:52,490
From there I will be
working on the first pose.

16
00:00:52,490 --> 00:00:55,000
So I will just give me some space,

17
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:58,070
moving the key frame
a bit forward in time.

18
00:00:58,070 --> 00:01:02,300
Whenever we build the breakdowns
as we did during the cycle,

19
00:01:02,300 --> 00:01:06,950
we mean to address any
specific changes or big changes

20
00:01:06,950 --> 00:01:11,790
between each key poses
also called golden poses.

21
00:01:11,790 --> 00:01:16,080
So the run cycle our
characters stops on three legs

22
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:18,170
and is having a look around.

23
00:01:18,170 --> 00:01:21,420
I will create two breakdowns to absorb

24
00:01:21,420 --> 00:01:23,530
the impact of the landing

25
00:01:23,530 --> 00:01:27,404
and define the steps
made by the front legs.

26
00:01:27,404 --> 00:01:30,240
It lands on both front leg

27
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:31,940
and then I will make him switch

28
00:01:31,940 --> 00:01:34,280
from left leg to right leg.

29
00:01:34,280 --> 00:01:36,350
So there is a little shuffle.

30
00:01:36,350 --> 00:01:39,330
The most of use was to flatten the feet

31
00:01:39,330 --> 00:01:43,520
as our character is stopping
the feet are well-grounded.

32
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:46,070
As I want my character to raise one

33
00:01:46,070 --> 00:01:49,220
of the front leg to make a step leaning

34
00:01:49,220 --> 00:01:53,400
the character toward the foot
in contact with the ground.

35
00:01:53,400 --> 00:01:55,510
If you remember in the previous video

36
00:01:55,510 --> 00:01:58,170
we were talking about balance.

37
00:01:58,170 --> 00:02:01,240
So whenever my character
is raising one leg

38
00:02:01,240 --> 00:02:04,400
is shifting his weight toward the one

39
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:06,000
in contact with the ground.

40
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:10,090
So you need to input a
bit of location offset

41
00:02:10,090 --> 00:02:14,730
in each controller and a bit
of rotation in each controller.

42
00:02:14,730 --> 00:02:18,440
A bit of twisting too remember
to use the body controller

43
00:02:18,440 --> 00:02:21,130
as the main controller while the hips

44
00:02:21,130 --> 00:02:24,791
and chest controller are
here to shape our character.

45
00:02:24,791 --> 00:02:29,000
I oftenly reset the rotation
and location of the chest

46
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:32,950
and hips controller by
pressing Alt+R and Alt+G.

47
00:02:32,950 --> 00:02:37,260
And then re-transform them
when I'm creating a breakdown.

48
00:02:37,260 --> 00:02:39,870
When I'm happy with the pose
I will slightly offset it

49
00:02:39,870 --> 00:02:43,970
on frame 15 and insert a key
frame on every controller.

50
00:02:43,970 --> 00:02:47,770
Now I will refine a bit
the pose by scrubbing back

51
00:02:47,770 --> 00:02:51,480
and forth onto the current
pose and the previous one.

52
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:54,570
I'm trying to figure
this transition motion

53
00:02:54,570 --> 00:02:57,220
between the new pose and the landing pose.

54
00:02:57,220 --> 00:02:59,500
But I will make the tail drag a bit

55
00:02:59,500 --> 00:03:02,060
by rotating it a little down.

56
00:03:02,060 --> 00:03:04,611
And since the chest and
head of our character

57
00:03:04,611 --> 00:03:09,611
are also weighted or heavy I
will make them drag a bit too.

58
00:03:10,090 --> 00:03:13,830
So I will slightly push
the head inward the bodys

59
00:03:13,830 --> 00:03:16,840
quash a bit and rotate it a bit downward.

60
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:21,440
As the tip of the nose is
dragging into the next pose.

61
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:24,030
Don't hesitate to check
out the provided file

62
00:03:24,030 --> 00:03:26,800
to have a better reference
of the current pose.

63
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:30,230
For the next breakdown I
will select my key pose

64
00:03:30,230 --> 00:03:33,040
on frame 20 and duplicate it.

65
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:37,623
To build a nice transition
between frame 15 and 17.

66
00:03:37,623 --> 00:03:42,610
I will calculate the motion
path of the body controller.

67
00:03:42,610 --> 00:03:44,830
I've already explained you before

68
00:03:44,830 --> 00:03:48,780
that arcs in animation are very important.

69
00:03:48,780 --> 00:03:53,500
This is why I'm using motion
path is to see those arcs.

70
00:03:53,500 --> 00:03:58,400
Here we can see that the frame
15 is higher than frame 17.

71
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:02,840
So I will push frame 17
up and frame 15 down.

72
00:04:02,840 --> 00:04:07,060
Make sure that you check your
arcs as soon as possible.

73
00:04:07,060 --> 00:04:10,620
This is really something
I wish I knew before.

74
00:04:10,620 --> 00:04:13,560
Because as soon as I've
learned this technique

75
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:17,420
and I've embraced it my animation quality

76
00:04:17,420 --> 00:04:22,060
and speed to produce it
have leveled up very fast.

77
00:04:22,060 --> 00:04:25,670
So even if you're blocking
will take a little more time

78
00:04:25,670 --> 00:04:30,010
it will be way more accurate
and way more appealing.

79
00:04:30,010 --> 00:04:34,820
Hence the polishing stage will
be way easier and way faster.

80
00:04:34,820 --> 00:04:38,000
Don't forget to check your
arcs from every position,

81
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,240
the top the side et cetera.

82
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:44,250
As the body controller
arcs looks quite right,

83
00:04:44,250 --> 00:04:48,500
just drag a bit the chest
the head and the front leg

84
00:04:48,500 --> 00:04:51,470
between frame 15 and frame 20.

85
00:04:51,470 --> 00:04:55,030
On this frame 17 I'm creating and easing

86
00:04:55,030 --> 00:04:57,470
toward the frame 20.

87
00:04:57,470 --> 00:04:59,910
From there I will mainly be tweaking

88
00:04:59,910 --> 00:05:03,610
the poses on frame 15, 17 and 20,

89
00:05:03,610 --> 00:05:08,610
20 being our key pose 15
and 17 our breakdowns.

90
00:05:08,620 --> 00:05:10,740
So I'm double checking the arcs

91
00:05:10,740 --> 00:05:13,603
of the body controller from the top view,

92
00:05:13,603 --> 00:05:16,600
And then I will mostly be refining

93
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:18,480
the tail of the character.

94
00:05:18,480 --> 00:05:20,570
I want to have quite of a contrast

95
00:05:20,570 --> 00:05:22,420
between the different poses.

96
00:05:22,420 --> 00:05:24,562
We watch the reference the squirrel

97
00:05:24,562 --> 00:05:27,900
has very snappy motion of the tail.

98
00:05:27,900 --> 00:05:32,090
And it wipes it quite a lot
even if it's a subtle motion,

99
00:05:32,090 --> 00:05:37,090
each time it changes pose the
tail has rapid wipe motion.

100
00:05:37,810 --> 00:05:40,400
That's why I'm trying
to bring some contrast

101
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:42,660
in the tail pose during the blocking.

102
00:05:42,660 --> 00:05:45,870
Those poses will give
the rhythm to the idol.

103
00:05:45,870 --> 00:05:49,517
I will offset a big
chunk of the animation.

104
00:05:49,517 --> 00:05:52,480
The next step I want the character

105
00:05:52,480 --> 00:05:55,520
to hold the pose for a second or so

106
00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:57,690
and then jump into the one.

107
00:05:57,690 --> 00:06:01,950
So here it's out to give you
a tip of whatever to say,

108
00:06:01,950 --> 00:06:05,695
hey you have to input maybe 10, 15,

109
00:06:05,695 --> 00:06:08,270
20 frame between the two poses.

110
00:06:08,270 --> 00:06:10,650
I'm just playing the
animation and thinking,

111
00:06:10,650 --> 00:06:13,510
okay will jump he will
stop have a look around

112
00:06:13,510 --> 00:06:16,440
and then switch to a more relaxed pose.

113
00:06:16,440 --> 00:06:18,560
And you won't find any footage of this

114
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:20,730
but I'm almost acting the scene

115
00:06:20,730 --> 00:06:23,970
I am figuring out that I
am the squirrel I stopped,

116
00:06:23,970 --> 00:06:26,230
I'm curious about what's around me

117
00:06:26,230 --> 00:06:28,510
and then I relax and sit.

118
00:06:28,510 --> 00:06:32,950
So I figured that 10 frames
was okay for the time being

119
00:06:32,950 --> 00:06:36,810
but holding the pose for
10 frame is a bit too much.

120
00:06:36,810 --> 00:06:39,490
So I will just build a new pose

121
00:06:39,490 --> 00:06:42,840
upon the frame 20 and frame 23

122
00:06:42,840 --> 00:06:46,320
and bring some sort of
variation especially in the tail

123
00:06:46,320 --> 00:06:48,750
I want to change the shape of the tail.

124
00:06:48,750 --> 00:06:52,510
Change a bit the orientation
of the head stuff like that.

125
00:06:52,510 --> 00:06:56,920
I can imagine the character
smelling the air for example.

126
00:06:56,920 --> 00:06:59,950
As usual when I feel like the pose is okay

127
00:06:59,950 --> 00:07:02,550
I will keep frame all the controllers

128
00:07:02,550 --> 00:07:05,383
to avoid foot sliding and stuff like that.

129
00:07:07,960 --> 00:07:11,460
From there we can transition
into the next pose.

130
00:07:11,460 --> 00:07:15,720
The pose where our character
is sitting on his back legs.

131
00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:18,180
We will first create an anticipation

132
00:07:18,180 --> 00:07:20,840
where our character is crouching,

133
00:07:20,840 --> 00:07:22,630
then we will have a transition pose

134
00:07:22,630 --> 00:07:25,070
where the head and the
chest will be dragging

135
00:07:25,070 --> 00:07:29,240
while our character is
moving backward to sit.

136
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:32,720
So I've started by creating
the crouching pose,

137
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:34,880
the anticipation if you prefer,

138
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:38,270
and I'm building it from the current pose.

139
00:07:38,270 --> 00:07:41,090
But since I'm still using the motion path

140
00:07:41,090 --> 00:07:42,870
for the body controller

141
00:07:42,870 --> 00:07:46,670
I know where the character
body is going to be.

142
00:07:46,670 --> 00:07:51,220
So I'm just pushing him
down to create a new arc.

143
00:07:51,220 --> 00:07:55,520
And as I build or pre-build this new pose,

144
00:07:55,520 --> 00:07:59,590
I can create the
intermediate pose with ease.

145
00:07:59,590 --> 00:08:01,930
So this will be really a transition pose

146
00:08:01,930 --> 00:08:04,493
where I start to rotate the body

147
00:08:04,493 --> 00:08:08,690
and the chest, neck and
head will drag behind.

148
00:08:08,690 --> 00:08:10,790
Just imagine that your character

149
00:08:10,790 --> 00:08:13,010
is being pulled by the hips.

150
00:08:13,010 --> 00:08:18,010
The danger here is to overdo
the anticipation in a way.

151
00:08:18,020 --> 00:08:21,000
This is a pretty lightweight character.

152
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:24,980
So the anticipation
should be very settled.

153
00:08:24,980 --> 00:08:26,690
The heavier a character

154
00:08:26,690 --> 00:08:29,320
the more energy he will have to gather

155
00:08:29,320 --> 00:08:31,900
before moving into the next pose

156
00:08:31,900 --> 00:08:34,960
so the bigger will be the anticipation.

157
00:08:34,960 --> 00:08:39,220
So honestly while I'm
recording this specific video

158
00:08:39,220 --> 00:08:43,590
I haven't started the
polishing of this animation.

159
00:08:43,590 --> 00:08:46,410
It made this anticipation
more subtle when I will switch

160
00:08:46,410 --> 00:08:49,880
to spline and start
polishing this animation.

161
00:08:49,880 --> 00:08:52,900
Getting the right sense
of weight is I believe

162
00:08:52,900 --> 00:08:56,040
the most complicated thing in animation.

163
00:08:56,040 --> 00:08:58,970
And also one of the most important thing

164
00:08:58,970 --> 00:09:01,980
if you want your animation
to be believable.

165
00:09:01,980 --> 00:09:03,640
Even if it's stylized.

166
00:09:03,640 --> 00:09:07,553
So I'm pretty confident I
will get a nice animation

167
00:09:07,553 --> 00:09:09,976
at least something appealing

168
00:09:09,976 --> 00:09:13,010
but nailing the motion of the squirrel

169
00:09:13,010 --> 00:09:16,200
even in a stylized animation

170
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:18,280
this is not something I will promise

171
00:09:18,280 --> 00:09:20,683
but we will try our best for sure.

172
00:09:21,520 --> 00:09:24,890
We will now detail the turn animation.

173
00:09:24,890 --> 00:09:27,890
There are two very important
things to look after,

174
00:09:27,890 --> 00:09:32,030
as usual the motion arcs
and then the body transfer.

175
00:09:32,030 --> 00:09:35,590
The sitting pose our
character will transition

176
00:09:35,590 --> 00:09:38,150
into the standing up pose.

177
00:09:38,150 --> 00:09:40,370
I will then add a couple of details

178
00:09:40,370 --> 00:09:43,630
by making the character
raising even a bit more

179
00:09:43,630 --> 00:09:45,880
and smelling the air.

180
00:09:45,880 --> 00:09:49,120
As I'm transitioning
between those two key poses,

181
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:52,260
Look at the arcs drawn by the body

182
00:09:52,260 --> 00:09:54,460
and the nose of the character.

183
00:09:54,460 --> 00:09:58,350
I've exaggerated them a bit
for the sake of this tutorial

184
00:09:58,350 --> 00:10:02,370
but I'm sure it will look pretty
decent and way better than

185
00:10:02,370 --> 00:10:06,600
if I was doing a straight
rotation between those two poses.

186
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:10,520
The second very important thing
here is the weight shifting.

187
00:10:10,520 --> 00:10:13,070
As the character is turning to his left,

188
00:10:13,070 --> 00:10:16,210
I'm also translating his body controller

189
00:10:16,210 --> 00:10:21,020
and I'm opening the left leg
toward this new position.

190
00:10:21,020 --> 00:10:23,310
The wider the legs are opened,

191
00:10:23,310 --> 00:10:26,000
the more balanced will be our character.

192
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:30,920
Last detail on this pose is
the right end dropping down.

193
00:10:30,920 --> 00:10:35,050
When the character is raising
into the left turn position

194
00:10:35,050 --> 00:10:38,008
he drops his right hand to counter balance

195
00:10:38,008 --> 00:10:41,710
the weight that has been
shifting on the left side.

196
00:10:41,710 --> 00:10:45,860
And as he's rising he
straighten his tail horizontally

197
00:10:45,860 --> 00:10:47,550
to get some better balance.

198
00:10:47,550 --> 00:10:50,430
To better understand what
I'm showing you here,

199
00:10:50,430 --> 00:10:54,430
stand up and try to raise
your nose as high as possible.

200
00:10:54,430 --> 00:10:58,240
You will intuitively and
naturally push your hands

201
00:10:58,240 --> 00:10:59,630
towards the ground.

202
00:10:59,630 --> 00:11:02,990
You will pull every part of your body down

203
00:11:02,990 --> 00:11:06,350
to be able to raise as much as possible

204
00:11:06,350 --> 00:11:07,870
the tip of your nose.

205
00:11:07,870 --> 00:11:11,150
Your arm will be spreading
and pointing downward

206
00:11:11,150 --> 00:11:16,150
in order to lower your center
of gravity and be balanced.

207
00:11:16,190 --> 00:11:21,100
So the more you spread any
body part closer to the ground,

208
00:11:21,100 --> 00:11:23,640
the lower is your center of gravity,

209
00:11:23,640 --> 00:11:25,693
the more balanced you are.

210
00:11:26,642 --> 00:11:29,290
For the transition into the last pose

211
00:11:29,290 --> 00:11:33,080
our character is hearing
a node in his back.

212
00:11:33,080 --> 00:11:37,500
So his attention is dragged behind him.

213
00:11:37,500 --> 00:11:40,260
So beyond curiosity our character

214
00:11:40,260 --> 00:11:43,390
might be scared or feel in danger.

215
00:11:43,390 --> 00:11:45,100
So what I want to show you here

216
00:11:45,100 --> 00:11:48,570
is that the head is leading the animation.

217
00:11:48,570 --> 00:11:50,470
Parting from the previous pose,

218
00:11:50,470 --> 00:11:53,020
we can see that on the next pose,

219
00:11:53,020 --> 00:11:56,200
It's the head that has the broader motion.

220
00:11:56,200 --> 00:11:59,040
And beyond this head rotation the heels

221
00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:03,330
are also already pointing
at the final destination.

222
00:12:03,330 --> 00:12:07,160
When doing a head turn
you generally first rotate

223
00:12:07,160 --> 00:12:10,150
the eyes towards the target
and then the head follow.

224
00:12:10,150 --> 00:12:12,740
If you have watched cats or dogs

225
00:12:12,740 --> 00:12:17,350
I'm sure you have already spotted
how mobile their ears are.

226
00:12:17,350 --> 00:12:20,040
So in those breakdowns I want to show

227
00:12:20,040 --> 00:12:24,010
that the ears are currently
leading the animation.

228
00:12:24,010 --> 00:12:27,260
I've created a second
step where the character

229
00:12:27,260 --> 00:12:30,370
hear the noise again and
the ears are pointing

230
00:12:30,370 --> 00:12:34,370
toward the noise and he rotates
his head more precisely.

231
00:12:34,370 --> 00:12:37,790
And as he's getting scared
I straighten the tail.

232
00:12:37,790 --> 00:12:40,570
Again think of it and act it

233
00:12:40,570 --> 00:12:42,110
when you are getting scared

234
00:12:42,110 --> 00:12:45,460
you instantly get straight as a stick.

235
00:12:45,460 --> 00:12:47,740
So from there there is no more doubt.

236
00:12:47,740 --> 00:12:50,970
Our character is scared
so I will transition

237
00:12:50,970 --> 00:12:53,860
into the anticipation before the jump.

238
00:12:53,860 --> 00:12:57,120
Here the hips are pulling
the characters back

239
00:12:57,120 --> 00:13:00,980
into the most squashed
position as possible.

240
00:13:00,980 --> 00:13:03,830
The ears are still pointing back towards

241
00:13:03,830 --> 00:13:05,600
the source of the noise.

242
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:08,860
To want to put in short
pre-data on whatever,

243
00:13:08,860 --> 00:13:11,720
lets build last pose
that is almost the same

244
00:13:11,720 --> 00:13:15,240
where the character is
squashed a little more.

245
00:13:15,240 --> 00:13:18,580
Animation wise this pose
will last maybe for one

246
00:13:18,580 --> 00:13:22,340
or two frame maximum before
the character jumps forward.

247
00:13:22,340 --> 00:13:25,780
The last thing I've done
to finish this blocking

248
00:13:25,780 --> 00:13:29,800
is to duplicate the keys
where I want my character

249
00:13:29,800 --> 00:13:31,330
to hold the pose.

250
00:13:31,330 --> 00:13:34,100
So that when I will switch to spline,

251
00:13:34,100 --> 00:13:36,490
my character won't be moving

252
00:13:36,490 --> 00:13:39,710
because I will have two identical pose.

253
00:13:39,710 --> 00:13:43,110
So I wont have any
interpolation between them.

254
00:13:43,110 --> 00:13:45,040
And he will hold the pose.

255
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:46,890
Next video will be a time lapse

256
00:13:46,890 --> 00:13:50,083
where I build all the
breakdowns we have been talking.
