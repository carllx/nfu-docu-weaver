00:00:01,420 --> 00:00:04,560
- [Instructor] Regarding the
bag, more than polishing stage,

2
00:00:04,560 --> 00:00:07,240
it's going to be an animation stage.

3
00:00:07,240 --> 00:00:10,130
While the blocking did help to get an idea

4
00:00:10,130 --> 00:00:12,090
of what we were going to do

5
00:00:12,090 --> 00:00:14,070
and what would be the behavior

6
00:00:14,070 --> 00:00:16,140
of the bag during the animation,

7
00:00:16,140 --> 00:00:18,570
since the main controller animation

8
00:00:18,570 --> 00:00:20,900
or motion is pretty simple,

9
00:00:20,900 --> 00:00:23,990
it's almost easier to work
directly in the graph editor

10
00:00:23,990 --> 00:00:26,550
for this kind of motion.

11
00:00:26,550 --> 00:00:30,180
And then we will rework
the different tweaker bones

12
00:00:30,180 --> 00:00:34,670
or even erase all the key
frames and rebuild their motion.

13
00:00:34,670 --> 00:00:37,090
Since the bag has a pendulum motion

14
00:00:37,090 --> 00:00:39,970
with an extreme low and an extreme high,

15
00:00:39,970 --> 00:00:43,640
it's useless to have more
than three key frames.

16
00:00:43,640 --> 00:00:46,610
One for the beginning,
one for the extreme,

17
00:00:46,610 --> 00:00:48,750
and one for the return.

18
00:00:48,750 --> 00:00:50,950
So at this stage, I'm getting rid

19
00:00:50,950 --> 00:00:55,630
of any useless key frames I
did during the blocking stage.

20
00:00:55,630 --> 00:00:58,910
From there, I can start
working on the X rotation axis,

21
00:00:58,910 --> 00:01:02,290
which is the main rotation axis
of our bag in the beginning.

22
00:01:02,290 --> 00:01:04,010
In the beginning, it's pretty close

23
00:01:04,010 --> 00:01:06,410
to what we were doing with the character.

24
00:01:06,410 --> 00:01:09,150
I have two contact frames with the fist.

25
00:01:09,150 --> 00:01:12,270
After the first punch, the
bag starts to move a bit.

26
00:01:12,270 --> 00:01:14,210
Then, during the second punch,

27
00:01:14,210 --> 00:01:17,240
I'm keeping the bag a
bit backward to make sure

28
00:01:17,240 --> 00:01:19,810
that the fist penetrates the bag.

29
00:01:19,810 --> 00:01:21,960
Don't over-focus on this part though

30
00:01:21,960 --> 00:01:25,290
because this is something
I'm going to change later on.

31
00:01:25,290 --> 00:01:28,150
But this gives me the starting point

32
00:01:28,150 --> 00:01:31,590
for the first pendulum motion of the bag.

33
00:01:31,590 --> 00:01:34,660
And once you have that, you
just need your starting point

34
00:01:34,660 --> 00:01:38,070
and where the bag will
end before the next punch.

35
00:01:38,070 --> 00:01:40,580
And we just need one key in between,

36
00:01:40,580 --> 00:01:44,840
so I will get rid of
everything but those two keys.

37
00:01:44,840 --> 00:01:48,520
Then, we just need to
convert the start and end key

38
00:01:48,520 --> 00:01:51,300
to vector, and then work on the scaling

39
00:01:51,300 --> 00:01:53,650
of the handles of the extreme key

40
00:01:53,650 --> 00:01:57,760
exactly as we will do with
the up and down motion

41
00:01:57,760 --> 00:01:58,940
of a bouncing ball.

42
00:01:58,940 --> 00:02:02,350
From there, you need to watch
several times your motion.

43
00:02:02,350 --> 00:02:05,920
See if it feels right, and
then edit any of your keys.

44
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:09,620
Maybe scale a bit up or
down some of the handles

45
00:02:09,620 --> 00:02:11,900
to accelerate or decelerate the bag

46
00:02:11,900 --> 00:02:13,980
whenever it's going down or up.

47
00:02:13,980 --> 00:02:17,800
Here, you can see the final
shape of my X rotation curve

48
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:19,600
on the first bounce.

49
00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:22,620
Regarding the X and Y rotation curve,

50
00:02:22,620 --> 00:02:26,300
during the first swing, there
is not that too much to do

51
00:02:26,300 --> 00:02:30,590
than getting rid of any keys
that could be in between.

52
00:02:30,590 --> 00:02:34,210
And set the handles of the
starting and ending keys

53
00:02:34,210 --> 00:02:37,130
to vector so that we
have no interpolation.

54
00:02:37,130 --> 00:02:39,810
I haven't done it on the Y rotation.

55
00:02:39,810 --> 00:02:42,730
That's a mistake, but
it's not even noticeable

56
00:02:42,730 --> 00:02:44,040
in the animation.

57
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:45,870
On there, I need to redefine the moment

58
00:02:45,870 --> 00:02:47,720
where the bag will start to move.

59
00:02:47,720 --> 00:02:52,060
It's currently one frame earlier
that what I have right now,

60
00:02:52,060 --> 00:02:54,330
and since I want to hold the pose

61
00:02:54,330 --> 00:02:56,740
for the first impact of the hook,

62
00:02:56,740 --> 00:03:01,470
I will simply duplicate the
keys from 45 onto frame 47.

63
00:03:01,470 --> 00:03:02,900
This will create a plateau

64
00:03:02,900 --> 00:03:04,690
where the bag is no longer moving,

65
00:03:04,690 --> 00:03:08,000
and I can get rid of
the keys after this one.

66
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:11,060
Here, we've just defined
the starting point

67
00:03:11,060 --> 00:03:14,470
of the pendulum motion of
the bag after the hook.

68
00:03:14,470 --> 00:03:19,097
Now, I will go on the next
contact frame on frame 78,

69
00:03:19,097 --> 00:03:22,290
and I will refine the position of the bag

70
00:03:22,290 --> 00:03:25,910
so that it perfectly matches
the shin of the character.

71
00:03:25,910 --> 00:03:28,440
I've now defined the starting point

72
00:03:28,440 --> 00:03:32,750
and the end point of this
next pendulum motion.

73
00:03:32,750 --> 00:03:36,300
So, I can get rid of all
the key frames in between

74
00:03:36,300 --> 00:03:38,300
and rework its motion.

75
00:03:38,300 --> 00:03:40,740
From there, I will rebuild some kind

76
00:03:40,740 --> 00:03:43,730
of the same curve we had
with the bouncing ball

77
00:03:43,730 --> 00:03:46,070
or the previous pendulum motion.

78
00:03:46,070 --> 00:03:47,990
I will select the Z
rotation rotation curve

79
00:03:47,990 --> 00:03:50,770
that is going to be the
main rotation channel

80
00:03:50,770 --> 00:03:52,840
for this specific bounce.

81
00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:54,240
I will duplicate the key.

82
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:58,630
I put it right in the middle
and switch it to auto clamp.

83
00:03:58,630 --> 00:04:00,570
Then, I will make sure that the starting

84
00:04:00,570 --> 00:04:03,750
and ending keys are set to vector.

85
00:04:03,750 --> 00:04:07,080
From there, I have my base
motion for the second bounce.

86
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:10,170
From there, I definitely
need some more love.

87
00:04:10,170 --> 00:04:13,790
I will refine the position
of the hitting frame.

88
00:04:13,790 --> 00:04:16,500
From there, I will bring
a little more contrast

89
00:04:16,500 --> 00:04:18,690
into the shape of the Z curve

90
00:04:18,690 --> 00:04:21,210
as you can see on the reference.

91
00:04:21,210 --> 00:04:23,560
This way, the bag will be pushed faster

92
00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:27,240
and will come back faster,
which will look more impactful.

93
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:31,370
And from there, I've worked
a bit on the X rotation curve

94
00:04:31,370 --> 00:04:34,560
so that the motion of
the bag was currently

95
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:38,080
physically correct because
in its current state,

96
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:41,340
the bag has a weird motion from frame 60,

97
00:04:41,340 --> 00:04:44,130
where it starts to rotate to the left

98
00:04:44,130 --> 00:04:46,430
while there is absolutely no force

99
00:04:46,430 --> 00:04:48,950
that would generate this rotation.

100
00:04:48,950 --> 00:04:50,470
So just after the punch,

101
00:04:50,470 --> 00:04:53,770
I will put a bit of a right rotation,

102
00:04:53,770 --> 00:04:56,870
and then the bag will
swing back to the left.

103
00:04:56,870 --> 00:04:58,620
Polishing the motion of the bag

104
00:04:58,620 --> 00:05:01,080
just after the kick was a bit closer

105
00:05:01,080 --> 00:05:04,790
to what we did during the
polishing of the character.

106
00:05:04,790 --> 00:05:07,390
As I'm making the bag holding a bit

107
00:05:07,390 --> 00:05:09,400
onto the character's shin,

108
00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:12,130
and then it starts to swing very fast.

109
00:05:12,130 --> 00:05:16,710
Once the bag is projected
after frame 80 'til frame 85

110
00:05:16,710 --> 00:05:19,610
where it gets out of the camera range,

111
00:05:19,610 --> 00:05:22,620
its motion is pretty close
to what we already had

112
00:05:22,620 --> 00:05:25,090
with initial keys set to vector

113
00:05:25,090 --> 00:05:27,430
and then a big acceleration.

114
00:05:27,430 --> 00:05:31,420
From there, since I want the
bag to land flat on the ground,

115
00:05:31,420 --> 00:05:36,290
I just got rid of all the keys
on the X and Y rotation axis.

116
00:05:36,290 --> 00:05:38,550
Then, start working on the root controller

117
00:05:38,550 --> 00:05:39,780
of the punching bag.

118
00:05:39,780 --> 00:05:43,070
And again, here it is gonna
be super simple compared

119
00:05:43,070 --> 00:05:45,200
to what we have done before.

120
00:05:45,200 --> 00:05:47,260
So, the first thing is that I can get rid

121
00:05:47,260 --> 00:05:51,050
of all the key frames before
the root starts to move.

122
00:05:51,050 --> 00:05:53,440
Then, I will get rid of any key frames

123
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:56,670
between the starting and landing pose.

124
00:05:56,670 --> 00:05:59,030
Then, I will have refine
the location of the bag

125
00:05:59,030 --> 00:06:02,950
once it hits the ground
based on the camera frame.

126
00:06:02,950 --> 00:06:05,340
And from there, I will
convert all the keys

127
00:06:05,340 --> 00:06:07,120
to vector because why?

128
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:10,810
Well, one, there won't be
any change in the speed

129
00:06:10,810 --> 00:06:13,440
of the bag on your recent channel.

130
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:16,880
So on the X and Y location channels

131
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:19,700
exactly as for the bouncing ball.

132
00:06:19,700 --> 00:06:21,510
A few frames after the hit,

133
00:06:21,510 --> 00:06:26,510
I will slightly offset the
value of the Y location curve

134
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:30,170
so that it feels like
the bag is sliding a bit

135
00:06:30,170 --> 00:06:31,060
on the ground.

136
00:06:31,060 --> 00:06:33,690
I've done the same with
the X location curve,

137
00:06:33,690 --> 00:06:37,300
and I will convert both
keys to auto clamped.

138
00:06:37,300 --> 00:06:39,870
Then, I just need to scale those two keys

139
00:06:39,870 --> 00:06:43,590
to create a heavy feeling
as the friction of the bag

140
00:06:43,590 --> 00:06:45,740
on the ground slowing down.

141
00:06:45,740 --> 00:06:47,640
Now, the only curve that needs

142
00:06:47,640 --> 00:06:50,910
to be worked on is the Z location curve,

143
00:06:50,910 --> 00:06:54,440
and as you can see, it's
going to be super simple.

144
00:06:54,440 --> 00:06:57,680
Now, the only thing I'd like to improve is

145
00:06:57,680 --> 00:07:00,800
as for the character, the
silhouette of the bag.

146
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:02,770
As it currently lands on the ground,

147
00:07:02,770 --> 00:07:06,060
we just see the top part of the bag.

148
00:07:06,060 --> 00:07:09,260
And if we were only
keeping this still frame,

149
00:07:09,260 --> 00:07:12,830
we wouldn't be able to
identify a punching bag.

150
00:07:12,830 --> 00:07:15,680
So, basically this is a bad pose.

151
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:18,680
First thing I will do is use
the master rotation controller

152
00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:21,770
to make sure that the bag
is flat on the ground.

153
00:07:21,770 --> 00:07:25,240
From there, we get back
onto the root controller

154
00:07:25,240 --> 00:07:29,390
of the bag, and I will
use its Z rotation axis

155
00:07:29,390 --> 00:07:31,810
to rotate it a bit to the side.

156
00:07:31,810 --> 00:07:35,280
Since the bag is airborne,
its rotation will be linear.

157
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:37,290
And then just after the impact,

158
00:07:37,290 --> 00:07:40,960
I've pushed a little bit
the rotation further,

159
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:42,840
and I've made it ease.

160
00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:46,350
This is to simulate the friction
of the bag on the ground

161
00:07:46,350 --> 00:07:49,220
and the fact that it's slowing down.

162
00:07:49,220 --> 00:07:52,340
The bag is rapidly
stabilizing on the ground,

163
00:07:52,340 --> 00:07:56,883
and I haven't added any bounce
so that it feels very heavy.
