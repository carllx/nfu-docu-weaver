00:00:00,420 --> 00:00:02,001
- [Instructor] We are slowly
but surely getting close

2
00:00:02,001 --> 00:00:03,910
to the end of this chapter,

3
00:00:03,910 --> 00:00:07,400
as we just need to polish
the arm of our character.

4
00:00:07,400 --> 00:00:09,940
It's gonna be very easy
because we will deal

5
00:00:09,940 --> 00:00:13,550
with the arms as a simple,
overlapping motion,

6
00:00:13,550 --> 00:00:16,850
animating the shoulders
in reaction to the torso

7
00:00:16,850 --> 00:00:19,433
the arms in reaction to the shoulders,

8
00:00:19,433 --> 00:00:22,390
and the forearm, hands and fingers

9
00:00:22,390 --> 00:00:25,553
in reaction of their parents in the chain.

10
00:00:26,680 --> 00:00:30,650
To polish the shoulder, I
prefer to hide the arms.

11
00:00:30,650 --> 00:00:33,140
They bring a lot of motion to the screen,

12
00:00:33,140 --> 00:00:34,837
and that could be distracting.

13
00:00:34,837 --> 00:00:38,663
As usual, for most of our
forward kinematic controllers,

14
00:00:38,663 --> 00:00:41,380
I will start with the rotation.

15
00:00:41,380 --> 00:00:44,922
The X rotation channel drives the rotation

16
00:00:44,922 --> 00:00:48,100
that goes up and down on the shoulders,

17
00:00:48,100 --> 00:00:51,300
while the Z rotation drive the forward

18
00:00:51,300 --> 00:00:53,570
and backward motion of the shoulder.

19
00:00:53,570 --> 00:00:56,950
We will then slightly
adjust to Y rotation curve,

20
00:00:56,950 --> 00:01:00,715
but without that much amplitude,
because if you remember

21
00:01:00,715 --> 00:01:03,540
in the rotation video, I explained

22
00:01:03,540 --> 00:01:07,340
that if we go too far
with this third axis,

23
00:01:07,340 --> 00:01:09,950
we may encounter gimble lock.

24
00:01:09,950 --> 00:01:13,320
Here, I'm starting with
the X rotation curve

25
00:01:13,320 --> 00:01:16,559
that drives the up and down
motion of the shoulder.

26
00:01:16,559 --> 00:01:19,330
Editing this curve will be
pretty straight forward,

27
00:01:19,330 --> 00:01:22,356
as we are animating the
shoulders in reaction

28
00:01:22,356 --> 00:01:24,410
to the torso motion.

29
00:01:24,410 --> 00:01:28,473
Whenever the torso is raising,
I will lower the shoulder,

30
00:01:28,473 --> 00:01:31,730
and whenever the torso is falling,

31
00:01:31,730 --> 00:01:33,400
I will raise the shoulder,

32
00:01:33,400 --> 00:01:37,371
and we need to bring extra
contrast on the extremes.

33
00:01:37,371 --> 00:01:41,280
(mumbles) polishing the chest
for the open-and-down motion,

34
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:46,280
we generally mirror or repeat
the cycle over 16 frames,

35
00:01:47,090 --> 00:01:50,240
as the chest is aligned
with the center of gravity,

36
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:54,310
whether we were stepping with
the left foot or right foot,

37
00:01:54,310 --> 00:01:57,260
we had the same up-and-down behavior,

38
00:01:57,260 --> 00:02:00,640
but in the case of the shoulder,
there will be a difference

39
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:03,510
whenever we are hitting
with the right foot

40
00:02:03,510 --> 00:02:06,330
or the left foot, since the chest

41
00:02:06,330 --> 00:02:09,623
is leaning left or right in those cases.

42
00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:14,200
This is why I'm polishing
the whole X curve,

43
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:17,143
not only the frame from zero to 16.

44
00:02:18,200 --> 00:02:20,940
Goal is to add a bit of overlapping motion

45
00:02:20,940 --> 00:02:24,320
to have a relaxed shoulder behavior.

46
00:02:24,320 --> 00:02:27,730
We'll add extra bounce
using the Z location curve

47
00:02:27,730 --> 00:02:28,923
a little later on.

48
00:02:29,910 --> 00:02:32,089
The Z rotation curve on the shoulder

49
00:02:32,089 --> 00:02:34,970
(indistinct) drive the
forward-to-backward motion

50
00:02:34,970 --> 00:02:37,290
is way easier to understand.

51
00:02:37,290 --> 00:02:41,160
It looks like curve that we
have already edited before.

52
00:02:41,160 --> 00:02:44,530
The fast transition
motion, before we ease,

53
00:02:44,530 --> 00:02:48,610
whether in the forward position
or the backward position.

54
00:02:48,610 --> 00:02:51,857
Boom, there is a slight
plateau to hold the pose.

55
00:02:51,857 --> 00:02:55,200
(indistincT) bell-shaped
curve will give you

56
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:59,610
a very smooth motion,
while a more stepped curve

57
00:02:59,610 --> 00:03:02,660
will you give you more contrast in motion.

58
00:03:02,660 --> 00:03:04,600
My preference goes generally

59
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:08,550
toward a more contrasting motion,
which is more interesting.

60
00:03:08,550 --> 00:03:11,313
The curve is just about the
twisting of the shoulder,

61
00:03:12,550 --> 00:03:15,260
which on a human being, is super subtle.

62
00:03:15,260 --> 00:03:17,160
Bend is like a few degrees.

63
00:03:17,160 --> 00:03:19,890
In this regard, I'm
mainly smoothing the curve

64
00:03:19,890 --> 00:03:22,880
so that this wide rotation curve

65
00:03:22,880 --> 00:03:25,860
doesn't show that much on the animation

66
00:03:25,860 --> 00:03:28,580
and we don't get any popping issues.

67
00:03:28,580 --> 00:03:32,150
While I would like to add
extra motion to the shoulder,

68
00:03:32,150 --> 00:03:36,940
using its Z location to bring
a bit of up-and-down bounce,

69
00:03:36,940 --> 00:03:39,420
I've decided to mirror the motion

70
00:03:39,420 --> 00:03:42,650
onto the other shoulder right away.

71
00:03:42,650 --> 00:03:43,760
The idea is just to check

72
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:46,530
if the current polishing of the shoulder

73
00:03:46,530 --> 00:03:50,220
is satisfying before
I bring extra details.

74
00:03:50,220 --> 00:03:51,720
I've done this a lot of time.

75
00:03:51,720 --> 00:03:54,400
You can complete the
curve from one shoulder,

76
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:55,770
then go on to the other.

77
00:03:55,770 --> 00:03:58,690
Press control shift to V to paste them

78
00:03:58,690 --> 00:04:00,891
with the mirror option,
and then duplicate them

79
00:04:00,891 --> 00:04:04,400
on the whole length by 32 frame

80
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:07,403
and offset them back by minus 16 frame.

81
00:04:08,780 --> 00:04:09,730
As explained before,

82
00:04:09,730 --> 00:04:11,870
I want to bring a bit of extra motion

83
00:04:11,870 --> 00:04:13,810
with the shoulder bounce.

84
00:04:13,810 --> 00:04:17,880
This might not be a good idea
on a very slim character,

85
00:04:17,880 --> 00:04:20,000
but since our character
is pretty muscular,

86
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:23,920
it will bring extra
weight to the shoulders

87
00:04:23,920 --> 00:04:26,103
and they will look very relaxed.

88
00:04:27,110 --> 00:04:29,943
So I have isolated the Z location curve

89
00:04:29,943 --> 00:04:32,450
by IDing all the other ones.

90
00:04:32,450 --> 00:04:35,130
Try to focus on the chest motion.

91
00:04:35,130 --> 00:04:36,243
As the chest go down,

92
00:04:36,243 --> 00:04:39,110
we will make the shoulder drag up.

93
00:04:39,110 --> 00:04:41,740
There is a lot of compression, or impact,

94
00:04:41,740 --> 00:04:43,900
on the chest on frame four.

95
00:04:43,900 --> 00:04:47,239
So I'm hitting the lowest
position for the shoulder

96
00:04:47,239 --> 00:04:50,080
two frames later on frame six.

97
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:54,280
Then the character hit its
highest point around frame 10.

98
00:04:54,280 --> 00:04:59,280
So again, I'm pulling the
shoulder up at its highest point

99
00:04:59,490 --> 00:05:02,780
around the frame 12, two frames later.

100
00:05:02,780 --> 00:05:05,080
There is no impact on the up pose.

101
00:05:05,080 --> 00:05:10,080
This is why I have a hold on
the pose, or a slight plateau.

102
00:05:10,269 --> 00:05:14,710
The shoulder hits its extreme
high pose around the frame 12,

103
00:05:14,710 --> 00:05:18,280
and then it drags as
the body is going down.

104
00:05:18,280 --> 00:05:21,720
So it's keeping its up pose a bit

105
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:24,310
while the lowest (indistinct)
changing the curve

106
00:05:24,310 --> 00:05:26,430
on frame six and 22,

107
00:05:26,430 --> 00:05:30,160
mark the impact after
the contacting frame.

108
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:35,160
Again, our curve doesn't
perfectly repeat along 16 frame,

109
00:05:35,350 --> 00:05:39,110
since the torso is leaning left or right

110
00:05:39,110 --> 00:05:41,670
during those 32 frames.

111
00:05:41,670 --> 00:05:45,820
So as the torso is leaning to
the right of the character,

112
00:05:45,820 --> 00:05:50,230
I'm (indistinct) the up
pose of the left shoulder.

113
00:05:50,230 --> 00:05:53,460
I feel like I've reached
a satisfying motion

114
00:05:53,460 --> 00:05:54,600
for the shoulder.

115
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:57,150
I've run a strength test.

116
00:05:57,150 --> 00:05:59,830
So basically, I will increase or decrease

117
00:05:59,830 --> 00:06:04,010
the scale of the current
curve and see how it looks.

118
00:06:04,010 --> 00:06:05,050
It will increase

119
00:06:05,050 --> 00:06:08,250
or decrease the up-and-down
motion of the shoulder

120
00:06:08,250 --> 00:06:10,224
and make it more or less noticeable.

121
00:06:10,224 --> 00:06:14,038
To do so, we will need
to use the 2D cursor

122
00:06:14,038 --> 00:06:15,960
as a pivot point.

123
00:06:15,960 --> 00:06:18,480
So I will first position it properly

124
00:06:18,480 --> 00:06:23,480
by going into the view tab and
setting its Y value to zero.

125
00:06:24,610 --> 00:06:26,790
Then in the pivot point selection,

126
00:06:26,790 --> 00:06:30,950
I will select the 2D cursor
as being the pivot point.

127
00:06:30,950 --> 00:06:33,230
With all the control points selected,

128
00:06:33,230 --> 00:06:37,070
I can press S to scale and
Y to constrain the scaling

129
00:06:37,070 --> 00:06:39,810
along the Y axis of the curve.

130
00:06:39,810 --> 00:06:41,620
Increasing the Y scale

131
00:06:41,620 --> 00:06:45,110
will increase the amplitude of the motion

132
00:06:45,110 --> 00:06:47,260
and make it more noticeable.

133
00:06:47,260 --> 00:06:50,000
Decreasing it will make it more subtle.

134
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,690
What I advise you is to scale the curve

135
00:06:52,690 --> 00:06:54,860
while playing the animation.

136
00:06:54,860 --> 00:06:57,250
This way, you can have
a real-time feedback,

137
00:06:57,250 --> 00:07:01,200
that generally feels better
than modifying the curve

138
00:07:01,200 --> 00:07:03,320
and then playing the motion.

139
00:07:03,320 --> 00:07:05,190
Once I'm happy with the result,

140
00:07:05,190 --> 00:07:08,930
I will mirror the curve
onto the other shoulder.

141
00:07:08,930 --> 00:07:12,552
Don't forget to check your
motion from every angle.

142
00:07:12,552 --> 00:07:15,750
For the up-and-down motion,
we can clearly see it

143
00:07:15,750 --> 00:07:17,760
from the back view of the character.

144
00:07:17,760 --> 00:07:21,520
It's great to make this
up-and-down motion noticeable;

145
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:23,280
don't overdo it, though.

146
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:26,190
In the next video, we are
going to polish the arm

147
00:07:26,190 --> 00:07:27,623
for arms and hands.
