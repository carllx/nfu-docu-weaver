1
00:00:00,220 --> 00:00:02,230
- [Instructor] As our torso controller

2
00:00:02,230 --> 00:00:04,500
is now polished or at least improved,

3
00:00:04,500 --> 00:00:06,680
we can work on the chest.

4
00:00:06,680 --> 00:00:08,820
There is a bit of location variation

5
00:00:08,820 --> 00:00:10,760
in the motion of the chest,

6
00:00:10,760 --> 00:00:14,760
but the main motion are
led by the rotation.

7
00:00:14,760 --> 00:00:18,310
So we will work on the
rotation, our goal is again,

8
00:00:18,310 --> 00:00:20,550
to bring as much contrast as possible

9
00:00:20,550 --> 00:00:22,570
to the animation of the character,

10
00:00:22,570 --> 00:00:25,095
to better communicate the
impact of the punches.

11
00:00:25,095 --> 00:00:27,850
As the center of gravity is dropping down,

12
00:00:27,850 --> 00:00:29,590
I'm raising a bit the chest,

13
00:00:29,590 --> 00:00:32,310
with the X quaternion rotation curve.

14
00:00:32,310 --> 00:00:33,850
Pushing the curve a bit down,

15
00:00:33,850 --> 00:00:37,990
we'll make the chest to drag
while the character is falling.

16
00:00:37,990 --> 00:00:40,190
Then as the character push forward,

17
00:00:40,190 --> 00:00:45,190
I will make him lean a bit
down, pushing the X curve up.

18
00:00:45,870 --> 00:00:47,420
Now working on the Z curve,

19
00:00:47,420 --> 00:00:49,600
I'm removing a bit of the noise,

20
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:51,200
and I'm twisting the character

21
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:54,640
so that he opens a bit
before the jab and then

22
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:57,690
twist his body toward his left arm

23
00:00:57,690 --> 00:01:00,090
to input more power into the jab.

24
00:01:00,090 --> 00:01:02,860
Then, as we did with the
torso root controller,

25
00:01:02,860 --> 00:01:07,860
I will open him a bit more
when he start twisting to throw

26
00:01:08,140 --> 00:01:11,520
the right cross, and as he throw hit,

27
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:14,820
I will accelerate the twisting motion

28
00:01:14,820 --> 00:01:19,260
by shortening the spacing
on the Z rotation curve

29
00:01:19,260 --> 00:01:21,780
meaning that the changes of value

30
00:01:21,780 --> 00:01:25,660
on the Z rotation curve will
be faster or more brutal.

31
00:01:25,660 --> 00:01:27,680
And then we get a slight overshoot

32
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:31,350
as our character has put a
lot of energy to the punch

33
00:01:31,350 --> 00:01:34,080
so his body continued twisting a bit

34
00:01:34,080 --> 00:01:35,800
over a couple of frames.

35
00:01:35,800 --> 00:01:39,490
Now, I'm chasing any pops
into the rotation curve

36
00:01:39,490 --> 00:01:43,400
and see what they are doing,
see if they make sense.

37
00:01:43,400 --> 00:01:46,080
And as you can see, I'm
trying to smooth out

38
00:01:46,080 --> 00:01:46,980
a bit the curve.

39
00:01:46,980 --> 00:01:49,980
What I mean by that is that I first input

40
00:01:49,980 --> 00:01:51,840
the deep contrast into my curve

41
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:55,638
then I watch frame by frame
and I check if my character

42
00:01:55,638 --> 00:01:58,160
is zigzagging or doing some,

43
00:01:58,160 --> 00:02:00,830
weird left to right motion at some point,

44
00:02:00,830 --> 00:02:03,170
and I try to get rid of those.

45
00:02:03,170 --> 00:02:06,490
But I won't be breaking the
main contrast that we have

46
00:02:06,490 --> 00:02:08,722
in the Z curve for example.

47
00:02:08,722 --> 00:02:11,520
With those few improvement on the curve,

48
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:14,710
we have already changed
a lot about the animation

49
00:02:14,710 --> 00:02:16,610
and the impact of the punching.

50
00:02:16,610 --> 00:02:18,480
From there, I will make a quick pass

51
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:21,280
on the rotation curves of the hips.

52
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:23,380
When it comes to polishing the hips,

53
00:02:23,380 --> 00:02:27,620
I generally fix issues
more than I'm trying

54
00:02:27,620 --> 00:02:32,160
to create posies or push
the motion of the hips.

55
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:35,540
For example, here the
character is getting down,

56
00:02:35,540 --> 00:02:38,820
so his hips should be
tilting a bit forward.

57
00:02:38,820 --> 00:02:42,977
I'm fixing this, now he's getting
more weight onto the right

58
00:02:42,977 --> 00:02:45,980
leg here, so using the Y rotation curve,

59
00:02:45,980 --> 00:02:50,980
I will slightly make the hips
tilting towards the right leg.

60
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:53,440
Then we'll tilt up to the right.

61
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:55,310
Governing the Y rotation curves

62
00:02:55,310 --> 00:02:59,100
that drives the tilt to
the left and the right.

63
00:02:59,100 --> 00:03:03,210
Think of which leg is
currently pushing the more

64
00:03:03,210 --> 00:03:06,400
onto the hips and favorize the curve

65
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:08,770
toward the current leg.

66
00:03:08,770 --> 00:03:13,090
Remember that the hips
should not be dragging

67
00:03:13,090 --> 00:03:17,010
compared to the feet,
because the hips are used

68
00:03:17,010 --> 00:03:19,070
to currently drive the legs.

69
00:03:19,070 --> 00:03:22,921
The Z rotation curve will
allow us to twist the hips.

70
00:03:22,921 --> 00:03:27,350
Your key is to keep them
aligned with the feet position,

71
00:03:27,350 --> 00:03:30,580
and whenever we are punching,
we will drag for example,

72
00:03:30,580 --> 00:03:33,310
here the right foot using the hips,

73
00:03:33,310 --> 00:03:38,280
so there will be a lot of Z
rotation, toward the right

74
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:40,420
to pull the right leg.

75
00:03:40,420 --> 00:03:41,920
But what we can do now,

76
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:44,510
to input a bit of dragging into the hips

77
00:03:44,510 --> 00:03:47,710
and create a more impactful animation,

78
00:03:47,710 --> 00:03:50,610
is to use the location
curve and slightly delay

79
00:03:50,610 --> 00:03:54,230
the position of the hips
by pulling them backward

80
00:03:54,230 --> 00:03:57,710
in the beginning of the
punch, and a couple of frames

81
00:03:57,710 --> 00:04:02,170
after the hit, pull them forward
so that they will compress

82
00:04:02,170 --> 00:04:06,420
with the chest, and it feels
like the hips of the character,

83
00:04:06,420 --> 00:04:09,600
have a lot of momentum
and have a lot of weight,

84
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:13,073
and so they are projected
forward during the punch.

85
00:04:13,073 --> 00:04:15,600
This is something we've
been doing with the head

86
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:18,230
of the squirrel character
in chapter three.

87
00:04:18,230 --> 00:04:20,030
And once I'm done with the hips,

88
00:04:20,030 --> 00:04:21,890
I will do the same with the chest,

89
00:04:21,890 --> 00:04:24,960
as the body of the
character is moving forward,

90
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:27,850
the chest is slightly pulled backward,

91
00:04:27,850 --> 00:04:31,810
compressed toward the hips,
and just after the hit,

92
00:04:31,810 --> 00:04:36,340
the chest is projected forward,
so you can see on frame 17,

93
00:04:36,340 --> 00:04:39,340
the curve is pulling down the compression,

94
00:04:39,340 --> 00:04:42,450
then it's projected for
a couple of frame forward

95
00:04:42,450 --> 00:04:47,450
on frame 18 and 19, and
then the chest will recover

96
00:04:47,550 --> 00:04:50,680
with a slight overshoot, and
then the curve will slowly,

97
00:04:50,680 --> 00:04:54,440
he's to zero in the
rest pose of the chest.

98
00:04:54,440 --> 00:04:58,130
This means that the chest
has absorbed it's momentum.

99
00:04:58,130 --> 00:05:01,800
Remember that your audience is
going to see your animation,

100
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:04,522
through the camera view, while
we are trying to make our

101
00:05:04,522 --> 00:05:08,740
animation looks good from
every angle as an exercise,

102
00:05:08,740 --> 00:05:12,800
you need to often check your
animation for the camera view.

103
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:16,980
And we may input more details
into the animation later on,

104
00:05:16,980 --> 00:05:18,960
to favorize this camera view.

105
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:20,960
What I wanted to show you here is that

106
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:23,610
you can use the tweaker bone of the chest

107
00:05:23,610 --> 00:05:26,900
on the base of the neck
and the base of the hips,

108
00:05:26,900 --> 00:05:28,850
and calculate their motion path,

109
00:05:28,850 --> 00:05:31,640
to see how it looks in the camera view.

110
00:05:31,640 --> 00:05:34,430
And here we can see we have two nice arcs,

111
00:05:34,430 --> 00:05:37,580
we've an ease in and
ease out during the step,

112
00:05:37,580 --> 00:05:38,470
and the punch.

113
00:05:38,470 --> 00:05:42,900
Another useful trick you can
use is to create trackers,

114
00:05:42,900 --> 00:05:46,760
so I will add the simple sphere
and I will scale it down.

115
00:05:46,760 --> 00:05:50,980
Then in the properties panel,
we can create a new material.

116
00:05:50,980 --> 00:05:54,300
We will call this tracker
and we don't need to play

117
00:05:54,300 --> 00:05:55,840
with the material properties,

118
00:05:55,840 --> 00:05:59,180
but only the viewport visibility setting.

119
00:05:59,180 --> 00:06:01,750
And I will give it a yellowish color.

120
00:06:01,750 --> 00:06:04,010
Then I will create another bone,

121
00:06:04,010 --> 00:06:06,360
I will duplicate the material,

122
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:10,650
give it another color and
repeat the process a third time.

123
00:06:10,650 --> 00:06:14,520
From there, what we can
do is add a constraint

124
00:06:14,520 --> 00:06:18,110
to the sphere so that they
will copy the location

125
00:06:18,110 --> 00:06:19,150
of the chosen bone.

126
00:06:19,150 --> 00:06:22,780
With the yellow sphere
selected, I will add up

127
00:06:22,780 --> 00:06:26,590
to the constraint panel,
add it a copy location,

128
00:06:26,590 --> 00:06:30,320
then I will source the trident armature,

129
00:06:30,320 --> 00:06:32,858
and in the bone section,
I will start typing chest,

130
00:06:32,858 --> 00:06:36,080
and then search for the chest to tweaker.

131
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:39,500
Now, the sphere has snapped
onto the tweaker controller,

132
00:06:39,500 --> 00:06:43,070
but we can't see it because
it clips with the character.

133
00:06:43,070 --> 00:06:45,600
So we can go into the object properties,

134
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:49,290
and in the viewport
displays, set it to infant,

135
00:06:49,290 --> 00:06:52,660
so that it will be shown
over our character.

136
00:06:52,660 --> 00:06:55,890
So from there, you can
duplicate the sphere,

137
00:06:55,890 --> 00:06:57,940
as many times as you want,

138
00:06:57,940 --> 00:07:02,150
and change its constraints so
that it will snap to the head,

139
00:07:02,150 --> 00:07:04,620
for example, and the hips.

140
00:07:04,620 --> 00:07:07,620
I will then do the same with
the blue and red sphere,

141
00:07:07,620 --> 00:07:09,977
and I will snap them onto the elbows,

142
00:07:09,977 --> 00:07:13,850
the fist, the feet, and the knees.

143
00:07:13,850 --> 00:07:16,570
Whenever you are searching
for a bone to target,

144
00:07:16,570 --> 00:07:19,040
just search for knee, elbow,

145
00:07:19,040 --> 00:07:23,320
and choose wherever you
want the .L or .R bone,

146
00:07:23,320 --> 00:07:26,060
that mean left or right bone.

147
00:07:26,060 --> 00:07:30,690
I advise you to wherever
snap to the DEF bone,

148
00:07:30,690 --> 00:07:34,150
that means deformation,
those are the bones

149
00:07:34,150 --> 00:07:37,210
that are currently making
our character move,

150
00:07:37,210 --> 00:07:41,390
or the tweaker bone, that are
pretty low into the hierarchy,

151
00:07:41,390 --> 00:07:44,810
so whatever kind of
mechanism you are using,

152
00:07:44,810 --> 00:07:48,170
like forward kinematic
or inverse kinematic,

153
00:07:48,170 --> 00:07:51,810
they will always move and
follow your character.

154
00:07:51,810 --> 00:07:55,401
From there, you can freely
scale those trackers

155
00:07:55,401 --> 00:07:58,350
that it better fits the
shape of your character.

156
00:07:58,350 --> 00:08:01,020
Then you can select them
all, and in the 3D view,

157
00:08:01,020 --> 00:08:04,830
press M, to move them
into a new collection.

158
00:08:04,830 --> 00:08:07,500
I've created a collection called tracker,

159
00:08:07,500 --> 00:08:11,160
and so from there, I can
easily hide my character

160
00:08:11,160 --> 00:08:14,930
if I want to, and only
see those bone moving.

161
00:08:14,930 --> 00:08:19,610
This will help you to spot
any glitches in your motion,

162
00:08:19,610 --> 00:08:23,330
or to have a different
view over your animation.

163
00:08:23,330 --> 00:08:25,200
I'm not saying this is necessary,

164
00:08:25,200 --> 00:08:27,376
but the fact that you have
a different view of all your

165
00:08:27,376 --> 00:08:31,960
animation, will help you to
spot the problem or to focus on

166
00:08:31,960 --> 00:08:35,400
the important part,
like the arcs of the end

167
00:08:35,400 --> 00:08:37,423
on the cross, for example.

168
00:08:38,270 --> 00:08:41,390
So let's now get back to
our actual characters.

169
00:08:41,390 --> 00:08:44,720
Since we are going to unmake
the neck and the head,

170
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:47,120
we don't need to see the hops.

171
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:49,160
So I will simply hide them.

172
00:08:49,160 --> 00:08:52,650
Our goal is going to add
some overlapping motion

173
00:08:52,650 --> 00:08:56,610
and dragging to the head, by
first playing with the rotation

174
00:08:56,610 --> 00:08:59,930
of the neck, and then
work with the rotation

175
00:08:59,930 --> 00:09:01,810
and location of the head.

176
00:09:01,810 --> 00:09:04,460
I've isolated the rotation
channel of the neck,

177
00:09:04,460 --> 00:09:06,720
and we will start the X rotation,

178
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:09,840
which is the up and down rotation.

179
00:09:09,840 --> 00:09:14,180
As the body is going down,
the neck is raising a bit.

180
00:09:14,180 --> 00:09:18,510
I will hold for a couple of
frame, and then as our character

181
00:09:18,510 --> 00:09:22,650
is pushing forward, we will
transition and make the neck

182
00:09:22,650 --> 00:09:24,230
dive a bit forward.

183
00:09:24,230 --> 00:09:27,100
Those overlapping motion
are going to support

184
00:09:27,100 --> 00:09:28,990
the current animation.

185
00:09:28,990 --> 00:09:32,530
But since they are further
away from the initial rotation

186
00:09:32,530 --> 00:09:36,280
point, which is the center
of gravity of our character,

187
00:09:36,280 --> 00:09:39,530
the curve will be slightly
smoother than the center

188
00:09:39,530 --> 00:09:42,780
of gravity or the chest.

189
00:09:42,780 --> 00:09:46,910
The further away from your
region of the rotation you are,

190
00:09:46,910 --> 00:09:48,620
the smoother will be your curve,

191
00:09:48,620 --> 00:09:51,610
and the smoother will be
the overlapping motion.

192
00:09:51,610 --> 00:09:56,000
When working on the neck, first
work on the X curve as I did

193
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,120
so when the character is going down,

194
00:09:58,120 --> 00:10:01,960
the neck goes up a bit, and
when the character change

195
00:10:01,960 --> 00:10:05,070
direction and goes up, the neck drops.

196
00:10:05,070 --> 00:10:08,010
But don't exaggerate
too much those dragging,

197
00:10:08,010 --> 00:10:11,964
or it will feel like your
character is unable to hold

198
00:10:11,964 --> 00:10:14,900
his own head, and it will look weird.

199
00:10:14,900 --> 00:10:17,430
I will now repeat the
process with the head.

200
00:10:17,430 --> 00:10:20,210
I will start with the X rotational curve,

201
00:10:20,210 --> 00:10:22,370
and as the character goes down,

202
00:10:22,370 --> 00:10:24,300
I will slightly raise the head,

203
00:10:24,300 --> 00:10:27,010
raise the chin of the character.

204
00:10:27,010 --> 00:10:29,670
And then when he start to come forward,

205
00:10:29,670 --> 00:10:33,440
I will slightly make the
head dive into the punch.

206
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:35,430
When pushing the curve down,

207
00:10:35,430 --> 00:10:39,110
the head is racing, when
pushing the curve up,

208
00:10:39,110 --> 00:10:41,430
the head is leaning forward.

209
00:10:41,430 --> 00:10:45,240
So when the chest of the character
is diving into the punch,

210
00:10:45,240 --> 00:10:47,370
I'm raising the head a bit.

211
00:10:47,370 --> 00:10:52,080
And once he's coming back,
I'm pushing the head forward,

212
00:10:52,080 --> 00:10:54,350
rotating toward the ground.

213
00:10:54,350 --> 00:10:57,500
Then to tweak the head, tilt and twist,

214
00:10:57,500 --> 00:10:59,670
I will switch to the front view.

215
00:10:59,670 --> 00:11:02,060
And I will play with the Z rotation curve,

216
00:11:02,060 --> 00:11:03,760
and the Y rotation curve.

217
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:07,720
Between frame 10 and 12, you
can see I have a big head pop.

218
00:11:07,720 --> 00:11:11,120
And since my current head
curve are pretty smooth,

219
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:14,340
it means that the problem
comes from a controller

220
00:11:14,340 --> 00:11:16,570
previous in the chain.

221
00:11:16,570 --> 00:11:19,400
So it's currently the torso controller.

222
00:11:19,400 --> 00:11:21,130
When you have this kind of problem,

223
00:11:21,130 --> 00:11:24,960
just to double check the
previous controllers in the chain

224
00:11:24,960 --> 00:11:27,900
until you find the ones that is big.

225
00:11:27,900 --> 00:11:30,990
So here we can see that
on the Z quaternion curve

226
00:11:30,990 --> 00:11:34,370
of the torso controller,
we have a big change.

227
00:11:34,370 --> 00:11:37,790
I will just smooth it a bit,
and now it looks better.

228
00:11:37,790 --> 00:11:40,410
So from there, I can go back onto the head

229
00:11:40,410 --> 00:11:43,390
and make sure that the heads drags a bit

230
00:11:43,390 --> 00:11:45,310
whenever it's rotating to the left,

231
00:11:45,310 --> 00:11:47,800
to the right up and down.

232
00:11:47,800 --> 00:11:51,330
The idea is not to make
the head wobbling around,

233
00:11:51,330 --> 00:11:54,220
but just give it a slight dragging motion.

234
00:11:54,220 --> 00:11:57,460
From there, we can play a
bit with the head location.

235
00:11:57,460 --> 00:12:01,150
I will only be using the head Y location,

236
00:12:01,150 --> 00:12:03,930
and when the body of the
character will be moving

237
00:12:03,930 --> 00:12:08,110
very rapidly forward, I
will slightly push the head

238
00:12:08,110 --> 00:12:11,280
inward toward the shoulders.

239
00:12:11,280 --> 00:12:14,400
And as the second punch is done,

240
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:16,320
I will pull the head toward the back.

241
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:19,890
The head is projected forward and backward

242
00:12:19,890 --> 00:12:22,910
based on its weight and its momentum.

243
00:12:22,910 --> 00:12:25,670
And as a micro detail, you can play

244
00:12:25,670 --> 00:12:29,370
with the head tweaker bone
on the top of the head,

245
00:12:29,370 --> 00:12:32,560
and stretch a bit the head
when it's pulling back

246
00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:34,980
just a touch, and as it stopped,

247
00:12:34,980 --> 00:12:37,260
you can squash it a little bit.

248
00:12:37,260 --> 00:12:39,130
Those are super subtle smiles,

249
00:12:39,130 --> 00:12:41,460
but they will improve
a bit your animation.

250
00:12:41,460 --> 00:12:43,693
From there, I will double
check the animation

251
00:12:43,693 --> 00:12:45,360
from the camera view.

252
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:48,610
And then I will fine tweak
the rotation of the head.

253
00:12:48,610 --> 00:12:52,430
I'm trying to spot the moments
where I could be showing

254
00:12:52,430 --> 00:12:54,230
both eyes of the character.

255
00:12:54,230 --> 00:12:58,280
This will help your audience
to connect with the character.

256
00:12:58,280 --> 00:13:01,760
So whenever he's throwing
or preparing to throw

257
00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:04,550
the jab hold the right cross.

258
00:13:04,550 --> 00:13:07,520
You can see that by simply
pushing a bit down the

259
00:13:07,520 --> 00:13:11,010
the Z quartanion curve, I
can slightly twist the head

260
00:13:11,010 --> 00:13:13,970
toward the camera and
you'll see both eyes.

261
00:13:13,970 --> 00:13:16,500
That's subtle, that's just a detail,

262
00:13:16,500 --> 00:13:19,560
but it may or might do the difference

263
00:13:19,560 --> 00:13:21,833
between the good and a great animation.
