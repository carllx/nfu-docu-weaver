1
00:00:01,020 --> 00:00:03,292
- [Pierre] In this video,
we are going to create

2
00:00:03,292 --> 00:00:06,410
the artillery shot animation.

3
00:00:06,410 --> 00:00:10,130
Again, we will rely a lot
on the space switching

4
00:00:10,130 --> 00:00:11,480
to achieve it.

5
00:00:11,480 --> 00:00:15,600
We can start from our cling
action and duplicate it.

6
00:00:15,600 --> 00:00:17,608
The idea is to have our robot standing

7
00:00:17,608 --> 00:00:21,290
with its two feet planted in the ground.

8
00:00:21,290 --> 00:00:22,510
I've renamed the action

9
00:00:22,510 --> 00:00:24,518
and I will click the little shield icon

10
00:00:24,518 --> 00:00:27,520
to make sure that I
won't lose the animation.

11
00:00:27,520 --> 00:00:30,709
Since the rotation range of
the cannon is a bit limited,

12
00:00:30,709 --> 00:00:33,940
I will also select the
head of the character

13
00:00:33,940 --> 00:00:36,000
and slightly rotate it back.

14
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,755
The process is the same
as for the walk cycle.

15
00:00:38,755 --> 00:00:41,199
I will first create a base motion

16
00:00:41,199 --> 00:00:45,730
and then we will propagate
each using space switching.

17
00:00:45,730 --> 00:00:47,780
The shot is a very fast action,

18
00:00:47,780 --> 00:00:49,860
so I will jump on frame four

19
00:00:49,860 --> 00:00:53,470
and I will pull back the recoil control.

20
00:00:53,470 --> 00:00:55,940
What I noticed while playing the animation

21
00:00:55,940 --> 00:00:57,520
is that it was repeating,

22
00:00:57,520 --> 00:01:00,540
there is probably a cycling quantifier.

23
00:01:00,540 --> 00:01:03,840
So I will select all the
keys of all the controllers

24
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:06,910
and press shift E and clear cyclic.

25
00:01:06,910 --> 00:01:07,743
From there.

26
00:01:07,743 --> 00:01:11,350
I will directly jump into the
graph editor and I we'll work

27
00:01:11,350 --> 00:01:14,500
on the curve of the record controller.

28
00:01:14,500 --> 00:01:17,550
Since it's kind of an instant motion

29
00:01:17,550 --> 00:01:21,480
I will select the first
key frame of the recalling

30
00:01:21,480 --> 00:01:24,920
controller and convert it to vector.

31
00:01:24,920 --> 00:01:27,540
The idea is that the
controller is pushed back

32
00:01:27,540 --> 00:01:28,560
at full speed

33
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:31,950
right at the beginning,
the moment where we shoot

34
00:01:31,950 --> 00:01:34,020
With the artillery, it gets

35
00:01:34,020 --> 00:01:36,897
Very fast to its extreme on frame four.

36
00:01:36,897 --> 00:01:41,690
And then I will duplicate the
very first frame onto frame 10

37
00:01:41,690 --> 00:01:46,000
so that the controller gets
back into its position.

38
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,980
Then I played the
animation a couple of time

39
00:01:48,980 --> 00:01:50,440
and tweaked the curve.

40
00:01:50,440 --> 00:01:53,880
In the end, I set the extreme on frame two

41
00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:57,880
and reset the position of
the controller on frame seven

42
00:01:57,880 --> 00:02:01,380
Played the animation a
couple of more time, and then

43
00:02:01,380 --> 00:02:05,080
decided it was better
to sit in final position

44
00:02:05,080 --> 00:02:06,320
on frame nine.

45
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:09,360
So we have the base motion of the Canon.

46
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:13,960
Now we need to move the root
of the torso of the robot to

47
00:02:13,960 --> 00:02:15,580
keep the exercise simple.

48
00:02:15,580 --> 00:02:18,344
I will just walk on the Y axis.

49
00:02:18,344 --> 00:02:21,670
We've my torso root controller selected.

50
00:02:21,670 --> 00:02:25,770
I will directly jump into
the graph editor and hide

51
00:02:25,770 --> 00:02:29,210
everything but the Y location axis,

52
00:02:29,210 --> 00:02:31,040
since the recall controller,

53
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:34,913
or Canon controller reach
it's extreme on frame two

54
00:02:34,913 --> 00:02:38,870
I will take the very first
frame of the route controller

55
00:02:38,870 --> 00:02:41,049
and duplicate it on frame two.

56
00:02:41,049 --> 00:02:43,040
The ideas that the record

57
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:48,040
motion start when the Canon is
pushing the whole body back.

58
00:02:48,740 --> 00:02:51,700
Now we can add a key frame on frame 10

59
00:02:51,700 --> 00:02:55,880
and move the curve up so
that our character torso

60
00:02:55,880 --> 00:02:57,380
is moving back.

61
00:02:57,380 --> 00:03:00,140
Then I will reset the pose of

62
00:03:00,140 --> 00:03:03,060
The character around frame 23.

63
00:03:03,060 --> 00:03:05,400
Again, this is a creative process.

64
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:08,440
If you want, you can use other values.

65
00:03:08,440 --> 00:03:11,800
I'm here to teach you in
the method, not all to

66
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:14,430
make this specific animation.

67
00:03:14,430 --> 00:03:17,840
I will create a more
easing on the back position

68
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:19,360
by scaling the curve.

69
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:24,120
And I will make the first angle
to be vector because again

70
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:29,050
I don't want any easing into
the recoil, the recoil start

71
00:03:29,050 --> 00:03:30,160
at full speed.

72
00:03:30,160 --> 00:03:35,160
Then it eases into frame
10, and it finally gets back

73
00:03:35,270 --> 00:03:37,860
with easing onto frame 23.

74
00:03:37,860 --> 00:03:41,630
As I watch the motion, I feel
like the robot is a bit out

75
00:03:41,630 --> 00:03:43,990
of balance, so I will
select the whole curve

76
00:03:43,990 --> 00:03:46,360
and slightly offset it down.

77
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:49,720
But the character is positioned
more forward onto his feet.

78
00:03:49,720 --> 00:03:52,980
When he's going to shoot,
it's important to watch out

79
00:03:52,980 --> 00:03:55,670
for the center of gravity
of your character, so

80
00:03:55,670 --> 00:03:58,200
that it looks balanced when shooting.

81
00:03:58,200 --> 00:04:00,830
And so the shot looks more believable

82
00:04:03,403 --> 00:04:04,450
(Wooshing Noises)

83
00:04:04,450 --> 00:04:08,300
Before we start animating
the head of the character,

84
00:04:08,300 --> 00:04:12,042
I will just add a very
slight rotation to the Canon.

85
00:04:12,042 --> 00:04:15,140
In the end, we will use
also space switching to

86
00:04:15,140 --> 00:04:17,710
add more emotion to the Canon

87
00:04:17,710 --> 00:04:20,410
but the idea is just to have some kind

88
00:04:20,410 --> 00:04:22,560
of passive motion or rate.

89
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:26,590
I don't think it's necessary
though, but it's very fast.

90
00:04:26,590 --> 00:04:31,275
It's just one key frame on
frame four or five, to get a bit

91
00:04:31,275 --> 00:04:36,260
of rotation back and switch
the first handle to vector.

92
00:04:36,260 --> 00:04:37,971
Then I will dial the angle

93
00:04:37,971 --> 00:04:41,810
by reducing the amplitude
of the curve and we are done

94
00:04:41,810 --> 00:04:44,520
and we can jump onto the head controller.

95
00:04:44,520 --> 00:04:47,410
In this video, we are
going to repeat a lot

96
00:04:47,410 --> 00:04:50,598
of thing we have done
during the walk cycle

97
00:04:50,598 --> 00:04:52,920
meaning that we will use a lot

98
00:04:52,920 --> 00:04:56,900
of copy location and a lot of end space.

99
00:04:56,900 --> 00:04:58,630
The only things that will change is

100
00:04:58,630 --> 00:05:02,000
all we offset the curve in time.

101
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,387
Instead of creating a delay

102
00:05:04,387 --> 00:05:07,180
we will make the curve move back

103
00:05:07,180 --> 00:05:09,780
in time so that the head motion

104
00:05:09,780 --> 00:05:13,430
occurs before the bud in motion, this way

105
00:05:13,430 --> 00:05:18,370
we will fake the fact that
the motion is led by the head.

106
00:05:18,370 --> 00:05:20,790
First let's work with the location of yet.

107
00:05:20,790 --> 00:05:23,040
I've added an empty, I will make sure

108
00:05:23,040 --> 00:05:27,330
that it's displayed in
front and on the armature

109
00:05:27,330 --> 00:05:31,040
in the armature viewpoint
display, I will enable names

110
00:05:31,040 --> 00:05:35,850
and axis it will just help us
identifying the bone with ease

111
00:05:35,850 --> 00:05:39,370
Back on my empty, I
will add a copy location

112
00:05:39,370 --> 00:05:44,130
as usual source our armature,
and then the head controller.

113
00:05:44,130 --> 00:05:45,610
I will bake the action

114
00:05:45,610 --> 00:05:50,180
For this specific animation,
I've used 30 frames on it.

115
00:05:50,180 --> 00:05:53,220
Then get rid of the user's
curve, If you want a gain.

116
00:05:53,220 --> 00:05:54,890
It doesn't matter.

117
00:05:54,890 --> 00:05:57,680
DMT is following the add motion.

118
00:05:57,680 --> 00:06:00,210
Let's now reverse the constraint

119
00:06:00,210 --> 00:06:02,980
go to the head bone inputs mode

120
00:06:02,980 --> 00:06:07,690
add to it a copy location,
constraint and source the empty.

121
00:06:07,690 --> 00:06:10,800
We can now get back to
the empty and instead

122
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:15,090
of offsetting the curve to
the right filtering time

123
00:06:15,090 --> 00:06:17,770
we'll offset to the left back in time.

124
00:06:17,770 --> 00:06:21,230
And now the head moves before the torso.

125
00:06:21,230 --> 00:06:23,960
I will offset it back by one key frame.

126
00:06:23,960 --> 00:06:28,090
So is that there is a bit
of delay between the shot

127
00:06:28,090 --> 00:06:32,390
and the head motion, but
the head motions still occur

128
00:06:32,390 --> 00:06:36,960
before the torso root motion,
as I'm happy with the result

129
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:40,090
I will bake the action
onto the head, boom.

130
00:06:40,090 --> 00:06:42,953
And now we can work on the head rotation

131
00:06:42,953 --> 00:06:45,810
since the Canon is a child of the head

132
00:06:45,810 --> 00:06:49,510
whenever the head will rotate,
the cannon will rotate too.

133
00:06:49,510 --> 00:06:51,260
And I don't really want that

134
00:06:51,260 --> 00:06:54,730
because the Canon was supposed
to lead the animation.

135
00:06:54,730 --> 00:06:59,290
So what I will do is that I
will create an aim constraint

136
00:06:59,290 --> 00:07:01,870
or tracking constraint for the gun

137
00:07:01,870 --> 00:07:06,200
and we will keep this constraint
to the end of the animation

138
00:07:06,200 --> 00:07:10,270
so that the gun will always
be pointing at the same target

139
00:07:10,270 --> 00:07:13,890
while we are working on the
different part of the robot.

140
00:07:13,890 --> 00:07:15,710
So you should know the process now

141
00:07:15,710 --> 00:07:19,901
but I will repeat it either way
first, add a copy, transform

142
00:07:19,901 --> 00:07:23,160
to the empty, then press control-A

143
00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:25,690
and apply the visual transform.

144
00:07:25,690 --> 00:07:28,460
From there, We can get treated of the copy

145
00:07:28,460 --> 00:07:33,460
transform constraint and move
the empty on its local Y axis.

146
00:07:34,310 --> 00:07:39,150
Then we need to make it a
child of the artillery pivot

147
00:07:39,150 --> 00:07:42,690
so that it will follow its current motion.

148
00:07:42,690 --> 00:07:44,440
So I will select it.

149
00:07:44,440 --> 00:07:48,480
Use a child of constraint,
source the armature

150
00:07:48,480 --> 00:07:51,830
and then the Archer re-pivot controller.

151
00:07:51,830 --> 00:07:55,080
We will click setting verse
to reset it's position

152
00:07:55,080 --> 00:07:57,140
and bake it's action.

153
00:07:57,140 --> 00:08:01,610
Now I will select the
artillery pivot controller

154
00:08:01,610 --> 00:08:05,800
and I will add to it a
locked truck constraint

155
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:08,320
targeting the empty.

156
00:08:08,320 --> 00:08:09,630
The gun is pointing

157
00:08:09,630 --> 00:08:12,950
On it's minus Y axis

158
00:08:12,950 --> 00:08:16,410
and rotating around its X axis.

159
00:08:16,410 --> 00:08:19,740
As soon as I saw the empty, the gun

160
00:08:19,740 --> 00:08:23,950
We'll always aim an empty
and whatever the motion

161
00:08:23,950 --> 00:08:27,560
of the head cannon will point a DMT.

162
00:08:27,560 --> 00:08:30,310
We've the limitation of the hydraulics

163
00:08:30,310 --> 00:08:33,970
and the rotation angle of its controller.

164
00:08:33,970 --> 00:08:35,900
So we can keep this constraint

165
00:08:35,900 --> 00:08:39,320
and now work on the rotation of the head.

166
00:08:39,320 --> 00:08:42,260
Since this is something
we have done a lot of time

167
00:08:42,260 --> 00:08:44,490
I will slightly speed up the video.

168
00:08:44,490 --> 00:08:46,430
I've created a new empty

169
00:08:46,430 --> 00:08:49,380
I will add to it, a copy transform.

170
00:08:49,380 --> 00:08:53,550
Source the armature then source
the head controller apply

171
00:08:53,550 --> 00:08:57,500
its visual transform and get
treated of the constraint.

172
00:08:57,500 --> 00:09:01,610
But the trick here is that I
won't be upsetting it forward

173
00:09:01,610 --> 00:09:06,610
on the y-axis since we don't
have any upended motion

174
00:09:06,860 --> 00:09:09,460
but I will offset to down.

175
00:09:09,460 --> 00:09:12,620
As the body moves back and
forth, it's better to get

176
00:09:12,620 --> 00:09:17,620
to this pendulum motion based
on the Z axis from there

177
00:09:18,040 --> 00:09:21,980
the process will be exactly
the same as what we did before.

178
00:09:21,980 --> 00:09:24,020
During the walk cycle.

179
00:09:24,020 --> 00:09:25,840
First, I will add a child

180
00:09:25,840 --> 00:09:29,730
of constraint to DMT target the armature.

181
00:09:29,730 --> 00:09:32,650
Then you hit controller set inverse.

182
00:09:32,650 --> 00:09:36,836
They take the action, then
select the head controller

183
00:09:36,836 --> 00:09:41,836
add a dumped truck, constraint
and target the empty.

184
00:09:42,900 --> 00:09:47,180
But this time I will use the minus Z axis

185
00:09:47,180 --> 00:09:51,860
of the head controller
instead of the minus Y axis.

186
00:09:51,860 --> 00:09:55,137
And now I can offset the curve in time.

187
00:09:55,137 --> 00:09:58,980
So as usual, you have to
experiment, try offsetting

188
00:09:58,980 --> 00:10:01,290
to the left so that the rotation will

189
00:10:01,290 --> 00:10:04,148
occur before the translation of the head

190
00:10:04,148 --> 00:10:08,450
or try the other way, offset
the curves to the right

191
00:10:08,450 --> 00:10:13,450
so that the head rotation
is based on its translation.

192
00:10:13,450 --> 00:10:16,740
Plus the position of the target, our empty

193
00:10:16,740 --> 00:10:21,610
with variants under or,
upon the head will kind

194
00:10:21,610 --> 00:10:26,009
of change the behavior
sometimes, delaying the curve.

195
00:10:26,009 --> 00:10:29,367
We'll make the head kind of moving

196
00:10:29,367 --> 00:10:32,520
before it's current translation.

197
00:10:32,520 --> 00:10:37,120
Why if DMT was upon the
head and we were targeting

198
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:41,114
toward the positive Z
axis in the constraint

199
00:10:41,114 --> 00:10:45,210
offsetting the curve the
same way we'll kind of

200
00:10:45,210 --> 00:10:48,250
reversed the head rotation.

201
00:10:48,250 --> 00:10:53,250
So you have to experiment the
reason, no like golden method

202
00:10:53,560 --> 00:10:56,130
try offsetting the curve left to right

203
00:10:56,130 --> 00:10:59,670
check out the behavior of the controller.

204
00:10:59,670 --> 00:11:02,030
And then just guess all you want to

205
00:11:02,030 --> 00:11:06,780
work the final touch here
was to edit the empty curve

206
00:11:06,780 --> 00:11:10,307
to get a slight overshoot
of the head rotation

207
00:11:10,307 --> 00:11:13,770
and this loose motion of the rotation.

208
00:11:13,770 --> 00:11:17,418
So I've used the baked curve as a guide.

209
00:11:17,418 --> 00:11:21,195
And then I reworked the
curve by removing most

210
00:11:21,195 --> 00:11:25,320
of the key frame and
smoothing the curve shape

211
00:11:25,320 --> 00:11:28,350
as we did during the walk cycle.

212
00:11:28,350 --> 00:11:30,220
So as usual, it's a matter

213
00:11:30,220 --> 00:11:33,100
of spending time on to your animation

214
00:11:33,100 --> 00:11:37,080
but the location motion of
the head is the snap here.

215
00:11:37,080 --> 00:11:41,210
And then since the rotation
is kind of reacting to this

216
00:11:41,210 --> 00:11:42,975
I've made it quite smooth.

217
00:11:42,975 --> 00:11:44,940
Now you also want to show

218
00:11:44,940 --> 00:11:48,810
that this robot is made to
shoot with the artillery.

219
00:11:48,810 --> 00:11:49,980
So I bring a bit

220
00:11:49,980 --> 00:11:53,170
of smoothness to the motion
showing more control than

221
00:11:53,170 --> 00:11:55,510
If it was wobbling all around.

222
00:11:55,510 --> 00:11:57,680
From there, I've repeated the process

223
00:11:57,680 --> 00:12:02,140
for the body controller, the
arms, the hips, et cetera

224
00:12:02,140 --> 00:12:06,840
this way I've slowly
propagated the recoil motion

225
00:12:06,840 --> 00:12:11,360
from the gunshot on to the
whole body of the character.

226
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:16,360
The final touch was to add a
very subtle up and down motion

227
00:12:16,570 --> 00:12:21,230
to one of the feet as if
the robot was pushed back

228
00:12:21,230 --> 00:12:25,100
by the recoil and kind of
losing a bit of balance.

229
00:12:25,100 --> 00:12:26,830
I've made this motion only

230
00:12:26,830 --> 00:12:30,350
on one foot to break the
twinning in the animation.

231
00:12:30,350 --> 00:12:32,370
and make it look more natural

232
00:12:32,370 --> 00:12:35,080
more random in a way to do so.

233
00:12:35,080 --> 00:12:38,420
I've just walked a beat
on the Hill controller

234
00:12:38,420 --> 00:12:41,630
and then animated the
front two in reaction.

235
00:12:41,630 --> 00:12:43,007
This is very simple.

236
00:12:43,007 --> 00:12:46,710
So I will let you there
with this animation.

237
00:12:46,710 --> 00:12:48,440
And in the next video

238
00:12:48,440 --> 00:12:53,300
you will find a slow paced
time-lapse of the whole process.

239
00:12:53,300 --> 00:12:55,710
This is something we have repeated a lot

240
00:12:55,710 --> 00:12:57,230
in the previous videos.

241
00:12:57,230 --> 00:12:59,310
So if you don't feel comfortable

242
00:12:59,310 --> 00:13:02,988
do not hesitate to rewatch
the work cycle process

243
00:13:02,988 --> 00:13:06,407
as we are using exactly the same process.

244
00:13:06,407 --> 00:13:11,035
And don't forget to check
out the axis I'm using

245
00:13:11,035 --> 00:13:14,580
depending on the controller, I'm moving

246
00:13:14,580 --> 00:13:19,020
for these specific animation
regarding the body controllers.

247
00:13:19,020 --> 00:13:23,440
I was mostly using in space, downward

248
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:27,910
and space downward on the minus Z axis

249
00:13:27,910 --> 00:13:32,200
so that I can source the back
and forth motion of the body.
