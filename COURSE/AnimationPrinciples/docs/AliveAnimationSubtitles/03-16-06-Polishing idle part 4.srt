00:00:00,860 --> 00:00:03,450
- [Instructor] For this new
segment of the animation

2
00:00:03,450 --> 00:00:06,890
instead of polishing the
body controller first,

3
00:00:06,890 --> 00:00:09,850
I re-timed the feet steps.

4
00:00:09,850 --> 00:00:13,610
The idea is to avoid the
twinning as explained before

5
00:00:13,610 --> 00:00:17,440
and having all the feet
contacting with the ground

6
00:00:17,440 --> 00:00:18,600
at the same time.

7
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:22,650
You can see here that each
feet is contacting the ground

8
00:00:22,650 --> 00:00:24,563
with an offset of one frame.

9
00:00:25,670 --> 00:00:29,480
The goal here is not
to polish the feet step

10
00:00:29,480 --> 00:00:32,260
but just to refine the timing.

11
00:00:32,260 --> 00:00:35,680
So I'm using the action in
the tone or the graffiti tone

12
00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:37,380
because it's easier to read.

13
00:00:37,380 --> 00:00:40,940
I can easily find whenever
the foot controller

14
00:00:40,940 --> 00:00:43,940
is changing position and change the timing

15
00:00:43,940 --> 00:00:46,280
by offsetting those key frames.

16
00:00:46,280 --> 00:00:49,310
As usual, I haven't
found the right timing.

17
00:00:49,310 --> 00:00:50,544
We've made first trail

18
00:00:50,544 --> 00:00:54,200
so I'm just playing the animation lot

19
00:00:54,200 --> 00:00:58,620
moving the key frame until I
feel like I have a good rhythm.

20
00:00:58,620 --> 00:01:01,370
As soon as I was happy
with this base rhythm

21
00:01:01,370 --> 00:01:04,340
I started working on the body controller

22
00:01:04,340 --> 00:01:07,130
as I have done in the previous videos.

23
00:01:07,130 --> 00:01:11,460
As usual I'm trying to get
a nice arc working first

24
00:01:11,460 --> 00:01:13,180
with the location curve.

25
00:01:13,180 --> 00:01:16,330
Since our character is moving on the side,

26
00:01:16,330 --> 00:01:18,970
the X location and Z location curve

27
00:01:18,970 --> 00:01:21,170
are the most influential.

28
00:01:21,170 --> 00:01:23,430
To make the character a bit more lively,

29
00:01:23,430 --> 00:01:26,563
I will input the slight
overshoot on frame 82.

30
00:01:28,110 --> 00:01:31,290
Since the motion is driven by the fear

31
00:01:31,290 --> 00:01:34,250
and awareness of our character,

32
00:01:34,250 --> 00:01:36,680
the head is leading the animation

33
00:01:36,680 --> 00:01:38,890
because he has heard something.

34
00:01:38,890 --> 00:01:40,490
So as we have seen before

35
00:01:40,490 --> 00:01:44,660
it's even the heels of that
are leading the animation.

36
00:01:44,660 --> 00:01:48,270
This is why I take a
particular care to have

37
00:01:48,270 --> 00:01:51,810
a nice head rotation and the head pointing

38
00:01:51,810 --> 00:01:53,650
toward the next point.

39
00:01:53,650 --> 00:01:56,730
So as usual, I'm tracking
the nose of the character.

40
00:01:56,730 --> 00:01:58,870
So it might not be the best move

41
00:01:58,870 --> 00:02:02,010
to start polishing the
head before the chest.

42
00:02:02,010 --> 00:02:06,710
But in this case, the chest
motion is not that important

43
00:02:06,710 --> 00:02:10,000
meaning that there is
not that much influence.

44
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,270
And most of the emotion comes from

45
00:02:12,270 --> 00:02:16,020
the main body controller
I have already polished

46
00:02:16,020 --> 00:02:18,400
and the head rotation controller.

47
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:21,880
And as usual once I'm happy
with the head rotation

48
00:02:21,880 --> 00:02:23,560
and I'm polishing the chest

49
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:26,310
I can get back onto the head rotation

50
00:02:26,310 --> 00:02:29,960
to fix any bumps on the arcs of the head.

51
00:02:29,960 --> 00:02:33,230
And here we can see all
the nose motion path

52
00:02:33,230 --> 00:02:35,120
draw a nice arc.

53
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:38,000
And as I move on polishing the chest

54
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:41,320
I'm calculating the
motion path of the head.

55
00:02:41,320 --> 00:02:44,800
In the previous video, I was
using the neck controller.

56
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:47,080
You can use weather the head or the neck.

57
00:02:47,080 --> 00:02:48,320
That's not the problem.

58
00:02:48,320 --> 00:02:52,910
And since I've already polished
the main body controller

59
00:02:52,910 --> 00:02:54,610
you can see that the arc

60
00:02:54,610 --> 00:02:58,060
of the root of the head
is pretty clean already.

61
00:02:58,060 --> 00:03:02,070
So I'm just very slightly
refining the rotation,

62
00:03:02,070 --> 00:03:05,393
the twisting of the chest
to make it drag a bit.

63
00:03:06,750 --> 00:03:09,970
There is a second step in
this head turn animation

64
00:03:09,970 --> 00:03:14,000
where our character is
looking backward even more

65
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,570
because he has probably
heard another noise.

66
00:03:16,570 --> 00:03:19,330
So to input a bit of this fear

67
00:03:19,330 --> 00:03:21,970
I pushed down the Z location curve

68
00:03:21,970 --> 00:03:26,650
to create a micro anticipation
toward the next turn.

69
00:03:26,650 --> 00:03:29,050
So as usual for the second step,

70
00:03:29,050 --> 00:03:31,690
I'm working first on the chest controller

71
00:03:31,690 --> 00:03:33,790
or working on the location curves

72
00:03:33,790 --> 00:03:35,890
and then the bit on the rotation curve

73
00:03:35,890 --> 00:03:38,030
and then I will go ahead

74
00:03:38,030 --> 00:03:41,240
with the chest and head rotation.

75
00:03:41,240 --> 00:03:43,820
As I've made this micro anticipation

76
00:03:43,820 --> 00:03:45,880
to emphasize this new movement

77
00:03:45,880 --> 00:03:47,840
and as it is very fast,

78
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:51,640
I'm creating a slight bump on frame 93

79
00:03:51,640 --> 00:03:54,160
to create a nice overshoot.

80
00:03:54,160 --> 00:03:56,510
Those little bounces on the curve

81
00:03:56,510 --> 00:03:58,460
tend to bring a bit of texture

82
00:03:58,460 --> 00:04:01,743
into the animation and make
our character less robotic.

83
00:04:03,190 --> 00:04:07,750
Later on, I've worked on
the head location curve

84
00:04:07,750 --> 00:04:11,430
to slightly extend the
neck of the character.

85
00:04:11,430 --> 00:04:13,580
So I (mumbles) the head up.

86
00:04:13,580 --> 00:04:16,380
It's really changed the
silhouette of the character

87
00:04:16,380 --> 00:04:19,000
and we can better even read the tension,

88
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,420
the fear, the alert of the character.

89
00:04:21,420 --> 00:04:23,750
I've also added a slight bump

90
00:04:23,750 --> 00:04:26,300
on the Z curve on frame 93,

91
00:04:26,300 --> 00:04:28,443
creating a subtle head bounce.

92
00:04:29,470 --> 00:04:31,420
Working on the feet was very close

93
00:04:31,420 --> 00:04:33,530
to what we have already seen before.

94
00:04:33,530 --> 00:04:36,440
Since those are very short steps,

95
00:04:36,440 --> 00:04:40,760
X and Y location curve are almost linear

96
00:04:40,760 --> 00:04:43,330
or there is a very short easing

97
00:04:43,330 --> 00:04:45,620
in the beginning of the motion,

98
00:04:45,620 --> 00:04:49,690
making the foot accelerating
toward the next position.

99
00:04:49,690 --> 00:04:51,650
While making the next step

100
00:04:51,650 --> 00:04:54,880
make sure that you don't
trace the foot that much

101
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:59,880
because every motion uses
energy and we are all lazy.

102
00:05:00,270 --> 00:05:02,890
So it's the same for this character.

103
00:05:02,890 --> 00:05:05,490
We need to make those steps very subtle

104
00:05:05,490 --> 00:05:10,010
and then we can make the
foot drag through rotation.

105
00:05:10,010 --> 00:05:13,800
So it's exactly as in the previous videos

106
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:17,030
we raise the foot as less as possible.

107
00:05:17,030 --> 00:05:19,620
We set the end-all to vector whenever

108
00:05:19,620 --> 00:05:22,060
the foot is taking off

109
00:05:22,060 --> 00:05:24,360
and contacting with the ground,

110
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:27,640
because in those case the
foot should be accelerating

111
00:05:27,640 --> 00:05:29,460
before contacting the ground.

112
00:05:29,460 --> 00:05:33,030
We then use the rotation
of the foot to create

113
00:05:33,030 --> 00:05:35,570
a nice dragging motion.

114
00:05:35,570 --> 00:05:38,070
And as the foot is contacting the ground

115
00:05:38,070 --> 00:05:41,690
I keep it rotated on frame 80 for example

116
00:05:41,690 --> 00:05:46,690
and then it gets flat one
frame later on frame 81

117
00:05:46,860 --> 00:05:51,023
so that we get this nice slapping
of the foot on the ground.

118
00:05:52,360 --> 00:05:55,150
As I was happy with the back leg motion,

119
00:05:55,150 --> 00:05:58,100
I then focus on the pole controllers

120
00:05:58,100 --> 00:06:01,430
that will allow us to change
the orientation of the knee

121
00:06:01,430 --> 00:06:03,830
and the ankle of the back feet.

122
00:06:03,830 --> 00:06:07,350
The idea here is just
to input a bit of delay

123
00:06:07,350 --> 00:06:10,690
in the knee motion so that
we have a bit of dragging.

124
00:06:10,690 --> 00:06:13,570
The knees pointing toward the next point.

125
00:06:13,570 --> 00:06:17,580
And then it settles just
after the contacting frame

126
00:06:17,580 --> 00:06:21,290
so that we will have a
little shaking in the legs

127
00:06:21,290 --> 00:06:23,020
that will look more natural.

128
00:06:23,020 --> 00:06:25,810
I did the same with the left back leg

129
00:06:25,810 --> 00:06:28,470
but with away most subtle motion

130
00:06:28,470 --> 00:06:31,370
since the foot doesn't move that much.

131
00:06:31,370 --> 00:06:34,550
I haven't polished those
pole target controller

132
00:06:34,550 --> 00:06:36,630
that much on this animation

133
00:06:36,630 --> 00:06:38,855
and the gain it's a matter of time.

134
00:06:38,855 --> 00:06:40,589
If you want to spend time

135
00:06:40,589 --> 00:06:44,534
to add those subtle
detail to your animation,

136
00:06:44,534 --> 00:06:46,280
it will sure look better.

137
00:06:46,280 --> 00:06:49,020
As any craft the more time you will input

138
00:06:49,020 --> 00:06:52,577
into your animation the
better it should look.

139
00:06:52,577 --> 00:06:56,160
For the front leg, it's
the same story as usual

140
00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:59,490
try to make good ox, avoid twinning.

141
00:06:59,490 --> 00:07:01,720
So we have offset the footstep

142
00:07:01,720 --> 00:07:05,450
in the beginning of the
video in putting one frame

143
00:07:05,450 --> 00:07:07,166
between the contact in the pose

144
00:07:07,166 --> 00:07:10,860
of the right front leg
and the left front leg.

145
00:07:10,860 --> 00:07:14,820
And then I use rotation
to input some dragging

146
00:07:14,820 --> 00:07:17,050
into the motion of the feet.

147
00:07:17,050 --> 00:07:21,110
Then I've tried reworking
the main body controller

148
00:07:21,110 --> 00:07:23,310
and the chest rotation

149
00:07:23,310 --> 00:07:27,650
to avoid the front right
leg to be over extended.

150
00:07:27,650 --> 00:07:30,540
It makes the character looking unbalanced

151
00:07:30,540 --> 00:07:32,140
which I don't like,

152
00:07:32,140 --> 00:07:35,980
but after a few trial, I've
decided to add a new step

153
00:07:35,980 --> 00:07:37,270
to the front right leg.

154
00:07:37,270 --> 00:07:42,080
So that's perfectly fine to
add new poses to your cat

155
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:43,740
while you are polishing.

156
00:07:43,740 --> 00:07:48,220
I've created these new
foot pose on frame 95

157
00:07:48,220 --> 00:07:52,760
and I've duplicated the
curve until frame 99.

158
00:07:52,760 --> 00:07:55,060
Then I'm scrubbing through the animation

159
00:07:55,060 --> 00:07:58,540
to check the timing and
spacing of this new step.

160
00:07:58,540 --> 00:08:00,760
And from there I will polish it

161
00:08:00,760 --> 00:08:04,950
as we usually do working
first on the location curve

162
00:08:04,950 --> 00:08:07,000
and then on the rotation curve.

163
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:10,390
Those little additional
footstep are very relevant

164
00:08:10,390 --> 00:08:13,250
for this kind of small mammals.

165
00:08:13,250 --> 00:08:17,600
It communicate the thrust
and tension of our character

166
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:19,060
hearing some noise,

167
00:08:19,060 --> 00:08:22,540
but also their fast paced metabolism.

168
00:08:22,540 --> 00:08:25,750
If you watch mouse or cat references

169
00:08:25,750 --> 00:08:28,873
you will see that they moved
their feet all the time.

170
00:08:30,130 --> 00:08:32,420
I've policed the heaps last

171
00:08:32,420 --> 00:08:35,230
and I've slightly changed
the pose of the heaps

172
00:08:35,230 --> 00:08:38,210
by raising the back of the character.

173
00:08:38,210 --> 00:08:41,220
I felt like when I raised
a bit of my character

174
00:08:41,220 --> 00:08:44,470
help you looks more aware
and more ready to flee

175
00:08:44,470 --> 00:08:46,690
if any danger is coming

176
00:08:46,690 --> 00:08:48,380
then the second polish stage

177
00:08:48,380 --> 00:08:51,400
is mostly working on those rotation curve.

178
00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:54,890
Make sure that I have smooth rotation

179
00:08:54,890 --> 00:08:58,200
and make sure that the
silhouette of my character

180
00:08:58,200 --> 00:09:01,610
and the shape of your spine looks natural.

181
00:09:01,610 --> 00:09:05,850
As usual, the final stage is
to work on the tail rotation.

182
00:09:05,850 --> 00:09:09,520
So I always start working
with the root of the tail,

183
00:09:09,520 --> 00:09:11,910
working with its rotation axis

184
00:09:11,910 --> 00:09:14,710
and then I go along onto the chain.

185
00:09:14,710 --> 00:09:17,810
As usual, you can study
the full time lapse

186
00:09:17,810 --> 00:09:20,930
of this polishing stage in the next video.

187
00:09:20,930 --> 00:09:23,870
I will see you in the video afterwards,

188
00:09:23,870 --> 00:09:26,510
that is going to be the very last video

189
00:09:26,510 --> 00:09:28,603
of this idle animation.
