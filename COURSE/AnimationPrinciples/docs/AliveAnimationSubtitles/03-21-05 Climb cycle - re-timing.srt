1
00:00:00,750 --> 00:00:01,954
- [Instructor] And you
work on an animation

2
00:00:01,954 --> 00:00:04,820
and get back to it with fresh eyes,

3
00:00:04,820 --> 00:00:07,653
it's pretty common to have
a less satisfying feeling

4
00:00:07,653 --> 00:00:08,894
about what you are seeing.

5
00:00:08,894 --> 00:00:12,871
And I was feeling that the
animation was too fast.

6
00:00:12,871 --> 00:00:16,060
I wanted to show more the
effort made by the character

7
00:00:16,060 --> 00:00:17,350
to climb the tree.

8
00:00:17,350 --> 00:00:18,266
Bring more contrast,

9
00:00:18,266 --> 00:00:21,253
I need to make the
cycle a bit less linear,

10
00:00:21,253 --> 00:00:24,940
and add some Hold on one pose.

11
00:00:24,940 --> 00:00:27,726
And I wanted to add one frame
into the elbow and pose.

12
00:00:27,726 --> 00:00:30,501
Why I got back to the action in it all,

13
00:00:30,501 --> 00:00:34,200
I can select the frame of five to nine

14
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:36,350
and offset them by one frame.

15
00:00:36,350 --> 00:00:38,930
Then it instantly feels better,

16
00:00:38,930 --> 00:00:40,934
because we have this
moment where the character

17
00:00:40,934 --> 00:00:43,907
is clearly squashing together energy

18
00:00:43,907 --> 00:00:46,680
and then is holding a beat in the air

19
00:00:46,680 --> 00:00:47,884
with its stretched pose.

20
00:00:47,884 --> 00:00:51,840
And this little contrast in the timing

21
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:55,490
and the shape of the character
make it feels better.

22
00:00:55,490 --> 00:00:58,221
And since our animation was very detailed,

23
00:00:58,221 --> 00:01:02,306
meaning that we almost have
a key frame on each frame,

24
00:01:02,306 --> 00:01:05,755
the offset looks almost okay.

25
00:01:05,755 --> 00:01:09,922
So the first step is to
revise in sliding issue

26
00:01:09,922 --> 00:01:13,190
since we have increased
the animation by one frame,

27
00:01:13,190 --> 00:01:18,190
and we still have a linear
interpolation of the bone.

28
00:01:19,610 --> 00:01:23,300
To fix the speed at which
the feet of our character

29
00:01:23,300 --> 00:01:24,507
are sliding on the tree trunk,

30
00:01:24,507 --> 00:01:29,314
we just need to slightly adjust
the value of the Y location

31
00:01:29,314 --> 00:01:31,521
of each feet of the character

32
00:01:31,521 --> 00:01:34,170
using the same method as before,

33
00:01:34,170 --> 00:01:35,456
just make sure that the first key frame

34
00:01:35,456 --> 00:01:38,740
and the last key frame are the same.

35
00:01:38,740 --> 00:01:41,980
And you can use the 3D cursor as a marker

36
00:01:41,980 --> 00:01:45,050
to know where the foot
is during the motion.

37
00:01:45,050 --> 00:01:45,883
Most of the work

38
00:01:45,883 --> 00:01:48,293
is just about going
through every controller

39
00:01:48,293 --> 00:01:49,936
you have already polished

40
00:01:49,936 --> 00:01:52,772
and kind of slightly fixed the curve.

41
00:01:52,772 --> 00:01:55,048
Honestly, that's very fast.

42
00:01:55,048 --> 00:01:57,116
It took me like 20 minutes
to fix the whole character,

43
00:01:57,116 --> 00:02:00,980
because the pose we have chosen

44
00:02:00,980 --> 00:02:04,010
to be extended a bit in time

45
00:02:04,010 --> 00:02:06,450
is kind of a hold in the air

46
00:02:06,450 --> 00:02:09,030
where the motion of the character,

47
00:02:09,030 --> 00:02:12,980
the pose of the character
doesn't change that much.

48
00:02:12,980 --> 00:02:15,900
So I'm slightly rotating the curve

49
00:02:15,900 --> 00:02:19,140
and the angles just to get a nice

50
00:02:19,140 --> 00:02:20,860
and smooth curve.

51
00:02:20,860 --> 00:02:21,693
In the end,

52
00:02:21,693 --> 00:02:24,980
adding this little frame really helps

53
00:02:24,980 --> 00:02:28,737
also polishing the foot and
getting a better motion path.

54
00:02:28,737 --> 00:02:32,160
The previous version of
the animation was good,

55
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:35,130
but this time adding this little detail,

56
00:02:35,130 --> 00:02:38,340
this little more range to work on

57
00:02:38,340 --> 00:02:42,450
really helped smoothing
out the whole animation

58
00:02:42,450 --> 00:02:47,430
and contrasting the strength
put into it by our character.

59
00:02:47,430 --> 00:02:49,050
You can watch the whole process

60
00:02:49,050 --> 00:02:51,253
in the next time lapse video.

61
00:02:51,253 --> 00:02:52,889
I will see you in the video after,

62
00:02:52,889 --> 00:02:56,460
where we will add all the secondary motion

63
00:02:56,460 --> 00:03:00,103
like the ears the nose
and also polish the tail.
