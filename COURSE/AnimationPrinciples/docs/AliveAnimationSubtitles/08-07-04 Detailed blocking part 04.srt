1
00:00:00,760 --> 00:00:02,120
- [Instructor] We are almost done

2
00:00:02,120 --> 00:00:04,400
with our detailed blocking.

3
00:00:04,400 --> 00:00:05,260
At this stage,

4
00:00:05,260 --> 00:00:07,540
I am still searching for big changes

5
00:00:07,540 --> 00:00:09,920
in the character pose momentum.

6
00:00:09,920 --> 00:00:11,320
I check the poses I have

7
00:00:11,320 --> 00:00:13,860
to see if they all communicate

8
00:00:13,860 --> 00:00:17,810
the changes or forces or
momentum in the character body.

9
00:00:17,810 --> 00:00:20,730
After the right cross,
there are two motions -

10
00:00:20,730 --> 00:00:24,110
The one where the character
is pulling his right arm back,

11
00:00:24,110 --> 00:00:27,440
and then where it is
anticipating the hook,

12
00:00:27,440 --> 00:00:29,600
pulling his left arm back.

13
00:00:29,600 --> 00:00:32,020
This is also the moment
where the character

14
00:00:32,020 --> 00:00:34,750
is transferring his
weight onto the left leg.

15
00:00:34,750 --> 00:00:37,390
As he does through those two poses,

16
00:00:37,390 --> 00:00:39,430
the motion is pretty linear.

17
00:00:39,430 --> 00:00:43,120
And every part of the chest
are moving at the same speed.

18
00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:46,890
So the pose I'd like to add
is the entering V8 pose.

19
00:00:46,890 --> 00:00:50,510
Where the chest will
drag compared to the hips

20
00:00:50,510 --> 00:00:52,390
and the arms will drag too.

21
00:00:52,390 --> 00:00:55,080
Toward the lower part of the body twisting

22
00:00:55,080 --> 00:00:56,870
toward the left leg.

23
00:00:56,870 --> 00:00:58,650
The upper part of the
body is dragging a bit

24
00:00:58,650 --> 00:01:00,200
and so does the arms

25
00:01:00,200 --> 00:01:02,323
before diving into the next pose.

26
00:01:06,180 --> 00:01:09,310
So in the end, this is not
a very complicated pose.

27
00:01:09,310 --> 00:01:11,960
We will favorize the next pose

28
00:01:11,960 --> 00:01:14,040
with the root of the character

29
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:18,880
as the weight is shifting pretty
quickly onto the left leg,

30
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:23,610
but then you will rotate the
chest toward the previous pose.

31
00:01:23,610 --> 00:01:26,060
And since the arms are dragging,

32
00:01:26,060 --> 00:01:30,100
you will rotate them even
more toward the previous pose.

33
00:01:30,100 --> 00:01:33,700
The trick is to track
the path of your elbows,

34
00:01:33,700 --> 00:01:37,080
make sure that you twist
the chest a little backward

35
00:01:37,080 --> 00:01:38,360
as it is dragging.

36
00:01:38,360 --> 00:01:41,060
And from there, track the left arm joints

37
00:01:41,060 --> 00:01:43,050
and make sure that they are dragging

38
00:01:43,050 --> 00:01:45,433
into the hook anticipation.

39
00:01:47,100 --> 00:01:51,410
As our character's recovering
from the hook and step back

40
00:01:51,410 --> 00:01:54,150
before the switch kick,
there is no anticipation

41
00:01:54,150 --> 00:01:57,820
between this settle pose
and the start of the jumping

42
00:01:57,820 --> 00:01:59,170
into the switch kick.

43
00:01:59,170 --> 00:02:02,710
Since it's a very fast
transition into the switch kick,

44
00:02:02,710 --> 00:02:05,250
we just need a micro anticipation.

45
00:02:05,250 --> 00:02:08,430
So it will be a down pose that will occur

46
00:02:08,430 --> 00:02:10,550
over a couple of frames only

47
00:02:10,550 --> 00:02:14,144
and that will have a very small amplitude.

48
00:02:14,144 --> 00:02:16,600
It will just create an extra little motion

49
00:02:16,600 --> 00:02:19,770
that will make the jumping to read better.

50
00:02:19,770 --> 00:02:21,480
When you create an anticipation,

51
00:02:21,480 --> 00:02:23,950
it's both for your
character to gather energy,

52
00:02:23,950 --> 00:02:26,150
but also for your audience

53
00:02:26,150 --> 00:02:28,060
to have the time to prepare

54
00:02:28,060 --> 00:02:29,420
for the next move.

55
00:02:29,420 --> 00:02:33,150
This is a pose that will be
relatively easy to create.

56
00:02:33,150 --> 00:02:35,230
We just need to pull back a bit

57
00:02:35,230 --> 00:02:37,830
to center of gravity, lower it,

58
00:02:37,830 --> 00:02:41,330
and also move it a bit
toward the right leg.

59
00:02:41,330 --> 00:02:44,410
And since the center of
gravity is moving down,

60
00:02:44,410 --> 00:02:46,670
we will slightly raise the arms.

61
00:02:46,670 --> 00:02:47,820
Raise the head.

62
00:02:47,820 --> 00:02:49,980
Make every features of the body

63
00:02:49,980 --> 00:02:52,600
that are further away
from the center of gravity

64
00:02:52,600 --> 00:02:53,543
to drag a bit.

65
00:02:58,380 --> 00:03:01,280
The almost last pose
we are going to create

66
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:03,970
is the smear pose during the hook.

67
00:03:03,970 --> 00:03:06,685
As explained during the posing chapter,

68
00:03:06,685 --> 00:03:08,920
this is an exaggeration pose

69
00:03:08,920 --> 00:03:10,920
that will fake the motion blur

70
00:03:10,920 --> 00:03:13,260
whenever we have a very fast motion.

71
00:03:13,260 --> 00:03:14,820
The shape of the arms are here

72
00:03:14,820 --> 00:03:17,700
to support the flow of the hook.

73
00:03:17,700 --> 00:03:19,560
This is why from top view

74
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:21,740
it becomes an elliptic shape

75
00:03:21,740 --> 00:03:23,820
so that it better communicates

76
00:03:23,820 --> 00:03:26,393
the twisting of the body during the hook.

77
00:03:27,230 --> 00:03:29,960
To pose the center of
gravity and the chest,

78
00:03:29,960 --> 00:03:31,850
I'm using the breakdowner

79
00:03:31,850 --> 00:03:34,590
and I am favorizing the next pose.

80
00:03:34,590 --> 00:03:36,350
The Impact Pose.

81
00:03:36,350 --> 00:03:38,240
Because the center of gravity in the chest

82
00:03:38,240 --> 00:03:41,900
are currently leading the
motion compared to the arms.

83
00:03:41,900 --> 00:03:45,030
They are pulling the shoulders
and pulling the arms.

84
00:03:45,030 --> 00:03:48,600
So we need to favorize the
center of gravity in the chest

85
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:50,170
toward the next pose,

86
00:03:50,170 --> 00:03:52,210
while the arms will be dragging.

87
00:03:52,210 --> 00:03:54,670
So the method to create those mills

88
00:03:54,670 --> 00:03:58,307
is to first create a natural pose,

89
00:03:58,307 --> 00:04:01,690
the pose that your character
would have in real life

90
00:04:01,690 --> 00:04:04,470
whenever he is throwing the punch.

91
00:04:04,470 --> 00:04:07,230
And once you have the
right angle for the arm,

92
00:04:07,230 --> 00:04:10,140
you can start pulling
the tweaker controller

93
00:04:10,140 --> 00:04:13,670
to create a nice C
curve toward the target.

94
00:04:13,670 --> 00:04:15,780
The most important
thing when you are doing

95
00:04:15,780 --> 00:04:18,290
this kind of a smear pose

96
00:04:18,290 --> 00:04:20,850
is to make sure that you foresee

97
00:04:20,850 --> 00:04:23,710
the path of the elbow and the wrist,

98
00:04:23,710 --> 00:04:27,100
and you make sure that you
align the arm along this path.

99
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:30,340
So it's very important to
rotate around your character

100
00:04:30,340 --> 00:04:33,530
and jump between the
previous and next pose.

101
00:04:33,530 --> 00:04:35,370
Once you've done the left arm,

102
00:04:35,370 --> 00:04:38,000
work on the right arm and don't forget

103
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:41,760
that why we are creating
an exaggerated pose,

104
00:04:41,760 --> 00:04:44,586
you should still pose the shoulders

105
00:04:44,586 --> 00:04:47,730
to better position the arms

106
00:04:47,730 --> 00:04:51,210
and also keep a believable pose,

107
00:04:51,210 --> 00:04:54,110
a believable flow into your pose.

108
00:04:54,110 --> 00:04:57,600
Finally, don't forget to
check the feet movement.

109
00:04:57,600 --> 00:04:59,970
Whenever you are birding a strong pose

110
00:04:59,970 --> 00:05:01,560
for a part of the body,

111
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:03,580
like the arms in this case,

112
00:05:03,580 --> 00:05:06,550
we often forget to move the head,

113
00:05:06,550 --> 00:05:08,140
move the feet, move the knees,

114
00:05:08,140 --> 00:05:09,470
or move the hips.

115
00:05:09,470 --> 00:05:12,700
So it's important not to over-focus

116
00:05:12,700 --> 00:05:14,966
on one part on the character.

117
00:05:14,966 --> 00:05:18,220
But since the kick is also a
very fast circular movement,

118
00:05:18,220 --> 00:05:21,020
we will create a smear
for this motion too.

119
00:05:21,020 --> 00:05:21,853
As for the hook,

120
00:05:21,853 --> 00:05:23,630
I am first posing the center of gravity,

121
00:05:23,630 --> 00:05:27,470
using the breakdowner, and
then tweaking its position.

122
00:05:27,470 --> 00:05:30,890
The center of gravity and the
hips are leading the motion

123
00:05:30,890 --> 00:05:33,660
and the foot is supposed to drag a lot.

124
00:05:33,660 --> 00:05:36,740
Spacing-wise, when you're
making a striking motion,

125
00:05:36,740 --> 00:05:39,490
you want to ease out of the anticipation.

126
00:05:39,490 --> 00:05:43,150
So have a close spacing in
the beginning of the motion,

127
00:05:43,150 --> 00:05:46,390
and then it accelerates before the impact.

128
00:05:46,390 --> 00:05:48,300
The spacing between the impact

129
00:05:48,300 --> 00:05:51,820
and the previous frame
should be the biggest.

130
00:05:51,820 --> 00:05:55,110
I'm using the same principle
as for the previous pose.

131
00:05:55,110 --> 00:05:57,940
I first bird a believable pose

132
00:05:57,940 --> 00:06:00,050
or realistic pose, let's say.

133
00:06:00,050 --> 00:06:01,230
Be extra careful

134
00:06:01,230 --> 00:06:05,220
with the center of gravity,
hips, and chest position.

135
00:06:05,220 --> 00:06:07,010
While during the first punch,

136
00:06:07,010 --> 00:06:10,180
the momentum of our
character was out of balance

137
00:06:10,180 --> 00:06:12,720
as he was punching forward.

138
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:17,370
In this case, he's spinning
around his right foot.

139
00:06:17,370 --> 00:06:21,840
So your character must feel
balanced during this kick.

140
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:25,590
Plus, the hips and the chest
are leading the motion.

141
00:06:25,590 --> 00:06:27,530
So if you don't get them right,

142
00:06:27,530 --> 00:06:31,920
it will be harder then to get
the arms and the legs right.

143
00:06:31,920 --> 00:06:34,340
Remember that this kind of pose

144
00:06:34,340 --> 00:06:37,520
is made to support the flow of the motion.

145
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:40,200
So try to bird your arc

146
00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:41,910
around the path

147
00:06:41,910 --> 00:06:44,160
that the knee and the ankle

148
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:46,580
or the knee and the foot would take

149
00:06:46,580 --> 00:06:48,080
to get to the target.

150
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:50,240
So make sure you refine your smear frame

151
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:53,340
so that you don't get any
weird angle on the leg.

152
00:06:53,340 --> 00:06:55,750
Try to smooth it as possible

153
00:06:55,750 --> 00:06:58,350
based on the rate possibilities.

154
00:06:58,350 --> 00:07:01,730
Then since this part of
the animation is very fast,

155
00:07:01,730 --> 00:07:05,020
I advise you to bird the previous pose.

156
00:07:05,020 --> 00:07:08,490
The one where the foot is just taking off.

157
00:07:08,490 --> 00:07:11,490
Use the breakdowner and align the foot

158
00:07:11,490 --> 00:07:13,020
with the motion path

159
00:07:13,020 --> 00:07:15,560
or the path you think it will take

160
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:17,350
to get to its target.

161
00:07:17,350 --> 00:07:20,280
During this pose, the feet and the torso

162
00:07:20,280 --> 00:07:23,790
are easing out from the previous pose.

163
00:07:23,790 --> 00:07:27,510
Remember that you should
favorize the previous pose

164
00:07:27,510 --> 00:07:29,940
as the feet is accelerating.

165
00:07:29,940 --> 00:07:33,830
So it starts slow and
then go faster and faster

166
00:07:33,830 --> 00:07:36,760
and travel more and more further away

167
00:07:36,760 --> 00:07:38,830
from its starting point.

168
00:07:38,830 --> 00:07:40,630
With all the poses we have created,

169
00:07:40,630 --> 00:07:44,240
we should have enough
information to go into sparring.

170
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:47,770
But before, we should
fine tweak the timing

171
00:07:47,770 --> 00:07:49,090
of our animation.

172
00:07:49,090 --> 00:07:51,603
So we'll do this in the next video.
