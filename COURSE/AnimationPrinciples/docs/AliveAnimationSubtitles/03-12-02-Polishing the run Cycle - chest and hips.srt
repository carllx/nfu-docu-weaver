1
00:00:01,030 --> 00:00:03,800
- [Instructor] Let's continue
polishing our run cycle,

2
00:00:03,800 --> 00:00:06,890
working on the hips, chest and head.

3
00:00:06,890 --> 00:00:08,280
Before I work on those curve,

4
00:00:08,280 --> 00:00:12,270
I like to be able to see the
cycle repeating over time.

5
00:00:12,270 --> 00:00:14,140
To do so, in the graph editor,

6
00:00:14,140 --> 00:00:18,430
we will display all the curve
using the see all filter.

7
00:00:18,430 --> 00:00:21,610
Then we can press A to
select all the curve

8
00:00:21,610 --> 00:00:23,190
and press Shift + E

9
00:00:23,190 --> 00:00:24,640
and choose Make Cycle.

10
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:26,960
This will add the cycle curve modifier

11
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:31,300
on all our curves and the
animation will repeat infinitely.

12
00:00:31,300 --> 00:00:33,330
This is something we have already done

13
00:00:33,330 --> 00:00:35,510
on our bouncing ball exercise.

14
00:00:35,510 --> 00:00:38,480
Now I don't want to do
so for the root bone.

15
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:41,900
So I will activate the
show selected only filter

16
00:00:41,900 --> 00:00:45,290
so that it only displays
my root bone curves

17
00:00:45,290 --> 00:00:46,490
whenever I select.

18
00:00:46,490 --> 00:00:49,390
I zoom on the curve, pressing the dot key

19
00:00:49,390 --> 00:00:52,610
and then press Shift +
E, linear extrapolation.

20
00:00:52,610 --> 00:00:56,040
This way, I will have a
continuous move forward

21
00:00:56,040 --> 00:00:57,290
off our character

22
00:00:57,290 --> 00:00:59,170
but it doesn't seem to work

23
00:00:59,170 --> 00:01:02,490
and this is because we
have also a cyclic modifier

24
00:01:02,490 --> 00:01:03,590
on those curves.

25
00:01:03,590 --> 00:01:07,710
So we'll press Shift + E again
and clear cyclic modifier.

26
00:01:07,710 --> 00:01:10,600
So now all my curve are cycling

27
00:01:10,600 --> 00:01:12,370
but the root bone curve

28
00:01:12,370 --> 00:01:14,970
that has linear extrapolation

29
00:01:14,970 --> 00:01:19,390
and if I now increase the frame
value of my animation end,

30
00:01:19,390 --> 00:01:21,430
I will see my character bouncing

31
00:01:21,430 --> 00:01:23,240
and bouncing and going forward.

32
00:01:23,240 --> 00:01:24,800
This is just a little trick

33
00:01:24,800 --> 00:01:28,020
that will show us the
animation moving forward

34
00:01:28,020 --> 00:01:29,210
as it should be.

35
00:01:29,210 --> 00:01:31,510
It will just give you a better feeling

36
00:01:31,510 --> 00:01:34,550
whenever you are reviewing your animation.

37
00:01:34,550 --> 00:01:38,500
So let's reset the N key to frame 11

38
00:01:38,500 --> 00:01:41,690
and let's start polishing
the chest control.

39
00:01:41,690 --> 00:01:43,810
As usual, I prefer to start

40
00:01:43,810 --> 00:01:46,243
with the most influential curve.

41
00:01:46,243 --> 00:01:49,230
This is going to be the x rotation curve

42
00:01:49,230 --> 00:01:53,060
that makes our character
learning forward and backward.

43
00:01:53,060 --> 00:01:55,730
So this is something
I've already said before

44
00:01:55,730 --> 00:01:59,310
and that I will repeat a lot
during the course I believe

45
00:01:59,310 --> 00:02:02,270
is that it's better to work first

46
00:02:02,270 --> 00:02:05,470
on the biggest changes in your animation,

47
00:02:05,470 --> 00:02:07,110
so work on the curves

48
00:02:07,110 --> 00:02:10,310
that will influence the most the motion

49
00:02:10,310 --> 00:02:12,730
and then go ahead with the details.

50
00:02:12,730 --> 00:02:15,220
It's like any piece of art.

51
00:02:15,220 --> 00:02:18,140
You always start by
blocking the main shapes

52
00:02:18,140 --> 00:02:20,240
when you are sculpting, for example,

53
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:24,540
and then you go deeper and
deeper into the details.

54
00:02:24,540 --> 00:02:27,230
But if the main shape or main motion

55
00:02:27,230 --> 00:02:30,660
for our animation doesn't work properly,

56
00:02:30,660 --> 00:02:32,460
then the whole animation,

57
00:02:32,460 --> 00:02:35,610
no matter how much detail
you are inputting into it

58
00:02:35,610 --> 00:02:37,780
won't be working properly.

59
00:02:37,780 --> 00:02:39,790
I tried to keep the chest aligned

60
00:02:39,790 --> 00:02:41,902
with the motion of the whole body

61
00:02:41,902 --> 00:02:46,027
but I input a bit of
anticipation or dragging

62
00:02:46,027 --> 00:02:49,640
before the character is landing,

63
00:02:49,640 --> 00:02:54,080
raising a bit the curve will
currently raise a bit the chest

64
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:55,750
just before he lands.

65
00:02:55,750 --> 00:02:59,660
And then when he's diving
into the next jump,

66
00:02:59,660 --> 00:03:01,530
I try to curl the chest

67
00:03:01,530 --> 00:03:03,440
towards the next point.

68
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:04,730
So when he's about to land,

69
00:03:04,730 --> 00:03:09,730
he's leaning backward
to anticipate the impact

70
00:03:10,020 --> 00:03:12,920
and when he's pushing to the next jump,

71
00:03:12,920 --> 00:03:16,990
he's curving his body towards the target,

72
00:03:16,990 --> 00:03:18,660
the point in the air.

73
00:03:18,660 --> 00:03:21,240
The y curve is the twisting curve.

74
00:03:21,240 --> 00:03:22,610
It's super subtle.

75
00:03:22,610 --> 00:03:25,700
As we have seen before,
I have just input a bit

76
00:03:25,700 --> 00:03:27,220
of twisting in the chest

77
00:03:27,220 --> 00:03:30,300
so it depends on the position of the legs,

78
00:03:30,300 --> 00:03:32,520
so I will redisplay the legs.

79
00:03:32,520 --> 00:03:35,280
To be honest, what I will mainly do here

80
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:37,110
is try to match the pose

81
00:03:37,110 --> 00:03:39,680
by twisting a bit toward the leg

82
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:42,060
that is the more forward

83
00:03:42,060 --> 00:03:45,420
and then I clean the curve
to have a smooth transition

84
00:03:45,420 --> 00:03:47,380
between the different keyframes.

85
00:03:47,380 --> 00:03:49,520
What I mean here is that I don't want

86
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:52,739
to have any glitches on this y curve

87
00:03:52,739 --> 00:03:56,090
or on this y rotation motion.

88
00:03:56,090 --> 00:03:59,840
This is why I pulled up
the keyframe number one

89
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:01,900
so that it better blend

90
00:04:01,900 --> 00:04:03,750
with the previous key.

91
00:04:03,750 --> 00:04:06,420
And I do the same with frame number 10

92
00:04:06,420 --> 00:04:08,720
by pulling it down a bit.

93
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:10,790
I will do the same with the z rotation

94
00:04:10,790 --> 00:04:11,860
and once I'm done,

95
00:04:11,860 --> 00:04:14,830
we will work a bit on the location.

96
00:04:14,830 --> 00:04:18,349
So the idea is to use the z and y location

97
00:04:18,349 --> 00:04:21,860
of this controller to
add a bit of squashing

98
00:04:21,860 --> 00:04:23,890
and stretching to the torso.

99
00:04:23,890 --> 00:04:27,923
I will be working on those
location curve at 5:07.

100
00:04:27,923 --> 00:04:30,673
(tranquil music)

101
00:05:08,290 --> 00:05:11,390
As usual, I will start
to polish my animation

102
00:05:11,390 --> 00:05:12,470
from a side view.

103
00:05:12,470 --> 00:05:13,570
The first thing I will do

104
00:05:13,570 --> 00:05:15,610
is to move the curve a bit trend only

105
00:05:15,610 --> 00:05:18,130
to see how my character behaves.

106
00:05:18,130 --> 00:05:21,600
Because the chest controller
is the child of the body

107
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:26,090
and we have see in the
parent-child relationship video

108
00:05:26,090 --> 00:05:30,210
that the child will inherit
the orientation of its parent

109
00:05:30,210 --> 00:05:33,660
and so the y-axis of our character

110
00:05:33,660 --> 00:05:36,210
might not be aligned with world space.

111
00:05:36,210 --> 00:05:38,150
And this is clearly not the case,

112
00:05:38,150 --> 00:05:42,420
but what I've spotted is
that the y-axis allows me

113
00:05:42,420 --> 00:05:45,820
to stretch the character along its spine

114
00:05:45,820 --> 00:05:48,670
and the z curve allows me to shift it

115
00:05:48,670 --> 00:05:50,270
a bit up and down.

116
00:05:50,270 --> 00:05:53,250
So I will be mainly working on the y curve

117
00:05:53,250 --> 00:05:56,770
and the idea is to stretch our character

118
00:05:56,770 --> 00:05:59,890
as much as possible when he's jumping

119
00:05:59,890 --> 00:06:02,420
and squash it as much as possible

120
00:06:02,420 --> 00:06:04,700
when he's impacting the ground,

121
00:06:04,700 --> 00:06:07,020
when he's absorbing his own weight.

122
00:06:07,020 --> 00:06:09,930
Don't be too shy and push those curve.

123
00:06:09,930 --> 00:06:12,640
It doesn't matter if it's a bit too much

124
00:06:12,640 --> 00:06:14,200
but it will look boring

125
00:06:14,200 --> 00:06:15,420
if it's not enough.

126
00:06:15,420 --> 00:06:17,750
With the experience, you will learn

127
00:06:17,750 --> 00:06:20,100
to balance those poses.

128
00:06:20,100 --> 00:06:24,840
And we will have a full
chapter about pushing the pose.

129
00:06:24,840 --> 00:06:26,160
What I do with the z curve

130
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:28,670
is just creating a bit of balance

131
00:06:28,670 --> 00:06:29,890
of my character.

132
00:06:29,890 --> 00:06:34,190
The z location curve support
the x rotation curve.

133
00:06:34,190 --> 00:06:37,470
That makes the character
leaning forward and backward.

134
00:06:37,470 --> 00:06:39,240
I keep this motion subtle

135
00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:42,910
because the character
is light and he's agile.

136
00:06:42,910 --> 00:06:46,330
So there is not that much
inertia in his chest.

137
00:06:46,330 --> 00:06:48,980
If it was a very heavy characters

138
00:06:48,980 --> 00:06:52,870
and pretty sloppy, we
would have a lot of motion

139
00:06:52,870 --> 00:06:53,703
in the chest.

140
00:06:54,990 --> 00:06:57,260
Once I'm happy with my chest motion,

141
00:06:57,260 --> 00:06:59,520
I will start working on the hips.

142
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:03,260
So as before, I will
start with the x rotation.

143
00:07:03,260 --> 00:07:05,790
Again, I want to use squash and stretch.

144
00:07:05,790 --> 00:07:06,900
That's for sure.

145
00:07:06,900 --> 00:07:11,900
But I also want to communicate
the agility of the character.

146
00:07:11,930 --> 00:07:14,150
So on the jumping stage,

147
00:07:14,150 --> 00:07:16,660
I will push the hips up.

148
00:07:16,660 --> 00:07:20,460
The hips are catapulting
the character upward.

149
00:07:20,460 --> 00:07:23,370
Think of a horse kicking backward.

150
00:07:23,370 --> 00:07:26,620
The hips motion is something
really hard to get right,

151
00:07:26,620 --> 00:07:30,140
especially on animals
or humanoid character

152
00:07:30,140 --> 00:07:32,630
and if you have already watched tutorials

153
00:07:32,630 --> 00:07:35,890
about animation, you know
that a lot of animation

154
00:07:35,890 --> 00:07:38,350
is led by the hips.

155
00:07:38,350 --> 00:07:42,630
So it's important to do your
best to make it look right.

156
00:07:42,630 --> 00:07:46,100
And if it doesn't, just
look at some reference

157
00:07:46,100 --> 00:07:48,100
and rework your animation.

158
00:07:48,100 --> 00:07:49,580
Don't be afraid to fail,

159
00:07:49,580 --> 00:07:52,550
don't be afraid to restart your animation.

160
00:07:52,550 --> 00:07:53,880
At the end of the motion,

161
00:07:53,880 --> 00:07:56,640
when the character is about to land,

162
00:07:56,640 --> 00:07:59,820
look how I've bent the hips forward

163
00:07:59,820 --> 00:08:02,890
in an anticipation to the landing contact.

164
00:08:02,890 --> 00:08:04,970
This is something we can clearly see

165
00:08:04,970 --> 00:08:06,270
on our reference

166
00:08:06,270 --> 00:08:09,200
if you follow the curvature of the body.

167
00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:11,290
It's straight during the pushing

168
00:08:11,290 --> 00:08:13,220
and when it's about to land,

169
00:08:13,220 --> 00:08:15,480
before the back legs touch the ground

170
00:08:15,480 --> 00:08:19,530
and since we are creating
a more extreme motion,

171
00:08:19,530 --> 00:08:24,460
we have to make this pose
contrast more extreme too.

172
00:08:24,460 --> 00:08:27,860
This is exactly the kind of
thing you have to look for

173
00:08:27,860 --> 00:08:29,980
when you watch your reference.

174
00:08:29,980 --> 00:08:33,740
We will go deeper into
this later in the course.

175
00:08:33,740 --> 00:08:35,160
As I did for the chest,

176
00:08:35,160 --> 00:08:38,790
I'm working on the twisting
of the hips, the latest,

177
00:08:38,790 --> 00:08:42,260
because it's the most
subtle rotation in the body.

178
00:08:42,260 --> 00:08:46,183
And then I will work on the
location curve of the hips.

179
00:08:46,183 --> 00:08:47,740
It will be very close

180
00:08:47,740 --> 00:08:49,610
to what I have done with the chest,

181
00:08:49,610 --> 00:08:52,090
working with squash and stretch,

182
00:08:52,090 --> 00:08:54,710
stretching the character when it's jumping

183
00:08:54,710 --> 00:08:56,470
and when it's in the air

184
00:08:56,470 --> 00:09:00,150
and squashing it when it's
absorbing the landing.

185
00:09:00,150 --> 00:09:04,370
So I will see you at the
timestamp 11 minute and 12 second

186
00:09:04,370 --> 00:09:05,824
to polish the head.

187
00:09:05,824 --> 00:09:08,574
(tranquil music)

188
00:11:12,903 --> 00:11:15,220
Time to polish the head and guess what?

189
00:11:15,220 --> 00:11:18,000
We will start with the x rotation.

190
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:21,560
Since the head is the
extremity of the torso,

191
00:11:21,560 --> 00:11:24,640
it will have a bit more
overlapping motion,

192
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:26,490
dragging, et cetera

193
00:11:26,490 --> 00:11:31,460
because it's influenced by
the rotation of the body

194
00:11:31,460 --> 00:11:33,550
and the rotation of the chest.

195
00:11:33,550 --> 00:11:37,040
So we have to input a
bit this dragging motion,

196
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:40,590
meaning that when the
body is leaning forward,

197
00:11:40,590 --> 00:11:43,700
the head is leaning a bit upward.

198
00:11:43,700 --> 00:11:45,909
The tip of the nose is dragging

199
00:11:45,909 --> 00:11:49,070
but we can't go crazy with this end motion

200
00:11:49,070 --> 00:11:51,600
as we will do maybe with the tail.

201
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:53,310
When you are in locomotion,

202
00:11:53,310 --> 00:11:55,870
whether it's running or walking,

203
00:11:55,870 --> 00:11:57,810
your head is rotating a bit,

204
00:11:57,810 --> 00:11:59,370
it's dragging a bit

205
00:11:59,370 --> 00:12:02,440
but you're trying to
stabilize its position,

206
00:12:02,440 --> 00:12:06,130
especially its x-axis rotation.

207
00:12:06,130 --> 00:12:08,320
This way, you can stare forward

208
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:10,350
and see where you are going.

209
00:12:10,350 --> 00:12:13,460
So we have to input a bit of dragging

210
00:12:13,460 --> 00:12:17,080
but try to keep also
the head stable enough.

211
00:12:17,080 --> 00:12:18,670
Don't go crazy with it.

212
00:12:18,670 --> 00:12:20,140
When I'm looking at the loop,

213
00:12:20,140 --> 00:12:23,580
I feel there is a little
glitch when my character

214
00:12:23,580 --> 00:12:25,950
is reaching its highest point.

215
00:12:25,950 --> 00:12:28,750
It's pretty subtle and
it might be difficult

216
00:12:28,750 --> 00:12:31,040
to see it in the video

217
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:34,600
but when I'm animating,
I can clearly see it.

218
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:36,440
When you get this kind of issue

219
00:12:36,440 --> 00:12:39,670
but you can't really get what's
wrong with your animation,

220
00:12:39,670 --> 00:12:41,340
use the motion path.

221
00:12:41,340 --> 00:12:44,000
But use it on the point further away

222
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,090
from the rotating joint.

223
00:12:46,090 --> 00:12:49,570
In this case, I will use the
tip of the nose controller.

224
00:12:49,570 --> 00:12:53,930
It should draw a smooth arc as
seen in the previous lessons.

225
00:12:53,930 --> 00:12:55,740
But here, it's not the case.

226
00:12:55,740 --> 00:12:58,110
On frame five, the nose is going down.

227
00:12:58,110 --> 00:13:00,240
Then on frame six, going up.

228
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:02,870
While on frame four, it was going up too.

229
00:13:02,870 --> 00:13:06,750
And it generates some kind
of popping in the animation

230
00:13:06,750 --> 00:13:08,460
that doesn't look right.

231
00:13:08,460 --> 00:13:12,380
So what I'm doing now is
slightly polishing the curve

232
00:13:12,380 --> 00:13:15,930
so that I get a nice arc
of the tip of the nose.

233
00:13:15,930 --> 00:13:19,120
We don't need to create
a perfect elliptic arc

234
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:21,720
but we do need to have a smooth transition

235
00:13:21,720 --> 00:13:23,400
between the different keyframes.

236
00:13:23,400 --> 00:13:25,980
So I'm really refining the curve,

237
00:13:25,980 --> 00:13:28,960
even adding a keyframe on each frame

238
00:13:28,960 --> 00:13:30,760
until I get a nice arc.

239
00:13:30,760 --> 00:13:33,880
I will then work on the
other rotation curve

240
00:13:33,880 --> 00:13:36,360
and finally, on the location curve.

241
00:13:36,360 --> 00:13:39,670
So here what you have to focus on.

242
00:13:39,670 --> 00:13:42,950
The head is the part that
will be moving the most

243
00:13:42,950 --> 00:13:46,351
because it's at the extremity of the body

244
00:13:46,351 --> 00:13:51,351
but we do need to try to keep
it as stable as possible,

245
00:13:52,130 --> 00:13:55,440
making our character staring forward.

246
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:59,230
When you will input a bit
of squash and stretch,

247
00:13:59,230 --> 00:14:03,360
do it with a bit of delay
compared to the chest.

248
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:06,720
If the chest is fully
squashing on frame one,

249
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:11,340
for example, the head will be
fully squashing on frame two.

250
00:14:11,340 --> 00:14:13,710
One frame of delay will be enough.

251
00:14:13,710 --> 00:14:15,640
Do it and keep it subtle

252
00:14:15,640 --> 00:14:19,620
and once you have finished
polishing the location curve,

253
00:14:19,620 --> 00:14:22,170
recalculate the motion path.

254
00:14:22,170 --> 00:14:24,630
And check if the tip of the nose

255
00:14:24,630 --> 00:14:26,820
is making a good arc.

256
00:14:26,820 --> 00:14:28,640
And you will see at the end of the video,

257
00:14:28,640 --> 00:14:30,980
I will recalculate my motion path

258
00:14:30,980 --> 00:14:34,950
and make sure that the nose
is doing this great arc.

259
00:14:34,950 --> 00:14:38,750
And I will get a nice
controlled head movement.

260
00:14:38,750 --> 00:14:41,270
I will leave you there for this video.

261
00:14:41,270 --> 00:14:43,450
At the end of the video is a time lapse

262
00:14:43,450 --> 00:14:46,600
where I'm fixing the head
rotation and the location

263
00:14:46,600 --> 00:14:48,580
as I've just explained.

264
00:14:48,580 --> 00:14:50,120
In the next video,

265
00:14:50,120 --> 00:14:52,200
we will start working on the legs

266
00:14:52,200 --> 00:14:57,200
and it will drastically change
our animation and make it.

267
00:14:57,606 --> 00:15:00,356
(tranquil music)
