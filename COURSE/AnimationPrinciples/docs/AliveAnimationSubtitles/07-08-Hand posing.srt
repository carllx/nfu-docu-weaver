00:00:00,170 --> 00:00:01,003
- [Instructor] In this video,

2
00:00:01,003 --> 00:00:03,830
we are going to talk about
one of my favorite part

3
00:00:03,830 --> 00:00:05,150
on any character.

4
00:00:05,150 --> 00:00:09,050
Hands are super important
and too often overlooked.

5
00:00:09,050 --> 00:00:12,290
And you can often
identify a big inner work

6
00:00:12,290 --> 00:00:14,700
just by watching the hand posing.

7
00:00:14,700 --> 00:00:19,380
The first main issue is to keep
the rest pose of most rigs.

8
00:00:19,380 --> 00:00:21,900
Most of the time for technical purpose,

9
00:00:21,900 --> 00:00:25,000
most character rigs have flat hand

10
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:27,420
whenever they are in rest pose.

11
00:00:27,420 --> 00:00:31,870
And to get such a flat hand
pose, you need tension,

12
00:00:31,870 --> 00:00:35,030
meaning that you need to
straighten your fingers

13
00:00:35,030 --> 00:00:36,650
so that you're not relaxed.

14
00:00:36,650 --> 00:00:39,470
So the first thing I
would suggest you to do

15
00:00:39,470 --> 00:00:41,650
whenever you are posing your character,

16
00:00:41,650 --> 00:00:44,130
but whatever the rig you are using,

17
00:00:44,130 --> 00:00:48,360
is to slightly curve the end
using the palm controller,

18
00:00:48,360 --> 00:00:51,150
and then to slightly bend
the tip of the finger.

19
00:00:51,150 --> 00:00:54,820
Here, you can see a reference
picture of a relaxed hand

20
00:00:54,820 --> 00:00:56,560
and there is no flat shape.

21
00:00:56,560 --> 00:01:00,540
Another thing that is very
interesting is finger grouping.

22
00:01:00,540 --> 00:01:03,710
Most of the time, fingers
tend to group themself

23
00:01:03,710 --> 00:01:05,620
by two or by three.

24
00:01:05,620 --> 00:01:08,200
The current pose is the one I use the most

25
00:01:08,200 --> 00:01:11,800
with the index and the
pinky being separated,

26
00:01:11,800 --> 00:01:15,200
and the middle finger and the
ring finger being grouped.

27
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:17,130
If you watch some of my animation,

28
00:01:17,130 --> 00:01:19,080
you can see that I use it a lot.

29
00:01:19,080 --> 00:01:22,120
Whenever I'm posing hand,
this is my go to shape,

30
00:01:22,120 --> 00:01:25,540
but you can group the middle,
ring, and pinky together

31
00:01:25,540 --> 00:01:27,850
or you can not leave the pinky alone,

32
00:01:27,850 --> 00:01:30,460
but you should avoid creating two groups,

33
00:01:30,460 --> 00:01:33,090
one with the index and the middle finger,

34
00:01:33,090 --> 00:01:35,800
the other with the ring
finger and the pinky.

35
00:01:35,800 --> 00:01:38,160
While it may fit for a ninja turtle,

36
00:01:38,160 --> 00:01:41,193
this is not a very natural hand pose.

37
00:01:42,220 --> 00:01:44,680
Whenever you are building a fist pose,

38
00:01:44,680 --> 00:01:48,070
don't just rotate the root of the fingers,

39
00:01:48,070 --> 00:01:50,100
and then curve them inward.

40
00:01:50,100 --> 00:01:54,510
If you do so, you will end
up with a very squared fist.

41
00:01:54,510 --> 00:01:57,493
We have flat surface on top of the hand

42
00:01:57,493 --> 00:02:00,310
on the front of the
hand, and on the inward.

43
00:02:00,310 --> 00:02:05,310
This will look very low poly
like or old game fashioned.

44
00:02:05,370 --> 00:02:08,330
While if you look to a
closed fist reference,

45
00:02:08,330 --> 00:02:11,440
you can see that there
is a lot of curvaturing.

46
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:13,810
So a good practice whenever
you're posing a fist

47
00:02:13,810 --> 00:02:17,050
is to do the same thing as
when you're posing a rest hand.

48
00:02:17,050 --> 00:02:20,640
First of all, think of
using the palm controller

49
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:23,930
to slightly bend or curve the whole fist.

50
00:02:23,930 --> 00:02:26,379
Then watch your own fist.

51
00:02:26,379 --> 00:02:28,930
Watch the relationship between each finger

52
00:02:28,930 --> 00:02:30,550
and the overall shape.

53
00:02:30,550 --> 00:02:34,080
Don't hesitate to play with
the location of the bone.

54
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:37,000
It's very odd to get a convincing fist

55
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:41,050
with all the compression
by using only the rotation.

56
00:02:41,050 --> 00:02:44,960
Again, remember that we are
currently sculpting the pose,

57
00:02:44,960 --> 00:02:47,380
shaping our character.

58
00:02:47,380 --> 00:02:49,670
This is not about getting logical,

59
00:02:49,670 --> 00:02:52,470
about all the bones should behave

60
00:02:52,470 --> 00:02:54,050
in the body of our character.

61
00:02:54,050 --> 00:02:55,780
We are not manipulating bones,

62
00:02:55,780 --> 00:02:57,810
we are manipulating controllers.

63
00:02:57,810 --> 00:03:01,200
So again, watch reference,
use your own fist,

64
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:02,470
and try to match it.

65
00:03:02,470 --> 00:03:05,890
Here is the result whenever
I'm using my own fist.

66
00:03:05,890 --> 00:03:09,130
Note that the fist
position might vary a lot

67
00:03:09,130 --> 00:03:10,790
from people to people

68
00:03:10,790 --> 00:03:15,053
and that you will meet limitation
due to the current rig.

69
00:03:16,010 --> 00:03:19,300
I personally believe that
hands are so expressive

70
00:03:19,300 --> 00:03:22,990
that they can be considered
as being a separated character

71
00:03:22,990 --> 00:03:24,400
within the character.

72
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:27,970
When you are posing a hand, just act it.

73
00:03:27,970 --> 00:03:30,360
Why we have been focusing on motion,

74
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:33,010
line affection, and
all this kind of thing,

75
00:03:33,010 --> 00:03:35,750
this course is about animation.

76
00:03:35,750 --> 00:03:38,350
So bringing your character to life.

77
00:03:38,350 --> 00:03:42,170
And I do believe that
even in an action pose

78
00:03:42,170 --> 00:03:44,530
or an action animation,

79
00:03:44,530 --> 00:03:48,320
hands can communicate a
lot about your character,

80
00:03:48,320 --> 00:03:50,430
about his personality.

81
00:03:50,430 --> 00:03:53,190
So whenever you are walking on hands,

82
00:03:53,190 --> 00:03:56,600
treat yourself as a
child and play with them.

83
00:03:56,600 --> 00:03:58,670
Just remember whatever you were doing

84
00:03:58,670 --> 00:04:02,350
whenever you were mimicking a
monster when you were a child.

85
00:04:02,350 --> 00:04:06,130
Hand poses are written
into our subconscious

86
00:04:06,130 --> 00:04:10,080
because it's a strong point
of attraction on a character.

87
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:12,750
They can be very feminine for example

88
00:04:12,750 --> 00:04:16,760
or they can show anger or the
envy of an evil character.

89
00:04:16,760 --> 00:04:21,100
So whatever the tension, the
shape you build with the hands,

90
00:04:21,100 --> 00:04:22,940
they will communicate something.

91
00:04:22,940 --> 00:04:25,820
Finally, whenever you
are posing your hand,

92
00:04:25,820 --> 00:04:28,130
you have to think about the limitation.

93
00:04:28,130 --> 00:04:29,930
While we can break those boundaries

94
00:04:29,930 --> 00:04:32,570
whenever we are playing with exaggeration,

95
00:04:32,570 --> 00:04:35,640
it's always better to build your poses

96
00:04:35,640 --> 00:04:37,910
on the current limitation of the body.

97
00:04:37,910 --> 00:04:40,890
Remember that the side to
side motion of the wrist

98
00:04:40,890 --> 00:04:44,510
is pretty limited, just a
few degrees of rotation.

99
00:04:44,510 --> 00:04:47,770
Again, use your own hand to test it.

100
00:04:47,770 --> 00:04:50,490
If you hold your arms straight forward,

101
00:04:50,490 --> 00:04:54,940
you can almost twist
your hand by 180 degrees

102
00:04:54,940 --> 00:04:57,070
with your palm pointing to the sky.

103
00:04:57,070 --> 00:04:59,670
While if you twist your hand inward,

104
00:04:59,670 --> 00:05:02,710
you will hardly get over 90 degrees.

105
00:05:02,710 --> 00:05:05,820
Regarding the back and
forth tilting of the hand,

106
00:05:05,820 --> 00:05:08,860
you should be able to
reach a 90 degrees angle

107
00:05:08,860 --> 00:05:12,620
whether you are bending
your hand inward or outward.

108
00:05:12,620 --> 00:05:15,953
So whenever you are building
those pose, try them yourself.

109
00:05:15,953 --> 00:05:18,270
If it's become painful,

110
00:05:18,270 --> 00:05:19,660
then you have to compensate

111
00:05:19,660 --> 00:05:21,840
whether with the shoulder or the elbow.

112
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:24,530
Fingers also have their limitation.

113
00:05:24,530 --> 00:05:26,860
While the thumb is pretty flexible,

114
00:05:26,860 --> 00:05:28,420
you will reach a limitation

115
00:05:28,420 --> 00:05:31,980
whenever you're trying to
spread it as far as possible

116
00:05:31,980 --> 00:05:35,670
til it creates an L shape
with the index finger.

117
00:05:35,670 --> 00:05:38,750
The index and the pinky
can process free rotation

118
00:05:38,750 --> 00:05:40,890
with a lot of limitation.

119
00:05:40,890 --> 00:05:43,050
So you can rotate a bit with them

120
00:05:43,050 --> 00:05:45,040
to create a circular shape,

121
00:05:45,040 --> 00:05:47,690
but they are mainly able to curl.

122
00:05:47,690 --> 00:05:51,560
The middle finger and the
ring finger are more limited.

123
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:54,730
Finally, when it comes to the
next joint on your finger,

124
00:05:54,730 --> 00:05:58,940
they can only curve and rotating
them along any other access

125
00:05:58,940 --> 00:06:00,150
will look very weird.

126
00:06:00,150 --> 00:06:03,170
Again, it doesn't mean you
can't rotate them this way.

127
00:06:03,170 --> 00:06:06,510
And I do it a lot whenever
I'm building smears,

128
00:06:06,510 --> 00:06:08,930
but if you hold a pose this way,

129
00:06:08,930 --> 00:06:10,960
the finger will look broken.

130
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:12,810
Finally, depending on the people,

131
00:06:12,810 --> 00:06:15,150
the finger might be more or less flexible

132
00:06:15,150 --> 00:06:18,380
and you can totally bend
them backward a bit,

133
00:06:18,380 --> 00:06:21,100
especially if they are
applying any pressure.

134
00:06:21,100 --> 00:06:23,540
This will mark the end of this video,

135
00:06:23,540 --> 00:06:26,100
but I do advise you to have a look

136
00:06:26,100 --> 00:06:29,950
to the talk of Hjalti Hjalmarsson
at the Blender Conference.

137
00:06:29,950 --> 00:06:34,510
It's one of the best talk about
hand posing I've ever seen

138
00:06:34,510 --> 00:06:36,540
and it's really eye opening.

139
00:06:36,540 --> 00:06:40,023
You will find the link in
the documentation as usual.
