1
00:00:00,880 --> 00:00:01,713
- In this video,

2
00:00:01,713 --> 00:00:05,370
we will have a quick overview
of the different sequences

3
00:00:05,370 --> 00:00:07,770
and how to render and edit them

4
00:00:07,770 --> 00:00:09,730
in the Video Sequence editor.

5
00:00:09,730 --> 00:00:14,340
The second scene or second
shot of our short animation

6
00:00:14,340 --> 00:00:16,010
is super simple.

7
00:00:16,010 --> 00:00:19,500
The camera is simply
moving in a linear fashion,

8
00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:23,590
using linear interpolation on the x-axis

9
00:00:23,590 --> 00:00:25,560
following our character

10
00:00:25,560 --> 00:00:28,360
until it disappear into a bush.

11
00:00:28,360 --> 00:00:31,050
The character itself is simply

12
00:00:31,050 --> 00:00:34,970
using it's run cycle
animation that is looping.

13
00:00:34,970 --> 00:00:38,780
And on top of this I have
layered simple locomotion action

14
00:00:38,780 --> 00:00:43,780
in the NLA editor that move
by 0.7 meters every 12 frames.

15
00:00:45,940 --> 00:00:48,560
And then choose an extrapolation filter

16
00:00:48,560 --> 00:00:51,487
set to linear extrapolation.

17
00:00:51,487 --> 00:00:53,091
(wind woosh effect)

18
00:00:53,091 --> 00:00:54,360
For the next shot,

19
00:00:54,360 --> 00:00:57,730
when our character
start climbing the tree,

20
00:00:57,730 --> 00:01:01,110
the root of the camera is
still moving left to right,

21
00:01:01,110 --> 00:01:05,430
but this time I have a bit of
easing in the camera motion,

22
00:01:05,430 --> 00:01:07,590
and then the camera stop.

23
00:01:07,590 --> 00:01:08,550
In the meantime,

24
00:01:08,550 --> 00:01:10,520
I'm using the Aim controller

25
00:01:10,520 --> 00:01:13,640
to create down to up motion.

26
00:01:13,640 --> 00:01:16,720
Particularly the camera
is following the squirrel

27
00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:19,923
and there is a slight easing
until the end of the shot

28
00:01:19,923 --> 00:01:22,620
that the camera looks a little more alive.

29
00:01:22,620 --> 00:01:25,440
Also the character is not full frame.

30
00:01:25,440 --> 00:01:28,200
He appear on a third of the camera

31
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:31,340
and is facing the closed side of the shot

32
00:01:31,340 --> 00:01:34,343
so that we do feel like he's escaping.

33
00:01:35,470 --> 00:01:38,780
For the character motion it's as usual.

34
00:01:38,780 --> 00:01:40,710
I've combined this time,

35
00:01:40,710 --> 00:01:44,560
the climbing cycle with locomotion action

36
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:46,670
using the NLA editor.

37
00:01:46,670 --> 00:01:48,700
For the locomotion animation

38
00:01:48,700 --> 00:01:52,610
I've only animated the
root bone of the character.

39
00:01:52,610 --> 00:01:55,620
Since his motion is not
as linear as before,

40
00:01:55,620 --> 00:01:59,750
meaning that it's likely
changing direction on each bounce

41
00:01:59,750 --> 00:02:02,540
but still as a constant speed,

42
00:02:02,540 --> 00:02:05,880
I've made sure that I
add linear interpolation

43
00:02:05,880 --> 00:02:10,070
between each frame switching
every handle to vector.

44
00:02:10,070 --> 00:02:13,340
And then on each contact
pose of the character

45
00:02:13,340 --> 00:02:16,640
I will slightly change its orientation

46
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:19,260
and moving following the tree trunk.

47
00:02:19,260 --> 00:02:21,130
You can see that from a side view

48
00:02:21,130 --> 00:02:22,770
it might not look perfect,

49
00:02:22,770 --> 00:02:25,980
but it does work very well
from the camera angle.

50
00:02:25,980 --> 00:02:27,285
So that's perfectly fine.

51
00:02:27,285 --> 00:02:28,118
(wind woosh effect)

52
00:02:28,118 --> 00:02:31,310
On the next shot there is no camera motion

53
00:02:31,310 --> 00:02:34,250
so it's just about placing the camera.

54
00:02:34,250 --> 00:02:36,580
Again, our character is framed

55
00:02:36,580 --> 00:02:39,920
so that it follows a
third of the camera view.

56
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:42,880
I am still using the
climbing cycle animation

57
00:02:42,880 --> 00:02:44,170
we have created,

58
00:02:44,170 --> 00:02:47,540
but this time you can see
there is no locomotion action.

59
00:02:47,540 --> 00:02:50,950
Instead, I'm using a path constraint

60
00:02:50,950 --> 00:02:53,610
on the root bone of our character.

61
00:02:53,610 --> 00:02:57,620
We will see how to create it
and use it in the next video.

62
00:02:57,620 --> 00:03:02,010
But particularly our character
is simply following a curve

63
00:03:02,010 --> 00:03:05,420
and we can animate the
speed at which the character

64
00:03:05,420 --> 00:03:06,870
is following this curve.

65
00:03:06,870 --> 00:03:10,070
While we should use a linear speed

66
00:03:10,070 --> 00:03:12,950
I slightly edited the
speed of the character

67
00:03:12,950 --> 00:03:14,620
using the Graph editor,

68
00:03:14,620 --> 00:03:17,160
inputting a bit of variation.

69
00:03:17,160 --> 00:03:19,390
so that it looks a little more dynamic

70
00:03:19,390 --> 00:03:20,930
from the camera angle.

71
00:03:20,930 --> 00:03:21,763
And that was it.

72
00:03:21,763 --> 00:03:22,596
(wind woosh effect)

73
00:03:22,596 --> 00:03:26,410
For the very last sequence
of our character animation

74
00:03:26,410 --> 00:03:29,235
the camera doesn't move
until our character

75
00:03:29,235 --> 00:03:30,740
settle in the shot.

76
00:03:30,740 --> 00:03:32,440
Then the root of the camera

77
00:03:32,440 --> 00:03:35,210
is slightly moving up and forward

78
00:03:35,210 --> 00:03:40,080
and I've animated the focal
length and the focus distance

79
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:44,340
so that we are progressively
focusing onto the horizon.

80
00:03:44,340 --> 00:03:46,160
For the character animation.

81
00:03:46,160 --> 00:03:49,060
I've used one cycle of the run cycle

82
00:03:49,060 --> 00:03:51,380
combined with the locomotion,

83
00:03:51,380 --> 00:03:56,380
which is a simple forward
animation on 0.7 meter.

84
00:03:56,590 --> 00:04:00,320
And then I've used our idle animation.

85
00:04:00,320 --> 00:04:04,860
And I've cut the idle
animation on frame 68.

86
00:04:04,860 --> 00:04:09,860
What I did do on the very
final version of the trailer

87
00:04:09,930 --> 00:04:14,930
was to add a couple of additional
animation on the very end

88
00:04:14,940 --> 00:04:17,010
so that the character is still moving

89
00:04:17,010 --> 00:04:20,050
while it's getting out of focus.

90
00:04:20,050 --> 00:04:22,670
I haven't recorded the
the animation process

91
00:04:22,670 --> 00:04:25,080
because that will be redundant.

92
00:04:25,080 --> 00:04:28,940
And you will still have a lot
of animation content to watch

93
00:04:28,940 --> 00:04:30,120
in this course.

94
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:32,470
But the process was exactly the same

95
00:04:32,470 --> 00:04:35,600
as when we have made our idle animation.

96
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:39,343
So it's also time for you
to try to do it on your own.

97
00:04:40,260 --> 00:04:42,220
(wind woosh effect)

98
00:04:42,220 --> 00:04:44,490
As you are done with animation

99
00:04:44,490 --> 00:04:46,770
we need to render those shots.

100
00:04:46,770 --> 00:04:49,010
If you are using the provided file,

101
00:04:49,010 --> 00:04:51,230
I've already set up the render.

102
00:04:51,230 --> 00:04:53,310
You just need to go to Render

103
00:04:53,310 --> 00:04:55,370
and click Render animation

104
00:04:55,370 --> 00:04:58,020
or press Control + F12.

105
00:04:58,020 --> 00:05:01,523
As you do, Blender will
render the animation scene

106
00:05:01,523 --> 00:05:03,110
with the camera view.

107
00:05:03,110 --> 00:05:06,370
It will start from the start
frame till the end frame

108
00:05:06,370 --> 00:05:10,530
and using the resolution
set into the dimensions.

109
00:05:10,530 --> 00:05:12,430
We don't care about frame rate,

110
00:05:12,430 --> 00:05:16,610
unless we are exporting a
movie like an MPEG sequence.

111
00:05:16,610 --> 00:05:20,560
But I do advise you to render PNG files.

112
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:22,310
If you run in movie file,

113
00:05:22,310 --> 00:05:25,230
there is big chances
it will be compressed.

114
00:05:25,230 --> 00:05:28,440
Plus, if Blender crashes before
the end of the rendering,

115
00:05:28,440 --> 00:05:31,390
you will have to re-render
the whole sequence.

116
00:05:31,390 --> 00:05:33,870
While if you are using image sequence,

117
00:05:33,870 --> 00:05:35,710
you will just have to re-render

118
00:05:35,710 --> 00:05:37,710
from the frame it has crashed.

119
00:05:37,710 --> 00:05:40,230
I've set up my render
output so that Blender

120
00:05:40,230 --> 00:05:42,300
will create the folder, "RENDERS",

121
00:05:42,300 --> 00:05:46,620
and the subfolder,
"SCENE-05", 4, 3, 2 or 1.

122
00:05:46,620 --> 00:05:50,430
And the image sequence
will be called, "Scene-05",

123
00:05:50,430 --> 00:05:51,263
in this case.

124
00:05:51,263 --> 00:05:54,760
And Blender will automatically
add a suffix number

125
00:05:54,760 --> 00:05:57,211
corresponding to the frame number.

126
00:05:57,211 --> 00:05:58,044
(wind woosh effect)

127
00:05:58,044 --> 00:06:02,620
Since I generally use After
Effects to create my sequences

128
00:06:02,620 --> 00:06:04,500
and work on my compositing,

129
00:06:04,500 --> 00:06:06,750
I won't do an in-depth video

130
00:06:06,750 --> 00:06:09,760
about the Video Sequence
editor in Blender,

131
00:06:09,760 --> 00:06:11,540
but they will give you the foundation

132
00:06:11,540 --> 00:06:14,380
that will allow you to
use it without problem.

133
00:06:14,380 --> 00:06:17,870
So let's convert both
our 3D view and timeline

134
00:06:17,870 --> 00:06:20,590
to the Video Sequence editor.

135
00:06:20,590 --> 00:06:22,060
It's pretty straightforward.

136
00:06:22,060 --> 00:06:25,250
We have different tracks
and pressing Shift + A

137
00:06:25,250 --> 00:06:27,530
I can add different items.

138
00:06:27,530 --> 00:06:30,320
It can be text, sound, whatever.

139
00:06:30,320 --> 00:06:32,700
Let's choose image sequence,

140
00:06:32,700 --> 00:06:34,800
browse our render folder,

141
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:35,633
and press A

142
00:06:35,633 --> 00:06:39,770
to select all the PNG file
of the first sequence.

143
00:06:39,770 --> 00:06:42,333
And press, Add image sequence.

144
00:06:43,480 --> 00:06:47,230
Blender has automatically
added all our image

145
00:06:47,230 --> 00:06:50,090
as a sequence on the first track.

146
00:06:50,090 --> 00:06:53,470
If I want to extend the
end of the animation

147
00:06:53,470 --> 00:06:54,570
to a further frame,

148
00:06:54,570 --> 00:06:56,730
I just need to position the play head

149
00:06:56,730 --> 00:06:58,260
and press Control + End

150
00:06:58,260 --> 00:07:00,340
as we do in the timeline.

151
00:07:00,340 --> 00:07:02,330
The image sequence is read

152
00:07:02,330 --> 00:07:05,440
at the speed of our general frame rate.

153
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:08,600
To be able to preview
our animated sequence

154
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:11,310
we can switch to Sequence Preview.

155
00:07:11,310 --> 00:07:15,140
It will display our sequence
track so we can collapse them

156
00:07:15,140 --> 00:07:18,120
and also the current
frames that is being read.

157
00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:21,840
If I press the Space
bar to preview my video,

158
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:25,040
we can see that the frame
rate is not very good,

159
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:28,700
but this is because Blender is
currently caching the video,

160
00:07:28,700 --> 00:07:31,990
meaning that is kind pre-calculating it.

161
00:07:31,990 --> 00:07:35,670
The cached sequence is
shown into a brighter red

162
00:07:35,670 --> 00:07:37,955
beneath the tracks.

163
00:07:37,955 --> 00:07:41,170
Once the images are cached
if we play it again,

164
00:07:41,170 --> 00:07:43,220
it will play real time.

165
00:07:43,220 --> 00:07:45,370
So what I will quickly do now

166
00:07:45,370 --> 00:07:49,700
is repeat the process and
import the five image sequences

167
00:07:49,700 --> 00:07:51,820
I have created for this shot.

168
00:07:51,820 --> 00:07:55,280
Since there is no blending
between sequence one and two,

169
00:07:55,280 --> 00:08:00,250
I can left click and drag
sequence two on the first track.

170
00:08:00,250 --> 00:08:02,920
I can do the same with sequence three,

171
00:08:02,920 --> 00:08:05,130
moving it on the first track,

172
00:08:05,130 --> 00:08:08,200
but I will need to cut it a bit

173
00:08:08,200 --> 00:08:10,080
because there are some repeating frame

174
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:13,050
between the previous
sequence and the current one.

175
00:08:13,050 --> 00:08:16,290
To cut it I simply need
to place the play head

176
00:08:16,290 --> 00:08:19,790
wherever I want to cut and press K.

177
00:08:19,790 --> 00:08:21,880
Then I will scrub through the timeline

178
00:08:21,880 --> 00:08:24,600
to watch out for any repetition

179
00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:27,600
and remove any content
from the selected strip

180
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:31,310
by cutting it and then
pressing X to delete it.

181
00:08:31,310 --> 00:08:35,570
Now I'd like to blend the
next sequence onto the other,

182
00:08:35,570 --> 00:08:37,640
creating a fading.

183
00:08:37,640 --> 00:08:42,420
The first important thing is
to find out the right timing

184
00:08:42,420 --> 00:08:43,950
between the moment our character

185
00:08:43,950 --> 00:08:46,900
is getting out of the frame

186
00:08:46,900 --> 00:08:49,690
and when he's getting back into the frame.

187
00:08:49,690 --> 00:08:53,100
Here I feel that the
time we wait is too long

188
00:08:53,100 --> 00:08:56,510
before we see the
character back into frame.

189
00:08:56,510 --> 00:08:59,690
So I will remove a part of the sequence.

190
00:08:59,690 --> 00:09:01,350
Then I will move it on
top above the other,

191
00:09:01,350 --> 00:09:04,460
so that we have overlapping sequences.

192
00:09:04,460 --> 00:09:06,000
Pressing the N key

193
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:09,190
I will be able to open
the Properties panel.

194
00:09:09,190 --> 00:09:13,100
And in this Strip tab,
in the Adjust panel,

195
00:09:13,100 --> 00:09:15,590
I have an Opacity option.

196
00:09:15,590 --> 00:09:19,614
I will click on the little dot
icon near the opacity level,

197
00:09:19,614 --> 00:09:22,750
and it will automatically
insert the key frames.

198
00:09:22,750 --> 00:09:27,110
It means that on this frame
our strip will be fully opaque.

199
00:09:27,110 --> 00:09:30,700
I can scrub back to the
beginning of the strip

200
00:09:30,700 --> 00:09:33,560
and then set the opacity to zero

201
00:09:33,560 --> 00:09:37,340
and click this icon to
insert a new key frame.

202
00:09:37,340 --> 00:09:40,270
And we've just animated
the opacity of the strip,

203
00:09:40,270 --> 00:09:42,610
creating a natural fade.

204
00:09:42,610 --> 00:09:46,800
From there, I can select
our last sequence strip.

205
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:49,860
Left click and drag, or press G,

206
00:09:49,860 --> 00:09:53,040
to move it just after
the current sequence.

207
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:53,950
From there,

208
00:09:53,950 --> 00:09:57,000
I advise you to cache the
animation and double check it

209
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,710
to see if it looks natural.

210
00:09:58,710 --> 00:10:01,680
To cache the animation just play it once.

211
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:04,130
The final touch will be to boost a bit

212
00:10:04,130 --> 00:10:06,680
the contrast of our shots.

213
00:10:06,680 --> 00:10:10,600
So we press Shift + A and
add an adjustment layer.

214
00:10:10,600 --> 00:10:13,200
I will move it on top of everything

215
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:17,000
and then I will left click
and drag onto one of the side

216
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,820
to extend it till the end of the movie.

217
00:10:19,820 --> 00:10:22,680
Just think of it as an empty strip.

218
00:10:22,680 --> 00:10:27,140
But whatever adjustment
modifier I will add on top of it

219
00:10:27,140 --> 00:10:32,060
will be applied to any strip
beneath this adjustment layer.

220
00:10:32,060 --> 00:10:34,730
So if I go to the Modifier tab,

221
00:10:34,730 --> 00:10:37,040
I can add a new modifier

222
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:39,580
and I will choose the Curve modifier.

223
00:10:39,580 --> 00:10:44,130
If I now left click on the
top right corner of the curve

224
00:10:44,130 --> 00:10:45,417
and move this value up,

225
00:10:45,417 --> 00:10:49,230
this will make the bright
color of our picture

226
00:10:49,230 --> 00:10:50,360
even brighter.

227
00:10:50,360 --> 00:10:52,960
So just push it ever so slightly.

228
00:10:52,960 --> 00:10:54,480
And I will then click somewhere

229
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:56,570
in the bottom left corner of the curve

230
00:10:56,570 --> 00:10:58,910
and just drag it down a little bit

231
00:10:58,910 --> 00:11:02,240
so that the darker tone
will be a little darker.

232
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:03,073
So in the end,

233
00:11:03,073 --> 00:11:08,073
we have kind of boosted a bit
the contrast of our picture.

234
00:11:08,260 --> 00:11:11,320
If you click back and
forth onto the eye icon,

235
00:11:11,320 --> 00:11:12,510
you can see your picture

236
00:11:12,510 --> 00:11:15,700
with and without this curve modifier.

237
00:11:15,700 --> 00:11:19,570
From there, you can add
another modifier if you want.

238
00:11:19,570 --> 00:11:23,870
For example, a tone
mapping or a color balance,

239
00:11:23,870 --> 00:11:27,000
and change a bit the colors of your shot.

240
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,220
To make it warmer, for example.

241
00:11:29,220 --> 00:11:31,640
I won't go any further on this topic

242
00:11:31,640 --> 00:11:34,670
because I'm not a
specialist of compositing.

243
00:11:34,670 --> 00:11:36,720
Just experiment a bit with those modifier

244
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:38,853
and see how they behave.

245
00:11:39,690 --> 00:11:42,040
From there to render your movie,

246
00:11:42,040 --> 00:11:45,540
simply choose a file path and output.

247
00:11:45,540 --> 00:11:49,410
Then I advise you to
select a movie file format

248
00:11:49,410 --> 00:11:50,263
like ffmpeg.

249
00:11:51,340 --> 00:11:55,517
I generally choose mp4
and then switch to h264

250
00:11:56,760 --> 00:11:59,350
and use a loss-less quality.

251
00:11:59,350 --> 00:12:02,210
Then go into the Sequence editor,

252
00:12:02,210 --> 00:12:04,950
View, Sequence Render Animation.

253
00:12:04,950 --> 00:12:07,303
Wait, and enjoy your movie.
