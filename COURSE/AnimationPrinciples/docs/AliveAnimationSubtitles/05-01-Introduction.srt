00:00:00,810 --> 00:00:02,690
- [Narrator] Welcome to chapter five.

2
00:00:02,690 --> 00:00:06,250
This is the first chapter
where we are going to animate

3
00:00:06,250 --> 00:00:08,290
a humanoid character.

4
00:00:08,290 --> 00:00:10,840
We will use some of the
techniques you've learned

5
00:00:10,840 --> 00:00:14,910
in the previous chapter
to make a first run cycle.

6
00:00:14,910 --> 00:00:18,340
You may think it's weird
to start with a run cycle,

7
00:00:18,340 --> 00:00:20,870
while we haven't learned to walk,

8
00:00:20,870 --> 00:00:25,220
but runs are easier to
animate than a walk cycle.

9
00:00:25,220 --> 00:00:28,260
In this chapter, I will also introduce you

10
00:00:28,260 --> 00:00:31,310
to a new character rig we are going to use

11
00:00:31,310 --> 00:00:34,590
until the end of this animation course.

12
00:00:34,590 --> 00:00:37,220
Even if you want to jump
into the further chapter,

13
00:00:37,220 --> 00:00:40,270
I advise you to at least watch this video.

14
00:00:40,270 --> 00:00:43,340
We will go over some reference analysis,

15
00:00:43,340 --> 00:00:47,660
as well as some zero
recall video about rotation

16
00:00:47,660 --> 00:00:49,670
and how they work in (indistinct).

17
00:00:49,670 --> 00:00:52,553
Welcome to this new chapter
and let's get started.
