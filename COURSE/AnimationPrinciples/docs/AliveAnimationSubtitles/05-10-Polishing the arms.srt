00:00:01,110 --> 00:00:01,943
- [Instructor] This video,

2
00:00:01,943 --> 00:00:05,520
we are going to finish the
polish stage of our run cycle

3
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:08,510
animation by polishing the arms.

4
00:00:08,510 --> 00:00:12,200
Whenever you are walking
with forward kinematic chains

5
00:00:12,200 --> 00:00:13,490
like our arms,

6
00:00:13,490 --> 00:00:15,740
we need to start from
the root of the chain

7
00:00:15,740 --> 00:00:18,470
and then go down to the tip of the chin.

8
00:00:18,470 --> 00:00:19,620
So in this case,

9
00:00:19,620 --> 00:00:23,540
we will start with the
shoulders, then work on the arms,

10
00:00:23,540 --> 00:00:25,920
Then forearms, and finally hands.

11
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:28,020
To polish the shoulder animation.

12
00:00:28,020 --> 00:00:30,820
I will work first on the rotation,

13
00:00:30,820 --> 00:00:35,430
but this time I won't be
isolating each rotation channel

14
00:00:35,430 --> 00:00:39,000
one by one, but I will
work on the free channel

15
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:40,160
at the same time.

16
00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:44,450
The idea is to smooth out
the shoulder rotation,

17
00:00:44,450 --> 00:00:47,640
make sure that we don't
have any weird movement

18
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:50,097
into the shoulder or glitches.

19
00:00:50,097 --> 00:00:53,840
And the second thing is to
make sure that the extreme will

20
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:56,380
reads well and that we pushed the pose.

21
00:00:56,380 --> 00:00:59,970
So that we get a nice
and contrasted animation.

22
00:00:59,970 --> 00:01:03,080
The thing to remember is that the shoulder

23
00:01:03,080 --> 00:01:05,660
lead the motion of the torso,

24
00:01:05,660 --> 00:01:08,530
the shoulder pulled the whole chest up.

25
00:01:08,530 --> 00:01:10,140
So rotation wise,

26
00:01:10,140 --> 00:01:14,580
we should avoid making the
shoulder drag too much.

27
00:01:14,580 --> 00:01:17,340
So Kev, why is it so a little more complex

28
00:01:17,340 --> 00:01:20,360
to explain that what
we did with the spine?

29
00:01:20,360 --> 00:01:23,600
But my method is to move
the keys channel by channel

30
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:27,270
and see all of the character
behaves per channel

31
00:01:27,270 --> 00:01:29,110
and then work on the pose.

32
00:01:29,110 --> 00:01:32,240
So in this case, this is the
moment where are the shoulder

33
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:35,230
should be hitting it's extreme pose

34
00:01:35,230 --> 00:01:37,170
a little before the chest,

35
00:01:37,170 --> 00:01:40,200
so I'm trying to push the shoulder up

36
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:42,380
and then polish the curve,

37
00:01:42,380 --> 00:01:44,550
make it a little smoother

38
00:01:44,550 --> 00:01:47,700
so that I don't have
weird left to right motion

39
00:01:47,700 --> 00:01:48,970
during the transition.

40
00:01:48,970 --> 00:01:51,260
If we have a look to the final curve here,

41
00:01:51,260 --> 00:01:55,110
we can see that it has a pretty
classic shape in the end.

42
00:01:55,110 --> 00:01:59,210
We get a plateau on the X
rotation and the Z rotation

43
00:01:59,210 --> 00:02:01,380
whenever we are reaching the extreme.

44
00:02:01,380 --> 00:02:05,600
So it means that the shoulder
is not rotating that much

45
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:08,910
once it hit its highest pose

46
00:02:08,910 --> 00:02:11,870
whether it's forward or backward.

47
00:02:11,870 --> 00:02:14,260
And then we have the
fast transition during

48
00:02:14,260 --> 00:02:15,450
the passing pose.

49
00:02:15,450 --> 00:02:19,190
The work on the wire rotation
curve is less sensitive.

50
00:02:19,190 --> 00:02:22,360
We do have to work on it
because it could cause

51
00:02:22,360 --> 00:02:24,980
a gimbal lock, but the twisting motion is

52
00:02:24,980 --> 00:02:28,160
that is driven by the Y eular rotation

53
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:33,120
is not quite natural, but
once combined with the X and Z

54
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:36,470
rotation curves, it
blends pretty smoothly.

55
00:02:36,470 --> 00:02:41,130
So the idea is just to
kind of fix the orientation

56
00:02:41,130 --> 00:02:44,340
of the shoulder on those specific poses.

57
00:02:44,340 --> 00:02:46,700
I know it can sound a bit abstract here,

58
00:02:46,700 --> 00:02:49,870
but what I'm trying to
avoid is any distortions

59
00:02:49,870 --> 00:02:51,500
in the shoulder shape

60
00:02:51,500 --> 00:02:55,350
while the X and Z curves are
here to drive the motion.

61
00:02:55,350 --> 00:02:57,140
Don forget to use the motion path

62
00:02:57,140 --> 00:02:59,920
to double-check your arcs and spacing.

63
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:02,160
And that you can use to tail off the bone

64
00:03:02,160 --> 00:03:05,890
or tip of the bone to
calculate this motion path.

65
00:03:05,890 --> 00:03:06,723
In this case,

66
00:03:06,723 --> 00:03:10,340
it result in showing you
the tip of the shoulder,

67
00:03:10,340 --> 00:03:12,223
not the root of the clavicles.

68
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:18,220
At this stage, you can call
the shoulder polishing done,

69
00:03:18,220 --> 00:03:21,430
or you can push it a little
further using location.

70
00:03:21,430 --> 00:03:23,450
Using the Y and Z location curve,

71
00:03:23,450 --> 00:03:27,790
I will make the shoulder drag
a bit just before it hits

72
00:03:27,790 --> 00:03:31,360
it's extreme, but I don't
want to delay the shoulder.

73
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:36,360
So I reset the pose by moving
the keys that has a zero value

74
00:03:36,530 --> 00:03:37,680
on frame six.

75
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:40,780
And then I will slightly
push the shoulder down

76
00:03:40,780 --> 00:03:43,863
during the passing pose so
that when you put weight

77
00:03:43,863 --> 00:03:45,300
into the shoulder,

78
00:03:45,300 --> 00:03:47,820
as if just after the impact,

79
00:03:47,820 --> 00:03:51,410
it was getting pulled
down by its own weight,

80
00:03:51,410 --> 00:03:54,590
then I will do the same
in the pose just after

81
00:03:54,590 --> 00:03:56,730
it reaches it's highest point.

82
00:03:56,730 --> 00:03:59,560
I will push it a little higher

83
00:03:59,560 --> 00:04:02,450
as if there was momentum into the shoulder

84
00:04:02,450 --> 00:04:05,780
that make it go a little further up.

85
00:04:05,780 --> 00:04:07,800
So I keep it very subtle.

86
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:12,230
The idea is just to
emphasize what we did before.

87
00:04:12,230 --> 00:04:15,330
Whenever the shoulder
is in it's down pose,

88
00:04:15,330 --> 00:04:19,160
I make it drag a little bit just to touch

89
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:21,560
and I push it down a little more.

90
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:24,660
And when it has reach its highest point,

91
00:04:24,660 --> 00:04:26,130
one or two frame later,

92
00:04:26,130 --> 00:04:28,300
I will just raise it a little more

93
00:04:28,300 --> 00:04:31,830
to bring a bit of momentum
into the shoulder motion.

94
00:04:31,830 --> 00:04:35,000
The heavy lifting was
done with the rotation,

95
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:38,240
and this is what will
brings you nice arcs.

96
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:42,170
And then you can bring some
texture to your animation

97
00:04:42,170 --> 00:04:43,630
using location.

98
00:04:43,630 --> 00:04:47,140
Again, it must be subtle
because if you push too far,

99
00:04:47,140 --> 00:04:50,190
you will break the shape of
the shoulder and it will look

100
00:04:50,190 --> 00:04:52,393
pointy or out of place.

101
00:04:57,200 --> 00:04:59,760
Unleashing the arm is
pretty straightforward.

102
00:04:59,760 --> 00:05:03,430
One of the first thing you
may do is track the position

103
00:05:03,430 --> 00:05:05,980
of the elbow tweak controller

104
00:05:05,980 --> 00:05:10,320
so that you can easily track
your arcs from the elbow.

105
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:14,770
I also often use the end
position using the wrist

106
00:05:14,770 --> 00:05:16,290
tweaker controller,

107
00:05:16,290 --> 00:05:18,530
but at this stage it will be better

108
00:05:18,530 --> 00:05:21,580
to focus on the elbow position.

109
00:05:21,580 --> 00:05:22,860
While on the reference,

110
00:05:22,860 --> 00:05:26,540
we have seen that there
was a slight slowing down

111
00:05:26,540 --> 00:05:27,940
during the passing pose,

112
00:05:27,940 --> 00:05:31,940
and then reaccelerating
whether forward or backward,

113
00:05:31,940 --> 00:05:36,550
this is really noticeable when
using extreme slow motion.

114
00:05:36,550 --> 00:05:39,460
And when I've tried, it felt a bit weird.

115
00:05:39,460 --> 00:05:40,640
So in my case,

116
00:05:40,640 --> 00:05:44,050
I prefer to have a fast
motion during the passing

117
00:05:44,050 --> 00:05:47,840
and ease into the extreme and old pose,

118
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:49,810
which clearly shows when we look

119
00:05:49,810 --> 00:05:52,300
at the spacing on those arcs,

120
00:05:52,300 --> 00:05:55,220
we have a large spacing during the passing

121
00:05:55,220 --> 00:05:58,640
and it gets tighter on up pose.

122
00:05:58,640 --> 00:06:02,500
Shape wise from a side view,
the arc is very smooth.

123
00:06:02,500 --> 00:06:03,333
From the front view,

124
00:06:03,333 --> 00:06:06,590
my main concern was not to make the elbow

125
00:06:06,590 --> 00:06:09,280
going too far on the outside

126
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:10,690
because the faster you run,

127
00:06:10,690 --> 00:06:13,560
the closer to the body your elbow will be.

128
00:06:13,560 --> 00:06:16,720
And then I make sure it
goes slightly on the inside

129
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:18,010
on both extremes.

130
00:06:18,010 --> 00:06:21,850
Third wise, we have a
smooth sensory dull shape

131
00:06:21,850 --> 00:06:24,470
regarding the X rotation,

132
00:06:24,470 --> 00:06:28,070
which mainly influence the
distance between the chest

133
00:06:28,070 --> 00:06:30,410
and the elbow from the front view.

134
00:06:30,410 --> 00:06:34,490
And then the Z and Y
rotation curve mainly drive

135
00:06:34,490 --> 00:06:36,110
the swing of the arm.

136
00:06:36,110 --> 00:06:40,160
So we can spot on them
our usual plateaus shape

137
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:42,060
when we reach the extreme,

138
00:06:42,060 --> 00:06:45,670
weave the fast transition
during the passing.

139
00:06:45,670 --> 00:06:48,880
I've also slightly worked the W curve

140
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:51,340
just to remove any glitches.

141
00:06:51,340 --> 00:06:53,670
The W curve is generally involved

142
00:06:53,670 --> 00:06:56,333
whenever you are trying
to reach an extreme

143
00:06:56,333 --> 00:07:01,333
with the other curve and the
quaternions can't solve it.

144
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:03,880
So unless you are doing a full revolution,

145
00:07:03,880 --> 00:07:07,770
the W curve is generally
not that much involved.

146
00:07:07,770 --> 00:07:11,890
But it does need some attention
on such a moving part,

147
00:07:11,890 --> 00:07:15,690
since it's a long forward kinematic chain,

148
00:07:15,690 --> 00:07:18,290
it's in everything, the
movement of the torso,

149
00:07:18,290 --> 00:07:20,920
then the movement of
the shoulder, et cetera.

150
00:07:20,920 --> 00:07:25,520
So we do need to double check
the motion path of the elbow

151
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:30,520
and eye my Y, Z and X rotation
curve are kind of smooth

152
00:07:30,640 --> 00:07:32,250
in the graph editor.

153
00:07:32,250 --> 00:07:35,590
I'm just double checking that the W curve

154
00:07:35,590 --> 00:07:38,140
is not bringing any glitches.

155
00:07:38,140 --> 00:07:41,310
In the end, as for every
cycle we've been working on,

156
00:07:41,310 --> 00:07:45,500
make sure that your first
and last keys are the same

157
00:07:45,500 --> 00:07:46,980
and they are aligned.
