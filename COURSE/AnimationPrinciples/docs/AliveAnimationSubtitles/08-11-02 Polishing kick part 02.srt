1
00:00:00,140 --> 00:00:01,861
- [Instructor] As usual, once I'm done

2
00:00:01,861 --> 00:00:05,240
with polishing the torso
or the center of gravity,

3
00:00:05,240 --> 00:00:08,200
I work on the contact
points of the character.

4
00:00:08,200 --> 00:00:11,020
So I will work on the feet as always.

5
00:00:11,020 --> 00:00:12,560
I will start with the right leg

6
00:00:12,560 --> 00:00:14,770
as it's going to be pretty fast.

7
00:00:14,770 --> 00:00:16,360
First of all, I want to make sure

8
00:00:16,360 --> 00:00:18,670
that the leg gets fully extended

9
00:00:18,670 --> 00:00:20,360
before the foot leave the ground.

10
00:00:20,360 --> 00:00:22,380
So I will simply delay by a couple

11
00:00:22,380 --> 00:00:24,600
of frame the moment the
foot leave the ground.

12
00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:26,686
From there, I will make sure that the foot

13
00:00:26,686 --> 00:00:30,100
is drawing a nice arc in space,

14
00:00:30,100 --> 00:00:34,520
and then I will slightly
push the z location curve

15
00:00:34,520 --> 00:00:38,400
to create the up pose of the
foot right in the middle.

16
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:41,660
I will then switch the handles to vector

17
00:00:41,660 --> 00:00:44,240
for the starting point and ending point

18
00:00:44,240 --> 00:00:46,630
of the z location and x location.

19
00:00:46,630 --> 00:00:48,480
This way I make sure that the foot

20
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:50,630
is accelerating when leaving the ground

21
00:00:50,630 --> 00:00:53,810
and when it's about to contact the ground.

22
00:00:53,810 --> 00:00:56,930
Then I can revise the heel orientation

23
00:00:56,930 --> 00:01:00,190
or heel rotation using
the heel controller,

24
00:01:00,190 --> 00:01:03,090
raising the heel just before
the foot leave the ground

25
00:01:03,090 --> 00:01:05,040
and flattening the foot a couple

26
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:07,100
of frame after the contact pose.

27
00:01:07,100 --> 00:01:10,850
Then I'm also working on
the toes of the character.

28
00:01:10,850 --> 00:01:13,330
So as usual, I will make them drag,

29
00:01:13,330 --> 00:01:15,610
meaning that they will be pointing

30
00:01:15,610 --> 00:01:17,920
toward their previous position.

31
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:19,030
On the contact pose,

32
00:01:19,030 --> 00:01:20,490
I will raise the toes

33
00:01:20,490 --> 00:01:23,890
and then I will slap them on
the ground one frame later.

34
00:01:23,890 --> 00:01:26,640
And I will convert the contacting key

35
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:28,330
of the toes to vector

36
00:01:28,330 --> 00:01:30,450
so that I'm sure that
they are accelerating

37
00:01:30,450 --> 00:01:31,990
before they hit the ground,

38
00:01:31,990 --> 00:01:35,090
even if it's over only one frame.

39
00:01:35,090 --> 00:01:37,730
Then I will work on the jumping motion.

40
00:01:37,730 --> 00:01:39,040
So I will make sure

41
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:42,360
that the foot leave the ground late enough

42
00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:45,100
so that I get an extended leg.

43
00:01:45,100 --> 00:01:46,610
And as I move the foot,

44
00:01:46,610 --> 00:01:49,760
I will also work on
its quaternion rotation

45
00:01:49,760 --> 00:01:50,860
to make it drag.

46
00:01:50,860 --> 00:01:53,240
So the ball of the foot will be pointing

47
00:01:53,240 --> 00:01:55,550
toward its previous position,

48
00:01:55,550 --> 00:01:57,450
and then while in the air,

49
00:01:57,450 --> 00:01:59,470
I will make it transition

50
00:01:59,470 --> 00:02:02,420
toward its next position,

51
00:02:02,420 --> 00:02:04,790
toward the contacting pose.

52
00:02:04,790 --> 00:02:08,100
I will slightly open the
foot just before the impact

53
00:02:08,100 --> 00:02:11,840
so that the character land
on the edge of the foot,

54
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:15,070
and it slightly pivot while the weight

55
00:02:15,070 --> 00:02:16,790
is shifting onto the foot.

56
00:02:16,790 --> 00:02:19,600
Then I will work on the kicking motion

57
00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:21,290
of this current foot,

58
00:02:21,290 --> 00:02:23,760
the foot that is contacting the ground.

59
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:25,600
It has a specific rotation,

60
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:27,780
as we have see in the reference.

61
00:02:27,780 --> 00:02:29,850
It twist to follow the hips

62
00:02:29,850 --> 00:02:32,270
and then just after the impact,

63
00:02:32,270 --> 00:02:34,150
it twist backward very fast.

64
00:02:34,150 --> 00:02:37,260
So we have this very fast
back and forth motion

65
00:02:37,260 --> 00:02:39,510
of the heel toward the target.

66
00:02:39,510 --> 00:02:43,460
In this case, it's driven
by the W quaternion rotation

67
00:02:43,460 --> 00:02:46,250
for my foot, and I'm creating this V shape

68
00:02:46,250 --> 00:02:47,160
with the curve

69
00:02:47,160 --> 00:02:49,180
where when it's going down,

70
00:02:49,180 --> 00:02:51,690
it rotates toward the target,

71
00:02:51,690 --> 00:02:55,046
and after frame 81, it rotates back.

72
00:02:55,046 --> 00:02:57,279
To make this motion less linear,

73
00:02:57,279 --> 00:02:59,990
I will hold the pose
for a couple of frames

74
00:02:59,990 --> 00:03:03,750
by adding a new key on frame 80 and 81.

75
00:03:03,750 --> 00:03:08,150
And then I will make the
foot ease into its rest pose,

76
00:03:08,150 --> 00:03:10,800
just before the left foot enter contact

77
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:11,690
with the ground.

78
00:03:11,690 --> 00:03:12,737
Once I'm done with this,

79
00:03:12,737 --> 00:03:15,800
I will work on the last step backward

80
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:19,000
with the same checkpoint
in mind as before.

81
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:22,400
I want to make sure that
the leg extend a bit

82
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:24,860
before the foot leave the ground.

83
00:03:24,860 --> 00:03:27,340
And that the foot contact the ground

84
00:03:27,340 --> 00:03:31,470
before the weight of the
character starts to shift

85
00:03:31,470 --> 00:03:34,060
toward the current foot.

86
00:03:34,060 --> 00:03:37,560
So as usual, I'm often delaying the moment

87
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:39,580
where the foot is leaving the ground.

88
00:03:39,580 --> 00:03:41,970
In this case, by two frames.

89
00:03:41,970 --> 00:03:45,040
And then I switch the
contacting pose to vector

90
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:47,155
so that I get a hard contact.

91
00:03:47,155 --> 00:03:51,240
And I input a bit of up pose in between

92
00:03:51,240 --> 00:03:54,890
using the z location to make
the foot raise in space.

93
00:03:54,890 --> 00:03:56,520
From there, as usual,

94
00:03:56,520 --> 00:03:59,840
I will refine a bit the heel controller

95
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:01,950
to make sure that the heel is raising

96
00:04:01,950 --> 00:04:04,420
whenever the foot is getting pulled,

97
00:04:04,420 --> 00:04:07,090
and that it's at it highest point

98
00:04:07,090 --> 00:04:09,170
just before the contact frame.

99
00:04:09,170 --> 00:04:11,760
Then I will switch to the foot rotation

100
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:15,180
and see if I can make
it drag a little bit.

101
00:04:15,180 --> 00:04:16,400
And as I did before,

102
00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:19,830
I want the foot to rotate
a bit after the contact

103
00:04:19,830 --> 00:04:24,000
as the weight of the character
is shifting upon this foot.

104
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:27,600
And also, contact first
with the inner edge

105
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:30,990
of the foot, and then the foot will tilt

106
00:04:30,990 --> 00:04:32,320
to become flat.

107
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:35,550
This create a slight roll on the ground

108
00:04:35,550 --> 00:04:38,430
of the foot that looks more natural

109
00:04:38,430 --> 00:04:41,720
than the foot getting flattened
directly on the ground

110
00:04:41,720 --> 00:04:43,360
as it contacts.

111
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:45,520
As the final detail, as usual,

112
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:47,490
I will work on the toes.

113
00:04:47,490 --> 00:04:49,730
Whenever the foot is leaving the ground,

114
00:04:49,730 --> 00:04:52,210
I will make the toes drag

115
00:04:52,210 --> 00:04:54,700
and eventually, when
it contacts the ground,

116
00:04:54,700 --> 00:04:55,980
I will raise them a bit

117
00:04:55,980 --> 00:04:59,280
so that they slap the
frame after the contact.

118
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:01,900
Another detail I wanted
to add is the friction

119
00:05:01,900 --> 00:05:03,440
of the toes on the ground

120
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:06,320
when the character is
twisting to throw the kick.

121
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:08,760
If you flatten your hand on the table

122
00:05:08,760 --> 00:05:11,980
and you push on the hand
and try to twist it,

123
00:05:11,980 --> 00:05:14,290
you will see your fingers dragging

124
00:05:14,290 --> 00:05:16,350
in the opposite direction as the twist

125
00:05:16,350 --> 00:05:18,690
because of the friction and the resistance

126
00:05:18,690 --> 00:05:20,970
on the ground, or on the table.

127
00:05:20,970 --> 00:05:23,070
So this is what I'm doing here

128
00:05:23,070 --> 00:05:25,420
using the z Euler rotation.

129
00:05:25,420 --> 00:05:28,930
I rotate them toward
their previous position.

130
00:05:28,930 --> 00:05:32,830
It's the same principle
as when we lift the foot

131
00:05:32,830 --> 00:05:35,470
but in this case, the
motion is side to side

132
00:05:35,470 --> 00:05:38,233
instead of being up and down.

133
00:05:38,233 --> 00:05:41,377
From there, I've worked on the left foot.

134
00:05:41,377 --> 00:05:44,550
At this point, the
workflow is pretty linear.

135
00:05:44,550 --> 00:05:47,880
I hope you understand what
I've been doing before

136
00:05:47,880 --> 00:05:51,290
and if not, you should rewatch the videos.

137
00:05:51,290 --> 00:05:53,380
I know how confusing it can be

138
00:05:53,380 --> 00:05:54,920
to read the graph editor,

139
00:05:54,920 --> 00:05:58,250
especially for beginners
where you are not comfortable

140
00:05:58,250 --> 00:05:59,580
with the tools.

141
00:05:59,580 --> 00:06:03,760
So talking about poses, rhythm and spacing

142
00:06:03,760 --> 00:06:07,730
might not translate for
you watching those curve.

143
00:06:07,730 --> 00:06:11,010
If it's the case, jump back
to the squirrel chapter

144
00:06:11,010 --> 00:06:13,940
and make sure that you
practice with this character.

145
00:06:13,940 --> 00:06:14,860
During the switch,

146
00:06:14,860 --> 00:06:17,330
I'm mainly reworking the up pose

147
00:06:17,330 --> 00:06:21,190
so that it's smallest in
the middle of the motion

148
00:06:21,190 --> 00:06:24,150
of the foot toward its new position.

149
00:06:24,150 --> 00:06:27,820
And as you can see, I deal
with the z curve a bit

150
00:06:27,820 --> 00:06:29,720
like with the bouncing ball

151
00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:32,850
with vector handles when the
foot is leaving the ground

152
00:06:32,850 --> 00:06:34,340
and hitting the ground

153
00:06:34,340 --> 00:06:36,750
and a scale key in between.

154
00:06:36,750 --> 00:06:38,080
Now, as you have guessed,

155
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:41,250
most of the work was during the kicking,

156
00:06:41,250 --> 00:06:44,720
first, make sure that you
calculate your motion path.

157
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:46,790
The first choice I did

158
00:06:46,790 --> 00:06:50,320
was to make the foot to stay on the ground

159
00:06:50,320 --> 00:06:52,040
as long as possible.

160
00:06:52,040 --> 00:06:53,760
This way we do get the feeling

161
00:06:53,760 --> 00:06:56,490
that the hips is pulling the leg

162
00:06:56,490 --> 00:06:58,430
as strong as possible.

163
00:06:58,430 --> 00:07:02,450
But also, it will all
need to get less frames

164
00:07:02,450 --> 00:07:03,390
to throw the kick

165
00:07:03,390 --> 00:07:05,400
so that it will be very fast,

166
00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:06,530
and very snappy.

167
00:07:06,530 --> 00:07:08,450
So as the foot is leaving the ground,

168
00:07:08,450 --> 00:07:10,680
I make sure that it's very close

169
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:13,070
to its initial pose

170
00:07:13,070 --> 00:07:15,172
so that I will have a big spacing

171
00:07:15,172 --> 00:07:19,780
between the starting frame
and the contacting frame.

172
00:07:19,780 --> 00:07:22,550
We will have a big acceleration,

173
00:07:22,550 --> 00:07:24,170
so for the in between,

174
00:07:24,170 --> 00:07:27,040
I'm favorizing the first position,

175
00:07:27,040 --> 00:07:29,750
so that the spacing get bigger and bigger

176
00:07:29,750 --> 00:07:31,490
and we do feel the acceleration

177
00:07:31,490 --> 00:07:33,380
of the foot before the contact pose.

178
00:07:33,380 --> 00:07:34,930
Once I feel good with this,

179
00:07:34,930 --> 00:07:37,450
I will make sure that my arcs are clean,

180
00:07:37,450 --> 00:07:39,910
especially on the impact frame.

181
00:07:39,910 --> 00:07:42,990
I will slightly tweak
the position of the foot

182
00:07:42,990 --> 00:07:44,590
from the camera view

183
00:07:44,590 --> 00:07:48,500
so that it perfectly wrap
around the punching bag,

184
00:07:48,500 --> 00:07:50,300
creating a nice arc.

185
00:07:50,300 --> 00:07:52,900
Since the punching bag is an accessory,

186
00:07:52,900 --> 00:07:56,190
I will pose the bag later on,

187
00:07:56,190 --> 00:07:57,878
paste on the foot motion.

188
00:07:57,878 --> 00:08:01,300
But it's not hard for
me to create a nice arc

189
00:08:01,300 --> 00:08:02,430
from the camera view,

190
00:08:02,430 --> 00:08:04,430
considering that the punching bag

191
00:08:04,430 --> 00:08:05,940
will be more or less there

192
00:08:05,940 --> 00:08:08,660
since we have blocked everything before.

193
00:08:08,660 --> 00:08:11,040
Then when the leg is pulled back,

194
00:08:11,040 --> 00:08:14,080
I will make sure that
I get a very clean arc

195
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:17,830
and that the foot is
accelerating toward the ground.

196
00:08:17,830 --> 00:08:21,043
Beyond being bound to your graph editor,

197
00:08:21,043 --> 00:08:26,043
you should be more watching
and analyzing your motion path.

198
00:08:26,520 --> 00:08:30,110
This is the tool that perfectly
translate to you the arcs

199
00:08:30,110 --> 00:08:32,212
and the spacing of your animation.

200
00:08:32,212 --> 00:08:34,810
Then with experience, you will be able

201
00:08:34,810 --> 00:08:38,230
to read this also into your graph editor.

202
00:08:38,230 --> 00:08:41,490
As usual, from there, I will
work on the heel controller.

203
00:08:41,490 --> 00:08:43,260
That's pretty straightforward.

204
00:08:43,260 --> 00:08:44,850
As the foot is leaving the ground,

205
00:08:44,850 --> 00:08:46,310
I'm raising the heel.

206
00:08:46,310 --> 00:08:47,630
The only tricky thing

207
00:08:47,630 --> 00:08:50,100
is that our character just jumped

208
00:08:50,100 --> 00:08:52,620
into the anticipation for the kick.

209
00:08:52,620 --> 00:08:54,220
So the heel is going down

210
00:08:54,220 --> 00:08:56,840
and then he's pushing to throw the kick.

211
00:08:56,840 --> 00:08:58,380
So the heel is raising.

212
00:08:58,380 --> 00:09:01,210
There is this slight
plateau at some point.

213
00:09:01,210 --> 00:09:05,180
From there it's all about
building the smear frames.

214
00:09:05,180 --> 00:09:08,180
Don't hesitate to work
with all the controllers,

215
00:09:08,180 --> 00:09:10,270
like the toe controller, for example,

216
00:09:10,270 --> 00:09:11,463
to make the foot longer

217
00:09:11,463 --> 00:09:14,530
as it's getting pulled from the ground.

218
00:09:14,530 --> 00:09:16,070
The trajectory of the knee

219
00:09:16,070 --> 00:09:17,490
will also be crucial,

220
00:09:17,490 --> 00:09:20,060
so it's very important to track the arc

221
00:09:20,060 --> 00:09:22,520
of the knee and from there,

222
00:09:22,520 --> 00:09:24,360
build the shape of the leg.

223
00:09:24,360 --> 00:09:26,670
Just think of the leg as a whip.

224
00:09:26,670 --> 00:09:29,360
You want to create a nice curly shape

225
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:30,940
with the whole leg

226
00:09:30,940 --> 00:09:34,240
that is going toward the kicking position.

227
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:36,910
Make sure that the foot orientation,

228
00:09:36,910 --> 00:09:40,700
make it drags toward
its previous position.

229
00:09:40,700 --> 00:09:44,660
And take advantage again
of all the controllers.

230
00:09:44,660 --> 00:09:46,990
There are tweaker on the top of the toes,

231
00:09:46,990 --> 00:09:50,760
so do not hesitate to
make those toes dragging.

232
00:09:50,760 --> 00:09:53,240
At this stage, it's not about animating

233
00:09:53,240 --> 00:09:55,460
but really sculpting your pose.

234
00:09:55,460 --> 00:09:58,490
There are only three
frames of your character.

235
00:09:58,490 --> 00:10:00,040
They must be perfect.

236
00:10:00,040 --> 00:10:01,740
One tip to get this muscle shape

237
00:10:01,740 --> 00:10:04,370
is to hide the heel of the character

238
00:10:04,370 --> 00:10:05,900
from the camera point of view.

239
00:10:05,900 --> 00:10:09,720
You can easily do this by
using the ankle tweaker

240
00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:12,420
instead of trying to rotate the foot.

241
00:10:12,420 --> 00:10:15,790
I'm trying my best to get
a smooth shape for the leg.

242
00:10:15,790 --> 00:10:19,790
There are limitation due to
the anatomy of the character

243
00:10:19,790 --> 00:10:22,780
but also the resolution of his mesh

244
00:10:22,780 --> 00:10:25,270
and the number of controllers in the rig.

245
00:10:25,270 --> 00:10:28,570
On the frame, just after
the contact with the bag,

246
00:10:28,570 --> 00:10:31,430
I will scale on one axis the sheen

247
00:10:31,430 --> 00:10:33,110
and the foot so that it feels

248
00:10:33,110 --> 00:10:35,490
like they are squashing on the bag.

249
00:10:35,490 --> 00:10:37,700
It's like creating an explosion.

250
00:10:37,700 --> 00:10:40,510
You start with a thin shape

251
00:10:40,510 --> 00:10:42,312
and then you make it very big.

252
00:10:42,312 --> 00:10:47,312
And this visual pop will bring more impact

253
00:10:47,540 --> 00:10:49,080
to your animation.

254
00:10:49,080 --> 00:10:51,960
And this is exactly what
we want for the kick.

255
00:10:51,960 --> 00:10:54,490
When it's done over one frame like that,

256
00:10:54,490 --> 00:10:57,840
it's barely viewable or noticeable

257
00:10:57,840 --> 00:10:59,390
but it will feel for sure.

258
00:10:59,390 --> 00:11:01,670
For this kind of shape,

259
00:11:01,670 --> 00:11:05,110
I don't really have any rules to tell you

260
00:11:05,110 --> 00:11:06,940
or to explain you.

261
00:11:06,940 --> 00:11:10,370
What I do advise you is
to search for references,

262
00:11:10,370 --> 00:11:12,610
like in anime, for example,

263
00:11:12,610 --> 00:11:15,717
where they do deform a lot the character

264
00:11:15,717 --> 00:11:19,250
to get crazy perspective

265
00:11:19,250 --> 00:11:23,000
or crazy impactful shapes like that.

266
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,970
You will also find this
kind of crazy shape

267
00:11:25,970 --> 00:11:27,840
in kids cartoon.

268
00:11:27,840 --> 00:11:32,000
I think that's a very,
very interesting source

269
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:36,460
of inspiration whenever it
comes to stylized animation

270
00:11:36,460 --> 00:11:40,220
because I guess that
as the target are kids,

271
00:11:40,220 --> 00:11:43,010
we consider that they are more fantasy

272
00:11:43,010 --> 00:11:45,960
or more imagination than adults.

273
00:11:45,960 --> 00:11:50,090
And so they would react
positively to crazy shapes.

274
00:11:50,090 --> 00:11:53,650
But in the end, if you
input it in your animation

275
00:11:53,650 --> 00:11:55,180
and it's subtle enough,

276
00:11:55,180 --> 00:11:58,360
it will work for any
public or any audience.

277
00:11:58,360 --> 00:12:01,840
For the last step of this
polishing stage on the left leg,

278
00:12:01,840 --> 00:12:04,340
there is nothing we haven't seen already

279
00:12:04,340 --> 00:12:06,300
or we haven't talked about

280
00:12:06,300 --> 00:12:08,810
while working on the other foot.

281
00:12:08,810 --> 00:12:11,080
So now we need to polish the hips,

282
00:12:11,080 --> 00:12:14,039
the chest, neck, head and then the arms

283
00:12:14,039 --> 00:12:15,456
of the character.
