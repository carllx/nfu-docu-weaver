1
00:00:00,140 --> 00:00:02,350
- Let's go ahead with the next pose,

2
00:00:02,350 --> 00:00:03,920
the right cross.

3
00:00:03,920 --> 00:00:05,890
While I have chosen not to push

4
00:00:05,890 --> 00:00:08,340
the pose too far for their job.

5
00:00:08,340 --> 00:00:09,860
For this specific pose,

6
00:00:09,860 --> 00:00:13,470
if you compare my current
pose to the reference,

7
00:00:13,470 --> 00:00:16,040
I've pushed my character way further.

8
00:00:16,040 --> 00:00:19,560
While the left jab is settle punch,

9
00:00:19,560 --> 00:00:23,620
to get closer to the target
and mask the next punch.

10
00:00:23,620 --> 00:00:27,680
This right cross is made
to destroy the target.

11
00:00:27,680 --> 00:00:30,800
So to bury this pose, I'm
applying the principle

12
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:33,370
we've learned in the previous chapter.

13
00:00:33,370 --> 00:00:37,010
I'm looking for the specific
features of this pose,

14
00:00:37,010 --> 00:00:40,870
like the foot orientation,
the distance between them,

15
00:00:40,870 --> 00:00:42,610
the orientation of the torso,

16
00:00:42,610 --> 00:00:45,600
and the position of the center of gravity

17
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:47,690
based on the feet position.

18
00:00:47,690 --> 00:00:48,880
On the right cross,

19
00:00:48,880 --> 00:00:53,090
the center of gravity is
shifting towards the left leg.

20
00:00:53,090 --> 00:00:56,650
So the front foot get
flattened on the ground,

21
00:00:56,650 --> 00:01:00,700
while the right foot twist
towards the left foot

22
00:01:00,700 --> 00:01:02,650
and its heel get traced.

23
00:01:02,650 --> 00:01:05,940
The torso is twisting toward the left foot

24
00:01:05,940 --> 00:01:09,680
and the shoulders are aligned
to create a straight line

25
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:11,240
toward the target.

26
00:01:11,240 --> 00:01:14,380
But since we have already
identified the marker of this pose

27
00:01:14,380 --> 00:01:16,480
I am already pushing the character.

28
00:01:16,480 --> 00:01:19,220
I've built a wider stance with the feet.

29
00:01:19,220 --> 00:01:21,460
I've lowered the center of gravity

30
00:01:21,460 --> 00:01:24,400
and the line of action is pushed forward.

31
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:28,130
It's more oriented toward the impact,

32
00:01:28,130 --> 00:01:32,980
but instead of keeping the
left elbow against the rib cage

33
00:01:32,980 --> 00:01:34,920
I've raised it backward,

34
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:38,130
so that both arms from the profile view

35
00:01:38,130 --> 00:01:40,350
creates a straight line.

36
00:01:40,350 --> 00:01:42,450
This way even the back arm

37
00:01:42,450 --> 00:01:46,750
or left arm is supporting the
directionality of the punch.

38
00:01:46,750 --> 00:01:49,390
Once I'm done with this,
I will slightly twist

39
00:01:49,390 --> 00:01:52,300
and tilt the neck toward
the right shoulder.

40
00:01:52,300 --> 00:01:55,610
I'm exaggerating the
previous concept we have seen

41
00:01:55,610 --> 00:01:58,660
where the character is protecting his face

42
00:01:58,660 --> 00:02:01,750
and his chin using his shoulder.

43
00:02:01,750 --> 00:02:05,210
One little detail I like to point out

44
00:02:05,210 --> 00:02:09,310
is the way I slightly
twist the punching fist

45
00:02:09,310 --> 00:02:11,720
so that the thumb is pointing down.

46
00:02:11,720 --> 00:02:14,310
This is the way you have
to throw a straight punch,

47
00:02:14,310 --> 00:02:19,210
whether it's across or a
jab to avoid overextension

48
00:02:19,210 --> 00:02:21,710
of the elbow that can lead to injuries,

49
00:02:21,710 --> 00:02:23,560
but it's also a way to get through

50
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:25,030
the guard of your opponent.

51
00:02:25,030 --> 00:02:27,120
But once you're done
with your character pose

52
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:30,122
don't forget to also
pose the punching back.

53
00:02:30,122 --> 00:02:33,090
So I've rotated the main controller

54
00:02:33,090 --> 00:02:35,520
so that we can start swinging the bag.

55
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:38,320
And then I'm using the
tweaker bone to shape it

56
00:02:38,320 --> 00:02:41,280
so that we feel like the
fist is getting through it.

57
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:43,470
Don't worry if you have
a hard time following

58
00:02:43,470 --> 00:02:45,140
everything I'm doing here.

59
00:02:45,140 --> 00:02:48,175
I will then provide a
slow paced time-lapse

60
00:02:48,175 --> 00:02:52,070
showing the whole process so
that you can follow along.

61
00:02:52,070 --> 00:02:54,500
Here I am trying to give you a guidance

62
00:02:54,500 --> 00:02:57,890
to what you have to look
for and what is your goal

63
00:02:57,890 --> 00:03:00,690
whenever you are creating
those different poses.

64
00:03:00,690 --> 00:03:03,510
The next pose is the
anticipation of the hook.

65
00:03:03,510 --> 00:03:07,410
Since the punching bag
just received a heavy blow

66
00:03:07,410 --> 00:03:10,380
and is no longer in
contact with the character,

67
00:03:10,380 --> 00:03:12,720
I've decided to pose it first.

68
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:15,520
I'm simply canceling
all the transformation,

69
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:19,163
and then I'm gonna rotate it
away using the main controller.

70
00:03:20,650 --> 00:03:23,580
But one super important tip
whenever you are building

71
00:03:23,580 --> 00:03:27,730
a new pose with your character,
is to cancel the rotation

72
00:03:27,730 --> 00:03:32,180
of the chest, the hips, and
even the torso root controller.

73
00:03:32,180 --> 00:03:36,080
First of all, it pushes
you to rethink about

74
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:38,940
the current pose instead of building it

75
00:03:38,940 --> 00:03:41,350
based on the previous pose.

76
00:03:41,350 --> 00:03:43,780
You will better watch your reference

77
00:03:43,780 --> 00:03:47,290
and try to match it, so it
will improve your focus,

78
00:03:47,290 --> 00:03:52,290
and secondly, it will avoid
you to source mistakes

79
00:03:52,300 --> 00:03:53,800
from the previous pose.

80
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:57,030
Especially when it comes
to hips and chest twisting.

81
00:03:57,030 --> 00:04:00,260
Now as usual, I've
repositioned the feet first,

82
00:04:00,260 --> 00:04:02,500
and then I'm working on the torso.

83
00:04:02,500 --> 00:04:05,150
Both the reference and the pushed pose

84
00:04:05,150 --> 00:04:09,190
shows that the character
has both of his feet flat.

85
00:04:09,190 --> 00:04:11,640
The character is gathering energy.

86
00:04:11,640 --> 00:04:14,670
So he's twisting toward the left.

87
00:04:14,670 --> 00:04:17,973
Since he will twist to
right to deliver the hook,

88
00:04:17,973 --> 00:04:22,020
his weight and center
of gravity is shifted

89
00:04:22,020 --> 00:04:24,000
toward the left foot.

90
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:28,140
Both arms are bent, the
right arm is bent in front

91
00:04:28,140 --> 00:04:31,100
of the character to protect his face,

92
00:04:31,100 --> 00:04:35,524
while the left arm is slightly
more open and slightly lower,

93
00:04:35,524 --> 00:04:40,340
preparing to fire a big
punch into the next pose.

94
00:04:40,340 --> 00:04:44,110
As usual, I work the
shoulder lines and the arms

95
00:04:44,110 --> 00:04:46,538
so that I get a nice curve.

96
00:04:46,538 --> 00:04:50,320
The arm and the shoulder
flow into an elliptic shape.

97
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:53,510
It supports the twisting of the character

98
00:04:53,510 --> 00:04:56,710
and it communicates the
fact that our character

99
00:04:56,710 --> 00:04:58,670
is going to swing the other way.

100
00:04:58,670 --> 00:05:01,560
Once you are done, don't
hesitate to play the animation

101
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:03,440
even if there is no timing.

102
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:05,840
It's just a good way to see if the flow

103
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:08,910
between the different
poses is okay for you.

104
00:05:08,910 --> 00:05:11,460
And you will get more
familiar with your animation.

105
00:05:11,460 --> 00:05:13,740
When jumping into the next pose, again,

106
00:05:13,740 --> 00:05:15,670
it's interesting to have a quick look

107
00:05:15,670 --> 00:05:17,260
to the video reference.

108
00:05:17,260 --> 00:05:19,741
As usual, my goal is to spot if the feet

109
00:05:19,741 --> 00:05:22,980
are changing of location,
and the right feet

110
00:05:22,980 --> 00:05:25,270
is currently moving forward.

111
00:05:25,270 --> 00:05:28,040
I will work exactly as I
did for the previous pose.

112
00:05:28,040 --> 00:05:31,220
I will first work on the
foot supporting the weight.

113
00:05:31,220 --> 00:05:33,550
Rotating each a bit inward.

114
00:05:33,550 --> 00:05:37,550
I will move the center of gravity
toward the supporting leg.

115
00:05:37,550 --> 00:05:41,584
Move forward the right leg,
as we have seen on the video.

116
00:05:41,584 --> 00:05:46,080
And then I will cancel
the rotation on the hips,

117
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:48,940
on the torso controller, and on the chest,

118
00:05:48,940 --> 00:05:53,280
and build the whole
torso pose from scratch.

119
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:56,760
I decided to make the hook to the head,

120
00:05:56,760 --> 00:05:59,480
because the previous punch is pretty low,

121
00:05:59,480 --> 00:06:03,130
this way by changing the
level we are hitting,

122
00:06:03,130 --> 00:06:05,400
we bring contrast to our animation

123
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:07,480
and so it will be more appealing.

124
00:06:07,480 --> 00:06:10,270
From there make sure that
you're applying the rules

125
00:06:10,270 --> 00:06:12,650
we have seen in the previous chapter.

126
00:06:12,650 --> 00:06:15,725
Make sure you properly
define the line of action.

127
00:06:15,725 --> 00:06:19,840
Make sure that the secondary
shape properly communicate

128
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:21,580
the wheel of your character.

129
00:06:21,580 --> 00:06:23,450
In the punching pose for example,

130
00:06:23,450 --> 00:06:27,116
make sure that the flow
of the arms really shows

131
00:06:27,116 --> 00:06:31,290
what your character is
hitting, how he's hitting,

132
00:06:31,290 --> 00:06:32,860
and as for the previous pose,

133
00:06:32,860 --> 00:06:35,520
I make sure that the character lower is

134
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:39,170
at between his shoulders
to protect his chin,

135
00:06:39,170 --> 00:06:41,788
because he's an experienced fighter.

136
00:06:41,788 --> 00:06:45,060
A little reminder here,
whenever you are posing

137
00:06:45,060 --> 00:06:47,270
the shoulder you can rotate them,

138
00:06:47,270 --> 00:06:50,760
but I also encourage you
to change their location.

139
00:06:50,760 --> 00:06:54,200
As for the finger, you will
have a hard time reaching

140
00:06:54,200 --> 00:06:57,212
the right pose by only using rotation.

141
00:06:57,212 --> 00:07:02,010
Avoid over-twisting the
chest and hips controller

142
00:07:02,010 --> 00:07:05,790
and for the rise using the torso root,

143
00:07:05,790 --> 00:07:09,620
the chest and hips can't
really twist that much.

144
00:07:09,620 --> 00:07:13,780
Doesn't mean they can't, but
if you over rotate the hips

145
00:07:13,780 --> 00:07:15,853
and rotate the chest the other way,

146
00:07:15,853 --> 00:07:17,640
it will look a bit weird,

147
00:07:17,640 --> 00:07:20,320
even for our stylized character.

148
00:07:20,320 --> 00:07:23,410
Again, don't forget to
turn around your pose.

149
00:07:23,410 --> 00:07:25,100
We are not animating to camera

150
00:07:25,100 --> 00:07:28,170
because I want your poses
to work from any angle.

151
00:07:28,170 --> 00:07:31,110
This is how you will
make the best progress.

152
00:07:31,110 --> 00:07:33,550
Later on, we will add the camera

153
00:07:33,550 --> 00:07:37,000
so that we can push the
appeal of our animation,

154
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:40,530
but for the time being,
let's create a nice animation

155
00:07:40,530 --> 00:07:43,050
without a specific camera angle.

156
00:07:43,050 --> 00:07:45,250
I spend a lot of time on each pose

157
00:07:45,250 --> 00:07:48,140
to make sure that
everything flows properly,

158
00:07:48,140 --> 00:07:51,990
that the character is
looking at what he's hitting,

159
00:07:51,990 --> 00:07:54,440
that I don't have any broken joint,

160
00:07:54,440 --> 00:07:56,870
unless this is a personal choice

161
00:07:56,870 --> 00:07:59,010
to push the pose, for example.

162
00:07:59,010 --> 00:08:01,960
And finally that my character is balanced.

163
00:08:01,960 --> 00:08:04,660
The more time you spend
during the blocking stage,

164
00:08:04,660 --> 00:08:07,590
the easier will be the position later on.

165
00:08:07,590 --> 00:08:09,540
And as for the previous poses,

166
00:08:09,540 --> 00:08:12,373
don't forget to pose the punching bag.
