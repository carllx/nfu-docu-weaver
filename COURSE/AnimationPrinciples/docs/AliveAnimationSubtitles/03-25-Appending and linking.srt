00:00:00,788 --> 00:00:01,621
- [Pierre] In this video,

2
00:00:01,621 --> 00:00:05,270
we'll see how to append
or link our character

3
00:00:05,270 --> 00:00:07,870
into a new Blender scene.

4
00:00:07,870 --> 00:00:10,130
At the time I'm recording this video,

5
00:00:10,130 --> 00:00:13,710
the linking system is
still under development.

6
00:00:13,710 --> 00:00:15,830
So I will just give you the very basic

7
00:00:15,830 --> 00:00:19,540
to be able to input your
character in a new scene

8
00:00:19,540 --> 00:00:21,780
to create whatever shots you want.

9
00:00:21,780 --> 00:00:23,460
You can use two different methods.

10
00:00:23,460 --> 00:00:26,570
The first one will be
to append our assets.

11
00:00:26,570 --> 00:00:28,400
I have a new Blender scene open.

12
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:32,030
I will get rid of everything,
go to File, Append.

13
00:00:32,030 --> 00:00:35,580
From there, I can search
into the file folder

14
00:00:35,580 --> 00:00:38,020
for the final squirrel file.

15
00:00:38,020 --> 00:00:40,380
Blender files are containers,

16
00:00:40,380 --> 00:00:42,993
and as soon as I will select it,

17
00:00:42,993 --> 00:00:45,640
a bunch of folders will appear.

18
00:00:45,640 --> 00:00:49,570
You can contender the
blend file as zipped file.

19
00:00:49,570 --> 00:00:52,030
You will find a hierarchy of folders

20
00:00:52,030 --> 00:00:54,740
containing all the assets you have

21
00:00:54,740 --> 00:00:57,250
in your original Blender file.

22
00:00:57,250 --> 00:01:00,260
Wherever it's your mesh
data, the scene options,

23
00:01:00,260 --> 00:01:03,150
the materials, the world, et cetera.

24
00:01:03,150 --> 00:01:05,360
And it also includes the collection.

25
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:06,870
So if I click my collection

26
00:01:06,870 --> 00:01:09,260
and import my squirrel collection,

27
00:01:09,260 --> 00:01:11,440
Blender will append
the squirrel collection

28
00:01:11,440 --> 00:01:15,230
including the squeal
object and the armature.

29
00:01:15,230 --> 00:01:19,270
And it will also append
everything used by this collection

30
00:01:19,270 --> 00:01:22,530
whether it's the material of our squirrel

31
00:01:22,530 --> 00:01:26,330
or the widget object I've
used to create the rig.

32
00:01:26,330 --> 00:01:30,140
So I can select all of those
objects in the collection

33
00:01:30,140 --> 00:01:34,290
and in the 3D viewport,
press X to delete them.

34
00:01:34,290 --> 00:01:37,710
From there I can use the rig
and the squirrel character,

35
00:01:37,710 --> 00:01:40,660
as we will do, in the original file.

36
00:01:40,660 --> 00:01:43,520
If I open the action editor now,

37
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:47,620
Blender has imported the
run cycle only animation

38
00:01:47,620 --> 00:01:50,890
because it was the one
that was used in the file.

39
00:01:50,890 --> 00:01:54,670
Since all the action were
not assigned to the armature

40
00:01:54,670 --> 00:01:58,170
on the origin file, they were not used

41
00:01:58,170 --> 00:02:00,020
and hence not imported.

42
00:02:00,020 --> 00:02:02,960
So I can go to File and Append again

43
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:06,860
and browse for the action
in our squirrel file.

44
00:02:06,860 --> 00:02:10,070
And I can choose whatever
action I want to import.

45
00:02:10,070 --> 00:02:13,170
Now I can find them in my action library

46
00:02:13,170 --> 00:02:15,240
but they have no users.

47
00:02:15,240 --> 00:02:17,720
So remember, if you want to keep them

48
00:02:17,720 --> 00:02:20,220
while saving and closing your file,

49
00:02:20,220 --> 00:02:22,500
you need to add a fake user.

50
00:02:22,500 --> 00:02:25,250
So basically, appending an asset

51
00:02:25,250 --> 00:02:28,993
is like copy and pasting
it from another file.

52
00:02:30,210 --> 00:02:32,690
Let's now have a look to linking.

53
00:02:32,690 --> 00:02:34,060
In an empty Blender file,

54
00:02:34,060 --> 00:02:38,890
I will go to File, Link and
browse for my original file.

55
00:02:38,890 --> 00:02:42,350
Go into the collection
and link the collection.

56
00:02:42,350 --> 00:02:43,720
I get something pretty close

57
00:02:43,720 --> 00:02:47,430
to what we had when I've
appended the collection.

58
00:02:47,430 --> 00:02:49,880
I can see my squirrel, I can see the rig,

59
00:02:49,880 --> 00:02:53,430
when I go into preview mode
to material seems to work.

60
00:02:53,430 --> 00:02:55,082
In the action editor,

61
00:02:55,082 --> 00:02:57,880
there seems to be the
animation in the library.

62
00:02:57,880 --> 00:02:59,570
The main difference we can here

63
00:02:59,570 --> 00:03:03,140
is that our characters seems
to be attached to an empty

64
00:03:03,140 --> 00:03:06,090
and it's currently an empty object.

65
00:03:06,090 --> 00:03:10,490
And this empty object
is currently instancing

66
00:03:10,490 --> 00:03:13,160
the collection of our squirrel.

67
00:03:13,160 --> 00:03:16,440
So it's not an independent
copy of the collection

68
00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:18,860
but currently some kind of a clone

69
00:03:18,860 --> 00:03:23,120
where I can't edit in, I only
have access to object mode.

70
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:24,810
And it's the same for the action.

71
00:03:24,810 --> 00:03:25,900
If I unfold it,

72
00:03:25,900 --> 00:03:29,030
you can see that the key
frame are not exposed

73
00:03:29,030 --> 00:03:30,950
and I can't modify them.

74
00:03:30,950 --> 00:03:32,980
To be able to access our rig,

75
00:03:32,980 --> 00:03:35,240
we need to go into the collection

76
00:03:35,240 --> 00:03:39,530
and find our collection under
the collection instance.

77
00:03:39,530 --> 00:03:42,930
This little chain icon is here to tell us

78
00:03:42,930 --> 00:03:44,660
this is a linked data.

79
00:03:44,660 --> 00:03:48,000
Right click on it and under ID data,

80
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:51,490
go to add library override hierarchy.

81
00:03:51,490 --> 00:03:55,560
It has created a new
collection called Squirrel

82
00:03:55,560 --> 00:03:59,650
with a new icon showing a
chain across by an arrow.

83
00:03:59,650 --> 00:04:01,900
Those are still a linked asset,

84
00:04:01,900 --> 00:04:05,600
but we can now access our squirrel object

85
00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:08,310
and also our squirrel armature.

86
00:04:08,310 --> 00:04:12,050
So I can get rid of my squirrel instance.

87
00:04:12,050 --> 00:04:14,690
The cool thing is that I
can now go into pause mode

88
00:04:14,690 --> 00:04:18,250
onto my armature and they
can manipulate my character

89
00:04:18,250 --> 00:04:20,460
as we will do in your original file.

90
00:04:20,460 --> 00:04:23,920
But if I want to edit
my character, I can't.

91
00:04:23,920 --> 00:04:27,070
Blender will output an error message

92
00:04:27,070 --> 00:04:30,170
because I can't did the data of my object

93
00:04:30,170 --> 00:04:32,430
nor the data of the mesh.

94
00:04:32,430 --> 00:04:35,300
We can see that the data are grayed out.

95
00:04:35,300 --> 00:04:38,670
So basically, they don't
belong to this Blender file

96
00:04:38,670 --> 00:04:40,410
but to another Blender file.

97
00:04:40,410 --> 00:04:44,800
So we can use those data,
but we can't modify them.

98
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:46,920
And it's the same with the armature,

99
00:04:46,920 --> 00:04:49,170
I can't go into edit mode.

100
00:04:49,170 --> 00:04:52,510
And it's also the same
with animation data,

101
00:04:52,510 --> 00:04:55,230
we can't edit the current animation.

102
00:04:55,230 --> 00:04:57,500
But since we can access our rig

103
00:04:57,500 --> 00:05:00,720
we can create new animation if we want.

104
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:01,880
And the cool thing

105
00:05:01,880 --> 00:05:06,160
is that we can make the
current animation local

106
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:09,520
so I can import all the link an animation

107
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:11,440
we have made previously,

108
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:15,290
make it local So is that
it's currently a copy

109
00:05:15,290 --> 00:05:18,700
of the animation and we
can modify it at will.

110
00:05:18,700 --> 00:05:22,037
To make it local, just select the action

111
00:05:22,037 --> 00:05:23,590
and click on the chain.

112
00:05:23,590 --> 00:05:26,330
It will become a local action,

113
00:05:26,330 --> 00:05:29,140
or you can simply duplicate the action

114
00:05:29,140 --> 00:05:31,840
and it will create a local action

115
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:35,270
that is exactly the
same as the linked one.

116
00:05:35,270 --> 00:05:39,070
The big benefit of used linked assets

117
00:05:39,070 --> 00:05:43,848
is that if the asset gets
modified in the original file,

118
00:05:43,848 --> 00:05:46,699
it will be updated in our scene.

119
00:05:46,699 --> 00:05:49,990
To do so, I just need to
go in your original file,

120
00:05:49,990 --> 00:05:53,140
modify the color of the
character for example,

121
00:05:53,140 --> 00:05:55,540
or its shape, save it.

122
00:05:55,540 --> 00:05:57,800
Then in the Blender
file where we are using

123
00:05:57,800 --> 00:06:01,570
those linked data, We can
save this file for example,

124
00:06:01,570 --> 00:06:04,270
and just revert it or reload it

125
00:06:04,270 --> 00:06:07,380
so that it will update
all the linked data.

126
00:06:07,380 --> 00:06:09,530
So while, as animators,

127
00:06:09,530 --> 00:06:13,890
we want to be able to create
a new animation, which we can,

128
00:06:13,890 --> 00:06:18,680
we may not want to mess up with
the rig all with the object.

129
00:06:18,680 --> 00:06:20,590
And if in the meantime,

130
00:06:20,590 --> 00:06:24,850
the character artist is
updating our character,

131
00:06:24,850 --> 00:06:29,480
Whenever we go back to the
scene to continue on animating

132
00:06:29,480 --> 00:06:31,800
it will update automatically.

133
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:36,800
So using linked asset is
super powerful in production.

134
00:06:37,450 --> 00:06:41,550
To summarize, we have seen
that when we append data

135
00:06:41,550 --> 00:06:44,020
from one Blender file to another,

136
00:06:44,020 --> 00:06:48,870
it creates an original copy,
it's like using copy and paste.

137
00:06:48,870 --> 00:06:53,680
When we link asset it will
currently create an empty object

138
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:56,560
with an instance of the asset.

139
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:58,870
To be able to use those assets

140
00:06:58,870 --> 00:07:02,200
we need to create a library override.

141
00:07:02,200 --> 00:07:04,850
The big benefit of library override

142
00:07:04,850 --> 00:07:09,160
is that we can use the
data from those assets

143
00:07:09,160 --> 00:07:13,180
but we can't edit them, so
they are kind of protected.

144
00:07:13,180 --> 00:07:16,180
And whenever the source
file is getting updated

145
00:07:17,110 --> 00:07:21,120
our current file will be updated too,

146
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:24,500
making it perfect for team work.

147
00:07:24,500 --> 00:07:27,270
So using a linked asset library

148
00:07:27,270 --> 00:07:31,183
is perfect for teamwork
or large-scale projects.
