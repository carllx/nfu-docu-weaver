00:00:00,170 --> 00:00:01,010
- [Instructor] In this video,

2
00:00:01,010 --> 00:00:03,640
I will show you how we can use shapekey

3
00:00:03,640 --> 00:00:06,790
to be creative with our animation

4
00:00:06,790 --> 00:00:10,170
and generate additional
effect on top of it.

5
00:00:10,170 --> 00:00:12,550
I will publish a free tutorial on YouTube

6
00:00:12,550 --> 00:00:16,870
on how to create the effects
of the current final animation,

7
00:00:16,870 --> 00:00:19,282
but you will find the
link in the documentation.

8
00:00:19,282 --> 00:00:22,830
Shapekeys allow you to deform an object

9
00:00:22,830 --> 00:00:24,310
into another shape.

10
00:00:24,310 --> 00:00:27,890
They are also known as
morph target or blendshapes

11
00:00:27,890 --> 00:00:31,400
in Maya or ZBrush, for example.

12
00:00:31,400 --> 00:00:35,320
Shapekeys are often used
to create facial expression

13
00:00:35,320 --> 00:00:39,350
for your character that
can be triggered later on.

14
00:00:39,350 --> 00:00:42,420
It's great to create
advanced facial expression

15
00:00:42,420 --> 00:00:44,870
or quick test for your character.

16
00:00:44,870 --> 00:00:47,120
Then the rigger can create controllers

17
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:49,960
so that you can trigger
those shapekeys at will

18
00:00:49,960 --> 00:00:51,581
in your animation.

19
00:00:51,581 --> 00:00:53,420
(air whooshing)

20
00:00:53,420 --> 00:00:57,110
shapekeys are a modification
or a transformation

21
00:00:57,110 --> 00:00:58,200
of the mesh,

22
00:00:58,200 --> 00:01:02,400
so you will be able to
find the shapekeys panel

23
00:01:02,400 --> 00:01:05,860
into the mesh data of your object.

24
00:01:05,860 --> 00:01:10,380
To create a shapekey, we simply
need to click the plus icon

25
00:01:10,380 --> 00:01:11,367
on the right of the panel.

26
00:01:11,367 --> 00:01:13,760
The first shapekey to be created

27
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:17,120
will be automatically named basis.

28
00:01:17,120 --> 00:01:21,410
It's some kind of snapshot
of the current position

29
00:01:21,410 --> 00:01:24,340
of each vertices in your mesh.

30
00:01:24,340 --> 00:01:28,700
Whenever we jump into edit
mode with a vertex selected,

31
00:01:28,700 --> 00:01:30,420
in the properties panel

32
00:01:30,420 --> 00:01:34,040
we can see the current
location of this vertex.

33
00:01:34,040 --> 00:01:38,300
The basis shapekey will record
the position of each vertex

34
00:01:38,300 --> 00:01:42,170
for our mesh, and this
specific basis shapekey

35
00:01:42,170 --> 00:01:46,050
is going to be the point of
reference for the next shapekey.

36
00:01:46,050 --> 00:01:49,840
It's a bit like the rest
pose for a character rig.

37
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:52,190
From there, we can create another shapekey

38
00:01:52,190 --> 00:01:53,770
by clicking the plus button.

39
00:01:53,770 --> 00:01:56,773
And now render is no longer
naming the shapekey basis,

40
00:01:57,630 --> 00:01:59,320
but key number one.

41
00:01:59,320 --> 00:02:02,000
Now, to be able to animate this shapekey,

42
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,850
we need to create a first deformation.

43
00:02:04,850 --> 00:02:06,380
You need to be in edit mode,

44
00:02:06,380 --> 00:02:09,550
and the most important
thing is to make sure that

45
00:02:09,550 --> 00:02:12,210
the key is currently selected.

46
00:02:12,210 --> 00:02:14,700
To select it, you just
need to left click it

47
00:02:14,700 --> 00:02:16,180
and it will be highlighted.

48
00:02:16,180 --> 00:02:19,150
From there, I can move one
of the vertices of my mesh.

49
00:02:19,150 --> 00:02:22,010
You can move as many vertices as you want.

50
00:02:22,010 --> 00:02:25,490
And as soon as I will press
tap to exit edit mode,

51
00:02:25,490 --> 00:02:28,190
my mesh will return to the shape it had

52
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:30,580
on the basis shapekey.

53
00:02:30,580 --> 00:02:33,150
From there, I can activate my shapekey

54
00:02:33,150 --> 00:02:37,010
by simply increasing the
value of key number one

55
00:02:37,010 --> 00:02:38,410
from zero to one.

56
00:02:38,410 --> 00:02:41,477
Blender will automatically
interpolate the shapekey;

57
00:02:42,540 --> 00:02:45,740
one being the shapekey
we have currently built,

58
00:02:45,740 --> 00:02:47,540
zero being the basis.

59
00:02:47,540 --> 00:02:49,830
To understand how shapekeys work,

60
00:02:49,830 --> 00:02:51,410
I will create a new shapekey,

61
00:02:51,410 --> 00:02:52,970
then I will enter edit mode,

62
00:02:52,970 --> 00:02:55,400
and I will rotate my whole character.

63
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:57,650
Note that you can rename your shapekeys

64
00:02:57,650 --> 00:02:59,360
as any other data in Blender

65
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:01,660
by simply double-clicking its name.

66
00:03:01,660 --> 00:03:04,870
As we have rotated our object in edit mode

67
00:03:04,870 --> 00:03:06,700
by triggering the shapekey,

68
00:03:06,700 --> 00:03:09,130
I'm expecting it to rotate in space,

69
00:03:09,130 --> 00:03:11,943
exactly as I'm doing here in object mode.

70
00:03:12,850 --> 00:03:14,340
I'm going back onto my model,

71
00:03:14,340 --> 00:03:16,130
and I will trigger the shapekey.

72
00:03:16,130 --> 00:03:18,810
What's going on here is that it seems that

73
00:03:18,810 --> 00:03:20,760
my object is getting scaled

74
00:03:20,760 --> 00:03:22,810
while I'm triggering the shapekey,

75
00:03:22,810 --> 00:03:24,660
but this is not the case.

76
00:03:24,660 --> 00:03:27,330
This is currently how shapekeys work,

77
00:03:27,330 --> 00:03:29,260
and to better understand it,

78
00:03:29,260 --> 00:03:31,610
I've tracked one of the vertices,

79
00:03:31,610 --> 00:03:34,120
parenting a small sphere to this vertex.

80
00:03:34,120 --> 00:03:37,370
If you carefully focus on this vertex,

81
00:03:37,370 --> 00:03:41,740
you will see that it moves
in a straight line in space,

82
00:03:41,740 --> 00:03:46,500
and this is because a vertex
only have location coordinates,

83
00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:50,650
and Blender will simply move each vertices

84
00:03:50,650 --> 00:03:55,650
in a straight line from
their original basis position

85
00:03:56,040 --> 00:03:58,550
toward the key frame position

86
00:03:58,550 --> 00:04:02,040
over the key frame values
that goes from zero to one,

87
00:04:02,040 --> 00:04:06,220
so you can't perform a proper
rotation using shapekey.

88
00:04:06,220 --> 00:04:11,220
You can only perform translation
of individual vertices.

89
00:04:11,250 --> 00:04:15,510
So even if the final output
looks a bit like a rotation,

90
00:04:15,510 --> 00:04:17,560
this is not a rotation.

91
00:04:17,560 --> 00:04:20,830
Each vertex is moving in a linear fashion

92
00:04:20,830 --> 00:04:25,313
from its current basis position
to the shapekey position.

93
00:04:25,313 --> 00:04:26,146
(air whooshing)

94
00:04:26,146 --> 00:04:29,680
Now, to better understand
shapekeys extrapolation

95
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:31,070
and their behavior,

96
00:04:31,070 --> 00:04:33,800
I have created this arrow shape,

97
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:37,340
and I will create the basis
shapekey and a first key.

98
00:04:37,340 --> 00:04:39,970
From there, I will jump into edit mode,

99
00:04:39,970 --> 00:04:42,680
and, with my shapekey number one selected,

100
00:04:42,680 --> 00:04:45,000
I will move by one Blender unit

101
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,910
the top vertices of the arrow.

102
00:04:46,910 --> 00:04:49,690
Now, when I trigger my shapekey,

103
00:04:49,690 --> 00:04:53,220
those vertices will
move in a linear fashion

104
00:04:53,220 --> 00:04:56,150
by one Blender unit on the Z-axis.

105
00:04:56,150 --> 00:05:00,440
But since the shapekey occurs
at the mesh data level,

106
00:05:00,440 --> 00:05:04,960
I can rotate my data container, my object,

107
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:05,793
and trigger the shapekey.

108
00:05:05,793 --> 00:05:09,610
and the shapekey will behave as expected.

109
00:05:09,610 --> 00:05:13,720
Now, if we have a closer look
to our shapekey's information,

110
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:16,087
we have a minimum range
and a maximum range.

111
00:05:16,087 --> 00:05:19,780
This will allow us to
either clamp or increase

112
00:05:19,780 --> 00:05:22,270
the interpolation range of the shapekey.

113
00:05:22,270 --> 00:05:25,270
If I count the maximum value to 0.5,

114
00:05:25,270 --> 00:05:27,320
I won't be able to go further.

115
00:05:27,320 --> 00:05:29,737
If I now allow a maximum value of two,

116
00:05:29,737 --> 00:05:32,610
the vertices of the arrow's head

117
00:05:32,610 --> 00:05:35,180
will move two times further away

118
00:05:35,180 --> 00:05:36,390
in a linear fashion.

119
00:05:36,390 --> 00:05:38,970
If I allow a negative minimum range,

120
00:05:38,970 --> 00:05:42,610
I will be able to extrapolate
the current shapekey

121
00:05:42,610 --> 00:05:46,435
backward or negatively, and
the vertices will just move

122
00:05:46,435 --> 00:05:47,900
the opposite direction.

123
00:05:47,900 --> 00:05:51,070
You can combine as many
shapekeys as you want,

124
00:05:51,070 --> 00:05:53,100
and this is how we generally create

125
00:05:53,100 --> 00:05:55,290
complex facial expression.

126
00:05:55,290 --> 00:05:58,520
I have created a couple
of additional shapekeys,

127
00:05:58,520 --> 00:06:02,090
and now I can trigger all the
shapekeys at the same time

128
00:06:02,090 --> 00:06:04,370
or combine different values.

129
00:06:04,370 --> 00:06:07,420
The coordinate modification
of each vertices

130
00:06:07,420 --> 00:06:10,050
will be added one on top of each other,

131
00:06:10,050 --> 00:06:13,200
based on the factor of each shapekey.

132
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:14,900
If you need to edit your mesh,

133
00:06:14,900 --> 00:06:18,980
make sure that you have
selected the basis shapekey,

134
00:06:18,980 --> 00:06:21,660
or you will be editing
the current shapekey,

135
00:06:21,660 --> 00:06:22,830
not the basis.

136
00:06:22,830 --> 00:06:24,510
We can use vertex group

137
00:06:24,510 --> 00:06:26,920
to limit the influence of a shapekey.

138
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:28,490
In the vertex group panel,

139
00:06:28,490 --> 00:06:30,450
I will create a new group,

140
00:06:30,450 --> 00:06:33,250
and I will assign at 100%

141
00:06:33,250 --> 00:06:35,000
the tip of the arrow,

142
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:38,930
and with a value of 50%,
the base of the arrow.

143
00:06:38,930 --> 00:06:42,930
Now, if I assign this vertex
group to the first shapekey

144
00:06:42,930 --> 00:06:45,630
by selecting it in the vertex group slot,

145
00:06:45,630 --> 00:06:48,150
and I now trigger the shapekey,

146
00:06:48,150 --> 00:06:51,320
you can see that the tip
of the arrow is moving

147
00:06:51,320 --> 00:06:52,900
at its full range,

148
00:06:52,900 --> 00:06:57,350
while the other vertices only
move by 50% of their range.

149
00:06:57,350 --> 00:06:59,350
If I now select one of the vertex

150
00:06:59,350 --> 00:07:03,150
and I exclude it by removing
it from the vertex group,

151
00:07:03,150 --> 00:07:04,520
it will no longer move.

152
00:07:04,520 --> 00:07:07,230
The vertex group value directly influence

153
00:07:07,230 --> 00:07:09,950
the amount of the shapekey motions

154
00:07:09,950 --> 00:07:12,100
that will be applied to each vertex.

155
00:07:12,100 --> 00:07:16,230
Finally, you can use other
shapekeys as a basis.

156
00:07:16,230 --> 00:07:18,910
This way you can create
complex transformation

157
00:07:18,910 --> 00:07:20,420
by changing the point of reference.

158
00:07:20,420 --> 00:07:21,830
(air whooshing)

159
00:07:21,830 --> 00:07:25,080
So let's now have a
look on what we could do

160
00:07:25,080 --> 00:07:28,870
with those shapekeys onto
our current animation.

161
00:07:28,870 --> 00:07:32,730
I will hide the background
and effects collection,

162
00:07:32,730 --> 00:07:35,010
so that we have a clearer viewport,

163
00:07:35,010 --> 00:07:38,510
and I will directly select
my character object.

164
00:07:38,510 --> 00:07:42,010
But since the character
was linked into this scene,

165
00:07:42,010 --> 00:07:44,900
I can't modify any of the mesh data.

166
00:07:44,900 --> 00:07:47,340
To be able to edit those data,

167
00:07:47,340 --> 00:07:49,570
I need to make the mesh local,

168
00:07:49,570 --> 00:07:53,170
and also the object of
the character local.

169
00:07:53,170 --> 00:07:55,940
With both the container
and its data local,

170
00:07:55,940 --> 00:07:58,490
I can now add a new shapekey.

171
00:07:58,490 --> 00:08:02,110
Since we will directly be
editing our character model,

172
00:08:02,110 --> 00:08:06,510
I can hide the rig, and I will
scrub through the animation,

173
00:08:06,510 --> 00:08:08,700
and I will try to spot the moment

174
00:08:08,700 --> 00:08:11,120
where the character is moving very fast,

175
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:13,470
like this hook motion, for example,

176
00:08:13,470 --> 00:08:16,320
I've already created smears using the rig,

177
00:08:16,320 --> 00:08:19,793
but now I can add extra
details using shapekeys.

178
00:08:21,210 --> 00:08:24,110
Clicking the plus button,
I will add a new shapekey.

179
00:08:24,110 --> 00:08:26,390
I will call it hook zero one,

180
00:08:26,390 --> 00:08:28,130
and I will jump into edit mode,

181
00:08:28,130 --> 00:08:29,410
pressing the tab key.

182
00:08:29,410 --> 00:08:33,260
To be able to see your
character posed in edit mode,

183
00:08:33,260 --> 00:08:36,090
make sure to enable all the display option

184
00:08:36,090 --> 00:08:38,150
in the armature modifier.

185
00:08:38,150 --> 00:08:40,860
From there, with my shapekey selected,

186
00:08:40,860 --> 00:08:43,120
I can start editing my character.

187
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:45,420
The process is simply to pull

188
00:08:45,420 --> 00:08:48,200
some of the vertices of the character

189
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:50,480
toward its previous position,

190
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:53,280
as if part of his mesh was dragging

191
00:08:53,280 --> 00:08:54,930
during this quick motion.

192
00:08:54,930 --> 00:08:58,750
I need to disable the X
symmetry while in edit mode,

193
00:08:58,750 --> 00:09:01,410
and now I can pull some
of the vertices back,

194
00:09:01,410 --> 00:09:03,353
and start to create my effect.

195
00:09:04,300 --> 00:09:08,260
The important thing is that
those effect will be seen

196
00:09:08,260 --> 00:09:09,880
from the camera view,

197
00:09:09,880 --> 00:09:13,670
so it's important to make them
work from the camera view.

198
00:09:13,670 --> 00:09:18,150
You can sure edit your mesh
from any point of view you want,

199
00:09:18,150 --> 00:09:20,800
but make sure that it does look good

200
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:23,040
from your camera point of view

201
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:25,160
as it is what is going to be rendered.

202
00:09:25,160 --> 00:09:27,370
If you want to create broader shapes

203
00:09:27,370 --> 00:09:29,600
or move multiple vertices at once,

204
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:32,340
you can enable the editing fall off.

205
00:09:32,340 --> 00:09:35,160
Once you are done with
your first shapekey,

206
00:09:35,160 --> 00:09:37,270
you can exit edit mode,

207
00:09:37,270 --> 00:09:39,700
and trigger it by changing its value.

208
00:09:39,700 --> 00:09:41,580
As seen in chapter two,

209
00:09:41,580 --> 00:09:45,570
shapekeys, as most
Blender data, can be keyed

210
00:09:45,570 --> 00:09:48,300
by pressing I over the keyframe value.

211
00:09:48,300 --> 00:09:51,230
Then I can edit this value whenever I want

212
00:09:51,230 --> 00:09:52,650
over my animation.

213
00:09:52,650 --> 00:09:56,800
This will activate or
deactivate the current shapekey,

214
00:09:56,800 --> 00:10:00,660
or, if you change the
value over multiple frames,

215
00:10:00,660 --> 00:10:03,980
Blender will interpolate
the value of the shapekeys.

216
00:10:03,980 --> 00:10:05,920
For example, in the previous frame,

217
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:08,170
I can add a bit of the shapekey

218
00:10:08,170 --> 00:10:10,730
to initiate this transformation

219
00:10:10,730 --> 00:10:13,260
and set it to zero on the previous key.

220
00:10:13,260 --> 00:10:15,860
Once you're happy with your first effect,

221
00:10:15,860 --> 00:10:17,650
you can add more of them.

222
00:10:17,650 --> 00:10:19,313
When working on a shot like that,

223
00:10:19,313 --> 00:10:23,140
that this is going to be the
final touch, the final effect.

224
00:10:23,140 --> 00:10:26,230
So I advise you to create
multiple shapekeys.

225
00:10:26,230 --> 00:10:30,720
For example, here, I want to
add few details on the arm too.

226
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:33,470
I will create a dedicated shapekey

227
00:10:33,470 --> 00:10:37,095
instead of adding it on the
same shapekey as before.

228
00:10:37,095 --> 00:10:39,750
This way, it's gonna be
easier for me to edit

229
00:10:39,750 --> 00:10:43,300
whether the shapekey
of the arm or the head

230
00:10:43,300 --> 00:10:45,890
delay one compared to the other,

231
00:10:45,890 --> 00:10:48,630
or simply remove it without destroying

232
00:10:48,630 --> 00:10:50,190
what I've done for the head.

233
00:10:50,190 --> 00:10:53,280
Or you will also be able
to show different version

234
00:10:53,280 --> 00:10:55,510
to your art director, for example.

235
00:10:55,510 --> 00:10:58,260
In my case, I've also created a shapekey

236
00:10:58,260 --> 00:11:00,370
during the kick impact

237
00:11:00,370 --> 00:11:02,910
to try to blend with the previous shape.

238
00:11:02,910 --> 00:11:06,380
This kind of effect on
top of the smear effect

239
00:11:06,380 --> 00:11:08,220
will fake motion blur,

240
00:11:08,220 --> 00:11:11,940
and will help your audience
to better read your animation.

241
00:11:11,940 --> 00:11:14,560
And, as explained in the previous video,

242
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:19,490
whatever you do to improve the
readability of your animation

243
00:11:19,490 --> 00:11:21,040
will take it to the next level.

244
00:11:21,968 --> 00:11:26,912
(bag slamming)
(man grunting)
