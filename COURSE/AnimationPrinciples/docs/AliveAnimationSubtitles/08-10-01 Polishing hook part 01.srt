1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:02,714
- We will now start to polish the hook.

2
00:00:02,714 --> 00:00:05,450
And, as usual, I will
start with the center

3
00:00:05,450 --> 00:00:09,150
of gravity of my character
using the torso root controller.

4
00:00:09,150 --> 00:00:11,350
Our goal during the punching stage

5
00:00:11,350 --> 00:00:13,890
is to better sell or communicate

6
00:00:13,890 --> 00:00:16,200
what we have blocked out before.

7
00:00:16,200 --> 00:00:19,290
We need to bring as much
impact into the hook

8
00:00:19,290 --> 00:00:21,100
as possible and make sure

9
00:00:21,100 --> 00:00:24,450
that all our body mechanics are correct.

10
00:00:24,450 --> 00:00:27,910
As our character is recovering
from the right cross,

11
00:00:27,910 --> 00:00:31,510
there is a weight transfer
onto the right foot.

12
00:00:31,510 --> 00:00:34,680
I need to move the center
of gravity of the character

13
00:00:34,680 --> 00:00:36,470
toward the right leg.

14
00:00:36,470 --> 00:00:39,000
His weight will be supported
onto the right foot,

15
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,416
and he will be able to move the left foot

16
00:00:41,416 --> 00:00:43,810
toward the next step.

17
00:00:43,810 --> 00:00:47,860
So I've lowered the value
of the X location curve

18
00:00:47,860 --> 00:00:50,600
until frame 31 as the character

19
00:00:50,600 --> 00:00:53,030
is making a step with the left foot.

20
00:00:53,030 --> 00:00:55,670
And once the left foot is in contact,

21
00:00:55,670 --> 00:00:58,870
I can transfer the weight
onto the left foot.

22
00:00:58,870 --> 00:01:01,020
Now, working with the Z curve,

23
00:01:01,020 --> 00:01:05,060
my goal is to create a
nice arch that will go down

24
00:01:05,060 --> 00:01:08,020
as the weight shifts toward the left leg.

25
00:01:08,020 --> 00:01:10,680
And then the character will raise a bit.

26
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:12,020
When we watch the curve,

27
00:01:12,020 --> 00:01:14,490
we can clearly see the weight shifting

28
00:01:14,490 --> 00:01:18,445
toward the right foot
between frame 28 and 13,

29
00:01:18,445 --> 00:01:23,445
and then transitioning onto
the left foot until frame 38.

30
00:01:24,630 --> 00:01:27,030
While the character is
traveling to the left,

31
00:01:27,030 --> 00:01:30,560
the value of the X location is raising,

32
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:33,000
he's lowering his center of gravity,

33
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,870
so the value of the Z curve is going down

34
00:01:35,870 --> 00:01:39,620
and stabilize just before
this little drop here.

35
00:01:39,620 --> 00:01:43,000
This drop in the Z curve over two frames

36
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,330
is micro-anticipation.

37
00:01:45,330 --> 00:01:48,700
On the timing, my character is easing

38
00:01:48,700 --> 00:01:51,490
into the anticipation on frame 42.

39
00:01:51,490 --> 00:01:56,460
And then, from frame 42 to
frame 45, is releasing the hook.

40
00:01:56,460 --> 00:02:01,460
Using this kind of moving hold
from frame 32 to frame 42,

41
00:02:01,494 --> 00:02:05,910
we have created a long and slow
anticipation into the hook.

42
00:02:05,910 --> 00:02:07,660
To break this anticipation

43
00:02:07,660 --> 00:02:10,318
and bring even more contrast to the hook,

44
00:02:10,318 --> 00:02:13,450
I will insert a key frame on frame 40,

45
00:02:13,450 --> 00:02:17,410
and then I will push the
anticipation pause on frame 42,

46
00:02:17,410 --> 00:02:20,390
meaning that I will lower
the center of gravity.

47
00:02:20,390 --> 00:02:24,570
And I will also rework a
bit the Y location curve

48
00:02:24,570 --> 00:02:27,470
so that the character is
pushing a bit backward.

49
00:02:27,470 --> 00:02:31,660
Basically, I am pushing the
curves the opposite direction

50
00:02:31,660 --> 00:02:34,330
than during the hook motion.

51
00:02:34,330 --> 00:02:38,200
This little extra anticipation
over one or two frame

52
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:42,090
is called a micro-anticipation
and it's used a lot

53
00:02:42,090 --> 00:02:45,160
in cartoonish animation or game animation.

54
00:02:45,160 --> 00:02:48,480
From there, I will be working
on the Y location curve

55
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:50,270
of the center of gravity.

56
00:02:50,270 --> 00:02:53,340
Here, I'm slightly
pushing the character back

57
00:02:53,340 --> 00:02:56,530
so that the left foot is not
supporting too much weight

58
00:02:56,530 --> 00:03:00,150
and can be raised and pushed
forward into the next step.

59
00:03:00,150 --> 00:03:02,650
Once it hits its contact point,

60
00:03:02,650 --> 00:03:05,780
I can shift the weight
onto this current foot.

61
00:03:05,780 --> 00:03:08,670
Then I will ease backwards
for the moving hold

62
00:03:08,670 --> 00:03:11,900
of the anticipation until frame 40.

63
00:03:11,900 --> 00:03:16,070
And from frame 40 to 42, I will
push the character backward

64
00:03:16,070 --> 00:03:20,980
a little faster so that we do
create the micro-anticipation

65
00:03:20,980 --> 00:03:23,450
we were talking about just before.

66
00:03:23,450 --> 00:03:26,180
During the hook motion,
I will tweak the curves

67
00:03:26,180 --> 00:03:27,570
frame by frame.

68
00:03:27,570 --> 00:03:29,650
Whenever we have a very fast motion,

69
00:03:29,650 --> 00:03:32,920
we have a lot of changes into
the pose of the character.

70
00:03:32,920 --> 00:03:36,330
That's pretty common to animate on ones,

71
00:03:36,330 --> 00:03:38,950
meaning that you will add a key frame

72
00:03:38,950 --> 00:03:43,380
or insert a key frame, every
frame, every one frame.

73
00:03:43,380 --> 00:03:46,240
In this case, I'm just
watching the arcs made

74
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:49,787
by the motion path of the center
of gravity of my character

75
00:03:49,787 --> 00:03:52,216
and I'm just pushing the different curve

76
00:03:52,216 --> 00:03:55,200
so that it creates a nicer arc.

77
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:57,600
I have the pretty squared angle.

78
00:03:57,600 --> 00:04:00,580
Here, I'm just curving it into a C shape.

79
00:04:00,580 --> 00:04:04,003
From there, I will slightly
rework the X location curve

80
00:04:04,003 --> 00:04:08,270
so that the character
transition into the other shoot

81
00:04:08,270 --> 00:04:12,320
a little faster between
frame 46 and frame 48.

82
00:04:12,320 --> 00:04:14,470
Since we are the very detailed blocking

83
00:04:14,470 --> 00:04:16,410
of this parts of the animation,

84
00:04:16,410 --> 00:04:18,540
the polishing stage in this case

85
00:04:18,540 --> 00:04:21,230
is really about refining the arcs

86
00:04:21,230 --> 00:04:25,410
and the speed of the motion
over a couple of frames.

87
00:04:25,410 --> 00:04:28,740
I will repeat myself again,
but the more detailed

88
00:04:28,740 --> 00:04:31,690
is your blocking, the easier and faster

89
00:04:31,690 --> 00:04:35,300
will be your splining and polishing stage.

90
00:04:35,300 --> 00:04:38,300
As usual, once I'm done
with the location curve,

91
00:04:38,300 --> 00:04:40,520
I switch to the rotation curves.

92
00:04:40,520 --> 00:04:43,360
My goal as usual is to
bring contrast to the motion

93
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:45,800
so, generally, when
you switch to splining,

94
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:48,810
your curve will be smoothed
out, which is normal.

95
00:04:48,810 --> 00:04:50,580
Your job from there is to favorize

96
00:04:50,580 --> 00:04:53,230
whether the previous pose or the next one.

97
00:04:53,230 --> 00:04:55,480
Prior to the hook, I
will make the body drag.

98
00:04:55,480 --> 00:04:57,820
So when the character is going down,

99
00:04:57,820 --> 00:05:00,380
I will raise the upper part of the body

100
00:05:00,380 --> 00:05:02,900
by pushing the X rotation curve down.

101
00:05:02,900 --> 00:05:06,500
And then as you dive into the
anticipation for the hook,

102
00:05:06,500 --> 00:05:08,300
I will push the curve up.

103
00:05:08,300 --> 00:05:10,600
So, basically, I've created a drag

104
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:12,560
and then a slight over shoot,

105
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:15,080
and they will do the same
with the twisting motion.

106
00:05:15,080 --> 00:05:17,360
As he goes toward the anticipation,

107
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:20,905
I will make the upper
body dragging by pushing

108
00:05:20,905 --> 00:05:22,130
the Z quaternion curve down.

109
00:05:22,130 --> 00:05:25,720
And then, as his weight is
shifting upon his left foot

110
00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:28,560
and easing through
anticipation for the hook,

111
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:31,180
I will push the Z quaternion curve up

112
00:05:31,180 --> 00:05:34,470
and they will do the same
with the Y quaternion curve.

113
00:05:34,470 --> 00:05:37,230
Again, your job is not to know by heart

114
00:05:37,230 --> 00:05:40,860
which curve does what, but
what the body should do.

115
00:05:40,860 --> 00:05:44,880
In this case, I want to drag
while I'm switching stance.

116
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:47,440
And once I've reached the new stance,

117
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:49,446
I want to push the anticipation.

118
00:05:49,446 --> 00:05:52,350
So I need to figure out
which curve does what

119
00:05:52,350 --> 00:05:55,260
by just clicking them and
watching my character.

120
00:05:55,260 --> 00:05:57,150
When I moved the Z quaternion curve,

121
00:05:57,150 --> 00:06:00,190
I can see that the torso of
my character is twisting,

122
00:06:00,190 --> 00:06:01,810
so I will work on that curve

123
00:06:01,810 --> 00:06:04,230
for this specific part on the animation.

124
00:06:04,230 --> 00:06:07,620
And since I want to put the
micro-anticipation as before,

125
00:06:07,620 --> 00:06:09,510
between frame 14 and 42,

126
00:06:09,510 --> 00:06:12,090
I will slightly erase
the Z quaternion curve,

127
00:06:12,090 --> 00:06:15,050
which make the character
twisting his body.

128
00:06:15,050 --> 00:06:18,210
Then we have this huge
drop into the curves

129
00:06:18,210 --> 00:06:21,190
that generate the twist
the opposite direction

130
00:06:21,190 --> 00:06:22,700
to perform the hook.

131
00:06:22,700 --> 00:06:25,760
What I will do from there is
create a slight over shoot

132
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:29,490
by rotating the Z
quaternion curve angle down.

133
00:06:29,490 --> 00:06:31,800
This way, the torso will
continue rotating a bit

134
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:34,060
just after the character hit the bag.

135
00:06:34,060 --> 00:06:36,480
This will bring more weight to the motion,

136
00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:39,320
while if we were to rotate
the body the opposite way,

137
00:06:39,320 --> 00:06:42,500
just after the hit, it
will make a bounce motion

138
00:06:42,500 --> 00:06:46,500
that will be perfect for a
light punch or a bouncing ball.

139
00:06:46,500 --> 00:06:49,410
Again, since we had a
very detailed blocking,

140
00:06:49,410 --> 00:06:51,170
pushing those curve is pretty easy

141
00:06:51,170 --> 00:06:53,768
and I'm not really modifying their shape,

142
00:06:53,768 --> 00:06:56,450
but just choosing
whether to push them down

143
00:06:56,450 --> 00:06:57,283
or push them up a bit

144
00:06:57,283 --> 00:07:01,370
to favorize the previews our next pose.

145
00:07:01,370 --> 00:07:03,900
For example, on the X rotation curve here,

146
00:07:03,900 --> 00:07:06,650
I'm pushing it down a
bit so I'm favorizing

147
00:07:06,650 --> 00:07:08,890
the previous pose where the character

148
00:07:08,890 --> 00:07:10,467
is leaning into the punch.

149
00:07:10,467 --> 00:07:13,625
And then, as he will be walking backward,

150
00:07:13,625 --> 00:07:16,190
I will push the curve a little up

151
00:07:16,190 --> 00:07:18,293
so that the body is dragging forward.
