- [Instructor] Welcome to chapter eight.

2
00:00:03,350 --> 00:00:04,710
In this chapter,

3
00:00:04,710 --> 00:00:08,380
we will apply everything
we have learned so far

4
00:00:08,380 --> 00:00:12,670
to create this 4 Hit Combo animation.

5
00:00:12,670 --> 00:00:16,380
I will give you my best
advice to find good references

6
00:00:16,380 --> 00:00:19,750
whenever you're starting
this animation process.

7
00:00:19,750 --> 00:00:22,040
And I will also teach you some tricks

8
00:00:22,040 --> 00:00:26,290
on how to use those reference
to plan your animation.

9
00:00:26,290 --> 00:00:28,470
Then as we did in the previous chapter,

10
00:00:28,470 --> 00:00:30,330
we'll go into the analysis

11
00:00:30,330 --> 00:00:33,230
of the different poses
we are going to build.

12
00:00:33,230 --> 00:00:37,060
From there, I will guide you
through the whole process

13
00:00:37,060 --> 00:00:39,790
of creating this kind of animation

14
00:00:39,790 --> 00:00:43,370
from the base blocking,
breakdown to creation,

15
00:00:43,370 --> 00:00:46,120
and first pass of timing, blocking plus

16
00:00:46,120 --> 00:00:47,930
adding even more poses

17
00:00:47,930 --> 00:00:52,340
so that our animation is
perfectly readable in steady mode

18
00:00:52,340 --> 00:00:56,770
to polishing our animation
and take it to the next level.

19
00:00:56,770 --> 00:00:58,740
But this is a big chapter

20
00:00:58,740 --> 00:01:03,000
and you should expect 10
to 20 hours of animation

21
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,630
to get to this result.

22
00:01:04,630 --> 00:01:07,180
So stay strong, don't be afraid to fail

23
00:01:07,180 --> 00:01:08,970
and let's get started.

24
00:01:08,970 --> 00:01:11,553
