00:00:01,150 --> 00:00:04,310
- [Pierre] In this video, we
will start animating the feet

2
00:00:04,310 --> 00:00:07,730
based on the root of the torso motion.

3
00:00:07,730 --> 00:00:08,740
The first thing to do

4
00:00:08,740 --> 00:00:13,450
is to double the length of
the motion we just created.

5
00:00:13,450 --> 00:00:16,520
And we need to repeat
this up and down cycle.

6
00:00:16,520 --> 00:00:19,160
With all my curve controllers selected,

7
00:00:19,160 --> 00:00:20,570
I will duplicate them.

8
00:00:20,570 --> 00:00:23,600
But first, make sure that
the very first controller

9
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:26,120
and the very last are exactly the same.

10
00:00:26,120 --> 00:00:27,860
Then press Shift + D to duplicate

11
00:00:27,860 --> 00:00:30,800
and offset by the length
of your animation.

12
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:33,350
In my case, 36 frames.

13
00:00:33,350 --> 00:00:38,110
So that my whole cycle
run through 72 frames.

14
00:00:38,110 --> 00:00:42,030
Again, this is the rhythm I
have chosen for this animation.

15
00:00:42,030 --> 00:00:45,240
Your animation can be faster or slower.

16
00:00:45,240 --> 00:00:49,060
From there, I will press Alt
+ H to un-hide my controller,

17
00:00:49,060 --> 00:00:51,880
select the visibility property bone

18
00:00:51,880 --> 00:00:54,480
and they will re-enable the legs.

19
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:58,500
Since the legs are using an
inverse kinematic mechanism,

20
00:00:58,500 --> 00:01:01,740
we will just have to
animate the foot controller.

21
00:01:01,740 --> 00:01:04,000
The cool thing with this animation method

22
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:08,050
is that it's easy to tweak
the position of any controller

23
00:01:08,050 --> 00:01:10,440
by slightly offsetting the curves.

24
00:01:10,440 --> 00:01:13,890
If I want to raise the up and
down motion of the character,

25
00:01:13,890 --> 00:01:16,770
I just need to select the root controller

26
00:01:16,770 --> 00:01:18,820
and offset the whole curve

27
00:01:18,820 --> 00:01:21,370
on the y-axis in the graph editor.

28
00:01:21,370 --> 00:01:23,940
The up and down motion will occur higher,

29
00:01:23,940 --> 00:01:26,830
giving more space for the foot motion.

30
00:01:26,830 --> 00:01:30,030
But it doesn't matter, even
if it doesn't look good

31
00:01:30,030 --> 00:01:32,730
I will be able to get back onto this curve

32
00:01:32,730 --> 00:01:34,653
and offset it at will.

33
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:38,120
The first thing to do from there

34
00:01:38,120 --> 00:01:42,950
is to position our feet based
on the motion of the torso.

35
00:01:42,950 --> 00:01:45,160
Generally, the up pose,

36
00:01:45,160 --> 00:01:49,490
the moment where the torso
is at its highest point

37
00:01:49,490 --> 00:01:51,970
is close to the passing pose.

38
00:01:51,970 --> 00:01:54,350
It is generally slightly delayed.

39
00:01:54,350 --> 00:01:57,600
When the foot contacts the
ground, the torso goes down.

40
00:01:57,600 --> 00:02:02,480
And when the foot is pulling
back, the torso is raising.

41
00:02:02,480 --> 00:02:07,270
Since the torso is almost at
its highest point on frame 20,

42
00:02:07,270 --> 00:02:11,750
I will slightly move the
foot back on this frame.

43
00:02:11,750 --> 00:02:13,430
And on frame zero,

44
00:02:13,430 --> 00:02:17,030
whenever the torso is at its lowest point,

45
00:02:17,030 --> 00:02:19,420
I will push the foot forward.

46
00:02:19,420 --> 00:02:22,410
The idea is not to get 100% accurate

47
00:02:22,410 --> 00:02:24,370
but just create a few landmark

48
00:02:24,370 --> 00:02:27,690
before we use the curve
and adjust the rhythm.

49
00:02:27,690 --> 00:02:31,550
Finally, the foot will be
third or away on the back

50
00:02:31,550 --> 00:02:35,550
whenever we have just hit the down pose.

51
00:02:35,550 --> 00:02:39,340
And then when the character
is pushing on the other leg,

52
00:02:39,340 --> 00:02:41,790
the current foot will be raising.

53
00:02:41,790 --> 00:02:44,880
The idea here is to work only on one axis

54
00:02:44,880 --> 00:02:47,100
as we did for the torso,

55
00:02:47,100 --> 00:02:49,080
setting the position of the foot

56
00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:51,700
just before it leaves the ground.

57
00:02:51,700 --> 00:02:54,130
Finally, I need to find the moment

58
00:02:54,130 --> 00:02:57,260
where this foot will get back forward,

59
00:02:57,260 --> 00:03:01,810
and this should have happen
just before the body is falling.

60
00:03:01,810 --> 00:03:03,610
The foot contact the ground

61
00:03:03,610 --> 00:03:07,420
and then we have the
down pose of the torso.

62
00:03:07,420 --> 00:03:10,170
Our animation doesn't look pretty at all

63
00:03:10,170 --> 00:03:13,110
but at least we have the main landmarks.

64
00:03:13,110 --> 00:03:17,070
Since the forward motion of
the foot will be mostly linear,

65
00:03:17,070 --> 00:03:20,800
I will select all the
key frames of the foot,

66
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:25,090
press V and change the
handle type to vector.

67
00:03:25,090 --> 00:03:28,150
As we did before with
our squirrel character,

68
00:03:28,150 --> 00:03:31,150
we will consider the cycle to be linear,

69
00:03:31,150 --> 00:03:35,440
meaning that the character is
moving at a constant speed.

70
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:40,440
Hence, I can remove the
key frame prior to key 33,

71
00:03:40,690 --> 00:03:42,960
because we just need to key frame,

72
00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:45,860
one starting point and one and point

73
00:03:45,860 --> 00:03:48,560
to create this linear motion.

74
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:50,330
Let's switch to the graph editor.

75
00:03:50,330 --> 00:03:54,830
To get the right pace of
the foot when on the ground,

76
00:03:54,830 --> 00:03:59,830
I need to interpolate from
frame 60 back to frame 33

77
00:04:01,030 --> 00:04:03,000
through the whole cycle.

78
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:07,680
Because frame 59 or 60 mark the moment

79
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:10,870
our character is
contacting with the ground,

80
00:04:10,870 --> 00:04:15,720
while frame 33 is the moment
the foot is leaving the ground.

81
00:04:15,720 --> 00:04:18,020
So this plateau is not correct

82
00:04:18,020 --> 00:04:22,680
nor the interpolation between
frame zero and frame 33.

83
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:25,260
But what I can do or what I should do,

84
00:04:25,260 --> 00:04:27,610
because I've made a slight mistake,

85
00:04:27,610 --> 00:04:32,610
is to duplicate the key
from frame 34 on frame 105,

86
00:04:34,950 --> 00:04:39,390
which stand for frame
72, the end of the cycle,

87
00:04:39,390 --> 00:04:41,440
plus frame 33.

88
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:45,660
This way, between frame 60 and frame 105,

89
00:04:45,660 --> 00:04:50,660
I have the whole motion of the
foot sticking to the ground

90
00:04:50,750 --> 00:04:52,870
with the right interpolation.

91
00:04:52,870 --> 00:04:57,490
From there, I can go on frame
72, the end of the cycle,

92
00:04:57,490 --> 00:05:00,070
and insert a key frame on this channel.

93
00:05:00,070 --> 00:05:02,960
I can now duplicate to this key frame

94
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:05,400
and move it on frame zero

95
00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:08,850
and set both to free or to vector.

96
00:05:08,850 --> 00:05:12,980
Now, both the first and
last key frame are the same

97
00:05:12,980 --> 00:05:16,038
and they have the right interpolation

98
00:05:16,038 --> 00:05:20,270
and the foot is moving at the
right speed on the ground.

99
00:05:20,270 --> 00:05:24,490
Now I just need to work
on the up and down motion

100
00:05:24,490 --> 00:05:28,140
between frame 33 and frame 60.

101
00:05:28,140 --> 00:05:30,510
We can also adjust the moment

102
00:05:30,510 --> 00:05:32,140
the foot is leaving the ground,

103
00:05:32,140 --> 00:05:35,480
I think it could happen a little later.

104
00:05:35,480 --> 00:05:39,240
Now that we know how to
fix the interpolation

105
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:41,850
between the beginning and
the end of the motion,

106
00:05:41,850 --> 00:05:43,530
that's perfectly fine.

107
00:05:43,530 --> 00:05:45,310
The other thing to consider

108
00:05:45,310 --> 00:05:48,980
is that while the foot has
linear or motion on the ground,

109
00:05:48,980 --> 00:05:52,320
it won't have linear motion in the air.

110
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:54,040
By rotating this handle,

111
00:05:54,040 --> 00:05:57,000
I will create a slight overshoot backward

112
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:00,500
as if the foot was projected the backward

113
00:06:00,500 --> 00:06:04,380
because of its inertia
when leaving the ground.

114
00:06:04,380 --> 00:06:06,280
With this row editing done,

115
00:06:06,280 --> 00:06:09,090
I will switch to the Z location curve

116
00:06:09,090 --> 00:06:12,440
and they will simply add a new key frame

117
00:06:12,440 --> 00:06:16,130
between the landing pose,
between the contacting pose

118
00:06:16,130 --> 00:06:18,750
and the pose where the
foot is leaving the ground.

119
00:06:18,750 --> 00:06:21,530
As usual, you can see here the final curve

120
00:06:21,530 --> 00:06:24,480
for both the Y and Z axis.

121
00:06:24,480 --> 00:06:29,480
As I did for the torso, to get
a satisfying sense of weight,

122
00:06:29,900 --> 00:06:33,940
I will make a slight
plateau or moving halt

123
00:06:33,940 --> 00:06:36,890
just before the foot hit the ground,

124
00:06:36,890 --> 00:06:41,760
so that it will have some
kind of a hard time to raise.

125
00:06:41,760 --> 00:06:46,070
It will stay up before
landing very quickly

126
00:06:46,070 --> 00:06:48,140
because it's very heavy

127
00:06:48,140 --> 00:06:52,000
and the robot is kind
of releasing the foot.

128
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:56,580
So it creates some kind of
nice contrast on the curve

129
00:06:56,580 --> 00:07:00,280
that currently translates
on the animation.

130
00:07:00,280 --> 00:07:02,830
The tricky thing about this method

131
00:07:02,830 --> 00:07:06,370
is to focus on one motion at a time.

132
00:07:06,370 --> 00:07:10,140
And here, you may find out
the motion looks a bit weird

133
00:07:10,140 --> 00:07:12,910
because there is no rotation in the foot.

134
00:07:12,910 --> 00:07:15,660
But we will input some
rotation in the foot

135
00:07:15,660 --> 00:07:17,610
slightly later on.

136
00:07:17,610 --> 00:07:20,220
Just focus on one channel at a time,

137
00:07:20,220 --> 00:07:22,280
one controller at a time.

138
00:07:22,280 --> 00:07:26,780
And even focus on the motion
of the controller itself.

139
00:07:26,780 --> 00:07:30,570
Not necessarily the
motion of the whole robot.

140
00:07:30,570 --> 00:07:32,700
As any other animation technique,

141
00:07:32,700 --> 00:07:35,940
it will take you a bit
of time to get used to it

142
00:07:35,940 --> 00:07:39,440
but it's very handy for
this kind of animation.

143
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:43,100
Before we call the base
motion of the foot down,

144
00:07:43,100 --> 00:07:46,880
I want to slightly push forward the foot

145
00:07:46,880 --> 00:07:48,630
just before it lands.

146
00:07:48,630 --> 00:07:51,260
To do so, I've slightly rotated the handle

147
00:07:51,260 --> 00:07:53,090
just before the contacting pose,

148
00:07:53,090 --> 00:07:56,790
so that the foot gets
a little more forward

149
00:07:56,790 --> 00:07:58,890
before it hits the ground.

150
00:07:58,890 --> 00:08:02,720
From there, I can adjust
the up motion of the foot.

151
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:06,740
Don't hesitate to track
the arcs of your animation

152
00:08:06,740 --> 00:08:11,340
using the motion path we have
seen in the previous chapter.

153
00:08:11,340 --> 00:08:12,870
In the next video,

154
00:08:12,870 --> 00:08:15,800
we will use the foot roll controller

155
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:20,373
to add a bit of rotation on the
ankle and on the whole foot.
