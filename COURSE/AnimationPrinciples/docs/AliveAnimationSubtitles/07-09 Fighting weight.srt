1
00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:01,910
- [Pierrick] There is one art pose

2
00:00:01,910 --> 00:00:04,380
I'd like to talk about and work on

3
00:00:04,380 --> 00:00:08,900
before we go into more
dynamic and spectacular poses.

4
00:00:08,900 --> 00:00:11,260
It's weight lifting poses.

5
00:00:11,260 --> 00:00:14,420
The weightlifting exercise
is a classic Funimation

6
00:00:14,420 --> 00:00:17,090
because it's very hard
and you learn a lot.

7
00:00:17,090 --> 00:00:18,390
We'll do the animation

8
00:00:18,390 --> 00:00:21,030
in the chapter I will publish later on.

9
00:00:21,030 --> 00:00:23,510
I've called this video of Fighting Weight

10
00:00:23,510 --> 00:00:26,260
because there is a lot of forces involved

11
00:00:26,260 --> 00:00:28,850
whenever you are trying to lift any weight

12
00:00:28,850 --> 00:00:33,060
or even your own body, and
we are here to fight gravity.

13
00:00:33,060 --> 00:00:36,960
And in a good fight, you need
to know your enemy, gravity.

14
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:39,320
So the first thing I will do as usual

15
00:00:39,320 --> 00:00:41,570
is to find the line of action.

16
00:00:41,570 --> 00:00:43,570
It's not that hard to find,

17
00:00:43,570 --> 00:00:46,270
I just have to follow the
spine of the character.

18
00:00:46,270 --> 00:00:49,890
One interesting detail here
is the position of the head.

19
00:00:49,890 --> 00:00:53,690
It seems that he's trying to
lift the weight with his head,

20
00:00:53,690 --> 00:00:56,940
so this is something we will
have to translate in our pose.

21
00:00:56,940 --> 00:00:58,440
Beyond the line of action,

22
00:00:58,440 --> 00:01:01,890
there is a very important
point to be identified here,

23
00:01:01,890 --> 00:01:04,200
and it's the center of gravity.

24
00:01:04,200 --> 00:01:06,740
And as soon as the weight
are leaving the ground,

25
00:01:06,740 --> 00:01:08,270
we have to consider them

26
00:01:08,270 --> 00:01:12,020
as being a part of the center
of gravity of the character.

27
00:01:12,020 --> 00:01:15,320
And they think we can
place the center of gravity

28
00:01:15,320 --> 00:01:17,070
in the middle of the weight,

29
00:01:17,070 --> 00:01:20,440
as they are way heavier
than the character.

30
00:01:20,440 --> 00:01:22,600
Now, our character purpose

31
00:01:22,600 --> 00:01:25,310
will be to pull the center of gravity

32
00:01:25,310 --> 00:01:27,430
in the straight line vertically.

33
00:01:27,430 --> 00:01:30,790
And everything in his
pose is meant to do this.

34
00:01:30,790 --> 00:01:35,460
Look how the arms and the
legs create a triangular shape

35
00:01:35,460 --> 00:01:37,770
that goes straight up.

36
00:01:37,770 --> 00:01:39,140
So we will have to make sure

37
00:01:39,140 --> 00:01:41,180
that we have this tension in the arms

38
00:01:41,180 --> 00:01:43,610
and the compression in the legs.

39
00:01:43,610 --> 00:01:47,440
As usual, I've drawn some
guidelines on top of the character

40
00:01:47,440 --> 00:01:48,890
to get a better vision

41
00:01:48,890 --> 00:01:52,300
of the orientation of the
different features of his body.

42
00:01:52,300 --> 00:01:55,510
In Blender, I will do as we
did in the previous video,

43
00:01:55,510 --> 00:01:58,740
I will switch to object
mode and hide the camera.

44
00:01:58,740 --> 00:02:02,490
Then I will select the weight
accessories I have created

45
00:02:02,490 --> 00:02:04,570
and I will place it in space.

46
00:02:04,570 --> 00:02:06,680
You will find the initial file

47
00:02:06,680 --> 00:02:09,490
with the object already placed in space.

48
00:02:09,490 --> 00:02:12,700
Since we will be only
posing the character,

49
00:02:12,700 --> 00:02:15,240
I won't be creating any interaction

50
00:02:15,240 --> 00:02:18,780
between our character rig
and the current object.

51
00:02:18,780 --> 00:02:21,880
We will see those mechanism
later in the course.

52
00:02:21,880 --> 00:02:23,520
In the meantime, as usual,

53
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:27,210
I can replace one of the 3D
view on the top right corner

54
00:02:27,210 --> 00:02:31,240
by the image editor and
open the reference picture.

55
00:02:31,240 --> 00:02:33,840
Then I will prepare on the character rig.

56
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:35,460
I will enter pose mode,

57
00:02:35,460 --> 00:02:39,000
and I will make sure that I add the sword.

58
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:42,300
Then in the action editor,
I will create a new action.

59
00:02:42,300 --> 00:02:45,500
You don't need to do so since
I'm providing you the file

60
00:02:45,500 --> 00:02:47,870
with the already created action.

61
00:02:47,870 --> 00:02:50,510
And before we start posing the character,

62
00:02:50,510 --> 00:02:54,520
I will switch the end mechanism
to inverse kinematics,

63
00:02:54,520 --> 00:02:58,100
since our character will be
in contact with the object.

64
00:02:58,100 --> 00:03:02,370
Exactly as did when we were
working on the baseball pose.

65
00:03:02,370 --> 00:03:03,203
This way,

66
00:03:03,203 --> 00:03:06,400
we will be able to position
the hands on the weight

67
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:10,530
and then work the pose
around the hand position.

68
00:03:10,530 --> 00:03:13,470
So let's start posing our character.

69
00:03:13,470 --> 00:03:16,570
I will try to position the hands properly.

70
00:03:16,570 --> 00:03:17,403
But first,

71
00:03:17,403 --> 00:03:20,610
I will lower the center of
gravity of the character,

72
00:03:20,610 --> 00:03:24,920
not of the whole pose, so that
the arms don't get stretched.

73
00:03:24,920 --> 00:03:27,780
But one important detail
on the hand pose here

74
00:03:27,780 --> 00:03:32,070
is that they are slightly
bending toward the outside.

75
00:03:32,070 --> 00:03:35,480
So this is a little detail we
will have to take into account

76
00:03:35,480 --> 00:03:38,700
whenever we are going to
polish a bit our pose.

77
00:03:38,700 --> 00:03:41,440
And I will slightly
rotate the hand controller

78
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:43,300
toward the outside right away.

79
00:03:43,300 --> 00:03:45,370
From there, I can press Control + C

80
00:03:45,370 --> 00:03:46,960
and then Control + Shift + V

81
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:49,560
to mirror the pose on the other hand.

82
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:52,340
You may remember that
in the previous videos,

83
00:03:52,340 --> 00:03:56,640
I've told you that we try to
break symmetry into a pose

84
00:03:56,640 --> 00:03:58,170
to avoid twinning.

85
00:03:58,170 --> 00:04:00,780
But one thing we have
seen regarding twinning

86
00:04:00,780 --> 00:04:05,780
is that it can communicate
stability and strength to a pose.

87
00:04:05,890 --> 00:04:08,340
And this is exactly what we need here.

88
00:04:08,340 --> 00:04:11,950
So this is a pose where we
will be able to use symmetry.

89
00:04:11,950 --> 00:04:13,750
As we did for the previous poses,

90
00:04:13,750 --> 00:04:17,250
I will first try to give
the right orientation

91
00:04:17,250 --> 00:04:19,670
to the center of gravity of my character.

92
00:04:19,670 --> 00:04:22,290
One key component of this pose

93
00:04:22,290 --> 00:04:26,600
is to have the sternum align
with the center of the weight.

94
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:28,300
Then I will go back and forth

95
00:04:28,300 --> 00:04:30,950
with the bending of the chest controller,

96
00:04:30,950 --> 00:04:34,110
the hips controller,
the head and the neck.

97
00:04:34,110 --> 00:04:36,830
Whenever you're pulling a heavy weight,

98
00:04:36,830 --> 00:04:39,920
your shoulders are pulled down,

99
00:04:39,920 --> 00:04:42,670
so you need to rotate
them toward the ground.

100
00:04:42,670 --> 00:04:45,310
Don't make the mistake
of raising the shoulders

101
00:04:45,310 --> 00:04:47,820
because the character is
trying to raise the weight.

102
00:04:47,820 --> 00:04:51,280
Don't think about what your
character is willing to do,

103
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:55,990
think about what forces are
involved against your character

104
00:04:55,990 --> 00:04:59,000
and it's fighting against those forces.

105
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,770
The feet will be aligned
with the metal bars

106
00:05:01,770 --> 00:05:03,450
that is holding the weights.

107
00:05:03,450 --> 00:05:05,030
Remember what we have seen

108
00:05:05,030 --> 00:05:07,160
when we have built our first pose,

109
00:05:07,160 --> 00:05:10,350
we try to get the center
of gravity to be aligned

110
00:05:10,350 --> 00:05:13,870
within the shape made
by the contacting point.

111
00:05:13,870 --> 00:05:16,899
So if you have only two contacting points,

112
00:05:16,899 --> 00:05:20,400
then the center of gravity must be aligned

113
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:22,470
between the two feet.

114
00:05:22,470 --> 00:05:25,750
Based on the knee position
on the reference picture,

115
00:05:25,750 --> 00:05:27,240
as I'm posing the character,

116
00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:29,570
I feel like the weights are too high.

117
00:05:29,570 --> 00:05:32,910
So, I will go back into object mode,

118
00:05:32,910 --> 00:05:37,430
I will select the weight object
and moving along the Z-axis.

119
00:05:37,430 --> 00:05:40,740
From there, I can rework
the hand position,

120
00:05:40,740 --> 00:05:43,400
the torso position and
the shoulder position.

121
00:05:43,400 --> 00:05:47,540
As usual, I will
progressively shape my pose

122
00:05:47,540 --> 00:05:51,010
by moving each controller one by one.

123
00:05:51,010 --> 00:05:54,650
But one of the most important
skill you need to develop

124
00:05:54,650 --> 00:05:58,380
whenever you opposing your
character is observation.

125
00:05:58,380 --> 00:06:00,690
Look at the position of the feet,

126
00:06:00,690 --> 00:06:02,950
they need to be under the bar.

127
00:06:02,950 --> 00:06:07,550
Look at the hips, the butt
is slightly bending backward.

128
00:06:07,550 --> 00:06:10,850
The sternum has to be aligned
with the center of gravity

129
00:06:10,850 --> 00:06:13,010
or the middle of the metal bar.

130
00:06:13,010 --> 00:06:15,260
The head is pulling the weight up

131
00:06:15,260 --> 00:06:17,390
as if it was leading the whole body.

132
00:06:17,390 --> 00:06:21,960
So whenever you are building
your pose, sometime just stop,

133
00:06:21,960 --> 00:06:23,790
watch the feet, watch the hand,

134
00:06:23,790 --> 00:06:26,070
watch the shoulder, watch the head,

135
00:06:26,070 --> 00:06:30,340
and watch their relationship
in space, their position.

136
00:06:30,340 --> 00:06:33,310
Observation, whether it's a pose right now

137
00:06:33,310 --> 00:06:35,810
or everything in your everyday life,

138
00:06:35,810 --> 00:06:40,810
will allow you to catch the
very truth in any motion.

139
00:06:40,820 --> 00:06:44,730
But most importantly, the
behavior or the purpose.

140
00:06:44,730 --> 00:06:48,660
Behavior, whether you're
working on a humanoid character,

141
00:06:48,660 --> 00:06:52,160
a creature, an animal, or even an object,

142
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:55,840
will bring personality to your character

143
00:06:55,840 --> 00:06:58,330
and personality will bring life to it.

144
00:06:58,330 --> 00:07:01,350
And this is the whole
purpose of this course,

145
00:07:01,350 --> 00:07:03,850
breathing life into our character.

146
00:07:03,850 --> 00:07:06,210
And to build a personality,

147
00:07:06,210 --> 00:07:09,770
you first need to get believability.

148
00:07:09,770 --> 00:07:12,200
This is why you need to observe

149
00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:16,180
and translate what you see
into a believable pose.

150
00:07:16,180 --> 00:07:20,440
And then you can push
it to input personality,

151
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:22,310
to make it more appealing.

152
00:07:22,310 --> 00:07:26,200
And if people can connect
to something they know

153
00:07:26,200 --> 00:07:29,210
or something they feel they
know into your character,

154
00:07:29,210 --> 00:07:31,250
it will become real to them.

155
00:07:31,250 --> 00:07:35,260
And so, you will be breathing
life into your character.

156
00:07:35,260 --> 00:07:36,180
Back to the posing,

157
00:07:36,180 --> 00:07:38,330
don't forget to look at your elbows

158
00:07:38,330 --> 00:07:40,500
and the overall arm orientation.

159
00:07:40,500 --> 00:07:42,550
And as I feel the left arm is okay,

160
00:07:42,550 --> 00:07:44,580
I will just copy and paste the pose

161
00:07:44,580 --> 00:07:46,210
on the other pole targets.

162
00:07:46,210 --> 00:07:48,667
Then I will go back into object mode

163
00:07:48,667 --> 00:07:50,900
and I will set up the camera.

164
00:07:50,900 --> 00:07:54,620
So I will give it back a horizontal format

165
00:07:54,620 --> 00:07:55,770
by changing the size.

166
00:07:55,770 --> 00:07:59,570
On the reference picture,
there is almost no perspective.

167
00:07:59,570 --> 00:08:02,740
So we can keep a long focal length.

168
00:08:02,740 --> 00:08:04,590
19 millimeters is okay.

169
00:08:04,590 --> 00:08:09,140
And since we can barely see
the top part of the feet,

170
00:08:09,140 --> 00:08:13,030
it means that the camera is
just above the feet level,

171
00:08:13,030 --> 00:08:15,270
maybe the middle of the shin level.

172
00:08:15,270 --> 00:08:19,480
So, I'm moving and rotating the
camera from the camera view.

173
00:08:19,480 --> 00:08:21,400
Choosing its local axis,

174
00:08:21,400 --> 00:08:23,527
as we have seen in the previous videos.

175
00:08:23,527 --> 00:08:25,420
Having this new point of view

176
00:08:25,420 --> 00:08:29,140
does help me to see some
of the mistakes I've made.

177
00:08:29,140 --> 00:08:31,480
I need to raise a bit my character

178
00:08:31,480 --> 00:08:35,240
and slightly rotate the hips inward.

179
00:08:35,240 --> 00:08:37,540
One of the issue I have with my character

180
00:08:37,540 --> 00:08:39,300
is the shape of the butt.

181
00:08:39,300 --> 00:08:42,580
Fortunately, if you
enable the leg tweaker,

182
00:08:42,580 --> 00:08:45,240
you should be able to find some controller

183
00:08:45,240 --> 00:08:48,010
that allow you to reshape a bit the butt.

184
00:08:48,010 --> 00:08:49,830
So I will lower them a bit

185
00:08:49,830 --> 00:08:53,030
and rotate them a bit
inward to reshape the back.

186
00:08:53,030 --> 00:08:56,950
Another thing I did have some
difficulties to get right

187
00:08:56,950 --> 00:08:59,240
is the shape of the head and the neck.

188
00:08:59,240 --> 00:09:01,620
As my character is the bit skinnier

189
00:09:01,620 --> 00:09:03,430
compared to the reference,

190
00:09:03,430 --> 00:09:07,360
and don't forget that the
rig has also its limitation,

191
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:09,410
I will be able to get a better shape

192
00:09:09,410 --> 00:09:12,110
by simply pushing the head inward.

193
00:09:12,110 --> 00:09:15,600
I feel like it makes a
huge different in the pose.

194
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:20,150
We do feel like the neck is
pushed with blood pressure.

195
00:09:20,150 --> 00:09:23,820
Finally, I will use some of
the tweaker inside the foot

196
00:09:23,820 --> 00:09:25,480
to flatten the foot,

197
00:09:25,480 --> 00:09:28,620
as if there was a lot
of weight on top of them

198
00:09:28,620 --> 00:09:30,060
and it flattened them.

199
00:09:30,060 --> 00:09:32,380
One interesting thing on the reference,

200
00:09:32,380 --> 00:09:33,950
it's the shape of the shoes.

201
00:09:33,950 --> 00:09:37,090
It seems that there is something
to raise a bit the heel.

202
00:09:37,090 --> 00:09:39,100
It's probably to keep balance,

203
00:09:39,100 --> 00:09:42,040
avoiding the foot to get absolutely flat

204
00:09:42,040 --> 00:09:43,480
and falling backward.

205
00:09:43,480 --> 00:09:45,020
Regarding the hand pose,

206
00:09:45,020 --> 00:09:49,000
I start with the pinky because
he does a very special shape

207
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,880
whenever I'm looking at the reference.

208
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:53,760
It feels like it's not totally closed,

209
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:57,080
that the first joint is
not rotated that much.

210
00:09:57,080 --> 00:09:58,430
Another thing that I'm doing

211
00:09:58,430 --> 00:10:01,620
is that I will slightly scale each finger

212
00:10:01,620 --> 00:10:04,800
using the first joint

213
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:07,580
and scaling them on their local X-axis.

214
00:10:07,580 --> 00:10:12,070
And they will also do this
on some of the pan builds.

215
00:10:12,070 --> 00:10:16,300
With the weight and the
pressure applied upon the hands

216
00:10:16,300 --> 00:10:20,620
and the fingers, they are
squashed against the metal

217
00:10:20,620 --> 00:10:22,690
and it makes them looking larger.

218
00:10:22,690 --> 00:10:25,250
So whenever you are posing the hands,

219
00:10:25,250 --> 00:10:28,250
while you should favorize rotation,

220
00:10:28,250 --> 00:10:30,550
don't forget that you can scale the bone,

221
00:10:30,550 --> 00:10:32,910
you can move them also in space.

222
00:10:32,910 --> 00:10:36,040
The important thing as
usual is what we see.

223
00:10:36,040 --> 00:10:39,410
So use the whole range of
transformation you have

224
00:10:39,410 --> 00:10:41,370
to get where you want to be.

225
00:10:41,370 --> 00:10:43,190
Once you're happy with your end pose,

226
00:10:43,190 --> 00:10:45,950
select all the bones in the hand

227
00:10:45,950 --> 00:10:48,640
and mirror the pose onto the other hand.

228
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:51,840
While posing, I did feel like
the weight were a bit too big,

229
00:10:51,840 --> 00:10:53,610
so I've scaled them down.

230
00:10:53,610 --> 00:10:55,870
From there, I did some minor tweaking

231
00:10:55,870 --> 00:10:57,480
on the pose of the character.

232
00:10:57,480 --> 00:11:00,060
But I just wanted to
straighten a bit the legs

233
00:11:00,060 --> 00:11:03,290
since they are a bit angling backward.

234
00:11:03,290 --> 00:11:06,394
While I wasn't able to
perfectly match the pose,

235
00:11:06,394 --> 00:11:07,640
it feels a little better

236
00:11:07,640 --> 00:11:10,820
with the legs slightly bent forward.

237
00:11:10,820 --> 00:11:14,660
But as a final touch, you can
enable the face controller

238
00:11:14,660 --> 00:11:17,460
and create a slightly angry face.

239
00:11:17,460 --> 00:11:20,360
And I feel like we can
call this pose done.

240
00:11:20,360 --> 00:11:22,580
It's time to push the pose.

241
00:11:22,580 --> 00:11:24,900
And it was a little harder than usual

242
00:11:24,900 --> 00:11:28,510
because we generally
amplify the line of action.

243
00:11:28,510 --> 00:11:31,320
We often elongate the arcs

244
00:11:31,320 --> 00:11:34,343
to amplify the motion
or the sense of motion.

245
00:11:34,343 --> 00:11:36,520
And the first thing I was thinking of

246
00:11:36,520 --> 00:11:38,180
was to raise the character.

247
00:11:38,180 --> 00:11:42,470
But in the end, what we want
to communicate here is weight,

248
00:11:42,470 --> 00:11:46,180
the fact that our character
is pulled toward the ground.

249
00:11:46,180 --> 00:11:50,700
So what I did instead was to
compress the line of action.

250
00:11:50,700 --> 00:11:52,440
I've shortened the torso,

251
00:11:52,440 --> 00:11:54,880
I've made arm as straight as possible

252
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:56,590
using the tweaker bones.

253
00:11:56,590 --> 00:12:00,010
And since I wanted my
character to be squashed,

254
00:12:00,010 --> 00:12:04,360
I've scaled up most of the
parts of the character,

255
00:12:04,360 --> 00:12:07,860
but only to make them larger, not longer.

256
00:12:07,860 --> 00:12:10,420
So I'm inflating the torso.

257
00:12:10,420 --> 00:12:13,530
I will do the same with
the thigh, with the chest,

258
00:12:13,530 --> 00:12:17,830
using the tweaker controllers
available upon the whole rig.

259
00:12:17,830 --> 00:12:21,880
Increasing the thigh volume
better sells the effort,

260
00:12:21,880 --> 00:12:25,210
and we feel like the
character is going to explode.

261
00:12:25,210 --> 00:12:28,480
But I've also slightly inflated the neck.

262
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:31,170
And since I've built a bit of a face pose

263
00:12:31,170 --> 00:12:34,950
on the previous pose,
I've decided to push it.

264
00:12:34,950 --> 00:12:38,620
So I will enable the
tweaker bone of the face

265
00:12:38,620 --> 00:12:41,090
and I will raise a bit a lower lids

266
00:12:41,090 --> 00:12:43,130
and raise a bit the cheeks.

267
00:12:43,130 --> 00:12:45,930
This way, the whole body of our character,

268
00:12:45,930 --> 00:12:48,750
from the tip of the toes to the eyes,

269
00:12:48,750 --> 00:12:52,800
will communicate the fact that
he's pulling on this weight

270
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:54,380
as hard as he can.

271
00:12:54,380 --> 00:12:58,340
Again, as an animator, you
have to communicate something.

272
00:12:58,340 --> 00:12:59,810
I've built this rig

273
00:12:59,810 --> 00:13:03,120
so that we don't have
too many facial stuff

274
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:05,730
that are going to be distracting.

275
00:13:05,730 --> 00:13:08,610
But with those Spider-Man's like eyes,

276
00:13:08,610 --> 00:13:12,680
that will be a shame if we
don't try to shape them.

277
00:13:12,680 --> 00:13:15,460
And beyond that, this is another tool

278
00:13:15,460 --> 00:13:17,950
to sell the pose we
are currently building.

279
00:13:17,950 --> 00:13:19,957
From there, since I've
slightly moved the weight,

280
00:13:19,957 --> 00:13:23,010
I will go back into object
mode, select the weight,

281
00:13:23,010 --> 00:13:25,670
add a keyframe on its position

282
00:13:25,670 --> 00:13:28,101
and reposition it on the previous pose

283
00:13:28,101 --> 00:13:31,700
so that I can jump between the
two poses and compare them.

284
00:13:31,700 --> 00:13:35,300
And I feel like I can
call this posing done.

285
00:13:35,300 --> 00:13:39,750
While the difference between
the two poses are pretty subtle

286
00:13:39,750 --> 00:13:42,950
I feel like the new
pose better communicates

287
00:13:42,950 --> 00:13:47,760
the fact that our character
is trying to lift this weight.

288
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:49,833
So I'm pretty happy with the results.
