00:00:01,019 --> 00:00:01,980
- [Instructor] This is the last video

2
00:00:01,980 --> 00:00:04,590
to create the base motion of our robot

3
00:00:04,590 --> 00:00:07,640
where we will add some side to side motion

4
00:00:07,640 --> 00:00:10,960
to the torso and the
beat of hips rotation.

5
00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:13,300
So I'm starting with the root top.

6
00:00:13,300 --> 00:00:18,180
So controller selected and the
X location curve available.

7
00:00:18,180 --> 00:00:20,660
The motion is pretty simple.

8
00:00:20,660 --> 00:00:23,900
When the character is
raising one of its leg

9
00:00:23,900 --> 00:00:26,610
and putting its weight onto the other,

10
00:00:26,610 --> 00:00:29,180
its whole body will shift to towards

11
00:00:29,180 --> 00:00:31,630
the foots that is in
contact with the ground.

12
00:00:31,630 --> 00:00:34,530
So basically if we have
a look to the curve

13
00:00:34,530 --> 00:00:38,660
the weight will shift to
what the robot left side

14
00:00:38,660 --> 00:00:42,350
until frame 14 and which
is the passing pose

15
00:00:42,350 --> 00:00:46,360
where the right leg is in
the middle of the robot.

16
00:00:46,360 --> 00:00:51,360
On frame 14 to frame 22, the
body will slightly move back

17
00:00:51,450 --> 00:00:55,730
to the right by the
weight of the right foot.

18
00:00:55,730 --> 00:00:57,580
And we have an acceleration

19
00:00:57,580 --> 00:00:59,810
of the right foot contact the ground

20
00:00:59,810 --> 00:01:03,300
and the whole body is falling down.

21
00:01:03,300 --> 00:01:08,300
It's also shifting rapidly to
wild the new contacting foot

22
00:01:08,620 --> 00:01:12,380
transferring it's weight
onto it's right leg.

23
00:01:12,380 --> 00:01:15,110
Since we have a symmetrical cycle

24
00:01:15,110 --> 00:01:19,390
we can then reproduce this
motion in the other way.

25
00:01:19,390 --> 00:01:22,400
Again, there is not that much more to say

26
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:27,400
and to get this concept about
rhythm and weight shifting.

27
00:01:27,710 --> 00:01:30,660
It's just a matter of
playing with the curve

28
00:01:30,660 --> 00:01:34,400
to get the right momentum,
to get the right motion.

29
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:37,250
Then with this method,
the layer and method,

30
00:01:37,250 --> 00:01:41,200
just try to keep your
curves as clean as possible.

31
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:44,260
Not adding too much key frames

32
00:01:44,260 --> 00:01:48,290
especially if they are useless,
is that you can easily tweak

33
00:01:48,290 --> 00:01:51,240
and adjust those values later on.

34
00:01:51,240 --> 00:01:54,150
When you're happy with
the result, don't forget

35
00:01:54,150 --> 00:01:57,830
to align the very first
key and the very last

36
00:01:57,830 --> 00:02:00,300
so that you get a proper cycle.

37
00:02:00,300 --> 00:02:03,330
To create the rotation motion of the hips,

38
00:02:03,330 --> 00:02:05,250
I've used the same method.

39
00:02:05,250 --> 00:02:07,330
I've started from the front view

40
00:02:07,330 --> 00:02:10,800
working on the Y axis of the hips.

41
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:14,030
It's the left to right twisting motion.

42
00:02:14,030 --> 00:02:17,430
When you are putting
your weight onto one leg

43
00:02:17,430 --> 00:02:22,160
as you straighten this
leg, your hips will raise.

44
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:26,170
So the hips doesn't only react
to the weight of the body

45
00:02:26,170 --> 00:02:29,580
but also to the contact
of the foot on the ground.

46
00:02:29,580 --> 00:02:33,340
So we could think that they
are following the motion.

47
00:02:33,340 --> 00:02:36,020
But they also lead the animation

48
00:02:36,020 --> 00:02:39,780
since they are used to pull the foot up.

49
00:02:39,780 --> 00:02:41,800
When the robot would be on one foot

50
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:44,600
the hips will tilt towards this foot.

51
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:47,770
And as the opposite foot
will leave the ground,

52
00:02:47,770 --> 00:02:52,040
the hips will start rotating
towards the raising foot.

53
00:02:52,040 --> 00:02:56,910
But still farther raising
the foot on the ground.

54
00:02:56,910 --> 00:03:01,050
And as our robot character hit the ground

55
00:03:01,050 --> 00:03:06,050
with the opposite foot, then
the hips will rapidly shift

56
00:03:06,790 --> 00:03:11,210
to one, the foot that just enter
in contact with the ground.

57
00:03:11,210 --> 00:03:14,620
And what I did is that
I had a little bounce

58
00:03:14,620 --> 00:03:18,040
in the curve to create an hip shake

59
00:03:18,040 --> 00:03:22,990
that make our robot who came
more clunky and robotic.

60
00:03:22,990 --> 00:03:25,980
As we did before with the toes.

61
00:03:25,980 --> 00:03:27,520
When they was done with that,

62
00:03:27,520 --> 00:03:30,410
I worked on the rotation curve.

63
00:03:30,410 --> 00:03:32,750
I kept it very simple,

64
00:03:32,750 --> 00:03:35,960
just imaging the hips, pulling the foot.

65
00:03:35,960 --> 00:03:39,170
So when the right foot is forward

66
00:03:39,170 --> 00:03:42,319
and hit the ground into its contact pose,

67
00:03:42,319 --> 00:03:47,319
the hips controller is rotating
towards the other foot.

68
00:03:47,480 --> 00:03:52,030
And has reach it's extreme
pose a couple of frame before

69
00:03:52,030 --> 00:03:55,520
because it's leading the
animation, pulling the feet.

70
00:03:55,520 --> 00:04:00,090
So the hips rotate toward the
left to pull the right leg

71
00:04:00,090 --> 00:04:03,270
and as the right foot contact
the ground, the hips has

72
00:04:03,270 --> 00:04:07,250
already started rotating
the other way a little bit.

73
00:04:07,250 --> 00:04:10,020
The next video will be a short time-lapse

74
00:04:10,020 --> 00:04:11,440
showing you those steps.

75
00:04:11,440 --> 00:04:14,060
I've just explained if needed.

76
00:04:14,060 --> 00:04:17,480
And then we will see different techniques

77
00:04:17,480 --> 00:04:20,030
on all to use the base motion.

78
00:04:20,030 --> 00:04:22,630
We have created to add it

79
00:04:22,630 --> 00:04:25,643
to the different parts of the robot.
