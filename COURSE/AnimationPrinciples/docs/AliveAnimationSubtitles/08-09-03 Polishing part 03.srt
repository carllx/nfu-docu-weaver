1
00:00:00,110 --> 00:00:02,040
- [Narrator] So now let's polish the arms

2
00:00:02,040 --> 00:00:04,590
and the little details for the first chunk

3
00:00:04,590 --> 00:00:05,860
of this animation.

4
00:00:05,860 --> 00:00:08,370
But one thing I'd done
before publishing the arm

5
00:00:08,370 --> 00:00:10,980
is that I've input a bit of details

6
00:00:10,980 --> 00:00:13,860
into the toes of the right foot.

7
00:00:13,860 --> 00:00:16,900
So I'm not using the graph editor here,

8
00:00:16,900 --> 00:00:19,330
I'm just directly posing to camera.

9
00:00:19,330 --> 00:00:21,049
When the foot is moving forward,

10
00:00:21,049 --> 00:00:23,370
I'm making the toes dragging a bit

11
00:00:23,370 --> 00:00:25,900
as if they were sliding on the ground.

12
00:00:25,900 --> 00:00:27,770
I will later in the video,

13
00:00:27,770 --> 00:00:29,330
revise the rotation,

14
00:00:29,330 --> 00:00:32,580
timing of the foot as it rotates toward

15
00:00:32,580 --> 00:00:34,560
the pinch a bit too soon.

16
00:00:34,560 --> 00:00:36,480
I will offset it by a couple of frames

17
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:38,010
at the very end of the video.

18
00:00:38,010 --> 00:00:40,590
I will start by polishing the left arm

19
00:00:40,590 --> 00:00:43,010
and I won't be showing you my curves

20
00:00:43,010 --> 00:00:44,750
because it's not necessary.

21
00:00:44,750 --> 00:00:46,800
What's important is the process.

22
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:49,200
First I've tracked the elbow

23
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:52,600
by calculating the motion
path of the elbow tweaker.

24
00:00:52,600 --> 00:00:54,690
And now think of what's happening,

25
00:00:54,690 --> 00:00:56,460
the character is dropping down,

26
00:00:56,460 --> 00:00:58,500
so I want the shoulder to drag a bit.

27
00:00:58,500 --> 00:01:00,730
I want the shoulder to raise a bit

28
00:01:00,730 --> 00:01:02,570
when the character is fully.

29
00:01:02,570 --> 00:01:06,160
So I'm just spotting
which channel I can use,

30
00:01:06,160 --> 00:01:08,590
which is the extradition channel,

31
00:01:08,590 --> 00:01:10,740
and I just raise a bit the curve,

32
00:01:10,740 --> 00:01:12,830
so that it raise a bit the shoulder.

33
00:01:12,830 --> 00:01:14,520
Then I will do the same with the arm.

34
00:01:14,520 --> 00:01:16,400
I want the elbow to raise a bit

35
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:18,910
while the character is going down.

36
00:01:18,910 --> 00:01:21,248
And then for the next two frames,

37
00:01:21,248 --> 00:01:23,670
I will fix the pose of the arm

38
00:01:23,670 --> 00:01:27,820
so that it doesn't cover
that much the face anymore.

39
00:01:27,820 --> 00:01:31,360
I will push a bit the forearm forward

40
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:33,920
and check out my camera view

41
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:36,747
to make sure that I see
the eyes of the character.

42
00:01:37,738 --> 00:01:41,620
So while we may rely a
lot on the graph editor,

43
00:01:41,620 --> 00:01:44,210
for the root motion of the character,

44
00:01:44,210 --> 00:01:48,163
because it's super
important and it reads well,

45
00:01:49,232 --> 00:01:50,870
whenever I'm polishing the arms

46
00:01:50,870 --> 00:01:53,330
or the knees or stuff like that,

47
00:01:53,330 --> 00:01:56,050
I'm just tracking the arcs on screen.

48
00:01:56,050 --> 00:01:58,770
The graph editor does make sense to me,

49
00:01:58,770 --> 00:02:00,890
but you don't need to

50
00:02:00,890 --> 00:02:04,410
perfectly understand everything about it,

51
00:02:04,410 --> 00:02:06,920
to be clever about your choices.

52
00:02:06,920 --> 00:02:10,044
So now that I've fixed
the few initial pose,

53
00:02:10,044 --> 00:02:12,711
I will track the rest of my character,

54
00:02:12,711 --> 00:02:15,820
and it feels like it's popping too much.

55
00:02:15,820 --> 00:02:19,580
To double check that I will
simply select the wrist tweaker

56
00:02:19,580 --> 00:02:21,690
and calculate its motion path.

57
00:02:21,690 --> 00:02:23,910
So what I will do by working

58
00:02:23,910 --> 00:02:26,680
on the different controllers of the arm

59
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:29,160
and not really caring
about the graph editor,

60
00:02:29,160 --> 00:02:32,370
is to reduce the gap
between those two frame,

61
00:02:32,370 --> 00:02:34,420
especially the ups and down

62
00:02:34,420 --> 00:02:36,950
because it's breaking
the flow of the punch.

63
00:02:36,950 --> 00:02:40,140
So if we focus on the
shoulder of the character

64
00:02:40,140 --> 00:02:42,560
between frame 12 and frame 13,

65
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:45,080
there is a big gap of shape.

66
00:02:45,080 --> 00:02:47,970
On frame 12 the arm is overextended,

67
00:02:47,970 --> 00:02:49,720
and so does the shoulder

68
00:02:49,720 --> 00:02:52,280
while it's compressing on frame 13.

69
00:02:52,280 --> 00:02:56,850
So I can find some kind of
in-between shape on frame 13

70
00:02:56,850 --> 00:02:59,040
by moving a bit the shoulder,

71
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:00,210
moving a bit the arm,

72
00:03:00,210 --> 00:03:02,110
moving a bit the forearm

73
00:03:02,110 --> 00:03:06,460
and try to flatten a bit
the motion path of the fist.

74
00:03:06,460 --> 00:03:09,710
Again, I'm not relying on
the graph editor to do so.

75
00:03:09,710 --> 00:03:12,160
I tweak the pose through graph editor,

76
00:03:12,160 --> 00:03:14,360
but also directly in the 3D view.

77
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:17,952
Next, if we follow along
the tracking of the wrist,

78
00:03:17,952 --> 00:03:21,380
we can see that there is a arch angle here

79
00:03:21,380 --> 00:03:25,440
and the fist of the character
disappear on the next frame.

80
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:27,540
All of these from the camera view,

81
00:03:27,540 --> 00:03:29,150
not in our space.

82
00:03:29,150 --> 00:03:31,200
So what we can do to fix this

83
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:36,160
is that we can make the elbow
diving little more down.

84
00:03:36,160 --> 00:03:38,582
So I will slightly twist the arm

85
00:03:38,582 --> 00:03:42,630
so that I get more of
an angle with the hand.

86
00:03:42,630 --> 00:03:45,320
This way, I will be able later on

87
00:03:45,320 --> 00:03:49,710
to create a smear into a
C-shape from the camera view.

88
00:03:49,710 --> 00:03:51,170
Now in the next pose,

89
00:03:51,170 --> 00:03:54,831
I will try to show as
much elbow as possible

90
00:03:54,831 --> 00:03:57,490
so that the arms read well,

91
00:03:57,490 --> 00:04:01,690
and it will also extend the
current pose of the character.

92
00:04:01,690 --> 00:04:04,841
I'm sure checking my
character from all angle,

93
00:04:04,841 --> 00:04:06,870
I'm tweaking the pose,

94
00:04:06,870 --> 00:04:08,070
but as you can see,

95
00:04:08,070 --> 00:04:11,540
I don't work that much
directing to the graph editor.

96
00:04:11,540 --> 00:04:14,869
I work a lot directly on my character

97
00:04:14,869 --> 00:04:17,460
a little later on in the animation,

98
00:04:17,460 --> 00:04:19,770
same issue, same solution.

99
00:04:19,770 --> 00:04:23,450
Here you can see from
frame 19 to frame 22,

100
00:04:23,450 --> 00:04:25,580
I have a flat motion path.

101
00:04:25,580 --> 00:04:28,690
So it will be better if we add a nice arc.

102
00:04:28,690 --> 00:04:31,048
So the point here is not to know

103
00:04:31,048 --> 00:04:34,330
what all the curves are
doing into this motion,

104
00:04:34,330 --> 00:04:36,810
but choose the right curves

105
00:04:36,810 --> 00:04:39,287
that will help me to fix this issue.

106
00:04:39,287 --> 00:04:41,750
And if I take the arm controller

107
00:04:41,750 --> 00:04:45,137
and then just check each rotation channel,

108
00:04:45,137 --> 00:04:47,320
I will find one of the curve

109
00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:50,910
that I'll need to raise a bit the arm.

110
00:04:50,910 --> 00:04:53,230
They found the couple of curve

111
00:04:53,230 --> 00:04:55,300
that will all meet to rotate the arm

112
00:04:55,300 --> 00:04:57,840
the way I want from the camera view,

113
00:04:57,840 --> 00:05:00,690
I can tweak them to create the arcs.

114
00:05:00,690 --> 00:05:04,500
I will just regularly
update the motion path

115
00:05:04,500 --> 00:05:06,730
and you can see in a few seconds,

116
00:05:06,730 --> 00:05:08,520
I have fixed my issue,

117
00:05:08,520 --> 00:05:11,239
and this is why having
a super detailed booking

118
00:05:11,239 --> 00:05:15,020
before we switch to
spline was really helpful

119
00:05:15,020 --> 00:05:18,270
because now we can focus
on improving the animation

120
00:05:18,270 --> 00:05:21,372
in putting detail and
fixing the little arcs.

121
00:05:21,372 --> 00:05:22,205
(sound whooshing)

122
00:05:22,205 --> 00:05:23,500
As I fix the arcs,

123
00:05:23,500 --> 00:05:25,500
I have now a motion path

124
00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:27,940
I can full to bard my smears.

125
00:05:27,940 --> 00:05:31,250
I will enable the tweaker bone in the UI,

126
00:05:31,250 --> 00:05:33,530
and then they will jump
to the action editor.

127
00:05:33,530 --> 00:05:36,470
And I will make sure
that I have a key frame

128
00:05:36,470 --> 00:05:40,710
on all those controller on
the previous and next frame.

129
00:05:40,710 --> 00:05:42,310
Around the current frame,

130
00:05:42,310 --> 00:05:46,020
I want to build my
smear frame on this way,

131
00:05:46,020 --> 00:05:48,320
those tweaker bone won't interpolate,

132
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:53,010
since they are locked before
and after the current frame.

133
00:05:53,010 --> 00:05:55,280
Again, here, there is no magical trick,

134
00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:57,020
I'm just shaping the pose.

135
00:05:57,020 --> 00:05:59,912
So I am pushing, pulling
the different controllers

136
00:05:59,912 --> 00:06:03,660
until it creates a nice arc with the arm.

137
00:06:03,660 --> 00:06:06,560
I'm also breaking the wrist and rotating

138
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:10,350
the hand so that it's pointing
toward its previous position.

139
00:06:10,350 --> 00:06:12,190
Try to keep the current arch in the arm

140
00:06:12,190 --> 00:06:13,428
as smooth as possible

141
00:06:13,428 --> 00:06:17,400
and focus on what will be
seen from the camera view.

142
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:18,470
On the next frame,

143
00:06:18,470 --> 00:06:20,230
I will also try to cheat

144
00:06:20,230 --> 00:06:23,690
and show a part of the
left hand of the character

145
00:06:23,690 --> 00:06:24,930
in the camera view.

146
00:06:24,930 --> 00:06:27,170
Even if it's only on one frame,

147
00:06:27,170 --> 00:06:30,270
the fact that we don't
lose track of the hand

148
00:06:30,270 --> 00:06:32,970
will help reading the animation.

149
00:06:32,970 --> 00:06:35,690
Again here, there is no
graph editor involved.

150
00:06:35,690 --> 00:06:38,778
From there even if I don't
see it from the camera view,

151
00:06:38,778 --> 00:06:41,800
I am bulging the smear on the left arm.

152
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:46,080
Maybe I will have to present
this specific animation

153
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:47,870
from many angles.

154
00:06:47,870 --> 00:06:51,250
Maybe I will have to tweak
the position of the camera,

155
00:06:51,250 --> 00:06:53,483
both learning wise,

156
00:06:53,483 --> 00:06:55,870
and to prevent any rework later on,

157
00:06:55,870 --> 00:06:56,920
you should do this also.
(sound whooshing)

158
00:06:56,920 --> 00:07:00,040
I will speed up a bit the
video for the right arm,

159
00:07:00,040 --> 00:07:03,270
because in the beginning I'm
doing exactly the same thing.

160
00:07:03,270 --> 00:07:04,600
As the character drop,

161
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:05,822
I'm raising the shoulder,

162
00:07:05,822 --> 00:07:07,710
then from the camera view,

163
00:07:07,710 --> 00:07:11,280
I will be tracking first
the elbow of the character,

164
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:14,210
and I will try to create a nice arc.

165
00:07:14,210 --> 00:07:15,770
Also from camera view,

166
00:07:15,770 --> 00:07:19,513
I will try to show as much
of the right arm as possible.

167
00:07:20,700 --> 00:07:23,395
So I'm slightly offsetting the elbow

168
00:07:23,395 --> 00:07:27,080
so that it shows it's
not cut or overlapping

169
00:07:27,080 --> 00:07:28,620
with the chest of the character.

170
00:07:28,620 --> 00:07:32,325
From there, I will calculate
the motion path of the hand,

171
00:07:32,325 --> 00:07:35,590
and I feel like it's jiggling a bit here.

172
00:07:35,590 --> 00:07:38,110
You can see that the path is not clean.

173
00:07:38,110 --> 00:07:40,510
I have both a problem of spacing,

174
00:07:40,510 --> 00:07:43,210
and my arc is not clearly defined.

175
00:07:43,210 --> 00:07:45,240
I will manipulate the shoulder,

176
00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:48,900
the arm and the forearm
controller until I get it right.

177
00:07:48,900 --> 00:07:52,400
And at some point I will also recalculate

178
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:53,710
the arcs of the elbow.

179
00:07:53,710 --> 00:07:56,520
Since I'm modifying the
position of the arm,

180
00:07:56,520 --> 00:07:59,353
I may mess with the position of the elbow,

181
00:07:59,353 --> 00:08:00,510
the arc of the elbow,

182
00:08:00,510 --> 00:08:02,250
the spacing of the elbow.

183
00:08:02,250 --> 00:08:03,330
Once I was done,

184
00:08:03,330 --> 00:08:06,123
you can see that I have a clean arc,

185
00:08:06,123 --> 00:08:10,810
that is easing into frame 15
before he's throw the punch.

186
00:08:10,810 --> 00:08:13,470
From there, I was able to
work on the current spline.

187
00:08:13,470 --> 00:08:16,050
so when we have switched to spline,

188
00:08:16,050 --> 00:08:19,360
the right opened a lot around frame 16,

189
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:22,690
because of the forward kinematic mechanism

190
00:08:22,690 --> 00:08:26,630
and both pose wise animation
wise and boxing wise,

191
00:08:26,630 --> 00:08:28,330
this is not super efficient.

192
00:08:28,330 --> 00:08:31,540
And there, instead of using
the interpolation of the curve,

193
00:08:31,540 --> 00:08:34,650
I've decided to revert the current pose

194
00:08:34,650 --> 00:08:37,440
and I've boxing wise exaggerated it

195
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:38,700
using the tweaker bone.

196
00:08:38,700 --> 00:08:41,928
They're used to create
like a narrow with the arm

197
00:08:41,928 --> 00:08:44,330
that will bench into the bag.

198
00:08:44,330 --> 00:08:48,145
From there, I reworked
each frames of the punch,

199
00:08:48,145 --> 00:08:51,036
working on all the controllers of the arm

200
00:08:51,036 --> 00:08:54,440
to make sure that the
motion path of the punch

201
00:08:54,440 --> 00:08:56,890
was as straight as possible,

202
00:08:56,890 --> 00:08:59,622
and that the whole shape of the arm

203
00:08:59,622 --> 00:09:02,480
was following this motion path.

204
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:05,790
So even the small orientation of the wrist

205
00:09:05,790 --> 00:09:07,610
is important at this time.

206
00:09:07,610 --> 00:09:10,902
And then when the character
is pulling back his arm,

207
00:09:10,902 --> 00:09:13,870
the fist is currently falling down

208
00:09:13,870 --> 00:09:17,390
and it feels like the arm
is heavy for our character.

209
00:09:17,390 --> 00:09:20,000
While he's supposed to
be super bad bad-ass

210
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,260
so it doesn't fit.

211
00:09:21,260 --> 00:09:24,620
Instead of having the
wrist falling down forward,

212
00:09:24,620 --> 00:09:26,940
I reworked the shape of the arm,

213
00:09:26,940 --> 00:09:28,976
so that the elbow is leading.

214
00:09:28,976 --> 00:09:31,904
So I've made the elbow pointing down,

215
00:09:31,904 --> 00:09:34,500
So is that I can raise the wrist

216
00:09:34,500 --> 00:09:36,860
as if it was following through

217
00:09:36,860 --> 00:09:40,284
or overlapping instead
of leading the arm down.

218
00:09:40,284 --> 00:09:43,210
Those little details
will make the difference

219
00:09:43,210 --> 00:09:46,640
because they communicate a different idea.

220
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:50,740
The initial pose of our
character make him lose control.

221
00:09:50,740 --> 00:09:53,150
He feels weak and I don't like that.

222
00:09:53,150 --> 00:09:54,820
We don't want that.

223
00:09:54,820 --> 00:09:56,200
He's a bad-ass character,

224
00:09:56,200 --> 00:09:57,370
so everything he does,

225
00:09:57,370 --> 00:09:59,020
he does it with control.

226
00:09:59,020 --> 00:10:03,780
Why the previous animation
might be mechanically correct,

227
00:10:03,780 --> 00:10:05,690
communication wise it's wrong,

228
00:10:05,690 --> 00:10:09,361
because it doesn't communicate
what our character is about.

229
00:10:09,361 --> 00:10:12,430
And asking yourself this kind of question

230
00:10:12,430 --> 00:10:14,941
is not a matter of skill level.

231
00:10:14,941 --> 00:10:18,220
You might be struggling
with your mechanism

232
00:10:18,220 --> 00:10:19,790
or body mechanism,

233
00:10:19,790 --> 00:10:22,100
but you should beginner or not

234
00:10:22,100 --> 00:10:24,880
always ask yourself those questions.

235
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:27,720
Your animation might not be perfect,

236
00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:29,740
but if he does communicate

237
00:10:29,740 --> 00:10:32,500
the right information to your audience,

238
00:10:32,500 --> 00:10:34,610
then you're doing a better work

239
00:10:34,610 --> 00:10:36,665
than having a bad-ass motion,

240
00:10:36,665 --> 00:10:39,965
but nothing to say about your character.

241
00:10:39,965 --> 00:10:42,430
As explained in the
beginning of the video,

242
00:10:42,430 --> 00:10:45,670
the right foot was
rotating a bit too early,

243
00:10:45,670 --> 00:10:49,890
so I just offset its rotation
by a couple of frames.

244
00:10:49,890 --> 00:10:52,020
But once I was happy with the result,

245
00:10:52,020 --> 00:10:54,720
I've made a final pass of details

246
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:55,837
onto this chunk of the animation.

247
00:10:55,837 --> 00:10:58,420
(sound whooshing)

248
00:10:58,420 --> 00:11:01,590
I did a little pass on the fingers.

249
00:11:01,590 --> 00:11:03,430
I was originally planning

250
00:11:03,430 --> 00:11:06,185
to have my character with open hands

251
00:11:06,185 --> 00:11:09,770
most of the time during this animation,

252
00:11:09,770 --> 00:11:10,830
because in Muay Thai,

253
00:11:10,830 --> 00:11:14,200
it's more natural to have the hands open,

254
00:11:14,200 --> 00:11:16,320
to be able to catch our upend.

255
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:18,550
But I've chosen to close the fists

256
00:11:18,550 --> 00:11:20,490
because it will take forever

257
00:11:20,490 --> 00:11:23,020
to spline in polish those fingers.

258
00:11:23,020 --> 00:11:27,200
But while the educational
content would be super imitated,

259
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:31,114
the fingers are some hold
the limbs of the hand.

260
00:11:31,114 --> 00:11:33,720
So they need to move with pupils.

261
00:11:33,720 --> 00:11:36,830
They will help you to define
the shape of the hand,

262
00:11:36,830 --> 00:11:40,640
and they can also communicate
something about your character

263
00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:43,730
as seen in the posing hand chapter.

264
00:11:43,730 --> 00:11:47,323
What I've done here is that
as the hand is going down,

265
00:11:47,323 --> 00:11:51,996
I will the finger drug by
bending them a bit backward.

266
00:11:51,996 --> 00:11:54,893
And just before the fist closed,

267
00:11:55,932 --> 00:11:58,110
I have made the ultimate joint

268
00:11:58,110 --> 00:12:00,590
to bend backwards so that it feels

269
00:12:00,590 --> 00:12:04,200
like the fingers are snapping into a punch

270
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:07,010
more than they are crawling into a punch.

271
00:12:07,010 --> 00:12:09,850
It will make the punching even snap here

272
00:12:09,850 --> 00:12:11,100
to have the opposite hand

273
00:12:11,100 --> 00:12:13,283
to also have a snappy motion.
