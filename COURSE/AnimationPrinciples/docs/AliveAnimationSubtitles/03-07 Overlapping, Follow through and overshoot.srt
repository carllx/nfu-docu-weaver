00:00:00,450 --> 00:00:02,600
- [Instructor] Before we
start animating the squirrel,

2
00:00:02,600 --> 00:00:04,740
we need to talk about overlapping,

3
00:00:04,740 --> 00:00:07,170
follow through and overshoot.

4
00:00:07,170 --> 00:00:09,620
We talk about overlapping motion

5
00:00:09,620 --> 00:00:12,390
when a part of a moving object

6
00:00:12,390 --> 00:00:15,500
is delayed compared to
the rest of the object.

7
00:00:15,500 --> 00:00:18,100
So when we have a look
at the current animation,

8
00:00:18,100 --> 00:00:21,950
we can see that the ball
is leading the motion

9
00:00:21,950 --> 00:00:24,570
while the tail is trained to follow.

10
00:00:24,570 --> 00:00:26,640
If we track the tip of the tail,

11
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:29,460
we can see that its position is offset

12
00:00:29,460 --> 00:00:32,320
compared to the position of the ball.

13
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:36,620
This is something we will
use a lot for tails, clothes,

14
00:00:36,620 --> 00:00:39,680
whatever is hanging on our character,

15
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:42,580
but it can be used on
any part of the body,

16
00:00:42,580 --> 00:00:45,560
a relaxed arm on a walk cycle

17
00:00:45,560 --> 00:00:47,908
or even on this crab character,

18
00:00:47,908 --> 00:00:51,530
the eyes and the crab claws
are currently following

19
00:00:51,530 --> 00:00:53,930
the body motion with a slight delay

20
00:00:53,930 --> 00:00:56,750
so it's also an overlapping motion.

21
00:00:56,750 --> 00:00:59,980
We can also say that
those parts are dragging

22
00:00:59,980 --> 00:01:02,100
behind the body motion.

23
00:01:02,100 --> 00:01:05,762
A very important thing is
those overlapping motion

24
00:01:05,762 --> 00:01:09,470
will communicate weight and
stiffness of the material

25
00:01:09,470 --> 00:01:11,420
or the character you are animating.

26
00:01:11,420 --> 00:01:13,790
The more overlapping motion you will have,

27
00:01:13,790 --> 00:01:15,650
the heavier it will feel.

28
00:01:15,650 --> 00:01:17,660
The more overlapping motion you have,

29
00:01:17,660 --> 00:01:20,200
the smoother it will feel also.

30
00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:22,160
So it can also communicate

31
00:01:22,160 --> 00:01:25,400
if your character is relaxed or stressed.

32
00:01:25,400 --> 00:01:28,930
Follow through is a bit
like overlapping motion.

33
00:01:28,930 --> 00:01:33,230
It defines the fact that
some parts of our character

34
00:01:33,230 --> 00:01:36,040
are still moving after
the character stops,

35
00:01:36,040 --> 00:01:40,080
so their motion is offset
compared to the character.

36
00:01:40,080 --> 00:01:42,700
So basically an overlapping motion

37
00:01:42,700 --> 00:01:44,250
generates a follow through.

38
00:01:44,250 --> 00:01:47,460
And as explained before,
it will communicate

39
00:01:47,460 --> 00:01:50,770
the weight and stiffness
of your character.

40
00:01:50,770 --> 00:01:53,607
We generally use overshoot when a motion

41
00:01:53,607 --> 00:01:56,723
has a dramatical change in its orientation

42
00:01:56,723 --> 00:01:58,890
or when it's stopping.

43
00:01:58,890 --> 00:02:03,120
It's accelerating until
it reaches its destination

44
00:02:03,120 --> 00:02:05,720
and we can see that it's
going a little beyond

45
00:02:05,720 --> 00:02:08,720
its final position and get back.

46
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:11,360
And this is what we call an overshoot.

47
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:14,070
Curve wise, it's pretty easy to identify

48
00:02:14,070 --> 00:02:15,270
in the graph editor.

49
00:02:15,270 --> 00:02:18,490
We have those two key frames
that have the same value

50
00:02:18,490 --> 00:02:20,960
so they are aligned on the y-axis

51
00:02:20,960 --> 00:02:22,650
and we have an additional key frame

52
00:02:22,650 --> 00:02:25,800
that goes a little beyond this threshold

53
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:28,490
and create the overshoot motion.

54
00:02:28,490 --> 00:02:30,747
This is something we
are going to use a lot

55
00:02:30,747 --> 00:02:35,747
because it convey weight, but
also speed, impact, balance,

56
00:02:35,968 --> 00:02:37,740
a lot of things.

57
00:02:37,740 --> 00:02:41,090
It can be very interesting
for a punch, for example,

58
00:02:41,090 --> 00:02:44,740
or to give extra appeal to a fast motion.

59
00:02:44,740 --> 00:02:48,140
And when you combine overshoot
with overlapping motion

60
00:02:48,140 --> 00:02:52,200
or follow through, you can get
very interesting animations.

61
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:55,720
In this case, there is an
overshoot on the first punch

62
00:02:55,720 --> 00:02:59,320
and some overlapping
motion as the claws jiggle.

63
00:02:59,320 --> 00:03:01,930
Here, I just want to
show you a quick example

64
00:03:01,930 --> 00:03:03,520
on how you can build

65
00:03:03,520 --> 00:03:06,630
convincing overlapping motion very fast.

66
00:03:06,630 --> 00:03:08,310
When opening the blender file,

67
00:03:08,310 --> 00:03:12,350
you will be directly on the
action to do this exercise.

68
00:03:12,350 --> 00:03:14,640
With the first bone of the tail selected,

69
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:16,790
I will try to spot the frame

70
00:03:16,790 --> 00:03:19,840
where the ball is currently
moving the fastest

71
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:21,670
and it's frame 10.

72
00:03:21,670 --> 00:03:25,360
I will select the x
rotation curve of the tail,

73
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:28,970
duplicate the frame and
switch them to auto cleanse

74
00:03:28,970 --> 00:03:30,250
so that it's clean,

75
00:03:30,250 --> 00:03:32,100
and move the key value up

76
00:03:32,100 --> 00:03:34,680
so that the tail is dragging back.

77
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:37,870
Since the animation is
looping on 40 frame,

78
00:03:37,870 --> 00:03:40,370
there are great chance that on frame 30

79
00:03:40,370 --> 00:03:44,200
I get the fastest motion
of the ball the other way.

80
00:03:44,200 --> 00:03:46,350
So I will duplicate my current frame

81
00:03:46,350 --> 00:03:48,400
and move it on the negative side

82
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:51,070
so that the tail is
dragging the other way.

83
00:03:51,070 --> 00:03:53,750
Then as we are walking on a cycle,

84
00:03:53,750 --> 00:03:56,720
the first and the last key
frame must be the same,

85
00:03:56,720 --> 00:03:59,110
so I would press shift D it to duplicate

86
00:03:59,110 --> 00:04:01,020
and to make a proper blending,

87
00:04:01,020 --> 00:04:03,290
I need to rotate to those two key frame

88
00:04:03,290 --> 00:04:05,270
using individual origin

89
00:04:05,270 --> 00:04:07,600
to align the starting and ending point

90
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:09,940
with the current shape of the curve.

91
00:04:09,940 --> 00:04:12,990
Now to make it a little more
stylish and interesting,

92
00:04:12,990 --> 00:04:16,640
I will select those two extreme
and scale them up a bit.

93
00:04:16,640 --> 00:04:19,840
Since the overlapping motion is an offset

94
00:04:19,840 --> 00:04:21,290
of the current motion,

95
00:04:21,290 --> 00:04:23,640
I can select all the point of the curve

96
00:04:23,640 --> 00:04:26,040
and press control C to copy them.

97
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:29,610
Then I will select the next
tailbone in the hierarchy,

98
00:04:29,610 --> 00:04:34,290
make sure I only have the
x rotation curve selected

99
00:04:34,290 --> 00:04:37,500
and I will press control
V to paste the curve.

100
00:04:37,500 --> 00:04:40,230
Then to slightly offset the motion,

101
00:04:40,230 --> 00:04:43,380
I will press shift D to
duplicate the whole curve

102
00:04:43,380 --> 00:04:46,290
and move it before the frame zero.

103
00:04:46,290 --> 00:04:49,550
This way I have twice
exactly the same motion.

104
00:04:49,550 --> 00:04:52,430
And if I now move the whole curve

105
00:04:52,430 --> 00:04:57,430
by one or two frames to the
right so I'm delaying it,

106
00:04:57,760 --> 00:05:00,710
I will get a dragging motion for free.

107
00:05:00,710 --> 00:05:03,070
From there, I can copy this curve,

108
00:05:03,070 --> 00:05:08,070
select the next joint or the
next bone in the tail hierarchy

109
00:05:08,270 --> 00:05:10,180
and repeat the process.

110
00:05:10,180 --> 00:05:14,620
Select the X curve, press
control V to paste the curve,

111
00:05:14,620 --> 00:05:17,660
I will align it with its original shape

112
00:05:17,660 --> 00:05:20,820
and then offset it a bit by three frames.

113
00:05:20,820 --> 00:05:24,690
So the idea is to use the
same curve for each joint

114
00:05:24,690 --> 00:05:29,690
but offset it in time by one
or two additional frames.

115
00:05:30,272 --> 00:05:33,520
Then you can play with
the shape of the tail

116
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:35,850
by changing the shape of the curve.

117
00:05:35,850 --> 00:05:39,286
Since I have a symmetrical motion

118
00:05:39,286 --> 00:05:43,191
I can use the 2d cursor as a pivot point.

119
00:05:43,191 --> 00:05:47,329
Its position is represented
by the crossing blue lines

120
00:05:47,329 --> 00:05:49,770
and as seen in the previous chapter,

121
00:05:49,770 --> 00:05:53,510
you can place it wherever you
want by shift right clicking,

122
00:05:53,510 --> 00:05:58,510
or going into the view option
and set its value, here zero.

123
00:05:58,610 --> 00:06:03,080
Now I can press S and Y with
all my key frames selected

124
00:06:03,080 --> 00:06:05,740
to increase the amplitude of the curve

125
00:06:05,740 --> 00:06:09,503
because I'm scaling the
curve only on the Y axis

126
00:06:09,503 --> 00:06:13,460
so we will have a broader
motion of the tail

127
00:06:13,460 --> 00:06:16,820
making it look more relaxed or heavier.

128
00:06:16,820 --> 00:06:19,810
This is a fast, easy and cheap way

129
00:06:19,810 --> 00:06:23,100
to get this kind of
overlapping motion done.

130
00:06:23,100 --> 00:06:26,760
It will sure be a little more
complex on full characters

131
00:06:26,760 --> 00:06:28,143
but that's a good tip.
