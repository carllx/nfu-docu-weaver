00:00:00,170 --> 00:00:02,740
- Hi everyone, this is
Pierrick from P2 Design.

2
00:00:02,740 --> 00:00:05,320
I'm so happy to welcome you to Alive!,

3
00:00:05,320 --> 00:00:07,690
the animation course in Blender.

4
00:00:07,690 --> 00:00:10,720
In this training course,
we will learn the tools,

5
00:00:10,720 --> 00:00:13,100
the fundamentals, and principle

6
00:00:13,100 --> 00:00:15,680
while manipulating and animating.

7
00:00:15,680 --> 00:00:19,980
As any other art form, you
won't get good at animation

8
00:00:19,980 --> 00:00:22,010
by watching video tutorials.

9
00:00:22,010 --> 00:00:25,250
You do need to practice
as much as possible.

10
00:00:25,250 --> 00:00:27,960
I'm here to teach you my best practices

11
00:00:27,960 --> 00:00:32,490
to help to learning and
improving your animation skills.

12
00:00:32,490 --> 00:00:37,273
Videos are shot to offer the
best learning experience.

13
00:00:37,273 --> 00:00:40,440
I advise you to watch each video once

14
00:00:40,440 --> 00:00:43,510
and then rewatch them and follow along.

15
00:00:43,510 --> 00:00:47,230
Each chapter will focus
on a specific theme,

16
00:00:47,230 --> 00:00:50,220
principle, or level of animation.

17
00:00:50,220 --> 00:00:52,220
Whatever your skill level,

18
00:00:52,220 --> 00:00:55,740
I advise you to take this
course from the beginning,

19
00:00:55,740 --> 00:00:59,570
because they are big chances
you will learn something,

20
00:00:59,570 --> 00:01:03,550
or at least it will
refresh your animator mind.

21
00:01:03,550 --> 00:01:04,670
In the next video,

22
00:01:04,670 --> 00:01:08,900
I will go through the current
content of the course,

23
00:01:08,900 --> 00:01:12,180
but the course will be also updated

24
00:01:12,180 --> 00:01:16,730
and I will add the more
content through free updates.

25
00:01:16,730 --> 00:01:18,820
The course come with a ball rig,

26
00:01:18,820 --> 00:01:21,820
a little police squirrel character rig,

27
00:01:21,820 --> 00:01:23,370
a Battle mech rig,

28
00:01:23,370 --> 00:01:25,970
and the character Trident.

29
00:01:25,970 --> 00:01:27,900
You are free to use those rig

30
00:01:27,900 --> 00:01:30,790
for your non-commercial projects.

31
00:01:30,790 --> 00:01:33,510
You can post any of the
animation you will do

32
00:01:33,510 --> 00:01:36,260
with those characters on your social media

33
00:01:36,260 --> 00:01:38,260
or for your portfolio,

34
00:01:38,260 --> 00:01:43,260
but you can't use these rigs
or any content of the course

35
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:45,180
for commercial project.

36
00:01:45,180 --> 00:01:50,180
And you must not re-distribute
or share any of the content

37
00:01:50,190 --> 00:01:54,590
of the course, whether it's
Blende file or video files.

38
00:01:54,590 --> 00:01:57,600
The course come with the
documentation where you will find

39
00:01:57,600 --> 00:02:00,550
the list of all the videos included.

40
00:02:00,550 --> 00:02:04,130
The difficulty level of each
chapter will be defined,

41
00:02:04,130 --> 00:02:06,450
my freestyle level.

42
00:02:06,450 --> 00:02:08,120
One star is beginner,

43
00:02:08,120 --> 00:02:12,480
two star intermediate, and
three star is advanced.

44
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:16,870
You will also find links to the
different external resources

45
00:02:16,870 --> 00:02:18,780
use in this course.

46
00:02:18,780 --> 00:02:22,340
And they will be labeled
in a yellow color.

47
00:02:22,340 --> 00:02:25,710
The video labeled in blue are theoretical

48
00:02:25,710 --> 00:02:28,390
and tools focused video.

49
00:02:28,390 --> 00:02:32,250
So I advise you to watch them
all and come back to them

50
00:02:32,250 --> 00:02:35,300
often so that you don't miss any detail.

51
00:02:35,300 --> 00:02:39,320
Let's jump into the next video
and see what's the content of

52
00:02:39,320 --> 00:02:40,153
the course.
