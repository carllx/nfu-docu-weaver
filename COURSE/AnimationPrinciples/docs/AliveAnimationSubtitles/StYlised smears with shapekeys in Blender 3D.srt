- Hi, everyone. Pierrick from P2design.

3
00:00:06,139 --> 00:00:08,070
In this video, I will show you

4
00:00:08,070 --> 00:00:09,870
how you can use shape shape keys

5
00:00:09,870 --> 00:00:11,820
to create stylized effect

6
00:00:11,820 --> 00:00:14,575
on your animated character in Blender.

This video is a free sample

9
00:00:20,290 --> 00:00:24,760
of one of the 150 videos
that are going to be included

10
00:00:24,760 --> 00:00:26,820
in my new course, Alive!

11
00:00:26,820 --> 00:00:28,700
This Blender animation course

12
00:00:28,700 --> 00:00:31,310
is gonna be available on next week,

13
00:00:31,310 --> 00:00:33,080
the 13th of August.

14
00:00:33,080 --> 00:00:34,910
Stay tuned and check the link

15
00:00:34,910 --> 00:00:36,170
in the description below.

16
00:00:36,170 --> 00:00:38,860
In this video, I will show you in detail

17
00:00:38,860 --> 00:00:40,130
how to create shape keys

18
00:00:40,130 --> 00:00:43,350
and how to apply them to
your animated character.

19
00:00:43,350 --> 00:00:44,740
Let's get started.

20
00:00:44,740 --> 00:00:48,150
Shape keys allows you to deform an object

21
00:00:48,150 --> 00:00:49,630
into another shape.

22
00:00:49,630 --> 00:00:53,870
They are also known as
morph target or Blendshapes

23
00:00:53,870 --> 00:00:56,300
in Maya or ZBrush, for example.

24
00:00:56,300 --> 00:00:58,630
Shape keys are often used

25
00:00:58,630 --> 00:01:02,150
to create facial expression
for your character

26
00:01:02,150 --> 00:01:04,650
that can be triggered later on.

27
00:01:04,650 --> 00:01:07,720
It's great to create
advanced facial expression

28
00:01:07,720 --> 00:01:10,160
or quick test for your character.

29
00:01:10,160 --> 00:01:12,410
Then the rigger can create controllers

30
00:01:12,410 --> 00:01:15,260
so that you can trigger
those shape keys at will

31
00:01:15,260 --> 00:01:17,137
in your animation.

32
00:01:17,137 --> 00:01:18,230
(screen whooshing)

33
00:01:18,230 --> 00:01:20,660
Shape keys are a modification

34
00:01:20,660 --> 00:01:23,560
or a transformation of the mesh.

35
00:01:23,560 --> 00:01:27,291
So you will be able to
find the Shape Keys panel

36
00:01:27,291 --> 00:01:31,160
into the mesh data of your object.

37
00:01:31,160 --> 00:01:32,550
To create a shape key,

38
00:01:32,550 --> 00:01:35,680
we simply need to click the plus icon

39
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:36,667
on the right of the panel.

40
00:01:36,667 --> 00:01:38,110
The first shape key

41
00:01:38,110 --> 00:01:42,410
to be created will be
automatically named basis.

42
00:01:42,410 --> 00:01:44,920
It's some kind of snapshot

43
00:01:44,920 --> 00:01:48,630
of the current position of each vertices

44
00:01:48,630 --> 00:01:49,640
in your mesh.

45
00:01:49,640 --> 00:01:52,020
Whenever we jump into edit mode

46
00:01:52,020 --> 00:01:54,000
with a vertex selected,

47
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,720
in the properties panel,

48
00:01:55,720 --> 00:01:59,320
we can see the current
location of this vertex.

49
00:01:59,320 --> 00:02:02,460
The basis shape key
will record the position

50
00:02:02,460 --> 00:02:04,870
of each vertex for our mesh.

51
00:02:04,870 --> 00:02:07,470
And this specific basis shape key

52
00:02:07,470 --> 00:02:09,700
is going to be the point of reference

53
00:02:09,700 --> 00:02:11,360
for the next shape key.

54
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:15,120
It's a bit like the rest
pose for a character rig.

55
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:17,420
From there, we can
create another shape key

56
00:02:17,420 --> 00:02:19,070
by clicking the plus button,

57
00:02:19,070 --> 00:02:22,940
and now render is no longer
naming the shape key basis

58
00:02:22,940 --> 00:02:24,620
but key number one.

59
00:02:24,620 --> 00:02:27,300
Now, to be able to animate this shape key,

60
00:02:27,300 --> 00:02:30,150
we need to create a first deformation.

61
00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:31,710
You need to be in edit mode

62
00:02:31,710 --> 00:02:33,287
and the most important thing

63
00:02:33,287 --> 00:02:37,500
is to make sure that the
key is currently selected.

64
00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:39,990
To select it, you just
need to left click it

65
00:02:39,990 --> 00:02:41,480
and it will be highlighted.

66
00:02:41,480 --> 00:02:44,440
From there, I can move one
of the vertices of my mesh.

67
00:02:44,440 --> 00:02:47,330
You can move as many vertices as you want.

68
00:02:47,330 --> 00:02:50,800
And as soon as I will press
Tab to exit edit mode,

69
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:54,330
my mesh will return to the shape it had

70
00:02:54,330 --> 00:02:55,890
on the basis shape key.

71
00:02:55,890 --> 00:02:58,450
From there, I can activate my shape key

72
00:02:58,450 --> 00:03:02,310
by simply increasing the
value of key number one

73
00:03:02,310 --> 00:03:03,690
from zero to one.

74
00:03:03,690 --> 00:03:07,810
Blender will automatically
interpolate the shape key.

75
00:03:07,810 --> 00:03:11,030
One being the shape key
we have currently built,

76
00:03:11,030 --> 00:03:12,850
zero being the basis.

77
00:03:12,850 --> 00:03:15,140
To understand how shape keys work,

78
00:03:15,140 --> 00:03:16,710
I will create a new shape key.

79
00:03:16,710 --> 00:03:18,270
Then I will enter edit mode

80
00:03:18,270 --> 00:03:20,710
and I will rotate my whole character.

81
00:03:20,710 --> 00:03:22,910
Note that you can rename your shape keys

82
00:03:22,910 --> 00:03:24,680
as any other data in Blender

83
00:03:24,680 --> 00:03:26,960
by simply double clicking its name.

84
00:03:26,960 --> 00:03:30,180
As we have rotated our object in edit mode

85
00:03:30,180 --> 00:03:32,000
by triggering the shape key,

86
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,430
I'm expecting it to rotate in space,

87
00:03:34,430 --> 00:03:37,438
exactly as I'm doing here in object mode.

88
00:03:37,438 --> 00:03:39,640
I'm going back onto my model,

89
00:03:39,640 --> 00:03:41,520
and I will trigger the shape key.

90
00:03:41,520 --> 00:03:43,800
What we learn here is that it seems

91
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:46,050
that my object is getting scaled

92
00:03:46,050 --> 00:03:48,110
while I'm triggering the shape key.

93
00:03:48,110 --> 00:03:49,960
But this is not the case.

94
00:03:49,960 --> 00:03:52,640
This is currently how shape keys work.

95
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:54,154
And to better understand it,

96
00:03:54,154 --> 00:03:56,910
I've tracked one of the vertices,

97
00:03:56,910 --> 00:03:59,430
parenting a small sphere to this vertex.

98
00:03:59,430 --> 00:04:02,296
If you carefully focus on this vertex,

99
00:04:02,296 --> 00:04:07,030
you will see that it moves
in a straight line in space.

100
00:04:07,030 --> 00:04:11,790
And this is because a vertex
only have location coordinates,

101
00:04:11,790 --> 00:04:15,577
and Blender will simply move each vertices

102
00:04:15,577 --> 00:04:20,577
in a straight line from
their original basis position

103
00:04:20,982 --> 00:04:23,840
toward the keyframe position

104
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:27,330
over the keyframe value
that goes from zero to one.

105
00:04:27,330 --> 00:04:31,520
So you can't perform a proper
rotation using shape key.

106
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:34,580
You can only perform translation

107
00:04:34,580 --> 00:04:36,570
of individual vertices.

108
00:04:36,570 --> 00:04:40,790
So even if the final output
looks a bit like a rotation,

109
00:04:40,790 --> 00:04:42,490
this is not a rotation.

110
00:04:42,490 --> 00:04:45,831
Each vertex is moving in a linear fashion

111
00:04:45,831 --> 00:04:50,831
from its current basis position
to the shape key position.

112
00:04:51,190 --> 00:04:54,970
Now, to better understand
shape keys extrapolation

113
00:04:54,970 --> 00:04:56,370
and their behavior,

114
00:04:56,370 --> 00:04:59,110
I have created this arrow shape

115
00:04:59,110 --> 00:05:01,300
and I will create the basis shape key,

116
00:05:01,300 --> 00:05:02,620
and a first key.

117
00:05:02,620 --> 00:05:05,260
From there, I will jump into edit mode,

118
00:05:05,260 --> 00:05:08,000
and with my shape key number one selected,

119
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:11,310
I will move by one Blender
unit the top vertices

120
00:05:11,310 --> 00:05:12,220
of the arrow.

121
00:05:12,220 --> 00:05:14,990
Now, when I trigger my shape key,

122
00:05:14,990 --> 00:05:18,510
those vertices will
move in a linear fashion

123
00:05:18,510 --> 00:05:21,450
by one Blender unit on the z-axis.

124
00:05:21,450 --> 00:05:25,740
But since the shape key
occurs at the mesh data level,

125
00:05:25,740 --> 00:05:28,580
I can rotate my data container,

126
00:05:28,580 --> 00:05:31,730
my object and trigger the shape key,

127
00:05:31,730 --> 00:05:34,900
and the shape key will behave as expected.

128
00:05:34,900 --> 00:05:36,750
Now, if we have a closer look

129
00:05:36,750 --> 00:05:39,020
to our shape key's information,

130
00:05:39,020 --> 00:05:41,790
we have a minimum range
and a maximum range.

131
00:05:41,790 --> 00:05:44,050
This will allow us to whether clamp

132
00:05:44,050 --> 00:05:46,500
or increase the interpolation range

133
00:05:46,500 --> 00:05:47,580
of the shape key.

134
00:05:47,580 --> 00:05:50,570
If I clomp the maximum value to 0.5,

135
00:05:50,570 --> 00:05:52,630
I won't be able to go further.

136
00:05:52,630 --> 00:05:55,350
If I now allow a maximum value of two,

137
00:05:55,350 --> 00:05:57,920
the vertices of the arrow's head

138
00:05:57,920 --> 00:06:01,680
will move two time further
away in a linear fashion.

139
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:04,260
If I allow a negative minimum range,

140
00:06:04,260 --> 00:06:08,690
I will be able to extrapolate
the current shape key backward

141
00:06:08,690 --> 00:06:10,890
or negatively, and the vertices

142
00:06:10,890 --> 00:06:13,200
will just move the opposite direction.

143
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:16,370
You can combine as many
shape keys as you want,

144
00:06:16,370 --> 00:06:18,410
and this is how we generally create

145
00:06:18,410 --> 00:06:20,600
complex facial expression.

146
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:23,820
I have created a couple
of additional shape keys,

147
00:06:23,820 --> 00:06:26,380
and now I can trigger all the shape keys

148
00:06:26,380 --> 00:06:29,660
at the same time or
combine different values.

149
00:06:29,660 --> 00:06:32,730
The coordinate modification
of each vertices

150
00:06:32,730 --> 00:06:35,790
will be added one on
top of each other based

151
00:06:35,790 --> 00:06:38,490
on the factor of each shape key.

152
00:06:38,490 --> 00:06:40,200
If you need to edit your mesh,

153
00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:44,290
make sure that you have
selected the basis shape key

154
00:06:44,290 --> 00:06:46,950
or you will be editing
the current shape key,

155
00:06:46,950 --> 00:06:48,130
not the basis.

156
00:06:48,130 --> 00:06:49,820
We can use vertex group

157
00:06:49,820 --> 00:06:52,210
to limit the influence of a shape key.

158
00:06:52,210 --> 00:06:53,810
In the vertex group panel,

159
00:06:53,810 --> 00:06:55,750
I will create a new group,

160
00:06:55,750 --> 00:07:00,300
and I will assign at 100%
the tip of the arrow,

161
00:07:00,300 --> 00:07:04,230
and with a value of 50%,
the pace of the arrow.

162
00:07:04,230 --> 00:07:06,790
Now, if I assign this vertex group

163
00:07:06,790 --> 00:07:08,230
to the first shape key

164
00:07:08,230 --> 00:07:10,940
by selecting it in the vertex group slot,

165
00:07:10,940 --> 00:07:13,440
and I now trigger the shape key,

166
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:15,590
you can see that the tip of the arrow

167
00:07:15,590 --> 00:07:18,200
is moving at its full range,

168
00:07:18,200 --> 00:07:21,810
while the other vertices only move by 50%

169
00:07:21,810 --> 00:07:22,710
of their range.

170
00:07:22,710 --> 00:07:24,610
If I now select one of the vertex

171
00:07:24,610 --> 00:07:27,970
and I exclude it by removing
it from the vertex group,

172
00:07:27,970 --> 00:07:29,830
it will no longer move.

173
00:07:29,830 --> 00:07:33,680
The vertex group value
directly influence the almond

174
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:36,170
of the shape key motion
that will be applied

175
00:07:36,170 --> 00:07:37,400
to each vertex.

176
00:07:37,400 --> 00:07:41,530
Finally, you can use other
shape keys as a basis.

177
00:07:41,530 --> 00:07:44,210
This way, you can create
complex transformation

178
00:07:44,210 --> 00:07:46,637
by changing the point of reference.

179
00:07:46,637 --> 00:07:50,400
So let's now have a
look on what we could do

180
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:54,770
with those shape keys onto
our current animation.

181
00:07:54,770 --> 00:07:58,130
I will hide the background
and affixes collection

182
00:07:58,130 --> 00:08:00,300
so that we have a clearer viewport.

183
00:08:00,300 --> 00:08:03,830
And I will directly select
my character object.

184
00:08:03,830 --> 00:08:07,320
But since the character
was linked into this scene,

185
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:10,200
I can't modify any of the mesh data.

186
00:08:10,200 --> 00:08:12,630
To be able to edit those data,

187
00:08:12,630 --> 00:08:14,880
I need to make the mesh local

188
00:08:14,880 --> 00:08:18,470
and also the object of
the character local.

189
00:08:18,470 --> 00:08:21,540
With both the container
and its data local,

190
00:08:21,540 --> 00:08:23,790
I can now add a new shape key.

191
00:08:23,790 --> 00:08:27,400
Since we will directly be
editing our character model,

192
00:08:27,400 --> 00:08:29,190
I can hide the rig,

193
00:08:29,190 --> 00:08:31,720
and I will scrub through the animation,

194
00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:34,000
and I will try to spot the moment

195
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,430
where the character is moving very fast,

196
00:08:36,430 --> 00:08:38,790
like this hook motion, for example.

197
00:08:38,790 --> 00:08:41,620
I've already created smears using the rig

198
00:08:41,620 --> 00:08:45,113
but now I can add extra
details using shape keys.

199
00:08:46,340 --> 00:08:47,710
Clicking the plus button,

200
00:08:47,710 --> 00:08:49,410
I will add a new shape key.

201
00:08:49,410 --> 00:08:51,680
I will call it Hook01

202
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:53,420
and I will jump into edit mode,

203
00:08:53,420 --> 00:08:54,710
pressing the Tab key.

204
00:08:54,710 --> 00:08:58,550
To be able to see your
character posed in edit mode,

205
00:08:58,550 --> 00:09:01,400
make sure to enable all the display option

206
00:09:01,400 --> 00:09:03,480
in the armature modifier.

207
00:09:03,480 --> 00:09:06,170
From there, with my shape key selected,

208
00:09:06,170 --> 00:09:08,410
I can start editing my character.

209
00:09:08,410 --> 00:09:11,060
The process is simply to pull some

210
00:09:11,060 --> 00:09:13,500
of the vertices of the character

211
00:09:13,500 --> 00:09:15,780
towards its previous position

212
00:09:15,780 --> 00:09:18,580
as if part of his mesh was dragging

213
00:09:18,580 --> 00:09:20,230
during this quick motion.

214
00:09:20,230 --> 00:09:24,040
I need to disable the x
symmetry while in edit mode,

215
00:09:24,040 --> 00:09:26,710
and now I can pull some
of the vertices back,

216
00:09:26,710 --> 00:09:29,195
and start to create my effect.

217
00:09:29,195 --> 00:09:30,370
The important thing

218
00:09:30,370 --> 00:09:33,560
is that those effects will be seen

219
00:09:33,560 --> 00:09:35,180
from the camera view.

220
00:09:35,180 --> 00:09:38,880
So it's important to make them
work from the camera view.

221
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:41,070
You can sure edit your mesh

222
00:09:41,070 --> 00:09:43,450
from any point of view you want,

223
00:09:43,450 --> 00:09:46,120
but make sure that it does look good

224
00:09:46,120 --> 00:09:48,340
from your camera point of view

225
00:09:48,340 --> 00:09:50,460
as it is what is going to be rendered.

226
00:09:50,460 --> 00:09:52,670
If you want to create broader shapes

227
00:09:52,670 --> 00:09:54,910
or move multiple vertices at once,

228
00:09:54,910 --> 00:09:57,640
you can enable the editing falloff.

229
00:09:57,640 --> 00:10:00,470
Once you are done with
your first shape key,

230
00:10:00,470 --> 00:10:02,570
you can exit edit mode

231
00:10:02,570 --> 00:10:05,000
and trigger it by changing its value.

232
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,820
As seen in chapter two,

233
00:10:06,820 --> 00:10:09,470
shape keys, as most Blender data,

234
00:10:09,470 --> 00:10:13,600
can be keyed by pressing
i over the keyframe value.

235
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:16,530
Then I can edit this value whenever I want

236
00:10:16,530 --> 00:10:18,330
over my animation.

237
00:10:18,330 --> 00:10:22,100
This will activate or
deactivate the current shape key

238
00:10:22,100 --> 00:10:25,870
or if you change the value
over multiple frames,

239
00:10:25,870 --> 00:10:29,300
Blender will interpolate
the value of the shape keys.

240
00:10:29,300 --> 00:10:31,220
For example, in the previous frame,

241
00:10:31,220 --> 00:10:33,420
I can add a bit of the shape key

242
00:10:33,420 --> 00:10:36,020
to initiate this transformation

243
00:10:36,020 --> 00:10:38,550
and set it to zero on the previous key.

244
00:10:38,550 --> 00:10:41,160
Once you're happy with your first effect,

245
00:10:41,160 --> 00:10:42,930
you can add more of them.

246
00:10:42,930 --> 00:10:45,050
When working on a shot like that,

247
00:10:45,050 --> 00:10:48,440
this is going to be the final
touch, the final effect.

248
00:10:48,440 --> 00:10:51,520
So I advise you to create
multiple shape keys.

249
00:10:51,520 --> 00:10:54,560
For example, here I want
to add a few details

250
00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:56,020
on the arm too.

251
00:10:56,020 --> 00:10:58,670
I will create a dedicated shape key

252
00:10:58,670 --> 00:11:02,443
instead of adding it on the
same shape key as before.

253
00:11:02,443 --> 00:11:04,790
This way, it's gonna be easier for me

254
00:11:04,790 --> 00:11:07,430
to edit whether the shape key of the arm

255
00:11:07,430 --> 00:11:11,190
or the head delay one
compared to the other

256
00:11:11,190 --> 00:11:13,780
or simply remove it without destroying

257
00:11:13,780 --> 00:11:15,500
what I've done for the head.

258
00:11:15,500 --> 00:11:18,570
Or you will also be able
to show a different version

259
00:11:18,570 --> 00:11:20,810
to your art director, for example.

260
00:11:20,810 --> 00:11:23,550
In my case, I've also
created the shape key

261
00:11:23,550 --> 00:11:25,670
during the kick impact

262
00:11:25,670 --> 00:11:28,210
to try to blend with the previous shape.

263
00:11:28,210 --> 00:11:31,680
This kind of effect, on
top of the smear effect,

264
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:33,520
will fake motion blur

265
00:11:33,520 --> 00:11:37,250
and will help your audience
to better read your animation.

266
00:11:37,250 --> 00:11:39,720
And as explained in the previous video,

267
00:11:39,720 --> 00:11:43,120
whatever you do to improve the readability

268
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:46,333
of your animation will
take it to the next level.

269
00:11:47,547 --> 00:11:52,547
(character grunting)
(bag banging)
