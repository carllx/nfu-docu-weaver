00:00:00,810 --> 00:00:01,740
- [Instructor] In this video,

2
00:00:01,740 --> 00:00:04,330
we will polish the moment our character

3
00:00:04,330 --> 00:00:07,970
is making his head turn and smell the air.

4
00:00:07,970 --> 00:00:09,820
He's sniffing the air.

5
00:00:09,820 --> 00:00:14,410
For this one, the body controller
motion is quite subtle,

6
00:00:14,410 --> 00:00:16,700
because in the end our character

7
00:00:16,700 --> 00:00:19,820
is not really changing stance.

8
00:00:19,820 --> 00:00:22,480
He's rotating a bit and raising a bit.

9
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:25,370
So as usual, I'm trying to make a nice arc

10
00:00:25,370 --> 00:00:28,160
when I'm doing this kind of motion.

11
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:31,270
This time, the arc is
more subtle than usual

12
00:00:31,270 --> 00:00:33,450
because the motion is subtle.

13
00:00:33,450 --> 00:00:36,870
As the character is shifting to its left

14
00:00:36,870 --> 00:00:39,130
and rotating to its left,

15
00:00:39,130 --> 00:00:43,650
I'm first slightly lowering the whole body

16
00:00:43,650 --> 00:00:44,990
and then raising it.

17
00:00:44,990 --> 00:00:46,960
It will create this arc.

18
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:51,640
This lower stance can be used
as some kind of anticipation.

19
00:00:51,640 --> 00:00:54,880
One thing I should have
done and you should do

20
00:00:54,880 --> 00:00:58,960
is that just before the
character smells the air

21
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:02,430
as he push his body a little upper

22
00:01:02,430 --> 00:01:07,290
you could add a micro anticipation
on frame 60 for example,

23
00:01:07,290 --> 00:01:11,483
just lowering the body attached
before raising it even more.

24
00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:14,560
This is something I've explained before

25
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:17,330
when we have done the walk cycle

26
00:01:17,330 --> 00:01:22,090
something I like to update
early on or polish early on

27
00:01:22,090 --> 00:01:24,190
are the contacting controllers.

28
00:01:24,190 --> 00:01:27,790
So as our character's shifting
his weight onto his left

29
00:01:27,790 --> 00:01:30,940
I want to move his foot controller too.

30
00:01:30,940 --> 00:01:32,750
As the body was polished,

31
00:01:32,750 --> 00:01:36,410
I have reworked the
spacing of the footstep

32
00:01:36,410 --> 00:01:38,620
making it a little faster

33
00:01:38,620 --> 00:01:41,540
and then I've changed it's timing

34
00:01:41,540 --> 00:01:46,460
so that it starts just after
the body start rotating

35
00:01:46,460 --> 00:01:51,460
but it lands before the
body hit it's extreme pose.

36
00:01:51,580 --> 00:01:55,290
Motion-wise it's pretty
simple for the location.

37
00:01:55,290 --> 00:02:00,020
The X and Y axis are using vector handles

38
00:02:00,020 --> 00:02:02,810
so is that I have a linear interpolation.

39
00:02:02,810 --> 00:02:06,400
As for the other foot contact
animation we have done before

40
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:08,200
for the Z location,

41
00:02:08,200 --> 00:02:11,470
the contacting frame 49 and 53

42
00:02:11,470 --> 00:02:13,290
are using vector handles

43
00:02:13,290 --> 00:02:17,490
and on frame 51 I've created
a slight bump on the curve.

44
00:02:17,490 --> 00:02:20,250
Keep it subtle, don't
forget that we are lazy

45
00:02:20,250 --> 00:02:22,950
and we won't be raising
the foot that much.

46
00:02:22,950 --> 00:02:25,140
What will really improve this footstep

47
00:02:25,140 --> 00:02:26,850
is the rotation in the foot,

48
00:02:26,850 --> 00:02:28,490
this is very important.

49
00:02:28,490 --> 00:02:30,570
It's a very subtle motion

50
00:02:30,570 --> 00:02:32,790
I don't say that I'm doing it perfectly

51
00:02:32,790 --> 00:02:36,720
but what I'm sure is
that animators will look

52
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:38,420
at these kind of details.

53
00:02:38,420 --> 00:02:40,670
When the foot raise it's dragging

54
00:02:40,670 --> 00:02:44,650
so the outer part of the
foot is pointing down.

55
00:02:44,650 --> 00:02:48,290
Then it's raising so
that the ball of the foot

56
00:02:48,290 --> 00:02:50,220
is facing the ground.

57
00:02:50,220 --> 00:02:53,730
On the contact frame the
foot is still rotated

58
00:02:53,730 --> 00:02:55,160
and on the next frame,

59
00:02:55,160 --> 00:02:57,050
I will make the foot flat

60
00:02:57,050 --> 00:03:00,790
so that I have this slap
motion on the ground.

61
00:03:00,790 --> 00:03:01,760
From the side view,

62
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:04,800
it's even more obvious the foot's raised,

63
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:07,500
the tip of the foot is dragging.

64
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:09,480
Then just before the contact frame

65
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:11,910
the tip of the foot is raising

66
00:03:11,910 --> 00:03:15,190
on the contact post the tip
of the foot is still raised

67
00:03:15,190 --> 00:03:17,960
and on the next post it's flattened

68
00:03:17,960 --> 00:03:21,600
to get the snap effect on the ground.

69
00:03:23,127 --> 00:03:27,280
The chest motion is here to
support the head rotation.

70
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:29,210
The head is leading the animation

71
00:03:29,210 --> 00:03:32,270
meaning that the chest
will be slightly delayed

72
00:03:32,270 --> 00:03:33,670
compared to the head.

73
00:03:33,670 --> 00:03:36,970
In the end they arrived
almost at the same time

74
00:03:36,970 --> 00:03:38,260
on their extreme pose.

75
00:03:38,260 --> 00:03:42,710
The little extra information
regarding the chest controller

76
00:03:42,710 --> 00:03:46,030
is that I've been using the location

77
00:03:46,030 --> 00:03:49,160
to emphasize the smelling motion.

78
00:03:49,160 --> 00:03:52,280
I've used it to pull the character up

79
00:03:52,280 --> 00:03:55,810
and then I've added a
slight bump on the curve

80
00:03:55,810 --> 00:03:58,090
to create the smelling motion.

81
00:03:58,090 --> 00:04:01,540
It adds an extra up and
down motion to the chest

82
00:04:01,540 --> 00:04:03,277
which is connected to the head

83
00:04:03,277 --> 00:04:05,810
and the head will be rotating

84
00:04:05,810 --> 00:04:08,530
or moving this up-and-down motion

85
00:04:08,530 --> 00:04:11,893
that translate our
character smelling the air.

86
00:04:12,890 --> 00:04:16,050
As usual, when I'm
polishing the head rotation

87
00:04:16,050 --> 00:04:18,900
I'm tracking the motion path of the nose.

88
00:04:18,900 --> 00:04:20,880
To create the smelling motion

89
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:25,880
I've just added a couple of
bump on the X rotation curve

90
00:04:26,100 --> 00:04:27,670
of the head controller.

91
00:04:27,670 --> 00:04:31,080
Keep it subtle, you don't
need the head to nod that much

92
00:04:31,080 --> 00:04:32,650
and test different spacing.

93
00:04:32,650 --> 00:04:37,000
In my case, having the
first bump on frame 66

94
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:41,370
and the second on frame
73 was the good call.

95
00:04:41,370 --> 00:04:45,250
After I finished polishing
the head rotation,

96
00:04:45,250 --> 00:04:48,540
I've added a bit of
extra motion on the nose

97
00:04:48,540 --> 00:04:50,450
playing with its Y curve.

98
00:04:50,450 --> 00:04:53,580
The idea wasn't to make the nose dragging

99
00:04:53,580 --> 00:04:56,320
but instead moving forward and inward

100
00:04:56,320 --> 00:05:00,110
so that we can feel the
breathing of our character

101
00:05:00,110 --> 00:05:01,980
while he's smelling the air.

102
00:05:01,980 --> 00:05:06,080
This is why the Y curve was
working great for this one.

103
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:07,660
You can pause the nose by hand

104
00:05:07,660 --> 00:05:10,000
if you're not comfortable with the curve

105
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,830
and try different timing.

106
00:05:11,830 --> 00:05:14,560
Another detail I wanted
to add on top of this

107
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:16,850
are the eyes slightly closing

108
00:05:16,850 --> 00:05:19,620
while our character is smelling the air.

109
00:05:19,620 --> 00:05:22,610
That's a pretty common
thing when you are focusing

110
00:05:22,610 --> 00:05:25,130
on when you are smelling something good,

111
00:05:25,130 --> 00:05:27,550
you tend to close your eyes

112
00:05:27,550 --> 00:05:32,550
to focus on the sense that is
used to focus on your smell.

113
00:05:32,770 --> 00:05:35,890
There's only the Z curve that
controlled the eyeopening

114
00:05:35,890 --> 00:05:38,690
so editing this curve is very simple.

115
00:05:38,690 --> 00:05:41,070
The ears are also pretty important

116
00:05:41,070 --> 00:05:44,620
to support this specific animation.

117
00:05:44,620 --> 00:05:47,950
If you watch the spacing
between the head rotation

118
00:05:47,950 --> 00:05:50,870
tracking the eyes and the ear rotation,

119
00:05:50,870 --> 00:05:53,330
we can see that the
spacing is more important

120
00:05:53,330 --> 00:05:55,040
on the left ear

121
00:05:55,040 --> 00:05:59,700
and this is because I wanted
the ear to lead the animation.

122
00:05:59,700 --> 00:06:04,580
The character rotate the
ears towards his next move

123
00:06:04,580 --> 00:06:09,260
because the ears communicate
his center of attention

124
00:06:09,260 --> 00:06:11,860
and as he's going to smell the air,

125
00:06:11,860 --> 00:06:14,800
the ears, the eyes, everything is pointing

126
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:16,660
in the same direction

127
00:06:16,660 --> 00:06:19,680
because he's focusing on smelling the air

128
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:22,240
in this very direction.

129
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:23,910
For this part of the animation

130
00:06:23,910 --> 00:06:27,470
I've also softened the hips rotation.

131
00:06:27,470 --> 00:06:28,660
So they are still there.

132
00:06:28,660 --> 00:06:31,310
There is still a little twisting

133
00:06:31,310 --> 00:06:35,070
as the character is pulling his left leg

134
00:06:35,070 --> 00:06:37,040
toward the contact point.

135
00:06:37,040 --> 00:06:39,360
This is why I spent a lot of time

136
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:42,030
on the Z quaternions rotation curve.

137
00:06:42,030 --> 00:06:44,980
Between frame 52 and 56

138
00:06:44,980 --> 00:06:48,820
the leg is getting pulled and on frame 58,

139
00:06:48,820 --> 00:06:50,090
the pose settle.

140
00:06:50,090 --> 00:06:53,240
So we can see the curve
changing direction.

141
00:06:53,240 --> 00:06:56,410
It's getting down between frame 52 and 55,

142
00:06:56,410 --> 00:06:59,920
and after that it's getting
up ever so slightly.

143
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:01,680
The next thing I have polished

144
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:05,180
on this segment of the
animation were the arms.

145
00:07:05,180 --> 00:07:08,240
Since they are not
contacting with anything

146
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:12,090
try to draw nice arcs
with your arm motion.

147
00:07:12,090 --> 00:07:14,320
The second thing we have pointed out

148
00:07:14,320 --> 00:07:18,470
during the blocking
stage was using the arm

149
00:07:18,470 --> 00:07:21,920
as a counterweight to keep
our character balanced.

150
00:07:21,920 --> 00:07:23,800
So as the body is raising

151
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:26,660
for the smelling segment of the animation,

152
00:07:26,660 --> 00:07:28,610
the right arm is dropping.

153
00:07:28,610 --> 00:07:32,290
It lowers the center of
gravity of our character

154
00:07:32,290 --> 00:07:34,300
and it's also a nice contrast

155
00:07:34,300 --> 00:07:36,600
with the left arm that is raised.

156
00:07:36,600 --> 00:07:40,160
In the time-lapse you will
also see me a bit fighting

157
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:42,640
with the right tail board character

158
00:07:42,640 --> 00:07:45,180
because there was a bit of intersection

159
00:07:45,180 --> 00:07:47,670
and wobbling in the right arm.

160
00:07:47,670 --> 00:07:50,120
This is the kind of problem and limitation

161
00:07:50,120 --> 00:07:52,810
you can get when using inverse kinematic

162
00:07:52,810 --> 00:07:56,290
without a pole target
as we are for the legs.

163
00:07:56,290 --> 00:08:00,370
There is a little technique
to fix it using constraint

164
00:08:00,370 --> 00:08:04,070
but this is something that we
will see in the next chapter

165
00:08:04,070 --> 00:08:07,330
where I will introduce
you to space switching.

166
00:08:07,330 --> 00:08:10,530
On the time being I'm a bit
fighting with the curve,

167
00:08:10,530 --> 00:08:12,820
that's not a big deal, honestly.

168
00:08:12,820 --> 00:08:15,520
And if you have the same kind of problem

169
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:19,643
just try to fix it but don't
waste too much time on to it.

170
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:24,630
Regarding the time motion, there
are two things to consider.

171
00:08:24,630 --> 00:08:28,530
The little wiping animation a bit nervous,

172
00:08:28,530 --> 00:08:32,540
again, to translate the
character of the squirrel,

173
00:08:32,540 --> 00:08:35,140
the root of the tail
doesn't move that much,

174
00:08:35,140 --> 00:08:39,130
there is just the middle and
mostly the tip of the tail

175
00:08:39,130 --> 00:08:40,390
that are moving.

176
00:08:40,390 --> 00:08:42,380
Again, this is not a big motion

177
00:08:42,380 --> 00:08:46,410
as during the run cycle or
to recover from the jump.

178
00:08:46,410 --> 00:08:48,170
It's just a little something

179
00:08:48,170 --> 00:08:51,180
to give personality to our character

180
00:08:51,180 --> 00:08:53,950
and to transition into the next pose,

181
00:08:53,950 --> 00:08:55,440
which is very important.

182
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:58,770
If we watch the silhouette
of our character

183
00:08:58,770 --> 00:09:00,010
we can clearly see

184
00:09:00,010 --> 00:09:05,010
that he seems to be slightly
bending or leaning forward.

185
00:09:05,670 --> 00:09:08,720
This is the pose where
he's smelling the air

186
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:10,140
surrounding him.

187
00:09:10,140 --> 00:09:14,540
So he's trying to reach as
high and as far as possible.

188
00:09:14,540 --> 00:09:18,400
And it seems that he's
going to fall forward.

189
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:19,630
So in this case,

190
00:09:19,630 --> 00:09:22,440
the final pose of the
time is very important

191
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:25,610
because it serves as a counterweight.

192
00:09:25,610 --> 00:09:28,820
So those are all the
details you need to look for

193
00:09:28,820 --> 00:09:32,653
when you are going to polish
the segment of the animation.
