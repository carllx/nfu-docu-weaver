1
00:00:01,330 --> 00:00:04,360
- In this video, we will
quickly create the foot roll.

2
00:00:04,360 --> 00:00:07,470
Meaning that we will
input a bit of rotation

3
00:00:07,470 --> 00:00:11,940
in the foot and slightly
adjust the whole motion.

4
00:00:11,940 --> 00:00:14,610
This is going to be
pretty straightforward.

5
00:00:14,610 --> 00:00:17,890
I will select the foot
roll controllers that is

6
00:00:17,890 --> 00:00:19,740
in the back of the foot.

7
00:00:19,740 --> 00:00:21,810
I will first select the correct controller

8
00:00:21,810 --> 00:00:23,360
the one I'm working on,

9
00:00:23,360 --> 00:00:25,620
and I will rotate it a bit forward.

10
00:00:25,620 --> 00:00:28,910
As the foot is kind of under the torso.

11
00:00:28,910 --> 00:00:32,290
It's tough to raise
during the passing pose.

12
00:00:32,290 --> 00:00:35,162
From there, I can go a few frame before,

13
00:00:35,162 --> 00:00:37,420
and I will cancel the rotation

14
00:00:37,420 --> 00:00:40,240
by pressing Alt + R in the 3D view.

15
00:00:40,240 --> 00:00:43,190
From there, I will go
forward into the animation

16
00:00:43,190 --> 00:00:45,410
to the contacting pose.

17
00:00:45,410 --> 00:00:48,860
I will cancel the
rotation of the controller

18
00:00:48,860 --> 00:00:52,230
and then I will rotate it backward

19
00:00:52,230 --> 00:00:56,600
so that the heel is currently
touching the ground, first.

20
00:00:56,600 --> 00:00:58,660
As you can see those rotation

21
00:00:58,660 --> 00:01:02,960
from the side view only
affect the X rotation channel

22
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:04,060
of this controller.

23
00:01:04,060 --> 00:01:07,030
I will flatten the foot, couple of frame

24
00:01:07,030 --> 00:01:08,410
after the contact pose

25
00:01:08,410 --> 00:01:11,360
by pressing Alt + R in the 3D view.

26
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:12,710
When the heel touch the ground

27
00:01:12,710 --> 00:01:15,710
the foot get flat pretty fast.

28
00:01:15,710 --> 00:01:17,760
It's now refined a bit to curve.

29
00:01:17,760 --> 00:01:20,280
I will slightly offset the beginning

30
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:23,540
of the raising of the heel to frame 16,

31
00:01:23,540 --> 00:01:26,770
and I will make it lean
forward a little more

32
00:01:26,770 --> 00:01:30,460
on frame 43 so that we have some dragging

33
00:01:30,460 --> 00:01:35,070
of the front toes while
the foot is moving forward.

34
00:01:35,070 --> 00:01:38,060
This will serve as our base motion.

35
00:01:38,060 --> 00:01:40,410
And from there, I will just adjust

36
00:01:40,410 --> 00:01:42,450
the amplitude of the curve,

37
00:01:42,450 --> 00:01:45,890
making the contacting pose a bit wider.

38
00:01:45,890 --> 00:01:50,000
Then, I will adjust the
roll of the foot forward.

39
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:54,350
So, I will slightly
increase frame 43 amplitude.

40
00:01:54,350 --> 00:01:58,310
So that the food is bending
backward a little more.

41
00:01:58,310 --> 00:02:01,370
I am basically slightly pushing the poles

42
00:02:01,370 --> 00:02:05,690
by pushing those curves up
by contrasting the curve,

43
00:02:05,690 --> 00:02:07,580
as we have seen just before.

44
00:02:07,580 --> 00:02:10,160
Now, I'd like a bit of a kicking motion

45
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:14,230
whenever the foot is
reaching its forward position

46
00:02:14,230 --> 00:02:18,710
by simply duplicating the extreme key down

47
00:02:18,710 --> 00:02:22,250
and offsetting it back
by a couple of frame.

48
00:02:22,250 --> 00:02:25,080
It's a bit like when
we are holding the foot

49
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:28,120
up in the air before
it touches the ground.

50
00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:29,900
It brings a bit of contrast.

51
00:02:29,900 --> 00:02:32,540
It make it a little more mechanical.

52
00:02:32,540 --> 00:02:36,240
From there, it's just a
matter of tweaking the curve

53
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:39,590
Can spend your whole lifetime
adjusting those curve

54
00:02:39,590 --> 00:02:41,900
without getting a perfect motion.

55
00:02:41,900 --> 00:02:43,860
But with a couple of adjustment

56
00:02:43,860 --> 00:02:45,310
and a bit of dragging,

57
00:02:45,310 --> 00:02:47,650
we can get a satisfying motion.

58
00:02:47,650 --> 00:02:51,800
Here, I feel like the foot
is too close to torso,

59
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:55,030
so I will select my torso controller

60
00:02:55,030 --> 00:02:57,500
and offset the whole D curve

61
00:02:57,500 --> 00:03:00,080
on the y-axis in the graphic (indistinct).

62
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:01,790
This is one of the cool thing

63
00:03:01,790 --> 00:03:03,640
about this method is that we can play

64
00:03:03,640 --> 00:03:07,800
with the different channels
to adjust the animation.

65
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:11,140
I have a slight clipping between the torso

66
00:03:11,140 --> 00:03:15,100
and the thigh that I will
probably fix later on.

67
00:03:15,100 --> 00:03:19,130
If needed, you can also
adjust the foot position

68
00:03:19,130 --> 00:03:22,180
and the timing whenever
it's falling compared

69
00:03:22,180 --> 00:03:23,840
to the body motion.

70
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:26,670
Here, I'm slightly offsetting the timing

71
00:03:26,670 --> 00:03:30,860
of the foot so that it
cleanse slightly sooner.

72
00:03:30,860 --> 00:03:34,040
And so that then the torso is falling.

73
00:03:34,040 --> 00:03:35,130
So this is the kind

74
00:03:35,130 --> 00:03:36,840
of thing I will continue

75
00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:40,040
on tweaking during the animation.

76
00:03:40,040 --> 00:03:42,660
The idea is to get the torso route right,

77
00:03:42,660 --> 00:03:45,360
and the feet right before going on.

78
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:48,863
In the next video, we
will animate the toes.
