1
00:00:00,820 --> 00:00:02,600
- As the body is now polished,

2
00:00:02,600 --> 00:00:05,480
I can work on the feet of the character.

3
00:00:05,480 --> 00:00:08,850
Will start with the back legs
since they move the most.

4
00:00:08,850 --> 00:00:12,240
First thing is to fix the Y location curve

5
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:13,890
on the contact pose.

6
00:00:13,890 --> 00:00:16,190
Now I have a proper linear root motion

7
00:00:16,190 --> 00:00:19,240
switch all the angles of the contact frame

8
00:00:19,240 --> 00:00:21,360
of the feet to vector,

9
00:00:21,360 --> 00:00:24,680
get rid of any intermediate frame,

10
00:00:24,680 --> 00:00:27,690
and tweak the value
before the foot take off

11
00:00:27,690 --> 00:00:31,330
to make sure that I don't
have any sliding effect.

12
00:00:31,330 --> 00:00:34,100
Since the leg looks too
overextended on frame three,

13
00:00:34,100 --> 00:00:37,630
I've decided it will
be the take off frame.

14
00:00:37,630 --> 00:00:40,230
From the side view I worked mainly

15
00:00:40,230 --> 00:00:41,790
on the Y location

16
00:00:41,790 --> 00:00:43,990
and then the Z location.

17
00:00:43,990 --> 00:00:45,210
As for a run cycle,

18
00:00:45,210 --> 00:00:47,720
I don't push too much the foot away

19
00:00:47,720 --> 00:00:49,290
from the tree trunk.

20
00:00:49,290 --> 00:00:52,240
And forget that our character is pushing

21
00:00:52,240 --> 00:00:56,630
toward the sky is not pushing
against the tree trunk.

22
00:00:56,630 --> 00:00:58,700
If he does, he would fall.

23
00:00:58,700 --> 00:01:00,570
So from the current point of view,

24
00:01:00,570 --> 00:01:02,280
it's better to push the pose

25
00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:04,040
of the foot downward,

26
00:01:04,040 --> 00:01:07,420
than pushing it on the left side.

27
00:01:07,420 --> 00:01:09,860
And when you reach the end of the cycle,

28
00:01:09,860 --> 00:01:13,240
make sure that again the
contact pose are in vector,

29
00:01:13,240 --> 00:01:15,317
then I'm fixing any sliding

30
00:01:15,317 --> 00:01:18,390
issue by moving the frame eight.

31
00:01:18,390 --> 00:01:21,420
Because if I was moving
the value of frame nine,

32
00:01:21,420 --> 00:01:25,110
then I would have to duplicate
this value of frame zero

33
00:01:25,110 --> 00:01:27,470
since this is the latest frame,

34
00:01:27,470 --> 00:01:31,640
it would break the fix I did
in the beginning of the video

35
00:01:31,640 --> 00:01:34,170
between frame zero and frame two.

36
00:01:34,170 --> 00:01:37,120
Because the value difference
between frame two and

37
00:01:37,120 --> 00:01:39,210
frame zero will change.

38
00:01:39,210 --> 00:01:41,330
Regarding the X location axis,

39
00:01:41,330 --> 00:01:45,800
what I've done is that
as the leg is taking off,

40
00:01:45,800 --> 00:01:48,580
it will be pushing slightly inward

41
00:01:48,580 --> 00:01:51,200
and then as it comes forward,

42
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:53,360
it will move on this side,

43
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:57,960
as if the character was going
to embrace the tree trunk.

44
00:01:57,960 --> 00:01:59,870
This is something I will try to do

45
00:01:59,870 --> 00:02:03,000
on both the hands and the
feet of the character.

46
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,550
Because as you climb the
tree trunk you're trying

47
00:02:05,550 --> 00:02:08,660
to bind the trunk to your body in a way

48
00:02:08,660 --> 00:02:10,310
But we do need to feel

49
00:02:10,310 --> 00:02:14,160
that there is a side to
side force being applied

50
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:15,890
onto the tree trunk.

51
00:02:15,890 --> 00:02:17,600
And the larger the tree trunk,

52
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:21,420
the wider our character
will open his arms.

53
00:02:21,420 --> 00:02:24,520
As usual when I'm done
with the location curve,

54
00:02:24,520 --> 00:02:27,100
I can work with my rotation curve.

55
00:02:27,100 --> 00:02:28,880
When the foot is taking off,

56
00:02:28,880 --> 00:02:31,900
I make sure that I have
a fast rotation back one,

57
00:02:31,900 --> 00:02:36,900
so that we can feel that
the foot has just pushed,

58
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,190
and is kind of wiping in the air

59
00:02:39,190 --> 00:02:41,070
And then as it catch up,

60
00:02:41,070 --> 00:02:44,110
I will just make the
tip of the foot dragging

61
00:02:44,110 --> 00:02:46,638
So I will use the rotation to do this.

62
00:02:46,638 --> 00:02:49,333
Then I have my impact frame where I want

63
00:02:49,333 --> 00:02:54,333
to open the foot just before
it lands on the surface ,

64
00:02:54,340 --> 00:02:55,260
on the reference,

65
00:02:55,260 --> 00:02:56,690
we can barely see,

66
00:02:56,690 --> 00:03:00,500
that the character is currently
grabbing the tree trunk

67
00:03:00,500 --> 00:03:01,830
with his toes.

68
00:03:01,830 --> 00:03:05,300
But our rig definition
doesn't allow us to do this.

69
00:03:05,300 --> 00:03:06,210
So what I did

70
00:03:06,210 --> 00:03:09,930
is I just created a slight foot slap

71
00:03:09,930 --> 00:03:11,970
as we did for the run cycle,

72
00:03:11,970 --> 00:03:13,710
landing on the foot bone

73
00:03:13,710 --> 00:03:18,710
and then flapping the toes
against the tree trunk.

74
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:21,998
I have used exactly the same
process for the left foot.

75
00:03:21,998 --> 00:03:26,330
First make sure that you
don't have any sliding effect

76
00:03:26,330 --> 00:03:29,158
Fixing the Y location on frame zero

77
00:03:29,158 --> 00:03:32,690
until the frame where the foot take off

78
00:03:32,690 --> 00:03:34,440
and repeat the process on the frame,

79
00:03:34,440 --> 00:03:36,800
where the foot is
contacting the tree trunk

80
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:38,570
until the end of the cycle

81
00:03:38,570 --> 00:03:41,890
If you want to push the
pause favorize the Y location

82
00:03:41,890 --> 00:03:45,610
because the Z location
will take the foot thunder

83
00:03:45,610 --> 00:03:47,500
away from the tree trunk,

84
00:03:47,500 --> 00:03:50,930
and it won't match a climbing locomotion.

85
00:03:50,930 --> 00:03:54,680
Then don't forget to work
on the X location curve

86
00:03:54,680 --> 00:03:57,640
Spreading the leg on the
side as the character

87
00:03:57,640 --> 00:04:00,900
is pulling it up before the contact pose,

88
00:04:00,900 --> 00:04:02,964
so that we feel that the character

89
00:04:02,964 --> 00:04:05,070
is catching the tree trunk,

90
00:04:05,070 --> 00:04:07,010
not simply contacting with it,

91
00:04:07,010 --> 00:04:09,290
but really grabbing the tree trunk.

92
00:04:09,290 --> 00:04:11,610
And the final important detail here,

93
00:04:11,610 --> 00:04:13,530
is to avoid twinning.

94
00:04:13,530 --> 00:04:17,050
I've made both feet
contacting the tree trunk

95
00:04:17,050 --> 00:04:19,320
at the same time and that's fine,

96
00:04:19,320 --> 00:04:23,070
because we have very
few frames on the cycle.

97
00:04:23,070 --> 00:04:25,860
But whether you're looking
from the side view or

98
00:04:25,860 --> 00:04:28,050
from the front view, you can see

99
00:04:28,050 --> 00:04:30,872
that my feet are never aligned.

100
00:04:30,872 --> 00:04:32,520
Once the feet are polished,

101
00:04:32,520 --> 00:04:35,090
you can rip onto the pole controllers.

102
00:04:35,090 --> 00:04:38,119
They will allow us to fix
the orientation of the knees.

103
00:04:38,119 --> 00:04:41,757
I won't be using the graffiti for this

104
00:04:41,757 --> 00:04:43,780
I will just check frame by frame

105
00:04:43,780 --> 00:04:46,100
and move the pole target if needed.

106
00:04:46,100 --> 00:04:49,970
The idea is to push the knees inward

107
00:04:49,970 --> 00:04:52,416
while our character is pushing,

108
00:04:52,416 --> 00:04:57,390
And then reopen the legs as
he's pulling his feet apart.

109
00:04:57,390 --> 00:04:59,530
For example here I add a bit

110
00:04:59,530 --> 00:05:02,350
of a glitch in the motion of the knee

111
00:05:02,350 --> 00:05:06,470
where I have a big modification
of the shape of the leg.

112
00:05:06,470 --> 00:05:09,178
I'm just looking at the shape of the legs,

113
00:05:09,178 --> 00:05:11,500
and moving the pole target,

114
00:05:11,500 --> 00:05:14,370
so that I get a smoother
motion of the knee

115
00:05:14,370 --> 00:05:18,118
I will apply exactly the same
process for the left leg.

116
00:05:18,118 --> 00:05:21,010
When you are done with the pole targets,

117
00:05:21,010 --> 00:05:23,170
use the tweaker controller.

118
00:05:23,170 --> 00:05:27,430
To avoid any reversed
bending like this one.

119
00:05:27,430 --> 00:05:29,630
Just scrub frame by frame,

120
00:05:29,630 --> 00:05:33,200
and fix any weird the shape of the knees.

121
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:34,033
In the end,

122
00:05:34,033 --> 00:05:37,493
I think I just needed to
fix a couple of poses.

123
00:05:38,440 --> 00:05:40,220
Once I was done with the back leg,

124
00:05:40,220 --> 00:05:42,805
I've worked with the ends of front leg

125
00:05:42,805 --> 00:05:44,090
of the character,

126
00:05:44,090 --> 00:05:46,390
I've used exactly the same process.

127
00:05:46,390 --> 00:05:50,650
First fixed the Y location
to avoid any sliding

128
00:05:50,650 --> 00:05:54,460
avoid to make too big
change on the Z location,

129
00:05:54,460 --> 00:05:56,020
and made the hands getting

130
00:05:56,020 --> 00:05:58,480
too far away from the tree trunk.

131
00:05:58,480 --> 00:06:00,270
You will see in the next video

132
00:06:00,270 --> 00:06:01,973
in the full time lapse that I've

133
00:06:01,973 --> 00:06:06,973
initially really widely open
the arms using the X location,

134
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:11,130
and then I've tightened them because it

135
00:06:11,130 --> 00:06:13,000
was looking a bit too weird.

136
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,500
Just remember that it's perfectly fine

137
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:18,596
to revise your poses
during the polishing stage.

138
00:06:18,596 --> 00:06:21,510
I've initially posed the four arms

139
00:06:21,510 --> 00:06:23,690
to be very tight to the body

140
00:06:23,690 --> 00:06:26,250
and in the end using the x axis,

141
00:06:26,250 --> 00:06:28,310
I've spread them on the sides

142
00:06:28,310 --> 00:06:30,790
Forget to break the twinning also

143
00:06:30,790 --> 00:06:32,040
on the arms.

144
00:06:32,040 --> 00:06:35,454
And when you are done
polishing the arms controller,

145
00:06:35,454 --> 00:06:39,900
you can use the joint
controller to fix the position

146
00:06:39,900 --> 00:06:41,150
of the elbows.

147
00:06:41,150 --> 00:06:42,660
Again for this process,

148
00:06:42,660 --> 00:06:45,430
it's better to do it frame by frame.

149
00:06:45,430 --> 00:06:47,250
Just make sure that your elbow

150
00:06:47,250 --> 00:06:48,950
is bending in the right way.

151
00:06:48,950 --> 00:06:52,050
So don't forget to rotate
around your character

152
00:06:52,050 --> 00:06:53,220
and you will be done.

153
00:06:53,220 --> 00:06:55,700
The next video will be a time lapse

154
00:06:55,700 --> 00:06:58,480
of all the points we've just seen.

155
00:06:58,480 --> 00:07:00,310
And in the video after,

156
00:07:00,310 --> 00:07:03,470
I will change the timing of the animation,

157
00:07:03,470 --> 00:07:07,630
because I wasn't satisfied
of what I add here.

158
00:07:07,630 --> 00:07:09,760
Don't worry, it's not a big deal.

159
00:07:09,760 --> 00:07:11,950
It will take only few minutes

160
00:07:11,950 --> 00:07:14,710
but it will really improve the animation
