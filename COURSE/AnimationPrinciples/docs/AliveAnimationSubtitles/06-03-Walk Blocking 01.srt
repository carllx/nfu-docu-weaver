1
00:00:00,830 --> 00:00:04,230
- Let's start the blocking
of our walk cycle.

2
00:00:04,230 --> 00:00:07,860
I will start where I've
left in the last chapter

3
00:00:07,860 --> 00:00:10,220
and I will create a new action.

4
00:00:10,220 --> 00:00:12,750
So, I will go into Pose mode,

5
00:00:12,750 --> 00:00:14,200
select my character,

6
00:00:14,200 --> 00:00:18,610
and press this icon to
duplicate the run cycle.

7
00:00:18,610 --> 00:00:22,090
From there, I can rename it
and click the shield icon

8
00:00:22,090 --> 00:00:24,960
to make sure I won't lose this data

9
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:26,880
whenever I restart Blender.

10
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:29,270
Now I will select all the key frames

11
00:00:29,270 --> 00:00:31,050
but the one on frame zero

12
00:00:31,050 --> 00:00:33,440
and I will press X to delete them.

13
00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:36,660
Now we need to make sure
that we have clean channels.

14
00:00:36,660 --> 00:00:39,910
Since we have worked in the
graph editor on many curves,

15
00:00:39,910 --> 00:00:43,290
I need to make sure that
I reset those curves.

16
00:00:43,290 --> 00:00:44,810
In my action editor,

17
00:00:44,810 --> 00:00:48,760
I will press Control+Tab to
switch to the graph editor,

18
00:00:48,760 --> 00:00:51,380
and enable "show hidden."

19
00:00:51,380 --> 00:00:54,090
I will then press Alt+H to make sure

20
00:00:54,090 --> 00:00:56,744
that I reveal all the curves.

21
00:00:56,744 --> 00:00:59,520
And from there, I will
press A to select them all,

22
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:03,240
press the T key and switch
everything to Bezier.

23
00:01:03,240 --> 00:01:05,010
Then I will press the V key

24
00:01:05,010 --> 00:01:07,410
and switch everything to Autoclamp.

25
00:01:07,410 --> 00:01:09,660
Now, everything is reset.

26
00:01:09,660 --> 00:01:11,950
If you have a look to the key frames,

27
00:01:11,950 --> 00:01:14,570
we can see that they have a round shape,

28
00:01:14,570 --> 00:01:17,203
meaning that they are
all set to Autoclamp.

29
00:01:18,430 --> 00:01:20,490
If I switched to Vector, for example,

30
00:01:20,490 --> 00:01:22,070
they become square.

31
00:01:22,070 --> 00:01:23,510
If I switch to Align,

32
00:01:23,510 --> 00:01:26,950
they will have this kind of diamond shape.

33
00:01:26,950 --> 00:01:30,290
Now, we need to reset
the pose of our character

34
00:01:30,290 --> 00:01:32,150
before we start working.

35
00:01:32,150 --> 00:01:33,323
So, I will make sure

36
00:01:33,323 --> 00:01:36,960
that I have all my controllers available.

37
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:40,050
And as you can see
here, my UI didn't load,

38
00:01:40,050 --> 00:01:43,220
So what I will do is open the text editor

39
00:01:43,220 --> 00:01:45,950
and with trident rig script selected,

40
00:01:45,950 --> 00:01:47,760
I will press the play button.

41
00:01:47,760 --> 00:01:49,290
Now to make sure that

42
00:01:49,290 --> 00:01:52,620
it automatically play
whenever I reload the file,

43
00:01:52,620 --> 00:01:56,160
I will go to Text, and enable Registered.

44
00:01:56,160 --> 00:01:57,730
From there, in the rig UI,

45
00:01:57,730 --> 00:02:02,730
I will enable all the layers
and press A in the 3D view

46
00:02:03,120 --> 00:02:05,870
to select all my controllers.

47
00:02:05,870 --> 00:02:10,690
And I will press Alt+R, Alt+G and Alt+S

48
00:02:10,690 --> 00:02:14,180
to reset the rotation scale and location

49
00:02:14,180 --> 00:02:16,110
of all the controllers.

50
00:02:16,110 --> 00:02:17,480
Once I'm done with that,

51
00:02:17,480 --> 00:02:20,070
I can hide the controller
we won't be using.

52
00:02:20,070 --> 00:02:21,760
So we can hide the root,

53
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:23,960
the torso tweak from the time being,

54
00:02:23,960 --> 00:02:25,620
all the face controller,

55
00:02:25,620 --> 00:02:29,170
keep the leg I-case,
keep the arm eighth-case.

56
00:02:29,170 --> 00:02:32,250
While we will be using
them, we can hide the hands.

57
00:02:32,250 --> 00:02:36,000
And we will hide every
weapons controllers.

58
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,330
I will just rotate a bit

59
00:02:37,330 --> 00:02:39,330
the arm of the characters so that he looks

60
00:02:39,330 --> 00:02:42,150
a bit more relaxed and we can get started.

61
00:02:42,150 --> 00:02:45,700
The first pose we are going
to build is the contact pose.

62
00:02:45,700 --> 00:02:47,900
Let's have a quick look to the references

63
00:02:47,900 --> 00:02:51,220
to spot the key features of this pose.

64
00:02:51,220 --> 00:02:54,590
This is the moment where both
feet are contacting the ground

65
00:02:54,590 --> 00:02:58,160
and are further away, one from the other.

66
00:02:58,160 --> 00:03:00,050
Both are on the extreme.

67
00:03:00,050 --> 00:03:02,580
One on the heel, one on the toes.

68
00:03:02,580 --> 00:03:05,520
The hips are slightly tilted up

69
00:03:05,520 --> 00:03:08,020
from the back leg that is pushing.

70
00:03:08,020 --> 00:03:11,040
The chest is slightly tilting the same way

71
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:13,660
as it is transitioning into the next pose

72
00:03:13,660 --> 00:03:15,920
where we will have the contrapposto.

73
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:17,940
But it's twisted the opposite way

74
00:03:17,940 --> 00:03:20,560
compared to the hips toward the front arm.

75
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:22,520
Toward the front arm,

76
00:03:22,520 --> 00:03:25,740
the center of gravity is almost centered,

77
00:03:25,740 --> 00:03:29,620
but it's a bit favorizing the back foot.

78
00:03:29,620 --> 00:03:33,170
Note that the reference on
the right is showing someone

79
00:03:33,170 --> 00:03:34,860
with an athletic walk,

80
00:03:34,860 --> 00:03:38,510
so the arm swing motion is a bit extreme.

81
00:03:38,510 --> 00:03:42,270
We will keep our walk cycle
a little more relaxed,

82
00:03:42,270 --> 00:03:43,970
with less amplitude.

83
00:03:43,970 --> 00:03:47,670
We will start our first
pose by posing the feet.

84
00:03:47,670 --> 00:03:49,100
You may choose to push

85
00:03:49,100 --> 00:03:51,480
whether the left or right foot forward

86
00:03:51,480 --> 00:03:53,240
and the other one backward.

87
00:03:53,240 --> 00:03:56,090
Then we can use the role controller

88
00:03:56,090 --> 00:03:59,020
to raise the toes for the front leg

89
00:03:59,020 --> 00:04:01,680
and raise the heel for the back leg.

90
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:04,110
I will lower a bit the center of gravity

91
00:04:04,110 --> 00:04:07,000
to make sure that the
legs are not stretching.

92
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:10,440
Don't forget to pose the
toes on the front foot

93
00:04:10,440 --> 00:04:13,680
as they are dragging a bit
before they contact the ground.

94
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:15,610
On this walk cycle animation,

95
00:04:15,610 --> 00:04:18,270
I will try not to rotate on the side

96
00:04:18,270 --> 00:04:21,160
or twist the torso root controller.

97
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:23,260
I will slightly rotate it forward

98
00:04:23,260 --> 00:04:26,980
to give a more dynamic
pose to our character.

99
00:04:26,980 --> 00:04:31,340
But we will mainly use
this root torso controller

100
00:04:31,340 --> 00:04:34,840
for the up-and-down and
side-to-side motion.

101
00:04:34,840 --> 00:04:38,540
I have twisted the hips
toward the front foot

102
00:04:38,540 --> 00:04:42,260
and I'm twisting the chest
toward the front arm.

103
00:04:42,260 --> 00:04:45,710
Remember to pose the arms
the opposite way as the foot.

104
00:04:45,710 --> 00:04:49,620
When the left foot is forward,
the right arm is forward.

105
00:04:49,620 --> 00:04:53,070
Also remember that your
elbow is supposed to rotate

106
00:04:53,070 --> 00:04:55,410
only on its local Z axis.

107
00:04:55,410 --> 00:04:59,470
You can't rotate your
elbow around multiple axes.

108
00:04:59,470 --> 00:05:01,790
So when it comes to posing the arm,

109
00:05:01,790 --> 00:05:06,330
I mainly use the arm controller
to orientate the arm.

110
00:05:06,330 --> 00:05:08,440
Another thing to double check so that

111
00:05:08,440 --> 00:05:12,030
we don't get the same problem
as during the run cycle

112
00:05:12,030 --> 00:05:15,230
is to make sure that
both the neck and head

113
00:05:15,230 --> 00:05:17,670
have their rotation fully disabled.

114
00:05:17,670 --> 00:05:20,070
As usual, I'm showing the final pose

115
00:05:20,070 --> 00:05:22,300
we are supposed to reach.

116
00:05:22,300 --> 00:05:25,630
Don't forget to slightly shift
the weight of the character

117
00:05:25,630 --> 00:05:30,070
on its back leg by selecting
the torso root controller

118
00:05:30,070 --> 00:05:33,150
and slightly move it on the X axis.

119
00:05:33,150 --> 00:05:36,460
Left to right motion
will be more pronounced

120
00:05:36,460 --> 00:05:39,490
on the walk cycle than on the run cycle.

121
00:05:39,490 --> 00:05:41,950
Here you can see me
fighting a bit with the pose

122
00:05:41,950 --> 00:05:43,480
of the hips and the chest

123
00:05:43,480 --> 00:05:46,080
because I wasn't looking at the reference.

124
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:49,230
So I was trying to set a contrapposto

125
00:05:49,230 --> 00:05:52,190
while the chest should
be almost horizontal.

126
00:05:52,190 --> 00:05:54,710
The only contrapposto that occur

127
00:05:54,710 --> 00:05:56,160
is the twisting.

128
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:57,260
I'm tweaking the pose

129
00:05:57,260 --> 00:06:00,240
to make sure that my
character look balanced.

130
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:02,670
Take the time to properly
refine this pose,

131
00:06:02,670 --> 00:06:04,950
because this is the
one we are going to use

132
00:06:04,950 --> 00:06:06,950
to build the other ones.

133
00:06:06,950 --> 00:06:10,680
And it will communicate a
lot about your character.

134
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:13,720
From there, I will
re-enable the hand layer

135
00:06:13,720 --> 00:06:16,200
and I will slightly pose the hands.

136
00:06:16,200 --> 00:06:20,120
So I will build a default
pose on one of the hand,

137
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:24,680
by slightly curving the palm
controller and each finger

138
00:06:24,680 --> 00:06:28,030
to make the hand pose a bit more relaxed.

139
00:06:28,030 --> 00:06:31,230
Then I will select all
the left hand controllers.

140
00:06:31,230 --> 00:06:33,150
Press Control+C to copy the pose

141
00:06:33,150 --> 00:06:35,850
and Control+Shift+V to paste it,

142
00:06:35,850 --> 00:06:37,840
mirrored on the other side.

143
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:41,030
So as I explained before,
after watching my references

144
00:06:41,030 --> 00:06:45,320
I've decided to slightly
realign the chest,

145
00:06:45,320 --> 00:06:47,680
to have my shoulders more into

146
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:50,750
an horizontal line as on the reference.

147
00:06:50,750 --> 00:06:53,440
Don't forget to double
check the arm position,

148
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:56,140
the hands position, using the reference,

149
00:06:56,140 --> 00:06:59,610
as this is the extreme pose for both arms.

150
00:06:59,610 --> 00:07:03,790
Then you can push a little bit
the feet toward the inside.

151
00:07:03,790 --> 00:07:07,340
It will look a little more
natural and less robotic.

152
00:07:07,340 --> 00:07:10,230
The more you push the
feet toward the inside

153
00:07:10,230 --> 00:07:13,230
on a central line, the more feminine.

154
00:07:13,230 --> 00:07:18,230
So if you were to animate
a stereotyped sexy woman,

155
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:22,210
you would push the feet
toward a central line.

156
00:07:22,210 --> 00:07:26,170
This is the kind of pose you
will see in a fashion show.

157
00:07:26,170 --> 00:07:28,360
But it doesn't really fit our character

158
00:07:28,360 --> 00:07:31,933
so let's cancel this and
jump into the next video.
