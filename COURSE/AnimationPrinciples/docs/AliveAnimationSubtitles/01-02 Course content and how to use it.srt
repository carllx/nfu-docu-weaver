00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:01,060
- [Instructor] In this video,

2
00:00:01,060 --> 00:00:04,110
we will have a quick look
at the course content

3
00:00:04,110 --> 00:00:05,880
and how to use it.

4
00:00:05,880 --> 00:00:10,140
At this stage, you should have
downloaded all the content.

5
00:00:10,140 --> 00:00:12,930
You will find a read-me.txt file

6
00:00:12,930 --> 00:00:14,600
that I invite you to read

7
00:00:14,600 --> 00:00:17,010
with some legal informations.

8
00:00:17,010 --> 00:00:20,930
And for each chapter, you
will find a zipped file

9
00:00:20,930 --> 00:00:23,660
or multiple zipped files.

10
00:00:23,660 --> 00:00:27,590
I suggest you unzip those
chapters in a specific folder.

11
00:00:27,590 --> 00:00:30,600
The zipped file will
include all the videos

12
00:00:30,600 --> 00:00:34,270
but also all the English
subtitles of those videos.

13
00:00:34,270 --> 00:00:37,840
One of the zip provided
include all the course files.

14
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:41,420
You must unzip those file
in the dedicated folder.

15
00:00:41,420 --> 00:00:43,770
Simply right click on the zip file

16
00:00:43,770 --> 00:00:47,570
and choose Extract to
course files folders.

17
00:00:47,570 --> 00:00:50,010
You will find a dedicated folder

18
00:00:50,010 --> 00:00:52,680
for each chapter of the course.

19
00:00:52,680 --> 00:00:57,190
And those dedicated folders
includes all the Blender files,

20
00:00:57,190 --> 00:01:00,760
textures and whatever
resource you will need

21
00:01:00,760 --> 00:01:02,180
during those chapters.

22
00:01:02,180 --> 00:01:04,940
It's important to keep the structure

23
00:01:04,940 --> 00:01:07,470
and hierarchy of those folders

24
00:01:07,470 --> 00:01:09,730
as it is in the zipped file

25
00:01:09,730 --> 00:01:12,090
because of the most files are linked

26
00:01:12,090 --> 00:01:15,850
or are sourcing textures
with a relative path

27
00:01:15,850 --> 00:01:17,380
into those folder.

28
00:01:17,380 --> 00:01:19,770
You will find one Blender file

29
00:01:19,770 --> 00:01:23,860
or multiple Blender file
per lecture or lesson.

30
00:01:23,860 --> 00:01:25,970
This way you can choose whether to start

31
00:01:25,970 --> 00:01:28,740
from the beginning with your own animation

32
00:01:28,740 --> 00:01:31,620
or to use one of the provided file at,

33
00:01:31,620 --> 00:01:33,820
or to use one of the provided file

34
00:01:33,820 --> 00:01:35,980
at a given point in time.

35
00:01:35,980 --> 00:01:37,950
You will also find video reference

36
00:01:37,950 --> 00:01:40,030
for the specific exercises,

37
00:01:40,030 --> 00:01:43,190
and any other resources
used by the Blender file.

38
00:01:43,190 --> 00:01:45,850
Let's have a quick look
through the course contents.

39
00:01:45,850 --> 00:01:47,500
Two is a must-watch

40
00:01:47,500 --> 00:01:49,662
because this is where you will learn

41
00:01:49,662 --> 00:01:51,343
how Blender deals with data.

42
00:01:52,410 --> 00:01:55,210
And since your job will
be to animate those data,

43
00:01:55,210 --> 00:01:58,520
you'd better be aware of how it works.

44
00:01:58,520 --> 00:01:59,800
This is also the chapter

45
00:01:59,800 --> 00:02:02,120
where you will have your first experience

46
00:02:02,120 --> 00:02:03,570
with the animation tool

47
00:02:03,570 --> 00:02:06,130
and how to read and use them.

48
00:02:06,130 --> 00:02:08,560
The graph editor is often confusing

49
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:10,620
for beginners animator,

50
00:02:10,620 --> 00:02:14,310
so it's very important that
you watch those videos.

51
00:02:14,310 --> 00:02:17,580
This way you'll be prepared
to jump into chapter three.

52
00:02:17,580 --> 00:02:20,450
It's the most extensive
chapter of the course

53
00:02:20,450 --> 00:02:24,080
where you will learn how
to use an armature rig

54
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:28,320
to perform your first
simple polished animation,

55
00:02:28,320 --> 00:02:30,870
to manipulate your first character,

56
00:02:30,870 --> 00:02:34,180
create a full set of animations,

57
00:02:34,180 --> 00:02:39,100
and then combine them to
reproduce this short animation.

58
00:02:39,100 --> 00:02:40,430
If you're a beginner

59
00:02:40,430 --> 00:02:43,990
or have a bit of experience
animating in Blender,

60
00:02:43,990 --> 00:02:47,510
then I advise you to
follow this whole chapter

61
00:02:47,510 --> 00:02:50,380
and do the exercises multiple time

62
00:02:50,380 --> 00:02:52,340
until you get comfortable.

63
00:02:52,340 --> 00:02:55,730
I will repeat this a lot during the course

64
00:02:55,730 --> 00:02:58,500
but animation is an art form.

65
00:02:58,500 --> 00:03:00,800
Failing is totally normal,

66
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:04,960
and only practice will make you progress.

67
00:03:04,960 --> 00:03:07,070
In chapter four, we will focus

68
00:03:07,070 --> 00:03:10,420
on learning other animation technique.

69
00:03:10,420 --> 00:03:13,190
We will create a new set of animation

70
00:03:13,190 --> 00:03:15,220
using this robot rig.

71
00:03:15,220 --> 00:03:18,400
And we will see how we can use constraints

72
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:20,240
and space switching

73
00:03:20,240 --> 00:03:24,340
to generate additional
motion onto our character,

74
00:03:24,340 --> 00:03:28,460
getting convincing result
in a matter of minutes.

75
00:03:28,460 --> 00:03:31,280
We will apply this to a walk cycle,

76
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:32,620
this artillery shot

77
00:03:32,620 --> 00:03:36,630
and also to shoot rockets
from a moving robot.

78
00:03:36,630 --> 00:03:38,230
This way, you will be able

79
00:03:38,230 --> 00:03:42,120
to reproduce all the
animation in this short movie.

80
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:44,467
And for those of you eager to learn

81
00:03:44,467 --> 00:03:47,910
how to create the FXs and the environment,

82
00:03:47,910 --> 00:03:49,320
I've already published

83
00:03:49,320 --> 00:03:52,750
and will published
additional tutorials for free

84
00:03:52,750 --> 00:03:56,840
on my YouTube channel regarding
those specific subjects.

85
00:03:56,840 --> 00:03:58,960
In chapter five and six,

86
00:03:58,960 --> 00:04:02,300
you will be introduced
to character locomotion

87
00:04:02,300 --> 00:04:03,980
and body mechanics

88
00:04:03,980 --> 00:04:06,170
through fully detailed lessons

89
00:04:06,170 --> 00:04:09,610
on how to build a run
cycle and a walk cycle.

90
00:04:09,610 --> 00:04:13,000
We will go deeper into reference analysis,

91
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,747
and I will try to teach you

92
00:04:14,747 --> 00:04:17,060
how to correctly study your reference

93
00:04:17,060 --> 00:04:19,030
and get the best from them.

94
00:04:19,030 --> 00:04:20,660
From there, I will guide you

95
00:04:20,660 --> 00:04:23,030
through the whole blocking stage,

96
00:04:23,030 --> 00:04:24,933
'til the final polishing.

97
00:04:26,450 --> 00:04:29,810
In chapter seven, I will
teach you all my techniques

98
00:04:29,810 --> 00:04:31,680
to get great poses

99
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:34,480
from deep reference analysis

100
00:04:34,480 --> 00:04:38,340
to stylization technique
to push your poses

101
00:04:38,340 --> 00:04:41,530
and the appeal of your
character way further.

102
00:04:41,530 --> 00:04:43,620
Finally, in chapter eight,

103
00:04:43,620 --> 00:04:45,880
the most advanced chapter,

104
00:04:45,880 --> 00:04:48,210
you will apply all what you have learned

105
00:04:48,210 --> 00:04:51,250
during the course to create
this combo animation.

106
00:04:51,250 --> 00:04:53,700
And I'll be there over eight hours

107
00:04:53,700 --> 00:04:56,160
of video to teach you everything

108
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:57,940
from the base blocking

109
00:04:57,940 --> 00:04:59,970
to creating the breakdowns,

110
00:04:59,970 --> 00:05:03,370
the blocking plus, the
first pass of spline

111
00:05:03,370 --> 00:05:05,430
to the final polishing stage,

112
00:05:05,430 --> 00:05:08,470
and adding some details and FXs

113
00:05:08,470 --> 00:05:10,460
so that you can create a great

114
00:05:10,460 --> 00:05:13,400
and polished animation that you'll be able

115
00:05:13,400 --> 00:05:17,263
to proudly feature in your
demo reel or portfolio.
