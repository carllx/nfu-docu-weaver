1
00:00:00,630 --> 00:00:02,130
- [Instructor] The time has finally come

2
00:00:02,130 --> 00:00:05,763
to start polishing our
animation and jump into spline.

3
00:00:06,610 --> 00:00:09,260
To make the 3D space as clear as possible,

4
00:00:09,260 --> 00:00:11,880
I will just hide the camera rig.

5
00:00:11,880 --> 00:00:14,660
From there, we need to
switch our interpolation mode

6
00:00:14,660 --> 00:00:16,920
from step to bezier.

7
00:00:16,920 --> 00:00:19,800
So what I will do is that
in the action editor,

8
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:23,400
I will press Control + Tab to
switch to the graph editor.

9
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:26,730
Then I will make sure that
I display all the curves

10
00:00:26,730 --> 00:00:29,540
by enabling the Show Hidden option.

11
00:00:29,540 --> 00:00:30,600
And on top of this,

12
00:00:30,600 --> 00:00:32,540
I will press Alt + H to make sure

13
00:00:32,540 --> 00:00:35,940
that I have no curve or
transform channel hidden.

14
00:00:35,940 --> 00:00:38,350
From there, we can press
Control + Tab again

15
00:00:38,350 --> 00:00:40,340
and switch to the action editor.

16
00:00:40,340 --> 00:00:43,770
Press A to select all
the keys, and then T,

17
00:00:43,770 --> 00:00:45,000
and choose Bezier.

18
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,970
Then select the punching
bag and do the same.

19
00:00:47,970 --> 00:00:50,050
Now if we play our animation,

20
00:00:50,050 --> 00:00:52,270
it's no longer in step mode.

21
00:00:52,270 --> 00:00:54,830
We have interpolation between the keys.

22
00:00:54,830 --> 00:00:58,280
And since we've built a
very detailed blocking,

23
00:00:58,280 --> 00:01:01,640
our animation already looks pretty good.

24
00:01:01,640 --> 00:01:04,230
This is why I've been very insistent

25
00:01:04,230 --> 00:01:06,890
whenever I was telling you not to jump

26
00:01:06,890 --> 00:01:08,880
into spline too early on,

27
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:13,300
because now our work will
mostly to improve the animation,

28
00:01:13,300 --> 00:01:15,760
rather than fix issues.

29
00:01:15,760 --> 00:01:18,330
Before I jump into the graph editor,

30
00:01:18,330 --> 00:01:21,420
I will rework a bit of the
timing of the animation

31
00:01:21,420 --> 00:01:24,690
by moving some of the keys here and there.

32
00:01:24,690 --> 00:01:27,180
Since we have the bag that is supposed

33
00:01:27,180 --> 00:01:29,720
to be synchronized with the character,

34
00:01:29,720 --> 00:01:31,930
it would be better to use the Dope Sheet

35
00:01:31,930 --> 00:01:35,030
so that we can move all
the keys from the bag

36
00:01:35,030 --> 00:01:37,760
and the character at the same time.

37
00:01:37,760 --> 00:01:38,960
Again, I will make sure

38
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:42,330
that the Show Hidden option is enabled.

39
00:01:42,330 --> 00:01:45,940
And as I want to make sure
I won't be moving the keys

40
00:01:45,940 --> 00:01:47,810
from our camera rig,

41
00:01:47,810 --> 00:01:50,140
I will lock all the channels.

42
00:01:50,140 --> 00:01:52,950
And from there, I will make
some artistical choices.

43
00:01:52,950 --> 00:01:57,670
So it's harder to justify
that pure mechanical choice,

44
00:01:57,670 --> 00:01:59,690
but I felt like the impact of the hook

45
00:01:59,690 --> 00:02:01,010
wasn't that impressive.

46
00:02:01,010 --> 00:02:06,010
So maybe I should hold for a
couple of additional frames

47
00:02:06,270 --> 00:02:08,150
the overshoot of the hook.

48
00:02:08,150 --> 00:02:09,910
So from there what we can do

49
00:02:09,910 --> 00:02:13,890
is select all the key
frames after frame 45,

50
00:02:13,890 --> 00:02:16,070
and we can offset to beat those keys

51
00:02:16,070 --> 00:02:18,713
whether toward the end of the animation

52
00:02:18,713 --> 00:02:20,590
to hold the pose longer.

53
00:02:20,590 --> 00:02:22,590
Or if you want to shorten it,

54
00:02:22,590 --> 00:02:25,970
get it closer to the
beginning of your animation.

55
00:02:25,970 --> 00:02:27,870
The other moment in the animation

56
00:02:27,870 --> 00:02:31,390
I spot wasn't looking
that good at this stage,

57
00:02:31,390 --> 00:02:33,960
so it's very rough, it's very floaty,

58
00:02:33,960 --> 00:02:38,690
but still, you can feel the
animation, is the switch kick.

59
00:02:38,690 --> 00:02:40,690
It's the moment where the character

60
00:02:40,690 --> 00:02:42,620
stepped back into the switch.

61
00:02:42,620 --> 00:02:45,470
I was hesitating whether
to make the character

62
00:02:45,470 --> 00:02:50,220
jump as soon as he
reaches the extreme back,

63
00:02:50,220 --> 00:02:52,800
or make him hold the beat down

64
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:56,070
before he make the jump
to the switch kick.

65
00:02:56,070 --> 00:02:59,070
In the end, I've chosen to make him jump

66
00:02:59,070 --> 00:03:03,170
into the switch kick as soon
as he hit the down pose.

67
00:03:03,170 --> 00:03:06,500
So what I did is that I've
selected all the keys.

68
00:03:06,500 --> 00:03:08,300
As you can see, I've made a test

69
00:03:08,300 --> 00:03:11,390
where I've made his down pose longer,

70
00:03:11,390 --> 00:03:14,140
but then I've moved it backward

71
00:03:14,140 --> 00:03:17,443
so that he instantly jump into the switch.

72
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:21,660
It's now time to jump
into the graph editor.

73
00:03:21,660 --> 00:03:24,800
So I've pressed Control + Tab
to switch to the graph editor.

74
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:27,710
And as always, I will start by polishing

75
00:03:27,710 --> 00:03:29,540
the root of my character.

76
00:03:29,540 --> 00:03:32,430
And I always start with its location.

77
00:03:32,430 --> 00:03:34,730
You know it's like the bouncing ball,

78
00:03:34,730 --> 00:03:37,050
we are not playing with squash and stretch

79
00:03:37,050 --> 00:03:39,060
unless we have figured out the position

80
00:03:39,060 --> 00:03:40,650
of the ball in space.

81
00:03:40,650 --> 00:03:43,290
Now I will press Q to
access my quick favorite

82
00:03:43,290 --> 00:03:45,270
and calculate the motion path

83
00:03:45,270 --> 00:03:47,520
of the current torso controller.

84
00:03:47,520 --> 00:03:50,180
And I will be only
calculating the motion path

85
00:03:50,180 --> 00:03:54,160
from a frame of five to 30 or 25.

86
00:03:54,160 --> 00:03:57,660
Because I will stop polishing
my animation by chunk,

87
00:03:57,660 --> 00:04:00,920
I won't be polishing the
root on the whole animation.

88
00:04:00,920 --> 00:04:04,850
That will be a nightmare to
handle and very odd to track.

89
00:04:04,850 --> 00:04:09,021
So what I do is that I select
a part of the animation

90
00:04:09,021 --> 00:04:11,010
that I feel is clearly defined,

91
00:04:11,010 --> 00:04:13,790
in this case, the jab cross motion.

92
00:04:13,790 --> 00:04:17,890
And I will work on this part
until I feel it's satisfying,

93
00:04:17,890 --> 00:04:19,900
and then move to the next one.

94
00:04:19,900 --> 00:04:22,400
It doesn't mean that I won't come back

95
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:24,370
to this part later on.

96
00:04:24,370 --> 00:04:27,930
But at least I feel like
it's more satisfying

97
00:04:27,930 --> 00:04:30,810
to polish a part, feel like it looks good,

98
00:04:30,810 --> 00:04:33,100
and then jump to the other part,

99
00:04:33,100 --> 00:04:36,280
than trying to polish the
whole animation at once.

100
00:04:36,280 --> 00:04:38,250
Now let's talk about the curve.

101
00:04:38,250 --> 00:04:42,100
What I want to do is to bring
as much contrast and impact

102
00:04:42,100 --> 00:04:44,580
into this animation as possible.

103
00:04:44,580 --> 00:04:46,720
I want it to be super snappy.

104
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:49,920
So the idea is to hold a bit longer

105
00:04:49,920 --> 00:04:52,410
your character back when he's back.

106
00:04:52,410 --> 00:04:54,420
And when he's moving forward,

107
00:04:54,420 --> 00:04:58,150
move it in faster and
jump into the other shoot.

108
00:04:58,150 --> 00:05:00,770
So if we have a look at the edited curve,

109
00:05:00,770 --> 00:05:03,640
the Y channel is the
back and forth channel

110
00:05:03,640 --> 00:05:06,550
of our character, so, basically,

111
00:05:06,550 --> 00:05:10,490
the motion that helps him
to punch into the bag.

112
00:05:10,490 --> 00:05:12,960
As you can see, that from four to eight,

113
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:15,470
the character is slowly moving forward

114
00:05:15,470 --> 00:05:17,900
as he's taking his step forward.

115
00:05:17,900 --> 00:05:20,470
And then, from eight to 12,

116
00:05:20,470 --> 00:05:23,880
he's moving really faster
while he's punching,

117
00:05:23,880 --> 00:05:27,100
while it was way more linear previously.

118
00:05:27,100 --> 00:05:30,870
Then we have a plateau shape
between frame 12 and 16.

119
00:05:30,870 --> 00:05:33,670
But this is the transition into the cross.

120
00:05:33,670 --> 00:05:35,910
So the character is still moving forward,

121
00:05:35,910 --> 00:05:38,580
but at a very slow speed.

122
00:05:38,580 --> 00:05:40,730
And then there is a big drop forward

123
00:05:40,730 --> 00:05:44,320
so that the character move
very fast from from 16 to 18

124
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:47,250
when he's punching with the right cross.

125
00:05:47,250 --> 00:05:48,580
Regarding the Z curve,

126
00:05:48,580 --> 00:05:52,800
I'm just wanting my character
to squat before he pushes.

127
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:55,440
So I further rised the first poses

128
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:58,730
and lowered the Z curve at the beginning.

129
00:05:58,730 --> 00:06:01,317
Then as he push, he's raising a bit,

130
00:06:01,317 --> 00:06:04,340
but he's not jumping,
he's pushing forward.

131
00:06:04,340 --> 00:06:07,250
So don't create a too big overshoot.

132
00:06:07,250 --> 00:06:10,090
Then he's diving into the right cross.

133
00:06:10,090 --> 00:06:12,160
And as he punch, he's going straight.

134
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:14,560
There is a quick dive, then a plateau,

135
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:15,530
then he's recovering.

136
00:06:15,530 --> 00:06:18,840
From there, I've been working
on the rotation of the root.

137
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:21,920
And I did approach the rotation a bit

138
00:06:21,920 --> 00:06:25,000
as I did for the forward momentum,

139
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,750
meaning that I've tried to contrast it.

140
00:06:27,750 --> 00:06:30,230
I'm starting with the X rotation curve,

141
00:06:30,230 --> 00:06:32,820
which allow us to make our character

142
00:06:32,820 --> 00:06:35,120
lean forward and backward.

143
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:37,700
So what I did is that I've just made him

144
00:06:37,700 --> 00:06:39,470
slightly bend backward,

145
00:06:39,470 --> 00:06:42,040
when he was dropping in the beginning,

146
00:06:42,040 --> 00:06:44,480
as his torso is dragging.

147
00:06:44,480 --> 00:06:47,530
And then, I will make
him lean into the punch.

148
00:06:47,530 --> 00:06:50,820
So I haven't moved this curve that much,

149
00:06:50,820 --> 00:06:54,760
because it wasn't needed from
the rocking we have done.

150
00:06:54,760 --> 00:06:59,470
The curve I did put more work
on was the Z rotation curve,

151
00:06:59,470 --> 00:07:03,480
because at this stage, it's
allows the character to twist

152
00:07:03,480 --> 00:07:07,430
and the power of a punch
is all about twisting.

153
00:07:07,430 --> 00:07:10,240
In the beginning when the
character is moving forward,

154
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:12,070
I've input the new information

155
00:07:12,070 --> 00:07:14,770
we didn't have during the blocking,

156
00:07:14,770 --> 00:07:17,570
is that I've slightly pushed up the curve

157
00:07:17,570 --> 00:07:20,240
so that the torso of the
character is opening a bit,

158
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:22,660
and it creates a little anticipation

159
00:07:22,660 --> 00:07:25,470
for the left jab that will
twist the opposite way

160
00:07:25,470 --> 00:07:26,850
a couple of frames later.

161
00:07:26,850 --> 00:07:29,340
Then to bring contrast to the animation,

162
00:07:29,340 --> 00:07:31,530
what I did is that I
created a slight plot.

163
00:07:31,530 --> 00:07:34,160
And then we are rapidly transitioning

164
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:38,020
into the opposite twisting
during the right cross

165
00:07:38,020 --> 00:07:40,520
and there is a very slight overshoot.

166
00:07:40,520 --> 00:07:45,160
Instead of our initial stimulus
with our curve we have here,

167
00:07:45,160 --> 00:07:48,150
I have something that is more contrasted.

168
00:07:48,150 --> 00:07:51,120
On there, I'm taking my
character from all angle

169
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:53,970
and I work on the other
curve just to eliminate

170
00:07:53,970 --> 00:07:57,760
any pops or any weird
changing the direction.

171
00:07:57,760 --> 00:08:01,790
For example, here, the X
location of the character

172
00:08:01,790 --> 00:08:03,860
is going right, then left, then right.

173
00:08:03,860 --> 00:08:06,350
So I'm just stabilizing the character

174
00:08:06,350 --> 00:08:09,850
while he's punching with his right cross,

175
00:08:09,850 --> 00:08:13,450
his weight is going over
the left leg, and that's it.

176
00:08:13,450 --> 00:08:15,670
He's no longer bouncing right and left.

177
00:08:15,670 --> 00:08:17,210
But once I'm done with my root,

178
00:08:17,210 --> 00:08:19,210
I generally work on the feet.

179
00:08:19,210 --> 00:08:21,130
That's because the contacting point

180
00:08:21,130 --> 00:08:23,840
has a lot of influence
on the rest of the body,

181
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:26,950
so I like to time them
as soon as possible.

182
00:08:26,950 --> 00:08:30,140
I want to make the foot
accelerating forward,

183
00:08:30,140 --> 00:08:31,450
so easing forward,

184
00:08:31,450 --> 00:08:33,740
by scaling the first pose.

185
00:08:33,740 --> 00:08:36,780
And I want to get rid of
this straight leg pose

186
00:08:36,780 --> 00:08:39,070
that doesn't look natural at all,

187
00:08:39,070 --> 00:08:42,260
so I will offset the curve by one frame.

188
00:08:42,260 --> 00:08:44,700
Then I've converted it to vector

189
00:08:44,700 --> 00:08:47,720
because I want the foot
to plant on the ground

190
00:08:47,720 --> 00:08:49,730
so it does a hard stop.

191
00:08:49,730 --> 00:08:51,680
And from there, I will duplicate

192
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:53,530
a couple of key of the Z curve

193
00:08:53,530 --> 00:08:58,020
and slightly push it up at the
time the foot is traveling.

194
00:08:58,020 --> 00:09:00,270
This will create a subtle step,

195
00:09:00,270 --> 00:09:02,880
instead of having the foot
sliding on the ground.

196
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:05,740
And we can quickly work
on the heel controller

197
00:09:05,740 --> 00:09:07,840
using the X rotation.

198
00:09:07,840 --> 00:09:09,960
As the character move forward,

199
00:09:09,960 --> 00:09:12,260
his weight is more on to the left leg.

200
00:09:12,260 --> 00:09:14,440
So we can lower a bit the heel,

201
00:09:14,440 --> 00:09:16,810
slightly raise it mid-air,

202
00:09:16,810 --> 00:09:19,880
and then set it to zero and to vector

203
00:09:19,880 --> 00:09:22,790
and just half turn the foot
contact with the ground,

204
00:09:22,790 --> 00:09:25,520
so that the heel will slam on the ground.

205
00:09:25,520 --> 00:09:27,099
Now you can work on the bit

206
00:09:27,099 --> 00:09:29,650
of overlapping motion for the toes.

207
00:09:29,650 --> 00:09:32,410
Select the main toe controller.

208
00:09:32,410 --> 00:09:34,190
Once the leg has left the ground,

209
00:09:34,190 --> 00:09:36,470
rotate a bit the toes down

210
00:09:36,470 --> 00:09:39,540
as they are dragging
toward the previous pose.

211
00:09:39,540 --> 00:09:41,800
And as the leg touch the ground,

212
00:09:41,800 --> 00:09:44,010
rotate them up a bit.

213
00:09:44,010 --> 00:09:46,110
And then, one or two frame later,

214
00:09:46,110 --> 00:09:47,710
flatten them on the ground.

215
00:09:47,710 --> 00:09:49,890
From there we can work on the right foot.

216
00:09:49,890 --> 00:09:51,790
And it doesn't feel natural at all

217
00:09:51,790 --> 00:09:53,760
to have the right foot moving

218
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:56,010
at the same time as the front foot

219
00:09:56,010 --> 00:09:58,600
as if our character was floating.

220
00:09:58,600 --> 00:10:02,360
So we need to offset the
motion by at least one frame.

221
00:10:02,360 --> 00:10:05,350
This will straighten a bit the back leg

222
00:10:05,350 --> 00:10:08,669
so it feels way more
natural that the back leg

223
00:10:08,669 --> 00:10:12,580
is getting pulled and no longer pushing.

224
00:10:12,580 --> 00:10:16,430
It's pushing while throwing the left jab,

225
00:10:16,430 --> 00:10:20,120
but then it's getting dragged by the body.

226
00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:22,010
Since it's sliding on the ground,

227
00:10:22,010 --> 00:10:25,320
we don't have to work
on the Z location curve.

228
00:10:25,320 --> 00:10:27,530
But one thing that is bothering me

229
00:10:27,530 --> 00:10:29,700
is the orientation of the knee.

230
00:10:29,700 --> 00:10:32,640
It's a lot pointing on the outside.

231
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:36,320
So I will rework rapidly
the position of the knee

232
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:39,210
by changing the position
of the pole target

233
00:10:39,210 --> 00:10:43,743
and offsetting it mainly
using the X location curve.

234
00:10:45,635 --> 00:10:47,400
For this specific case,

235
00:10:47,400 --> 00:10:49,560
don't focus on the graph editor.

236
00:10:49,560 --> 00:10:51,890
Just focus on the shape of the leg

237
00:10:51,890 --> 00:10:55,380
and remember that your
knee is more or less

238
00:10:55,380 --> 00:10:57,240
aligned with your foot.

239
00:10:57,240 --> 00:11:00,720
So having the knee pointing
to the outside is very weird.

240
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:02,323
I'm just fixing this.
