00:00:00,870 --> 00:00:01,703
- [Instructor] In this video,

2
00:00:01,703 --> 00:00:03,830
we will continue on using space switching

3
00:00:03,830 --> 00:00:07,120
to finish the animation of our character.

4
00:00:07,120 --> 00:00:09,140
I will slightly speed up the video

5
00:00:09,140 --> 00:00:12,460
since it's going to be
very repetitive based

6
00:00:12,460 --> 00:00:14,550
on what we have done just before.

7
00:00:14,550 --> 00:00:16,500
We will start with the antenna.

8
00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:18,960
They can only rotate on one axis

9
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:20,270
and they can't move.

10
00:00:20,270 --> 00:00:23,850
So we will directly use
a tracking constraint.

11
00:00:23,850 --> 00:00:25,640
First, we need to align our empty,

12
00:00:25,640 --> 00:00:27,620
so we add a copy transform.

13
00:00:27,620 --> 00:00:29,810
We source one of the antenna,

14
00:00:29,810 --> 00:00:31,970
apply the visual transform,

15
00:00:31,970 --> 00:00:35,070
get rid of the constraint
and then offset the empty

16
00:00:35,070 --> 00:00:36,430
on the y-axis.

17
00:00:36,430 --> 00:00:38,930
Then add to it a child of constraint,

18
00:00:38,930 --> 00:00:41,150
source the rig and source
one of the antenna,

19
00:00:41,150 --> 00:00:45,340
click the set inverse
and bake the animation.

20
00:00:45,340 --> 00:00:48,230
From there, select the first antenna,

21
00:00:48,230 --> 00:00:52,490
add a locked track
constraint, source the empty.

22
00:00:52,490 --> 00:00:54,597
The track axis is positive y

23
00:00:54,597 --> 00:00:58,240
and we want to rotate around the x-axis.

24
00:00:58,240 --> 00:01:02,560
From there, we can get rid of
all the undesired channels.

25
00:01:02,560 --> 00:01:04,880
Make the Z location curve cycling

26
00:01:04,880 --> 00:01:07,490
and offset it by a couple of frames.

27
00:01:07,490 --> 00:01:10,980
Then you can play on the
influence of the constraint

28
00:01:10,980 --> 00:01:14,450
if you want to reduce the
amplitude of the motion.

29
00:01:14,450 --> 00:01:16,810
Remember that offsetting the curve

30
00:01:16,810 --> 00:01:18,738
will change the timing

31
00:01:18,738 --> 00:01:21,930
and changing the influence
of the constraint

32
00:01:21,930 --> 00:01:25,440
will change the spacing or
the amplitude of the motion.

33
00:01:25,440 --> 00:01:28,260
From there, we can bake
the action onto the bone,

34
00:01:28,260 --> 00:01:31,420
get rid of the useless transform channels

35
00:01:31,420 --> 00:01:35,790
and since both antennas
were originally aligned,

36
00:01:35,790 --> 00:01:38,863
we can directly constraint the big antenna

37
00:01:38,863 --> 00:01:40,320
with the empty.

38
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:43,900
Just go back into pose
mode on to the armature,

39
00:01:43,900 --> 00:01:46,590
select the antenna, go
into the bone constraint,

40
00:01:46,590 --> 00:01:49,020
add a locked track constraint,

41
00:01:49,020 --> 00:01:51,860
source the empty, track with y,

42
00:01:51,860 --> 00:01:55,610
rotate along x and check the animation.

43
00:01:55,610 --> 00:01:58,120
Since this antenna is slightly bigger,

44
00:01:58,120 --> 00:02:00,400
it will have a bit more motion

45
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:04,420
and I've also decided to
offset the empty curve

46
00:02:04,420 --> 00:02:06,210
by one additional frame.

47
00:02:06,210 --> 00:02:10,530
This way, the big antenna will
be slightly delayed compared

48
00:02:10,530 --> 00:02:13,040
to the motion of the small antenna.

49
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:16,010
And we will have a more
interesting motion.

50
00:02:16,010 --> 00:02:17,960
Then I've baked the action

51
00:02:17,960 --> 00:02:19,670
and cleaned my curve.

52
00:02:19,670 --> 00:02:22,230
Now that the antennas are done,

53
00:02:22,230 --> 00:02:24,720
I will unhide all the controllers,

54
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:27,860
select my visibility property bone

55
00:02:27,860 --> 00:02:29,390
and display the arms

56
00:02:29,390 --> 00:02:31,930
and we will work on both arms.

57
00:02:31,930 --> 00:02:34,960
The idea is to input a
slight rotation delay

58
00:02:34,960 --> 00:02:37,320
on the shoulders of the robot.

59
00:02:37,320 --> 00:02:40,600
To do so, we will again use aim space

60
00:02:40,600 --> 00:02:43,290
and a locked track constraint.

61
00:02:43,290 --> 00:02:46,230
I will first align my empty

62
00:02:46,230 --> 00:02:50,070
by adding to it a copy
transform constraint.

63
00:02:50,070 --> 00:02:51,800
To work a little faster,

64
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:55,700
I've just copied the name
of the arm controller.

65
00:02:55,700 --> 00:02:59,200
This way, when I'm adding
the copy transform constraint

66
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:01,730
to the empty, I can source the rig

67
00:03:01,730 --> 00:03:05,650
and then just paste the
name in the bone field.

68
00:03:05,650 --> 00:03:08,830
As the empty is now aligned
with the arm controller,

69
00:03:08,830 --> 00:03:11,480
I will apply the visual transform,

70
00:03:11,480 --> 00:03:14,090
then get rid of its constraint

71
00:03:14,090 --> 00:03:18,070
and offset it on the x-axis on the side.

72
00:03:18,070 --> 00:03:22,510
Then as usual, I will add
a child of constraint,

73
00:03:22,510 --> 00:03:26,190
source the armature, then the arm.r,

74
00:03:26,190 --> 00:03:30,060
click the set inverse
to reset the position

75
00:03:30,060 --> 00:03:31,810
and bake the action.

76
00:03:31,810 --> 00:03:34,120
I will get rid of the useless curve

77
00:03:34,120 --> 00:03:35,930
and then for the remaining one,

78
00:03:35,930 --> 00:03:37,480
I will make them cycle,

79
00:03:37,480 --> 00:03:41,260
pressing Shift + E, click make cyclic.

80
00:03:41,260 --> 00:03:44,430
Then we will get back to our controller,

81
00:03:44,430 --> 00:03:46,900
go to the bone constraint

82
00:03:46,900 --> 00:03:51,380
and we need to add a locked
track constraint pointing

83
00:03:51,380 --> 00:03:56,380
toward the negative x-axis and
rotating around the y-axis.

84
00:03:57,320 --> 00:04:00,010
So in the constraint, I
will source the empty,

85
00:04:00,010 --> 00:04:02,310
choose the track axis minus X

86
00:04:02,310 --> 00:04:06,020
and choose the locked axis y-axis.

87
00:04:06,020 --> 00:04:08,720
Now I believe that you
do know the process.

88
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:12,700
Whenever I move the empty,
the arm will follow.

89
00:04:12,700 --> 00:04:17,060
So I can offset the
animation curve of the empty

90
00:04:17,060 --> 00:04:19,810
and then bake back the motion.

91
00:04:19,810 --> 00:04:21,450
Don't hesitate to play a bit

92
00:04:21,450 --> 00:04:24,270
with the animation curve of the empty.

93
00:04:24,270 --> 00:04:28,040
If you scale it on the y-axis
using the bounding box,

94
00:04:28,040 --> 00:04:30,930
you will increase the
amplitude of the motion.

95
00:04:30,930 --> 00:04:33,480
Don't hesitate to experiment again.

96
00:04:33,480 --> 00:04:36,453
If you fail, you just
need to rebake the motion.

97
00:04:36,453 --> 00:04:38,910
So as I'm happy with the result,

98
00:04:38,910 --> 00:04:43,800
I will bake the action onto
the arm right controller,

99
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:46,110
get rid of the transform channels

100
00:04:46,110 --> 00:04:49,380
that are useless and I
will repeat the process

101
00:04:49,380 --> 00:04:51,650
on the left arm

102
00:04:51,650 --> 00:04:55,490
and also the connection
between the rocket launcher

103
00:04:55,490 --> 00:04:57,230
and the left arm.

104
00:04:57,230 --> 00:05:00,470
So I will leave you there
with a little time lapse

105
00:05:00,470 --> 00:05:03,093
and we'll go ahead at 7:54.

106
00:05:05,111 --> 00:05:07,861
(tranquil music)

107
00:07:55,780 --> 00:07:57,740
Now we can work on the mini gun.

108
00:07:57,740 --> 00:08:00,510
It has already a track mechanism.

109
00:08:00,510 --> 00:08:03,970
So we can go ahead with
a simple copy location

110
00:08:03,970 --> 00:08:07,240
of the empty, source the mini gun target

111
00:08:07,240 --> 00:08:08,670
and bake the motion.

112
00:08:08,670 --> 00:08:10,870
As the action is baked on the empty,

113
00:08:10,870 --> 00:08:13,440
I will select the mini gun controller,

114
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:15,640
add a copy location constraint

115
00:08:15,640 --> 00:08:17,230
and source the empty.

116
00:08:17,230 --> 00:08:18,607
As we did for the head,

117
00:08:18,607 --> 00:08:22,020
I'd like to remove a bit
of the bounce we have

118
00:08:22,020 --> 00:08:24,410
on the Z location axis

119
00:08:24,410 --> 00:08:25,970
for the mini gun

120
00:08:25,970 --> 00:08:29,255
because it looked like
it's not very controlled

121
00:08:29,255 --> 00:08:30,930
by the robot.

122
00:08:30,930 --> 00:08:34,700
So having a bit of
follow-through motion is okay

123
00:08:34,700 --> 00:08:38,460
but too much make it looks
like it's very clanky

124
00:08:38,460 --> 00:08:40,990
and not a very reliable weapon.

125
00:08:40,990 --> 00:08:45,520
So what I'm doing, I'm first
smoothing the Z location curve

126
00:08:45,520 --> 00:08:46,840
of the empty.

127
00:08:46,840 --> 00:08:49,140
Getting rid of the bumps.

128
00:08:49,140 --> 00:08:54,140
And since we have two up and
down motion over the 72 frame,

129
00:08:54,670 --> 00:08:57,160
I can work on half of this curve

130
00:08:57,160 --> 00:09:00,200
and then remove the second half.

131
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:02,680
The cyclic modifier will take care

132
00:09:02,680 --> 00:09:06,020
of repeating the curve seamlessly.

133
00:09:06,020 --> 00:09:07,850
So what you need to understand

134
00:09:07,850 --> 00:09:10,800
is the time you will
save using this method

135
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:12,930
for this kind of motion.

136
00:09:12,930 --> 00:09:15,950
We will use space switching
later in the course

137
00:09:15,950 --> 00:09:18,540
to smooth some animation

138
00:09:18,540 --> 00:09:20,960
but for this kind of robotic motion,

139
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:22,850
that's so handy.

140
00:09:22,850 --> 00:09:26,330
I will repeat the process
on the X location curve

141
00:09:26,330 --> 00:09:30,410
to kind of remove a bit of the
noise we have in the motion.

142
00:09:30,410 --> 00:09:34,320
So this time, I will have
to work on the whole curve

143
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:36,870
because the left to left motion uses

144
00:09:36,870 --> 00:09:41,870
the 72 frame of the whole
cycle to be performed.

145
00:09:42,110 --> 00:09:43,690
The idea is just to get rid

146
00:09:43,690 --> 00:09:46,420
of the few glitches we have on the curve.

147
00:09:46,420 --> 00:09:49,400
What is so powerful about aim space

148
00:09:49,400 --> 00:09:50,640
and this technique

149
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:53,640
is that even if the root of the mini gun,

150
00:09:53,640 --> 00:09:57,580
the point where it is
attached is very shaky

151
00:09:57,580 --> 00:10:01,120
because we add a lot of
noise and secondary motion,

152
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:04,040
if we have a smooth motion of the target,

153
00:10:04,040 --> 00:10:09,030
then the tip of the gun will
have a very smooth motion

154
00:10:09,030 --> 00:10:13,710
and so you can create very
complex animation with ease

155
00:10:13,710 --> 00:10:16,360
while that will be almost impossible

156
00:10:16,360 --> 00:10:19,620
to counter animate in a classic fashion.

157
00:10:19,620 --> 00:10:22,540
For the rocket launcher cap motion,

158
00:10:22,540 --> 00:10:26,620
I will simply use a
locked track constraint.

159
00:10:26,620 --> 00:10:28,810
It's gonna be the usual process,

160
00:10:28,810 --> 00:10:30,920
so I will repeat it for you.

161
00:10:30,920 --> 00:10:34,080
First, we need to add a
copy transform to the empty,

162
00:10:34,080 --> 00:10:35,940
apply the visual transform,

163
00:10:35,940 --> 00:10:37,460
get rid of the constraint,

164
00:10:37,460 --> 00:10:40,950
offset it, in this case, on the y-axis,

165
00:10:40,950 --> 00:10:43,310
add a child of constraint.

166
00:10:43,310 --> 00:10:45,290
As a target, choose the armature

167
00:10:45,290 --> 00:10:48,370
and the cap controller, set inverse

168
00:10:48,370 --> 00:10:50,260
and then bake the action.

169
00:10:50,260 --> 00:10:52,000
Get rid of the useless curve.

170
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,050
Again, you don't need to do it.

171
00:10:54,050 --> 00:10:57,480
I prefer to do it for
demonstration purpose.

172
00:10:57,480 --> 00:10:59,430
Then onto the controller,

173
00:10:59,430 --> 00:11:01,800
add a locked track constraint.

174
00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:04,030
From there, I get back onto the empty

175
00:11:04,030 --> 00:11:06,320
and make the Z curve cycling.

176
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:09,680
Offset it in time and see happened.

177
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:11,520
The only little difference here

178
00:11:11,520 --> 00:11:15,620
is that our controller
has already a constraint

179
00:11:15,620 --> 00:11:17,190
that belong to the rig.

180
00:11:17,190 --> 00:11:20,190
So this time when I will bake the action,

181
00:11:20,190 --> 00:11:23,210
I will uncheck the clear constraint box.

182
00:11:23,210 --> 00:11:25,330
It will bake the action as usual

183
00:11:25,330 --> 00:11:27,240
but now I can manually get rid

184
00:11:27,240 --> 00:11:30,350
of the locked track constraint

185
00:11:30,350 --> 00:11:33,620
without losing the original constraint

186
00:11:33,620 --> 00:11:36,600
that has been put there
by your lovely rigger.

187
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:40,350
The last step is to work
on our artillery piece,

188
00:11:40,350 --> 00:11:42,430
so using the visibility bone,

189
00:11:42,430 --> 00:11:46,220
I will enable the
visibility of the artillery.

190
00:11:46,220 --> 00:11:48,720
It can move up and down and rotate a bit.

191
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:51,630
So what we will do is
that we will first use

192
00:11:51,630 --> 00:11:53,860
our copy location constraint

193
00:11:53,860 --> 00:11:57,680
to create the up and down
follow-through motion

194
00:11:57,680 --> 00:12:01,200
and then a tracking constraint
to get the rotation.

195
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:02,810
With my empty selected,

196
00:12:02,810 --> 00:12:05,440
I've added a copy location constraint.

197
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:08,170
I've sourced the armature,

198
00:12:08,170 --> 00:12:11,530
then sourced the
artillery pivot controller

199
00:12:11,530 --> 00:12:13,150
and baked the action.

200
00:12:13,150 --> 00:12:15,580
We can then reverse the constraint,

201
00:12:15,580 --> 00:12:18,260
meaning that I will select the controller,

202
00:12:18,260 --> 00:12:20,420
add a copy location constraint

203
00:12:20,420 --> 00:12:21,940
and source the empty.

204
00:12:21,940 --> 00:12:24,550
Now I feel like I've repeated this enough

205
00:12:24,550 --> 00:12:27,010
but I will go ahead either way.

206
00:12:27,010 --> 00:12:30,449
I will slightly offset
the Z location curve

207
00:12:30,449 --> 00:12:33,558
just after I've made it cycling.

208
00:12:33,558 --> 00:12:35,050
I like the result,

209
00:12:35,050 --> 00:12:39,350
so I will bake this action
onto the controller.

210
00:12:39,350 --> 00:12:41,567
So I need to select my armature,

211
00:12:41,567 --> 00:12:44,630
select the controller, click bake action

212
00:12:44,630 --> 00:12:47,100
and this time, I can get
rid of the constraint

213
00:12:47,100 --> 00:12:50,520
by checking the clear constraint option.

214
00:12:50,520 --> 00:12:52,710
Let's now work in aim space.

215
00:12:52,710 --> 00:12:55,920
So I will select back the empty,

216
00:12:55,920 --> 00:12:58,770
add to it a copy transform constraint

217
00:12:58,770 --> 00:13:03,770
to align it with the controller
of the artillery piece.

218
00:13:04,030 --> 00:13:08,350
Then as usual, I will
apply the visual transform,

219
00:13:08,350 --> 00:13:10,410
get rid of the constraint

220
00:13:10,410 --> 00:13:13,620
and offset it on the y-axis.

221
00:13:13,620 --> 00:13:16,160
Then we need to add a child of constraint,

222
00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:20,620
source the armature, source
the artillery pivot controller,

223
00:13:20,620 --> 00:13:23,290
click the set inverse to rest the position

224
00:13:23,290 --> 00:13:25,530
and bake the action.

225
00:13:25,530 --> 00:13:29,050
Then I need to use a
locked track constraint

226
00:13:29,050 --> 00:13:30,380
onto the artillery

227
00:13:30,380 --> 00:13:34,660
since it can only rotate around its x-axis

228
00:13:34,660 --> 00:13:38,000
and the forward axis will be -y

229
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,720
and the rotation axis will be x.

230
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:43,540
From there, I will
repeat the process I did

231
00:13:43,540 --> 00:13:45,130
on the mini gun.

232
00:13:45,130 --> 00:13:49,870
I want to show that this piece
of artillery is very heavy.

233
00:13:49,870 --> 00:13:52,400
So I don't want too much glitches

234
00:13:52,400 --> 00:13:55,800
and too much bounces onto its animation.

235
00:13:55,800 --> 00:13:58,440
Since we are using the up and down motion,

236
00:13:58,440 --> 00:14:01,590
we can work on half of the curve

237
00:14:01,590 --> 00:14:04,300
and then what I will do
is that I will remove

238
00:14:04,300 --> 00:14:08,420
as much keys as needed to smooth the curve

239
00:14:08,420 --> 00:14:12,030
and get a very smooth motion of the tip

240
00:14:12,030 --> 00:14:14,400
of the artillery cannon.

241
00:14:14,400 --> 00:14:18,120
Again and again don't
hesitate to remove keys.

242
00:14:18,120 --> 00:14:19,850
Don't hesitate to fail

243
00:14:19,850 --> 00:14:22,430
because you can just rebake the action

244
00:14:22,430 --> 00:14:24,250
and start over again.

245
00:14:24,250 --> 00:14:25,870
That's very fast.

246
00:14:25,870 --> 00:14:28,490
It's a very iterative process

247
00:14:28,490 --> 00:14:31,480
until you get to the results you want

248
00:14:31,480 --> 00:14:33,410
and that's a very easy process.

249
00:14:33,410 --> 00:14:36,210
So in a way, that's very creative.

250
00:14:36,210 --> 00:14:38,910
What is super interesting about this piece

251
00:14:38,910 --> 00:14:41,680
is again the root or the pace

252
00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:44,360
of the artillery is shaking a lot

253
00:14:44,360 --> 00:14:46,850
while the tip of the artillery

254
00:14:46,850 --> 00:14:49,854
will be moving in a smoother fashion.

255
00:14:49,854 --> 00:14:54,350
This bring a lot of
texture to your animation.

256
00:14:54,350 --> 00:14:56,600
And while it can be very subtle,

257
00:14:56,600 --> 00:14:58,540
all those little variation

258
00:14:58,540 --> 00:15:00,543
in the motion of your character

259
00:15:00,543 --> 00:15:03,610
will make this robot believable.

260
00:15:03,610 --> 00:15:06,090
And while it's a piece of machinery,

261
00:15:06,090 --> 00:15:10,680
it's also a way to put
life into this character.

262
00:15:10,680 --> 00:15:12,640
What makes it alive

263
00:15:12,640 --> 00:15:16,570
is that this robot is
communicating something.

264
00:15:16,570 --> 00:15:19,560
Weight, strength, power,

265
00:15:19,560 --> 00:15:23,200
that's some kind of dreadful
character we have here.

266
00:15:23,200 --> 00:15:26,220
So as we are almost done
with this animation,

267
00:15:26,220 --> 00:15:29,380
take the time to watch it entirely.

268
00:15:29,380 --> 00:15:33,470
I feel like the head
motion is a bit too strong.

269
00:15:33,470 --> 00:15:38,005
So what I can do now is simply
take the head controller

270
00:15:38,005 --> 00:15:42,406
and reduce the amplitude
of the curve I want.

271
00:15:42,406 --> 00:15:45,860
In this case, I feel like
the up and down motion

272
00:15:45,860 --> 00:15:46,960
is a bit too strong.

273
00:15:46,960 --> 00:15:50,145
So I will head up to the Z location curve

274
00:15:50,145 --> 00:15:53,070
and I can see that my 2D cursor

275
00:15:53,070 --> 00:15:56,380
is currently aligned with the value zero,

276
00:15:56,380 --> 00:15:58,620
which means no motion.

277
00:15:58,620 --> 00:16:01,960
So I can switch to the 2D cursor pivot

278
00:16:01,960 --> 00:16:06,030
and scale the curve down on the y-axis

279
00:16:06,030 --> 00:16:08,380
and it will reduce the amplitude

280
00:16:08,380 --> 00:16:11,330
of the up and down motion of the head.

281
00:16:11,330 --> 00:16:13,780
And since we've baked all the motion

282
00:16:13,780 --> 00:16:17,220
of all the other parts
in their local space

283
00:16:17,220 --> 00:16:21,020
and they are kind of
attached one to the other,

284
00:16:21,020 --> 00:16:24,550
whenever we modify one piece in this way,

285
00:16:24,550 --> 00:16:26,020
the other follow.

286
00:16:26,020 --> 00:16:30,302
So if I want, I can select
the cap of the rocket launcher

287
00:16:30,302 --> 00:16:34,160
and increase the amplitude of the rotation

288
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:36,150
and get more motion.

289
00:16:36,150 --> 00:16:38,570
I can also offset the whole curve

290
00:16:38,570 --> 00:16:43,570
on the y-axis and change the
whole orientation of the cap.

291
00:16:43,710 --> 00:16:46,980
And here we are, in a very short time,

292
00:16:46,980 --> 00:16:50,613
we were able to animate
this full character

293
00:16:50,613 --> 00:16:55,363
with a lot of variety, texture
and interesting motions.
