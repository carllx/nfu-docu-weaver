1
00:00:00,110 --> 00:00:02,530
- [Instructor] We still
have a couple of breakdowns

2
00:00:02,530 --> 00:00:04,960
to add to our current animation,

3
00:00:04,960 --> 00:00:07,708
but before we do so
I'd like to give myself

4
00:00:07,708 --> 00:00:10,370
some space on the action editor.

5
00:00:10,370 --> 00:00:12,660
As explained before, for the time being,

6
00:00:12,660 --> 00:00:14,900
I'm not working on the timing

7
00:00:14,900 --> 00:00:17,900
of my animation, only the poses.

8
00:00:17,900 --> 00:00:20,800
So I want to move all
the poses of my character

9
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:23,970
and the punching bag every five frames.

10
00:00:23,970 --> 00:00:27,240
So instead of working on
the action of the character

11
00:00:27,240 --> 00:00:30,170
and the action of the bag separately,

12
00:00:30,170 --> 00:00:32,280
I will switch to the dope sheet.

13
00:00:32,280 --> 00:00:36,190
The dope sheet will expose me
all the keys frame available

14
00:00:36,190 --> 00:00:38,000
in the actual blender scene.

15
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:41,360
If I collapse the action
details in the dope sheet,

16
00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:45,450
we can see that both the Trident
and punching bag armature

17
00:00:45,450 --> 00:00:49,560
are listed in the dope sheet,
along with their own actions.

18
00:00:49,560 --> 00:00:53,090
And since we were posing
those two in sync,

19
00:00:53,090 --> 00:00:55,060
their key frame are aligned.

20
00:00:55,060 --> 00:00:57,640
So by clicking the summary key,

21
00:00:57,640 --> 00:01:00,638
I can select all the
keys for both the action

22
00:01:00,638 --> 00:01:02,719
and offset them in time.

23
00:01:02,719 --> 00:01:06,470
From there, back onto
my current animation,

24
00:01:06,470 --> 00:01:09,730
I will select the summary keys

25
00:01:09,730 --> 00:01:13,470
and position them every five frames.

26
00:01:13,470 --> 00:01:16,670
This is a good moment to
review the different poses

27
00:01:16,670 --> 00:01:19,480
and see how they flow one with the other.

28
00:01:19,480 --> 00:01:21,060
And this is generally the time

29
00:01:21,060 --> 00:01:23,740
where I find tweak some of the poses.

30
00:01:23,740 --> 00:01:26,130
I may push them a little more.

31
00:01:26,130 --> 00:01:28,997
You may spot weird poses of the shoulder

32
00:01:28,997 --> 00:01:31,910
or the shape of the arms or the position

33
00:01:31,910 --> 00:01:33,880
of the center of gravity compared

34
00:01:33,880 --> 00:01:36,280
to the previous or next pose.

35
00:01:36,280 --> 00:01:38,650
Since it's a creative process,

36
00:01:38,650 --> 00:01:43,610
it's sometimes hard to
clearly explain what I'm doing

37
00:01:43,610 --> 00:01:46,400
because it's a lot about feeling.

38
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:49,670
And when you scrub through
your different poses,

39
00:01:49,670 --> 00:01:52,970
you may feel that something
is wrong or that something

40
00:01:52,970 --> 00:01:55,710
could be improving the flow of your poses,

41
00:01:55,710 --> 00:01:58,653
and the blocking stage
is the moment to do it.

42
00:02:00,050 --> 00:02:03,690
The next breakdown I'm
going to do is the jump

43
00:02:03,690 --> 00:02:05,800
during the switch for the switch kick.

44
00:02:05,800 --> 00:02:09,110
I'm going to do a pose where
are both feet are in the air.

45
00:02:09,110 --> 00:02:10,960
Depending on the reference and watching

46
00:02:10,960 --> 00:02:13,480
distance might be more or less opened.

47
00:02:13,480 --> 00:02:17,250
Liam Narissan on the left
side has a crazy open stance

48
00:02:17,250 --> 00:02:20,320
because he's going to
throw a very powerful kick.

49
00:02:20,320 --> 00:02:23,682
There a very quick and subtle
moment during the switch

50
00:02:23,682 --> 00:02:28,682
where the body is making a C
shape toward the left shoulder.

51
00:02:28,870 --> 00:02:33,050
And then as a spring, the
body bent the opposite way,

52
00:02:33,050 --> 00:02:36,880
and this is what I want to
achieve with this breakdown pose.

53
00:02:36,880 --> 00:02:39,680
I'm not sure if it's super accurate,

54
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:41,170
but it does seem to work.

55
00:02:41,170 --> 00:02:43,100
And if it doesn't work in the end,

56
00:02:43,100 --> 00:02:44,830
I can change it to later on.

57
00:02:44,830 --> 00:02:48,000
One super important detail
that I want you to spot

58
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,830
before posing your character

59
00:02:49,830 --> 00:02:51,900
is the position of the right foot.

60
00:02:51,900 --> 00:02:54,910
Look, how much it is open to the outside

61
00:02:54,910 --> 00:02:56,670
whenever it hits the ground.

62
00:02:56,670 --> 00:03:00,030
With this position, as
soon as the left foot

63
00:03:00,030 --> 00:03:03,590
will leave the ground, the
hips will naturally twist

64
00:03:03,590 --> 00:03:07,470
towards the right foot,
increasing the power of the kick.

65
00:03:07,470 --> 00:03:10,660
So when I'm posing the
right foot I make sure that,

66
00:03:10,660 --> 00:03:14,200
even in the air, it starts to open a bit.

67
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:17,360
The foot doesn't rotate
when it hits the ground,

68
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:19,970
but just before, when it is in the air.

69
00:03:19,970 --> 00:03:22,100
Keeping the right foot pretty flat

70
00:03:22,100 --> 00:03:25,060
while the left foot will land on its tip.

71
00:03:25,060 --> 00:03:28,000
So I make sure that the
tip of the left foot

72
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:31,180
is pointing toward its landing zone.

73
00:03:31,180 --> 00:03:34,870
The left arm is raising,
the right arm is dropping.

74
00:03:34,870 --> 00:03:37,520
So I make a bit the forearm dragging,

75
00:03:37,520 --> 00:03:40,939
meaning that the left arm
will be slightly straighter

76
00:03:40,939 --> 00:03:44,290
while the right arm will be slightly bent.

77
00:03:44,290 --> 00:03:48,470
Finally, I've exaggerated
the C shape of the torso,

78
00:03:48,470 --> 00:03:49,910
maybe a bit too much.

79
00:03:49,910 --> 00:03:51,680
I will see that later on.

80
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:52,630
For the next pose.

81
00:03:52,630 --> 00:03:54,716
I wanted to create the overshoot

82
00:03:54,716 --> 00:03:57,420
just after the leg hit the bag.

83
00:03:57,420 --> 00:04:00,210
At this point, the leg is almost straight

84
00:04:00,210 --> 00:04:02,500
as the kicker is trying
to get through the bag

85
00:04:02,500 --> 00:04:03,930
or through the pose.

86
00:04:03,930 --> 00:04:06,840
What's interesting is
that at this very stage,

87
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:10,140
the hips already start to twist backwards

88
00:04:10,140 --> 00:04:12,010
and then the shoulders will follow.

89
00:04:12,010 --> 00:04:13,880
And if you watch the right heel,

90
00:04:13,880 --> 00:04:15,880
it seems it's hitting a wall.

91
00:04:15,880 --> 00:04:19,350
This is also a moment
where I am going to build

92
00:04:19,350 --> 00:04:21,650
a little smear on the left leg.

93
00:04:21,650 --> 00:04:24,920
Using the tweaker bone, I
slightly the break the joint

94
00:04:24,920 --> 00:04:29,500
to bend it into a knock that
is the opposite direction

95
00:04:29,500 --> 00:04:31,750
a leg normally bend.

96
00:04:31,750 --> 00:04:33,570
While the body of our character

97
00:04:33,570 --> 00:04:35,550
is not supposed to move that much,

98
00:04:35,550 --> 00:04:39,420
this recreate a nice contrast
in the shapes of the leg

99
00:04:39,420 --> 00:04:42,863
and will better communicate
the strength of the impact.

100
00:04:43,960 --> 00:04:45,240
As it is an overshoot,

101
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:50,230
I want to push for one beat
and then we need to twist it

102
00:04:50,230 --> 00:04:54,270
back a little bit in reaction
to the impact with the bag.

103
00:04:54,270 --> 00:04:56,480
We need to do the same with the hips

104
00:04:56,480 --> 00:04:58,050
and the chest controller.

105
00:04:58,050 --> 00:04:59,990
This is the time where the right foot

106
00:04:59,990 --> 00:05:03,740
hit its extreme toward the target,

107
00:05:03,740 --> 00:05:06,370
so I rotate it a bit to the left.

108
00:05:06,370 --> 00:05:09,110
Since the left arm was swinging back,

109
00:05:09,110 --> 00:05:12,180
I will rotate it a bit backward.

110
00:05:12,180 --> 00:05:15,410
And since the right arm
was rotating forward,

111
00:05:15,410 --> 00:05:18,150
I will rotate eat a little more forward.

112
00:05:18,150 --> 00:05:21,320
Regarding the left leg, I
want to exaggerate its pose,

113
00:05:21,320 --> 00:05:24,830
so I will push the left foot controller

114
00:05:24,830 --> 00:05:26,820
further away from the hips.

115
00:05:26,820 --> 00:05:29,160
I've also repositioned the pull target

116
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:31,850
to make sure that the knee's not flipping.

117
00:05:31,850 --> 00:05:35,450
It's totally fine to have
some stretching in the leg,

118
00:05:35,450 --> 00:05:38,000
because whenever we are
building a smear frame,

119
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,860
it won't last more than one or two frames.

120
00:05:40,860 --> 00:05:44,000
If you were supposed to feel
this beyond, not see it.

121
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,530
You want to the knock that will

122
00:05:45,530 --> 00:05:47,760
wrap around the punching bag,

123
00:05:47,760 --> 00:05:51,520
so I'm even rotating the
toes in this direction.

124
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:55,260
I've enabled the trochlear
of the leg in the read UI.

125
00:05:55,260 --> 00:05:57,960
And from there, I will
move them one by one

126
00:05:57,960 --> 00:06:00,110
to shape the leg into a knock.

127
00:06:00,110 --> 00:06:01,800
Start with the new controller,

128
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:04,560
as it allows you to bend the knee backward

129
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:06,730
and then use the smaller tweaker bone

130
00:06:06,730 --> 00:06:09,850
to create a the arc with
the sheen of the character.

131
00:06:09,850 --> 00:06:12,190
As I was building the pose and rotating

132
00:06:12,190 --> 00:06:14,380
a lot around my character,

133
00:06:14,380 --> 00:06:17,750
I've noticed that the
punching bag was not reacting

134
00:06:17,750 --> 00:06:19,650
in the right direction.

135
00:06:19,650 --> 00:06:23,110
Eventually, I fixed this by reworking

136
00:06:23,110 --> 00:06:25,170
all the pose after the kick.

137
00:06:25,170 --> 00:06:29,096
Slowly but surely, and even
without working on the timing,

138
00:06:29,096 --> 00:06:33,620
our animation flow is
getting better and better.

139
00:06:33,620 --> 00:06:37,250
The very last pose I've created
for this breakdown stage

140
00:06:37,250 --> 00:06:39,360
is the transition into idle.

141
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:42,070
It's the moment where
the left leg is dropping,

142
00:06:42,070 --> 00:06:45,100
almost straight, into a nice arc.

143
00:06:45,100 --> 00:06:46,760
All the weight is on the right foot

144
00:06:46,760 --> 00:06:49,210
and counter balancing the left leg.

145
00:06:49,210 --> 00:06:53,830
So the body is creating a
nice C shape to the right.

146
00:06:53,830 --> 00:06:56,960
This is not a very difficult pose to build

147
00:06:56,960 --> 00:06:59,226
since it's really flowing between

148
00:06:59,226 --> 00:07:02,630
the kicking pose and the next pose.

149
00:07:02,630 --> 00:07:04,950
Don't forget to also rework the bag

150
00:07:04,950 --> 00:07:07,050
and move some of these poses.

151
00:07:07,050 --> 00:07:09,937
It doesn't matter if you have
a hard time with the bag.

152
00:07:09,937 --> 00:07:12,940
The most important pose
are the contact pose

153
00:07:12,940 --> 00:07:14,170
with the character.

154
00:07:14,170 --> 00:07:17,314
If at this stage, you have
a hard time figuring out

155
00:07:17,314 --> 00:07:20,550
all the poses of the bag,
that's not a problem.

156
00:07:20,550 --> 00:07:22,900
For the time being, keep
the poses of the bag

157
00:07:22,900 --> 00:07:25,650
and the character synchronized.

158
00:07:25,650 --> 00:07:27,820
When we will on the
timing of the character,

159
00:07:27,820 --> 00:07:32,820
it will be easier to figure
out the timing for the bag too.

160
00:07:33,390 --> 00:07:35,620
Regarding the current pose, to be honest,

161
00:07:35,620 --> 00:07:37,500
I don't really know what to say

162
00:07:37,500 --> 00:07:40,130
since it's a pretty simple pose.

163
00:07:40,130 --> 00:07:41,750
You have the reference,

164
00:07:41,750 --> 00:07:44,840
just try your best to
fit what you are seeing.

165
00:07:44,840 --> 00:07:47,670
In the next video we are going to give

166
00:07:47,670 --> 00:07:50,443
a first pass to the
timing of our blocking.
