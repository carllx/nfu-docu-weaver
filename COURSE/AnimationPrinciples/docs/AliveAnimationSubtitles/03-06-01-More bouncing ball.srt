- [Instructor] This is video

2
00:00:01,870 --> 00:00:05,560
is an exercise video or assignment video.

3
00:00:05,560 --> 00:00:09,300
I invite you to create two new animation

4
00:00:09,300 --> 00:00:13,660
using the bouncing ball
and this parkour object.

5
00:00:13,660 --> 00:00:17,100
The idea is to launch the
bouncing ball onto the surface.

6
00:00:17,100 --> 00:00:19,840
I've made two version of the animation,

7
00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:23,000
one with a very heavy bouncing ball,

8
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:24,220
like a bowling ball

9
00:00:24,220 --> 00:00:26,190
that will strike the surface

10
00:00:26,190 --> 00:00:29,540
and almost stop and then will be rolling.

11
00:00:29,540 --> 00:00:30,860
And the second animation

12
00:00:30,860 --> 00:00:34,810
with a more squashy
and light bouncing ball

13
00:00:34,810 --> 00:00:36,970
that will just bounce until it stops.

14
00:00:36,970 --> 00:00:38,870
You can find those two animation

15
00:00:38,870 --> 00:00:40,670
in the action library.

16
00:00:40,670 --> 00:00:44,080
I will explain you right
now the key component

17
00:00:44,080 --> 00:00:45,720
of those animation

18
00:00:45,720 --> 00:00:48,150
and the next video will be a time lapse

19
00:00:48,150 --> 00:00:51,350
of me creating those two animations.

20
00:00:51,350 --> 00:00:53,720
It's exactly the same workflow

21
00:00:53,720 --> 00:00:55,710
as on the previous animation.

22
00:00:55,710 --> 00:00:57,580
And I will just double the speed

23
00:00:57,580 --> 00:01:00,920
of the video so that
you can use VLC Player,

24
00:01:00,920 --> 00:01:03,700
for example, to slow down the video

25
00:01:03,700 --> 00:01:07,500
by 50% and get it real time if you need.

26
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:10,224
On the squashy bouncing ball animation,

27
00:01:10,224 --> 00:01:13,630
instead of moving the screen controller

28
00:01:13,630 --> 00:01:15,930
to give an orientation to the ball,

29
00:01:15,930 --> 00:01:18,575
you can also rotate its root controller

30
00:01:18,575 --> 00:01:21,987
and use the squash and
stretch controller only

31
00:01:21,987 --> 00:01:24,910
to squash and stretch the ball currently.

32
00:01:24,910 --> 00:01:27,310
So only on their z-axis.

33
00:01:27,310 --> 00:01:29,720
The thing you will have to check out

34
00:01:29,720 --> 00:01:32,350
during your polishing is the amplitude

35
00:01:32,350 --> 00:01:34,770
of the squash and stretch curve.

36
00:01:34,770 --> 00:01:36,400
As you go down the parkour,

37
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:38,180
the ball will lose energy

38
00:01:38,180 --> 00:01:41,780
and so the squash and
stretch will get more subtle

39
00:01:41,780 --> 00:01:45,960
and more subtle as you reach
the end of the animation.

40
00:01:45,960 --> 00:01:49,220
So your curve must lose amplitude.

41
00:01:49,220 --> 00:01:51,931
For the heavy ball animation,

42
00:01:51,931 --> 00:01:55,230
I haven't used squash and stretch at all.

43
00:01:55,230 --> 00:01:57,240
To make the ball feels heavy,

44
00:01:57,240 --> 00:02:00,000
I've used very subtle bouncing

45
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,910
and very short bouncing.

46
00:02:01,910 --> 00:02:05,870
The key point here is to
remove the squash and stretch

47
00:02:05,870 --> 00:02:08,040
or make it very subtle

48
00:02:08,040 --> 00:02:09,870
and make the bounce very small

49
00:02:09,870 --> 00:02:13,420
and you will get this feel
of weight in the ball.

50
00:02:13,420 --> 00:02:15,410
The second very important thing

51
00:02:15,410 --> 00:02:19,690
to watch out on this animation
is the spacing of the ball.

52
00:02:19,690 --> 00:02:21,490
It gets bigger and bigger

53
00:02:21,490 --> 00:02:24,570
as the ball is falling
toward the first surface.

54
00:02:24,570 --> 00:02:27,900
Due to its weight, the ball almost stop

55
00:02:27,900 --> 00:02:30,160
when it hits the surface

56
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:33,020
as we are close to 90-degree angle

57
00:02:33,020 --> 00:02:36,930
and then the ball is accelerating
until it touch the ground

58
00:02:36,930 --> 00:02:39,960
and then it will slowly lose speed

59
00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:44,400
as soon as the animation
go ahead until it stops.

60
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:47,220
The longer time it takes to stop,

61
00:02:47,220 --> 00:02:49,170
the heavier it will feel.

62
00:02:49,170 --> 00:02:51,770
You now have all the instruction

63
00:02:51,770 --> 00:02:53,520
to create those animation.

64
00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:55,710
The next video is the time lapse

65
00:02:55,710 --> 00:02:58,140
of me creating those two animations

66
00:02:58,140 --> 00:03:00,010
and then we will start working

67
00:03:00,010 --> 00:03:02,983
on our first character animation.
