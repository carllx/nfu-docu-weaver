1
00:00:00,840 --> 00:00:03,130
- It's now time to bring some details

2
00:00:03,130 --> 00:00:06,250
to our feet by moving the toes.

3
00:00:06,250 --> 00:00:08,900
Again, it's gonna be
pretty straightforward

4
00:00:08,900 --> 00:00:13,160
since we already have the
base motion of our foot.

5
00:00:13,160 --> 00:00:15,890
We'll first work on the
front toe controller,

6
00:00:15,890 --> 00:00:17,910
and I will try to find the movement

7
00:00:17,910 --> 00:00:19,920
the foot is leaving the ground

8
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:22,340
and duplicate the key Frame.

9
00:00:22,340 --> 00:00:25,660
Dissuade the toe will
remain flat on the ground,

10
00:00:25,660 --> 00:00:28,750
from Frame zero to Frame 30 foot.

11
00:00:28,750 --> 00:00:31,160
I will set the end-all type two vector

12
00:00:31,160 --> 00:00:32,800
for this new key frame.

13
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:35,710
Go a little further in the animation,

14
00:00:35,710 --> 00:00:38,740
and simply rotate the toes backward

15
00:00:38,740 --> 00:00:41,740
so that they will drag during this motion.

16
00:00:41,740 --> 00:00:44,340
I will then adjust the end (indistinct)

17
00:00:44,340 --> 00:00:46,050
of the first key frame,

18
00:00:46,050 --> 00:00:48,265
so that it doesn't clip with the ground

19
00:00:48,265 --> 00:00:51,123
whenever the foot is going backward.

20
00:00:52,030 --> 00:00:54,980
Then I will adjust to dragging motion

21
00:00:54,980 --> 00:00:57,520
as the foot is moving forward.

22
00:00:57,520 --> 00:01:01,670
I want the toes to point
downward because of its weight,

23
00:01:01,670 --> 00:01:04,953
but also because of the
forward motion of the foot.

24
00:01:05,890 --> 00:01:08,340
She's the kind of motion we have practiced

25
00:01:08,340 --> 00:01:09,270
with this key role.

26
00:01:09,270 --> 00:01:11,770
Whenever we were moving the limps,

27
00:01:11,770 --> 00:01:15,323
we were making the hands
and the feet dragging.

28
00:01:16,490 --> 00:01:17,840
As we are done with this,

29
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:21,340
we can go forward to the compacting frame,

30
00:01:21,340 --> 00:01:24,670
where we will make the toe raising.

31
00:01:24,670 --> 00:01:26,740
As the foot fall down,

32
00:01:26,740 --> 00:01:29,370
the toes are still dragging

33
00:01:29,370 --> 00:01:32,100
or there is a full of full motion.

34
00:01:32,100 --> 00:01:36,020
So there are pointing
up (indistinct) emphasis

35
00:01:36,020 --> 00:01:37,240
the flap of the foot.

36
00:01:37,240 --> 00:01:40,630
So as the foot is getting
flat on the ground,

37
00:01:40,630 --> 00:01:43,770
I will make sure that the toes are almost

38
00:01:43,770 --> 00:01:46,180
at their highest position.

39
00:01:46,180 --> 00:01:48,410
And then two frame letters,

40
00:01:48,410 --> 00:01:51,740
I will make the toes flat on the ground.

41
00:01:51,740 --> 00:01:56,050
Here, I will slightly offset
the foot roll controller

42
00:01:56,050 --> 00:01:57,900
by one frame at back.

43
00:01:57,900 --> 00:02:02,140
I will then re-adjust
the toe extreme position

44
00:02:02,140 --> 00:02:06,200
just before it hits
the ground to frame 60.

45
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:10,740
I will go to frame letter and
press Alt+ R in the 3D view,

46
00:02:10,740 --> 00:02:13,350
to flatten the toe on the ground.

47
00:02:13,350 --> 00:02:15,750
Whenever I create a contacting post,

48
00:02:15,750 --> 00:02:18,840
I generally set the
end-all type two vector.

49
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:20,420
As the current motion,

50
00:02:20,420 --> 00:02:23,740
is kind of stop brutally
as it hits the ground.

51
00:02:23,740 --> 00:02:27,362
So there is no easing
before the curve gets flat.

52
00:02:27,362 --> 00:02:29,270
(indistinct) tell that
will make the difference

53
00:02:29,270 --> 00:02:31,860
is to create a slight bounce of the toe,

54
00:02:31,860 --> 00:02:33,390
when it hits the ground.

55
00:02:33,390 --> 00:02:36,370
To do so, I will duplicate
the current key frame,

56
00:02:36,370 --> 00:02:39,520
and move it two to four frame later.

57
00:02:39,520 --> 00:02:42,860
And we then duplicate the post key frame,

58
00:02:42,860 --> 00:02:45,550
lower rate and put it in between.

59
00:02:45,550 --> 00:02:48,080
This way, we have a more clunky motion,

60
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:50,020
and we finally get something

61
00:02:50,020 --> 00:02:52,990
that looks like an animation for the foot.

62
00:02:52,990 --> 00:02:54,660
It's indeed a robot,

63
00:02:54,660 --> 00:02:58,720
but we are kind of briefing
life into it if you will.

64
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:02,770
From there, we can repeat the
process with the back toe.

65
00:03:02,770 --> 00:03:06,140
Beware because these toe has two joint.

66
00:03:06,140 --> 00:03:09,700
One at the base of the foot on the heel,

67
00:03:09,700 --> 00:03:12,230
and one for the current back toe.

68
00:03:12,230 --> 00:03:15,740
I will create a motion
for the first joint,

69
00:03:15,740 --> 00:03:20,740
that really looks like the
front toe but in reverse.

70
00:03:20,870 --> 00:03:24,440
And I will keep the motion pretty slight.

71
00:03:24,440 --> 00:03:27,890
Whenever you are working
on a chain of bone,

72
00:03:27,890 --> 00:03:29,990
we've Arrow Key,

73
00:03:29,990 --> 00:03:34,030
the more you move the
roots to more the deep tip,

74
00:03:34,030 --> 00:03:36,320
and the other controller we move

75
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:39,210
and it might look a bit too extreme.

76
00:03:39,210 --> 00:03:40,990
So keep it subtle.

77
00:03:40,990 --> 00:03:44,733
It's easier then to amplify
the motion if needed.

78
00:03:46,130 --> 00:03:48,430
Remember that you have
to make the toe drugging,

79
00:03:48,430 --> 00:03:51,310
so whenever the foot is moving forward,

80
00:03:51,310 --> 00:03:54,220
each will point backward a little down.

81
00:03:54,220 --> 00:03:57,190
And whenever the foot is falling down,

82
00:03:57,190 --> 00:03:59,850
this will drag so it will raise.

83
00:03:59,850 --> 00:04:04,400
I didn't input any bones
on the contact bones,

84
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:07,120
because it was a bit too much

85
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:10,670
since I will input a bit of bouncing,

86
00:04:10,670 --> 00:04:12,410
on to the tip of the toe.

87
00:04:12,410 --> 00:04:16,970
So on the curve, the back
to root is kind of phrasing

88
00:04:16,970 --> 00:04:19,350
just before the contact pose,

89
00:04:19,350 --> 00:04:21,860
and whenever to contact pose occur,

90
00:04:21,860 --> 00:04:24,200
it will flatten on the ground.

91
00:04:24,200 --> 00:04:27,460
So I have canceled in your rotation.

92
00:04:27,460 --> 00:04:29,470
I've used a Vector and (indistinct)

93
00:04:29,470 --> 00:04:31,680
because I don't want anything,

94
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:35,250
but I didn't input any bounds.

95
00:04:35,250 --> 00:04:39,730
I did input the bones in
motion on the tip, the toes.

96
00:04:39,730 --> 00:04:43,083
So on the next joint into the animation.

97
00:04:43,990 --> 00:04:47,740
So I did animate the tip of the back toe,

98
00:04:47,740 --> 00:04:51,810
as I did for the front
toe, making it drug,

99
00:04:51,810 --> 00:04:56,030
so that we feel like there is
a bit of delay in its motion,

100
00:04:56,030 --> 00:04:58,100
and then adding some bounds,

101
00:04:58,100 --> 00:05:00,220
as it contacts the ground.

102
00:05:00,220 --> 00:05:03,983
Be careful not to make it
clip through the ground.

103
00:05:05,100 --> 00:05:06,170
When that was done,

104
00:05:06,170 --> 00:05:10,213
I repeat the process
with the outer side toe.

105
00:05:11,820 --> 00:05:14,800
And since the foot is
not tilting in space,

106
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:19,800
I could then simply copy the
curve of this outer side toe,

107
00:05:20,640 --> 00:05:23,150
onto the inner side toe.

108
00:05:23,150 --> 00:05:25,120
Again, nothing crazy here.

109
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:26,690
It's pretty simple.

110
00:05:26,690 --> 00:05:29,140
So you will be able to watch me

111
00:05:29,140 --> 00:05:32,350
kind of animating those
toes in the next video,

112
00:05:32,350 --> 00:05:36,000
that will be a short time
lapse of this process.

113
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,330
As all the toes were animated,

114
00:05:38,330 --> 00:05:40,550
the foot animation was done,

115
00:05:40,550 --> 00:05:44,810
and we now need to copy
it onto the other foot.

116
00:05:44,810 --> 00:05:46,710
To do so, it's very simple.

117
00:05:46,710 --> 00:05:50,930
You just select all the
controllers from the left foot

118
00:05:50,930 --> 00:05:51,823
we just animated.

119
00:05:52,930 --> 00:05:54,650
Open the graph editor,

120
00:05:54,650 --> 00:05:57,430
and press Alt+H to make sure that

121
00:05:57,430 --> 00:05:59,820
all the curve are available.

122
00:05:59,820 --> 00:06:02,330
Press A again to select them all,

123
00:06:02,330 --> 00:06:05,110
Press Ctrl+C to copy those curves.

124
00:06:05,110 --> 00:06:08,810
Then Select all the
right foot controllers.

125
00:06:08,810 --> 00:06:12,700
Go on frame zero and press Ctrl+Shift+V.

126
00:06:12,700 --> 00:06:16,880
Since our rig is symmetrical,
Blender will Paste the curve

127
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:19,370
taking care of the symmetry for us.

128
00:06:19,370 --> 00:06:21,670
Now, both foot are moving

129
00:06:21,670 --> 00:06:24,310
in the same fashion with the same rhythm.

130
00:06:24,310 --> 00:06:28,930
We now just need to offset
the motion of the right foot

131
00:06:28,930 --> 00:06:32,700
in time so that we get
an alternate motion.

132
00:06:32,700 --> 00:06:35,500
To do so, simply select all the curve,

133
00:06:35,500 --> 00:06:40,500
Press Shift+D and offset
them by the whole cycle.

134
00:06:40,570 --> 00:06:43,450
In my case, 72 frames.

135
00:06:43,450 --> 00:06:46,230
Then I will select again all the curve,

136
00:06:46,230 --> 00:06:48,850
and I will offset them back in time

137
00:06:48,850 --> 00:06:52,810
by half of the motion, 36 frames.

138
00:06:52,810 --> 00:06:55,530
We now have both our feet motion.

139
00:06:55,530 --> 00:06:58,320
Since I have now a better
vision of the motion,

140
00:06:58,320 --> 00:07:01,900
I feel like the foot are two forward.

141
00:07:01,900 --> 00:07:03,300
So what I will do is that

142
00:07:03,300 --> 00:07:07,320
I will select both foot main controller,

143
00:07:07,320 --> 00:07:11,980
isolate the Y Location
axis by inputting its name

144
00:07:11,980 --> 00:07:15,720
in the Search bar, Select
all the available keys

145
00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:18,820
for both to (indistinct)
location channels.

146
00:07:18,820 --> 00:07:22,200
And then I will slightly offset them up

147
00:07:22,200 --> 00:07:25,210
on the Y-Axis in the graph editor.

148
00:07:25,210 --> 00:07:28,570
This will push both feet backward,

149
00:07:28,570 --> 00:07:31,213
and it will look a little more natural.

150
00:07:32,060 --> 00:07:34,820
From there, you can adjust the eighth

151
00:07:34,820 --> 00:07:39,820
of the up-and-down motion by
simply offsetting dizzy curve.

152
00:07:39,970 --> 00:07:43,620
You can also scale it on this Y-axis,

153
00:07:43,620 --> 00:07:47,800
so that we'll have more up
and down motion if needed,

154
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:49,700
or if you scale it down

155
00:07:49,700 --> 00:07:52,993
you will reduce the
bounciness of the motion.

156
00:07:54,120 --> 00:07:57,100
From there, it's really a
matter of personal taste

157
00:07:57,100 --> 00:07:59,810
and experience to make it look good

158
00:07:59,810 --> 00:08:02,060
but you have the whole method.

159
00:08:02,060 --> 00:08:04,550
Now we just need to get rid

160
00:08:04,550 --> 00:08:08,510
of the unused key frame on the right foot.

161
00:08:08,510 --> 00:08:10,760
To do so, we simply need to Select

162
00:08:10,760 --> 00:08:13,600
all the controller of the right foots.

163
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:15,570
Go onto the Frame Zero,

164
00:08:15,570 --> 00:08:19,740
Press I to insert a key
frame on all the channels

165
00:08:19,740 --> 00:08:23,720
then Press V and set those
new key frame to Free.

166
00:08:23,720 --> 00:08:27,770
From there we can get rid
off any previous key frame

167
00:08:27,770 --> 00:08:31,840
and then, Select all those
key frame on Frame Zero.

168
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:34,650
Press Shift+D to duplicate them,

169
00:08:34,650 --> 00:08:38,890
and move them on the very
last frame of our cycle.

170
00:08:38,890 --> 00:08:40,860
Frame 72 for me.

171
00:08:40,860 --> 00:08:44,090
Then I can get rid off all the key frame,

172
00:08:44,090 --> 00:08:47,380
after this frame 72.

173
00:08:47,380 --> 00:08:49,330
Our foot animation is done,

174
00:08:49,330 --> 00:08:50,400
the next step,

175
00:08:50,400 --> 00:08:53,730
will be to input some left to right motion

176
00:08:53,730 --> 00:08:55,270
to the toss or root,

177
00:08:55,270 --> 00:08:57,023
and animate a bit the feet.
