00:00:00,350 --> 00:00:01,183
- Hi, everyone.

2
00:00:01,183 --> 00:00:03,360
In this video, I will
show you how to create

3
00:00:03,360 --> 00:00:06,723
a real time animated
sword trail in blender.

4
00:00:11,380 --> 00:00:14,660
Creating this effect is
a very simple process

5
00:00:14,660 --> 00:00:17,100
that we will learn through two main steps.

6
00:00:17,100 --> 00:00:20,250
First, the creation of
the texture and shader,

7
00:00:20,250 --> 00:00:23,443
and then the rigging and
animation of the trail.

8
00:00:23,443 --> 00:00:26,190
Only the sword motion needs to be animated

9
00:00:26,190 --> 00:00:28,680
and we'll generate the trail affixed

10
00:00:28,680 --> 00:00:30,510
based on this motion.

11
00:00:30,510 --> 00:00:31,690
Let's get started.

12
00:00:31,690 --> 00:00:34,910
Creating the trail mesh
will be super easy.

13
00:00:34,910 --> 00:00:37,200
I already have my sword object,

14
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:39,610
and I will simply add a plane.

15
00:00:39,610 --> 00:00:43,100
I will rotate it towards front
view and apply the rotation

16
00:00:43,100 --> 00:00:44,900
and scale pressing control A.

17
00:00:44,900 --> 00:00:47,170
I will then move it in object mode

18
00:00:47,170 --> 00:00:50,060
so that it matches more
or less my sword shape.

19
00:00:50,060 --> 00:00:51,030
Then in edit mode,

20
00:00:51,030 --> 00:00:54,770
I will make it slightly taller
so that it covers the blade.

21
00:00:54,770 --> 00:00:57,930
I advise you to make it
slightly taller than the blade

22
00:00:57,930 --> 00:01:00,920
because a part of it will be masked.

23
00:01:00,920 --> 00:01:02,760
The cool thing is that by default,

24
00:01:02,760 --> 00:01:06,370
when you add the plane in
blender, it's already unwrapped.

25
00:01:06,370 --> 00:01:09,010
So we are done creating our UVs.

26
00:01:09,010 --> 00:01:11,220
In edit mode, I will press control R

27
00:01:11,220 --> 00:01:13,220
to create two loop kits.

28
00:01:13,220 --> 00:01:16,090
I think going above is a bit overkill,

29
00:01:16,090 --> 00:01:19,600
so two loop cut is way
enough to get a small trail.

30
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:22,400
And the cool thing is
that the UVs are updated.

31
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:24,670
Then we need to create a new material,

32
00:01:24,670 --> 00:01:27,560
and since I wanted to be transparent

33
00:01:27,560 --> 00:01:31,330
in the material setting, I
will switch it to alpha blend.

34
00:01:31,330 --> 00:01:33,880
I don't want it to emit any shadow,

35
00:01:33,880 --> 00:01:37,300
so then I will switch
the shadow mode to none,

36
00:01:37,300 --> 00:01:40,220
and we will keep the back
face cooling disabled,

37
00:01:40,220 --> 00:01:42,020
because if you enable it,

38
00:01:42,020 --> 00:01:45,160
then the shader will
show only on one side.

39
00:01:45,160 --> 00:01:48,670
We can go to the next step
and create our first mask.

40
00:01:48,670 --> 00:01:50,800
I'm working with blender 292,

41
00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:53,290
but I guess 2.9 will walk the same.

42
00:01:53,290 --> 00:01:56,100
In my 3D view port I've
pressed control tab,

43
00:01:56,100 --> 00:01:58,540
and I will switch to texture paint mode.

44
00:01:58,540 --> 00:02:02,970
In the texture slot I will
add a new base color texture

45
00:02:02,970 --> 00:02:05,160
and set it to black.

46
00:02:05,160 --> 00:02:07,947
I will keep it at 1 K resolution.

47
00:02:07,947 --> 00:02:12,947
I will then go into the image
editor and switch to paint.

48
00:02:13,260 --> 00:02:16,400
In the lowest part of
the painting tool panels,

49
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:20,330
I will open the tiling
option and enable X and Y.

50
00:02:20,330 --> 00:02:22,820
Then I can open my texture library

51
00:02:22,820 --> 00:02:24,890
and select the sword train based color.

52
00:02:24,890 --> 00:02:26,060
With the tiling option,

53
00:02:26,060 --> 00:02:28,930
I can now paint seamless textures.

54
00:02:28,930 --> 00:02:30,930
You may have to experiment a bit,

55
00:02:30,930 --> 00:02:33,650
but the method to paint
the flame is very simple.

56
00:02:33,650 --> 00:02:35,670
I start by painting random,

57
00:02:35,670 --> 00:02:38,210
broad shapes with the standard brush,

58
00:02:38,210 --> 00:02:41,830
using pressure sensitivity
for both the radius

59
00:02:41,830 --> 00:02:42,880
and the strength.

60
00:02:42,880 --> 00:02:45,540
Don't try to paint any flame shape yet,

61
00:02:45,540 --> 00:02:49,300
just paint slightly curved
or reasonable lines.

62
00:02:49,300 --> 00:02:51,380
Then using the finger tool,

63
00:02:51,380 --> 00:02:53,040
just push a bit the black

64
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:55,570
into the white and the
white into the black.

65
00:02:55,570 --> 00:02:59,150
So the trick here to get a
good result is just to change

66
00:02:59,150 --> 00:03:03,030
the size of your brush
often pressing the F key.

67
00:03:03,030 --> 00:03:06,630
This is a pretty simple process,
but if you fail at first,

68
00:03:06,630 --> 00:03:08,160
just restart again.

69
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:10,520
This is the first time
I'm using this method,

70
00:03:10,520 --> 00:03:14,070
and it took me two trials
to get to a good result.

71
00:03:14,070 --> 00:03:14,903
Keep it loose,

72
00:03:14,903 --> 00:03:17,010
you don't need to add a lot of detail

73
00:03:17,010 --> 00:03:18,880
because this is going to be moving

74
00:03:18,880 --> 00:03:21,130
so we won't see it clearly.

75
00:03:21,130 --> 00:03:24,820
I will save it sword trail mask zero one.

76
00:03:24,820 --> 00:03:27,760
From there, let's open the shader editor.

77
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:31,370
We can get rid of the principle BSDF.

78
00:03:31,370 --> 00:03:33,050
And with my texture selected,

79
00:03:33,050 --> 00:03:37,790
I will press control T
to create a texture setup

80
00:03:37,790 --> 00:03:40,200
using the node wrangler addon.

81
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:41,700
As explained in the beginning,

82
00:03:41,700 --> 00:03:44,200
we will create a transparent material,

83
00:03:44,200 --> 00:03:47,970
so we need a mixed shader
to mix a transparent shader

84
00:03:47,970 --> 00:03:49,470
and an emission shader.

85
00:03:49,470 --> 00:03:53,050
We will plug the transparent
shader in the first slot

86
00:03:53,050 --> 00:03:55,540
and the emission shader
in the second slot.

87
00:03:55,540 --> 00:03:59,060
Make sure you are using
the UV as coordinate,

88
00:03:59,060 --> 00:04:01,170
and control shift to click the texture.

89
00:04:01,170 --> 00:04:04,130
We can see our fire mask texture.

90
00:04:04,130 --> 00:04:05,120
If you don't see it,

91
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:08,340
make sure you are in
loop dev shading mode.

92
00:04:08,340 --> 00:04:12,420
Let's plug our texture into
the mixed shader as a factor

93
00:04:12,420 --> 00:04:15,230
and control shift to
click the mixed shader.

94
00:04:15,230 --> 00:04:18,030
Now, I like to add a bit of distortion

95
00:04:18,030 --> 00:04:19,790
into my flame texture.

96
00:04:19,790 --> 00:04:22,820
You can revise the tiling
and size of the pattern

97
00:04:22,820 --> 00:04:24,780
using the scale input.

98
00:04:24,780 --> 00:04:26,320
Don't choose the Z scale

99
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:28,890
because the UVs are two dimensional.

100
00:04:28,890 --> 00:04:30,410
To create the distortion,

101
00:04:30,410 --> 00:04:33,080
we will simply add a noise texture.

102
00:04:33,080 --> 00:04:36,270
If we control shift to
clique the mapping node,

103
00:04:36,270 --> 00:04:39,710
you will be able to
see the UV coordinates.

104
00:04:39,710 --> 00:04:44,000
It's a simple gradient
mixing red and green color.

105
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:47,680
The green is the y-axis,
the red is the x-axis.

106
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:49,610
Since our plane is rotated,

107
00:04:49,610 --> 00:04:52,200
they might not be aligned with word space,

108
00:04:52,200 --> 00:04:53,220
but we don't care.

109
00:04:53,220 --> 00:04:56,460
The only thing we have to
care is that our noise texture

110
00:04:56,460 --> 00:05:00,900
is also made of color, so if
we mix those two together,

111
00:05:00,900 --> 00:05:05,330
the red and green color of
our noise will influence

112
00:05:05,330 --> 00:05:07,320
the coordinates of the flame.

113
00:05:07,320 --> 00:05:10,230
So here, the distortion
is kind of overkill,

114
00:05:10,230 --> 00:05:14,300
but as I reduced the factor,
I will get less distortion.

115
00:05:14,300 --> 00:05:17,300
The scale of the noise
is also pretty important.

116
00:05:17,300 --> 00:05:19,200
We want to have a broad noise,

117
00:05:19,200 --> 00:05:22,050
so a scale of two is way enough.

118
00:05:22,050 --> 00:05:26,553
And if we now play with the X
location of our flame texture,

119
00:05:26,553 --> 00:05:29,240
it will kind of flow on the plane.

120
00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:31,950
So you have the base principle on all.

121
00:05:31,950 --> 00:05:33,770
We will create the effect.

122
00:05:33,770 --> 00:05:35,670
I can now regroup my notes

123
00:05:35,670 --> 00:05:37,780
and move on to the second texture.

124
00:05:37,780 --> 00:05:41,180
And don't worry if you
don't get every single node

125
00:05:41,180 --> 00:05:43,830
we are creating, at the end of the video,

126
00:05:43,830 --> 00:05:46,140
I will show you the full node setup.

127
00:05:46,140 --> 00:05:50,390
You can make a screenshot and
reproduce it at your site.

128
00:05:50,390 --> 00:05:53,980
I will use the same process
to create the second mask.

129
00:05:53,980 --> 00:05:56,100
In the 3D view, press control tab,

130
00:05:56,100 --> 00:05:58,173
to switch to texture paint mode,

131
00:05:58,173 --> 00:06:01,620
go into the texture slot,
press the plus icon,

132
00:06:01,620 --> 00:06:03,420
and create a new texture,

133
00:06:03,420 --> 00:06:07,550
same size as before and still
with a black background.

134
00:06:07,550 --> 00:06:11,290
The idea is to mask
the edges of our plane.

135
00:06:11,290 --> 00:06:15,440
We don't need to input as much
detail as on the first mask,

136
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:19,550
we just need a big, round
gradient that will influence

137
00:06:19,550 --> 00:06:21,570
the opacity of our flame.

138
00:06:21,570 --> 00:06:26,490
Just make sure that the
outer edges are pure black.

139
00:06:26,490 --> 00:06:29,600
When you are done use a very large brush

140
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:34,090
with a very low strength to
paint the tip of the flame.

141
00:06:34,090 --> 00:06:36,030
It will lower it's opacity

142
00:06:36,030 --> 00:06:39,566
and we will have nice
and smooth gradients.

143
00:06:39,566 --> 00:06:43,440
I will create exactly the same note setup

144
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:46,070
as for the first texture.

145
00:06:46,070 --> 00:06:50,600
The only difference is that
I will keep the scale at one,

146
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:54,020
because we don't want this mask to tile.

147
00:06:54,020 --> 00:06:56,690
Then I've used a couple of layout

148
00:06:56,690 --> 00:07:01,690
to reroute items to make my
shader editor a little cleaner.

149
00:07:01,960 --> 00:07:04,470
Then we can use a colored mix,

150
00:07:04,470 --> 00:07:09,470
RGB node to mix both of our
mask and set the blend mode

151
00:07:09,710 --> 00:07:11,180
to multiply.

152
00:07:11,180 --> 00:07:13,870
I will push the mixing value to one,

153
00:07:13,870 --> 00:07:17,120
and we don't care if you
plug the first texture

154
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:19,400
in the first slot or the second.

155
00:07:19,400 --> 00:07:22,960
After that, we will add
a couple of new nodes,

156
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:24,820
the convertor color ramp

157
00:07:24,820 --> 00:07:29,440
to be able to play with the
contrast of our texture.

158
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:34,050
We will use it to drive the
color of our emission shader,

159
00:07:34,050 --> 00:07:37,570
and I will push the emission shader to 10,

160
00:07:37,570 --> 00:07:42,320
then in the render option, I
will enable the bloom option.

161
00:07:42,320 --> 00:07:45,140
Then I will add the convertor map range

162
00:07:45,140 --> 00:07:46,640
before the color ramp,

163
00:07:46,640 --> 00:07:51,310
this will allow us to fine
tweak our gradient if needed.

164
00:07:51,310 --> 00:07:55,040
Then we can edit the
gradient of our color ramp

165
00:07:55,040 --> 00:07:59,750
from black and white to
a cool looking fire tone.

166
00:07:59,750 --> 00:08:02,832
So now instead of animating both location

167
00:08:02,832 --> 00:08:06,930
of both mapping node, I
like to use only one value.

168
00:08:06,930 --> 00:08:11,080
So I will use a converter combined XYZ,

169
00:08:11,080 --> 00:08:14,430
and then I will add an input value node.

170
00:08:14,430 --> 00:08:17,050
If I plugged this input value node

171
00:08:17,050 --> 00:08:21,460
in the X value of the combined XYZ,

172
00:08:21,460 --> 00:08:24,730
then it's like moving the X value directly

173
00:08:24,730 --> 00:08:26,180
into the mapping node.

174
00:08:26,180 --> 00:08:30,550
But then I can duplicate
this combined XYZ,

175
00:08:30,550 --> 00:08:35,550
add math node in between, set
this math node to multiply

176
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:39,140
so that when I move my first value,

177
00:08:39,140 --> 00:08:44,070
it will modify both X
location of both mapping node,

178
00:08:44,070 --> 00:08:46,180
but not with the same rate,

179
00:08:46,180 --> 00:08:49,290
this way we will have
a difference of speed

180
00:08:49,290 --> 00:08:52,070
for both noises tiling,

181
00:08:52,070 --> 00:08:54,980
and it will look a little
more random and natural

182
00:08:54,980 --> 00:08:59,380
than if we add both noise
running at the same speed.

183
00:08:59,380 --> 00:09:01,880
Now to animate our fire texture,

184
00:09:01,880 --> 00:09:06,580
we just need to add a key
frame on our tiling value.

185
00:09:06,580 --> 00:09:10,280
Hovering upon the value
I will press the I key.

186
00:09:10,280 --> 00:09:14,250
With our key frame created
and our tiling node selected,

187
00:09:14,250 --> 00:09:16,320
I will open the graph editor,

188
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:20,313
move the key frame created on
frame zero by pressing GNX,

189
00:09:21,330 --> 00:09:24,720
and I will duplicate this
frame by pressing shift D

190
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:26,760
and move it on frame 10,

191
00:09:26,760 --> 00:09:29,940
this way I have two key
frames for the tagging value.

192
00:09:29,940 --> 00:09:33,820
I will switch the handle to
vector by pressing the V key,

193
00:09:33,820 --> 00:09:36,580
and now I have a linear interpolation

194
00:09:36,580 --> 00:09:38,050
between those two keys.

195
00:09:38,050 --> 00:09:40,080
When I move the second key down,

196
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:43,580
I can see my tiling texture
moving the right way.

197
00:09:43,580 --> 00:09:45,830
So I will push it down a bit,

198
00:09:45,830 --> 00:09:48,920
then select both key and press shift E

199
00:09:48,920 --> 00:09:51,170
and select linear extrapolation.

200
00:09:51,170 --> 00:09:54,080
Now our curve will be extrapolated

201
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:57,410
and we can play our animation infinitely.

202
00:09:57,410 --> 00:10:00,470
Our animated fire shader is now done.

203
00:10:00,470 --> 00:10:04,310
In the UV editor, you
can push and pull a bit

204
00:10:04,310 --> 00:10:07,180
the middle loop cuts from left to right,

205
00:10:07,180 --> 00:10:10,080
to get a bit more
distortion or acceleration

206
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:12,200
and deceleration of the flames.

207
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:15,210
You can also improve
the distortion pattern,

208
00:10:15,210 --> 00:10:18,870
switching the noise texture from 3D to 4D.

209
00:10:18,870 --> 00:10:21,800
It will add a new input
to the noise texture node

210
00:10:21,800 --> 00:10:26,220
called W which is an evolution over time.

211
00:10:26,220 --> 00:10:29,950
So you can then use the
distortion value node

212
00:10:29,950 --> 00:10:31,630
that we have animated.

213
00:10:31,630 --> 00:10:36,630
Use the Mac node to change its
value and plug it in between.

214
00:10:36,660 --> 00:10:40,080
Let's now create our rig.
It will be super simple.

215
00:10:40,080 --> 00:10:42,670
I will snap the cursor to my sword,

216
00:10:42,670 --> 00:10:45,080
I will press shift A and add an armature.

217
00:10:45,080 --> 00:10:47,560
I will give everything a relevant name,

218
00:10:47,560 --> 00:10:50,360
and then I will switch
the object to display,

219
00:10:50,360 --> 00:10:53,800
to be wireframe so that it
will be easier to manipulate.

220
00:10:53,800 --> 00:10:57,000
Then they will go back into
object mode, select our plane,

221
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:00,160
select the first vertex
and snap the cursor to it.

222
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:03,230
I will go back into
edit mode on my armature

223
00:11:03,230 --> 00:11:05,400
and add a new bone.

224
00:11:05,400 --> 00:11:08,630
I will scale it up just
for visual purpose,

225
00:11:08,630 --> 00:11:10,960
it doesn't matter if you scale the bone,

226
00:11:10,960 --> 00:11:12,800
you don't need to scale it.

227
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:17,350
We will then duplicate this
bone free time and snap it

228
00:11:17,350 --> 00:11:20,730
to each loop cut we have
created on the mesh,

229
00:11:20,730 --> 00:11:25,450
so you can enable the snapping
mode and switch to vertices.

230
00:11:25,450 --> 00:11:29,550
When I'm done as usual, I will
give each bone a proper name.

231
00:11:29,550 --> 00:11:32,980
The first bone on the line
will be the trail route.

232
00:11:32,980 --> 00:11:35,540
Back in object mode,
I've selected the sword,

233
00:11:35,540 --> 00:11:37,300
then the armature,

234
00:11:37,300 --> 00:11:40,150
I will switch to pause
mode and press control P

235
00:11:40,150 --> 00:11:43,533
to parent the sword to the sword bone,

236
00:11:44,470 --> 00:11:47,270
this way no need to do
any vertex painting,

237
00:11:47,270 --> 00:11:49,210
the sword is parented to this bone,

238
00:11:49,210 --> 00:11:51,780
then in edit mode on the armature,

239
00:11:51,780 --> 00:11:56,310
I will parent the trailer
route to the sword bone.

240
00:11:56,310 --> 00:11:59,070
Then I will switch back to object mode,

241
00:11:59,070 --> 00:12:00,983
select my trailer mesh,

242
00:12:00,983 --> 00:12:03,230
then the armature, press control P

243
00:12:03,230 --> 00:12:05,250
and use with empty groups.

244
00:12:05,250 --> 00:12:10,250
It does created a bone group
for each bone on our trail mesh

245
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:12,920
and going into edit mode,

246
00:12:12,920 --> 00:12:17,920
we can assign each vertex
group row of each loop cut

247
00:12:18,380 --> 00:12:20,690
to the corresponding bone.

248
00:12:20,690 --> 00:12:24,710
Once done, each bone will be
moving one edge of our plane,

249
00:12:24,710 --> 00:12:27,900
and you have just finished
the rig, so it's very simple.

250
00:12:27,900 --> 00:12:29,950
Now to make it easier to read,

251
00:12:29,950 --> 00:12:32,890
what I will do is that
I will reduce the size

252
00:12:32,890 --> 00:12:34,240
of each bone.

253
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:37,670
Reducing the size of
each bone in edit mode

254
00:12:37,670 --> 00:12:41,740
won't affect any of the
deformation we just created,

255
00:12:41,740 --> 00:12:45,220
and it will make them easier to identify.

256
00:12:45,220 --> 00:12:49,570
We can then add a subdivision
modifier to our mesh

257
00:12:49,570 --> 00:12:53,000
and move it upon the armature modifier.

258
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:56,650
And instead of using the cat
wheel clock interpolation

259
00:12:56,650 --> 00:12:58,810
for the subdivision modifier,

260
00:12:58,810 --> 00:13:02,060
we will use the simple subdivision method

261
00:13:02,060 --> 00:13:05,310
so that you can then apply
the subdivision modifier

262
00:13:05,310 --> 00:13:09,890
and export your mesh if you
want to in any game engine.

263
00:13:09,890 --> 00:13:12,940
By placing the subdivision modify first,

264
00:13:12,940 --> 00:13:15,320
we will get a smooth deformation,

265
00:13:15,320 --> 00:13:16,230
and if you want,

266
00:13:16,230 --> 00:13:19,090
you can apply the subdivision modifier,

267
00:13:19,090 --> 00:13:22,270
and your mesh is ready to be
exported to a game engine,

268
00:13:22,270 --> 00:13:25,510
but I advise you to keep
the subdivision modifier

269
00:13:25,510 --> 00:13:26,750
without applying it,

270
00:13:26,750 --> 00:13:30,810
because there are option to
apply it during the export.

271
00:13:30,810 --> 00:13:32,050
For the demonstration,

272
00:13:32,050 --> 00:13:34,960
I will switch the bone display to be bone,

273
00:13:34,960 --> 00:13:38,280
and that will scale them so
that it's easier to select them

274
00:13:38,280 --> 00:13:39,740
and identify them.

275
00:13:39,740 --> 00:13:43,660
Again, this has no
influence on the deformation

276
00:13:43,660 --> 00:13:45,950
or on the rig functionalities.

277
00:13:45,950 --> 00:13:49,270
So now we are done for
this step of the rigging,

278
00:13:49,270 --> 00:13:51,300
we just need to animate the sword.

279
00:13:51,300 --> 00:13:55,500
So I've hidden the trail
effects, I've hidden

280
00:13:55,500 --> 00:13:57,830
all the bone but the sword bone,

281
00:13:57,830 --> 00:14:01,640
and I've made a rapid
animation of the sword.

282
00:14:01,640 --> 00:14:03,750
Time to see our little trick

283
00:14:03,750 --> 00:14:05,793
that will generate the trail effect.

284
00:14:06,700 --> 00:14:08,420
The process is super simple,

285
00:14:08,420 --> 00:14:10,280
once you've finished your animation,

286
00:14:10,280 --> 00:14:12,560
select the trail route bone,

287
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:14,340
then trade one,

288
00:14:14,340 --> 00:14:18,380
press control shift to see
and add a copy transformation,

289
00:14:18,380 --> 00:14:20,980
and do it for each bone.

290
00:14:20,980 --> 00:14:22,560
It will collapse the trail

291
00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:25,900
since every bone will be
one on top of each other,

292
00:14:25,900 --> 00:14:28,140
so the vertices of our trail

293
00:14:28,140 --> 00:14:30,520
will be one on top of each other.

294
00:14:30,520 --> 00:14:33,660
So nothing will happen
when we play the animation.

295
00:14:33,660 --> 00:14:36,660
But the trick is to bake the animation

296
00:14:36,660 --> 00:14:38,530
and offset it in time.

297
00:14:38,530 --> 00:14:41,360
So we'll select the free constraint bone,

298
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:46,340
press F3, search for bake
and choose bake action.

299
00:14:46,340 --> 00:14:51,000
We will select only selected
visual king clear constraint

300
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:53,440
and overwrite current action.

301
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:56,600
Boom! All the bones have
lost their constraint,

302
00:14:56,600 --> 00:14:58,460
but now we can move them.

303
00:14:58,460 --> 00:15:02,410
But now I will select all
the key frames of the bone,

304
00:15:02,410 --> 00:15:04,310
but the first key frame,

305
00:15:04,310 --> 00:15:07,690
and I will offset them by one frame.

306
00:15:07,690 --> 00:15:12,450
G ID is two offset trail one by one frame,

307
00:15:12,450 --> 00:15:17,390
trail two by two frame and
trail three by three frame.

308
00:15:17,390 --> 00:15:20,900
And we keep the first
frame to avoid any popping.

309
00:15:20,900 --> 00:15:24,080
Now, each bone is playing
the same animation,

310
00:15:24,080 --> 00:15:27,870
but with a bit of delay
compared to the blade motion.

311
00:15:27,870 --> 00:15:30,630
And voila, we got our effect.

312
00:15:30,630 --> 00:15:33,000
But when the blade is rotating backward,

313
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:34,990
we get a strange distortion.

314
00:15:34,990 --> 00:15:38,900
To fix this issue, we just
need to select our trail mesh

315
00:15:38,900 --> 00:15:43,900
and under the armature
modifier, use preserve volume.

316
00:15:43,970 --> 00:15:47,350
Then if you want to fine
tweak the trail size,

317
00:15:47,350 --> 00:15:51,080
you can switch from auto
snap to no auto snap

318
00:15:51,080 --> 00:15:53,480
in the key frames snapping menu.

319
00:15:53,480 --> 00:15:56,700
Now you can move your key
frame as smooth as you want,

320
00:15:56,700 --> 00:16:00,320
or with the interval you want
and make the trail shorter,

321
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:02,070
bigger, whatever you want.

322
00:16:02,070 --> 00:16:04,360
And if you need to create another effect,

323
00:16:04,360 --> 00:16:06,610
just create a new animation,

324
00:16:06,610 --> 00:16:09,150
create the copy transformed, constraint,

325
00:16:09,150 --> 00:16:12,320
peg the animation, and
offset it, and you're done.

326
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:16,480
There other ways to create
this kind of effect in unity,

327
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:20,460
but this method is totally
relevant and reliable,

328
00:16:20,460 --> 00:16:23,890
and you can preview it or
use it directly in blender.

329
00:16:23,890 --> 00:16:26,930
So that's very cool to have
your preview in blender

330
00:16:26,930 --> 00:16:29,160
and the same thing in your game engine.

331
00:16:29,160 --> 00:16:30,750
This is the end of the video,

332
00:16:30,750 --> 00:16:34,400
but before we wrap up,
a bit of self promotion.
