00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:01,710
- [Pierre] In this video,

2
00:00:01,710 --> 00:00:05,080
we will see how Blender's
camera work and how to use it.

3
00:00:05,080 --> 00:00:08,670
I've created a little
scene including a camera

4
00:00:08,670 --> 00:00:11,780
that we can find also in the outliner.

5
00:00:11,780 --> 00:00:13,560
To switch back into camera view,

6
00:00:13,560 --> 00:00:16,550
you just have to press zero on the numpad.

7
00:00:16,550 --> 00:00:19,520
We can find our camera
object, named the camera,

8
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:22,900
and the camera properties
in the properties editor.

9
00:00:22,900 --> 00:00:25,270
You can place the camera by moving it

10
00:00:25,270 --> 00:00:28,920
and rotating it as you will
do with any other object.

11
00:00:28,920 --> 00:00:32,040
Or you can frame the
view in the 3D viewport

12
00:00:32,040 --> 00:00:34,010
and press Control + Alt + zero

13
00:00:34,010 --> 00:00:37,913
so that the camera view will
match your current custom view.

14
00:00:40,060 --> 00:00:45,060
The camera format is on the
output size of your document.

15
00:00:45,857 --> 00:00:49,460
Basically the ratio of the output image.

16
00:00:49,460 --> 00:00:52,240
between its width and it's height,

17
00:00:52,240 --> 00:00:55,973
the resolution doesn't
matter, only the ratio matter.

18
00:00:57,690 --> 00:00:59,730
There are different camera type.

19
00:00:59,730 --> 00:01:03,750
By default, the camera type
will be set to perspective

20
00:01:03,750 --> 00:01:07,100
and the output is the same
as in the perspective view.

21
00:01:07,100 --> 00:01:09,670
If we switch to autographic,

22
00:01:09,670 --> 00:01:13,940
the autographic scale will
allow you to zoom in and out.

23
00:01:13,940 --> 00:01:16,120
You can't zoom by moving the camera.

24
00:01:16,120 --> 00:01:19,820
Using cycle, you can
also switch to panoramic.

25
00:01:19,820 --> 00:01:23,880
It won't be supported in Evi,
because you need ray tracing.

26
00:01:23,880 --> 00:01:28,880
It allows you to do a free
60 degree angle point of view

27
00:01:29,100 --> 00:01:33,860
ideal for VR experiences
or to create your own HDRi.

28
00:01:34,980 --> 00:01:36,570
With the prospective camera,

29
00:01:36,570 --> 00:01:38,230
playing with the focal length

30
00:01:38,230 --> 00:01:41,290
will allow you to zoom in and out.

31
00:01:41,290 --> 00:01:43,360
The longer the focal length,

32
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:46,340
the more zoomed will be your picture.

33
00:01:46,340 --> 00:01:50,060
And the more compressed
will be the perspective,

34
00:01:50,060 --> 00:01:53,550
meaning that you will
get closer and closer

35
00:01:53,550 --> 00:01:55,110
to an autographic view.

36
00:01:55,110 --> 00:01:57,180
The smaller the focal length,

37
00:01:57,180 --> 00:02:01,880
the wider will be your angle
of view, or less zoomed,

38
00:02:01,880 --> 00:02:06,010
and you will create a lot of
distortion in the perspective.

39
00:02:06,010 --> 00:02:10,810
You can shift the camera
frame on the X and Y axis.

40
00:02:10,810 --> 00:02:14,110
It doesn't exactly behave as a rotation.

41
00:02:14,110 --> 00:02:18,060
It's currently of setting
the position of the camera

42
00:02:18,060 --> 00:02:22,120
on the left of the right, but
we keep the same perspective

43
00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:25,220
as when we are framing
the center of the view.

44
00:02:25,220 --> 00:02:28,140
I personally never used this option.

45
00:02:28,140 --> 00:02:29,840
To better understand clipping,

46
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:33,720
I will go into the viewport
display and enable limits.

47
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:38,300
A line appear in our 3D
viewport, showing these limits.

48
00:02:38,300 --> 00:02:41,710
This limit line show us
the clipping distance.

49
00:02:41,710 --> 00:02:44,630
If I increase the clipping start,

50
00:02:44,630 --> 00:02:48,140
it will move away the first polygon

51
00:02:48,140 --> 00:02:49,990
that is rendered by the camera

52
00:02:49,990 --> 00:02:54,260
and we can see the limit
line updating in our 3D view.

53
00:02:54,260 --> 00:02:57,130
On the other end, changing the end value

54
00:02:57,130 --> 00:03:01,170
will change how far a
can be from the camera

55
00:03:01,170 --> 00:03:02,510
and being rendered.

56
00:03:02,510 --> 00:03:06,000
As you may know, computers,
don't like infinity

57
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:09,310
and we can't render an image
with an infinite depth.

58
00:03:09,310 --> 00:03:11,663
The calculation would never end.

59
00:03:13,640 --> 00:03:16,510
Real camera have a physical sensor

60
00:03:16,510 --> 00:03:19,590
that allow them to capture the image.

61
00:03:19,590 --> 00:03:21,620
But with our virtual camera,

62
00:03:21,620 --> 00:03:23,160
the only thing we have to know

63
00:03:23,160 --> 00:03:26,140
is that the zoom or angle view

64
00:03:26,140 --> 00:03:30,770
is a ratio between the focal
length and the sensor size.

65
00:03:30,770 --> 00:03:33,670
So basically you may
never change this value

66
00:03:33,670 --> 00:03:36,223
and only play with the focal length.

67
00:03:38,110 --> 00:03:41,800
You may not need to use
the safe area that much.

68
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:44,600
When enabled, you will see frame appearing

69
00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:45,770
in your camera view.

70
00:03:45,770 --> 00:03:50,770
They were origin only here to
fit different screen sizes.

71
00:03:50,840 --> 00:03:54,590
All TV may not have the same image ratio

72
00:03:54,590 --> 00:03:57,520
and sometime the image was clipped.

73
00:03:57,520 --> 00:03:59,750
So you could use this to set the limit

74
00:03:59,750 --> 00:04:03,940
between what could be cut and
what is currently in frame.

75
00:04:03,940 --> 00:04:05,890
But now most of our screen

76
00:04:05,890 --> 00:04:08,680
do compensate the screen differences.

77
00:04:08,680 --> 00:04:12,400
But they are still great
if you want to set a title,

78
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:16,940
for example, in your frame or
if you want to add subtitle,

79
00:04:16,940 --> 00:04:19,570
knowing that a part of the picture

80
00:04:19,570 --> 00:04:22,570
will be occluded by the subtitle

81
00:04:22,570 --> 00:04:25,660
and making sure that you
keep all the focal points

82
00:04:25,660 --> 00:04:28,420
inside the inner frames.

83
00:04:28,420 --> 00:04:31,070
You can add the background
image as you will do

84
00:04:31,070 --> 00:04:32,660
in the 3D viewport.

85
00:04:32,660 --> 00:04:34,300
And under viewpoint display,

86
00:04:34,300 --> 00:04:38,000
you can display a lot of
information regarding your camera.

87
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,810
We can already see our creeping range,

88
00:04:40,810 --> 00:04:45,270
but we will also be able to
enable the limit of the mist.

89
00:04:45,270 --> 00:04:48,080
It's currently overlaid upon the limit,

90
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:49,610
so it's a bit hard to see,

91
00:04:49,610 --> 00:04:52,170
but we'll see it better just after.

92
00:04:52,170 --> 00:04:55,730
The mist pass is to be
used in the compositing.

93
00:04:55,730 --> 00:04:57,660
So to be able to access it,

94
00:04:57,660 --> 00:05:00,960
you have to go to the
render layers and enable it.

95
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:03,610
Then we need to render our picture.

96
00:05:03,610 --> 00:05:05,960
It will generate a
black and white picture,

97
00:05:05,960 --> 00:05:08,320
the black being the closer to the camera

98
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:10,420
and the white the further away.

99
00:05:10,420 --> 00:05:13,320
Any rendered value closer to camera

100
00:05:13,320 --> 00:05:15,677
and the start limit will be black,

101
00:05:15,677 --> 00:05:20,230
any rendered value beyond
the end value of the limit

102
00:05:20,230 --> 00:05:21,640
will be white.

103
00:05:21,640 --> 00:05:25,540
This is a path very useful
to give depth to your render,

104
00:05:25,540 --> 00:05:30,540
creating atmospherical
perspective, like fog for example.

105
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:32,210
To change its limit,

106
00:05:32,210 --> 00:05:34,800
you have to have it enabled in the layer

107
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:37,240
and then go to the world properties

108
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:39,900
and go in the mist path tab.

109
00:05:39,900 --> 00:05:42,560
Here, you will Find the
option to change the limits

110
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:45,400
and also the falloff behavior.

111
00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:48,570
The sensor will display the
focal point of the camera,

112
00:05:48,570 --> 00:05:50,890
so we'll see that a little later.

113
00:05:50,890 --> 00:05:53,710
The name option will display
the name of the camera

114
00:05:53,710 --> 00:05:56,000
just under the camera view.

115
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,700
The passepartout option

116
00:05:57,700 --> 00:06:01,920
will allow you to increase the
opacity of the passepartout

117
00:06:01,920 --> 00:06:05,900
to currently occlude what's
outside of the camera.

118
00:06:05,900 --> 00:06:09,350
When working on the shot, I
advise you to double check it

119
00:06:09,350 --> 00:06:11,880
with the passepartout alpha set to one.

120
00:06:11,880 --> 00:06:13,450
Because the fact that you see

121
00:06:13,450 --> 00:06:17,470
beyond the boundaries of
the camera is misleading.

122
00:06:17,470 --> 00:06:21,470
It seems that the composition
is wider or more open

123
00:06:21,470 --> 00:06:24,320
and you can anticipate what's outside

124
00:06:24,320 --> 00:06:26,080
of what you're framing.

125
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:28,510
And so you are mentally anticipating

126
00:06:28,510 --> 00:06:31,390
the motion of your character
or where he's going

127
00:06:31,390 --> 00:06:35,130
and what is going to
be in the camera shot,

128
00:06:35,130 --> 00:06:39,350
which in the end, won't be
displayed in the current shots

129
00:06:39,350 --> 00:06:40,183
you are filming.

130
00:06:41,940 --> 00:06:43,160
In the previous video,

131
00:06:43,160 --> 00:06:46,287
I've explained you how
composition was important,

132
00:06:46,287 --> 00:06:48,280
how you have to try to give sense

133
00:06:48,280 --> 00:06:49,880
to everything you're doing.

134
00:06:49,880 --> 00:06:53,710
In this regard, composition
guides are super useful.

135
00:06:53,710 --> 00:06:55,410
You would find several of them

136
00:06:55,410 --> 00:06:58,470
are related to different
composition theory,

137
00:06:58,470 --> 00:07:00,110
like the golden ratio.

138
00:07:00,110 --> 00:07:04,080
So if you have studied composition
through hub, for example,

139
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:05,330
you won't be lost.

140
00:07:05,330 --> 00:07:09,010
If you're not that used
to it, just use the third,

141
00:07:09,010 --> 00:07:11,350
it's the most important thing.

142
00:07:11,350 --> 00:07:14,240
Make sure that the
important part of your shot

143
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:18,110
are inside the third or aligned with them.

144
00:07:18,110 --> 00:07:21,480
For example, I'm aligning
the head of my character

145
00:07:21,480 --> 00:07:23,910
with the top right third,

146
00:07:23,910 --> 00:07:27,840
and he's looking toward deep open third.

147
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:30,090
If I move him on the other side,

148
00:07:30,090 --> 00:07:32,050
we still have a focus on him

149
00:07:32,050 --> 00:07:33,880
but that fact that he's looking

150
00:07:33,880 --> 00:07:36,580
at the closed side of the camera

151
00:07:36,580 --> 00:07:40,660
leads your audience to
watch outside of the frame.

152
00:07:40,660 --> 00:07:43,390
And unless this is an artistic choice

153
00:07:43,390 --> 00:07:45,680
it doesn't look great that much.

154
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:48,800
So what we can do is
just rotate the character

155
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:51,760
and keep him aligned on those third,

156
00:07:51,760 --> 00:07:55,340
but it will look at the
other side of the screen

157
00:07:55,340 --> 00:07:57,210
on the open side,

158
00:07:57,210 --> 00:07:59,950
and then offset this
fear on the foreground

159
00:07:59,950 --> 00:08:03,180
because it's occluding the first third.

160
00:08:03,180 --> 00:08:06,130
And so it becomes a point of interest

161
00:08:06,130 --> 00:08:09,420
while it might not be
something very interesting,

162
00:08:09,420 --> 00:08:12,850
unless your character is
watching it for example.

163
00:08:12,850 --> 00:08:15,350
But simply moving it on the side

164
00:08:15,350 --> 00:08:18,020
make the competition a little better.

165
00:08:18,020 --> 00:08:20,690
Composition in itself is a big topic

166
00:08:20,690 --> 00:08:22,910
and will deserve a whole course.

167
00:08:22,910 --> 00:08:25,200
But you can start with those simple rules

168
00:08:25,200 --> 00:08:27,423
to make opening compositions.

169
00:08:28,680 --> 00:08:31,470
Let's now have a look to depth of field.

170
00:08:31,470 --> 00:08:34,750
When activated, you might
not see the different away.

171
00:08:34,750 --> 00:08:36,090
What you have to know first

172
00:08:36,090 --> 00:08:41,000
is that Blender is currently
focusing on this target

173
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,630
and we can move it
directly in the 3D viewport

174
00:08:43,630 --> 00:08:45,880
by left clicking and dragging

175
00:08:45,880 --> 00:08:48,500
or changing the focus distance here.

176
00:08:48,500 --> 00:08:52,550
Using the eyedropper, you
can also select an object,

177
00:08:52,550 --> 00:08:55,410
asking lender to keep it in focus.

178
00:08:55,410 --> 00:09:00,130
To make it clearer, let's
reduce the f-stop to 0.1.

179
00:09:00,130 --> 00:09:02,770
This will make our picture way more blurry

180
00:09:02,770 --> 00:09:05,690
and we can see that even
if I move the camera

181
00:09:05,690 --> 00:09:10,130
or I move the sphere, Blender
will keep the sphere in focus

182
00:09:10,130 --> 00:09:12,290
meaning that it won't be blurred

183
00:09:12,290 --> 00:09:15,200
while everything else
around it gets blurry.

184
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:18,990
If I want to select
another object to focus on

185
00:09:18,990 --> 00:09:21,860
I can select it through the menu.

186
00:09:21,860 --> 00:09:23,610
If I select the ground,

187
00:09:23,610 --> 00:09:26,200
you can see that the
focus point is aligned

188
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:28,960
with the origin of the ground object.

189
00:09:28,960 --> 00:09:31,950
Not the whole object is in focus.

190
00:09:31,950 --> 00:09:34,350
This is a pretty important information.

191
00:09:34,350 --> 00:09:37,250
Blender will use the origin of any object

192
00:09:37,250 --> 00:09:39,610
that is used as a focus object.

193
00:09:39,610 --> 00:09:42,850
Finally, you can copy
the name of the object

194
00:09:42,850 --> 00:09:43,820
you want to focus on

195
00:09:43,820 --> 00:09:48,630
and hovering over the focus
object slot, press Control + V.

196
00:09:48,630 --> 00:09:50,840
Let's talk a bit about the f-stop.

197
00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:53,450
Here I'm focusing on the first sphere

198
00:09:53,450 --> 00:09:57,860
so we can see the cube on the
left is perfectly in focus.

199
00:09:57,860 --> 00:10:00,190
If I now move away the focus point

200
00:10:00,190 --> 00:10:03,250
we can see that the next cube is in focus.

201
00:10:03,250 --> 00:10:04,547
I will get back to the previous

202
00:10:04,547 --> 00:10:06,930
and we can see it's back in focus.

203
00:10:06,930 --> 00:10:10,500
Increasing the f-stop will
visually reduce the noise,

204
00:10:10,500 --> 00:10:12,380
but it's not about this.

205
00:10:12,380 --> 00:10:17,380
The f-stop value is the
range of what is in focus.

206
00:10:17,850 --> 00:10:22,280
The higher f-stop value,
the higher the range

207
00:10:22,280 --> 00:10:25,970
from the focus point will be in focus.

208
00:10:25,970 --> 00:10:30,520
Plus the further away is the
focal point from the camera,

209
00:10:30,520 --> 00:10:33,240
the larger will be the focus area.

210
00:10:33,240 --> 00:10:37,490
To give you an example, if
I use the same f-stop value

211
00:10:37,490 --> 00:10:40,230
and I focus on the very first cube,

212
00:10:40,230 --> 00:10:43,370
I might add two cube in focus.

213
00:10:43,370 --> 00:10:48,080
While if I focus on a
cube that is further away

214
00:10:48,080 --> 00:10:52,130
I might have four or five
or six cube in focus.

215
00:10:52,130 --> 00:10:54,380
So the focus range gets bigger,

216
00:10:54,380 --> 00:10:58,000
the further away the focus point is.

217
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,320
The other concern is
that the depth of field

218
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:02,170
is based on a distance.

219
00:11:02,170 --> 00:11:05,520
So depending on the scale of your scene,

220
00:11:05,520 --> 00:11:09,290
the blur effect behavior
might look different

221
00:11:09,290 --> 00:11:14,000
and you may have to play with
a bigger range of f-stop value

222
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,123
to see a difference in the blur.

223
00:11:17,460 --> 00:11:21,550
It's pretty common to rig
cameras with simple objects.

224
00:11:21,550 --> 00:11:25,160
Adding an empty, parenting
the camera to the empty

225
00:11:25,160 --> 00:11:26,680
and make the empty rotate

226
00:11:26,680 --> 00:11:29,330
to create a turntable, for example.

227
00:11:29,330 --> 00:11:32,640
Another common technique
is to use an empty

228
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:37,100
and make the camera through
constraint, tracking this empty.

229
00:11:37,100 --> 00:11:39,830
This way you can move the camera in space

230
00:11:39,830 --> 00:11:43,930
and it will keep focus on
whatever you are looking at.

231
00:11:43,930 --> 00:11:46,810
It makes the camera easier to handle

232
00:11:46,810 --> 00:11:50,310
and also animating the
camera a bit easier.

233
00:11:50,310 --> 00:11:51,920
But there is an issue.

234
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:54,520
As we are using multiple objects,

235
00:11:54,520 --> 00:11:57,640
if I insert a key frame
on those both empty

236
00:11:57,640 --> 00:12:01,170
to create some kind of
fancy camera motion,

237
00:12:01,170 --> 00:12:05,650
I will have two different
action, one per empty.

238
00:12:05,650 --> 00:12:09,340
And if I start animating
the properties of the camera

239
00:12:09,340 --> 00:12:11,180
like the focal length,

240
00:12:11,180 --> 00:12:15,080
it will create even
another animation or action

241
00:12:15,080 --> 00:12:17,420
just for those properties.

242
00:12:17,420 --> 00:12:20,740
Then modifying the camera
animation will be a pain

243
00:12:20,740 --> 00:12:24,500
because I will have to
update different actions.

244
00:12:24,500 --> 00:12:28,300
Fortunately, Blender comes
with a built-in add on

245
00:12:28,300 --> 00:12:29,810
that will greatly help you.

246
00:12:29,810 --> 00:12:33,800
If you go to edit preferences
and go to the add on tab,

247
00:12:33,800 --> 00:12:38,400
search for camera and
activate the add camera rigs.

248
00:12:38,400 --> 00:12:41,570
From there, when you press
Shift + A to add the camera,

249
00:12:41,570 --> 00:12:44,740
you will have the choice
through different camera rigs.

250
00:12:44,740 --> 00:12:47,730
The classic camera, the Dolly camera rig

251
00:12:47,730 --> 00:12:50,120
and the Crane camera rig.

252
00:12:50,120 --> 00:12:52,470
There is also a 2D camera rig

253
00:12:52,470 --> 00:12:54,470
that we won't be using in this course.

254
00:12:54,470 --> 00:12:58,090
While the Crane camera
rig simulates a crane,

255
00:12:58,090 --> 00:13:00,370
the Dolly camera rig is very close

256
00:13:00,370 --> 00:13:02,680
but there is a little more freedom to it,

257
00:13:02,680 --> 00:13:04,860
so we will use this one.

258
00:13:04,860 --> 00:13:08,650
The camera rig is very
close to our character rig.

259
00:13:08,650 --> 00:13:12,640
There is a root bone that allow
us to move the whole camera.

260
00:13:12,640 --> 00:13:14,400
The aim controller allow us

261
00:13:14,400 --> 00:13:18,720
to orientate the camera
to this controller.

262
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:22,160
The camera controller allow
us to move the camera in space

263
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:25,610
and it will still follow the aim,

264
00:13:25,610 --> 00:13:29,260
while the offset will allow
us to move the camera in space

265
00:13:29,260 --> 00:13:31,600
but it won't rotate toward the aim.

266
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:34,970
And in addition to this,
we have all the option

267
00:13:34,970 --> 00:13:36,610
of the camera properties

268
00:13:36,610 --> 00:13:39,490
that are exposed directly in the rig.

269
00:13:39,490 --> 00:13:43,710
So we can animate those
properties directly using the rig

270
00:13:43,710 --> 00:13:46,450
and it will create only one action

271
00:13:46,450 --> 00:13:50,870
that will gather all the
emotions of the bone controllers

272
00:13:50,870 --> 00:13:54,250
but also all the properties of the camera.

273
00:13:54,250 --> 00:13:58,880
So I do advise you to
use this rig all the time

274
00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:03,880
so that you will get used to
it, even for simple project.

275
00:14:04,040 --> 00:14:07,130
This way you will get
familiar with its mechanism

276
00:14:07,130 --> 00:14:10,020
and also some of the feature it has,

277
00:14:10,020 --> 00:14:12,800
like this focus point creation.

278
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:17,020
It will bind an empty 2D aim target

279
00:14:17,020 --> 00:14:18,850
and the aim target will allow you

280
00:14:18,850 --> 00:14:23,850
to rotate the camera but
also set the focus distance.

281
00:14:23,900 --> 00:14:26,440
To summarize, we have seen
that the camera format

282
00:14:26,440 --> 00:14:29,170
is based on the output resolution.

283
00:14:29,170 --> 00:14:30,710
There on different camera type

284
00:14:30,710 --> 00:14:34,750
with perspective and
orthographic and even panoramic

285
00:14:34,750 --> 00:14:39,460
that allow you to do a
360 degree angle shot.

286
00:14:39,460 --> 00:14:42,350
You can control the zoom and angle of view

287
00:14:42,350 --> 00:14:44,130
with the focal length.

288
00:14:44,130 --> 00:14:46,420
You can use the composition guides

289
00:14:46,420 --> 00:14:50,200
and the passepartout to
better frame your shots.

290
00:14:50,200 --> 00:14:52,460
You can control the depth of field

291
00:14:52,460 --> 00:14:57,200
using the camera focus
distance and the f-stop value.

292
00:14:57,200 --> 00:14:59,920
It's highly advised to use a camera rig

293
00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:01,763
to animate your camera.
