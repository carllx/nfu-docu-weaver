1
00:00:01,100 --> 00:00:04,170
- [Instructor] But once the
bag rotation master controller

2
00:00:04,170 --> 00:00:05,890
and the route were done,

3
00:00:05,890 --> 00:00:07,850
I've locked their transform channel

4
00:00:07,850 --> 00:00:11,740
so that I was sure I would
not edit them by mistake.

5
00:00:11,740 --> 00:00:14,420
From there, I will select
all the other controller

6
00:00:14,420 --> 00:00:17,950
and get rid of all the keys
but the very first one.

7
00:00:17,950 --> 00:00:21,110
Since the bag deformations are very fast,

8
00:00:21,110 --> 00:00:22,900
it's easier for me

9
00:00:22,900 --> 00:00:24,960
to rework them from scratch

10
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:27,940
than trying to work from
what we have locked before.

11
00:00:27,940 --> 00:00:29,590
Whenever I want to create a pose,

12
00:00:29,590 --> 00:00:31,960
I will make sure that
the previous keyframe

13
00:00:31,960 --> 00:00:33,580
is currently keyed.

14
00:00:33,580 --> 00:00:38,010
This way I'm sure to avoid
any undesired interpolations.

15
00:00:38,010 --> 00:00:41,510
On frame 12, I will kind of sculpt the bag

16
00:00:41,510 --> 00:00:44,400
as it receive the first jab

17
00:00:44,400 --> 00:00:46,490
by pushing the tweaker controller,

18
00:00:46,490 --> 00:00:48,730
and then a couple of frames later,

19
00:00:48,730 --> 00:00:50,930
I will just console all the transforms

20
00:00:50,930 --> 00:00:53,574
so that the bag recovers its shape.

21
00:00:53,574 --> 00:00:56,490
Then a frame later, I will
pull a bit the controller

22
00:00:56,490 --> 00:00:58,310
that was hit by the punch

23
00:00:58,310 --> 00:01:01,750
so that we get a very
subtle shake feeling.

24
00:01:01,750 --> 00:01:04,100
Then I will repeat the
process for the next punch.

25
00:01:04,100 --> 00:01:06,860
I will kill the controller on frame 16,

26
00:01:06,860 --> 00:01:10,310
the frame prior to the hit or impact.

27
00:01:10,310 --> 00:01:13,582
Then on frame 17, I will sculpt the bag

28
00:01:13,582 --> 00:01:15,710
by pushing the tweaker bone

29
00:01:15,710 --> 00:01:18,570
but also scaling them on one axis

30
00:01:18,570 --> 00:01:22,020
and then scaling them
down on the opposite axis.

31
00:01:22,020 --> 00:01:25,440
I'm trying to preserve
the volume of the bag.

32
00:01:25,440 --> 00:01:27,230
From there, four frames later,

33
00:01:27,230 --> 00:01:29,320
I will console all the transform.

34
00:01:29,320 --> 00:01:31,560
And then I will refine the shape

35
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:33,510
of the bag frame by frame.

36
00:01:33,510 --> 00:01:36,310
Since the hitting frame operate is short,

37
00:01:36,310 --> 00:01:38,730
it's a very fast process.

38
00:01:38,730 --> 00:01:40,640
Rebuilding the whole animation

39
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:43,860
for the whole bag took
me about half an hour.

40
00:01:43,860 --> 00:01:46,050
And then I've started over again

41
00:01:46,050 --> 00:01:49,300
with the hook, sculpting
the pose from scratch,

42
00:01:49,300 --> 00:01:51,160
using the tweaker bones.

43
00:01:51,160 --> 00:01:54,180
And as soon as I was done
with the hook, guess what.

44
00:01:54,180 --> 00:01:57,380
I did exactly the same
thing with the kick.

45
00:01:57,380 --> 00:01:59,920
I've exclusively started working

46
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:01,610
on those deformation frames,

47
00:02:01,610 --> 00:02:03,320
using the tweaker bones,

48
00:02:03,320 --> 00:02:04,560
and that's pretty important

49
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:06,800
because they are very easy to use

50
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:11,040
and to sculpt those specific impacts.

51
00:02:11,040 --> 00:02:14,580
Then I start working using
the blue controllers.

52
00:02:14,580 --> 00:02:17,060
Those are the forward
kinematic controllers

53
00:02:17,060 --> 00:02:20,490
that will allow us to
slightly bend the bag.

54
00:02:20,490 --> 00:02:23,660
We could spend hours in
the graph editor polishing

55
00:02:23,660 --> 00:02:25,550
those controllers but instead,

56
00:02:25,550 --> 00:02:28,730
I've kept the process
as simple as possible,

57
00:02:28,730 --> 00:02:31,010
keying as less frame as possible,

58
00:02:31,010 --> 00:02:34,510
and letting Blender interpolate
between those frames.

59
00:02:34,510 --> 00:02:36,300
So I'm selecting all the controllers

60
00:02:36,300 --> 00:02:38,900
from the one just upon the impact frame

61
00:02:38,900 --> 00:02:40,860
toward the tip of the bag.

62
00:02:40,860 --> 00:02:43,440
Then make sure that you
are using individual origin

63
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:48,050
so that we will be able to bend
all the controller at once.

64
00:02:48,050 --> 00:02:53,000
And just bend the bag
toward its previous position

65
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:56,280
as if it was dragging as less as possible.

66
00:02:56,280 --> 00:02:57,870
If you bend it too much,

67
00:02:57,870 --> 00:02:59,510
it won't look realistic

68
00:02:59,510 --> 00:03:01,690
because it will look too smooth.

69
00:03:01,690 --> 00:03:04,860
And from there, if you don't
jump into the graph editor,

70
00:03:04,860 --> 00:03:07,840
that's gonna be hard to make it look good.

71
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:10,550
And as soon as I reach
the next impact frame,

72
00:03:10,550 --> 00:03:14,100
I'm keying the frame before the impact

73
00:03:14,100 --> 00:03:17,160
and then I'm slightly
increasing the curvature

74
00:03:17,160 --> 00:03:19,640
of the bag on the impact.

75
00:03:19,640 --> 00:03:22,730
Then when the hook is about to happen,

76
00:03:22,730 --> 00:03:26,070
this is the time where the
bag is traveling the fastest.

77
00:03:26,070 --> 00:03:28,680
So I will slightly bend it

78
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:31,780
toward again its previous position.

79
00:03:31,780 --> 00:03:35,141
And this is how you create
this subtle dragging,

80
00:03:35,141 --> 00:03:36,870
almost for free.

81
00:03:36,870 --> 00:03:40,460
The trick is to make sure that
you manipulate all the bone

82
00:03:40,460 --> 00:03:42,500
in the chain at the same time.

83
00:03:42,500 --> 00:03:46,320
Since they have a parent
and child relationship,

84
00:03:46,320 --> 00:03:50,510
you rotate the parent that
makes the child rotating too,

85
00:03:50,510 --> 00:03:53,530
and then you apply on top
of this a bit of rotation

86
00:03:53,530 --> 00:03:55,820
on the child, et cetera, et cetera.

87
00:03:55,820 --> 00:03:59,333
And it generates a slight bend in the bag

88
00:03:59,333 --> 00:04:01,250
that looks very natural.

89
00:04:01,250 --> 00:04:04,510
The only moment where I had
to be a little more creative

90
00:04:04,510 --> 00:04:05,860
was on the kick

91
00:04:05,860 --> 00:04:09,040
where I've posed the bones frame by frame.

92
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:10,740
On the frame prior to the kick,

93
00:04:10,740 --> 00:04:13,430
I've just made the whole bag dragging

94
00:04:13,430 --> 00:04:15,080
and then on the impact,

95
00:04:15,080 --> 00:04:18,340
I first made the top part of the bag

96
00:04:18,340 --> 00:04:21,770
to rotate to the right behind
the leg of the character,

97
00:04:21,770 --> 00:04:25,060
while the lower part of
the bag will be dragging.

98
00:04:25,060 --> 00:04:27,530
So I will invert its rotation

99
00:04:27,530 --> 00:04:29,610
and rotate it a big backward.

100
00:04:29,610 --> 00:04:32,250
Since the bag is arriving very fast

101
00:04:32,250 --> 00:04:35,310
and we're kicking it
the opposite direction,

102
00:04:35,310 --> 00:04:37,970
there is a lot of deformation in the bag.

103
00:04:37,970 --> 00:04:40,680
Then as it is projected by the kick,

104
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:43,430
I will slightly bend it backward

105
00:04:43,430 --> 00:04:45,540
toward its previous position

106
00:04:45,540 --> 00:04:47,370
to make it drag a bit.

107
00:04:47,370 --> 00:04:50,070
And finally, as it hits the ground,

108
00:04:50,070 --> 00:04:52,860
I bend it toward its previous direction

109
00:04:52,860 --> 00:04:54,830
so that it is dragging again,

110
00:04:54,830 --> 00:04:58,560
and then I'll console the
rotation a couple of frame after,

111
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:00,750
and convert all the landing keys

112
00:05:00,750 --> 00:05:02,480
and the keys after to vector

113
00:05:02,480 --> 00:05:05,710
so that I have a hard slap on the ground.

114
00:05:05,710 --> 00:05:07,490
One final touch I've added

115
00:05:07,490 --> 00:05:09,540
is that I've used the tweaker controller

116
00:05:09,540 --> 00:05:11,360
to squash the bag on the ground.

117
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:13,680
In the end, it's barely noticeable

118
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:16,140
because I've kept it very subtle.

119
00:05:16,140 --> 00:05:18,270
I selected all the tweaker bone,

120
00:05:18,270 --> 00:05:21,070
inserted a keyframe on the key prior

121
00:05:21,070 --> 00:05:22,120
to squash the back

122
00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:25,670
so that I don't get any
weird interpolation.

123
00:05:25,670 --> 00:05:29,990
Then I've scaled them up
a bit on the x and y-axis

124
00:05:29,990 --> 00:05:34,330
and flatten it, scaling
it down on the z-axis.

125
00:05:34,330 --> 00:05:36,450
And then two or three frame later,

126
00:05:36,450 --> 00:05:39,800
I've consoled any scale
by pressing Alt + S.

127
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:42,430
One final detail I have revised

128
00:05:42,430 --> 00:05:44,910
but I'm not sure I've captured it

129
00:05:44,910 --> 00:05:48,690
is the rotation of the bag
just after the right cross.

130
00:05:48,690 --> 00:05:51,460
I've slightly lowered
the level of rotation

131
00:05:51,460 --> 00:05:54,730
of the bag so that it stays on screen

132
00:05:54,730 --> 00:05:57,380
while we are rotating
around the character.

133
00:05:57,380 --> 00:05:59,560
This is typically the kind of detail

134
00:05:59,560 --> 00:06:03,410
I wouldn't have taken care
of a year ago, for example.

135
00:06:03,410 --> 00:06:04,800
But it's very important

136
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:08,170
because it does improve the readability

137
00:06:08,170 --> 00:06:09,580
of your animation.

138
00:06:09,580 --> 00:06:11,830
But this is typically the kind of detail

139
00:06:11,830 --> 00:06:16,060
that will bring you to
professional level of animation

140
00:06:16,060 --> 00:06:19,970
because it shows that you
care for your audience

141
00:06:19,970 --> 00:06:22,500
and make sure that they
will get everything

142
00:06:22,500 --> 00:06:23,913
about your animation.
