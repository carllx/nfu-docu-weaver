1
00:00:00,850 --> 00:00:03,430
- The time has come to
give the final touch

2
00:00:03,430 --> 00:00:05,730
to our bouncing ball animation.

3
00:00:05,730 --> 00:00:08,690
To clearly understand
what we need to modify,

4
00:00:08,690 --> 00:00:11,470
I will change the frame
rate of the animation

5
00:00:11,470 --> 00:00:14,870
by going into the document
option frame rate.

6
00:00:14,870 --> 00:00:17,420
Here, we can find a bunch of preset

7
00:00:17,420 --> 00:00:20,320
that will set the pace of our animation.

8
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:24,540
We are currently using the
classic 24 frames per second,

9
00:00:24,540 --> 00:00:27,510
but they generally use
30 frames per seconds.

10
00:00:27,510 --> 00:00:30,520
Here, I will select a custom frame rate

11
00:00:30,520 --> 00:00:34,230
and I will set it to
five frames per second.

12
00:00:34,230 --> 00:00:37,070
Now, when I play my animation,

13
00:00:37,070 --> 00:00:39,630
it kind of play in slow motion.

14
00:00:39,630 --> 00:00:43,070
It's a good way to identify
the different position

15
00:00:43,070 --> 00:00:44,400
of the bouncing ball,

16
00:00:44,400 --> 00:00:48,050
and it can be a method
to spot spacing troubles.

17
00:00:48,050 --> 00:00:50,620
Switching back to 24 frames per second,

18
00:00:50,620 --> 00:00:52,387
I will select the object

19
00:00:52,387 --> 00:00:55,310
and go into the motion path panel.

20
00:00:55,310 --> 00:00:57,100
I will set the animation range

21
00:00:57,100 --> 00:00:59,820
from zero to 24 frames per second.

22
00:00:59,820 --> 00:01:02,420
And since this is a function I use a lot,

23
00:01:02,420 --> 00:01:05,150
I will right click on the calculate button

24
00:01:05,150 --> 00:01:07,460
and add it to my quick favorite.

25
00:01:07,460 --> 00:01:10,210
This way, when I press the cue key,

26
00:01:10,210 --> 00:01:13,570
I can access the calculate
function anywhere

27
00:01:13,570 --> 00:01:14,853
in the 3D viewport.

28
00:01:15,950 --> 00:01:18,330
You can now see our spacing

29
00:01:18,330 --> 00:01:21,880
and try to see what's
wrong with our animation.

30
00:01:21,880 --> 00:01:24,260
When an object is falling in space,

31
00:01:24,260 --> 00:01:27,660
it's accelerating until
it touches the ground.

32
00:01:27,660 --> 00:01:30,800
The speed of an object might stabilize

33
00:01:30,800 --> 00:01:32,900
due to air friction.

34
00:01:32,900 --> 00:01:36,480
But unless there is a
force pulling our ball up,

35
00:01:36,480 --> 00:01:40,270
it is simple to accelerate
until it touches the ground.

36
00:01:40,270 --> 00:01:43,370
So the spacing should be increasing

37
00:01:43,370 --> 00:01:47,140
from one frame to the
other while it's falling.

38
00:01:47,140 --> 00:01:50,500
And we can see this is what's
happening on those frames.

39
00:01:50,500 --> 00:01:54,130
Each frames forward, the
spacing is getting bigger.

40
00:01:54,130 --> 00:01:57,840
On the last frame, the
spacing is getting smaller.

41
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:00,320
It means that the ball is slowing down

42
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:03,800
before hitting the ground
and this is incorrect.

43
00:02:03,800 --> 00:02:07,000
And this is something that
we can read on the curve.

44
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,750
As explained previously,

45
00:02:08,750 --> 00:02:11,980
the curve should get
more and more vertical

46
00:02:11,980 --> 00:02:14,330
as it get closer to the value zero,

47
00:02:14,330 --> 00:02:16,310
which is our ground value.

48
00:02:16,310 --> 00:02:20,063
While here we can see
that it has this S shape

49
00:02:20,063 --> 00:02:24,570
that makes the ball slowing
down before touching the ground.

50
00:02:24,570 --> 00:02:28,880
The curve is easing out toward the ground.

51
00:02:28,880 --> 00:02:32,710
But since we have made a good
blocking of our animation,

52
00:02:32,710 --> 00:02:34,170
it doesn't look that bad.

53
00:02:34,170 --> 00:02:37,200
Those two breakdowns
are currently helping us

54
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:39,030
getting a better result.

55
00:02:39,030 --> 00:02:41,900
This is why blocking
can be pretty important.

56
00:02:41,900 --> 00:02:44,050
To fix the ground key frames,

57
00:02:44,050 --> 00:02:48,080
we just need to switch the
handle pressing V to vector.

58
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:52,170
Now I no longer have
this S shape on my curve.

59
00:02:52,170 --> 00:02:54,010
To make things even clearer,

60
00:02:54,010 --> 00:02:57,450
let's get rid of our two
break down key frames

61
00:02:57,450 --> 00:03:00,410
by selecting them and pressing the X key.

62
00:03:00,410 --> 00:03:03,860
I've also switched back
to basic ball handles.

63
00:03:03,860 --> 00:03:05,450
When I play the animation,

64
00:03:05,450 --> 00:03:09,160
you will better feel this
ease in and ease out.

65
00:03:09,160 --> 00:03:11,520
You can see the ball accelerating

66
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:15,000
when it's leaving the ground
and before it hits the ground.

67
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,800
While if I switch both handles to vector,

68
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:20,850
now we can feel that the ball is bouncing.

69
00:03:20,850 --> 00:03:22,930
To get even a better feeling,

70
00:03:22,930 --> 00:03:26,210
I will also slightly raise the curve

71
00:03:26,210 --> 00:03:30,220
by moving both vector
handles towards the outside.

72
00:03:30,220 --> 00:03:32,040
And by scaling the upper key,

73
00:03:32,040 --> 00:03:34,570
I will make the ball raising faster

74
00:03:34,570 --> 00:03:36,820
and holding a bit more in the air.

75
00:03:36,820 --> 00:03:40,270
I have bring more
contrast into my animation

76
00:03:40,270 --> 00:03:42,420
by changing the shape of the curve,

77
00:03:42,420 --> 00:03:44,900
and now it's more stylized.

78
00:03:44,900 --> 00:03:46,610
A little touch we can add

79
00:03:46,610 --> 00:03:48,410
to make it even more appealing,

80
00:03:48,410 --> 00:03:52,750
is to slightly offset the
upper key of one frame.

81
00:03:52,750 --> 00:03:55,250
This way we don't have the same timing

82
00:03:55,250 --> 00:03:59,030
when the ball is rising
than when it's falling down.

83
00:03:59,030 --> 00:04:02,970
We can recalculate the
motion path of our animation

84
00:04:02,970 --> 00:04:05,450
by clicking the update path button.

85
00:04:05,450 --> 00:04:07,990
And instead of the in range option,

86
00:04:07,990 --> 00:04:10,310
I've switched to around frame.

87
00:04:10,310 --> 00:04:13,010
From there I can choose how many frame

88
00:04:13,010 --> 00:04:15,460
I want to see on my motion path

89
00:04:15,460 --> 00:04:18,350
before and after the current
position of the ball.

90
00:04:18,350 --> 00:04:21,000
Now, when I look at
the spacing of my ball,

91
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,470
we can see that when
it's leaving the ground,

92
00:04:23,470 --> 00:04:25,830
it has the biggest spacing.

93
00:04:25,830 --> 00:04:28,850
And it's slowing down when
reaching the highest position,

94
00:04:28,850 --> 00:04:30,790
which is correct.

95
00:04:30,790 --> 00:04:32,320
When the ball is falling down,

96
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:34,910
we also get the proper spacing.

97
00:04:34,910 --> 00:04:36,640
It's getting bigger and bigger

98
00:04:36,640 --> 00:04:39,424
as we approach the contacting key frame.

99
00:04:39,424 --> 00:04:42,880
We now have a pretty cool bouncing rhythm,

100
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:46,350
so let's work a bit on
the scaling of our ball

101
00:04:46,350 --> 00:04:49,890
or more precisely on it's
squashing and stretching.

102
00:04:49,890 --> 00:04:52,050
Pressing Alt+H in the graph editor

103
00:04:52,050 --> 00:04:53,520
will reveal all the curve.

104
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:55,900
I can hide the Z location curve,

105
00:04:55,900 --> 00:04:58,860
so that we focus on the scale curve.

106
00:04:58,860 --> 00:05:01,950
Since our balls squashing
is pretty brutal,

107
00:05:01,950 --> 00:05:04,960
we can switch those key frames to vector.

108
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:07,033
If we have a very slow squashing,

109
00:05:07,033 --> 00:05:09,710
we will have kept them as it is,

110
00:05:09,710 --> 00:05:12,830
as the ball would be
progressively absorbing

111
00:05:12,830 --> 00:05:15,120
the impact for its squash.

112
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:16,670
Pardon for the animation,

113
00:05:16,670 --> 00:05:19,630
I'm trying to get a feeling
of the motion of the ball.

114
00:05:19,630 --> 00:05:21,200
When the ball squash,

115
00:05:21,200 --> 00:05:25,210
we can imagine it's a
continuity of its fall.

116
00:05:25,210 --> 00:05:28,820
And since we are working
on the cycling animation,

117
00:05:28,820 --> 00:05:31,480
the latest frame is the same as the first.

118
00:05:31,480 --> 00:05:34,460
So if I check the frame before the latest,

119
00:05:34,460 --> 00:05:36,890
I can see that I have a big spacing

120
00:05:36,890 --> 00:05:39,750
between the base of my
ball and the ground.

121
00:05:39,750 --> 00:05:42,941
So it will be better
if I kept this thinner

122
00:05:42,941 --> 00:05:45,700
for the spacing of the squashing.

123
00:05:45,700 --> 00:05:48,740
Meaning that I will offset the squash pose

124
00:05:48,740 --> 00:05:50,720
of frame two on frame one.

125
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:54,150
And we will have a very
stretched pose on frame zero

126
00:05:54,150 --> 00:05:56,660
and a very squashed one on frame one.

127
00:05:56,660 --> 00:05:59,890
And so it will transition
with the full better.

128
00:05:59,890 --> 00:06:03,800
We are now getting a
more impactful squashing

129
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:06,080
if we compare with previous version.

130
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:10,320
But since we have offset
one frame for the squashing,

131
00:06:10,320 --> 00:06:12,730
we should do the same for the stretching.

132
00:06:12,730 --> 00:06:14,270
As you can see my spacing

133
00:06:14,270 --> 00:06:17,060
between frame three
and four is very small.

134
00:06:17,060 --> 00:06:19,060
So I want a faster animation.

135
00:06:19,060 --> 00:06:21,880
I will offset the keys one frame before,

136
00:06:21,880 --> 00:06:24,890
and I will also switch them to vector.

137
00:06:24,890 --> 00:06:26,990
Next is the air squashing.

138
00:06:26,990 --> 00:06:29,540
I offset the key frame
where the ball recover

139
00:06:29,540 --> 00:06:33,360
its round shape and then
it's getting squashed again

140
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:36,450
with the inner star when it's
reached the highest point.

141
00:06:36,450 --> 00:06:39,100
Since the highest point is on frame 15,

142
00:06:39,100 --> 00:06:41,570
I will make it squash on frame 15.

143
00:06:41,570 --> 00:06:44,400
I'd like to slightly delay the squashing,

144
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:47,820
so what I will do is that I
will duplicate all the keys

145
00:06:47,820 --> 00:06:52,490
on frame eight and offset
them onto frame 10 or 11.

146
00:06:52,490 --> 00:06:55,410
It makes all the skate
curve becoming flat,

147
00:06:55,410 --> 00:06:58,540
which means that from
frame eight to frame 11,

148
00:06:58,540 --> 00:07:00,480
the ball is perfectly round.

149
00:07:00,480 --> 00:07:02,990
And as the ball will be accelerating

150
00:07:02,990 --> 00:07:04,870
to get back to the ground.

151
00:07:04,870 --> 00:07:07,020
I'd like to slightly offset the time

152
00:07:07,020 --> 00:07:09,820
it's starts to stretch by two frames

153
00:07:09,820 --> 00:07:13,430
because the ball is falling
faster than it is raising.

154
00:07:13,430 --> 00:07:17,404
So making it stretching a
little sooner does make sense.

155
00:07:17,404 --> 00:07:20,290
Animating is not a linear art,

156
00:07:20,290 --> 00:07:23,360
you will need to go back
and forth a lot of time.

157
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:25,910
And while the animation
gets more appealing,

158
00:07:25,910 --> 00:07:28,480
I feel like there is
something a little off

159
00:07:28,480 --> 00:07:31,550
and since we've been
offsetting a lot of curve,

160
00:07:31,550 --> 00:07:33,400
the ball is starting to relax

161
00:07:33,400 --> 00:07:35,430
while it hasn't left the ground.

162
00:07:35,430 --> 00:07:38,680
Meaning that the ball should
be in air on frame four.

163
00:07:38,680 --> 00:07:42,960
So I just need to re-edit
the curve for the Z location

164
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:45,870
and offset the stopping
point by one frame.

165
00:07:45,870 --> 00:07:48,820
And now when they play again my animation,

166
00:07:48,820 --> 00:07:51,320
I feel like there is something a bit off

167
00:07:51,320 --> 00:07:52,620
on the air squashing.

168
00:07:52,620 --> 00:07:56,440
The ball slows and then
it starts squashing.

169
00:07:56,440 --> 00:08:00,020
And if we double check the
spacing of the base of the ball,

170
00:08:00,020 --> 00:08:03,140
we can see that as soon
as it starts squashing,

171
00:08:03,140 --> 00:08:06,060
the easing gets stronger
and that's better.

172
00:08:06,060 --> 00:08:09,740
The yellow arrows are getting
smaller progressively,

173
00:08:09,740 --> 00:08:12,830
while there is a big difference
between the two red arrows.

174
00:08:12,830 --> 00:08:14,780
So even if it's very subtle,

175
00:08:14,780 --> 00:08:17,440
it makes the animation a bit weird.

176
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:19,430
So again I can fix this

177
00:08:19,430 --> 00:08:23,440
by simply offsetting the
squashing key frames,

178
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:27,610
the plateau we have created
before just by one frame.

179
00:08:27,610 --> 00:08:29,780
Making it happening a little sooner,

180
00:08:29,780 --> 00:08:33,253
so that it will better
blend while it's raising.

181
00:08:34,710 --> 00:08:37,760
I guess you may ask
yourself how do I get rid

182
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:40,460
of the grid of the motion path,

183
00:08:40,460 --> 00:08:41,910
et cetera my fried issue.

184
00:08:41,910 --> 00:08:44,800
It's by deactivating the overlay here.

185
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:47,580
And since this is something
I do all the time,

186
00:08:47,580 --> 00:08:51,440
what I did is that I set a
shortcut onto the overlay.

187
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:54,310
You can assign the shortcut to any tool

188
00:08:54,310 --> 00:08:56,710
or option in blender by simply

189
00:08:56,710 --> 00:09:00,610
right clicking on it and
selecting assign shortcuts.

190
00:09:00,610 --> 00:09:04,220
I've personally used
the shortcut power two

191
00:09:04,220 --> 00:09:09,040
which is just upon the tab
key on my French keyboard.

192
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:11,590
I'm pretty happy with this
bouncing ball animation.

193
00:09:12,540 --> 00:09:15,280
And in summary we have
seen that curve editing

194
00:09:15,280 --> 00:09:18,100
can dramatically change our animation.

195
00:09:18,100 --> 00:09:21,150
Good blocking makes your
animation a little better

196
00:09:21,150 --> 00:09:22,870
when you switch to spline.

197
00:09:22,870 --> 00:09:26,330
It's important not to be
afraid to break the curve

198
00:09:26,330 --> 00:09:28,480
using vector handles.

199
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:31,230
Offsetting the key by one frame

200
00:09:31,230 --> 00:09:34,340
can really change your animation
and make it look better

201
00:09:34,340 --> 00:09:35,173
on its troy.

202
00:09:35,173 --> 00:09:37,753
Don't forget that the
devil is in the details.
