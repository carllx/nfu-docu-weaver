- [Instructor] A very common issue

2
00:00:01,440 --> 00:00:04,250
when animating with a 3D character rig

3
00:00:04,250 --> 00:00:07,150
is what we call knee pop and elbow pop.

4
00:00:07,150 --> 00:00:10,910
I won't try to explain why this happened

5
00:00:10,910 --> 00:00:14,050
but whenever you are
extending the arm or the leg

6
00:00:14,050 --> 00:00:17,250
using inverse kinematic, it can happen

7
00:00:17,250 --> 00:00:21,460
that the knee accelerate
to one full extension.

8
00:00:21,460 --> 00:00:25,830
It creates a visual glitch
that we will need to fix.

9
00:00:25,830 --> 00:00:28,950
The first thing to do is
to select the knee tweaker

10
00:00:28,950 --> 00:00:31,170
and calculate its motion path.

11
00:00:31,170 --> 00:00:34,680
As usual, I'm using my quick
favorite, pressing the Q key.

12
00:00:34,680 --> 00:00:37,470
Once that we see the trajectory
of the knee over time,

13
00:00:37,470 --> 00:00:42,050
it's pretty obvious where this
pop or this break happens.

14
00:00:42,050 --> 00:00:46,350
My technique to fix this is
simply to reposition the knee

15
00:00:46,350 --> 00:00:49,780
using the knee tweaker
along the few frames

16
00:00:49,780 --> 00:00:51,630
where it's currently popping.

17
00:00:51,630 --> 00:00:55,620
What I advise you is not
trying to fix this issue

18
00:00:55,620 --> 00:00:57,120
on one frame only,

19
00:00:57,120 --> 00:01:01,340
but instead try to smooth
the motion path of the knee

20
00:01:01,340 --> 00:01:03,040
over several frames.

21
00:01:03,040 --> 00:01:06,530
Because if you try to fix
it over one frame only,

22
00:01:06,530 --> 00:01:09,520
you may push the controller
into a weird pose

23
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:11,530
and you will generate a new problem

24
00:01:11,530 --> 00:01:13,970
while trying to fix an existing one.

25
00:01:13,970 --> 00:01:16,620
As you may have understood already,

26
00:01:16,620 --> 00:01:20,930
the method is simply to rebuild
the position of the knee

27
00:01:20,930 --> 00:01:23,700
using the knee tweaker controller.

28
00:01:23,700 --> 00:01:25,660
I first do it from the camera view,

29
00:01:25,660 --> 00:01:29,000
but then don't forget to
turn around your character

30
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:32,990
and check that the motion path
look clean from every angle.

31
00:01:32,990 --> 00:01:37,710
We do favourise camera
view, but for this exercise,

32
00:01:37,710 --> 00:01:41,523
I'd like our animation to
be clean from any angle.
