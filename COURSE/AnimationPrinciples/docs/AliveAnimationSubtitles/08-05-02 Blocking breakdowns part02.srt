1
00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:02,960
- [Instructor] As I'm
starting a new pose, as usual,

2
00:00:02,960 --> 00:00:05,700
I will insert a key frame
on all the controllers

3
00:00:05,700 --> 00:00:07,990
for both the bag and the character.

4
00:00:07,990 --> 00:00:09,550
The pose I'm going to create,

5
00:00:09,550 --> 00:00:12,850
is the overshoot after the right cross.

6
00:00:12,850 --> 00:00:16,570
Since it is performed just
after the right cross,

7
00:00:16,570 --> 00:00:18,860
we can start by posing the bag.

8
00:00:18,860 --> 00:00:22,050
I've just swing the bag,
using the main controller.

9
00:00:22,050 --> 00:00:24,800
I'm resetting the pose of
all the other controller.

10
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:28,240
Then I will select the wall
forward kinematic chain,

11
00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:31,710
the blue controller, and
slightly bend the bag.

12
00:00:31,710 --> 00:00:34,770
The idea is to swing the bag
in reaction to the punch,

13
00:00:34,770 --> 00:00:38,580
so try to align its orientation
with the previous pose

14
00:00:38,580 --> 00:00:41,380
of the punch. The process
to create the overshoot

15
00:00:41,380 --> 00:00:42,720
is pretty straightforward.

16
00:00:42,720 --> 00:00:46,870
You just have to push further
any pose you've picked.

17
00:00:46,870 --> 00:00:50,060
The chest was twisting, I twisted more.

18
00:00:50,060 --> 00:00:53,080
I've pushed the center of gravity forward

19
00:00:53,080 --> 00:00:56,870
and move it a bit to the
left onto the supporting leg.

20
00:00:56,870 --> 00:01:00,380
I'm spreading the left arm
that was swinging back.

21
00:01:00,380 --> 00:01:03,970
So basically I'm pushing
the whole line of action.

22
00:01:03,970 --> 00:01:07,730
Guarding the right arm, I'm
slightly bending it inward.

23
00:01:07,730 --> 00:01:10,280
The fun fact about this pose is that

24
00:01:10,280 --> 00:01:13,770
I haven't kept it in the end,
but because it looks like

25
00:01:13,770 --> 00:01:15,930
the character is losing balance,

26
00:01:15,930 --> 00:01:18,660
and I was having a hard time to transition

27
00:01:18,660 --> 00:01:21,800
into the next pose. So
it doesn't mean that

28
00:01:21,800 --> 00:01:24,320
this pose doesn't work,
but it doesn't sell

29
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:26,290
what I want to do with the character.

30
00:01:26,290 --> 00:01:28,490
And as explained many time before,

31
00:01:28,490 --> 00:01:30,890
as being a creative process,

32
00:01:30,890 --> 00:01:33,530
animation is not a linear workflow,

33
00:01:33,530 --> 00:01:36,050
so you may change your mind along the way.

34
00:01:36,050 --> 00:01:37,283
That's perfectly fine.

35
00:01:38,630 --> 00:01:41,700
Now comes the time where we
are going to build the pose

36
00:01:41,700 --> 00:01:43,090
just after the hook.

37
00:01:43,090 --> 00:01:44,930
It is the moment where
I need the character

38
00:01:44,930 --> 00:01:49,690
to rotate around his left
foot and put his right foot

39
00:01:49,690 --> 00:01:53,340
behind, as being his real
leg, before performing

40
00:01:53,340 --> 00:01:56,520
the switch kick. Before I
start working on the character,

41
00:01:56,520 --> 00:02:00,510
I'm posing the bag exactly as
I did for the previous pose.

42
00:02:00,510 --> 00:02:04,300
And then comes the painful
moment where we don't have any

43
00:02:04,300 --> 00:02:09,300
reference for the next poses
into the rest pose of God pose.

44
00:02:09,990 --> 00:02:12,810
And this is the time where
you have to leave your chair,

45
00:02:12,810 --> 00:02:16,130
in the best case, shoot
your own reference and,

46
00:02:16,130 --> 00:02:19,440
or at least try to the
mimic the move in front of

47
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:24,440
a big mirror or in front
of nothing, and try to feel

48
00:02:24,790 --> 00:02:28,230
how your body's moving. Super
important, as an animator,

49
00:02:28,230 --> 00:02:31,200
to try to act what you are animating.

50
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:34,850
When doing crazy combat move,
we do know that we can't

51
00:02:34,850 --> 00:02:39,760
do exactly the same, but just
do it at a very slow pace.

52
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:43,250
Just take the pose and
transition into the other pose

53
00:02:43,250 --> 00:02:45,190
and your body will do the rest.

54
00:02:45,190 --> 00:02:48,920
I'm certainly not as impressive
as the guy on the reference,

55
00:02:48,920 --> 00:02:53,370
but I do get enough information,
at least some information,

56
00:02:53,370 --> 00:02:57,470
in order to perform the next
move and to pose my character.

57
00:02:57,470 --> 00:03:01,340
I'm swinging back with my
left arm after the hook.

58
00:03:01,340 --> 00:03:04,970
My feet are rotating, but they
are not changing location.

59
00:03:04,970 --> 00:03:09,390
There is then a weight
transfer upon my left leg

60
00:03:09,390 --> 00:03:11,810
while I'm rotating the right shoulder,

61
00:03:11,810 --> 00:03:15,880
so my whole chest toward
the next contact pose.

62
00:03:15,880 --> 00:03:18,890
The right foot will
contact first, and then the

63
00:03:18,890 --> 00:03:22,950
center of gravity will catch
up. While rotating, my weight

64
00:03:22,950 --> 00:03:26,010
is mostly on the left leg,
and then, I can go into

65
00:03:26,010 --> 00:03:29,990
the switch kick. So from there,
I can go back into Blender

66
00:03:29,990 --> 00:03:32,040
and start working on my pose.

67
00:03:32,040 --> 00:03:36,260
We need to mostly shift the
weight upon the left leg.

68
00:03:36,260 --> 00:03:40,170
As I did many time before I
will console any transform

69
00:03:40,170 --> 00:03:42,450
on both the hips and the chest.

70
00:03:42,450 --> 00:03:44,180
As explained before learning wise,

71
00:03:44,180 --> 00:03:46,850
it's better to start your
new pose from scratch,

72
00:03:46,850 --> 00:03:50,850
and it's also a good way to
avoid to inherit mistakes

73
00:03:50,850 --> 00:03:53,040
from the previous pose.
Adding a quick look

74
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:56,530
to the reference pose I've
attached, we can clearly see

75
00:03:56,530 --> 00:03:59,540
the line of action has a S shape.

76
00:03:59,540 --> 00:04:02,690
The supporting leg is pushing the hips up,

77
00:04:02,690 --> 00:04:05,040
and the hips are leading the rotation.

78
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:08,980
So the hips are twisted
more than the shoulders

79
00:04:08,980 --> 00:04:13,470
or the chest. Now, I like to
focus on some artistic choice.

80
00:04:13,470 --> 00:04:16,320
On the reference, we can
see that I'm lifting my

81
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:20,300
right foot pretty high.
While on the reference pose,

82
00:04:20,300 --> 00:04:24,660
I've decided to make tip of
the toes sliding on the ground,

83
00:04:24,660 --> 00:04:27,630
as if my character was ice skating.

84
00:04:27,630 --> 00:04:31,520
So I've straightened a bit
the leg, and I make the toes

85
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:34,990
drag on the ground. This
is creating a nice flow

86
00:04:34,990 --> 00:04:38,810
to the silhouette of the
character, but also to the move.

87
00:04:38,810 --> 00:04:42,390
I will be able to create
a nice arc using the foot.

88
00:04:42,390 --> 00:04:45,970
Instead of pulling the arm
back in guard, I've decided

89
00:04:45,970 --> 00:04:50,230
to make them drag more. This
will create a larger arc

90
00:04:50,230 --> 00:04:53,710
whenever I will be pulling
the arm, and they will form

91
00:04:53,710 --> 00:04:57,070
an elliptic shape, so the
whole pose is supporting

92
00:04:57,070 --> 00:04:59,680
or drawing the rotation of the character.

93
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:04,200
And this is all I generally
build my pose to get

94
00:05:04,200 --> 00:05:08,540
very smooth motion. I try
to respect the physicality

95
00:05:08,540 --> 00:05:12,030
of the motion, placing
the center of gravity upon

96
00:05:12,030 --> 00:05:16,280
the supporting foot. I respect
the chest and hips shape,

97
00:05:16,280 --> 00:05:19,470
but as soon as I can, I
try to create some kind of

98
00:05:19,470 --> 00:05:22,300
choreographing motion, meaning that

99
00:05:22,300 --> 00:05:25,570
I will pose the arms and the
legs as if the character was

100
00:05:25,570 --> 00:05:29,510
totally mastering what he's
doing and trying to input

101
00:05:29,510 --> 00:05:31,823
a bit of beauty in his movement.

102
00:05:32,890 --> 00:05:37,030
From the previous pose, we
can settle into the next pose.

103
00:05:37,030 --> 00:05:40,810
The right foot has reach
its final position and is

104
00:05:40,810 --> 00:05:44,240
flatten on the ground. Now
the center of gravity is

105
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:47,910
on the right foot. It's no
longer on the left foot.

106
00:05:47,910 --> 00:05:51,490
The chest is twisted backward,
so the right shoulder

107
00:05:51,490 --> 00:05:55,430
is in the back while it was
dragging in the previous pose.

108
00:05:55,430 --> 00:05:58,870
The left fist is forward
while the right fist

109
00:05:58,870 --> 00:06:02,380
is a little backward. If we
compare the previous pose

110
00:06:02,380 --> 00:06:05,920
and the current pose from the
top view, we can clearly see

111
00:06:05,920 --> 00:06:08,880
the twisting or rotation
of the upper body,

112
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:13,300
leading into a big contrast
regarding the arm poses.

113
00:06:13,300 --> 00:06:16,220
The current pose is pretty
close to the ideal pose

114
00:06:16,220 --> 00:06:19,480
of the character, but the
center of gravity is slightly

115
00:06:19,480 --> 00:06:24,480
lower, so the character looks
a little heavier on his feet.

116
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:29,020
Both feet are flattened on
the ground, and the character

117
00:06:29,020 --> 00:06:33,110
makes a nice C shape from
a profile. This is a good

118
00:06:33,110 --> 00:06:36,840
anticipation pose for the
next move. To jump into the

119
00:06:36,840 --> 00:06:39,760
switch kick, the character
is gathering energy.

120
00:06:39,760 --> 00:06:42,880
This is why we have lowered
its center of gravity.

121
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:46,950
And it does a bit of a
squat stance with his legs.

122
00:06:46,950 --> 00:06:51,020
Think of the spine as a spring.
If you bend it in a way,

123
00:06:51,020 --> 00:06:53,430
when you will release
the force, it will bend

124
00:06:53,430 --> 00:06:55,700
the other way. From there, I just need to

125
00:06:55,700 --> 00:06:59,190
tweak the position of the
arms to match the reference

126
00:06:59,190 --> 00:07:02,230
I've attached. Don't
worry if you weren't able

127
00:07:02,230 --> 00:07:05,890
to follow along with this
video. The idea is to highlight

128
00:07:05,890 --> 00:07:10,300
the important point you have
to look after, and then I will

129
00:07:10,300 --> 00:07:14,070
provide you a slow-paced
time lapse, so that you can

130
00:07:14,070 --> 00:07:15,653
see the whole process.
