1
00:00:01,120 --> 00:00:04,170
- Once the bag rotation master controller

2
00:00:04,170 --> 00:00:05,890
and the root were done,

3
00:00:05,890 --> 00:00:07,920
I've locked their transformed channels

4
00:00:07,920 --> 00:00:11,740
so that I was sure I would
not edit them by mistake.

5
00:00:11,740 --> 00:00:14,420
From there, I will select
all the other controller

6
00:00:14,420 --> 00:00:17,950
and get rid of all the keys
but the very first one.

7
00:00:17,950 --> 00:00:21,110
Since the bag deformations are very fast,

8
00:00:21,110 --> 00:00:24,960
it's easier for me to
rework them from scratch

9
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:26,550
then trying to work from

10
00:00:26,550 --> 00:00:27,940
what we have blocked before.

11
00:00:27,940 --> 00:00:30,450
Whenever I want to create a
pose, I will make sure that

12
00:00:30,450 --> 00:00:33,580
the previous key frame is currently keyed.

13
00:00:33,580 --> 00:00:38,010
This way, I'm sure to avoid
any undesired interpolations,

14
00:00:38,010 --> 00:00:41,510
On frame 12, I will kind of sculpt the bag

15
00:00:41,510 --> 00:00:44,400
as it receive the first jab

16
00:00:44,400 --> 00:00:46,490
by pushing the tweaker controller.

17
00:00:46,490 --> 00:00:48,730
And then a couple of frames later,

18
00:00:48,730 --> 00:00:50,930
I will just console all the transforms

19
00:00:50,930 --> 00:00:53,920
so that the bag recovers its shape.

20
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:55,620
Then a frame later, I will pull a bit

21
00:00:55,620 --> 00:00:58,310
the controller that was hit by the punch

22
00:00:58,310 --> 00:01:01,750
so that we get a very
subtle shake feeling.

23
00:01:01,750 --> 00:01:04,100
Then I will repeat the
process for the next punch.

24
00:01:04,100 --> 00:01:06,557
I will key the controller on frame 16,

25
00:01:06,557 --> 00:01:10,310
the frame prior to the hit or impact.

26
00:01:10,310 --> 00:01:13,990
Then on frame 17, I will sculpt the bag

27
00:01:13,990 --> 00:01:15,710
by pushing the tweaker bone,

28
00:01:15,710 --> 00:01:18,570
but also scaling them on one axis

29
00:01:18,570 --> 00:01:22,010
and then scaling them down
on the opposite taxis.

30
00:01:22,010 --> 00:01:25,440
I'm trying to preserve
the volume of the bag.

31
00:01:25,440 --> 00:01:27,230
From there, four frames later,

32
00:01:27,230 --> 00:01:29,850
I will console all the transform, and then

33
00:01:29,850 --> 00:01:33,510
I will refine the shape
of the bag frame-by-frame.

34
00:01:33,510 --> 00:01:36,310
Since the the hitting
frames are pretty short,

35
00:01:36,310 --> 00:01:38,730
it's a very fast process.

36
00:01:38,730 --> 00:01:41,600
Rebuilding the whole
animation for the whole bag

37
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:44,060
took me about half an hour.

38
00:01:44,060 --> 00:01:47,150
Then, I started over again with the hook,

39
00:01:47,150 --> 00:01:51,111
Sculpting the pose from scratch
using the tweaker bones.

40
00:01:51,111 --> 00:01:53,530
As soon as I was done with the hook,

41
00:01:53,530 --> 00:01:54,630
guess what I did.

42
00:01:54,630 --> 00:01:57,380
Exactly the same thing with the kick.

43
00:01:57,380 --> 00:01:59,920
I've exclusively started working

44
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:03,500
on those deformation frames
using the tweaker bones.

45
00:02:03,500 --> 00:02:04,910
That's pretty important because

46
00:02:04,910 --> 00:02:06,800
they are very easy to use,

47
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:11,040
and to sculpt those specific impacts.

48
00:02:11,040 --> 00:02:14,580
Then I start working using
the blue controllers.

49
00:02:14,580 --> 00:02:17,070
Those are the forward kinematic controls

50
00:02:17,070 --> 00:02:20,490
that will also us to
slightly bend the bag.

51
00:02:20,490 --> 00:02:22,960
We could spend hours in the graffiti tool

52
00:02:22,960 --> 00:02:24,640
polishing those controllers,

53
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:27,020
but instead I've kept the process

54
00:02:27,020 --> 00:02:28,730
as simple as possible,

55
00:02:28,730 --> 00:02:31,010
keying as less frames as possible

56
00:02:31,010 --> 00:02:34,510
and letting blender interpolate
between those frames.

57
00:02:34,510 --> 00:02:37,160
So I'm selecting all the
controllers from the one,

58
00:02:37,160 --> 00:02:40,860
just upon the impact frame,
toward the tip of the bag.

59
00:02:40,860 --> 00:02:44,100
Then make sure that you are
using individual origin,

60
00:02:44,100 --> 00:02:45,820
so is that we will be able to bend

61
00:02:45,820 --> 00:02:48,050
all the controller at once.

62
00:02:48,050 --> 00:02:53,000
And just bend the bag toward
its previous position,

63
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:56,280
as if it was dragging as less as possible.

64
00:02:56,280 --> 00:02:59,510
If you bend it too much,
it won't look realistic

65
00:02:59,510 --> 00:03:01,930
because it will look too smooth.

66
00:03:01,930 --> 00:03:04,860
From there, if you don't
jump into the graffiti tool,

67
00:03:04,860 --> 00:03:07,840
that's gonna be hard to make it look good.

68
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:10,550
As soon as I reached
the next impact frame,

69
00:03:10,550 --> 00:03:14,100
I'm keying the frame before the impact,

70
00:03:14,100 --> 00:03:16,400
and then I'm slightly increasing

71
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:19,640
the curvature of the bag on the impact.

72
00:03:19,640 --> 00:03:22,730
Then, when the hook is about to happen,

73
00:03:22,730 --> 00:03:26,070
this is the time where the
bag is traveling the fastest,

74
00:03:26,070 --> 00:03:29,950
so I will slightly bend it toward, again,

75
00:03:29,950 --> 00:03:31,780
it's previous position.

76
00:03:31,780 --> 00:03:33,800
And this is all you create

77
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:36,870
this subtle dragging, almost for free.

78
00:03:36,870 --> 00:03:38,100
The trick is to make sure

79
00:03:38,100 --> 00:03:40,460
that you manipulate all the bone

80
00:03:40,460 --> 00:03:42,500
in the chain at the same time.

81
00:03:42,500 --> 00:03:46,320
Since they have a parent
and child relationship,

82
00:03:46,320 --> 00:03:47,800
you rotate the parent,

83
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:50,510
that makes the child rotating too,

84
00:03:50,510 --> 00:03:52,330
and then you apply on top of this

85
00:03:52,330 --> 00:03:56,170
a bit of rotation on the
child, et cetera, et cetera.

86
00:03:56,170 --> 00:03:59,670
It generates a slight bend in the bags

87
00:03:59,670 --> 00:04:01,250
that looks very natural.

88
00:04:01,250 --> 00:04:03,260
The only moment where I had to be

89
00:04:03,260 --> 00:04:05,860
a little more creative was on the kick,

90
00:04:05,860 --> 00:04:09,040
where I posed the bones frame by frame.

91
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:10,740
On the frame prior to the kick,

92
00:04:10,740 --> 00:04:13,430
I've just made the whole bag dragging.

93
00:04:13,430 --> 00:04:15,080
And then, on the impact,

94
00:04:15,080 --> 00:04:18,340
I first made the top part of the bag

95
00:04:18,340 --> 00:04:21,790
to rotate the right, behind
the leg of the character

96
00:04:21,790 --> 00:04:25,060
while the lower part of
the bag will be dragging.

97
00:04:25,060 --> 00:04:27,530
So I will invert it's rotation

98
00:04:27,530 --> 00:04:29,610
and rotate it a bit backwards.

99
00:04:29,610 --> 00:04:32,250
Since the bag is arriving very fast

100
00:04:32,250 --> 00:04:35,310
and we kicking it the opposite direction,

101
00:04:35,310 --> 00:04:37,970
there is a lot of deformation in the bag.

102
00:04:37,970 --> 00:04:40,680
Then, as it is projected by the kick,

103
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:43,430
I will slightly bend it backward

104
00:04:43,430 --> 00:04:45,540
toward its previous position

105
00:04:45,540 --> 00:04:47,600
to make it drag a bit.

106
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:50,070
Finally, as as it hits the ground,

107
00:04:50,070 --> 00:04:52,860
I bend it toward its previous direction

108
00:04:52,860 --> 00:04:54,830
so is that it is dragging again.

109
00:04:54,830 --> 00:04:56,900
And then I will console the rotation

110
00:04:56,900 --> 00:04:58,560
a couple of frame after

111
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:00,750
and convert all the landing keys

112
00:05:00,750 --> 00:05:02,490
and the keys after to vectors

113
00:05:02,490 --> 00:05:05,710
so that I have a hard slap on the ground.

114
00:05:05,710 --> 00:05:07,860
One final touch I've added is that

115
00:05:07,860 --> 00:05:09,540
I've used the tweaker control root

116
00:05:09,540 --> 00:05:11,360
to squash the bag on the ground.

117
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:13,680
In the end, it's barely noticeable,

118
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:16,140
because I've kept it very subtle.

119
00:05:16,140 --> 00:05:18,270
I selected all the tweaker bone,

120
00:05:18,270 --> 00:05:21,070
inserted a key frame on the key prior

121
00:05:21,070 --> 00:05:23,460
to squash the bag so that I don't get any

122
00:05:23,460 --> 00:05:25,670
weird interpolation,

123
00:05:25,670 --> 00:05:27,920
then I've scaled them up a bit

124
00:05:27,920 --> 00:05:31,360
on the X and Y axis, and flatten it,

125
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:34,560
scaling it down on the Z axis.

126
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:36,450
Then two or three frame later,

127
00:05:36,450 --> 00:05:39,800
I've consoled any scale by pressing alt+S.

128
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:42,430
One final detail I have revised,

129
00:05:42,430 --> 00:05:44,910
but I'm not sure I've captured it,

130
00:05:44,910 --> 00:05:46,530
is the rotation of the bag

131
00:05:46,530 --> 00:05:48,690
just after the right cross.

132
00:05:48,690 --> 00:05:51,460
I've slightly lowered
the level of rotation

133
00:05:51,460 --> 00:05:54,730
of the bag so that it stays on screen

134
00:05:54,730 --> 00:05:57,380
while we are rotating
around the character.

135
00:05:57,380 --> 00:05:59,560
This is typically the kind of detail

136
00:05:59,560 --> 00:06:02,700
I wouldn't have taken care of a year ago,

137
00:06:02,700 --> 00:06:05,440
for example, but it's
very important because

138
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:09,890
it does improve the
readability of your animation.

139
00:06:09,890 --> 00:06:11,830
This is typically the kind of detail

140
00:06:11,830 --> 00:06:16,060
that will bring you to a
professional level of animation,

141
00:06:16,060 --> 00:06:19,970
because it shows that you
care for your audience,

142
00:06:19,970 --> 00:06:21,870
and make sure that they will get

143
00:06:21,870 --> 00:06:23,913
everything about your animation.
