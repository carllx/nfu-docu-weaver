1
00:00:00,230 --> 00:00:02,240
- [Instructor] We are
hitting the final part

2
00:00:02,240 --> 00:00:03,770
of our polishing stage,

3
00:00:03,770 --> 00:00:06,060
where we are going to polish the kick.

4
00:00:06,060 --> 00:00:09,310
At this stage, you should
already have guessed that

5
00:00:09,310 --> 00:00:10,840
we are going to start with

6
00:00:10,840 --> 00:00:13,710
the torso route controller
of our character.

7
00:00:13,710 --> 00:00:16,450
The first thing that might
be a bit disturbing is that

8
00:00:16,450 --> 00:00:21,450
since our character has rotated
in space during the hook,

9
00:00:22,010 --> 00:00:25,510
the side to side motion
of his center of gravity

10
00:00:25,510 --> 00:00:28,840
is no longer driven by the X location,

11
00:00:28,840 --> 00:00:30,780
but the Y location curve.

12
00:00:30,780 --> 00:00:33,350
This is because our torso controller

13
00:00:33,350 --> 00:00:35,400
is aligned with world space.

14
00:00:35,400 --> 00:00:39,940
So as our character is rotated
by more or less 90 degrees,

15
00:00:39,940 --> 00:00:42,995
its local left to right
motion is now aligned with

16
00:00:42,995 --> 00:00:46,500
the world space forward
and backward motion.

17
00:00:46,500 --> 00:00:49,320
As usual, you don't need
to think about all of this.

18
00:00:49,320 --> 00:00:51,810
The important thing is
just to test the curve,

19
00:00:51,810 --> 00:00:55,540
see how your character
behave and start from there.

20
00:00:55,540 --> 00:00:56,730
As we did before,

21
00:00:56,730 --> 00:00:59,640
I'm moving the center of
gravity of the character

22
00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:01,890
based on the steps it's taking.

23
00:01:01,890 --> 00:01:04,920
I'm pushing the center of
gravity on the left leg,

24
00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:08,570
whenever the character
is freeing his right foot

25
00:01:08,570 --> 00:01:10,340
to be able to pull it back.

26
00:01:10,340 --> 00:01:13,380
And then we have this
micro anticipation before

27
00:01:13,380 --> 00:01:15,200
the jump into the switch.

28
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:18,900
The weight of the character is
shifting upon the right leg.

29
00:01:18,900 --> 00:01:22,610
And we are holding don't
pose for a couple of frames.

30
00:01:22,610 --> 00:01:24,428
Then as our character is jumping,

31
00:01:24,428 --> 00:01:28,500
the value of the Z curve
is raising pretty fast.

32
00:01:28,500 --> 00:01:32,149
And since our character has no
more contact with the ground,

33
00:01:32,149 --> 00:01:36,050
I'm making the Y curve almost linear

34
00:01:36,050 --> 00:01:38,063
because our character is not able

35
00:01:38,063 --> 00:01:41,930
to apply any forces to accelerate

36
00:01:41,930 --> 00:01:45,650
on its X or Y axis while in the air.

37
00:01:45,650 --> 00:01:47,840
When your character is airborn,

38
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:49,313
The only axis that gets a lot
of variation is the Z axis,

39
00:01:51,710 --> 00:01:53,040
the up and down.

40
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:55,660
As the lens, the reason
micro anticipation,

41
00:01:55,660 --> 00:01:58,333
so a little down pose over fret 74.

42
00:01:59,530 --> 00:02:01,366
From there, I will give a quick polish to

43
00:02:01,366 --> 00:02:04,440
the X location curve of our character.

44
00:02:04,440 --> 00:02:07,200
Remember that the feet travels faster

45
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:08,900
than the center of gravity.

46
00:02:08,900 --> 00:02:10,867
So when the character is stepping back,

47
00:02:10,867 --> 00:02:15,867
I will hold his center of
gravity upon the left foot until

48
00:02:15,980 --> 00:02:19,130
the right foot reaches its contact pose.

49
00:02:19,130 --> 00:02:21,220
And then the center of gravity travels

50
00:02:21,220 --> 00:02:22,940
toward the right foot

51
00:02:22,940 --> 00:02:26,090
and as I did before with
the Y location curve,

52
00:02:26,090 --> 00:02:29,820
during the jump, I will
make the curve more linear

53
00:02:29,820 --> 00:02:33,660
by simply removing the unnecessary keys.

54
00:02:33,660 --> 00:02:37,320
Once I got the satisfying arc
for the jump of the character,

55
00:02:37,320 --> 00:02:41,650
I will try to push him back
and down as far as possible

56
00:02:41,650 --> 00:02:45,300
to contrast with the position
whenever it's kicking.

57
00:02:45,300 --> 00:02:47,437
From there, I didn't have that much work

58
00:02:47,437 --> 00:02:50,060
regarding the kick itself

59
00:02:50,060 --> 00:02:53,210
because it was already polished a lot

60
00:02:53,210 --> 00:02:57,770
during the blocking stage, since
we have animate it on once.

61
00:02:57,770 --> 00:02:58,620
So from there,

62
00:02:58,620 --> 00:03:03,280
I will be mainly working on
the step back of the character.

63
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:04,570
And as usual,

64
00:03:04,570 --> 00:03:09,490
I will make sure that the center
of gravity of my character

65
00:03:09,490 --> 00:03:12,530
is aligned with the contacting foot

66
00:03:12,530 --> 00:03:15,120
and that the weight shifts

67
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:18,500
upon the new contacting foot

68
00:03:18,500 --> 00:03:22,820
as soon as the current
foot contact the ground.

69
00:03:22,820 --> 00:03:26,090
So first the foot contact the ground

70
00:03:26,090 --> 00:03:30,330
then the center of gravity
shift toward the foot

71
00:03:30,330 --> 00:03:34,240
and to be able to move the
food, the character need

72
00:03:34,240 --> 00:03:36,770
to raise his center of gravity.

73
00:03:36,770 --> 00:03:40,830
So the center of gravity
will both shift to what the

74
00:03:40,830 --> 00:03:44,866
supporting leg and raise
while the opposite foot

75
00:03:44,866 --> 00:03:48,910
is moving to its next contact pose.

76
00:03:48,910 --> 00:03:53,050
And as it reaches its next contact pose,

77
00:03:53,050 --> 00:03:56,360
the center of gravity start to get down

78
00:03:56,360 --> 00:03:59,440
and toward this new contact pose.

79
00:03:59,440 --> 00:04:01,570
Very common mistake is to move

80
00:04:01,570 --> 00:04:04,720
the center of gravity
in sync with the foot.

81
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:06,995
As explained before, the
center of gravity and

82
00:04:06,995 --> 00:04:10,140
the feet don't move at the same speed

83
00:04:10,140 --> 00:04:12,610
because at some point
the center of gravity

84
00:04:12,610 --> 00:04:15,410
needs to be supported by the foot

85
00:04:15,410 --> 00:04:17,730
and at some point the center of gravity

86
00:04:17,730 --> 00:04:21,190
needs to free the foot
so that it can move.

87
00:04:21,190 --> 00:04:23,200
So just try to keep this in mind,

88
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:26,153
this mechanism where the
center of gravity will shift

89
00:04:26,153 --> 00:04:28,181
towards the available foot,

90
00:04:28,181 --> 00:04:30,910
the ones that doesn't move anymore.

91
00:04:30,910 --> 00:04:32,840
When it comes to rotation,

92
00:04:32,840 --> 00:04:35,130
as soon as the character is pulling back,

93
00:04:35,130 --> 00:04:37,660
I am making the torso drag in a bit

94
00:04:37,660 --> 00:04:42,270
so that I will rotate it
toward its previous position.

95
00:04:42,270 --> 00:04:44,050
When the character is moving back,

96
00:04:44,050 --> 00:04:47,000
I will make him slightly leaning forward.

97
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,220
Compared to what has been outputted

98
00:04:49,220 --> 00:04:50,720
from the detailed blocking,

99
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:53,150
I'm not touching the curve that much.

100
00:04:53,150 --> 00:04:55,760
It's mostly about revising a bit,

101
00:04:55,760 --> 00:04:58,700
the timing of the
rotation of the character,

102
00:04:58,700 --> 00:05:01,090
then reworking his current poses.

103
00:05:01,090 --> 00:05:05,170
And you can notice that I
generally have a very smooth curve

104
00:05:05,170 --> 00:05:09,231
with some plateau whenever the
character is moving his foot.

105
00:05:09,231 --> 00:05:12,096
And then the little acceleration of twist

106
00:05:12,096 --> 00:05:16,665
as soon as the foot has reached
its contact pose as for the

107
00:05:16,665 --> 00:05:20,530
X and Y location, whenever
the character is jumping,

108
00:05:20,530 --> 00:05:24,948
he will have a hard time to
create any variation in its

109
00:05:24,948 --> 00:05:28,010
rotation speed while airborn.

110
00:05:28,010 --> 00:05:29,420
To be able to accelerate or

111
00:05:29,420 --> 00:05:32,288
decelerate, you need to apply forces.

112
00:05:32,288 --> 00:05:36,090
And if your body is not
in contact with a surface,

113
00:05:36,090 --> 00:05:38,180
you can't push to create this force.

114
00:05:38,180 --> 00:05:40,400
This is why my curves get small linear

115
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:41,940
on during the jump.

116
00:05:41,940 --> 00:05:43,950
From there, I will walk on the rotation

117
00:05:43,950 --> 00:05:45,920
as I did on the location.

118
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:49,866
I will try to push the
extreme of the anticipation

119
00:05:49,866 --> 00:05:54,318
as far as possible so that
I get a very strong contrast

120
00:05:54,318 --> 00:05:56,970
compared to the kick release.

121
00:05:56,970 --> 00:05:59,030
So I'm leaning the character back

122
00:05:59,030 --> 00:06:01,220
and twisting toward its left leg

123
00:06:01,220 --> 00:06:04,449
and then I will twist the
body toward the right leg

124
00:06:04,449 --> 00:06:07,760
and lean the character into the kick.

125
00:06:07,760 --> 00:06:11,180
Then when the character
is coming back into idle,

126
00:06:11,180 --> 00:06:14,710
I'm mainly tweaking and
smoothing the existing curve,

127
00:06:14,710 --> 00:06:16,278
making sure that the body is dragging

128
00:06:16,278 --> 00:06:19,210
as the foot reaches its contact pose,

129
00:06:19,210 --> 00:06:21,620
and then the body catch up.

130
00:06:21,620 --> 00:06:23,900
Exactly as we did for the location.

131
00:06:23,900 --> 00:06:27,547
As usual, I will provide
you a slow paced time-lapse

132
00:06:27,547 --> 00:06:30,760
so that you can watch it almost real time.

133
00:06:30,760 --> 00:06:34,220
Note that entire of the
animation, I've given me like

134
00:06:34,220 --> 00:06:38,470
five or six additional frame,
just to ease into the idle,

135
00:06:38,470 --> 00:06:40,710
instead of having art stop,

136
00:06:40,710 --> 00:06:43,650
I will deal with almost all
the controller this way,

137
00:06:43,650 --> 00:06:48,150
creating some kind of moving
old until the last frame.

138
00:06:48,150 --> 00:06:50,770
He will be easing into his final post

139
00:06:50,770 --> 00:06:52,473
and that should look right.
