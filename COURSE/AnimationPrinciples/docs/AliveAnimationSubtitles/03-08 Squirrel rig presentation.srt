00:00:00,800 --> 00:00:02,470
- [Instructor] Let's have a quick overview

2
00:00:02,470 --> 00:00:04,390
of the squirrel rig.

3
00:00:04,390 --> 00:00:06,300
When opening the Blender file,

4
00:00:06,300 --> 00:00:08,140
you will find two object,

5
00:00:08,140 --> 00:00:12,090
our squirrel Armature
and the squirrel object

6
00:00:12,090 --> 00:00:14,720
that is using an Armature modifier.

7
00:00:14,720 --> 00:00:16,590
The object is called a squirrel.

8
00:00:16,590 --> 00:00:19,170
And it has as all material.

9
00:00:19,170 --> 00:00:22,940
By default, you should
have the Text Editor opened

10
00:00:22,940 --> 00:00:26,570
with this squirrel rig
UI text file opened.

11
00:00:26,570 --> 00:00:29,150
When my rig is selected and in pause mode

12
00:00:29,150 --> 00:00:34,110
if I press the play button,
it will execute the script

13
00:00:34,110 --> 00:00:37,540
and generate a little
UI that will allow us

14
00:00:37,540 --> 00:00:41,230
to hide or display the
bones of our character.

15
00:00:41,230 --> 00:00:43,690
The script doesn't run automatically,

16
00:00:43,690 --> 00:00:45,210
you will have to run it

17
00:00:45,210 --> 00:00:47,780
each time you will open your blender file.

18
00:00:47,780 --> 00:00:49,590
What if your script is not open

19
00:00:49,590 --> 00:00:52,630
because you don't have
the Text Editor opened?

20
00:00:52,630 --> 00:00:55,060
you just go to the editors panels,

21
00:00:55,060 --> 00:00:58,220
select the Text Editor and in the Library

22
00:00:58,220 --> 00:01:00,750
you will select the squirrel rig UI

23
00:01:00,750 --> 00:01:03,300
and then just press the Play button.

24
00:01:03,300 --> 00:01:06,380
You can then close this editor area.

25
00:01:06,380 --> 00:01:08,320
The rig is pretty straightforward.

26
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:12,380
The root bone allow us to
move the entire character,

27
00:01:12,380 --> 00:01:15,580
the dorsal roots allow
us to move the whole body

28
00:01:15,580 --> 00:01:17,560
and give it its orientation.

29
00:01:17,560 --> 00:01:19,500
But the legs won't follow.

30
00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:22,760
You will find a chest and a hip controller

31
00:01:22,760 --> 00:01:26,350
that can be moved, rotated and scape.

32
00:01:26,350 --> 00:01:29,180
The neck and head can also be controlled

33
00:01:29,180 --> 00:01:32,040
by one single bone that
will behave the same

34
00:01:32,040 --> 00:01:34,110
as the chest and hips bone.

35
00:01:34,110 --> 00:01:37,760
You can then find some tweaker
bone that will allow us

36
00:01:37,760 --> 00:01:42,620
to only rotate the neck
or only rotate the head.

37
00:01:42,620 --> 00:01:46,310
Smaller controller
bones are also available

38
00:01:46,310 --> 00:01:48,770
to be able to squash and stretch the head.

39
00:01:48,770 --> 00:01:50,710
Move the ears at will,

40
00:01:50,710 --> 00:01:53,850
close the eyes or move
the tip of the nose.

41
00:01:53,850 --> 00:01:57,040
All the bone transform
channels are already locked

42
00:01:57,040 --> 00:01:59,360
when they are not to be used

43
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:02,767
making our keying set
step a little faster.

44
00:02:02,767 --> 00:02:03,600
(whoosh)

45
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:06,850
The legs are using inverse
kinematic controllers,

46
00:02:06,850 --> 00:02:11,040
meaning that we are controlling
the whole arm or leg

47
00:02:11,040 --> 00:02:15,150
by simply moving the end of
the foot of our character.

48
00:02:15,150 --> 00:02:18,020
While the motion should
come from the shoulder,

49
00:02:18,020 --> 00:02:20,610
then the arm, then the forearm to the end

50
00:02:20,610 --> 00:02:21,970
it's inversed.

51
00:02:21,970 --> 00:02:25,000
The arm controller is just here to be able

52
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,130
to give an orientation to the elbow.

53
00:02:27,130 --> 00:02:28,210
On the back leg,

54
00:02:28,210 --> 00:02:30,700
we will also find an inverse kinematic

55
00:02:30,700 --> 00:02:32,450
from the foot controller,

56
00:02:32,450 --> 00:02:34,810
but the heel and knee orientation

57
00:02:34,810 --> 00:02:37,180
will be using a pole target.

58
00:02:37,180 --> 00:02:40,030
It's a bone that can move freely in space

59
00:02:40,030 --> 00:02:42,783
and the knee or heel of our character

60
00:02:42,783 --> 00:02:45,060
will be pointing at it.

61
00:02:45,060 --> 00:02:49,530
The tail use a simple
forward kinematic bone chain.

62
00:02:49,530 --> 00:02:51,560
So it basically rotates

63
00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:56,120
or is being controlled
from its root to its tip.

64
00:02:56,120 --> 00:02:59,510
We will then find a lot
of secondary controllers

65
00:02:59,510 --> 00:03:03,440
that will allow us to move
each joint of the character.

66
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:07,230
They will mainly be used
to fix some deformation

67
00:03:07,230 --> 00:03:10,140
or to add subtle motion to the character.

68
00:03:10,140 --> 00:03:13,460
The rig also comes with
some custom property

69
00:03:13,460 --> 00:03:16,040
that we can access by using these bones.

70
00:03:16,040 --> 00:03:17,510
When the bone is selected

71
00:03:17,510 --> 00:03:21,130
we can find those custom
properties in the item panel.

72
00:03:21,130 --> 00:03:23,080
Those properties will allow us

73
00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:25,580
to hide the legs of the character

74
00:03:25,580 --> 00:03:27,300
or the tail of the character.

75
00:03:27,300 --> 00:03:30,990
This will be really
useful to isolate the body

76
00:03:30,990 --> 00:03:33,240
and clearly read it's motion.

77
00:03:33,240 --> 00:03:35,770
The tail follow option allow us

78
00:03:35,770 --> 00:03:39,990
to whether isolate on not
the rotation of the tail.

79
00:03:39,990 --> 00:03:42,810
By default, the tail of our character

80
00:03:42,810 --> 00:03:45,340
is following the rotation of the hips

81
00:03:45,340 --> 00:03:46,870
and is aligned with it.

82
00:03:46,870 --> 00:03:49,300
But if we select the property boon

83
00:03:49,300 --> 00:03:51,960
and set this tail follow to zero,

84
00:03:51,960 --> 00:03:55,140
the tail is not rotating
with the hips anymore.

85
00:03:55,140 --> 00:03:57,730
This will make our life way easier

86
00:03:57,730 --> 00:04:00,150
when it comes to animating the tail.

87
00:04:00,150 --> 00:04:02,610
So before we jump into animation,

88
00:04:02,610 --> 00:04:06,620
I will just create the
keying set for our character

89
00:04:06,620 --> 00:04:09,280
by inserting a key frame on the channels

90
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:10,770
that are going to be used

91
00:04:10,770 --> 00:04:13,290
and remove those that are locked.

92
00:04:13,290 --> 00:04:15,020
Nothing really interesting here.

93
00:04:15,020 --> 00:04:17,802
So I will switch to a time-lapse
till the end of this video.

94
00:04:17,802 --> 00:04:19,885
(whoosh)

95
00:04:21,083 --> 00:04:24,000
(slow piano music)
