00:00:00,420 --> 00:00:02,560
- [Instructor] In this video,
we will have a quick look

2
00:00:02,560 --> 00:00:04,370
to the Wiggle bone add-on.

3
00:00:04,370 --> 00:00:08,143
Activated, the add-on gives
you access to the wiggle option

4
00:00:08,143 --> 00:00:10,850
that has to be activated pair bones.

5
00:00:10,850 --> 00:00:14,023
To get the add-on, you
can simply check the link

6
00:00:14,023 --> 00:00:16,620
into the documentation of the course.

7
00:00:16,620 --> 00:00:20,310
A latest version of the
Wiggle bone add-on by Steve.

8
00:00:20,310 --> 00:00:22,870
Then in blender, simply install it

9
00:00:22,870 --> 00:00:25,900
by going into Edit preferences.

10
00:00:25,900 --> 00:00:28,047
Add-on, click the install button.

11
00:00:28,047 --> 00:00:32,740
Browse and find the .pi file
of the wiggle bone add-on.

12
00:00:32,740 --> 00:00:35,830
Click the install button
and then make sure

13
00:00:35,830 --> 00:00:38,930
that the Wiggle bone add-on is activated.

14
00:00:38,930 --> 00:00:42,890
There is another add-on
called the Spring Bone add-ons

15
00:00:42,890 --> 00:00:46,460
by Artel, creator of Auto Rick Pro.

16
00:00:46,460 --> 00:00:48,761
But the add-on is still experimental

17
00:00:48,761 --> 00:00:53,560
and it only works on
chains of parented bones.

18
00:00:53,560 --> 00:00:55,100
For this demonstration,

19
00:00:55,100 --> 00:00:59,480
I provided one file with
two different animation.

20
00:00:59,480 --> 00:01:04,440
The sliding and rotating
animation called whipping action

21
00:01:04,440 --> 00:01:08,390
and a second action with some jumpy bones.

22
00:01:08,390 --> 00:01:13,390
Only the lower bone in the
chain is currently animated.

23
00:01:13,533 --> 00:01:17,020
Let's select the free bones in the chain

24
00:01:17,020 --> 00:01:19,190
that are the children of this one

25
00:01:19,190 --> 00:01:22,230
and activate the Wiggle
bone add-on on this

26
00:01:22,230 --> 00:01:24,160
and press the play button.

27
00:01:24,160 --> 00:01:29,010
By default, the reset on
loop option is activated.

28
00:01:29,010 --> 00:01:31,150
To enable or disable this option,

29
00:01:31,150 --> 00:01:33,990
you do it for all the bones at once.

30
00:01:33,990 --> 00:01:35,910
When using the add-on on the cycle,

31
00:01:35,910 --> 00:01:37,913
it's better to disable the option

32
00:01:37,913 --> 00:01:41,500
so that the simulation continue at runtime

33
00:01:41,500 --> 00:01:43,970
and we don't get the popping frame

34
00:01:43,970 --> 00:01:46,220
at the beginning of the motion.

35
00:01:46,220 --> 00:01:51,220
Wiggle bone add-on simulate
physical behavior on your bone.

36
00:01:51,370 --> 00:01:53,664
We can access different properties

37
00:01:53,664 --> 00:01:56,260
of those physical behavior

38
00:01:56,260 --> 00:01:59,747
through the panel whose
properties are editable.

39
00:01:59,747 --> 00:02:04,022
Pair bone, let's see in detail
the different properties.

40
00:02:04,022 --> 00:02:07,538
The amplitude rotation
option will increase

41
00:02:07,538 --> 00:02:12,000
or decrease the rotation
angle of your bones.

42
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,470
With my three bone selected,

43
00:02:14,470 --> 00:02:18,997
I will enter the value one,
hold Alt and press enter.

44
00:02:18,997 --> 00:02:23,570
This way, all the selected
bones values are set to one.

45
00:02:23,570 --> 00:02:24,910
With the value of one,

46
00:02:24,910 --> 00:02:29,540
we can see that we almost
have no rotation on the bones

47
00:02:29,540 --> 00:02:33,700
while if I set it to 180 degrees,

48
00:02:33,700 --> 00:02:37,140
you can see that the
rotation gets pretty wild.

49
00:02:37,140 --> 00:02:39,220
The stiffness value will kind

50
00:02:39,220 --> 00:02:42,690
of change the reaction speed of the bone.

51
00:02:42,690 --> 00:02:46,120
The higher the stiffness, the
more rigidity you are breaking

52
00:02:46,120 --> 00:02:50,150
making the bones reacting
as if it was a metal spring

53
00:02:50,150 --> 00:02:52,271
while with a very low stiffness,

54
00:02:52,271 --> 00:02:56,340
it looks more organic like hairs or cloth.

55
00:02:56,340 --> 00:03:00,586
So damping value greatly changed
the behavior of the bones.

56
00:03:00,586 --> 00:03:03,060
The higher the damping value,

57
00:03:03,060 --> 00:03:05,400
the more absorption you will have

58
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:07,310
in the motion of the bones.

59
00:03:07,310 --> 00:03:11,160
If you drastically decrease
the value of the damping,

60
00:03:11,160 --> 00:03:14,010
you will have a very jittery bones

61
00:03:14,010 --> 00:03:18,300
that will react to any of
the motion in the chain.

62
00:03:18,300 --> 00:03:22,100
You should keep the damping
value between zero and one.

63
00:03:22,100 --> 00:03:24,771
If you enter a value beyond one,

64
00:03:24,771 --> 00:03:27,580
it will likely creates bugs.

65
00:03:27,580 --> 00:03:30,660
And one of the big
issues of this add-on is

66
00:03:30,660 --> 00:03:33,170
that once the simulation is bugging,

67
00:03:33,170 --> 00:03:38,100
you kind of have to revert
your file or reload it.

68
00:03:38,100 --> 00:03:40,410
So be cautious with this.

69
00:03:40,410 --> 00:03:42,770
It's the same for the Stiffness.

70
00:03:42,770 --> 00:03:44,530
Don't go over one.

71
00:03:44,530 --> 00:03:47,340
You won't have any change of behavior.

72
00:03:47,340 --> 00:03:49,850
And at some point, it might bug.

73
00:03:49,850 --> 00:03:51,930
In this specific case,

74
00:03:51,930 --> 00:03:56,040
changing the translation
value won't do anything.

75
00:03:56,040 --> 00:03:59,530
And we will see why later in this video.

76
00:03:59,530 --> 00:04:03,670
For the time being, let's
increase the stretching value.

77
00:04:03,670 --> 00:04:07,350
As expected, the bones are now stretching.

78
00:04:07,350 --> 00:04:09,756
While it won't generate bugs,

79
00:04:09,756 --> 00:04:12,945
I advise you to keep the value pretty low

80
00:04:12,945 --> 00:04:16,860
and play in the range of zero to one.

81
00:04:16,860 --> 00:04:19,430
The gravity value, as expected,

82
00:04:19,430 --> 00:04:23,240
will kind of change the
weight of your bones.

83
00:04:23,240 --> 00:04:26,728
If you get to a pretty high
value, like five or 10,

84
00:04:26,728 --> 00:04:29,900
you will see your bones like falling.

85
00:04:29,900 --> 00:04:33,510
While using the gravity value
in a pretty broad range,

86
00:04:33,510 --> 00:04:35,940
I didn't meet any bugs.

87
00:04:35,940 --> 00:04:39,610
So as you have understand, you
have to be kind of creative

88
00:04:39,610 --> 00:04:42,800
and experiment a lot
with the different values

89
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:44,240
for the different bones

90
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:47,630
until you get the simulation you want.

91
00:04:47,630 --> 00:04:52,530
Convert those simulation into
an action or an animation,

92
00:04:52,530 --> 00:04:54,090
we need to bake.

93
00:04:54,090 --> 00:04:56,890
To be able to bake the
action of the bones,

94
00:04:56,890 --> 00:04:59,680
you have to make sure
that they are selected.

95
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:03,410
By clicking the select
wiggle bones button,

96
00:05:03,410 --> 00:05:05,290
you will select all the bones

97
00:05:05,290 --> 00:05:09,270
that have the wiggle bone option enabled.

98
00:05:09,270 --> 00:05:11,360
You've seen in the previous video,

99
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:16,360
baking an animation is done
through the NLA editor.

100
00:05:16,420 --> 00:05:18,570
When opening the NLA editor,

101
00:05:18,570 --> 00:05:22,460
I can see my current
weeping action being used.

102
00:05:22,460 --> 00:05:25,890
By now, click the bake wiggle button

103
00:05:25,890 --> 00:05:28,280
in the wiggle bone panel.

104
00:05:28,280 --> 00:05:31,030
It will bake the wiggle simulation

105
00:05:31,030 --> 00:05:33,420
on all the selected bones.

106
00:05:33,420 --> 00:05:36,820
And we can see that it
does create a new NLA track

107
00:05:36,820 --> 00:05:39,180
including the weeping action.

108
00:05:39,180 --> 00:05:43,070
And on top of this, we can
see our new baked action.

109
00:05:43,070 --> 00:05:46,700
Let's push it down into the NLA editor.

110
00:05:46,700 --> 00:05:48,580
And if we deactivate it,

111
00:05:48,580 --> 00:05:52,470
we can see that our bones
are no longer rotating.

112
00:05:52,470 --> 00:05:54,870
Thus, when we click the bake wiggle,

113
00:05:54,870 --> 00:05:58,830
it will remove the wiggle
option onto those bone.

114
00:05:58,830 --> 00:06:03,800
So what we see are currently
the animation of those bones.

115
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:08,240
Additive bake option
simply create an NLA track

116
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:11,270
including the original action

117
00:06:11,270 --> 00:06:15,850
so that the bake action can
be layered on top of it.

118
00:06:15,850 --> 00:06:18,960
If we deactivate the additive bake

119
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:21,395
and then bake the wiggle action,

120
00:06:21,395 --> 00:06:25,060
we will only see the result of the wiggle.

121
00:06:25,060 --> 00:06:29,730
Since the root bone wasn't
choosing the wiggle add-on,

122
00:06:29,730 --> 00:06:31,500
it's not moving anymore.

123
00:06:31,500 --> 00:06:35,011
This, we then need to
manually add those action

124
00:06:35,011 --> 00:06:37,650
into the NLA editor.

125
00:06:37,650 --> 00:06:39,440
When both the weeping action

126
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:41,990
and the baked action are enabled,

127
00:06:41,990 --> 00:06:45,250
we can see the whole
animation we have generated.

128
00:06:45,250 --> 00:06:47,440
So particularly, I advise you

129
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:50,500
to keep the additive bake enabled.

130
00:06:50,500 --> 00:06:52,400
I will reset everything

131
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:55,230
and I will select the second animation.

132
00:06:55,230 --> 00:06:56,529
The jumping one.

133
00:06:56,529 --> 00:07:01,020
As you can see, we have some
amplitude on the translation

134
00:07:01,020 --> 00:07:03,508
but the bones are not offsetting

135
00:07:03,508 --> 00:07:07,710
and this is because they
are connected in the rig.

136
00:07:07,710 --> 00:07:10,280
So I need to go into edit mode,

137
00:07:10,280 --> 00:07:14,802
select those bone and press
Alt + P to unparent them

138
00:07:14,802 --> 00:07:19,180
or keep them parented but disconnect them.

139
00:07:19,180 --> 00:07:23,760
And now we can see that they
are getting offsetted based

140
00:07:23,760 --> 00:07:25,550
on the translation value.

141
00:07:25,550 --> 00:07:29,820
If we increase this value,
there will be more jittery

142
00:07:29,820 --> 00:07:32,830
and they will move in space a lot more.

143
00:07:32,830 --> 00:07:37,020
I advise you to keep this
value between zero and one.

144
00:07:37,020 --> 00:07:40,050
It's a very powerful
tool that can allow you

145
00:07:40,050 --> 00:07:42,250
to get very nice results fast

146
00:07:42,250 --> 00:07:45,833
but you may need to edit to beat the rig.

147
00:07:46,950 --> 00:07:50,620
So let's now try the add-on on our Mac.

148
00:07:50,620 --> 00:07:53,810
I've just reloaded the base motion file.

149
00:07:53,810 --> 00:07:57,780
We have the work cycle
enable in the action editor.

150
00:07:57,780 --> 00:08:02,640
I will select the Bodhi
controller and I will enable

151
00:08:02,640 --> 00:08:04,239
then we go add-on.

152
00:08:04,239 --> 00:08:08,560
As soon as I activate the
add-on on the Bodhi controller,

153
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:12,660
we can see our character
shaking on each step

154
00:08:12,660 --> 00:08:14,260
which is kind of cool.

155
00:08:14,260 --> 00:08:18,720
I have a drop in performances
which is kind of expecting

156
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:23,350
since it's running a
simulation in real time

157
00:08:23,350 --> 00:08:26,860
but it's definitely okay
for me to work on this

158
00:08:26,860 --> 00:08:29,370
increasing the Stiffness and the dumping

159
00:08:29,370 --> 00:08:34,070
to get a more natural motion
or something I like more.

160
00:08:34,070 --> 00:08:35,830
But there is a little issue

161
00:08:35,830 --> 00:08:40,830
or at least limitation compared
to the previous method.

162
00:08:40,950 --> 00:08:44,040
Here, I can't choose what part

163
00:08:44,040 --> 00:08:46,705
of the body is currently leading.

164
00:08:46,705 --> 00:08:51,650
And as you can see, whenever
the character is dropping down,

165
00:08:51,650 --> 00:08:55,090
the front part is dropping down also.

166
00:08:55,090 --> 00:08:57,643
So it's the back part of the body

167
00:08:57,643 --> 00:09:00,410
that is currently dragging in the motion.

168
00:09:00,410 --> 00:09:05,070
So Blender kind of assumed
that the back part of the body

169
00:09:05,070 --> 00:09:08,245
is currently heavier than the front part

170
00:09:08,245 --> 00:09:12,760
which is not what I did in
my animation previously.

171
00:09:12,760 --> 00:09:15,470
And this is not something I can change.

172
00:09:15,470 --> 00:09:18,160
I have no option to deal with this.

173
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:23,150
It depends on the base orientation
of the bone in the rig.

174
00:09:23,150 --> 00:09:27,480
But as an animator, you may
not want to edit the rig.

175
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:29,300
Whenever you want to use this,

176
00:09:29,300 --> 00:09:31,530
you will break everything for sure.

177
00:09:31,530 --> 00:09:34,240
And another big limitation is

178
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:38,600
that we can't constraint
one rotation angle.

179
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:42,023
Here, you can see that the
antenna is currently rotating

180
00:09:42,023 --> 00:09:47,023
along all its axis even
if the axis are locked.

181
00:09:47,190 --> 00:09:50,230
So this is a fantastic add-on

182
00:09:50,230 --> 00:09:54,070
but if you want to
create precise animation

183
00:09:54,070 --> 00:09:57,950
or precise motion along a specific axis,

184
00:09:57,950 --> 00:10:00,730
it might not be the best choice

185
00:10:00,730 --> 00:10:05,730
but for any organic propose,
it can be a huge time saver.
