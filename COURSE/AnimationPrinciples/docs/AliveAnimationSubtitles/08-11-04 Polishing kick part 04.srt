1
00:00:00,090 --> 00:00:02,052
- [Instructor] We are
slowly but surely making it

2
00:00:02,052 --> 00:00:06,150
to the end of the polishing
stage of our character

3
00:00:06,150 --> 00:00:07,770
with the arm polishing.

4
00:00:07,770 --> 00:00:09,190
At this stage of the course,

5
00:00:09,190 --> 00:00:12,370
what I'm doing should not
have any secret for you.

6
00:00:12,370 --> 00:00:15,590
As usual, I will whether track
the hand of the character

7
00:00:15,590 --> 00:00:18,570
or the elbow of the character.

8
00:00:18,570 --> 00:00:21,477
And as it's a forward kinematic chain,

9
00:00:21,477 --> 00:00:24,230
I will start by polishing the shoulder,

10
00:00:24,230 --> 00:00:27,130
the root of the forward kinematic chain.

11
00:00:27,130 --> 00:00:29,870
And as we did before several time now,

12
00:00:29,870 --> 00:00:31,540
I will make the shoulder drag,

13
00:00:31,540 --> 00:00:33,730
especially on those movement

14
00:00:33,730 --> 00:00:35,910
where the character is pretty relaxed.

15
00:00:35,910 --> 00:00:38,290
What I mean here is that you have to spot

16
00:00:38,290 --> 00:00:40,550
whether the shoulder are used

17
00:00:40,550 --> 00:00:42,400
to drive the motion or not.

18
00:00:42,400 --> 00:00:46,620
Whenever our character is
walking or taking a few step back

19
00:00:46,620 --> 00:00:49,420
and forward, he's not choosing the moment

20
00:00:49,420 --> 00:00:52,950
of his arms to pull
himself forward or back.

21
00:00:52,950 --> 00:00:56,080
Generally speaking, the
shoulder will always drag

22
00:00:56,080 --> 00:00:57,730
compared to the chest.

23
00:00:57,730 --> 00:01:01,395
But if you remember well,
during the run cycle,

24
00:01:01,395 --> 00:01:03,480
the shoulder were used

25
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:06,340
to pull the character up and forward.

26
00:01:06,340 --> 00:01:08,770
So they were reaching their extreme

27
00:01:08,770 --> 00:01:11,100
before the center of
gravity of the character.

28
00:01:11,100 --> 00:01:13,130
What I want to point out here

29
00:01:13,130 --> 00:01:16,400
is that the shoulder will
most of the time be dragging

30
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:19,140
but don't be too systematic
with the way you deal

31
00:01:19,140 --> 00:01:22,030
with the dragging because
there are some case,

32
00:01:22,030 --> 00:01:24,670
like the kicking of our character

33
00:01:24,670 --> 00:01:25,940
where you want the shoulder

34
00:01:25,940 --> 00:01:28,830
to reach their extreme a little earlier

35
00:01:28,830 --> 00:01:31,080
as they will participate

36
00:01:31,080 --> 00:01:33,730
in the momentum of the center of gravity,

37
00:01:33,730 --> 00:01:35,280
and the current kick.

38
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:37,070
They are not leading for say,

39
00:01:37,070 --> 00:01:39,070
but they are participating

40
00:01:39,070 --> 00:01:40,630
to the leading force.

41
00:01:40,630 --> 00:01:42,080
In the meantime, as you can see,

42
00:01:42,080 --> 00:01:44,660
I've been tracking the
elbow of my character

43
00:01:44,660 --> 00:01:49,280
and I'm doing my best to get
rid of any harsh angle drawn

44
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:51,450
by the elbow of the character

45
00:01:51,450 --> 00:01:54,110
whether by using the graph editor

46
00:01:54,110 --> 00:01:58,070
or by directly posing the
character in the 3D viewport.

47
00:01:58,070 --> 00:02:01,000
My workflow hasn't changed
since the beginning

48
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,650
of this animation.

49
00:02:02,650 --> 00:02:04,780
I'm focusing on the motion path,

50
00:02:04,780 --> 00:02:06,860
rather than the graph editor.

51
00:02:06,860 --> 00:02:09,760
My goal when the character
is pulling the arm back

52
00:02:09,760 --> 00:02:11,340
is to make the forearm

53
00:02:11,340 --> 00:02:14,660
and the hand move a bit like a serpent,

54
00:02:14,660 --> 00:02:16,480
while the elbow of the character

55
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:18,220
is the head of the serpent

56
00:02:18,220 --> 00:02:20,930
and the fist is the tip of the tail.

57
00:02:20,930 --> 00:02:23,200
This is the kind of motion that I love,

58
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:25,630
and I generally push them very far.

59
00:02:25,630 --> 00:02:28,500
In this case, I've kept it pretty simple

60
00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:32,290
and not too smooth as our
character is contracted.

61
00:02:32,290 --> 00:02:35,800
Once I got this chunk of
the animation polished,

62
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:38,020
I've worked on the kicking move.

63
00:02:38,020 --> 00:02:40,830
I've started by adding
a little more bounce

64
00:02:40,830 --> 00:02:41,990
into the shoulder

65
00:02:41,990 --> 00:02:45,310
by dropping it whenever
the character was jumping,

66
00:02:45,310 --> 00:02:47,776
and then pushing it further up

67
00:02:47,776 --> 00:02:49,880
whenever the character was going down.

68
00:02:49,880 --> 00:02:52,190
And then during the kicking motion

69
00:02:52,190 --> 00:02:55,670
and the hit, I've pushed
the contrast of the curve.

70
00:02:55,670 --> 00:02:57,440
Whenever the curve is going up,

71
00:02:57,440 --> 00:02:59,420
I will push it a little further,

72
00:02:59,420 --> 00:03:01,110
and whenever it's going down,

73
00:03:01,110 --> 00:03:03,290
I will lower it a little more.

74
00:03:03,290 --> 00:03:06,970
This will increase the swinging
range of the whole arm,

75
00:03:06,970 --> 00:03:10,200
and better communicates
the power of the kick.

76
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:14,230
So you can clearly see me
processing the z Euler rotation

77
00:03:14,230 --> 00:03:18,450
on the shoulder that
drives its swinging motion.

78
00:03:18,450 --> 00:03:21,320
Then when the character was falling back

79
00:03:21,320 --> 00:03:23,770
and stepping back into idle,

80
00:03:23,770 --> 00:03:27,620
it was just a matter of
making the shoulder drag.

81
00:03:27,620 --> 00:03:31,800
So going a little up when the
center of gravity's going down

82
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:34,700
and when the center of
gravity is going up,

83
00:03:34,700 --> 00:03:36,520
lower a bit the shoulder.

84
00:03:36,520 --> 00:03:38,310
And once I'm done with the shoulder,

85
00:03:38,310 --> 00:03:41,700
as usual, I will work
with the arm controller.

86
00:03:41,700 --> 00:03:45,420
As usual, I will start by
calculating the motion path

87
00:03:45,420 --> 00:03:49,110
of the elbow and then
tweak the arm controller

88
00:03:49,110 --> 00:03:50,730
during the swinging motion.

89
00:03:50,730 --> 00:03:53,420
Generally speaking, on
this part of the animation,

90
00:03:53,420 --> 00:03:56,150
the motion of the elbow was a bit messy

91
00:03:56,150 --> 00:03:57,570
and popping all around.

92
00:03:57,570 --> 00:03:59,120
So my goal was pretty clear.

93
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:03,540
I wanted the elbow to rapidly
reach its back position,

94
00:04:03,540 --> 00:04:06,770
ease into the extreme, and then go back.

95
00:04:06,770 --> 00:04:08,170
Once I have this space,

96
00:04:08,170 --> 00:04:09,740
I jump into camera view

97
00:04:09,740 --> 00:04:13,330
and I make sure that
the arm is getting out

98
00:04:13,330 --> 00:04:15,063
of the silhouette of the character.

99
00:04:15,063 --> 00:04:18,330
It's not overlapping with
the chest of the character.

100
00:04:18,330 --> 00:04:20,140
So I can achieve this result

101
00:04:20,140 --> 00:04:23,390
by slightly pushing the
x rotation curve up.

102
00:04:23,390 --> 00:04:25,300
From there, the fist is the part

103
00:04:25,300 --> 00:04:28,530
that is going to show the
most from the camera view.

104
00:04:28,530 --> 00:04:30,850
So I will calculate the motion path

105
00:04:30,850 --> 00:04:35,590
from the tip of the fist using
the end tweak controller.

106
00:04:35,590 --> 00:04:38,680
From there, we can see
that from frame 80 to 82,

107
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:41,610
the arm is going forward way too fast.

108
00:04:41,610 --> 00:04:44,150
I wanted it to ease backward

109
00:04:44,150 --> 00:04:47,420
and now it's going forward
as if it was bouncing

110
00:04:47,420 --> 00:04:48,800
against a wall.

111
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:52,480
And on top of this, the motion
path is drawing some kind

112
00:04:52,480 --> 00:04:56,350
of V shape that doesn't
look like a nice arc.

113
00:04:56,350 --> 00:04:59,390
So by repositioning a
bit the arm controller

114
00:04:59,390 --> 00:05:02,270
and working a bit on the z rotation curve

115
00:05:02,270 --> 00:05:05,290
on the forearm, I will
be able to fix this.

116
00:05:05,290 --> 00:05:09,410
So whenever I'm working
on such a tight animation

117
00:05:09,410 --> 00:05:14,290
or motion, meaning that it
occurs upon a very few frame,

118
00:05:14,290 --> 00:05:18,840
I adjusted the curve and
often update the motion path.

119
00:05:18,840 --> 00:05:21,060
And I'm not focusing on the character

120
00:05:21,060 --> 00:05:25,620
but mostly on the arcs drawn
by the tip of his fist.

121
00:05:25,620 --> 00:05:27,620
In the end, I get a nice arc

122
00:05:27,620 --> 00:05:30,010
with an ease-out forward.

123
00:05:30,010 --> 00:05:32,630
So with experience, you will be better

124
00:05:32,630 --> 00:05:34,630
at creating nice poses,

125
00:05:34,630 --> 00:05:37,680
and then sculpting those animation arcs.

126
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:42,170
And this is fundamental to
create a nice animation fast.

127
00:05:42,170 --> 00:05:45,090
From there, I've been
reworking the whole arm

128
00:05:45,090 --> 00:05:47,900
during the steps back of the character.

129
00:05:47,900 --> 00:05:49,700
But since this is something

130
00:05:49,700 --> 00:05:52,300
we have seen multiple time before,

131
00:05:52,300 --> 00:05:55,140
I won't be commenting it anymore.

132
00:05:55,140 --> 00:05:57,560
Once the motion of the arm is polished,

133
00:05:57,560 --> 00:05:59,680
you can work on your smears.

134
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:02,140
At this stage, what mostly matter

135
00:06:02,140 --> 00:06:05,030
is what we are going to
see in the camera view.

136
00:06:05,030 --> 00:06:07,780
Even if I'm rotating around my character

137
00:06:07,780 --> 00:06:10,760
to get a better angle to pose those tweak,

138
00:06:10,760 --> 00:06:13,030
I always come back to the camera view

139
00:06:13,030 --> 00:06:14,560
to double check the pose.

140
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:16,090
Your goal in this case

141
00:06:16,090 --> 00:06:18,820
is to make sure that
the current silhouette

142
00:06:18,820 --> 00:06:21,499
of your character support the arcs.

143
00:06:21,499 --> 00:06:23,670
When building those smears,

144
00:06:23,670 --> 00:06:26,600
don't think of the arm as a current arm

145
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:29,190
but rather think of it as a whip

146
00:06:29,190 --> 00:06:31,000
or a rubber limb.

147
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,710
Here I'm adding a little detail

148
00:06:32,710 --> 00:06:34,900
by breaking the elbow joint

149
00:06:34,900 --> 00:06:37,590
and slightly bending the arm backward

150
00:06:37,590 --> 00:06:41,730
whenever it reaches its
extreme back during the swing.

151
00:06:41,730 --> 00:06:43,640
While having fun building those smears,

152
00:06:43,640 --> 00:06:45,480
don't forget to track your arcs

153
00:06:45,480 --> 00:06:48,924
because since you're
modifying your tweaker bones,

154
00:06:48,924 --> 00:06:51,350
their motion path will change.

155
00:06:51,350 --> 00:06:55,550
So make sure that your
spacing is still relevant.

156
00:06:55,550 --> 00:06:57,720
Regarding the right arm polish,

157
00:06:57,720 --> 00:07:00,000
there is not that much to say.

158
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:03,300
As usual, I will make the shoulder drag.

159
00:07:03,300 --> 00:07:05,770
Then I will work on the arm controller,

160
00:07:05,770 --> 00:07:09,690
making sure I have nice
arcs from the elbows.

161
00:07:09,690 --> 00:07:11,100
Then work on the forearm,

162
00:07:11,100 --> 00:07:14,820
making sure that I have
nice arcs to the wrist.

163
00:07:14,820 --> 00:07:17,990
While you are mainly
focusing on those arcs

164
00:07:17,990 --> 00:07:19,683
in the spacing, don't forget

165
00:07:19,683 --> 00:07:23,367
that if you can clear the
silhouette of your character,

166
00:07:23,367 --> 00:07:24,750
that's always better.

167
00:07:24,750 --> 00:07:26,940
Like for example, avoiding the end

168
00:07:26,940 --> 00:07:29,160
to overlap with the thigh

169
00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:32,640
or make sure that your
negative space allows you

170
00:07:32,640 --> 00:07:35,150
to perfectly read the arm.

171
00:07:35,150 --> 00:07:38,170
With all these little
details taken care of,

172
00:07:38,170 --> 00:07:40,290
I will call this animation done.

173
00:07:40,290 --> 00:07:43,270
As any form of art,
animation is never done

174
00:07:43,270 --> 00:07:46,570
but you have to call your
work finished and move on.

175
00:07:46,570 --> 00:07:49,040
I personally do think that it's better

176
00:07:49,040 --> 00:07:51,630
to get not too far into polishing

177
00:07:51,630 --> 00:07:53,180
and finish your piece

178
00:07:53,180 --> 00:07:55,400
than spending hundred of hours trying

179
00:07:55,400 --> 00:07:56,940
to polish your animation,

180
00:07:56,940 --> 00:07:59,750
getting disgusted or bored about it

181
00:07:59,750 --> 00:08:01,050
and not publish it.

182
00:08:01,050 --> 00:08:05,140
The best animation will sure
bring attention on your work,

183
00:08:05,140 --> 00:08:07,816
and in our world, it's
better to get noticeable,

184
00:08:07,816 --> 00:08:10,090
than the best.

185
00:08:10,090 --> 00:08:12,540
So always try to push your animation

186
00:08:12,540 --> 00:08:14,630
as far possible but make sure

187
00:08:14,630 --> 00:08:16,620
that you finish what you have started.

188
00:08:16,620 --> 00:08:20,240
And hopefully you will
never be 100% satisfied

189
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:22,090
of what you have done.

190
00:08:22,090 --> 00:08:24,760
So that there is always
room for improvement

191
00:08:24,760 --> 00:08:27,660
and that you will do better
on the next animation.

192
00:08:27,660 --> 00:08:31,450
So I would advise to set
yourself some milestone

193
00:08:31,450 --> 00:08:34,560
or deadlines, and this
is exactly what I did

194
00:08:34,560 --> 00:08:35,790
for this animation

195
00:08:35,790 --> 00:08:37,660
where I need to publish the course

196
00:08:37,660 --> 00:08:40,400
and I can't work forever on it.

197
00:08:40,400 --> 00:08:42,770
So it's not as good as I would like

198
00:08:42,770 --> 00:08:45,140
but I do believe it's good enough

199
00:08:45,140 --> 00:08:46,740
to show my workflow,

200
00:08:46,740 --> 00:08:49,060
and I'm really proud of this animation.

201
00:08:49,060 --> 00:08:51,810
Even if I see some part
that could be improved.

202
00:08:51,810 --> 00:08:55,240
Finally, I'd like to add
that animation is fun

203
00:08:55,240 --> 00:08:57,011
and you should keep it fun.

204
00:08:57,011 --> 00:09:01,200
Sometime it's painful
because it's a lot of work

205
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:03,890
but if you take pleasure
doing what you do,

206
00:09:03,890 --> 00:09:05,898
you will progress very fast.

207
00:09:05,898 --> 00:09:07,580
And if you have the chance

208
00:09:07,580 --> 00:09:10,480
to make it your job, you
will be among the few

209
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:12,120
that enjoy their jobs.

210
00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:14,750
And this is sure a life changer

211
00:09:14,750 --> 00:09:17,110
and the key to success.

212
00:09:17,110 --> 00:09:19,390
So I wish you a lot of success

213
00:09:19,390 --> 00:09:21,593
and I will see you in the next video.
