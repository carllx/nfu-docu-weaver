1
00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:02,540
- Now that we have our base pose,

2
00:00:02,540 --> 00:00:05,910
it's time for us to push this pose

3
00:00:05,910 --> 00:00:08,600
to make it more dynamic and appealing.

4
00:00:08,600 --> 00:00:11,100
We have learned before the fundamentals

5
00:00:11,100 --> 00:00:14,140
by identifying the line of action

6
00:00:14,140 --> 00:00:18,160
and studying the basics of
creating a nice silhouette.

7
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:20,540
Now it's time to apply those fundamental

8
00:00:20,540 --> 00:00:22,540
and exaggerate them.

9
00:00:22,540 --> 00:00:24,410
The first thing I'm going to do

10
00:00:24,410 --> 00:00:28,990
is duplicate our current
key frames onto frame two.

11
00:00:28,990 --> 00:00:31,460
This way we can compare both poses

12
00:00:31,460 --> 00:00:34,017
by hitting the up and down arrows.

13
00:00:34,017 --> 00:00:35,670
The first thing we can do

14
00:00:35,670 --> 00:00:39,380
is to push the directionality
of the line of action.

15
00:00:39,380 --> 00:00:40,990
While on our basic pose

16
00:00:40,990 --> 00:00:43,930
our line affection create a nice curve,

17
00:00:43,930 --> 00:00:45,740
I will straighten the line of action

18
00:00:45,740 --> 00:00:47,740
to give it more directionality.

19
00:00:47,740 --> 00:00:50,040
The first thing to do is to lower

20
00:00:50,040 --> 00:00:52,400
the center of gravity of our character

21
00:00:52,400 --> 00:00:55,730
and push it to the side
on the supporting leg.

22
00:00:55,730 --> 00:00:57,860
Then we need to increase the contrast

23
00:00:57,860 --> 00:01:00,167
between the right leg and the left leg,

24
00:01:00,167 --> 00:01:04,540
meaning that I will try
to make the right leg

25
00:01:04,540 --> 00:01:06,430
as straight as possible.

26
00:01:06,430 --> 00:01:08,980
First, with the different
controller in this case

27
00:01:08,980 --> 00:01:11,090
I will slightly move the pole target

28
00:01:11,090 --> 00:01:14,052
and I will also use the tweaker controller

29
00:01:14,052 --> 00:01:18,020
to align the knee with
the ankle and the hips.

30
00:01:18,020 --> 00:01:21,910
Then I will slightly open
the stance of our character,

31
00:01:21,910 --> 00:01:24,410
pushing the left foot a bit backwards

32
00:01:24,410 --> 00:01:27,020
so that it's not out of balance

33
00:01:27,020 --> 00:01:28,580
and indirectly,

34
00:01:28,580 --> 00:01:32,400
contrasting the open
stance of our character.

35
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:35,210
As usual, this is not a linear work,

36
00:01:35,210 --> 00:01:39,297
so I may make the character
leaning forward too much,

37
00:01:39,297 --> 00:01:40,808
then leaning backward,

38
00:01:40,808 --> 00:01:45,808
then trying different poses
that looks more dynamical.

39
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:48,780
In the end, I've chosen to rotate

40
00:01:48,780 --> 00:01:51,143
the center of gravity more forward

41
00:01:51,143 --> 00:01:53,940
so that that it reduces a bit

42
00:01:53,940 --> 00:01:55,750
the profile of the torso

43
00:01:55,750 --> 00:02:00,210
and makes it more aligned
with the line of action.

44
00:02:00,210 --> 00:02:02,770
Then we need to tweak
the position of the hips,

45
00:02:02,770 --> 00:02:05,170
of the torso, of the head also,

46
00:02:05,170 --> 00:02:07,120
tilting it a bit forward,

47
00:02:07,120 --> 00:02:08,374
more into the pose.

48
00:02:08,374 --> 00:02:11,370
And then we can start shaping the arms.

49
00:02:11,370 --> 00:02:13,090
As for the line of action,

50
00:02:13,090 --> 00:02:14,677
where I have a smooth curve.

51
00:02:14,677 --> 00:02:18,610
I've decided to increase
the tension in the arms,

52
00:02:18,610 --> 00:02:20,540
making the right arm straight

53
00:02:20,540 --> 00:02:23,010
and supporting the line with the left arm

54
00:02:23,010 --> 00:02:24,640
by opening it a bit.

55
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:28,600
But I was really hesitating
and still hesitating

56
00:02:28,600 --> 00:02:31,390
to pose it more into an angled way.

57
00:02:31,390 --> 00:02:33,420
I think this pose works too

58
00:02:33,420 --> 00:02:35,290
and is also very strong.

59
00:02:35,290 --> 00:02:37,240
I've straightened what was straight

60
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:41,090
and I've created another
angle where it was angled.

61
00:02:41,090 --> 00:02:43,440
But they feel like there
is more readability

62
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:46,510
in the hand of my initial pose,

63
00:02:46,510 --> 00:02:47,870
so we will stick to it.

64
00:02:47,870 --> 00:02:49,950
So I will raise the shoulders,

65
00:02:49,950 --> 00:02:51,280
I will open the hand,

66
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:54,420
I will slightly rotate it toward the sky

67
00:02:54,420 --> 00:02:57,763
and make sure that the
palm is more open too,

68
00:02:57,763 --> 00:02:59,740
more to the side.

69
00:02:59,740 --> 00:03:01,698
To keep the directionality,

70
00:03:01,698 --> 00:03:04,490
when we open the forearm,

71
00:03:04,490 --> 00:03:07,950
we need to raise the arm
and raise the shoulder.

72
00:03:07,950 --> 00:03:10,550
I will do the same with the left arm,

73
00:03:10,550 --> 00:03:13,235
I will make sure that
it's in the continuity

74
00:03:13,235 --> 00:03:15,368
of the current line of action

75
00:03:15,368 --> 00:03:17,880
and I will slightly open the hand

76
00:03:17,880 --> 00:03:20,737
so that we can clearly see the fingers

77
00:03:20,737 --> 00:03:23,330
on the silhouette of the character

78
00:03:23,330 --> 00:03:25,700
which wasn't the case previously.

79
00:03:25,700 --> 00:03:27,977
While it might not look super natural,

80
00:03:27,977 --> 00:03:30,970
I like to curl the fingers forwards.

81
00:03:30,970 --> 00:03:32,910
It brings a lot of tension

82
00:03:32,910 --> 00:03:36,200
as if our character was pushing the air.

83
00:03:36,200 --> 00:03:37,740
During the whole process,

84
00:03:37,740 --> 00:03:41,280
I will repeat the same
steps again and again.

85
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:46,214
Because it's very odd to push
a controller to its maximum

86
00:03:46,214 --> 00:03:48,971
without comparing it to the other one.

87
00:03:48,971 --> 00:03:53,090
Because the pose is to be read as a whole,

88
00:03:53,090 --> 00:03:55,290
it's a relationship between the legs,

89
00:03:55,290 --> 00:03:57,810
the torso, the arms, etc.

90
00:03:57,810 --> 00:03:59,775
So whenever you're pushing the torso,

91
00:03:59,775 --> 00:04:04,280
then you are rebalancing your
character by moving the feet

92
00:04:04,280 --> 00:04:06,780
and it changes the pose.

93
00:04:06,780 --> 00:04:10,630
But then maybe you want to
push this pose even further.

94
00:04:10,630 --> 00:04:13,320
What I'm trying to explain here is that

95
00:04:13,320 --> 00:04:18,320
you may need to repeat
the process several time

96
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:21,230
before you hit the right pose

97
00:04:21,230 --> 00:04:26,230
or you hit the most extreme
pose or exaggerated pose

98
00:04:27,090 --> 00:04:29,350
that still feels right.

99
00:04:29,350 --> 00:04:32,710
As explained before in
the previous videos,

100
00:04:32,710 --> 00:04:34,810
we are sculpting the pose.

101
00:04:34,810 --> 00:04:36,440
And when you are sculpting,

102
00:04:36,440 --> 00:04:40,460
you don't sculpt the details
of one hand or of the face

103
00:04:40,460 --> 00:04:43,892
without looking at the whole
body of your character.

104
00:04:43,892 --> 00:04:46,340
You generally already start looking

105
00:04:46,340 --> 00:04:49,690
and then you refine each part one by one

106
00:04:49,690 --> 00:04:53,320
and you refine them
depending on the other one.

107
00:04:53,320 --> 00:04:57,500
You refine the proportion of
the head based on the chest

108
00:04:57,500 --> 00:05:01,510
or the proportion of the
legs based on the arm, etc.

109
00:05:01,510 --> 00:05:03,735
And don't fool yourself,

110
00:05:03,735 --> 00:05:06,140
animation as an art form

111
00:05:06,140 --> 00:05:09,680
is really comparable to
drawing or sculpting.

112
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:12,566
Because we are shaping
our whole character,

113
00:05:12,566 --> 00:05:16,320
working on the relationship
between the shoulder,

114
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:17,810
the arms, the forearms,

115
00:05:17,810 --> 00:05:21,130
the hands, the chest, the hips, etc.

116
00:05:21,130 --> 00:05:25,020
So if you have fundamentals
into sculpting or drawing,

117
00:05:25,020 --> 00:05:27,060
make sure you also apply them

118
00:05:27,060 --> 00:05:30,213
whenever you are posing your
character for animation.

119
00:05:30,213 --> 00:05:33,060
And if you don't have any fundamentals

120
00:05:33,060 --> 00:05:34,640
in sculpting of drawing,

121
00:05:34,640 --> 00:05:38,290
don't be afraid to study drawing
and sculpting techniques.

122
00:05:38,290 --> 00:05:41,300
I'm not meaning that you
need to draw every day

123
00:05:41,300 --> 00:05:42,750
or sculpt every day,

124
00:05:42,750 --> 00:05:46,340
but at least read some
book about figure drawing

125
00:05:46,340 --> 00:05:49,018
because you will see that
a lot of the vocabulary

126
00:05:49,018 --> 00:05:50,802
we are using in this course,

127
00:05:50,802 --> 00:05:54,564
or a lot of the fundamentals
we are using in this course

128
00:05:54,564 --> 00:05:58,570
are applied in drawing and sculpting also.

129
00:05:58,570 --> 00:06:02,743
So let's jump into the next
video and work on more poses.
