1
00:00:00,880 --> 00:00:01,980
- [Narrator] Here we go again.

2
00:00:01,980 --> 00:00:05,030
Let's add even more
details to our blocking.

3
00:00:05,030 --> 00:00:07,450
On the video reference, there
is the killer- (cut off)

4
00:00:07,450 --> 00:00:10,550
Whenever Liam Arison is throwing his hook,

5
00:00:10,550 --> 00:00:13,440
I'm kind of shaking in his left shoulder

6
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:15,310
in his chest, and in his head.

7
00:00:15,310 --> 00:00:17,700
it looks like the recoil of a shotgun

8
00:00:17,700 --> 00:00:18,533
or something like that.

9
00:00:18,533 --> 00:00:22,160
To build this effect
I will need two poses,

10
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:24,370
one overshoot of the whole torso

11
00:00:24,370 --> 00:00:26,750
we have the left arm will stay still

12
00:00:26,750 --> 00:00:29,270
and then a second pose
where the whole body

13
00:00:29,270 --> 00:00:31,150
will be pushed backward by

14
00:00:31,150 --> 00:00:33,420
the force applied to the bag by

15
00:00:33,420 --> 00:00:34,253
the left arm.

16
00:00:34,253 --> 00:00:36,960
So basically what we need to do

17
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:40,150
is create an overshoot
for the whole torso,

18
00:00:40,150 --> 00:00:41,960
push it further forward

19
00:00:41,960 --> 00:00:44,930
twist model chest
controller, rotate the head

20
00:00:44,930 --> 00:00:48,220
and the neck to the
right open the right arm,

21
00:00:48,220 --> 00:00:50,990
and then contrapose the left shoulder

22
00:00:50,990 --> 00:00:53,360
and hold left arm controller

23
00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:56,670
as if there were some kind of recoil.

24
00:00:56,670 --> 00:00:59,570
And try to keep the fist
in the same position

25
00:00:59,570 --> 00:01:02,350
World-space-wise as the previous pose.

26
00:01:02,350 --> 00:01:04,480
Even if it's hidden by the bag,

27
00:01:04,480 --> 00:01:07,040
you can squash a bit the fist too.

28
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:08,930
Maybe we will be able to try

29
00:01:08,930 --> 00:01:10,850
some little tricks to better

30
00:01:10,850 --> 00:01:13,640
sell the impact during
the polishing stage.

31
00:01:13,640 --> 00:01:15,610
From there when I'm looking at the motion

32
00:01:15,610 --> 00:01:17,140
of the bag, it seems that

33
00:01:17,140 --> 00:01:19,330
its trajectory is not really good.

34
00:01:19,330 --> 00:01:21,360
And since this is an impact frame,

35
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:22,870
I will give it some love and

36
00:01:22,870 --> 00:01:25,150
spend a bit of time to reshape

37
00:01:25,150 --> 00:01:27,230
the bag and better align it

38
00:01:27,230 --> 00:01:29,040
with the punch. As usual,

39
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:31,277
after we have reviewed all the poses,

40
00:01:31,277 --> 00:01:34,030
I will provide you a slow paced

41
00:01:34,030 --> 00:01:35,510
timelapse so that you can

42
00:01:35,510 --> 00:01:37,580
follow along all the manipulation

43
00:01:37,580 --> 00:01:39,450
I'm doing. Just to note,

44
00:01:39,450 --> 00:01:41,460
don't forget to slightly

45
00:01:41,460 --> 00:01:43,990
change the position of the feet.

46
00:01:43,990 --> 00:01:45,830
The next pose we are going to build

47
00:01:45,830 --> 00:01:48,740
is the actual recoil after the punch.

48
00:01:48,740 --> 00:01:50,270
As seen on the reference

49
00:01:50,270 --> 00:01:51,830
in the beginning of this video,

50
00:01:51,830 --> 00:01:54,140
just after the impact, the chest,

51
00:01:54,140 --> 00:01:56,180
the center of gravity and the hips

52
00:01:56,180 --> 00:01:57,940
are twisting to the left.

53
00:01:57,940 --> 00:01:59,960
It's a pretty subtle change compared

54
00:01:59,960 --> 00:02:01,790
to the previous pose.

55
00:02:01,790 --> 00:02:03,920
All the location and rotation

56
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:06,020
of the torso is going the

57
00:02:06,020 --> 00:02:09,010
opposite way compared with
the previous pose. So,

58
00:02:09,010 --> 00:02:11,660
it's very important to add another pose,

59
00:02:11,660 --> 00:02:13,860
like the bounce in your bouncing ball

60
00:02:13,860 --> 00:02:16,160
while the location of
the ball doesn't change,

61
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:19,400
its shape and the momentum of the ball

62
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:21,200
is completely changing.

63
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:23,628
So you need to block this. If you will

64
00:02:23,628 --> 00:02:26,600
whenever the momentum or the energy

65
00:02:26,600 --> 00:02:28,220
of the current motion

66
00:02:28,220 --> 00:02:30,520
is brutally changing direction,

67
00:02:30,520 --> 00:02:33,530
you should always block those poses.

68
00:02:33,530 --> 00:02:34,750
Getting this pose right

69
00:02:34,750 --> 00:02:37,920
is a lot about the amount
of twisting you input

70
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:40,850
into the chest and the center of gravity.

71
00:02:40,850 --> 00:02:42,210
Then you can find tweaks,

72
00:02:42,210 --> 00:02:46,010
the shoulders position,
the angle made by the arms,

73
00:02:46,010 --> 00:02:48,720
et cetera. I've decided to keep the armor

74
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:51,776
pretty angular into a closed stance

75
00:02:51,776 --> 00:02:54,330
So that it really sells the fact that

76
00:02:54,330 --> 00:02:57,140
our character is fully contracted.

77
00:02:57,140 --> 00:02:59,760
If our character was more relaxed,

78
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:02,070
I will loosen a bit the arms

79
00:03:02,070 --> 00:03:04,180
and I will open them a bit more.

80
00:03:04,180 --> 00:03:07,140
Since this pose occurs after the hit,

81
00:03:07,140 --> 00:03:10,530
don't hesitate to push the heavy bag away

82
00:03:10,530 --> 00:03:11,770
from the character.

83
00:03:11,770 --> 00:03:14,330
The further it is, the more powerful

84
00:03:14,330 --> 00:03:15,820
will the hook feel.

85
00:03:15,820 --> 00:03:17,690
If you can bend, a bit, the bag

86
00:03:17,690 --> 00:03:19,580
towards the point it came from.

87
00:03:19,580 --> 00:03:22,520
This will bring a bit
of overlapping motions

88
00:03:22,520 --> 00:03:24,180
that will make it look a little more

89
00:03:24,180 --> 00:03:25,013
organic.

90
00:03:25,013 --> 00:03:25,846
(wind wooshing)

91
00:03:25,846 --> 00:03:27,470
I previously explain you

92
00:03:27,470 --> 00:03:30,140
that you should always lock the poses

93
00:03:30,140 --> 00:03:32,580
when the feet are getting
in contact with the

94
00:03:32,580 --> 00:03:35,070
ground. Well, I also advise you

95
00:03:35,070 --> 00:03:36,370
to block the poses

96
00:03:36,370 --> 00:03:38,730
whenever the feet are leaving the ground.

97
00:03:38,730 --> 00:03:40,660
For the switch of the switch kick,

98
00:03:40,660 --> 00:03:42,090
we have the previous pose

99
00:03:42,090 --> 00:03:43,410
with both feet on the ground,

100
00:03:43,410 --> 00:03:45,950
and then we have the
pose where both feet have

101
00:03:45,950 --> 00:03:47,060
left the ground.

102
00:03:47,060 --> 00:03:49,250
So we currently need to block the pose

103
00:03:49,250 --> 00:03:50,250
where the character is

104
00:03:50,250 --> 00:03:53,120
pushing into the jump
and still has one foot

105
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:54,040
on the ground.

106
00:03:54,040 --> 00:03:55,360
As we watch the reference,

107
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:58,000
we can see it's a pretty quick jump.

108
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:01,100
And the right foot is the
last to leave the ground.

109
00:04:01,100 --> 00:04:02,790
The goal of this jump is not to

110
00:04:02,790 --> 00:04:06,180
get as high as possible
or to cover distance.

111
00:04:06,180 --> 00:04:09,950
It's all about repositioning
the feet so that the kicking

112
00:04:09,950 --> 00:04:13,620
leg is in the back and
have more range to move

113
00:04:13,620 --> 00:04:14,880
towards the targets.

114
00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:17,940
So don't push the center
of gravity too high.

115
00:04:17,940 --> 00:04:20,270
You can push it a bit to the front

116
00:04:20,270 --> 00:04:23,618
and a bit to the left
since the whole weight

117
00:04:23,618 --> 00:04:27,430
was on top of the right foot
and now the right foot is

118
00:04:27,430 --> 00:04:29,780
pushing. So the center of gravity

119
00:04:29,780 --> 00:04:32,370
will slightly shift towards the front,

120
00:04:32,370 --> 00:04:34,200
but also so toward the left.

121
00:04:34,200 --> 00:04:36,600
Then as the character is rising,

122
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:39,076
you can drop a bit the arms.

123
00:04:39,076 --> 00:04:40,550
(wind wooshing)

124
00:04:40,550 --> 00:04:43,370
Same concept comes for the next pose.

125
00:04:43,370 --> 00:04:44,270
After the jump,

126
00:04:44,270 --> 00:04:46,720
our character doesn't contact the ground

127
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:48,650
with both feet at the same time.

128
00:04:48,650 --> 00:04:50,620
So we do need to build the pose

129
00:04:50,620 --> 00:04:52,530
where the first feet is

130
00:04:52,530 --> 00:04:53,630
contacting the ground.

131
00:04:53,630 --> 00:04:55,870
And as I double check the reference,

132
00:04:55,870 --> 00:04:59,600
we can see that the left
foot is the first to land.

133
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:02,000
So this is what I'm going to build.

134
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,020
But pose wise and motion wise,

135
00:05:04,020 --> 00:05:06,530
I feel like the kick and the switch from

136
00:05:06,530 --> 00:05:09,050
Liam Arison on the left look way more

137
00:05:09,050 --> 00:05:09,883
badass.

138
00:05:09,883 --> 00:05:13,560
As he lands almost into
his anticipation position

139
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:15,730
and throw the kick right away.

140
00:05:15,730 --> 00:05:18,400
I may not be super objective since I love

141
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:19,490
his style.

142
00:05:19,490 --> 00:05:22,220
To get the left foot in
the correct position,

143
00:05:22,220 --> 00:05:23,950
I will simply select it.

144
00:05:23,950 --> 00:05:26,440
Then go to the pose where it's in contact

145
00:05:26,440 --> 00:05:29,180
with the ground, copy
the pose and paste it

146
00:05:29,180 --> 00:05:30,470
on the previous frame.

147
00:05:30,470 --> 00:05:31,840
Since this is the contact pose,

148
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:34,610
I will raise the toes so
that on the next frame,

149
00:05:34,610 --> 00:05:35,870
they will slap on the ground

150
00:05:35,870 --> 00:05:38,260
creating a nice overlapping motion.

151
00:05:38,260 --> 00:05:39,580
To find the pose of the torso

152
00:05:39,580 --> 00:05:41,820
controller, I will use the breakdowner

153
00:05:41,820 --> 00:05:44,130
so I will press shift-E

154
00:05:44,130 --> 00:05:47,400
and I will use a value around 60%

155
00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:49,960
and I will repeat the
process with the foot,

156
00:05:49,960 --> 00:05:51,600
the hips, and the chest.

157
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:53,440
The value of the breakdowner is

158
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:55,180
not the important point.

159
00:05:55,180 --> 00:05:58,430
- Plus this will change
depending on the timing

160
00:05:58,430 --> 00:06:02,110
of animation, if you have
the same pose as I have,

161
00:06:02,110 --> 00:06:05,360
or not, and from one
controller to the other,

162
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:07,530
the timing won't be the same.

163
00:06:07,530 --> 00:06:10,660
So the use of the
breakdowner and the value

164
00:06:10,660 --> 00:06:12,970
of the breakdowner will change.

165
00:06:12,970 --> 00:06:14,820
- Your job is to watch the reference

166
00:06:14,820 --> 00:06:16,520
and understand which part

167
00:06:16,520 --> 00:06:20,070
of the body is arriving
first in the next pose

168
00:06:20,070 --> 00:06:22,550
and use the breakdowner accordingly,

169
00:06:22,550 --> 00:06:25,150
the transition between the landing pose

170
00:06:25,150 --> 00:06:27,024
and the kick and the moment

171
00:06:27,024 --> 00:06:30,830
the kick is being released is very short.

172
00:06:30,830 --> 00:06:34,000
So I've dealt with the next pose exactly

173
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,390
as I will do with a

174
00:06:35,390 --> 00:06:37,530
bouncing ball. As I am finishing

175
00:06:37,530 --> 00:06:40,150
to build the pose before the anticipation

176
00:06:40,150 --> 00:06:40,983
of the kick,

177
00:06:40,983 --> 00:06:42,640
I will consider the next frame

178
00:06:42,640 --> 00:06:44,390
as the contact pose with

179
00:06:44,390 --> 00:06:46,770
both feet contacting the ground.

180
00:06:46,770 --> 00:06:49,380
Then we can consider the next pose

181
00:06:49,380 --> 00:06:51,270
as the ball squashing on

182
00:06:51,270 --> 00:06:53,990
the ground before jumping back.

183
00:06:53,990 --> 00:06:57,051
So I will squash the body of my character

184
00:06:57,051 --> 00:07:00,830
by slightly lowering
its' center of gravity,

185
00:07:00,830 --> 00:07:04,040
before he rise again into the kick.

186
00:07:04,040 --> 00:07:06,010
The difference between the two pose

187
00:07:06,010 --> 00:07:08,120
will be very subtle.

188
00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:11,250
My goal here is to create some kind of

189
00:07:11,250 --> 00:07:12,830
moving hold as we did

190
00:07:12,830 --> 00:07:15,320
for the anticipation of the hook.

191
00:07:15,320 --> 00:07:18,470
But this time the transition
will be very short,

192
00:07:18,470 --> 00:07:20,930
like one or two frames!

193
00:07:20,930 --> 00:07:23,490
So I won't be building a moving hold

194
00:07:23,490 --> 00:07:25,920
with a lot of amplitudes.

195
00:07:25,920 --> 00:07:30,180
I will simply slightly
lower the center of gravity

196
00:07:30,180 --> 00:07:32,610
slightly twist the character,

197
00:07:32,610 --> 00:07:35,120
maybe push a bit the arms inward

198
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:36,870
before the release.

199
00:07:36,870 --> 00:07:39,620
A bit, as if I was creating an overshoot

200
00:07:39,620 --> 00:07:40,950
of the previous pose.

201
00:07:40,950 --> 00:07:44,630
The goal is not truly to guide my posing,

202
00:07:44,630 --> 00:07:48,110
but mostly to lock my timing.

203
00:07:48,110 --> 00:07:50,220
And when I will switch to spline,

204
00:07:50,220 --> 00:07:52,490
there won't be any surprises regarding

205
00:07:52,490 --> 00:07:55,450
the timing of this part of the animation,

206
00:07:55,450 --> 00:07:57,330
since I'm animating "on ones".

207
00:07:57,330 --> 00:08:01,360
So I have a key frame on
every single frame here,

208
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:04,130
but it doesn't mean that I won't have to

209
00:08:04,130 --> 00:08:05,469
rework those poses

210
00:08:05,469 --> 00:08:08,773
during the polishing stage
with the graph editor.
