00:00:01,100 --> 00:00:02,390
- [Instructor] So let's add

2
00:00:02,390 --> 00:00:05,200
quick timing pass to our blocking.

3
00:00:05,200 --> 00:00:08,060
so is that we convert all those poses

4
00:00:08,060 --> 00:00:11,780
into something that will look
like an actual animation.

5
00:00:11,780 --> 00:00:14,500
If you are doing the
same animation as I do,

6
00:00:14,500 --> 00:00:17,780
here is a screen capture of my timing.

7
00:00:17,780 --> 00:00:21,630
You may have noticed that
my key frame have colors.

8
00:00:21,630 --> 00:00:23,940
In the dope sheet or the action editor

9
00:00:23,940 --> 00:00:28,340
you can select keys and
press R to give them a color.

10
00:00:28,340 --> 00:00:31,590
Those different colors
have a different label.

11
00:00:31,590 --> 00:00:34,470
But those are just references.

12
00:00:34,470 --> 00:00:39,390
They absolutely not affect
the way the keys will behave.

13
00:00:39,390 --> 00:00:41,940
And they are just here to give you

14
00:00:41,940 --> 00:00:44,450
a point of reference in your timeline.

15
00:00:44,450 --> 00:00:46,470
I personally never use them,

16
00:00:46,470 --> 00:00:48,930
but for the course it's
a good tool for you

17
00:00:48,930 --> 00:00:50,930
to have a point in reference in time

18
00:00:50,930 --> 00:00:53,390
whenever you are watching my content.

19
00:00:53,390 --> 00:00:56,010
Regarding the timing pass in itself,

20
00:00:56,010 --> 00:00:58,630
I advise you to work by chunks.

21
00:00:58,630 --> 00:01:01,250
For example, I'm working on the timing

22
00:01:01,250 --> 00:01:03,990
of the anticipation of the right cross,

23
00:01:03,990 --> 00:01:06,490
the impact, and the overshoot.

24
00:01:06,490 --> 00:01:08,240
And when this feels right,

25
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:11,010
I will try to time it
with the previous pose.

26
00:01:11,010 --> 00:01:13,070
Remember that you can use the video

27
00:01:13,070 --> 00:01:15,640
reference to time your blocking.

28
00:01:15,640 --> 00:01:18,940
I want the first two punches
to flow pretty quickly.

29
00:01:18,940 --> 00:01:22,500
Since I'm animating at
30 frame per second,

30
00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:26,910
two to four frames between the
two punches should be enough.

31
00:01:26,910 --> 00:01:31,500
This way I should get the
bam, bam I wanted initially.

32
00:01:31,500 --> 00:01:33,200
With this first chunk done,

33
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:36,630
I can then work on the
second half of the animation.

34
00:01:36,630 --> 00:01:39,840
But I want a pretty big
anticipation on the hook

35
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:41,980
to break the rhythm of the animation

36
00:01:41,980 --> 00:01:44,200
and also give it more strength.

37
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:46,670
Though some poses are easier to time,

38
00:01:46,670 --> 00:01:48,920
like the overshoot of the kick generally.

39
00:01:48,920 --> 00:01:52,290
And overshoot is one or two frame

40
00:01:52,290 --> 00:01:55,670
after the current hit
on the current extreme.

41
00:01:55,670 --> 00:01:57,580
There, it's a lot of back and forth.

42
00:01:57,580 --> 00:02:00,250
You have to play the animation a lot,

43
00:02:00,250 --> 00:02:02,760
then move some of the keys and see

44
00:02:02,760 --> 00:02:04,330
if the flow is getting better.

45
00:02:04,330 --> 00:02:06,840
I would also recommend you to share

46
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:09,250
your work at this stage if you can.

47
00:02:09,250 --> 00:02:13,410
It's always very valuable to
have fresh eyes upon your work,

48
00:02:13,410 --> 00:02:16,110
even if it's not a professional animator.

49
00:02:16,110 --> 00:02:18,520
When you're animating all day long,

50
00:02:18,520 --> 00:02:22,990
you easily get over focused
and you have a hard time

51
00:02:22,990 --> 00:02:26,410
spotting what's wrong or
right into your animation.

52
00:02:26,410 --> 00:02:29,960
So as you can see, I played
the animation several time,

53
00:02:29,960 --> 00:02:33,040
and then I decided to whether increase

54
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:35,840
or decrease the length of a pose.

55
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:37,550
Here for example, I will
make the anticipation

56
00:02:37,550 --> 00:02:40,300
from the hook a little longer.

57
00:02:40,300 --> 00:02:42,720
It will bring more power to the hook.

58
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:46,030
One last advice I'd like to remind you,

59
00:02:46,030 --> 00:02:49,400
give yourself some space at
the end of the animation.

60
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:51,940
This way you will clearly identify

61
00:02:51,940 --> 00:02:56,420
when the animation is finishing
and when it's restarting.

62
00:02:56,420 --> 00:03:00,440
It will remove the visual
noise of your character

63
00:03:00,440 --> 00:03:03,283
jumping from one position to the other.
