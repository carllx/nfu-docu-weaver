1
00:00:00,930 --> 00:00:03,010
- [Instructor] Let's
polish our bouncing ball.

2
00:00:03,010 --> 00:00:04,340
The first thing I will do

3
00:00:04,340 --> 00:00:07,200
is select all the key, press T

4
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:08,740
and switch to Bezier.

5
00:00:08,740 --> 00:00:11,470
Now we have interpolation
between our keyframes

6
00:00:11,470 --> 00:00:13,120
and the first thing we can see

7
00:00:13,120 --> 00:00:15,510
that we get some slowing down

8
00:00:15,510 --> 00:00:18,100
or easing before the
ball touch the ground.

9
00:00:18,100 --> 00:00:19,490
You can switch to the graph editor

10
00:00:19,490 --> 00:00:22,650
through the header or
pressing Control + tab

11
00:00:22,650 --> 00:00:24,560
when you are in the action editor.

12
00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:27,620
I have activated the display selected only

13
00:00:27,620 --> 00:00:31,310
and I will start polishing
the route of my ball.

14
00:00:31,310 --> 00:00:32,720
When looking at the curve,

15
00:00:32,720 --> 00:00:35,770
I can see that only the z and y curves

16
00:00:35,770 --> 00:00:38,167
are currently animated.

17
00:00:38,167 --> 00:00:43,020
All the rotation, scaling and
x location curve are flat.

18
00:00:43,020 --> 00:00:44,741
To make my editing easier,

19
00:00:44,741 --> 00:00:47,540
I will expand the root panel

20
00:00:47,540 --> 00:00:50,370
and I will just hide all the curves

21
00:00:50,370 --> 00:00:51,820
that I'm not using,

22
00:00:51,820 --> 00:00:55,000
only keeping the z and y location curve.

23
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:58,260
Remember what we have seen
in the previous chapter.

24
00:00:58,260 --> 00:01:00,220
When an object is falling,

25
00:01:00,220 --> 00:01:02,810
it is at its maximum speed

26
00:01:02,810 --> 00:01:05,010
just before hitting the ground,

27
00:01:05,010 --> 00:01:08,830
so I can select my z contacting keyframe,

28
00:01:08,830 --> 00:01:11,070
press V and switch it to three

29
00:01:11,070 --> 00:01:13,600
and then rotate the left handle

30
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:15,750
to get a proper curve.

31
00:01:15,750 --> 00:01:18,140
It already feels way better.

32
00:01:18,140 --> 00:01:21,980
But I'm a bit disturbed by
the y motion of the ball.

33
00:01:21,980 --> 00:01:24,200
The frame just before
it contact the ground

34
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:25,490
looks a bit weird.

35
00:01:25,490 --> 00:01:29,400
And this is because we
have easing on our y curve.

36
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:31,800
The y curve has an S shape

37
00:01:31,800 --> 00:01:33,830
between the IS point

38
00:01:33,830 --> 00:01:35,480
and it's contacting pull.

39
00:01:35,480 --> 00:01:37,900
But as seen in the previous chapter,

40
00:01:37,900 --> 00:01:39,760
when a ball is falling,

41
00:01:39,760 --> 00:01:42,810
it is accelerating until
it touch the ground

42
00:01:42,810 --> 00:01:46,380
but its motion forward is pretty constant

43
00:01:46,380 --> 00:01:48,760
because even if there is air friction

44
00:01:48,760 --> 00:01:50,450
that will slow down the ball,

45
00:01:50,450 --> 00:01:53,690
on such a motion, it's barely noticeable.

46
00:01:53,690 --> 00:01:57,520
So I can switch both
handles to free our vector

47
00:01:57,520 --> 00:02:01,580
and align them to get a
more linear interpolation.

48
00:02:01,580 --> 00:02:05,410
So as a first polishing
path or splining path,

49
00:02:05,410 --> 00:02:09,680
I will simply repeat this
process on each bounce.

50
00:02:09,680 --> 00:02:11,310
To get a clean viewport,

51
00:02:11,310 --> 00:02:14,727
I'm activating and
deactivating the overlay

52
00:02:14,727 --> 00:02:17,700
with a shortcut I've set previously.

53
00:02:17,700 --> 00:02:20,800
So I will break all the z-axis handle

54
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:22,630
by switching them to vector

55
00:02:22,630 --> 00:02:24,170
on the contacting frame.

56
00:02:24,170 --> 00:02:28,110
I will remove the intermediate
frame on the y-axis

57
00:02:28,110 --> 00:02:29,410
because it's useless

58
00:02:29,410 --> 00:02:32,740
since we will create
a linear interpolation

59
00:02:32,740 --> 00:02:35,330
between the contacting and air pose,

60
00:02:35,330 --> 00:02:37,720
switching our handles to vector.

61
00:02:37,720 --> 00:02:42,230
I will use this method each
time the ball is airborne

62
00:02:42,230 --> 00:02:45,420
but on the final stage of the animation,

63
00:02:45,420 --> 00:02:49,300
I will keep the easing toward
the very last keyframe.

64
00:02:49,300 --> 00:02:52,040
So as you remember in
the previous chapter,

65
00:02:52,040 --> 00:02:55,580
I like to keep the ball a bit
longer in the air generally

66
00:02:55,580 --> 00:02:57,540
just for style sake.

67
00:02:57,540 --> 00:02:59,093
So on the z curve,

68
00:02:59,093 --> 00:03:03,240
I will take each key where
the ball is in the air

69
00:03:03,240 --> 00:03:06,990
and I will slightly scale the handles.

70
00:03:06,990 --> 00:03:10,396
This way, the ball will rise
a little faster in the air

71
00:03:10,396 --> 00:03:13,790
and it will be kind of thwarting a bit.

72
00:03:13,790 --> 00:03:18,051
Please consider that animation
is not a linear workflow.

73
00:03:18,051 --> 00:03:20,440
And I will remove some keyframe,

74
00:03:20,440 --> 00:03:24,910
remove them, retime some
part of the animation

75
00:03:24,910 --> 00:03:26,850
and tweak it a lot.

76
00:03:26,850 --> 00:03:28,740
So it's a lot of back and forth

77
00:03:28,740 --> 00:03:32,210
before you achieve a decent result.

78
00:03:32,210 --> 00:03:34,560
And you can tweak an animation forever

79
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:37,310
but there is a moment
where you have to stop.

80
00:03:37,310 --> 00:03:38,750
Before the second bounce,

81
00:03:38,750 --> 00:03:42,130
I feel like there is a slight
glitch in the animation

82
00:03:42,130 --> 00:03:45,240
because the ball is staying
too long on the ground.

83
00:03:45,240 --> 00:03:48,870
So I will shorten this hold
on the ground by one key,

84
00:03:48,870 --> 00:03:52,630
offsetting all the keys
after key number 20.

85
00:03:52,630 --> 00:03:54,760
As it does improve the animation,

86
00:03:54,760 --> 00:03:59,060
I will do the same
between frame 25 and 26.

87
00:03:59,060 --> 00:04:00,650
There is a hold on the ground

88
00:04:00,650 --> 00:04:02,860
but I feel it's too much.

89
00:04:02,860 --> 00:04:05,870
So I will get rid of frame 26

90
00:04:05,870 --> 00:04:09,280
by offsetting it onto frame 25

91
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:11,230
so that on the very last bounce,

92
00:04:11,230 --> 00:04:14,450
the ball is staying on the
ground only for one frame

93
00:04:14,450 --> 00:04:15,610
instead of two.

94
00:04:15,610 --> 00:04:19,290
If we now have a closer
look to our y curve,

95
00:04:19,290 --> 00:04:22,840
we can see that we have
a pretty logical pattern.

96
00:04:22,840 --> 00:04:25,250
Each time the ball touch the ground,

97
00:04:25,250 --> 00:04:28,050
the y curve get flatter and flatter,

98
00:04:28,050 --> 00:04:30,640
meaning that the ball is losing speed

99
00:04:30,640 --> 00:04:33,340
on each impact but when airborne,

100
00:04:33,340 --> 00:04:35,750
it has a linear movement.

101
00:04:35,750 --> 00:04:38,340
And as soon as it stays on the ground,

102
00:04:38,340 --> 00:04:40,660
we will have a slight easing

103
00:04:40,660 --> 00:04:43,830
from frame 29 to frame 43

104
00:04:43,830 --> 00:04:45,700
when the ball is slowing down.

105
00:04:45,700 --> 00:04:47,920
Watching the animation again and again,

106
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:50,370
I feel like there are still some glitches

107
00:04:50,370 --> 00:04:52,097
and some bugs I have to fix

108
00:04:52,097 --> 00:04:55,390
and when having a closer
look at my z curve,

109
00:04:55,390 --> 00:04:57,480
I can see that I have some easing

110
00:04:57,480 --> 00:05:00,500
after the impact, which is not correct.

111
00:05:00,500 --> 00:05:02,560
So I will fix this.

112
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:04,130
After those modification,

113
00:05:04,130 --> 00:05:06,390
my animation should look better

114
00:05:06,390 --> 00:05:08,553
but I still have some glitches.

115
00:05:08,553 --> 00:05:12,250
And this is because all the
transformation we have done

116
00:05:12,250 --> 00:05:14,050
with the squash and stretch

117
00:05:14,050 --> 00:05:15,481
haven't been polished

118
00:05:15,481 --> 00:05:18,170
and haven't be retimed.

119
00:05:18,170 --> 00:05:20,120
I've made a few modification

120
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:23,580
on the timing of the route of my ball,

121
00:05:23,580 --> 00:05:27,140
so now the other animation
that were in sync

122
00:05:27,140 --> 00:05:28,660
during the blocking stage

123
00:05:28,660 --> 00:05:30,390
are no longer in sync.

124
00:05:30,390 --> 00:05:33,940
So I will deactivate all
the other transform channel

125
00:05:33,940 --> 00:05:36,560
just to see my root motion.

126
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:40,090
And now I can see that
it feels way better.

127
00:05:40,090 --> 00:05:42,420
So there is still this moment

128
00:05:42,420 --> 00:05:44,550
where the ball stops on the ground

129
00:05:44,550 --> 00:05:47,810
but this is because we will have motion

130
00:05:47,810 --> 00:05:49,840
through the squash and stretch.

131
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:51,950
So without the squash and stretch,

132
00:05:51,950 --> 00:05:53,520
it looks a bit weird

133
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:57,690
but as I renabled it and
as I will be polishing it,

134
00:05:57,690 --> 00:06:00,460
I will be able to fix the problem here.

135
00:06:00,460 --> 00:06:03,679
If you want your animation
to look a bit more realistic,

136
00:06:03,679 --> 00:06:06,250
just remove those holding frame

137
00:06:06,250 --> 00:06:09,870
and just make the contacting
pose on one frame.

138
00:06:09,870 --> 00:06:12,360
Then reduce a bit the squash and stretch.

139
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:15,540
This is just a matter
of personal preferences.

140
00:06:15,540 --> 00:06:17,670
I like it a bit stylized,

141
00:06:17,670 --> 00:06:20,220
so I'll keep those holding poses.

142
00:06:20,220 --> 00:06:24,300
I will now work on the upper
squash and stretch controller.

143
00:06:24,300 --> 00:06:27,390
This one is going to be
pretty easy to polish.

144
00:06:27,390 --> 00:06:28,960
I select the first keyframe

145
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:33,440
and press on the dot key on
the num pad to frame them.

146
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:36,860
I'm mainly watching the
orientation of the ball created

147
00:06:36,860 --> 00:06:38,300
by the stretching effect.

148
00:06:38,300 --> 00:06:41,490
You can also calculate the
motion path of this ball

149
00:06:41,490 --> 00:06:42,610
if this does help.

150
00:06:42,610 --> 00:06:46,470
Here what I want is to give
back a bit of verticality

151
00:06:46,470 --> 00:06:47,620
to the ball.

152
00:06:47,620 --> 00:06:50,370
So I will slightly offset the beginning

153
00:06:50,370 --> 00:06:53,170
of the stretching on the y-axis.

154
00:06:53,170 --> 00:06:56,960
I will hide the z curve
by clicking the I icon

155
00:06:56,960 --> 00:06:59,030
and then select the first keyframe,

156
00:06:59,030 --> 00:07:01,100
press Shift + D to duplicate it

157
00:07:01,100 --> 00:07:04,280
and move the duplicated
key on frame three.

158
00:07:04,280 --> 00:07:06,090
As it looks a bit too delayed,

159
00:07:06,090 --> 00:07:09,440
I will move back this
key on frame number two

160
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:13,003
and then I will switch
the handle type to three

161
00:07:13,003 --> 00:07:15,850
so that I can shape a bit the curve.

162
00:07:15,850 --> 00:07:17,870
This way, I have a better feeling

163
00:07:17,870 --> 00:07:20,250
that the ball is currently aiming

164
00:07:20,250 --> 00:07:23,380
or pointing toward its landing spot.

165
00:07:23,380 --> 00:07:25,810
Then I will work on the z curve

166
00:07:25,810 --> 00:07:29,394
that currently squash and
stretch the ball the most.

167
00:07:29,394 --> 00:07:33,820
And I will just switch
the impact point to vector

168
00:07:33,820 --> 00:07:36,200
because this is an impact frame

169
00:07:36,200 --> 00:07:40,660
where the ball switch from
squashing to stretching again.

170
00:07:40,660 --> 00:07:43,310
Then I will go onto the next jump.

171
00:07:43,310 --> 00:07:45,930
I will reselect my root bone

172
00:07:45,930 --> 00:07:48,810
and I will recalculate the motion path

173
00:07:48,810 --> 00:07:50,971
because it does help me figuring

174
00:07:50,971 --> 00:07:53,720
where the ball is supposed to land

175
00:07:53,720 --> 00:07:56,030
and also where the top of the ball

176
00:07:56,030 --> 00:07:57,890
is supposed to be pointing at

177
00:07:57,890 --> 00:07:59,500
and this is why here,

178
00:07:59,500 --> 00:08:03,187
I will slightly push the
top to the ball forward

179
00:08:03,187 --> 00:08:05,440
toward the previous keyframe position

180
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:08,820
by pushing my z curve a
bit up in the graph editor.

181
00:08:08,820 --> 00:08:10,830
I scrub a bit onto my animation

182
00:08:10,830 --> 00:08:12,950
to see how it does move.

183
00:08:12,950 --> 00:08:15,640
Then I will select the z-axis curve,

184
00:08:15,640 --> 00:08:18,960
switch it to vector on this middle frame

185
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:22,800
and then move forward
toward the next jump.

186
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:25,270
First, I feel like it's offset in time.

187
00:08:25,270 --> 00:08:27,000
So I will select all the curves

188
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:30,770
and move them by one keyframe
prior to the current one.

189
00:08:30,770 --> 00:08:33,630
The ball is currently
leaning too much backward

190
00:08:33,630 --> 00:08:34,730
on on these three

191
00:08:34,730 --> 00:08:38,860
and I can figure this by
watching the F curve value.

192
00:08:38,860 --> 00:08:40,680
When selecting the keyframe,

193
00:08:40,680 --> 00:08:43,673
I can see that its value is set to -65

194
00:08:45,140 --> 00:08:49,290
and if I select the
previous one, it has -56.

195
00:08:49,290 --> 00:08:53,222
It means that this last
keyframe is further away

196
00:08:53,222 --> 00:08:55,230
from its value zero

197
00:08:55,230 --> 00:08:58,590
so it means the controller is offset more

198
00:08:58,590 --> 00:09:01,590
and so it's more deforming the ball

199
00:09:01,590 --> 00:09:03,410
than the previous bounce,

200
00:09:03,410 --> 00:09:06,400
which doesn't make sense since this bounce

201
00:09:06,400 --> 00:09:08,010
is less powerful,

202
00:09:08,010 --> 00:09:11,290
losing energy compared
to the previous bounce.

203
00:09:11,290 --> 00:09:13,053
So I will push this keyframe

204
00:09:13,053 --> 00:09:16,030
towards zero in the graph editor.

205
00:09:16,030 --> 00:09:18,230
For the very last bounce of the ball,

206
00:09:18,230 --> 00:09:20,205
I don't want any deformation.

207
00:09:20,205 --> 00:09:23,820
So I will just get rid
of the next keyframes.

208
00:09:23,820 --> 00:09:27,580
From there, we can watch
our animation several time

209
00:09:27,580 --> 00:09:31,453
and jump into polishing the
next squashing controller.

210
00:09:32,450 --> 00:09:35,484
I will select the lower green controller

211
00:09:35,484 --> 00:09:38,290
and since the curve are pretty small,

212
00:09:38,290 --> 00:09:40,210
I will use the normalize option

213
00:09:40,210 --> 00:09:42,420
to be able to see my green channel.

214
00:09:42,420 --> 00:09:46,030
Since we have used the
upper green controller

215
00:09:46,030 --> 00:09:49,210
to give an orientation to
the bounces of the ball,

216
00:09:49,210 --> 00:09:50,850
I don't need to do the same

217
00:09:50,850 --> 00:09:52,680
with the lower controller.

218
00:09:52,680 --> 00:09:55,435
So I will just make my y curve flat

219
00:09:55,435 --> 00:09:59,000
by removing the keys that are offset

220
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:02,230
because they won't bring
anything good to our animation

221
00:10:02,230 --> 00:10:04,970
and they are currently almost useless

222
00:10:04,970 --> 00:10:07,290
as their value is very small.

223
00:10:07,290 --> 00:10:09,155
So just get rid of them.

224
00:10:09,155 --> 00:10:11,260
Now regarding the z-axis

225
00:10:11,260 --> 00:10:14,590
that will allow us to
squash the ball in the air

226
00:10:14,590 --> 00:10:16,921
when it's reaching its highest point,

227
00:10:16,921 --> 00:10:19,400
I want it to be very subtle.

228
00:10:19,400 --> 00:10:22,670
So I will offset the
starting and ending keyframe

229
00:10:22,670 --> 00:10:26,370
of those motion by two frames.

230
00:10:26,370 --> 00:10:30,275
And I will repeat this process
along the whole animation.

231
00:10:30,275 --> 00:10:34,470
I will shorten the length of this motion

232
00:10:34,470 --> 00:10:35,912
and as I go forward,

233
00:10:35,912 --> 00:10:39,330
I will reduce the amplitude of the curve

234
00:10:39,330 --> 00:10:42,440
because again, with energy loss,

235
00:10:42,440 --> 00:10:47,440
I will get the less squash
and stretch on this motion.

236
00:10:47,500 --> 00:10:51,620
This controller allow us to
add very subtle deformation

237
00:10:51,620 --> 00:10:53,848
to the ball, so it's interesting

238
00:10:53,848 --> 00:10:57,100
to make it as good as possible.

239
00:10:57,100 --> 00:10:58,210
When I'm done with it,

240
00:10:58,210 --> 00:11:00,890
we can clearly see the energy loss

241
00:11:00,890 --> 00:11:03,070
during the motion of the ball.

242
00:11:03,070 --> 00:11:05,830
I will fix the timing of the last squash

243
00:11:05,830 --> 00:11:08,220
because it doesn't
occur at the right time.

244
00:11:08,220 --> 00:11:09,870
It's supposed to happen

245
00:11:09,870 --> 00:11:12,620
when the ball is at its highest point.

246
00:11:12,620 --> 00:11:16,250
And then again I can watch
my animation several time

247
00:11:16,250 --> 00:11:17,993
to see if it looks okay.

248
00:11:20,210 --> 00:11:21,220
So that's great.

249
00:11:21,220 --> 00:11:24,260
We have a bouncing ball
but it's not rolling.

250
00:11:24,260 --> 00:11:27,970
This is because we haven't
animated the rotation controller

251
00:11:27,970 --> 00:11:29,080
of the ball yet.

252
00:11:29,080 --> 00:11:31,320
In this case, it wouldn't make sense

253
00:11:31,320 --> 00:11:34,230
to block the spinning of the ball.

254
00:11:34,230 --> 00:11:37,070
Since it doesn't change its shape,

255
00:11:37,070 --> 00:11:40,110
we wouldn't be able to see any change

256
00:11:40,110 --> 00:11:41,720
during the blocking stage.

257
00:11:41,720 --> 00:11:43,910
So I will select all the keyframes

258
00:11:43,910 --> 00:11:46,030
but the first one and get rid of them.

259
00:11:46,030 --> 00:11:48,710
Just press X and confirm.

260
00:11:48,710 --> 00:11:50,310
Then select the first keyframe

261
00:11:50,310 --> 00:11:52,330
and move it on frame eight.

262
00:11:52,330 --> 00:11:53,770
This is the frame where the ball

263
00:11:53,770 --> 00:11:55,480
is contacting the ground.

264
00:11:55,480 --> 00:11:57,380
So I get a flat curve

265
00:11:57,380 --> 00:11:59,340
from frame zero to frame eight.

266
00:11:59,340 --> 00:12:03,380
It means that the ball won't be rolling

267
00:12:03,380 --> 00:12:05,310
while it's in the air.

268
00:12:05,310 --> 00:12:07,770
I want it to start spinning

269
00:12:07,770 --> 00:12:10,000
when it will touch the ground

270
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:13,360
and when part of the energy of the impact

271
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:16,610
will be transferred to its rotation.

272
00:12:16,610 --> 00:12:19,477
I will duplicate again the keyframe

273
00:12:19,477 --> 00:12:21,220
and move it to move frame 18.

274
00:12:21,220 --> 00:12:24,710
This is where I want the
ball to be spinning already.

275
00:12:24,710 --> 00:12:27,340
Nothing happens because I have disabled

276
00:12:27,340 --> 00:12:28,560
the transform channel.

277
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:30,670
I need to reenable it.

278
00:12:30,670 --> 00:12:32,300
Now when I move the curve,

279
00:12:32,300 --> 00:12:33,910
the ball should be rotating

280
00:12:33,910 --> 00:12:35,858
but it's barely noticeable

281
00:12:35,858 --> 00:12:37,840
and this is because I need

282
00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:40,123
to unzoom in my graph editor.

283
00:12:40,123 --> 00:12:44,230
Since the value of the
rotation is in degree,

284
00:12:44,230 --> 00:12:47,200
I need to drastically modify the curve

285
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:50,760
and move it onto way
higher or lower values

286
00:12:50,760 --> 00:12:51,730
in this case.

287
00:12:51,730 --> 00:12:55,600
Pushing the value down to -360 degree

288
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:57,790
will make the roll spin forward.

289
00:12:57,790 --> 00:12:58,910
So that's fine.

290
00:12:58,910 --> 00:13:01,677
On the impact, the ball will
get full rotation speed,

291
00:13:01,677 --> 00:13:04,090
so I will switch this to vector.

292
00:13:04,090 --> 00:13:06,310
Due to the frequency of the rotation

293
00:13:06,310 --> 00:13:09,490
and the animation, I have
a hard time figuring out

294
00:13:09,490 --> 00:13:12,210
if the ball is currently rotating or not

295
00:13:12,210 --> 00:13:15,490
because the ball pattern
seems to get aligned

296
00:13:15,490 --> 00:13:18,130
on each frame so it's a bit weird.

297
00:13:18,130 --> 00:13:20,210
So I will get rid of the overlay

298
00:13:20,210 --> 00:13:22,087
to have a better vision of it.

299
00:13:22,087 --> 00:13:24,650
I will also switch the second handle

300
00:13:24,650 --> 00:13:27,680
to vector two because
the rotation of the ball

301
00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:30,270
is not supposed to slow in the air

302
00:13:30,270 --> 00:13:33,490
and since I still have some difficulties

303
00:13:33,490 --> 00:13:34,910
to read the rotation,

304
00:13:34,910 --> 00:13:38,640
I will enable all the
other controller keyframe

305
00:13:38,640 --> 00:13:41,540
and disable their
influence on the animation

306
00:13:41,540 --> 00:13:43,070
so that I can clearly see

307
00:13:43,070 --> 00:13:45,113
if my ball is rotating or not.

308
00:13:46,350 --> 00:13:48,910
The initial air rotation speed

309
00:13:48,910 --> 00:13:52,350
of our bouncing ball
is not that important.

310
00:13:52,350 --> 00:13:54,000
What will be important

311
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:57,310
is the final rotation speed

312
00:13:57,310 --> 00:14:00,950
because it will have to match the speed

313
00:14:00,950 --> 00:14:03,830
of the ball traveling on the ground.

314
00:14:03,830 --> 00:14:07,390
So what we need to do is to
duplicate the current keyframe

315
00:14:07,390 --> 00:14:11,090
and move it on the next contact post.

316
00:14:11,090 --> 00:14:15,110
And we need to make the ball
spinning a little less faster

317
00:14:15,110 --> 00:14:16,390
than the previous pose

318
00:14:16,390 --> 00:14:20,240
because it's losing energy on each bounce,

319
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:23,460
so it's also losing rotation speed.

320
00:14:23,460 --> 00:14:27,960
Then we will create a
last keyframe on frame 43.

321
00:14:27,960 --> 00:14:30,210
It's the frame where the bouncing ball

322
00:14:30,210 --> 00:14:33,030
is currently stopping in space.

323
00:14:33,030 --> 00:14:36,920
And this time we will
switch it's handle type

324
00:14:36,920 --> 00:14:41,450
to Bezier because we need
some easing in the end.

325
00:14:41,450 --> 00:14:44,370
We don't need a linear interpolation.

326
00:14:44,370 --> 00:14:46,000
The ball is slowing down

327
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:49,290
so its rotation is also slowing down.

328
00:14:49,290 --> 00:14:52,720
To make this stage
readable, I need the grid

329
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:56,240
because I will need a
point of reference in space

330
00:14:56,240 --> 00:14:58,340
to see if the pattern of the ball

331
00:14:58,340 --> 00:15:01,330
is still aligned with
it whenever it's rolling

332
00:15:01,330 --> 00:15:02,220
on the ground.

333
00:15:02,220 --> 00:15:04,850
So I will re-enable the overlay

334
00:15:04,850 --> 00:15:08,220
and I will zoom a lot onto my animation.

335
00:15:08,220 --> 00:15:10,270
Now I will try to find the point

336
00:15:10,270 --> 00:15:12,610
of reference using the pattern of the ball

337
00:15:12,610 --> 00:15:13,443
and the grid.

338
00:15:13,443 --> 00:15:17,060
When I find it, I will
Shift and right click on it

339
00:15:17,060 --> 00:15:19,190
to place the 3D cursor.

340
00:15:19,190 --> 00:15:21,090
Now what I want is to make sure

341
00:15:21,090 --> 00:15:22,900
that the pattern of the ball

342
00:15:22,900 --> 00:15:27,600
is pointing toward the 3D
cursor as the ball stop.

343
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:29,870
To do so, just zoom a lot

344
00:15:29,870 --> 00:15:33,830
and then fine tweak the
position of your last keyframe.

345
00:15:33,830 --> 00:15:37,320
You will also need to
slightly tweak the rotation

346
00:15:37,320 --> 00:15:41,840
or orientation and
scale of the last handle

347
00:15:41,840 --> 00:15:45,280
to make sure that we don't
have this sliding effect

348
00:15:45,280 --> 00:15:46,220
on the ground.

349
00:15:46,220 --> 00:15:48,210
Just do it by little touch.

350
00:15:48,210 --> 00:15:51,910
If you see that your
animation is completely off,

351
00:15:51,910 --> 00:15:55,538
it means that your whole
curve is completely off

352
00:15:55,538 --> 00:15:58,479
and the difference between your final key

353
00:15:58,479 --> 00:16:02,200
and the previous key,
the key from frame 30

354
00:16:02,200 --> 00:16:03,430
is way too big.

355
00:16:03,430 --> 00:16:06,310
Rotation easing when
you have a contact pose

356
00:16:06,310 --> 00:16:10,090
is pretty hard to get
right on the first shot,

357
00:16:10,090 --> 00:16:12,430
so be patient, tweak your curve

358
00:16:12,430 --> 00:16:16,600
until you get this nice
rotation on the ground

359
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:20,280
and the feeling that the ball
is really rolling onto it.

360
00:16:20,280 --> 00:16:22,810
And if you can't achieve
this, don't panic.

361
00:16:22,810 --> 00:16:25,060
Open a new Blender file

362
00:16:25,060 --> 00:16:28,360
and just make the ball
rolling and stopping.

363
00:16:28,360 --> 00:16:32,628
Work on the curve until you
get this animation right

364
00:16:32,628 --> 00:16:36,130
and you will understand the relationship

365
00:16:36,130 --> 00:16:40,560
between your rotation curve
and your translation curve.

366
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:45,090
It's not a question of math
or geometry or whatever.

367
00:16:45,090 --> 00:16:48,200
It's just a question of practice.

368
00:16:48,200 --> 00:16:50,690
It might be a bit complicated at first

369
00:16:50,690 --> 00:16:52,230
but with a bit of training,

370
00:16:52,230 --> 00:16:53,630
you will get comfortable

371
00:16:53,630 --> 00:16:55,990
with this kind of motion pretty soon.

372
00:16:55,990 --> 00:16:59,200
And if you really want
to get good at animation,

373
00:16:59,200 --> 00:17:00,430
it's very important

374
00:17:00,430 --> 00:17:03,660
because you will use
animation curves every day.

375
00:17:03,660 --> 00:17:07,100
So from there, I can
call this animation done

376
00:17:07,100 --> 00:17:09,210
but there were a few glitches

377
00:17:09,210 --> 00:17:11,000
that I wanted to fix.

378
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:12,470
Those are little things,

379
00:17:12,470 --> 00:17:15,490
so I won't be going in details into it.

380
00:17:15,490 --> 00:17:20,340
I've just added a very small
additional bounce at the end

381
00:17:20,340 --> 00:17:24,930
and I've a bit revised the
z amplitude of my route

382
00:17:24,930 --> 00:17:28,990
so that the ball get a more even bouncing.

383
00:17:28,990 --> 00:17:31,240
So there is not much you will learn

384
00:17:31,240 --> 00:17:32,440
from the next step.

385
00:17:32,440 --> 00:17:35,630
I'm just refining some of the poses.

386
00:17:35,630 --> 00:17:37,910
I'm doing what we've
been doing just before,

387
00:17:37,910 --> 00:17:39,760
slightly revising the timing,

388
00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:42,430
the amplitude of the curve, et cetera.

389
00:17:42,430 --> 00:17:43,840
What you need to understand

390
00:17:43,840 --> 00:17:46,051
is that again, an animation

391
00:17:46,051 --> 00:17:50,470
is never finished until you say stop.

392
00:17:50,470 --> 00:17:53,290
And just work your animation

393
00:17:53,290 --> 00:17:56,210
until you get to a point of satisfaction.

394
00:17:56,210 --> 00:17:58,420
If you're struggling with the animation,

395
00:17:58,420 --> 00:17:59,990
start a new one.

396
00:17:59,990 --> 00:18:03,010
And this is the only
way you will progress.

397
00:18:03,010 --> 00:18:04,460
I've said this before

398
00:18:04,460 --> 00:18:07,420
and I will say it a lot of
time during this course,

399
00:18:07,420 --> 00:18:11,260
you need to animate to
become a good animator.

400
00:18:11,260 --> 00:18:15,490
You need to make this bouncing
ball exercise multiple time

401
00:18:15,490 --> 00:18:17,920
until you will get a good result.

402
00:18:17,920 --> 00:18:19,700
This is how it works.

403
00:18:19,700 --> 00:18:21,160
I am still struggling

404
00:18:21,160 --> 00:18:23,820
to get a good bouncing ball result

405
00:18:23,820 --> 00:18:26,490
after several years of animation.

406
00:18:26,490 --> 00:18:28,840
And to bring a character to life,

407
00:18:28,840 --> 00:18:30,890
to animate a character,

408
00:18:30,890 --> 00:18:32,842
you need to first be able

409
00:18:32,842 --> 00:18:37,272
to give it motion and then
you will input personality,

410
00:18:37,272 --> 00:18:42,090
input emotion but before
you input emotion,

411
00:18:42,090 --> 00:18:43,910
even into a bouncing ball,

412
00:18:43,910 --> 00:18:46,040
you need to learn motion.

413
00:18:46,040 --> 00:18:49,470
All right, enough of
philosophical discussion.

414
00:18:49,470 --> 00:18:51,833
Let's go ahead with the next video.
