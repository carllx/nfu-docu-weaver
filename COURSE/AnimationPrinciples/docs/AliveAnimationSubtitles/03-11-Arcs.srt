00:00:00,192 --> 00:00:02,190
- In this video, we will talk

2
00:00:02,190 --> 00:00:05,013
about another principle of animation.

3
00:00:05,013 --> 00:00:07,290
I haven't used the term before,

4
00:00:07,290 --> 00:00:10,360
but we have already used
arcs in our animations

5
00:00:10,360 --> 00:00:13,390
when we have done our
one single animation,

6
00:00:13,390 --> 00:00:16,440
and when we were tracking
the motion of the ball,

7
00:00:16,440 --> 00:00:19,970
we did our best to create
those beautiful curve

8
00:00:19,970 --> 00:00:22,860
in the motion, and those are arcs.

9
00:00:22,860 --> 00:00:25,120
And it does make sense, even for me,

10
00:00:25,120 --> 00:00:27,900
as an arc, in French, is a bow.

11
00:00:27,900 --> 00:00:30,480
But, I'm not sure it will
help for this course.

12
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:31,350
Let's go ahead.

13
00:00:31,350 --> 00:00:33,799
If you look around, most
of the things that move

14
00:00:33,799 --> 00:00:35,480
move in arcs.

15
00:00:35,480 --> 00:00:39,390
They kind of have a rotation-based motion

16
00:00:39,390 --> 00:00:42,520
and you will barely meet
situation where you want

17
00:00:42,520 --> 00:00:44,600
to animate straight lines

18
00:00:44,600 --> 00:00:46,860
like hydraulics or stuff like that.

19
00:00:46,860 --> 00:00:50,270
If I remove the arcs from
our one single animation,

20
00:00:50,270 --> 00:00:53,830
you can see that we absolutely
don't get the same results,

21
00:00:53,830 --> 00:00:54,910
the same feeling.

22
00:00:54,910 --> 00:00:57,430
It doesn't look natural at all.

23
00:00:57,430 --> 00:01:00,142
Let's have a look at a
little more complex animation

24
00:01:00,142 --> 00:01:04,170
and let's point out few
arcs in this animation.

25
00:01:04,170 --> 00:01:06,890
A common mistake for
beginners is to forget

26
00:01:06,890 --> 00:01:09,920
to input an arc in the head rotation.

27
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:13,430
But in most cases, it will
bring a bit more personality

28
00:01:13,430 --> 00:01:15,140
if you do it this way.

29
00:01:15,140 --> 00:01:17,170
Next step, if I track the hand,

30
00:01:17,170 --> 00:01:20,380
you can clearly see there is
a big arc on the left hand

31
00:01:20,380 --> 00:01:21,670
and the right hand.

32
00:01:21,670 --> 00:01:23,101
On this new head turn,

33
00:01:23,101 --> 00:01:28,010
look at how the arc
support the feeling of fear

34
00:01:28,010 --> 00:01:32,010
of our character not
understanding what happened

35
00:01:32,010 --> 00:01:34,410
and his back is pushing his head down

36
00:01:34,410 --> 00:01:37,000
between his shoulder while rotating.

37
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,840
On the next move, too,
arc is very important

38
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:41,208
and well-defined.

39
00:01:41,208 --> 00:01:44,730
And whatever part of the
character I am tracking,

40
00:01:44,730 --> 00:01:46,880
I will find those arcs,

41
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:49,195
whether it's the motion of the pelvis,

42
00:01:49,195 --> 00:01:50,960
the motion of the hands,

43
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:54,470
the motion of the head, the
feet, whatever you want.

44
00:01:54,470 --> 00:01:56,840
So arcs are almost everywhere

45
00:01:56,840 --> 00:02:00,350
and it's very important
to track them properly.

46
00:02:00,350 --> 00:02:02,100
That's why we really need

47
00:02:02,100 --> 00:02:07,100
to use the motion path tool of
Blender as often as possible.

48
00:02:07,510 --> 00:02:11,690
To summarize, we have seen
that most motion are done

49
00:02:11,690 --> 00:02:12,740
in arcs.

50
00:02:12,740 --> 00:02:16,020
You should avoid the
straight interpolation

51
00:02:16,020 --> 00:02:18,090
unless it is intentional.

52
00:02:18,090 --> 00:02:21,700
You should use the motion
path tool of Blender

53
00:02:21,700 --> 00:02:23,310
as often as possible.

54
00:02:23,310 --> 00:02:25,023
Track your arcs!
