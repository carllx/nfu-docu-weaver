00:00:00,980 --> 00:00:01,813
- [Instructor] In this video,

2
00:00:01,813 --> 00:00:05,690
we are going to work on
the body secondary motion

3
00:00:05,690 --> 00:00:07,500
using space switching.

4
00:00:07,500 --> 00:00:10,130
We will work where we have left before

5
00:00:10,130 --> 00:00:12,690
with our base body motion done.

6
00:00:12,690 --> 00:00:15,310
The hips are slightly rotating.

7
00:00:15,310 --> 00:00:18,070
We will start by working on the body part

8
00:00:18,070 --> 00:00:19,620
of the character.

9
00:00:19,620 --> 00:00:20,820
To help yourself,

10
00:00:20,820 --> 00:00:23,480
you can go into the armature option,

11
00:00:23,480 --> 00:00:28,480
viewport display and
display the names and axes.

12
00:00:28,580 --> 00:00:32,580
Screen controller axis will
help us kind of guessing

13
00:00:32,580 --> 00:00:36,920
which axis we need to use
when working with aim space.

14
00:00:36,920 --> 00:00:38,390
Let's press Control + Tab

15
00:00:38,390 --> 00:00:41,120
to switch back to object mode

16
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:45,210
and I will press then
Shift + A to add an empty.

17
00:00:45,210 --> 00:00:48,500
To make sure that we see
the empty whatsoever,

18
00:00:48,500 --> 00:00:52,450
we will go into the
object option of the empty

19
00:00:52,450 --> 00:00:55,200
and we will activate
in the viewport display

20
00:00:55,200 --> 00:00:57,160
the in front option.

21
00:00:57,160 --> 00:00:58,340
Finally, to be sure

22
00:00:58,340 --> 00:01:00,570
that we are not selecting
the different parts

23
00:01:00,570 --> 00:01:01,630
of the robot,

24
00:01:01,630 --> 00:01:03,800
we can disable the selectability

25
00:01:03,800 --> 00:01:06,870
by clicking the mouse cursor icon.

26
00:01:06,870 --> 00:01:08,410
If you can't find it,

27
00:01:08,410 --> 00:01:11,920
make sure that it's
enabled in the filter menu.

28
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:15,410
We will start by working
on the up and down motion

29
00:01:15,410 --> 00:01:16,610
of the body.

30
00:01:16,610 --> 00:01:18,600
So with my empty selected,

31
00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:21,930
I've added a copy location to it.

32
00:01:21,930 --> 00:01:25,400
The target will be our MECH Armature

33
00:01:25,400 --> 00:01:28,400
and the bone will be the body controller.

34
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:31,730
We can set the baking frame range directly

35
00:01:31,730 --> 00:01:33,110
during the baking.

36
00:01:33,110 --> 00:01:34,950
But to make our life easier,

37
00:01:34,950 --> 00:01:38,960
I will set the end of
the animation to frame 72

38
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:42,840
since our cycle goes from
frame zero to frame 72.

39
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:45,930
Then pressing Q to
access my quick favorite,

40
00:01:45,930 --> 00:01:48,360
I will choose bake action.

41
00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:51,010
You can access it by pressing F3

42
00:01:51,010 --> 00:01:52,837
and searching for bake

43
00:01:52,837 --> 00:01:55,140
and I advise you to
create a quick favorite

44
00:01:55,140 --> 00:01:58,050
since we will use this
command all the time.

45
00:01:58,050 --> 00:02:00,000
Enable visual keying,

46
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,130
clear constraint and press OK.

47
00:02:02,130 --> 00:02:06,170
Now we do have animation
that are for our empty

48
00:02:06,170 --> 00:02:08,183
following the motion of the body.

49
00:02:09,065 --> 00:02:10,670
With all its curves selected,

50
00:02:10,670 --> 00:02:13,620
I will press Shift + E and make it cycle.

51
00:02:13,620 --> 00:02:15,860
From there, we need to use this empty

52
00:02:15,860 --> 00:02:19,440
to constraint the body
controller of our robot.

53
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:20,960
Select the armature,

54
00:02:20,960 --> 00:02:23,570
go back into pose mode, select the bone,

55
00:02:23,570 --> 00:02:25,440
go into the bone constraint,

56
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:28,740
add a copy location and source the empty.

57
00:02:28,740 --> 00:02:30,720
Now I can get out of pose mode,

58
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:33,160
select the empty and when I move it,

59
00:02:33,160 --> 00:02:34,300
the body follow.

60
00:02:34,300 --> 00:02:35,770
In the graph editor,

61
00:02:35,770 --> 00:02:39,320
I will offset the animation by two frames.

62
00:02:39,320 --> 00:02:40,970
That should be enough.

63
00:02:40,970 --> 00:02:44,130
So now we get our follow-through animation

64
00:02:44,130 --> 00:02:45,250
of the body.

65
00:02:45,250 --> 00:02:46,960
While I like the timing,

66
00:02:46,960 --> 00:02:50,200
I feel that the motion is a bit extreme.

67
00:02:50,200 --> 00:02:52,700
So I can go back onto the armature,

68
00:02:52,700 --> 00:02:54,190
go into pose mode,

69
00:02:54,190 --> 00:02:58,160
tweak the influence of the
copy location constraint

70
00:02:58,160 --> 00:02:59,710
and cut it in half.

71
00:02:59,710 --> 00:03:02,830
This way we keep our
follow-through animation

72
00:03:02,830 --> 00:03:05,100
but with less influence,

73
00:03:05,100 --> 00:03:08,380
meaning that we have less
amplitude in the motion.

74
00:03:08,380 --> 00:03:10,090
So it's a matter of tweaking

75
00:03:10,090 --> 00:03:13,740
and testing whatever
value fits your animation.

76
00:03:13,740 --> 00:03:16,790
When I'm happy with the
motion, I will bake it.

77
00:03:16,790 --> 00:03:19,840
With my bone selected,
I've pressed the Q key

78
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:21,570
to access my quick favorite

79
00:03:21,570 --> 00:03:23,980
and choose bake action

80
00:03:23,980 --> 00:03:27,220
and I will check the
Override Current Action.

81
00:03:27,220 --> 00:03:29,970
The body controller is
no longer a constraint

82
00:03:29,970 --> 00:03:33,280
but it has written all
the keyframes needed

83
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:35,230
to have the same animation.

84
00:03:35,230 --> 00:03:37,110
We will now use aim space

85
00:03:37,110 --> 00:03:40,130
to add a bit of rotation to the body.

86
00:03:40,130 --> 00:03:43,100
First, we need to align the empty

87
00:03:43,100 --> 00:03:44,960
to the body controller.

88
00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:48,780
To do so, you can get rid of
the current animation curve

89
00:03:48,780 --> 00:03:50,740
but it's not mandatory.

90
00:03:50,740 --> 00:03:54,280
What we need to so is
to add a copy transform,

91
00:03:54,280 --> 00:03:55,970
source the armature

92
00:03:55,970 --> 00:03:58,740
and source our body controller.

93
00:03:58,740 --> 00:04:00,340
Then in the 3D view,

94
00:04:00,340 --> 00:04:02,240
we will press Control + A

95
00:04:02,240 --> 00:04:05,210
and apply the visual transform.

96
00:04:05,210 --> 00:04:07,690
From there, we can get
rid of the constraint.

97
00:04:07,690 --> 00:04:10,250
We now need to offset the empty.

98
00:04:10,250 --> 00:04:13,127
So I will use the local space axis

99
00:04:13,127 --> 00:04:16,940
and as you can see, I need to move forward

100
00:04:16,940 --> 00:04:19,010
onto the y-axis.

101
00:04:19,010 --> 00:04:21,460
The further you will move the empty,

102
00:04:21,460 --> 00:04:23,560
the less influence it will have

103
00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:27,440
because we are using
location to drive a rotation.

104
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:30,650
So for a given up and down motion,

105
00:04:30,650 --> 00:04:34,500
the further I am, the
less rotation I will get.

106
00:04:34,500 --> 00:04:37,370
So this is something you
will have to play with

107
00:04:37,370 --> 00:04:38,750
to get used to.

108
00:04:38,750 --> 00:04:40,380
In our specific case,

109
00:04:40,380 --> 00:04:44,630
we don't really care since
we can move the empty

110
00:04:44,630 --> 00:04:47,270
after we have baked its motion.

111
00:04:47,270 --> 00:04:51,560
But to bake it, we need to
make it a child of the body.

112
00:04:51,560 --> 00:04:55,160
So I will add to it a child of constraint,

113
00:04:55,160 --> 00:04:57,400
source the armature,

114
00:04:57,400 --> 00:04:59,610
then source the body bone,

115
00:04:59,610 --> 00:05:04,330
click the set inverse option
to reset its position.

116
00:05:04,330 --> 00:05:06,137
It now follows the body

117
00:05:06,137 --> 00:05:09,770
and I can press Q to bake the action.

118
00:05:09,770 --> 00:05:12,250
From there, I can select all the curve,

119
00:05:12,250 --> 00:05:15,050
press Shift + E and make cycle.

120
00:05:15,050 --> 00:05:16,050
For the time being,

121
00:05:16,050 --> 00:05:19,290
I will only display the Z location curve

122
00:05:19,290 --> 00:05:23,220
and I will jump onto the
controller of my body,

123
00:05:23,220 --> 00:05:25,560
go to the bone constraint

124
00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:28,530
and add a dump truck constraint.

125
00:05:28,530 --> 00:05:30,950
As a target, we will source the empty

126
00:05:30,950 --> 00:05:32,920
and we can see the body flipped

127
00:05:32,920 --> 00:05:34,680
and that's perfectly normal

128
00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:38,320
since the y-axis is pointing backward

129
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:40,480
in its positive direction.

130
00:05:40,480 --> 00:05:42,560
To fix this, we simply need

131
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:46,540
to choose the minus y-axis as the track.

132
00:05:46,540 --> 00:05:48,480
I can now press Control + Tab

133
00:05:48,480 --> 00:05:51,010
to get back into object mode,

134
00:05:51,010 --> 00:05:55,530
select the empty and
play with the z curve,

135
00:05:55,530 --> 00:05:57,730
so I will frame the curve

136
00:05:57,730 --> 00:06:01,990
and I will offset it
by two to three frame.

137
00:06:01,990 --> 00:06:04,162
And we now get a bit of rotation

138
00:06:04,162 --> 00:06:06,830
in our follow-through motion

139
00:06:06,830 --> 00:06:08,620
and that's very cool.

140
00:06:08,620 --> 00:06:10,270
What will be nice too

141
00:06:10,270 --> 00:06:14,130
is to add a bit of side-to-side motion.

142
00:06:14,130 --> 00:06:17,950
So I will head up to the x location curve

143
00:06:17,950 --> 00:06:21,390
and I will offset it by only one frame

144
00:06:21,390 --> 00:06:23,650
to keep it very subtle.

145
00:06:23,650 --> 00:06:25,860
Again, it's a creative process.

146
00:06:25,860 --> 00:06:28,620
If you want more left-to-right motion,

147
00:06:28,620 --> 00:06:32,080
it's up to you to increase
the offset of the curve.

148
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:35,270
But since the weapon are
attached to the body,

149
00:06:35,270 --> 00:06:40,270
I feel like we may not input
too much left to right motion.

150
00:06:40,440 --> 00:06:44,760
So from there, I can bake
the action on the body.

151
00:06:44,760 --> 00:06:45,840
For the time being,

152
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:48,230
then I will always create keyframes

153
00:06:48,230 --> 00:06:50,280
on all the transformed channels,

154
00:06:50,280 --> 00:06:53,530
including the scale that we don't use.

155
00:06:53,530 --> 00:06:55,670
So we can get rid of those.

156
00:06:55,670 --> 00:06:58,500
I'm pretty happy with
the body motion results,

157
00:06:58,500 --> 00:07:01,190
so I will now work on the hips.

158
00:07:01,190 --> 00:07:04,100
We have already animated
it a bit previously

159
00:07:04,100 --> 00:07:06,790
but now I'd like to add a bit

160
00:07:06,790 --> 00:07:09,420
of follow-through in its location

161
00:07:09,420 --> 00:07:13,150
and also in its up and down rotation.

162
00:07:13,150 --> 00:07:14,623
Let's repeat the process.

163
00:07:14,623 --> 00:07:16,720
With the empty selected,

164
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:20,475
I will go to the constraint
and add the copy location.

165
00:07:20,475 --> 00:07:23,800
I will source as the target the armature

166
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:26,580
and as the bone, the hips bone.

167
00:07:26,580 --> 00:07:30,940
If you can't find it, it's
just further down in the list.

168
00:07:30,940 --> 00:07:34,540
From there, we can press Q
to access our quick favorite

169
00:07:34,540 --> 00:07:37,750
and bake the action of the empty.

170
00:07:37,750 --> 00:07:39,800
Then select back the armature,

171
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:43,660
go into pose mode and with
the hips bone selected,

172
00:07:43,660 --> 00:07:45,380
go to the bone constraint

173
00:07:45,380 --> 00:07:48,690
and add a copy location constraint

174
00:07:48,690 --> 00:07:50,490
and source the empty.

175
00:07:50,490 --> 00:07:52,880
From there, let's exit pose mode

176
00:07:52,880 --> 00:07:54,440
by pressing Control + Tab,

177
00:07:54,440 --> 00:07:57,490
select DMT, select all its curve,

178
00:07:57,490 --> 00:08:00,300
press Shift + E to make it cycle

179
00:08:00,300 --> 00:08:03,510
and now I can select the Z location curve

180
00:08:03,510 --> 00:08:06,450
by isolating the other ones.

181
00:08:06,450 --> 00:08:09,810
And just offset it by a couple of frames.

182
00:08:09,810 --> 00:08:13,780
Now again it's a matter
of taste and choice.

183
00:08:13,780 --> 00:08:15,710
I feel like the amplitude

184
00:08:15,710 --> 00:08:19,240
of the up and down motion
is a bit too extreme,

185
00:08:19,240 --> 00:08:22,640
so I will get back onto the hips bone

186
00:08:22,640 --> 00:08:24,760
by selecting the armature,

187
00:08:24,760 --> 00:08:26,668
going back into pose mode

188
00:08:26,668 --> 00:08:29,000
and in the constraint panel,

189
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,050
I will reduce the influence to 0.5

190
00:08:32,190 --> 00:08:34,300
and double check how it looks.

191
00:08:34,300 --> 00:08:36,520
I will test at 0.5

192
00:08:36,520 --> 00:08:39,320
and then increase it a bit around 0.6

193
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:43,430
and since I'm quite happy with the result,

194
00:08:43,430 --> 00:08:45,300
I will bake the action

195
00:08:45,300 --> 00:08:47,800
by pressing Q, bake action

196
00:08:47,800 --> 00:08:50,570
and overwrite current action.

197
00:08:50,570 --> 00:08:53,370
We can now refine the
rotation of the hips.

198
00:08:53,370 --> 00:08:55,697
So I will go back to the empty

199
00:08:55,697 --> 00:08:59,494
and hide all the curve
and get rid of them.

200
00:08:59,494 --> 00:09:03,518
Add onto it a copy transform constraint

201
00:09:03,518 --> 00:09:05,590
and then in the 3D view,

202
00:09:05,590 --> 00:09:08,010
I will press Control + A

203
00:09:08,010 --> 00:09:11,910
and apply the visual transform.

204
00:09:11,910 --> 00:09:13,210
We can see that the hips

205
00:09:13,210 --> 00:09:17,036
are pointing forward
on their local y-axis.

206
00:09:17,036 --> 00:09:20,310
So I will move the empty on the y-axis

207
00:09:20,310 --> 00:09:23,130
but first, we need to
remove the constraint.

208
00:09:23,130 --> 00:09:26,700
If you want, you can also
enable the axis display

209
00:09:26,700 --> 00:09:28,150
of the empty.

210
00:09:28,150 --> 00:09:31,600
That should help you to
figure on which axis you have

211
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:32,700
to offset it

212
00:09:32,700 --> 00:09:35,420
but again, it's the y-axis.

213
00:09:35,420 --> 00:09:38,500
We now need to make it
a child of the hips,

214
00:09:38,500 --> 00:09:40,210
so we will go to the constraint,

215
00:09:40,210 --> 00:09:41,980
add a child of constraint,

216
00:09:41,980 --> 00:09:45,350
source the armature, source the hips bone

217
00:09:45,350 --> 00:09:48,980
and don't forget to click
the set inverse button

218
00:09:48,980 --> 00:09:50,750
to reset its position.

219
00:09:50,750 --> 00:09:53,410
Then we can bake its action

220
00:09:53,410 --> 00:09:56,660
and with all the curves
selected, press Shift + E

221
00:09:56,660 --> 00:09:58,490
and choose make cycle.

222
00:09:58,490 --> 00:10:00,710
I will now use a tracking constraint

223
00:10:00,710 --> 00:10:02,460
to make the hips rotating

224
00:10:02,460 --> 00:10:05,400
but since we have already animated them,

225
00:10:05,400 --> 00:10:07,730
rotating from side to side,

226
00:10:07,730 --> 00:10:10,650
instead of a dump truck constraint,

227
00:10:10,650 --> 00:10:13,360
we will use a locked try constraint

228
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:16,770
and rotate around the x-axis of the hips.

229
00:10:16,770 --> 00:10:17,930
With the rig selected,

230
00:10:17,930 --> 00:10:20,020
I will get back into pose mode,

231
00:10:20,020 --> 00:10:23,760
select the hips, go to the bone constraint

232
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:26,560
and add a locked track constraint.

233
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:29,370
I will source as a target the empty

234
00:10:29,370 --> 00:10:32,420
and we want to point on the -y-axis

235
00:10:32,420 --> 00:10:35,660
and rotate around the x-axis.

236
00:10:35,660 --> 00:10:38,970
With this constraint, we
will only have the rotation

237
00:10:38,970 --> 00:10:41,970
around the local x-axis of the hips,

238
00:10:41,970 --> 00:10:44,120
the up and down rotation.

239
00:10:44,120 --> 00:10:45,860
We can go back to object mode

240
00:10:45,860 --> 00:10:47,570
and select the empty

241
00:10:47,570 --> 00:10:51,560
and offset the Z location
curve of the empty.

242
00:10:51,560 --> 00:10:54,159
This will create a slight
follow-through animation

243
00:10:54,159 --> 00:10:56,070
of the hips.

244
00:10:56,070 --> 00:10:59,530
I've used a 223 frame of offset.

245
00:10:59,530 --> 00:11:02,310
As usual, you can choose
the offset you want.

246
00:11:02,310 --> 00:11:04,840
You can choose the influence you want

247
00:11:04,840 --> 00:11:06,890
and then just press Q

248
00:11:06,890 --> 00:11:10,130
and bake the action onto the hips.

249
00:11:10,130 --> 00:11:13,240
As I'm done, I will get
rid of the scale keyframe

250
00:11:13,240 --> 00:11:15,090
because we don't need them.

251
00:11:15,090 --> 00:11:17,453
From there, let's move onto the head.

252
00:11:19,330 --> 00:11:22,440
We will repeat exactly the same workflow.

253
00:11:22,440 --> 00:11:26,530
First, select the empty,
get rid of all the curves.

254
00:11:26,530 --> 00:11:30,173
Then add to it a copy location constraint,

255
00:11:30,173 --> 00:11:34,490
source the armature, then
source the head controller.

256
00:11:34,490 --> 00:11:38,950
Then press Q and bake
the action on the empty.

257
00:11:38,950 --> 00:11:42,670
Then go back onto the armature.

258
00:11:42,670 --> 00:11:44,670
Select the head controller.

259
00:11:44,670 --> 00:11:46,800
Go to the bone constraint,

260
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:50,030
add a copy location, source the empty,

261
00:11:50,030 --> 00:11:52,130
go back onto the empty,

262
00:11:52,130 --> 00:11:54,120
make all the curves cycling

263
00:11:54,120 --> 00:11:57,840
by pressing Shift + E, make cycle

264
00:11:57,840 --> 00:11:59,770
and then you can offset the curve

265
00:11:59,770 --> 00:12:02,020
to get the follow-through motion.

266
00:12:02,020 --> 00:12:04,020
So in the case of the head,

267
00:12:04,020 --> 00:12:07,950
I prefer to offset the z-axis only

268
00:12:07,950 --> 00:12:12,100
because I don't want to create
too much left to right swivel

269
00:12:12,100 --> 00:12:13,510
of the head.

270
00:12:13,510 --> 00:12:17,180
So I will reset the offset of the curve,

271
00:12:17,180 --> 00:12:20,090
then select only the Z curve

272
00:12:20,090 --> 00:12:25,090
and offset it by two or
three frame later in time.

273
00:12:25,220 --> 00:12:28,930
Then I will select the x location curve

274
00:12:28,930 --> 00:12:31,770
and I will offset it by only one frame

275
00:12:31,770 --> 00:12:35,020
to get a bit of delay
or follow-through motion

276
00:12:35,020 --> 00:12:37,470
on the left to right axis

277
00:12:37,470 --> 00:12:41,380
but not as important as the up and down.

278
00:12:41,380 --> 00:12:45,110
Try not to overdo all
those follow-through motion

279
00:12:45,110 --> 00:12:48,640
or your robot will
really look very clanky.

280
00:12:48,640 --> 00:12:51,010
So it might be a look you are aiming for

281
00:12:51,010 --> 00:12:52,930
but if you want to make it robust,

282
00:12:52,930 --> 00:12:55,550
don't overdo all those
follow-through motion.

283
00:12:55,550 --> 00:12:59,300
When I'm happy with the
timing of this follow-through,

284
00:12:59,300 --> 00:13:02,450
I can play with the
influence of the constraint

285
00:13:02,450 --> 00:13:05,930
to reduce the amplitude of the motion.

286
00:13:05,930 --> 00:13:10,850
So it seems I was happy
with an influence of 0.6

287
00:13:10,850 --> 00:13:12,680
for the head motion.

288
00:13:12,680 --> 00:13:17,080
So from there, I will get into pose mode

289
00:13:17,080 --> 00:13:20,210
and press Q to bake the action

290
00:13:20,210 --> 00:13:22,500
of the copy location constraint

291
00:13:22,500 --> 00:13:24,080
onto the head bone.

292
00:13:24,080 --> 00:13:26,710
Now, we will switch to aim space

293
00:13:26,710 --> 00:13:28,640
to add a bit of rotation.

294
00:13:28,640 --> 00:13:30,920
So I will select the empty,

295
00:13:30,920 --> 00:13:33,090
get rid of all the curves,

296
00:13:33,090 --> 00:13:36,290
add a copy transform constraint.

297
00:13:36,290 --> 00:13:39,130
As a target, I will choose the armature

298
00:13:39,130 --> 00:13:41,000
and the head bone.

299
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:42,190
Then in the 3D view,

300
00:13:42,190 --> 00:13:45,710
I will press Control + A
and choose visual transform.

301
00:13:45,710 --> 00:13:47,840
Get rid of the constraint.

302
00:13:47,840 --> 00:13:50,930
Offset the empty on the y-axis.

303
00:13:50,930 --> 00:13:55,120
Then we need to add to
it a child of constraint.

304
00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:57,737
So I will select it, go to the constraint,

305
00:13:57,737 --> 00:14:01,750
add the child of, source again our rig,

306
00:14:01,750 --> 00:14:03,950
the head bone controller.

307
00:14:03,950 --> 00:14:06,420
Set inverse to reset its position

308
00:14:06,420 --> 00:14:08,900
and bake the action of the empty.

309
00:14:08,900 --> 00:14:12,320
Now the empty's following
the motion of the head.

310
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:14,157
Now we can select the head,

311
00:14:14,157 --> 00:14:17,290
add a dump truck constraint,

312
00:14:17,290 --> 00:14:18,940
source the empty

313
00:14:18,940 --> 00:14:22,000
and then flip the bone constraint

314
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,820
to the -y-axis.

315
00:14:24,820 --> 00:14:27,360
I will select back the empty,

316
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:29,130
make all the curve cycle

317
00:14:29,130 --> 00:14:32,050
and isolate the Z location curve.

318
00:14:32,050 --> 00:14:34,710
I will offset it by four frame

319
00:14:34,710 --> 00:14:38,040
to get enough amplitude of motion

320
00:14:38,040 --> 00:14:39,970
but now what I'd like to do

321
00:14:39,970 --> 00:14:41,820
is to smooth the curve.

322
00:14:41,820 --> 00:14:45,150
We will have a smoother
rotation of the head

323
00:14:45,150 --> 00:14:47,460
that will looks way heavier

324
00:14:47,460 --> 00:14:51,520
but will also make the
robot look more robust.

325
00:14:51,520 --> 00:14:54,630
If you want to have more
amplitude in the motion,

326
00:14:54,630 --> 00:14:59,570
what you can do is switch
the curve editing pivot point

327
00:14:59,570 --> 00:15:04,570
to bounding box and
scale it on the y-axis.

328
00:15:04,760 --> 00:15:07,980
This will slightly increase
the up and down motion

329
00:15:07,980 --> 00:15:11,770
of the empty and the rotation of the head.

330
00:15:11,770 --> 00:15:15,810
Now I will try to spot these
little bounds in the curve.

331
00:15:15,810 --> 00:15:18,230
You can then duplicate one of the keys

332
00:15:18,230 --> 00:15:20,490
or add a key manually

333
00:15:20,490 --> 00:15:22,410
and to get a smooth result,

334
00:15:22,410 --> 00:15:24,770
I will select all the keys,

335
00:15:24,770 --> 00:15:28,380
press V to set them to auto clamped.

336
00:15:28,380 --> 00:15:32,180
From there, it will be pretty
easy to smooth the curve.

337
00:15:32,180 --> 00:15:35,650
We just need to get rid
of some of the keys.

338
00:15:35,650 --> 00:15:38,560
Just keep the keys that
are on the extreme.

339
00:15:38,560 --> 00:15:42,760
Since our handle are
all set to auto clamped,

340
00:15:42,760 --> 00:15:45,520
whenever we get rid of a keyframe,

341
00:15:45,520 --> 00:15:48,520
Blender will automatically
try to keep the curve

342
00:15:48,520 --> 00:15:50,640
as smooth as possible

343
00:15:50,640 --> 00:15:53,493
without changing the extreme values.

344
00:15:53,493 --> 00:15:56,900
So from there, you can
try to simplify the curve.

345
00:15:56,900 --> 00:16:00,350
You can edit it, moving
the keys a little lower

346
00:16:00,350 --> 00:16:04,160
or a little higher if you
want a bit more motion.

347
00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:08,420
Just make sure that the
curve cycle on 72 frame,

348
00:16:08,420 --> 00:16:09,970
meaning that the very first

349
00:16:09,970 --> 00:16:12,930
and very last keys must be the same

350
00:16:12,930 --> 00:16:14,890
and don't be afraid to fail.

351
00:16:14,890 --> 00:16:18,268
If you fail, you just
need to rebake the curve.

352
00:16:18,268 --> 00:16:19,980
So with this process,

353
00:16:19,980 --> 00:16:22,531
you can be very creative for free.

354
00:16:22,531 --> 00:16:24,740
So from there, what I wanted

355
00:16:24,740 --> 00:16:29,150
is just to add a very
subtle left to right motion.

356
00:16:29,150 --> 00:16:32,420
So I've slightly offset
the X location curve

357
00:16:32,420 --> 00:16:34,500
of the empty so that the head

358
00:16:34,500 --> 00:16:36,970
is dragging a bit left to right.

359
00:16:36,970 --> 00:16:40,030
I used like one or two frame offset.

360
00:16:40,030 --> 00:16:41,990
When you're happy with the result,

361
00:16:41,990 --> 00:16:45,350
as usual, select back the armature,

362
00:16:45,350 --> 00:16:46,837
go back into pose mode

363
00:16:46,837 --> 00:16:49,359
and with the head bone selected,

364
00:16:49,359 --> 00:16:51,790
just bake the action

365
00:16:51,790 --> 00:16:54,110
and then clean any keyframes

366
00:16:54,110 --> 00:16:58,750
that is unwanted, like on the
scale channel, for example.

367
00:16:58,750 --> 00:17:00,750
I hope you're getting more familiar

368
00:17:00,750 --> 00:17:03,010
with the space switching process.

369
00:17:03,010 --> 00:17:06,830
In the next video, we will
do all the remaining pieces

370
00:17:06,830 --> 00:17:08,533
of the robot the same way.
