00:00:00,420 --> 00:00:02,410
- [Instructor] The last animation we need

2
00:00:02,410 --> 00:00:05,810
to complete our squirrel sequence

3
00:00:05,810 --> 00:00:07,930
is the climbing animation.

4
00:00:07,930 --> 00:00:09,510
I've already explain you

5
00:00:09,510 --> 00:00:12,530
that studying reference was very important

6
00:00:12,530 --> 00:00:15,640
and I found two nice references

7
00:00:15,640 --> 00:00:17,300
for this animation.

8
00:00:17,300 --> 00:00:19,700
And to be honest while studying them,

9
00:00:19,700 --> 00:00:21,140
I was really surprised

10
00:00:21,140 --> 00:00:25,360
on how the squirrel
move while its climbing.

11
00:00:25,360 --> 00:00:27,970
If I was to do it without reference

12
00:00:27,970 --> 00:00:31,280
I would have not done it right for sure.

13
00:00:31,280 --> 00:00:32,960
When studying reference,

14
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:36,290
it's better to study each part separately.

15
00:00:36,290 --> 00:00:39,720
I will start with the
silhouette of our character.

16
00:00:39,720 --> 00:00:41,670
And I will try to draw

17
00:00:41,670 --> 00:00:44,030
the hips, chest and head.

18
00:00:44,030 --> 00:00:46,850
Whether it's the squirrel character

19
00:00:46,850 --> 00:00:48,850
or a human character.

20
00:00:48,850 --> 00:00:50,680
It's very important

21
00:00:50,680 --> 00:00:53,030
to check out the position

22
00:00:53,030 --> 00:00:54,410
between the hips and chest

23
00:00:54,410 --> 00:00:56,150
and chest and head.

24
00:00:56,150 --> 00:00:58,590
Look at how during the motion,

25
00:00:58,590 --> 00:01:02,820
the hips, chest and head gets aligned

26
00:01:02,820 --> 00:01:06,220
and how the space or the distance

27
00:01:06,220 --> 00:01:09,430
between each features is growing.

28
00:01:09,430 --> 00:01:11,530
The whole body of the character

29
00:01:11,530 --> 00:01:13,926
is stretching toward the next part.

30
00:01:13,926 --> 00:01:14,759
(wind howling)

31
00:01:14,759 --> 00:01:16,180
The next thing you can do

32
00:01:16,180 --> 00:01:19,770
to help you read the
shape of the character,

33
00:01:19,770 --> 00:01:22,990
is draw what we call the line of action.

34
00:01:22,990 --> 00:01:24,650
We will have a deeper look

35
00:01:24,650 --> 00:01:27,130
to what line of action is

36
00:01:27,130 --> 00:01:29,630
in the mastering pose chapter,

37
00:01:29,630 --> 00:01:30,920
but for the time being,

38
00:01:30,920 --> 00:01:33,140
just think of a curve

39
00:01:33,140 --> 00:01:34,500
that connects the head,

40
00:01:34,500 --> 00:01:36,730
the chest and the hips

41
00:01:36,730 --> 00:01:41,140
and that define simplified
version of the curvature

42
00:01:41,140 --> 00:01:43,160
of the body of your character.

43
00:01:43,160 --> 00:01:45,890
This is the most simplified version

44
00:01:45,890 --> 00:01:47,340
of the shape of the body.

45
00:01:47,340 --> 00:01:50,000
That we're going to create.

46
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,620
It's really fascinating

47
00:01:51,620 --> 00:01:54,090
to see how we start with an s-shape

48
00:01:54,090 --> 00:01:56,650
and how it gets stretched

49
00:01:56,650 --> 00:01:58,680
and get back to this s-shape.

50
00:01:58,680 --> 00:01:59,513
(wind howling)

51
00:01:59,513 --> 00:02:01,790
The next step is to track the hands

52
00:02:01,790 --> 00:02:03,910
and the feet of the character.

53
00:02:03,910 --> 00:02:06,980
While the shape is not that surprising,

54
00:02:06,980 --> 00:02:09,540
the thing is that I don't know when

55
00:02:09,540 --> 00:02:11,380
the feet are contacting,

56
00:02:11,380 --> 00:02:13,260
compared to the hands,

57
00:02:13,260 --> 00:02:16,030
and this is why I'm
tracking those elements.

58
00:02:16,030 --> 00:02:19,340
I'm trying to figure when
they take off the trunk

59
00:02:19,340 --> 00:02:22,030
and when they contact again with it.

60
00:02:22,030 --> 00:02:23,490
And we can see that the ends

61
00:02:23,490 --> 00:02:26,940
of the character take off very early on,

62
00:02:26,940 --> 00:02:29,560
while the feet stays in contact.

63
00:02:29,560 --> 00:02:31,910
There is a moment where our character

64
00:02:31,910 --> 00:02:33,490
is totally our bones.

65
00:02:33,490 --> 00:02:36,270
So it means that he's jumping

66
00:02:36,270 --> 00:02:38,880
and then the hand and the feet

67
00:02:38,880 --> 00:02:43,013
have like one frame offset or the contact.

68
00:02:43,970 --> 00:02:47,410
If I quickly do the same
with the second reference

69
00:02:47,410 --> 00:02:49,950
you will find a link to the YouTube video

70
00:02:49,950 --> 00:02:51,520
in the documentation.

71
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:53,540
The behavior of the character

72
00:02:53,540 --> 00:02:57,430
is pretty close to what we
had on the first reference,

73
00:02:57,430 --> 00:02:59,930
the front legs or hands,

74
00:02:59,930 --> 00:03:03,100
are taking off very early on

75
00:03:03,100 --> 00:03:06,520
while the feet are still
in contact with the trunk.

76
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:07,670
The main difference

77
00:03:07,670 --> 00:03:09,850
compared to the previous reference

78
00:03:09,850 --> 00:03:12,530
is the timing of the contact pose.

79
00:03:12,530 --> 00:03:13,920
On this reference,

80
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:15,590
both the ends and the feet

81
00:03:15,590 --> 00:03:17,674
seems to contact at the same time.

82
00:03:17,674 --> 00:03:18,507
(wind howling)

83
00:03:18,507 --> 00:03:20,600
The next thing I wanted to check

84
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:23,290
was the spacing of the hips

85
00:03:23,290 --> 00:03:25,520
and the spacing of the head.

86
00:03:25,520 --> 00:03:29,080
So I've tried to pound a point on the hips

87
00:03:29,080 --> 00:03:30,660
that allow me to track them.

88
00:03:30,660 --> 00:03:32,840
There was a different of color

89
00:03:32,840 --> 00:03:34,910
in the fur of the character

90
00:03:34,910 --> 00:03:36,130
and to track the head,

91
00:03:36,130 --> 00:03:39,586
I've simply tracked the
eyes of the character

92
00:03:39,586 --> 00:03:40,930
and we can really see

93
00:03:40,930 --> 00:03:43,790
that the head is going very fast

94
00:03:43,790 --> 00:03:46,240
in the beginning and stops,

95
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:47,940
and then the hips catch up.

96
00:03:47,940 --> 00:03:50,240
So there will be quite of a difference

97
00:03:50,240 --> 00:03:52,300
between the hazing of the hips

98
00:03:52,300 --> 00:03:54,509
and the hazing of the head position.

99
00:03:54,509 --> 00:03:55,342
(wind howling)

100
00:03:55,342 --> 00:03:58,280
The last thing I've
checked was the distance

101
00:03:58,280 --> 00:04:00,490
between the chest of the character

102
00:04:00,490 --> 00:04:01,920
and the tree trunk.

103
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:04,010
And it's pretty surprising,

104
00:04:04,010 --> 00:04:07,100
as the character is pushing forward,

105
00:04:07,100 --> 00:04:10,900
his chest is getting
closer to the tree trunk.

106
00:04:10,900 --> 00:04:13,180
This isn't something I would have guessed

107
00:04:13,180 --> 00:04:16,970
because when you are
used to make run cycle,

108
00:04:16,970 --> 00:04:19,590
you tend to push your character

109
00:04:19,590 --> 00:04:21,580
away from the ground,

110
00:04:21,580 --> 00:04:23,560
while he's pushing on his leg

111
00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:25,120
to move forward.

112
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:28,920
While here as the character is pushing on

113
00:04:28,920 --> 00:04:31,820
his legs is getting closer and closer

114
00:04:31,820 --> 00:04:33,050
to the tree trunk.

115
00:04:33,050 --> 00:04:35,510
And as you get in contact

116
00:04:35,510 --> 00:04:36,850
with the tree trunk

117
00:04:36,850 --> 00:04:39,840
is slightly get away from it.

118
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:41,790
And that's a major difference

119
00:04:41,790 --> 00:04:43,990
compared to a run cycle.

120
00:04:43,990 --> 00:04:45,843
Let's block this animation.
