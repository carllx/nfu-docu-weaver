1
00:00:00,230 --> 00:00:01,110
- In this video,

2
00:00:01,110 --> 00:00:03,720
we will start planning our animation.

3
00:00:03,720 --> 00:00:07,470
Starting by polishing the up
and down of the torso root.

4
00:00:07,470 --> 00:00:09,570
And then the feet motion.

5
00:00:09,570 --> 00:00:13,080
The first obvious step
is to go into pause mode

6
00:00:13,080 --> 00:00:14,150
into our rig.

7
00:00:14,150 --> 00:00:15,930
Select all our keys,

8
00:00:15,930 --> 00:00:20,030
press the T key and switch
to busy interpolation.

9
00:00:20,030 --> 00:00:22,480
You can switch between the action editor

10
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:25,130
and the graph editor
by pressing control tab

11
00:00:25,130 --> 00:00:28,280
and we to make sure all
the curves are exposed

12
00:00:28,280 --> 00:00:31,130
by clicking on the show hidden option.

13
00:00:31,130 --> 00:00:34,050
You may also press Alt + H to make sure

14
00:00:34,050 --> 00:00:37,900
that there is no curves
that is manually hidden.

15
00:00:37,900 --> 00:00:38,733
From there,

16
00:00:38,733 --> 00:00:41,060
I will press eight to select all the curve

17
00:00:41,060 --> 00:00:46,060
and then press Shift + E
and choose make cyclic.

18
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:49,600
Now all of our curve get this modifier

19
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:53,800
and our whole animation will
be cycling in time infinitely.

20
00:00:53,800 --> 00:00:57,420
I often start polishing
my animation with the feet

21
00:00:57,420 --> 00:01:00,410
and go back and forth with the torso.

22
00:01:00,410 --> 00:01:01,360
In this case,

23
00:01:01,360 --> 00:01:04,320
we will start by polishing the Z location

24
00:01:04,320 --> 00:01:06,030
of the torsal roots.

25
00:01:06,030 --> 00:01:09,480
This is the most important
channel during a run cycle.

26
00:01:09,480 --> 00:01:11,210
The up and down motion.

27
00:01:11,210 --> 00:01:13,210
If we know playing our animation,

28
00:01:13,210 --> 00:01:15,780
we are no longer in step mode

29
00:01:15,780 --> 00:01:17,760
and while there are some glitches,

30
00:01:17,760 --> 00:01:19,310
it doesn't look that bad.

31
00:01:19,310 --> 00:01:21,890
Here is our current Z curve

32
00:01:21,890 --> 00:01:24,350
and here is what we are
going to do with it.

33
00:01:24,350 --> 00:01:28,510
The idea is to bring
contrast to our up and down

34
00:01:28,510 --> 00:01:33,220
or a heavy character you
will, favorize the down pose

35
00:01:33,220 --> 00:01:36,600
for a light energized character like ours,

36
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:39,920
You will favorize the up pose meaning that

37
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:43,820
we will hold our character
in the air little bit.

38
00:01:43,820 --> 00:01:46,840
The idea is to bring
contrast to the motion.

39
00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:51,460
So we will, I have a slight
plateau in the top position

40
00:01:51,460 --> 00:01:55,430
and then a fast down
pose with a fast bounce,

41
00:01:55,430 --> 00:01:59,440
meaning that the curve
will rapidly get back

42
00:01:59,440 --> 00:02:01,390
to its up position.

43
00:02:01,390 --> 00:02:03,040
You really have to focus on

44
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:05,450
the up and down motion of your character

45
00:02:05,450 --> 00:02:09,660
and if needed you can hide
the legs and the arms.

46
00:02:09,660 --> 00:02:12,860
Since our character is
bouncing twice during

47
00:02:12,860 --> 00:02:15,473
the 24 frame of its cycle,

48
00:02:15,473 --> 00:02:18,820
I have refined the keys from zero to 12

49
00:02:18,820 --> 00:02:22,930
and then duplicated those
keys from zero to 12

50
00:02:22,930 --> 00:02:25,030
onto 12 to 24.

51
00:02:25,030 --> 00:02:27,210
Then I can trade off any keys

52
00:02:27,210 --> 00:02:29,850
that were remaining previously.

53
00:02:29,850 --> 00:02:34,080
This way the base up and down
motion of my root is done

54
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:36,920
and I can switch to the feet motion

55
00:02:36,920 --> 00:02:41,010
as explained many times animation
is not a linear workflow.

56
00:02:41,010 --> 00:02:44,670
So we will probably have to
get back to the root motion

57
00:02:44,670 --> 00:02:48,400
and switch between route
and feet, root and torso,

58
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:49,500
et cetera.

59
00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:54,070
This up and down motion is
mostly put upon a feeling,

60
00:02:54,070 --> 00:02:57,320
but I've shaped it so that my character

61
00:02:57,320 --> 00:02:59,500
is holding a bit in here.

62
00:02:59,500 --> 00:03:04,060
And the speed at which he's
going down and going up

63
00:03:04,060 --> 00:03:06,090
is not exactly the same.

64
00:03:06,090 --> 00:03:08,730
When you are doing a jump or an eye blink,

65
00:03:08,730 --> 00:03:11,810
it's always good to have contrast between

66
00:03:11,810 --> 00:03:14,290
the up motion and the down motion,

67
00:03:14,290 --> 00:03:17,740
even if it's just about one frame.

68
00:03:17,740 --> 00:03:20,840
When I polish the feet
whether it's for a cycle.

69
00:03:20,840 --> 00:03:22,580
or for another animation,

70
00:03:22,580 --> 00:03:25,570
I always start with the location,

71
00:03:25,570 --> 00:03:28,830
or I often polish the feet pretty early on

72
00:03:28,830 --> 00:03:31,690
because a lot of the torso motion,

73
00:03:31,690 --> 00:03:33,543
the hips motion is based
on the feet motion.

74
00:03:33,543 --> 00:03:38,170
The first thing I want to define

75
00:03:38,170 --> 00:03:40,920
is the contacting in position of the feet.

76
00:03:40,920 --> 00:03:44,650
To get a nice looking and
dynamic whole run cycle

77
00:03:44,650 --> 00:03:48,720
it's good to have a straight
leg during the contact.

78
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:50,644
So as mentioned produced in this case

79
00:03:50,644 --> 00:03:54,180
my character is a bit
too far from the ground

80
00:03:54,180 --> 00:03:55,960
to get a good pose

81
00:03:55,960 --> 00:03:58,380
so I can switch back to the root control

82
00:03:58,380 --> 00:04:02,290
and offset to the whole as Z curve down.

83
00:04:02,290 --> 00:04:04,480
As I define my contact pose,

84
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:07,320
it's important to also define the moment

85
00:04:07,320 --> 00:04:09,820
the feet will leave the ground.

86
00:04:09,820 --> 00:04:11,360
And as you may remember,

87
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:14,200
in the previous cycle we have created

88
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:17,150
the interpolation of the foot while

89
00:04:17,150 --> 00:04:19,690
it's on the ground should be linear

90
00:04:19,690 --> 00:04:21,330
because the ones on the ground,

91
00:04:21,330 --> 00:04:24,470
the feet will travel at a constant speed.

92
00:04:24,470 --> 00:04:28,600
I can convert the keys on
frame two and frame five

93
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:31,890
by selecting them and pressing the V key

94
00:04:31,890 --> 00:04:34,240
and switching to vector.

95
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:38,610
Then we can delete any key
between frame two and frame five.

96
00:04:38,610 --> 00:04:39,490
We'll have to do these

97
00:04:39,490 --> 00:04:42,317
for all the location curves Z Y and X .

98
00:04:42,317 --> 00:04:45,730
For the time being we
are focusing on Z and Y .

99
00:04:45,730 --> 00:04:49,070
Once done both curve
between frame two and five

100
00:04:49,070 --> 00:04:52,280
are linear making a straight line.

101
00:04:52,280 --> 00:04:55,230
This is the kind of obvious moment

102
00:04:55,230 --> 00:04:57,510
While the polishing feet.

103
00:04:57,510 --> 00:05:01,220
From there I will then focus
on getting a good feeling

104
00:05:01,220 --> 00:05:03,290
for the rest of the motion.

105
00:05:03,290 --> 00:05:07,020
As the foot leaves the
ground it still have momentum

106
00:05:07,020 --> 00:05:09,850
from the moment it was
traveling on the ground.

107
00:05:09,850 --> 00:05:12,560
This is why I like to push it back.

108
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:16,870
I want to favorise the
backward and forward position

109
00:05:16,870 --> 00:05:19,880
and have a quick motion
during the passing pose.

110
00:05:19,880 --> 00:05:23,710
The passing pose doesn't
read as well as the up pose

111
00:05:23,710 --> 00:05:25,240
and the pushing pose.

112
00:05:25,240 --> 00:05:28,680
Covering the airborne
poses of our character,

113
00:05:28,680 --> 00:05:32,490
his run will feel more agile and light.

114
00:05:32,490 --> 00:05:33,330
While in the end,

115
00:05:33,330 --> 00:05:38,280
I have a tight spacing around
frame 12 and frame zero,

116
00:05:38,280 --> 00:05:42,930
as the feet ease or slow
down into the extreme pose.

117
00:05:42,930 --> 00:05:46,625
And then I will accelerate
during the passing poses.

118
00:05:46,625 --> 00:05:51,390
Another thing I like to do is
to have a great acceleration

119
00:05:51,390 --> 00:05:53,330
just before the contact pose.

120
00:05:53,330 --> 00:05:57,300
So that we can feel that the
foot is smashing on the ground

121
00:05:57,300 --> 00:05:59,330
and then pushing backward.

122
00:05:59,330 --> 00:06:02,500
And we can see this
acceleration between frame zero

123
00:06:02,500 --> 00:06:03,790
and frame two,

124
00:06:03,790 --> 00:06:07,190
where our curve gets
more and more vertical.

125
00:06:07,190 --> 00:06:11,510
As usual, here you can see
the final polished curve

126
00:06:11,510 --> 00:06:14,490
of the Y and Z location of the feet.

127
00:06:14,490 --> 00:06:18,270
Try to match the motion path
you can see on this one screen

128
00:06:18,270 --> 00:06:20,060
you can pause the video there.

129
00:06:20,060 --> 00:06:22,963
Next step is polishing the
forward rotation of the foot.

130
00:06:24,690 --> 00:06:27,630
To do so As explained during debulking,

131
00:06:27,630 --> 00:06:31,850
I always have arrived using
the foot roll controller.

132
00:06:31,850 --> 00:06:34,890
I will make sure that I
have a nice heel contact

133
00:06:34,890 --> 00:06:36,120
on frame two

134
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:40,390
and that I have at least
one frame with a flat foot.

135
00:06:40,390 --> 00:06:43,480
Rotation of this controller
must be set to zero

136
00:06:43,480 --> 00:06:44,750
around frame foot.

137
00:06:44,750 --> 00:06:49,120
Might not be the case if you
should use printer references,

138
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:51,800
where on there are mostly
contacting with the bowl

139
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:52,860
of their foot.

140
00:06:52,860 --> 00:06:56,240
As they are constantly
accelerating forward.

141
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:59,880
But for a constant speed run cycle,

142
00:06:59,880 --> 00:07:02,333
it's better to contact with the heel.

143
00:07:02,333 --> 00:07:04,020
It will look better,

144
00:07:04,020 --> 00:07:06,950
you will have more contrast
into to your motion

145
00:07:06,950 --> 00:07:10,000
and the idea is to transition smoothly

146
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,060
from the heel to the toe.

147
00:07:12,060 --> 00:07:14,950
So that the character keeps momentum.

148
00:07:14,950 --> 00:07:17,330
As I'm reworking the heel position,

149
00:07:17,330 --> 00:07:20,490
the leg is less straight
during the pushing pose.

150
00:07:20,490 --> 00:07:24,610
So I can slightly offset
the wheel location curve

151
00:07:26,132 --> 00:07:29,500
of the foot and then get
back onto my heel controller.

152
00:07:29,500 --> 00:07:32,340
Again, we are not into
a linear work workflow,

153
00:07:32,340 --> 00:07:34,330
and we need to go back and forth

154
00:07:34,330 --> 00:07:35,860
to the different controllers

155
00:07:35,860 --> 00:07:37,540
who hit better poses.

156
00:07:37,540 --> 00:07:41,390
Now, I will get back to to
the torso route controller

157
00:07:41,390 --> 00:07:44,590
and select all the keys
of the wide location

158
00:07:44,590 --> 00:07:47,530
and move them down to push the whole body

159
00:07:47,530 --> 00:07:49,480
of my character forward

160
00:07:49,480 --> 00:07:51,773
and get a more dynamic pose.

161
00:07:51,773 --> 00:07:55,220
From there I will select
again my foot controller

162
00:07:55,220 --> 00:07:58,080
and move it's Y curves slightly down

163
00:07:58,080 --> 00:08:01,660
on the contact pose and
on the pushing pose.

164
00:08:01,660 --> 00:08:05,280
So we are always refining the
position of our character.

165
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:08,680
Now I can get back to work onto the heel

166
00:08:08,680 --> 00:08:11,860
and make sure I have a nice roll of foot.

167
00:08:11,860 --> 00:08:13,510
Here you can see again,

168
00:08:13,510 --> 00:08:15,320
the curve has a reference

169
00:08:15,320 --> 00:08:18,041
and use it to Polish your own curve,

170
00:08:18,041 --> 00:08:21,810
but you may focus on your own run cycle

171
00:08:21,810 --> 00:08:26,620
because this specific curve
match my specific animation

172
00:08:26,620 --> 00:08:30,652
and if you have differences
regarding your feet position

173
00:08:30,652 --> 00:08:34,660
or the eighth of the torso controller,

174
00:08:34,660 --> 00:08:36,500
you will have variation.

175
00:08:36,500 --> 00:08:38,140
They are used to make the tip

176
00:08:38,140 --> 00:08:41,250
of the foot slightly
pointing backward and down

177
00:08:41,250 --> 00:08:45,720
during the passing pose to
get this nice dragging motion

178
00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:48,970
and transition into having the heel down

179
00:08:48,970 --> 00:08:52,280
while the foot is about to hit the ground.

180
00:08:52,280 --> 00:08:55,251
Next, we will polish the toe controllers.

181
00:08:55,251 --> 00:08:57,222
This animation,

182
00:08:57,222 --> 00:08:59,500
I've only used the main toe controller

183
00:08:59,500 --> 00:09:02,760
since the big toe controller
move along with it

184
00:09:02,760 --> 00:09:04,360
that's perfectly fine.

185
00:09:04,360 --> 00:09:07,250
This part of the animation
is pretty straight forward.

186
00:09:07,250 --> 00:09:08,083
First of all,

187
00:09:08,083 --> 00:09:13,000
we will only be animating using
the X Euler rotation curve

188
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,870
is to create a nice
follow through animation

189
00:09:15,870 --> 00:09:18,360
of the toes, dragging something similar

190
00:09:18,360 --> 00:09:22,150
to what we did with the tail
of the squirrel character.

191
00:09:22,150 --> 00:09:25,680
It's important to console
the rotation while the foot

192
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:28,260
is on the ground so that
the toes won't click

193
00:09:28,260 --> 00:09:29,230
with the ground.

194
00:09:29,230 --> 00:09:32,190
This is why the keys
on frame four and five

195
00:09:32,190 --> 00:09:34,140
are switched to vector.

196
00:09:34,140 --> 00:09:36,720
One interesting subtlety I've done,

197
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:40,180
delay by one frame the
moment the toes get flat

198
00:09:40,180 --> 00:09:41,013
on the ground.

199
00:09:41,013 --> 00:09:43,670
The foot gets flattened on frame three

200
00:09:43,670 --> 00:09:46,810
and the toes follow through on frame four.

201
00:09:46,810 --> 00:09:48,680
When the foot leaves the ground,

202
00:09:48,680 --> 00:09:52,743
the toes are pointing
toward the previous pose,

203
00:09:53,842 --> 00:09:55,830
when the foot is moving forward to toes

204
00:09:57,473 --> 00:09:58,306
are slightly pointing backward.

205
00:09:58,306 --> 00:10:01,860
One thing you can use to help
yourself is the motion path

206
00:10:01,860 --> 00:10:03,580
of the foot we have on screen.

207
00:10:03,580 --> 00:10:08,250
The toes should be pointing
to what the previous frame

208
00:10:08,250 --> 00:10:09,660
during the cycle.

209
00:10:09,660 --> 00:10:13,720
These in most cases, will
bend them way too much,

210
00:10:13,720 --> 00:10:16,820
but then you just have
to adjust their curvature

211
00:10:16,820 --> 00:10:20,350
so that the foot have a
nice and natural pose.

212
00:10:20,350 --> 00:10:23,485
Here is the final curve of the X rotation

213
00:10:23,485 --> 00:10:26,000
of the toe controller.

214
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,350
As usual, you can pause the video there

215
00:10:28,350 --> 00:10:30,450
to compare this curve with your

216
00:10:30,450 --> 00:10:34,090
and again, this is the
curve of my animation.

217
00:10:34,090 --> 00:10:36,470
Yours might be a bit different.

218
00:10:36,470 --> 00:10:39,630
We've been mostly working on
the foot from the side view.

219
00:10:39,630 --> 00:10:42,743
Its time to revise it from the front view

220
00:10:42,743 --> 00:10:44,573
with the X location curve

221
00:10:44,573 --> 00:10:49,020
by selecting back the foot
controller, hidden all the keys,

222
00:10:49,020 --> 00:10:50,460
but the X location.

223
00:10:50,460 --> 00:10:53,650
And we will mark on the
side to side motion.

224
00:10:53,650 --> 00:10:56,410
Remember what I told you
regarding the location

225
00:10:56,410 --> 00:10:58,611
of the foot when hitting the ground.

226
00:10:58,611 --> 00:11:00,360
Linear interpolation,

227
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:03,080
and regarding the side to side motion,

228
00:11:03,080 --> 00:11:04,720
we need a flat curve,

229
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:08,880
meaning that the foot will
move on to a straight line.

230
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:09,713
To do so,

231
00:11:09,713 --> 00:11:14,170
I will convert keys on
frame two and five to vector

232
00:11:14,170 --> 00:11:16,710
and get rid of any keys in between.

233
00:11:16,710 --> 00:11:20,900
While I was originally planning
to make the foot push inward

234
00:11:20,900 --> 00:11:22,640
when leaving the ground

235
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:26,300
and then during the passing
pose getting on the outside,

236
00:11:26,300 --> 00:11:30,450
decided during this polishing
stage to do the inverse,

237
00:11:30,450 --> 00:11:32,980
as I told you before this motion can vary

238
00:11:32,980 --> 00:11:36,500
from people to people depending
on anatomic attribute,

239
00:11:36,500 --> 00:11:39,920
but also the skill to
run from this person.

240
00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:43,240
Since my character is agile and skilled,

241
00:11:43,240 --> 00:11:45,890
it might be better to kind of follow

242
00:11:45,890 --> 00:11:48,200
the motion of an athlete.

243
00:11:48,200 --> 00:11:49,033
In this case,

244
00:11:49,033 --> 00:11:52,338
the foot is getting outside
while getting off the ground

245
00:11:52,338 --> 00:11:54,770
inside during the passing pose,

246
00:11:54,770 --> 00:11:57,520
a bit outside during the up pose

247
00:11:57,520 --> 00:12:00,666
and finally hit it's contacting pose.

248
00:12:00,666 --> 00:12:05,120
You should keep the side to
side motion pretty subtle.

249
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:07,510
If the motion is too contrasted,

250
00:12:07,510 --> 00:12:11,180
the run will look a bit
sloppy as if your character

251
00:12:11,180 --> 00:12:13,170
was lacking of control.

252
00:12:13,170 --> 00:12:15,000
So beyond the motion here,

253
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,500
we are defining the character,

254
00:12:17,500 --> 00:12:21,560
we are defining the finding who
he is and how skilled he is.

255
00:12:21,560 --> 00:12:23,840
And this is what makes the difference

256
00:12:23,840 --> 00:12:26,290
between motion and animation.

257
00:12:26,290 --> 00:12:27,170
As you roll,

258
00:12:27,170 --> 00:12:31,660
here is the final X location
curve on the foot controller.

259
00:12:31,660 --> 00:12:32,950
Once you're done with this,

260
00:12:32,950 --> 00:12:36,750
you can call the foot
splining and polishing done

261
00:12:36,750 --> 00:12:40,480
or you can stay with me for
a couple of extra minutes

262
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:44,340
where we will add some
extra super subtle rotation

263
00:12:44,340 --> 00:12:47,940
to the foot to bring its
motion to the next level.

264
00:12:47,940 --> 00:12:49,910
To do so I will use first

265
00:12:49,910 --> 00:12:52,920
the Y quaternion rotation of foot.

266
00:12:52,920 --> 00:12:55,990
I don't want it to rotate
while on the ground.

267
00:12:55,990 --> 00:12:56,970
So as usual,

268
00:12:56,970 --> 00:13:01,970
I will create a flat curve
bound by two vector handles.

269
00:13:02,070 --> 00:13:05,640
We will use the Y rotation
curve to slightly twist

270
00:13:05,640 --> 00:13:08,123
the foot toward another target.

271
00:13:09,463 --> 00:13:10,780
Check the orientation of the center,

272
00:13:10,780 --> 00:13:12,550
while I'm rotating the foot

273
00:13:12,550 --> 00:13:14,070
during this polition state,

274
00:13:14,070 --> 00:13:18,240
I am pushing it inward while
the foot is leaving the ground

275
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:20,180
and during the passing pose,

276
00:13:20,180 --> 00:13:23,620
and then I'm slightly
pushing it on the outside

277
00:13:23,620 --> 00:13:26,650
while the foot is about
to contact the ground.

278
00:13:26,650 --> 00:13:29,200
Since the foot is using quaternions,

279
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:33,083
we need to play on both
the Y and Z rotation curve

280
00:13:33,083 --> 00:13:36,510
to properly orientate the foot.

281
00:13:36,510 --> 00:13:39,840
Just scrub through this reference video,

282
00:13:39,840 --> 00:13:43,060
focusing on the orientation of the foot,

283
00:13:43,060 --> 00:13:45,600
we'll find a link to the YouTube video

284
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:47,171
in the documentation as usual.

285
00:13:47,171 --> 00:13:50,270
You have the final shape of the Z

286
00:13:50,270 --> 00:13:54,200
and Y quaternion rotation
curve of the foot controller.

287
00:13:54,200 --> 00:13:55,812
From there,

288
00:13:55,812 --> 00:13:56,970
there is another thing we need to fix.

289
00:13:56,970 --> 00:13:58,790
It's the pull target of the knee.

290
00:13:58,790 --> 00:13:59,623
Here again,

291
00:13:59,623 --> 00:14:02,690
we could work a lot on the left
to right motion of the knee,

292
00:14:02,690 --> 00:14:06,630
which is super subtle during
the run cycle but still exists.

293
00:14:06,630 --> 00:14:10,790
Since our character is
pretty light on his feet,

294
00:14:10,790 --> 00:14:14,510
I will just try to keep the
knees align with the run.

295
00:14:14,510 --> 00:14:17,330
So I'm just going frame to frame

296
00:14:17,330 --> 00:14:21,270
and adjusting the X location
of the pull controller,

297
00:14:21,270 --> 00:14:23,470
so that it looks a little cleaner.

298
00:14:23,470 --> 00:14:27,200
Having the knees almost align
with the feet and the hips

299
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:29,803
will look better and more dynamical.

300
00:14:29,803 --> 00:14:32,563
The intimate detail before
we mirror on the motion

301
00:14:32,563 --> 00:14:34,820
on to the other foot,

302
00:14:34,820 --> 00:14:38,810
is the bank or side to
side rotation of the foot.

303
00:14:38,810 --> 00:14:41,930
From a front view when
the foot hit the ground,

304
00:14:41,930 --> 00:14:43,970
it's not perfectly flat.

305
00:14:43,970 --> 00:14:45,750
When the foot hit the ground,

306
00:14:45,750 --> 00:14:50,660
it's generally slightly
rotated toward its outer edge,

307
00:14:50,660 --> 00:14:55,350
and it will roll onto the
thumb while pushing backwards,

308
00:14:55,350 --> 00:14:56,600
this is not a big deal,

309
00:14:56,600 --> 00:14:58,130
but this is the kind of detail

310
00:14:58,130 --> 00:15:01,318
that will make your run
cycle look a little better.

311
00:15:01,318 --> 00:15:02,151
From there,

312
00:15:02,151 --> 00:15:06,020
we can mirror the animation
onto the other legs controller.

313
00:15:06,020 --> 00:15:09,340
First, we need to select all
the right click controller.

314
00:15:09,340 --> 00:15:10,640
we've just polished.

315
00:15:10,640 --> 00:15:13,330
Then in the graph editor press Alt + H

316
00:15:13,330 --> 00:15:16,390
to make sure you don't
have any hidden curve.

317
00:15:16,390 --> 00:15:19,320
From there press eight
to select all the curve

318
00:15:19,320 --> 00:15:22,470
and then Ctrl + C to copy those curve.

319
00:15:22,470 --> 00:15:26,440
Then we can select all the
controllers on the left leg.

320
00:15:26,440 --> 00:15:29,640
And from there in the
graph editor, press Alt + H

321
00:15:29,640 --> 00:15:32,530
to make sure you don't
have any hidden curve.

322
00:15:32,530 --> 00:15:36,730
Now select all the keys
but the one on frame zero

323
00:15:36,730 --> 00:15:40,330
from there, make sure that
the play head is on frame zero

324
00:15:40,330 --> 00:15:45,210
and press Ctrl + Shift + V
to paste the mirrored curves.

325
00:15:45,210 --> 00:15:47,360
Now we have this fun animation,

326
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:50,180
where both leg do the same motion

327
00:15:50,180 --> 00:15:51,890
and we need to offset it.

328
00:15:51,890 --> 00:15:55,070
To do so, in the graph,
editor press Shift + D

329
00:15:55,070 --> 00:15:57,330
to duplicate all the frames.

330
00:15:57,330 --> 00:16:02,303
Don't press enter, then
press the X and 24.

331
00:16:03,210 --> 00:16:06,353
This will move those newly
created frame by 24 frame

332
00:16:06,353 --> 00:16:09,120
on the right.

333
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:13,180
If we now move those keys
in time left to right

334
00:16:13,180 --> 00:16:14,810
while playing the animation,

335
00:16:14,810 --> 00:16:19,190
we can see that we are
currently offsetting the motion.

336
00:16:19,190 --> 00:16:22,610
So if I press G X minus 12,

337
00:16:22,610 --> 00:16:26,830
now the left leg motion
is offset by 12 frames.

338
00:16:26,830 --> 00:16:31,100
So of the length of the
cycle with the right leg

339
00:16:31,100 --> 00:16:32,640
and our cycle is done.

340
00:16:32,640 --> 00:16:34,240
To make this clean,

341
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:37,690
I will go on frame
zero, press I an insert,

342
00:16:37,690 --> 00:16:39,970
and key frame on all channels,

343
00:16:39,970 --> 00:16:43,370
select all the keys on
frames zero, press V

344
00:16:43,370 --> 00:16:45,530
and switch them to free.

345
00:16:45,530 --> 00:16:47,410
Then they will duplicate them

346
00:16:47,410 --> 00:16:51,920
with Shift and D and
move them on frame 24.

347
00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:56,010
We can now delete any keys after frame 24

348
00:16:56,010 --> 00:16:58,190
and before frame zero

349
00:16:58,190 --> 00:17:02,453
and both our leg now
cycling and are polished.
