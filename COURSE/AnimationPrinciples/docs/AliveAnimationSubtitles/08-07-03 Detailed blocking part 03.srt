1
00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:03,570
- The next pose I'd like
to add to my animation

2
00:00:03,570 --> 00:00:04,480
is the subtle,

3
00:00:04,480 --> 00:00:08,270
just after the other
shoot of the cross punch.

4
00:00:08,270 --> 00:00:10,294
To our right cross default pose,

5
00:00:10,294 --> 00:00:14,273
we have created a pose where
everything is extended forward

6
00:00:14,273 --> 00:00:18,300
so that it better
communicate impact and speed.

7
00:00:18,300 --> 00:00:23,130
As a smear frame, this kind
of pose can't last too long,

8
00:00:23,130 --> 00:00:25,140
or it will really looks weird.

9
00:00:25,140 --> 00:00:27,670
So we need to burn a subtle pose,

10
00:00:27,670 --> 00:00:30,540
where we get rid of all the exaggeration,

11
00:00:30,540 --> 00:00:32,510
the chest we'll get back in place.

12
00:00:32,510 --> 00:00:35,160
The hips will catch up and the right arm

13
00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:37,800
will recover it's normal size.

14
00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:41,790
Not that the left arm is doing
an overshoot and finishing

15
00:00:41,790 --> 00:00:45,290
it's ark by getting a little straighter.

16
00:00:45,290 --> 00:00:47,610
So building this pose is
going to be pretty straight

17
00:00:47,610 --> 00:00:48,443
forward.

18
00:00:48,443 --> 00:00:51,120
I will pull the beat to
the center of gravity back

19
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:53,690
and I will reset the location on all the

20
00:00:53,690 --> 00:00:57,440
bones on the arm so that
it's not stretched anymore.

21
00:00:57,440 --> 00:01:00,180
I will do the same with
the IEPs and the chest.

22
00:01:00,180 --> 00:01:02,470
And then, I will reset or transform

23
00:01:02,470 --> 00:01:04,500
on the tweaker bone, along the chain

24
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:05,680
of the spine.

25
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:08,470
We have used those bones to fix the shape

26
00:01:08,470 --> 00:01:10,350
of the torso when it was extended,

27
00:01:10,350 --> 00:01:12,220
but we don't need them anymore.

28
00:01:12,220 --> 00:01:13,391
It's in the chest to the right.

29
00:01:13,391 --> 00:01:16,749
And as the left arm was a
swinging back during the previous

30
00:01:16,749 --> 00:01:17,750
frames,

31
00:01:17,750 --> 00:01:21,640
I will spread a bit more
the whole arm chain as it is

32
00:01:21,640 --> 00:01:23,700
finishing its motion back.

33
00:01:23,700 --> 00:01:25,453
So compared to the previous pose

34
00:01:25,453 --> 00:01:27,945
I have built during the blocking stage,

35
00:01:27,945 --> 00:01:31,800
I've kept the character
way straighter this time.

36
00:01:31,800 --> 00:01:33,889
I was initially planning to make him dive

37
00:01:33,889 --> 00:01:36,440
into the anticipation for the hook,

38
00:01:36,440 --> 00:01:39,300
but the character look way out of balance.

39
00:01:39,300 --> 00:01:42,109
I prefer that he pulled back his right arm

40
00:01:42,109 --> 00:01:44,670
so that the right leg can catch up

41
00:01:44,670 --> 00:01:47,643
and then dive into the
anticipation for the hook.

42
00:01:48,700 --> 00:01:50,370
So we do need to build the pose

43
00:01:50,370 --> 00:01:52,620
where the right foot is catching up.

44
00:01:52,620 --> 00:01:54,560
If we watch the previous pose,

45
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:58,140
we have built and the
next one in the animation

46
00:01:58,140 --> 00:02:00,390
that we can see that as the right foot

47
00:02:00,390 --> 00:02:03,370
is going forward, the
chest is going backwards

48
00:02:03,370 --> 00:02:05,280
into a more neutral pose.

49
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:07,080
We are going to break the position between

50
00:02:07,080 --> 00:02:09,720
where the right foot is still traveling,

51
00:02:09,720 --> 00:02:12,500
and so our characters center of gravity

52
00:02:12,500 --> 00:02:14,720
is more to while that the left leg.

53
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:17,180
He's still lightweight on his right foot

54
00:02:17,180 --> 00:02:18,150
and pulling it.

55
00:02:18,150 --> 00:02:21,360
This is why I raised the heel as the hips

56
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:23,120
are leading the animation because

57
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:25,780
they are dragging the character backward

58
00:02:25,780 --> 00:02:29,450
the chest is dragging. So
does the right arm chain,

59
00:02:29,450 --> 00:02:32,390
but they have already
started to move backward.

60
00:02:32,390 --> 00:02:34,834
Particularly the lower
part of our character

61
00:02:34,834 --> 00:02:38,400
is visualizing the next
pose, while the upper

62
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:41,090
part is visualizing the previous pose.

63
00:02:41,090 --> 00:02:42,930
On this lead there is not that much

64
00:02:42,930 --> 00:02:44,920
to say about the posing process

65
00:02:44,920 --> 00:02:47,770
whenever I'm building
these specific in-between.

66
00:02:47,770 --> 00:02:50,770
So I will jump to the next pose.

67
00:02:50,770 --> 00:02:53,670
As usual, you will find a slow paced

68
00:02:53,670 --> 00:02:55,850
time-lapse of the whole processes

69
00:02:55,850 --> 00:02:56,812
that you can follow along.

70
00:02:56,812 --> 00:02:57,645
(wind rushing)

71
00:02:57,645 --> 00:03:00,340
The next area of our
animation is, that really

72
00:03:00,340 --> 00:03:02,754
lacks information, is the step-

73
00:03:02,754 --> 00:03:04,780
back after the kick.

74
00:03:04,780 --> 00:03:06,510
We have already built the pose where

75
00:03:06,510 --> 00:03:09,980
our character is pulling his left leg back

76
00:03:09,980 --> 00:03:14,150
after the kick, then going
into the contact pose,

77
00:03:14,150 --> 00:03:17,940
and then it's idle pose,
right leg goes back

78
00:03:17,940 --> 00:03:20,150
and supports to weight of the character.

79
00:03:20,150 --> 00:03:22,410
But we do need to create the poses where

80
00:03:22,410 --> 00:03:24,636
our character will be
pulling his right leg.

81
00:03:24,636 --> 00:03:27,837
Then when the right leg
is going to contact,

82
00:03:27,837 --> 00:03:31,260
then you can even create a down pose.

83
00:03:31,260 --> 00:03:33,960
Before you settle into the idle pose.

84
00:03:33,960 --> 00:03:36,400
To start positioning the torso controller,

85
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:39,807
you can press shift E to
activate the break down there.

86
00:03:39,807 --> 00:03:43,860
And then you can slightly offset
the torso controller to the

87
00:03:43,860 --> 00:03:46,690
left, on top of the left leg that is going

88
00:03:46,690 --> 00:03:49,170
to support the weight
of the character as the

89
00:03:49,170 --> 00:03:50,501
left leg is supporting the weight

90
00:03:50,501 --> 00:03:53,430
of the character, I'm
concealing the rotation

91
00:03:53,430 --> 00:03:55,353
of the heels is that
it's in contact with the

92
00:03:55,353 --> 00:03:57,706
ground and they've slightly pushed

93
00:03:57,706 --> 00:04:00,380
the left foot into the ground,

94
00:04:00,380 --> 00:04:02,030
to fake body pressure.

95
00:04:02,030 --> 00:04:03,590
Then you can slightly lean your

96
00:04:03,590 --> 00:04:06,067
character to the left as he's pulling

97
00:04:06,067 --> 00:04:07,970
his right leg up.

98
00:04:07,970 --> 00:04:09,950
Normally I will slightly clench or pose

99
00:04:09,950 --> 00:04:13,020
the chest by twisting it to the right.

100
00:04:13,020 --> 00:04:15,320
Since the hips are twisting the other way

101
00:04:15,320 --> 00:04:16,690
to pull the right leg.

102
00:04:16,690 --> 00:04:19,620
Finally, you can relax a bit the arms

103
00:04:19,620 --> 00:04:21,470
by spreading them. In this case,

104
00:04:21,470 --> 00:04:24,120
the right leg looks a little bit too

105
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:26,770
over extended, so I
will slightly raise the

106
00:04:26,770 --> 00:04:29,440
foot as it starts traveling backwards.

107
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:32,969
We know of the pose where
the foot is taking off,

108
00:04:32,969 --> 00:04:35,308
we need to create the post where the foot

109
00:04:35,308 --> 00:04:37,660
is just contacting the ground.

110
00:04:37,660 --> 00:04:39,740
As usual, you need to first think of the

111
00:04:39,740 --> 00:04:42,300
position of the center of gravity.

112
00:04:42,300 --> 00:04:44,330
The feet are traveling faster.

113
00:04:44,330 --> 00:04:46,486
So the center of gravity will still

114
00:04:46,486 --> 00:04:49,547
be more onto the left
foot, which is supporting

115
00:04:49,547 --> 00:04:52,893
the weight, but also more forward.

116
00:04:52,893 --> 00:04:56,400
It will catch up the right leg later on.

117
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:59,810
It's a common beginner mistake
to see the center of gravity

118
00:04:59,810 --> 00:05:02,670
traveling as fast as
the feet. But generally

119
00:05:02,670 --> 00:05:05,890
your center of gravity,
starting to move backward

120
00:05:05,890 --> 00:05:08,440
The front foot is taking off, then it will

121
00:05:08,440 --> 00:05:11,600
land, and then the center
of gravity will catch-up.

122
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:14,500
From there, since our
character is more relaxed

123
00:05:14,500 --> 00:05:17,750
than during the punches,
I'm trying to make the

124
00:05:17,750 --> 00:05:20,570
arm strike a bit. So if the body

125
00:05:20,570 --> 00:05:23,360
is moving backward, I will slightly

126
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:26,420
rotate the arm forward.
If the body's going down,

127
00:05:26,420 --> 00:05:28,920
I will slightly rotate the arm up

128
00:05:28,920 --> 00:05:30,960
and I will do the same with the neck

129
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:33,050
and the head of the character.

130
00:05:33,050 --> 00:05:35,360
You can track the chin of your character.

131
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:38,070
For example, if the body is going down,

132
00:05:38,070 --> 00:05:40,430
or the center of gravity is going down,

133
00:05:40,430 --> 00:05:42,597
slightly rotate the head backwards

134
00:05:42,597 --> 00:05:45,111
so that the chin is raising it.

135
00:05:45,111 --> 00:05:45,944
(wind rushing)

136
00:05:45,944 --> 00:05:47,740
While our character is moving back.

137
00:05:47,740 --> 00:05:50,000
You can take this opportunity to

138
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:53,430
pose the punching bag as
it lands on the ground.

139
00:05:53,430 --> 00:05:57,090
So, instead of making each landing flat,

140
00:05:57,090 --> 00:05:59,667
I will slightly raise the tip of the bag.

141
00:05:59,667 --> 00:06:02,455
And then on the next pose, I will push it

142
00:06:02,455 --> 00:06:05,470
further away so that it
seems to slide on the

143
00:06:05,470 --> 00:06:08,540
ground. Just push it a
touch, don't move it too

144
00:06:08,540 --> 00:06:10,323
far away or it will looks weird.

145
00:06:10,323 --> 00:06:11,156
(wind rushing)

146
00:06:11,156 --> 00:06:13,540
Another area of the
animation, where the feet

147
00:06:13,540 --> 00:06:16,256
are changing location
and we haven't created

148
00:06:16,256 --> 00:06:18,770
the contacting pose, is the jab.

149
00:06:18,770 --> 00:06:21,740
As usual to get the right location for the

150
00:06:21,740 --> 00:06:25,070
left foot I will go on to the jab pose.

151
00:06:25,070 --> 00:06:27,780
I will press control C to copy the pose

152
00:06:27,780 --> 00:06:30,180
of the left foot, go to a previous frame

153
00:06:30,180 --> 00:06:32,461
and press control V. From there I can

154
00:06:32,461 --> 00:06:35,840
tweak the foot rotation
and the heel rotation.

155
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:38,030
Remember what we have said before,

156
00:06:38,030 --> 00:06:41,200
the feet move faster than
the center of gravity.

157
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:43,930
So using the break downer, I will create

158
00:06:43,930 --> 00:06:45,918
the pose for the center of gravity,

159
00:06:45,918 --> 00:06:48,350
favoring the previous pose.

160
00:06:48,350 --> 00:06:50,510
So if we compare the pose of our

161
00:06:50,510 --> 00:06:52,390
character on the previous frame

162
00:06:52,390 --> 00:06:54,930
and on the jab frame, and now we

163
00:06:54,930 --> 00:06:57,051
watch the transition
frame we are currently

164
00:06:57,051 --> 00:06:59,240
building. Foot is moving faster

165
00:06:59,240 --> 00:07:01,550
than the center of
gravity. As the character

166
00:07:01,550 --> 00:07:03,330
is pushing with his right leg,

167
00:07:03,330 --> 00:07:05,500
the center of gravity is likely

168
00:07:05,500 --> 00:07:07,920
shifting toward the left foot.

169
00:07:07,920 --> 00:07:09,739
Don't forget to also twist the

170
00:07:09,739 --> 00:07:13,010
center of gravity towards the left foot,

171
00:07:13,010 --> 00:07:16,400
increasing the range and
the strength of the punch.

172
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:18,640
Another detail regarding this pose

173
00:07:18,640 --> 00:07:21,790
is that I've opened, a bit, the fingers

174
00:07:21,790 --> 00:07:23,840
so that it feels like they are dragging

175
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:26,314
back as the character
is moving fast forward.

176
00:07:26,314 --> 00:07:30,070
The finger of the right hand are relaxed,

177
00:07:30,070 --> 00:07:33,560
are bending backward as
they are dragging back.

178
00:07:33,560 --> 00:07:35,990
This is the kind of detail that

179
00:07:35,990 --> 00:07:39,466
could have been added
during the polishing stage.

180
00:07:39,466 --> 00:07:42,870
But if you think of something during the

181
00:07:42,870 --> 00:07:45,400
looking stage, you should the block it

182
00:07:45,400 --> 00:07:47,873
because you may forget it afterwards.
