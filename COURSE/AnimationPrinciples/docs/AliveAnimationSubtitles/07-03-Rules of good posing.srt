1
00:00:00,380 --> 00:00:03,730
- Since animation is a sequence of poses.

2
00:00:03,730 --> 00:00:07,360
Creating good poses is a must have skill.

3
00:00:07,360 --> 00:00:10,880
So let's study the different
features that make a oppose

4
00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:12,040
a good pose.

5
00:00:12,040 --> 00:00:15,450
In the previous video, we
have seen the line of action.

6
00:00:15,450 --> 00:00:19,760
So clearly it's super important
that your line of action

7
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:23,220
are clearly defined on all your poses.

8
00:00:23,220 --> 00:00:26,000
It will help to read your poses.

9
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:29,930
It will help to read the
flow of your animation.

10
00:00:29,930 --> 00:00:34,100
So this is definitely the first
thing you have to look after

11
00:00:34,100 --> 00:00:35,870
when building your pose.

12
00:00:35,870 --> 00:00:38,760
Senior, or the evolution
of the line of action

13
00:00:38,760 --> 00:00:42,210
clearly communicates
the flow of the motion

14
00:00:42,210 --> 00:00:43,043
and the emotion.

15
00:00:44,180 --> 00:00:47,220
Second thing you have
to look for, is balance.

16
00:00:47,220 --> 00:00:50,690
Characters that look off
balance will look weird

17
00:00:50,690 --> 00:00:52,830
even to a non-animator.

18
00:00:52,830 --> 00:00:56,190
You as an animator should know how to fix

19
00:00:56,190 --> 00:00:59,840
enough balance pose or
enough balance character

20
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:01,270
or a static pose.

21
00:01:01,270 --> 00:01:04,150
A good technique is to draw a box

22
00:01:04,150 --> 00:01:07,040
around the main feature of the body.

23
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:09,280
The ones that wait the more.

24
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:12,910
Since the main goal of
balance is to fight gravity,

25
00:01:12,910 --> 00:01:16,730
draw a straight vertical line
in the middle of this box.

26
00:01:16,730 --> 00:01:19,880
This line should basically come across

27
00:01:19,880 --> 00:01:21,510
your center of gravity.

28
00:01:21,510 --> 00:01:26,510
If you don't have at least one
contact point or better two

29
00:01:26,540 --> 00:01:29,470
or three contact point under this line,

30
00:01:29,470 --> 00:01:32,240
your character will look off balance.

31
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:35,870
In the case of three
contact point or more,

32
00:01:35,870 --> 00:01:39,180
the center of gravity, just has to be bind

33
00:01:39,180 --> 00:01:43,600
to the triangle shape formed
by those contact points.

34
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:47,820
When you have only two points
of contact with the ground,

35
00:01:47,820 --> 00:01:51,690
the center of gravity
should come across the line

36
00:01:51,690 --> 00:01:54,480
drawn by those two contact points.

37
00:01:54,480 --> 00:01:57,250
Finally, when you have
only one contact point

38
00:01:57,250 --> 00:02:00,220
with the ground, your center of gravity

39
00:02:00,220 --> 00:02:03,910
must be vertically aligned
with this contact point.

40
00:02:03,910 --> 00:02:07,600
Note that your center of
gravity is not always centered

41
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:09,030
around your hips.

42
00:02:09,030 --> 00:02:12,150
You have to take in account
the weight of your legs,

43
00:02:12,150 --> 00:02:15,750
of your arms whenever you're
trying to balance yourself

44
00:02:15,750 --> 00:02:18,030
by spreading your arms on the side

45
00:02:18,030 --> 00:02:21,123
or whatever piece of
equipment you are wearing.

46
00:02:22,540 --> 00:02:25,450
The next important thing
whenever you are building

47
00:02:25,450 --> 00:02:27,640
a strong pose is silhouette.

48
00:02:27,640 --> 00:02:31,560
It's the main feature
that's gonna be identifiable

49
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:33,560
on your character pose.

50
00:02:33,560 --> 00:02:37,490
While the inner shapes of your
character might need other

51
00:02:37,490 --> 00:02:41,400
to notice or to identify like
the head of the character

52
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:42,390
on this pose.

53
00:02:42,390 --> 00:02:46,610
Reading inner shapes will
greatly depend on the quality of

54
00:02:46,610 --> 00:02:50,200
the character design and its contrast.

55
00:02:50,200 --> 00:02:52,780
A good practice is to have a dedicated

56
00:02:52,780 --> 00:02:57,780
window in blender with a 3D
view set to flat shading.

57
00:02:58,270 --> 00:03:00,250
If you're animating to camera,

58
00:03:00,250 --> 00:03:02,250
these should be the camera view.

59
00:03:02,250 --> 00:03:05,010
This way you will always have a sneak peek

60
00:03:05,010 --> 00:03:07,087
to the silhouette of your character.

61
00:03:07,087 --> 00:03:09,900
Now that we know how to
display our silhouette,

62
00:03:09,900 --> 00:03:11,920
what makes a good silhouette?

63
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:14,520
The most important thing is readability.

64
00:03:14,520 --> 00:03:17,210
The trident is currently a good example,

65
00:03:17,210 --> 00:03:22,120
showing the three teeth or
three points of the tridents,

66
00:03:22,120 --> 00:03:24,740
make it clear on the silhouette view.

67
00:03:24,740 --> 00:03:29,120
While if I rotate it by a few
degrees and show its profile,

68
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:31,470
it doesn't read well anymore.

69
00:03:31,470 --> 00:03:35,620
We no longer identify a
trident, but simple spear.

70
00:03:35,620 --> 00:03:37,800
If we scrub through the animation,

71
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:41,400
most of the poses are clear
on this one, the legs,

72
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:45,320
the arms and the sword
are clearly identifiable.

73
00:03:45,320 --> 00:03:47,310
The same will apply to this pose

74
00:03:47,310 --> 00:03:49,900
where we can clearly
see that the character

75
00:03:49,900 --> 00:03:52,720
is handling this weapon with two hands

76
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:55,730
or even this pose where through camera,

77
00:03:55,730 --> 00:03:59,300
I slightly offset the
position of the sword

78
00:03:59,300 --> 00:04:02,270
so that it appear in the
back of the character.

79
00:04:02,270 --> 00:04:05,770
While I did the mistake
on the specific pose

80
00:04:05,770 --> 00:04:07,450
to not have a clear silhouette.

81
00:04:07,450 --> 00:04:10,860
And I received this as a
critique a lot of time.

82
00:04:10,860 --> 00:04:13,680
And that's a bummer because
this is one of the strongest

83
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:15,560
moment in the animation.

84
00:04:15,560 --> 00:04:18,730
This could have been
improved by slightly rotating

85
00:04:18,730 --> 00:04:22,080
the whole character so
that we can see more

86
00:04:22,080 --> 00:04:26,260
of a profile of the character
distinguishing both feet

87
00:04:26,260 --> 00:04:28,000
and a bit of the arms.

88
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,540
Another principle that will help you build

89
00:04:30,540 --> 00:04:34,770
a solid silhouette is
simplicity versus complexity.

90
00:04:34,770 --> 00:04:37,170
If we have a look to
those different poses,

91
00:04:37,170 --> 00:04:41,140
we can clearly see that
one side of the character

92
00:04:41,140 --> 00:04:46,090
has almost a straight
line or a smooth curve.

93
00:04:46,090 --> 00:04:48,530
While the opposite side of the character

94
00:04:48,530 --> 00:04:50,650
is generally more detailed.

95
00:04:50,650 --> 00:04:53,700
This will improve the
appeal of your poses.

96
00:04:53,700 --> 00:04:57,090
It will also improve their readability

97
00:04:57,090 --> 00:04:59,680
by giving them an orientation

98
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:02,800
or at least giving them contrast.

99
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:07,090
We did talk a lot about
contrast in our motion

100
00:05:07,090 --> 00:05:11,080
whenever we have an odd
and a fast transition

101
00:05:11,080 --> 00:05:13,760
That's the same regarding posing,

102
00:05:13,760 --> 00:05:18,180
simplicity versus
complexity brings contrast.

103
00:05:18,180 --> 00:05:22,483
And so it brings more
interest into the pose.

104
00:05:24,030 --> 00:05:26,840
Another important point
regarding silhouette

105
00:05:26,840 --> 00:05:28,580
is negative space.

106
00:05:28,580 --> 00:05:31,320
Negative spaces are the
holes in the silhouette

107
00:05:31,320 --> 00:05:32,480
of the character.

108
00:05:32,480 --> 00:05:35,910
When you have overlapping
features like the arm crossing

109
00:05:35,910 --> 00:05:38,280
the body of the character in this case,

110
00:05:38,280 --> 00:05:42,910
make sure that you use those
negative space to show the

111
00:05:42,910 --> 00:05:47,120
different features that will
help the viewer to identify the

112
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:48,830
different parts of the character.

113
00:05:48,830 --> 00:05:52,490
Like the same here of the
silhouette of the biceps

114
00:05:52,490 --> 00:05:55,880
that allow us to clearly identify the hand

115
00:05:55,880 --> 00:05:57,170
or the arm of the character.

116
00:05:57,170 --> 00:06:00,090
You should also try to avoid tangent

117
00:06:00,090 --> 00:06:02,450
on your character or on your silhouette.

118
00:06:02,450 --> 00:06:05,830
On this specific pose, the leg get tangent

119
00:06:05,830 --> 00:06:07,820
with the end of the spear

120
00:06:07,820 --> 00:06:10,290
and why it's not the end of the world

121
00:06:10,290 --> 00:06:14,240
that could be improved if
the character was moved a bit

122
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:18,380
to one side or the other
so that we have no tangent

123
00:06:18,380 --> 00:06:20,787
between the leg and the spear

124
00:06:20,787 --> 00:06:24,270
and we can clearly identify both features.

125
00:06:24,270 --> 00:06:26,520
There is another pose that look decent,

126
00:06:26,520 --> 00:06:29,950
but that will read better
and it will be more appealing

127
00:06:29,950 --> 00:06:33,720
if we were to separate a bit
the silhouette of the legs

128
00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:37,640
and break the tangent in the
arms by showing the wrist

129
00:06:37,640 --> 00:06:39,560
or an elbow, for example.

130
00:06:39,560 --> 00:06:42,040
Avoid twinning in your poses.

131
00:06:42,040 --> 00:06:45,960
Twinning occurs whenever you
have two features of the body,

132
00:06:45,960 --> 00:06:49,250
like the hands or the
feet that have exactly

133
00:06:49,250 --> 00:06:50,460
the same pose.

134
00:06:50,460 --> 00:06:54,151
While it can be something
you voluntarily create

135
00:06:54,151 --> 00:06:57,030
to bring strengths to a pose

136
00:06:57,030 --> 00:06:59,640
or to bring control into a pose

137
00:06:59,640 --> 00:07:01,900
like on the beginning of this jump,

138
00:07:01,900 --> 00:07:05,421
where everything about
the body of our character

139
00:07:05,421 --> 00:07:06,570
is symmetrical.

140
00:07:06,570 --> 00:07:08,860
This is something you should live out.

141
00:07:08,860 --> 00:07:11,020
For example on this pose,

142
00:07:11,020 --> 00:07:14,920
both feet have a slight different of pose.

143
00:07:14,920 --> 00:07:17,780
If I make them having the same pose,

144
00:07:17,780 --> 00:07:21,050
it won't look as appealing
as the previous one.

145
00:07:21,050 --> 00:07:23,130
Twinning will bring a lot of stability

146
00:07:23,130 --> 00:07:26,910
and so it will kind of break the momentum

147
00:07:26,910 --> 00:07:28,680
or the contrast in the pose.

148
00:07:28,680 --> 00:07:31,990
Twinning can also occur in timing.

149
00:07:31,990 --> 00:07:34,870
For example here, my character is catching

150
00:07:34,870 --> 00:07:37,300
both sword at the same time,

151
00:07:37,300 --> 00:07:40,950
and this is a personal choice
because I want to show that

152
00:07:40,950 --> 00:07:43,600
he's perfectly knowing what he's doing

153
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:46,120
and mastering his art.

154
00:07:46,120 --> 00:07:49,600
So twinning both in timing
and in the pose can show

155
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:52,040
strength and stability.

156
00:07:52,040 --> 00:07:54,590
But in the case of this jump for example,

157
00:07:54,590 --> 00:07:59,030
if I was to make both feet
arrive at the same time,

158
00:07:59,030 --> 00:08:02,420
that will make the animation
a bit less appealing

159
00:08:02,420 --> 00:08:03,640
and interesting.

160
00:08:03,640 --> 00:08:07,163
In the end twinning bring
a sense of perfection.

161
00:08:09,270 --> 00:08:11,750
And whenever you're achieving art,

162
00:08:11,750 --> 00:08:14,570
what you want to avoid is perfection.

163
00:08:14,570 --> 00:08:16,960
There is a lot of randomness in life,

164
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:19,630
and she's what we want to represent.

165
00:08:19,630 --> 00:08:23,863
We want to make it alive, not
to make something perfect,

166
00:08:25,385 --> 00:08:26,218
something CG.

167
00:08:26,218 --> 00:08:28,993
Another thing you should
avoid are perpendicular lines.

168
00:08:29,991 --> 00:08:31,260
If I take these pose that is decent

169
00:08:31,260 --> 00:08:34,270
and I now make the arm
perpendicular to the spear

170
00:08:36,764 --> 00:08:38,066
by straightening the elbow,

171
00:08:38,066 --> 00:08:40,090
making this pure vertical,
that will look super stiff.

172
00:08:40,090 --> 00:08:44,340
And if I even exaggerate
despite straightening

173
00:08:44,340 --> 00:08:47,630
the whole torso, the neck, the head,

174
00:08:47,630 --> 00:08:50,853
or even the other arm
that will look really bad.

175
00:08:53,110 --> 00:08:55,320
And my last advice,

176
00:08:55,320 --> 00:08:58,820
try not to hide any
part of your character.

177
00:08:58,820 --> 00:09:02,450
There will be many times where
it's gonna be impossible,

178
00:09:02,450 --> 00:09:05,650
but when you have the
choice like on this pose,

179
00:09:05,650 --> 00:09:08,241
make sure that we see
a bit of the fingers.

180
00:09:08,241 --> 00:09:11,380
Don't hide them into the silhouette.

181
00:09:11,380 --> 00:09:14,890
Or on this other pose,
the pose looks great.

182
00:09:14,890 --> 00:09:17,670
But if I twist a little more the hand,

183
00:09:17,670 --> 00:09:20,120
I won't be seeing the thumb anymore.

184
00:09:20,120 --> 00:09:23,650
So the end will be harder to identify.

185
00:09:23,650 --> 00:09:27,570
That's a little detail, but
it will make the difference.

186
00:09:27,570 --> 00:09:30,580
So whenever you are
pausing your character,

187
00:09:30,580 --> 00:09:33,903
make sure you hit all
the notes in this video.

188
00:09:35,218 --> 00:09:37,480
Watch full line of action
that we have explained

189
00:09:37,480 --> 00:09:38,633
in the previous video.

190
00:09:39,922 --> 00:09:41,510
Watch for balance, make
sure that your character

191
00:09:41,510 --> 00:09:44,720
is not falling, especially
if he's turning.

192
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:48,840
Be very aware of the
importance of the silhouette.

193
00:09:48,840 --> 00:09:51,290
Watch for readability of the silhouette.

194
00:09:51,290 --> 00:09:55,380
Watch for simplicity versus
complexity in your silhouette.

195
00:09:55,380 --> 00:09:58,990
Use negative space, avoid the tangent.

196
00:09:58,990 --> 00:10:02,360
Break twinning by angling
a bit your character.

197
00:10:02,360 --> 00:10:04,710
Break perpendicular lines,

198
00:10:04,710 --> 00:10:07,180
avoid hiding part of your character.

199
00:10:07,180 --> 00:10:11,073
In the next video, we will
start building our first poses.
