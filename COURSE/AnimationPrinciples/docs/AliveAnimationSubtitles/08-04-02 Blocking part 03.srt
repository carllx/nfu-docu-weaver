1
00:00:00,640 --> 00:00:03,110
- Before I start working on the next pose,

2
00:00:03,110 --> 00:00:06,800
the anticipation for the
kick, I will pose the bag.

3
00:00:06,800 --> 00:00:10,060
Since our character is
pretty close to the bag

4
00:00:10,060 --> 00:00:13,740
just after the hook, and as
you will need a bit of room

5
00:00:13,740 --> 00:00:16,350
to execute the anticipation
of the switch key,

6
00:00:16,350 --> 00:00:18,697
we can rotate the bag farther away

7
00:00:18,697 --> 00:00:21,830
as the hook was a very powerful punch.

8
00:00:21,830 --> 00:00:24,620
Just make sure that you push the bag away

9
00:00:24,620 --> 00:00:26,440
in the right direction.

10
00:00:26,440 --> 00:00:28,010
While the jab and the cross

11
00:00:28,010 --> 00:00:31,130
were pushing the bag along the y-axis,

12
00:00:31,130 --> 00:00:34,820
the hook tend to push it along the x-axis.

13
00:00:34,820 --> 00:00:36,780
The second thing I'd like to note

14
00:00:36,780 --> 00:00:40,110
is that the left foot is now back

15
00:00:40,110 --> 00:00:41,760
on the stance of the character.

16
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:44,900
So it will be able to
throw the kick directly.

17
00:00:44,900 --> 00:00:47,440
As the benefit of the foot shuffle,

18
00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:49,770
is to get the kicking leg back

19
00:00:49,770 --> 00:00:51,400
and before you throw the kick.

20
00:00:51,400 --> 00:00:54,350
But if our character was to throw the kick

21
00:00:54,350 --> 00:00:57,940
from this position, it will be pretty weak

22
00:00:57,940 --> 00:01:02,100
because all his weight is
supported by the left leg.

23
00:01:02,100 --> 00:01:05,550
So can you throw a kick with your left leg

24
00:01:05,550 --> 00:01:08,640
if most of your weight is on this leg?

25
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:10,010
When you throw a hook,

26
00:01:10,010 --> 00:01:13,570
it's a classic to pivot
around your left leg.

27
00:01:13,570 --> 00:01:16,730
It's where you can reposition
your right leg back

28
00:01:16,730 --> 00:01:20,510
and return to what we
call the orthodox stance,

29
00:01:20,510 --> 00:01:24,660
where the left foot is the
leading foot so it's in front,

30
00:01:24,660 --> 00:01:28,320
and the right leg is the
rear foot and is in the back.

31
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:30,390
With this in mind, we can start working

32
00:01:30,390 --> 00:01:33,150
on our anticipation pose for the kick.

33
00:01:33,150 --> 00:01:36,120
And that's not a problem
if our feet position

34
00:01:36,120 --> 00:01:37,350
is not perfect.

35
00:01:37,350 --> 00:01:40,470
We will be able to reposition
our whole character

36
00:01:40,470 --> 00:01:42,240
later on if needed.

37
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:44,080
But as repeated many time,

38
00:01:44,080 --> 00:01:46,710
animation is not a linear workflow,

39
00:01:46,710 --> 00:01:49,000
and you will need to go back and forth

40
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,050
onto your different poses.

41
00:01:51,050 --> 00:01:54,360
Now focusing on the pose, as usual,

42
00:01:54,360 --> 00:01:56,800
I first moved the feet.

43
00:01:56,800 --> 00:01:59,150
And once I have my contact define,

44
00:01:59,150 --> 00:02:02,639
I can work on the toes
or root orientation.

45
00:02:02,639 --> 00:02:07,110
Here, fully have a look the
orientation of the feet.

46
00:02:07,110 --> 00:02:09,980
Look how the right foot is opened.

47
00:02:09,980 --> 00:02:13,460
By opening the right foot
to the outside at this way,

48
00:02:13,460 --> 00:02:16,940
it's gonna be way easier
to rotate the hips,

49
00:02:16,940 --> 00:02:21,270
to pull the left leg and
kick with full power.

50
00:02:21,270 --> 00:02:24,720
Now, I've looked to the
twisting of the whole torso.

51
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:28,780
The chest is twisting to
the right to its maximum

52
00:02:28,780 --> 00:02:30,620
and the left arm and left shoulder

53
00:02:30,620 --> 00:02:33,180
are also orientated this way.

54
00:02:33,180 --> 00:02:36,910
This allow to load energy before the kick

55
00:02:36,910 --> 00:02:39,410
and during the kick release,

56
00:02:39,410 --> 00:02:41,920
the arm will swing the opposite way.

57
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:45,580
By swinging left, the
arm will input energy

58
00:02:45,580 --> 00:02:49,150
into the hips and push
them to swing right,

59
00:02:49,150 --> 00:02:51,290
and pull the left leg forward.

60
00:02:51,290 --> 00:02:55,210
The weight of our character
is shifting to the right leg.

61
00:02:55,210 --> 00:02:56,640
Right foot is flat

62
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:59,660
while the left foot
heel is slightly raised.

63
00:02:59,660 --> 00:03:02,280
The whole shape of our character,

64
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:04,480
it's silhouette and line affection,

65
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:09,010
clearly finds that he's
going to kick forward

66
00:03:09,010 --> 00:03:11,550
and trying to raise his whole body.

67
00:03:11,550 --> 00:03:13,650
We now need to work on what I believe

68
00:03:13,650 --> 00:03:17,220
will be the strongest pose
of our whole animation,

69
00:03:17,220 --> 00:03:18,800
the kicking pose.

70
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:21,600
As usual, I've look to
the video reference.

71
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:25,600
Look at how the right food
rotates during the heat.

72
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:27,870
Also, the right heel is raised.

73
00:03:27,870 --> 00:03:31,460
It helps rotating around the right foot,

74
00:03:31,460 --> 00:03:34,550
but it also allows to bring more power

75
00:03:34,550 --> 00:03:37,797
to the kick because you
are both pushing forward

76
00:03:37,797 --> 00:03:40,260
by the twist of the whole body

77
00:03:40,260 --> 00:03:42,550
and pushing hip with the supporting leg.

78
00:03:42,550 --> 00:03:45,500
I've immediately decided to push the pose

79
00:03:45,500 --> 00:03:46,852
and kick higher.

80
00:03:46,852 --> 00:03:48,480
This will give a better

81
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:51,650
and more dynamical shape to our character.

82
00:03:51,650 --> 00:03:55,020
Also, it's a pretty
classic move from the Thai.

83
00:03:55,020 --> 00:03:57,670
Instead of trying to hit the rib cage,

84
00:03:57,670 --> 00:03:59,700
they often kick into the arm

85
00:03:59,700 --> 00:04:02,740
so that will drop your
guard because of the pain.

86
00:04:02,740 --> 00:04:06,280
If you watch more reference
of roundhouse kicking,

87
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:08,650
the first mistake to avoid is to think

88
00:04:08,650 --> 00:04:11,100
that the leg is kicking upward.

89
00:04:11,100 --> 00:04:13,120
Powerful kick should be thrown

90
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:15,270
as horizontal as possible,

91
00:04:15,270 --> 00:04:19,340
or even by getting down
during the heat pose.

92
00:04:19,340 --> 00:04:21,700
So you need to give the proper orientation

93
00:04:21,700 --> 00:04:22,970
to the kicking foot.

94
00:04:22,970 --> 00:04:27,540
The top of the kicking foot
should be whether horizontal

95
00:04:27,540 --> 00:04:30,690
or even pointing a little downward,

96
00:04:30,690 --> 00:04:34,020
and so should be the
knee of your character.

97
00:04:34,020 --> 00:04:36,790
Also, we are not kicking with the foot,

98
00:04:36,790 --> 00:04:38,750
but we are kicking with the shin

99
00:04:38,750 --> 00:04:40,950
because it's way harder.

100
00:04:40,950 --> 00:04:42,970
Think of the leg as a saw

101
00:04:42,970 --> 00:04:46,030
that need to cut through the bag.

102
00:04:46,030 --> 00:04:48,420
Here's another concept
that is very important

103
00:04:48,420 --> 00:04:49,940
into our kicking pose

104
00:04:49,940 --> 00:04:53,780
is that we are not snapping
onto the surface of the bag,

105
00:04:53,780 --> 00:04:56,770
but we are trying to kick through the bag.

106
00:04:56,770 --> 00:05:00,130
So the whole body is
leaning into the kick.

107
00:05:00,130 --> 00:05:02,710
And so, the leg is not fully extended,

108
00:05:02,710 --> 00:05:05,520
giving a bit of additional range

109
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:07,620
to push the bag even further.

110
00:05:07,620 --> 00:05:10,610
As usual, don't forget to
rotate around your character

111
00:05:10,610 --> 00:05:13,780
to make sure that the pose
work from every angle,

112
00:05:13,780 --> 00:05:16,280
that the line affection
is clearly defined,

113
00:05:16,280 --> 00:05:19,000
and that you push the
pose as much as you can

114
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:23,100
to sell the impact and to
communicate, as well as possible,

115
00:05:23,100 --> 00:05:24,560
the will of your character.

116
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:27,140
This is also the pose where the bag

117
00:05:27,140 --> 00:05:29,240
will be the most deformed,

118
00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:32,800
as it was a swinging back
towards the character.

119
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:34,550
And we are now applying

120
00:05:34,550 --> 00:05:37,800
a very brutal force the opposite way.

121
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:39,470
While I'd like the animation

122
00:05:39,470 --> 00:05:41,520
to be at least semi-realistical

123
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:44,060
because this is a better way to learn

124
00:05:44,060 --> 00:05:47,430
than going fully stylized directly.

125
00:05:47,430 --> 00:05:49,670
That's perfectly fine to exaggerate

126
00:05:49,670 --> 00:05:51,960
what's happening with the punching bag.

127
00:05:51,960 --> 00:05:55,180
So while the character will
be recovering from the kick,

128
00:05:55,180 --> 00:05:58,500
I think that will be great
to sell power of the kick.

129
00:05:58,500 --> 00:06:01,780
That instead of just
swinging the punching bag,

130
00:06:01,780 --> 00:06:03,150
we throw it away.

131
00:06:03,150 --> 00:06:05,110
I will swing it a lot.

132
00:06:05,110 --> 00:06:08,190
I will even create a nice curve to it.

133
00:06:08,190 --> 00:06:10,030
And then, I will simply move

134
00:06:10,030 --> 00:06:12,840
the root controller of the bag.

135
00:06:12,840 --> 00:06:15,550
After the kick, we can
see that the free fighters

136
00:06:15,550 --> 00:06:17,140
are taking a step back,

137
00:06:17,140 --> 00:06:20,440
and then transition into their idle pose.

138
00:06:20,440 --> 00:06:23,380
First, they pivot back from the kick

139
00:06:23,380 --> 00:06:24,830
into the contact pose,

140
00:06:24,830 --> 00:06:28,100
with the weight mostly on the right leg.

141
00:06:28,100 --> 00:06:30,470
And this is the pose
we are going to build.

142
00:06:30,470 --> 00:06:34,030
We could consider this as
some kind of down pose,

143
00:06:34,030 --> 00:06:35,600
if it was a work cycle.

144
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:38,190
The character is pretty relaxed

145
00:06:38,190 --> 00:06:42,000
and slowly shifting his
weight back onto the left leg,

146
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,960
the one that has just kicked.

147
00:06:43,960 --> 00:06:48,600
But the weight is still
mostly upon the right leg

148
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:52,800
while the right foot has been
rotated, it doesn't move.

149
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:55,120
I haven't changed its location.

150
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:57,510
Once I've roughly posed my feet,

151
00:06:57,510 --> 00:06:58,830
I will pose the torso.

152
00:06:58,830 --> 00:07:02,570
And as I did for most
of the previous poses,

153
00:07:02,570 --> 00:07:05,880
I will first console any transformation

154
00:07:05,880 --> 00:07:08,310
on the chest and hips controller.

155
00:07:08,310 --> 00:07:12,110
As usual, take the time to
look at the line of action

156
00:07:12,110 --> 00:07:13,630
on the reference pose.

157
00:07:13,630 --> 00:07:15,650
It's more subtle than usual

158
00:07:15,650 --> 00:07:18,250
because it's a slow paced movement,

159
00:07:18,250 --> 00:07:20,230
but it is still there.

160
00:07:20,230 --> 00:07:22,890
Watch the position of
the center of gravity

161
00:07:22,890 --> 00:07:24,310
compared to the feet.

162
00:07:24,310 --> 00:07:28,280
It's slightly more on
top of the right foot.

163
00:07:28,280 --> 00:07:30,590
And finally, watch for extra details

164
00:07:30,590 --> 00:07:33,660
like the hips and chest orientation,

165
00:07:33,660 --> 00:07:35,230
the line of the shoulder,

166
00:07:35,230 --> 00:07:38,230
the position of the
hands, their orientation.

167
00:07:38,230 --> 00:07:42,260
Every detail that will help
you to identify the pose

168
00:07:42,260 --> 00:07:44,603
and reproduce it at your side.

169
00:07:45,560 --> 00:07:47,940
The final pose will be the idle pose,

170
00:07:47,940 --> 00:07:49,760
and it's gonna be pretty close

171
00:07:49,760 --> 00:07:51,550
to what we have on frame five.

172
00:07:51,550 --> 00:07:53,400
But before I pose the character,

173
00:07:53,400 --> 00:07:56,010
I'm working on the punching bag.

174
00:07:56,010 --> 00:08:00,310
I'm just trying to guess where
it would land after the kick.

175
00:08:00,310 --> 00:08:01,760
Walking from the front view

176
00:08:01,760 --> 00:08:04,441
and scrubbing through the
different poses of the bag

177
00:08:04,441 --> 00:08:07,940
will help me figure out its orientation

178
00:08:07,940 --> 00:08:09,440
when it's flying away.

179
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:11,320
That's not super important

180
00:08:11,320 --> 00:08:14,100
if the current pose is not perfect,

181
00:08:14,100 --> 00:08:16,910
as we will use later on motion path

182
00:08:16,910 --> 00:08:20,150
to better track the position of the bag.

183
00:08:20,150 --> 00:08:21,820
Regarding the character pose,

184
00:08:21,820 --> 00:08:23,960
I won't dive that much into detail

185
00:08:23,960 --> 00:08:26,620
because it a pose that is very similar

186
00:08:26,620 --> 00:08:28,970
to the very first pose we have build.

187
00:08:28,970 --> 00:08:32,360
The only specific tip
you have to check here

188
00:08:32,360 --> 00:08:36,372
is that I've only pulled
the right leg back

189
00:08:36,372 --> 00:08:41,070
because the left leg is not
supposed to change location.

190
00:08:41,070 --> 00:08:45,470
Because while it's getting
back into idle pose,

191
00:08:45,470 --> 00:08:48,510
his shifting his whole
weight on the left leg

192
00:08:48,510 --> 00:08:50,790
to pull the right leg back.

193
00:08:50,790 --> 00:08:54,860
And once the right leg
will be settled back,

194
00:08:54,860 --> 00:08:57,950
the weight will shift onto the right leg.

195
00:08:57,950 --> 00:09:01,400
And so the weight is
removed from the left foot,

196
00:09:01,400 --> 00:09:06,210
so we can slightly raise
the heel into the idle pose,

197
00:09:06,210 --> 00:09:10,640
with the left leg ready to
block any incoming kick.

198
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:14,320
The incoming video will
be a slow paced time-lapse

199
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:17,990
of the whole blocking
process we've done so far.

200
00:09:17,990 --> 00:09:19,620
And in the further video,

201
00:09:19,620 --> 00:09:23,213
we are going to continue
on blocking our animation.
