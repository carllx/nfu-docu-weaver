1
00:00:00,860 --> 00:00:03,300
- [Presenter] Let's have a
deeper look to the graph editor.

2
00:00:03,300 --> 00:00:04,370
In the previous video,

3
00:00:04,370 --> 00:00:05,913
we have seen that those curve

4
00:00:05,913 --> 00:00:08,980
are just a value evolving over time,

5
00:00:08,980 --> 00:00:12,330
and those controller point
are the keyframe values.

6
00:00:12,330 --> 00:00:15,600
Each of those controllers have two handles

7
00:00:15,600 --> 00:00:18,520
that can be used to change the way

8
00:00:18,520 --> 00:00:20,960
the interpolation is set.

9
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:23,177
And they work exactly as handles

10
00:00:23,177 --> 00:00:27,850
will do whenever you are editing
a 3D curve in the 3D view.

11
00:00:27,850 --> 00:00:32,490
Those vector handles has
different pre-set behavior.

12
00:00:32,490 --> 00:00:34,930
We can access them by pressing the V key

13
00:00:34,930 --> 00:00:37,910
or going into the Key option of the editor

14
00:00:37,910 --> 00:00:39,480
of the graph editor.

15
00:00:39,480 --> 00:00:43,098
By default, all the keys
are set to auto clamp.

16
00:00:43,098 --> 00:00:47,170
You can see the handle type
of the selected keyframe

17
00:00:47,170 --> 00:00:49,440
in the F-curve panel.

18
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:52,043
When the keyframe is set to auto clamp,

19
00:00:52,043 --> 00:00:54,380
Blender will try to interpolate

20
00:00:54,380 --> 00:00:57,730
from one key to the other
in the smoothest fashion.

21
00:00:57,730 --> 00:01:02,170
But as soon as I try to move
this key beyond the previews

22
00:01:02,170 --> 00:01:05,910
of the next frame, the
handles will become flat.

23
00:01:05,910 --> 00:01:09,080
So, it's clamping the value of the curve

24
00:01:09,080 --> 00:01:12,580
to the current keyframe,
avoiding any overshoot.

25
00:01:12,580 --> 00:01:14,530
If we swtich to automatic,

26
00:01:14,530 --> 00:01:17,300
we will have kind of the same behavior,

27
00:01:17,300 --> 00:01:20,090
Blender will try to keep
as much interpolation

28
00:01:20,090 --> 00:01:22,770
between the previews and next frame,

29
00:01:22,770 --> 00:01:26,690
but in this case, it
won't avoid the overshoot.

30
00:01:26,690 --> 00:01:28,990
Curve wise, an overshoot is a bump

31
00:01:28,990 --> 00:01:30,330
in the shape of the curve,

32
00:01:30,330 --> 00:01:33,850
making the value jumping
up or jumping down.

33
00:01:33,850 --> 00:01:35,870
This is not a handle type I use that much

34
00:01:35,870 --> 00:01:38,110
because sometime I feel like it's behavior

35
00:01:38,110 --> 00:01:39,620
is a bit unexpected.

36
00:01:39,620 --> 00:01:40,880
As explained before,

37
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:43,640
handle type are set to
auto clamp by default,

38
00:01:43,640 --> 00:01:47,620
but as soon as I try to scale
the handle or rotate them,

39
00:01:47,620 --> 00:01:50,270
you can see that it switched to aligned.

40
00:01:50,270 --> 00:01:52,458
The orientation in scale of the handle

41
00:01:52,458 --> 00:01:56,560
are no longer controlled by
Blender, but by yourself,

42
00:01:56,560 --> 00:01:58,700
but Blender will keep the previews

43
00:01:58,700 --> 00:02:01,532
and next handle aligned
one with the other.

44
00:02:01,532 --> 00:02:05,180
This allows you to keep a
smoothest curve interpolation,

45
00:02:05,180 --> 00:02:07,790
but if I switch the handle type to free,

46
00:02:07,790 --> 00:02:11,045
then each handle can be manipulated freely

47
00:02:11,045 --> 00:02:14,340
without caring about the
previews of next handle,

48
00:02:14,340 --> 00:02:16,420
allowing us to break the curve

49
00:02:16,420 --> 00:02:19,300
which in a lot of case can be very handy.

50
00:02:19,300 --> 00:02:21,327
The final handle type we have to see

51
00:02:21,327 --> 00:02:23,600
is the vector handle type.

52
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:25,040
As soon as we select it,

53
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:28,260
the curve will break into a odd angle.

54
00:02:28,260 --> 00:02:30,770
Each angle will point individually

55
00:02:30,770 --> 00:02:33,010
to the previews on next keyframe

56
00:02:33,010 --> 00:02:36,370
and as soon as I try to
manipulate one of the handle,

57
00:02:36,370 --> 00:02:38,600
it will switch to free mode.

58
00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:40,940
It's a very useful type of handle

59
00:02:40,940 --> 00:02:44,700
whenever you want to rapidly
create a linear interpolation.

60
00:02:44,700 --> 00:02:47,220
Setting to consecutive keyframe to vector

61
00:02:47,220 --> 00:02:49,725
will create a linear interpolation

62
00:02:49,725 --> 00:02:52,160
and then, the cool thing
about vector handles

63
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:54,647
is that whenever we are
moving the keyframe,

64
00:02:54,647 --> 00:02:58,259
they will always be
pointing one at the other.

65
00:02:58,259 --> 00:03:02,820
I use this type of handle
a lot for impact frame.

66
00:03:02,820 --> 00:03:06,240
If we change the interpolation
mode of our curve

67
00:03:06,240 --> 00:03:08,010
to constant or linear,

68
00:03:08,010 --> 00:03:10,940
we won't get any access to the handles,

69
00:03:10,940 --> 00:03:13,860
because the interpolation is pre-made.

70
00:03:13,860 --> 00:03:17,470
It's where there no
interpolation or a linear one.

71
00:03:17,470 --> 00:03:20,590
Adding handles doesn't
make sense in this case.

72
00:03:20,590 --> 00:03:22,580
In the previous video we have seen that

73
00:03:22,580 --> 00:03:26,130
we can double click onto a
channel to select the curve,

74
00:03:26,130 --> 00:03:27,914
we can box select, press A,

75
00:03:27,914 --> 00:03:32,150
press control shift and click
before on after a keyframe

76
00:03:32,150 --> 00:03:35,650
to select all the
previews on next keyframe.

77
00:03:35,650 --> 00:03:37,290
If we click the little checkbox,

78
00:03:37,290 --> 00:03:39,810
it will deactivate the current channel.

79
00:03:39,810 --> 00:03:42,710
Now you can see that the Z
location on the character

80
00:03:42,710 --> 00:03:46,010
is no longer animated and
is not jumping anymore,

81
00:03:46,010 --> 00:03:47,580
which is kind of fun.

82
00:03:47,580 --> 00:03:50,210
The wrench icon allows us to activate

83
00:03:50,210 --> 00:03:52,640
or deactivate curve modifier.

84
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:54,520
To add the modifier to a curve

85
00:03:54,520 --> 00:03:58,130
you just need to select one
control point of the curve,

86
00:03:58,130 --> 00:04:02,550
then go into the end panel
and switch to modifiers.

87
00:04:02,550 --> 00:04:04,730
There are a lot of different modifier,

88
00:04:04,730 --> 00:04:08,480
let's just add a noise modifier
to understand what they do.

89
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:10,140
As the modeling modifier,

90
00:04:10,140 --> 00:04:12,559
you can use them to procedurally generate

91
00:04:12,559 --> 00:04:15,200
new behavior for your item.

92
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:18,870
The noise modifier is super
cool to create camera shake

93
00:04:18,870 --> 00:04:21,290
or to bring texture to your animation.

94
00:04:21,290 --> 00:04:25,060
The lock icon will allow you
to lock the current channel,

95
00:04:25,060 --> 00:04:28,420
making any further modification impossible

96
00:04:28,420 --> 00:04:29,943
until you disable it.

97
00:04:31,150 --> 00:04:34,400
The magnifying glass on the
top left will allow you to

98
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:36,440
search for specific channels.

99
00:04:36,440 --> 00:04:39,800
It's very handy whenever you
want to isolate a channel

100
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:43,170
like the location channel
without having to hide

101
00:04:43,170 --> 00:04:45,380
everything else then un-hide everything.

102
00:04:45,380 --> 00:04:47,524
Just type what you want to work on,

103
00:04:47,524 --> 00:04:49,573
then everything else will disappear.

104
00:04:49,573 --> 00:04:52,610
All the previous navigation
showed that we have seen

105
00:04:52,610 --> 00:04:55,110
when we have studied the
timeline of the same,

106
00:04:55,110 --> 00:04:57,456
the home key will frame everything,

107
00:04:57,456 --> 00:05:01,830
the dot key on the notepad
will zoom into the selection

108
00:05:01,830 --> 00:05:05,940
and you can use the P key
to set a temporary preview

109
00:05:05,940 --> 00:05:07,743
range into your animation.

110
00:05:07,743 --> 00:05:09,203
Alt and P will clear.

111
00:05:10,750 --> 00:05:13,930
When working with curve,
we are working with values,

112
00:05:13,930 --> 00:05:16,700
and fortunately those
values can vary a lot.

113
00:05:16,700 --> 00:05:19,680
Some curve will have a
small arrange of value,

114
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:23,040
while other curve might
have a big range of value.

115
00:05:23,040 --> 00:05:25,310
And in this case, you
can see me struggling,

116
00:05:25,310 --> 00:05:28,660
going back and forth to
select into different values.

117
00:05:28,660 --> 00:05:31,149
The normalize option allow us to convert

118
00:05:31,149 --> 00:05:33,150
to this big range of value

119
00:05:33,150 --> 00:05:36,010
to a range that goes
from minus one to one.

120
00:05:36,010 --> 00:05:38,580
So it doesn't change
the value of the curve,

121
00:05:38,580 --> 00:05:42,030
it changed the way the value is displayed.

122
00:05:42,030 --> 00:05:45,008
It makes it a bit handier to work on

123
00:05:45,008 --> 00:05:47,280
the higher range of values.

124
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:49,490
If I disable the auto update,

125
00:05:49,490 --> 00:05:52,730
I can move any value beyond the threshold

126
00:05:52,730 --> 00:05:54,540
of minus one and plus one.

127
00:05:54,540 --> 00:05:57,050
Then I will add the vision
of the modified curve,

128
00:05:57,050 --> 00:06:01,340
but if I enable it, as soon
as I move beyond minus one,

129
00:06:01,340 --> 00:06:04,580
the curve is not canceling the move,

130
00:06:04,580 --> 00:06:07,180
but it's re-updating it's position

131
00:06:07,180 --> 00:06:10,266
into a minus one to plus one range.

132
00:06:10,266 --> 00:06:13,888
So as you can see, when I
move the extreme position,

133
00:06:13,888 --> 00:06:18,660
it does quite change the shape
of the curve in the inside.

134
00:06:18,660 --> 00:06:19,910
I don't use it that much,

135
00:06:19,910 --> 00:06:23,181
but it will make more
sense if you manipulate it.

136
00:06:23,181 --> 00:06:27,153
By default you will see the
curve of the transform channel

137
00:06:27,153 --> 00:06:30,260
of the displayed animated object,

138
00:06:30,260 --> 00:06:33,140
in this case, the
controller of my character.

139
00:06:33,140 --> 00:06:36,300
If I hide everything but
those few controllers,

140
00:06:36,300 --> 00:06:41,300
you can see that I only have
those listed in my graph edit.

141
00:06:41,510 --> 00:06:44,080
When activated, the selection filter,

142
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:48,200
only selected object will
show their animation curve.

143
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:50,320
When enabling to show hidden,

144
00:06:50,320 --> 00:06:54,750
it will show absolutely every
control channels available,

145
00:06:54,750 --> 00:06:57,230
whether you hide those controller or not,

146
00:06:57,230 --> 00:06:59,910
the curves will still be displayed.

147
00:06:59,910 --> 00:07:03,680
The only show arrows
options will show you curves

148
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:07,530
or keyframes that are no
longer assigned to anything.

149
00:07:07,530 --> 00:07:10,630
Can happen sometime during
whenever you delete a bone

150
00:07:10,630 --> 00:07:14,710
in edit mode and you didn't
clean the animation later on.

151
00:07:14,710 --> 00:07:17,510
It's very specific and we
don't really need to know

152
00:07:17,510 --> 00:07:19,490
more about this right now.

153
00:07:19,490 --> 00:07:23,560
The ghost curve option will
display you the previous

154
00:07:23,560 --> 00:07:25,843
unedited shape of the curve.

155
00:07:25,843 --> 00:07:29,020
This is something I never
use, to be really honest,

156
00:07:29,020 --> 00:07:33,070
but it can be useful for you
if you find any interest in it.

157
00:07:33,070 --> 00:07:36,510
Click back on the crossed
button to get rid of it.

158
00:07:36,510 --> 00:07:39,610
I won't go through the
whole effect of menus

159
00:07:39,610 --> 00:07:43,350
since there are a lot of options
that are self explanatory.

160
00:07:43,350 --> 00:07:46,560
I believe this is cool if
you are working on multiple

161
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:50,360
object at once for motion
design, for example,

162
00:07:50,360 --> 00:07:52,620
and you want to clean your selection.

163
00:07:52,620 --> 00:07:54,734
They are different ways you can snap

164
00:07:54,734 --> 00:07:57,360
your different keys on the grid.

165
00:07:57,360 --> 00:08:00,083
By default, it's set to nearest frame,

166
00:08:00,083 --> 00:08:05,083
meaning that whenever you're
moving your key on the X axis,

167
00:08:05,183 --> 00:08:08,620
it will snap right onto a frame.

168
00:08:08,620 --> 00:08:12,020
This is the option I use 99% of the time.

169
00:08:12,020 --> 00:08:16,400
If I use the second step, it
will snap on every second.

170
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:19,420
So, in our case, every 30 frames.

171
00:08:19,420 --> 00:08:24,030
In the view option in the header,
I can enable show seconds.

172
00:08:24,030 --> 00:08:28,270
Since my document is based
to 30 frame per second,

173
00:08:28,270 --> 00:08:30,370
whenever I try to move the key,

174
00:08:30,370 --> 00:08:32,967
you can see that it's not to frame 30.

175
00:08:32,967 --> 00:08:35,640
You have seen previously that pressing M,

176
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:38,120
we can add a marker on the timeline.

177
00:08:38,120 --> 00:08:40,650
You can add them also in the graph editor

178
00:08:40,650 --> 00:08:44,200
because the graph editor
is just another version,

179
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:46,070
in a way, of the timeline.

180
00:08:46,070 --> 00:08:49,950
And if I then switch to
snapped to nearest marker

181
00:08:49,950 --> 00:08:52,380
as soon as I will move my key,

182
00:08:52,380 --> 00:08:54,360
it will snap on the nearest marker.

183
00:08:54,360 --> 00:08:57,380
Finally, you can get rid of the auto snap

184
00:08:57,380 --> 00:08:59,470
switching to no auto snap.

185
00:08:59,470 --> 00:09:02,610
It can be useful in
certain case when you are,

186
00:09:02,610 --> 00:09:05,550
for example, scaling a wall animation

187
00:09:05,550 --> 00:09:07,740
and you don't want every keyframe

188
00:09:07,740 --> 00:09:09,820
to snap to the nearest frame,

189
00:09:09,820 --> 00:09:13,240
but don't forget that
Blender will read the value

190
00:09:13,240 --> 00:09:16,060
on one frame, not reading between.

191
00:09:16,060 --> 00:09:19,830
Be cautious with it because
the value read by Blender

192
00:09:19,830 --> 00:09:22,450
might not be the one on your key,

193
00:09:22,450 --> 00:09:24,123
this can be a bit confusing.

194
00:09:24,980 --> 00:09:26,390
As in the 3D veiwport,

195
00:09:26,390 --> 00:09:29,040
you can use different kind of pivot point

196
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:30,620
to edit your curve.

197
00:09:30,620 --> 00:09:34,790
The bounding box center
will take the most extreme

198
00:09:34,790 --> 00:09:36,380
keys you have selected

199
00:09:36,380 --> 00:09:39,930
and it will set the pivot
point right in the middle.

200
00:09:39,930 --> 00:09:40,970
As in the 3D view,

201
00:09:40,970 --> 00:09:42,960
you can see this dotted line showing

202
00:09:42,960 --> 00:09:47,370
where is the pivot point
compared to your mouse cursor.

203
00:09:47,370 --> 00:09:50,610
The 2D cursor, as act the 3D cursor,

204
00:09:50,610 --> 00:09:54,640
you can place it by shift
right clicking on the grid

205
00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:58,320
and it's position is defined
by those two blue lines,

206
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:00,763
the play at and a given value.

207
00:10:01,830 --> 00:10:03,320
With my key selected,

208
00:10:03,320 --> 00:10:07,520
if I press S and Y to scale on the Y axis,

209
00:10:07,520 --> 00:10:10,551
you can see my keys are pointing toward

210
00:10:10,551 --> 00:10:12,960
the horizontal blue line.

211
00:10:12,960 --> 00:10:15,730
This is a good way to set the same value

212
00:10:15,730 --> 00:10:18,590
to several keyframes at once.

213
00:10:18,590 --> 00:10:22,960
The individual origin pivot
point is the one I use the most.

214
00:10:22,960 --> 00:10:25,910
Each keyframe becomes independent

215
00:10:25,910 --> 00:10:28,236
and whenever your scaling or rotating,

216
00:10:28,236 --> 00:10:32,390
it's manipulating each
keyframe handles separately,

217
00:10:32,390 --> 00:10:35,260
allowing you to scale
them and manipulate them

218
00:10:35,260 --> 00:10:38,550
without moving them onto the timeline.

219
00:10:38,550 --> 00:10:41,440
Rotating the keys with
the bonding box option

220
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:43,870
also move them on the timeline.

221
00:10:43,870 --> 00:10:45,450
As in mesh edit mode,

222
00:10:45,450 --> 00:10:48,393
you can activate a proportional editing.

223
00:10:48,393 --> 00:10:50,800
As soon as I edit one of my keyframe

224
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:54,000
I can see the aerial
(indistinct) of the falloff

225
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,370
and using the mouse wheel,

226
00:10:55,370 --> 00:10:58,310
I can increase or decrease the size

227
00:10:58,310 --> 00:10:59,730
of the area of the effect.

228
00:10:59,730 --> 00:11:01,210
I don't use it that much,

229
00:11:01,210 --> 00:11:04,168
but it can be very handy
whenever you are dealing with

230
00:11:04,168 --> 00:11:08,443
high density keyframed
curve like baked animation

231
00:11:08,443 --> 00:11:10,070
or motion capture.

232
00:11:10,070 --> 00:11:11,770
As the mesh editing falloff,

233
00:11:11,770 --> 00:11:14,490
it comes with different
curves that will behave

234
00:11:14,490 --> 00:11:18,370
in a different manner whenever
you are moving your point.

235
00:11:18,370 --> 00:11:21,833
You can access new display
option in the view panel.

236
00:11:21,833 --> 00:11:24,900
Whether you want to
show or not the sidebar

237
00:11:24,900 --> 00:11:27,110
you can access it by pressing N.

238
00:11:27,110 --> 00:11:30,890
You can enable the operator
box that is available

239
00:11:30,890 --> 00:11:32,600
in the 3D veiwport too,

240
00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:35,910
but I don't think it's that
useful on the graph edit.

241
00:11:35,910 --> 00:11:38,047
The show cursor option will hide

242
00:11:38,047 --> 00:11:42,020
or unhide the original
line of the 2D cursor.

243
00:11:42,020 --> 00:11:44,770
You can activate the show sliders option

244
00:11:44,770 --> 00:11:47,561
if you want to access
the value of the keyframe

245
00:11:47,561 --> 00:11:49,960
directly in the channels panel.

246
00:11:49,960 --> 00:11:53,050
I never use it, but it definitely is handy

247
00:11:53,050 --> 00:11:55,430
if you want to fine tweak your values.

248
00:11:55,430 --> 00:11:57,470
You will find other option to display

249
00:11:57,470 --> 00:11:59,820
or not the handles of the keyframe,

250
00:11:59,820 --> 00:12:02,630
but I do recommend you
to keep them displayed

251
00:12:02,630 --> 00:12:06,761
and I also advise you to only
display the selected keyframe

252
00:12:06,761 --> 00:12:10,590
in those or your graph editor
will rapidly become a mess.

253
00:12:10,590 --> 00:12:13,690
To summarize, we have
seen that we can change

254
00:12:13,690 --> 00:12:17,960
the handle type of our
curve using the V key.

255
00:12:17,960 --> 00:12:22,570
We can use the normalize
option to display a broad range

256
00:12:22,570 --> 00:12:27,570
of curved values into a minus
one to one range curve value.

257
00:12:28,440 --> 00:12:31,600
We can see that through the
graph editor we can hide

258
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:34,700
or unhide curve, deactivate them,

259
00:12:34,700 --> 00:12:37,820
lock them or even add the modifiers.

260
00:12:37,820 --> 00:12:41,520
As in the 3D viewport, we
can use different pivot point

261
00:12:41,520 --> 00:12:43,330
and constraint axis.

262
00:12:43,330 --> 00:12:45,180
We can use selection filter

263
00:12:45,180 --> 00:12:48,590
or quick search to make
our selection easier.

264
00:12:48,590 --> 00:12:50,730
We can use proportional editing

265
00:12:50,730 --> 00:12:53,310
to edit multiple keys at once.
