1
00:00:00,200 --> 00:00:02,890
- [Instructor] Now that the
torso root of our character

2
00:00:02,890 --> 00:00:04,790
and the feet are polished,

3
00:00:04,790 --> 00:00:08,360
we can start polishing the
whole chain of the torso,

4
00:00:08,360 --> 00:00:10,580
the hips, the chest, neck and head.

5
00:00:10,580 --> 00:00:13,870
As usual, I will start
with the hips rotation.

6
00:00:13,870 --> 00:00:16,460
And as explained in the
previous animation chunk,

7
00:00:16,460 --> 00:00:19,350
I'm mainly following
the motion of the feet

8
00:00:19,350 --> 00:00:22,370
to figure out the rotation of the hips.

9
00:00:22,370 --> 00:00:26,470
Also since we add a
very detailed blocking,

10
00:00:26,470 --> 00:00:29,160
generally the stage is pretty fast

11
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:33,410
as we mostly have to smooth
out the motion of the hips

12
00:00:33,410 --> 00:00:36,080
based on what is already blocked.

13
00:00:36,080 --> 00:00:38,590
For example, here I'm slightly reducing

14
00:00:38,590 --> 00:00:40,040
the tilting of the hips

15
00:00:40,040 --> 00:00:42,770
so that they are more facing the character

16
00:00:42,770 --> 00:00:46,750
and facing the orientation
of the center of gravity,

17
00:00:46,750 --> 00:00:48,890
because this is the transition motion

18
00:00:48,890 --> 00:00:52,590
and our character is
settling just after the hook.

19
00:00:52,590 --> 00:00:54,780
Then I'm reworking the step back.

20
00:00:54,780 --> 00:00:58,600
So I make sure that the character
hips don't tilt too much

21
00:00:58,600 --> 00:01:00,430
and it looks too feminine.

22
00:01:00,430 --> 00:01:03,310
I'm also making sure that the hips twist

23
00:01:03,310 --> 00:01:04,800
follow the right leg.

24
00:01:04,800 --> 00:01:07,540
But remember that the
hips are pulling the legs

25
00:01:07,540 --> 00:01:09,880
that are not in contact with the ground

26
00:01:09,880 --> 00:01:13,700
while the supporting leg
are pushing on the hips.

27
00:01:13,700 --> 00:01:16,620
This should gives you a broad idea

28
00:01:16,620 --> 00:01:19,030
on how to tilt the hips.

29
00:01:19,030 --> 00:01:20,740
The character is pushing for the jump,

30
00:01:20,740 --> 00:01:24,200
I make sure that the bit
is oriented backward.

31
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:27,270
The hips are oriented
forward towards the groin

32
00:01:27,270 --> 00:01:28,960
during the anticipation

33
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:31,860
and oriented backward toward the bit

34
00:01:31,860 --> 00:01:33,200
during the pushing pose.

35
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:36,980
Then I will fix the overall
orientation of the hips

36
00:01:36,980 --> 00:01:40,180
during the jump as they look delayed here.

37
00:01:40,180 --> 00:01:41,900
Whenever I'm working on the hips,

38
00:01:41,900 --> 00:01:43,740
it's often a matter of feeling

39
00:01:43,740 --> 00:01:46,020
whether the pose looks right or not,

40
00:01:46,020 --> 00:01:48,150
that's pretty hard to explain.

41
00:01:48,150 --> 00:01:50,250
Hopefully when you're watching this video,

42
00:01:50,250 --> 00:01:53,960
you can see the improvement
whenever I'm moving a key

43
00:01:53,960 --> 00:01:56,870
over the different rotation axis.

44
00:01:56,870 --> 00:02:00,230
One part that definitely
needed some refinement

45
00:02:00,230 --> 00:02:01,660
is the kicking part.

46
00:02:01,660 --> 00:02:06,580
As I have initially blocked
a very odd recoil of the hips

47
00:02:06,580 --> 00:02:09,960
and it generates a very odd visual glitch.

48
00:02:09,960 --> 00:02:12,010
You can see the difference of rotation

49
00:02:12,010 --> 00:02:15,100
between frame 79 and frame 80.

50
00:02:15,100 --> 00:02:19,630
There is a big jump in the
value of the Z quaternion curve.

51
00:02:19,630 --> 00:02:23,410
And so what I've decided
is to average the value

52
00:02:23,410 --> 00:02:27,660
over frame 80 and switch on frame 81.

53
00:02:27,660 --> 00:02:29,520
Having this big change of value

54
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:32,010
over two frames instead of one

55
00:02:32,010 --> 00:02:34,350
really improved the animation in the end.

56
00:02:34,350 --> 00:02:36,510
From there, here you can see the hips

57
00:02:36,510 --> 00:02:38,360
are really twisted backward,

58
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:40,340
pulling the left leg.

59
00:02:40,340 --> 00:02:44,230
And then it was just about
tweaking the existing curve

60
00:02:44,230 --> 00:02:47,050
as we had no extreme motion,

61
00:02:47,050 --> 00:02:51,780
making sure that the hips tilt
up upon the supporting leg,

62
00:02:51,780 --> 00:02:55,110
making sure that the
twisting follows the foot

63
00:02:55,110 --> 00:02:58,780
that was in error whenever the
character is stepping back.

64
00:02:58,780 --> 00:03:02,330
The chest was a little more
interesting to work on.

65
00:03:02,330 --> 00:03:05,340
Not that it is more
important than the hips,

66
00:03:05,340 --> 00:03:08,050
but visually it creates more variation

67
00:03:08,050 --> 00:03:09,830
in the shape of the character.

68
00:03:09,830 --> 00:03:11,680
And during this polishing stage,

69
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:13,880
I will be able to push even more

70
00:03:13,880 --> 00:03:16,550
the pose of the anticipation of the kick

71
00:03:16,550 --> 00:03:18,140
and the kick itself.

72
00:03:18,140 --> 00:03:21,950
On the initial part of this
chunk, just after the hook,

73
00:03:21,950 --> 00:03:24,840
I'm tracking the axis
from the base of the neck,

74
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:28,200
and I will mainly make the chest drag

75
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:31,520
based on the center of gravity motion.

76
00:03:31,520 --> 00:03:34,990
So whenever the center
of gravity is moving up,

77
00:03:34,990 --> 00:03:37,890
I will slightly lean
the character forward.

78
00:03:37,890 --> 00:03:41,400
Whenever the center of gravity
is twisting to the right,

79
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:44,920
I will slightly twist
the chest to the left

80
00:03:44,920 --> 00:03:48,470
so that there is a bit of
delay in the chest motion

81
00:03:48,470 --> 00:03:52,740
compared to the center of
gravity and the leading hips.

82
00:03:52,740 --> 00:03:56,100
Even when the character
is initiating the jump,

83
00:03:56,100 --> 00:03:58,210
we keep the same mechanism.

84
00:03:58,210 --> 00:03:59,620
If the body is going up,

85
00:03:59,620 --> 00:04:02,710
I will slightly lean
the character forward.

86
00:04:02,710 --> 00:04:06,140
But then when the character
is airborne and about

87
00:04:06,140 --> 00:04:08,890
to land just before throwing the kick,

88
00:04:08,890 --> 00:04:13,260
the character starts to use
his chest for the anticipation

89
00:04:13,260 --> 00:04:14,940
to load energy.

90
00:04:14,940 --> 00:04:18,910
So I will make sure that it
twists as far as possible,

91
00:04:18,910 --> 00:04:22,070
the opposite direction
than the kick release,

92
00:04:22,070 --> 00:04:25,670
as if the shoulder were going
to pull the hips forward.

93
00:04:25,670 --> 00:04:26,980
So from the camera view,

94
00:04:26,980 --> 00:04:29,740
I just make sure that I
push the line of faction

95
00:04:29,740 --> 00:04:31,330
as far as possible,

96
00:04:31,330 --> 00:04:33,310
tilting the chest to the right

97
00:04:33,310 --> 00:04:36,740
and bending the character
backward as far as possible.

98
00:04:36,740 --> 00:04:40,710
Then the whole chest will
be moving toward the kick

99
00:04:40,710 --> 00:04:44,380
as if the character was
trying to give a headbutt

100
00:04:44,380 --> 00:04:47,980
to another bag that is side
to side with the current bag.

101
00:04:47,980 --> 00:04:50,550
So in the end, if you
watch my current curve,

102
00:04:50,550 --> 00:04:51,600
it's pretty noisy.

103
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:53,570
There is a lot of ups and downs.

104
00:04:53,570 --> 00:04:56,820
And at the end of the polishing
stage of this very part,

105
00:04:56,820 --> 00:04:59,960
you will see that I have
a way smoother curve.

106
00:04:59,960 --> 00:05:03,560
And it does show in the arc
of the base of the neck,

107
00:05:03,560 --> 00:05:05,070
which is pretty nice.

108
00:05:05,070 --> 00:05:08,130
Then I will break a bit the smoothness

109
00:05:08,130 --> 00:05:11,470
of the X rotation curve around frame 82

110
00:05:11,470 --> 00:05:15,380
to create the recoil
effect after the kick.

111
00:05:15,380 --> 00:05:19,070
But while the character was
really leaning into the kick

112
00:05:19,070 --> 00:05:21,980
now that he has lost momentum,

113
00:05:21,980 --> 00:05:25,560
he needed to get
straighter to find balance.

114
00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:28,360
And once I've recovered this balance

115
00:05:28,360 --> 00:05:32,920
during these short transitions
between frame 82 and 85,

116
00:05:32,920 --> 00:05:36,500
it's just about making
the chest drag a bit

117
00:05:36,500 --> 00:05:40,940
while the character is
taking a few step backwards.

118
00:05:40,940 --> 00:05:43,370
Then to improve the animation,

119
00:05:43,370 --> 00:05:47,350
what I did is that I've modified
the location of the chest

120
00:05:47,350 --> 00:05:48,410
during the kick.

121
00:05:48,410 --> 00:05:51,420
The idea was to create some chest shake

122
00:05:51,420 --> 00:05:53,760
while the character was hitting the bag.

123
00:05:53,760 --> 00:05:56,660
So I will be pushing the chest forward

124
00:05:56,660 --> 00:06:00,150
just after the impact on frame 79

125
00:06:00,150 --> 00:06:02,390
and a couple of frame later,

126
00:06:02,390 --> 00:06:05,310
I will pull the chest backward

127
00:06:05,310 --> 00:06:09,750
until it recovers around frame 85.

128
00:06:09,750 --> 00:06:13,090
This will create a quick
back and forth motion

129
00:06:13,090 --> 00:06:14,840
as if the torso was shaking

130
00:06:14,840 --> 00:06:16,890
because of the impact of the kick.

131
00:06:16,890 --> 00:06:20,170
This is pretty similar to
what we did to the shoulders

132
00:06:20,170 --> 00:06:23,089
and the head of the character
during the hook motion.

133
00:06:23,089 --> 00:06:24,840
(swooshing)

134
00:06:24,840 --> 00:06:26,350
Once I'm done with the chest,

135
00:06:26,350 --> 00:06:28,870
I always go further in the chain.

136
00:06:28,870 --> 00:06:31,250
So I will be working on the neck

137
00:06:31,250 --> 00:06:33,980
as we did for the
previous animation chunk.

138
00:06:33,980 --> 00:06:37,470
As usual, I will be mostly
making the head drag.

139
00:06:37,470 --> 00:06:40,110
Since the neck is a tride of the chest,

140
00:06:40,110 --> 00:06:42,090
quaternion rotation behavior

141
00:06:42,090 --> 00:06:45,100
is pretty close to
euler rotation behavior.

142
00:06:45,100 --> 00:06:46,450
So from the side view,

143
00:06:46,450 --> 00:06:49,600
I will be working on
the X rotation channel.

144
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:51,590
I will make sure to track my axis

145
00:06:51,590 --> 00:06:53,960
using the base of the neck.

146
00:06:53,960 --> 00:06:56,320
And then when the character is going down,

147
00:06:56,320 --> 00:06:58,380
I will slightly raise the neck.

148
00:06:58,380 --> 00:07:00,730
And when the character is pushing up,

149
00:07:00,730 --> 00:07:03,360
I will make sure that
the neck is going down.

150
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:05,690
This is something we have already done

151
00:07:05,690 --> 00:07:06,910
during the blocking stage.

152
00:07:06,910 --> 00:07:10,270
So here I'm just revising
some of the poses

153
00:07:10,270 --> 00:07:11,900
that may not be clean.

154
00:07:11,900 --> 00:07:15,870
Like this little drop on the
y-axis that doesn't make sense

155
00:07:15,870 --> 00:07:20,040
since the character is moving
pretty linearly to the side.

156
00:07:20,040 --> 00:07:22,440
Polishing the neck is mostly about

157
00:07:22,440 --> 00:07:24,810
the X and Y rotation curve

158
00:07:24,810 --> 00:07:28,130
as they drive the tilting
and leaning of the head.

159
00:07:28,130 --> 00:07:31,690
While my wheel is to make the head drag,

160
00:07:31,690 --> 00:07:34,450
the polishing stage is
also the opportunity

161
00:07:34,450 --> 00:07:36,250
to fix some of the poses.

162
00:07:36,250 --> 00:07:39,120
And my go-to for this
is to watch my character

163
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:42,640
and make sure that the head
doesn't feel too uncomfortable.

164
00:07:42,640 --> 00:07:44,640
I'm just watching the relationship

165
00:07:44,640 --> 00:07:46,630
between the chest and the neck.

166
00:07:46,630 --> 00:07:51,527
And whenever the pose feels
uncomfortable, I fix it.

167
00:07:51,527 --> 00:07:52,730
(swooshing)

168
00:07:52,730 --> 00:07:53,920
Regarding the head,

169
00:07:53,920 --> 00:07:58,280
I haven't anything to add that
we haven't covered already.

170
00:07:58,280 --> 00:08:01,380
For all the transition
between the punches,

171
00:08:01,380 --> 00:08:04,900
the steps or any motion
that is not that fast,

172
00:08:04,900 --> 00:08:08,920
I will make the head slightly
dragging as we did before.

173
00:08:08,920 --> 00:08:12,240
I will jump directly
to the kicking moment.

174
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:14,670
And at this stage of the animation,

175
00:08:14,670 --> 00:08:17,430
my goal is not to make
the head drag that much

176
00:08:17,430 --> 00:08:20,360
because the character is
focusing on the target,

177
00:08:20,360 --> 00:08:22,570
and it might not be as relaxed

178
00:08:22,570 --> 00:08:25,230
as in between the different punches.

179
00:08:25,230 --> 00:08:28,420
Your goal here is to make
sure that the character

180
00:08:28,420 --> 00:08:31,310
is watching the target
from the camera angle,

181
00:08:31,310 --> 00:08:35,300
or at least that we feel like
he's watching the target.

182
00:08:35,300 --> 00:08:37,650
So, I'm orientating the head

183
00:08:37,650 --> 00:08:41,090
so that it's looking at the same point

184
00:08:41,090 --> 00:08:42,763
during the whole kick.

185
00:08:43,930 --> 00:08:45,870
Once I'm done with the rotation,

186
00:08:45,870 --> 00:08:48,430
I will play with the location of the head

187
00:08:48,430 --> 00:08:50,930
to improve the impact of the kick.

188
00:08:50,930 --> 00:08:54,360
First, I track the head
tweaker on the top of the head.

189
00:08:54,360 --> 00:08:58,240
And my goal is to clean the
arc from the camera view,

190
00:08:58,240 --> 00:09:00,570
for example, on frame 78,

191
00:09:00,570 --> 00:09:02,760
you can see that the
arc is going a bit down

192
00:09:02,760 --> 00:09:03,810
and then going up.

193
00:09:03,810 --> 00:09:07,070
So I will raise the head so
that I get a cleaner arc,

194
00:09:07,070 --> 00:09:10,780
and then after impact I
will push the head forward.

195
00:09:10,780 --> 00:09:13,440
And after I've pushed the head forward,

196
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:16,840
because of the momentum of
the kicks that just stop

197
00:09:16,840 --> 00:09:19,910
so the head is continuing
to travel forward.

198
00:09:19,910 --> 00:09:23,260
I will try to bunch a bit
the different keys here,

199
00:09:23,260 --> 00:09:25,800
this way just after the kick contact,

200
00:09:25,800 --> 00:09:29,280
the head will stabilize a
bit from the camera view

201
00:09:29,280 --> 00:09:31,690
and we will be able to see it clearly.

202
00:09:31,690 --> 00:09:35,970
And it will improve the
recoil feeling of the kick.

203
00:09:35,970 --> 00:09:39,190
Finally, I will add a bit
of stretching in the head

204
00:09:39,190 --> 00:09:41,460
when it's moving down super fast

205
00:09:41,460 --> 00:09:43,420
using the top head tweaker,

206
00:09:43,420 --> 00:09:47,730
only working on the Z location
axis of the head tweaker.

207
00:09:47,730 --> 00:09:49,320
And just after the stretch,

208
00:09:49,320 --> 00:09:51,810
I will squash it a little bit

209
00:09:51,810 --> 00:09:53,360
a couple of frames later

210
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:57,273
before it settles again two frames later.
