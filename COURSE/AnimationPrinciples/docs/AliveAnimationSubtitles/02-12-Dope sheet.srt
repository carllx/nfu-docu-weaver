00:00:00,130 --> 00:00:01,560
- [Instructor] Before we go further

2
00:00:01,560 --> 00:00:03,690
and talk about the dope sheet,

3
00:00:03,690 --> 00:00:06,990
we need to talk a bit
about Blender's data.

4
00:00:06,990 --> 00:00:08,840
If you're beginning with Blender,

5
00:00:08,840 --> 00:00:12,140
the most common data you are manipulating

6
00:00:12,140 --> 00:00:14,340
is the material of an object.

7
00:00:14,340 --> 00:00:16,270
You may have watched tutorial

8
00:00:16,270 --> 00:00:18,010
where you create a material

9
00:00:18,010 --> 00:00:20,620
and then you share it on multiple object.

10
00:00:20,620 --> 00:00:23,190
For example, we can see
this blue material applied

11
00:00:23,190 --> 00:00:24,210
to the Suzanne head.

12
00:00:24,210 --> 00:00:25,650
If I select the cube,

13
00:00:25,650 --> 00:00:27,550
I can go into the library

14
00:00:27,550 --> 00:00:30,420
and apply to it the blue material too.

15
00:00:30,420 --> 00:00:33,610
Both object are now
sharing the same material

16
00:00:33,610 --> 00:00:36,660
or sharing the same material data.

17
00:00:36,660 --> 00:00:38,010
With my cube selected,

18
00:00:38,010 --> 00:00:40,550
if I apply again the blue material,

19
00:00:40,550 --> 00:00:43,740
I will see the number two appearing next

20
00:00:43,740 --> 00:00:45,230
to the material name.

21
00:00:45,230 --> 00:00:47,830
This number indicate how many object

22
00:00:47,830 --> 00:00:51,970
or users are currently
using this blue material

23
00:00:51,970 --> 00:00:54,470
and it's current two, the monkey head

24
00:00:54,470 --> 00:00:55,350
and the cube.

25
00:00:55,350 --> 00:00:58,860
It means that if I change
the color of this material,

26
00:00:58,860 --> 00:01:01,320
it will be changing on both object

27
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:04,220
because it's the same data
that they are sharing.

28
00:01:04,220 --> 00:01:08,340
So as explained in the very
first video of this chapter,

29
00:01:08,340 --> 00:01:10,340
objects are just containers

30
00:01:10,340 --> 00:01:12,310
and if I go to the mesh data,

31
00:01:12,310 --> 00:01:15,300
I will also find a data library

32
00:01:15,300 --> 00:01:18,900
that will allow me to
source any other mesh data

33
00:01:18,900 --> 00:01:20,343
from any other object.

34
00:01:20,343 --> 00:01:22,170
With the cube selected,

35
00:01:22,170 --> 00:01:25,000
if I select the sphere mesh data,

36
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,870
my cube will be transformed into a sphere

37
00:01:27,870 --> 00:01:29,830
and Blender indicates us

38
00:01:29,830 --> 00:01:33,290
that there are two objects
using those mesh data.

39
00:01:33,290 --> 00:01:35,470
We have also seen that the object

40
00:01:35,470 --> 00:01:38,470
has changed color because the material

41
00:01:38,470 --> 00:01:40,780
is bound to the vertices.

42
00:01:40,780 --> 00:01:42,650
By loading new mesh data,

43
00:01:42,650 --> 00:01:46,220
we have also sourced the
material data linked to it.

44
00:01:46,220 --> 00:01:50,200
If we now go back to our
bouncing ball animation,

45
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:51,830
with the graph editor open,

46
00:01:51,830 --> 00:01:53,670
I can see that I'm working on the ball

47
00:01:53,670 --> 00:01:57,600
but just under, we have
the SphereAction.002

48
00:01:57,600 --> 00:01:59,470
that we haven't talked about.

49
00:01:59,470 --> 00:02:02,810
And when we look at at our
graph editor hierarchy,

50
00:02:02,810 --> 00:02:05,930
we can see our mesh object, the ball.

51
00:02:05,930 --> 00:02:09,950
The SphereAction.002 is bound to the ball

52
00:02:09,950 --> 00:02:13,160
and all the transformed channel keyframes

53
00:02:13,160 --> 00:02:15,790
are bound to this SphereAction.

54
00:02:15,790 --> 00:02:17,630
Instead of the graph editor,

55
00:02:17,630 --> 00:02:19,680
let's open the dope sheet.

56
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:22,840
Let's consider the dope sheet
as being like the timeline.

57
00:02:22,840 --> 00:02:25,693
All the shortcuts and
features we have seen

58
00:02:25,693 --> 00:02:29,090
with the timeline works
within the dope sheet.

59
00:02:29,090 --> 00:02:31,240
We can see our mesh object

60
00:02:31,240 --> 00:02:33,760
and the action in the hierarchy.

61
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:36,500
If I now enable the collection cone,

62
00:02:36,500 --> 00:02:38,940
and I start animating the location

63
00:02:38,940 --> 00:02:42,030
of the cone by inserting
a couple of keyframe,

64
00:02:42,030 --> 00:02:44,770
a new hierarchy appear in the dope sheet.

65
00:02:44,770 --> 00:02:46,880
We can find our cone object

66
00:02:46,880 --> 00:02:49,573
with a new action called coneAction.

67
00:02:50,789 --> 00:02:53,847
As soon as you insert
a keyframe on an object

68
00:02:53,847 --> 00:02:56,330
that hasn't been animated yet,

69
00:02:56,330 --> 00:02:59,500
it will automatically create a new action.

70
00:02:59,500 --> 00:03:03,100
This action are the name of the container

71
00:03:03,100 --> 00:03:05,330
that contain animation data

72
00:03:06,170 --> 00:03:07,670
and the dope sheet is an overview

73
00:03:07,670 --> 00:03:09,910
of all the animation data

74
00:03:09,910 --> 00:03:12,043
that are being used in our scene.

75
00:03:12,043 --> 00:03:13,870
Here we can see which container

76
00:03:13,870 --> 00:03:16,340
is using the animation data

77
00:03:16,340 --> 00:03:18,100
and what action is being used

78
00:03:18,100 --> 00:03:22,210
but now what if I want to
edit those animation data?

79
00:03:22,210 --> 00:03:25,430
We can access them
through the action editor.

80
00:03:25,430 --> 00:03:27,020
With the action editor,

81
00:03:27,020 --> 00:03:31,110
we will be able to work on
a specific action at a time.

82
00:03:31,110 --> 00:03:33,280
With the cone selected, I can see

83
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:35,570
that I'm working on the cone action

84
00:03:35,570 --> 00:03:38,230
and as for any other kind of data,

85
00:03:38,230 --> 00:03:40,700
if I click the action icon,

86
00:03:40,700 --> 00:03:43,580
I will access our action library.

87
00:03:43,580 --> 00:03:45,210
So it means that as for material

88
00:03:45,210 --> 00:03:47,460
or any kind of data,

89
00:03:47,460 --> 00:03:51,120
I can share this animation
to any other object.

90
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:53,570
So I will select my SphereAction.002,

91
00:03:53,570 --> 00:03:55,450
rename it bouncing ball

92
00:03:55,450 --> 00:03:57,980
and when I play the animation,

93
00:03:57,980 --> 00:04:01,300
I can see that now my cone is moving

94
00:04:01,300 --> 00:04:03,030
as our bouncing ball.

95
00:04:03,030 --> 00:04:04,630
And near the action name,

96
00:04:04,630 --> 00:04:07,210
I can see that I have two users

97
00:04:07,210 --> 00:04:09,070
of the bouncing ball animation.

98
00:04:09,070 --> 00:04:13,460
So I can share this animation
on as many object as I want.

99
00:04:13,460 --> 00:04:15,680
I can give it to Suzanne here

100
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:17,880
and now we can see that
we have three users

101
00:04:17,880 --> 00:04:19,830
and when I play the animation,

102
00:04:19,830 --> 00:04:22,450
our Suzanne monkey head will move

103
00:04:22,450 --> 00:04:24,100
as the bouncing ball too.

104
00:04:24,100 --> 00:04:26,160
Since I've given the
bouncing ball animation

105
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:27,450
to all my object,

106
00:04:27,450 --> 00:04:28,991
the point action, for example,

107
00:04:28,991 --> 00:04:30,950
has no more users.

108
00:04:30,950 --> 00:04:33,330
And if I brought my action library,

109
00:04:33,330 --> 00:04:37,020
I will see this little zero
in front of the coneAction

110
00:04:37,020 --> 00:04:39,400
and you have to be very careful with that

111
00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:41,800
because whenever you have any kind of data

112
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:44,860
that has a zero in front of its name,

113
00:04:44,860 --> 00:04:46,850
then they will get rid of this data

114
00:04:46,850 --> 00:04:48,700
as soon as you close the software.

115
00:04:48,700 --> 00:04:52,530
So if I revert my scene,
now reopen it if you will,

116
00:04:52,530 --> 00:04:56,790
the coneAction marked with
a zero has disappeared

117
00:04:56,790 --> 00:04:58,940
and I've lost this animation.

118
00:04:58,940 --> 00:05:00,940
To avoid losing an animation,

119
00:05:00,940 --> 00:05:03,340
you can click the little shield icon

120
00:05:03,340 --> 00:05:05,910
that will create a new fake user.

121
00:05:05,910 --> 00:05:08,080
Whether the data is used or not,

122
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:11,495
then I won't flush it on restart.

123
00:05:11,495 --> 00:05:14,260
As we have seen before with the materials,

124
00:05:14,260 --> 00:05:18,170
as soon as a data or an action is shared,

125
00:05:18,170 --> 00:05:20,870
editing it on one of the object

126
00:05:20,870 --> 00:05:23,720
will affect any other container

127
00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:25,740
that is using the same action.

128
00:05:25,740 --> 00:05:28,460
If you want to duplicate
the current action,

129
00:05:28,460 --> 00:05:31,320
you can click the number
next to it's name.

130
00:05:31,320 --> 00:05:33,270
This become a new action

131
00:05:33,270 --> 00:05:36,270
or a new data that you can edit freely

132
00:05:36,270 --> 00:05:39,650
and you can see that there
is not more multiple users

133
00:05:39,650 --> 00:05:40,483
on this one.

134
00:05:40,483 --> 00:05:42,640
And this new duplicated action

135
00:05:42,640 --> 00:05:45,660
has been added to the action library.

136
00:05:45,660 --> 00:05:48,410
To definitely get rid of an action,

137
00:05:48,410 --> 00:05:51,090
Shift + click the cross icon.

138
00:05:51,090 --> 00:05:54,200
When reverting the file
or reloading Blender,

139
00:05:54,200 --> 00:05:57,890
the animation data or the
action will be removed.

140
00:05:57,890 --> 00:05:58,900
If you're starting fresh

141
00:05:58,900 --> 00:06:01,000
and your object is not animating,

142
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:04,440
you can press the New button
to create a new action.

143
00:06:04,440 --> 00:06:06,790
I will insert a couple of keyframe

144
00:06:06,790 --> 00:06:08,360
to illustrate one thing.

145
00:06:08,360 --> 00:06:11,240
When you get this orange continuous line

146
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:13,020
between two frames,

147
00:06:13,020 --> 00:06:16,160
it means that the value is not changing.

148
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:20,210
As soon as I enter a value on
one of the transform channel,

149
00:06:20,210 --> 00:06:23,610
we can see that now there
is no more this orange line

150
00:06:23,610 --> 00:06:25,340
on the z location channel.

151
00:06:25,340 --> 00:06:28,810
Switching to constant
or linear interpolation

152
00:06:28,810 --> 00:06:32,940
will create a green line
between the different keyframes.

153
00:06:32,940 --> 00:06:34,480
So it basically tells you

154
00:06:34,480 --> 00:06:37,730
that you are not choosing
Bezier interpolation.

155
00:06:37,730 --> 00:06:40,820
Changing the handle type of your keyframe

156
00:06:40,820 --> 00:06:44,380
will be also displayed
in the action editor.

157
00:06:44,380 --> 00:06:47,980
You will see the shape of
the key currently changing.

158
00:06:47,980 --> 00:06:51,340
The action editor will
become our main editor

159
00:06:51,340 --> 00:06:53,510
when it comes to animation

160
00:06:53,510 --> 00:06:56,120
before we jump into the graph editor.

161
00:06:56,120 --> 00:06:59,570
To summarize, we have see
that the dope sheet shows us

162
00:06:59,570 --> 00:07:02,070
all the current actions
that are being used

163
00:07:02,070 --> 00:07:04,090
in our Blender scene,

164
00:07:04,090 --> 00:07:06,510
while the action editor allow us

165
00:07:06,510 --> 00:07:08,620
