00:00:00,081 --> 00:00:01,400
- [Narrator] The tail motion is

2
00:00:01,400 --> 00:00:03,576
almost exclusively follow through.

3
00:00:03,576 --> 00:00:06,470
It is supporting the ax made by the body

4
00:00:06,470 --> 00:00:09,950
of the character when it's
jumping and moving forward.

5
00:00:09,950 --> 00:00:12,480
On such a character, the tail is used

6
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:14,356
to balance the motion.

7
00:00:14,356 --> 00:00:16,083
As explained in the previous video,

8
00:00:16,083 --> 00:00:20,830
if I want to show that my
character is balanced and agile,

9
00:00:20,830 --> 00:00:23,800
I won't make the tail wobbling around.

10
00:00:23,800 --> 00:00:28,220
But I'd rather try to make
it having a smooth movement.

11
00:00:28,220 --> 00:00:31,540
So as usual, I'm starting
with the X rotation

12
00:00:31,540 --> 00:00:35,060
because it's the most
influential transform channel

13
00:00:35,060 --> 00:00:36,810
on the motion of the tail.

14
00:00:36,810 --> 00:00:40,091
As the tail is using
forward kinematic mechanism,

15
00:00:40,091 --> 00:00:43,300
it's better to start polishing the base

16
00:00:43,300 --> 00:00:45,400
of the tail or the root of the tail,

17
00:00:45,400 --> 00:00:48,790
and then go along until
the tip of the tail.

18
00:00:48,790 --> 00:00:52,261
So I've been mainly
smoothing the rotation curve,

19
00:00:52,261 --> 00:00:56,300
and we have a bigger gap
whenever our character

20
00:00:56,300 --> 00:00:57,747
is hitting the ground.

21
00:00:57,747 --> 00:01:00,380
Protect pose occur on frame 11,

22
00:01:00,380 --> 00:01:04,040
and the rotation of the tail
is offset by one or two frames.

23
00:01:04,040 --> 00:01:05,130
During the blocking,

24
00:01:05,130 --> 00:01:08,730
I've also input a slight location change

25
00:01:08,730 --> 00:01:11,690
in the tail to support the
shape and the silhouette

26
00:01:11,690 --> 00:01:12,970
of the character.

27
00:01:12,970 --> 00:01:15,110
I'm just editing a bit the curve so

28
00:01:15,110 --> 00:01:18,690
that it transitions mostly
from one key to the other.

29
00:01:18,690 --> 00:01:21,340
So I'm mostly doing this
to avoid any glitches

30
00:01:21,340 --> 00:01:22,330
in the animation.

31
00:01:22,330 --> 00:01:24,540
The Z rotation curve allow us

32
00:01:24,540 --> 00:01:26,894
to swing the tail from left to right.

33
00:01:26,894 --> 00:01:29,850
And this is typically the kind of motion

34
00:01:29,850 --> 00:01:33,920
that will translate the lack
of balance from your character.

35
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:36,340
If you're walking on a thin line

36
00:01:36,340 --> 00:01:38,118
and you try to keep your balance,

37
00:01:38,118 --> 00:01:41,236
you will spread your arms on each side.

38
00:01:41,236 --> 00:01:44,860
So that you could use
them as a counter weight.

39
00:01:44,860 --> 00:01:47,730
And the more your body
will move left to right

40
00:01:47,730 --> 00:01:49,008
when you are moving forward,

41
00:01:49,008 --> 00:01:52,950
the more you will translate
this lack of balance.

42
00:01:52,950 --> 00:01:55,867
When put a very subtle
left to right motion just

43
00:01:55,867 --> 00:01:58,880
to support the line of the body.

44
00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:01,352
This will support the line of action,

45
00:02:01,352 --> 00:02:04,310
and the realism of our character.

46
00:02:04,310 --> 00:02:06,630
We will have a more in depth discussion

47
00:02:06,630 --> 00:02:09,561
about the line of action
later on in this course.

48
00:02:09,561 --> 00:02:11,280
But you should understand

49
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:16,280
that this slight tilt brings
some kind of randomness

50
00:02:16,340 --> 00:02:19,698
or make the character a little more uneven

51
00:02:19,698 --> 00:02:22,810
and make it this way more realistic.

52
00:02:22,810 --> 00:02:25,860
Don't forget on your cycle
to make sure that the first

53
00:02:25,860 --> 00:02:27,780
and last key frame are the same

54
00:02:27,780 --> 00:02:30,730
and that their vector are
aligned with the curve

55
00:02:30,730 --> 00:02:32,640
to get a smooth transition.

56
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:35,131
Now we can jump onto
the second controller.

57
00:02:35,131 --> 00:02:40,130
And what I will do is that I
will re input the root motion

58
00:02:40,130 --> 00:02:41,061
to my character

59
00:02:41,061 --> 00:02:44,910
and calculate the motion
pass to see how it goes.

60
00:02:44,910 --> 00:02:47,670
I don't want to repeat
the mistakes I've made

61
00:02:47,670 --> 00:02:51,240
in the previous video where
I've checked the motion

62
00:02:51,240 --> 00:02:55,140
of my character with the root
motion on a bit too late,

63
00:02:55,140 --> 00:02:57,330
and I had to fix a lot of things.

64
00:02:57,330 --> 00:03:00,800
As for the root of the tail
around the impact frame,

65
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:04,480
we will have some kind of
big change in the curve.

66
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:08,630
And then it will be mostly
smoothing out the shape

67
00:03:08,630 --> 00:03:12,660
of the tail so that it
follow the flow of the body

68
00:03:12,660 --> 00:03:15,180
or the motion of the body in space.

69
00:03:15,180 --> 00:03:18,400
Think of it as a train or as a ribbon.

70
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:22,320
As the root of the ribbon is
throwing shape in the air,

71
00:03:22,320 --> 00:03:26,090
the rest of it is following
in the same motion.

72
00:03:26,090 --> 00:03:26,923
The same flow,

73
00:03:26,923 --> 00:03:28,060
the same arc,

74
00:03:28,060 --> 00:03:29,300
the same path.

75
00:03:29,300 --> 00:03:31,930
This way you are really
supporting the motion

76
00:03:31,930 --> 00:03:33,730
of your character in space.

77
00:03:33,730 --> 00:03:37,400
And it give more freedity, more smoothness

78
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:39,040
to the jumping motion.

79
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:41,900
This kind of fall through
animation is pretty easy

80
00:03:41,900 --> 00:03:45,860
to set up on such a cycle animation,

81
00:03:45,860 --> 00:03:48,330
and on such a smooth animation.

82
00:03:48,330 --> 00:03:50,550
But it's kind of more complicated

83
00:03:50,550 --> 00:03:53,530
as soon as you get a more snappy animation

84
00:03:53,530 --> 00:03:56,980
or a lot of big variation into the motion.

85
00:03:56,980 --> 00:03:58,700
On same note with this joint,

86
00:03:58,700 --> 00:04:00,470
I will jump on the last one.

87
00:04:00,470 --> 00:04:02,910
So this is all I have for this video,

88
00:04:02,910 --> 00:04:05,055
and I will see you in the next one.

89
00:04:05,055 --> 00:04:07,472
(soft music)
