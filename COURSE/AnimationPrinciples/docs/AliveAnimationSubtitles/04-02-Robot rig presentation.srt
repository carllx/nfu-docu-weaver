1
00:00:00,720 --> 00:00:02,070
- [Instructor] Before we get started,

2
00:00:02,070 --> 00:00:04,140
let's have a look to the rig.

3
00:00:04,140 --> 00:00:07,898
By default, the character
is presented with a MatCap

4
00:00:07,898 --> 00:00:10,380
and the preview of the texture.

5
00:00:10,380 --> 00:00:13,130
You can enter material preview mode

6
00:00:13,130 --> 00:00:15,850
to see the robot at its best

7
00:00:15,850 --> 00:00:17,830
but you should stay in showing mode

8
00:00:17,830 --> 00:00:19,321
for animation performances.

9
00:00:19,321 --> 00:00:20,160
(whoosh)

10
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:22,310
By default, you should have access

11
00:00:22,310 --> 00:00:24,390
to the different rig layers.

12
00:00:24,390 --> 00:00:27,670
If it's not the case,
open the text editor.

13
00:00:27,670 --> 00:00:29,590
You should have the script open,

14
00:00:29,590 --> 00:00:32,340
if it's not the case,
select it in the list

15
00:00:32,340 --> 00:00:34,150
and press the play button.

16
00:00:34,150 --> 00:00:35,910
Then select the rig

17
00:00:35,910 --> 00:00:38,180
and go into pose mode.

18
00:00:38,180 --> 00:00:41,630
The first thing to check is this eye icon.

19
00:00:41,630 --> 00:00:45,280
It's a bone that holds
some custom properties.

20
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:48,480
The Bevel option allows us to re-enable

21
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:51,470
the Bevel modifier that is on the robot.

22
00:00:51,470 --> 00:00:53,750
It will make it look a little better

23
00:00:53,750 --> 00:00:57,340
but it will also increase
the number of polygon,

24
00:00:57,340 --> 00:00:59,750
hence reducing the performances.

25
00:00:59,750 --> 00:01:01,850
Activating the Bevel modifier

26
00:01:01,850 --> 00:01:04,880
tend to triple the number of polygons.

27
00:01:04,880 --> 00:01:07,170
Enabling the subdiv option,

28
00:01:07,170 --> 00:01:10,598
will enabled the subdivision
modifier on the robot,

29
00:01:10,598 --> 00:01:15,010
increasing the number of
faces to almost a million.

30
00:01:15,010 --> 00:01:19,200
So it will largely slow down
your computer performances.

31
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:23,180
If I press the space bar and
try to play the animation,

32
00:01:23,180 --> 00:01:26,130
even if our robot is not animated,

33
00:01:26,130 --> 00:01:29,360
you can see the number of
frame per second dropping.

34
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:32,529
Note that those option only
effect the viewport display.

35
00:01:32,529 --> 00:01:35,160
You don't need to re-enable them

36
00:01:35,160 --> 00:01:37,750
if you want to render your animation.

37
00:01:37,750 --> 00:01:40,620
Getting back onto this view property bone,

38
00:01:40,620 --> 00:01:43,110
you can see that there are options to

39
00:01:43,110 --> 00:01:46,490
mask the artillery piece, the legs,

40
00:01:46,490 --> 00:01:49,180
and both the mini gun,
and the rocket launcher.

41
00:01:49,180 --> 00:01:53,780
Just, as we add on the squirrel
character allows us to focus

42
00:01:53,780 --> 00:01:56,070
on specific parts of the character.

43
00:01:56,070 --> 00:01:57,450
Next to these bones,

44
00:01:57,450 --> 00:02:00,910
we have another one that
is our properties bone.

45
00:02:00,910 --> 00:02:03,280
It includes a lot of different properties

46
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:05,930
but they almost all do the same thing.

47
00:02:05,930 --> 00:02:08,360
The first ones allow us to switch

48
00:02:08,360 --> 00:02:11,940
between the forward kinematic
and inverse kinematics

49
00:02:11,940 --> 00:02:14,360
for the right leg or the left leg.

50
00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:18,110
By default, they are set
to inverse kinematics.

51
00:02:18,110 --> 00:02:20,590
Moving the inverse kinematic controller

52
00:02:20,590 --> 00:02:23,260
would allow us to animate the whole leg

53
00:02:23,260 --> 00:02:26,019
exactly as we did with
our squirrel characters.

54
00:02:26,019 --> 00:02:29,020
If we change the value to zero,

55
00:02:29,020 --> 00:02:32,470
now the leg is moving in another position.

56
00:02:32,470 --> 00:02:36,300
It will now follow the
forward kinematic controllers

57
00:02:36,300 --> 00:02:37,560
that we can access

58
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:41,320
by activating the forward kinematic layer.

59
00:02:41,320 --> 00:02:44,537
Now the leg is moving
using forward kinematic

60
00:02:44,537 --> 00:02:48,290
and we can control each
segment separately.

61
00:02:48,290 --> 00:02:51,854
We will be mostly animating
using inverse kinematic

62
00:02:51,854 --> 00:02:53,990
so you can switch it back.

63
00:02:53,990 --> 00:02:58,460
The next properties allows
up to enable or disable

64
00:02:58,460 --> 00:03:03,120
the rotation follow of the
different parts of the robot.

65
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:04,100
By default,

66
00:03:04,100 --> 00:03:07,510
the arms are following the
orientation of the body.

67
00:03:07,510 --> 00:03:10,780
But if I disable this flow rotation,

68
00:03:10,780 --> 00:03:13,010
you can see that now they stay

69
00:03:13,010 --> 00:03:14,310
or (indistinct).

70
00:03:14,310 --> 00:03:16,310
They don't follow the rotation

71
00:03:16,310 --> 00:03:17,840
of the body anymore.

72
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:20,310
You will find the same option

73
00:03:20,310 --> 00:03:23,970
for the artillery piece
and the head of the robot.

74
00:03:23,970 --> 00:03:27,860
By default, the follow
rotation is disabled

75
00:03:27,860 --> 00:03:31,500
but if I re-enable the
follow head rotation,

76
00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:34,860
you can see that now the
head is leaning forward

77
00:03:34,860 --> 00:03:37,027
and is aligned with the body.

78
00:03:37,027 --> 00:03:42,027
The follow leg rotation will
only affect the leg behavior

79
00:03:42,100 --> 00:03:45,770
whenever you are using forward kinematic.

80
00:03:45,770 --> 00:03:48,790
This is pretty common when
using forward kinematic

81
00:03:48,790 --> 00:03:52,846
for the arms or the leg
to isolate their rotation

82
00:03:52,846 --> 00:03:57,070
from the hips rotation,
or the shoulder rotation.

83
00:03:57,070 --> 00:03:59,730
The next option, mini gun speed,

84
00:03:59,730 --> 00:04:01,710
will allow us to set

85
00:04:01,710 --> 00:04:05,570
the speed of rotation of
the mini gun cannon so that

86
00:04:05,570 --> 00:04:09,510
we don't need to animate
the rotation of the barrels.

87
00:04:09,510 --> 00:04:12,520
The mini gun follow and the sensor follow,

88
00:04:12,520 --> 00:04:15,286
allow us to isolate the targets

89
00:04:15,286 --> 00:04:18,000
from both those items.

90
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:22,970
The mini gun and the sensor
will follow their own target.

91
00:04:22,970 --> 00:04:26,010
And by default, those targets are parented

92
00:04:26,010 --> 00:04:28,090
to the body of the robot.

93
00:04:28,090 --> 00:04:30,640
If we disable or set to zero

94
00:04:30,640 --> 00:04:33,630
the value of the follow option,

95
00:04:33,630 --> 00:04:37,490
the target are no longer
following the motion of the body.

96
00:04:37,490 --> 00:04:42,060
And so you can see the mini
gun adjusting its orientation

97
00:04:42,060 --> 00:04:44,078
toward the aiming point.

98
00:04:44,078 --> 00:04:46,303
And so does the sensor
on top of the robot.

99
00:04:46,303 --> 00:04:47,343
(whoosh)

100
00:04:47,343 --> 00:04:51,430
The controllers of the robot
are pretty straightforward.

101
00:04:51,430 --> 00:04:55,000
The root bone allows us
to move the whole robot

102
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:59,730
the torso root allows us
to move the whole body.

103
00:04:59,730 --> 00:05:02,958
Then you will find controllers
for the different parts.

104
00:05:02,958 --> 00:05:04,984
All targets for the legs,

105
00:05:04,984 --> 00:05:06,870
IK controllers,

106
00:05:06,870 --> 00:05:09,780
allowing to move and rotate the feet.

107
00:05:09,780 --> 00:05:11,650
On the back of the foot, you will find

108
00:05:11,650 --> 00:05:16,650
a very useful controller that
allow us to perform steps

109
00:05:16,820 --> 00:05:21,540
or rotation around the ball
and the heel of the foot.

110
00:05:21,540 --> 00:05:26,100
When you rotate it from the
front view or on its Z axis,

111
00:05:26,100 --> 00:05:30,160
you will get a nice contacting
left to right motion.

112
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:32,140
Both arms of controller,

113
00:05:32,140 --> 00:05:36,110
the rocket launcher as a
door opening controller,

114
00:05:36,110 --> 00:05:39,299
each body part as a separate controller as

115
00:05:39,299 --> 00:05:41,893
on the body of this squirrel character.

116
00:05:42,810 --> 00:05:45,590
Each rocket as its own controller

117
00:05:45,590 --> 00:05:48,973
that allows us to move
them in space at will.

118
00:05:49,935 --> 00:05:53,640
And they also have a secondary
controller that alow us

119
00:05:53,640 --> 00:05:58,228
by a simple one axis
rotation to deploy the wings

120
00:05:58,228 --> 00:06:00,400
of those rockets.

121
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:04,826
The antennas have a simple
one axis rotation control.

122
00:06:04,826 --> 00:06:07,750
The artillery as a first controller

123
00:06:07,750 --> 00:06:11,760
that allows us to create
the recoil motion.

124
00:06:11,760 --> 00:06:16,000
And we also have a nigary
controller that allow us

125
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,967
a bit of up and down motion

126
00:06:18,967 --> 00:06:23,510
and also to slightly rotate
the artillery back and forth.

127
00:06:23,510 --> 00:06:26,740
So it's a pretty simple yet versatile rig.

128
00:06:26,740 --> 00:06:28,763
Let's animate this beast.
