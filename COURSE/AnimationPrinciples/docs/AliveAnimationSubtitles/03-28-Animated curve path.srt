00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:01,333
- [Instructor] In this video,

2
00:00:01,333 --> 00:00:04,170
we will see how to use a curve as a path

3
00:00:04,170 --> 00:00:06,950
as in the tree climbing sequence.

4
00:00:06,950 --> 00:00:08,500
In the corresponding file,

5
00:00:08,500 --> 00:00:11,587
I have two collections, one
including a simple arrow

6
00:00:11,587 --> 00:00:15,230
and the other one including
our squirrel character

7
00:00:15,230 --> 00:00:16,140
and the tree.

8
00:00:16,140 --> 00:00:18,270
Getting back to the arrow collection,

9
00:00:18,270 --> 00:00:19,780
I will press Shift + A

10
00:00:19,780 --> 00:00:22,260
to add a curve, Bezier curve.

11
00:00:22,260 --> 00:00:24,520
As any other object added to your scene,

12
00:00:24,520 --> 00:00:26,940
it is spawned onto the 3D cursor.

13
00:00:26,940 --> 00:00:28,390
It has an origin point

14
00:00:28,390 --> 00:00:31,070
and if I press Tab to enter edit mode,

15
00:00:31,070 --> 00:00:33,830
I can access the handles of the curve.

16
00:00:33,830 --> 00:00:36,650
It's pretty close to the handles we have

17
00:00:36,650 --> 00:00:38,000
in the graph editor.

18
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:39,740
Curves have an orientation,

19
00:00:39,740 --> 00:00:42,000
meaning that they have a starting point

20
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:43,800
and an ending point.

21
00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:46,620
To see it, we can go into the overlay

22
00:00:46,620 --> 00:00:49,480
and display the normals of the curve.

23
00:00:49,480 --> 00:00:51,670
Arrows will be displayed along the curve,

24
00:00:51,670 --> 00:00:54,040
showing you the orientation of flow

25
00:00:54,040 --> 00:00:57,540
of the curve, also called
normals of the curve.

26
00:00:57,540 --> 00:01:00,140
In edit mode, you can
manipulate the handles,

27
00:01:00,140 --> 00:01:01,210
as I explained before,

28
00:01:01,210 --> 00:01:03,930
using G, R and S.

29
00:01:03,930 --> 00:01:05,800
You can change the handle type

30
00:01:05,800 --> 00:01:07,970
as you will do in the graph editor,

31
00:01:07,970 --> 00:01:09,710
pressing the V key.

32
00:01:09,710 --> 00:01:11,640
Then you will get the same behavior

33
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:13,750
as the one we have in the graph editor

34
00:01:13,750 --> 00:01:16,100
but this time for a 3D object.

35
00:01:16,100 --> 00:01:18,560
And with any curve point selected,

36
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:21,980
you can press E to extrude a new point.

37
00:01:21,980 --> 00:01:24,750
As any object, we can access the curve

38
00:01:24,750 --> 00:01:27,390
that are in the properties panel.

39
00:01:27,390 --> 00:01:29,130
You can give a bit of thickness

40
00:01:29,130 --> 00:01:33,250
or geometry to your curve
going into the geometry panel.

41
00:01:33,250 --> 00:01:37,100
The simple extrude will
generate a rebound-like shape,

42
00:01:37,100 --> 00:01:39,220
while the bevel will allow you

43
00:01:39,220 --> 00:01:42,020
to create some kind of pipe.

44
00:01:42,020 --> 00:01:44,513
While we don't need
geometry for animation,

45
00:01:45,440 --> 00:01:49,000
it makes the curve more
readable in the 3D space.

46
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,670
In object mode, I can
select my arrow object,

47
00:01:51,670 --> 00:01:53,970
then select the curve to make it active.

48
00:01:53,970 --> 00:01:57,130
Press Control + P and choose Follow Path.

49
00:01:57,130 --> 00:01:59,530
Now if I scrub into the timeline,

50
00:01:59,530 --> 00:02:02,610
I can see the arrow following the curve.

51
00:02:02,610 --> 00:02:05,710
In the path animation option of the curve,

52
00:02:05,710 --> 00:02:08,170
we can see the value frames.

53
00:02:08,170 --> 00:02:11,520
And it is set to 100 frames.

54
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:13,930
It means that the object

55
00:02:13,930 --> 00:02:16,030
that is parented to the curve

56
00:02:16,030 --> 00:02:18,370
with the follow path option

57
00:02:18,370 --> 00:02:20,550
will take 100 frames to get

58
00:02:20,550 --> 00:02:24,030
from the beginning of the curve
'til the end of the curve.

59
00:02:24,030 --> 00:02:26,570
Switching to 50 frame value,

60
00:02:26,570 --> 00:02:29,820
you can see that now
my arrow get to the end

61
00:02:29,820 --> 00:02:32,410
of the curve on frame 50.

62
00:02:32,410 --> 00:02:35,540
As our arrow object is currently a child

63
00:02:35,540 --> 00:02:37,800
of the curve, we can move it at will.

64
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:40,260
It will still follow the path.

65
00:02:40,260 --> 00:02:42,380
And we can see that by default,

66
00:02:42,380 --> 00:02:45,250
our arrow object will rotate

67
00:02:45,250 --> 00:02:48,000
to follow the curvature of the path.

68
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,090
If I go into the option of the curve

69
00:02:50,090 --> 00:02:53,480
to the path animation and uncheck Follow,

70
00:02:53,480 --> 00:02:56,870
the object is no longer rotating

71
00:02:56,870 --> 00:02:59,220
to follow the orientation of the curve.

72
00:02:59,220 --> 00:03:03,523
The curve path only affect
the location of the object.

73
00:03:03,523 --> 00:03:05,430
Let's restart from scratch.

74
00:03:05,430 --> 00:03:07,860
I have removed any
influence from the curve.

75
00:03:07,860 --> 00:03:09,630
I will reselect the arrow,

76
00:03:09,630 --> 00:03:11,900
then the curve, press Control + P

77
00:03:11,900 --> 00:03:15,290
and this time, choose Path Constraint.

78
00:03:15,290 --> 00:03:17,750
This will add a path
constraint to the arrow

79
00:03:17,750 --> 00:03:20,320
that we can see in the Constraint tab

80
00:03:20,320 --> 00:03:22,230
of the properties editor.

81
00:03:22,230 --> 00:03:26,330
From there, if I scrub into
the timeline, nothing happened.

82
00:03:26,330 --> 00:03:29,470
Our object gets stuck on the initial point

83
00:03:29,470 --> 00:03:30,510
of the curve.

84
00:03:30,510 --> 00:03:33,350
If I click the Animate Path button,

85
00:03:33,350 --> 00:03:36,810
now our object is
traveling along the curve

86
00:03:36,810 --> 00:03:40,560
and you can see that
it takes it 100 frames

87
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:43,300
to follow the curve, as before.

88
00:03:43,300 --> 00:03:45,860
It still use the frame's value

89
00:03:45,860 --> 00:03:47,770
from the curve properties.

90
00:03:47,770 --> 00:03:50,020
Let's go back onto our arrow object

91
00:03:50,020 --> 00:03:52,170
and check out the constraint.

92
00:03:52,170 --> 00:03:55,740
We can see the forward
axis and up axis option.

93
00:03:55,740 --> 00:03:57,260
To better understand it,

94
00:03:57,260 --> 00:04:00,100
I will display the axis on my object.

95
00:04:00,100 --> 00:04:02,150
So we can see that our arrow

96
00:04:02,150 --> 00:04:04,690
is pointing in its y direction

97
00:04:04,690 --> 00:04:07,490
and the up axis is the z-axis,

98
00:04:07,490 --> 00:04:10,430
exactly as set into the constraint.

99
00:04:10,430 --> 00:04:13,860
So if I now click the Follow Curve option,

100
00:04:13,860 --> 00:04:17,130
the orientation of the arrow will change.

101
00:04:17,130 --> 00:04:18,900
It will follow the curve.

102
00:04:18,900 --> 00:04:23,060
Its y-axis will be aligned
with the curve path

103
00:04:23,060 --> 00:04:25,980
and the z-axis will still be pointing up

104
00:04:25,980 --> 00:04:28,130
as set in the constraint.

105
00:04:28,130 --> 00:04:31,090
If I switch the orientation to -y,

106
00:04:31,090 --> 00:04:35,150
it will flip the arrow but it
will still follow the curve

107
00:04:35,150 --> 00:04:38,980
and so if I choose the
x-axis, for example,

108
00:04:38,980 --> 00:04:41,540
logically you can't use the same channel

109
00:04:41,540 --> 00:04:44,100
as a forward and up axis.

110
00:04:44,100 --> 00:04:46,040
It will deactivate the constraint

111
00:04:46,040 --> 00:04:48,365
and it will no longer work.

112
00:04:48,365 --> 00:04:51,970
The offset value have
two different behavior.

113
00:04:51,970 --> 00:04:53,710
Let's move to frame 20

114
00:04:53,710 --> 00:04:57,270
and in the offset value,
set the value to 10.

115
00:04:57,270 --> 00:05:00,520
Our arrow is moved back on the curve.

116
00:05:00,520 --> 00:05:05,297
Its current position is
frame 20, -10 frames.

117
00:05:06,220 --> 00:05:10,270
The offset value is how
we delay the position

118
00:05:10,270 --> 00:05:12,450
of the arrow in time.

119
00:05:12,450 --> 00:05:15,880
Basically, we are
subtracting the offset value

120
00:05:15,880 --> 00:05:18,580
to the frame's value of the curve.

121
00:05:18,580 --> 00:05:20,750
So if I set it to -10,

122
00:05:20,750 --> 00:05:23,640
it will currently move the arrow forward,

123
00:05:23,640 --> 00:05:26,530
10 frame earlier in time.

124
00:05:26,530 --> 00:05:31,530
Exactly as if I was on
frame 30 without any offset.

125
00:05:31,816 --> 00:05:34,120
If I now enable the fixed position,

126
00:05:34,120 --> 00:05:36,180
our arrow object will be stuck

127
00:05:36,180 --> 00:05:37,760
to the beginning of the curve.

128
00:05:37,760 --> 00:05:40,850
Now the offset value is
no longer a value in frame

129
00:05:40,850 --> 00:05:43,260
but a value that goes from zero to one

130
00:05:43,260 --> 00:05:45,360
and indicate the position

131
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:48,510
between the beginning
and the end of the curve.

132
00:05:48,510 --> 00:05:52,220
Finally, if I enable
the curve radius option,

133
00:05:52,220 --> 00:05:54,620
our constraint object scale

134
00:05:54,620 --> 00:05:57,620
will depend on the curve radius.

135
00:05:57,620 --> 00:05:59,700
So if I now go into edit mode

136
00:05:59,700 --> 00:06:02,670
onto the curve and press Alt + S

137
00:06:02,670 --> 00:06:05,550
with one of the control points selected,

138
00:06:05,550 --> 00:06:09,440
I will be able to change
the radius of the curve

139
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:11,570
and this will influence the scale

140
00:06:11,570 --> 00:06:13,380
of our arrow objects.

141
00:06:13,380 --> 00:06:14,980
Finally, in edit mode,

142
00:06:14,980 --> 00:06:16,860
when working on the curve,

143
00:06:16,860 --> 00:06:19,030
with a control point selected,

144
00:06:19,030 --> 00:06:21,460
I can change the tilt value

145
00:06:21,460 --> 00:06:26,050
and I will see my curve
twisting or tilting.

146
00:06:26,050 --> 00:06:28,080
And so will the object

147
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:30,000
that is constrained by the curve,

148
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,870
creating very nice animations.

149
00:06:32,870 --> 00:06:36,413
We can tilt the curve with
the Control + T shortcut.

150
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:40,170
Let's now see how we can use this trick

151
00:06:40,170 --> 00:06:42,830
to animate our squirrel character.

152
00:06:42,830 --> 00:06:45,187
I will display the squirrel collection.

153
00:06:45,187 --> 00:06:46,020
I will move the current curve
into the arrow collection

154
00:06:49,849 --> 00:06:52,140
and I will press the
Shift + A in object mode

155
00:06:52,140 --> 00:06:53,770
to add a new curve.

156
00:06:53,770 --> 00:06:57,450
This is going to be our squirrel path.

157
00:06:57,450 --> 00:07:02,000
This time, instead of
constraining the squirrel object,

158
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:05,610
I will constrain the root
bone of our character.

159
00:07:05,610 --> 00:07:09,040
In pose mode, I can go
to the bone constraint,

160
00:07:09,040 --> 00:07:10,720
not the object constraint

161
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:13,530
and add a follow path constraint

162
00:07:13,530 --> 00:07:16,070
and source our curve.

163
00:07:16,070 --> 00:07:18,900
Now the root bone of
our character gets stuck

164
00:07:18,900 --> 00:07:20,770
at the beginning of the curve.

165
00:07:20,770 --> 00:07:23,110
If I click the Follow Curve option,

166
00:07:23,110 --> 00:07:26,620
I can see my character
getting align with the curve

167
00:07:26,620 --> 00:07:30,220
and if I now scrub, I can't see it moving

168
00:07:30,220 --> 00:07:33,860
because we need to click
the Animate Path button.

169
00:07:33,860 --> 00:07:35,630
And by default, our character

170
00:07:35,630 --> 00:07:39,980
will follow the curve and
reach the end on frame 100.

171
00:07:39,980 --> 00:07:43,010
To give a proper orientation
to our character,

172
00:07:43,010 --> 00:07:48,010
we need to switch to -y
as being the forward axis.

173
00:07:48,220 --> 00:07:52,020
Now our character is
properly following the path.

174
00:07:52,020 --> 00:07:53,470
A big warning here.

175
00:07:53,470 --> 00:07:56,063
Whenever you are using a curve modifier,

176
00:07:56,063 --> 00:07:58,411
make sure that the constraint object

177
00:07:58,411 --> 00:08:02,310
has its origin aligned with world space,

178
00:08:02,310 --> 00:08:05,640
meaning that its origin is reset

179
00:08:05,640 --> 00:08:07,270
because if you offset the object,

180
00:08:07,270 --> 00:08:10,110
the constraint will behave weirdly.

181
00:08:10,110 --> 00:08:12,310
You can move the curve as you want.

182
00:08:12,310 --> 00:08:14,760
The constraint object will follow

183
00:08:14,760 --> 00:08:16,720
but make sure that the constraint object

184
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:19,593
has all its transform channels reset.

185
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:23,540
Now that you understand
the curve constraint,

186
00:08:23,540 --> 00:08:25,560
you can go into edit mode

187
00:08:25,560 --> 00:08:27,860
and start building your motion path

188
00:08:27,860 --> 00:08:29,610
for your character.

189
00:08:29,610 --> 00:08:31,580
I'm doing it into a little time lapse

190
00:08:31,580 --> 00:08:34,610
because I'm using a simple rotation scale

191
00:08:34,610 --> 00:08:36,930
and extrude functions.

192
00:08:36,930 --> 00:08:41,350
My main advice is use as
less point as possible

193
00:08:41,350 --> 00:08:44,950
and try to have your curve
as smooth as possible.

194
00:08:44,950 --> 00:08:47,400
Also, you can use the bevel option

195
00:08:47,400 --> 00:08:49,880
to give a bit of thickness to your curve

196
00:08:49,880 --> 00:08:53,490
so that it's easier to
read along the tree trunk.

197
00:08:53,490 --> 00:08:56,850
The less control point
you set onto your curve,

198
00:08:56,850 --> 00:08:59,690
the easier it will be to keep it smooth

199
00:08:59,690 --> 00:09:01,900
and so the animation of your character

200
00:09:01,900 --> 00:09:03,750
will also be smooth.

201
00:09:03,750 --> 00:09:06,900
If you create hard
angles or too curvy path,

202
00:09:06,900 --> 00:09:08,810
then the animation of your character

203
00:09:08,810 --> 00:09:12,810
will look weird unless you
heavily edit the animation

204
00:09:12,810 --> 00:09:14,690
on top of the cycle.

205
00:09:14,690 --> 00:09:16,730
When you're satisfied with the path,

206
00:09:16,730 --> 00:09:20,470
you can zoom in and tweak
the tilt and position

207
00:09:20,470 --> 00:09:21,680
of the control point

208
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:25,180
so that your character
feet stick to the trunk

209
00:09:25,180 --> 00:09:26,790
and you avoid the clipping.

210
00:09:26,790 --> 00:09:29,540
Don't forget to double
check from camera view

211
00:09:29,540 --> 00:09:32,160
because sometimes, even if your character

212
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:34,690
is a bit floating, that's perfectly fine,

213
00:09:34,690 --> 00:09:39,080
'til it looks good from the
camera point of view as usual.

214
00:09:39,080 --> 00:09:40,310
Back to object mode,

215
00:09:40,310 --> 00:09:42,410
we need to set the correct speed

216
00:09:42,410 --> 00:09:44,730
for our character to climb the tree

217
00:09:44,730 --> 00:09:48,360
and we can do it by
modifying the frame's value

218
00:09:48,360 --> 00:09:50,520
into the curve's option.

219
00:09:50,520 --> 00:09:52,350
As the feet are moving backward,

220
00:09:52,350 --> 00:09:54,950
it means that our character animation

221
00:09:54,950 --> 00:09:57,150
is faster than the locomotion.

222
00:09:57,150 --> 00:10:00,250
So I need to reduce the frame's value.

223
00:10:00,250 --> 00:10:04,070
With a value of 70, it
seems that now the feet

224
00:10:04,070 --> 00:10:06,060
are sliding forward.

225
00:10:06,060 --> 00:10:09,510
So our character locomotion is too fast.

226
00:10:09,510 --> 00:10:12,220
So it's just a matter of trial and error

227
00:10:12,220 --> 00:10:14,430
to find the correct value.

228
00:10:14,430 --> 00:10:17,960
A value of 85 seems to work well for me.

229
00:10:17,960 --> 00:10:20,240
And it depends on the curve length.

230
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:22,713
So you may not have the same value.

231
00:10:23,820 --> 00:10:26,000
Another way to control the speed

232
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,380
at which our character is moving

233
00:10:28,380 --> 00:10:30,000
is to use the offset.

234
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,240
We can enable the fixed position.

235
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:34,910
Now our character is no longer moving

236
00:10:34,910 --> 00:10:38,840
and insert a keyframe
on the offset factor.

237
00:10:38,840 --> 00:10:41,610
I'm setting a value of zero on frame zero

238
00:10:41,610 --> 00:10:45,170
and on frame 85, a value of one.

239
00:10:45,170 --> 00:10:47,440
If I now go into the graph editor,

240
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:49,690
I will be able to see the curve

241
00:10:49,690 --> 00:10:51,860
of this animated value

242
00:10:51,860 --> 00:10:54,120
and we can see that there is easing in

243
00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:55,120
and easing out,

244
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:58,740
so our character is slowing
down and accelerating.

245
00:10:58,740 --> 00:11:00,250
What I do need to do

246
00:11:00,250 --> 00:11:03,150
is whether change the
interpolation of the curve

247
00:11:03,150 --> 00:11:05,880
to linear or select all the handles,

248
00:11:05,880 --> 00:11:08,060
press V, and switch to vector.

249
00:11:08,060 --> 00:11:10,440
The cool thing about choosing this method

250
00:11:10,440 --> 00:11:12,920
is that I can insert a keyframe

251
00:11:12,920 --> 00:11:16,040
whenever my character is about to jump.

252
00:11:16,040 --> 00:11:19,680
Then another keyframe
when he's just landing

253
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:22,630
and then I can offset a
bit the landing keyframe

254
00:11:22,630 --> 00:11:25,543
if I want my character
to make a larger jump.

255
00:11:26,400 --> 00:11:28,220
The only thing not to forget

256
00:11:28,220 --> 00:11:31,670
is to also offset the latest keyframe

257
00:11:31,670 --> 00:11:34,700
so that the interpolation
between those two keyframe

258
00:11:34,700 --> 00:11:39,700
doesn't change, and so our
character speed remain the same.

259
00:11:39,860 --> 00:11:43,800
But between frame 22 and frame 29 here,

260
00:11:43,800 --> 00:11:46,670
the speed of my character
is no longer the same

261
00:11:46,670 --> 00:11:49,550
and it seems he's doing a bigger jump.

262
00:11:49,550 --> 00:11:51,800
This is a little trick that will allow you

263
00:11:51,800 --> 00:11:54,350
to break the rhythm of your animation

264
00:11:54,350 --> 00:11:56,530
and make it more appealing.

265
00:11:56,530 --> 00:11:57,723
At least, less linear.

266
00:11:58,910 --> 00:12:00,680
This is the end of this chapter.

267
00:12:00,680 --> 00:12:02,794
You now know everything to be able

268
00:12:02,794 --> 00:12:05,680
to create the same shot as I did.

269
00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:09,360
Don't forget that failing
is a part of the process

270
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:12,140
but giving up is not
a part of the process.

271
00:12:12,140 --> 00:12:13,830
Stay strong, repeat

272
00:12:13,830 --> 00:12:16,000
and I will see you in the next chapter

273
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:19,250
where we will learn new
animation techniques.

274
00:12:19,250 --> 00:12:22,800
To summarize, we have seen
that we can use a 3D curve

275
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:27,000
as an animated path for
an object to follow.

276
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:30,070
We can use parenting or path constraint.

277
00:12:30,070 --> 00:12:33,200
The frames' value determines the time

278
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:35,940
to travel along the whole curve.

279
00:12:35,940 --> 00:12:40,940
We can use the offset value
to delay the path animation.

280
00:12:41,090 --> 00:12:42,840
We can use the curve to scale

281
00:12:42,840 --> 00:12:45,520
and tilt the constrained object.

282
00:12:45,520 --> 00:12:48,150
We can use the constraint on a bone.

283
00:12:48,150 --> 00:12:51,320
Make sure the origin of
the constrained object

284
00:12:51,320 --> 00:12:53,770
is reset to world origin

285
00:12:53,770 --> 00:12:56,913
before applying the curve constraint.
