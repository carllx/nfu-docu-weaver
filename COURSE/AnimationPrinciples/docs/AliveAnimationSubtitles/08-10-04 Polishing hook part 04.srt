1
00:00:01,250 --> 00:00:02,890
- [Instructor] Time to move on to the arms

2
00:00:02,890 --> 00:00:06,060
to finish the polishing
of the hook portion

3
00:00:06,060 --> 00:00:07,760
of this animation.

4
00:00:07,760 --> 00:00:09,760
As explained in the previous video,

5
00:00:09,760 --> 00:00:12,690
when it comes to the arm,
I don't rely that much

6
00:00:12,690 --> 00:00:14,150
on the graph editor,

7
00:00:14,150 --> 00:00:17,730
but more on the motion
path drawn by the elbow

8
00:00:17,730 --> 00:00:19,627
and the wrist of the character.

9
00:00:19,627 --> 00:00:21,370
But I will repeat myself here,

10
00:00:21,370 --> 00:00:24,930
when it come to the torso
routes or the torso in general,

11
00:00:24,930 --> 00:00:27,193
using the graph editor is super important

12
00:00:27,193 --> 00:00:29,830
because the position
curved for the torso route

13
00:00:29,830 --> 00:00:31,860
or even defeat absence.

14
00:00:31,860 --> 00:00:35,140
But when it comes to the
quaternion rotation of the arm,

15
00:00:35,140 --> 00:00:37,580
it becomes a little more abstract.

16
00:00:37,580 --> 00:00:40,630
I'm not saying here that
it doesn't make sense,

17
00:00:40,630 --> 00:00:43,420
but since we are mixing orientation

18
00:00:43,420 --> 00:00:46,820
and no longer rotation
as when using eulers,

19
00:00:46,820 --> 00:00:49,750
quaternions behavior is not linear

20
00:00:49,750 --> 00:00:52,680
and might change depending on the space

21
00:00:52,680 --> 00:00:54,530
you are animating your character.

22
00:00:54,530 --> 00:00:56,650
For example, in our case,

23
00:00:56,650 --> 00:01:00,600
the arms are not following
the rotation of the torso

24
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:04,570
based on the orientation of
the character and ward space,

25
00:01:04,570 --> 00:01:08,410
the behavior of the quaternion
curves of the arm may change.

26
00:01:08,410 --> 00:01:11,600
Again, we don't need to know
all the technical details

27
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:13,710
of all quaternion behaves.

28
00:01:13,710 --> 00:01:18,230
The curve will make sense
on portion of your animation

29
00:01:18,230 --> 00:01:22,100
and your goal is to get
nice arc and nice spacing,

30
00:01:22,100 --> 00:01:24,060
so just focus on this.

31
00:01:24,060 --> 00:01:27,550
In time I started polishing
the right shoulder.

32
00:01:27,550 --> 00:01:30,110
Everything here is about tweaking the X

33
00:01:30,110 --> 00:01:31,781
and Z rotation curves,

34
00:01:31,781 --> 00:01:35,760
avoiding to touch the Y
rotation curve that much,

35
00:01:35,760 --> 00:01:37,780
even if you can touch it.

36
00:01:37,780 --> 00:01:40,470
And make sure that the
shoulder are droppings,

37
00:01:40,470 --> 00:01:43,160
so whenever the torso is twisting back,

38
00:01:43,160 --> 00:01:46,260
the shoulder will be delayed forward.

39
00:01:46,260 --> 00:01:49,801
When the torso is going down,
the shoulder will raise a bit.

40
00:01:49,801 --> 00:01:52,660
And when the torso is going up,

41
00:01:52,660 --> 00:01:54,740
the shoulder will lower a bit.

42
00:01:54,740 --> 00:01:57,530
Here, I'm working on
the rotation of the arm

43
00:01:57,530 --> 00:01:59,140
from the camera point of view.

44
00:01:59,140 --> 00:02:02,370
Before I do so, I've
calculated the motion paths

45
00:02:02,370 --> 00:02:03,310
of the wrist.

46
00:02:03,310 --> 00:02:06,450
And as you can see, it
makes a jagged stroke

47
00:02:06,450 --> 00:02:09,330
instead of having a nice C shape curve.

48
00:02:09,330 --> 00:02:12,010
I will mix the use of the graph editor,

49
00:02:12,010 --> 00:02:16,140
but also directly posing
the arm in the 3D view,

50
00:02:16,140 --> 00:02:19,610
until I get the smooth arc in the 3D view.

51
00:02:19,610 --> 00:02:22,440
I'm mixing the rotation
of the arm controller

52
00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:24,350
with the forearm controller

53
00:02:24,350 --> 00:02:28,510
whenever I need to open a
little more the forearm.

54
00:02:28,510 --> 00:02:32,232
Regarding the forearm, since
it's using euler rotation,

55
00:02:32,232 --> 00:02:35,710
the graph editor does
make a little more sense.

56
00:02:35,710 --> 00:02:38,600
So whenever the elbow is going back,

57
00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:41,770
I will bend the arm inward.

58
00:02:41,770 --> 00:02:46,460
And as the elbow stop and go
back, I will open the arm.

59
00:02:46,460 --> 00:02:50,070
The idea is to make the hand
drag compared to the elbow.

60
00:02:50,070 --> 00:02:52,090
And after a few additional tweak,

61
00:02:52,090 --> 00:02:54,830
even if I don't get a perfect result,

62
00:02:54,830 --> 00:02:56,870
I get a way better arc,

63
00:02:56,870 --> 00:03:00,150
and it will drastically
improve my animation.

64
00:03:00,150 --> 00:03:02,560
Another thing that I have taken care of

65
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:05,130
and we might not see in this recalled,

66
00:03:05,130 --> 00:03:08,900
is that the right arm is
no longer crossing the eyes

67
00:03:08,900 --> 00:03:12,004
of the character when getting
back in front of the head.

68
00:03:12,004 --> 00:03:14,220
It's still crossing the head,

69
00:03:14,220 --> 00:03:17,000
but they've kept the arm
from being awkwardly did

70
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,100
by the right arm.

71
00:03:18,100 --> 00:03:20,650
Regarding the arm tweaking,
you can see that here,

72
00:03:20,650 --> 00:03:23,980
I'm executing exactly
the same thing as before.

73
00:03:23,980 --> 00:03:27,710
I'm polishing the arc so that
it looks a little better.

74
00:03:27,710 --> 00:03:29,360
So I'm tweaking the position of the arm

75
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:32,400
until I get a smoother arc.

76
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:35,010
From there, I will switch
back to the camera view

77
00:03:35,010 --> 00:03:39,090
and work a bit on the forearm
during the stroke of the hook.

78
00:03:39,090 --> 00:03:42,250
The idea is to make sure
that the current pose

79
00:03:42,250 --> 00:03:46,440
is blending as well as
possible with the next pose.

80
00:03:46,440 --> 00:03:49,610
So, I need to lead a bit
the motion of the arm

81
00:03:49,610 --> 00:03:51,610
with the elbow by raising it.

82
00:03:51,610 --> 00:03:54,430
And from there, I will start
to use the tweaker bone

83
00:03:54,430 --> 00:03:59,430
of the arms to slightly curve
the arm into the next shape.

84
00:03:59,830 --> 00:04:02,820
It's like I'm starting
to blurred the smear,

85
00:04:02,820 --> 00:04:04,090
but just to touch.

86
00:04:04,090 --> 00:04:05,890
The arm is starting to work,

87
00:04:05,890 --> 00:04:08,970
but it's still have some
kind of natural shape.

88
00:04:08,970 --> 00:04:11,600
From there, I've been
tweaking all the controllers

89
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:15,310
one by one to create the
recoil of the right arm

90
00:04:15,310 --> 00:04:17,700
just after the hook hit the bag.

91
00:04:17,700 --> 00:04:20,450
Just after the hook hits the back,

92
00:04:20,450 --> 00:04:23,220
the right shoulder is projected back.

93
00:04:23,220 --> 00:04:27,290
And then, when we've one frame
of delay, so does the elbow.

94
00:04:27,290 --> 00:04:30,220
All these secondary movement
will happen upon four

95
00:04:30,220 --> 00:04:31,290
to five frame.

96
00:04:31,290 --> 00:04:34,800
To keep it as clean as
possible, I will do as usual.

97
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:37,420
I will start with the base of the chain

98
00:04:37,420 --> 00:04:39,820
and then go further along.

99
00:04:39,820 --> 00:04:43,400
So, I will start with the
shoulder and a couple of frame

100
00:04:43,400 --> 00:04:46,130
after the punch contact with the bag,

101
00:04:46,130 --> 00:04:48,780
I will push the shoulder backward.

102
00:04:48,780 --> 00:04:51,480
And then two or three frames later,

103
00:04:51,480 --> 00:04:55,620
the shoulder will get back to
some kind of normal position.

104
00:04:55,620 --> 00:04:59,180
From there, I can work on
the right arm controller.

105
00:04:59,180 --> 00:05:01,100
And to other point of reference,

106
00:05:01,100 --> 00:05:03,090
I will track the right elbow.

107
00:05:03,090 --> 00:05:07,200
For the time being, the right
elbow draws a pretty nice arc,

108
00:05:07,200 --> 00:05:09,213
but what I want to try to do,

109
00:05:09,213 --> 00:05:13,350
is to reduce the spacing between
those different key frames.

110
00:05:13,350 --> 00:05:16,460
If from the camera view I'm able to group

111
00:05:16,460 --> 00:05:20,590
those different point in
space into a single point

112
00:05:20,590 --> 00:05:23,240
or making them very
close one to the other,

113
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:26,150
it will feel like the
elbow is pin in place.

114
00:05:26,150 --> 00:05:29,790
And it will increase the
sensation of popping of the elbow.

115
00:05:29,790 --> 00:05:32,520
This is typically the kind
of thing we want to avoid

116
00:05:32,520 --> 00:05:34,090
whenever we are animating,

117
00:05:34,090 --> 00:05:38,140
to a have bunch of keys gather
one on top of the other,

118
00:05:38,140 --> 00:05:42,500
but in this case, I want
to have this pop on screen

119
00:05:42,500 --> 00:05:44,570
so that it brings more impact.

120
00:05:44,570 --> 00:05:46,780
Another little detail we can't see here,

121
00:05:46,780 --> 00:05:50,420
is that both arm are
overlapping one on the other,

122
00:05:50,420 --> 00:05:52,130
so it will make the
silhouette of the character

123
00:05:52,130 --> 00:05:53,840
a little odder to rip.

124
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:57,420
So upon the one frame, I will
just spread a bit the arms,

125
00:05:57,420 --> 00:05:59,430
so that they separate better.

126
00:05:59,430 --> 00:06:00,993
At least on one frame.

127
00:06:02,380 --> 00:06:05,290
It's now time to work on the left arm,

128
00:06:05,290 --> 00:06:07,760
and on the first frame until the hook,

129
00:06:07,760 --> 00:06:09,600
I didn't do that much.

130
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:14,080
I did find two examples, is I
did move a bit the curve here

131
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:15,990
and there are to try different timing,

132
00:06:15,990 --> 00:06:19,770
but in the end, I stick
to what I add already

133
00:06:19,770 --> 00:06:21,080
from the broken stage.

134
00:06:21,080 --> 00:06:24,250
So, let's jump a little
further to the current hook.

135
00:06:24,250 --> 00:06:26,640
To be able to track the
alchemy by the shoulder,

136
00:06:26,640 --> 00:06:29,360
I've used the tweaker
bones that is attached

137
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:31,070
on the route of the arm.

138
00:06:31,070 --> 00:06:33,810
Note that the camera shake
can be a bit disturbing

139
00:06:33,810 --> 00:06:37,713
to be able to properly follow
the arc of the shoulder.

140
00:06:37,713 --> 00:06:42,240
A little reminder, you can
temporarily disable a modifier

141
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:46,170
by simply selecting the
bones at all the modifier,

142
00:06:46,170 --> 00:06:48,900
and click on the little wrench icon.

143
00:06:48,900 --> 00:06:51,690
This will mute all the modifier assign

144
00:06:51,690 --> 00:06:53,530
to the current transformed channel,

145
00:06:53,530 --> 00:06:56,370
and make the current frame
a little easier to read.

146
00:06:56,370 --> 00:07:00,010
Click the wrench icon again to
re-enable all the modifiers.

147
00:07:00,010 --> 00:07:02,150
So back into my 3D scene,

148
00:07:02,150 --> 00:07:05,650
I will select the tweaker
bone and calculate its arc.

149
00:07:05,650 --> 00:07:08,070
So, I really want it to push the shoulder

150
00:07:08,070 --> 00:07:11,980
as fast possible just
after the fist hit the bag.

151
00:07:11,980 --> 00:07:14,520
And I'm working the pose from camera view.

152
00:07:14,520 --> 00:07:17,330
This is some things that
will really need to be read

153
00:07:17,330 --> 00:07:18,730
from the camera angle.

154
00:07:18,730 --> 00:07:21,280
Then you can turn around
your character to make sure

155
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:23,390
that it doesn't goes too crazy.

156
00:07:23,390 --> 00:07:25,540
And right after this overshoot,

157
00:07:25,540 --> 00:07:28,680
I'm pulling the shoulder
back so that we do feel

158
00:07:28,680 --> 00:07:30,870
that the bag is resisting.

159
00:07:30,870 --> 00:07:34,580
This will create super odd
angle in the motion path,

160
00:07:34,580 --> 00:07:36,180
just up to a frame 47,

161
00:07:36,180 --> 00:07:38,980
then it will bounce back on frame 49

162
00:07:38,980 --> 00:07:41,880
before recovering on frame 52.

163
00:07:41,880 --> 00:07:44,870
So, I have an overshoot over one frame,

164
00:07:44,870 --> 00:07:47,080
then a bounce over two frame,

165
00:07:47,080 --> 00:07:50,060
and then a recover over three frames.

166
00:07:50,060 --> 00:07:52,720
This will create a nice shoulder bounce

167
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:56,463
that will better sell the
impact again of the hook.

168
00:07:57,300 --> 00:08:00,620
From there, we can start
working on the arm controller.

169
00:08:00,620 --> 00:08:04,100
So as usual, we need to track the elbow

170
00:08:04,100 --> 00:08:06,770
and see if we get clean arcs.

171
00:08:06,770 --> 00:08:10,500
One thing that struck me
here is that the elbow

172
00:08:10,500 --> 00:08:14,260
is traveling faster than the
shoulder on this specific part

173
00:08:14,260 --> 00:08:15,660
of the animation.

174
00:08:15,660 --> 00:08:19,710
So, I do need to make the
elbow or the arm controller

175
00:08:19,710 --> 00:08:20,543
to drag.

176
00:08:20,543 --> 00:08:24,000
In the graph editor, it means
that I will push my curve

177
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,160
toward the previous value.

178
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:29,230
And if I feel like I can't
reach the pose I want

179
00:08:29,230 --> 00:08:32,360
using the curve, I can
simply pose by hand.

180
00:08:32,360 --> 00:08:34,890
From there, I will be
tracking the hand controller.

181
00:08:34,890 --> 00:08:38,070
You can also track the
elbow as same before.

182
00:08:38,070 --> 00:08:42,740
And here, what I want to
do is try to avoid the hand

183
00:08:42,740 --> 00:08:45,610
to overlap on the eyes of my character.

184
00:08:45,610 --> 00:08:48,490
This is something to consider exclusively

185
00:08:48,490 --> 00:08:49,610
from the camera view,

186
00:08:49,610 --> 00:08:52,930
since this is what your
audience is going to see.

187
00:08:52,930 --> 00:08:55,694
Once I fixed this little issue,

188
00:08:55,694 --> 00:08:59,380
everything will be
about getting a nice arc

189
00:08:59,380 --> 00:09:01,900
and respecting the hierarchy.

190
00:09:01,900 --> 00:09:05,300
So in this case, making
the hand drag a bit

191
00:09:05,300 --> 00:09:06,480
compared to the elbow.

192
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:09,110
At some point, creating
this dragging effect

193
00:09:09,110 --> 00:09:10,990
became pretty subtle.

194
00:09:10,990 --> 00:09:13,450
It's just about rotating a bit the hand

195
00:09:13,450 --> 00:09:15,330
toward its previous position.

196
00:09:15,330 --> 00:09:18,880
Then I'm checking the
arcs made around frame 40.

197
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:22,010
The keys are grouping a
bit in the camera view

198
00:09:22,010 --> 00:09:23,140
and that's okay,

199
00:09:23,140 --> 00:09:26,330
but I will see if I can
refine a bit the arc

200
00:09:26,330 --> 00:09:28,510
using the forearm controller.

201
00:09:28,510 --> 00:09:31,810
That's okay to have grouped
points here in space,

202
00:09:31,810 --> 00:09:34,150
but if you can make a smoother arc,

203
00:09:34,150 --> 00:09:37,800
that's always a little
improvement of your animation.

204
00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:42,280
The keys here are bunched up
because we are into moving hold

205
00:09:42,280 --> 00:09:45,500
and we don't want the forearm to overshoot

206
00:09:45,500 --> 00:09:49,090
because our character is
getting very contracted.

207
00:09:49,090 --> 00:09:51,290
So it's controlling its arm.

208
00:09:51,290 --> 00:09:55,090
Its arm is not lose, be very
cautious we've overshoot.

209
00:09:55,090 --> 00:09:56,960
When I was a younger animator,

210
00:09:56,960 --> 00:09:59,140
I tend to put them everywhere.

211
00:09:59,140 --> 00:10:01,150
So it looks fun and cool,

212
00:10:01,150 --> 00:10:04,600
but at some point it doesn't
really translate everything

213
00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:06,310
in your animation correctly.

214
00:10:06,310 --> 00:10:10,290
In certain case, you want
hard stop in your emotion

215
00:10:10,290 --> 00:10:14,180
or sharp angled arcs as we did
for the shoulder overshoot,

216
00:10:14,180 --> 00:10:15,890
just after the impact.

217
00:10:15,890 --> 00:10:18,530
Here, on this mirror
frame, I'm scaling a bit

218
00:10:18,530 --> 00:10:21,910
the tweaker bones to get a
better silhouette of the arm.

219
00:10:21,910 --> 00:10:25,370
On the next frame, I will
elongate a bit the forearm

220
00:10:25,370 --> 00:10:27,180
using the tweaker bones.

221
00:10:27,180 --> 00:10:29,280
I will also stretch the hand.

222
00:10:29,280 --> 00:10:31,540
This has a couple of benefits.

223
00:10:31,540 --> 00:10:34,830
First, we better see the
left eye of the character.

224
00:10:34,830 --> 00:10:37,870
Second, it increased speed feeling.

225
00:10:37,870 --> 00:10:42,690
So, I'm stretching the fast
moving part exactly as we did

226
00:10:42,690 --> 00:10:45,820
with the bouncing ball in
the very first chapters.

227
00:10:45,820 --> 00:10:48,538
Now, from there, let's get to be creative.

228
00:10:48,538 --> 00:10:51,368
Instead of simply punching the bag,

229
00:10:51,368 --> 00:10:54,816
we will squash the arm against the bag.

230
00:10:54,816 --> 00:10:58,820
And I want to create some
kind of shockwave effect

231
00:10:58,820 --> 00:11:00,340
within the forearm.

232
00:11:00,340 --> 00:11:02,910
If you watch carefully
these frame by frame,

233
00:11:02,910 --> 00:11:05,810
you can see the elbow getting bigger.

234
00:11:05,810 --> 00:11:09,950
And then this big shape
traveling through the forearm

235
00:11:09,950 --> 00:11:12,280
until it reaches the fist.

236
00:11:12,280 --> 00:11:15,000
A bit as in the old school cartoon,

237
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,780
when a character was swallowing something,

238
00:11:17,780 --> 00:11:21,010
or when someone was
shooting with a big cannon.

239
00:11:21,010 --> 00:11:23,370
Again, here, there is no magical trick.

240
00:11:23,370 --> 00:11:27,560
I'm just sculpting the arm of
the character frame by frame.

241
00:11:27,560 --> 00:11:30,610
There is no magical
graph editor shenanigans

242
00:11:30,610 --> 00:11:32,920
to get to this kind of result.

243
00:11:32,920 --> 00:11:36,260
So as we did before, I will
select all the tweaker bone

244
00:11:36,260 --> 00:11:39,270
and I will insert the key
frame on all the frame

245
00:11:39,270 --> 00:11:42,107
of the specific section of the animation.

246
00:11:42,107 --> 00:11:46,030
This way we are sure that there
won't be any interpolation

247
00:11:46,030 --> 00:11:49,700
of those controller if we forget to reset

248
00:11:49,700 --> 00:11:51,190
their transformed channels.

249
00:11:51,190 --> 00:11:54,940
From there, frame by frame,
I will start by scaling

250
00:11:54,940 --> 00:11:56,380
the elbow area,

251
00:11:56,380 --> 00:11:59,150
then the middle of the forearm.

252
00:11:59,150 --> 00:12:01,170
And finally, the fist.

253
00:12:01,170 --> 00:12:04,210
Another thing I will do during this stage,

254
00:12:04,210 --> 00:12:08,610
is to make sure that the
wrist doesn't move that much

255
00:12:08,610 --> 00:12:13,140
in space, as if the
fist was hitting a wall.

256
00:12:13,140 --> 00:12:16,030
And we will be able to see
this on the motion path

257
00:12:16,030 --> 00:12:17,530
of the wrist controller.

258
00:12:17,530 --> 00:12:21,400
As keys will be bunched
toward the area of the punch.

259
00:12:21,400 --> 00:12:24,549
In this section, the camera
shake is a bit distracting.

260
00:12:24,549 --> 00:12:28,470
So what I will do is that
I will exit pose mode

261
00:12:28,470 --> 00:12:30,160
with our character.

262
00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:32,950
I will end eyed to dolly camera rig,

263
00:12:32,950 --> 00:12:35,200
I will select the aim controller

264
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:37,310
that hold the noise modifier,

265
00:12:37,310 --> 00:12:41,810
and I will click the wrench
icon to disable the modifier.

266
00:12:41,810 --> 00:12:44,000
This way it's a little more comfortable

267
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:47,330
to double check my animation
from the camera view.

268
00:12:47,330 --> 00:12:50,350
From there, I can use
the wrist tweaker bone

269
00:12:50,350 --> 00:12:53,320
and stabilize the position of the fist

270
00:12:53,320 --> 00:12:55,330
in the camera view space.

271
00:12:55,330 --> 00:12:59,100
If needed, we can also tweak
a bit the position of the arm.

272
00:12:59,100 --> 00:13:02,670
The idea is to influence
the tip of the chain,

273
00:13:02,670 --> 00:13:04,770
which is our fist, actually.

274
00:13:04,770 --> 00:13:09,770
From there, I spent most of the
time trying to clean the arm

275
00:13:09,790 --> 00:13:14,790
and fist trajectory so that I
have no glitches into my arcs

276
00:13:15,320 --> 00:13:17,120
or into the motion path.

277
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:20,970
Especially when the character
was pulling his fist back

278
00:13:20,970 --> 00:13:24,320
because we have been sculpting the poses

279
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:28,550
during the punch frame by
frame so there is no surprise.

280
00:13:28,550 --> 00:13:31,930
But we haven't checked the
next step in this animation,

281
00:13:31,930 --> 00:13:35,190
which is when the character
is pulling his arm back.

282
00:13:35,190 --> 00:13:38,940
So here, I'm making sure
that the elbow leads

283
00:13:38,940 --> 00:13:40,470
the motion backwards.

284
00:13:40,470 --> 00:13:44,690
So the elbow drops first
and then the fist follow.

285
00:13:44,690 --> 00:13:47,170
I will recalculate the motion paths

286
00:13:47,170 --> 00:13:50,254
from the wrist tweaker controller.

287
00:13:50,254 --> 00:13:53,770
And here, I want to get rid of the zigzag

288
00:13:53,770 --> 00:13:55,210
in the motion path.

289
00:13:55,210 --> 00:13:58,800
It will create a little
visual glitch while the fist

290
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:03,370
of our character is slowing
down as he's pulling it.

291
00:14:03,370 --> 00:14:05,650
It's not a fast action.

292
00:14:05,650 --> 00:14:08,900
So as explain before, when
we have a very fast action,

293
00:14:08,900 --> 00:14:12,810
it's okay to have harsh
angles into our arcs,

294
00:14:12,810 --> 00:14:15,393
but here, it doesn't look really good.

295
00:14:16,640 --> 00:14:20,000
Exit, I will be manipulating
both the forearm controller

296
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:23,680
and the arm controller to
make sure that I don't mess

297
00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:24,676
with the elbow.

298
00:14:24,676 --> 00:14:27,990
I have calculated the
motion path of the elbow,

299
00:14:27,990 --> 00:14:29,860
but also of the wrist.

300
00:14:29,860 --> 00:14:34,120
And look at the arcs, all
I'm slowly smoothing them.

301
00:14:34,120 --> 00:14:37,310
As soon as I will be done
with polishing those arcs,

302
00:14:37,310 --> 00:14:40,730
I will be able to jump
in the very last segment

303
00:14:40,730 --> 00:14:44,510
of the animation, which is
the switch and the kick.

304
00:14:44,510 --> 00:14:45,500
For the time being,

305
00:14:45,500 --> 00:14:49,710
I will let you with a
time-lapse of the full process

306
00:14:49,710 --> 00:14:51,390
for the hook polishing.

307
00:14:51,390 --> 00:14:53,343
And I will see you in the next video.
