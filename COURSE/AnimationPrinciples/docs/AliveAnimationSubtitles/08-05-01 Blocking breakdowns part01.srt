1
00:00:00,260 --> 00:00:02,400
- With our golden poses done,

2
00:00:02,400 --> 00:00:04,880
it's time to add some breakdowns.

3
00:00:04,880 --> 00:00:07,810
The goal of those
additional poses is to have

4
00:00:07,810 --> 00:00:11,120
a better grasp on the
flow of the animation.

5
00:00:11,120 --> 00:00:14,340
We will build the first step into the jab,

6
00:00:14,340 --> 00:00:16,490
which is the anticipation of the jab.

7
00:00:16,490 --> 00:00:19,860
Then the transition into the right cross

8
00:00:19,860 --> 00:00:21,800
and the right cross overshoot

9
00:00:21,800 --> 00:00:25,040
really help to communicate
the power into dispatch.

10
00:00:25,040 --> 00:00:28,190
Then we will add a couple
of poses after the hook

11
00:00:28,190 --> 00:00:30,940
to show the steps taken by the character

12
00:00:30,940 --> 00:00:34,240
to get back into idle before
performing the switch kick.

13
00:00:34,240 --> 00:00:36,450
We'll create the transition jump

14
00:00:36,450 --> 00:00:39,140
into the anticipation of the switch kick

15
00:00:39,140 --> 00:00:40,250
that is already blocked.

16
00:00:40,250 --> 00:00:41,950
After the kicking pose

17
00:00:41,950 --> 00:00:44,270
we will add an overshoot of the leg

18
00:00:44,270 --> 00:00:46,570
that will sell the power of the kick.

19
00:00:46,570 --> 00:00:49,630
And finally, we will add a transition pose

20
00:00:49,630 --> 00:00:54,630
before the two steps we have
already blocked back into idle.

21
00:00:54,950 --> 00:00:56,300
Before building those poses,

22
00:00:56,300 --> 00:00:57,950
I've watched the reference and

23
00:00:57,950 --> 00:01:01,300
I've spot the frame that
were interesting to me.

24
00:01:01,300 --> 00:01:05,150
Like this pose in between
the idle and the first jab

25
00:01:05,150 --> 00:01:07,530
character is lowering
his center of gravity

26
00:01:07,530 --> 00:01:09,370
and also pushing forward.

27
00:01:09,370 --> 00:01:12,030
So it will be a great anticipation.

28
00:01:12,030 --> 00:01:15,710
I've also noticed that the
character is slightly dropping

29
00:01:15,710 --> 00:01:17,820
his hands during this anticipation.

30
00:01:17,820 --> 00:01:20,196
As a person pose for a walk cycle,

31
00:01:20,196 --> 00:01:23,580
I'm trying to find a good break down

32
00:01:23,580 --> 00:01:26,680
and the time where the character
is pulling his left hand

33
00:01:26,680 --> 00:01:28,750
and pushing with the right hand

34
00:01:28,750 --> 00:01:30,830
seems to be pretty nice.

35
00:01:30,830 --> 00:01:33,030
Also adding notes as a reminder,

36
00:01:33,030 --> 00:01:36,630
that the torso is twisting
a lot on this pose,

37
00:01:36,630 --> 00:01:38,810
Then I will spot the overshoot.

38
00:01:38,810 --> 00:01:41,710
If your reference doesn't
show the next move,

39
00:01:41,710 --> 00:01:44,330
just put note on top of this and make sure

40
00:01:44,330 --> 00:01:46,830
that you look for new reference later on.

41
00:01:46,830 --> 00:01:49,900
So this is something I've
been doing for every poses

42
00:01:49,900 --> 00:01:53,050
I wanted to add into the blocking stage.

43
00:01:53,050 --> 00:01:55,260
As in the previous videos our goal

44
00:01:55,260 --> 00:02:00,260
is not necessarily to copy
100% the exact same poses.

45
00:02:00,610 --> 00:02:04,500
But to check the body
mechanisms that are involved

46
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:07,880
and then push them to make our animation

47
00:02:07,880 --> 00:02:10,280
more exaggerated and more appealing.

48
00:02:10,280 --> 00:02:13,640
So let's work the step
forward into the jab.

49
00:02:13,640 --> 00:02:16,860
As usual, I will try to
define the line of action.

50
00:02:16,860 --> 00:02:20,740
The simple C shape the front
foot is currently raising

51
00:02:20,740 --> 00:02:22,520
while the back foot is pushing.

52
00:02:22,520 --> 00:02:26,890
So as before I generally scrub
around the current frame to

53
00:02:26,890 --> 00:02:30,550
check out the motion of the
different parts of the body,

54
00:02:30,550 --> 00:02:32,770
the hands, the head, the feet,

55
00:02:32,770 --> 00:02:34,490
so that I don't forget to put them.

56
00:02:34,490 --> 00:02:38,110
And also I could choose whether
I favorite the front foot

57
00:02:38,110 --> 00:02:40,870
to move further away or to be closer,

58
00:02:40,870 --> 00:02:44,190
to drop more the feet, to lean
more the character forward,

59
00:02:44,190 --> 00:02:47,840
make any choice to
exaggerate the current pose.

60
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:50,750
Now in blender I will insert a key frame

61
00:02:50,750 --> 00:02:52,997
for all the controllers
of both the character

62
00:02:52,997 --> 00:02:54,980
and the bag on the frame seven.

63
00:02:54,980 --> 00:02:58,200
Again, at this stage, we
don't care about timing.

64
00:02:58,200 --> 00:03:00,910
We can do it on frame seven
or eight doesn't matter.

65
00:03:00,910 --> 00:03:03,870
Then I want to get rid of the rest pose

66
00:03:03,870 --> 00:03:05,420
we have on frame zero.

67
00:03:05,420 --> 00:03:08,520
So I will duplicate
frame five on frame zero.

68
00:03:08,520 --> 00:03:10,114
When working on an animation,

69
00:03:10,114 --> 00:03:12,880
if it's not a gameplay animation,

70
00:03:12,880 --> 00:03:16,540
I you advise you to keep five
frames also in the beginning

71
00:03:16,540 --> 00:03:19,840
in the still pose so
that you can get prepared

72
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:22,200
to what is coming next.

73
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:24,660
If you start your
animation from frame zero,

74
00:03:24,660 --> 00:03:27,460
sometime it's a bit hard to read.

75
00:03:27,460 --> 00:03:29,530
The difference between this new pose

76
00:03:29,530 --> 00:03:32,220
and the previous one won't be that big.

77
00:03:32,220 --> 00:03:35,070
First I want to lower
the center of gravity

78
00:03:35,070 --> 00:03:39,610
as our character is gathering
energy to throw the punch.

79
00:03:39,610 --> 00:03:43,010
Then I pushed the center
of gravity forward.

80
00:03:43,010 --> 00:03:46,228
As our character is
already moving forward.

81
00:03:46,228 --> 00:03:50,180
The left foot is raised a little bit and

82
00:03:50,180 --> 00:03:52,740
slightly rotated towards the inside

83
00:03:52,740 --> 00:03:56,160
because it's going to leave
the ground on the next frame.

84
00:03:56,160 --> 00:03:59,850
And so the center of gravity
will shift a bit to the left.

85
00:03:59,850 --> 00:04:04,010
The character is pushing
toward his left foot

86
00:04:04,010 --> 00:04:05,330
with his right foot.

87
00:04:05,330 --> 00:04:08,320
So you have to move the
cog a bit to the left.

88
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:11,080
Then I do a few adjustment with the arm,

89
00:04:11,080 --> 00:04:13,000
making them dragging it.

90
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:16,250
So I raised the shoulder
as the center of gravity

91
00:04:16,250 --> 00:04:17,820
is getting lower.

92
00:04:17,820 --> 00:04:22,050
I open the hand as the
whole body's moving forward

93
00:04:22,050 --> 00:04:26,890
as if there was wind blowing
into the palm of the character

94
00:04:26,890 --> 00:04:29,420
and I do the same with
the neck and the head.

95
00:04:29,420 --> 00:04:33,093
As it drop into the step
I slightly raise his chin.

96
00:04:34,089 --> 00:04:35,130
(swishing noise)

97
00:04:35,130 --> 00:04:37,670
When we watch the reference
for the next pose,

98
00:04:37,670 --> 00:04:40,860
we can see that the character
is currently pulling

99
00:04:40,860 --> 00:04:45,170
the left arm and bring it close
to his chin to protect it.

100
00:04:45,170 --> 00:04:47,720
In the meantime, the
right arm is traveling

101
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:49,240
towards the target.

102
00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:51,130
The hips are twisting a lot.

103
00:04:51,130 --> 00:04:54,840
The center of gravity too
and the chest is twisting,

104
00:04:54,840 --> 00:04:56,710
but dragging a little bit.

105
00:04:56,710 --> 00:05:00,010
Finally, the right foot is rotating a lot.

106
00:05:00,010 --> 00:05:03,320
So those are the main point
we are going to address

107
00:05:03,320 --> 00:05:05,260
into our breakdown pose.

108
00:05:05,260 --> 00:05:07,700
As for the previous pose
I will add a key frame

109
00:05:07,700 --> 00:05:09,700
on all the controllers of the bag

110
00:05:09,700 --> 00:05:11,830
and the character on frame 12.

111
00:05:11,830 --> 00:05:14,910
Again, at this stage, we
don't care about timing.

112
00:05:14,910 --> 00:05:17,480
Since the location of
the feet doesn't change

113
00:05:17,480 --> 00:05:20,090
between the previous and the next pose

114
00:05:20,090 --> 00:05:23,190
we can directly work on
the center of gravity

115
00:05:23,190 --> 00:05:24,023
of the character.

116
00:05:24,023 --> 00:05:26,800
As the character is twisting to his left,

117
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:31,640
his center of gravity is also
shifting to the left foot.

118
00:05:31,640 --> 00:05:33,950
So we need to twist the center of gravity

119
00:05:33,950 --> 00:05:36,520
but we also need to move it to the left.

120
00:05:36,520 --> 00:05:39,530
Just imagine that the character is diving

121
00:05:39,530 --> 00:05:43,040
into the next punch
with his left shoulder.

122
00:05:43,040 --> 00:05:46,163
As seen in the reference the
right foot is rotating a lot.

123
00:05:46,163 --> 00:05:51,163
So I rotate it even more and
I will raise it with the heel.

124
00:05:51,490 --> 00:05:55,740
Don't forget to adjust the
position of the hips accordingly.

125
00:05:55,740 --> 00:05:58,360
Now we can twist a bit the chest,

126
00:05:58,360 --> 00:06:00,980
but don't forget that
the hips are leading.

127
00:06:00,980 --> 00:06:04,410
So the chest may not
twist as much as the hips

128
00:06:04,410 --> 00:06:05,641
for the time being.

129
00:06:05,641 --> 00:06:07,832
Once the punch is thrown,

130
00:06:07,832 --> 00:06:10,930
the chest will catch up with the hips.

131
00:06:10,930 --> 00:06:14,264
And as the weight is getting
on the front left foot,

132
00:06:14,264 --> 00:06:17,950
I'm slightly tilting it to the left

133
00:06:17,950 --> 00:06:20,010
and I'm slightly pushing it down.

134
00:06:20,010 --> 00:06:23,180
This will mimic the compression
of the foot on the ground.

135
00:06:23,180 --> 00:06:26,230
For this breakdown I decided to not go

136
00:06:26,230 --> 00:06:29,500
too into the orthodox boxing pose with

137
00:06:29,500 --> 00:06:32,244
the left fist very close to the chin.

138
00:06:32,244 --> 00:06:36,340
I've kept the left arm
slightly more opened.

139
00:06:36,340 --> 00:06:40,490
This way we have a nice circular
flow between the two arms.

140
00:06:40,490 --> 00:06:41,410
As I explained before,

141
00:06:41,410 --> 00:06:44,980
remember to move the arms with
the anatomical constraint,

142
00:06:44,980 --> 00:06:47,670
rotating the elbow on neuron one axis,

143
00:06:47,670 --> 00:06:49,550
and don't forget to pose the bag.

144
00:06:49,550 --> 00:06:51,540
That's not the most important thing,

145
00:06:51,540 --> 00:06:53,960
but it will help you read your animation.

146
00:06:53,960 --> 00:06:56,490
To do so I reset all the
controller of the bag,

147
00:06:56,490 --> 00:06:58,922
and then I slightly rotated it backward

148
00:06:58,922 --> 00:07:01,220
just after the little jab

149
00:07:01,220 --> 00:07:05,253
as if the jab has pushed it a
bit and the bag is swinging.
