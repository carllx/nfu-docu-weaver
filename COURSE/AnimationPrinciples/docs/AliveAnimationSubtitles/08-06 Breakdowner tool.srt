00:00:00,090 --> 00:00:02,130
- [Instructor] Before we
start detailing our blocking,

2
00:00:02,130 --> 00:00:04,780
I'd like to introduce a new tool

3
00:00:04,780 --> 00:00:08,010
that will help us
accelerating the process.

4
00:00:08,010 --> 00:00:09,720
It's the Breakdowner tool.

5
00:00:09,720 --> 00:00:10,553
To show it to you,

6
00:00:10,553 --> 00:00:12,330
I've created this simple action

7
00:00:12,330 --> 00:00:13,890
with the bouncing ball rig,

8
00:00:13,890 --> 00:00:16,400
with the main controller only animated

9
00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:18,400
on the Z location access.

10
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:20,940
The Breakdowner tool is accessible

11
00:00:20,940 --> 00:00:22,970
in the tool panel on the left

12
00:00:22,970 --> 00:00:24,870
whenever you are in Pose Mode.

13
00:00:24,870 --> 00:00:28,320
You can also access the Breakdowner option

14
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:30,300
going into the editor,

15
00:00:30,300 --> 00:00:32,100
Pose, In-Betweens,

16
00:00:32,100 --> 00:00:34,130
and the different Breakdowner option

17
00:00:34,130 --> 00:00:35,730
will be available here.

18
00:00:35,730 --> 00:00:37,240
If I now go on frame two,

19
00:00:37,240 --> 00:00:39,810
where the ball stopped to raised the air

20
00:00:39,810 --> 00:00:43,350
and I will select the
Breakdowner tool on the left.

21
00:00:43,350 --> 00:00:47,360
If I now left click and
drag in the 3D view port,

22
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:50,530
You will see the ball going up and down,

23
00:00:50,530 --> 00:00:54,040
whether going toward the
pose on frame number five

24
00:00:54,040 --> 00:00:56,020
or the pose on frame zero.

25
00:00:56,020 --> 00:00:58,290
And as I'm doing it, you can see that

26
00:00:58,290 --> 00:01:00,850
we have a percentage of breakdown

27
00:01:00,850 --> 00:01:03,760
shown in the top left corner.

28
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:06,950
Currently 40%, this percentage correspond

29
00:01:06,950 --> 00:01:09,620
to whether we are favorizing frame zero

30
00:01:09,620 --> 00:01:10,840
or frame five.

31
00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:12,710
If I create a breakdown this way,

32
00:01:12,710 --> 00:01:13,543
we have a value of zero,

33
00:01:13,543 --> 00:01:16,710
it will be exactly in the
same pose as pose zero.

34
00:01:16,710 --> 00:01:18,420
With a value of 100%,

35
00:01:18,420 --> 00:01:21,040
exactly the same pose as frame five.

36
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:25,070
If I use a value of 50% for the breakdown,

37
00:01:25,070 --> 00:01:28,550
the pose that will be created
using the breakdown now

38
00:01:28,550 --> 00:01:30,870
will be exactly in the middle

39
00:01:30,870 --> 00:01:33,130
between the pose on frame five

40
00:01:33,130 --> 00:01:34,660
and the pose on frame zero.

41
00:01:34,660 --> 00:01:36,480
As most Blender tool,

42
00:01:36,480 --> 00:01:38,900
we can isolate the channel we want

43
00:01:38,900 --> 00:01:41,100
whenever we are using the Breakdowner.

44
00:01:41,100 --> 00:01:45,430
Here I input a rotation pose on frame five

45
00:01:45,430 --> 00:01:49,020
so the ball is interpolating both

46
00:01:49,020 --> 00:01:51,430
its location and its rotation

47
00:01:51,430 --> 00:01:53,720
from frame zero to frame five.

48
00:01:53,720 --> 00:01:55,950
I now go to the Breakdowner menu,

49
00:01:55,950 --> 00:01:57,250
choose the Breakdowner.

50
00:01:57,250 --> 00:02:01,030
Or, you can use the shortcut
shift+E to activate it.

51
00:02:01,030 --> 00:02:04,970
If I then press R, it will only work

52
00:02:04,970 --> 00:02:06,530
with the rotation of the ball.

53
00:02:06,530 --> 00:02:09,120
If I press shift+E and then G,

54
00:02:09,120 --> 00:02:11,640
it will only work with
the location of the ball.

55
00:02:11,640 --> 00:02:14,310
And you can absolutely combine those

56
00:02:14,310 --> 00:02:17,220
with the X, Y, and Z key.

57
00:02:17,220 --> 00:02:19,450
If I go on frame two, press shift+E

58
00:02:19,450 --> 00:02:21,000
to activate the Breakdowner,

59
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,890
then G, then X,

60
00:02:22,890 --> 00:02:26,150
the ball will only slide along the X axis.

61
00:02:26,150 --> 00:02:28,350
It behaves exactly the same way

62
00:02:28,350 --> 00:02:30,000
as any transform tool.

63
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,900
Two other tools are available to us.

64
00:02:32,900 --> 00:02:36,610
The Relax tool, that we
can access with alt+E,

65
00:02:36,610 --> 00:02:40,350
and the Push tool that we
can access with ctrl+E.

66
00:02:40,350 --> 00:02:43,440
If my player is on the frame with a key,

67
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:47,090
and then I press alt+E to
Relax the current pose,

68
00:02:47,090 --> 00:02:50,660
the resulting pose will
be closer to pose zero

69
00:02:50,660 --> 00:02:52,840
as I get to 100%.

70
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:55,400
If instead, I press ctrl+E,

71
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:57,310
it will Push the current pose.

72
00:02:57,310 --> 00:03:00,520
So basically, it will
check the interpolation

73
00:03:00,520 --> 00:03:01,950
between frame zero and five.

74
00:03:01,950 --> 00:03:05,263
The ball is raising, and
it will Push it higher.

75
00:03:06,450 --> 00:03:10,590
The Relax pose tools that
you can call using alt+E

76
00:03:10,590 --> 00:03:13,466
will create an intermediate key pose,

77
00:03:13,466 --> 00:03:16,060
or breakdown of arranging the pose,

78
00:03:16,060 --> 00:03:19,900
between the previous key
frame and the next key frame.

79
00:03:19,900 --> 00:03:23,650
So using alt+E and Push it over 100%

80
00:03:23,650 --> 00:03:26,810
is exactly the same that using shift+E

81
00:03:26,810 --> 00:03:28,380
the classic Breakdowner,

82
00:03:28,380 --> 00:03:30,560
and set it to 50%.

83
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:32,460
So this tool is very useful

84
00:03:32,460 --> 00:03:34,670
when you start to detailing your blocking.

85
00:03:34,670 --> 00:03:37,030
For example, here I have two poses

86
00:03:37,030 --> 00:03:38,660
that are pretty extreme,

87
00:03:38,660 --> 00:03:40,750
meaning that there is a big contrast

88
00:03:40,750 --> 00:03:42,050
between those two poses.

89
00:03:42,050 --> 00:03:44,520
With the torso root controller selected,

90
00:03:44,520 --> 00:03:47,410
I can press shift+E, and Blender will

91
00:03:47,410 --> 00:03:50,530
start interpolating
between those two keys.

92
00:03:50,530 --> 00:03:52,940
From there, I can choose
to lower this controller

93
00:03:52,940 --> 00:03:55,460
to create a better arc instead of

94
00:03:55,460 --> 00:03:57,050
having a straight line.

95
00:03:57,050 --> 00:03:59,600
And then, I can choose
to use the Breakdowner

96
00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:01,080
on the chest controller,

97
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:03,940
and whether keep a low percentage

98
00:04:03,940 --> 00:04:06,860
so that I'm favorizing the previous pose,

99
00:04:06,860 --> 00:04:09,920
or I can go beyond 50%

100
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:12,640
if I want to rotate more the chest

101
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:15,070
as if it was leading the animation.

102
00:04:15,070 --> 00:04:16,790
So it's a very cool tool to

103
00:04:16,790 --> 00:04:18,900
quickly block your breakdowns.

104
00:04:18,900 --> 00:04:21,580
But I do advise you to use it

105
00:04:21,580 --> 00:04:25,070
very cautiously and as less as possible.

106
00:04:25,070 --> 00:04:29,000
I generally use it only for
the root of my character,

107
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,430
and sometime to position the feet.

108
00:04:31,430 --> 00:04:34,530
It's a fantastic tool to
keep track of your arcs,

109
00:04:34,530 --> 00:04:38,120
but certainly not a good
tool to pose your character.

110
00:04:38,120 --> 00:04:40,188
To summarize, we have seen that

111
00:04:40,188 --> 00:04:43,020
the breakdowners allow us to create

112
00:04:43,020 --> 00:04:46,000
a key between the two poses

113
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:49,350
by choosing the level
of interpolation we want

114
00:04:49,350 --> 00:04:51,100
between those two keys.

115
00:04:51,100 --> 00:04:52,920
As any transform channels,

116
00:04:52,920 --> 00:04:55,620
we can enter the value we want

117
00:04:55,620 --> 00:04:58,730
the interpolation to be processed with.

118
00:04:58,730 --> 00:05:02,990
We can isolate the
location, rotation, or scale

119
00:05:02,990 --> 00:05:05,010
of the transformed channels,

120
00:05:05,010 --> 00:05:06,610
and we can choose the axis

121
00:05:06,610 --> 00:05:08,790
we want to use the tool on.

122
00:05:08,790 --> 00:05:11,770
There is also a Push
tool and the Relax tool,

123
00:05:11,770 --> 00:05:13,900
but I don't think they are very useful

124
00:05:13,900 --> 00:05:16,080
since we can achieve the same result

125
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:18,910
with the Relax tool using the Breakdowner.

126
00:05:18,910 --> 00:05:21,890
And I don't advise you to Push your poses

127
00:05:21,890 --> 00:05:23,930
using a tool like that.

128
00:05:23,930 --> 00:05:27,860
I would do this by hand to
get a more accurate result.

129
00:05:27,860 --> 00:05:30,350
The Breakdowner is a super cool tool

130
00:05:30,350 --> 00:05:32,150
to keep track of your arcs,

131
00:05:32,150 --> 00:05:35,330
and get a base for your
pose and break downs,

132
00:05:35,330 --> 00:05:37,670
but I would never use it

133
00:05:37,670 --> 00:05:40,503
to create the final pose
of one of my character.
