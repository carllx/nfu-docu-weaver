1
00:00:00,390 --> 00:00:04,280
- Animation curves is one
of the beginners' nightmare.

2
00:00:04,280 --> 00:00:07,200
But I want them to
become your best friends.

3
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:10,420
To display the animation
curve of our ball,

4
00:00:10,420 --> 00:00:12,880
let's go into the graph editor.

5
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:16,050
Right now, our curve looks a bit boxy,

6
00:00:16,050 --> 00:00:18,410
not really curved, and this is because

7
00:00:18,410 --> 00:00:21,140
we are still in constant interpolation.

8
00:00:21,140 --> 00:00:23,800
But it will help us reading them.

9
00:00:23,800 --> 00:00:26,825
The curve are just a
graphical representation

10
00:00:26,825 --> 00:00:29,670
of the value over time.

11
00:00:29,670 --> 00:00:32,670
The yellow controller point accurately

12
00:00:32,670 --> 00:00:36,190
the different key frame
we have inserted before.

13
00:00:36,190 --> 00:00:39,070
If I select the yellow
point on the blue curve

14
00:00:39,070 --> 00:00:42,240
at frame 7, it has a value of 4.

15
00:00:42,240 --> 00:00:45,347
such as the Z location of our ball.

16
00:00:45,347 --> 00:00:49,000
And if I now display all
the object transform channel

17
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:50,170
in the graph editor,

18
00:00:50,170 --> 00:00:53,110
we can see that the Z
location is highlighted.

19
00:00:53,110 --> 00:00:57,590
So the control point I've
selected in the graph editor

20
00:00:57,590 --> 00:01:01,300
is the key frame value of
the Z location of our ball.

21
00:01:01,300 --> 00:01:04,030
If I double click on
one of these channels,

22
00:01:04,030 --> 00:01:08,140
it will select all the control
point of the current curve.

23
00:01:08,140 --> 00:01:10,470
You can hide and unhide curve

24
00:01:10,470 --> 00:01:13,500
as you would do with any
object in the 3D view.

25
00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:16,550
If I press Shift + H,
I will hide everything

26
00:01:16,550 --> 00:01:17,880
but the selected curve.

27
00:01:17,880 --> 00:01:20,240
Or you can click on the little eye icon

28
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:22,830
to choose whether you want
to see or not the curve.

29
00:01:22,830 --> 00:01:24,820
With G, I can move the curve.

30
00:01:24,820 --> 00:01:29,550
I can press G+Y to constrained
the movement on the Y axis

31
00:01:29,550 --> 00:01:32,740
or G+X to constrained on the X axis.

32
00:01:32,740 --> 00:01:35,200
Before we start reading those curve,

33
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:38,250
let's get rid of any of
the curve we don't need.

34
00:01:38,250 --> 00:01:39,940
Since our ball is not rotating,

35
00:01:39,940 --> 00:01:43,150
we can get rid of all
the Euler rotation curve

36
00:01:43,150 --> 00:01:44,250
by pressing X.

37
00:01:44,250 --> 00:01:48,040
And we can also get rid
of the X and Y locations

38
00:01:48,040 --> 00:01:50,920
since our ball is just moving up and down.

39
00:01:50,920 --> 00:01:54,660
This is a good practice to get
rid of any unwanted channel

40
00:01:54,660 --> 00:01:57,370
to keep your graph editor clean.

41
00:01:57,370 --> 00:02:00,840
We can find the Z corresponding value

42
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:03,460
onto the control point of the curve,

43
00:02:03,460 --> 00:02:06,950
but also in the transform
channel of the object.

44
00:02:06,950 --> 00:02:10,580
Pressing the N key will
open the F-curve panel.

45
00:02:10,580 --> 00:02:14,490
This is a little (inexact) here
to check the position value

46
00:02:14,490 --> 00:02:17,820
and interpolation mode
of the key frame channel.

47
00:02:17,820 --> 00:02:21,180
Let's now select all
the key frames, press T,

48
00:02:21,180 --> 00:02:23,730
and switch to Bayesian interpolation.

49
00:02:23,730 --> 00:02:25,460
If we now play the animation,

50
00:02:25,460 --> 00:02:28,120
we get way smoother motion of the ball.

51
00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:31,190
When you switch from step
mode to Bayesian mode

52
00:02:31,190 --> 00:02:34,960
or curve mode, we call
this the splining stage.

53
00:02:34,960 --> 00:02:37,170
If we have a quick look to our curve now,

54
00:02:37,170 --> 00:02:39,640
we can see that the Z location curve

55
00:02:39,640 --> 00:02:43,310
is getting higher value when
the ball is getting higher.

56
00:02:43,310 --> 00:02:47,520
I will unhide the scale channel
by clicking the eye icon.

57
00:02:47,520 --> 00:02:50,740
I will select the first
controller point of those curve

58
00:02:50,740 --> 00:02:55,150
and press the dot key on
the Num pad to zoom on it.

59
00:02:55,150 --> 00:02:58,510
You can easily identify
the Z scale channel,

60
00:02:58,510 --> 00:03:01,490
which is in blue, allow
us to control the height

61
00:03:01,490 --> 00:03:02,530
of the ball.

62
00:03:02,530 --> 00:03:05,780
And the X and Y that are
one on top of the other

63
00:03:05,780 --> 00:03:08,670
that allow us to control
the width of the ball.

64
00:03:08,670 --> 00:03:11,670
Let's check a couple of
example to betterly understand

65
00:03:11,670 --> 00:03:13,310
the behavior of the curves.

66
00:03:13,310 --> 00:03:14,640
In this example,

67
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:18,210
the curve is controlling
the rotation of the arrow

68
00:03:18,210 --> 00:03:22,170
from a value of -90 degree to +90 degree.

69
00:03:22,170 --> 00:03:24,630
The curve is rising rapidly

70
00:03:24,630 --> 00:03:27,809
before easing into the frame number 24.

71
00:03:27,809 --> 00:03:30,280
And when we scrub through the animation,

72
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:33,240
we can see that we have big
spacing in the beginning

73
00:03:33,240 --> 00:03:37,040
of the animation, and it
gets lower in the end.

74
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:40,220
You seeing the motion
we will have a preview

75
00:03:40,220 --> 00:03:42,770
on the spacing of this animation.

76
00:03:42,770 --> 00:03:46,610
And now, we can obviously
see the difference of spacing

77
00:03:46,610 --> 00:03:47,860
during the animation.

78
00:03:47,860 --> 00:03:52,190
And the more vertical the curve
is, the larger the spacing.

79
00:03:52,190 --> 00:03:56,280
The more horizontal it gets,
the smaller the spacing is.

80
00:03:56,280 --> 00:03:59,110
In other word, the more
vertical the curve,

81
00:03:59,110 --> 00:04:00,930
the faster the animation.

82
00:04:00,930 --> 00:04:03,320
The more horizontal, the slower.

83
00:04:03,320 --> 00:04:07,260
In the next example, let's
consider the X location curve

84
00:04:07,260 --> 00:04:09,720
of the ball being the time.

85
00:04:09,720 --> 00:04:12,820
It goes forward in a linear fashion

86
00:04:12,820 --> 00:04:16,520
Now, if I activate the Z location curve,

87
00:04:16,520 --> 00:04:21,468
and I frame it properly, look
at all the Z location curve

88
00:04:21,468 --> 00:04:25,970
and the motion path we on
in the 3D view port align

89
00:04:25,970 --> 00:04:27,750
or are comparable.

90
00:04:27,750 --> 00:04:30,371
Again, when the curve is vertical,

91
00:04:30,371 --> 00:04:32,620
the sphere will rise rapidly.

92
00:04:32,620 --> 00:04:36,370
And as the curve gets more horizontal,

93
00:04:36,370 --> 00:04:38,520
the sphere rise slower.

94
00:04:38,520 --> 00:04:41,610
So if I now give an S shape to my curve,

95
00:04:41,610 --> 00:04:44,810
the ball will move
slowly in the beginning,

96
00:04:44,810 --> 00:04:46,810
then in the middle of the animation,

97
00:04:46,810 --> 00:04:50,470
it will accelerate as the
curve get more vertical,

98
00:04:50,470 --> 00:04:53,020
and in the end, it will slow down.

99
00:04:53,020 --> 00:04:57,160
We are creating an easing
out from the frame zero

100
00:04:57,160 --> 00:05:01,000
into an easing in the frame 24.

101
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:04,090
And since we still have the linear motion

102
00:05:04,090 --> 00:05:06,660
of the sphere on its X axis,

103
00:05:06,660 --> 00:05:10,240
we can see that the Z
curve really looks like

104
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:12,290
the motion path of the sphere.

105
00:05:12,290 --> 00:05:15,680
Since my sphere is
moving on the X location

106
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:19,407
in a linear fashion, any
modification I will add

107
00:05:19,407 --> 00:05:22,610
to the Z curve will show in the 3D view

108
00:05:22,610 --> 00:05:26,373
as in the graph editor by
updating the motion path.

109
00:05:27,610 --> 00:05:31,430
You can use the few example
available in the file

110
00:05:31,430 --> 00:05:34,850
to play with the curve and
recalculate the motion path

111
00:05:34,850 --> 00:05:37,093
and check out the spacing.

112
00:05:38,200 --> 00:05:40,410
Back to the rotation example,

113
00:05:40,410 --> 00:05:42,300
I've modeled the curve so that

114
00:05:42,300 --> 00:05:45,250
I have a fast acceleration
in the beginning,

115
00:05:45,250 --> 00:05:49,490
then a plateau, and then
an ease out and ease in.

116
00:05:49,490 --> 00:05:53,390
And it absolutely reflect
on the motion path.

117
00:05:53,390 --> 00:05:56,070
The pretty vertical shape of the curve

118
00:05:56,070 --> 00:05:59,800
on the first two frame
generate a big spacing.

119
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:02,670
The plateau shape or
flat shape of the curve

120
00:06:02,670 --> 00:06:06,120
indicate that the value
is not changing over time,

121
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:07,760
so the arrow will stop,

122
00:06:07,760 --> 00:06:10,680
while the final S shape of the curve

123
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:13,740
show an acceleration then a deceleration

124
00:06:13,740 --> 00:06:15,120
into the final frame.

125
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:18,340
To summarize, we have
seen that a curve is just

126
00:06:18,340 --> 00:06:22,240
a representation of the
evolution of a value over time.

127
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:24,640
The more vertical the curve shape,

128
00:06:24,640 --> 00:06:27,010
the faster the value change.

129
00:06:27,010 --> 00:06:30,050
And it translates in bigger spacing.

130
00:06:30,050 --> 00:06:33,960
The more horizontal the
curve, the slower the change.

131
00:06:33,960 --> 00:06:37,970
Motion wise, it translate
in smaller spacing.

132
00:06:37,970 --> 00:06:40,400
A flat curve indicates that there is

133
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:43,410
absolutely no change in the value

134
00:06:43,410 --> 00:06:45,153
and so no motion.
