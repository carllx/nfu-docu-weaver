1
00:00:00,820 --> 00:00:02,850
- [Instructor] Before we
learn all the technique

2
00:00:02,850 --> 00:00:06,880
to create the different shots
from the first course teaser,

3
00:00:06,880 --> 00:00:09,300
I would like to talk a bit about how

4
00:00:09,300 --> 00:00:12,110
to plan this kind of production.

5
00:00:12,110 --> 00:00:13,680
Gives you a couple of tricks

6
00:00:13,680 --> 00:00:16,330
that are important regarding staging.

7
00:00:16,330 --> 00:00:18,200
You generally start this kind

8
00:00:18,200 --> 00:00:22,000
of production with a
script, a story to tell.

9
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,210
The script will include
the story and description

10
00:00:25,210 --> 00:00:29,820
of the character and what
happens or you tell this story.

11
00:00:29,820 --> 00:00:32,660
And while a part of the team will work

12
00:00:32,660 --> 00:00:37,410
on the concept art to define
the art style of the film,

13
00:00:37,410 --> 00:00:39,120
you as an animator

14
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:43,190
will generally be provided
with a storyboard.

15
00:00:43,190 --> 00:00:45,590
I'll teach you how create a storyboard

16
00:00:45,590 --> 00:00:48,370
because this isn't something I usually do.

17
00:00:48,370 --> 00:00:52,320
But depending on the scale of
the studio you're working in

18
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:55,910
whether you're working
alone or in the big team

19
00:00:55,910 --> 00:00:58,057
you will find the storyboard artists

20
00:00:58,057 --> 00:00:59,680
or you'll be in charge

21
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:02,160
of doing the storyboard yourself.

22
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:06,610
The storyboard shows how the
picture has to be framed.

23
00:01:06,610 --> 00:01:10,750
The key moment or beats of the animation,

24
00:01:10,750 --> 00:01:14,310
and information about
the character movement

25
00:01:14,310 --> 00:01:16,190
and the camera movement.

26
00:01:16,190 --> 00:01:19,430
Just imagine it as being a comic,

27
00:01:19,430 --> 00:01:22,770
all the different picture of the same size

28
00:01:22,770 --> 00:01:25,620
that chooses the size of the camera

29
00:01:25,620 --> 00:01:27,920
and that explain what will happen

30
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:30,610
in your movie or in your shot.

31
00:01:30,610 --> 00:01:33,380
By reading the script
and seeing the storyboard

32
00:01:33,380 --> 00:01:37,870
anyone should be able to
figure what's going to happen

33
00:01:37,870 --> 00:01:40,640
and what the movie will look like.

34
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:42,590
The storyboard is validated.

35
00:01:42,590 --> 00:01:45,680
You can switch to creating an animatic

36
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:48,450
it's a shot with music and sound.

37
00:01:48,450 --> 00:01:52,410
That will include the
drawing from the storyboard

38
00:01:52,410 --> 00:01:54,630
but with the right timing

39
00:01:54,630 --> 00:01:55,890
though you can consider

40
00:01:55,890 --> 00:01:58,890
this as being an animated storyboard.

41
00:01:58,890 --> 00:02:01,760
Depending on your
projection level and style

42
00:02:01,760 --> 00:02:05,260
there might be other steps
like pre visualization

43
00:02:05,260 --> 00:02:08,550
but with those element you
are generally good to go

44
00:02:08,550 --> 00:02:11,540
into animating your shots.

45
00:02:11,540 --> 00:02:13,960
A good shot or a good animation

46
00:02:13,960 --> 00:02:16,120
depends on the staging.

47
00:02:16,120 --> 00:02:20,220
Staging is one of the 12
principles of animation.

48
00:02:20,220 --> 00:02:24,110
Staging is the presentation
of any idea in your shot.

49
00:02:24,110 --> 00:02:26,790
It includes a lot of different concept

50
00:02:26,790 --> 00:02:28,246
but to keep it simple,

51
00:02:28,246 --> 00:02:33,246
think of it as making the
action clear and understandable.

52
00:02:33,740 --> 00:02:36,800
So it includes everything
about your animation

53
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:39,430
whether it's the character movement,

54
00:02:39,430 --> 00:02:42,290
what he's saying if it's
a character speaking

55
00:02:42,290 --> 00:02:46,330
but also the way you move the
camera, you frame everything.

56
00:02:46,330 --> 00:02:49,770
If we take the example of our shot,

57
00:02:49,770 --> 00:02:53,240
we can immediately understand
that we are in the forest.

58
00:02:53,240 --> 00:02:56,050
To guide the viewer that
something will happen

59
00:02:56,050 --> 00:02:56,940
in this specific bush,

60
00:02:56,940 --> 00:03:00,500
I've made it shaking a bit.

61
00:03:00,500 --> 00:03:03,370
We have also animated our character

62
00:03:03,370 --> 00:03:05,730
turning his head in here,

63
00:03:05,730 --> 00:03:09,970
and then there is this
anticipation before it goes away.

64
00:03:09,970 --> 00:03:12,300
The other example is this trailer

65
00:03:12,300 --> 00:03:16,250
for the game Nora I've made in 2018.

66
00:03:16,250 --> 00:03:19,570
The first thing we want to
say is that we are underwater

67
00:03:19,570 --> 00:03:21,900
and we wanna make it a bit mystical

68
00:03:21,900 --> 00:03:25,040
with those luminous and seaweed.

69
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:26,610
As we go through the surface,

70
00:03:26,610 --> 00:03:28,200
we can see those quality of drops

71
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:29,480
on the camera lens

72
00:03:29,480 --> 00:03:32,570
selling that we were into the water.

73
00:03:32,570 --> 00:03:35,963
While we could have used
the crab for appeal only

74
00:03:35,963 --> 00:03:40,280
this character is used
for scaling purpose.

75
00:03:40,280 --> 00:03:44,620
This way we can understand
that he's on a pretty big rock

76
00:03:44,620 --> 00:03:48,340
and what will appear
beyond it is even bigger.

77
00:03:48,340 --> 00:03:51,660
Staging is also about composition.

78
00:03:51,660 --> 00:03:56,290
Every shapes tend to drive the
eye toward the center sphere

79
00:03:56,290 --> 00:03:57,410
and on top of this,

80
00:03:57,410 --> 00:03:59,860
this is also the element

81
00:03:59,860 --> 00:04:04,330
with the brightest color
and the strongest contrast.

82
00:04:04,330 --> 00:04:07,140
So basically when you are building a shot

83
00:04:07,140 --> 00:04:09,890
ask yourself all those questions.

84
00:04:09,890 --> 00:04:12,330
Does the composition read well?

85
00:04:12,330 --> 00:04:16,800
Do the audience know where
the animation takes place

86
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:20,000
and if it matters?, Do we understand

87
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,880
the character motion and feeling?

88
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:26,570
And do we understand
what is going to happen?

89
00:04:26,570 --> 00:04:28,750
One last example here,

90
00:04:28,750 --> 00:04:33,260
this character have a
very slow breathing motion

91
00:04:33,260 --> 00:04:36,070
and very slow motion in general,

92
00:04:36,070 --> 00:04:39,400
that tells that he is very big.

93
00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:43,350
Also the composition with
this pyramid double shape

94
00:04:43,350 --> 00:04:46,640
shows that he's an important character.

95
00:04:46,640 --> 00:04:48,680
He's currently the King,

96
00:04:48,680 --> 00:04:52,730
and we can see that the light
is also supporting this.

97
00:04:52,730 --> 00:04:55,980
Now look at the anticipation
on the next move.

98
00:04:55,980 --> 00:04:59,310
His whole body is moving
to raise his fist,

99
00:04:59,310 --> 00:05:03,040
again supporting the fact
that the character is very big

100
00:05:03,040 --> 00:05:05,340
and probably very strong.

101
00:05:05,340 --> 00:05:08,670
And it also give a visual anticipation

102
00:05:08,670 --> 00:05:12,080
on the transition toward the next shot.

103
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:16,730
The fingers are shaking
communicating anger and strength

104
00:05:16,730 --> 00:05:20,510
and the shuttering rocks
just to confirm this.

105
00:05:20,510 --> 00:05:24,000
It's now over loop two
hours quilt or shot.

106
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,900
I want to give you some
tips and some pitfall

107
00:05:26,900 --> 00:05:28,400
you should avoid.

108
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:32,640
First try to keep your camera
move as realistic as possible

109
00:05:32,640 --> 00:05:36,260
as if it was a physical
camera in the real world

110
00:05:36,260 --> 00:05:39,530
and we will talk about
camera in the next video.

111
00:05:39,530 --> 00:05:41,830
The second thing about camera motion

112
00:05:41,830 --> 00:05:44,540
is to avoid anticipation.

113
00:05:44,540 --> 00:05:48,930
Here the bush moved first,
and then I rotate the camera.

114
00:05:48,930 --> 00:05:50,100
So you have to think

115
00:05:50,100 --> 00:05:53,720
that the camera is catching
up with the action.

116
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:56,350
It's not predicting the action.

117
00:05:56,350 --> 00:06:00,460
So when our character is
jumping out of the bush

118
00:06:00,460 --> 00:06:04,100
it's like the offset is
not centered in the shot

119
00:06:04,100 --> 00:06:05,670
and then the camera catch up

120
00:06:05,670 --> 00:06:08,890
and center it as being the focus point.

121
00:06:08,890 --> 00:06:11,870
Another very important thing
regarding the readability

122
00:06:11,870 --> 00:06:14,910
of your animation is to make sure

123
00:06:14,910 --> 00:06:18,560
that when you switch from
one shot to the other

124
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:22,960
there is a continuity in the
motion of your character.

125
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:24,500
If we have a look to the transition

126
00:06:24,500 --> 00:06:27,550
between the first and second shot,

127
00:06:27,550 --> 00:06:31,440
the character is
disappearing behind the bush,

128
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:33,720
he's into a lending motion.

129
00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:37,110
So we can think that
during this transition

130
00:06:37,110 --> 00:06:39,830
where he's hidden behind the bush

131
00:06:39,830 --> 00:06:43,390
he's bouncing or jumping another time,

132
00:06:43,390 --> 00:06:46,430
and when he finally reappear to the camera

133
00:06:46,430 --> 00:06:49,480
is currently how ball
making the transition

134
00:06:49,480 --> 00:06:51,650
between the two shots seamless.

135
00:06:51,650 --> 00:06:55,850
On the next one I used a
fading between the two shots.

136
00:06:55,850 --> 00:06:58,340
We generally use these
to tell the audience

137
00:06:58,340 --> 00:07:01,960
that we are changing off environments

138
00:07:01,960 --> 00:07:04,530
where the animation takes place

139
00:07:04,530 --> 00:07:07,720
or that sometime has elapsed.

140
00:07:07,720 --> 00:07:10,520
And this is what I wanted
to communicate here.

141
00:07:10,520 --> 00:07:13,320
And you can see that there
is a slight difference

142
00:07:13,320 --> 00:07:18,320
of lightning between the
previews and current composition

143
00:07:18,610 --> 00:07:21,970
as if we were getting closer to a sunset.

144
00:07:21,970 --> 00:07:25,920
The color are slightly more orangy.

145
00:07:25,920 --> 00:07:28,330
Another thing about this shot

146
00:07:28,330 --> 00:07:33,330
is that I make the birds
appearing once our character

147
00:07:33,570 --> 00:07:35,390
has got through the shot.

148
00:07:35,390 --> 00:07:37,340
As he's in the background

149
00:07:37,340 --> 00:07:40,230
if the bird were appearing first,

150
00:07:40,230 --> 00:07:42,910
that will create a lot of visual noise

151
00:07:42,910 --> 00:07:45,823
and we would lose the
focus on our character.

152
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:48,540
But they've added those birds on purpose.

153
00:07:48,540 --> 00:07:51,680
Once our character is disappearing,

154
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:54,310
it tells me to bring some appeal

155
00:07:54,310 --> 00:07:57,920
and keep this shot for a little while.

156
00:07:57,920 --> 00:08:01,320
So is that when I
transition to the last shot

157
00:08:01,320 --> 00:08:03,707
we have the feeling that the character

158
00:08:03,707 --> 00:08:08,707
had the time to climb the tree
and go on the current branch.

159
00:08:09,780 --> 00:08:13,000
Finally here, both the composition

160
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,470
and the direction the birds are flying

161
00:08:15,470 --> 00:08:19,260
focus our attention toward the sun

162
00:08:19,260 --> 00:08:21,920
and the logo cross this line.

163
00:08:21,920 --> 00:08:25,630
So while this course will
focus on the animation

164
00:08:25,630 --> 00:08:27,470
of our character,

165
00:08:27,470 --> 00:08:30,900
the anticipation in the
way our character move

166
00:08:30,900 --> 00:08:33,380
also serve the staging.

167
00:08:33,380 --> 00:08:37,390
And if your goal is to
create your own shots films

168
00:08:37,390 --> 00:08:40,840
for example, staging is very important.

169
00:08:40,840 --> 00:08:42,650
It's like any form of art.

170
00:08:42,650 --> 00:08:47,060
It's about composition,
rhythm, mood, sound

171
00:08:47,060 --> 00:08:50,110
why I put something here and not there.

172
00:08:50,110 --> 00:08:53,520
Staging is here to support the idea

173
00:08:53,520 --> 00:08:56,073
to make it as clear as possible.

174
00:08:57,270 --> 00:08:58,225
To summarize, we have seen that staging

175
00:08:58,225 --> 00:09:03,225
is about clarity of your shot.

176
00:09:03,320 --> 00:09:07,170
Your character behavior
is part of the staging

177
00:09:07,170 --> 00:09:10,020
whether it's through anticipation,

178
00:09:10,020 --> 00:09:14,570
his mood or whatever he has to communicate

179
00:09:14,570 --> 00:09:17,050
the idea behind the shot.

180
00:09:17,050 --> 00:09:20,120
Composition, camera movement, and lighting

181
00:09:20,120 --> 00:09:23,320
are very important to make things clear

182
00:09:23,320 --> 00:09:27,553
both your thought to guide
the eyes of your audience.

183
00:09:28,590 --> 00:09:30,880
Unless it's done on purpose,

184
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:35,100
try to think of your camera
shot as if it was enrolled

185
00:09:35,100 --> 00:09:40,100
by a real human being or
using real world constraints.

186
00:09:40,530 --> 00:09:43,380
If you are working on multiple shot

187
00:09:43,380 --> 00:09:46,490
make sure that your
transition makes sense.

188
00:09:46,490 --> 00:09:50,260
Blend the motion from
one shot to the other

189
00:09:50,260 --> 00:09:54,140
or use transition whenever
you are switching space

190
00:09:54,140 --> 00:09:56,020
or switching time.

191
00:09:56,020 --> 00:09:58,640
Don't forget it's a creative process

192
00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:01,770
so don't be afraid to experiment.

193
00:10:01,770 --> 00:10:04,380
And when you are working on big project

194
00:10:04,380 --> 00:10:06,800
don't forget to write a script,

195
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:11,500
create a storyboard or
even create an animatic.

196
00:10:11,500 --> 00:10:14,350
In the next video, we
will talk about the camera

197
00:10:14,350 --> 00:10:17,053
so that you can create your first shot.
