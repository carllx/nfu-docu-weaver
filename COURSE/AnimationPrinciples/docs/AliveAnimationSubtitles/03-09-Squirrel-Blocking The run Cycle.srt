00:00:00,710 --> 00:00:02,370
- [Instructor] The time has finally come

2
00:00:02,370 --> 00:00:05,330
to animate our squirrel character.

3
00:00:05,330 --> 00:00:06,570
The first thing to do

4
00:00:06,570 --> 00:00:11,000
is to play the Squirrel_Rig_UI.pi script.

5
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:12,940
It will enable our rig layer

6
00:00:12,940 --> 00:00:16,210
and we will be able to
hide bone groups easily.

7
00:00:16,210 --> 00:00:18,890
You can duplicate our keying set action

8
00:00:18,890 --> 00:00:20,500
and create a new action

9
00:00:20,500 --> 00:00:23,040
that we call 01 Run cycle.

10
00:00:23,040 --> 00:00:25,420
And then double check our preferences

11
00:00:25,420 --> 00:00:29,360
by going into the Edit
menu in the top bar,

12
00:00:29,360 --> 00:00:31,800
Preferences, Animation

13
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:35,110
and check that the Only
Insert Available is on.

14
00:00:35,110 --> 00:00:38,630
It will override our usual
automatic keying set,

15
00:00:38,630 --> 00:00:41,230
making sure that we don't have any key

16
00:00:41,230 --> 00:00:42,470
that will be written

17
00:00:42,470 --> 00:00:45,140
if there is not an existing keyframe.

18
00:00:45,140 --> 00:00:48,040
If I move this knee
joint tweaker controller,

19
00:00:48,040 --> 00:00:50,440
you can see that the auto keying is on

20
00:00:50,440 --> 00:00:55,160
but Blender is only recording
and writing location keyframe

21
00:00:55,160 --> 00:00:56,500
for this controller.

22
00:00:56,500 --> 00:01:00,300
This way, our action editor
is clean in the keying

23
00:01:00,300 --> 00:01:01,670
but on top of this,

24
00:01:01,670 --> 00:01:04,600
we can still use a specific keying set.

25
00:01:04,600 --> 00:01:08,640
And I will enable the
whole character keying set.

26
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:10,940
This way, when I press the I key

27
00:01:10,940 --> 00:01:12,560
to insert a keyframe,

28
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:15,140
Blender will key all the controllers

29
00:01:15,140 --> 00:01:17,410
of my character and this is done

30
00:01:17,410 --> 00:01:20,710
on top of the only
available option we have set

31
00:01:20,710 --> 00:01:21,910
in the preferences.

32
00:01:21,910 --> 00:01:24,430
When we were blocking the
bouncing ball animation,

33
00:01:24,430 --> 00:01:27,750
I advised you to key all the controllers.

34
00:01:27,750 --> 00:01:29,670
And here is the reason why.

35
00:01:29,670 --> 00:01:32,320
I will rapidly block out a turn

36
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:35,110
with a change of foot position.

37
00:01:35,110 --> 00:01:37,650
Our little friend is rotating his body

38
00:01:37,650 --> 00:01:38,810
to look to the right

39
00:01:38,810 --> 00:01:41,670
and he's also moving his feet accordingly.

40
00:01:41,670 --> 00:01:43,530
During most of the animation,

41
00:01:43,530 --> 00:01:46,400
his right front foot stays on the ground

42
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:49,900
and it switches position
only on the very last frame.

43
00:01:49,900 --> 00:01:53,060
Here I've done the blocking
of those three poses,

44
00:01:53,060 --> 00:01:55,880
only keying the controller I'm using.

45
00:01:55,880 --> 00:01:57,740
It looks great in step mode

46
00:01:57,740 --> 00:02:00,530
but as soon as I will switch to spline,

47
00:02:00,530 --> 00:02:01,950
the right front foot

48
00:02:01,950 --> 00:02:04,740
will be interpolating
from the very first frame

49
00:02:04,740 --> 00:02:05,620
to the last.

50
00:02:05,620 --> 00:02:07,260
And it doesn't look good at all.

51
00:02:07,260 --> 00:02:09,660
And I will have to move the keyframe,

52
00:02:09,660 --> 00:02:11,430
insert new keyframe, et cetera.

53
00:02:11,430 --> 00:02:14,440
While if I insert a keyframe
on the whole character

54
00:02:14,440 --> 00:02:16,220
on each main poses,

55
00:02:16,220 --> 00:02:18,330
I will get a better behavior

56
00:02:18,330 --> 00:02:21,340
and the right front foot will only move

57
00:02:21,340 --> 00:02:23,580
from frame 20 to frame 30.

58
00:02:23,580 --> 00:02:25,580
So you may think this is not a big deal

59
00:02:25,580 --> 00:02:29,340
but believe me, if you
have this kind of problem

60
00:02:29,340 --> 00:02:32,320
on the whole character on every leg,

61
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:34,280
this is going to be a pain.

62
00:02:34,280 --> 00:02:36,100
And if you have the same issue

63
00:02:36,100 --> 00:02:38,420
with all the controller,
the head, the hips,

64
00:02:38,420 --> 00:02:40,070
that's gonna be a nightmare.

65
00:02:40,070 --> 00:02:44,180
So key all your controllers
during the blocking stage.

66
00:02:44,180 --> 00:02:46,970
The second step is to study references.

67
00:02:46,970 --> 00:02:49,140
You will find a link to this one

68
00:02:49,140 --> 00:02:50,590
in the documentation.

69
00:02:50,590 --> 00:02:54,180
It's very important to watch
as much reference as possible

70
00:02:54,180 --> 00:02:57,140
and honestly, nowadays,
it's not that complicated

71
00:02:57,140 --> 00:03:00,160
with YouTube to find good
references of animals.

72
00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:03,120
I guess you already know
what I'm going to show here

73
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:05,340
is that the body of the squirrel

74
00:03:05,340 --> 00:03:06,890
is like the bouncing ball.

75
00:03:06,890 --> 00:03:08,900
Squashed when it's on the ground

76
00:03:08,900 --> 00:03:11,600
and as soon as it's going in the air,

77
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:12,840
it is stretching.

78
00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:15,070
Basically, the chest of the creature

79
00:03:15,070 --> 00:03:16,500
is arriving first

80
00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:18,910
and then the hips are catching up.

81
00:03:18,910 --> 00:03:20,830
So when preparing an animation,

82
00:03:20,830 --> 00:03:23,380
you have to make this work
of seeing the character

83
00:03:23,380 --> 00:03:24,920
as a whole piece.

84
00:03:24,920 --> 00:03:25,940
Look at the curve

85
00:03:25,940 --> 00:03:28,150
that make the body, for example.

86
00:03:28,150 --> 00:03:29,650
Once you have the broad detail,

87
00:03:29,650 --> 00:03:32,150
you have to go for the smaller detail.

88
00:03:32,150 --> 00:03:36,320
Look how the front feet
arrive at the separated time.

89
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:39,730
It's just one or two frame of difference

90
00:03:39,730 --> 00:03:42,560
but it will make your animation way better

91
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:45,900
than if both end arrive at the same time.

92
00:03:45,900 --> 00:03:49,100
In animation, when we
get something symmetrical

93
00:03:49,100 --> 00:03:51,510
or something occurring at the same time,

94
00:03:51,510 --> 00:03:53,180
we call this twinning.

95
00:03:53,180 --> 00:03:55,577
And this is something
you should always avoid

96
00:03:55,577 --> 00:03:57,940
unless it is done on purpose.

97
00:03:57,940 --> 00:04:00,210
If you do the Hulk smashing the ground

98
00:04:00,210 --> 00:04:01,840
with both his hands,

99
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:04,910
you want both to hit the
ground at the same time.

100
00:04:04,910 --> 00:04:07,750
It will communicate impact and strength.

101
00:04:07,750 --> 00:04:09,840
But in the case of our squirrel,

102
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:13,730
look at how breaking the
symmetry looks way more natural.

103
00:04:13,730 --> 00:04:16,120
On the left, the character looks stiff,

104
00:04:16,120 --> 00:04:18,460
on the right, it looks way better.

105
00:04:18,460 --> 00:04:20,949
So don't forget to avoid twinning

106
00:04:20,949 --> 00:04:23,360
both in timing and in shape

107
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:25,130
and let's get started.

108
00:04:25,130 --> 00:04:28,080
I don't know how many
frame I will need to block

109
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:30,220
or how long will be the jump

110
00:04:30,220 --> 00:04:32,580
but I will start by aligning the feet

111
00:04:32,580 --> 00:04:33,750
with the ground.

112
00:04:33,750 --> 00:04:35,060
One cool feature

113
00:04:35,060 --> 00:04:37,230
is that once I've positioned one

114
00:04:37,230 --> 00:04:38,810
of the foot, I can select it

115
00:04:38,810 --> 00:04:39,950
and press Control + C

116
00:04:39,950 --> 00:04:43,740
to copy its pose and you
will get a copied pose

117
00:04:43,740 --> 00:04:47,270
to buffer message in
the footer of Blender.

118
00:04:47,270 --> 00:04:49,310
If I now press Control + Shift + V,

119
00:04:49,310 --> 00:04:52,205
I will paste the mirrored
pose automatically

120
00:04:52,205 --> 00:04:53,770
on the other foot.

121
00:04:53,770 --> 00:04:56,260
This is a shortcut I'm going to use a lot.

122
00:04:56,260 --> 00:05:00,370
From there, I will start
posing the pushing pose

123
00:05:00,370 --> 00:05:03,660
when our character is preparing to jump.

124
00:05:03,660 --> 00:05:07,460
So I have my reference
image on a second screen.

125
00:05:07,460 --> 00:05:10,320
So I invite you to have it always open

126
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:12,020
and try to find the frame

127
00:05:12,020 --> 00:05:14,780
where the squirrel is preparing to jump.

128
00:05:14,780 --> 00:05:17,310
His body should be very squashed

129
00:05:17,310 --> 00:05:20,710
and the root of the
torso almost horizontal

130
00:05:20,710 --> 00:05:21,600
with the ground.

131
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:23,190
Starting with the back legs,

132
00:05:23,190 --> 00:05:25,320
I'm slightly rotating the foot

133
00:05:25,320 --> 00:05:27,900
toward the outside of the body.

134
00:05:27,900 --> 00:05:30,820
This way, I'm breaking the symmetry both

135
00:05:30,820 --> 00:05:33,150
from the side view and the front view.

136
00:05:33,150 --> 00:05:35,285
Then I will move its front feet right

137
00:05:35,285 --> 00:05:38,110
in between the back feet.

138
00:05:38,110 --> 00:05:40,480
I'm also breaking the symmetry,

139
00:05:40,480 --> 00:05:43,980
having one of the front
leg slightly more forward

140
00:05:43,980 --> 00:05:47,500
than the other, one slightly
more raised than the other.

141
00:05:47,500 --> 00:05:50,000
Then we need to squash the whole body

142
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,118
by rotating the chest controller

143
00:05:52,118 --> 00:05:54,170
and the hips controller.

144
00:05:54,170 --> 00:05:58,970
You can also slightly move them
toward the center of gravity

145
00:05:58,970 --> 00:06:00,210
of the character.

146
00:06:00,210 --> 00:06:03,560
Just think of your character as a box

147
00:06:03,560 --> 00:06:07,120
and this box has to
contain the heaviest part

148
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:10,010
of the character, the chest and the hips.

149
00:06:10,010 --> 00:06:12,888
The head and the tail
counterbalance each other

150
00:06:12,888 --> 00:06:17,330
and if we draw a straight
line in the middle

151
00:06:17,330 --> 00:06:18,870
of this pose, we can see

152
00:06:18,870 --> 00:06:23,460
that our feet are more or less
framing this contact point

153
00:06:23,460 --> 00:06:26,150
between the vertical line and the ground,

154
00:06:26,150 --> 00:06:29,600
offering a balanced pose to our character.

155
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:31,360
When blocking a character,

156
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:32,830
you should always start

157
00:06:32,830 --> 00:06:34,973
with the most extreme position.

158
00:06:34,973 --> 00:06:39,160
So I will now block the airborne position.

159
00:06:39,160 --> 00:06:41,830
I start by moving the root controller

160
00:06:41,830 --> 00:06:44,570
by half of the length of the jump.

161
00:06:44,570 --> 00:06:48,960
In this case, I move it
by 30 centimeter forward

162
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:52,410
and then I will use the torso controller

163
00:06:52,410 --> 00:06:54,090
to raise the character.

164
00:06:54,090 --> 00:06:58,510
In most cases, you will use
the root controller only

165
00:06:58,510 --> 00:07:02,470
to move your character
on the y and x-axis.

166
00:07:02,470 --> 00:07:05,160
When I do a run or walk cycle,

167
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:06,940
I generally deal with it

168
00:07:06,940 --> 00:07:09,180
without moving the root bone

169
00:07:09,180 --> 00:07:11,950
as if the character was on a treadmill.

170
00:07:11,950 --> 00:07:16,029
But it's a bit harder to
read the shape of the jump.

171
00:07:16,029 --> 00:07:18,600
So during the blocking stage,

172
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:21,530
we will use what we call a root motion.

173
00:07:21,530 --> 00:07:23,890
And when the animation will be finished,

174
00:07:23,890 --> 00:07:26,126
we will get rid of this root motion

175
00:07:26,126 --> 00:07:28,280
so that our character

176
00:07:28,280 --> 00:07:30,900
will be jumping without moving forward.

177
00:07:30,900 --> 00:07:33,730
This way it's gonna be
way easier to use it

178
00:07:33,730 --> 00:07:35,610
as a run cycle

179
00:07:35,610 --> 00:07:38,220
and we will just have
to move the root bone

180
00:07:38,220 --> 00:07:40,630
wherever we want in our scene.

181
00:07:40,630 --> 00:07:42,611
Don't worry if you don't get it right now,

182
00:07:42,611 --> 00:07:45,250
we will do it together later on.

183
00:07:45,250 --> 00:07:46,560
Back to our air pose.

184
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:50,040
You can see that I've
slightly stretched the body.

185
00:07:50,040 --> 00:07:52,890
So I've canceled the rotation on the hips

186
00:07:52,890 --> 00:07:56,880
and the chest and then I'm
resetting them by hand.

187
00:07:56,880 --> 00:07:59,120
So this is something I advise you to do

188
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:02,860
when you don't have a
major change in the pose.

189
00:08:02,860 --> 00:08:06,320
You select the hips and
the chest controller

190
00:08:06,320 --> 00:08:09,510
and press Alt + R and Alt + G

191
00:08:09,510 --> 00:08:11,440
to get rid of any rotation

192
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:14,493
that was recorded on the previous pose.

193
00:08:14,493 --> 00:08:17,230
And then you create the new pose yourself.

194
00:08:17,230 --> 00:08:20,430
Blocking a new pose from a neutral one

195
00:08:20,430 --> 00:08:24,980
will push you to correctly
look at your reference

196
00:08:24,980 --> 00:08:28,350
and force you to work on
the shape of the new one.

197
00:08:28,350 --> 00:08:32,750
The back legs are pointing
toward their starting point

198
00:08:32,750 --> 00:08:35,540
while the front leg are pushing forward

199
00:08:35,540 --> 00:08:37,980
to pull the whole body in the air.

200
00:08:37,980 --> 00:08:42,510
Both the front and back feet
are currently pointing inward.

201
00:08:42,510 --> 00:08:44,140
It preserve balance

202
00:08:44,140 --> 00:08:47,020
and aerodynamism to the character.

203
00:08:47,020 --> 00:08:48,930
You can use the pull target

204
00:08:48,930 --> 00:08:50,389
and the rotation controller

205
00:08:50,389 --> 00:08:54,930
to fix the elbow and the
knees of your character.

206
00:08:54,930 --> 00:08:57,490
Don't forget to scrub between your first

207
00:08:57,490 --> 00:08:58,540
and second pose

208
00:08:58,540 --> 00:09:01,990
to kind of feel the motion, the movement.

209
00:09:01,990 --> 00:09:04,360
Then to improve the pose,

210
00:09:04,360 --> 00:09:07,520
I will stretch my character even more

211
00:09:07,520 --> 00:09:10,520
and realign a bit the hips and the tail.

212
00:09:10,520 --> 00:09:12,001
During the blocking stage,

213
00:09:12,001 --> 00:09:15,800
figuring the overlapping
motion of the tail

214
00:09:15,800 --> 00:09:17,340
is pretty hard.

215
00:09:17,340 --> 00:09:21,270
That's why I'm just working
with the very first controller

216
00:09:21,270 --> 00:09:22,280
of the tail.

217
00:09:22,280 --> 00:09:24,930
We can work on the
follow-through of the tail

218
00:09:24,930 --> 00:09:26,730
while detailing the blocking

219
00:09:26,730 --> 00:09:30,480
or even during the
polishing of the animation.

220
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:33,380
To finish the blocking
of those extreme pose,

221
00:09:33,380 --> 00:09:36,130
I will have to guess the landing position.

222
00:09:36,130 --> 00:09:37,890
On the air extreme pose,

223
00:09:37,890 --> 00:09:41,510
I will set the root bone position to -0.3

224
00:09:41,510 --> 00:09:43,600
and I will duplicate all the keys

225
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:46,550
on frame zero and move them on frame 10.

226
00:09:46,550 --> 00:09:50,330
Since the airborne root
position on the y-axis

227
00:09:50,330 --> 00:09:55,330
was -0.3, I will set the landing at -0.6,

228
00:09:55,660 --> 00:09:57,040
two time further.

229
00:09:57,040 --> 00:09:58,930
Now I scrub through the keyframe

230
00:09:58,930 --> 00:10:00,460
to feel the motion

231
00:10:00,460 --> 00:10:02,770
and I feel should be a little further.

232
00:10:02,770 --> 00:10:05,500
So I just need to select the root bone

233
00:10:05,500 --> 00:10:06,760
and on frame five,

234
00:10:06,760 --> 00:10:09,980
I will try a -0.4

235
00:10:09,980 --> 00:10:11,290
and now I feel like I need

236
00:10:11,290 --> 00:10:12,840
to tweak a bit this pose

237
00:10:12,840 --> 00:10:16,230
to make the character a
little more horizontal.

238
00:10:16,230 --> 00:10:18,230
So this is something important.

239
00:10:18,230 --> 00:10:21,610
Don't hesitate to revise your blocking.

240
00:10:21,610 --> 00:10:24,591
The blocking stage is
the most important stage.

241
00:10:24,591 --> 00:10:26,970
And if you don't do it properly,

242
00:10:26,970 --> 00:10:29,430
if you don't spend the time now,

243
00:10:29,430 --> 00:10:32,950
you will suffer even more
during the polishing stage.

244
00:10:32,950 --> 00:10:34,920
I can now push my root bone

245
00:10:34,920 --> 00:10:38,960
to the position -0.8 on the landing frame

246
00:10:38,960 --> 00:10:41,100
and now it feels like the squirrel

247
00:10:41,100 --> 00:10:43,130
is jumping too far away for me.

248
00:10:43,130 --> 00:10:48,130
So I will try to find an in
between with -0.35 and -0.7.

249
00:10:49,980 --> 00:10:51,300
Compared to the reference,

250
00:10:51,300 --> 00:10:55,330
our squirrel is making pretty
large jump to move forward

251
00:10:55,330 --> 00:10:57,650
but animation is not necessarily

252
00:10:57,650 --> 00:10:59,880
about copying the reality.

253
00:10:59,880 --> 00:11:01,520
It's exaggeration.

254
00:11:01,520 --> 00:11:04,260
And this will lead us to a peel.

255
00:11:04,260 --> 00:11:08,080
It's a but like making
a caricature of motion.

256
00:11:08,080 --> 00:11:09,264
When you do a caricature,

257
00:11:09,264 --> 00:11:12,320
you try to find the cool feature

258
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:14,880
of the face and exaggerate them.

259
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:17,630
We are doing the same here with motion.

260
00:11:17,630 --> 00:11:18,780
In the next video,

261
00:11:18,780 --> 00:11:20,930
we will start adding breakdowns

262
00:11:20,930 --> 00:11:24,767
to detail the blocking
animation of our character.
