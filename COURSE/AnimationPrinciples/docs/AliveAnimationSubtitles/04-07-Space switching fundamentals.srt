1
00:00:00,790 --> 00:00:03,654
In this video, we are
going to use the constraint

2
00:00:03,654 --> 00:00:05,328
We've just seen before

3
00:00:05,328 --> 00:00:10,328
to animate to different
parts of the robot character

4
00:00:10,570 --> 00:00:13,920
using the base motion
we have created before.

5
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:18,290
To do so we will use a method
called space switching.

6
00:00:18,290 --> 00:00:21,300
This is an often overlooked technique

7
00:00:21,300 --> 00:00:23,750
but it is so powerful.

8
00:00:23,750 --> 00:00:27,340
I've been introduced to this
technique and learned a lot

9
00:00:27,340 --> 00:00:30,792
of things through the
Animation Sherpa course

10
00:00:30,792 --> 00:00:32,680
by Richard Lico.

11
00:00:32,680 --> 00:00:35,560
He's one of the coolest person I know.

12
00:00:35,560 --> 00:00:37,440
And beyond that, he's one

13
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:40,550
of the best animators
in the game industry.

14
00:00:40,550 --> 00:00:44,035
I will just show you the
very basic of space switching

15
00:00:44,035 --> 00:00:45,627
but if you enjoy it

16
00:00:45,627 --> 00:00:49,069
and get comfortable with
this animation course,

17
00:00:49,069 --> 00:00:53,813
I truly advise you to take his
animation course afterward.

18
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:59,590
So let's start with a simple
up and down animation.

19
00:00:59,590 --> 00:01:04,590
What I'd like to do is
make bone B react to bone

20
00:01:04,600 --> 00:01:08,620
A having a bit of overlapping animation.

21
00:01:08,620 --> 00:01:11,260
And instead of doing it by hand

22
00:01:11,260 --> 00:01:15,179
as we did for the bouncing
ball or our scleral character

23
00:01:15,179 --> 00:01:17,345
we will use constraints.

24
00:01:17,345 --> 00:01:20,360
DID is to source the motion

25
00:01:20,360 --> 00:01:25,360
of bone B in the work space
and slightly offset it in time.

26
00:01:25,857 --> 00:01:26,940
Don't worry.

27
00:01:26,940 --> 00:01:29,210
This will make sense in a few seconds.

28
00:01:29,210 --> 00:01:31,503
Let's select a bone B press shift S

29
00:01:31,503 --> 00:01:33,653
and snap the cursor to it.

30
00:01:33,653 --> 00:01:37,810
Let's switch to object mode and add an MT.

31
00:01:37,810 --> 00:01:42,320
We wanted the MT to behave
exactly as bone B to

32
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:46,090
do so I will select the MT,
go to the constraint panel

33
00:01:46,090 --> 00:01:48,806
add a copy location panel

34
00:01:48,806 --> 00:01:51,000
and source the armature.

35
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,410
Then I will select the bone B.

36
00:01:53,410 --> 00:01:57,421
Now our MT is following
the bone B in space.

37
00:01:57,421 --> 00:02:01,600
It is coping it's location in ward space

38
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:04,647
and I can no longer move
it, but we don't have

39
00:02:04,647 --> 00:02:07,861
any animation information
we can play with,

40
00:02:07,861 --> 00:02:10,290
the graph editor is empty.

41
00:02:10,290 --> 00:02:14,797
So what we need to do is to
comfort the current motion

42
00:02:14,797 --> 00:02:16,536
of the MT that is due

43
00:02:16,536 --> 00:02:20,222
to the constraint in an actual animation.

44
00:02:20,222 --> 00:02:23,860
And we can do this through baking.

45
00:02:23,860 --> 00:02:26,870
To do so let's just have our MT selected

46
00:02:26,870 --> 00:02:29,330
press F3 and search for bake.

47
00:02:29,330 --> 00:02:33,500
We will choose the first one
object animation, bake action.

48
00:02:33,500 --> 00:02:36,020
The bake action panel will open.

49
00:02:36,020 --> 00:02:38,900
Here we can set the length of the action

50
00:02:38,900 --> 00:02:42,200
we want to bake from
frame zero to frame 25.

51
00:02:42,200 --> 00:02:44,570
I always used visual keying,

52
00:02:44,570 --> 00:02:48,080
so that I'm sure that all
constraints are applied

53
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:49,750
when writing the action,

54
00:02:49,750 --> 00:02:51,970
and we want to get rid of the constraints.

55
00:02:51,970 --> 00:02:54,230
So I will enable clear constraints.

56
00:02:54,230 --> 00:02:57,510
I won't choose override current action

57
00:02:57,510 --> 00:03:00,080
since our MT don't have any action yet.

58
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:03,680
As I press okay Blender will
get free of the constraint

59
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:08,575
and I do now have an action
input into my graph editor.

60
00:03:08,575 --> 00:03:11,180
If I played the animation, I can see

61
00:03:11,180 --> 00:03:14,105
that the MT is kind of following bone B

62
00:03:14,105 --> 00:03:17,127
but it's no longer constrained to it.

63
00:03:17,127 --> 00:03:22,020
It's animation is just similar as bone B.

64
00:03:22,020 --> 00:03:24,830
I will clean up the channel I don't need,

65
00:03:24,830 --> 00:03:26,313
and keep this delocation on.

66
00:03:27,610 --> 00:03:29,000
Now we have data.

67
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,060
We can edit.

68
00:03:30,060 --> 00:03:33,120
We can offset the key frame or edit them.

69
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:36,640
And since those animation
data are assigned

70
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:40,089
to a single object, they
are using world space.

71
00:03:40,089 --> 00:03:42,750
While bone B has no motion

72
00:03:42,750 --> 00:03:46,490
in its local space, it is not animated.

73
00:03:46,490 --> 00:03:48,890
It's just following bone A,

74
00:03:48,890 --> 00:03:52,120
our MT does have an animation

75
00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:57,049
but it is visually doing exactly
the same thing as bone B.

76
00:03:57,049 --> 00:04:00,040
Now to see the power of space switching

77
00:04:00,040 --> 00:04:01,545
let's select our MT.

78
00:04:01,545 --> 00:04:06,545
In the curve, press shift
E add a cyclic modifier.

79
00:04:07,230 --> 00:04:09,230
You find now select all the keys

80
00:04:09,230 --> 00:04:12,498
press G and X and offset
them a bit in time.

81
00:04:12,498 --> 00:04:17,117
You can see that now the
MT seems to have a formal

82
00:04:17,117 --> 00:04:19,585
through animation compared to bone A.

83
00:04:19,585 --> 00:04:23,070
So if I now select my armature

84
00:04:23,070 --> 00:04:26,170
going to pose modes like bone B.

85
00:04:26,170 --> 00:04:28,278
We can access the bone constraint.

86
00:04:28,278 --> 00:04:29,848
So be very careful.

87
00:04:29,848 --> 00:04:34,848
We are not constraining the
armature object, but the bone.

88
00:04:35,010 --> 00:04:38,050
So we need to go into the bone constraint

89
00:04:38,050 --> 00:04:40,167
not the object constraint.

90
00:04:40,167 --> 00:04:41,290
From there,

91
00:04:41,290 --> 00:04:43,857
we can add a copy location constraint

92
00:04:43,857 --> 00:04:46,453
and then source the MT.

93
00:04:46,453 --> 00:04:49,696
Now bone B will follow the motion

94
00:04:49,696 --> 00:04:52,970
or the location of the MT.

95
00:04:52,970 --> 00:04:56,464
From there, we can press
F3 and search for bake

96
00:04:56,464 --> 00:05:01,400
or in my case, I've added
the bake action functionality

97
00:05:01,400 --> 00:05:03,370
to my quick favorite so I can press

98
00:05:03,370 --> 00:05:05,553
the Q key to access it.

99
00:05:05,553 --> 00:05:07,540
I will use the same option

100
00:05:07,540 --> 00:05:09,550
visual keying and clear constraint

101
00:05:09,550 --> 00:05:12,650
and I will add overwrite current action.

102
00:05:12,650 --> 00:05:15,310
Now bone B is no longer a constraint

103
00:05:15,310 --> 00:05:19,010
but it's following the
same motion as the MT.

104
00:05:19,010 --> 00:05:23,189
We can now get rid of MT and
shape the curves of bone B.

105
00:05:23,189 --> 00:05:25,711
All channels have been written

106
00:05:25,711 --> 00:05:30,711
but only the Z axis channel
is interesting for us.

107
00:05:30,730 --> 00:05:35,383
You have just performed your
first space switching exercise.

108
00:05:36,920 --> 00:05:40,210
Let's now see what we can
do with copy rotation.

109
00:05:40,210 --> 00:05:43,660
In the example file, you
will find a second collection

110
00:05:43,660 --> 00:05:46,450
with the copier rotation example.

111
00:05:46,450 --> 00:05:49,392
It's a simple chain of three bones.

112
00:05:49,392 --> 00:05:52,400
With bone A being animated.

113
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:57,400
It's a simple backend for
rotation on its X axis.

114
00:05:57,480 --> 00:06:00,643
Bone B and C are simple
children without any animation.

115
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:03,760
Let's go back into object mode

116
00:06:03,760 --> 00:06:05,890
and add two MTs.

117
00:06:05,890 --> 00:06:07,900
For the sake of presentation,

118
00:06:07,900 --> 00:06:12,900
I will add on the first MT a
copy, transform from bone B.

119
00:06:13,850 --> 00:06:16,700
Go to the constraint,
add the copy transform.

120
00:06:16,700 --> 00:06:19,830
Source the second armature and bone B.

121
00:06:19,830 --> 00:06:24,830
Now our MT is snapped onto
bone B for the second MT.

122
00:06:25,640 --> 00:06:29,360
I will add a simple copy
rotation and so it's

123
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:31,740
the same armature and bone C.

124
00:06:31,740 --> 00:06:33,960
The first MT is now coping

125
00:06:33,960 --> 00:06:37,728
both the location and
the rotation of bone B.

126
00:06:37,728 --> 00:06:41,120
But in the end, what is interesting for us

127
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:42,900
is only the rotation.

128
00:06:42,900 --> 00:06:47,009
If I was to isolate the
motion of the first MTs

129
00:06:47,009 --> 00:06:49,379
that is also copying the location,

130
00:06:49,379 --> 00:06:53,840
he will be rotating as
the one above, but it

131
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:57,810
can be a bit confusing to see
only the rotation of the MT

132
00:06:57,810 --> 00:07:00,480
whenever the bones are currently childs

133
00:07:00,480 --> 00:07:04,450
of another one and their
location is also changing.

134
00:07:04,450 --> 00:07:08,550
But in this case, we will
only affect their rotation.

135
00:07:08,550 --> 00:07:11,800
So I will switch to a
simple copier rotation

136
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:13,343
and so it's bone B.

137
00:07:13,343 --> 00:07:17,946
And I will select both
MT, press my Q shortcut

138
00:07:17,946 --> 00:07:20,090
and bake the action.

139
00:07:20,090 --> 00:07:23,698
Now both the MTs have
lost their constraint

140
00:07:23,698 --> 00:07:26,290
but we have animation that.

141
00:07:26,290 --> 00:07:30,270
So we can now use those
two MTs to constraint

142
00:07:30,270 --> 00:07:31,470
bone B and bone C.

143
00:07:31,470 --> 00:07:33,160
But first let's make sure

144
00:07:33,160 --> 00:07:35,770
that we have all the curves selected

145
00:07:35,770 --> 00:07:39,865
for both MTs, press
shift E and make cycle.

146
00:07:39,865 --> 00:07:42,563
Now let's select the armature

147
00:07:42,563 --> 00:07:45,070
go into pose mode, select bone B,

148
00:07:45,070 --> 00:07:49,020
go to the constraint panel,
add a copy rotation constraint

149
00:07:49,020 --> 00:07:50,950
and source the first MT.

150
00:07:50,950 --> 00:07:52,290
Big mistake here.

151
00:07:52,290 --> 00:07:55,116
We've added the constraint
on to the object

152
00:07:55,116 --> 00:07:58,870
as explained before we need
to use bone constraints.

153
00:07:58,870 --> 00:08:01,350
So let's add the copy rotation source

154
00:08:01,350 --> 00:08:05,046
the first MT select bone
C add the new constraint

155
00:08:05,046 --> 00:08:08,630
and solves the second then from there,

156
00:08:08,630 --> 00:08:10,000
when we played the animation

157
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:14,010
nothing changed since those
two bones copying the rotation

158
00:08:14,010 --> 00:08:17,600
of something that was coping
their rotation previously.

159
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:20,220
But if I now offset to curve

160
00:08:20,220 --> 00:08:23,379
of the first empty by one or two frames,

161
00:08:23,379 --> 00:08:27,630
you can see the chain of bones changing.

162
00:08:27,630 --> 00:08:31,390
And if I now also offset the second MT

163
00:08:31,390 --> 00:08:33,142
by three or four frame,

164
00:08:33,142 --> 00:08:37,691
I will get an overlapping
motion of my whole chain.

165
00:08:37,691 --> 00:08:41,532
So the idea is to offset
by one or two frame,

166
00:08:41,532 --> 00:08:43,350
the first MT,

167
00:08:43,350 --> 00:08:46,981
then the next one by one
or two additional frame.

168
00:08:46,981 --> 00:08:49,713
So three to four frames

169
00:08:49,713 --> 00:08:53,450
and we'd get our
overlapping motion for free.

170
00:08:53,450 --> 00:08:56,160
From there, we can select the armature

171
00:08:56,160 --> 00:09:00,406
go back into pause mode,
select both constraint bone,

172
00:09:00,406 --> 00:09:05,051
and bake the action and choose
overwrite current action.

173
00:09:05,051 --> 00:09:07,720
And we can get rid of MTs.

174
00:09:07,720 --> 00:09:09,773
And then we have our animation done.

175
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:13,910
Let's see a first example.

176
00:09:13,910 --> 00:09:15,008
We've aimed space.

177
00:09:15,008 --> 00:09:19,691
I have the sweeping motion,
but I don't want B and C to get

178
00:09:19,691 --> 00:09:23,950
through this plane to create
the trucking constraint.

179
00:09:23,950 --> 00:09:26,923
We need first to add a couple of MTs.

180
00:09:28,110 --> 00:09:29,980
And then to those MTs

181
00:09:29,980 --> 00:09:34,523
we will add a copy transform
so that they follow each bone.

182
00:09:34,523 --> 00:09:37,120
So I will source bone B

183
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:41,135
for the first one and bone C
for the second one this way

184
00:09:41,135 --> 00:09:44,273
both MTs are perfectly aligned with each

185
00:09:44,273 --> 00:09:47,457
of their targets now to be able to get rid

186
00:09:47,457 --> 00:09:50,090
of the constraint, but
keep those transform.

187
00:09:50,090 --> 00:09:53,780
We can press control A and
choose visual transform.

188
00:09:53,780 --> 00:09:54,900
I will do this for

189
00:09:54,900 --> 00:09:57,770
both MT and get rid of their constraints.

190
00:09:57,770 --> 00:10:00,969
But the cool thing is that now
they are transformed channel

191
00:10:00,969 --> 00:10:03,423
as the same transformation

192
00:10:03,423 --> 00:10:06,475
as bone B and bone C, but in ward space.

193
00:10:06,475 --> 00:10:11,048
So if I go into my MTs
properties editor and switch

194
00:10:11,048 --> 00:10:14,459
to arrows as a way to display them,

195
00:10:14,459 --> 00:10:17,530
you will see that there are now aligned

196
00:10:17,530 --> 00:10:19,940
with bone B and bone C.

197
00:10:19,940 --> 00:10:23,050
They are sharing both the same orientation

198
00:10:23,050 --> 00:10:25,820
and position in ward space.

199
00:10:25,820 --> 00:10:27,580
We now need to offset them.

200
00:10:27,580 --> 00:10:30,660
So I will switch the pivot
point to local with both

201
00:10:30,660 --> 00:10:35,360
of them selected press G
and moved them on the Y axis

202
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:39,249
so that they are still
align with bone B and C,

203
00:10:39,249 --> 00:10:44,020
but they are further away
on their local Y axis.

204
00:10:44,020 --> 00:10:47,640
Now for them to follow
the motion of bone B and C

205
00:10:47,640 --> 00:10:50,731
I need to make them become
child of those boards.

206
00:10:50,731 --> 00:10:53,418
And we can use a new constraint such

207
00:10:53,418 --> 00:10:56,040
as the child of constraint.

208
00:10:56,040 --> 00:10:59,750
It's a very handy constraint
that will make the owner behave

209
00:10:59,750 --> 00:11:02,378
as if it was a child of the target,

210
00:11:02,378 --> 00:11:05,320
as a target let's source the armature.

211
00:11:05,320 --> 00:11:09,525
And then bone B, we can
see that the MT got offset

212
00:11:09,525 --> 00:11:14,061
just click set, inverse
to reset its position.

213
00:11:14,061 --> 00:11:16,150
And let's repeat the process

214
00:11:16,150 --> 00:11:18,449
with bone C and the second MT,

215
00:11:18,449 --> 00:11:20,250
solve the armature.

216
00:11:20,250 --> 00:11:23,687
Choose bone C and click set inverse.

217
00:11:23,687 --> 00:11:26,580
Now, if we play our animation,

218
00:11:26,580 --> 00:11:28,650
we can see both those MTs.

219
00:11:28,650 --> 00:11:32,496
Following both bones,
let's select both MTs

220
00:11:32,496 --> 00:11:36,960
and bake the action or bake the animation.

221
00:11:36,960 --> 00:11:40,070
As before, whenever we
are baking the action,

222
00:11:40,070 --> 00:11:42,600
we can choose to remove the constraint

223
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:45,984
and we can see our MTs
still following the motion

224
00:11:45,984 --> 00:11:49,635
but now they do have an emission data.

225
00:11:49,635 --> 00:11:53,030
We don't need any rotation or scale here

226
00:11:53,030 --> 00:11:57,804
so we can get treated of the
rotation and scale curve.

227
00:11:57,804 --> 00:11:59,630
You don't need to do it.

228
00:11:59,630 --> 00:12:03,500
It's just to keep the
graffiti top cleaner.

229
00:12:03,500 --> 00:12:07,120
Now, go back on the armature in post mode

230
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:09,279
go to the bone's constraint

231
00:12:09,279 --> 00:12:14,279
select dumped truck constraint
and source the first MT.

232
00:12:14,590 --> 00:12:17,266
Then repeat the process with bone C,

233
00:12:17,266 --> 00:12:22,130
add dump truck constraint
and source the second MT.

234
00:12:22,130 --> 00:12:24,470
When we played the animation as usual

235
00:12:24,470 --> 00:12:26,810
nothing special happened, but

236
00:12:26,810 --> 00:12:31,050
if I select the first MT press shift E to

237
00:12:31,050 --> 00:12:34,517
make all the curve cyclic
and then offset them

238
00:12:34,517 --> 00:12:39,498
by one or two frame, we can
see our bone chain offset.

239
00:12:39,498 --> 00:12:43,349
And if I repeat the
process with the second MT,

240
00:12:43,349 --> 00:12:46,082
but offset it by two frame.

241
00:12:46,082 --> 00:12:51,074
Now you can see the chain
animated with a bit of overlap.

242
00:12:51,074 --> 00:12:52,040
It seems

243
00:12:52,040 --> 00:12:55,380
that the make cycle function
didn't work on this curve.

244
00:12:55,380 --> 00:12:56,980
So I will fix this.

245
00:12:56,980 --> 00:13:01,980
Now, if I want my chain to avoid
getting through or clipping

246
00:13:02,410 --> 00:13:06,640
with the plane we have
created, I can simply work

247
00:13:06,640 --> 00:13:10,717
on the curves or the animation
of the different MTs.

248
00:13:10,717 --> 00:13:13,988
So I will select the first MT,

249
00:13:13,988 --> 00:13:17,941
and work on it's Z location curve.

250
00:13:17,941 --> 00:13:22,169
I will try to spot the key
where it goes under the ground

251
00:13:22,169 --> 00:13:24,170
and I will select the key

252
00:13:24,170 --> 00:13:28,000
and offset it a bit on the
Y axis in the graffiti.

253
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,602
It also is that it gets a little

254
00:13:29,602 --> 00:13:34,514
we then go further whenever
it's leaving the ground

255
00:13:34,514 --> 00:13:37,560
and I will duplicate the frame

256
00:13:37,560 --> 00:13:41,050
I've just adjust on top of this one.

257
00:13:41,050 --> 00:13:44,440
Those two keys represent our ground level

258
00:13:44,440 --> 00:13:45,600
and I can get rid

259
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:48,898
of any keys that goes under these labels.

260
00:13:48,898 --> 00:13:51,230
I can now repeat the process

261
00:13:51,230 --> 00:13:54,860
with the second MT isolate to see location

262
00:13:54,860 --> 00:13:58,699
curve spot, the moment
where it goes on the ground

263
00:13:58,699 --> 00:14:02,100
then align its position with the ground.

264
00:14:02,100 --> 00:14:05,594
Go even further duplicate the key frame

265
00:14:05,594 --> 00:14:10,446
and get rid of any keys
that are under this label.

266
00:14:10,446 --> 00:14:13,400
And when I played the animation now,

267
00:14:13,400 --> 00:14:18,400
it seems that this whipping
motion is stuck to the ground.

268
00:14:18,461 --> 00:14:21,012
Then as usual, we can go back

269
00:14:21,012 --> 00:14:25,034
onto our bone chain and bake the action.

270
00:14:25,034 --> 00:14:28,724
And if there are any
glitches in the animation,

271
00:14:28,724 --> 00:14:30,690
you can remove a couple

272
00:14:30,690 --> 00:14:33,370
of frames to get a smooth transition.

273
00:14:33,370 --> 00:14:37,280
Using aim space is a
super powerful workflow.

274
00:14:37,280 --> 00:14:39,740
Don't worry if you get
to be close to at first

275
00:14:39,740 --> 00:14:42,640
we will repeat this process a lot of time

276
00:14:42,640 --> 00:14:46,350
on the robot and you will
get very familiar with it.

277
00:14:46,350 --> 00:14:48,070
Now, in the last example,

278
00:14:48,070 --> 00:14:50,310
we will see all we can combine a

279
00:14:50,310 --> 00:14:52,020
both the copy location

280
00:14:52,020 --> 00:14:56,633
or location switch with this in space.

281
00:14:57,860 --> 00:15:00,150
To do so I've created another armature

282
00:15:00,150 --> 00:15:01,850
with another animation.

283
00:15:01,850 --> 00:15:04,453
It's a simple up and down motion,

284
00:15:04,453 --> 00:15:06,140
with have a little bounce,

285
00:15:06,140 --> 00:15:07,160
so it's pretty close

286
00:15:07,160 --> 00:15:09,150
to what we have between the body

287
00:15:09,150 --> 00:15:11,440
and the cannon of our robot.

288
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:13,990
We will start with the location offset

289
00:15:13,990 --> 00:15:15,720
with my bone B selected.

290
00:15:15,720 --> 00:15:18,930
I will press shift S to snap the cursor

291
00:15:18,930 --> 00:15:20,768
to it and add an MT.

292
00:15:20,768 --> 00:15:24,983
To this MT I will add a
copy location constraint

293
00:15:24,983 --> 00:15:29,020
sourcing the armature and the bone B.

294
00:15:29,020 --> 00:15:31,760
Now the MT is following the motion

295
00:15:31,760 --> 00:15:34,240
of the bone B in ward space.

296
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:36,160
I can press my Q key to get

297
00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:39,487
to my quick favorite and bake the action.

298
00:15:39,487 --> 00:15:41,770
I can get rid of all the curve,

299
00:15:41,770 --> 00:15:43,970
but the Z location curve.

300
00:15:43,970 --> 00:15:47,947
Press shift E and add a cyclic modifier.

301
00:15:47,947 --> 00:15:51,110
From there I can slightly
offset the curve in time

302
00:15:51,110 --> 00:15:54,962
by one or two frames to get
a nice overlap in motion.

303
00:15:54,962 --> 00:15:57,980
I will then select back my armature,

304
00:15:57,980 --> 00:15:59,290
go into pose mode

305
00:15:59,290 --> 00:16:01,330
go into the bone constraint,

306
00:16:01,330 --> 00:16:03,380
add a copy location,

307
00:16:03,380 --> 00:16:06,280
so it's the MT and now bone B,

308
00:16:06,280 --> 00:16:08,523
get this overlapping motion.

309
00:16:08,523 --> 00:16:11,700
I can press Q and bake the action.

310
00:16:11,700 --> 00:16:16,040
I won't delete the MT
because we will need it to

311
00:16:16,040 --> 00:16:19,241
currently create the aim space constraint.

312
00:16:19,241 --> 00:16:24,178
So the first thing to do is
to align the MT on the bone.

313
00:16:24,178 --> 00:16:27,650
So let's add a copy transform concentrate

314
00:16:27,650 --> 00:16:31,151
to the MT and source
as a target to bone B.

315
00:16:31,151 --> 00:16:35,573
Let's press control A and
apply the visual transform.

316
00:16:35,573 --> 00:16:39,080
We can get rid of the
copy, transform constraint.

317
00:16:39,080 --> 00:16:40,508
And if we want, we can go

318
00:16:40,508 --> 00:16:44,300
to the MT option and
switch to arrows to see

319
00:16:44,300 --> 00:16:47,686
that it is oriented the
same way as the bone.

320
00:16:47,686 --> 00:16:51,892
I will offset it along its local Y axis.

321
00:16:51,892 --> 00:16:54,130
And now we need to add a child

322
00:16:54,130 --> 00:16:57,170
of constraint to it, sourcing the bone B.

323
00:16:57,170 --> 00:17:00,182
Click set inverse to reset its position.

324
00:17:00,182 --> 00:17:03,330
And it's now following the motion

325
00:17:03,330 --> 00:17:06,298
of bone B as if it was a child of it.

326
00:17:06,298 --> 00:17:08,739
Let's bake this animation.

327
00:17:08,739 --> 00:17:11,240
We can cleave the curve if we want,

328
00:17:11,240 --> 00:17:12,744
getting rid of the curve

329
00:17:12,744 --> 00:17:15,577
that doesn't have any animation.

330
00:17:15,577 --> 00:17:19,859
Then press shift E and make
the current curve cycle.

331
00:17:19,859 --> 00:17:24,202
Then we can use E to
constraint the bone B,

332
00:17:24,202 --> 00:17:27,840
using a dump truck constraint.

333
00:17:27,840 --> 00:17:30,636
If we now select back the MT,

334
00:17:30,636 --> 00:17:33,311
an offset it's curved in time

335
00:17:33,311 --> 00:17:36,170
we will have a bit of follow through

336
00:17:36,170 --> 00:17:38,401
animation in the rotation.

337
00:17:38,401 --> 00:17:41,240
So we have offset the motion

338
00:17:41,240 --> 00:17:44,902
of the bone B using a location offset

339
00:17:44,902 --> 00:17:49,260
and now also using a
dump truck constraint.

340
00:17:49,260 --> 00:17:52,780
The cool thing about the
dump truck constraint is

341
00:17:52,780 --> 00:17:55,980
that it's very easy to smooth a curve.

342
00:17:55,980 --> 00:17:59,560
If, for example, I don't
want that much bounce

343
00:17:59,560 --> 00:18:00,778
onto my bone B

344
00:18:00,778 --> 00:18:05,632
and I want a smooth transition
as if it was very heavy.

345
00:18:05,632 --> 00:18:06,854
I can get rid

346
00:18:06,854 --> 00:18:10,639
of some key frames offset
to beat the lower key

347
00:18:10,639 --> 00:18:15,140
and it will still follow
the original motion

348
00:18:15,140 --> 00:18:17,800
of the bone B location wise.

349
00:18:17,800 --> 00:18:21,770
So the base of the bone is
still have pretty crispy

350
00:18:21,770 --> 00:18:24,890
and sharp bones while it's steep,

351
00:18:24,890 --> 00:18:26,010
that is pointing

352
00:18:26,010 --> 00:18:28,754
to what the target or the MT

353
00:18:28,754 --> 00:18:31,840
get a smooth sort of motion.

354
00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:35,960
The last thing we haven't seen
regarding any constraint is

355
00:18:35,960 --> 00:18:39,142
that we can reduce the
interference of the constraint.

356
00:18:39,142 --> 00:18:42,320
If I want to reduce the amplitude

357
00:18:42,320 --> 00:18:44,066
of the rotation of the bone B.

358
00:18:44,066 --> 00:18:46,600
It would have worked the same

359
00:18:46,600 --> 00:18:49,500
with any other influence,

360
00:18:49,500 --> 00:18:51,686
such as the location constraint

361
00:18:51,686 --> 00:18:56,686
the bounce would be the same
but with a lower amplitude.

362
00:18:57,060 --> 00:19:00,380
From there, we can bake
the current action on

363
00:19:00,380 --> 00:19:01,810
to the bone B.

364
00:19:01,810 --> 00:19:04,350
Don't worry if you're a bit lost at first

365
00:19:04,350 --> 00:19:08,169
just try to redo the
exercise you've just seen.

366
00:19:08,169 --> 00:19:11,830
We will repeat this a
lot through this chapter.

367
00:19:11,830 --> 00:19:15,326
So you will get familiar
with this technique very fast

368
00:19:15,326 --> 00:19:19,450
Learning those techniques
will become a huge time saver

369
00:19:19,450 --> 00:19:21,780
for you later in the course.

370
00:19:21,780 --> 00:19:22,613
To summarize,

371
00:19:22,613 --> 00:19:25,045
we have seen that we can use constraint

372
00:19:25,045 --> 00:19:30,045
and animation baking to source
data from a specific motion

373
00:19:30,191 --> 00:19:33,478
and transferred them on to another bone

374
00:19:33,478 --> 00:19:35,690
or another object.

375
00:19:35,690 --> 00:19:37,560
We can use copy location

376
00:19:37,560 --> 00:19:40,383
and copy rotation to create nice follow

377
00:19:40,383 --> 00:19:43,073
through animation with ease.

378
00:19:43,073 --> 00:19:45,380
We can have even more control

379
00:19:45,380 --> 00:19:49,550
upon rotation of the target
using tracking constraint

380
00:19:49,550 --> 00:19:52,223
such as dumped truck constraint.

381
00:19:52,223 --> 00:19:56,951
We can use multiple constraint
to create complex mechanism

382
00:19:56,951 --> 00:19:58,870
in a few clicks.

383
00:19:58,870 --> 00:20:01,377
And finally, we can use the influence

384
00:20:01,377 --> 00:20:04,740
of the different constraint to add more

385
00:20:04,740 --> 00:20:08,243
or less amplitude to the
motion we are creating.
