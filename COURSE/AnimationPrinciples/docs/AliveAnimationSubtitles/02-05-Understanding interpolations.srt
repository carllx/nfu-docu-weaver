1
00:00:00,290 --> 00:00:03,220
- Before we start animating
our bouncing ball,

2
00:00:03,220 --> 00:00:07,240
one of the most important
thing you have to understand

3
00:00:07,240 --> 00:00:10,710
is interpolation, timing and spacing.

4
00:00:10,710 --> 00:00:12,950
Timing and spacing are two

5
00:00:12,950 --> 00:00:16,240
of the 12 principles of animation.

6
00:00:16,240 --> 00:00:20,070
Interpolation is quite new
since it's the computer

7
00:00:20,070 --> 00:00:23,310
that is doing the interpolation
between two key frame

8
00:00:23,310 --> 00:00:26,810
while in the past, they
used to animate everything

9
00:00:26,810 --> 00:00:29,440
by and adding drawings and drawings.

10
00:00:29,440 --> 00:00:31,310
Timing is the pace.

11
00:00:31,310 --> 00:00:34,660
It's the moment when the
ball leave the ground,

12
00:00:34,660 --> 00:00:38,240
is up in the sky and
then hit back the ground.

13
00:00:38,240 --> 00:00:42,580
It is defined by the key
moment of the animation

14
00:00:42,580 --> 00:00:44,200
or in the extreme,

15
00:00:44,200 --> 00:00:48,080
the extreme high position
and the extreme low position

16
00:00:48,080 --> 00:00:49,110
in this case.

17
00:00:49,110 --> 00:00:53,860
We have a timing of 12 frame
to get to the highest position

18
00:00:53,860 --> 00:00:56,500
and 12 frame to get back on the ground.

19
00:00:56,500 --> 00:01:00,750
Spacing is the different
of position of our sphere

20
00:01:00,750 --> 00:01:03,100
from one frame to the other.

21
00:01:03,100 --> 00:01:06,070
We can easily display the spacing

22
00:01:06,070 --> 00:01:09,090
by going into the object
option, motion path,

23
00:01:09,090 --> 00:01:14,090
set the frame from zero
to 24 and click calculate.

24
00:01:14,110 --> 00:01:16,360
Then there we create a curve

25
00:01:16,360 --> 00:01:18,800
that go through different point

26
00:01:18,800 --> 00:01:23,270
that mark the position of
the origin of our sphere

27
00:01:23,270 --> 00:01:24,720
on each key frame.

28
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:28,980
The distance between those
points is our spacing

29
00:01:28,980 --> 00:01:33,980
and this spacing is based on
the timing of our animation

30
00:01:34,230 --> 00:01:37,840
and the interpolation
between two key frames.

31
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:42,490
By default, blender
interpolation is set to bezier.

32
00:01:42,490 --> 00:01:46,050
What it does is that it
creates an acceleration

33
00:01:46,050 --> 00:01:49,560
when the object is moving from a key frame

34
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:54,220
and a deceleration when it's
arriving on the next key frame.

35
00:01:54,220 --> 00:01:59,220
These are known as easing out
and easing in meaning that

36
00:01:59,910 --> 00:02:03,440
you are easing out of
the key frame leaving it

37
00:02:03,440 --> 00:02:05,220
for an acceleration

38
00:02:05,220 --> 00:02:09,730
and you are easing into the
next key frame slowing down

39
00:02:09,730 --> 00:02:12,690
before reaching or hitting its position.

40
00:02:12,690 --> 00:02:16,940
So basically with that
we've a very slow motion

41
00:02:16,940 --> 00:02:20,050
and it accelerate along the way.

42
00:02:20,050 --> 00:02:24,090
On frame 12, it will
reach its maximum speed.

43
00:02:24,090 --> 00:02:26,890
So the spacing will be the biggest.

44
00:02:26,890 --> 00:02:30,570
And when it will come close to frame 24,

45
00:02:30,570 --> 00:02:32,340
it will slow down.

46
00:02:32,340 --> 00:02:37,250
This is what the bezier
interpolation does by default.

47
00:02:37,250 --> 00:02:39,620
You can change the interpolation mode

48
00:02:39,620 --> 00:02:42,560
by selecting all the key frame with A

49
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:44,280
and pressing the T key.

50
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:47,420
It will open the interpolation panel

51
00:02:47,420 --> 00:02:51,250
where we can choose which
interpolation our key frame

52
00:02:51,250 --> 00:02:52,480
will be using.

53
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:56,760
There are a lot of different
pre-made interpolation

54
00:02:56,760 --> 00:03:00,630
but we only need to
focus on very first one.

55
00:03:00,630 --> 00:03:02,170
To be perfectly honest,

56
00:03:02,170 --> 00:03:04,560
I never used all the others,

57
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:06,870
but they can be very useful

58
00:03:06,870 --> 00:03:09,270
if you want to build fast motion

59
00:03:09,270 --> 00:03:11,740
for motion design, for example.

60
00:03:11,740 --> 00:03:14,740
But in our case, we will be mostly working

61
00:03:14,740 --> 00:03:17,040
using those three during the course.

62
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:20,430
Let's select the linear interpolation.

63
00:03:20,430 --> 00:03:22,500
As soon as I will select it,

64
00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:24,870
the behavior of the ball will change

65
00:03:24,870 --> 00:03:28,460
and we will get a more robotic movement.

66
00:03:28,460 --> 00:03:30,280
In the motion path tab,

67
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:32,600
I will click the update path

68
00:03:32,600 --> 00:03:35,400
and now we can see that the spacing

69
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:39,300
between the different
frames is always the same.

70
00:03:39,300 --> 00:03:40,570
The spacing is even.

71
00:03:40,570 --> 00:03:44,810
If we know compare and linear
and bezier interpolation,

72
00:03:44,810 --> 00:03:47,290
we can see that the timing is the same.

73
00:03:47,290 --> 00:03:51,390
They reach the lowest and
highest point at the same time

74
00:03:51,390 --> 00:03:55,970
but on the bezier, we have
a variation of the spacing.

75
00:03:55,970 --> 00:03:59,510
So we have a variation
of the speed of the ball

76
00:03:59,510 --> 00:04:02,770
while in linear it's constant.

77
00:04:02,770 --> 00:04:07,770
The linear interpolation is
very useful for robotic moves

78
00:04:08,090 --> 00:04:11,010
or for wall cycles for example

79
00:04:11,010 --> 00:04:12,960
when the foot is on the ground.

80
00:04:12,960 --> 00:04:14,370
Back to our motion,

81
00:04:14,370 --> 00:04:15,830
I will select all the key,

82
00:04:15,830 --> 00:04:19,630
press the T shortcut
and set it to constant.

83
00:04:19,630 --> 00:04:22,910
I will update the path
and now we can see that

84
00:04:22,910 --> 00:04:25,970
the ball is changing position only

85
00:04:25,970 --> 00:04:29,280
when it reaches the next key frame.

86
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:31,310
So it's considered a
constant interpolation

87
00:04:33,256 --> 00:04:35,140
or no interpolation

88
00:04:35,140 --> 00:04:39,613
and it's perfect to focus on
the timing of your animation.

89
00:04:39,613 --> 00:04:42,320
This is the kind of interpolation we use

90
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:44,580
when we are blocking the animation.

91
00:04:44,580 --> 00:04:48,800
In most animation,
blocking is the first stage

92
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:50,710
and it's very important.

93
00:04:50,710 --> 00:04:54,310
And we will start blocking
our bouncing ball animation

94
00:04:54,310 --> 00:04:55,930
in the next video.

95
00:04:55,930 --> 00:04:59,100
Stepped interpolation
can also be very useful

96
00:04:59,100 --> 00:05:02,350
whenever you want to give
the stop motion style

97
00:05:02,350 --> 00:05:04,973
to your animation like on this example.

98
00:05:05,950 --> 00:05:09,660
To summarize, we have seen
that interpolation occur

99
00:05:09,660 --> 00:05:11,600
between two key frames,

100
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:14,430
that we can change the interpolation mode

101
00:05:14,430 --> 00:05:15,950
using the T key,

102
00:05:15,950 --> 00:05:18,735
that the bezier interpolation

103
00:05:18,735 --> 00:05:21,390
allow acceleration and deceleration

104
00:05:21,390 --> 00:05:23,900
or easing in an easing out,

105
00:05:23,900 --> 00:05:27,810
that the linear interpolation
has a constant speed

106
00:05:27,810 --> 00:05:30,790
while the constant interpolation

107
00:05:30,790 --> 00:05:32,970
doesn't show any interpolation

108
00:05:32,970 --> 00:05:35,813
and is good to check out your timing.
