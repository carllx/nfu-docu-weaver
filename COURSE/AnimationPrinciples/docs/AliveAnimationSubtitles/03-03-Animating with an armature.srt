00:00:00,720 --> 00:00:01,870
- [Instructor] From the time being,

2
00:00:01,870 --> 00:00:04,820
we've been animating only object.

3
00:00:04,820 --> 00:00:08,330
And we have seen that each
time we try to animate

4
00:00:08,330 --> 00:00:11,190
a new object, the new animation

5
00:00:11,190 --> 00:00:14,100
or a new action data is created.

6
00:00:14,100 --> 00:00:17,000
And when it comes to animating an object,

7
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:21,390
we are currently only animating
at point, its origin point.

8
00:00:21,390 --> 00:00:23,700
But what if we want to animate

9
00:00:23,700 --> 00:00:26,370
a more complex object or a character,

10
00:00:26,370 --> 00:00:30,400
will we have to create an
action for each finger,

11
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:34,500
or do you bend an armor if
it's not a separated object?

12
00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:37,240
There is one tool that
allow us to do this,

13
00:00:37,240 --> 00:00:40,070
and you've probably
already heard about it.

14
00:00:40,070 --> 00:00:42,520
It's a rig or an armature.

15
00:00:42,520 --> 00:00:45,980
So if you think of a
human with character rig,

16
00:00:45,980 --> 00:00:48,290
it's generally a skeleton

17
00:00:48,290 --> 00:00:51,140
with a bunch of constraints and mechanism

18
00:00:51,140 --> 00:00:54,960
that allow the animator to
manipulate the character

19
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:56,707
in an intuitive fashion.

20
00:00:56,707 --> 00:00:58,910
And you can rig absolutely anything.

21
00:00:58,910 --> 00:01:01,450
Here is a new version
of our bouncing ball.

22
00:01:01,450 --> 00:01:03,380
So there is a new object in my scene,

23
00:01:03,380 --> 00:01:05,420
I can find my ball object,

24
00:01:05,420 --> 00:01:09,150
but I also can find this
ball armature object,

25
00:01:09,150 --> 00:01:12,260
and as an object, it has
transformed channels.

26
00:01:12,260 --> 00:01:13,643
And as any other object,

27
00:01:13,643 --> 00:01:16,290
it's a container with specific data,

28
00:01:16,290 --> 00:01:19,620
we can't find armature data and bone data.

29
00:01:19,620 --> 00:01:23,920
Also as a specific object,
it has a specific mode,

30
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:28,060
an edition mode, that
allow to bird the armature,

31
00:01:28,060 --> 00:01:30,300
and that is used by a riggers,

32
00:01:30,300 --> 00:01:34,210
so you won't need to enter
edit mode at any time

33
00:01:34,210 --> 00:01:38,010
and a pose mode, that is
the mode that will allow us

34
00:01:38,010 --> 00:01:42,560
to manipulate the armature
and animate whatever character

35
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:46,100
or object that is bound to this armature.

36
00:01:46,100 --> 00:01:49,330
We can change mode from object to pose

37
00:01:49,330 --> 00:01:51,300
by pressing Control + Tab.

38
00:01:51,300 --> 00:01:54,560
So let's have a closer look
to this rig or armature.

39
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:57,890
When in pose mode, you can
select whatever controller

40
00:01:57,890 --> 00:02:01,930
you want, those are called
bones, and you can consider them

41
00:02:01,930 --> 00:02:05,110
as being sub object of the armature.

42
00:02:05,110 --> 00:02:06,750
It means that each bone

43
00:02:06,750 --> 00:02:09,960
will have its own transformed channels

44
00:02:09,960 --> 00:02:14,960
and each bone have a specific
behavior or a specific task

45
00:02:15,060 --> 00:02:17,040
such as being created by the rigor.

46
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:20,140
On our bone domain
controller is called the root

47
00:02:20,140 --> 00:02:22,670
and allow us to move the entire ball.

48
00:02:22,670 --> 00:02:25,500
Moving the green controllers allow us

49
00:02:25,500 --> 00:02:27,720
to use squash and stretch,

50
00:02:27,720 --> 00:02:31,070
the yellow controller allow
us to rotate the ball.

51
00:02:31,070 --> 00:02:34,020
So instead of transforming
the ball directly,

52
00:02:34,020 --> 00:02:36,400
here we are using those controllers

53
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:38,690
to create those transformation.

54
00:02:38,690 --> 00:02:42,610
And it will allow us to
create way more complex

55
00:02:42,610 --> 00:02:45,390
transformation on to a character

56
00:02:45,390 --> 00:02:48,320
than animating simple objects,

57
00:02:48,320 --> 00:02:52,303
because the armature can deform the object

58
00:02:52,303 --> 00:02:54,300
that is bound to it.

59
00:02:54,300 --> 00:02:58,340
The armature is actually a simple modifier

60
00:02:58,340 --> 00:03:01,020
that deform our object.

61
00:03:01,020 --> 00:03:05,320
So a versatile armature
or rig will allow you

62
00:03:05,320 --> 00:03:08,640
to give the pose you
want for your character

63
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:11,770
and the good rig will give you the maximum

64
00:03:11,770 --> 00:03:15,950
of posing possibilities
with intuitive fashion.

65
00:03:15,950 --> 00:03:19,720
So before we start animating
this query character,

66
00:03:19,720 --> 00:03:21,820
I will give you some good practice

67
00:03:21,820 --> 00:03:25,443
when it comes to animating
using an armature.

68
00:03:25,443 --> 00:03:26,330
(swooshing slide)

69
00:03:26,330 --> 00:03:31,150
With my ball rig file open,
I will enable the Auto King

70
00:03:31,150 --> 00:03:35,110
and I will switch to pose mode
by pressing Control + Tab.

71
00:03:35,110 --> 00:03:37,730
As soon as I transform
one of the controller

72
00:03:37,730 --> 00:03:41,570
by selecting it pressing G, S or R

73
00:03:41,570 --> 00:03:43,640
as I will do for any object,

74
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:47,800
I can see that my Auto King
is recording what I'm doing

75
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:50,570
and Blender is creating a keyframe

76
00:03:50,570 --> 00:03:53,370
for the transform channels
of the controllers.

77
00:03:53,370 --> 00:03:57,070
The first awesome thing is that
if I switch to the doc sheet

78
00:03:57,070 --> 00:04:00,160
in the action editor and switch to see

79
00:04:00,160 --> 00:04:02,740
all the keyed channel, I can see that

80
00:04:02,740 --> 00:04:05,810
all the different manipulator animation

81
00:04:05,810 --> 00:04:08,920
are stored into a single action

82
00:04:08,920 --> 00:04:13,920
because the action is associated
to the armature object

83
00:04:14,307 --> 00:04:17,010
and we can consider each manipulator

84
00:04:17,010 --> 00:04:21,150
as being a sub object
that can be animated.

85
00:04:21,150 --> 00:04:22,680
And as for any object,

86
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:26,840
I can see that each of the
manipulator has their location,

87
00:04:26,840 --> 00:04:30,847
rotation and scale key, but
each of those controller

88
00:04:30,847 --> 00:04:35,100
has a specific desk, for example,
this rotation controller,

89
00:04:35,100 --> 00:04:38,320
if I try to move it or scale it, I can't.

90
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:40,290
And when I try to rotate it,

91
00:04:40,290 --> 00:04:43,820
it only rotates around its x-axis.

92
00:04:43,820 --> 00:04:48,090
So instead of having a keyframe
for every transform channel,

93
00:04:48,090 --> 00:04:51,460
that couldn't be better
if I add only a keyframe

94
00:04:51,460 --> 00:04:54,830
on its x rotation, since I won't be using

95
00:04:54,830 --> 00:04:57,090
any other of its transform channel.

96
00:04:57,090 --> 00:05:00,270
So I've selected all the
transform channel I don't want,

97
00:05:00,270 --> 00:05:03,170
And I will simply press
X to get rid of them.

98
00:05:03,170 --> 00:05:05,680
Now, I will go a little further in time

99
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:08,380
and I will try to rotate the ball.

100
00:05:08,380 --> 00:05:11,300
As soon as I rotate to
rotation controller,

101
00:05:11,300 --> 00:05:15,760
I can see Auto King is on and
the x value being arranged,

102
00:05:15,760 --> 00:05:18,720
meaning that it's being
transformed but not recorded.

103
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:23,390
But as soon as I release the
transform Blender, right again,

104
00:05:23,390 --> 00:05:26,300
a keyframe on all the transform channels,

105
00:05:26,300 --> 00:05:28,570
and I can go ahead for
a long time like that,

106
00:05:28,570 --> 00:05:30,390
removing the keyframe I don't want

107
00:05:30,390 --> 00:05:33,170
and whenever I try to
transform this manipulator,

108
00:05:33,170 --> 00:05:35,570
Blender writes a keyframe on everything.

109
00:05:35,570 --> 00:05:37,800
So to get rid of this issue,

110
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:41,150
we need to create what we call a king set.

111
00:05:41,150 --> 00:05:45,920
To access the king option, we
need to go into the timeline.

112
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:49,330
So the first thing I do
is renaming the action

113
00:05:49,330 --> 00:05:52,240
and call it zero zero
so that it will be first

114
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:55,640
in the alphabetic order, king set ball.

115
00:05:55,640 --> 00:05:58,390
Now I will check each controller

116
00:05:58,390 --> 00:06:01,560
and for each transform
channel that is locked,

117
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:05,010
I will get rid of the
corresponding keyframe

118
00:06:05,010 --> 00:06:07,670
because these are the only keys

119
00:06:07,670 --> 00:06:11,030
that will really serve
the animation of the ball.

120
00:06:11,030 --> 00:06:14,730
In the end I only have
14 keyframes remaining

121
00:06:14,730 --> 00:06:17,480
instead of the 36 initial I had.

122
00:06:17,480 --> 00:06:20,140
So my action editor and my graph editor

123
00:06:20,140 --> 00:06:24,640
will sure be way cleaner, I
now need to open the timeline.

124
00:06:24,640 --> 00:06:29,070
So I will drag a new editor
and switch to the timeline.

125
00:06:29,070 --> 00:06:32,530
In the timeline header I
will go to the king set

126
00:06:32,530 --> 00:06:34,100
and in the active king,

127
00:06:34,100 --> 00:06:37,520
I can see that I have a
lot of different options.

128
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:40,440
So I will choose rotation
and I will try rotating

129
00:06:40,440 --> 00:06:43,830
my manipulator then
Blender is still recording

130
00:06:43,830 --> 00:06:46,300
all the keyframe, and this is because

131
00:06:46,300 --> 00:06:49,400
we need to tell Blender
to use this king set

132
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:53,380
by clicking the arrow near
the auto recording button

133
00:06:53,380 --> 00:06:56,250
and choose only active king set.

134
00:06:56,250 --> 00:06:59,130
Now when I try transforming
my manipulator,

135
00:06:59,130 --> 00:07:01,910
all the rotation channel will be keyframe.

136
00:07:01,910 --> 00:07:03,130
So we are getting close,

137
00:07:03,130 --> 00:07:06,050
I will get rid of the unwanted keyframe

138
00:07:06,050 --> 00:07:08,280
and if we go back into the king set,

139
00:07:08,280 --> 00:07:10,860
we can see that there is a lot of option

140
00:07:10,860 --> 00:07:14,620
and the one that is interesting
for us is available.

141
00:07:14,620 --> 00:07:19,240
From there Blender will only
auto record the keyframe

142
00:07:19,240 --> 00:07:22,570
that has already been written,
meaning that to channel

143
00:07:22,570 --> 00:07:27,570
where we have inserted a keyframe
file to use this king set.

144
00:07:28,180 --> 00:07:30,500
If you haven't set the first keyframe

145
00:07:30,500 --> 00:07:33,030
before applying the king set,

146
00:07:33,030 --> 00:07:36,050
then the Auto King
won't write any keyframe

147
00:07:36,050 --> 00:07:39,030
and if I try inserting a
new keyframe pressing I,

148
00:07:39,030 --> 00:07:41,170
I will get this error message.

149
00:07:41,170 --> 00:07:45,290
Basically, I can't write a
keyframe with the actual setup.

150
00:07:45,290 --> 00:07:49,360
To fix that, we only need to
insert a keyframe directly

151
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:51,810
into the transform channel panel,

152
00:07:51,810 --> 00:07:55,180
then I can get rid of the
two channels I don't want,

153
00:07:55,180 --> 00:07:57,000
the Y and Z channel.

154
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,800
There is another way to set the Auto King

155
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:04,520
on available by default, it's
by going into the preferences,

156
00:08:04,520 --> 00:08:07,450
animation, only insert available.

157
00:08:07,450 --> 00:08:10,650
It's really a matter of
personal preferences.

158
00:08:10,650 --> 00:08:13,140
I personally use the king filter,

159
00:08:13,140 --> 00:08:17,870
please note that I'm
using Blender 2.92 Alpha,

160
00:08:17,870 --> 00:08:21,670
so the position of the
different option might change.

161
00:08:21,670 --> 00:08:25,320
All right, now you are ready
to animate using an armature.

162
00:08:25,320 --> 00:08:27,670
We have seen that we can use an armature

163
00:08:27,670 --> 00:08:30,690
to perform more complex transformation,

164
00:08:30,690 --> 00:08:35,650
that an armature can deform
the object that is bound to it.

165
00:08:35,650 --> 00:08:39,370
So the armature object
is made of super object

166
00:08:39,370 --> 00:08:44,370
and called bone, each of those
controller bone can be king,

167
00:08:44,490 --> 00:08:47,630
but Blender will create a single action

168
00:08:47,630 --> 00:08:50,860
that will hold the different key

169
00:08:50,860 --> 00:08:54,200
of all the controller
of a single armature.

170
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:58,970
It is highly recommended to
create a king set to keep

171
00:08:58,970 --> 00:09:02,753
your dopesheet and graph
editor as clean as possible.
