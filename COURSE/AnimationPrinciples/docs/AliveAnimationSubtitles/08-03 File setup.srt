1
00:00:00,133 --> 00:00:00,966
- [Instructor] It's time

2
00:00:00,966 --> 00:00:02,800
to prepare our Blender file.

3
00:00:02,800 --> 00:00:06,489
First, let's get rid of
everything by pressing A

4
00:00:06,489 --> 00:00:09,580
to select all the object
and X to delete them.

5
00:00:09,580 --> 00:00:13,120
From there, we need to link our first rig.

6
00:00:13,120 --> 00:00:16,840
So while you go to File,
Link, go into the folder

7
00:00:16,840 --> 00:00:18,200
of chapter eight

8
00:00:18,200 --> 00:00:20,630
and select the, "Punching Bag" file.

9
00:00:20,630 --> 00:00:22,250
Choose the, "Collection" folder

10
00:00:22,250 --> 00:00:25,330
and here you will find
only one collection.

11
00:00:25,330 --> 00:00:27,220
Just double click it.

12
00:00:27,220 --> 00:00:28,560
Click the arrow next

13
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:31,580
to the orange collection to unfold it

14
00:00:31,580 --> 00:00:34,350
and right click on the sub-collection,

15
00:00:34,350 --> 00:00:35,780
go to ID data,

16
00:00:35,780 --> 00:00:39,240
and choose make library
override hierarchy.

17
00:00:39,240 --> 00:00:41,500
Now both the punching bag object

18
00:00:41,500 --> 00:00:43,420
and armature are available.

19
00:00:43,420 --> 00:00:45,230
In the viewport changing option,

20
00:00:45,230 --> 00:00:47,130
I will enable textures.

21
00:00:47,130 --> 00:00:49,550
Now I will select the armature

22
00:00:49,550 --> 00:00:52,450
and press control tab
to enter, "Poles Mode."

23
00:00:52,450 --> 00:00:55,000
The main rotation
controller will allow you

24
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:56,740
to swing the punching bag.

25
00:00:56,740 --> 00:00:58,410
The blue controllers are

26
00:00:58,410 --> 00:01:00,520
a forward kinematic chain.

27
00:01:00,520 --> 00:01:03,870
You are free to rotate,
scale or move them.

28
00:01:03,870 --> 00:01:06,927
The yellow controller
on the tree curve bone.

29
00:01:06,927 --> 00:01:08,910
They are perfect to
create the impact frames.

30
00:01:08,910 --> 00:01:12,040
There is also a controller
to move the chains,

31
00:01:12,040 --> 00:01:14,770
but I don't think we are
going to move this one.

32
00:01:14,770 --> 00:01:15,603
Finally,

33
00:01:15,603 --> 00:01:16,970
you will find a root controller

34
00:01:16,970 --> 00:01:19,290
to move the whole rig in space.

35
00:01:19,290 --> 00:01:21,250
We need to link our character

36
00:01:21,250 --> 00:01:23,840
so we can go to file link.

37
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:25,800
I will go in the folder

38
00:01:25,800 --> 00:01:27,657
of chapter five and click the,

39
00:01:27,657 --> 00:01:29,893
"Trident Rig" final file.

40
00:01:35,690 --> 00:01:37,750
From there going to collection

41
00:01:37,750 --> 00:01:40,630
and choose, "Trident
Character Collection",

42
00:01:40,630 --> 00:01:42,030
no click the arrow next

43
00:01:42,030 --> 00:01:44,830
to, "Trident Character Collection"

44
00:01:44,830 --> 00:01:46,840
and right cheek on the sub collection,

45
00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:48,587
go to ID data and choose,

46
00:01:48,587 --> 00:01:51,032
"Make library override hierarchy."

47
00:01:51,032 --> 00:01:52,820
We now need to load

48
00:01:52,820 --> 00:01:54,890
our rig script

49
00:01:54,890 --> 00:01:56,010
to do so.

50
00:01:56,010 --> 00:01:59,470
Open the text editor
instead of the timeline.

51
00:01:59,470 --> 00:02:01,560
Then in the middle of the top bar

52
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:02,750
of the detail.

53
00:02:02,750 --> 00:02:05,120
Click the folder to open

54
00:02:05,120 --> 00:02:07,310
the punching bag rig UI.

55
00:02:07,310 --> 00:02:09,620
Once the script is open,

56
00:02:09,620 --> 00:02:12,870
go to text and click the register option.

57
00:02:12,870 --> 00:02:13,703
From there,

58
00:02:13,703 --> 00:02:15,010
you can press the play button

59
00:02:15,010 --> 00:02:17,640
in the top bar of the text editor.

60
00:02:17,640 --> 00:02:20,450
This will enable the
UI of the punching bag,

61
00:02:20,450 --> 00:02:23,490
which is very busy with a few layers.

62
00:02:23,490 --> 00:02:24,323
From there.

63
00:02:24,323 --> 00:02:25,590
Repeat the process and go

64
00:02:25,590 --> 00:02:27,530
to folder number five and search

65
00:02:27,530 --> 00:02:29,340
for the Trident rig script.

66
00:02:29,340 --> 00:02:31,680
Again, go to text register

67
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:33,590
and then press the play button.

68
00:02:33,590 --> 00:02:34,423
From there.

69
00:02:34,423 --> 00:02:36,500
Let's open the action detail

70
00:02:36,500 --> 00:02:37,640
where we will be able

71
00:02:37,640 --> 00:02:39,410
to access the king set

72
00:02:39,410 --> 00:02:41,490
of our different rigs.

73
00:02:41,490 --> 00:02:43,670
I will start with the character.

74
00:02:43,670 --> 00:02:47,370
I will switch from dope
sheet to action editor,

75
00:02:47,370 --> 00:02:51,200
and I will simply
duplicate decaying action,

76
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:52,330
but I will rename

77
00:02:52,330 --> 00:02:54,490
the action combo blocking

78
00:02:54,490 --> 00:02:55,700
on there in the field of view,

79
00:02:55,700 --> 00:02:56,980
I will press control tab

80
00:02:56,980 --> 00:02:59,340
to get back into, "Object Mode,"

81
00:02:59,340 --> 00:03:02,950
select the rig off our punching bag

82
00:03:02,950 --> 00:03:04,930
and do the same process.

83
00:03:04,930 --> 00:03:07,490
Duplicate the current action

84
00:03:07,490 --> 00:03:11,030
and rename it, "Combo blocking back."

85
00:03:11,030 --> 00:03:15,200
Then I will go back onto the Trident rig

86
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:16,920
and in the rig properties,

87
00:03:16,920 --> 00:03:21,160
I will disable the visibility
of all the weapons.

88
00:03:21,160 --> 00:03:23,370
Then I will hide the controllers

89
00:03:23,370 --> 00:03:24,620
of the weapons.

90
00:03:24,620 --> 00:03:26,729
And in the head and neck properties

91
00:03:26,729 --> 00:03:27,810
I will make sure

92
00:03:27,810 --> 00:03:29,813
that the, "Head follow," is disabled

93
00:03:29,813 --> 00:03:32,220
and the, "Neck follow," is enabled.

94
00:03:32,220 --> 00:03:33,440
This animation we are going

95
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:35,870
to use arm forward kinematic

96
00:03:35,870 --> 00:03:37,830
with the, "Arm follow," disabled

97
00:03:37,830 --> 00:03:39,920
on both arms.

98
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:41,300
From there let's position,

99
00:03:41,300 --> 00:03:43,200
the heavy bag or punching bag.

100
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:44,467
I will switch to object mode,

101
00:03:44,467 --> 00:03:46,310
select it and press control tab

102
00:03:46,310 --> 00:03:48,340
to switch to, "Post Mode."

103
00:03:48,340 --> 00:03:49,890
Let's select the root bone

104
00:03:49,890 --> 00:03:54,150
and set it's Z position to 0.2 meters

105
00:03:54,150 --> 00:03:58,821
and Y position to minus 1.5 meters.

106
00:03:58,821 --> 00:03:59,654
(swoosh)

107
00:03:59,654 --> 00:04:01,980
Now I like to change the model preview,

108
00:04:01,980 --> 00:04:04,720
so I will go to the
viewport shading option,

109
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:08,500
switch to flat and enable
cavity and shadows.

110
00:04:08,500 --> 00:04:11,230
I think it offers a better readability

111
00:04:11,230 --> 00:04:12,300
of the models.

112
00:04:12,300 --> 00:04:15,330
A little tip here, select a both armature

113
00:04:15,330 --> 00:04:17,820
in object mode, then press control tab,

114
00:04:17,820 --> 00:04:19,700
and you will be in pause mode

115
00:04:19,700 --> 00:04:22,260
on both amateur at the same time.

116
00:04:22,260 --> 00:04:25,010
This way, no need to jump back and forth

117
00:04:25,010 --> 00:04:28,110
into object mode to be able to select one

118
00:04:28,110 --> 00:04:29,600
or the other armature.

119
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:31,470
As soon as you are selecting one

120
00:04:31,470 --> 00:04:33,240
or the other armature,

121
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:35,370
the, "Action editor" will update.

122
00:04:35,370 --> 00:04:37,760
As for our previous exercises,

123
00:04:37,760 --> 00:04:40,514
I will open a new window on the right side

124
00:04:40,514 --> 00:04:43,650
of the screen and create a new 3D view

125
00:04:43,650 --> 00:04:46,600
to preview our poses from another angle.

126
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:48,380
One last thing I'd like to add

127
00:04:48,380 --> 00:04:51,770
before we get started is a ground object.

128
00:04:51,770 --> 00:04:52,780
This will help us

129
00:04:52,780 --> 00:04:55,050
to define the contact pose of the feet.

130
00:04:55,050 --> 00:04:57,280
So I will press control tab to go back

131
00:04:57,280 --> 00:04:59,900
into, "Object Mode." Press shift A

132
00:04:59,900 --> 00:05:01,100
and add the plane.

133
00:05:01,100 --> 00:05:04,280
I will scale it up and press control A

134
00:05:04,280 --> 00:05:06,310
to apply all the transformations.

135
00:05:06,310 --> 00:05:09,020
From there, I will create a new material

136
00:05:09,020 --> 00:05:10,130
for this ground object

137
00:05:10,130 --> 00:05:12,120
that I will call, "The Ground."

138
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:15,150
I will give it a dark gray color,

139
00:05:15,150 --> 00:05:18,890
and I will reduce the specularity to 0.1.

140
00:05:18,890 --> 00:05:21,110
This way we won't have any visual noise.

141
00:05:21,110 --> 00:05:23,650
Whenever we are previewing our render

142
00:05:23,650 --> 00:05:25,290
with fancy reflections

143
00:05:25,290 --> 00:05:26,380
and stuff like that.

144
00:05:26,380 --> 00:05:28,040
From there, I will add up

145
00:05:28,040 --> 00:05:31,060
to the viewport display option and set it

146
00:05:31,060 --> 00:05:32,620
to a dark gray color

147
00:05:32,620 --> 00:05:35,100
so that it's not too distract-ive

148
00:05:35,100 --> 00:05:37,460
and not too aggressive to the eyes.

149
00:05:37,460 --> 00:05:40,910
I will rename this flat object ground

150
00:05:40,910 --> 00:05:43,630
and I will move it in the scene collection

151
00:05:43,630 --> 00:05:44,950
in the, "Filter Menu,"

152
00:05:44,950 --> 00:05:48,160
I will enable the selection restriction

153
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:50,620
and they will make the ground unselectable

154
00:05:50,620 --> 00:05:53,170
so that we won't be
selecting it by accident.

155
00:05:53,170 --> 00:05:56,710
Now, the final tip to be
able to pose our character

156
00:05:56,710 --> 00:05:58,440
from the bottom view is

157
00:05:58,440 --> 00:06:00,760
to head up to the shading option

158
00:06:00,760 --> 00:06:03,840
and enable, "Back face culling,"

159
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:06,510
This way, whenever we
are facing the back face

160
00:06:06,510 --> 00:06:08,940
of the plane, it becomes transparent.

161
00:06:08,940 --> 00:06:11,690
From there, you can
reorganize your collection,

162
00:06:11,690 --> 00:06:14,010
get treated of any useless collection

163
00:06:14,010 --> 00:06:17,130
so that we just have our
character collection,

164
00:06:17,130 --> 00:06:19,990
heavy bag collection
and our ground object.

165
00:06:19,990 --> 00:06:21,140
And we can get started.
