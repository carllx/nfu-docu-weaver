1
00:00:00,970 --> 00:00:04,570
- Start polishing the
torso of our character.

2
00:00:04,570 --> 00:00:09,310
As usual, I will start with
the torso route controller.

3
00:00:09,310 --> 00:00:10,820
This is something we have been doing

4
00:00:10,820 --> 00:00:13,030
on all the previous lessons,

5
00:00:13,030 --> 00:00:16,480
whether it was the robot
or the squirrel character

6
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:19,390
or the run cycle on this character.

7
00:00:19,390 --> 00:00:23,940
What I want to point out here
is that the motion of the

8
00:00:23,940 --> 00:00:27,343
torso root is one of
the most important parts

9
00:00:27,343 --> 00:00:29,530
of your character.

10
00:00:29,530 --> 00:00:34,420
Define the center of gravity
motion of your character.

11
00:00:34,420 --> 00:00:37,700
Hence it will define the weight and rhythm

12
00:00:37,700 --> 00:00:39,220
of your walk cycle,

13
00:00:39,220 --> 00:00:43,360
which is the most important
notion in body mechanic.

14
00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:47,210
Start with the up and down
motion, or Z location curve,

15
00:00:47,210 --> 00:00:50,110
which is the most important
on the walk cycle.

16
00:00:50,110 --> 00:00:53,350
Right now, the curve
looks very (indistinct)

17
00:00:53,350 --> 00:00:54,640
and very smooth

18
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:56,970
but it seems that the extreme are

19
00:00:56,970 --> 00:00:59,420
pretty well positioned in time.

20
00:00:59,420 --> 00:01:03,430
Goal will be to bring contrast
to the motion by holding

21
00:01:03,430 --> 00:01:06,930
a bit the down pose and the up pose.

22
00:01:06,930 --> 00:01:10,470
We will have a slight plateau
on the highest and the lowest

23
00:01:10,470 --> 00:01:12,290
values of the curve.

24
00:01:12,290 --> 00:01:13,640
On the extreme up,

25
00:01:13,640 --> 00:01:17,800
I'm trying to have the
leg almost fully extended.

26
00:01:17,800 --> 00:01:21,220
Here I'm comparing the
previous pose with the new one.

27
00:01:21,220 --> 00:01:23,350
During the pushing or up pose,

28
00:01:23,350 --> 00:01:26,910
I'm trying to get an almost straight leg.

29
00:01:26,910 --> 00:01:29,110
This give a better shape to the leg

30
00:01:29,110 --> 00:01:31,890
and a better line of action to it.

31
00:01:31,890 --> 00:01:34,560
We will talk about line
or action in detail

32
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:36,200
in the next chapter.

33
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:39,210
To make it simple here,
it makes the silhouette

34
00:01:39,210 --> 00:01:41,730
of our character more readable.

35
00:01:41,730 --> 00:01:46,450
As the straight leg supports
the idea of verticality,

36
00:01:46,450 --> 00:01:48,280
of pushing up.

37
00:01:48,280 --> 00:01:51,933
So I've polished the
first half of the motion,

38
00:01:51,933 --> 00:01:55,610
I will first duplicate the
extreme down on frame four

39
00:01:55,610 --> 00:02:00,360
and move it by 16 frame of
the length of the cycle,

40
00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:04,390
get rid of all the key
frame after frame 20.

41
00:02:04,390 --> 00:02:08,250
And they will duplicate the
polished portion of the curve

42
00:02:08,250 --> 00:02:13,230
from frame four to frame 20
and move it by 16 frames.

43
00:02:13,230 --> 00:02:16,850
There I can select the key on frame 32,

44
00:02:16,850 --> 00:02:19,860
if you don't have one and you
can insert a key frame there

45
00:02:19,860 --> 00:02:21,900
and move it on frame zero.

46
00:02:21,900 --> 00:02:26,900
You treat of any keys that
goes beyond our 32 frame rail.

47
00:02:26,940 --> 00:02:29,100
If needed, don't forget to rotate

48
00:02:29,100 --> 00:02:33,450
to beat the keys on frame
zero and 32 to align the curve

49
00:02:33,450 --> 00:02:35,390
from one cycle to the other.

50
00:02:35,390 --> 00:02:38,450
Where you are polishing a
specific feature or area

51
00:02:38,450 --> 00:02:39,740
of your character,

52
00:02:39,740 --> 00:02:42,560
don't hesitate to hide the other part.

53
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:45,616
So I will add that to the
visibility properties panel

54
00:02:45,616 --> 00:02:47,550
and I will hide arms

55
00:02:47,550 --> 00:02:50,660
and hide the arms
(indistinct) controllers.

56
00:02:50,660 --> 00:02:53,310
I do so I remove visual noise

57
00:02:53,310 --> 00:02:55,800
and I feel like the up and down motion

58
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:59,900
while it's properly timed
is a bit too strong.

59
00:02:59,900 --> 00:03:02,440
To make sure I'm using the bounding box

60
00:03:02,440 --> 00:03:06,240
as a pivot point so that I
can scale the whole curve

61
00:03:06,240 --> 00:03:07,900
on an average.

62
00:03:07,900 --> 00:03:11,170
I will simply scale the
whole curve on the Y axis

63
00:03:11,170 --> 00:03:13,340
by pressing S and then Y.

64
00:03:13,340 --> 00:03:17,176
You can also move the whole
curve along the Y axis

65
00:03:17,176 --> 00:03:20,325
in the (indistinct) to
either raise or lower

66
00:03:20,325 --> 00:03:23,120
the center of gravity of your character.

67
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:26,030
I want my character to
almost have a straight leg

68
00:03:26,030 --> 00:03:30,840
whenever he is pushing so
that it feels lightweight.

69
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:33,370
With the up and down motion now polished,

70
00:03:33,370 --> 00:03:35,680
I will jump to the side to side motion,

71
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:37,633
working on the explication.

72
00:03:38,540 --> 00:03:42,520
We'll add the Z location and
display the X location curve.

73
00:03:42,520 --> 00:03:44,580
It currently looks a bit messy.

74
00:03:44,580 --> 00:03:47,140
We are going to fix it pretty quickly.

75
00:03:47,140 --> 00:03:50,620
First thing we need to do
is identify the extremes.

76
00:03:50,620 --> 00:03:53,462
Weight mainly shift
between the contact pose

77
00:03:53,462 --> 00:03:55,710
and the passing pose.

78
00:03:55,710 --> 00:03:59,550
Then the body is to decide
during the pushing pose,

79
00:03:59,550 --> 00:04:02,820
before the body starts
falling on the other side

80
00:04:02,820 --> 00:04:04,083
and accelerate,

81
00:04:04,970 --> 00:04:07,920
shifting the weight onto the other leg.

82
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:09,193
To the polished curve,

83
00:04:09,193 --> 00:04:11,550
when zero we have the contact pose,

84
00:04:11,550 --> 00:04:13,790
and we are almost reached the extreme

85
00:04:13,790 --> 00:04:15,600
on frame six in the curve

86
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:17,430
is until frame 11,

87
00:04:17,430 --> 00:04:19,160
where we start pushing.

88
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:21,100
Frame 11 to frame 15,

89
00:04:21,100 --> 00:04:24,960
we slowly shift the
weight onto the other side

90
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:27,780
until the contact pose where we will have

91
00:04:27,780 --> 00:04:30,280
a fast change in direction.

92
00:04:30,280 --> 00:04:33,710
So you really want to shift
the weight from side to side

93
00:04:33,710 --> 00:04:35,220
during the fall,

94
00:04:35,220 --> 00:04:38,390
whenever the leg is about
to contact the ground

95
00:04:38,390 --> 00:04:40,070
and contact the ground.

96
00:04:40,070 --> 00:04:43,680
And as the character recover
with this contacting leg

97
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:45,306
and start pushing on it,

98
00:04:45,306 --> 00:04:47,980
it will first absorb the momentum

99
00:04:47,980 --> 00:04:50,930
and then start pushing on the other side.

100
00:04:50,930 --> 00:04:54,732
As usual, you can refer to the
current curve on this plane,

101
00:04:54,732 --> 00:04:57,510
but if you want to properly learn,

102
00:04:57,510 --> 00:05:00,670
mostly focus on what we've just explained

103
00:05:00,670 --> 00:05:02,420
first motion during the fall,

104
00:05:02,420 --> 00:05:05,000
and then easing from the transition.

105
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,890
I was getting close to a convincing result

106
00:05:07,890 --> 00:05:11,870
I want to be able to properly
symmetrize the motion.

107
00:05:11,870 --> 00:05:13,960
Note that this is not mandatory.

108
00:05:13,960 --> 00:05:17,170
If you have a difference between
the left to right motion,

109
00:05:17,170 --> 00:05:19,230
it can be interesting

110
00:05:19,230 --> 00:05:22,810
as a real life walk
cycle is never perfect,

111
00:05:22,810 --> 00:05:24,780
but I just want to show you how

112
00:05:24,780 --> 00:05:27,100
to mirror the curve over time.

113
00:05:27,100 --> 00:05:29,974
I will get rid of any
curves that goes beyond

114
00:05:29,974 --> 00:05:31,770
half of the cycle.

115
00:05:31,770 --> 00:05:35,230
After frame 16, we select
all the other keys,

116
00:05:35,230 --> 00:05:40,230
duplicate them and move them
by 16 frame on the X axis.

117
00:05:40,450 --> 00:05:44,900
Now, my side to side motion
repeat over 16 frame,

118
00:05:44,900 --> 00:05:47,390
but always go onto the same side.

119
00:05:47,390 --> 00:05:50,590
You need to symmetrize the
value of our curve along

120
00:05:50,590 --> 00:05:54,190
the Y axis and around the value zero,

121
00:05:54,190 --> 00:05:58,490
we can easily do this
by using the 2D cursor.

122
00:05:58,490 --> 00:06:01,190
It is defined by the play at position

123
00:06:01,190 --> 00:06:03,240
for the X value

124
00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:07,260
and this horizontal blue
line for the Y value.

125
00:06:07,260 --> 00:06:11,780
Since we want to symmetrize our
curve around the value zero,

126
00:06:11,780 --> 00:06:15,240
we need to reposition our 2D cursor

127
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:17,460
horizontal value to zero.

128
00:06:17,460 --> 00:06:21,400
Precisely set this value
by adding to the view tab

129
00:06:21,400 --> 00:06:24,210
where we can see the play at position

130
00:06:24,210 --> 00:06:28,260
named cursor X value and the Y value.

131
00:06:28,260 --> 00:06:31,710
So I would replace the
current Y value by zero.

132
00:06:31,710 --> 00:06:35,100
Now, I just have to
make sure that I'm using

133
00:06:35,100 --> 00:06:37,940
the 2D cursor as a pivot point,

134
00:06:37,940 --> 00:06:41,410
scale on the Y axis by minus one,

135
00:06:41,410 --> 00:06:45,420
the keys from frame 16 to frame 32.

136
00:06:45,420 --> 00:06:50,120
This way, we make sure that
our cycle is currently cycling.

137
00:06:50,120 --> 00:06:52,400
And then I will clean a bit the curve,

138
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:55,510
removing the keys that talk
too close one to the other,

139
00:06:55,510 --> 00:06:58,160
and doesn't bring any information.

140
00:06:58,160 --> 00:07:01,680
From there, we can work
on the Y location axis

141
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:03,203
of our torso.

142
00:07:04,780 --> 00:07:07,620
Polishing the Y curve is
going to be pretty simple

143
00:07:07,620 --> 00:07:12,530
because it has a very subtle
influence onto our walk cycle.

144
00:07:12,530 --> 00:07:14,770
If you don't want to play with this curve,

145
00:07:14,770 --> 00:07:16,070
that's fine,

146
00:07:16,070 --> 00:07:19,690
but you should always
input a bit of motion.

147
00:07:19,690 --> 00:07:23,870
By that is that since we
are animating our walk cycle

148
00:07:23,870 --> 00:07:25,270
on the spot,

149
00:07:25,270 --> 00:07:29,150
the torso route forward and backward wise

150
00:07:29,150 --> 00:07:31,120
should it be on the spot too.

151
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:34,180
There is always a bit
of variation of our time

152
00:07:34,180 --> 00:07:38,645
while your whole body is
moving in a linear fashion,

153
00:07:38,645 --> 00:07:41,734
the are variation for every single point

154
00:07:41,734 --> 00:07:43,740
in the body of your character.

155
00:07:43,740 --> 00:07:47,330
Thing to know is that as the
character is falling forward,

156
00:07:47,330 --> 00:07:49,500
just before the contact pose,

157
00:07:49,500 --> 00:07:52,300
the body is accelerating forward.

158
00:07:52,300 --> 00:07:55,450
And as soon as the foot
is hitting the ground,

159
00:07:55,450 --> 00:07:59,060
the body will slow down and move backward.

160
00:07:59,060 --> 00:08:01,410
Double check the values of my curve.

161
00:08:01,410 --> 00:08:05,950
You can see that the range of
motion is very, very subtle.

162
00:08:05,950 --> 00:08:09,277
It just brings some extra
texture to the motion.

163
00:08:09,277 --> 00:08:11,730
Our torso root is now polished.

164
00:08:11,730 --> 00:08:13,100
And in the next video,

165
00:08:13,100 --> 00:08:16,333
we are going to polish the
other features of the torso.
