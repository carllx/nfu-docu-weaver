1
00:00:00,840 --> 00:00:04,570
In this video, we will start
blocking a new animation.

2
00:00:04,570 --> 00:00:08,340
This is going to be an idle
animation of the squirrel.

3
00:00:08,340 --> 00:00:11,340
But we need our character to transition

4
00:00:11,340 --> 00:00:13,910
from the run cycle into a stop,

5
00:00:13,910 --> 00:00:17,700
do the idle, and then get
back into the run cycle.

6
00:00:17,700 --> 00:00:19,860
At least to make our character

7
00:00:19,860 --> 00:00:22,900
checking the surrounding environment.

8
00:00:22,900 --> 00:00:25,250
And then as it hears some noise

9
00:00:25,250 --> 00:00:29,900
maybe it will go back into the
run cycle to flee the danger.

10
00:00:29,900 --> 00:00:33,290
It is going to be a
very fun idle to animate

11
00:00:33,290 --> 00:00:36,940
and the first step is always
to check out references.

12
00:00:36,940 --> 00:00:40,520
Looking for some specific information.

13
00:00:40,520 --> 00:00:42,900
First one is the rhythm of the character.

14
00:00:42,900 --> 00:00:45,990
You can see how we jumped
from a pose to another

15
00:00:45,990 --> 00:00:49,530
in a very fast motion
and sometimes just stop.

16
00:00:49,530 --> 00:00:52,520
And then it almost stay still.

17
00:00:52,520 --> 00:00:55,210
Those various snappy motion really brings

18
00:00:55,210 --> 00:00:58,525
the fact that our
character is lightweight.

19
00:00:58,525 --> 00:01:02,570
Squirrels use their tails also
to communicate their feelings

20
00:01:02,570 --> 00:01:04,770
and to communicate between them.

21
00:01:04,770 --> 00:01:08,680
So we can use the tail to
communicate surprise or fear,

22
00:01:08,680 --> 00:01:10,110
to our character.

23
00:01:10,110 --> 00:01:13,350
The last thing that really
shines through those reference

24
00:01:13,350 --> 00:01:15,700
is the briefing pattern of the character.

25
00:01:15,700 --> 00:01:19,090
It is really fast paced
and he does show a lot

26
00:01:19,090 --> 00:01:21,970
when the character is
not moving that much.

27
00:01:21,970 --> 00:01:23,770
We'll be blocking five poses.

28
00:01:23,770 --> 00:01:26,550
The first one where our characters stop

29
00:01:26,550 --> 00:01:28,360
and look at the side.

30
00:01:28,360 --> 00:01:32,550
Then it will raise on its back
leg and maybe smell the air.

31
00:01:32,550 --> 00:01:36,010
We will then pull his
attention to the other side.

32
00:01:36,010 --> 00:01:39,090
Then he will turn his head
in a more grounding pose

33
00:01:39,090 --> 00:01:42,160
because he heard something,
transition into a pose

34
00:01:42,160 --> 00:01:45,320
where he will start
running to flee the danger.

35
00:01:45,320 --> 00:01:48,380
Since we are going to
transition from the run cycle

36
00:01:48,380 --> 00:01:51,556
the first thing I will do
is clean the run cycle.

37
00:01:51,556 --> 00:01:56,210
So I will select older
curve and press the Shift+E

38
00:01:56,210 --> 00:01:58,990
and clear the cyclic modifier.

39
00:01:58,990 --> 00:02:03,410
Then I will select the root
bone and I will press Shift+E

40
00:02:03,410 --> 00:02:05,960
and get clear of the linear extrapolation

41
00:02:05,960 --> 00:02:08,510
by choosing constant extrapolation.

42
00:02:08,510 --> 00:02:11,030
Make sure you have all your keys selected

43
00:02:11,030 --> 00:02:12,740
when removing your modifiers

44
00:02:12,740 --> 00:02:16,850
or your character will be
kind of behaving weirdly.

45
00:02:16,850 --> 00:02:18,280
At least it looks pretty fun

46
00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:20,620
but it will be hard to work with that.

47
00:02:20,620 --> 00:02:24,190
So once I'm done, I will
duplicate my run cycle.

48
00:02:24,190 --> 00:02:26,960
So that I have a new action to work with

49
00:02:26,960 --> 00:02:28,800
that I will call idle.

50
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:31,740
And I will keep the run cycle animation

51
00:02:31,740 --> 00:02:34,460
at the beginning of this new animation.

52
00:02:34,460 --> 00:02:37,220
This will help us creating the transition

53
00:02:37,220 --> 00:02:41,040
between the idle animation
and the run cycle.

54
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:44,610
We'll have to animate our
character transitioning

55
00:02:44,610 --> 00:02:46,940
from the run cycle to the idle.

56
00:02:46,940 --> 00:02:50,700
But as we did for any
of our animation so far,

57
00:02:50,700 --> 00:02:54,295
I will go on frame 15
and I will stop blocking

58
00:02:54,295 --> 00:02:57,250
the first pose of our idle.

59
00:02:57,250 --> 00:03:01,050
The first thing I do is to
flatten the feet of the character

60
00:03:01,050 --> 00:03:04,770
because they're on the ground
and since you will have

61
00:03:04,770 --> 00:03:09,310
some kind of still pose we
need him to be grounded.

62
00:03:09,310 --> 00:03:11,650
And to make our life a little easier

63
00:03:11,650 --> 00:03:14,660
I will keep the back feet on the ground.

64
00:03:14,660 --> 00:03:16,970
In the same position they had

65
00:03:16,970 --> 00:03:20,450
when he land at the end of the run cycle.

66
00:03:20,450 --> 00:03:23,510
You can do the pose you
want, but, I believe

67
00:03:23,510 --> 00:03:26,870
it will be better for you
to follow what I'm doing

68
00:03:26,870 --> 00:03:28,700
so that you won't be lost

69
00:03:28,700 --> 00:03:31,300
if you're not use to animate that much.

70
00:03:31,300 --> 00:03:34,287
As I block the character
pose I will give you

71
00:03:34,287 --> 00:03:37,940
the key component I'm
looking for when doing so.

72
00:03:37,940 --> 00:03:40,990
I don't want my character
to stay on his four leg

73
00:03:40,990 --> 00:03:42,660
in the straight pose.

74
00:03:42,660 --> 00:03:46,130
If you raise the one of your
leg you will automatically

75
00:03:46,130 --> 00:03:49,690
shift your weight towards the other one.

76
00:03:49,690 --> 00:03:51,990
This way you will keep balance.

77
00:03:51,990 --> 00:03:55,180
And we can clearly see that
on the reference poses.

78
00:03:55,180 --> 00:03:58,380
Our character has turned
to its right side.

79
00:03:58,380 --> 00:04:01,380
His whole chest is slightly shifting

80
00:04:01,380 --> 00:04:04,320
to be right under his front leg.

81
00:04:04,320 --> 00:04:08,420
This way his center of mass
is aligned with the front leg

82
00:04:08,420 --> 00:04:11,590
is aligned with these contact points.

83
00:04:11,590 --> 00:04:14,930
If we were to see our
character from beneath,

84
00:04:14,930 --> 00:04:17,220
we can see that the three contact points

85
00:04:17,220 --> 00:04:22,080
the three legs contacting the
ground are shaping a triangle.

86
00:04:22,080 --> 00:04:24,880
And the center of mass of our character

87
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:28,270
is more or less centered
with this triangle.

88
00:04:28,270 --> 00:04:31,230
This way our characters looks balanced.

89
00:04:31,230 --> 00:04:33,230
And this is a very important thing

90
00:04:33,230 --> 00:04:36,200
when you are doing these
kind of idle poses.

91
00:04:36,200 --> 00:04:40,650
Since there is no more
inertia like motion forward

92
00:04:40,650 --> 00:04:44,060
as in the run cycle, you
need to make your character

93
00:04:44,060 --> 00:04:46,578
look in balance on each pose.

94
00:04:46,578 --> 00:04:50,020
The other very important
thing to do is to twist

95
00:04:50,020 --> 00:04:52,760
the character to while the contact point.

96
00:04:52,760 --> 00:04:55,750
Looking at the reference again
we can see that the shoulder

97
00:04:55,750 --> 00:04:59,090
are pointing down towards
the contact point.

98
00:04:59,090 --> 00:05:03,960
And as in most cases you want
to create an opposite twist

99
00:05:03,960 --> 00:05:05,120
with the hips.

100
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:08,570
The cool trick to remember
is to create a V shape,

101
00:05:08,570 --> 00:05:11,790
with the line of the shoulder
and the line of the hips.

102
00:05:11,790 --> 00:05:16,330
We then try to give a nice
curved shape to the tail.

103
00:05:16,330 --> 00:05:19,383
And when I feel like the
pose is looking all right,

104
00:05:21,122 --> 00:05:22,550
I will use the tweak controllers

105
00:05:22,550 --> 00:05:25,040
to fix the shape of the front leg.

106
00:05:25,040 --> 00:05:28,750
On the current pose, the front
leg contacting the ground

107
00:05:28,750 --> 00:05:32,170
is bending forward and
it looks a bit weird.

108
00:05:32,170 --> 00:05:36,110
So I'm using this tweaker
controller to fix it.

109
00:05:36,110 --> 00:05:37,700
Checking the rotation first

110
00:05:37,700 --> 00:05:40,513
and then just moving the
joint a bit backward.

111
00:05:42,220 --> 00:05:45,290
As we did before, during
this blocking stage

112
00:05:45,290 --> 00:05:49,433
I'm absolutely not considering
the timing of the animation.

113
00:05:50,680 --> 00:05:53,210
I'm just setting the key poses

114
00:05:53,210 --> 00:05:57,060
or golden poses every five frame.

115
00:05:57,060 --> 00:06:01,330
I've seen people setting those
key poses, every one frame

116
00:06:01,330 --> 00:06:05,280
and then moving them when they
knew their first timing path.

117
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:07,310
For the next two poses,

118
00:06:07,310 --> 00:06:11,603
I want my character to
kind of relax and sit.

119
00:06:12,450 --> 00:06:15,960
On the first pose our
character is transitioning

120
00:06:15,960 --> 00:06:19,760
from the previous pose
watching to his right.

121
00:06:19,760 --> 00:06:22,690
And then I want him to watch to his left

122
00:06:22,690 --> 00:06:26,800
so that we have a cool rotation
and the change in the pose.

123
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:31,120
So, as usual, try to avoid
the twinning in your poses.

124
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:33,620
Think of the silhouette of your character.

125
00:06:33,620 --> 00:06:34,850
Does it read well?

126
00:06:34,850 --> 00:06:37,630
And think of the balance of your character

127
00:06:37,630 --> 00:06:39,550
and his emotional state.

128
00:06:39,550 --> 00:06:43,670
Is he relaxed, curious,
in danger, stressed?

129
00:06:43,670 --> 00:06:47,480
As I'm building the
very first sitting pose,

130
00:06:47,480 --> 00:06:51,340
I will kind of squash a
bit the character backward.

131
00:06:51,340 --> 00:06:54,110
So I'm watching references from the video

132
00:06:54,110 --> 00:06:58,090
I've linked in the documentation,
to check the curvature

133
00:06:58,090 --> 00:07:00,490
of the body of the character, for example.

134
00:07:00,490 --> 00:07:03,100
So I'm using both rotation

135
00:07:03,100 --> 00:07:06,010
and location of the different controller.

136
00:07:06,010 --> 00:07:08,680
Don't hesitate to move the controllers.

137
00:07:08,680 --> 00:07:12,380
A lot of people, especially
beginners, tend to use

138
00:07:12,380 --> 00:07:15,469
only rotation, especially
for the spine bone

139
00:07:15,469 --> 00:07:19,530
or the arm bone when
using forward kinematic.

140
00:07:19,530 --> 00:07:23,567
And a lot of rig doesn't
allow to move the joint,

141
00:07:23,567 --> 00:07:26,300
using the location channels.

142
00:07:26,300 --> 00:07:30,530
While this behavior can
be physically correct

143
00:07:30,530 --> 00:07:33,410
because you can't really move your bone

144
00:07:33,410 --> 00:07:35,400
you can only rotate them,

145
00:07:35,400 --> 00:07:39,200
animation wise it's not
necessarily relevant.

146
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:42,910
Because unless you have a
rig that perfectly simulate

147
00:07:42,910 --> 00:07:45,990
the physical behavior of your character,

148
00:07:45,990 --> 00:07:48,970
with the bones, the fat and everything,

149
00:07:48,970 --> 00:07:51,200
you may not get an interesting shape

150
00:07:51,200 --> 00:07:54,310
or a believable shape of
the body of your character

151
00:07:54,310 --> 00:07:56,720
by only rotating the controllers.

152
00:07:56,720 --> 00:07:59,860
Especially with this
kind of fluffy character.

153
00:07:59,860 --> 00:08:03,060
Because you're not currently
animating it's skeleton

154
00:08:03,060 --> 00:08:06,850
you're animating everything
from the skeleton,

155
00:08:06,850 --> 00:08:10,100
the muscles and the bones and the fur.

156
00:08:10,100 --> 00:08:13,660
So as usual, think of the
shape of your character,

157
00:08:13,660 --> 00:08:15,470
think of its silhouette,

158
00:08:15,470 --> 00:08:18,550
and think of what you want to communicate.

159
00:08:18,550 --> 00:08:22,330
Here, I want him to be
chilling on its back leg.

160
00:08:22,330 --> 00:08:24,610
So I'm compressing him a bit.

161
00:08:24,610 --> 00:08:27,610
A reminder, don't forget to set your keys

162
00:08:27,610 --> 00:08:29,650
to constant interpolation,

163
00:08:29,650 --> 00:08:33,140
and don't forget to key
your whole character

164
00:08:33,140 --> 00:08:37,240
to avoid foot sliding and
all this kind of shenanigans.

165
00:08:37,240 --> 00:08:40,540
For the third pose, I
want my character to be

166
00:08:40,540 --> 00:08:44,374
kind of curious to what's
happening in his environment.

167
00:08:44,374 --> 00:08:49,140
So I will turn him the other
side so that we have contrast

168
00:08:49,140 --> 00:08:52,780
between the previous
pose and the current one.

169
00:08:52,780 --> 00:08:56,990
One of the key component of
this next pose is curiosity.

170
00:08:56,990 --> 00:09:00,640
I want the character to be
smelling the air around him,

171
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:03,770
as if something was
catching his attention.

172
00:09:03,770 --> 00:09:08,620
This is why I will give to
his body a more extended pose.

173
00:09:08,620 --> 00:09:12,600
He's pulling his head
apart to smell the air.

174
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:17,600
His body is kind of stretched
or pulled by his curiosity.

175
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:22,120
And since the pose is
slightly bending forward,

176
00:09:22,120 --> 00:09:24,600
I've laid the tail backward

177
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:27,120
so that the character is balanced.

178
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:31,110
There is more weight of his
head forward and the tail

179
00:09:31,110 --> 00:09:35,240
is counterbalancing the
weight of the head backward.

180
00:09:35,240 --> 00:09:38,380
From my experience an unbalanced pose

181
00:09:38,380 --> 00:09:39,750
doesn't look right at all.

182
00:09:39,750 --> 00:09:42,280
So, before being appealing,

183
00:09:42,280 --> 00:09:44,910
I feel like a pose must be balanced.

184
00:09:44,910 --> 00:09:47,980
Like, we can feel that the
character is well grounded

185
00:09:47,980 --> 00:09:50,030
and it won't be falling down.

186
00:09:50,030 --> 00:09:54,450
So when creating your pose,
think first of the goal

187
00:09:54,450 --> 00:09:58,060
of your character, the purpose
of the pose, his feeling.

188
00:09:58,060 --> 00:10:00,770
Then, think of the appeal of the pose,

189
00:10:00,770 --> 00:10:02,940
the silhouette, et cetera.

190
00:10:02,940 --> 00:10:07,250
And for any still pose or
pose with very slight motion

191
00:10:07,250 --> 00:10:09,880
where there is not that much inertia,

192
00:10:09,880 --> 00:10:12,930
always think to balance your character.

193
00:10:12,930 --> 00:10:16,180
As I'm getting close to the pose I want,

194
00:10:16,180 --> 00:10:19,270
I can't think to fix the secondary shape

195
00:10:19,270 --> 00:10:22,420
like the elbow orientation,
the knee orientation

196
00:10:22,420 --> 00:10:24,260
and all this kind of stuff.

197
00:10:24,260 --> 00:10:26,710
From there I've made a personal choice.

198
00:10:26,710 --> 00:10:30,370
I'm not sure that squirrel
can really rotate their ears.

199
00:10:30,370 --> 00:10:32,610
Watching the reference, it seems that

200
00:10:32,610 --> 00:10:35,170
there is a slight rotation of the ears.

201
00:10:35,170 --> 00:10:39,010
And watching other video I
can see a bit of rotation,

202
00:10:39,010 --> 00:10:42,680
but I'm not sure how much
they can rotate their ears.

203
00:10:42,680 --> 00:10:47,670
But the ears are a fantastic
feature to communicate emotion,

204
00:10:47,670 --> 00:10:49,730
to communicate curiosity.

205
00:10:49,730 --> 00:10:52,420
Think of the motion of a cat's ears

206
00:10:52,420 --> 00:10:54,070
when they've heard a noise

207
00:10:54,070 --> 00:10:57,830
their ear rotates almost 180 degrees.

208
00:10:57,830 --> 00:11:02,210
They can show also fear,
aggressivity, et cetera.

209
00:11:02,210 --> 00:11:05,410
So I'm perfectly fine
if this motion is wrong

210
00:11:05,410 --> 00:11:10,270
because I'm not here to
reproduce a realistic motion.

211
00:11:10,270 --> 00:11:14,520
I'm here to give life to this
character through emotions.

212
00:11:14,520 --> 00:11:17,050
I feel like, the pose
look believable enough.

213
00:11:17,050 --> 00:11:19,770
Here I'm starting to work on the next pose

214
00:11:19,770 --> 00:11:22,470
and at first I also made a pose

215
00:11:22,470 --> 00:11:25,230
where the character was
staying on his back legs.

216
00:11:25,230 --> 00:11:28,700
But it was way too similar
to the current pose,

217
00:11:28,700 --> 00:11:31,480
so in the end, I've modified this pose.

218
00:11:31,480 --> 00:11:34,480
I wanted the character to feel surprised

219
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:37,100
by some kind of noise or whatever,

220
00:11:37,100 --> 00:11:39,010
and scared at the same time.

221
00:11:39,010 --> 00:11:41,010
We will jump directly to the next pose

222
00:11:41,010 --> 00:11:45,180
and then we will see how I
reworked the current one.

223
00:11:45,180 --> 00:11:47,370
Since the next pose is the last one

224
00:11:47,370 --> 00:11:50,740
before our character run
again, I have duplicated

225
00:11:50,740 --> 00:11:54,453
all the key frame of the run
cycle and them onto frame 35.

226
00:11:55,448 --> 00:11:59,110
I will also duplicate
the last route motion key

227
00:11:59,110 --> 00:12:02,360
and put it on the first
one of the second cycle.

228
00:12:02,360 --> 00:12:06,520
This way I don't get root
motion on the second cycle.

229
00:12:06,520 --> 00:12:09,630
We will get rid of the
root motion in the end,

230
00:12:09,630 --> 00:12:12,580
but it's important to have
it, for the transition

231
00:12:12,580 --> 00:12:15,960
between the run cycle and
the first pose of the idle.

232
00:12:15,960 --> 00:12:19,370
Here, I'm creating the anticipation pose.

233
00:12:19,370 --> 00:12:22,270
The next video will be a
more in depth explanation

234
00:12:22,270 --> 00:12:25,450
of anticipation, but
basically it's the moment

235
00:12:25,450 --> 00:12:28,350
where the character is compressing himself

236
00:12:28,350 --> 00:12:32,560
to gather energy before jumping
forward into the run cycle.

237
00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:35,200
So I flatten the foot on the ground

238
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:37,160
so that he's very stable.

239
00:12:37,160 --> 00:12:41,280
I'm pushing the chest
backward and the hips forward

240
00:12:41,280 --> 00:12:44,260
to compress the torso as much as possible.

241
00:12:44,260 --> 00:12:47,260
And I'm also pushing the head inward.

242
00:12:47,260 --> 00:12:49,200
It's like squashing a spring

243
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:51,700
before releasing to make it jump.

244
00:12:51,700 --> 00:12:55,090
I'm shaping the tail into
a knock because I know

245
00:12:55,090 --> 00:12:59,530
that when he will be jumping
he will whip the tail downward.

246
00:12:59,530 --> 00:13:02,250
So I'm kind of shaping the body

247
00:13:02,250 --> 00:13:06,280
the opposite way it will
react on the next pose.

248
00:13:06,280 --> 00:13:08,220
I'm compressing it a lot

249
00:13:08,220 --> 00:13:12,650
while it will be stretched
When the character is jumping.

250
00:13:12,650 --> 00:13:16,810
As explained before I'm
revising the previous pose

251
00:13:16,810 --> 00:13:19,850
before the anticipation
because I wasn't happy

252
00:13:19,850 --> 00:13:24,350
with him staying on his back
legs while I wanted him to be

253
00:13:24,350 --> 00:13:27,980
kind of scared by some
noise, or something,

254
00:13:27,980 --> 00:13:31,110
just before he decide to run away.

255
00:13:31,110 --> 00:13:35,590
So I want the squirrel to be
well-grounded on his four legs.

256
00:13:35,590 --> 00:13:38,880
Slightly closer to the
ground ready to jump

257
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:43,880
and with the ears, head and
torso pointing toward the noise.

258
00:13:43,890 --> 00:13:46,250
The tail is counterbalancing the pose

259
00:13:46,250 --> 00:13:49,290
creating a nice curve of the whole body.

260
00:13:49,290 --> 00:13:52,660
Again, I'm making sure that
the character is well-balanced

261
00:13:52,660 --> 00:13:57,190
that's why I moving the right
front leg a bit on the side.

262
00:13:57,190 --> 00:13:59,790
As explained before, as any art form

263
00:13:59,790 --> 00:14:03,380
don't hesitate to try to
improve your animation.

264
00:14:03,380 --> 00:14:06,480
Revise them, change your mind, et cetera.

265
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:09,460
If you are not convinced
about what you are doing,

266
00:14:09,460 --> 00:14:10,610
then change it.

267
00:14:10,610 --> 00:14:13,560
If you don't feel like you're
communicating anything,

268
00:14:13,560 --> 00:14:14,600
change it.

269
00:14:14,600 --> 00:14:16,890
If it's boring, change it.

270
00:14:16,890 --> 00:14:18,690
But if you can't figure why,

271
00:14:18,690 --> 00:14:21,890
don't hesitate to ask anybody around you.

272
00:14:21,890 --> 00:14:24,450
One of the cool thing
about animation is that

273
00:14:24,450 --> 00:14:27,680
most of the people connect with animation.

274
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:30,500
And while your mother might not be able

275
00:14:30,500 --> 00:14:33,870
to tell you what you have to
do to improve your animation,

276
00:14:33,870 --> 00:14:38,340
she might point out things
that looks weird to her.

277
00:14:38,340 --> 00:14:41,050
Or what she doesn't like
about your animation.

278
00:14:41,050 --> 00:14:44,580
And then you can make
the choice to modify it,

279
00:14:44,580 --> 00:14:48,750
or it can put you on the way
to improve the animation.

280
00:14:48,750 --> 00:14:51,600
And if you know any professional animator

281
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:54,560
that can give you
feedback, don't hesitate.

282
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:58,753
Or put your animation on
forums, that's very important.
