00:00:00,130 --> 00:00:00,963
- [Teacher] In this video,

2
00:00:00,963 --> 00:00:03,620
we will start to blocking our animation

3
00:00:03,620 --> 00:00:05,740
using the extreme poses.

4
00:00:05,740 --> 00:00:09,320
We have a spot and
define on the reference.

5
00:00:09,320 --> 00:00:12,520
As we did when we were animating
the squirrel character,

6
00:00:12,520 --> 00:00:16,430
I will create those key
poses every five frames.

7
00:00:16,430 --> 00:00:20,270
So for the time being, we
don't care about timing at all.

8
00:00:20,270 --> 00:00:23,240
And to make sure that I
have no sliding controllers,

9
00:00:23,240 --> 00:00:25,760
I will insert the key
frame on all controllers

10
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:29,130
for both the character
and the punching bag.

11
00:00:29,130 --> 00:00:32,450
Since our character will
be doing a lot of footwork,

12
00:00:32,450 --> 00:00:35,780
and that generally the
knees align with the foot

13
00:00:35,780 --> 00:00:37,140
in the rig properties,

14
00:00:37,140 --> 00:00:40,380
I will make sure that the
leg parent is set to one.

15
00:00:40,380 --> 00:00:44,240
Meaning that the pole target
is now following the foot.

16
00:00:44,240 --> 00:00:47,520
And as we rotate the feet,
the knee will follow.

17
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:50,600
So let's now build our first pose;

18
00:00:50,600 --> 00:00:52,010
the idle pose.

19
00:00:52,010 --> 00:00:55,200
The right leg or back leg
is open to the outside,

20
00:00:55,200 --> 00:00:58,750
meaning that the foot
is rotated to the right.

21
00:00:58,750 --> 00:01:01,300
The weight of the character is supporting

22
00:01:01,300 --> 00:01:02,950
mostly by this leg.

23
00:01:02,950 --> 00:01:06,110
So I'm pushing the center
of gravity backward

24
00:01:06,110 --> 00:01:07,800
and onto the right leg.

25
00:01:07,800 --> 00:01:11,110
If we watch the reference and
look at the line affection,

26
00:01:11,110 --> 00:01:13,200
we can see that the whole body

27
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:15,030
is slightly leaning forward,

28
00:01:15,030 --> 00:01:18,090
creating a nice C curve forward

29
00:01:18,090 --> 00:01:20,850
from the supporting foot to the head.

30
00:01:20,850 --> 00:01:23,370
Generally the front leg or left leg

31
00:01:23,370 --> 00:01:25,810
is not supporting that much weight.

32
00:01:25,810 --> 00:01:27,900
and the character is supposed to be

33
00:01:27,900 --> 00:01:29,520
on the tip of his toes.

34
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:31,770
You will often see muay Thai fighter

35
00:01:31,770 --> 00:01:34,390
making slight bounce with the front leg.

36
00:01:34,390 --> 00:01:37,530
It's a way to input rhythm into the fight

37
00:01:37,530 --> 00:01:39,880
and they keep their front leg ready

38
00:01:39,880 --> 00:01:43,330
to block any kick using their left shin.

39
00:01:43,330 --> 00:01:44,780
When posing the arms,

40
00:01:44,780 --> 00:01:47,740
don't forget that you
can't rotate your elbow

41
00:01:47,740 --> 00:01:50,330
in any other axis then the Z-axis

42
00:01:50,330 --> 00:01:53,030
and that the arm bone can't rotate upward

43
00:01:53,030 --> 00:01:55,400
than the line made by the shoulders.

44
00:01:55,400 --> 00:01:59,200
So it's super important to
currently pose the shoulders.

45
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:01,080
I see too many beginners

46
00:02:01,080 --> 00:02:02,950
not playing with the shoulder controller

47
00:02:02,950 --> 00:02:04,930
while they are very important

48
00:02:04,930 --> 00:02:08,170
and critically influence the
silhouette of your character.

49
00:02:08,170 --> 00:02:10,770
Now ask yourself, why on the reference,

50
00:02:10,770 --> 00:02:13,300
the character have the shoulders so high?

51
00:02:13,300 --> 00:02:17,210
We are not here to only
answers mechanical properties

52
00:02:17,210 --> 00:02:21,270
of the body, but also
the purpose of the pose.

53
00:02:21,270 --> 00:02:24,190
Again, as explained in
the previous chapter,

54
00:02:24,190 --> 00:02:27,940
if you give a clear goal
to the current pose,

55
00:02:27,940 --> 00:02:31,140
it will communicate the
will of the character.

56
00:02:31,140 --> 00:02:33,150
And as soon as you do that,

57
00:02:33,150 --> 00:02:35,500
you're giving life to your character.

58
00:02:35,500 --> 00:02:38,690
In muay Thai and in boxing in general,

59
00:02:38,690 --> 00:02:42,070
shoulder are raised a
lot to protect the head

60
00:02:42,070 --> 00:02:44,950
of the character, especially the chin,

61
00:02:44,950 --> 00:02:49,670
because a shot in the chin
can knock you out instantly.

62
00:02:49,670 --> 00:02:53,230
If you were to animate
some beginner in boxing,

63
00:02:53,230 --> 00:02:55,910
maybe you should drop the shoulders

64
00:02:55,910 --> 00:02:59,980
so that you communicate a
big mistake boxing wise.

65
00:02:59,980 --> 00:03:03,130
Here I want my character to show mastery

66
00:03:03,130 --> 00:03:05,110
in the art of boxing.

67
00:03:05,110 --> 00:03:07,900
So I will try to mimic the reference pose

68
00:03:07,900 --> 00:03:09,660
and even push it more;

69
00:03:09,660 --> 00:03:12,640
pushing the head deep into the shoulders.

70
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:16,450
As usual, the step between
a good pose and a great pose

71
00:03:16,450 --> 00:03:19,730
is pretty long and it's
about a lot of tweaking.

72
00:03:19,730 --> 00:03:23,090
But why it might be more
natural to have open hands

73
00:03:23,090 --> 00:03:25,680
whenever you're not wearing gloves?

74
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:27,240
Especially in muay Thai,

75
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:29,820
where you can catch your opponent

76
00:03:29,820 --> 00:03:31,210
and go into the clinch,

77
00:03:31,210 --> 00:03:34,020
I've decided to close the left hand

78
00:03:34,020 --> 00:03:38,450
because both my hand were
posed a bit the same way,

79
00:03:38,450 --> 00:03:40,610
and I had some twinning in the post

80
00:03:40,610 --> 00:03:43,200
and it didn't look that interesting.

81
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:47,210
So I will close the fist
and I will slide the scale,

82
00:03:47,210 --> 00:03:50,980
the palm fingers on the local X axis

83
00:03:50,980 --> 00:03:53,070
to make them slightly larger

84
00:03:53,070 --> 00:03:56,210
as if the fist was a bit squashed

85
00:03:56,210 --> 00:03:58,620
by the pressure of the closing hand.

86
00:03:58,620 --> 00:04:01,350
Don't forget that you can
refer back to the video

87
00:04:01,350 --> 00:04:02,993
about posing the hands.

88
00:04:03,830 --> 00:04:06,030
Don't forget to pose
the neck and the head,

89
00:04:06,030 --> 00:04:08,430
but don't over-rotate those controllers.

90
00:04:08,430 --> 00:04:11,730
And as a final touch, you
can use the face controller

91
00:04:11,730 --> 00:04:13,270
to shape a bit the eyes.

92
00:04:13,270 --> 00:04:16,440
Now our character is
ready to kick some ass.

93
00:04:16,440 --> 00:04:20,810
So don't forget to rotate
a lot around your character

94
00:04:20,810 --> 00:04:23,130
to check if the center of gravity

95
00:04:23,130 --> 00:04:26,570
is properly aligned and
your character, balanced.

96
00:04:26,570 --> 00:04:29,040
And don't forget to check
the overall silhouette

97
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:31,470
of the character of from different angles.

98
00:04:31,470 --> 00:04:33,980
Again, remember that you can refer to the

99
00:04:33,980 --> 00:04:36,600
previous chapter to
double-check the method

100
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:38,210
to get a good pose.

101
00:04:38,210 --> 00:04:41,110
Before you start posing the jab pose,

102
00:04:41,110 --> 00:04:43,310
double check the video reference.

103
00:04:43,310 --> 00:04:46,260
You can see that both
feet are moving forward

104
00:04:46,260 --> 00:04:47,580
during this punch.

105
00:04:47,580 --> 00:04:50,070
Beyond rotating the feet, don't forget

106
00:04:50,070 --> 00:04:53,170
to change their rotation
while posing the jab.

107
00:04:53,170 --> 00:04:56,700
So the first thing I will do
is to move the feet forward.

108
00:04:56,700 --> 00:04:59,380
Now, as we watch carefully the reference,

109
00:04:59,380 --> 00:05:03,730
we can see that the weight is
shifting onto the front feet

110
00:05:03,730 --> 00:05:07,390
and the whole chest is
twisting to the right.

111
00:05:07,390 --> 00:05:09,170
And so does the feet.

112
00:05:09,170 --> 00:05:12,720
So, since we have weight
on the front foot,

113
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:14,690
I will flatten it a bit,

114
00:05:14,690 --> 00:05:18,150
and then I will raise the back foot

115
00:05:18,150 --> 00:05:20,040
using the heel controller.

116
00:05:20,040 --> 00:05:22,750
And then we would rotate
both feet to the right.

117
00:05:22,750 --> 00:05:26,090
But when you punch left,
your feet turns to the right.

118
00:05:26,090 --> 00:05:29,890
When you punch with the right,
your feet turn to the left.

119
00:05:29,890 --> 00:05:32,740
But I haven't pushed this pose too much

120
00:05:32,740 --> 00:05:35,350
because the next punch will also be

121
00:05:35,350 --> 00:05:37,660
a straight punch forward.

122
00:05:37,660 --> 00:05:39,990
And if we go too much forward

123
00:05:39,990 --> 00:05:42,890
and too much into a horizontal pose

124
00:05:42,890 --> 00:05:46,610
for this initial punch,
we will lose the contrast

125
00:05:46,610 --> 00:05:48,470
with the next one.

126
00:05:48,470 --> 00:05:51,110
And so our pose may look good,

127
00:05:51,110 --> 00:05:55,910
but the animation won't because
it will lack of contrast

128
00:05:55,910 --> 00:05:59,170
between the first pose
and the second pose.

129
00:05:59,170 --> 00:06:00,850
Another thing I'm doing though,

130
00:06:00,850 --> 00:06:04,790
is that I'm slightly spreading
the arms of the character.

131
00:06:04,790 --> 00:06:07,270
While it might not be a super good idea

132
00:06:07,270 --> 00:06:08,680
whenever you are boxing,

133
00:06:08,680 --> 00:06:11,460
because you are exposing your chin,

134
00:06:11,460 --> 00:06:15,040
this improve a bit, the
readability of the pose

135
00:06:15,040 --> 00:06:19,220
and it slightly extend
the overall silhouette

136
00:06:19,220 --> 00:06:22,493
of the character when
we follow the shoulders.

137
00:06:25,810 --> 00:06:29,640
Finally, don't forget
that you also have to pose

138
00:06:29,640 --> 00:06:30,810
the punching bag.

139
00:06:30,810 --> 00:06:34,090
Don't push it too far and
don't use that much controller.

140
00:06:34,090 --> 00:06:36,680
Moving all the controllers
won't necessarily

141
00:06:36,680 --> 00:06:37,840
give you better result.

142
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:41,130
While we do agree that
everything is connected

143
00:06:41,130 --> 00:06:44,280
so everything should be
moving; keep it simple.

144
00:06:44,280 --> 00:06:47,240
Your audience will mainly
focus on the character.

145
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:49,520
So you want to avoid any glitches

146
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:52,410
on the bag by moving too much controller

147
00:06:52,410 --> 00:06:53,400
at the same time.

148
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:56,360
Once done, don't forget to
key all your controllers

149
00:06:56,360 --> 00:06:58,420
and don't forget to add subtle

150
00:06:58,420 --> 00:07:00,690
rotation details to the feet.

151
00:07:00,690 --> 00:07:02,100
When we watch the reference,

152
00:07:02,100 --> 00:07:05,490
we can see that there is a
subtle tilting during the punch.

153
00:07:05,490 --> 00:07:08,733
Don't forget to add it
during the blocking state.
