00:00:00,110 --> 00:00:02,030
- [Instructor] With our center of gravity

2
00:00:02,030 --> 00:00:03,730
and our feet polished,

3
00:00:03,730 --> 00:00:06,686
it's gonna be way he's
yours to now polish the hips

4
00:00:06,686 --> 00:00:08,110
of the character.

5
00:00:08,110 --> 00:00:10,220
To get rid of any visual noise,

6
00:00:10,220 --> 00:00:14,800
I will ID arms of the
character using the rig UI.

7
00:00:14,800 --> 00:00:17,830
So let's expose the hips rotation curve.

8
00:00:17,830 --> 00:00:21,410
And keep in mind that the
hips can either be pushed

9
00:00:21,410 --> 00:00:25,140
by the supporting leg or
lead the leg, pulling it.

10
00:00:25,140 --> 00:00:28,620
For example, on the
section of the animation,

11
00:00:28,620 --> 00:00:33,020
as the weight is totally
shifting toward the right leg,

12
00:00:33,020 --> 00:00:35,580
the hips will raise toward the right leg,

13
00:00:35,580 --> 00:00:38,310
because they are pushed by the right leg.

14
00:00:38,310 --> 00:00:41,370
And our goal is not to
know which curve to use,

15
00:00:41,370 --> 00:00:44,740
but to figure it out based
on the character motion.

16
00:00:44,740 --> 00:00:46,470
The weight is on the right leg,

17
00:00:46,470 --> 00:00:51,050
so I need to slightly raise
the hips toward the right.

18
00:00:51,050 --> 00:00:52,690
I'm testing different curve.

19
00:00:52,690 --> 00:00:55,020
The Y rotation curve seems to be the one

20
00:00:55,020 --> 00:00:57,320
that will do what I need.

21
00:00:57,320 --> 00:00:59,670
And I tweak this curve rig-wise.

22
00:00:59,670 --> 00:01:02,930
Most of the motion of the
torso of our character

23
00:01:02,930 --> 00:01:06,760
is generated by the torso
root or center of gravity.

24
00:01:06,760 --> 00:01:08,060
So most of the time,

25
00:01:08,060 --> 00:01:11,080
once the center of gravity is polished,

26
00:01:11,080 --> 00:01:14,980
polishing the hips is mostly
smoothing out the curve,

27
00:01:14,980 --> 00:01:19,720
so that we don't get harsh
angles or distorted torso shape.

28
00:01:19,720 --> 00:01:22,320
And then I tend to rotate a little more

29
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:25,000
to chest controller
than the hips controller

30
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,830
As you can see, I'm pushing and pulling

31
00:01:27,830 --> 00:01:29,470
along the way of the curve,

32
00:01:29,470 --> 00:01:32,020
so that I get smoother transition

33
00:01:32,020 --> 00:01:34,050
from one extreme to the other.

34
00:01:34,050 --> 00:01:37,320
On frame 47, I will push down a bit

35
00:01:37,320 --> 00:01:39,190
the Z quaternion curve,

36
00:01:39,190 --> 00:01:43,570
because it will make the hips
to twist a little further

37
00:01:43,570 --> 00:01:45,160
into the punch.

38
00:01:45,160 --> 00:01:48,050
Since the hips are leading the punch,

39
00:01:48,050 --> 00:01:50,300
it's where the energy come from.

40
00:01:50,300 --> 00:01:52,880
We do need just after the impact them

41
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:55,130
to slightly overshoot.

42
00:01:55,130 --> 00:01:58,540
And then I'm realigning the
hips with the rest of the body,

43
00:01:58,540 --> 00:02:02,960
so that I don't get a too distorted trunk.

44
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:07,180
This little push on frame 47
will create a slight overshoot,

45
00:02:07,180 --> 00:02:09,450
and that will better sell the impact,

46
00:02:09,450 --> 00:02:14,360
because we will have a slight
glitch into the hips rotation

47
00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:16,430
just after he hit the bag.

48
00:02:16,430 --> 00:02:19,070
And since the hips are pulling the leg,

49
00:02:19,070 --> 00:02:22,470
I will propagate a bit
the slight overshoot

50
00:02:22,470 --> 00:02:26,640
into the left knee, by
playing with the pull target.

51
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:30,390
We can see the pull target
shifting after frame 47

52
00:02:30,390 --> 00:02:33,270
to the left, but I will
just pull a bit the curve

53
00:02:33,270 --> 00:02:37,830
on frame 50 and 52 to
create a slight overshoot

54
00:02:37,830 --> 00:02:39,210
toward the inside.

55
00:02:39,210 --> 00:02:44,210
As the hips rotate, the
knee is pulled inside,

56
00:02:44,390 --> 00:02:48,210
overshoot a bit, and then
get back into its position

57
00:02:48,210 --> 00:02:49,433
on frame 58.

58
00:02:50,577 --> 00:02:52,820
(air whooshes)

59
00:02:52,820 --> 00:02:56,610
Polishing the chest will be
mostly about making it drag.

60
00:02:56,610 --> 00:02:59,930
A lot of the force in boxing
comes from way you deal

61
00:02:59,930 --> 00:03:01,490
with your center of gravity,

62
00:03:01,490 --> 00:03:04,950
so basically how you move
your feet and your hips.

63
00:03:04,950 --> 00:03:09,030
Having a strong upper body
is really a secondary factor

64
00:03:09,030 --> 00:03:10,640
to the power of your punch.

65
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:12,610
This is why we can make it drag it,

66
00:03:12,610 --> 00:03:15,080
because this is not the primary force

67
00:03:15,080 --> 00:03:17,300
into the punching motion.

68
00:03:17,300 --> 00:03:20,170
The twisting of our character chest is led

69
00:03:20,170 --> 00:03:21,900
by the Z quaternion curve.

70
00:03:21,900 --> 00:03:25,410
So that our character
torso root is twisting

71
00:03:25,410 --> 00:03:28,630
toward the left, I will
make the chest drag

72
00:03:28,630 --> 00:03:32,270
by inputting a bit of delay
into the Z quaternion curve,

73
00:03:32,270 --> 00:03:35,500
meaning that I will
offset any extreme pose,

74
00:03:35,500 --> 00:03:38,700
and I will push the curve
toward its previous value.

75
00:03:38,700 --> 00:03:40,770
This is a very easy
method that you can use

76
00:03:40,770 --> 00:03:43,590
whenever you're trying to
achieve a dragging motion,

77
00:03:43,590 --> 00:03:46,800
whether it's the finger,
a pony tail, or whatever.

78
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:50,000
You just delay the keys of the controller

79
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,660
based on their position in the chain.

80
00:03:52,660 --> 00:03:55,490
The closer they get to
the tip of the chain,

81
00:03:55,490 --> 00:03:58,260
the further you will offset the keys,

82
00:03:58,260 --> 00:04:01,670
and I will apply this
concept to different degrees

83
00:04:01,670 --> 00:04:02,760
for the chest.

84
00:04:02,760 --> 00:04:06,060
The more strength the character
will put into his punch,

85
00:04:06,060 --> 00:04:10,110
meaning that he will contract
all the muscle of his torso,

86
00:04:10,110 --> 00:04:11,800
the tighter will be the dragging.

87
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:16,800
So I may not offset by your
key, every pose of the chest,

88
00:04:17,260 --> 00:04:21,410
but rather have a rise to
previous pose, and then overshoot.

89
00:04:21,410 --> 00:04:24,870
For example, here, I will
push up the Z quaternion curve

90
00:04:24,870 --> 00:04:27,720
on frame 44 and 45,

91
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:31,140
but then I will push it down
to create the overshoot.

92
00:04:31,140 --> 00:04:34,920
Pushing up the curve create
the drags into the twist.

93
00:04:34,920 --> 00:04:37,820
Pushing it down create the overshoot

94
00:04:37,820 --> 00:04:40,770
and sell more power to the hook.

95
00:04:40,770 --> 00:04:42,290
Now you have to be careful

96
00:04:42,290 --> 00:04:45,710
not to smooth out the motion too much.

97
00:04:45,710 --> 00:04:50,190
A good way to input a bit of
texture and impact to the hook

98
00:04:50,190 --> 00:04:52,570
is to use the location of the chest.

99
00:04:52,570 --> 00:04:55,340
As the character is moving up very fast,

100
00:04:55,340 --> 00:04:57,230
I will pull the chest down.

101
00:04:57,230 --> 00:04:59,480
I will squash it onto the hips,

102
00:04:59,480 --> 00:05:01,940
but then as the character hit the bag,

103
00:05:01,940 --> 00:05:04,270
I will slightly pull the chest the back.

104
00:05:04,270 --> 00:05:06,800
So I will make it drag a bit.

105
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:10,160
And just after the impact,
I will push it forward.

106
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:13,360
So basically you move the
chest opposite to the punch,

107
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:16,120
and then you move it toward the punch.

108
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:19,810
It will feels like the chest
of the character is bouncing

109
00:05:19,810 --> 00:05:21,880
due to the impact of the hook.

110
00:05:21,880 --> 00:05:24,490
Don't hesitate to push
this pose further away,

111
00:05:24,490 --> 00:05:26,700
pushing forward over one frame,

112
00:05:26,700 --> 00:05:29,823
and recovering over two or three frames.

113
00:05:30,861 --> 00:05:31,694
(air whooshes)

114
00:05:31,694 --> 00:05:33,260
From there, polishing the neck

115
00:05:33,260 --> 00:05:35,520
and the head is pretty straightforward.

116
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:38,640
I'm using the tweaker bone
at the base of the head

117
00:05:38,640 --> 00:05:40,510
to calculate the motion path.

118
00:05:40,510 --> 00:05:42,920
And from there, I will walk as we did

119
00:05:42,920 --> 00:05:45,636
in the previous segment of this animation.

120
00:05:45,636 --> 00:05:48,800
We are going to make the
neck dragging compound

121
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:49,830
to the chest.

122
00:05:49,830 --> 00:05:52,430
Since the neck is following the rotation

123
00:05:52,430 --> 00:05:55,210
of the chest controller-wise,

124
00:05:55,210 --> 00:05:57,380
the element of work to polish those curve

125
00:05:57,380 --> 00:05:59,940
won't be that big, but just for our eyes,

126
00:05:59,940 --> 00:06:01,540
it will beat the previous pose

127
00:06:01,540 --> 00:06:03,670
by pushing the value of the curve

128
00:06:03,670 --> 00:06:08,000
toward its previous value
or offsetting in in time

129
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,360
by one frame.

130
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:10,690
Then track your arcs.

131
00:06:10,690 --> 00:06:13,390
You can see here, I have a very clean arc

132
00:06:13,390 --> 00:06:15,330
made by the pace of the head.

133
00:06:15,330 --> 00:06:18,390
And since the head comes from the left,

134
00:06:18,390 --> 00:06:21,600
I'm tweaking the value of the curve,

135
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:24,800
so that the head move
a bit more to the left

136
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:27,010
during this transition move.

137
00:06:27,010 --> 00:06:30,660
And then as it hits the next pose,

138
00:06:30,660 --> 00:06:34,220
I will make it overshoot
a bit, one or two frame,

139
00:06:34,220 --> 00:06:36,840
after it hits the extreme pose.

140
00:06:36,840 --> 00:06:39,700
Technically, I don't have that much tricks

141
00:06:39,700 --> 00:06:41,520
to teach you here,

142
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:44,390
but to watch the motion path

143
00:06:44,390 --> 00:06:48,050
and make sure you create
as smooth arc as possible.

144
00:06:48,050 --> 00:06:51,340
It's exactly the same
method as what we did before

145
00:06:51,340 --> 00:06:52,740
for the arms.

146
00:06:52,740 --> 00:06:54,807
We were tracking the elbows,

147
00:06:54,807 --> 00:06:58,940
and then playing with the
rotation curve of the upper arm.

148
00:06:58,940 --> 00:07:02,510
We were modifying the
shape of the motion path.

149
00:07:02,510 --> 00:07:05,870
At no point was I focusing
on the graph (indistinct),

150
00:07:05,870 --> 00:07:09,715
but mostly on the arcs made by the elbow.

151
00:07:09,715 --> 00:07:14,010
At this stage, it's tweaking
each pose frame by frame,

152
00:07:14,010 --> 00:07:17,080
whether you're doing these
for the rough editorial

153
00:07:17,080 --> 00:07:20,860
or directly in the 3D
view port doesn't matter,

154
00:07:20,860 --> 00:07:23,370
but your arcs must be super clean.

155
00:07:23,370 --> 00:07:26,660
For example, here, as
the torso is rotating

156
00:07:26,660 --> 00:07:31,160
toward the right, I will
rotate the neck to the left,

157
00:07:31,160 --> 00:07:32,390
so that it is dragging.

158
00:07:32,390 --> 00:07:33,630
And then after the impact,

159
00:07:33,630 --> 00:07:35,340
I've pushed the neck to the right,

160
00:07:35,340 --> 00:07:37,240
so that I get a nice overshoot

161
00:07:37,240 --> 00:07:40,783
and we feel like the head has
a lot of weight and momentum.

162
00:07:42,100 --> 00:07:44,820
And as I feel up here
with the result here,

163
00:07:44,820 --> 00:07:48,320
I will do exactly the
same thing with the head.

164
00:07:48,320 --> 00:07:51,020
Instead of tracking the base of the neck,

165
00:07:51,020 --> 00:07:55,610
I may track with the top of the
head or the tip of the nose.

166
00:07:55,610 --> 00:07:56,710
From there, you will see

167
00:07:56,710 --> 00:07:59,450
that it's very, very straightforward.

168
00:07:59,450 --> 00:08:00,940
When the head is raising,

169
00:08:00,940 --> 00:08:03,400
I will lower the chin a bit.

170
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:05,140
When the head is getting down,

171
00:08:05,140 --> 00:08:07,360
I will raise the chin a bit.

172
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:09,820
When the head is turning to the right,

173
00:08:09,820 --> 00:08:12,000
I will make the nose drag to the left.

174
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:15,430
So we are repeating the
same method over and over

175
00:08:15,430 --> 00:08:17,530
along the whole animation.

176
00:08:17,530 --> 00:08:20,770
There is just a moment with
the specific controller

177
00:08:20,770 --> 00:08:23,980
where we are going to
break the rules in the way

178
00:08:23,980 --> 00:08:25,430
to create more impact.

179
00:08:25,430 --> 00:08:28,140
If you remember, when we
were watching the reference

180
00:08:28,140 --> 00:08:31,100
of Liam Harrison throwing a big hook,

181
00:08:31,100 --> 00:08:34,520
there is a lot of rotation in
his head during the impact,

182
00:08:34,520 --> 00:08:37,000
and this is what I want to reproduce here.

183
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,500
And they want to get that
into my animation too.

184
00:08:39,500 --> 00:08:41,980
But instead of having
a recoil in the head,

185
00:08:41,980 --> 00:08:44,150
I want to hold during the drag,

186
00:08:44,150 --> 00:08:46,770
and then move it away as fast as possible.

187
00:08:46,770 --> 00:08:49,420
To do so, I will create a little plateau

188
00:08:49,420 --> 00:08:51,580
with the Z quaternion rotation.

189
00:08:51,580 --> 00:08:55,990
This way the head is looking
at the punch, so it dragging.

190
00:08:55,990 --> 00:08:59,140
And on the next frame, I
will push the curve way down,

191
00:08:59,140 --> 00:09:01,240
so that it rotate the opposite way.

192
00:09:01,240 --> 00:09:04,130
And it creates a very
impactful rotation of the head

193
00:09:04,130 --> 00:09:05,400
just after the punch.

194
00:09:05,400 --> 00:09:07,043
From there, I will smooth the curve,

195
00:09:07,043 --> 00:09:10,573
so that the character is out of this pose.

196
00:09:11,750 --> 00:09:14,780
From there, it was all about
adding some extra detail

197
00:09:14,780 --> 00:09:16,490
to the animation of the torso.

198
00:09:16,490 --> 00:09:19,220
First I've checked the pose of the head

199
00:09:19,220 --> 00:09:20,570
from the camera angle.

200
00:09:20,570 --> 00:09:22,680
And then using its location,

201
00:09:22,680 --> 00:09:24,940
so moving the head in space,

202
00:09:24,940 --> 00:09:27,540
I've exaggerated a bit the impact.

203
00:09:27,540 --> 00:09:30,240
Then I've used the tweaker controller

204
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:32,890
to add a very slight
stretching to the head

205
00:09:32,890 --> 00:09:35,930
whenever it's moving super fast in screen

206
00:09:35,930 --> 00:09:37,360
on this specific frame,.

207
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:40,970
As for the arm, this will
fake the motion blur.

208
00:09:40,970 --> 00:09:44,560
Then I will play with the
tweaker controller of the torso.

209
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:45,680
I will select them all,

210
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:49,350
and they will insert a key
frame on every single frame

211
00:09:49,350 --> 00:09:50,210
during the hook

212
00:09:50,210 --> 00:09:52,960
This way, I'm sure that those controller

213
00:09:52,960 --> 00:09:55,670
won't interpolate from
one frame to the other.

214
00:09:55,670 --> 00:09:58,160
And from there, I will
use those controller

215
00:09:58,160 --> 00:09:59,710
for two main reason.

216
00:09:59,710 --> 00:10:03,790
First, I want to slightly
reshape my character,

217
00:10:03,790 --> 00:10:07,080
so that there is not that
much breaks in his silhouette,

218
00:10:07,080 --> 00:10:10,620
and this way, I offer better
support to his line of action,

219
00:10:10,620 --> 00:10:13,210
but I will also use them to create a bit

220
00:10:13,210 --> 00:10:17,210
of a shaking his body
whenever he hit with the hook.

221
00:10:17,210 --> 00:10:19,870
On frame 48, I will
select the tweaker bone

222
00:10:19,870 --> 00:10:24,050
in the middle of the spine
between the hips and the chest,

223
00:10:24,050 --> 00:10:25,850
and I will push it forward.

224
00:10:25,850 --> 00:10:29,580
This is subtle details that
will bring a little more impact

225
00:10:29,580 --> 00:10:31,100
to the current animation

226
00:10:31,100 --> 00:10:34,180
as if the body of the character
was projected forward,

227
00:10:34,180 --> 00:10:36,433
because of the momentum of the strike.
