00:00:00,870 --> 00:00:02,400
- [Instructor] This is the last video

2
00:00:02,400 --> 00:00:05,810
of the run cycle for
our squirrel character,

3
00:00:05,810 --> 00:00:08,000
and it's currently the shortest.

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:11,120
I will just be slightly
reworking the heels

5
00:00:11,120 --> 00:00:12,700
because we need to animate them.

6
00:00:12,700 --> 00:00:13,810
They are important

7
00:00:13,810 --> 00:00:16,620
even if they won't show
that much they appear

8
00:00:16,620 --> 00:00:18,920
so so we need to give them some love.

9
00:00:18,920 --> 00:00:20,370
I'm doing it in two step.

10
00:00:20,370 --> 00:00:24,370
I'm mostly posing the heels
directly in the 3D view port.

11
00:00:24,370 --> 00:00:26,710
I'm not really considering the curves,

12
00:00:26,710 --> 00:00:30,400
I just want a very
slight shaking or wabble

13
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:32,023
just after the impact frame.

14
00:00:32,023 --> 00:00:33,620
This is why I have a big change

15
00:00:33,620 --> 00:00:35,330
between frame zero and frame two.

16
00:00:35,330 --> 00:00:37,810
And then I'm just dragging them a bit

17
00:00:37,810 --> 00:00:40,350
while our character is moving forward.

18
00:00:40,350 --> 00:00:43,210
I will just have a quick
cleanup on the curve

19
00:00:43,210 --> 00:00:47,000
to make sure that I don't
get any jittering motion,

20
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:48,270
just something smooth

21
00:00:48,270 --> 00:00:51,410
But with pretty critical
change in the beginning.

22
00:00:51,410 --> 00:00:54,030
The second thing to
consider is the silhouette

23
00:00:54,030 --> 00:00:55,570
of our character.

24
00:00:55,570 --> 00:00:57,180
As we did for the legs

25
00:00:57,180 --> 00:01:00,320
I will try it from a side
view as much as possible

26
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:02,210
to separate the heels.

27
00:01:02,210 --> 00:01:04,100
This way I'm breaking the tangent

28
00:01:04,100 --> 00:01:05,570
in the shape of their heels.

29
00:01:05,570 --> 00:01:06,640
And we can clearly see

30
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:07,970
that there are two peaks

31
00:01:07,970 --> 00:01:09,610
on the head of our character.

32
00:01:09,610 --> 00:01:11,890
So that they will make sure that frame 12

33
00:01:11,890 --> 00:01:13,596
and frame one are the same

34
00:01:13,596 --> 00:01:16,430
and then I will have
a quick polishing pass

35
00:01:16,430 --> 00:01:18,100
onto those curves.

36
00:01:18,100 --> 00:01:20,750
I'm just revising a bit
the flow of the curve,

37
00:01:20,750 --> 00:01:23,750
I'm not even really
focusing on what's happening

38
00:01:23,750 --> 00:01:25,080
in the freely huge.

39
00:01:25,080 --> 00:01:26,800
Is just to add the smooth motion

40
00:01:26,800 --> 00:01:30,030
avoid any jitter or stuff like that.

41
00:01:30,030 --> 00:01:31,730
This is not a critical step

42
00:01:31,730 --> 00:01:35,230
and I could have left
the curve as they were.

43
00:01:35,230 --> 00:01:38,020
As usual it's a matter of time and energy

44
00:01:38,020 --> 00:01:40,380
you want to spend onto an animation.

45
00:01:40,380 --> 00:01:43,430
The last thing I will do
is to animate the eyes.

46
00:01:43,430 --> 00:01:46,420
So I won't make the eyes blinking

47
00:01:46,420 --> 00:01:48,780
and you should avoid that on the cycle

48
00:01:48,780 --> 00:01:51,260
because since the cycle is very shot

49
00:01:51,260 --> 00:01:53,837
your character eyes will blinking a lot

50
00:01:53,837 --> 00:01:56,480
and it will really looks weird than CG.

51
00:01:56,480 --> 00:01:59,790
What I've done here is
just to slightly lower

52
00:01:59,790 --> 00:02:02,020
the eye controller on impact.

53
00:02:02,020 --> 00:02:03,400
It's super subtle,

54
00:02:03,400 --> 00:02:07,720
but it's just about having
the whole body connected.

55
00:02:07,720 --> 00:02:11,060
So when the body is impacting the ground

56
00:02:11,060 --> 00:02:14,340
even the eyes or the eyebrow are reacting.

57
00:02:14,340 --> 00:02:16,780
It might not show that much in the end

58
00:02:16,780 --> 00:02:19,250
but you can definitely tell yourself

59
00:02:19,250 --> 00:02:23,350
now that you've been working
this animation from a to Z.

60
00:02:23,350 --> 00:02:26,170
Though you are happy
with the result or not,

61
00:02:26,170 --> 00:02:28,830
proud of it and do another animation

62
00:02:28,830 --> 00:02:30,250
and this is all you will get,

63
00:02:30,250 --> 00:02:31,950
good finish animation

64
00:02:31,950 --> 00:02:33,153
and start another one.
