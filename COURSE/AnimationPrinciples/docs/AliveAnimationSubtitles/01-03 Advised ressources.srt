1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,100
- [Instructor] Before
we jump into animation,

2
00:00:02,100 --> 00:00:04,150
I'd like to show you my table.

3
00:00:04,150 --> 00:00:06,170
It's made of some exotic wood

4
00:00:06,170 --> 00:00:08,090
and it's very useful too.

5
00:00:08,090 --> 00:00:10,200
Nope, it's not a course about table

6
00:00:10,200 --> 00:00:12,610
but I'd like to show you some resources

7
00:00:12,610 --> 00:00:13,920
that could be useful.

8
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:18,020
The first one is obviously
"The Animator's Survival Kit"

9
00:00:18,020 --> 00:00:19,520
by Richard Williams.

10
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:20,750
This is a classic.

11
00:00:20,750 --> 00:00:24,670
I guess all the animators have
this book in their shelves,

12
00:00:24,670 --> 00:00:27,540
and to be perfectly
honest, it doesn't get old.

13
00:00:27,540 --> 00:00:29,500
But you will find in there tons

14
00:00:29,500 --> 00:00:32,940
of lesson about the
principles of animation

15
00:00:32,940 --> 00:00:36,400
and so many drawings that
are still used to this date

16
00:00:36,400 --> 00:00:38,250
to teach animation.

17
00:00:38,250 --> 00:00:40,830
It also comes with a lot of stories

18
00:00:40,830 --> 00:00:43,790
about animation a few decades ago.

19
00:00:43,790 --> 00:00:45,690
But definitely, a must-have.

20
00:00:45,690 --> 00:00:47,250
The next book, which is one

21
00:00:47,250 --> 00:00:51,560
of my favorite is "Drawn to
Life" by Walt Stanchfield.

22
00:00:51,560 --> 00:00:53,980
This is a book that was recommended to me

23
00:00:53,980 --> 00:00:57,150
by my animation mentor, Jeremy Collins,

24
00:00:57,150 --> 00:01:00,330
and while it's mostly focused on drawing,

25
00:01:00,330 --> 00:01:03,940
everything in there is
appliable to animation,

26
00:01:03,940 --> 00:01:06,620
especially when it comes to staging

27
00:01:06,620 --> 00:01:08,860
and creating great poses.

28
00:01:08,860 --> 00:01:12,800
The last book I'd like
to advise is a classic.

29
00:01:12,800 --> 00:01:14,470
It's "The Illusion of Life"

30
00:01:14,470 --> 00:01:17,200
from Frank Thomas and Ollie Johnston.

31
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:19,560
Beyond the educational content,

32
00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:22,270
it's fascinating to learn stories

33
00:01:22,270 --> 00:01:26,990
about Disney, the studio that
has almost created animation.

34
00:01:26,990 --> 00:01:29,200
While you don't need those book,

35
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:31,110
I do believe that having them

36
00:01:31,110 --> 00:01:33,610
and reading them will really help you

37
00:01:33,610 --> 00:01:36,240
to dive into the art of animation.

38
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:40,170
There are tons of quality book
about animation and drawing,

39
00:01:40,170 --> 00:01:42,800
and it's always good to get a step back

40
00:01:42,800 --> 00:01:46,350
from the screen and take
a good book and chill.

41
00:01:46,350 --> 00:01:49,230
I'd like to recommend
you also a YouTube video

42
00:01:49,230 --> 00:01:53,960
by Alan Becker about the
12 principles of animation.

43
00:01:53,960 --> 00:01:56,500
It has more than eight million of views,

44
00:01:56,500 --> 00:02:00,390
and this is definitely because
it's one of the best video

45
00:02:00,390 --> 00:02:03,470
about the 12 principle of animation.

46
00:02:03,470 --> 00:02:07,320
It's short, super well
illustrated and explained.

47
00:02:07,320 --> 00:02:08,610
A must-watch.

48
00:02:08,610 --> 00:02:12,800
And finally, I truly advise
you to use SyncSketch.

49
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:16,090
SyncSketch is an online media player

50
00:02:16,090 --> 00:02:20,160
that allows you to read
almost every video format,

51
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:22,680
and allows you to draw on screen,

52
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:26,840
to leave notes and to create
reviews and share them.

53
00:02:26,840 --> 00:02:30,670
Definitely one of the best
platform to share your reviews

54
00:02:30,670 --> 00:02:34,056
or get feedback from other animators.

55
00:02:34,056 --> 00:02:35,960
This is the tool I use every day

56
00:02:35,960 --> 00:02:37,620
for all my reviews,

57
00:02:37,620 --> 00:02:39,430
and also in this course

58
00:02:39,430 --> 00:02:42,660
whenever I'm analyzing any reference.

59
00:02:42,660 --> 00:02:45,610
If you're looking for an offline solution,

60
00:02:45,610 --> 00:02:48,350
I advise you Keyframe Pro media player.

61
00:02:48,350 --> 00:02:50,740
You can get a free version of it.

62
00:02:50,740 --> 00:02:53,280
There is also a paid version of it

63
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:55,189
with additional functionalities,

64
00:02:55,189 --> 00:02:58,423
but personally, I prefer
to use SyncSketch.
