00:00:00,828 --> 00:00:02,060
- [Instructor] This is the final video

2
00:00:02,060 --> 00:00:04,400
of this climbing animation.

3
00:00:04,400 --> 00:00:07,560
It is now time to polish our tail motion,

4
00:00:07,560 --> 00:00:10,530
so I will start with the root of the tail.

5
00:00:10,530 --> 00:00:13,230
There are a couple things
you have to think of.

6
00:00:13,230 --> 00:00:17,300
First of all, our character
is climbing vertically.

7
00:00:17,300 --> 00:00:18,920
It's the tail has weight,

8
00:00:18,920 --> 00:00:21,690
it should be hanging a bit downward.

9
00:00:21,690 --> 00:00:25,850
Plus, since our character
has a vertical momentum.

10
00:00:25,850 --> 00:00:29,410
The tail should also drag
in the opposite direction.

11
00:00:29,410 --> 00:00:33,590
As usual, I'm starting to
work on the X rotation curve.

12
00:00:33,590 --> 00:00:37,090
The idea is to avoid
any big flapping motion

13
00:00:37,090 --> 00:00:40,330
because of the twin formation
we have seen before.

14
00:00:40,330 --> 00:00:43,340
The root of the tail is moving in reaction

15
00:00:43,340 --> 00:00:45,070
of the hips motion.

16
00:00:45,070 --> 00:00:47,680
As the hips are raising from frame zero to

17
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:51,430
frame five to tail is going
the opposite direction

18
00:00:51,430 --> 00:00:53,680
with one frame of delay.

19
00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:56,100
From there I just need
to polish the curve,

20
00:00:56,100 --> 00:00:59,580
make sure that the frame
10 and zero on the same

21
00:00:59,580 --> 00:01:02,310
and that I get a smooth transition

22
00:01:02,310 --> 00:01:05,490
between frame eight to frame 10.

23
00:01:05,490 --> 00:01:08,160
This nice change in the curve shape

24
00:01:08,160 --> 00:01:10,820
from frame one to frame three,

25
00:01:10,820 --> 00:01:14,220
supports the drastic
change in the hips pose

26
00:01:14,220 --> 00:01:16,890
while the character is pushing.

27
00:01:16,890 --> 00:01:20,000
From there I will work on the next joint

28
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:23,070
in reaction from the first joint.

29
00:01:23,070 --> 00:01:26,000
So you can see that my
curve is pretty noisy

30
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:29,100
because I've tried to make this animation

31
00:01:29,100 --> 00:01:31,190
during the blocking stage.

32
00:01:31,190 --> 00:01:33,490
So don't be afraid to destroy everything

33
00:01:33,490 --> 00:01:35,610
and reshape the motion.

34
00:01:35,610 --> 00:01:38,550
In the end the curve of the second joint

35
00:01:38,550 --> 00:01:42,420
will look like the curve
of the first joint.

36
00:01:42,420 --> 00:01:45,310
But with a bit of delay maybe one frame

37
00:01:45,310 --> 00:01:47,070
and a smoother shape.

38
00:01:47,070 --> 00:01:50,730
Cause the further we get
from the roots of the tail,

39
00:01:50,730 --> 00:01:54,890
the more absorption of the
heaps motion we will add.

40
00:01:54,890 --> 00:01:57,950
Since we are rebuilding
the whole tail motion,

41
00:01:57,950 --> 00:02:02,030
I can get treated off any
of the next joint motion

42
00:02:02,030 --> 00:02:04,300
because they are currently disturbing.

43
00:02:04,300 --> 00:02:07,360
I can get treated of the
intermediate key frame

44
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:10,470
for the two controllers
or the tip of the tail.

45
00:02:10,470 --> 00:02:12,230
So that it stays straight

46
00:02:12,230 --> 00:02:14,160
and I have less difficulties

47
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:16,340
reading the motion of the tail.

48
00:02:16,340 --> 00:02:18,680
As soon as I get a satisfying motion,

49
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:22,780
I make sure that the cycle
is transitioning properly

50
00:02:22,780 --> 00:02:25,710
and I can jump on the next joint.

51
00:02:25,710 --> 00:02:29,500
Can now rework the
motion of the next joint

52
00:02:29,500 --> 00:02:32,840
by simply duplicating the first key frame

53
00:02:32,840 --> 00:02:35,430
and reshaping the curve at will

54
00:02:35,430 --> 00:02:38,410
based on the motion of the previous joint.

55
00:02:38,410 --> 00:02:40,230
It's pretty straightforward.

56
00:02:40,230 --> 00:02:45,210
The idea is to create a slight
waviness in the tail motion.

57
00:02:45,210 --> 00:02:48,080
So if you want to create
a nice tail motion

58
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:49,500
for this animation,

59
00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:53,200
make sure that the root of
the tail is moving properly.

60
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:56,640
And then you just create
this animation fall off

61
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:57,583
along the way.

62
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:02,290
From there we can start
working on this Z axis

63
00:03:02,290 --> 00:03:04,660
for the left to right motion of the tail.

64
00:03:04,660 --> 00:03:08,030
It's the same process as
for the previous motion

65
00:03:08,030 --> 00:03:11,160
but we'll keep it a little
more subtle this time.

66
00:03:11,160 --> 00:03:13,540
Since I'm rebuilding this motion,

67
00:03:13,540 --> 00:03:16,780
I will get rid of all
the existing key frames

68
00:03:16,780 --> 00:03:20,040
and will start by
duplicating the first key

69
00:03:20,040 --> 00:03:22,530
Based on the hips motion of the character

70
00:03:22,530 --> 00:03:23,980
I will create the follow-through

71
00:03:23,980 --> 00:03:26,050
when the hips are going right

72
00:03:26,050 --> 00:03:28,530
I will decide to rotate
the tail to the left

73
00:03:28,530 --> 00:03:31,680
to create the dragging
motion of follow through.

74
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:34,580
Usually I make sure that
frame zero and frame 10

75
00:03:34,580 --> 00:03:37,450
are the same and that they are align

76
00:03:37,450 --> 00:03:41,230
are transitioning smoothly
with the next key frames.

77
00:03:41,230 --> 00:03:44,290
I will then repeat the
process on the other joints.

78
00:03:44,290 --> 00:03:47,230
As usual, you can see the full process

79
00:03:47,230 --> 00:03:49,173
in the time-lapse video.

80
00:03:50,850 --> 00:03:53,750
So the finer parts of this animation is

81
00:03:53,750 --> 00:03:56,830
to work on all the secondary details

82
00:03:56,830 --> 00:03:59,950
like the ears, eyes and nose tip.

83
00:03:59,950 --> 00:04:02,133
I will use the straightforward method

84
00:04:02,133 --> 00:04:05,470
meaning that I will be
animating along the way.

85
00:04:05,470 --> 00:04:07,750
With both ears controllers selected,

86
00:04:07,750 --> 00:04:10,060
I will get rid all the key frames

87
00:04:10,060 --> 00:04:12,500
between frame zero and frame 10

88
00:04:12,500 --> 00:04:14,210
Two thing we have to think of.

89
00:04:14,210 --> 00:04:16,640
The first one is to avoid twinning.

90
00:04:16,640 --> 00:04:20,520
That's why I pulled the
bit back the right ear

91
00:04:20,520 --> 00:04:21,840
from the side view,

92
00:04:21,840 --> 00:04:25,180
so that when we read the
silhouette our character.

93
00:04:25,180 --> 00:04:27,440
We can see both ears.

94
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:32,440
And the second thing is to
keep the ears a little back

95
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:35,750
since our character is coming verticality

96
00:04:35,750 --> 00:04:37,940
the ears of a bit of weight.

97
00:04:37,940 --> 00:04:40,140
So they are pointing downward

98
00:04:40,140 --> 00:04:44,460
and the momentum make them
also drag a bit backwards.

99
00:04:44,460 --> 00:04:47,150
So when you enter the follow-through path

100
00:04:47,150 --> 00:04:49,030
whenever the car car is contacting

101
00:04:49,030 --> 00:04:53,140
with the ground and the
ears are moving forward.

102
00:04:53,140 --> 00:04:55,760
Don't push them too far forward.

103
00:04:55,760 --> 00:04:58,550
On some with those base poses,

104
00:04:58,550 --> 00:05:00,530
I can slightly polish the curve.

105
00:05:00,530 --> 00:05:03,630
Don't forget that you
are working on the cycle.

106
00:05:03,630 --> 00:05:07,410
So you need the curve
to transition properly

107
00:05:07,410 --> 00:05:09,263
from one cycle to the other.

108
00:05:10,500 --> 00:05:13,110
This is why I was missing the keys.

109
00:05:13,110 --> 00:05:17,300
I will also offset the motion
of the ears by one key frame

110
00:05:17,300 --> 00:05:21,300
by duplicating the first
key frame onto frame one.

111
00:05:21,300 --> 00:05:24,210
And then I rework my transition,

112
00:05:24,210 --> 00:05:26,380
rotate my keys, duplicate them.

113
00:05:26,380 --> 00:05:29,293
So that frame zero one
frame 10 are the same.

114
00:05:30,260 --> 00:05:33,390
Do the same on the Z
rotation and Y rotation

115
00:05:33,390 --> 00:05:36,910
even if the interference is very subtle.

116
00:05:36,910 --> 00:05:40,370
I want to avoid any
glitches in the motion.

117
00:05:40,370 --> 00:05:44,483
We need smooth transition
from one cycle to the other.

118
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:49,853
Then I worked on the eyes.

119
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:53,780
The idea is not to create an eye blink

120
00:05:53,780 --> 00:05:55,130
as explained before.

121
00:05:55,130 --> 00:05:57,850
You should not make your characters blink

122
00:05:57,850 --> 00:06:02,210
during a cycle, because it
will look super repetitive.

123
00:06:02,210 --> 00:06:05,360
It is to add subtle
follow through animation

124
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:09,630
by slightly closing the eyes
while the head is going up.

125
00:06:09,630 --> 00:06:13,390
Here I don't care about
twinning since both eye I

126
00:06:13,390 --> 00:06:16,530
will barely be seen at the same time.

127
00:06:16,530 --> 00:06:19,493
So I can work on both
curve at the same time.

128
00:06:20,799 --> 00:06:24,649
To tackle the nose motion
as I did for the ears.

129
00:06:24,649 --> 00:06:28,100
Animating with with the
straightforward method.

130
00:06:28,100 --> 00:06:32,340
Making it drag based on the
head motion, then make sure

131
00:06:32,340 --> 00:06:36,630
that the curve transition
properly during the cycle.

132
00:06:36,630 --> 00:06:38,460
And this is the final touch

133
00:06:38,460 --> 00:06:40,843
to this climbing cycle animation.

134
00:06:43,390 --> 00:06:47,130
To make sure that our
cycle is properly made.

135
00:06:47,130 --> 00:06:50,210
I will display all the controllers curve

136
00:06:50,210 --> 00:06:53,520
with the show hidden filter enabled.

137
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:55,570
Don't forget to press Alt+H

138
00:06:55,570 --> 00:06:59,600
on top of this to make sure
that you unhide every curves.

139
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:03,380
Then I make sure that the
root channels are disabled

140
00:07:03,380 --> 00:07:07,070
because they are not
using a cycle modifier,

141
00:07:07,070 --> 00:07:09,503
but linear extrapolation.

142
00:07:10,860 --> 00:07:14,480
Then they will select all
the keys on frame zero,

143
00:07:14,480 --> 00:07:18,680
press V and switch the
Handle Type to free.

144
00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:21,500
As explained before with this Handle Type

145
00:07:21,500 --> 00:07:24,420
the current key frames
are no longer influenced

146
00:07:24,420 --> 00:07:27,550
by the next or previous key frame.

147
00:07:27,550 --> 00:07:32,010
So from there I can duplicate
them and move them on Frame 10

148
00:07:32,010 --> 00:07:36,510
and I'm sure that the handle
orientation won't be changed.

149
00:07:36,510 --> 00:07:38,830
This is a guarantee that your animation

150
00:07:38,830 --> 00:07:40,940
will cycle perfectly.

151
00:07:40,940 --> 00:07:43,800
This is the last animation
we have to create

152
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:45,080
of this character.

153
00:07:45,080 --> 00:07:47,280
Congratulation if you got so far,

154
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:50,670
if not don't give up and
rework your animation.

155
00:07:50,670 --> 00:07:52,730
The next video will be a time-lapse

156
00:07:52,730 --> 00:07:54,840
of what we have just seen.

157
00:07:54,840 --> 00:07:57,700
And then I will show
you all we can combine

158
00:07:57,700 --> 00:08:01,760
all the action we have
created with our character

159
00:08:01,760 --> 00:08:04,257
into the NLA editor.
