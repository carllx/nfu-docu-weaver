00:00:00,840 --> 00:00:02,720
- [Narrator] Welcome to chapter three.

2
00:00:02,720 --> 00:00:05,900
You are beginning in
animation and this chapter

3
00:00:05,900 --> 00:00:09,020
is one of the most important chapter.

4
00:00:09,020 --> 00:00:11,760
You will learn everything you need to know

5
00:00:11,760 --> 00:00:14,810
to create all the squirrel animation

6
00:00:14,810 --> 00:00:17,520
used in the first course teaser.

7
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:21,420
We will warm up through
some bouncing ball exercises

8
00:00:21,420 --> 00:00:25,650
where you will be able to
sharpen your motion technique

9
00:00:25,650 --> 00:00:29,050
and get familiar with
the use of an armature

10
00:00:29,050 --> 00:00:31,410
or a rig to animate.

11
00:00:31,410 --> 00:00:33,960
I will mix those exercise video

12
00:00:33,960 --> 00:00:36,230
with some theoretical videos

13
00:00:36,230 --> 00:00:39,370
where we will explain the core concept

14
00:00:39,370 --> 00:00:42,840
between world space and local space,

15
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:47,830
overlapping, follow through
and overshoot in an animation.

16
00:00:47,830 --> 00:00:50,800
The different steps of animation creation,

17
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:55,180
blocking, breakdowns, in
between going to spline

18
00:00:55,180 --> 00:00:58,900
and polishing the
animation, understanding ox,

19
00:00:58,900 --> 00:01:00,880
timing, and spacing.

20
00:01:00,880 --> 00:01:05,610
We will also have an in-depth
look to the NLA editor.

21
00:01:05,610 --> 00:01:08,200
This is a very important chapter

22
00:01:08,200 --> 00:01:11,050
as you will learn all the fundamentals

23
00:01:11,050 --> 00:01:13,750
and as I would repeat it along the way

24
00:01:13,750 --> 00:01:18,010
it's very important that
you make every exercises.

25
00:01:18,010 --> 00:01:20,520
If you want to get good at animation

26
00:01:20,520 --> 00:01:23,240
and be able to create all those animation

27
00:01:23,240 --> 00:01:24,810
you have to animate.

28
00:01:24,810 --> 00:01:27,150
Watching those video won't be enough.

29
00:01:27,150 --> 00:01:29,920
Make those animation,
don't be afraid to fail.

30
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:32,490
It's a part of the learning process

31
00:01:32,490 --> 00:01:35,600
but if you carefully
follow the different steps

32
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:39,380
and understand the core
principle, you will rapidly get

33
00:01:39,380 --> 00:01:42,513
to a satisfying result, let's get started.
