00:00:01,670 --> 00:00:02,503
- [Pierrick] In this video,

2
00:00:02,503 --> 00:00:05,720
we are going to learn our first pose

3
00:00:05,720 --> 00:00:10,720
and I will teach you some tips
about good posing workflow.

4
00:00:10,870 --> 00:00:12,880
You will find in the documentation

5
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:15,470
a link to my Pinterest collection.

6
00:00:15,470 --> 00:00:19,290
It includes a lot of
different poses from sports,

7
00:00:19,290 --> 00:00:23,750
martial arts, that you can
use to repeat this exercise.

8
00:00:23,750 --> 00:00:26,470
The more you will do,
the better you will get.

9
00:00:26,470 --> 00:00:30,690
It's perfectly fine to
use drawing references

10
00:00:30,690 --> 00:00:33,350
whenever you are creating your poses

11
00:00:33,350 --> 00:00:36,470
or searching for references
for your animation.

12
00:00:36,470 --> 00:00:38,000
But for this exercise,

13
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,410
I advise you to use a photo

14
00:00:40,410 --> 00:00:44,490
because if you are using drawing
references or illustration,

15
00:00:44,490 --> 00:00:46,660
there is big chance that the artist

16
00:00:46,660 --> 00:00:50,280
has already pushed the pose,
like on this one, for example.

17
00:00:50,280 --> 00:00:52,700
So again, I truly encourage you

18
00:00:52,700 --> 00:00:56,480
to watch as much illustration
and drawing as possible,

19
00:00:56,480 --> 00:00:59,790
even try to reproduce those poses.

20
00:00:59,790 --> 00:01:02,410
But for the sake of learning,

21
00:01:02,410 --> 00:01:05,770
I think it's better to
use photo references.

22
00:01:05,770 --> 00:01:09,610
Here is the first pose
we are going to work on.

23
00:01:09,610 --> 00:01:12,300
you will find the link
in the documentation.

24
00:01:12,300 --> 00:01:14,020
Here is what we have to look for

25
00:01:14,020 --> 00:01:16,360
whenever we start working on a new pose.

26
00:01:16,360 --> 00:01:18,800
First of all, the line of action.

27
00:01:18,800 --> 00:01:21,440
In this case, it's super obvious.

28
00:01:21,440 --> 00:01:24,040
It goes from the right foot to the head.

29
00:01:24,040 --> 00:01:28,820
So, we definitely need to
define this line of action

30
00:01:28,820 --> 00:01:30,010
in our posing.

31
00:01:30,010 --> 00:01:32,580
Then I'm looking for secondary shapes.

32
00:01:32,580 --> 00:01:35,120
Look at the flow in the arms.

33
00:01:35,120 --> 00:01:39,060
It creates a nice S shape
with shoulders aligned.

34
00:01:39,060 --> 00:01:42,160
Then I'm looking at the leg flow,

35
00:01:42,160 --> 00:01:45,440
creating a nice angle with the body.

36
00:01:45,440 --> 00:01:49,640
And finally, the torso creates
this nice and smooth curve.

37
00:01:49,640 --> 00:01:53,080
So, those lines are the
one we need to identify

38
00:01:53,080 --> 00:01:56,400
and clearly define in our posing.

39
00:01:56,400 --> 00:01:58,880
Third thing I like to do on my references

40
00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:01,550
is try to define the orientation

41
00:02:01,550 --> 00:02:05,470
of the main features of the
body, especially the torso.

42
00:02:05,470 --> 00:02:07,780
I will quickly draw some lines

43
00:02:07,780 --> 00:02:11,360
that defines the orientation of the torso

44
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:16,210
and its main shape, as if I
was sketching the current pose.

45
00:02:16,210 --> 00:02:19,800
The simple thing of doing
this is writing in my brain

46
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:21,690
what I will have to look for.

47
00:02:21,690 --> 00:02:24,230
So, whenever you are using a reference,

48
00:02:24,230 --> 00:02:26,910
just draw some line on top of it,

49
00:02:26,910 --> 00:02:30,150
trying to identify the
shoulder orientation,

50
00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:33,480
the eye orientation and
the torso orientation.

51
00:02:33,480 --> 00:02:36,110
Let's get started and prepare our file.

52
00:02:36,110 --> 00:02:38,040
I'm starting where we left

53
00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:40,170
with our run cycle finished

54
00:02:40,170 --> 00:02:43,580
and then will search for the keying action

55
00:02:43,580 --> 00:02:44,870
in the action editor.

56
00:02:44,870 --> 00:02:47,010
I will duplicate this action

57
00:02:47,010 --> 00:02:52,010
with our character in a rest
pose and rename it 04-post-01.

58
00:02:53,110 --> 00:02:55,210
Don't forget to click the shield icon,

59
00:02:55,210 --> 00:02:56,870
I've just forgotten to do it.

60
00:02:56,870 --> 00:03:00,800
Then on my second 3D view,
I will rework the shading

61
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:03,870
and set it to flat, object color,

62
00:03:03,870 --> 00:03:06,070
get rid of cavity and shadows

63
00:03:06,070 --> 00:03:09,370
so that I get a raw
silhouette of my character.

64
00:03:09,370 --> 00:03:12,170
I will go back to my main 3D view

65
00:03:12,170 --> 00:03:16,440
and in object mode, I will
press Shift + A to add a camera.

66
00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:19,400
Now, the camera should appear in outliner

67
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:22,330
on the root of the scene collection.

68
00:03:22,330 --> 00:03:24,200
With my 3D viewport view

69
00:03:24,200 --> 00:03:27,130
aligned with the front of the character

70
00:03:27,130 --> 00:03:31,600
I will press Control +
Alt + zero on the numpad

71
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:35,360
to set this as being the camera view.

72
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:37,970
I really clean the
camera transform channels

73
00:03:37,970 --> 00:03:41,870
so that there is no offset
on the X-axis location

74
00:03:41,870 --> 00:03:45,213
and no rotation but on the X-axis.

75
00:03:45,213 --> 00:03:47,470
I will hover over my second 3D view

76
00:03:47,470 --> 00:03:50,350
and press zero to switch to camera view.

77
00:03:50,350 --> 00:03:52,473
And then instead of the outliner,

78
00:03:52,473 --> 00:03:57,100
I will open the image editor
and load the reference.

79
00:03:57,100 --> 00:03:59,300
You will find it in the files,

80
00:03:59,300 --> 00:04:01,850
or you can download it from Pinterest

81
00:04:01,850 --> 00:04:03,960
or download any other reference

82
00:04:03,960 --> 00:04:06,570
if you want to work on another reference.

83
00:04:06,570 --> 00:04:09,680
Now what I'm doing is
positioning the camera.

84
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:11,880
I'm having a look to the reference

85
00:04:11,880 --> 00:04:15,270
and it seems that the
person taking the picture

86
00:04:15,270 --> 00:04:18,120
is slightly higher than the character,

87
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:20,160
as we can see the top of the shoulders

88
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:22,490
and the top of the head of the character.

89
00:04:22,490 --> 00:04:24,160
So from a side view,

90
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:27,710
I will slightly raise
the camera to 1.4 meters.

91
00:04:28,905 --> 00:04:31,482
I will push it to the character

92
00:04:31,482 --> 00:04:35,837
and reduce a bit the focal
length to 40 millimeters

93
00:04:35,837 --> 00:04:37,440
to get a wider angle.

94
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:41,500
We will revise the camera
a bit later on if needed.

95
00:04:41,500 --> 00:04:44,240
The last thing I will
do is go back to my rig,

96
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:46,830
press Control + Tab to
switch to pose mode,

97
00:04:46,830 --> 00:04:49,090
I will go to the rig properties panel,

98
00:04:49,090 --> 00:04:51,150
search for HEAD-FOLLOW and NECK-FOLLOW,

99
00:04:51,150 --> 00:04:54,540
set the NECK-FOLLOW to one
and the HEAD-FOLLOW to zero.

100
00:04:54,540 --> 00:04:56,440
That's a personal preference.

101
00:04:56,440 --> 00:04:58,340
But they feel like my characters

102
00:04:58,340 --> 00:05:01,310
generally have a better behavior

103
00:05:01,310 --> 00:05:02,960
with the neck following the chest

104
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:05,980
and the head being free
of any rotation hierarchy.

105
00:05:05,980 --> 00:05:08,880
For me, the most important controllers

106
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:12,380
whenever you are posting a
character that is on the ground

107
00:05:12,380 --> 00:05:15,430
are the torso controller and the feet.

108
00:05:15,430 --> 00:05:19,640
And the torso controller or
center of gravity controller

109
00:05:19,640 --> 00:05:22,570
is the main and most important controller,

110
00:05:22,570 --> 00:05:24,860
whatever the pose you are doing.

111
00:05:24,860 --> 00:05:26,710
So the first thing you have to do

112
00:05:26,710 --> 00:05:29,580
is pose the torso controller.

113
00:05:29,580 --> 00:05:31,010
I'm lowering it

114
00:05:31,010 --> 00:05:35,320
and I'm rotating it to the
side on its local Z-axis

115
00:05:35,320 --> 00:05:38,310
by pressing R and Z twice,

116
00:05:38,310 --> 00:05:42,960
so that I can manipulate the
controller in its local space

117
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:47,590
since by default my pivot
point is set to global.

118
00:05:47,590 --> 00:05:50,440
Then the most important controllers

119
00:05:50,440 --> 00:05:52,500
are the feet controllers.

120
00:05:52,500 --> 00:05:55,480
I am using inverse kinematic as usual,

121
00:05:55,480 --> 00:06:00,480
and I'm manipulating those
controllers on the Y and X-axis

122
00:06:00,890 --> 00:06:03,040
so that they stick to the ground.

123
00:06:03,040 --> 00:06:07,090
Before even watching the
whole shapes of the leg,

124
00:06:07,090 --> 00:06:09,590
I'm watching the orientation of the feet.

125
00:06:09,590 --> 00:06:13,270
One of the big benefit of 3D animation

126
00:06:13,270 --> 00:06:16,790
is that we can focus on each
feature of the character

127
00:06:16,790 --> 00:06:17,760
one by one.

128
00:06:17,760 --> 00:06:22,760
So I first make sure that my
feet are properly oriented

129
00:06:23,180 --> 00:06:26,010
and properly matching the reference.

130
00:06:26,010 --> 00:06:29,760
Then, as we need to adjust to torso shape,

131
00:06:29,760 --> 00:06:33,948
just make sure that you use at 90%,

132
00:06:33,948 --> 00:06:37,300
the center of gravity or
the torso root controller,

133
00:06:37,300 --> 00:06:41,907
and then slightly tweak the
chest and hips by rotating them.

134
00:06:41,907 --> 00:06:45,730
As I'm still at working
on the chest, hips,

135
00:06:45,730 --> 00:06:49,200
and torso controller,
just look at the knees.

136
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:52,320
I've also posed the pole target

137
00:06:52,320 --> 00:06:54,540
so that the right leg knee

138
00:06:54,540 --> 00:06:58,380
point a bit inward toward the camera

139
00:06:58,380 --> 00:07:02,930
while the left leg knee
point a bit on the outside.

140
00:07:02,930 --> 00:07:04,440
At the end of the posting,

141
00:07:04,440 --> 00:07:07,890
almost every single
controller of the character

142
00:07:07,890 --> 00:07:09,400
will be posed.

143
00:07:09,400 --> 00:07:12,863
As any form of art, there
is a lot of back and forth.

144
00:07:14,510 --> 00:07:17,100
You need to watch your
character from every angle

145
00:07:17,100 --> 00:07:18,780
to make sure that it looks good.

146
00:07:18,780 --> 00:07:21,580
Since the legs and the
torso of my character

147
00:07:21,580 --> 00:07:23,290
are more or less posed,

148
00:07:23,290 --> 00:07:26,600
I can now rework a bit
the camera position.

149
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:29,620
I press Control + Tab
to get out of pose mode.

150
00:07:29,620 --> 00:07:33,670
And then I can click the
outer edges of the camera view

151
00:07:33,670 --> 00:07:34,780
to select it.

152
00:07:34,780 --> 00:07:35,730
Then from this view,

153
00:07:35,730 --> 00:07:39,410
you can press G and Z
twice to zoom in and out.

154
00:07:39,410 --> 00:07:43,860
Or press R and the axis of your
choice to rotate the camera.

155
00:07:43,860 --> 00:07:47,130
I've slightly lowered the
camera as it was too high

156
00:07:47,130 --> 00:07:50,453
and rotated it so that I can
nicely frame the character.

157
00:07:50,453 --> 00:07:54,683
Here you can see the actual
transform values of the camera.

158
00:07:56,830 --> 00:07:57,850
From the camera view,

159
00:07:57,850 --> 00:08:02,400
I can slightly adjust the
center of gravity position

160
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:05,430
and also work a bit on
the hips controller.

161
00:08:05,430 --> 00:08:07,013
Note that the hips controller

162
00:08:07,013 --> 00:08:10,420
will have a lot of impact
on your legs shape.

163
00:08:10,420 --> 00:08:12,490
Watch for the groin alignment

164
00:08:12,490 --> 00:08:15,350
and the chest alignment of the reference.

165
00:08:15,350 --> 00:08:17,570
You can see it's leaning a bit forward,

166
00:08:17,570 --> 00:08:20,460
so I'm adjusting it accordingly.

167
00:08:20,460 --> 00:08:22,220
As for life drawing,

168
00:08:22,220 --> 00:08:25,270
watch your reference as often as possible.

169
00:08:25,270 --> 00:08:27,430
Don't over-focus on your character

170
00:08:27,430 --> 00:08:30,210
and forget that you have
to check the reference.

171
00:08:30,210 --> 00:08:32,460
Once I feel like I have a good pose,

172
00:08:32,460 --> 00:08:34,830
I will check my center of gravity

173
00:08:34,830 --> 00:08:37,230
by checking my character from the bottom

174
00:08:37,230 --> 00:08:39,210
and checking the feet alignment

175
00:08:39,210 --> 00:08:42,900
compared to the center of
gravity, or from a side view.

176
00:08:42,900 --> 00:08:46,540
And it feels like my character
is a bit out of balance.

177
00:08:46,540 --> 00:08:51,100
His center of gravity is
a bit too far on his back.

178
00:08:51,100 --> 00:08:54,280
So I feel like the character
will fall on this bottom.

179
00:08:54,280 --> 00:08:55,170
To fix this,

180
00:08:55,170 --> 00:08:59,710
I simply need to push the
center of gravity a bit forward.

181
00:08:59,710 --> 00:09:03,310
This is why it's very
important to check your pose

182
00:09:03,310 --> 00:09:04,400
from every angle,

183
00:09:04,400 --> 00:09:07,940
because this is something
I wouldn't be able to see

184
00:09:07,940 --> 00:09:09,760
through the camera view only.

185
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:12,710
3D posing is like freaky sculpting,

186
00:09:12,710 --> 00:09:14,810
and you won't be sculpting a character

187
00:09:14,810 --> 00:09:18,090
without turning around
it most of the time.

188
00:09:18,090 --> 00:09:22,510
And this is also why
sculpting and drawing,

189
00:09:22,510 --> 00:09:24,470
while they are not mandatory,

190
00:09:24,470 --> 00:09:26,750
will make you a better animator

191
00:09:26,750 --> 00:09:29,800
because you will learn to
better pose your characters.

192
00:09:29,800 --> 00:09:31,150
One thing I've noticed

193
00:09:31,150 --> 00:09:34,270
is that I've rotated the
neck too much forward.

194
00:09:34,270 --> 00:09:36,780
As being a continuity of the spine

195
00:09:36,780 --> 00:09:38,680
that goes through the chest,

196
00:09:38,680 --> 00:09:42,460
try to keep your neck slightly
aligned with the chest

197
00:09:42,460 --> 00:09:43,673
for a better flow.

198
00:09:45,660 --> 00:09:47,160
And then I can rotate the head

199
00:09:47,160 --> 00:09:49,200
to try too match the final pole.

200
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:52,910
I didn't work on the shoulder
or the arm on purpose

201
00:09:52,910 --> 00:09:56,290
so that we can focus on legs and torso.

202
00:09:56,290 --> 00:09:59,970
Don't hesitate to hide
the arms to rig the pose.

203
00:09:59,970 --> 00:10:01,710
Your brain will do the job

204
00:10:01,710 --> 00:10:04,680
of figuring out where the arms should be

205
00:10:04,680 --> 00:10:07,580
and you can have a clear
view of your current pose.

206
00:10:07,580 --> 00:10:11,450
So I can now pose the arm,
I will display them again,

207
00:10:11,450 --> 00:10:14,190
and I will start with the shoulders.

208
00:10:14,190 --> 00:10:17,250
The shoulders are clearly
raised on the character,

209
00:10:17,250 --> 00:10:18,760
so I would rotate them,

210
00:10:18,760 --> 00:10:21,010
and then I would start
posing the left arm.

211
00:10:21,010 --> 00:10:22,850
When posing the forearm,

212
00:10:22,850 --> 00:10:27,230
do remember that your elbow
can rotate only on one axis,

213
00:10:27,230 --> 00:10:29,250
the local Z-axis.

214
00:10:29,250 --> 00:10:31,950
Whenever I need to change
the orientation of the arm,

215
00:10:31,950 --> 00:10:36,030
I will twist the arm controller,
not the forearm controller.

216
00:10:36,030 --> 00:10:37,860
And then I pose my character

217
00:10:37,860 --> 00:10:40,780
following the chain of hierarchy.

218
00:10:40,780 --> 00:10:43,810
First the shoulder, then the
arm, and finally the forearm.

219
00:10:43,810 --> 00:10:46,630
Then I will work on the other arm.

220
00:10:46,630 --> 00:10:49,920
And when I've run the reference analysis,

221
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:52,930
I've tried to figure where the elbow was

222
00:10:52,930 --> 00:10:54,000
beneath those clothes

223
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,890
so that they can then
select the arm controller

224
00:10:56,890 --> 00:11:00,960
and twist it accordingly so
that the elbow is pointing down.

225
00:11:00,960 --> 00:11:04,850
Then as usual, I will go down
the chain and pose the hand

226
00:11:04,850 --> 00:11:08,033
so that it's slightly
open towards the sky.

227
00:11:09,620 --> 00:11:12,650
From there, I can turn around my character

228
00:11:12,650 --> 00:11:16,330
and spot that the arm is not
aligned with the shoulder,

229
00:11:16,330 --> 00:11:19,910
and it generates a weird
angle that doesn't look good

230
00:11:19,910 --> 00:11:22,410
and that is not anatomically correct.

231
00:11:22,410 --> 00:11:24,170
If you hold your shoulder

232
00:11:24,170 --> 00:11:27,150
and try to rotate your arm backward

233
00:11:27,150 --> 00:11:29,320
with your elbow pointing down,

234
00:11:29,320 --> 00:11:31,840
you won't be able to reach this angle.

235
00:11:31,840 --> 00:11:34,150
So I will fix a bit the pose,

236
00:11:34,150 --> 00:11:36,810
and now look at the flow
between the two arms.

237
00:11:36,810 --> 00:11:40,180
But most of the time you
want your arms to flow

238
00:11:40,180 --> 00:11:41,490
in a nice curve.

239
00:11:41,490 --> 00:11:43,890
You may think of your arms building

240
00:11:43,890 --> 00:11:46,240
a second line of action in a way.

241
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:47,530
We are almost done.

242
00:11:47,530 --> 00:11:50,550
Now I'm just double checking
the different features.

243
00:11:50,550 --> 00:11:53,040
You can see that my head orientation

244
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:54,820
doesn't match the reference.

245
00:11:54,820 --> 00:11:59,250
So rotating a bit the neck
and the head, I can adjust it.

246
00:11:59,250 --> 00:12:02,300
It's also a good idea
to pose a bit the eyes.

247
00:12:02,300 --> 00:12:05,700
Just check both controller
on top of the eyebrows.

248
00:12:05,700 --> 00:12:07,310
By simply moving them,

249
00:12:07,310 --> 00:12:11,310
you will be able to set
pre-made shapes for the eyebrows

250
00:12:11,310 --> 00:12:15,320
that will all you to reach
appealing pose pretty quickly.

251
00:12:15,320 --> 00:12:17,380
As I'm almost done with the pose,

252
00:12:17,380 --> 00:12:19,990
I'm double checking
the different features.

253
00:12:19,990 --> 00:12:23,360
Slightly repositioning the
foot and reorienting them.

254
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:25,130
And I will just put another problem

255
00:12:25,130 --> 00:12:28,150
regarding the relationship
between the left shoulder

256
00:12:28,150 --> 00:12:29,350
and the left arm.

257
00:12:29,350 --> 00:12:32,080
This angle here is impossible to reach

258
00:12:32,080 --> 00:12:34,750
between the shoulder and the arm.

259
00:12:34,750 --> 00:12:37,520
Basically, with your shoulder at rest

260
00:12:37,520 --> 00:12:41,410
you can't have your elbow
getting upper than the shoulder.

261
00:12:41,410 --> 00:12:45,500
As soon as you want to rotate
the arm beyond the T pose,

262
00:12:45,500 --> 00:12:47,160
the rotation is done by the shoulder,

263
00:12:47,160 --> 00:12:50,050
creating a nice straight line

264
00:12:50,050 --> 00:12:52,170
between the shoulder and the arm.

265
00:12:52,170 --> 00:12:55,410
So this is really something
you have to remember.

266
00:12:55,410 --> 00:12:59,140
Don't forget that the arm
rotation has a lot of limitation

267
00:12:59,140 --> 00:13:01,500
and you need to compensate
with the shorter.

268
00:13:01,500 --> 00:13:03,930
That's a beginner mistake I see a lot.

269
00:13:03,930 --> 00:13:07,333
So I can fix this issue
and now pose the hands.

270
00:13:08,970 --> 00:13:12,800
One of the most important
controller regarding the hand

271
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:14,690
is the palm controller.

272
00:13:14,690 --> 00:13:17,630
This is this little controller
on the side of the hand.

273
00:13:17,630 --> 00:13:18,860
When rotating it,

274
00:13:18,860 --> 00:13:19,853
it will curl the hand

275
00:13:19,853 --> 00:13:23,320
with a nice fall off between
the different pan bones.

276
00:13:23,320 --> 00:13:26,650
First beginner mistake
to absolutely avoid,

277
00:13:26,650 --> 00:13:30,570
hands are never flat, unless
you are pushing on a wall.

278
00:13:30,570 --> 00:13:33,960
So please always input a bit of rotation

279
00:13:33,960 --> 00:13:35,790
in this palm controller.

280
00:13:35,790 --> 00:13:38,330
As for the elbow and the arms,

281
00:13:38,330 --> 00:13:41,340
the fingers have limitation
in their rotation.

282
00:13:41,340 --> 00:13:45,520
Remember that your finger
root can tilt a bit

283
00:13:45,520 --> 00:13:47,900
or rotate side to side.

284
00:13:47,900 --> 00:13:50,900
They can curl, but they
can't really twist.

285
00:13:50,900 --> 00:13:54,290
When it comes to next
joint into your fingers,

286
00:13:54,290 --> 00:13:58,320
which are manipulated using
the second controller here,

287
00:13:58,320 --> 00:14:01,080
they should only be able to curl.

288
00:14:01,080 --> 00:14:03,960
So while everything is
possible in animation,

289
00:14:03,960 --> 00:14:08,120
try to match those anatomical constraints

290
00:14:08,120 --> 00:14:10,520
whenever you are posing your character.

291
00:14:10,520 --> 00:14:12,300
Then while moving,

292
00:14:12,300 --> 00:14:15,840
we may need to bend the
limbs of our character

293
00:14:15,840 --> 00:14:19,230
in a weird way, just to follow
the flow of the animation.

294
00:14:19,230 --> 00:14:24,230
But currently, just try to
respect anatomical constraints.

295
00:14:24,340 --> 00:14:26,170
Now regarding the finger pose,

296
00:14:26,170 --> 00:14:27,910
look at how they are grouped.

297
00:14:27,910 --> 00:14:31,790
The index and the middle
finger are linked together,

298
00:14:31,790 --> 00:14:35,870
while the ring finger is
slightly getting away,

299
00:14:35,870 --> 00:14:40,260
and the pinky is the one that
is the most on the outside

300
00:14:40,260 --> 00:14:41,810
and opening the hand.

301
00:14:41,810 --> 00:14:45,020
Finally, don't hesitate
to change the location

302
00:14:45,020 --> 00:14:46,530
of the controller too.

303
00:14:46,530 --> 00:14:48,570
You can move them by grabbing them

304
00:14:48,570 --> 00:14:51,200
if you feel like the rig is breaking

305
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:54,580
or you can't reach the pose
you are currently looking at.

306
00:14:54,580 --> 00:14:57,150
There is no rule of thumb (chuckles)

307
00:14:57,150 --> 00:14:58,927
whenever you are opposing the hands.

308
00:14:58,927 --> 00:15:02,050
Also, you see, while I'm pushing you

309
00:15:02,050 --> 00:15:04,550
to follow the constraint of the body

310
00:15:04,550 --> 00:15:06,520
whenever you're opposing your character,

311
00:15:06,520 --> 00:15:08,490
what's matter is the shape.

312
00:15:08,490 --> 00:15:12,440
So if you can't reach the
correct shape for the fingers

313
00:15:12,440 --> 00:15:17,440
using an anatomically correct
behavior with the controllers,

314
00:15:18,130 --> 00:15:20,770
just cheat and move them a bit.

315
00:15:20,770 --> 00:15:24,150
Even if those controllers
are called bones,

316
00:15:24,150 --> 00:15:27,080
they don't behave like
a real life skeleton.

317
00:15:27,080 --> 00:15:30,830
Plus you have to take into
account the flesh, the muscle,

318
00:15:30,830 --> 00:15:33,530
the fat on top of the body

319
00:15:33,530 --> 00:15:36,260
that will currently shape your character.

320
00:15:36,260 --> 00:15:38,730
So just move them as you want

321
00:15:38,730 --> 00:15:41,800
so that you can reach the nice pose.

322
00:15:41,800 --> 00:15:46,800
While I do advise you to
follow anatomical constraint,

323
00:15:47,710 --> 00:15:51,130
if you can't reach the pose
you want, just cheat a bit.

324
00:15:51,130 --> 00:15:55,060
So my advice is to always
follow an anatomical constraint,

325
00:15:55,060 --> 00:15:58,320
especially if the rig is built on them.

326
00:15:58,320 --> 00:16:00,830
Which is more or less the
case with this rigging.

327
00:16:00,830 --> 00:16:03,520
But the most important
thing is the result,

328
00:16:03,520 --> 00:16:07,310
this is what your customer,
the viewer, will see.

329
00:16:07,310 --> 00:16:08,570
So if you need,

330
00:16:08,570 --> 00:16:11,750
cheat with the rig to
get to the right result.

331
00:16:11,750 --> 00:16:15,470
An example here, I'm
using this ankle tweaker

332
00:16:15,470 --> 00:16:19,770
just to break a bit the odd
angle I have on the ankle

333
00:16:19,770 --> 00:16:21,730
that doesn't look right.

334
00:16:21,730 --> 00:16:23,500
This is not anatomically correct,

335
00:16:23,500 --> 00:16:25,310
that will be pretty painful,

336
00:16:25,310 --> 00:16:27,550
but in the end it looks a bit better.

337
00:16:27,550 --> 00:16:31,970
So some with small adjustment,
we can call this posing done.

338
00:16:31,970 --> 00:16:32,940
In the next video,

339
00:16:32,940 --> 00:16:36,180
we are going to see how
we can push this pose

340
00:16:36,180 --> 00:16:38,133
to make it even more appealing.
