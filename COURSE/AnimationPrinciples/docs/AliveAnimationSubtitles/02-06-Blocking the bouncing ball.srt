1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,970
- Let's start blocking animation

2
00:00:02,970 --> 00:00:04,440
of the bouncing ball.

3
00:00:04,440 --> 00:00:07,890
Here, I still have my basic interpolation.

4
00:00:07,890 --> 00:00:09,980
So with all the key frames selected,

5
00:00:09,980 --> 00:00:14,250
I will press T and switch
to constant interpolation.

6
00:00:14,250 --> 00:00:16,050
This way our ball will snap

7
00:00:16,050 --> 00:00:19,310
on the different position
we have previously set.

8
00:00:19,310 --> 00:00:23,930
The idea is not to get
disturbed by any interpolation

9
00:00:23,930 --> 00:00:27,000
and focus on the timing and shapes

10
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:28,380
of our ball.

11
00:00:28,380 --> 00:00:33,010
Since our animation will
be cycling upon 24 frame,

12
00:00:33,010 --> 00:00:36,740
the frames zero and the frame
24 will be exactly the same.

13
00:00:36,740 --> 00:00:40,420
So my timing will be a bit
off if I read both frame zero

14
00:00:40,420 --> 00:00:41,790
and the frame 24.

15
00:00:41,790 --> 00:00:44,087
So I will reduce the
length of my animation

16
00:00:44,087 --> 00:00:47,070
from frame zero to frame 23,

17
00:00:47,070 --> 00:00:48,280
talking about Shape.

18
00:00:48,280 --> 00:00:52,380
We will here now look at
the squash and stretch.

19
00:00:52,380 --> 00:00:53,970
If you're into animation,

20
00:00:53,970 --> 00:00:56,510
I'm sure you already have heard about it.

21
00:00:56,510 --> 00:00:59,030
If you look for squash and
stretch ball on YouTube,

22
00:00:59,030 --> 00:01:00,430
you may find this video.

23
00:01:00,430 --> 00:01:02,800
I put the link in the documentation .

24
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:05,960
When the ball gets thrown at
high speed on the surface,

25
00:01:05,960 --> 00:01:08,000
and it touches it, it squashes.

26
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,894
With the power of the
impact, the ball get tighter,

27
00:01:10,894 --> 00:01:13,530
but it's volume has to be preserved.

28
00:01:13,530 --> 00:01:15,760
So it also gets larger.

29
00:01:15,760 --> 00:01:16,800
But in this case,

30
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:20,420
squashing will bring
to us two information.

31
00:01:20,420 --> 00:01:23,550
The power of the impact, and the softness

32
00:01:23,550 --> 00:01:26,070
of the material of the ball.

33
00:01:26,070 --> 00:01:27,795
Regarding our animation,

34
00:01:27,795 --> 00:01:31,010
if we consider our frame
zero to be the frame,

35
00:01:31,010 --> 00:01:34,060
where our object will touch the ground,

36
00:01:34,060 --> 00:01:37,270
we can go like one or two frame forward

37
00:01:37,270 --> 00:01:40,510
and start squashing the ball by scaling it

38
00:01:40,510 --> 00:01:42,610
on the Z axis down,

39
00:01:42,610 --> 00:01:46,950
but also scaling it on the X and Y axis.

40
00:01:46,950 --> 00:01:50,890
This way we will have some
all volume preservation.

41
00:01:50,890 --> 00:01:52,850
You can see here that the key frame,

42
00:01:52,850 --> 00:01:53,770
hasn't been written,

43
00:01:53,770 --> 00:01:56,460
as I need to enable the auto recording.

44
00:01:56,460 --> 00:02:00,640
Since I haven't written any
scaling key frame previously,

45
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:03,040
you can see that the ball remained flat.

46
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:06,400
I will just press ALT
+ S to reset the scale

47
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:09,540
on the first frame and
on all the other frames.

48
00:02:09,540 --> 00:02:13,033
As we have just created
the scaling key frames,

49
00:02:13,033 --> 00:02:16,550
they have just been
added to our animation.

50
00:02:16,550 --> 00:02:21,140
And so by default Lendo will
switch their interpolation

51
00:02:21,140 --> 00:02:22,110
to basic.

52
00:02:22,110 --> 00:02:25,020
So we can see that our location is still

53
00:02:25,020 --> 00:02:28,210
in step mode, but we have
a scaling interpolation.

54
00:02:28,210 --> 00:02:30,960
So I will select all the key frame press T

55
00:02:30,960 --> 00:02:32,680
and set them to constant.

56
00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:36,090
From there, we can work on
the stretching of our ball.

57
00:02:36,090 --> 00:02:39,430
Stretching is physically
less obvious when we

58
00:02:39,430 --> 00:02:41,752
are watching the tennis ball bouncing,

59
00:02:41,752 --> 00:02:44,550
but it's yet still here.

60
00:02:44,550 --> 00:02:48,930
So we can use stretching to
input physical information

61
00:02:48,930 --> 00:02:50,034
to our bouncing ball,

62
00:02:50,034 --> 00:02:54,750
but we can also use it to
input speed information.

63
00:02:54,750 --> 00:02:56,580
If we look at the very beginning

64
00:02:56,580 --> 00:02:57,413
of the video,

65
00:02:57,413 --> 00:03:00,380
we can see that the ball is blurry

66
00:03:00,380 --> 00:03:05,320
and it immediately translate
to us some speed information.

67
00:03:05,320 --> 00:03:06,280
So why the ball

68
00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:08,860
is probably currently perfectly round,

69
00:03:08,860 --> 00:03:12,450
the way the camera is
capturing it forms some kind

70
00:03:12,450 --> 00:03:13,663
of elliptic shapes.

71
00:03:13,663 --> 00:03:17,260
And we have the same feeling
whenever we are watching

72
00:03:17,260 --> 00:03:18,950
something that goes fast.

73
00:03:18,950 --> 00:03:20,600
And if we watched a right hand

74
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:21,550
of the scientist,

75
00:03:21,550 --> 00:03:24,034
we can see that his
fingers are also blurred

76
00:03:24,034 --> 00:03:26,840
because his hand was moving very fast.

77
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:29,580
It makes his finger looks a little larger

78
00:03:29,580 --> 00:03:31,370
and longer due to speed.

79
00:03:31,370 --> 00:03:33,070
When an object is falling

80
00:03:33,070 --> 00:03:34,280
and hitting the ground,

81
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:39,000
it is at its maximum speed
just before it hit the ground.

82
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,260
On the frame zero,

83
00:03:40,260 --> 00:03:44,560
we can input stretching
information by scaling the ball up

84
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:47,480
and reducing it's scale on X and Y

85
00:03:47,480 --> 00:03:48,943
to preserve its volume.

86
00:03:48,943 --> 00:03:51,670
When the ball will leave the ground,

87
00:03:51,670 --> 00:03:54,500
it will also be it's highest speed.

88
00:03:54,500 --> 00:03:57,670
So I can duplicate frame zero and move it

89
00:03:57,670 --> 00:03:59,910
on frame three or frame four.

90
00:03:59,910 --> 00:04:03,154
The ball stretch, hit the ground, squash,

91
00:04:03,154 --> 00:04:06,290
and stretch again when leaving the ground.

92
00:04:06,290 --> 00:04:08,445
Just by looking those few frames,

93
00:04:08,445 --> 00:04:11,870
we start to have the
feeling of the animation

94
00:04:11,870 --> 00:04:12,790
of the ball.

95
00:04:12,790 --> 00:04:15,260
And this is a very important input

96
00:04:15,260 --> 00:04:18,150
whenever we will be
using the blocking method

97
00:04:18,150 --> 00:04:20,653
is that you have to feel your animation

98
00:04:20,653 --> 00:04:23,360
just through those poses.

99
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:24,270
As told before,

100
00:04:24,270 --> 00:04:27,630
frame zero and frame 24 are
supposed to be the same.

101
00:04:27,630 --> 00:04:29,030
So I will select frame zero,

102
00:04:29,030 --> 00:04:33,110
press Shift + D to duplicate
it and move it on frame 20.

103
00:04:33,110 --> 00:04:35,850
From frame zero to frame four the ball is

104
00:04:35,850 --> 00:04:36,683
on the ground

105
00:04:36,683 --> 00:04:39,440
and then it's leaving the
ground from frame four

106
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:40,940
to frame 24.

107
00:04:40,940 --> 00:04:43,960
Timing wise, the ball should travel upward

108
00:04:43,960 --> 00:04:46,350
and downward almost evenly.

109
00:04:46,350 --> 00:04:47,670
So I can offset the

110
00:04:47,670 --> 00:04:50,230
up position to frame 14.

111
00:04:50,230 --> 00:04:53,210
This way, we have 10
frame and moving upward

112
00:04:53,210 --> 00:04:55,570
and 10 frame moving downward.

113
00:04:55,570 --> 00:04:57,910
As a more subtle detailed pass,

114
00:04:57,910 --> 00:05:01,560
what we can do is slightly squash the ball

115
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:05,130
whenever it reaches its top position.

116
00:05:05,130 --> 00:05:08,660
This slight modification
will translate the inertia

117
00:05:08,660 --> 00:05:10,890
of the ball whenever it's slowing down

118
00:05:10,890 --> 00:05:12,370
to its stop position.

119
00:05:12,370 --> 00:05:14,730
Currently our blocking is bringing

120
00:05:14,730 --> 00:05:16,890
the minimum information we need

121
00:05:16,890 --> 00:05:19,100
to go to the next step.

122
00:05:19,100 --> 00:05:21,998
All the extreme poses
of the ball are keyed

123
00:05:21,998 --> 00:05:24,110
and we have a rough timing.

124
00:05:24,110 --> 00:05:26,666
For this very specific exercise,

125
00:05:26,666 --> 00:05:30,550
it could be enough for
me to go into spline

126
00:05:30,550 --> 00:05:32,260
to go into the next step

127
00:05:32,260 --> 00:05:33,890
of the animation process

128
00:05:33,890 --> 00:05:36,900
but we can also input some more details

129
00:05:36,900 --> 00:05:38,570
into the blocking stage

130
00:05:38,570 --> 00:05:43,430
by inputting some intermediate
poses or in-between.

131
00:05:43,430 --> 00:05:47,700
The in-between will help
us figuring out the spacing

132
00:05:47,700 --> 00:05:50,420
of our ball whenever it's in the air.

133
00:05:50,420 --> 00:05:53,960
Our ball is making a
eight meter high jump,

134
00:05:53,960 --> 00:05:56,870
so I will move it in
between two, four meter

135
00:05:56,870 --> 00:05:58,660
and I will clear the scaling.

136
00:05:58,660 --> 00:06:01,570
Now, depending on where I will move

137
00:06:01,570 --> 00:06:02,540
this key frame,

138
00:06:02,540 --> 00:06:05,830
it will change the
spacing of the animation.

139
00:06:05,830 --> 00:06:08,620
If I move this key frame
closer up to frame four

140
00:06:08,620 --> 00:06:12,060
where it takes off, our
spacing will be larger

141
00:06:12,060 --> 00:06:15,250
in the beginning of the jump than it is

142
00:06:15,250 --> 00:06:17,810
whenever it's reaching the highest point

143
00:06:17,810 --> 00:06:19,770
meaning that on frame seven,

144
00:06:19,770 --> 00:06:22,610
the ball will go faster than on frame 10,

145
00:06:22,610 --> 00:06:24,850
which is what we want because the ball

146
00:06:24,850 --> 00:06:27,360
is leaving the ground at full speed.

147
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:32,240
So it will reach its mid-air
position before frame nine.

148
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:37,000
And when falling down it will
be at full speed on frame 24.

149
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:40,960
So it should be mid-air,
closer to frame 24,

150
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:42,420
than frame 14.

151
00:06:42,420 --> 00:06:45,730
I know spacing can be a
bit complicated when you

152
00:06:45,730 --> 00:06:47,120
are on the blocking stage

153
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:49,227
and it will be way more obvious

154
00:06:49,227 --> 00:06:50,830
in the next video.

155
00:06:50,830 --> 00:06:53,340
To summarize, during the blocking stage,

156
00:06:53,340 --> 00:06:56,270
we key frame the extreme poses,

157
00:06:56,270 --> 00:06:58,210
we make a rough timing paths,

158
00:06:58,210 --> 00:06:59,667
we can use breakdowns and

159
00:06:59,667 --> 00:07:04,667
in-between to input more
spacing and timing informations.

160
00:07:05,060 --> 00:07:09,330
We can use squash and
stretch to input speed

161
00:07:09,330 --> 00:07:11,153
and physical information.
