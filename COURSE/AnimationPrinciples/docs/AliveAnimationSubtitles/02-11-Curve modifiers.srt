1
00:00:00,920 --> 00:00:03,460
- In this video, we will have an overview

2
00:00:03,460 --> 00:00:05,260
of all the curve modified.

3
00:00:05,260 --> 00:00:09,390
In the graph-editor, whenever
I select a curve, I can access

4
00:00:09,390 --> 00:00:13,930
the modifier in the end
panel or properties panel.

5
00:00:13,930 --> 00:00:17,750
Why do we have already
set a cycle modifier

6
00:00:17,750 --> 00:00:19,270
in the preview video?

7
00:00:19,270 --> 00:00:21,200
What you may haven't noticed

8
00:00:21,200 --> 00:00:26,090
is that we already using
modifiers prior to this.

9
00:00:26,090 --> 00:00:30,050
As soon as we have used
the extrapolation mode

10
00:00:30,050 --> 00:00:34,900
whenever we press the shift +
E and make our curve cyclic,

11
00:00:34,900 --> 00:00:38,620
basically, we were
adding a cycle modifier.

12
00:00:38,620 --> 00:00:42,024
Any modifier influence can be activated

13
00:00:42,024 --> 00:00:45,060
or deactivated by clicking the checkbox.

14
00:00:45,060 --> 00:00:47,830
The circle modifier repeat the animation

15
00:00:47,830 --> 00:00:50,930
from the first key to the last key.

16
00:00:50,930 --> 00:00:54,650
We can change the modifier
behavior before the first key

17
00:00:54,650 --> 00:00:56,920
and after the first key, by default

18
00:00:56,920 --> 00:00:59,570
it's repeating the animation as it is.

19
00:00:59,570 --> 00:01:04,570
We can get rid of the cycle
or use the cycle we've offset.

20
00:01:04,770 --> 00:01:06,180
If I use it right now,

21
00:01:06,180 --> 00:01:10,310
nothing will happen because
it uses the position

22
00:01:10,310 --> 00:01:13,840
of the last key frame as
the new starting point.

23
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:15,140
But since my first

24
00:01:15,140 --> 00:01:18,470
and last key frame are
same, it doesn't change.

25
00:01:18,470 --> 00:01:22,500
But as soon as I offset the
value of the last key frame,

26
00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:26,170
you can see that I get
some kind of ladder motion.

27
00:01:26,170 --> 00:01:29,910
The repeat mirror option
will do what it says.

28
00:01:29,910 --> 00:01:31,660
It will repeat the curve

29
00:01:31,660 --> 00:01:36,470
but each time it will a mirror
it based on the last frame.

30
00:01:36,470 --> 00:01:39,710
Changing the value will
just set the number

31
00:01:39,710 --> 00:01:44,300
of repetition after or before
your current animation.

32
00:01:44,300 --> 00:01:48,390
A value of zero will make
the cycle repeat infinitely.

33
00:01:48,390 --> 00:01:52,540
The restrict frame range
and use-influence properties

34
00:01:52,540 --> 00:01:56,140
are very useful but they
are not the most abuse

35
00:01:56,140 --> 00:01:58,810
on the cycle modifier,
so we will have a look

36
00:01:58,810 --> 00:02:00,390
to it later on.

37
00:02:00,390 --> 00:02:02,680
Let's have a look to the next modifier.

38
00:02:02,680 --> 00:02:05,150
I will get rid of the cycle modifier,

39
00:02:05,150 --> 00:02:07,460
and I add a built-in function.

40
00:02:07,460 --> 00:02:10,230
My animation curve as totally changed.

41
00:02:10,230 --> 00:02:13,490
And we now have a (indistinct) curve

42
00:02:13,490 --> 00:02:15,800
because the default function is seen.

43
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:18,270
The first multiplayer will allow us

44
00:02:18,270 --> 00:02:21,270
to modify the frequency of the curve.

45
00:02:21,270 --> 00:02:25,353
While the amplitude will
allow us to increase the value

46
00:02:25,353 --> 00:02:26,800
of the curve.

47
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:31,800
The first offset will offset
the curve on the X axis

48
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:36,800
while the value offset will
offset the curve on the Y axis.

49
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:39,280
The restricted frame range option

50
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:43,330
is a supercool additional
tool as it is named,

51
00:02:43,330 --> 00:02:46,600
it will allow us to limit or restrict

52
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:50,170
the influence of the
modifier on the frame range.

53
00:02:50,170 --> 00:02:53,900
So we can set this frame range
by tweaking the end value

54
00:02:53,900 --> 00:02:55,400
and the start value.

55
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:59,370
The in and out value
allow us to input easing,

56
00:02:59,370 --> 00:03:03,980
meaning that we can increase
or decrease the influence

57
00:03:03,980 --> 00:03:06,310
of the modifier at the beginning

58
00:03:06,310 --> 00:03:09,050
and the end of the frame range.

59
00:03:09,050 --> 00:03:12,930
This way we can totally modify
the behavior of the ball

60
00:03:12,930 --> 00:03:16,420
with a non-destructive
workflow because I'm not

61
00:03:16,420 --> 00:03:19,230
currently working on any of the key frame,

62
00:03:19,230 --> 00:03:22,070
but only on the modifiers
of that I can add

63
00:03:22,070 --> 00:03:24,610
or remove. By default The modifier

64
00:03:24,610 --> 00:03:27,730
is replacing our current animation

65
00:03:27,730 --> 00:03:30,530
but enabling the additive option

66
00:03:30,530 --> 00:03:35,530
will add the modifier behavior
on top of our animation.

67
00:03:35,970 --> 00:03:39,930
So setting the amplitude
of the modifier to zero is

68
00:03:39,930 --> 00:03:43,430
like removing it when
it's in additive mode.

69
00:03:43,430 --> 00:03:46,620
And as soon as I increased its amplitude,

70
00:03:46,620 --> 00:03:49,240
you can see Oh, it's affecting the curve.

71
00:03:49,240 --> 00:03:51,380
While it works for the specific case,

72
00:03:51,380 --> 00:03:53,410
this is not the best way to play

73
00:03:53,410 --> 00:03:55,670
with the influence of the modifier.

74
00:03:55,670 --> 00:03:59,480
Fortunately, we have an influence
factor that will increase

75
00:03:59,480 --> 00:04:02,900
or decrease the influence of
the modifier on our curve.

76
00:04:02,900 --> 00:04:06,520
The dropdown menu upon the
additive would enable us

77
00:04:06,520 --> 00:04:08,750
to change the type of functions.

78
00:04:08,750 --> 00:04:12,170
So if you remember your
trigonometry classes

79
00:04:12,170 --> 00:04:13,540
you might recognize

80
00:04:13,540 --> 00:04:15,590
the tangent causing an (indistinct) curve

81
00:04:16,510 --> 00:04:20,530
This square root is a
simple exponential function.

82
00:04:20,530 --> 00:04:25,080
So you can use it to make
your ball rise like a balloon,

83
00:04:25,080 --> 00:04:26,950
with a constant easing,

84
00:04:26,950 --> 00:04:31,730
the natural logarithm does
look like the square root

85
00:04:31,730 --> 00:04:35,130
but it has a slight
offset and it ease more.

86
00:04:35,130 --> 00:04:39,760
Finally, the normalized scene
looks like the scene function

87
00:04:39,760 --> 00:04:42,090
but it does ease very rapidly.

88
00:04:42,090 --> 00:04:43,600
So you can change this

89
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:47,580
by moving the phase offset
and the phase multiplier.

90
00:04:47,580 --> 00:04:50,840
So it can be hard to find a specific shoes

91
00:04:50,840 --> 00:04:52,570
for those modifiers,

92
00:04:52,570 --> 00:04:54,690
but you have to experiment with it.

93
00:04:54,690 --> 00:04:57,100
And when you do motion design, for example

94
00:04:57,100 --> 00:05:01,240
they are very useful. When
adding the envelope modifier,

95
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:04,140
We will see a couple of
dotted lines appearing

96
00:05:04,140 --> 00:05:08,240
in our graph-editor lying
with minus one and one value.

97
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:12,630
These are scaling values or
reference values, if you will.

98
00:05:12,630 --> 00:05:15,700
I will just a couple of
points at the beginning

99
00:05:15,700 --> 00:05:19,380
and the end of my curve. Those
control points will allow me

100
00:05:19,380 --> 00:05:22,330
to change the overall shape of my curve,

101
00:05:22,330 --> 00:05:24,300
also known as envelope.

102
00:05:24,300 --> 00:05:26,500
Those control points are defined

103
00:05:26,500 --> 00:05:28,890
by a minimum and maximum value

104
00:05:28,890 --> 00:05:32,940
that appears as little white
dot on the graph-editor,

105
00:05:32,940 --> 00:05:36,460
they represent the current
scale of the modifier.

106
00:05:36,460 --> 00:05:38,880
So, if I tweak the maximum value,

107
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:42,540
I will see my curve scaling up and down,

108
00:05:42,540 --> 00:05:45,010
and we can clearly see the max point

109
00:05:45,010 --> 00:05:47,810
of the envelope modifier moving here.

110
00:05:47,810 --> 00:05:50,930
So it might look a bit abstract right now,

111
00:05:50,930 --> 00:05:55,330
so what I will do is that
I will make the bonding box

112
00:05:55,330 --> 00:06:00,330
in a way of my envelop
modifier as big as the curve.

113
00:06:00,500 --> 00:06:03,790
To do so I will set the
minimum value to zero

114
00:06:03,790 --> 00:06:06,234
like the minimum value of my key frame

115
00:06:06,234 --> 00:06:10,360
and the maximum value around
eight, like my key frame.

116
00:06:10,360 --> 00:06:12,970
I will add a couple of control points

117
00:06:12,970 --> 00:06:17,490
and I will give them the
same value, zero and 8.4.

118
00:06:17,490 --> 00:06:19,486
Now you can think of your curve

119
00:06:19,486 --> 00:06:22,400
as being bound by your lattice modifier

120
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:25,240
or being transformed as in Photoshop,

121
00:06:25,240 --> 00:06:27,400
we've an even transform.

122
00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:30,270
And by moving the value
of the control point,

123
00:06:30,270 --> 00:06:33,730
it's like moving the
corners of the bonding box.

124
00:06:33,730 --> 00:06:34,563
And as into a lattice

125
00:06:34,563 --> 00:06:37,500
we can add more than two control point.

126
00:06:37,500 --> 00:06:38,929
I can add a control point

127
00:06:38,929 --> 00:06:42,910
in the middle set its
default value as the other.

128
00:06:42,910 --> 00:06:44,010
And when I move it,

129
00:06:44,010 --> 00:06:48,340
it will break the curve and
deform it from its position.

130
00:06:48,340 --> 00:06:52,210
Very powerful modifier
to modify the amplitude

131
00:06:52,210 --> 00:06:56,210
of the motion. The noise
modifier is one of my favorite.

132
00:06:56,210 --> 00:06:58,890
And guess what? It noise to your curve.

133
00:06:58,890 --> 00:07:01,210
It's perfect to create camera shake

134
00:07:01,210 --> 00:07:03,280
Or if you are a shaky character

135
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:07,140
you can use the noise
modifier instead of Nkit.

136
00:07:07,140 --> 00:07:10,070
The scale will change the
frequency of the noise,

137
00:07:10,070 --> 00:07:14,070
the phase we kind of change
its shape or it seeds.

138
00:07:14,070 --> 00:07:17,080
The strength is the
amplitude of the noise,

139
00:07:17,080 --> 00:07:20,450
the depth value is the
smoothness of the noise.

140
00:07:20,450 --> 00:07:23,090
To see it properly, I
will increase the scale

141
00:07:23,090 --> 00:07:24,060
and the strength.

142
00:07:24,060 --> 00:07:25,880
As I reduce the depth value,

143
00:07:25,880 --> 00:07:28,010
you can see the curves smoothing.

144
00:07:28,010 --> 00:07:30,930
The offset, allows you to offset the noise

145
00:07:30,930 --> 00:07:33,991
on the X axis or in time, if you prefer.

146
00:07:33,991 --> 00:07:38,420
So, using the noise modifier
and the restrict frame range,

147
00:07:38,420 --> 00:07:41,050
I can create a slight shaking

148
00:07:41,050 --> 00:07:43,280
of the ball whenever it lands.

149
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:48,100
The limits modifier works a
bit as a limit constraint.

150
00:07:48,100 --> 00:07:52,370
Setting a minimum Y value
and maximum Y value,

151
00:07:52,370 --> 00:07:54,600
will clump the value of the curve.

152
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:58,480
Any value beneath the minimum
value will be ignored,

153
00:07:58,480 --> 00:08:02,200
any value upon the maximum
value will be ignored.

154
00:08:02,200 --> 00:08:04,040
It's like creating a roof

155
00:08:04,040 --> 00:08:08,260
and the ground that will bond
your curve while the minimum X

156
00:08:08,260 --> 00:08:13,260
and maximum X value will
currently ignore any values

157
00:08:13,310 --> 00:08:18,310
that is before the set frame
or after the maximum set frame.

158
00:08:19,430 --> 00:08:22,810
So, what if I set the
X maximum value to 10,

159
00:08:22,810 --> 00:08:27,170
any key frame value after
the frame 10 will be ignored.

160
00:08:27,170 --> 00:08:29,530
This can be very useful if, for example,

161
00:08:29,530 --> 00:08:32,490
you don't want the ball
to go under the ground.

162
00:08:32,490 --> 00:08:35,783
The next modifier is the stepped modifier,

163
00:08:35,783 --> 00:08:39,110
it's a very cool and intuitive modifier.

164
00:08:39,110 --> 00:08:42,310
The step size allow you
to change the length

165
00:08:42,310 --> 00:08:45,250
in frame of the step in your animation.

166
00:08:45,250 --> 00:08:49,410
So, basically, this modifier
is converting your curve

167
00:08:49,410 --> 00:08:52,190
as if we were blocking our animation

168
00:08:52,190 --> 00:08:53,917
with constant interpolation

169
00:08:53,917 --> 00:08:57,260
and it gives a fantastic stop motion style

170
00:08:57,260 --> 00:08:58,670
to your animation.

171
00:08:58,670 --> 00:09:01,100
So you can change the step size value,

172
00:09:01,100 --> 00:09:03,086
you can offset it in time.

173
00:09:03,086 --> 00:09:04,970
And this modifier comes

174
00:09:04,970 --> 00:09:08,573
with a built-in starting
frame and ending frame.

175
00:09:08,573 --> 00:09:11,260
It's a bit like the frame restrict range

176
00:09:11,260 --> 00:09:15,380
but you can consider it as an
additional restriction layer.

177
00:09:15,380 --> 00:09:16,570
On the full character,

178
00:09:16,570 --> 00:09:20,160
we will need to add this
modifier on every single curve.

179
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:24,850
What we can do instead is add
the modifier on the NLA strip.

180
00:09:24,850 --> 00:09:29,090
Don't worry. We'll talk about
the NLA editor later on,

181
00:09:29,090 --> 00:09:31,430
but just consider that
we're applying the modifier

182
00:09:31,430 --> 00:09:35,210
to the wall animation
instead of applying it

183
00:09:35,210 --> 00:09:36,570
to a simple curve.

184
00:09:36,570 --> 00:09:38,600
If we have a loop to this quick animation,

185
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:39,980
I've made with one

186
00:09:39,980 --> 00:09:43,080
of my students, the
step modify your really

187
00:09:43,080 --> 00:09:46,440
brings the stop motion
feelings to the animation.

188
00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:51,210
As explained before those
modifier act as object modifiers.

189
00:09:51,210 --> 00:09:53,350
It means that they can be layered,

190
00:09:53,350 --> 00:09:56,530
you can add multiple curve modifiers to

191
00:09:56,530 --> 00:09:59,460
get different results and the order

192
00:09:59,460 --> 00:10:02,970
in which you stack those
modifier is important.

193
00:10:02,970 --> 00:10:07,650
If I add the limit modifier
before the noise modifier,

194
00:10:07,650 --> 00:10:10,461
the noise will be applied after the limit

195
00:10:10,461 --> 00:10:13,280
and so I won't see any difference.

196
00:10:13,280 --> 00:10:15,710
I won't see the limits applied.

197
00:10:15,710 --> 00:10:19,813
At the time I'm recording
this video on blender 2.91,

198
00:10:20,910 --> 00:10:23,930
I haven't find any way
to move the position

199
00:10:23,930 --> 00:10:25,680
of those curve modifier.

200
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:28,210
Hopefully this will be updated whenever

201
00:10:28,210 --> 00:10:30,910
you will be able to watch this video.

202
00:10:30,910 --> 00:10:33,800
We can copy a modifier by clicking

203
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:37,920
on the little folder icon
with the arrow getting inside.

204
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:42,180
To paste the modifier on another
curve just select two curve

205
00:10:42,180 --> 00:10:44,370
and click the second icon

206
00:10:44,370 --> 00:10:47,870
with the folder shape and
the arrow, getting out.

207
00:10:47,870 --> 00:10:50,000
If you have multiple modifiers,

208
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:53,660
they will be all copy and
pasted onto the curve.

209
00:10:53,660 --> 00:10:55,200
To summarize, we have seen

210
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:59,319
that we can use modifier
to modify our curve

211
00:10:59,319 --> 00:11:04,000
behavior procedurally and
in a non-destructive manner.

212
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,380
Modifier can be stacked one

213
00:11:06,380 --> 00:11:10,200
on each other to get more advanced result.

214
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:12,040
Modifiers can be copied

215
00:11:12,040 --> 00:11:15,000
and pasted from one curve to the other.

216
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,660
We can add the modifiers

217
00:11:16,660 --> 00:11:20,417
on the whole action for the NLA editor.
