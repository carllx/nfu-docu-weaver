00:00:00,820 --> 00:00:01,740
- [Instructor] In this video,

2
00:00:01,740 --> 00:00:04,600
we will start polishing our walk cycle.

3
00:00:04,600 --> 00:00:07,420
As following cycle, we will apply

4
00:00:07,420 --> 00:00:10,150
some kind of layered method,

5
00:00:10,150 --> 00:00:13,680
meaning that we will start
by polishing the feet,

6
00:00:13,680 --> 00:00:16,310
then the root of the torso,

7
00:00:16,310 --> 00:00:19,190
and then the different
features of the body.

8
00:00:19,190 --> 00:00:21,400
As explained in the previous video,

9
00:00:21,400 --> 00:00:25,080
we may have to change the
timing of this animation.

10
00:00:25,080 --> 00:00:28,690
Vanillia cycle is generally
around one second,

11
00:00:28,690 --> 00:00:30,360
maybe a little more,

12
00:00:30,360 --> 00:00:33,730
since I'm animating a 30 frame per second.

13
00:00:33,730 --> 00:00:37,800
A current animation is about 0.8 seconds.

14
00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:39,960
To get a better feeling about this,

15
00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:43,410
I will select all my keys
and I will switch to Bezier

16
00:00:43,410 --> 00:00:45,230
by pressing the T key.

17
00:00:45,230 --> 00:00:46,920
Oh when I played the animation,

18
00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:49,940
it definitely feels a bit too fast.

19
00:00:49,940 --> 00:00:53,450
What I want to do is push
the length of this animation

20
00:00:53,450 --> 00:00:55,930
a little over 30 frame.

21
00:00:55,930 --> 00:00:58,370
Let's try 32 frame.

22
00:00:58,370 --> 00:01:03,020
So I will set the end of
the animation on frame 31.

23
00:01:03,020 --> 00:01:07,350
Now, with all my keys selected,
I will put to play head

24
00:01:07,350 --> 00:01:10,200
on frame 0 and press S scale

25
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:14,223
til the latest keys are
aligned with frame 32.

26
00:01:15,410 --> 00:01:19,800
This way, all the keys have
been offset by one frame.

27
00:01:19,800 --> 00:01:23,200
I now have a key pose every four frames.

28
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:26,463
My walk cycle rhythm
looks way more natural.

29
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:30,250
With my amateur in pose mode,

30
00:01:30,250 --> 00:01:33,770
I will select the foot and
I will press control tab

31
00:01:33,770 --> 00:01:38,110
over the action editor to
switch to the graph editor.

32
00:01:38,110 --> 00:01:41,870
I will then click to
show selected only icon.

33
00:01:41,870 --> 00:01:44,350
We will start by idling all the curve

34
00:01:44,350 --> 00:01:46,330
but the location curves.

35
00:01:46,330 --> 00:01:49,830
Whether you're working on
the run or a walk cycle,

36
00:01:49,830 --> 00:01:52,650
the first thing you want is to fix

37
00:01:52,650 --> 00:01:55,800
whenever the feet is in
contact with the ground.

38
00:01:55,800 --> 00:01:58,420
This the contacting
foot is supposed to move

39
00:01:58,420 --> 00:02:00,120
at a constant speed.

40
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:02,410
You need a linear interpolation

41
00:02:02,410 --> 00:02:04,640
between the first contacting frame

42
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:06,990
and the last contacting frame.

43
00:02:06,990 --> 00:02:10,230
In our case, between frame 0 and frame 20.

44
00:02:10,230 --> 00:02:12,660
You can easily get to this result

45
00:02:12,660 --> 00:02:16,740
by converting the key frames
on those contacting pose

46
00:02:16,740 --> 00:02:19,450
to vector using the V key,

47
00:02:19,450 --> 00:02:23,190
and then we can get rid of
all the key frame in between.

48
00:02:23,190 --> 00:02:26,630
The same then apply to the Z and X key,

49
00:02:26,630 --> 00:02:30,220
won't be any up and down
or side to side motion

50
00:02:30,220 --> 00:02:32,210
while the foot is on the ground.

51
00:02:32,210 --> 00:02:35,030
Select the Z and X curve keys

52
00:02:35,030 --> 00:02:38,130
and I will press the dot key to zoom in.

53
00:02:38,130 --> 00:02:42,650
There should be no variation
between frame 0 and frame 20

54
00:02:42,650 --> 00:02:46,130
so I will simply duplicate frame 12,

55
00:02:46,130 --> 00:02:48,500
which is the same as frame 20,

56
00:02:48,500 --> 00:02:53,270
and move it by pressing
G and X on the x-axis

57
00:02:53,270 --> 00:02:55,250
toward frame 20.

58
00:02:55,250 --> 00:02:58,380
Pressing the V key, I can
transform the end-alls

59
00:02:58,380 --> 00:03:01,210
on frame 0 and frame 20 to vector

60
00:03:01,210 --> 00:03:03,950
and get rid of all the keys in between.

61
00:03:03,950 --> 00:03:05,850
And here we have fixed our curve

62
00:03:05,850 --> 00:03:08,440
whenever the foot is in
contact with the ground,

63
00:03:08,440 --> 00:03:10,440
a little detail here.

64
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:13,090
Since I have created this animation

65
00:03:13,090 --> 00:03:16,250
by duplicating our run cycle,

66
00:03:16,250 --> 00:03:20,470
we can see that we have a loop
modifier or cycling modifier

67
00:03:20,470 --> 00:03:24,840
onto our curve and they
do repeat over time.

68
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:28,330
I select all the curve,
I can press shift E

69
00:03:28,330 --> 00:03:32,230
and use a clear cyclic
modifier to get rid of it.

70
00:03:32,230 --> 00:03:35,000
But since we are walking on a cycle,

71
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,690
it does make sense to keep the modifier.

72
00:03:37,690 --> 00:03:42,690
So I will press shift E and
select make cyclic again.

73
00:03:42,760 --> 00:03:45,030
Before I start polishing the curve,

74
00:03:45,030 --> 00:03:47,410
I will calculate the motion path.

75
00:03:47,410 --> 00:03:50,380
Use the foot controller
as a reference point

76
00:03:50,380 --> 00:03:52,900
or you can choose the toe controllers.

77
00:03:52,900 --> 00:03:55,400
As explained before, I will press Q

78
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:59,240
to calculate the motion
path since I've made it

79
00:03:59,240 --> 00:04:02,980
one of my quick favorite,
and I'm calculating it

80
00:04:02,980 --> 00:04:05,500
over frame 0 to 32.

81
00:04:05,500 --> 00:04:07,500
Before I jump into polishing,

82
00:04:07,500 --> 00:04:11,550
I've tracked the motion of
the foot on the reference.

83
00:04:11,550 --> 00:04:14,220
And before whenever the foot
is contacting the ground,

84
00:04:14,220 --> 00:04:17,210
it's moving with a linear fashion.

85
00:04:17,210 --> 00:04:20,410
Then we can see an ease in and ease out

86
00:04:20,410 --> 00:04:23,070
whenever it's starting to raise.

87
00:04:23,070 --> 00:04:26,130
It's accelerating until the passing pose

88
00:04:26,130 --> 00:04:28,720
but also losing altitude.

89
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:30,860
And then, it raise again,

90
00:04:30,860 --> 00:04:34,663
go a little beyond the
contact pose and fall.

91
00:04:35,560 --> 00:04:37,980
On the run cycle, we will polish one foot

92
00:04:37,980 --> 00:04:41,550
and then we will mirror the
animation onto the other one.

93
00:04:41,550 --> 00:04:45,720
To help myself, I will go in
front of you and press Alt B

94
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:48,210
and frame off of the character

95
00:04:48,210 --> 00:04:50,870
so that I see only the left foot,

96
00:04:50,870 --> 00:04:53,480
the one I'm going to work on.

97
00:04:53,480 --> 00:04:57,110
From there, let's start polishing
the location of the foot.

98
00:04:57,110 --> 00:04:59,840
I will start with the Y location.

99
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:03,720
As usual, I will display the
polish curve as a reference.

100
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:05,040
In studying the reference,

101
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:08,220
we've seen that the foot
was traveling a bit backward

102
00:05:08,220 --> 00:05:09,320
when leaving the ground.

103
00:05:09,320 --> 00:05:13,220
So I'm pushing a bit the curve on frame 22

104
00:05:13,220 --> 00:05:15,540
as if it was some kind of overshoot.

105
00:05:15,540 --> 00:05:20,360
We get a smooth arc in the
curve and then an acceleration

106
00:05:20,360 --> 00:05:23,130
toward the next contacting pose.

107
00:05:23,130 --> 00:05:25,380
And as shown in the reference,

108
00:05:25,380 --> 00:05:29,350
the foot travels a bit further
than the contacting pose

109
00:05:29,350 --> 00:05:31,343
before contacting on frame 32.

110
00:05:32,260 --> 00:05:36,170
So the value of the curve
on frame 31 is lower,

111
00:05:36,170 --> 00:05:39,830
so further forward than on frame 32.

112
00:05:39,830 --> 00:05:42,330
We'll go back in the front of view,

113
00:05:42,330 --> 00:05:44,560
press Q to access my quick favorite

114
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:46,650
and update the motion path.

115
00:05:46,650 --> 00:05:49,600
We now need to work on the
up and down of the foot.

116
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:53,050
As you can see, it's very
linear for the time being.

117
00:05:53,050 --> 00:05:56,870
As seen in the reference, the
highest point for the foot

118
00:05:56,870 --> 00:05:59,510
is going to be just
after leaving the ground

119
00:05:59,510 --> 00:06:01,660
and just before hitting the ground.

120
00:06:01,660 --> 00:06:04,620
I'm raising the control point on frame 24

121
00:06:04,620 --> 00:06:07,933
and then I will lower it
next to the passing pose.

122
00:06:07,933 --> 00:06:11,140
We want the toes to
almost touch the ground.

123
00:06:11,140 --> 00:06:16,140
I will move the previous extreme
up from from 24 to frame 23

124
00:06:16,140 --> 00:06:18,400
to have a smoother motion.

125
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:21,840
I will also move the
next extreme on frame 30

126
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:26,140
so that the foot gets high
and then slap onto the ground.

127
00:06:26,140 --> 00:06:29,150
And now we can see that
we have a motion path

128
00:06:29,150 --> 00:06:33,170
that is very close to what
we had on the reference.

129
00:06:33,170 --> 00:06:36,000
Note that the keys on
the contacting frames

130
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:39,090
all have their end-alls set to vectors

131
00:06:39,090 --> 00:06:41,120
so that we don't have any easing

132
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:43,250
when the foot is leaving the ground

133
00:06:43,250 --> 00:06:45,880
or when it's contacting the ground.

134
00:06:45,880 --> 00:06:48,370
We can now switch to front view,

135
00:06:48,370 --> 00:06:50,680
editing the left to right motion

136
00:06:50,680 --> 00:06:52,800
is going to be pretty straightforward.

137
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:54,890
I will frame the curve

138
00:06:54,890 --> 00:06:57,807
and I will give it a
little parabolic shape,

139
00:06:57,807 --> 00:07:02,140
making sure that the foot is
at its extreme on the side

140
00:07:02,140 --> 00:07:05,150
that whenever we are
hitting the passing pose.

141
00:07:05,150 --> 00:07:07,490
We are starting to get decent results

142
00:07:07,490 --> 00:07:11,010
regarding the location
of this foot controller.

143
00:07:11,010 --> 00:07:13,260
Let's work on the foot roll.

144
00:07:13,260 --> 00:07:15,880
I prefer to start walking on the rotation

145
00:07:15,880 --> 00:07:18,210
using the heel controller

146
00:07:18,210 --> 00:07:21,690
because it's the main rotation
controller of the foot,

147
00:07:21,690 --> 00:07:23,980
at least on the walk cycle.

148
00:07:23,980 --> 00:07:27,510
And then, I will get
back on the foot to tweak

149
00:07:27,510 --> 00:07:30,900
and input some subtle
rotation to the foot.

150
00:07:30,900 --> 00:07:33,690
To touch the ground, the
foot should be slapping.

151
00:07:33,690 --> 00:07:37,330
Though, I want a fast motion
between the contacting pose

152
00:07:37,330 --> 00:07:40,100
and the flat foot position.

153
00:07:40,100 --> 00:07:42,850
So I will offset the
key with a value of zero

154
00:07:42,850 --> 00:07:46,600
on the frame 1 and I will
switch the end-all to vector.

155
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:49,010
This way, the foot is
getting flat on the ground

156
00:07:49,010 --> 00:07:51,840
over one frame with a clean curve.

157
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:55,040
After the passing pose
when the heel is raising,

158
00:07:55,040 --> 00:07:57,760
I want a slight acceleration.

159
00:07:57,760 --> 00:08:01,850
So I want my curve to look
more like a parabolic one.

160
00:08:01,850 --> 00:08:04,030
Also, I need to offset a bit

161
00:08:04,030 --> 00:08:06,840
the moment the heels start to raise.

162
00:08:06,840 --> 00:08:09,260
It's just after the passing pose,

163
00:08:09,260 --> 00:08:12,100
around frame 10, not frame 8.

164
00:08:12,100 --> 00:08:14,180
I will fix this a little later.

165
00:08:14,180 --> 00:08:16,300
Right now, I'm just pushing the pose

166
00:08:16,300 --> 00:08:20,460
to make sure that the foot
has a smoother motion.

167
00:08:20,460 --> 00:08:21,740
I want to hold a bit the pose

168
00:08:21,740 --> 00:08:23,410
where the foot is pointing down.

169
00:08:23,410 --> 00:08:28,410
So I will duplicate the
key on frame 24 to frame 25

170
00:08:28,750 --> 00:08:31,210
and create a slight plateau.

171
00:08:31,210 --> 00:08:35,010
Then I want to create the
flapping or whipping motion,

172
00:08:35,010 --> 00:08:38,140
meaning that the toes will get higher

173
00:08:38,140 --> 00:08:40,750
just before they hit the ground.

174
00:08:40,750 --> 00:08:43,450
So I need to push the curve down

175
00:08:43,450 --> 00:08:46,180
just before the contacting pose.

176
00:08:46,180 --> 00:08:49,400
From there, I will kind
of fine tune each pose.

177
00:08:49,400 --> 00:08:51,340
It's more about motion feeling,

178
00:08:51,340 --> 00:08:53,840
that's something I can't really explain.

179
00:08:53,840 --> 00:08:57,290
And I will fix the moment the heel raise

180
00:08:57,290 --> 00:09:00,860
by delaying it by two frames.

181
00:09:00,860 --> 00:09:03,900
Next, we are going to
work on the X rotation

182
00:09:03,900 --> 00:09:06,090
of the main toe controller.

183
00:09:06,090 --> 00:09:09,060
We're going to have the same behavior

184
00:09:09,060 --> 00:09:11,980
as the tale of this hero character.

185
00:09:11,980 --> 00:09:16,530
It will have a subtle
overlapping or full of emotion.

186
00:09:16,530 --> 00:09:18,900
In this case, we will be only animating

187
00:09:18,900 --> 00:09:21,730
the axialer rotation of the toes.

188
00:09:21,730 --> 00:09:23,090
It's very simple.

189
00:09:23,090 --> 00:09:25,530
We want the toes to slightly drag.

190
00:09:25,530 --> 00:09:27,800
So basically, you want them

191
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:30,993
to point toward their previous position.

192
00:09:31,890 --> 00:09:35,370
As the foot flap on the
ground and is getting flat,

193
00:09:35,370 --> 00:09:37,830
I will slightly raise the toes.

194
00:09:37,830 --> 00:09:39,930
Then later, I will make them flat

195
00:09:39,930 --> 00:09:42,543
and then switch their end-alls to vector.

196
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:46,980
Then working on the moment
the foot leave the ground,

197
00:09:46,980 --> 00:09:50,030
I will switch the end-all
on frame 20 to vector

198
00:09:50,030 --> 00:09:54,020
to make sure that the rotation
of the toes is accelerating

199
00:09:54,020 --> 00:09:56,050
as they are pulled backward.

200
00:09:56,050 --> 00:09:59,460
And I will make sure I have
some dragging of the toes

201
00:09:59,460 --> 00:10:02,830
until frame 30, not bending them too much

202
00:10:02,830 --> 00:10:05,080
or the motion too stylized

203
00:10:05,080 --> 00:10:07,480
and the foot will look very loose.

204
00:10:07,480 --> 00:10:11,150
And as I a hard time
getting the right position

205
00:10:11,150 --> 00:10:13,210
for the toes on frame 30,

206
00:10:13,210 --> 00:10:18,150
it's simply add another key
frame here and animate on ones.

207
00:10:18,150 --> 00:10:21,990
Animating on ones means
that you add a key frame

208
00:10:21,990 --> 00:10:25,550
or drawing on each single frames.

209
00:10:25,550 --> 00:10:28,230
It's perfect when you
have a complex motion

210
00:10:28,230 --> 00:10:31,470
on very few frame to key each frame

211
00:10:31,470 --> 00:10:34,040
and work each poses, one by one.

212
00:10:34,040 --> 00:10:38,320
With our toes now polished,
we can switch back to the foot

213
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:40,400
and work a bit on its rotation.

214
00:10:40,400 --> 00:10:42,870
We will keep it simple and only work

215
00:10:42,870 --> 00:10:45,280
on the Z quadrillion rotation.

216
00:10:45,280 --> 00:10:49,280
Foot motion when going into
details can be very complex.

217
00:10:49,280 --> 00:10:52,130
We want to push the
level of realism further.

218
00:10:52,130 --> 00:10:55,000
You need to study your
reference frame by frame.

219
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:58,610
Check out which part of the
foot is contacting first,

220
00:10:58,610 --> 00:11:01,080
whether the weight is more on the edge,

221
00:11:01,080 --> 00:11:03,690
on the middle of the foot,
on the ball of the foot,

222
00:11:03,690 --> 00:11:06,630
et cetera, is there any squashing

223
00:11:06,630 --> 00:11:09,740
or slight shaking motion of the ankle?

224
00:11:09,740 --> 00:11:13,080
All those subtle movement
brings what we call texture

225
00:11:13,080 --> 00:11:17,490
to the animation and we'll make
your animation looks less CG

226
00:11:17,490 --> 00:11:19,120
and more subtle.

227
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:22,370
So in the end, I'm just
slightly pushing the rotation

228
00:11:22,370 --> 00:11:24,760
we have already input during the blocking.

229
00:11:24,760 --> 00:11:28,540
And I will just input a bit
of rotation toward the inside

230
00:11:28,540 --> 00:11:31,720
when the foot is leaving the
ground and toward the outside

231
00:11:31,720 --> 00:11:36,043
when the foot is getting
to the next contact pose.

232
00:11:36,043 --> 00:11:39,270
This will translate the fact
that there is more pressure

233
00:11:39,270 --> 00:11:42,800
under the big toe when the
foot is leaving the ground.

234
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:47,800
While we favorize weight over
the outer edge of the foot

235
00:11:48,310 --> 00:11:49,860
when contacting.

236
00:11:49,860 --> 00:11:53,320
It's a subtle weight transfer
from the outside of the foot

237
00:11:53,320 --> 00:11:55,440
to the inside of the foot,

238
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:58,610
between the contacting
pose and the pushing pose.

239
00:11:58,610 --> 00:12:02,440
So we can translate this by
inputting a bit of rotation

240
00:12:02,440 --> 00:12:06,800
when the foot is leaving the
ground toward the inside.

241
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:09,560
This is not a golden
rule because it will vary

242
00:12:09,560 --> 00:12:12,740
from people to people
based on your weight,

243
00:12:12,740 --> 00:12:16,520
the size of your hips, your
orientation of your knees,

244
00:12:16,520 --> 00:12:18,710
even a subtle foot rotation

245
00:12:18,710 --> 00:12:21,233
will bring personality to your character.

246
00:12:22,350 --> 00:12:24,470
Before we mirror the animation,

247
00:12:24,470 --> 00:12:27,670
we need to slightly rework the knee.

248
00:12:27,670 --> 00:12:29,880
So basically, we just need to rework

249
00:12:29,880 --> 00:12:33,050
the left to right motion
of the pole targets.

250
00:12:33,050 --> 00:12:35,140
I will just input a bit of delay

251
00:12:35,140 --> 00:12:37,700
based on the rotation of the foot.

252
00:12:37,700 --> 00:12:41,730
Most of the time, your foot
and your knee are aligned.

253
00:12:41,730 --> 00:12:44,150
So when the toe is pointing inward,

254
00:12:44,150 --> 00:12:46,810
I will push the knee in between inward.

255
00:12:46,810 --> 00:12:50,560
And when the toe is pointing
on the outside, guess what?

256
00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:53,660
I will push a bit, the pole
target, on the outside.

257
00:12:53,660 --> 00:12:57,010
The X and Y curve don't
have that much inference,

258
00:12:57,010 --> 00:13:02,010
I prefer to remove any key
frames that are not set to zero.

259
00:13:02,100 --> 00:13:04,750
Once my keys were more or less defined,

260
00:13:04,750 --> 00:13:07,260
I've moved them away one from the other

261
00:13:07,260 --> 00:13:10,260
to get a smoother and slower motion.

262
00:13:10,260 --> 00:13:13,610
With this to avoid any
noisy motion of the knee.

263
00:13:13,610 --> 00:13:16,410
There can be a bit of
noise on the knee motion

264
00:13:16,410 --> 00:13:20,290
during the impact, especially
on the heavy character,

265
00:13:20,290 --> 00:13:22,400
you will use the knee tweaker

266
00:13:22,400 --> 00:13:24,970
and input a bit of up and down motion

267
00:13:24,970 --> 00:13:27,750
whenever the feet are
contacting the ground.

268
00:13:27,750 --> 00:13:30,220
But since our character
is pretty lightweight,

269
00:13:30,220 --> 00:13:32,810
I prefer to keep a
smooth motion of the knee

270
00:13:32,810 --> 00:13:34,990
following the foot.

271
00:13:34,990 --> 00:13:37,410
With the whole leg finally polished,

272
00:13:37,410 --> 00:13:40,470
we can now mirror the
motion onto the other leg.

273
00:13:40,470 --> 00:13:43,610
This is something we have
already done several time

274
00:13:43,610 --> 00:13:46,550
in this course so I guess
you know all to do it,

275
00:13:46,550 --> 00:13:48,620
but I will repeat the process.

276
00:13:48,620 --> 00:13:52,030
I first selected all the
controller of the left leg.

277
00:13:52,030 --> 00:13:54,670
Press Alt H to reveal all the curve

278
00:13:54,670 --> 00:13:57,890
and press A to select them
all, then press control C

279
00:13:57,890 --> 00:13:59,570
to copy those curve.

280
00:13:59,570 --> 00:14:03,090
Then I will select all the
controller of the opposite leg.

281
00:14:03,090 --> 00:14:05,330
I will also press Alt H

282
00:14:05,330 --> 00:14:08,410
to make sure that there
is no curve hiding.

283
00:14:08,410 --> 00:14:11,410
I will select all the keys
but the one on frame 0

284
00:14:11,410 --> 00:14:12,460
and delete them.

285
00:14:12,460 --> 00:14:14,410
Then I will select all the keys

286
00:14:14,410 --> 00:14:16,180
and press control shift to V.

287
00:14:16,180 --> 00:14:19,460
Now, both my legs are moving the same way.

288
00:14:19,460 --> 00:14:23,250
I will press shift to
D to duplicate X and 32

289
00:14:23,250 --> 00:14:25,370
to offset by 32 frame.

290
00:14:25,370 --> 00:14:28,640
That way, I have two
cycle for the right leg

291
00:14:28,640 --> 00:14:32,270
and now I can offset it
back by half the length

292
00:14:32,270 --> 00:14:37,270
of the motion by pressing
G, X, and minus 16.

293
00:14:37,270 --> 00:14:40,170
I have an alternate motion of both legs.

294
00:14:40,170 --> 00:14:43,440
I will go on frame 0
and insert a key frame

295
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:44,910
on all the channels.

296
00:14:44,910 --> 00:14:47,520
Then select those key frame,

297
00:14:47,520 --> 00:14:50,700
press V and switch them to three.

298
00:14:50,700 --> 00:14:53,300
This way their end-all
curvature won't change

299
00:14:53,300 --> 00:14:55,840
if I remove the previous keys.

300
00:14:55,840 --> 00:14:58,740
Then press Shift to D
to duplicate those frame

301
00:14:58,740 --> 00:15:03,740
and move them on frame 30 to
sway the first and last keys

302
00:15:04,080 --> 00:15:07,720
of the cycle of the same
and we can remove any keys

303
00:15:07,720 --> 00:15:11,150
after frame 32 and before frame 0.

304
00:15:11,150 --> 00:15:13,630
And we now have both our legs polished

305
00:15:13,630 --> 00:15:15,690
and we can jump into the next video

306
00:15:15,690 --> 00:15:17,540
where we will be polishing the torso.
