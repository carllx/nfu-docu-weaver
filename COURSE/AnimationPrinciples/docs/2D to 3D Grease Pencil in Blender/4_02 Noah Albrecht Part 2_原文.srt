00:00:03,260 --> 00:00:03,760
Welcome back

2
00:00:03,760 --> 00:00:03,970
everyone

3
00:00:04,300 --> 00:00:05,990
So this is an E specials sex learning

4
00:00:05,990 --> 00:00:08,840
which we can explain how we can do very simple rigs

5
00:00:08,840 --> 00:00:12,010
We have here the main part of the body with the legs

6
00:00:12,050 --> 00:00:15,320
I'm going to explain how we can build simple rigs with Ik

7
00:00:15,330 --> 00:00:18,660
Ik means that we're going to be able to select the position of the leg

8
00:00:18,780 --> 00:00:19,790
moving it around

9
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:21,800
and then the entire body is going to follow

10
00:00:21,930 --> 00:00:24,190
And also we're gonna see how to make the tail after that

11
00:00:24,200 --> 00:00:25,560

12
00:00:25,690 --> 00:00:26,620
Anyone doing this

13
00:00:26,620 --> 00:00:34,270
We recommend first doing an entire course on rigging because I think that that course gives a lot of knowledge about how bones work

14
00:00:34,280 --> 00:00:36,520
But if you want to do a quick break

15
00:00:36,560 --> 00:00:37,590
this might work

16
00:00:37,690 --> 00:00:42,030
So we're going to start by adding an armature is here and a single bone

17
00:00:42,030 --> 00:00:43,140
We only need one bone

18
00:00:43,160 --> 00:00:44,860
I'm going to go to the frontal view

19
00:00:44,900 --> 00:00:48,793
I'm going to go in my transparent mode and the beginning of the bone

20
00:00:48,793 --> 00:00:53,120
it depends on on how you want my chain here is I'm going to start my tail from here

21
00:00:53,130 --> 00:00:57,410
So what I'm going to do is I'm going to rotate my bone there with pressing CT

22
00:00:57,620 --> 00:00:59,930
I do rotations of 5 degrees at a time

23
00:01:00,010 --> 00:01:01,670
And now the cool thing about the bones

24
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:05,830
if we go into edit mode is that they can be treated a bit like any modeling

25
00:01:05,830 --> 00:01:07,130
So if I press E

26
00:01:07,140 --> 00:01:10,150
I can extrude them and I can extrude towards here

27
00:01:10,160 --> 00:01:13,400
And then I can extrude again where to where my head is

28
00:01:14,090 --> 00:01:15,950
If you send the course of rigging with us

29
00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:21,290
you know that sometimes we don't rig with the head included because usually heads are rigid

30
00:01:21,300 --> 00:01:21,910
And in this case

31
00:01:21,910 --> 00:01:23,190
the head is rigid

32
00:01:23,300 --> 00:01:25,520
So what we do is we model entire head

33
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:26,540
then we put it all together

34
00:01:26,630 --> 00:01:28,280
we parent it all together

35
00:01:28,290 --> 00:01:30,500
and then we just attach it to this final bone

36
00:01:30,510 --> 00:01:32,320
So we rotate that final bone

37
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:32,720
the head moves

38
00:01:33,530 --> 00:01:37,180
but it's not getting affected by the weights because I don't like the formations of heads

39
00:01:37,190 --> 00:01:40,010
Yeahunless you are doing the formation of heads

40
00:01:40,030 --> 00:01:41,670
but in most cases we are not

41
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:43,250
Okay

42
00:01:43,260 --> 00:01:44,720
now we're going to start extruding leg

43
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:46,750
So I'm going to go one time there

44
00:01:46,760 --> 00:01:48,510
another time there to the middle

45
00:01:48,520 --> 00:01:49,630
another time down

46
00:01:49,640 --> 00:01:50,740
And now I'm going to do it again

47
00:01:50,760 --> 00:01:51,860
one time

48
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:54,140
one time again there

49
00:01:54,580 --> 00:01:55,560
not the time there

50
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:56,270
By the way

51
00:01:56,270 --> 00:01:57,990
it's possible if you wanted

52
00:01:58,110 --> 00:02:01,930
it's possible to do this extreme applying with a symmetry

53
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,190
but for this case

54
00:02:03,320 --> 00:02:04,110
because it's so simple

55
00:02:04,110 --> 00:02:05,290
we are not doing it with symmetry

56
00:02:06,130 --> 00:02:07,090
And with this one

57
00:02:07,100 --> 00:02:08,240
how did you

58
00:02:08,250 --> 00:02:09,480
how did you decide exactly

59
00:02:09,480 --> 00:02:15,300
Because obviously this moose coming from the 2D is a completely graphical 2D characters

60
00:02:15,300 --> 00:02:16,850
So how do you choose where you want the bones to go

61
00:02:17,030 --> 00:02:17,840
To be honest

62
00:02:17,850 --> 00:02:19,100
when I model this one

63
00:02:19,100 --> 00:02:21,480
because I love so much how they were not in the same position

64
00:02:21,540 --> 00:02:22,750
the other model is not

65
00:02:22,760 --> 00:02:25,240
is even less symmetric than what we are doing right now

66
00:02:25,650 --> 00:02:30,340
So it was completely me just guessing and doing it

67
00:02:30,350 --> 00:02:32,040
and then checking again

68
00:02:32,050 --> 00:02:33,630
and then check again and check again

69
00:02:33,960 --> 00:02:36,110
There was no science at all to it

70
00:02:36,230 --> 00:02:39,200
It's just a pure game of guessing and taking what it works

71
00:02:39,220 --> 00:02:44,700
But it's a good question because I think a lot of times people think that there is much more planning than there is

72
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:47,010
But this has been mainly

73
00:02:47,020 --> 00:02:47,500
you know

74
00:02:47,530 --> 00:02:52,180
trying trial and error to know if you make your own character right now with crazy proportions

75
00:02:52,550 --> 00:03:01,760
But the thing is very important now is that the situation of where the bones are is to be in somehow related to where my cuts are in my geometry

76
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:05,290
And I'm gonna show you because the geometry right now has a subdivision

77
00:03:05,290 --> 00:03:05,870
But in reality

78
00:03:05,870 --> 00:03:07,120
it is a super simple geometry

79
00:03:07,480 --> 00:03:10,460
I'm gonna show you without transparency and I'm gon na go to my edit mode

80
00:03:10,550 --> 00:03:12,160
You see that I made this

81
00:03:12,170 --> 00:03:13,150
it's very simple

82
00:03:13,160 --> 00:03:18,700
but it has some cuts here on the knees and these cuts here on the knees are in these two positions

83
00:03:18,710 --> 00:03:22,720
And if I check my armature and I'm going to try to make it transparent

84
00:03:22,900 --> 00:03:24,050
you see that here

85
00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:25,050
the middle

86
00:03:25,050 --> 00:03:28,340
the circle of my bones needs to be between these lines

87
00:03:28,340 --> 00:03:29,610
These cuts in the middle

88
00:03:29,850 --> 00:03:31,530
the more it is between these lines

89
00:03:31,530 --> 00:03:32,880
the much better it is going to be

90
00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:34,660
because then when it bends

91
00:03:34,750 --> 00:03:43,400
it's going to bend very smoothly while still being a cart that is going to bend animate very well because we don't have that geometry

92
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:46,720
This is the geometry that the weights are going to be playing with

93
00:03:46,870 --> 00:03:50,610
but then it's going to be softened out with a subdivision after

94
00:03:50,810 --> 00:03:51,860
Okaythat makes sense

95
00:03:51,860 --> 00:03:52,550
but in the body

96
00:03:52,550 --> 00:03:59,950
you're not thinking about that then because that would be a much smoother animation in what do you mean in the body

97
00:04:00,010 --> 00:04:03,790
You're not thinking about where you're positioning the weights depending on the cuts that you have in the geometry

98
00:04:04,180 --> 00:04:04,820
Not really

99
00:04:04,820 --> 00:04:05,680
because in the in the

100
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:06,220
in the body

101
00:04:06,410 --> 00:04:06,810
the body

102
00:04:06,810 --> 00:04:07,830
the bones are really

103
00:04:07,830 --> 00:04:08,720
really in the middle

104
00:04:08,730 --> 00:04:12,900
So a bone that I bend here is gonna affect almost all the geometry

105
00:04:12,900 --> 00:04:13,990
Ithe thing on the left

106
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:16,510
the bone is really near the edge

107
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:18,220
And if I just didn't have

108
00:04:18,230 --> 00:04:18,790
iffor example

109
00:04:18,790 --> 00:04:20,500
I had the bone a bit too high up

110
00:04:20,840 --> 00:04:22,120
when it bends

111
00:04:22,230 --> 00:04:26,470
it's going to kind of make the two points collapse against one another and it's going to look very ugly

112
00:04:28,050 --> 00:04:33,330
I think that it's very important in these cases to just do it simple and practice with a really

113
00:04:33,330 --> 00:04:34,840
reallyreally simple geometry

114
00:04:34,890 --> 00:04:36,900
because you're going to understand much better how it works

115
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:38,300
Once we have that

116
00:04:38,520 --> 00:04:41,820
the only thing we need to do is just select my geometry

117
00:04:41,830 --> 00:04:43,500
I'm going to call this body

118
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:46,390
I'm going to select my armature

119
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:52,090
so with Ctrl click I'm going select the armature and then we do right click parent with automatically weights

120
00:04:52,090 --> 00:04:57,800
That means that the program is going to automatically calculate the weights depending on the distance from the bone to the different phases

121
00:04:57,850 --> 00:04:58,520
the geometry

122
00:04:58,530 --> 00:04:59,650
And as soon as I do it

123
00:04:59,770 --> 00:05:00,710
now if I go

124
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:03,820
my geometry goes inside my body goes inside my armature

125
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:05,530
and if I go now into post mode

126
00:05:06,370 --> 00:05:08,530
I can go activate transparency

127
00:05:08,540 --> 00:05:09,700
If I go into post mode

128
00:05:09,710 --> 00:05:11,530
if I rotate any of my bones

129
00:05:11,540 --> 00:05:14,800
you can see that my Carter is basically raked

130
00:05:14,810 --> 00:05:15,240
you know

131
00:05:15,250 --> 00:05:16,670
and it's raking quite well

132
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:17,200
You know

133
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:19,900
it's not perfect here

134
00:05:19,910 --> 00:05:21,400
like you correct this bend

135
00:05:21,540 --> 00:05:24,030
but because we're going to be having a flat shading

136
00:05:24,040 --> 00:05:25,670
this is absolutely not relevant

137
00:05:25,670 --> 00:05:26,670
It's going to look good

138
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:27,910
And if I want as well

139
00:05:27,910 --> 00:05:31,170
I can always go into my body and in object mode

140
00:05:31,180 --> 00:05:35,130
I can select my body and I can add more subdivisions so I can get smoother

141
00:05:35,140 --> 00:05:38,650
But no worries about this not being perfect because then we're gon na

142
00:05:38,650 --> 00:05:41,400
make it all squid with my noise

143
00:05:41,410 --> 00:05:44,150
So I always say this as well to people

144
00:05:44,250 --> 00:05:44,480
you know

145
00:05:44,610 --> 00:05:46,760
only worry I'm gon na do two subdivisions

146
00:05:46,870 --> 00:05:51,650
I only only worry about things and details if they are actually going to be visible

147
00:05:51,690 --> 00:05:52,630
But if they are not

148
00:05:52,640 --> 00:05:53,510
this should be fine

149
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:57,650
And now people are gonna be wondering how do you do

150
00:05:57,650 --> 00:06:00,870
Because if I try not to move this of the bone

151
00:06:01,030 --> 00:06:03,550
this just rotates And people are going to think

152
00:06:03,640 --> 00:06:04,390
how do you do

153
00:06:04,390 --> 00:06:08,690
So you can just have this Ik system in which you select the location of the feet

154
00:06:08,700 --> 00:06:09,640
and then they follow

155
00:06:09,930 --> 00:06:13,410
So we did an inverse kinematic Ik system for that

156
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:15,830
And to do the Ik system

157
00:06:15,830 --> 00:06:20,380
the first thing I need to do is I'm you're going to have to do this leg by leg

158
00:06:20,390 --> 00:06:23,150
but I'm only going to do it with this right front leg

159
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:25,720
And I'm going to generate a couple more bonds

160
00:06:25,730 --> 00:06:29,770
I'm going to go into my edit mode and I'm going to activate transparency

161
00:06:29,770 --> 00:06:30,860
So I know what I'm going to do

162
00:06:31,070 --> 00:06:37,000
And let's make sure that I'm selecting this one in the front and I'm going to do E to generate a new bone

163
00:06:37,220 --> 00:06:39,960
And now I'm going to go to my foot

164
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:43,260
and I'm going to do it again to generate another new bone

165
00:06:43,580 --> 00:06:46,650
So now this new bones I'm going to separate them

166
00:06:46,700 --> 00:06:47,670
If I press split

167
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:48,150
if you see

168
00:06:48,150 --> 00:06:49,510
if I try to move this bone

169
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:50,430
they all follow

170
00:06:50,610 --> 00:06:52,540
But now if I do right click and split

171
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:56,050
now they are separated from the from the entire chain

172
00:06:56,070 --> 00:06:57,740
And I'm going to do that with both of them

173
00:06:58,130 --> 00:07:04,070
So now I have these two independent bones that are floating there that are going to be used as a reference

174
00:07:04,130 --> 00:07:06,280
This one on the top

175
00:07:06,450 --> 00:07:15,060
we're going to put names to know to get confused and we're going to call it poll and this would be right knee in the front

176
00:07:15,400 --> 00:07:17,470
You can pull whatever names you do

177
00:07:17,470 --> 00:07:18,380
pull R

178
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:20,100
knee F makes sense

179
00:07:20,390 --> 00:07:27,890
And then this bone is going to be called foot because the foot and this is going to be on the right front

180
00:07:28,120 --> 00:07:29,460
so R and f

181
00:07:29,470 --> 00:07:30,600
right and front

182
00:07:30,890 --> 00:07:31,540
okay

183
00:07:31,550 --> 00:07:37,380
So now what we want is this little bone to control the chain of the leg

184
00:07:37,410 --> 00:07:39,800
And there's a little trick before doing it

185
00:07:39,820 --> 00:07:46,910
I can move this knee a tiny bit to the front and already indicating how my knee is going to bend because if not

186
00:07:46,920 --> 00:07:50,070
it can sometimes make a mistake and bend backwards a bit

187
00:07:50,380 --> 00:07:52,990
If I was how those animals bend backwards

188
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:54,740
flamingo like a flamingo

189
00:07:54,750 --> 00:07:58,250
yeahor maybe this duck could be bending backwards

190
00:07:58,320 --> 00:07:58,770
that's mistake

191
00:07:59,700 --> 00:08:00,720
Okaythe moves doesn't

192
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:03,840
So we're going now go into post mode

193
00:08:04,200 --> 00:08:08,340
Somehow this happens post mode and I'm going to select this bone

194
00:08:08,350 --> 00:08:09,040
which is my foot

195
00:08:09,540 --> 00:08:14,250
and I'm going to shift click and I'm going to select this one that is going to be the end of my chain

196
00:08:14,250 --> 00:08:15,030
Whatever you are doing

197
00:08:15,040 --> 00:08:17,720
you always want to do the end of the chain bone

198
00:08:17,960 --> 00:08:20,870
And now I'm going to do right click and I'm going to actually

199
00:08:20,870 --> 00:08:21,780
it's not right click here

200
00:08:21,900 --> 00:08:23,580
I think it's in post

201
00:08:23,750 --> 00:08:25,590
We're going to do inverse kinematics

202
00:08:25,640 --> 00:08:27,220
add Ik to bone

203
00:08:27,340 --> 00:08:28,890
So I'm going to do that

204
00:08:28,890 --> 00:08:30,958
thatand then it's asking me again

205
00:08:30,958 --> 00:08:32,250
act to active bone

206
00:08:32,250 --> 00:08:34,060
So as soon as I do it

207
00:08:34,150 --> 00:08:35,180
let's see what is happening

208
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:38,410
This bone got turned into yellow

209
00:08:38,670 --> 00:08:39,490
This bone

210
00:08:39,740 --> 00:08:40,870
nothing is showing

211
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:42,050
And then when I click in this bone

212
00:08:42,060 --> 00:08:43,810
you see that there's t​‌​‌​​‌‌​​‌‌​​‌‌‌​‌‌​​‌‌​‌​‌​​‌‌​​‌‌​​‌‌‌​‌‌​​‌‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌‌​‌‌​​‌‌‌​​‌​​‌‌​‌​‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌​‌‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌‌​​‌‌‌​​‌‌‌​‌​‌​‌​​‌‌‌‌‌‌​​‌‌​​​‌​​‌‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌‌‌‌‌​​‌‌​‌​‌​​‌‌​‌‌‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌‌‌‌​​​‌‌‌​‌‌​​‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌‌​​‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌‌​‌‌​​‌‌​​‌‌​​‌‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌‌​​‌​​‌‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌​‌​‌​​‌‌‌‌‌‌​​‌‌​‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌‌​​‌‌‌​‌​‌‌‌​​‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌​​​‌‌​​‌‌​​‌‌​‌‌‌‌‌​‌​​​‌​​‌‌‌​​‌​​‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌​‌‌‌​​‌‌‌‌‌​​​‌‌​‌‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌​‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌​‌​‌​​‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌​‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌​‌‌​​​‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌​​‌‌​‌​‌‌‌​‌​‌​‌​​‌‌​‌‌‌‌‌​‌​‌​‌​​‌‌​‌​‌​​‌‌​‌​‌‌‌​‌‌​​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌‌​​‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌​​‌‌‌​​‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌​‌‌‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌​‌‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌​​​‌‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌‌​​‌​​‌‌‌​​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌​​‌‌​‌​‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌​‌​‌‌‌​‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌​‌​‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌​​‌‌​​‌‌​​‌‌​‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌​​​‌‌‌‌‌​​​‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌​​‌​​‌‌​‌​‌‌‌​‌​‌‌‌​​‌‌​‌‌​​​‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌​‌‌‌​​‌‌‌‌‌​​​‌‌​‌​‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌‌​​‌‌‌​‌​‌‌‌‌‌​‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌‌​​‌‌‌‌‌‌​​‌‌​‌‌‌​​‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌‌​​‌​​‌‌​​‌‌​​‌‌‌​​‌​​‌‌‌​​‌​​‌‌​‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌his yellow arrow

213
00:08:43,970 --> 00:08:46,300
This is telling us the beginning of the Ik

214
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:49,860
so this is telling us there is a chain of things happening

215
00:08:50,220 --> 00:08:52,760
and this is going until the very end of the chain

216
00:08:52,760 --> 00:08:57,920
So when you move that initial foot right back to the tailor is going to move

217
00:08:58,530 --> 00:09:00,530
the entire car is gonna move

218
00:09:00,540 --> 00:09:01,890
and this doesn't make any sense

219
00:09:01,890 --> 00:09:02,710
this is not looking good

220
00:09:03,210 --> 00:09:06,260
So what we want is when I move this tailbone

221
00:09:06,490 --> 00:09:07,600
this bone will move

222
00:09:07,610 --> 00:09:08,270
this bone will move

223
00:09:08,570 --> 00:09:09,430
but that said

224
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:10,770
how long is this chain

225
00:09:10,790 --> 00:09:14,420
I see one bone and two bones right Now

226
00:09:14,430 --> 00:09:17,090
if I go here and if I go into my options

227
00:09:17,090 --> 00:09:23,040
you can see that the program automatically added an Ik bone constraint and the chain length is 0

228
00:09:23,050 --> 00:09:25,050
Zero for this program means infinite

229
00:09:25,500 --> 00:09:27,450
So we didn't select how long it was

230
00:09:27,450 --> 00:09:29,870
So it was up to the very end of the BU

231
00:09:30,450 --> 00:09:33,380
But now we're going to do a chain of two

232
00:09:33,620 --> 00:09:34,890
So let's see what happens

233
00:09:34,900 --> 00:09:39,690
Actually I'm going to do first chain of three because sometimes people make a mistake and they do a chain of three

234
00:09:39,730 --> 00:09:41,670
So if I do a chain of three

235
00:09:41,720 --> 00:09:43,710
when I now move this bone

236
00:09:44,220 --> 00:09:45,180
things look good

237
00:09:45,180 --> 00:09:46,710
but my chain is a too long

238
00:09:46,710 --> 00:09:49,860
So I'm getting this kind of a strange thing in which my

239
00:09:50,140 --> 00:09:54,200
it's moving like the bone that it should be not moving

240
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:55,580
Let's make instead of that

241
00:09:55,590 --> 00:09:56,580
a chain of two

242
00:09:56,810 --> 00:10:00,650
And now we're going to see that my entire system up

243
00:10:01,030 --> 00:10:01,850
I need to move this one

244
00:10:02,210 --> 00:10:04,300
My entire system starts making more sense

245
00:10:04,300 --> 00:10:06,660
I'm going to deactivate transparency and going to go to this mode

246
00:10:06,780 --> 00:10:11,650
and I'm going to see that now my me is Ben in a much more natural way

247
00:10:12,130 --> 00:10:18,040
The only problem I have is that I have no ability to say where my knee is pointing

248
00:10:18,430 --> 00:10:18,830
And for that

249
00:10:19,140 --> 00:10:20,280
we usually use poles

250
00:10:20,290 --> 00:10:22,320
And if you remember we had selected

251
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:25,540
we made one bone that was called pole

252
00:10:25,550 --> 00:10:26,590
our knee

253
00:10:26,940 --> 00:10:30,420
So let's see how we can do to use that as a poll

254
00:10:30,420 --> 00:10:31,860
We can go to my options here

255
00:10:31,860 --> 00:10:32,700
my Ik

256
00:10:32,810 --> 00:10:34,940
and you see here it says pull target

257
00:10:35,130 --> 00:10:37,750
the pole target I can select and I select

258
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:39,740
And but the first thing I selected is this armature

259
00:10:39,740 --> 00:10:40,470
It is just the armature

260
00:10:40,470 --> 00:10:43,000
but now we need to select within the armature which bone

261
00:10:43,230 --> 00:10:44,190
And if I write here

262
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:50,240
pole or knee is one that we generated before and we need one extra step

263
00:10:50,250 --> 00:10:52,150
And is that the pole angle is always wrong

264
00:10:52,170 --> 00:10:53,590
but 99% of the time

265
00:10:53,700 --> 00:10:54,820
if we put 90%

266
00:10:54,830 --> 00:10:55,710
it will work

267
00:10:56,010 --> 00:10:58,030
So as soon as I put 90%

268
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:01,650
now my yellow arrow is pointing at the end of this chain

269
00:11:01,740 --> 00:11:04,500
And now you can see that when I go here

270
00:11:04,510 --> 00:11:07,860
now I can use this pole to select where my knee is pointing at

271
00:11:08,590 --> 00:11:09,260
very nice

272
00:11:09,480 --> 00:11:12,380
So this is basically how I rigged the Carter

273
00:11:12,380 --> 00:11:14,640
I did this for every single of the legs

274
00:11:14,870 --> 00:11:16,600
and then you can say

275
00:11:16,610 --> 00:11:17,700
ohbut it's looking ugly

276
00:11:17,700 --> 00:11:19,380
I don't like that I'm seeing these ugly bones

277
00:11:19,390 --> 00:11:20,920
That'sthat's just visuals

278
00:11:20,920 --> 00:11:26,840
but the visuals that I made in the project that I made to make it more pretty is I did a few things

279
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:29,980
I went into my object mode and I generated a mesh

280
00:11:30,140 --> 00:11:31,990
You can make whatever mesh you want

281
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:32,470
In this case

282
00:11:32,470 --> 00:11:33,250
I can make a circle

283
00:11:33,250 --> 00:11:34,360
I can make it a bit smaller

284
00:11:34,590 --> 00:11:36,680
So that's going to be my circle reference

285
00:11:36,680 --> 00:11:39,390
And I can make it disappear because I don't want to see my render

286
00:11:39,670 --> 00:11:44,310
This is going to be simply a geometry I'm going to use because now when I go into my post mode

287
00:11:44,380 --> 00:11:47,280
I can select any of my bones and I go here into my options

288
00:11:47,390 --> 00:11:49,940
and you see a area that it says view for display

289
00:11:49,950 --> 00:11:53,370
I can select that this display as a custom object

290
00:11:53,380 --> 00:11:54,660
and I can select that circle

291
00:11:54,670 --> 00:12:06,710
I can do the same with the bone that is at the end of the chain and I can select that circle my pole is going to be this circle and my pole is going to be and my foot is going to be a circle as well

292
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:08,480
Sometimes because the pole

293
00:12:08,510 --> 00:12:08,870
you know

294
00:12:08,870 --> 00:12:09,650
for whatever reason

295
00:12:09,730 --> 00:12:14,210
you can make a different type of circle that looks a bit different or you can as well rotate it

296
00:12:14,310 --> 00:12:15,000
translate it

297
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:15,340
You can do

298
00:12:15,340 --> 00:12:16,220
for example

299
00:12:16,230 --> 00:12:18,520
change the scale and make an elongated like that

300
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:21,520
and as long as you make all your posts to look the same

301
00:12:21,590 --> 00:12:23,780
people understand what's going on exactly

302
00:12:23,790 --> 00:12:26,580
And the other thing I did is all the bones that were not relevant

303
00:12:26,580 --> 00:12:28,550
and I didn't want the people to be playing with

304
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:30,670
I just selected height

305
00:12:30,690 --> 00:12:31,830
so I don't show them

306
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:33,810
So now it's a very magical thing

307
00:12:33,810 --> 00:12:35,610
which I only saw in this circle

308
00:12:35,620 --> 00:12:41,260
and people can change the length of my knee if you are having a bit of a bend

309
00:12:41,260 --> 00:12:43,160
you see that this is not bending very well

310
00:12:43,160 --> 00:12:44,240
this is not perfect

311
00:12:44,490 --> 00:12:46,780
This can be corrected with doing weights

312
00:12:46,780 --> 00:12:51,920
But what I recommend that the problem happened here is that probably the bone was a bit too low

313
00:12:51,940 --> 00:12:55,310
so the bending is not happening in a completely linear way

314
00:12:55,320 --> 00:12:57,580
so I would have put the bone a bit higher

315
00:12:57,590 --> 00:12:59,300
so there's a bit more straight leg

316
00:12:59,310 --> 00:13:00,470
But in reality

317
00:13:00,470 --> 00:13:02,890
because of how this entire thing is made

318
00:13:02,900 --> 00:13:06,720
this is good enough for whatever we are the purpose right now

319
00:13:06,730 --> 00:13:11,430
So you'd recommend rather than using the weight painting

320
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:12,700
which we learn about in the longer course

321
00:13:12,700 --> 00:13:18,650
you'd recommend more focusing on the preparation 100 preparation is much better than spending a lot of time painting

322
00:13:19,050 --> 00:13:20,240
If you need to paint

323
00:13:20,250 --> 00:13:20,560
you know

324
00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:22,690
we explain in the other course how to do it

325
00:13:22,860 --> 00:13:25,400
But most of the times I forget about painting

326
00:13:25,410 --> 00:13:27,630
I just do it with a bit of preparation

327
00:13:27,890 --> 00:13:29,220
And now that we learned this

328
00:13:29,820 --> 00:13:39,640
want how I'm going to delete this and I'm going to show how I made the tail And the tail is much more simple than people think

329
00:13:39,650 --> 00:13:42,210
If you now understand how this works

330
00:13:42,370 --> 00:13:46,310
I'm going to do it simply with a cylinder and I'm going to make a few

331
00:13:46,590 --> 00:13:49,400
I know actually I can go into my cylinder

332
00:13:49,960 --> 00:13:51,390
I'm going to deactivate this

333
00:13:51,570 --> 00:13:53,020
I'm going to now select my cylinder

334
00:13:53,100 --> 00:13:57,820
I'm going to rotate it 90 degrees and I'm going to scale this

335
00:13:57,830 --> 00:13:58,220
Oh

336
00:13:58,230 --> 00:13:59,720
why is my cylinder rotated like that

337
00:13:59,930 --> 00:14:01,230
Okay I'm going to delete it

338
00:14:01,390 --> 00:14:03,080
and I'm going to start by cylinder again

339
00:14:03,530 --> 00:14:05,820
mes cylinder

340
00:14:05,860 --> 00:14:07,770
and actually I can do it in the options here

341
00:14:07,770 --> 00:14:11,490
so I'm going to do a bit of depth that looks a bit like a tail already

342
00:14:11,620 --> 00:14:12,880
and I'm gon na be a bit thinner

343
00:14:13,790 --> 00:14:14,560
okay

344
00:14:14,570 --> 00:14:17,240
And I can do a vertical because I can explain how it works here

345
00:14:17,290 --> 00:14:20,940
So the way to do my tail is like this

346
00:14:21,150 --> 00:14:22,080
I'm going to go to my edit mode

347
00:14:22,090 --> 00:14:22,890
Of course

348
00:14:22,900 --> 00:14:27,950
in order for my tail to bend I'm gon na need some cuts because even though right now it's not gon na work

349
00:14:28,510 --> 00:14:32,450
it's one of the problems sometimes people have is that they forget that you need cuts for this to work

350
00:14:32,460 --> 00:14:35,590
Click and now I'm going to do number of cuts and I'm going to do a few of them

351
00:14:35,820 --> 00:14:37,570
So this is quite soft

352
00:14:37,580 --> 00:14:37,930
okay

353
00:14:37,940 --> 00:14:39,060
I'm going to do 23

354
00:14:39,130 --> 00:14:41,560
that's going to give me quite a lot of bending

355
00:14:41,630 --> 00:14:44,820
remember that then you can put everything inside the subdivision surface

356
00:14:45,160 --> 00:14:45,750
Okay

357
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:47,780
so now I'm going to go to my object mode

358
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:52,019
I'm going to look in front and I'm going to add armature

359
00:14:52,019 --> 00:14:53,904
and I'm going to add a single bone

360
00:14:53,904 --> 00:14:58,723
I need to activate transparency to see that bone and let's put the beginning of my chain

361
00:14:58,723 --> 00:15:04,070
I'm going to go in here and I'm going to start extruding in my edit mode

362
00:15:04,080 --> 00:15:05,480
I'm going to start extruding

363
00:15:06,060 --> 00:15:08,850
What I can do is I can do extrude with E

364
00:15:08,950 --> 00:15:10,300
and I think if you press X

365
00:15:10,300 --> 00:15:11,300
no set

366
00:15:11,390 --> 00:15:12,260
If I press set

367
00:15:12,260 --> 00:15:15,320
I make sure that I'm moving only in the set axis

368
00:15:15,400 --> 00:15:17,330
so I'm gon na do a chain of bones

369
00:15:17,340 --> 00:15:20,610
maybe I don't need the chain to be that long because I'm gon na get bored

370
00:15:20,610 --> 00:15:25,030
So e set and how do you decide how big to make the bones here

371
00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:27,290
I guess you don't want to overlap the geometry

372
00:15:28,050 --> 00:15:30,790
the size of the bones is not relevant

373
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:33,810
is more of an indication is the way the program is representing them

374
00:15:33,810 --> 00:15:37,350
so it's fine if I made them so big that they overlap the geometry

375
00:15:37,390 --> 00:15:39,080
it's only an indication from the program

376
00:15:39,380 --> 00:15:41,530
So the distance between the volumes

377
00:15:41,530 --> 00:15:43,000
the more volumes we have

378
00:15:43,090 --> 00:15:45,790
the smoother the chain is going to be

379
00:15:45,840 --> 00:15:48,910
but of course our program is going to get a bit slower

380
00:15:48,920 --> 00:15:49,710
But yeah

381
00:15:49,710 --> 00:15:51,360
that's a very good question because at the beginning

382
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:53,260
I thought that the size of the bone was relevant

383
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:55,740
but in reality you can go here and change

384
00:15:55,740 --> 00:15:56,250
TheI think

385
00:15:56,250 --> 00:15:57,360
in custom properties is

386
00:15:57,380 --> 00:15:58,390
ohmaybe not in here

387
00:15:58,540 --> 00:16:01,490
but I'm sure if you go into post mode

388
00:16:01,610 --> 00:16:05,680
we can select the bone and I can go and check how it looks

389
00:16:05,980 --> 00:16:11,130
And if I change how it looks and I can make a custom object or chase how it looks and it could be smaller

390
00:16:11,130 --> 00:16:13,200
it's not really relevant to the end of the end

391
00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:15,200
the end result

392
00:16:15,710 --> 00:16:16,510
Okay

393
00:16:16,520 --> 00:16:17,780
now that we have that there

394
00:16:17,790 --> 00:16:20,010
we're going to do exactly what we did before

395
00:16:20,010 --> 00:16:21,780
I'm going to select my cylin cylinder

396
00:16:21,780 --> 00:16:22,890
I'm going to call it tail

397
00:16:23,050 --> 00:16:25,500
and I'm going to select cylinder armature

398
00:16:25,540 --> 00:16:26,130
At this point

399
00:16:26,130 --> 00:16:27,730
probably everyone is an expert on this

400
00:16:27,740 --> 00:16:31,240
you're just going to do right click parent with automatic weights

401
00:16:31,330 --> 00:16:34,150
And now my tail is inside my armature

402
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:35,730
If I go to post mode

403
00:16:35,830 --> 00:16:39,650
I can just rotate and my tail is rotating

404
00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:41,530
And if it's not smooth enough

405
00:16:41,540 --> 00:16:45,670
it's because remember that we can just go into object mode and add

406
00:16:46,790 --> 00:16:57,550
I can select that and add a modifier and I can add a subdivision surface with a couple of subdivisions and I can shade it all smooth

407
00:16:57,960 --> 00:16:59,500
and I can be this mode

408
00:16:59,510 --> 00:17:02,690
And now you can see that when I go into my post mode

409
00:17:02,790 --> 00:17:06,590
I can select any of my bones and I can start rotating and it's looking nice

410
00:17:06,590 --> 00:17:07,710
and it's smooth for my tail

411
00:17:07,960 --> 00:17:15,230
But the thing that we wanted is to be able to select the last point of the chain of my tail and be able to move the entire tail

412
00:17:15,310 --> 00:17:17,920
And it's exactly the same that we've done before

413
00:17:18,180 --> 00:17:20,580
So oh I'm going to

414
00:17:20,590 --> 00:17:21,720
I don't know why going

415
00:17:21,780 --> 00:17:25,920
but I deleted some of the subdivisions

416
00:17:25,930 --> 00:17:27,300
I'm going to do say the smooth

417
00:17:27,310 --> 00:17:29,250
but I wanted to reset the armature

418
00:17:29,250 --> 00:17:29,720
By the way

419
00:17:29,730 --> 00:17:31,110
if you want to reset the armature

420
00:17:31,110 --> 00:17:32,060
you don't do it like that

421
00:17:32,150 --> 00:17:32,710
I did it wrong

422
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:34,050
just like all the ones with A

423
00:17:34,050 --> 00:17:35,750
and then you go post transform

424
00:17:36,060 --> 00:17:36,330
Ohno

425
00:17:36,340 --> 00:17:37,770
clear transform all

426
00:17:37,780 --> 00:17:41,240
And now all my transformations get completely cleared

427
00:17:41,830 --> 00:17:45,070
So what I'm going to do now is I'm going to do exactly the same

428
00:17:45,180 --> 00:17:46,480
I'm going to go to edit mode

429
00:17:46,700 --> 00:17:49,150
I'm going to generate a copy of this bone

430
00:17:49,350 --> 00:17:51,010
I'm going to select this

431
00:17:51,020 --> 00:17:52,050
I'm going to split it

432
00:17:52,060 --> 00:17:53,300
So now this is split

433
00:17:53,510 --> 00:17:57,310
and now I'm going to go into my pose mode and select this bone

434
00:17:57,410 --> 00:17:59,910
select this last part of the chat

435
00:18:00,700 --> 00:18:07,620
and we're going to go into pause or pose inverse kinematics

436
00:18:07,940 --> 00:18:08,390
I k to 1

437
00:18:08,900 --> 00:18:10,190
and as soon as I added

438
00:18:10,380 --> 00:18:13,530
we have this that turn yellow and you can not see it

439
00:18:13,530 --> 00:18:16,810
but there is a yellow line that is going all the way to the end of my chain

440
00:18:16,970 --> 00:18:24,940
In this case I'm not even going to have to say in the program how long is my chain because it just went to the very end of my chain and that's what I wanted

441
00:18:25,090 --> 00:18:27,400
So now if I move this in post mode

442
00:18:27,830 --> 00:18:32,000
let's see how this magically my entire tail works

443
00:18:32,130 --> 00:18:33,200
And it looks like a tail

444
00:18:33,210 --> 00:18:33,630
that's great

445
00:18:33,630 --> 00:18:34,380
So does it always

446
00:18:34,390 --> 00:18:36,440
the chain always goes automatically to the final bone

447
00:18:36,660 --> 00:18:37,620
always to the final one

448
00:18:37,680 --> 00:18:38,450
So in this case

449
00:18:38,460 --> 00:18:39,730
because it was good

450
00:18:39,740 --> 00:18:40,540
that's fine

451
00:18:40,670 --> 00:18:44,900
If I wanted the beginning of my tail to be a bit straight and only having in the end bend

452
00:18:44,910 --> 00:18:48,380
I can always select the bone that is telling me the length of the chain

453
00:18:48,390 --> 00:18:50,640
Go here and make my chain length of

454
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:51,720
for example

455
00:18:52,010 --> 00:18:52,460
you know

456
00:18:52,680 --> 00:18:53,850
23

457
00:18:53,860 --> 00:18:54,670
You can

458
00:18:54,860 --> 00:18:57,830
I think people now can start understanding what the system is

459
00:18:57,860 --> 00:18:58,080
You know

460
00:18:58,080 --> 00:18:59,020
now if I move it

461
00:18:59,030 --> 00:18:59,950
only the end

462
00:19:00,010 --> 00:19:03,130
if my chain is moving and at the beginning it's completely straight

463
00:19:03,140 --> 00:19:06,370
It's great to see that because I'm kind of imagining what crazy characters people are coming up

464
00:19:07,500 --> 00:19:07,980
Yeah

465
00:19:08,170 --> 00:19:14,840
this looks a bit like you could make one of these things that sometimes they are in America to sell cars and you see them in the UK as well

466
00:19:14,930 --> 00:19:17,360
that they move with the movement of the wind

467
00:19:17,370 --> 00:19:17,460
I love

468
00:19:18,040 --> 00:19:19,710
Yeahand the cool thing about this

469
00:19:19,720 --> 00:19:20,200
of course

470
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:23,150
you can add a pole to select where this looking at

471
00:19:23,590 --> 00:19:24,860
like we did it before

472
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:25,720
but I think with this

473
00:19:25,720 --> 00:19:30,260
we have explained enough how to do this rigging on the character

474
00:19:31,010 --> 00:19:32,420
I hope you all enjoyed it

475
00:19:32,430 --> 00:19:32,700
I'm go

476
00:19:32,770 --> 00:19:35,850
go and just show the project one second before

477
00:19:35,860 --> 00:19:40,850
Remember that you are going to be able to access this project the same thing that happened by the way with this

478
00:19:40,860 --> 00:19:43,500
this is just if you go into post mode

479
00:19:43,520 --> 00:19:50,550
these ones that are controlling the head and the body are simply the same Are I selected one of the bones and I made it look a bit like that

480
00:19:50,560 --> 00:19:52,040
so it looked a bit prettier

481
00:19:52,140 --> 00:19:55,360
The same with the head is exactly the same

482
00:19:55,440 --> 00:19:56,580
and by the way

483
00:19:56,590 --> 00:19:58,050
you can see that here

484
00:19:58,060 --> 00:20:12,970
my tail has a bit of grease pencil that is attached to the tail that actually was included when I did pairing with automatic weight and automatically blender applied the weight to the tail and included the grease pencil

485
00:20:12,970 --> 00:20:13,490
which is amazing

486
00:20:13,910 --> 00:20:14,680
A little treat

487
00:20:14,690 --> 00:20:16,290
So I think now at this point

488
00:20:16,290 --> 00:20:18,820
everyone knows how to make every single element on this

489
00:20:18,870 --> 00:20:25,850
I really think that you should instead of trying to copy exactly the illustration from Noah and the version we made in 3D

490
00:20:25,860 --> 00:20:27,300
you should make your own version

491
00:20:27,330 --> 00:20:30,340
Yeahwe'd love to see more people's illustrations appearing here

492
00:20:30,360 --> 00:20:32,120
moving around them in 3D

493
00:20:33,030 --> 00:20:33,820
In the next lesson

494
00:20:33,820 --> 00:20:35,190
we're going to check another illustration

495
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:36,700
and I think it my favorite

496
00:20:36,820 --> 00:20:37,090
I mean

497
00:20:37,090 --> 00:20:38,370
the three of them are my favorites

498
00:20:38,490 --> 00:20:42,780
but like I really love the translation that happened in the next illustration

499
00:20:43,190 --> 00:20:45,610
Thank you and really well done to know albrech again

500
00:20:46,820 --> 00:20:47,950
thank you very much
