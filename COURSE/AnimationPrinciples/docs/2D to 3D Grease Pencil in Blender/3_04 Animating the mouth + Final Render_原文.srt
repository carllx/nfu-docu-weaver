1
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:05,130
So should we do the mouth

2
00:00:05,310 --> 00:00:06,840
Yeahlet's see how we're gonna do this

3
00:00:06,850 --> 00:00:07,130
Yeah

4
00:00:07,140 --> 00:00:08,120
so for the mouth

5
00:00:08,120 --> 00:00:09,320
it's gonna be very simple

6
00:00:10,030 --> 00:00:11,630
We are basically doing the same

7
00:00:11,640 --> 00:00:13,260
we are making a blank frame

8
00:00:13,260 --> 00:00:18,930
we are on the black grease pencil frame and we are going to be in frame 1

9
00:00:19,160 --> 00:00:22,320
and I'm gonna call this mouth and let's see how we can make it

10
00:00:22,450 --> 00:00:24,020
We are going go to my front view

11
00:00:24,030 --> 00:00:32,570
so I'm making sure that I'm drawing in the correct place and we can activate where are you reference you are hidden

12
00:00:32,600 --> 00:00:35,110
I think it's because we have all of this movie activated

13
00:00:35,540 --> 00:00:38,070
okayI can see now how my mouth is

14
00:00:38,080 --> 00:00:44,220
so I'm going to be selecting my mouth and I'm going to just try to put it in a similar position

15
00:00:44,220 --> 00:00:47,210
I'm going to select my then

16
00:00:47,220 --> 00:00:48,840
and I'm going to first draw here in the air

17
00:00:48,860 --> 00:00:51,030
and then I'm going to move it in the correct position

18
00:00:51,140 --> 00:00:53,290
I'm going to draw it a few times until I like it

19
00:00:53,330 --> 00:00:53,920
that's good

20
00:00:54,170 --> 00:00:57,950
and now that I have that there I'm going to go to my object mode

21
00:00:58,500 --> 00:01:02,560
change my origins because I want it to be staying there

22
00:01:02,970 --> 00:01:04,900
And for now I'm not gonna rotate it

23
00:01:04,900 --> 00:01:05,890
I can rotate it later

24
00:01:05,890 --> 00:01:08,460
but for my drawing when I'm still drawing for me

25
00:01:08,460 --> 00:01:13,150
I like it just keeping it flat and in reality it works well like that

26
00:01:13,150 --> 00:01:17,000
so I'm going to just keep that there and put my mouth there

27
00:01:17,180 --> 00:01:18,500
and that's looking adorable

28
00:01:18,500 --> 00:01:20,160
My dog is getting a lot of personality

29
00:01:20,160 --> 00:01:20,660
the kid

30
00:01:21,170 --> 00:01:25,360
so let's see how we can just animate this mouth in a simple way

31
00:01:25,370 --> 00:01:28,240
One of the things that we could do is make the mouth appear and disappear

32
00:01:28,290 --> 00:01:29,730
so we can just

33
00:01:30,150 --> 00:01:33,130
let's say we are starting in frame time

34
00:01:33,130 --> 00:01:34,270
we want to have the entire mouth

35
00:01:34,280 --> 00:01:37,100
I'm going to be in drawing mode and I'm maybe on frame 8

36
00:01:37,490 --> 00:01:39,350
I'm going to go in drum mode

37
00:01:39,430 --> 00:01:43,120
I'm going to have my mouth starting to disappear

38
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:44,970
frame 6

39
00:01:44,980 --> 00:01:48,140
my mouth is there and frame 4

40
00:01:48,450 --> 00:01:49,460
my mouth is a little dot

41
00:01:49,540 --> 00:01:56,900
so I'm having this animation of the mouth and so we kind of hold the mouth until frame 50

42
00:01:57,780 --> 00:01:59,380
I'm copying and pasting this

43
00:02:00,130 --> 00:02:04,340
and now I'm going to make my mouse disappear and my mouse appear left to right

44
00:02:04,350 --> 00:02:09,310
and maybe now it's going to be the opposite ISS going to start disappearing like that

45
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:10,810
So up here there

46
00:02:11,420 --> 00:02:12,780
now it gets at the beginning

47
00:02:12,780 --> 00:02:14,700
I like it not that much variation

48
00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:16,560
and then I get a lot of speed

49
00:02:18,520 --> 00:02:19,450
That's a way of drawing

50
00:02:19,550 --> 00:02:25,050
which I'm imitating the style of the curve that we would do if we were doing an easy in and out

51
00:02:25,050 --> 00:02:25,250
You know

52
00:02:25,250 --> 00:02:26,500
it gets faster

53
00:02:26,600 --> 00:02:27,300
it's lower

54
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:28,880
it's a bit more fluid

55
00:02:29,160 --> 00:02:30,510
that's a nice personality there

56
00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:31,410
Okay

57
00:02:31,420 --> 00:02:33,850
so now we are gonna call this layer

58
00:02:33,860 --> 00:02:35,580
we can call it here mouth

59
00:02:35,970 --> 00:02:37,630
if I change the layer here

60
00:02:37,640 --> 00:02:39,070
when we go here to our layers

61
00:02:39,420 --> 00:02:42,050
we are changing it here as it's just a different place to change

62
00:02:42,050 --> 00:02:44,880
it's going to add a new layer and I'm going to call this tongue

63
00:02:45,290 --> 00:02:47,980
And I know that tank was not in the original illustration

64
00:02:48,410 --> 00:02:50,820
but it was in the animation that we made because we thought

65
00:02:50,830 --> 00:02:54,840
ohit would be so pretty to have a tongue kind of moving left to right

66
00:02:54,930 --> 00:02:56,940
So I'm going to deactivate

67
00:02:56,950 --> 00:02:57,500
Oh no

68
00:02:57,530 --> 00:02:59,960
Ithis is the material I'm using for the mouth

69
00:02:59,970 --> 00:03:01,430
I need to make a new material

70
00:03:01,710 --> 00:03:04,060
So I'm going to make this new material and I'm going to make it fill

71
00:03:04,440 --> 00:03:09,270
and I'm going to make this pink material that we can use for my tongue

72
00:03:09,750 --> 00:03:10,530
That's looking good

73
00:03:11,250 --> 00:03:14,770
And now I'm going to just start drawing my tongue

74
00:03:15,310 --> 00:03:17,440
Probably it starts after the entire month appeared

75
00:03:17,450 --> 00:03:20,680
So maybe on frame 15 is the first frame of it

76
00:03:21,240 --> 00:03:23,680
and we are now going to start drawing it

77
00:03:23,690 --> 00:03:24,670
So at the beginning

78
00:03:24,730 --> 00:03:26,750
we only have a tiny bit of time appearing

79
00:03:26,880 --> 00:03:28,490
I can not see it very well

80
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:31,090
so I'm gon na make this color a bit more saturated

81
00:03:31,110 --> 00:03:32,150
Okaythat's more pretty

82
00:03:32,700 --> 00:03:33,430
And now we

83
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:35,020
because we have this mode activated

84
00:03:35,030 --> 00:03:38,700
auto kinging is going to be quite easy now to start drawing a bit more

85
00:03:38,710 --> 00:03:41,780
so I'm going to do the second position of my tongue

86
00:03:41,870 --> 00:03:46,550
actually I can make a tiny bit bigger there

87
00:03:47,320 --> 00:03:48,920
so my tongue appear there

88
00:03:49,170 --> 00:03:50,850
and now for my third position

89
00:03:50,890 --> 00:03:53,540
I like the tongue to kind of stay a lot behind

90
00:03:53,540 --> 00:03:54,290
It's just

91
00:03:54,740 --> 00:03:55,170
you know

92
00:03:55,180 --> 00:03:56,230
it's getting bigger

93
00:03:56,270 --> 00:03:59,050
but it's kind of licking the side of the mouth

94
00:03:59,250 --> 00:04:00,130
I think it's so cute

95
00:04:00,140 --> 00:04:04,560
I love these additions that you can make in 3D like you're saying it's not in the 2D

96
00:04:04,590 --> 00:04:05,850
even if you could make a 2D animation

97
00:04:07,010 --> 00:04:08,790
once you've got going with your model

98
00:04:08,790 --> 00:04:10,510
you can have so much extra fun with it

99
00:04:10,580 --> 00:04:11,070
Yeah

100
00:04:11,080 --> 00:04:12,940
and I really would like to see

101
00:04:12,940 --> 00:04:13,140
you know

102
00:04:13,140 --> 00:04:15,540
if people are making their car or their hamster

103
00:04:15,550 --> 00:04:17,400
what are they going to put here

104
00:04:17,570 --> 00:04:20,360
Yeahbecause maybe you can do something that's really specific to you

105
00:04:20,370 --> 00:04:23,220
I think that our dog Mickey glicks his mouth quite a lot actually

106
00:04:23,670 --> 00:04:24,710
Yeahalways hungry

107
00:04:24,710 --> 00:04:27,000
Soso that's good

108
00:04:27,310 --> 00:04:28,150
It goes there

109
00:04:28,300 --> 00:04:30,570
And now when we have that there

110
00:04:30,570 --> 00:04:32,760
probably we're gon na have to be coming in

111
00:04:32,870 --> 00:04:34,480
If I had a graphics tablet

112
00:04:34,480 --> 00:04:36,290
I could be drawing a more detailed one

113
00:04:36,290 --> 00:04:37,870
but I think I like it

114
00:04:37,910 --> 00:04:39,870
and now that goes there and then I'm gon na

115
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:46,100
just copy that last frame or I can just click of it to create a frame

116
00:04:46,110 --> 00:04:47,390
and then I delete whatever I need

117
00:04:47,530 --> 00:04:48,350
So up

118
00:04:49,130 --> 00:04:51,260
make sure that if I try to delete

119
00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:53,040
we can block the other layer

120
00:04:53,140 --> 00:04:58,910
So we can block the mount layer and when I delete and make sure that I'm only deleting my tongue layer

121
00:04:59,640 --> 00:05:03,640
okayso I think it's that animation is working well there

122
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:07,330
And I'm gon na go to this mode so I can see what's happening

123
00:05:07,790 --> 00:05:09,980
And now I can see that my animation is there

124
00:05:10,030 --> 00:05:11,330
and then it returns

125
00:05:11,340 --> 00:05:13,290
But I think once it gets smaller

126
00:05:13,300 --> 00:05:14,220
it should start again

127
00:05:14,220 --> 00:05:15,190
So in frame 60

128
00:05:15,190 --> 00:05:16,240
I think we should start again

129
00:05:16,630 --> 00:05:18,270
so we're going to go now to this mode

130
00:05:18,300 --> 00:05:23,180
add modifier time of set custom range 0 to 60

131
00:05:23,550 --> 00:05:26,200
And now my animation plays forever

132
00:05:26,870 --> 00:05:27,500
I have my

133
00:05:27,510 --> 00:05:29,460
and I really like as well

134
00:05:29,460 --> 00:05:30,490
by the way

135
00:05:30,540 --> 00:05:32,280
because my ranges are different

136
00:05:32,280 --> 00:05:36,000
one goes from 0 to 60 and my eyes are from 0 to 70

137
00:05:36,210 --> 00:05:37,680
As we repeat more and more

138
00:05:37,690 --> 00:05:38,970
they are out of sync

139
00:05:39,010 --> 00:05:41,930
so it feels a bit more alive because the mouth

140
00:05:41,990 --> 00:05:44,510
sometimes it's moving when the eyes are looking at one place

141
00:05:44,520 --> 00:05:47,490
and sometimes it's moving when the eyes are looking at another place

142
00:05:47,750 --> 00:05:51,700
We're adding more and more variation with all of these combinations of things

143
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:54,850
The only thing now before just rendering our entire thing

144
00:05:54,850 --> 00:06:05,970
the only thing I would recommend is that we can simply go and put a bit of the noise that we were using before

145
00:06:05,980 --> 00:06:07,720
And also I can align this mouth

146
00:06:07,730 --> 00:06:09,280
So to align this mouth in object mode

147
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:10,870
I can just put it there and rotate it

148
00:06:12,040 --> 00:06:16,680
But the only thing I would do now is just add in my modifiers

149
00:06:16,700 --> 00:06:21,490
I would put this noise where you are the noise and do the same we did before

150
00:06:21,500 --> 00:06:21,740
You know

151
00:06:21,740 --> 00:06:27,820
like we can change the noise scale so we can make the noise scale quite high and the position quite soft

152
00:06:27,830 --> 00:06:30,920
So it's just adding a tiny bit of that

153
00:06:30,940 --> 00:06:32,800
Yeaha bit more of the hand drawn feeling

154
00:06:33,150 --> 00:06:35,400
And because the steps are every 4

155
00:06:35,410 --> 00:06:40,600
we are having this kind of thing that is changing all the time and it's adding a really nice effect

156
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:44,260
If we have an effect that we like and we want to copy to another place

157
00:06:44,380 --> 00:06:45,280
it's really easy

158
00:06:45,380 --> 00:06:47,820
The thing you need to do is select all the objects

159
00:06:47,990 --> 00:06:48,770
So for example

160
00:06:48,780 --> 00:06:52,040
select this plant and this plant and this plant

161
00:06:52,070 --> 00:06:53,710
and maybe the mouth as well

162
00:06:53,760 --> 00:06:54,200
and then

163
00:06:54,510 --> 00:06:59,930
and then select continue doing shift and select the object in which you have the effect that you like

164
00:06:59,940 --> 00:07:00,400
For example

165
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:01,180
here on the eye

166
00:07:01,320 --> 00:07:02,750
that needs to be the last one

167
00:07:02,810 --> 00:07:06,030
And now we go to noise here and we say copy to select it

168
00:07:06,620 --> 00:07:11,580
I now automatically my program has copied that noise to every single of my layers

169
00:07:11,710 --> 00:07:14,680
so now all my layers are having that noise applied

170
00:07:14,900 --> 00:07:16,210
I need my beta in the mouth

171
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:16,730
To be honest

172
00:07:17,090 --> 00:07:18,970
I would do the noise a bit softer

173
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,900
so we just can select the mouth and modified

174
00:07:21,910 --> 00:07:22,340
no worries

175
00:07:22,340 --> 00:07:23,150
they are not connected

176
00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:24,100
it simply in position

177
00:07:24,100 --> 00:07:27,460
we're gon na make it a tiny bit smaller because I think it was a bit too much for the mouth

178
00:07:28,850 --> 00:07:30,940
so that's starting to look really good

179
00:07:32,510 --> 00:07:34,980
very lovely by the way

180
00:07:35,160 --> 00:07:37,680
some people are going to think

181
00:07:37,690 --> 00:07:38,970
is there another way of drawing

182
00:07:38,970 --> 00:07:44,080
like can you draw on a surface and it is possible I'm going to show you just as a final extra thing

183
00:07:44,130 --> 00:07:46,680
I'm going to show you that if we add a grease pencil

184
00:07:47,650 --> 00:07:51,850
there is one mode in drawing that instead of drawing on my origin

185
00:07:51,850 --> 00:07:54,260
you can draw on a surface and it's possible to draw

186
00:07:54,270 --> 00:07:59,670
I'm going to just make sure that I am in the correct position

187
00:08:00,010 --> 00:08:00,870
do draw

188
00:08:00,890 --> 00:08:04,990
and I probably was in some random layer 392

189
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:05,490
My goodness

190
00:08:05,760 --> 00:08:07,200
let's go to frame 1

191
00:08:07,210 --> 00:08:09,540
not to this crazy one

192
00:08:09,910 --> 00:08:10,680
okay

193
00:08:11,220 --> 00:08:12,590
And let's draw in there

194
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:15,830
So we are now selecting the drone mode and I'm gonna draw in there

195
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:17,300
And it looks like I'm drawing flat

196
00:08:17,310 --> 00:08:18,610
but because we are drawing in surface

197
00:08:18,610 --> 00:08:19,430
look what happened

198
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:23,030
I was drawing on top of my object

199
00:08:23,110 --> 00:08:26,610
but it's quite separated and the separation is defined by this

200
00:08:26,610 --> 00:08:28,480
It's defined by this offset

201
00:08:28,680 --> 00:08:34,160
So the offset happens because a lot of times when you're drawing this and by mistake

202
00:08:34,160 --> 00:08:35,670
it intersects the geometry

203
00:08:35,960 --> 00:08:41,530
So usually you want to put something quite small to look as if you are completely drawing on top of the object

204
00:08:41,660 --> 00:08:42,460
And when I do that

205
00:08:42,570 --> 00:08:44,780
now for real I'm drawing on top

206
00:08:44,840 --> 00:08:46,410
And this can be very useful

207
00:08:46,410 --> 00:08:46,540
You know

208
00:08:46,590 --> 00:08:50,400
you could have done the post there using this mode

209
00:08:50,550 --> 00:08:53,730
but it can lead to problems because it's quite difficult to control

210
00:08:53,740 --> 00:08:55,390
You don't really know what you're doing

211
00:08:55,400 --> 00:08:58,320
It's not super intuitive to be drawing so much in 3D

212
00:08:58,730 --> 00:09:00,180
so for now

213
00:09:00,190 --> 00:09:03,380
I only recommend doing it when it's really necessary to do so

214
00:09:03,390 --> 00:09:06,700
And you can see that for this type of 2D animation on top

215
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:08,280
it's not completely necessary

216
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:12,670
so we're going to have to be a bit clever about the usage of this mode

217
00:09:12,700 --> 00:09:15,310
But we are then going to be looking

218
00:09:15,310 --> 00:09:15,480
you know

219
00:09:15,560 --> 00:09:17,650
the content on the school

220
00:09:17,690 --> 00:09:19,300
He's expanding more on grease pencil

221
00:09:19,300 --> 00:09:24,040
We are doing all the projects with all the people's illustrations and showing how they can be adapted

222
00:09:24,290 --> 00:09:26,340
and sometimes that mode will be used

223
00:09:26,350 --> 00:09:27,790
So it's not that we are against it

224
00:09:27,960 --> 00:09:31,400
it's only that we are just being a bit careful when to use it

225
00:09:31,790 --> 00:09:32,220
Makes sense

226
00:09:32,230 --> 00:09:34,820
Only use something complicated if it's really necessary

227
00:09:34,820 --> 00:09:35,260
Yes

228
00:09:36,250 --> 00:09:37,530
and oh

229
00:09:37,540 --> 00:09:38,250
a final

230
00:09:38,540 --> 00:09:41,930
final little thing is that when we are rendering

231
00:09:41,930 --> 00:09:43,250
because we are not using any

232
00:09:43,640 --> 00:09:45,220
single light or the world

233
00:09:45,230 --> 00:09:46,860
if you want to render this animation

234
00:09:46,860 --> 00:09:48,560
when you do render animation

235
00:09:48,570 --> 00:09:52,780
So far I haven't found a way in which I can render this animation

236
00:09:52,850 --> 00:09:54,820
And it doesn't go to this ugly mode

237
00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:55,440
You know

238
00:09:55,450 --> 00:09:57,550
I know that I need to position the camera and everything

239
00:09:57,560 --> 00:09:59,950
Let's do that so people understand what I mean

240
00:10:02,700 --> 00:10:03,580
I'm going to go there

241
00:10:03,780 --> 00:10:05,680
And now when I do render animation

242
00:10:05,690 --> 00:10:08,210
you see that it's rendering with the original light from my scene

243
00:10:08,450 --> 00:10:11,360
And it's doing it even if I delete the lights from my scene

244
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:17,390
I'm going to delete that and you'll to go render render animation and still applying the original light

245
00:10:17,400 --> 00:10:24,090
That's because we deactivated the lights and we wanted to use this kind of Hdri that comes with Blender So far

246
00:10:24,090 --> 00:10:25,030
maybe someone can tell us

247
00:10:25,300 --> 00:10:25,840
So far

248
00:10:25,840 --> 00:10:29,730
we haven't discovered exactly how to do to render with this light

249
00:10:29,940 --> 00:10:32,420
But there's like everything in life

250
00:10:32,420 --> 00:10:33,310
There is a little trick

251
00:10:33,320 --> 00:10:35,610
and it is this trick is quite useful as well if you

252
00:10:35,610 --> 00:10:36,050
for example

253
00:10:36,050 --> 00:10:37,520
want to render this mode

254
00:10:37,810 --> 00:10:39,420
but you want to talk to your friends

255
00:10:39,430 --> 00:10:45,020
all of these kind of lines that are appearing and you want them to see how cool is the look of the program

256
00:10:45,020 --> 00:10:46,380
So if you want to do that

257
00:10:46,410 --> 00:10:49,350
you simply have to go to here to inside

258
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:50,810
I think it's inside

259
00:10:50,820 --> 00:10:51,460
let me see

260
00:10:51,460 --> 00:10:55,270
Now I started talking and now I'm not going to know where it is so

261
00:11:00,040 --> 00:11:01,450
In view here

262
00:11:01,460 --> 00:11:02,480
in any of the modes

263
00:11:02,500 --> 00:11:03,950
when we go to view

264
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:08,070
we can go and do viewport render animation

265
00:11:08,130 --> 00:11:11,260
We first need to select where we are rendering our animation like we always do

266
00:11:11,620 --> 00:11:13,780
And now when we do viewport render animation

267
00:11:13,780 --> 00:11:17,260
we render the viewport for the animation range of this scene

268
00:11:17,310 --> 00:11:18,290
So when I click there

269
00:11:18,920 --> 00:11:20,340
it's rendering this mo​‌​‌​​‌‌​​‌‌​​‌‌‌​‌‌​​‌‌​‌​‌​​‌‌​​‌‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌‌​​‌‌‌‌‌‌​​‌‌​‌​‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌​‌‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌‌​​‌‌‌​​‌‌‌​‌​‌​‌​​‌‌‌‌‌‌​​‌‌​​​‌​​‌‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌‌​​‌‌‌​‌​‌​‌​​‌‌​‌‌‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌‌‌‌​​​‌‌‌​‌‌​​‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌‌​​‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌‌​‌‌​​‌‌​​‌‌​​‌‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌‌​​‌​​‌‌‌​​‌‌‌​‌​‌​‌​​‌‌​​​‌​​‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌‌​​‌‌‌​‌​‌‌‌​​‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌‌​​‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌​​‌‌‌​​‌​​‌‌​​​‌​​‌‌‌​​‌​​‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌​‌‌‌​​‌‌‌‌‌​​​‌‌​‌‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌​‌​‌‌‌​‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌​‌​‌​​‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌​‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌​‌‌​​​‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌​‌‌​​​‌‌​‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌‌​​‌‌​‌‌‌‌‌​‌​‌​‌​​‌‌​‌​‌​​‌‌​‌​‌‌‌​‌‌​​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌‌​​‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌​​‌‌‌​​‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌​‌‌‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌​‌‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌​‌​‌‌‌​‌‌​​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌​​‌‌​‌​‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌​‌​‌‌‌​‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌​​‌‌​​‌‌‌​​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌​​​‌‌‌‌‌​​​‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌​​‌​​‌‌​‌​‌‌‌​‌​‌‌‌​​‌‌​‌‌​​​‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌​‌‌‌​​‌‌‌‌‌​​​‌‌​‌​‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌‌​​‌‌‌​‌​‌‌‌‌‌​‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌‌​​‌‌‌‌‌‌​​‌‌​‌‌‌​​‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌‌​​‌​​‌‌​​‌‌​​‌‌‌​​‌​​‌‌‌​​‌​​‌‌​‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌de

270
00:11:20,350 --> 00:11:25,350
And this is very useful because we love showing like work in progress to our friends

271
00:11:25,380 --> 00:11:28,880
We love showing how it works and it solves the problem here

272
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:32,250
So we do view render report animation

273
00:11:32,260 --> 00:11:33,410
Now we are rendering that

274
00:11:33,420 --> 00:11:34,270
of course

275
00:11:34,350 --> 00:11:37,650
we need to make sure that we don't have that empty layer there

276
00:11:37,660 --> 00:11:47,740
So and let me make sure that I'm zoom in enough and now I do view is a behavior there view for render animation

277
00:11:47,740 --> 00:11:48,847
And here I am

278
00:11:48,847 --> 00:11:54,940
I'm rendering my animation with the look and the Hdri that comes in Blender lately

279
00:11:55,910 --> 00:11:57,100
I know that's a little extra

280
00:11:57,100 --> 00:11:58,910
but it's good to know because sometimes people say

281
00:11:58,930 --> 00:12:00,560
how do you do to finish the render

282
00:12:00,850 --> 00:12:02,050
And that's how you do it perfect
