00:00:02,200 --> 00:00:04,070
Welcome back to grease pencil time

2
00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:06,210
Yeahgrease pencil is so exciting

3
00:00:06,210 --> 00:00:11,793
Grease pencil is amazing re-standing it was something that I had seen people use around

4
00:00:11,793 --> 00:00:12,538
but I was like

5
00:00:12,538 --> 00:00:13,843
ohsounds so difficult

6
00:00:13,843 --> 00:00:15,520
but actually it's not that difficult

7
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:26,240
Let's kind of I'm going to get rid of the plane of the background for a second and I'm going to get rid of that reference just so we can see what's happening with wrist

8
00:00:26,310 --> 00:00:28,650
So I'm gonna be looking at it from the front

9
00:00:28,660 --> 00:00:33,310
I have my doggie there and I'm gon na add and you see here with grease pencil

10
00:00:33,320 --> 00:00:34,220
Here you are

11
00:00:34,230 --> 00:00:35,370
we have a few different ones

12
00:00:35,370 --> 00:00:38,320
we have blank stroke monkey C

13
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:39,580
an art collection

14
00:00:39,580 --> 00:00:40,700
and art and object line art

15
00:00:40,720 --> 00:00:43,820
We're going to cover them all at some point or another

16
00:00:43,830 --> 00:00:44,870
but for now

17
00:00:45,380 --> 00:00:47,060
the one we're going use the most is blank

18
00:00:47,430 --> 00:00:51,340
So blank is gonna add a grease pencil object to the scene with nothing applied

19
00:00:52,360 --> 00:00:54,580
So when I added the blank there

20
00:00:55,230 --> 00:00:57,230
my grease pencil is called G pencil

21
00:00:57,240 --> 00:00:59,580
I'm going to have to decide where I'm going to draw

22
00:01:00,010 --> 00:01:00,560
For now

23
00:01:00,570 --> 00:01:02,740
let's imagine that we're going to draw one of our plants

24
00:01:02,750 --> 00:01:04,810
So I'm going to say plant one

25
00:01:04,820 --> 00:01:07,590
So I have my plant one that is going to be my grease pencil

26
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:10,190
and grease pencil has materials

27
00:01:10,190 --> 00:01:11,200
but they look a bit different

28
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:11,480
You see

29
00:01:11,490 --> 00:01:13,550
as soon as we generate a grease pencil

30
00:01:13,550 --> 00:01:14,810
it comes with a material called black

31
00:01:15,300 --> 00:01:19,560
So we already know that we're going to be using the color black and it has activated stroke

32
00:01:19,570 --> 00:01:20,530
but not fill

33
00:01:21,030 --> 00:01:23,870
So in order to paint in grease pencil

34
00:01:23,880 --> 00:01:25,810
right now we are not in painting mode

35
00:01:25,830 --> 00:01:26,810
we're gon na have to

36
00:01:26,820 --> 00:01:29,680
we could do it just by going here and selecting drill mode

37
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:36,580
but there is an especially select a created tab that Blender has done for us for grease pencil

38
00:01:36,590 --> 00:01:37,500
but it's hidden

39
00:01:37,510 --> 00:01:42,250
You need to go here in plus to the animation and add that to the animation tab

40
00:01:42,330 --> 00:01:43,280
And as soon as you do it

41
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:52,560
you are back in this 2D animation and you see that we are there into the animation and one of the things I don't like is that the 2D animation puts the lighting from the same world

42
00:01:52,570 --> 00:01:53,570
I'm going to deactivate it

43
00:01:53,570 --> 00:01:55,510
I'm going to put the lighting that we had before

44
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:56,860
I love this warm lighting

45
00:01:56,860 --> 00:01:58,720
I love how it looks when I rotate it

46
00:01:58,720 --> 00:02:00,480
so it looks like it's similar to the other one

47
00:02:00,630 --> 00:02:04,390
and I like it because kind of we're having parallelisms between the two worlds

48
00:02:04,900 --> 00:02:08,310
Now we're going to press the Y because we're looking at the world from the from the front

49
00:02:08,750 --> 00:02:11,710
and you see that I have my deep plant selected

50
00:02:11,720 --> 00:02:12,910
I have a pencil there

51
00:02:12,910 --> 00:02:14,240
suggest I'm painting on that layer

52
00:02:14,990 --> 00:02:18,200
and let's see what things that we have in here

53
00:02:18,440 --> 00:02:19,320
If we click here

54
00:02:19,320 --> 00:02:21,660
we have different types of brushes

55
00:02:21,670 --> 00:02:23,380
we have airbrushed ink pen

56
00:02:23,390 --> 00:02:23,950
different ink pens

57
00:02:24,140 --> 00:02:26,740
We're going to be providing as well different brushes

58
00:02:26,750 --> 00:02:29,930
But this one's I having enough with them

59
00:02:29,990 --> 00:02:31,860
It's amazing how much you can do with them

60
00:02:32,730 --> 00:02:34,460
Let's see what happens if I paint

61
00:02:34,470 --> 00:02:34,920
So I'm gon na

62
00:02:35,370 --> 00:02:40,040
just go around with this one already I have painted something in the air

63
00:02:40,230 --> 00:02:47,210
which is pretty amazing and not only I painted something in the air happens in something in the air that has a bit of a 3D nest to it

64
00:02:47,220 --> 00:02:47,820
Like you see

65
00:02:47,820 --> 00:02:49,250
like when I look at it from the side

66
00:02:49,260 --> 00:02:51,030
it's still having a bit of volume

67
00:02:51,640 --> 00:02:53,520
And what I painted here

68
00:02:53,900 --> 00:02:56,410
the cool thing is that it can be modified

69
00:02:57,640 --> 00:02:59,910
it's a bit confusing because Greece

70
00:02:59,910 --> 00:03:01,870
Spencerpeople think that it's Photoshop

71
00:03:01,870 --> 00:03:04,610
but in reality that it's something a bit more like Illustrator

72
00:03:04,620 --> 00:03:06,590
So we change now front rower mode to

73
00:03:06,590 --> 00:03:07,080
for example

74
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:08,110
sculpt mode

75
00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:16,700
We have a new different mode in which I'm not assuming that you can see that there is a line that is defined in this entire shape and actually that line is made of little points

76
00:03:16,940 --> 00:03:18,070
We'll see it later

77
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:18,720
But for example

78
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:21,360
I have in my sculpt bolt smoothen

79
00:03:21,370 --> 00:03:22,580
and if I smooth

80
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:24,760
let's see what happens when I smooth it out

81
00:03:24,760 --> 00:03:26,440
my entire shape now gets smoother

82
00:03:26,440 --> 00:03:28,210
you see it's getting smooth

83
00:03:28,340 --> 00:03:29,390
or I can pinch it

84
00:03:29,530 --> 00:03:34,520
I can just select my radius and I can modify and modify my shape

85
00:03:34,530 --> 00:03:36,140
I can make even do it in 3D

86
00:03:36,140 --> 00:03:38,040
so now I'm painting in 3D

87
00:03:38,680 --> 00:03:40,870
this is crazy that you can do this

88
00:03:40,890 --> 00:03:41,510
not only that

89
00:03:41,520 --> 00:03:42,380
you can do it like that

90
00:03:42,390 --> 00:03:44,990
you can do frame by frame animation with a 3D shape

91
00:03:44,990 --> 00:03:46,280
floating in the air

92
00:03:46,460 --> 00:03:48,320
absolutely bonkers when I discovered I was like

93
00:03:48,460 --> 00:03:49,210
ohmy goodness

94
00:03:49,210 --> 00:03:50,320
this is just the best thing ever

95
00:03:50,700 --> 00:03:52,630
and if I go to edit mode

96
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:54,050
you can see the reality of it all

97
00:03:54,060 --> 00:03:57,100
you can select some of this and you can see that in reality

98
00:03:57,100 --> 00:04:05,970
this shape is made of these little tiny points that are all connected to one another and the fact that these little tiny points are there has many advantages

99
00:04:05,970 --> 00:04:06,420
for example

100
00:04:06,420 --> 00:04:13,560
I can select these points and I can go here to my radius and I can change the radius of my points to make them bigger

101
00:04:13,570 --> 00:04:16,090
and you see that now there's no gradient between them

102
00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:21,660
but today we learned another tool we learned this proportional editing tool

103
00:04:21,660 --> 00:04:28,660
So now if I do that now I can make a change with the shape of my mouse and I can make it to grow in one area

104
00:04:28,670 --> 00:04:32,050
I get thinner or another amazingly cool this as well

105
00:04:32,050 --> 00:04:34,050
so you can really make lines

106
00:04:34,060 --> 00:04:34,720
you were saying

107
00:04:34,730 --> 00:04:35,880
ohthere'll be more brushes

108
00:04:35,910 --> 00:04:37,060
but you can

109
00:04:37,060 --> 00:04:38,350
but this you already got enough

110
00:04:38,470 --> 00:04:38,950
you can do

111
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:42,230
yeahthere are all the brushes I'm gonna go back to the draw mode

112
00:04:42,300 --> 00:04:42,750
and I'm gonna

113
00:04:42,750 --> 00:04:43,360
for example

114
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:45,130
use this airbrus I love this one

115
00:04:45,140 --> 00:04:49,070
it's generating this cloud in the air that it kind of works in 3D

116
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:52,590
you see it is a cloud that is all shaped in 3D

117
00:04:52,780 --> 00:04:53,300
and again

118
00:04:53,310 --> 00:04:55,940
thisthis cloud can be modified

119
00:04:55,950 --> 00:04:58,460
you can smooth it out with my with this shape

120
00:04:58,860 --> 00:04:59,730
I can pinch it

121
00:04:59,730 --> 00:04:59,770
you know

122
00:05:00,010 --> 00:05:01,850
can pinch this cloud in 3D and move it

123
00:05:01,860 --> 00:05:04,770
and it all continues being in 3D with me

124
00:05:04,780 --> 00:05:06,900
so just amazing stuff

125
00:05:06,900 --> 00:05:08,790
we're going to be discovering so many techniques

126
00:05:08,910 --> 00:05:12,950
we were saying as we were saying when we saw spider-man the amount of stuff

127
00:05:12,950 --> 00:05:14,270
they had done with this was amazing

128
00:05:14,280 --> 00:05:14,930
Ohsorry

129
00:05:14,940 --> 00:05:15,830
I deleted everything

130
00:05:15,830 --> 00:05:16,680
I didn't want to

131
00:05:16,690 --> 00:05:17,580
I just want go

132
00:05:17,610 --> 00:05:20,530
I wanted to go to sculp mode and use the eraser

133
00:05:20,570 --> 00:05:23,060
so I'm gonna make it very big and just erase everything I made

134
00:05:24,110 --> 00:05:24,230
Okay

135
00:05:25,190 --> 00:05:26,970
so should we check

136
00:05:26,980 --> 00:05:29,960
how do we do to draw one of the plants

137
00:05:29,970 --> 00:05:35,030
we are going to activate my empty object and now sometimes I don't know why

138
00:05:35,040 --> 00:05:36,280
sometimes I generate

139
00:05:36,290 --> 00:05:38,610
I have some problems with the original materials that come here

140
00:05:38,620 --> 00:05:42,180
sometimes I delete them and I start again when I'm generating my own material

141
00:05:42,420 --> 00:05:44,810
And you need to understand one thing is the material

142
00:05:44,820 --> 00:05:47,430
another thing is the drawing pen you're using

143
00:05:47,780 --> 00:05:53,390
In reality I've been discovering that this pen is defining how those dots are being drawn

144
00:05:53,420 --> 00:05:55,460
so some dots are being bigger and smaller

145
00:05:55,460 --> 00:05:57,770
so in order to generate this irregularity

146
00:05:57,770 --> 00:05:59,870
the program is generating bigger and smaller dots

147
00:06:00,050 --> 00:06:03,980
but the color of those dots is dictated by the material

148
00:06:03,980 --> 00:06:05,400
Right now we don't have any material

149
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:06,820
so it's completely white

150
00:06:07,180 --> 00:06:10,010
But if I go here and I'm going to try to draw

151
00:06:10,020 --> 00:06:11,230
for example

152
00:06:11,380 --> 00:06:11,780
this plant

153
00:06:12,650 --> 00:06:15,480
so in order to draw this plant I'm going to generate a new material

154
00:06:15,490 --> 00:06:19,130
the first thing I'm going to do I want to make a material that is only stroke

155
00:06:19,290 --> 00:06:20,510
So the two types of materials

156
00:06:20,580 --> 00:06:22,770
filled materials and stroke materials

157
00:06:22,860 --> 00:06:27,580
So the stroke material is the one like we use in Photoshop that generates a stroke

158
00:06:27,590 --> 00:06:29,290
And I'm going to just draw next to it

159
00:06:29,300 --> 00:06:33,860
I'm going to draw it there and I'm gon na have something that looks a bit like that plant is not very good

160
00:06:34,010 --> 00:06:36,410
I'm gon na be trying to be a bit more smooth

161
00:06:36,650 --> 00:06:38,320
Keep in mind I'm using my mouse

162
00:06:38,330 --> 00:06:39,170
we have a tablet

163
00:06:39,190 --> 00:06:41,720
but I want people to know that this can be done with the mouse

164
00:06:42,650 --> 00:06:43,220
By the way

165
00:06:43,230 --> 00:06:45,010
where I'm drawing is dictated here

166
00:06:45,020 --> 00:06:49,370
right now I'm drawing at the stroke origin and I'm looking at it from the front view

167
00:06:49,370 --> 00:06:52,280
And I like that because now drawing this origin

168
00:06:52,300 --> 00:06:54,040
we're going to be looking at more modes

169
00:06:54,060 --> 00:06:54,820
but for now

170
00:06:54,830 --> 00:06:55,550
this is good

171
00:06:55,580 --> 00:06:57,900
So now that we learned that we make that shape

172
00:06:57,950 --> 00:06:58,720
that's good

173
00:06:58,870 --> 00:07:08,700
and now we're going to go into my edit mode and I'm going to select the points at the very top and we have the proportional editing and I'm going to scale them down

174
00:07:08,760 --> 00:07:10,490
And Amm going to make this a bit smaller

175
00:07:10,500 --> 00:07:12,220
and I'm going to scale them down

176
00:07:13,420 --> 00:07:14,300
okaylike that

177
00:07:14,300 --> 00:07:15,860
or maybe a bit bigger

178
00:07:16,490 --> 00:07:18,600
And I'm going to select the points on the bottom

179
00:07:19,350 --> 00:07:21,320
and I'm going to scale them up

180
00:07:21,470 --> 00:07:22,330
It's great as well

181
00:07:22,330 --> 00:07:27,330
if you're using your mouse with the sculpting tool because if you do draw a little bit more jaggedy

182
00:07:27,340 --> 00:07:28,770
you can just smooth it out quite easily

183
00:07:28,770 --> 00:07:30,020
YeahI love this

184
00:07:30,340 --> 00:07:33,320
the sculpting tool like that to use it for that

185
00:07:33,370 --> 00:07:36,850
So now I'm going to make the lines that are coming here for the plants

186
00:07:36,860 --> 00:07:39,450
So I'm going to go back to my draw mode

187
00:07:39,590 --> 00:07:42,770
I'm going to go to my paint and I'm going to make one line there

188
00:07:43,690 --> 00:07:44,570
another line there

189
00:07:45,090 --> 00:07:46,000
and another line there

190
00:07:46,370 --> 00:07:47,880
And if you're finding this confusing

191
00:07:47,890 --> 00:07:48,240
I mean

192
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:50,280
I have both objects here together

193
00:07:50,290 --> 00:07:52,090
I can move this one a bit to the left

194
00:07:52,130 --> 00:08:00,180
but you can see now that I have my shape that is having dots and it's kind of imitating that we can make our own version

195
00:08:00,180 --> 00:08:00,960
But like for now

196
00:08:00,990 --> 00:08:01,640
this is good

197
00:08:01,750 --> 00:08:03,350
The thing that we are doing now

198
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:05,630
we're going to make these shapes and these shapes

199
00:08:05,630 --> 00:08:06,860
I'm gon na make them in another layer

200
00:08:06,870 --> 00:08:09,460
So if we go here to see that this looks a bit like a spaghetti

201
00:08:09,770 --> 00:08:11,270
this is the first layer

202
00:08:11,270 --> 00:08:13,260
so I'm going to say that this is my plant

203
00:08:15,220 --> 00:08:17,380
my plant strokes

204
00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:19,730
So my plant strokes are there

205
00:08:19,740 --> 00:08:21,840
I can activate them or deactivate them

206
00:08:21,850 --> 00:08:23,440
And I'm going to make a new layer

207
00:08:23,450 --> 00:08:25,730
And now it's going to be my leaves

208
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:30,690
So now in my leaves I'm going to use a different material

209
00:08:30,700 --> 00:08:35,410
So instead of using this material for my leaves I'm going to use a new material up

210
00:08:35,680 --> 00:08:41,740
I'm gonna use a new material I'm gonna apply new and instead of a stroke I'm going to use a fill

211
00:08:42,140 --> 00:08:44,470
And my field is going to be this color

212
00:08:44,910 --> 00:08:45,500
Okay

213
00:08:45,510 --> 00:08:48,240
so this now when I go to draw

214
00:08:48,420 --> 00:08:49,360
everything looks the same

215
00:08:49,370 --> 00:08:50,940
I'm using the same ink

216
00:08:51,310 --> 00:08:52,040
then graph

217
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:55,190
then look at what happens when I draw one of these circles

218
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:57,920
I can draw like that and now I draw

219
00:08:58,050 --> 00:08:59,840
yeahand it's filling it in itself

220
00:08:59,850 --> 00:09:00,900
Yeahwe can

221
00:09:00,900 --> 00:09:01,540
by the way

222
00:09:01,550 --> 00:09:04,410
activated so it has a stroke and feel at the same time

223
00:09:04,420 --> 00:09:05,500
That's possible as well

224
00:09:05,520 --> 00:09:09,700
So now I'm gon na do something that feels and that's a stroke outside

225
00:09:09,750 --> 00:09:13,010
and that's quite nice because I can draw like that

226
00:09:13,740 --> 00:09:15,600
draw like that and draw like that

227
00:09:15,640 --> 00:09:17,520
and the reason why I'm making two layers

228
00:09:17,520 --> 00:09:18,320
look what's happening now

229
00:09:18,340 --> 00:09:19,790
You see that this is strokes

230
00:09:19,850 --> 00:09:21,200
Here are on front

231
00:09:21,320 --> 00:09:24,040
but here actually these materials in front

232
00:09:24,180 --> 00:09:26,790
So I can go here and I can put my leaves

233
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:28,830
move them under my stroke

234
00:09:29,170 --> 00:09:30,480
and I have the order I wanted

235
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:32,450
Perfectas simple as that

236
00:09:33,100 --> 00:09:34,550
Okaynow that we are there

237
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:36,890
we can just go and generate the rest of the plants

238
00:09:37,220 --> 00:09:39,430
So we make this one on the left

239
00:09:39,860 --> 00:09:40,430
Okay

240
00:09:40,440 --> 00:09:41,800
so for this plant on the left

241
00:09:41,810 --> 00:09:42,440
we're gonna make

242
00:09:42,660 --> 00:09:46,560
rememberwe're working every time with a new grease Sten

243
00:09:46,940 --> 00:09:48,830
new propenal blank gon na

244
00:09:48,970 --> 00:09:51,510
call it G 2

245
00:09:51,580 --> 00:09:56,240
And I feel like now you're kind of really getting what this entire thing is about

246
00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:56,430
you know

247
00:09:56,430 --> 00:09:58,680
like I'm going to deactivate my dog and I

248
00:09:58,710 --> 00:09:59,550
instead of working up

249
00:10:00,010 --> 00:10:05,490
I forgot to put my little cylinder in there instead of working there so far away because my dog is in the middle

250
00:10:05,500 --> 00:10:07,050
I can be working from the origin

251
00:10:07,210 --> 00:10:10,490
So sometimes it's good to work from the origin and I'm gon na deactivate my plant

252
00:10:10,500 --> 00:10:12,940
One plan 2 is here

253
00:10:12,950 --> 00:10:15,210
and I'm going to be even more from the origin

254
00:10:15,220 --> 00:10:15,530
Okay

255
00:10:15,540 --> 00:10:16,260
plan 2

256
00:10:16,410 --> 00:10:19,110
And now I'm going to go to my Chr mode

257
00:10:20,220 --> 00:10:23,950
You can imagine now what's going to be stroke and what's going to be filled when it's there

258
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:26,980
I got go and just do my

259
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:30,920
I can do a stroke and feel if we wanted to have this effect

260
00:10:30,920 --> 00:10:38,350
but actually I'm not gonna do that and I'm gonna show people a really cool thing that it's much better for making these weekly edges

261
00:10:38,590 --> 00:10:41,240
So I'm going to only use fill for this material

262
00:10:41,520 --> 00:10:42,400
I'm going to make it

263
00:10:42,410 --> 00:10:47,010
I could call this material if I want some green material makes sense

264
00:10:47,530 --> 00:10:49,230
and also you can name these layers

265
00:10:49,240 --> 00:10:53,010
it just called GP layers can be plant main layer

266
00:10:53,280 --> 00:10:56,500
you know like the more if you're someone that really likes putting names on things

267
00:10:56,510 --> 00:10:57,120
just go for it

268
00:10:57,430 --> 00:10:57,850
Okay

269
00:10:57,860 --> 00:11:01,370
and now I'm gonna draw the shape of these plants are gon na go there

270
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:04,170
I'm drawing with my mouse

271
00:11:04,180 --> 00:11:06,980
so it is not really easy to draw this

272
00:11:07,050 --> 00:11:10,100
but luckily we have all the sculpting tools that are going to help us later

273
00:11:10,540 --> 00:11:11,690
so I have that there

274
00:11:11,720 --> 00:11:12,670
It wasn't that bad

275
00:11:12,670 --> 00:11:12,840
you know

276
00:11:12,840 --> 00:11:18,100
like for being done without a graphics tablet

277
00:11:18,110 --> 00:11:19,060
that's not that bad

278
00:11:19,210 --> 00:11:19,820
But remember

279
00:11:19,930 --> 00:11:22,670
if we select the plant and we go to sculpt mode

280
00:11:22,760 --> 00:11:26,750
we have the smooth and we can now smooth it all out

281
00:11:27,130 --> 00:11:28,600
smooth and smooth and smooth

282
00:11:28,660 --> 00:11:36,210
and I love this this thing for smoothing it and we can just move it as well if those two are touching Tomas together

283
00:11:36,360 --> 00:11:37,630
Okaythat's looking quite good

284
00:11:39,390 --> 00:11:45,120
And I was saying to people that we don't need to use the stroke with the wiggling because

285
00:11:45,160 --> 00:11:45,340
you know

286
00:11:45,720 --> 00:11:51,270
this can animate and I don't want to be animating the wiggle every single time of having to make a million drawings

287
00:11:51,580 --> 00:11:55,840
And you see here we have a new thing that's called visual effect properties

288
00:11:55,850 --> 00:11:57,620
This only appears on the grease pencil

289
00:11:57,630 --> 00:12:01,580
And also we have the modifiers are modifiers we use all the time

290
00:12:01,590 --> 00:12:03,020
Nowbecause they are dynamic

291
00:12:03,030 --> 00:12:06,040
they are completely different depending on what we are doing

292
00:12:06,150 --> 00:12:08,120
So in order to apply the effects

293
00:12:08,130 --> 00:12:11,200
one of the things we need to make sure is that they only apply on the viewport

294
00:12:11,210 --> 00:12:13,050
Shading is the most advanced of them

295
00:12:13,070 --> 00:12:18,950
And right now we went back to this ugly lighting because the program is using our scene lights and the world

296
00:12:18,960 --> 00:12:19,530
but we don't want that

297
00:12:19,910 --> 00:12:22,730
We just using the HD R S from from the program

298
00:12:22,950 --> 00:12:23,900
And let's for example

299
00:12:23,910 --> 00:12:28,930
add the Pixel 8 effect and now when we add it and we change the size of the pixels

300
00:12:28,940 --> 00:12:31,680
we see that now we made this pixelated effect in our drawing

301
00:12:32,510 --> 00:12:34,060
I don't know in which cases

302
00:12:34,100 --> 00:12:39,410
but it might be that someone wants to use grease pencil to create something that looks like an old video game

303
00:12:39,660 --> 00:12:40,800
And if you​‌​‌​​‌‌​​‌‌​​‌‌‌​‌‌​​‌‌​‌​‌​​‌‌​​‌‌​​‌‌​‌‌‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌​‌​‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌​‌‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌‌​​‌‌​‌​‌‌‌​‌​‌​‌​​‌‌‌‌‌‌​​‌‌​​​‌​​‌‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌‌​​‌​​‌‌‌‌‌‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌​‌​‌​​‌‌​‌‌‌​​‌‌‌​​‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌​​​‌‌‌​‌‌​​‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌‌​​‌‌​​‌‌​​‌‌‌​‌‌​​‌‌​​‌‌​​‌‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌‌​​‌​​‌‌​‌‌​​​‌‌​‌​‌​​‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌​‌‌‌​​‌‌‌‌‌‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌‌​​‌‌‌​‌​‌‌‌​​‌‌​‌‌​​​‌‌‌​​‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌​​‌‌​‌​‌​​‌‌​​​‌​​‌‌‌​​‌​​‌‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌​‌‌‌​​‌‌‌‌‌​​​‌‌​‌‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌​‌​‌‌‌​‌​‌‌‌​​‌‌​‌​‌​​‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌​‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌​‌‌​​​‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌‌​​‌​​‌‌​‌​‌‌‌​‌​‌‌​​​‌‌​‌‌‌‌‌​‌​‌​‌​​‌‌​‌​‌​​‌‌​‌​‌‌‌​‌‌​​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌‌​​‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌​​‌‌‌​​‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌​‌‌​​​‌‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌​‌‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌​‌​‌‌‌​‌​‌​‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌​​‌‌‌‌‌‌​​‌‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌​‌​‌‌‌​‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌​​​‌‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌​​‌‌‌​​‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌​​​‌‌‌‌‌​​​‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌​​‌​​‌‌​‌​‌‌‌​‌​‌‌‌​​‌‌​‌‌​​​‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌​‌‌‌​​‌‌‌‌‌​​​‌‌​‌​‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌‌​​‌‌‌​‌​‌‌‌‌‌​‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌‌​​‌‌‌‌‌‌​​‌‌​‌‌‌​​‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌‌​​‌​​‌‌​​‌‌​​‌‌‌​​‌​​‌‌‌​​‌​​‌‌​‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌ deactivate in the end

304
00:12:40,850 --> 00:12:42,560
alyzed suddenly look at that

305
00:12:42,570 --> 00:12:45,720
you are making a 3D kind of shape that is pixelated

306
00:12:45,900 --> 00:12:47,490
It's really cool as you move around

307
00:12:47,490 --> 00:12:49,120
And I guess you can animate with this as well

308
00:12:49,270 --> 00:12:51,160
Yeahyou can completely animate with this

309
00:12:51,230 --> 00:12:52,530
You could have another effect

310
00:12:52,540 --> 00:12:53,150
For example

311
00:12:53,150 --> 00:12:56,240
you could have this wave distortion and this wave distortion

312
00:12:56,270 --> 00:12:57,240
you can change the amplitude

313
00:12:57,240 --> 00:12:59,470
you can change the period to make it longer

314
00:13:00,010 --> 00:13:01,780
you could as well change the face

315
00:13:01,780 --> 00:13:05,890
So you could put some keyframes on this and make it look like a plant under the sea

316
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:09,190
The one I'm going to use actually is a modifier

317
00:13:09,190 --> 00:13:10,430
so the modifiers are dynamic

318
00:13:10,430 --> 00:13:12,560
so they change depending on the object we have

319
00:13:12,570 --> 00:13:16,300
and here we have the modifiers that can be applied to grease pencil

320
00:13:16,310 --> 00:13:17,170
and I love this one

321
00:13:17,170 --> 00:13:18,430
the noise modifier

322
00:13:18,450 --> 00:13:19,510
If we change the position

323
00:13:19,510 --> 00:13:20,550
we change the amount to that

324
00:13:20,900 --> 00:13:22,540
but then we can change the

325
00:13:22,550 --> 00:13:23,410
I think it's the

326
00:13:23,630 --> 00:13:30,880
let me see with the thickness strength noise scale here we are if we change the noise scale and we make it quite high

327
00:13:30,960 --> 00:13:33,120
and now we make the position a bit smaller

328
00:13:33,400 --> 00:13:34,390
look what we made

329
00:13:34,450 --> 00:13:37,260
we made something that looks like those squiggles

330
00:13:37,270 --> 00:13:40,260
especially when you look at it from from the distance

331
00:13:40,740 --> 00:13:42,030
But now here in randomized

332
00:13:42,030 --> 00:13:43,830
you see there is step 4

333
00:13:43,840 --> 00:13:46,880
so we are making it so it changes every four steps

334
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:48,780
so we can make a step 1

335
00:13:48,790 --> 00:13:51,800
So now every keyframe we move is changing

336
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:53,680
but I love that you can make for example

337
00:13:53,690 --> 00:13:55,140
every five frames

338
00:13:55,150 --> 00:13:56,390
So now when I play

339
00:13:56,400 --> 00:14:00,500
is doing that brilliant without you having to do it

340
00:14:00,570 --> 00:14:02,980
You every time It looks as if someone drew many

341
00:14:02,980 --> 00:14:03,500
many times

342
00:14:03,500 --> 00:14:04,030
but I didn't

343
00:14:04,510 --> 00:14:06,250
Okaythat effect looks fantastic

344
00:14:06,250 --> 00:14:13,840
Let's make sure that we are back in the frame 1 because that's gonna be very important when then we start learning of our animation

345
00:14:13,990 --> 00:14:16,230
And now let's go back to my plane

346
00:14:17,260 --> 00:14:18,000
Noto my plane

347
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,810
sorryto my reference

348
00:14:19,820 --> 00:14:22,350
And now we're going to draw these lines there

349
00:14:22,360 --> 00:14:24,910
So super simple to draw those lines

350
00:14:25,090 --> 00:14:26,520
Basically what we did before

351
00:14:26,530 --> 00:14:29,500
we're going to go make a new layer

352
00:14:30,040 --> 00:14:32,130
plant strokes

353
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:35,640
We know that we want them in at the front of our shape

354
00:14:35,780 --> 00:14:36,580
so they are there

355
00:14:36,590 --> 00:14:38,490
and now we're going to add a new material

356
00:14:38,640 --> 00:14:40,670
And we can just call this

357
00:14:40,680 --> 00:14:41,150
I don't know

358
00:14:41,160 --> 00:14:42,020
dark green

359
00:14:42,020 --> 00:14:42,780
for example

360
00:14:42,820 --> 00:14:44,370
dark green

361
00:14:46,440 --> 00:14:49,050
And now this dark green is only going to have a stroke

362
00:14:49,550 --> 00:14:51,470
We're gon na select the color of the dark

363
00:14:51,630 --> 00:14:52,440
Did I select the color

364
00:14:52,440 --> 00:14:56,300
I can zoom in a tiny bit more just to make sure that I selected that one

365
00:14:56,310 --> 00:14:59,010
Perfectand I'm going to go here to the front

366
00:14:59,060 --> 00:15:02,960
I'm just going to go to my draw mode and just draw those lines

367
00:15:02,960 --> 00:15:04,310
So I'm going to draw one there

368
00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:06,010
That might be a bit too thick

369
00:15:06,020 --> 00:15:07,210
so I'm going to change the radius there

370
00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:08,340
perfect

371
00:15:08,490 --> 00:15:09,860
I'm going to do one there

372
00:15:10,850 --> 00:15:11,810
one there

373
00:15:12,280 --> 00:15:13,310
and one there

374
00:15:13,350 --> 00:15:14,450
And you see what's happening

375
00:15:14,510 --> 00:15:15,740
This squiggle

376
00:15:15,820 --> 00:15:19,140
this effector I'm applying is applying as well to these lines

377
00:15:19,230 --> 00:15:22,510
so I can just make them a tiny bit accentuated

378
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:26,860
But it's really cool because all of these lines inside these are getting that animation effect

379
00:15:27,950 --> 00:15:28,730
Okay

380
00:15:28,740 --> 00:15:29,970
that's looking quite good to me

381
00:15:29,980 --> 00:15:31,750
That's looking fantastic

382
00:15:31,890 --> 00:15:34,920
Obviouslywe now need to do every single of the plant

383
00:15:34,930 --> 00:15:37,740
and I don't want to be boring people with making the plant

384
00:15:38,280 --> 00:15:42,530
so I'm going to draw them all and we're going to meet when all the plants are drawn

385
00:15:42,540 --> 00:15:44,620
And then we're going to be checking how to arrange them

386
00:15:44,620 --> 00:15:47,280
Because remember that these now are 3D objects

387
00:15:47,330 --> 00:15:56,970
We can move them around the scene and situate them so we get the effect that and in the next lesson as well as showing you how to we are arranging everything

388
00:15:56,970 --> 00:16:04,990
we're gon na see how to animate it because animating it is a and animations we're going to use as well for the mouth of our Carter

389
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:07,060
So there's a lot of stuff coming

390
00:16:07,500 --> 00:16:09,300
so be ready for the next lesson

391
00:16:09,310 --> 00:16:10,160
Okaysee you

392
00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:10,910
see you there
