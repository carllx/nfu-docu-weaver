00:00:04,940 --> 00:00:05,930
Hello Katie

2
00:00:05,960 --> 00:00:08,750
Hi and welcome to Noah Sin

3
00:00:09,280 --> 00:00:13,500
I love this one and we are going to be analyzing a bit how it was made

4
00:00:13,690 --> 00:00:16,660
We want people to be able to make their own illustrations

5
00:00:16,660 --> 00:00:20,970
So what we're going to be doing here is we're going to provide everyone this file

6
00:00:21,030 --> 00:00:22,800
This file as well has some animation

7
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:23,960
So when you play

8
00:00:23,990 --> 00:00:26,690
you can see how we use grease pencil to animate this little

9
00:00:26,820 --> 00:00:29,760
the deer having a bit of a snooze

10
00:00:30,210 --> 00:00:33,810
And also we want to explain how materials will build

11
00:00:33,820 --> 00:00:37,070
Like we know that we are always used grease pencil or grease pencil

12
00:00:37,170 --> 00:00:39,770
It's super versatile and depending on how we use it

13
00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:41,970
we can achieve completely different results

14
00:00:42,160 --> 00:00:42,360
Yeah

15
00:00:42,360 --> 00:00:45,020
and this one's really interesting because when I'm looking at it now

16
00:00:45,030 --> 00:00:46,380
it looks just like

17
00:00:46,390 --> 00:00:47,670
no is a 2D illustration

18
00:00:47,670 --> 00:00:49,610
but you're moving around it in 3D

19
00:00:49,650 --> 00:00:50,550
Not only that

20
00:00:50,740 --> 00:00:51,480
we also

21
00:00:51,480 --> 00:00:53,130
if we go here into post mode

22
00:00:53,150 --> 00:00:54,960
we have created some animation

23
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:56,020
So the car is rigged

24
00:00:56,960 --> 00:00:59,150
You can see here how I can move the legs

25
00:00:59,160 --> 00:01:00,570
I have the little pole

26
00:01:00,570 --> 00:01:02,660
so I can check where the leg is pointing at

27
00:01:02,670 --> 00:01:05,690
And even the tail animates with the lovely band

28
00:01:06,800 --> 00:01:07,280
We

29
00:01:07,330 --> 00:01:10,590
yesthis illustration is a bit different from what we've done before

30
00:01:10,590 --> 00:01:12,710
We are not going for a different 3D style

31
00:01:12,710 --> 00:01:13,090
Look

32
00:01:13,090 --> 00:01:17,980
What we are trying to achieve is exactly the same look that the original illustration had

33
00:01:18,850 --> 00:01:21,300
I think the original illustration is somewhere around here

34
00:01:21,310 --> 00:01:24,460
Yeahso we are achieving the same look that the original illustration h​‌​‌​​‌‌​​‌‌​​‌‌‌​‌‌​​‌‌​‌​‌​​‌‌​​‌‌​​‌‌​​‌‌​​‌‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌​‌‌‌‌‌​‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌​‌​‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌​‌‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌‌​​‌‌‌​​‌‌‌​‌​‌​‌​​‌‌‌‌‌‌​​‌‌​​​‌​​‌‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌​‌​‌‌‌​‌​‌​‌​​‌‌​‌‌‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌‌‌‌​​​‌‌‌​‌‌​​‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌‌​​‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌‌​‌‌​​‌‌​​‌‌​​‌‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌‌​​‌​​‌‌‌​​‌‌‌​‌​‌​‌​​‌‌‌‌‌​​​‌‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌‌​​‌‌‌​‌​‌‌‌​​‌‌​‌​‌‌‌​‌‌​​‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌​​‌‌‌​​‌‌‌​‌​​​‌​​‌‌‌​​‌​​‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌​‌‌‌​​‌‌‌‌‌​​​‌‌​‌‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌​‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌‌​​‌‌​‌​‌​​‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌​‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌​‌‌​​​‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌​‌‌​​​‌‌​‌​‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌​‌‌‌‌‌​‌​‌​‌​​‌‌​‌​‌​​‌‌​‌​‌‌‌​‌‌​​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌‌​​‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌​​‌‌‌​​‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌​‌‌‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌​‌‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌​​​‌‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌​‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌​​‌‌​‌​‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌​‌​‌‌‌​‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌‌​‌‌​​‌‌​​‌‌​​‌‌​‌​‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌​​​‌‌‌‌‌​​​‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌​​‌​​‌‌​‌​‌‌‌​‌​‌‌‌​​‌‌​‌‌​​​‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌​‌‌‌​​‌‌‌‌‌​​​‌‌​‌​‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌‌​​‌‌‌​‌​‌‌‌‌‌​‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌‌​​‌‌‌‌‌‌​​‌‌​‌‌‌​​‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌‌​​‌​​‌‌​​‌‌​​‌‌‌​​‌​​‌‌‌​​‌​​‌‌​‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌ad

35
00:01:25,070 --> 00:01:30,520
but we are being able now to look at it in 3D and look at it from every angle

36
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:32,280
So I figure you had to build in 3D

37
00:01:32,290 --> 00:01:32,740
right

38
00:01:32,750 --> 00:01:33,270
Yes

39
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:36,290
we can look at here at how this was made

40
00:01:36,300 --> 00:01:39,050
This all came from a 3D model

41
00:01:39,090 --> 00:01:41,970
and then we wrecked and then we applied a few things

42
00:01:41,970 --> 00:01:44,770
So you can see here that I have a little bit of a bump

43
00:01:45,080 --> 00:01:47,330
We're going to explain how that was created

44
00:01:47,460 --> 00:01:50,140
and the reason why was that was created

45
00:01:50,310 --> 00:01:55,120
The first thing we're going to show here is I'm going to go file new general

46
00:01:55,370 --> 00:01:56,770
I'm not going to save this

47
00:01:56,780 --> 00:02:01,000
And I want to show how we made the main part of the material on this program

48
00:02:01,160 --> 00:02:04,540
So we have a problem is that when we have 3D

49
00:02:04,630 --> 00:02:06,140
even if we are using Eev

50
00:02:06,540 --> 00:02:08,480
we are getting some type of lighting

51
00:02:08,480 --> 00:02:12,620
You can see here when I rotate it is affecting my

52
00:02:12,630 --> 00:02:15,250
the layers like the different faces of my cube

53
00:02:15,570 --> 00:02:18,590
If I want the cube to have a completely solid color

54
00:02:18,740 --> 00:02:24,300
what we can do is automatically this cube comes with a material called material

55
00:02:24,590 --> 00:02:26,810
So we can go here into my

56
00:02:26,820 --> 00:02:28,530
is this in shading

57
00:02:28,540 --> 00:02:35,050
And we are going to get rid of the principal bsdf This is the one that we usually use has all the specular rough

58
00:02:35,870 --> 00:02:38,170
but we don't really want to do that

59
00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:44,220
We don't want to use any of those properties because the only thing that we're going to need is an emission

60
00:02:44,230 --> 00:02:45,910
So this is an emission color

61
00:02:45,950 --> 00:02:48,150
So animation is a single color

62
00:02:48,150 --> 00:02:53,640
a solid color that the material is going to emanate

63
00:02:53,650 --> 00:02:54,770
but it's not light

64
00:02:54,780 --> 00:02:56,240
it's not an emission in terms of light

65
00:02:56,250 --> 00:02:57,630
we I'm not going to illuminate the scene

66
00:02:57,630 --> 00:02:59,830
The only thing we're going to apply is this color to the

67
00:03:00,500 --> 00:03:02,960
and now when I changed my color

68
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,490
whatever color I use

69
00:03:04,500 --> 00:03:07,190
my material is going to be exactly that color

70
00:03:07,190 --> 00:03:08,360
I can go here to layout

71
00:03:08,730 --> 00:03:11,080
and now we only have one option in my material

72
00:03:11,080 --> 00:03:12,770
which is the color that's it

73
00:03:12,950 --> 00:03:13,640
that's can

74
00:03:13,640 --> 00:03:14,840
So it looks completely flat

75
00:03:15,130 --> 00:03:16,340
but you are still moving around

76
00:03:16,340 --> 00:03:17,400
It still is a 3D cube

77
00:03:17,590 --> 00:03:19,460
exactlywe still have a 3D cube

78
00:03:19,470 --> 00:03:21,040
If we go to the previous setting

79
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:22,430
we are still there

80
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:24,950
but now when I look at it from here

81
00:03:24,960 --> 00:03:26,990
it's all the time going to look completely flat

82
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,950
That's what we did with the illustration from No

83
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:31,870
I can go back here to the illustration from Noah

84
00:03:31,990 --> 00:03:34,780
And you can see here that most of the materials

85
00:03:34,790 --> 00:03:37,260
or actually all the materials I have here

86
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:39,780
if I go inside my material setting

87
00:03:39,830 --> 00:03:42,140
I have just one material with one emission

88
00:03:42,820 --> 00:03:43,460
Okay

89
00:03:43,470 --> 00:03:48,240
we have another thing that we have in this project that maybe someone might be wondering

90
00:03:48,320 --> 00:03:48,880
why is that

91
00:03:48,930 --> 00:03:50,160
When we go here

92
00:03:50,170 --> 00:03:51,740
we are having all these bumps

93
00:03:52,310 --> 00:03:54,980
Yeahso we wanted to do this thing

94
00:03:54,980 --> 00:04:02,720
We wanted to get a little bit of a wiggly edge around all my 3D objects because that allows us

95
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:03,660
when we rotate

96
00:04:03,670 --> 00:04:07,430
it looks as if it was like just drawn with with a hand drawn pen

97
00:04:07,860 --> 00:04:17,810
But one of the problems that we had is that there is an option inside this program that kind of was supposed to be used for doing that

98
00:04:17,810 --> 00:04:19,050
So if you select VR

99
00:04:19,230 --> 00:04:23,290
you can go to add grease pencil that you have a collection line art

100
00:04:23,310 --> 00:04:27,250
That means that we are going to apply linear to this entire collection

101
00:04:27,260 --> 00:04:31,600
And the first thing I discovered that you need to do is you need to be looking at the scene through a camera

102
00:04:31,610 --> 00:04:34,100
So I'm going to be looking at it through my camera

103
00:04:34,110 --> 00:04:37,090
I'm going look my camera to the view

104
00:04:37,100 --> 00:04:38,330
So I'm going to be looking at it

105
00:04:38,330 --> 00:04:41,920
So the camera I'm going to be selecting here I'm going to add Kristen

106
00:04:41,920 --> 00:04:45,310
so seeing lineart and as soon as I do it

107
00:04:45,460 --> 00:04:51,120
we are seeing what the program is doing is adding lines on the edge of my entire object

108
00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:55,030
And right now you're getting all of these little dots for one reason

109
00:04:55,030 --> 00:04:58,120
The reason why we're getting is because we are applying another effect

110
00:04:58,130 --> 00:05:01,550
which in this case is this display toate my displays

111
00:05:01,960 --> 00:05:06,360
I'm going to deactivate my displays here and I'm going to deactivate my displays here

112
00:05:06,820 --> 00:05:08,950
Ohmy displays only

113
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:12,970
I'm going to deactivate displays so you can see what the program can do

114
00:05:12,980 --> 00:05:21,240
It can generate these linear that covers around my object and theres a lovely effect of

115
00:05:21,400 --> 00:05:21,870
of like

116
00:05:22,440 --> 00:05:22,670
you know

117
00:05:22,670 --> 00:05:23,900
like if it was an outline

118
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:25,440
yeahit looks like a cartoon

119
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:25,690
doesn't it

120
00:05:25,700 --> 00:05:26,150
And again

121
00:05:26,150 --> 00:05:27,700
you can move around it in 3D

122
00:05:27,760 --> 00:05:31,220
The problem with this effect is first is a bit slow

123
00:05:31,240 --> 00:05:34,690
So you can see that it's slowing down my program quite a lot

124
00:05:34,700 --> 00:05:38,570
And I always wanted to have something that was live that could work live in my stream

125
00:05:39,180 --> 00:05:42,280
But my second problem is that I can change the color

126
00:05:42,290 --> 00:05:50,490
but I would have to generate a single lineart pair material in order to have the color of the edge to be how I wanted it

127
00:05:50,920 --> 00:05:53,123
And then I could go into my line art

128
00:05:53,123 --> 00:05:53,613
You know

129
00:05:53,613 --> 00:05:55,572
when I generated my linear

130
00:05:55,572 --> 00:05:56,551
I could go into

131
00:05:56,551 --> 00:05:57,286
where are you

132
00:05:57,286 --> 00:05:58,510
Is this this line art

133
00:05:58,510 --> 00:06:01,630
YeahI could go into line and apply effects

134
00:06:01,630 --> 00:06:02,560
I could apply

135
00:06:02,570 --> 00:06:03,000
for example

136
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,950
a noise to make it more quickly

137
00:06:05,500 --> 00:06:06,780
to give you that jagged edge

138
00:06:07,020 --> 00:06:07,870
But in reality

139
00:06:07,870 --> 00:06:09,280
Iyou only wanted the jagged edge

140
00:06:09,290 --> 00:06:11,480
I didn't want that outline because this

141
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:13,830
this illustration

142
00:06:13,830 --> 00:06:15,240
there is an illustration when we show it

143
00:06:15,330 --> 00:06:16,690
I'm going to show it again

144
00:06:17,240 --> 00:06:18,650
didn't have an it

145
00:06:18,680 --> 00:06:20,870
The only thing I have is the squibbing edges

146
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:23,270
So I decided I was going to do it

147
00:06:23,270 --> 00:06:25,240
applying some noise to the material

148
00:06:25,730 --> 00:06:27,400
And to apply noise to the material

149
00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:29,670
I wanted to apply a displacement noise

150
00:06:29,880 --> 00:06:32,040
So that would allow my geometry to Dis

151
00:06:32,690 --> 00:06:34,000
And to apply a displacement noise

152
00:06:34,180 --> 00:06:36,280
usually you can do it inside your shading panel

153
00:06:36,620 --> 00:06:38,120
Do you remember like you go to shading

154
00:06:38,120 --> 00:06:39,840
there's a displacement map and you add it

155
00:06:40,060 --> 00:06:42,550
The problem is that because we're using evon

156
00:06:42,550 --> 00:06:47,530
not cycles Eev doesn't allow for displacement because it takes quite a lot of time to display some material

157
00:06:48,090 --> 00:06:49,450
So if you're using Eev

158
00:06:49,730 --> 00:06:53,160
instead of applying your displacement as a texture in the material

159
00:06:53,170 --> 00:06:56,740
we can simply go to the object and apply a modifier

160
00:06:56,750 --> 00:06:58,290
And the modifier is called display

161
00:06:58,300 --> 00:07:04,160
So you add a modifier and you need to find it here is here in where are you

162
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:05,090
Displays

163
00:07:05,590 --> 00:07:06,710
Displayshere it is

164
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:07,820
You can see that

165
00:07:07,870 --> 00:07:09,380
So after I applied that

166
00:07:09,620 --> 00:07:11,940
the only thing I need to do is load the texture

167
00:07:11,940 --> 00:07:12,620
And in this case

168
00:07:12,630 --> 00:07:14,350
I loaded a noise texture

169
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:18,410
You can just generate a noise inside the program or you can load a noise texture

170
00:07:18,490 --> 00:07:22,970
you can create a noise texture inside Photoshop it however you want

171
00:07:23,140 --> 00:07:25,200
So once you apply the noise texture

172
00:07:25,210 --> 00:07:26,830
when you activate it

173
00:07:26,860 --> 00:07:29,680
what it's doing is I can see it here

174
00:07:29,750 --> 00:07:32,000
it modifying the entire geometry

175
00:07:32,010 --> 00:07:34,830
putting it up and down in reality is up and down everywhere

176
00:07:34,830 --> 00:07:35,820
not only in the edges

177
00:07:35,820 --> 00:07:40,650
but because my viewing is completely flat for the human eye looks as if it's only in the edges

178
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:42,640
Yeahand so is that a much lighter way it works

179
00:07:44,270 --> 00:07:46,080
It is a bit heavy

180
00:07:46,260 --> 00:07:47,340
but as you can see

181
00:07:47,350 --> 00:07:48,470
it's moving quite well

182
00:07:48,480 --> 00:07:55,320
And the cool thing about it is that you can change how heavy it is depending on the subdivisions you have in your geometric

183
00:07:55,380 --> 00:07:59,950
because obviously I cannot display something if there is not enough you

184
00:08:00,320 --> 00:08:02,990
So imagine if I have only one subdivision

185
00:08:03,500 --> 00:08:05,590
So you can see that with one subdivision

186
00:08:05,690 --> 00:08:09,110
it's very difficult to see the effect because there is no enough geometry

187
00:08:09,130 --> 00:08:09,780
But I can make

188
00:08:09,790 --> 00:08:10,380
for example

189
00:08:10,380 --> 00:08:11,080
two subdivisions

190
00:08:11,370 --> 00:08:12,720
and I'm starting to see more

191
00:08:12,770 --> 00:08:14,070
and I can make 3

192
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:15,160
I can make four

193
00:08:15,170 --> 00:08:15,710
and I can make 5

194
00:08:15,790 --> 00:08:16,930
I can make 6

195
00:08:16,940 --> 00:08:17,910
if I make 6

196
00:08:17,910 --> 00:08:20,240
my program might start going a bit slowly

197
00:08:20,330 --> 00:08:23,320
But the cool thing about subdivision is I can put three here

198
00:08:23,330 --> 00:08:25,780
and I can put five in my render time

199
00:08:25,920 --> 00:08:28,360
so I can be working completely fine in my project

200
00:08:28,810 --> 00:08:30,830
and then when I render it in the end

201
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:31,750
it's going to render well

202
00:08:32,070 --> 00:08:36,250
So this was the most kind of flexible way

203
00:08:36,250 --> 00:08:39,160
I found to do this type of effect

204
00:08:39,170 --> 00:08:40,050
So remember

205
00:08:40,050 --> 00:08:43,090
simply add a displacement texture after a subdivision

206
00:08:43,220 --> 00:08:44,350
put a noise in it

207
00:08:44,770 --> 00:08:47,660
and then you're going to be able to get those quickly edges perfect

208
00:08:48,730 --> 00:08:51,100
The other things I did about this

209
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:53,340
as well as modeling that

210
00:08:53,350 --> 00:08:53,710
you know

211
00:08:53,710 --> 00:08:56,570
like modeling is basically coming from cube

212
00:08:56,580 --> 00:08:58,650
You can imagine this is a cube with the extrusion from the leg

213
00:08:59,250 --> 00:09:01,180
This head was a separate object

214
00:09:01,450 --> 00:09:06,060
The only other thing was creating all the grease pencil object

215
00:09:06,060 --> 00:09:13,340
So this was an animation that I made and instead of animating it three times

216
00:09:13,480 --> 00:09:17,030
I made only one animation in which I made this set to move around

217
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:18,460
like from going to one position

218
00:09:18,460 --> 00:09:20,330
you can see I made this position

219
00:09:20,390 --> 00:09:21,520
this position here

220
00:09:21,530 --> 00:09:22,570
and this position here

221
00:09:22,580 --> 00:09:24,080
And then I made transitions between them

222
00:09:24,440 --> 00:09:26,340
But instead of making it three times

223
00:09:26,340 --> 00:09:28,010
what I did is I only made one

224
00:09:28,150 --> 00:09:30,340
and then I copied them a few times

225
00:09:30,380 --> 00:09:33,930
and then I used the time of set that we use in our main course

226
00:09:34,210 --> 00:09:36,200
and then I changed the time of

227
00:09:36,330 --> 00:09:36,630
you know

228
00:09:36,630 --> 00:09:38,260
like it goes from 1 to 71

229
00:09:38,460 --> 00:09:40,640
But now I can change my frame offset

230
00:09:40,730 --> 00:09:42,910
So if you wanted to have a fourth copy

231
00:09:42,910 --> 00:09:43,620
you could do the same

232
00:09:43,620 --> 00:09:44,420
you make another copy

233
00:09:44,420 --> 00:09:48,920
and now when you make the frame of you are simply making them animate at different times

234
00:09:49,260 --> 00:09:51,030
that's very clever as simple as that

235
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:54,750
and then all the grease pencil I'm using I'm using the noise effect

236
00:09:54,750 --> 00:09:57,550
so they are always changing every

237
00:09:57,550 --> 00:09:57,800
you know

238
00:09:57,810 --> 00:09:58,900
I don't know how many frames

239
00:09:58,960 --> 00:09:59,940
every four frames

240
00:10:00,150 --> 00:10:02,820
Because it creates that effect as if something is hand-drawn

241
00:10:02,820 --> 00:10:04,360
I really like doing that

242
00:10:04,370 --> 00:10:05,080
And in the course

243
00:10:05,080 --> 00:10:08,640
we learn about how you can draw grease pencil onto the surface of an object

244
00:10:08,740 --> 00:10:10,020
It looked like you did that here

245
00:10:10,070 --> 00:10:14,120
Yeahso I only did it actually for this 1

246
00:10:14,130 --> 00:10:15,210
I did it for the nose

247
00:10:15,400 --> 00:10:20,120
I think for the rest I drew in a completely flat way and then I adapted it

248
00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:22,200
But you can do it if you feel like

249
00:10:22,210 --> 00:10:23,000
as I'm saying

250
00:10:23,010 --> 00:10:24,790
sometimes it does work that well

251
00:10:24,790 --> 00:10:25,570
I think I used it

252
00:10:25,580 --> 00:10:27,850
I used it actually as well for this DOC

253
00:10:28,120 --> 00:10:30,340
but you can see here I used quite a lot of distance

254
00:10:30,340 --> 00:10:32,960
you can see the distance between this grease pencil and the DOC

255
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:34,760
but I can

256
00:10:34,900 --> 00:10:37,090
I recommend only using it if you really need it

257
00:10:37,650 --> 00:10:38,070
If not

258
00:10:38,080 --> 00:10:47,020
rememberyou can always draw in a completely flat way and then you can simply move the object to the position and then you can use the sculpting

259
00:10:47,020 --> 00:10:47,220
you know

260
00:10:47,410 --> 00:10:48,600
always with the sculpt mode

261
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:51,210
you can modify and move your objects

262
00:10:51,220 --> 00:10:55,650
So you can just adapt them and rotate them and make them to go a bit closer to the geometry

263
00:10:55,900 --> 00:10:56,220
Oh yes

264
00:10:56,220 --> 00:10:57,520
you can kind of get just where you want

265
00:10:58,390 --> 00:10:59,820
And the cool thing as well

266
00:10:59,820 --> 00:11:03,230
you can see here is that grease pencil gets affected by armature

267
00:11:03,230 --> 00:11:11,570
So when I created my armature now when I go into my post mode I'm moving everything and my entire grid pencils is moving with my geometry

268
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:13,550
So in the next mini

269
00:11:13,550 --> 00:11:14,430
minimini lesson

270
00:11:14,630 --> 00:11:20,520
we're gon na see how it is to rig this character without having to use all the complexity

271
00:11:20,520 --> 00:11:22,490
From Rigby we made a simple rig

272
00:11:22,610 --> 00:11:25,680
I know that there is an entire course about rigging in school

273
00:11:25,690 --> 00:11:34,100
but I know a lot of people is going to Na want to know how do we rig something like this tail and how they will RI these legs without having to go through the entire rectify

274
00:11:34,110 --> 00:11:37,260
So we're going to have this little lesson and we're going to explain it

275
00:11:37,400 --> 00:11:40,350
and then you're gon na be able to make things like this yourself

276
00:11:40,500 --> 00:11:41,700
Perfect to see you in the next lesson

277
00:11:41,710 --> 00:11:42,340
bye
