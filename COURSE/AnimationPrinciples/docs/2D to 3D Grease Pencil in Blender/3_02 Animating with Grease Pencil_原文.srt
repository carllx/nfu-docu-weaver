1
00:00:01,690 --> 00:00:05,240
So after the time lapse in which we do all those plants

2
00:00:05,240 --> 00:00:07,320
let's really organiz​‌​‌​​‌‌​​‌‌​​‌‌‌​‌‌​​‌‌​‌​‌​​‌‌​​‌‌​​‌‌‌‌‌​​​‌‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌​​​‌​​‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌​‌​‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌​‌‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌‌​​‌‌​‌‌‌​​‌‌​‌​‌​​‌‌‌‌‌‌​​‌‌​​​‌​​‌‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌​‌​‌​​‌‌‌‌‌‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌‌​​‌‌‌​‌​‌​‌​​‌‌​‌‌‌​​‌‌‌​​‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌​​​‌‌‌​‌‌​​‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌‌​​‌‌‌​‌‌​​‌‌‌​‌‌​​‌‌​​‌‌​​‌‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌‌​​‌​​‌‌​‌​‌​​‌‌​‌​‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌‌​​‌‌‌​‌​‌‌‌​​‌‌‌​‌‌​​‌‌‌​​‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌​​‌‌‌​‌‌​​‌‌​​​‌​​‌‌‌​​‌​​‌‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌​‌‌‌​​‌‌‌‌‌​​​‌‌​‌‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌​‌​‌‌‌​‌​‌‌‌​​‌‌​‌​‌​​‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌​‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌​‌‌​​​‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌​‌​‌‌‌​‌​‌‌‌‌‌​‌​‌‌‌‌‌​‌​‌​‌​​‌‌​‌​‌​​‌‌​‌​‌‌‌​‌‌​​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌‌​​‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌​​‌‌‌​​‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌​‌‌​​​‌‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌​‌‌‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌​‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌​​‌‌​‌​‌​​‌‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌​‌​‌‌‌​‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌‌​​‌​​‌‌​​‌‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌​​​‌‌‌‌‌​​​‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌​​‌​​‌‌​‌​‌‌‌​‌​‌‌‌​​‌‌​‌‌​​​‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌​‌‌‌​​‌‌‌‌‌​​​‌‌​‌​‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌‌​​‌‌‌​‌​‌‌‌‌‌​‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌‌​​‌‌‌‌‌‌​​‌‌​‌‌‌​​‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌‌​​‌​​‌‌​​‌‌​​‌‌‌​​‌​​‌‌‌​​‌​​‌‌​‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌e them

3
00:00:07,320 --> 00:00:10,240
And this lesson is going to be about how to animate not only those plants

4
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:14,520
but also the eyes and the mouth of our Carter believe

5
00:00:14,790 --> 00:00:17,580
So I'm gonna select these plants and some of them

6
00:00:17,620 --> 00:00:19,500
the anchor point is gonna be in the correct position

7
00:00:19,510 --> 00:00:20,120
but this one

8
00:00:20,120 --> 00:00:20,490
for example

9
00:00:20,490 --> 00:00:21,500
needs to be a bit more up

10
00:00:21,900 --> 00:00:22,440
Other ones

11
00:00:22,440 --> 00:00:23,120
for example

12
00:00:23,130 --> 00:00:24,990
the anchor point is in the incorrect position

13
00:00:25,060 --> 00:00:29,070
So we just affect only origins and we put this at the very beginning angle

14
00:00:29,550 --> 00:00:30,330
as simple as that

15
00:00:30,350 --> 00:00:33,050
So with the new exclusive of animation

16
00:00:33,230 --> 00:00:33,850
I guess

17
00:00:34,440 --> 00:00:37,390
we are actually not going to animate using that mode

18
00:00:37,400 --> 00:00:37,680
It could

19
00:00:37,830 --> 00:00:39,850
it's possible completely to animate like that

20
00:00:39,950 --> 00:00:43,270
So we could animate a bit of rotation doing this

21
00:00:43,300 --> 00:00:46,740
So we would be moving all the objects at the same time

22
00:00:46,860 --> 00:00:48,810
but we want something a tiny bit more complex

23
00:00:48,860 --> 00:00:51,310
so that's not really giving us what we wanted

24
00:00:51,740 --> 00:00:52,610
Okay

25
00:00:52,620 --> 00:00:53,530
that's good there

26
00:00:53,570 --> 00:00:54,360
and I think this plant

27
00:00:54,370 --> 00:00:54,850
oh no

28
00:00:55,090 --> 00:00:56,040
this one needs to be there

29
00:00:56,110 --> 00:00:59,150
So all the plants now have the anchor points where they should

30
00:00:59,190 --> 00:01:08,790
So now we are going to activate my reference image and let's see where the elements were in the reference image so we can see that this plant was here

31
00:01:09,260 --> 00:01:11,530
we can see that this one

32
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:14,570
oh I'm going to move it up so it's not intersecting there

33
00:01:14,810 --> 00:01:18,490
This one was a bit behind the Carter

34
00:01:19,320 --> 00:01:22,270
this one was a bit like that

35
00:01:22,280 --> 00:01:23,880
That's looking good there

36
00:01:23,930 --> 00:01:25,490
and now it doesn't need to be exact

37
00:01:25,510 --> 00:01:28,880
but it's good to kind of start putting everything in position

38
00:01:28,940 --> 00:01:32,160
so it looks pretty okay and this one

39
00:01:32,170 --> 00:01:33,310
Ohthis 1 I forgot

40
00:01:33,330 --> 00:01:34,150
I know it's good

41
00:01:34,690 --> 00:01:35,770
this one goes down

42
00:01:35,930 --> 00:01:37,500
okaythat's looking good

43
00:01:37,720 --> 00:01:40,050
that's having enough plants surrounding my car

44
00:01:40,140 --> 00:01:42,360
The only 1 I would put this one a bit on front

45
00:01:42,370 --> 00:01:44,150
I like that it was covering a bit of leg

46
00:01:45,050 --> 00:01:51,820
it's nice to have the surrounding of the character because as well in that if we do that people are really going to see how this all was in 3D

47
00:01:52,090 --> 00:01:53,140
especially when they move

48
00:01:53,140 --> 00:01:54,500
that's going to be very lovely

49
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:55,220
Okay

50
00:01:55,230 --> 00:02:03,340
so I'm already seeing one little problem is that I have some keyframes that are on the 0．62

51
00:02:03,350 --> 00:02:07,960
that's because I was drawing on the layer 62 and that's very typical

52
00:02:07,960 --> 00:02:10,300
no worries if that happens we're gon na solve that

53
00:02:10,310 --> 00:02:11,810
but it's something that I've done wrong

54
00:02:11,850 --> 00:02:14,720
I think the first plant probably was drawn on the frame one

55
00:02:15,070 --> 00:02:17,170
but these ones were drawn not second

56
00:02:17,170 --> 00:02:19,390
but frame 62 accidentally

57
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:21,080
so we're gon na solve that in a second

58
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:26,070
so should we start kind of checking how animation works

59
00:02:26,070 --> 00:02:26,390
Yeah

60
00:02:26,390 --> 00:02:27,200
let's find out

61
00:02:27,210 --> 00:02:29,560
okaywe're gon na go here to 2D animation

62
00:02:29,560 --> 00:02:31,950
that's the way we're going to modify and as I was saying

63
00:02:31,950 --> 00:02:34,450
we don't need 250 frames of animation

64
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:36,910
Probably something like 100 is going to be enough

65
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:38,280
And now 100

66
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:39,930
we can zoom in a tiny bit there

67
00:02:39,940 --> 00:02:42,860
So we go from one to 100 and now I'm gon na

68
00:02:42,860 --> 00:02:43,750
go to frame 1

69
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:46,160
I'm going to try to move everything I can

70
00:02:46,180 --> 00:02:48,470
I'm gonna select everything in that shape

71
00:02:48,660 --> 00:02:49,790
move it to frame 1

72
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:52,680
You see that those shapes disappeared because there was nothing on that frame

73
00:02:52,780 --> 00:02:56,360
So that's why it's important to go now to plan for

74
00:02:56,370 --> 00:02:57,920
I'm going to move it to frame 1

75
00:02:58,160 --> 00:03:00,900
Okayso these are all the ones accidentally

76
00:03:01,700 --> 00:03:03,330
okaynice to know you can fix that easily

77
00:03:03,340 --> 00:03:04,740
Yesand it's good

78
00:03:04,750 --> 00:03:06,200
sometimes it can be confusing that

79
00:03:06,210 --> 00:03:09,220
And it's normal because sometimes we are testing the animation and we forget that

80
00:03:09,230 --> 00:03:11,040
So now all my plants are in frame 1

81
00:03:11,240 --> 00:03:12,660
and let's see how we can do animation

82
00:03:12,730 --> 00:03:15,370
So we have a few different ways of animating in grease pencil

83
00:03:15,370 --> 00:03:17,110
One of them is frame by frame animation

84
00:03:17,110 --> 00:03:18,960
so we draw something on the first frame

85
00:03:18,960 --> 00:03:21,730
then we draw on the next one and go frame by frame

86
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:23,420
So a bit like we would do

87
00:03:23,420 --> 00:03:24,100
for example

88
00:03:24,110 --> 00:03:27,060
in programs like Photoshop or Procreate or Animate

89
00:03:28,010 --> 00:03:37,730
Another way in which we could do it is we could just have two positions and then tell the program to interpolate between them a bit more what we do when we are animating in 3D or for example

90
00:03:37,850 --> 00:03:39,600
how we would do it in After Effects

91
00:03:39,880 --> 00:03:43,210
So we're going to be looking at those both ways of doing it

92
00:03:43,540 --> 00:03:44,710
Now we're going to deactivate

93
00:03:46,540 --> 00:03:47,850
I'm gonna hide everything

94
00:03:47,860 --> 00:03:49,600
I'm gonna go to my frontal view

95
00:03:49,940 --> 00:03:51,190
put a new grease pencil

96
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:51,980
and I put it here

97
00:03:51,990 --> 00:03:52,870
a blank grease pencil

98
00:03:52,870 --> 00:03:54,770
and let's start understanding how it works

99
00:03:54,850 --> 00:03:56,100
You see here we have the timeline

100
00:03:56,430 --> 00:03:58,410
Make sure you are in this timeline

101
00:03:58,420 --> 00:03:59,380
Exactly this one

102
00:03:59,380 --> 00:04:14,080
That is the one that appears when we have the 2D animation and we have grease pencil selected because it happened to me in the past that I have the normal timeline in layout and that timeline you can not copy and paste grease pencil keyframes

103
00:04:14,270 --> 00:04:14,440
Okay

104
00:04:14,520 --> 00:04:15,750
We want to make sure we're in 2D animation

105
00:04:16,220 --> 00:04:19,430
exactly draw something

106
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:20,710
I'm going to draw this shape

107
00:04:21,020 --> 00:04:22,850
And if it's not very visible

108
00:04:23,130 --> 00:04:27,920
let's maybe make it so the material of the line of the stroke is white

109
00:04:28,040 --> 00:04:29,710
So I'm going to draw this line

110
00:04:29,960 --> 00:04:32,420
and now I'm going to go to a different frame

111
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:34,780
And here we have activated

112
00:04:34,780 --> 00:04:39,240
I have activated this because it's convenient to activate my auto key if you don't have it activated

113
00:04:39,250 --> 00:04:41,130
If I draw here now

114
00:04:41,140 --> 00:04:43,440
my drawing got added to the first keyframe

115
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:47,170
The program is deducing that because I didn't create new keyframes

116
00:04:47,390 --> 00:04:51,600
I just wanted my drawing to be added only to the first one

117
00:04:52,030 --> 00:04:59,310
Actuallythe keyframe get added when I created the grease pencil that twice before I was in frame 60 and it got added to the frame 60

118
00:04:59,400 --> 00:04:59,940
Oh yeah

119
00:05:00,070 --> 00:05:04,040
but now what we're going to do when we have it in this auto key mode

120
00:05:04,100 --> 00:05:06,340
when I go to another frame and I draw the line

121
00:05:06,340 --> 00:05:06,790
for example

122
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:08,520
I can draw the line here

123
00:05:09,190 --> 00:05:14,060
Now the previous line disappear and there is this connection between the two keyframes

124
00:05:14,060 --> 00:05:16,140
And you see now I go from one to another

125
00:05:16,790 --> 00:05:20,270
So now I could go later and I could make my line to go there

126
00:05:20,670 --> 00:05:23,560
and I could go later and make my line to move there

127
00:05:23,830 --> 00:05:24,920
And now let's see what's happening

128
00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:27,820
Now's starting to generate this animation

129
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:28,840
Do you see that

130
00:05:28,870 --> 00:05:32,150
Right now I don't have any reference on where my previous line was

131
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:32,490
If I go

132
00:05:32,700 --> 00:05:33,860
I think another of the modes

133
00:05:33,870 --> 00:05:36,000
if you go here to this viewport shading

134
00:05:36,200 --> 00:05:40,010
you see that we have in green the previous line and in purple

135
00:05:40,150 --> 00:05:41,150
the next line

136
00:05:41,160 --> 00:05:42,150
That is really

137
00:05:42,150 --> 00:05:45,280
really useful because that's going to allow us to know what's happening

138
00:05:45,340 --> 00:05:48,890
And if you want to modify that in audio scaling

139
00:05:48,890 --> 00:05:50,890
here you see that we have the mode keyframes

140
00:05:50,890 --> 00:05:53,330
You can change the opacity of how those lines appears

141
00:05:53,340 --> 00:05:56,120
And you can say how many frames before and after appear

142
00:05:56,120 --> 00:05:56,700
So right now

143
00:05:56,700 --> 00:05:59,220
we only have one frame before and one frame after

144
00:05:59,290 --> 00:05:59,940
but we can do two

145
00:06:00,500 --> 00:06:02,920
So now I actually don't have any more after

146
00:06:02,920 --> 00:06:03,550
I only have one

147
00:06:03,670 --> 00:06:06,530
but now we're getting two levels of green and one of purple

148
00:06:06,700 --> 00:06:07,170
That's great

149
00:06:07,180 --> 00:06:10,010
and anyone who knows about 2D animation will find that super useful

150
00:06:10,020 --> 00:06:10,410
Yeah

151
00:06:10,420 --> 00:06:13,750
we'll be having more courses in 2D animation in the school

152
00:06:14,140 --> 00:06:15,090
but for now

153
00:06:15,100 --> 00:06:21,110
we want you to understand that this is the way in which you would do frame by frame animation inside this program keyframes

154
00:06:21,110 --> 00:06:21,620
by the way

155
00:06:21,620 --> 00:06:23,000
if you don't want them to delay that

156
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,660
you could also copy the keyframe

157
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:28,290
go here to 26 and paste it

158
00:06:28,360 --> 00:06:28,970
Let me see

159
00:06:28,980 --> 00:06:29,820
copypaste

160
00:06:29,830 --> 00:06:33,970
And now what I did is I went from one keyframe and I copied it in another one

161
00:06:34,420 --> 00:06:36,770
but the keyframe once it's there

162
00:06:36,780 --> 00:06:37,640
we can go to

163
00:06:37,640 --> 00:06:38,160
for example

164
00:06:38,210 --> 00:06:40,240
sculpt mode sculpted

165
00:06:41,340 --> 00:06:45,780
and now what I'm doing is I'm having that keyframe and now it's changing when I have it there

166
00:06:46,200 --> 00:06:48,250
Okayso you can have a very smooth change like that

167
00:06:48,310 --> 00:06:50,990
Yeahand it means that you don't need to draw again

168
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,680
I can just copy this

169
00:06:52,740 --> 00:06:53,600
paste it

170
00:06:53,700 --> 00:06:55,180
copypaste up

171
00:06:55,340 --> 00:06:56,250
copy paste

172
00:06:56,300 --> 00:06:57,390
and now modified

173
00:06:57,400 --> 00:06:59,210
and you can see where the previous one was

174
00:06:59,260 --> 00:07:01,170
and you can animate with the sculpting

175
00:07:01,170 --> 00:07:01,650
You know

176
00:07:01,660 --> 00:07:03,720
it's a way of animating just with the scope

177
00:07:04,040 --> 00:07:05,090
That's a nice way of doing it

178
00:07:05,270 --> 00:07:05,900
Yeah

179
00:07:06,370 --> 00:07:08,340
and this is exactly what we're going to do for the plants

180
00:07:08,820 --> 00:07:14,330
so we're just going to use a scoped mode to generate a bit of a gentle rotation

181
00:07:14,630 --> 00:07:19,310
and then we're going to see how the program can interpolate between these positions

182
00:07:20,120 --> 00:07:22,050
And before we move

183
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:26,020
let's explain what I mean with interpolate V between these positions

184
00:07:26,060 --> 00:07:28,510
So you see that we have this shape there

185
00:07:28,520 --> 00:07:32,310
and I'm going to copy and paste it because I think people are going to understand it much better like that

186
00:07:32,380 --> 00:07:33,530
and I'm going to put that there

187
00:07:33,530 --> 00:07:37,070
and I'm going to make a new position of this shape I'm gonna put that there

188
00:07:37,470 --> 00:07:39,750
And for interpolation to work well

189
00:07:39,750 --> 00:07:41,420
we need shapes that are similar

190
00:07:41,420 --> 00:07:42,730
So because I'm doing a sculpting

191
00:07:42,730 --> 00:07:44,940
the number of points on the shape are going to be the same

192
00:07:44,990 --> 00:07:46,790
So I have one shape that starts here

193
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:51,440
another shape that continues there if you want to interpolate between them right now there is none

194
00:07:51,820 --> 00:07:54,580
no interpolation we're going to have to be either

195
00:07:54,580 --> 00:07:57,880
I think it's in way paint mode or in edit mode works as well

196
00:07:57,920 --> 00:07:59,950
But if we not way paint

197
00:08:00,020 --> 00:08:01,250
if I say we paint

198
00:08:01,510 --> 00:08:03,830
I think is in the draw mode

199
00:08:03,860 --> 00:08:05,080
sorryin Dr mode

200
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:06,320
So in draw mode

201
00:08:06,330 --> 00:08:08,840
when we go here to draw animation

202
00:08:08,840 --> 00:08:11,120
you see that here we have different types of animation

203
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:13,250
but also we have interpolated sequence

204
00:08:13,720 --> 00:08:16,030
So we need to be in between the two keyframes

205
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:17,540
It's a bit confusing

206
00:08:17,540 --> 00:08:19,050
You need to be between the two curve frames

207
00:08:19,050 --> 00:08:21,130
We go to draw interpolate sequence

208
00:08:21,140 --> 00:08:22,900
and now we have here a menu

209
00:08:22,910 --> 00:08:25,570
and you see automatically generated all these keyframes

210
00:08:25,730 --> 00:08:26,500
If you move

211
00:08:26,510 --> 00:08:27,820
you're not going to be able to modify

212
00:08:27,870 --> 00:08:28,750
but if you go here

213
00:08:28,760 --> 00:08:29,580
you can say step

214
00:08:29,590 --> 00:08:33,090
So you can say only add keyframes every two or 3 keyframes

215
00:08:33,550 --> 00:08:35,120
And now you can do different modes

216
00:08:35,140 --> 00:08:37,320
So you can have linear

217
00:08:37,450 --> 00:08:38,470
you can have cube

218
00:08:38,480 --> 00:08:39,600
Quantic can take

219
00:08:39,610 --> 00:08:40,180
by the way

220
00:08:40,190 --> 00:08:41,500
if you're finding this confusing

221
00:08:41,510 --> 00:08:43,350
if you just put your mouse and keep it there

222
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:45,856
it tells you this is weakest transition

223
00:08:45,856 --> 00:08:46,722
almost linear

224
00:08:46,722 --> 00:08:48,455
but with a slight curvature

225
00:08:48,455 --> 00:08:49,754
If you go to quintet

226
00:08:49,754 --> 00:08:51,054
it says quinty kissing

227
00:08:51,054 --> 00:08:52,786
That one is not expressing much

228
00:08:52,786 --> 00:08:53,220
much more

229
00:08:53,370 --> 00:08:54,000
For example

230
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:54,530
in back

231
00:08:54,540 --> 00:09:00,600
it tells you touby kissing with overshoot and settle bounce is telling you exponentially the came parable bounce

232
00:09:00,620 --> 00:09:02,280
like when objects collide

233
00:09:02,290 --> 00:09:04,440
so it's telling that use this one if you have

234
00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:04,860
for example

235
00:09:04,860 --> 00:09:05,810
a ball bouncing

236
00:09:05,810 --> 00:09:09,550
sure and you can see the little line on the side gives you quite an indication to yes

237
00:09:09,560 --> 00:09:11,780
and when I selected it modifies it there

238
00:09:11,790 --> 00:09:16,020
And now there is a transition between the two lines created by the program

239
00:09:16,400 --> 00:09:17,780
This is not like an after effect

240
00:09:17,780 --> 00:09:20,410
you can modify it live

241
00:09:20,420 --> 00:09:21,870
you know if it's done it done

242
00:09:21,880 --> 00:09:22,980
if you want to do it again

243
00:09:22,980 --> 00:09:27,000
you just delete those keyframes that are blue because those are in between keyframes

244
00:09:27,290 --> 00:09:28,210
And now we do it again

245
00:09:28,210 --> 00:09:30,490
And we do interplay sequence

246
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:30,930
And we

247
00:09:30,940 --> 00:09:31,350
for example

248
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:32,160
put more steps

249
00:09:32,470 --> 00:09:33,260
So I can put

250
00:09:33,280 --> 00:09:33,740
ohsorry

251
00:09:33,750 --> 00:09:34,390
less steps

252
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:35,440
So we put one

253
00:09:35,450 --> 00:09:38,760
and now it's much more smooth because it goes from one shape to a number

254
00:09:39,640 --> 00:09:41,210
Okaythat's really nice

255
00:09:41,330 --> 00:09:41,890
perfect

256
00:09:41,900 --> 00:09:47,600
So with that in mind I'm gonna delete this one and I'm going to go and I'm going to activate the first of my plants

257
00:09:47,850 --> 00:09:49,520
Let's one for example

258
00:09:49,520 --> 00:09:50,090
this one

259
00:09:50,390 --> 00:09:53,380
And what I'm going to do is I'm going to make sure selecting the plant

260
00:09:53,430 --> 00:10:01,530
I have a keyframe there and this animation is going to loop only on is going to reach frame 20 and then in frame 4 is going to go back again

261
00:10:01,530 --> 00:10:04,560
And I know that our entire sequence is 100 frame

262
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:06,730
So I'm going to show you how to look that forever and ever

263
00:10:07,050 --> 00:10:09,730
So I'm going to go to my frame 1

264
00:10:09,740 --> 00:10:14,580
I'm going to copy Ctrl C and paste in frame 20 my animation

265
00:10:15,790 --> 00:10:19,300
So now that we have there I'm gonna do it again

266
00:10:19,870 --> 00:10:22,210
Ctrl C and in frame 40 is going to be the animation

267
00:10:22,310 --> 00:10:24,820
Right now we have the animation three times the same

268
00:10:24,940 --> 00:10:28,960
but now we're going to go into the one in the middle and we're going to see how we're going to modify

269
00:10:28,960 --> 00:10:32,930
So I'm going to go to my sculpt mode and for doing that gender rotation

270
00:10:32,930 --> 00:10:34,540
you see that we have this twist there

271
00:10:34,580 --> 00:10:35,970
And I'm going to make it a bit big

272
00:10:36,050 --> 00:10:37,610
and I'm going to start doing that

273
00:10:38,260 --> 00:10:40,320
So I'm rotating my shape

274
00:10:40,390 --> 00:10:42,690
and now I'm going to grab it with a big one

275
00:10:43,020 --> 00:10:44,450
I'm going to start grabbing it

276
00:10:44,520 --> 00:10:48,220
so I'm going to rotate it and grab it

277
00:10:48,710 --> 00:10:49,840
okayjust like you were doing

278
00:10:49,840 --> 00:10:51,490
practicing with the line before

279
00:10:51,500 --> 00:10:52,620
but you can do now with your plant

280
00:10:53,070 --> 00:10:54,930
And we have a problem here

281
00:10:54,940 --> 00:10:59,020
It looks like I'm going to now make the act deactivate that

282
00:10:59,580 --> 00:11:03,460
It looks like we have a problem and is that we didn't copy the two layers

283
00:11:03,460 --> 00:11:04,730
we only copied one of them

284
00:11:04,760 --> 00:11:08,830
You see that that is because we have the layer Co one MDP layer

285
00:11:08,840 --> 00:11:11,040
that's my fault for not naming the layers

286
00:11:11,110 --> 00:11:13,360
So I'm going to delete those layers

287
00:11:13,410 --> 00:11:17,520
It's good for people to see the mistakes that come and I need to make sure that I select both layers

288
00:11:17,520 --> 00:11:19,480
both the stroke and the main layer

289
00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:24,500
So I'm going to I'm going to have to go back because I made many mistakes

290
00:11:24,910 --> 00:11:25,550
okay

291
00:11:25,630 --> 00:11:27,050
I'm going to delete all of that

292
00:11:27,060 --> 00:11:27,880
delete the keyframes

293
00:11:27,880 --> 00:11:31,760
We're gon na go to the first layer and copy both of them to frame 20

294
00:11:31,990 --> 00:11:33,920
I think I need to copy them 1 by one

295
00:11:33,970 --> 00:11:36,260
Let me see Ctrl CC plus V

296
00:11:36,260 --> 00:11:36,550
ctrl C

297
00:11:36,550 --> 00:11:37,350
ctrl V

298
00:11:37,630 --> 00:11:38,530
and now I'm gon na

299
00:11:38,530 --> 00:11:39,750
do control B

300
00:11:39,750 --> 00:11:41,560
ctrl C Ctrl and ctrl C Ctrl

301
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,100
and now it's to Na be in the region in the middle

302
00:11:44,110 --> 00:11:44,630
And now

303
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:49,630
yesI need to make sure that when I do this rotation I'm affecting both layers at the same time

304
00:11:49,880 --> 00:11:53,290
It's looking much better and now I'm going to be pinching them

305
00:11:53,300 --> 00:11:54,430
I'm moving them there

306
00:11:54,550 --> 00:11:55,060
you know

307
00:11:55,070 --> 00:11:56,420
now I'm going quite fast

308
00:11:56,430 --> 00:11:58,670
but when I did it in the original animation

309
00:11:58,680 --> 00:11:59,750
I took my time

310
00:12:00,010 --> 00:12:04,670
taking your time means that you can make it quite gentle and with a lot of love

311
00:12:04,680 --> 00:12:06,490
but I want to go a bit faster there

312
00:12:06,530 --> 00:12:15,870
And now what I'm going to do is here I'm going to be in draw mode and I'm going to go to draw interpolate sequence and I'm gon na do steps of three

313
00:12:15,880 --> 00:12:17,210
so it doesn't go that many

314
00:12:17,210 --> 00:12:19,920
and for now I like the sinusoidal 1

315
00:12:20,030 --> 00:12:21,490
It's just going to go there

316
00:12:22,370 --> 00:12:27,990
and I'm going to do draw interplace sequence and the singles soid all is happening again

317
00:12:28,690 --> 00:12:30,900
The only thing that we need is the other shape

318
00:12:30,920 --> 00:12:32,160
we're going to select layer 1

319
00:12:32,260 --> 00:12:38,610
because it's the stroke draw interplay sequence and draw interpolate sequence

320
00:12:38,650 --> 00:12:44,930
So now both the stroke and the main part are just having that animation

321
00:12:45,230 --> 00:12:47,480
So now someone might be wondering

322
00:12:47,480 --> 00:12:50,650
how do I do this so it repeats again and again forever

323
00:12:51,020 --> 00:12:51,990
So in order to do that

324
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,790
we're going to add a modifier to this plant

325
00:12:54,280 --> 00:12:57,870
And I'm going to go here to the time offset modifier

326
00:12:57,880 --> 00:13:00,740
And the time offset modifier is really simple

327
00:13:00,750 --> 00:13:04,400
The only thing we are doing is telling the program how many frames of set

328
00:13:04,400 --> 00:13:08,070
That means like where do we start the animation with my offset

329
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:09,310
But here in the custom range

330
00:13:09,310 --> 00:13:11,160
I can say I can

331
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:16,560
I'm going to repeat my animation from frame 0 to frame 40

332
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:19,580
So from frame one actually to frame 40

333
00:13:20,070 --> 00:13:22,910
and I want to put it is in the mode it is going to be

334
00:13:22,910 --> 00:13:23,780
has a different ones

335
00:13:23,780 --> 00:13:26,150
I think regular is the one that repeats forever

336
00:13:26,550 --> 00:13:26,920
We could do

337
00:13:27,130 --> 00:13:27,550
for example

338
00:13:27,550 --> 00:13:28,030
ping pong

339
00:13:28,030 --> 00:13:30,520
And what it does is that when it reaches one

340
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:32,890
it goes the other way or reverse

341
00:13:32,900 --> 00:13:35,790
It kind of applies to in reverse animation direction

342
00:13:35,830 --> 00:13:38,530
but the regular one just repeats our animation forever

343
00:13:38,530 --> 00:13:40,020
So now when I have that there

344
00:13:40,570 --> 00:13:43,190
my plant is just animating all the time

345
00:13:43,560 --> 00:13:43,730
okay

346
00:13:43,730 --> 00:13:45,290
So it doesn't add any new keyframes

347
00:13:45,290 --> 00:13:47,910
it just it just knows and repeats forever

348
00:13:47,930 --> 00:13:49,890
I can make my animation even longer now

349
00:13:49,900 --> 00:13:50,830
800 frames

350
00:13:50,840 --> 00:13:52,310
and it's just continue forever

351
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:55,090
And you're adding the modifier to the Creese pedestal

352
00:13:55,580 --> 00:13:57,240
I'm adding the modifier to the grease pencil

353
00:13:57,290 --> 00:14:00,498
that means that I can have different loop speeds in different moment

354
00:14:00,498 --> 00:14:01,495
And by the way

355
00:14:01,495 --> 00:14:03,987
if you are finding that this animation

356
00:14:03,987 --> 00:14:07,226
it might be that right-hind is going a bit too fast

357
00:14:07,226 --> 00:14:07,974
Too too fast

358
00:14:07,974 --> 00:14:13,470
Yeahso we could modify the keyframes by selecting them all and just putting them

359
00:14:13,500 --> 00:14:14,550
I think it's possible

360
00:14:14,550 --> 00:14:14,980
by the way

361
00:14:14,990 --> 00:14:16,940
just to get the keyframes and scaling them

362
00:14:16,940 --> 00:14:17,450
you see

363
00:14:17,460 --> 00:14:20,580
So if we start from 0 and now we do scaling

364
00:14:20,590 --> 00:14:22,830
I think it's scale into animation

365
00:14:22,830 --> 00:14:25,430
The only problem we do that now is my animation is 70 frames

366
00:14:25,780 --> 00:14:32,420
So remember to do that on your time of so now we're having a way slow animation that's easier

367
00:14:32,530 --> 00:14:33,440
And how did you do the scaling

368
00:14:33,940 --> 00:14:36,450
Just pressing S as simple as that

369
00:14:39,490 --> 00:14:43,940
So what I'm going to do now is I'm going to go plant by plant

370
00:14:43,950 --> 00:14:46,880
and I'm going to be animating them all

371
00:14:46,890 --> 00:14:48,070
And so I'll see you in a second
