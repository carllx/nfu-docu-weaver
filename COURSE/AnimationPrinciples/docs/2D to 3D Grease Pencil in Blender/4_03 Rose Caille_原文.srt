1
00:00:04,060 --> 00:00:08,140
So welcome to this illustration from Rose Kaya

2
00:00:08,940 --> 00:00:10,140
And I love this one

3
00:00:10,150 --> 00:00:11,780
I love as well that in this one

4
00:00:11,780 --> 00:00:13,990
as well as having the illustration

5
00:00:13,990 --> 00:00:15,280
we have a beautiful animation

6
00:00:15,700 --> 00:00:19,020
YeahI love seeing the 3D animation mixed with the 2D animation

7
00:00:19,020 --> 00:00:22,590
I think that's something people were really interested in and seeing that frame by frame

8
00:00:22,590 --> 00:00:26,440
puffs of smoke along with this really smooth 3D is really lovely

9
00:00:26,590 --> 00:00:27,030
Yeah

10
00:00:27,040 --> 00:00:28,150
and you know

11
00:00:28,150 --> 00:00:31,400
like when we received this illustration that we have in here

12
00:00:31,590 --> 00:00:33,850
we had to decide what were we going to do

13
00:00:34,110 --> 00:00:36,660
Like we didn't know which parts were going to be 3D

14
00:00:36,660 --> 00:00:38,220
which parts were going to be 2D

15
00:00:38,580 --> 00:00:41,120
and maybe even which parts were not present

16
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:45,840
I think that I really love how this illustration was very flat

17
00:00:45,950 --> 00:00:47,790
but it had a bit of texture

18
00:00:47,790 --> 00:00:50,420
a bit of gradients made here with this noise

19
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:53,650
And I thought it was a shame if we were going to lose that in 3D

20
00:00:54,040 --> 00:00:55,090
On the other hand

21
00:00:55,120 --> 00:00:57,290
I thought that many of the shapes

22
00:00:57,290 --> 00:01:04,120
including the wheels and the motorbike and how this felt ter would be a shame not to show that we had made it in 3D

23
00:01:04,130 --> 00:01:07,160
So it was a different approach is very different from Noi

24
00:01:07,160 --> 00:01:11,860
which we made an illustration that looked exactly like the original in this one

25
00:01:11,870 --> 00:01:13,390
We did a reinterpretation

26
00:01:13,560 --> 00:01:15,950
something that I really love about this illustration as well

27
00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:18,020
There's all of the details that are inside of it

28
00:01:18,390 --> 00:01:20,610
seeing how she has on the motorbike

29
00:01:20,620 --> 00:01:23,070
that little flower sticker and the cross there

30
00:01:23,070 --> 00:01:25,570
And I think the colors are really nicely contained

31
00:01:25,590 --> 00:01:29,520
but it's full of detail and I think that's what looks super nice when you get into 3D

32
00:01:29,540 --> 00:01:29,940
Yeah

33
00:01:29,940 --> 00:01:30,650
when we go here

34
00:01:30,660 --> 00:01:31,850
back to the illustration

35
00:01:32,090 --> 00:01:33,820
see that everything got translated

36
00:01:33,820 --> 00:01:36,040
Actuallyevery single element ended up being there

37
00:01:36,080 --> 00:01:36,340
You know

38
00:01:36,340 --> 00:01:37,640
the flowers are there

39
00:01:37,990 --> 00:01:39,260
the bird is there

40
00:01:39,770 --> 00:01:42,750
and even the elements that were in the illustration

41
00:01:42,750 --> 00:01:45,340
like the little details are just appearing on this

42
00:01:45,690 --> 00:01:48,380
And to generate the effect of the speed happening

43
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:55,260
And those are simply some grease pencil layers that are being multiplied again and again

44
00:01:55,270 --> 00:01:57,190
and we are using the same effect

45
00:01:57,190 --> 00:01:59,950
The time of to change at which time they appear

46
00:02:00,070 --> 00:02:01,770
So we only animated 1

47
00:02:01,780 --> 00:02:03,480
and then we repeat it again and again

48
00:02:03,560 --> 00:02:06,160
And we are generating that speed in the illustration

49
00:02:06,160 --> 00:02:07,920
just like you did with the little Zs

50
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:10,040
in exactly the same effect

51
00:02:10,220 --> 00:02:11,500
The other thing that we have

52
00:02:11,500 --> 00:02:12,353
ohby the way

53
00:02:12,353 --> 00:02:15,126
I love that you can put in misshaped materials

54
00:02:15,126 --> 00:02:16,406
And if you are using Eev

55
00:02:16,406 --> 00:02:19,180
the only thing you need to go is I actually right now

56
00:02:19,180 --> 00:02:21,100
Now we activate it in cycles up

57
00:02:21,100 --> 00:02:23,020
but like we can use Eev all the time

58
00:02:23,610 --> 00:02:25,290
I did a cycle test

59
00:02:25,290 --> 00:02:27,950
but like when we go in evol see here you have bloom

60
00:02:28,020 --> 00:02:29,190
So when I have bloom

61
00:02:29,190 --> 00:02:31,790
what I can do is if I have an emission material

62
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:35,510
I can make it to look as if it's just glowing my entire scene

63
00:02:35,630 --> 00:02:37,580
You can only do this in evol

64
00:02:37,890 --> 00:02:38,930
can not do it in cycles

65
00:02:38,930 --> 00:02:39,430
In cycles

66
00:02:39,430 --> 00:02:41,110
you need to do it with post processing

67
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:44,840
But I love that you can do this effect in evol

68
00:02:45,820 --> 00:02:47,050
and it works so well

69
00:02:47,090 --> 00:02:49,930
and it's generating this super cool look for illustrations

70
00:02:49,930 --> 00:02:53,210
If the lights are just emanating so much

71
00:02:53,910 --> 00:02:57,580
The other details I want to talk about is how the hair was created

72
00:02:57,590 --> 00:03:00,960
The hair was created simply using metal metabolism

73
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:02,250
if you've never used them before

74
00:03:02,250 --> 00:03:03,320
are super useful

75
00:03:03,610 --> 00:03:05,270
I'm going to just save this illustration

76
00:03:05,270 --> 00:03:07,040
make a new project for a second

77
00:03:07,170 --> 00:03:11,500
and I'm going to delete my cube and my metabolism basically work like this

78
00:03:11,510 --> 00:03:12,890
I'm going to add a metabolite

79
00:03:12,890 --> 00:03:14,160
add a ball

80
00:03:14,210 --> 00:03:18,790
and you can just create copies or either you create a copy Ctrl C

81
00:03:18,790 --> 00:03:19,930
Ctrl V of the metabolism

82
00:03:19,960 --> 00:03:21,110
then you move here

83
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:23,650
or you can as well if you are in edit mode

84
00:03:23,660 --> 00:03:25,310
if you select the object

85
00:03:25,320 --> 00:03:28,690
you can do Shift D and just start creating copies of it

86
00:03:28,890 --> 00:03:29,450
But you see

87
00:03:29,450 --> 00:03:36,190
as I'm creating copies I'm generating this soft transition between my shapes and then inside the metabolite here

88
00:03:36,200 --> 00:03:41,380
you can change how much the resolution happens on the viewer and on the render

89
00:03:41,380 --> 00:03:47,540
So you could have less resolution on the viewer if your computers have been a slower and have a smaller distance on the render

90
00:03:47,540 --> 00:03:47,830
So it's

91
00:03:48,030 --> 00:03:48,200
I mean

92
00:03:48,240 --> 00:03:50,310
the smoother when you are done with the project

93
00:03:50,700 --> 00:03:53,540
But you can see the shorter I make my resolution

94
00:03:53,670 --> 00:03:55,750
the smoother and smoother the stuff looking

95
00:03:55,760 --> 00:03:58,340
So now that we understand how the hair was created

96
00:03:58,390 --> 00:04:01,250
we're going to be seeing how the hair was animated

97
00:04:01,260 --> 00:04:02,080
not only the hair

98
00:04:02,210 --> 00:04:04,370
but many of the elements you see that we are having here

99
00:04:04,380 --> 00:04:07,360
Even I love the effect that is happening on the little bird

100
00:04:07,380 --> 00:04:11,240
I love looking at it from close up because you can see the movement from the wind

101
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:13,980
And some people might think that that's very complex to animate

102
00:04:14,100 --> 00:04:15,170
but that's so simple

103
00:04:15,170 --> 00:04:17,630
The only thing we are applying there and I can select my bird

104
00:04:17,830 --> 00:04:20,600
I can have it here

105
00:04:20,650 --> 00:04:25,190
And the only thing I'm doing with my bird is I'm going to add a wave effect

106
00:04:25,310 --> 00:04:28,200
And you can see here exactly the settings I can show them here

107
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:29,300
I just play it with them

108
00:04:29,330 --> 00:04:29,850
You know

109
00:04:29,860 --> 00:04:30,700
you have a speed

110
00:04:30,700 --> 00:04:32,810
you can make it animate is lower

111
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:35,360
This effect as well is cycling

112
00:04:35,390 --> 00:04:37,050
that means like cycling or cycling

113
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:38,530
I don't cycling

114
00:04:38,540 --> 00:04:41,030
so it's repeating all the time and again and again

115
00:04:41,160 --> 00:04:42,240
And we can do different weight

116
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:44,650
So I could do something very saturated with here

117
00:04:44,650 --> 00:04:46,340
I'm starting to show and break the effect

118
00:04:46,490 --> 00:04:52,350
or I can make it quite soft and you can see that this effect obviously works better when I have more subdivisions

119
00:04:52,360 --> 00:04:56,260
but I was trying to do not that many subdivisions for to be able to play well

120
00:04:56,260 --> 00:04:59,420
But then you can do more subdivisions for the render when we finish the illustration

121
00:04:59,420 --> 00:05:00,970
when we go to render it out

122
00:05:00,980 --> 00:05:02,350
you can have more subdivisions

123
00:05:02,500 --> 00:05:04,060
But in reality at this distance

124
00:05:04,070 --> 00:05:05,800
I thought that there was no need for more

125
00:05:05,810 --> 00:05:07,370
You're getting that wind effect

126
00:05:07,510 --> 00:05:10,060
and then I went through every single element

127
00:05:10,060 --> 00:05:11,330
including these arms

128
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:12,850
and I just did the same

129
00:05:12,860 --> 00:05:18,750
I applied the wave and it is generating this effect looking like the clothes are flowing with the wind

130
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:19,790
That's really lovely

131
00:05:19,790 --> 00:05:21,380
How did you know about the wave effect

132
00:05:21,380 --> 00:05:22,980
How did you think to use that one specifically

133
00:05:23,090 --> 00:05:25,300
OhI was just starting playing with them

134
00:05:25,310 --> 00:05:26,960
I was just going around being like

135
00:05:26,970 --> 00:05:32,690
what can I use to not to have to animate frame by frame something and it to look good

136
00:05:33,210 --> 00:05:34,560
And I found that wave effector

137
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:36,170
like there are so many effectors

138
00:05:36,170 --> 00:05:38,940
and sometimes I Google things when I don't know

139
00:05:38,940 --> 00:05:40,590
like I haven't used some of them

140
00:05:40,760 --> 00:05:42,370
but I think that if they are

141
00:05:42,370 --> 00:05:44,310
there is because at some point they will become useful

142
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:46,290
So I don't think you should learn them all

143
00:05:46,300 --> 00:05:48,610
I think you can incorporate them as you go

144
00:05:48,730 --> 00:05:49,980
Yeahthat makes sense

145
00:05:49,990 --> 00:05:56,180
It's really lovely as well to see because I feel like it looks exactly like I would imagine the 3D result would look

146
00:05:56,190 --> 00:05:58,680
but so much more seemed to be trial and error

147
00:05:58,700 --> 00:05:59,260
Yeah

148
00:05:59,760 --> 00:06:03,580
and the other thing that we have in here is these papers

149
00:06:03,590 --> 00:06:05,680
And these papers are also using the wave effector

150
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:07,260
You can see that they are bending in the air

151
00:06:07,570 --> 00:06:13,200
but they have something else as well as the wave effector that you can see that there are all these lines that are following paths

152
00:06:13,650 --> 00:06:18,380
And this follow path is super easy to make and is very useful

153
00:06:18,390 --> 00:06:18,820
For example

154
00:06:18,910 --> 00:06:21,060
we're making a car that is going around the circuit

155
00:06:21,560 --> 00:06:22,650
Or if we are making

156
00:06:22,650 --> 00:06:23,380
in this case

157
00:06:23,560 --> 00:06:25,980
some papers that are flying from the motorbike

158
00:06:26,030 --> 00:06:27,470
So in order to have them

159
00:06:27,480 --> 00:06:34,530
you can see that each of these papers are having in here in the object constraint

160
00:06:34,540 --> 00:06:35,810
I have a follow path

161
00:06:35,820 --> 00:06:36,810
You see that there

162
00:06:36,830 --> 00:06:39,010
and then I have an offset on the follow path

163
00:06:39,020 --> 00:06:42,690
so I'm gon na do it in a new project so people know what I was doing

164
00:06:42,850 --> 00:06:45,920
So I'm going to make I'm going to make

165
00:06:45,930 --> 00:06:49,750
instead of a cube I'm going to make a plan so people can see already how this was made

166
00:06:50,360 --> 00:06:56,870
And I'm going to go to my edit mode and remember the wave effector doesn't work if there are no subdivisions

167
00:06:56,910 --> 00:07:04,570
So you need to do click and do a few subdivisions and then click and do a few subdivisions

168
00:07:04,580 --> 00:07:05,200
If not

169
00:07:05,210 --> 00:07:06,250
is not going to show

170
00:07:06,300 --> 00:07:11,560
Now I'm going to go into my modifiers and I'm going to add a wave modifier

171
00:07:12,590 --> 00:07:13,610
And now hopefully

172
00:07:14,100 --> 00:07:15,010
if everything goes well

173
00:07:15,010 --> 00:07:16,370
when I go to object mode

174
00:07:16,450 --> 00:07:18,170
we already have that effect

175
00:07:18,230 --> 00:07:18,750
you know

176
00:07:20,220 --> 00:07:21,300
And the wave modifier

177
00:07:21,390 --> 00:07:23,130
you can see that now is applying from the middle

178
00:07:23,130 --> 00:07:24,780
You can only do one of the sides

179
00:07:24,790 --> 00:07:25,580
So if now you do

180
00:07:25,580 --> 00:07:27,540
one of the sides is applying like a flat

181
00:07:28,020 --> 00:07:28,670
Okay

182
00:07:28,680 --> 00:07:30,790
so I have my plane flying already

183
00:07:31,380 --> 00:07:33,170
what is the next thing I need to do

184
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:36,650
The next thing I need to do is my plan to be following some path

185
00:07:37,300 --> 00:07:41,960
So I'm going to add a curve and I'm going to add a the Seer curve

186
00:07:42,300 --> 00:07:44,040
and I'm going to tap

187
00:07:44,750 --> 00:07:46,320
press top and scale it

188
00:07:46,330 --> 00:07:47,000
I'm going to scale it

189
00:07:47,240 --> 00:07:51,400
and maybe I'm going to rotate it because I think it makes more sense to look a bit more

190
00:07:51,400 --> 00:07:52,460
Like with Ctrl

191
00:07:52,460 --> 00:07:55,060
I can do increments of 5 and I'm gon na have

192
00:07:55,070 --> 00:07:59,330
Imagine that this is the beginning of my motorbike tour is going to be there

193
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:03,000
and then my paper is gonna go and fly up and then go down

194
00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:04,040
I could

195
00:08:04,090 --> 00:08:04,340
you know

196
00:08:04,350 --> 00:08:05,350
change the shape

197
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:06,420
Just pressing E

198
00:08:06,430 --> 00:08:13,120
I can make more points and I can move them as well in the 3D space so I can make some of the papers to go backwards and some to go front

199
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:15,910
And now the only thing I need to do is go to my plane

200
00:08:16,420 --> 00:08:17,920
go to my constraints

201
00:08:18,430 --> 00:08:20,690
and then I can do a follow path

202
00:08:20,690 --> 00:08:22,100
Where I do follow path

203
00:08:22,110 --> 00:08:23,140
here you are

204
00:08:23,150 --> 00:08:24,750
and now I need to save the target

205
00:08:24,750 --> 00:08:27,410
The target is of the Sr curve that I have in there

206
00:08:27,750 --> 00:08:29,930
And now I did

207
00:08:29,940 --> 00:08:32,460
I did the follow path on my the year curve

208
00:08:32,470 --> 00:08:33,980
You see the accident I did

209
00:08:34,020 --> 00:08:36,930
you can see that the effect applied in the busier curve

210
00:08:36,940 --> 00:08:39,260
but in reality I should do it in my plane

211
00:08:39,270 --> 00:08:41,420
not in the busier curve because the plane

212
00:08:41,650 --> 00:08:43,060
what is gonna follow the path

213
00:08:43,070 --> 00:08:45,010
So now I'm gonna do the same again

214
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:47,130
The plane should be the one having this gear

215
00:08:47,130 --> 00:08:48,610
It looks like the gears from a bicycle

216
00:08:48,620 --> 00:08:50,770
And now I'm going to select my VR curve

217
00:08:50,810 --> 00:08:54,820
So now I know that my paper is following my VCR curve

218
00:08:54,830 --> 00:08:55,340
If I do

219
00:08:55,340 --> 00:08:59,030
offset is going to go from one place to another

220
00:08:59,180 --> 00:09:01,620
fantasticand then I have a few different things

221
00:09:01,620 --> 00:09:01,920
you know

222
00:09:01,930 --> 00:09:03,510
I can do follow curve

223
00:09:03,520 --> 00:09:07,150
That means that now the paper is pointing towards the curve

224
00:09:07,150 --> 00:09:08,430
So it curves with the curve

225
00:09:09,140 --> 00:09:10,040
That's looking much better

226
00:09:10,810 --> 00:09:14,240
So if you have it moving a bit up and down like that

227
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:16,330
your paper is going to do the exactly

228
00:09:16,330 --> 00:09:18,100
So I don't need to be rotating myself

229
00:09:18,110 --> 00:09:18,830
the paper

230
00:09:18,830 --> 00:09:20,590
the paper now is working well

231
00:09:20,740 --> 00:09:27,080
And then the next thing I can do is add a keyframe at the beginning in my offset and a keyframe

232
00:09:27,100 --> 00:09:28,950
I'm only going to do this 20 frames

233
00:09:29,100 --> 00:09:31,620
So I can add another keyframe at the end

234
00:09:32,230 --> 00:09:33,050
There we are

235
00:09:34,040 --> 00:09:35,060
put another keyframe

236
00:09:35,710 --> 00:09:39,650
And now when I play I'm getting it by effect

237
00:09:41,830 --> 00:09:44,460
Fantasticand you just have that several times to have lots of papers from

238
00:09:44,470 --> 00:09:46,040
I have several times what I did

239
00:09:46,140 --> 00:09:46,930
by the way

240
00:09:46,940 --> 00:09:49,400
because I know that at the beginning I wanted them to appeare from the

241
00:09:49,540 --> 00:09:50,530
from the box

242
00:09:51,080 --> 00:09:52,970
from the little folder

243
00:09:53,110 --> 00:09:55,220
and I didn't want to have any problems like

244
00:09:55,230 --> 00:09:56,060
I don't know

245
00:09:56,210 --> 00:09:59,200
having to come out from the folder and it's not visible

246
00:09:59,250 --> 00:10:01,450
So the only thing I do is that they scale them up

247
00:10:01,460 --> 00:10:02,220
You see at the beginning

248
00:10:02,220 --> 00:10:05,420
they are really tiny and then they scale them up very quickly

249
00:10:05,430 --> 00:10:07,030
and then they continue through the scene

250
00:10:07,070 --> 00:10:11,180
Sometimes those simple solutions are enough because your brain covers the rest

251
00:10:11,180 --> 00:10:13,810
you see how you just imagine that probably they are appearing

252
00:10:13,820 --> 00:10:14,470
but in reality

253
00:10:14,470 --> 00:10:15,640
it's just a simple scale

254
00:10:15,650 --> 00:10:16,550
You completely do

255
00:10:16,550 --> 00:10:17,250
And at the end

256
00:10:17,250 --> 00:10:20,230
how is it that they disappeared exactly the same

257
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:21,490
When they reach the end

258
00:10:21,500 --> 00:10:23,670
You can see here in each of my planes

259
00:10:24,310 --> 00:10:28,540
I get to the end and I scale them down completely

260
00:10:28,550 --> 00:10:30,090
and not only I scale them down

261
00:10:30,090 --> 00:10:32,340
I think actually what I do as well

262
00:10:32,340 --> 00:10:33,910
as well as scaling them down

263
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:37,250
you can change the disability of the paper

264
00:10:37,380 --> 00:10:38,270

265
00:10:38,270 --> 00:10:39,730
I don't know exactly what it is

266
00:10:39,740 --> 00:10:41,000
I'm gon na try to show here

267
00:10:41,010 --> 00:10:43,440
You see here I do a scale down

268
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:44,830
so I have a few keyframes here

269
00:10:44,830 --> 00:10:47,160
97I started scaling them

270
00:10:47,210 --> 00:10:48,460
but the other thing I do

271
00:10:48,470 --> 00:10:50,000
and I don't know why it's disappearing

272
00:10:50,010 --> 00:10:52,980
Ohit disappears because then invisibility

273
00:10:52,990 --> 00:10:54,690
I have a keyframe saying

274
00:10:55,890 --> 00:10:57,050
showing viewport

275
00:10:57,060 --> 00:10:57,900
showing render

276
00:10:58,270 --> 00:10:59,220
and then in 100

277
00:10:59,690 --> 00:11:03,330
I made that only two keyframes that doesn't show in viewport or renders

278
00:11:03,330 --> 00:11:06,250
and there is a bit of a CLT in this program because now when I get here

279
00:11:06,260 --> 00:11:09,770
all the keyframes disappear because the program is like I'm not seeing anything

280
00:11:10,390 --> 00:11:12,180
And that's why it's kind of a bit confusing

281
00:11:12,180 --> 00:11:13,700
And now I need to select it again

282
00:11:13,820 --> 00:11:17,320
but it's simply that I told the program to make the optic disappear

283
00:11:17,490 --> 00:11:18,450
That's a clever trick

284
00:11:18,980 --> 00:11:22,590
okaynow that we have that I can tell you that the rest was done

285
00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:25,050
the arms were made with the same cube technique

286
00:11:25,100 --> 00:11:28,660
starting from spline that we've done in our course on how to brake

287
00:11:28,830 --> 00:11:30,020
how to model in Blender

288
00:11:30,020 --> 00:11:31,020
So if you've done that

289
00:11:31,030 --> 00:11:33,840
you have it and the motorbike started from a cube

290
00:11:33,900 --> 00:11:43,680
Wheels are simple toruses that are in there and the smoke was done with frame by frame animation in a grease pencil layer in which I use a fill in white

291
00:11:43,700 --> 00:11:44,020
Okay

292
00:11:44,030 --> 00:11:45,190
like we've just learned how to do

293
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:50,610
Yeahand the only little thing that we have that we haven't really covered much in this course

294
00:11:50,740 --> 00:11:55,210
we will have an entire course dedicated at some point on how to do painting

295
00:11:55,220 --> 00:12:00,800
on painting textures is that we paint all these textures in the program

296
00:12:01,080 --> 00:12:06,390
but so far I had to use a little We're going to put the link of the brushes we use

297
00:12:06,400 --> 00:12:07,480
we bought them

298
00:12:07,500 --> 00:12:08,440
it's only 5 dollars

299
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:11,600
we bought them from someone else that they sell them on

300
00:12:11,610 --> 00:12:13,980
I have don't know if it's gum road or another of this website

301
00:12:14,610 --> 00:12:17,630
but we want to generate at some point a library inside

302
00:12:17,630 --> 00:12:18,150
but at the school

303
00:12:18,150 --> 00:12:19,750
so people don't have to pay those 5 dollars

304
00:12:20,060 --> 00:12:21,250
But so far

305
00:12:21,260 --> 00:12:24,500
the only thing I did is using those brushes to generate these little dots

306
00:12:24,570 --> 00:12:26,980
So I'm going to link

307
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,110
I'm going to put a link to the brush we use from there

308
00:12:29,250 --> 00:12:30,910
but in order to do that

309
00:12:30,920 --> 00:12:32,860
like we've done in other courses

310
00:12:32,870 --> 00:12:38,550
we simply selected the geometry where you be unwrapped like we did in the beginning of this course

311
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:40,430
And then we painted on top with the texture

312
00:12:40,590 --> 00:12:42,460
So that was basically it

313
00:12:42,640 --> 00:12:45,860
The rest is just spending time and putting some love on it

314
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:46,830
Yeah

315
00:12:46,830 --> 00:12:57,190
it's really nice to see that all of the same techniques that we've been teaching in every course are applied to this illustration and even if every character looks so different they all come from the same cube

316
00:12:58,270 --> 00:13:01,330
I really hope that people do something that I love doing

317
00:13:01,340 --> 00:13:03,710
This is such a privilege to be able to access this file

318
00:13:03,710 --> 00:13:07,050
So I hope you go through the file and start exploring experimenting

319
00:13:07,370 --> 00:13:11,200
Sometimes even I find that sometimes people ask us questions they like

320
00:13:11,210 --> 00:13:13,100
ohwhy is this thing not being used

321
00:13:13,110 --> 00:13:15,790
And it's because on the way of making it

322
00:13:15,890 --> 00:13:18,280
we ended up just getting rid of something

323
00:13:18,370 --> 00:13:22,660
So I think it's good sometimes to see how the process of the creation of this was made

324
00:13:22,670 --> 00:13:24,260
because not everything is being used

325
00:13:24,430 --> 00:13:26,900
not everything that we tried work

326
00:13:27,340 --> 00:13:32,080
And I think that's the way you should do when you are making your illustrations and turning them into 3D

327
00:13:32,120 --> 00:13:33,820
A lot of experimenting

328
00:13:34,090 --> 00:13:37,920
Try to get all the knowledge you've been getting through all courses and applying it to your straight

329
00:13:38,020 --> 00:13:38,950
I think that's completely true

330
00:13:39,140 --> 00:13:41,980
And if you're trying to make something that looks new and unique

331
00:13:41,990 --> 00:13:44,700
then you probably have to do some experimentation yourself

332
00:13:44,710 --> 00:13:45,900
Yes100 percent

333
00:13:45,900 --> 00:13:47,930
and we can't wait to see all of your results

334
00:13:48,110 --> 00:13:49,070
please share them with us

335
00:13:49,080 --> 00:13:52,370
And big well done again to Rose Kai for her beautiful TD character

336
00:13:52,640 --> 00:13:54,090
And in the next lesson

337
00:13:54,090 --> 00:13:58,090
we're gonna take a completely different style of illustration that was done using Gris pencil

338
00:13:58,270 --> 00:13:59,280
but I think that was very

339
00:14:00,650 --> 00:14:06,750
a good example of how grease pencil is so flexible because the other illustration just doesn't look at all of these ones

340
00:14:07,420 --> 00:14:07,950
We'll see you then

341
00:14:07,980 --> 00:14:08,760
bye
