2
00:00:07,670 --> 00:00:10,280
And he had a very different style

3
00:00:10,290 --> 00:00:13,390
I'm going to show here the style that she had

4
00:00:13,610 --> 00:00:15,160
Her illustration was like this

5
00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:19,160
and I really loved how this illustration had so many little details

6
00:00:19,160 --> 00:00:21,210
like all these dots to generate shadows

7
00:00:21,860 --> 00:00:24,050
I love the colors of the illustration

8
00:00:24,050 --> 00:00:25,860
how graphical the character is

9
00:00:25,910 --> 00:00:26,490
but of course

10
00:00:26,490 --> 00:00:27,390
it was a big challenge

11
00:00:27,500 --> 00:00:27,720
You know

12
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:28,790
at the beginning we were thinking

13
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:32,380
are we going to translate like these outlines in the illustration

14
00:00:32,380 --> 00:00:33,170
And we tried

15
00:00:33,180 --> 00:00:35,630
we tried different things and this is the final result

16
00:00:35,940 --> 00:00:36,360
Yeah

17
00:00:36,360 --> 00:00:39,050
I really like the position as well this character is in

18
00:00:39,050 --> 00:00:41,910
It's kind of interesting translating that position into 3D

19
00:00:41,940 --> 00:00:42,200
I think

20
00:00:42,550 --> 00:00:48,550
because the proportions of the face is slightly different from how a realistic face would be

21
00:00:48,550 --> 00:00:48,700
You know

22
00:00:48,700 --> 00:00:51,700
the positioning of the mouth and the one cheek being slightly bigger than another

23
00:00:51,860 --> 00:00:54,940
And I think it's interesting to see that translation so directly

24
00:00:55,090 --> 00:00:55,610
Yeah

25
00:00:55,620 --> 00:00:56,310
to be honest

26
00:00:56,320 --> 00:00:59,330
this illustration works very well if you rotate it even here

27
00:00:59,330 --> 00:01:01,210
But if you start going this way

28
00:01:01,220 --> 00:01:02,060
starts breaking

29
00:01:02,060 --> 00:01:03,930
you see around this area

30
00:01:03,940 --> 00:01:05,630
just like it doesn't look good

31
00:01:06,110 --> 00:01:08,970
Like I think up to from here to here is looking quite good

32
00:01:08,980 --> 00:01:09,750
And I like that

33
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:13,040
I like that allows for some level of movement around

34
00:01:13,130 --> 00:01:15,590
but in the moment it what it breaks

35
00:01:15,590 --> 00:01:16,120
it just breaks

36
00:01:16,630 --> 00:01:17,100
Okay

37
00:01:17,120 --> 00:01:19,050
let's look at some of the things we did

38
00:01:19,060 --> 00:01:20,450
This animates a bit

39
00:01:20,460 --> 00:01:25,000
We have some animation here for the text that's appearing saying hello

40
00:01:25,170 --> 00:01:27,850
And also we have some animation happening in the cable

41
00:01:27,860 --> 00:01:30,140
And I love that we also have some animation happening

42
00:01:30,140 --> 00:01:33,940
some boiling happening on the on these hat that looks like a

43
00:01:35,450 --> 00:01:36,480
is this an apple

44
00:01:36,710 --> 00:01:39,640
I thought maybe as well could be a Toto

45
00:01:39,700 --> 00:01:40,170
I don't know

46
00:01:40,450 --> 00:01:41,820
it's some fruit

47
00:01:43,070 --> 00:01:48,460
But like we are having this illustration with a lot of boiling effects happening

48
00:01:48,950 --> 00:01:55,300
But the main thing how everything started with with modeling and the way to do it with modeling was just I went into a front view

49
00:01:55,300 --> 00:01:59,720
I started with a cube and I slowly started extruding using the techniques we use

50
00:02:00,740 --> 00:02:02,080
Everything started from my cube

51
00:02:02,090 --> 00:02:05,480
And then in the moment where I was comfortable with how it was looking

52
00:02:05,480 --> 00:02:06,610
but it was not perfect

53
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:09,750
I just applied all the subdivisions of the cube

54
00:02:10,020 --> 00:02:11,599
and then I went into sculpting

55
00:02:11,599 --> 00:02:13,574
And then when we arrived into sculpting

56
00:02:13,574 --> 00:02:14,166
I started

57
00:02:14,166 --> 00:02:17,326
I only used cree-english bit of this elastic deformation grab

58
00:02:17,326 --> 00:02:19,103
and then I used a lot of inflate

59
00:02:19,103 --> 00:02:20,880
So I started doing for the breast

60
00:02:20,880 --> 00:02:26,580
I started doing a bit of inflation and pinching it to just have all the modifications I wanted

61
00:02:26,620 --> 00:02:28,000
And then for this neck

62
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:28,530
for example

63
00:02:28,530 --> 00:02:35,510
I just started from a cylinder and I extruded some of the corners of the cylinder to generate this flower effect and the same for the head

64
00:02:35,510 --> 00:02:35,960
You know

65
00:02:35,970 --> 00:02:37,710
you see that this is exactly the same

66
00:02:37,710 --> 00:02:39,300
There's a bit of inflation here

67
00:02:39,310 --> 00:02:41,880
a bit of Cree inflation here

68
00:02:41,940 --> 00:02:43,400
The nose started from a cube

69
00:02:43,460 --> 00:02:45,970
I just want you to know that there were no tricks here

70
00:02:45,980 --> 00:02:49,790
This is only just going bit by bit sculpting all the elements

71
00:02:49,790 --> 00:02:53,200
I was about to say that it sounds not real

72
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:55,160
it sounds like there must be some kind of hidden trick somewhere

73
00:02:55,380 --> 00:02:56,910
but that's exactly how it was made

74
00:02:56,910 --> 00:02:59,950
And I think that can be quite a nice thing for people to realize as well

75
00:03:00,140 --> 00:03:06,020
The more that you practice and the more that you understand looking at 3D objects in the real world as well

76
00:03:06,030 --> 00:03:08,240
the better you can understand modeling

77
00:03:08,470 --> 00:03:10,170
And you're wondering

78
00:03:10,180 --> 00:03:14,460
how is grease pencil useful in this

79
00:03:14,460 --> 00:03:16,280
Project is useful in many ways

80
00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:17,020
One of them is that

81
00:03:17,350 --> 00:03:18,120
for example

82
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:19,990
you can have this boiling in this cable

83
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,360
This is was drawn in completely flat way

84
00:03:22,370 --> 00:03:24,630
And then because of how a grosbeak

85
00:03:25,620 --> 00:03:27,770
you can then go into sculpt mode

86
00:03:27,930 --> 00:03:29,230
do your grab mode

87
00:03:29,240 --> 00:03:33,290
and start kind of bending the cable and putting it behind the hand

88
00:03:33,290 --> 00:03:34,110
And I love that

89
00:03:34,110 --> 00:03:37,060
I love that grease pencil allows for these 3D

90
00:03:37,670 --> 00:03:40,030
it's last to the movement of the objects

91
00:03:40,660 --> 00:03:47,210
AlsoI love that you can have these shadows that are just little dots that I have sputter around here and they boil

92
00:03:47,370 --> 00:03:48,020
and that effect

93
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:51,280
I think is beautiful and a 3D illustration I've never seen before

94
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:51,620
to be honest

95
00:03:51,850 --> 00:03:53,340
I've never seen something like that

96
00:03:53,530 --> 00:03:54,200
Same here

97
00:03:54,370 --> 00:03:55,210
this you see

98
00:03:55,210 --> 00:03:57,330
you can have all of these effects that are applying

99
00:03:57,330 --> 00:03:58,510
they're just applying a noise

100
00:03:59,060 --> 00:04:02,680
but then I have have all the things if I go to my final render mode

101
00:04:03,220 --> 00:04:11,830
and I have I have it here and that should be look like that I'm gonna deactivate my scene like in a scene world because I just want to use the automatic lighting

102
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:14,030
I can apply

103
00:04:14,040 --> 00:04:20,140
Do you see that there is this double layer that it looks yellow and it looks red on the front and it goes with the animation

104
00:04:20,140 --> 00:04:27,740
it works completely fine that is coming from this original illustration and it's so easy to do so the only thing you need to do is

105
00:04:27,750 --> 00:04:29,780
and remember that in order to see those effects

106
00:04:29,780 --> 00:04:31,410
you need to be viewport shading mode

107
00:04:31,670 --> 00:04:33,580
But if I select it here

108
00:04:33,740 --> 00:04:35,840
one of the effects that I have is called shadow

109
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:37,500
but a shadow can be any color

110
00:04:37,620 --> 00:04:40,750
so it's just a creative way of using the shadow you made the black

111
00:04:40,760 --> 00:04:42,600
it's just a shadow that you have for the effect

112
00:04:42,850 --> 00:04:45,980
But if you make your shadow that low color

113
00:04:45,990 --> 00:04:49,870
subtlyyou're having the look that the original illustration had

114
00:04:50,150 --> 00:04:51,960
and I love that type of flexibility

115
00:04:51,970 --> 00:05:09,760
I'm still discovering how to use the kind of mill option that grease stencil has because look at all these effects for sure at some point it's going to be useful to have this pixelate effect that is going to pixelate our entire illustration know like different effects can be used in different situations

116
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:16,570
And I think that what I like is just looking at them and then discovering slowly when are they useful or when I'm gon Na use them

117
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:18,510
YeahI think that's really interesting too

118
00:05:18,510 --> 00:05:22,050
and sometimes you might accidentally come across something like that pixelate

119
00:05:22,050 --> 00:05:23,540
and then at some point you'll think

120
00:05:23,550 --> 00:05:23,840
ohyeah

121
00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:26,410
I remember that all exactly

122
00:05:26,420 --> 00:05:35,160
If you're wondering why didn't use this effect like wrist pencil for the eyes is because so far it doesn't work well with transparency

123
00:05:35,170 --> 00:05:36,720
So when I drew it

124
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:39,250
then I couldn't see a bit of the eyes through the transparency

125
00:05:39,310 --> 00:05:41,140
I wanted to be able to see it there

126
00:05:41,150 --> 00:05:42,590
So I did it with a normal

127
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:43,720
painting it with a brush

128
00:05:43,820 --> 00:05:45,930
I just UV unwrapped the entire head

129
00:05:45,940 --> 00:05:47,290
and then I painted bit by bit

130
00:05:47,810 --> 00:05:51,770
And the same he things here for the for my banana

131
00:05:51,780 --> 00:05:52,780
I did the same

132
00:05:52,830 --> 00:05:53,890
And then for my hand

133
00:05:53,900 --> 00:05:55,170
I simply made the same effect

134
00:05:55,170 --> 00:05:58,610
I just made some bones and I can just show here with transparency

135
00:05:58,650 --> 00:05:59,900
And I just made some bones

136
00:05:59,900 --> 00:06:02,420
and then I parented them with automatic weights

137
00:06:02,430 --> 00:06:05,670
And then I have suddenly this hand that it's actually raked

138
00:06:05,670 --> 00:06:07,940
which it's not something that we are

139
00:06:07,950 --> 00:06:08,140
you know

140
00:06:08,140 --> 00:06:10,150
like we're showing off much

141
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:11,160
But in reality

142
00:06:11,170 --> 00:06:15,700
you could just rotate these fingers and they can rotate with the illustration

143
00:06:15,700 --> 00:06:15,880
You know

144
00:06:15,880 --> 00:06:16,810
like we could Riga

145
00:06:16,820 --> 00:06:18,880
make our our animation

146
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:20,320
a little animation with the character

147
00:06:20,320 --> 00:06:23,510
Maybe it's kind of coming to grab the phone or doing whatever

148
00:06:25,180 --> 00:06:26,150
Besides that

149
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:26,900
this illustration

150
00:06:26,900 --> 00:06:29,190
I think is quite simple in the way was animated

151
00:06:29,690 --> 00:06:37,580
The only thing that maybe some people are going struggle with is just doing this frame by frame animation in which I transform this speech bubble into a circle

152
00:06:37,580 --> 00:06:39,570
But that's just done in frame by frame

153
00:06:39,580 --> 00:06:46,220
Maybe at some point we're gonna talk a bit more about different effects to animated transitions or fire or effects in frame by frame

154
00:06:46,440 --> 00:06:51,350
But there are so many references on the internet that you can find out your favorite style of animation

155
00:06:51,380 --> 00:06:54,400
I recommend looking at them frame by frame

156
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:57,740
You can download them and go frame by frame and check how it was made

157
00:06:57,740 --> 00:06:59,210
Great idea

158
00:07:00,090 --> 00:07:00,950
Besides that

159
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:02,970
do you have any other questions about this one

160
00:07:03,320 --> 00:07:10,360
I was wondering how you chose the level of detail to add on to the 3D character because there are some extra details in the 2D

161
00:07:11,170 --> 00:07:13,340
say on the banana or in the hair there

162
00:07:13,380 --> 00:07:15,780
and how did you choose how much to put in 3D

163
00:07:16,290 --> 00:07:20,320
This is about your personal choice

164
00:07:20,320 --> 00:07:21,220
Would you like

165
00:07:21,230 --> 00:07:23,130
would you think that is gonna work

166
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:26,150
I don't have an answer for that

167
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:31,810
but I do agree at some point when we started putting some of those lines in the hair

168
00:07:31,890 --> 00:07:33,870
it started feeling 2 BC 2 crowded

169
00:07:33,950 --> 00:07:34,330
you know

170
00:07:34,380 --> 00:07:36,660
3D and 2D don't work the same way

171
00:07:36,670 --> 00:07:37,840
So it's a personal choice

172
00:07:38,180 --> 00:07:39,580
The same thing with

173
00:07:39,630 --> 00:07:39,910
you know

174
00:07:39,910 --> 00:07:41,520
the shadows here are not painted

175
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:44,570
are the natural shadows that occur with the ambient occlusion

176
00:07:44,570 --> 00:07:50,240
but the shadows in here are painted and they are boiling and that's just a decision

177
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:52,320
it's an artistic decision that might be different

178
00:07:52,330 --> 00:07:52,710
You know

179
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:56,770
if Natalia starts making this illustration in 3D herself

180
00:07:56,780 --> 00:07:58,740
she might have different decisions

181
00:07:59,250 --> 00:08:04,630
YeahI think it's interesting for people to start actually thinking of the 3D illustration

182
00:08:05,040 --> 00:08:07,480
how it translates from the 2D illustration

183
00:08:07,500 --> 00:08:11,740
what the differences and similarities are and how you're keeping the same spirit

184
00:08:11,750 --> 00:08:14,620
that's sort of what we wanted to cover a lot in this course as well

185
00:08:14,660 --> 00:08:19,680
not only the technical aspects of how you model certain things and how you use the grease pencil

186
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:23,680
but also what you're actually deciding to translate and how you're doing that

187
00:08:23,690 --> 00:08:33,290
YeahI think a lot of people think that the technical bit is the most relevant one or that there is some secret button or something that turns things into 3D that's not the case

188
00:08:33,290 --> 00:08:33,490
You know

189
00:08:33,490 --> 00:08:39,100
we go case by case and that's why the illustrations look unique and special and they end up

190
00:08:39,110 --> 00:08:39,450
you know

191
00:08:39,460 --> 00:08:39,910
if this

192
00:08:39,920 --> 00:08:42,230
even if they started been made by Natalia

193
00:08:42,700 --> 00:08:48,850
it has in the end a bit of a cabeza patata look because we transformed it and I think that that's an important thing

194
00:08:48,860 --> 00:08:51,880
the more you improve as a 3D artist

195
00:08:52,030 --> 00:08:55,820
the more you're going to be able to put your personal touch on everything you make

196
00:08:55,830 --> 00:08:58,010
even if you're translating someone else's illustration

197
00:08:58,010 --> 00:09:00,270
you're going to be able to put to a little detail

198
00:09:00,270 --> 00:09:06,600
probably we went more pastel with this colors than in the original illustration from Natalie because of how we like these pastel colors

199
00:09:06,620 --> 00:09:14,660
the color palette kind of gets slowly shifted and moved towards what you like and I really want people to start exploring 3D in that way

200
00:09:14,670 --> 00:09:14,940
you know

201
00:09:14,950 --> 00:09:27,090
remember 3D is not something that touch from the rest of the art if you like something you can apply it to 3D I completely agree and with that thank you so much for following up here

202
00:09:27,570 --> 00:09:30,510
this was so nice to have this illustration from Natalia

203
00:09:30,520 --> 00:09:33,940
thank you so much for sending it and well done everyone

204
00:09:34,380 --> 00:09:39,160
thank you for following along with the course and please share your results and even share your 2D illustrations

205
00:09:39,160 --> 00:09:46,450
if you have any questions for us or for any of the other students about recommendations for how you might transform it into 3D

206
00:09:46,460 --> 00:09:47,130
just let us know

207
00:09:47,190 --> 00:09:49,540
yeahand please continue sharing your work

208
00:09:50,310 --> 00:09:51,940
It's just how we learn

209
00:09:51,950 --> 00:09:57,280
What people want is how we discover if actually people understood what was happening

210
00:09:57,310 --> 00:09:59,630
And we love seeing translations like this

211
00:10:00,010 --> 00:10:02,050
love to see everyone's do the illustrations

212
00:10:02,050 --> 00:10:04,220
transforming 3D using grease pencil

213
00:10:04,280 --> 00:10:05,240
Thanks everyone

214
00:10:05,250 --> 00:10:05,980
bye
