Transcript:
(00:00) in this video i'm going to show you how to  make a cinematic text reveal effect inside   of premiere pro if you are new to the channel i  make weekly premiere pro and filmmaking tutorials   so make sure to subscribe and hit the bell so you  don't miss out on those tutorials on the timeline   right here i have a clip of me walking over  a bridge and the thing i really want to do is   to have text get revealed as i'm walking over the  bridge so i'm going to show you how to do this the   first thing we're going to do is to make some text  so we're going to put on some text by clicking the
(00:36) text tool and just clicking on the video and  in this case i'm just going to write cinematic   inside of the essential graphics panel we can  align the text so i'm going to align it horizontal   and vertical and i'm going to make sure that  i'm putting all the text on top of the whole   video clip so if we play this back right now you  see that i'm behind the text and we're going to   create a mask to make this effect so i'm just  going to position my timeline right there and   i'm going to go into the text and hit the drop  down and now we are going to draw a mask around
(01:19) the object in this case it's me and i'm just going  to start making a mask so from the beginning here   down to my hoodie and i'm going to make  a slight curve right there and i'm just   going to follow the back of myself right  here and since the text is ending there we   don't have to be so careful so we can just make  a simple mask around the whole thing right here just like that and after we have made our  first path we need to invert it so we can   invert this mask by clicking this toggle right  here and then the text disappears so if we move
(02:07) this mask right now you will see that the text is  hidden behind that mask and then we are going to   select the stopwatch for toggle animation on the  mask path then i'm going to select the mask again   and one tip when you are working with masks you  can use this select zoom level right here so let's   say i want to go 50 into the frame that way it  will be a little bit easier to make the keyframes   more exactly we made a keyframe right here and  i'm going to go a little bit ahead of time in the
(02:44) timeline and i'm just going to drag the mask with  me and i'm going to try to get it as perfect as   possible and this can be a little bit challenging  sometimes but uh you just need to make sure that   the mask is flush with the back here so  i'm going to just skip some frames ahead each time   and once we are doing this the mask will be  animated so we are making a bunch of keyframes   right here and i'm going to skip ahead of  time and you don't have to watch me make   all the keyframes so after you have tracked  your mask so let's play back this right now
(03:25) and see how it looks and of course i  didn't do a super perfect job on this   one i just want to show you the concept of it  on the screen right now i got another tutorial   for you to watch next and if you haven't  yet make sure to subscribe and hit the bell   thank you so much for watching create and  inspire and i will see you in the next video
