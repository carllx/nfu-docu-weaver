The SCAMPER creative thinking model is an acronym for a brainstorming technique that uses targeted questions to generate innovative ideas by exploring different ways to alter existing products, processes, or services. The letters stand for: Substitute, Combine, Adapt, Modify (and Magnify/Minify), Put to another use, Eliminate, and Reverse. By applying these prompts, individuals and teams can challenge the status quo and uncover new possibilities.
 
How to Use the SCAMPER Model
You can apply the SCAMPER technique to a specific idea, product, process, or problem to explore new possibilities. For each letter of the acronym, ask questions related to that prompt and brainstorm potential answers: 
Substitute: Ask, "What can be substituted or changed?" Consider substituting components, materials, or even the entire process to find alternative solutions. 
Combine: Ask, "What can be combined?" Look for opportunities to merge two or more ideas, features, or processes to create something new or more efficient. 
Adapt: Ask, "What can be adapted or adjusted?" Think about how an idea or process can be modified, tweaked, or adjusted to improve its outcome. 
Modify (Magnify/Minify): Ask, "What can be modified, magnified, or minimized?" Consider changing the size, shape, form, or any other characteristic of the item or process. 
Put to another use: Ask, "What are other potential uses?" Explore if the product or process can be applied in a different context or used in a new way. 
Eliminate: Ask, "What can be eliminated or simplified?" Identify aspects that are unnecessary, redundant, or that can be removed to achieve desired results more efficiently. 
Reverse: Ask, "What if the process were reversed or rearranged?" Think about restructuring the idea, reversing the order of steps, or approaching the problem from a different perspective.
