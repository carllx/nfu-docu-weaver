Kolb's experiential learning cycle is a four-stage model of learning, developed by David Kolb, that describes how knowledge is created through the transformation of experience. The cycle consists of Concrete Experience (feeling), Reflective Observation (watching), Abstract Conceptualization (thinking), and Active Experimentation (doing). Learners move through these stages, with each stage building on the last, to create new knowledge and skills.
 
The Four Stages of Kolb's Experiential Learning Cycle
1. Concrete Experience (CE): This is the initial experience, or "doing" something new. It involves a direct, personal involvement with a new situation or activity. 
2. Reflective Observation (RO): After the experience, the learner reflects on what happened. This stage involves observing and considering the details of the experience from different viewpoints. 
3. Abstract Conceptualization (AC): Here, the learner thinks about the experience and develops theories or general principles. This is where logic and analysis are used to make sense of the reflections. 
4. Active Experimentation (AE): The final stage involves putting the new knowledge into practice. Learners test the theories they developed by experimenting with new actions or solutions in a real-world context. 
How the Cycle Works
The learning process is cyclical, meaning it begins again after the active experimentation phase with a new, related concrete experience. 
Individuals process experience in two ways: by grasping (concrete experience and abstract conceptualization) and by transforming (reflective observation and active experimentation). 
Kolb also identified that individuals have different learning styles, such as Divergers, Assimilators, Convergers, and Accommodators, based on their preferences for different stages of the cycle.
