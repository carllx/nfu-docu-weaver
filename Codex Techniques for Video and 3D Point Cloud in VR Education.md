This memo offers a detailed summary of the crucial technologies needed for encoding and decoding video and 3D point cloud data. 

Its purpose is to provide insights into  [[Next-Generation Immersive Visuals for VR education platforms]] As a practical guide, it aims to simplify the process of encoding and decoding 3D point clouds, thereby improving the video data capture for VR educational use. 

Currently,  the focus may lean more toward encoding due to my significant research dedicated to the 3D Point Cloud Video Capturing aspect.


## Self-attention based encoding 

Think of a story for a video as a treasure map. It has a lot of details, but not everything is a clue to find the treasure. The "important information" in a story is like the big, bold X on the map it's what helps you to understand the story and tells you where the treasure (or the most exciting part) is. When you make a video, you want to make sure that the X \u2013 or the important parts of your story, like the main problem and how it gets solved \u2013 is clear to everyone who watches.

Let's talk about self-attention based encoding as if it were a super-smart highlighter. If you were reading a book and had to only highlight the most important sentences so your friend could understand the whole story without reading every single word, that would take some careful thinking, right?

Well, self-attention is like a computer tool that does just that  it's a part of artificial intelligence that reads the whole story and figures out which parts are like the bold X on a treasure map. It gives more attention to the key sentences and words that tell you the most about the story. Then, it encodes, or translates, the entire story with those key parts in mind.

### Explain

想象你有一个故事要讲，但这个故事又长又复杂。如果我们想让电脑理解这个故事，我们需要把它变成一种代码。这个过程就像是把故事翻译成电脑能听懂和使用的秘密语言。

现在，把故事想象成视频里的宝藏图。它有很多细节，但不是每个细节都能帮你找到宝藏。故事中的“重要信息”就像宝图上醒目的大X一样——它帮助你理解故事并告诉你哪里是宝藏（或者最激动人心的部分）。做视频时，你要确保这个大X——或者说故事中的重要部分，比如主要问题和解决方法——对看的人来说是清楚的。

现在，让我们把自注意力编码（self-attention based encoding）想象成一个超级聪明的荧光笔。如果你在读书时，只能用荧光笔标出最重要的句子，这样你的朋友不用看每一个字就能理解整个故事，这需要仔细思考，对吗？

自注意力就像是电脑中的一个工具，它就是这样做的——它是人工智能的一部分，可以阅读整个故事，并找出哪些部分像宝图上的大X。它会更关注那些能让你更了解这个故事的关键句子和词语。然后，它会编码，或者说用这些关键部分转化整个故事。
