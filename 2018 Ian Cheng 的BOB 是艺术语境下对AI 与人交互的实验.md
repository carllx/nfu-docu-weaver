Another notable artist using simulation technology is the New-York-based Chinese-American artist Ian Cheng.  
另一位使用模拟技术的著名艺术家是纽约的美籍华裔艺术家[[ Ian Cheng]]。

Inspired by his educational background in cognitive science, Cheng’s work explores the agency and interactivity of virtual intelligence using “live simulation,” or “video games that play themselves” [184].  
受认知科学教育背景的启发，Cheng 的工作使用“实时模拟”或“玩自己的视频游戏”[184] 探索虚拟智能的代理和交互性。[[RealTime]] [[simulation]]

The work BOB (Bag of Beliefs) (2018-2019) is a snake-like monster lifeform that is alternately driven by multiple sub-agent systems with different personalities and desires, generating corresponding judgements, speculations, reactions and memories to various events and elements  
作品BOB（Bag of Beliefs）（2018-2019）是一种蛇形怪物生命体，由多个不同性格和欲望的子代理系统交替驱动，对各种事件和元素产生相应的判断、推测、反应和记忆

Meanwhile, viewers can interact with the snake monster through their cell phones and send virtual "offerings" and text messages to the snake monster, thus influencing its response to the environment and objects.  
同时，观众可以通过手机与蛇怪互动，向蛇怪发送虚拟“供品”和短信，从而影响其对环境和物体的反应。[[Interaction]]

In this process, new dynamics are generated between different viewers’ behaviours, so that new relationships are formed between viewers through the connection of the snake monster.  
在这个过程中，不同观众的行为之间会产生新的动态，从而通过蛇怪的联系，在观众之间形成新的关系。

Cheng considers his work as a construction of a kind of “Minimum Viable Sentience” [37], and “BOB” is indeed an experiment on the interaction between intelligent systems and people in the context of art.  
程认为他的作品是一种“最小可行感知”[37]的构建，而“BOB”确实是在艺术语境下对智能系统与人交互的实验。[[Computer-Science---Artificial-Intelligence]]
