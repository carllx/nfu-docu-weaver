> [!question] How do you differentiate the focus of digital media courses for students in the School of Sculpture and the School of Public Art?
> 请问数字媒体课程对于雕塑学院与公共艺术学院的学生应该如何在教学重心上进行区分?




For example, at **UMD Department of Art**¹, digital media courses for sculpture students focus on exposing them to the means in which digital technology can be brought to bear on fine arts practices, such as 3D modeling, animation, interactive installation, and custom software. On the other hand, at **Sessions College**⁶, digital media courses for public art students place an emphasis on techniques for time-based media, such as video making, motion graphics, and sound design.

Of course, these are not definitive or exclusive categories. Some digital media courses may overlap or integrate both sculpture and public art aspects. For instance, at **RISD Digital + Media Master’s Program**³, students explore art, technology and emergent practices using a wide range of research methods and forms—both digital and analog—to investigate technology as a creative medium and cultural-historical phenomenon.
