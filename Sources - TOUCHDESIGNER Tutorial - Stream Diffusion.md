Transcript:
(00:01) [Music] hello everyone and welcome in this video I'm going to try a stable diffusion tool by that simulate I was playing around with this tool for a while now and I decided to record the video so we can go through it together to be able to have access to this tool you need to download it from simulate patreon Channel I put the link in description please also consider that you need to do some uh preparation in your computer before you use this uh tool and it's also just available for [Music]
(01:06) Windows so let's drop the file [Music] here in the parameter if you go to install here there is a view installation guide you can press on PA and you get all the information you need need to work with this tool so here there some uh requirements you need to have Windows 10 or 11 and uh Nvidia graphic card that uh supports [Music] Cuda you also need the [Music] python you need the coda duplate and you need get after you install uh all of these probably you need to close your
(02:10) your uh touch designer and open it again and here there are like installation steps which we go through it together first thing we need to download the stream diffusion I press this button so you need to download the the fusion like somewhere I made a new folder [Music] here and now it's downloaded and the second install uh is uh to create a virtual environment [Music] [Music] and now here it starts
(03:15) to download this part takes more time than the previous one I used this tool a few months ago and everything worked out perfectly but for making this video I run into some problems which I now tell you how to fix them I think if you are just installing this tool right now it's possible that you also get this problem so now we wait for this to finish and now it's [Music] done one thing that I noticed is that after this step you need to save your file if you don't save your file this uh like installation doesn't work correctly as you see we don't see
(04:14) the tick next to it so I save it and I open it again now we see it shows that it's inst and the third option is to install 10 sword but as you see when which try to install it we get some error and it doesn't [Music] work and here when we go to start streaming we see it's not connecting it's not streaming so I noticed that here in streen diffusion folder if you go to this folder Verve where everything is installed there uh there is a folder called hugging face is hop now that is October when I tried this uh I realized that the hugging pH
(05:11) uh version is uh 26 but the previous stram diffusion that I downloaded a few months ago was I think 247 anyways you need to download the previous version probably to be able to use this tool or maybe I don't know maybe in future there is a newest version of this tool but since I already downloaded a stream diffusion a few months ago I'm going to that folder and here in then folder we go to lip and we go to side packages and here we see that the version that I was working for me was 24.7 so I copy these two folder
(06:00) and I paste them in this new string diffusion that I created for this video and now let's try now it's [Music] working so now here you see my FPS is very low but it's working [Music] now and now here I want to install tort so I go to acceleration I put it on T and it helps us to get like better fps now here we install it this is also takes a bit of time not that long but [Music]
(07:09) now we turn on the hugging face cache and I save it again and I restart so from here we continue working with the tool I hope you already made it [Music] so here I already have put some prompts [Music] and I also add some seeds uh we can go through it together so here I just [Music] remove the seeds [Music] in uh SE blocks you can add as many blocks as you like but I was doing it with four blocks now I'm just undoing to get them
(08:15) back and you have one C block and the weight so you can decide how much each seat affects and here in CFG type I put it on Ste and my model is s turbo because I think uh 10 s just work with s to you can change this one also from tensor to X forer or you put it on none and here you can change the resolution you can even have more resolution but it will be very slow based on my experience because I'm using a 4070 artics graphic card and it's pretty slow so let's try to [Music]
(09:22) connect now you see my FPS is on 16 which is I should say it's SCH so here in two and here you will see the S Mode you can put it on image to image or text to image in this video we are trying image to image and here the limit FPS is the FPS is what you have here in your touch designer so here when I change the FPS the limit FPS is also changes me time me.
(10:03) time that's [Music] wa here you can change the total weight of your prompt so I bring a noise as my input [Music] and you can play around with the [Music] noise so here we have this [Music] [Music] prompt and we have the weights Under The Prompt which you can also to change that from 0 to one zero is like no effect and one is
(11:05) [Music] small and here in the steps the lower the number of a step is the less our image effects and the more the step is the closer to our input so if you put the steps on one almost we get almost nothing from the image that we are receiving it's just the prompts that we are writing now here I want to make a separate space to see the result I add a null after the tool I want to compare our inputs with output here so it's easier
(12:12) to see the difference now here the steps you see how it change the result [Music] so you can also animate each one of these [Music] parameters and here we play around with the seats I have three block of seats and you can change the weights until you get the results that you want [Music] you can also animate all these parameters for example if you have a live show and you want to do real time
(13:17) sound reactive something then you can animate these parameters with the sound and also if we change the noise input we can get real time [Music] [Music] effect but if I want my image to have animation then I need to create an animation for my noise so I go to transform translate Z and I write AB time that seconds now you see we have a very fast movement but I want to make it slower so I multiply it to [Music]
(14:23) 0.1 now I change the step I go to my noise [Music] you see we whatever we change it's kind of drastically affects the [Music] output with period you can also create kind of a zoom in and zoom back image [Music] and we can also change the seat so I put the Delta on 1.5 and the guidance scale is on one so let's play along with them to see what happens and here in uh prompt blocks you
(15:30) can also add as many blocks as you want so I have two prompts block I write another prompts here like cloudy Sky tall buildings hyper realistic and realistic lighting now we can switch between these two fronts and here I Chang the noise again [Music] [Music] [Music]
(16:43) now I want to switch between these two prompts [Music] [Music] [Music] I bring ol oil I gave reference to weight I put it on gasan [Music] I bring a MK and I use this mask for the second P I go to Range in mass and I found two range from
(17:49) 1 to zero now I want to make this slower I lower down the frequency but now if you want want them to just switch and don't uh have this blend in Mass I go to integer and I put it on round now you see it just goes from zero to one I add another mask before this and I put this also on round and I use this instead of LFO now you see switch between this and [Music] [Music]
(18:56) this so let's bring that the SK [Music] so let's change the integral of masses to off and now we kind of have this blend between the two image and here I also change the frequency and I make it lower so we see more on each [Music] image now instead of this noise you can bring an sound reactive Visual and connect it [Music] to this tool so here I already brought this
(20:04) patch so I have a audio file [Music] in and here I add a audio analyze you can get it from the palette [Music] here and I add a filter to make the movement and more smooth and here the visual that I'm using is actually from a video I made it's on my YouTube It's generative art three I think so I create this visual also from noise and I already put it in a base in a container and I made also some custom parameters for it [Music] so now I connect this to the string diffusion so I want to just show you how
(21:10) you can make also sound [Music] reactive now I play around with the parameters here [Music] so let's turn on the display to also see the both images at the same time [Music] [Music] you can add more prompts now let's hear the sound [Music]
(22:36) the music that I'm using is from new album it's about engine that we had a life for four months also recently and use this tool I also put the link to his album if you are interested to listen it's very nice uh one more thing that we can do to improve our image quality is to bring a Nvidia upscaler from Top now you see if I turn off this you will see the sharpness of the image is lower but when I turn it on we have kind of a better quality it might affect your FPS if your FPS fa too much then it's better to stop the string
(23:28) diffusion and start it again but be careful with this it might C your software might crash but be also be careful with up scaler because if it's like if you put it like in a very uh higher scale and your graphic card is not that powerful it might crash so with two for me is working well I put it on three I put it on [Music] four at some point maybe the difference is not that much but this is also a good thing to consider using and that's it I hope you enjoy this video and it was helpful for you pleas please subscribe to my channel for
