-François Morellet's work is characterized by the combination of stern and organized geometry with humor, inventive systems, and chance. -He is considered a visionary, experimental, cheerful, rigorously fun, and vibratory conceptual artist who owes much to Theo van Doesburg, Max Bill, Hans Arp, and Sophie Taeuber-Arp, among others. -Morellet applies systems in his work to exonerate himself from the beauty of the composition, and his entire body of work is fully preconceived before execution. -He founded the GRAV movement in 1960, aiming to produce environments that stimulated the spectator into participation and considered that the onlooker provides half of the work. -François Morellet was born in Cholet, France, lived and worked there his whole life, but despite his geographical isolation, he had 540 solo shows and participated in 2,750 group shows that took him to prominent museums around the world.
