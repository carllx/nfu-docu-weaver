## 22 Colors and Corrections
### 1. Skin Retouching Pt. 1

So this is where we left off.
We imported our footage into Premiere Pro.
We took a look at a different workspaces and a different panels.
Now it's time to get started with our first lesson, which is how we can deal with imperfections on
the skin and just give the skin an overall smooth effect.
So before that, let's clear the markers that we made in the previous lesson by right clicking on the
timeline, the time stamps right here, and then hitting the clear markers option.
Now they're gone.
And I can create more markers if I need to.
I'm going to start with our first clip, which is a close up shot of this person.
There are some imperfections.
So we're going to remove those pimples and just give the skin a smoother look.
Let's get rid of the extra clips and work with our first clip.
Use backspace to delete those clips.
And for this one, I don't really need the audio.
Therefore, I can just get rid of it by holding down option or alt and clicking on the audio track.
Hit backspace to delete.
It can also do this when you're bringing in the video.
So if you go to project double, click on your clip.
You can use drag the video alone.
So we're going to need to choose a different workspace for this lesson, and we're going to be using
this workspace quite a lot since we're dealing with colors within a video.
So let's head over to our workspace and switch to the color workspace.
This is going to give us a little metric color panel, which we already know how to use.
But if for some reason it's not there, you can just bring it in using the window tab and enable the
panel select your clip.
Over here, I have it set on source so you can kind of see the before and after.
And we're pretty familiar with the different panels.
But for this lesson and the upcoming lessons, we're going to focus on the cell secondary.
This is a really helpful section of the metric color panel because it allows you to work with a certain
selection of colors.
It can help us isolate colors, change the color of that isolated section or in our case, deal with
the skin tones within the clip.
So it's a really helpful area in the color section, and we're going to see how it works.
So we have a different droppers here, which you can use to select a certain area, certain color,
and put it in the selection.
You can add to that selection and then remove from that selection.
Then we go to different colors and the edge as well, which stands for hue saturation and luminance.
You can enable or disable these by pressing these checkboxes.
Then we have the area down here, which is for you to see what exactly you're selecting and what you're
not selecting.
So color gray means that your color will be there, and anything else that's not selected will be great.
You can do this with black or just go for like a black and white.
Look, anything that's white is your selection.
Anything that's black is not in your selection.
We can invert the selection, reset the entire thing, refine the selection, and then do some correction
to that area.
So let's begin.
I'm going to select his skin tone.
So grab this eyedropper tool.
And when selecting, you want to grab a mid range of colors so you're not going for the highlights or
the shadows, but a rather average area.
So somewhere around here, usually it's on the cheek.
But in our example where we have some redness on the cheek, we want to really avoid that because we're
trying to get this skin tone and not this dark red.
So grab one of the areas, click once and you can see that our sliders look different.
So we're getting these two triangles and these white lines.
The top triangle is your selection for the saturation.
The bottom one is the feathered amount.
So the further away it is, the smaller details you can bring in.
The closer it is, the less of those small details you're bringing in going to command Z and go back
to what we had in order to see what I just selected.
I'm going to use this option using this.
I can see what my selection looks like.
So let's go over here and we're going to leave Hue as it is.
I'm going to bring in more colors later with the Eyedropper Tools for Saturation.
You can just grab the sliders, but first we need to work with the luminance and once we have the right
amount inside our selection, we can work with the saturation later.
So grab the edge right here and pull it towards the right first with the top triangle.
And if I want to bring in those finer details, I can just use the second triangle.
Something like this.
Now I have brought in most of the skin, but we've left out some smaller areas so I can use the saturation
right here, the top triangle first, bring it in until I have a nice selection of the skin and then
use the bottom triangle to bring in those little details around our selection.
So far, it's looking good.
But we have left out some of the red areas of the skin.
So let's grab this eyedropper with a plus and select the area under nose.
There it is.
We got most of our skin, but we also ended up bringing in some of the hair and the eyebrows and all
that.
So to fix that, we can just again, use the.
Luminance slider.
Pull it back until we only get.
The skin you took.
If you're not getting these tiny bits, others are already in the shadows.
So.
So the imperfections wouldn't be as noticeable compared to the brighter parts of his face.
But I'm just going to use the bottom slider to just get rid of the eyebrows and all of that.
The most important part is the brightest part of his face because that contains the pimples.
So just focus on this big, bright area and the rest is not that important.
So just use your sliders until you get a decent selection of your skin.
Once you have that, you're going to blur the edges.
Just grab the blur slider and the more you pull it towards the divide, the more blurry those gray areas
will be.
But we just want a subtle look.
So the skin smoothing effect isn't that noticeable.
Think three and one half is good.
Then let's scroll down and remove from the sharpness and zoom in right here on the skin.
Grab 150 and pull down.
Focus on the big area.
So let's reduce from the sharpness because if I add to it, I'm going to bring in more of those pores
and all the pimples.
But if I remove from it, I'm going to kind of flatten out my subject's face.
The goal with skin retouching isn't to completely flatten out the skin.
We want some of that texture, but we're just trying to reduce those pores and those fine lines.
So this is not what we're looking for, but rather something a little bit more subtle.
So around -28 will give us a more natural result.
Now, if I uncheck this box, you can see the difference.
It's a little bit of a blur.
Let me just zoom in a bit more.
So we can see exactly what that looks like on the skin.
This is without secondary.
This is with it.
It's a really subtle change, but it's going to help the skin look a little better.
Once you've zoomed in, you can also grab the saturation and maybe make them look a bit more pale or
more or add more of that color to their skin.
Depends on your clip, really.
I will add some saturation because the video is really cold and it could also use some color.
So 112 is good for me.
You can also use a contrast slider to reduce some of those shadows that are caused by these wrinkles.
So just grab it towards the left.
Again, we're not looking to make them look really flat, but rather a subtle change in those contrast.
Once we're done with those effects, you can go ahead and uncheck the color gray to get rid of that
overlay.
And now I can just close off edges all secondary.
And now I have myself a smoother skin for my subject.
But because we use Excel secondary, it's only limited under face.
If I were to use a mask and and track it, I might have ended up getting bits of his eye, his eyebrow
and all that.
But as you saw, the Excel secondary helped me get only skin tones.
Now let's go ahead and take this a step further and let me go back to my source.
I can see it before and after right here.
Let's duplicate our clip by holding down option or alt on windows and just dragging one right above.
This is our duplicate.
Let's go to the effect right here and look for Gaussian blur effect right here.
Drag this onto the second clip, the duplicate.
Go to the effect controls for your top clip.
And what we're going to do is do first reduce the saturation completely.
So go to the basic correction on the duplicate, of course, and reduce the saturation.
So essentially, a black and white video is what we have.
Now we're just going to the blue section and add a decent amount.
Around 20 is suitable for my clip.
And what we're going to do is to just change the blending mode to soft light.
So this video entirely.
Just go to opacity blend mode and change this to self light.
So this already adds some softness and some contrast to our clip.
Of course, we get to change the amount of contrast with the curves down here.
Go to B curves and you can just.
Lift those areas and change the way this looks.
This already is a form of color grading this technique, but it also gives us a little bit of flair.
So you can just use the.
The curves to make it the way you want it.
Can also use the basic correction, maybe lift the shadows, reduce those highlights, and just make
this the way you want it.
So let's zoom in right here and see how the effect.
Has softened out the skin of her subject.
Go in right here and move these to one floor up so I can bring my original clip.
Let's nest these by selecting them both.
Right.
Clicking nest.
In retouch.
Then below this, I'm going to bring in my original clip.
Just drag the video alone.
So this is with the skin retouching.
This is without it.
So it's a really subtle change, and that's exactly what we need.
Now onto the pimples that we want to remove.
We are going to use the Gaussian perfect one more time.
So just create a new adjustment layer right over here.
Okay.
And bring this right above.
I'm going to call this.
Name it here.
I'm going to call this spot and just match the duration.
Just go back to the beginning of our timeline and zoom in on to one of those points that we'd like to
remove.
Let's start from the forehead.
We got one right here.
And on this spot adjustment layer, we want to add the blur effect one more time.
Put it right above and using the effect controls.
We're going to grab the circular mask.
Just drag it right above your pimple and really looking to create a perfect circle with enough space
around it so that we can feather it later on.
So you're looking for something like this?
You can make sure that you're at the beginning of your timeline and making nice.
May I ask around that pimple?
We're going to track this forward.
So it follows the pimple throughout the video.
Press this button and it's going to track the pimple throughout your video.
Once the tracking is finished, we have all of these keyframes on our mask path.
Now what we want to do is to just increase the blurriness underneath Gaussian blur.
Make sure that you have repeat pixels turned on.
Just check it right here, then go ahead and increase the blurriness amount.
Something like this, then increase your mask feather so that it blends in better with the rest of the
skin.
Now, when I go back, it looks pretty good.
This works better with pimples that don't have that much of a height, something like this or this one.
So far, we learned how to smooth out the skin and give it a better look.
In the next lesson, we're going to see how we can use after effects and get rid of these bigger areas
that you see right here.
So we're going to finish off this look in the next lesson using the help of after effects and some basic
color correction.
See you guys in the next lesson.


### 2. Skin Retouching Pt. 2

In today's lesson, I'm going to show you two different methods that you can use to clear your subject's
face.
So let's get started.
This is where we left off.
We remove the texture from the skin, and we also used a really simple technique to get rid of a pimple.
So we made this layer for these spots on his forehead.
This is what it looked like before, and this is what it looks like after.
Now, this isn't the only way that you can remove spots within Premiere Pro.
There are better ways out there and of course, ways that can give you a cleaner result.
So we're going to take a look at one of those methods today, which is to use after effects within Premiere
Pro.
So this right now is kind of acceptable.
But the problem is that we're still seeing an outline of that pimple.
So it's not that perfect.
And that's why we can use a more suitable program for these things, which is after effects.
So I'm just going to duplicate all three of my layers, hold down option or alt and just drag them towards
the right side on this second duplicate set.
We're going to get rid of these spots.
And right click on skin Retouch.
So like, do you replace with after effect composition?
And this way we can take this into after effects edited there and then bring it back into Premiere Pro.
It's going to ask you to save your project.
Just do it real quick.
Call it spot it.
Okay, So it brought that exact linked comp inside here.
And when it comes to removing spots within after effects, there are many ways that you can do it.
You can either use the clone tool, the brush tool, some masking blurs, and just a lot more options
that you would normally have inside Premiere Pro.
So first, let's go ahead and duplicate our skin retouch, command or control.
DX I'm going to call the bottom one.
Hatch and the top one source.
Are you going to create different mask layers on source and have patch kind of reveal itself underneath?
You can go ahead and create many more masks so you can get rid of all the spots, But I'm just going
to stick with two for now so that we can focus on the actual technique.
So go to the beginning of your timeline.
All down space to move up.
Using the Ellipse tool, we're going to create a nice mask around our first pimple.
There you go.
That's.
Move it up a bit.
And then we're going to just change this from add to subtract.
So it's going to reveal what's underneath, which is our patch layer.
So if I solo my source layer, you can see there's a big hole.
And you can see the transparency background by turning on this.
Before we move on, need to kind of soften things out.
So open your mask layer and feather this guy out.
So it looks so it looks rather soft.
Let's do the same thing with our second pimple.
Grab the same source layer ellipse tool, and draw a nice circle around your second pimple.
Track it up a bit and change it from add to subtract, then feather that edge.
Until it looks good.
When I bring back my layers, everything is going to look normal.
But when I hit P on my patch layer and move it around, you can see that I have removed that pimple
simply by pushing this video a little bit towards the right.
So this is what I look like before I use position X to just move it a little bit towards the right.
And since the source layer is above it and the only hole for the bottom layer to be visible is the spot
in which the pimple was there.
We ended up getting this pimple removal effect just by using the actual skin.
You can see that the other people is gone, too.
You can't play around with this.
You can see that I'm just simply moving the skin around.
You can use position X and Y until you get a decent result.
So there we go.
We got rid of two of the pimples.
Just by using this patching technique.
Now because our video is moving, we need to track the different mask.
So select mask one and mask two, right click track mask.
Make sure you're at the beginning of your timeline and choose the right message for the for the mask.
Depending on how your video is looking, you would want to choose one of these.
My subject is keeping their head still.
They're just tilting a little bit towards the left and right.
So a simple position scale rotation method will do it for me.
I have both of the mask selected and now I can go ahead and track forward.
Once we're done tracking, we're going to get all of these key frames and if you want, you can go ahead
and create more mask around the pimples.
But for this example, I'm just going to stick with these two different mask.
So now when we scroll through, you can see that those pimples are no longer there.
If I just bring the original video underneath.
You can see the difference.
This is before we had the pimples up here.
This one and this one.
And this is after.
And if you'd like, you can also create keyframes for the patch layer so that when the movement happens
on the source layer, we do not reveal something underneath.
So you can see the patch layer is currently right here, but I can also create key frames for it.
And have it be at different times so that I don't get any additional imperfections from the patch earlier.
So this was our second technique.
It's rather easy.
We only need to use after Effects and Premiere Pro.
Once we're done, we can hit command, se or control S on Windows and then go back to Premiere Pro.
Now we got rid of those two pimples, so there's definitely a big difference.
But here we can see the little outline of the pimple, but on the second technique, we just don't get
that outline at all.
Now I'm going to show you a third technique, which is a little time consuming, but it gives you the
best result.
So just duplicate this layer one more time, not the spots adjustment layer.
And again, we're going to right click.
Replace with after effects composition.
So on this one, we're actually going to be using Photoshop through after Effects.
So this is three programs working together, but it gives you the most professional looking result when
it comes to skin imperfections.
It can also be used for any other scenario where you want to remove something from that area.
It could be removing people, removing different spots on a shirt, anything that requires advanced
tools for you to just remove that bit in the most clean way.
So for this third technique, I'm actually going to use our next video, which.
I'm just going to make a sequence.
From this clip.
So over here, this person does have a lot of pimples, especially on their chin area.
And for me to use the previous techniques, it would not be that suitable because they're closely paced
and we're getting rather big bumps.
So for this one, we're going to jump into the third technique, which involves After Effects and Photoshop.
So we're using three programs together.
I'm just going to get rid of the part where he covers his face so we only get this bit.
I'm going to duplicate this.
So we see a before and after and right click replace with after effects composition.
So over here we're going to do a similar method.
We're going to mask those pimples individually and subtract them and feather them out so that the edges
look clean.
Let's zoom in right onto his chin and begin making our mask.
You can also use the pen tool if there's a big patch that you'd like to get rid of for this, I'm going
to use the Ellipse tool and the pen tool.
So go to the beginning of your timeline.
This one.
I can just get rid of it using the Ellipse tool.
Make sure to change it from add to subtract.
So we're looking to create those little holes all around these subjects.
Face it f on that mask, let's add maybe ten pixels to get a softer look and proceed down and create
as many masks as you need.
If you want to use a pen tool, just grab it.
Selecting the video first and just create a nice selection around that area.
Be sure to leave enough space so that when you feather it, you do not reveal bits of that imperfection,
subtract and feather.
So I'm going to repeat this all over his face.
Make sure that you're doing at the start of your timeline and not later so that everything is nicely
placed and we can track moving forward.
If at the beginning of your timeline, your subject is looking straight, then you can just go forward
to your masking there, then track backwards, then forward.
But for my case, my subject is just looking straight into camera from the beginning to the end, so
I might as well just start here.
So I'm going to repeat this masking all around his face and then I'll be right back to continue.
So I made all these different masks around his face, mostly his chin.
And before we get started, the tracking, we're going to turn the mode of all of our mask to non first
we chose subtract so we can make sure that our selection includes extra bits from the face and that
we don't get little bits of the pimple revealed.
Once we're done with the selection, select your first mask all downshift, then the last mask change
it from whatever it is to none.
So we want to make sure that there is something visible for after effects to track.
With all of them selected right Click Track Mask, and you're going to get this in your tracker panel.
If your tracker panel is not visible, just bring it in right here.
And make sure that all of your mask is within this area.
I'm going to put mine on position, scale and rotation because like we said, if your subject is looking
straight ahead, you don't really need to do much.
But if they were turning around, maybe tilting their head, then you would want to choose a different
method.
I'm just going to stick with position, scale and rotation.
Then we can begin tracking forward.
This is going to take some time.
So let it do its thing and then I'll be back so we can continue.
So now we have all of these keyframes for the mask.
And when we scroll through, you can see that the mask is stuck in our subject's face when they're moving.
Once I have this, I can now turn the mode to subtract.
I have all of them selected.
Just go over here and change it from none to subtract.
Now we're going to get these little holes inside our subject's face.
And now this is where Photoshop comes in.
Grab the content Aware fill panel, which should be in your sidebar.
But if it's not, just go over here and.
Enable it right there.
So now once we have this, we can go ahead and create our reference frame, which is basically going
to be a picture of your video in the best state.
And based on that after effect, is going to fill in those areas that you selected with the mask.
So it's basically like the content aware fill in Photoshop, but it works a bit differently.
And I walk you through that right now before that's let's just change the mask modes into none so that
in Photoshop we get to deal with the whole picture first and then we can get rid of those spots separately.
So bring in your content aware feel panel.
If you're not seeing it, just enable it here and you're just going to create a reference frame.
So this depends entirely on your video.
If there is a shift in lighting in your clip, you would need to create multiple reference frames.
For example, if over here my subject just looks to the side and we get a shadow casted, I would have
to create another reference frame a few frames before that shift.
But if your subject is looking straight ahead and there isn't any difference in lighting, then you
only need one frame.
So the number of reference frames depends on the amount of shifts in lighting, and you would create
those frames before that shift and then after the shift.
So I'm just going to make a marker here just to show you what I mean.
Let's say a right on this marker, my subject looks towards the left and we get a darker, just a shadow
casted on this side of his face.
So before he turns his face, which is right over here, I'm going to make a reference frame, and then
I would need to make another one after.
So we have a frame for before he turns his face and another frame for when he turns his face.
This way, after Effects, we'll know that this is still the same face, but there is just a shift in
lighting.
But luckily for our video, everything is pretty stable.
We do not get any different lighting, so I only need to create one for this video.
And it goes to the beginning where the subject is looking straight ahead and then click on Create Reference
Frame.
This will take you to Photoshop and if other versions opened here and we have our reference layer.
Now let's get rid of the spots using the healing brush in Photoshop.
Select your letter j on your keyboard to grab the healing Brush tool if you want, click it.
You can choose it right here by default.
It may be on this one, but this is more suitable.
Click on it once right click.
Make sure that your hardness is at zero and you have the right sizing.
Once we're done with that, we can hold down option or alt.
Grab a source point and cover up those pimples.
You can also use the right and lift bracket key to change the size of your brush.
Make your selection and just cover those up.
Hold down the spacebar to move the canvas around and just use whatever method you prefer to cover up
these spots.
It's a lot easier to do it in Photoshop because of all the extra tools that we have.
Once you're done removing those spots, you're going to just create a layer that's just going to soften
things out on the face.
So duplicate your reference frame command.
I then change the blending mode to vivid light.
We're trying to make everything flat, then go to filter other high pass.
It increases until you have a rather flat surface on your subject's face.
So maybe around five is suitable OC soften out those edges using a simple Gaussian blur effect.
I will go with one in OC hold down option or alt press on the mask button and now we're just going on
the areas that we removed just to make everything a little bit flat.
So grab your brush it, be on your keyboard with the white color, make sure that you have zero hardness.
Zoom right in and just go over those areas.
Before that, I'm just going to reduce the fill to maybe 40%.
Strike 54 now, so we don't completely blur out the face and just give it a rather soft look.
I also have my flow at around 38.
So just go over the areas that you just painted over with the Healing Brush tool, and that way we can
get a softer look on those healing brush edges.
So this is what it looked like before.
This is after.
It's a really subtle change, but it's going to make those spots less visible.
This is the easiest method for removing spots.
You can also do frequency separation, which is something that most photographers are familiar with.
But I'm just going to stick with the simplest method, just in case a frequency separation may be too
complex for some of you.
All right.
So once you're done removing these spots from your subject's face, are you going to hit command as.
And then go back into after Effects.
Once we're in after Effects, we're going to drag the reference frame below the original video, go
on the original, clip it over to the content aware, feel and change the film method to surface and
make sure you have lightning correction turned on.
You can choose the amount of light and correction going to go with moderate and range.
We want to put it on work area.
Then we're going to go back to the video.
It m on our keyboard to reveal all the mask.
Select them all.
And change them from none to subtract.
Once we're done with that, we're going to generate fill layer.
Have your play head at the beginning of the timeline and then hit generate field layer.
It's going to analyze your clip and then fill in those gaps.
You can see we have a new fill layer.
Just let it do its thing and then you'll be left with a clean face for your subject.
So once it's done analyzing, we now have a clear skin for our subject.
Moving forward, you can see that everything is pretty clean.
This is only possible because of the feather of the mask and of course Photoshop.
So using those different portals, we can get a clean result like this.
So what's happening here is that this film layer was generated from the Photoshop editing that we did.
So as you can see, when I solo this, we have clear skin.
They're just in little circles because the filter layer is connected to the mask that we made these
guys.
And the reference frame is the frame that we edited in Photoshop.
So this is the Photoshop layer.
The filter uses this reference frame to fill in those areas that we created using the mask.
So it has many steps, but the end result is pretty good, as you can see.
So make sure to check your video and that you do not reveal any of the pimples throughout the timeline.
If you saw that one of the imperfections was visible, you can always just go to the video, add a mask
to that new layer, and then just generate that filter again.
You can also delete any of these if you'd prefer, but I don't think that that would be the case.
You would usually want to add to the areas which, like we said, you can do by creating a new mask
and having after effects.
Analyze the footage again.
So this was before.
We had all these areas on his face.
This is after.
Once we're done in after effects, we can hit command as or control as to go back to Premiere Pro.
So this is where the original video took place.
When I zoom in, you can see that we're not getting those imperfections like we did in the original
clip.
Zoom in a little bit more and take a look at it before and after.
So this was before?
This is after.
This was only possible because of Photoshop and after Effects.
It was a little time consuming compared to our first method, which was to use Cordon Bleu in Premiere
Pro.
But the end result is a lot more clean compared to our first method.
You can also use this technique to get rid of people patterns on a wall, get rid of different spots
on a table, which is anything else.
With the help of after effects in Photoshop, you can just remove anything from a video.
So that was our second method of retouching skin.
And further lessons, we're going to take a look at other types of retouching and see how we can transform
the skin of our subjects and make them look better.
I hope you guys enjoy this lesson and I will see you in the next one.


### 3. Teeth Whitening

In this lesson, we're going to see how we can get lighter teeth inside.
Premiere Pro.
So we have one video left from our initial selection.
So in this video, we have this person revealing your teeth.
And if we were to use this video in, let's say, a dental commercial, we need to show that unrealistic
white and bright teeth.
So to do that, we're going to use the Excel secondary that we've used before.
But this time it's only focused on the color of the teeth.
So let's make a sequence from this clip.
Right click and choose new sequence from clip.
Call it teeth.
And there we go.
Let's choose the color workspace.
And then we'll have access to limited tricolour.
Over here.
We're going to open up each secondary and go to a frame where we can see her teeth fully on display.
So right here, we're going to grab the Eyedropper tool and choose the set color, which, like we said,
is supposed to be average range of colors rather than the brightest or the darkest bits.
For example, with the teeth.
We don't want to go for any shadows or any of the highlights, but rather an average color that is visible
in all of her teeth.
So that would be a yellowish color here.
Choose it once.
Check the color gray option.
And using these sliders, we're going to isolate her teeth alone.
Now.
It's okay.
If you brought in a bit of her lip.
We can always just mask out the effect.
But the most important thing is that you have all of the teeth visible within the selection.
And as for the teeth at the bottom, we don't want to really focus on that because they're already behind
the front row and there is some shadow casted on those bottom teeth.
So just focus on the front room.
I'm going to turn this back.
And just use the different sliders to grab mostly her teeth.
You can add to the selection or remove it by using the minus or the plus point to remove this pinkish
color that's on her lip and on her gum.
Since we're not trying to brighten up the gums and use the add to grab that shadowy area around our
teeth.
We ended up bringing some of her skin, but this is rather easy to mask out.
So once I have this, I'm just going to increase the blurriness for the edges and noise them a bit so
that the transition from the whitened teeth to the gum won't be that sharp and noticeable.
Uncheck your colored gray.
Once you're done, then scroll down and remove the saturation.
So once we remove the saturation, you can see that we're taking away from that yellow.
You don't want to go all the way or else you're going to get something like this, but rather a slight
movement towards the left.
We also want to cancel out the yellow by introducing some blue using the temperature slider.
So there we go already.
This is looking a lot wider than it did before.
This is without Excel secondary, this is with it.
So there is quite a lot of difference.
Next, we want to increase the correction slider towards just bring it up so that it becomes brighter
and more pearly.
Looking good.
If you notice that you're getting chunks of color like this, then you can just go back to your color
gray.
Add to the selection by pressing that tiny area.
That way you can have all of her teeth.
I think I missed a little bit down there.
There we go.
So just keep going back and forth until you have the right selection for her teeth.
Mine is looking pretty good, so I'm just going to leave it right here.
Now go into your effects controls on the same layer.
Just going to hit em on this frame.
Select the timeline, hit em so I know exactly where I want my mask to begin.
Grab your video, then depend tool on little metric color and just circle around her teeth.
Make sure that you do not get her skin tone, because that was the area that we brought in during the
selection.
Selected like So please, if you have to, then be sure to feather out your mask by, let's say, ten
or 15.
And now we can begin tracking forward then backward.
So track forwards first.
Go back to your marker and then track backward.
Once we're done tracking, we have the subject with pearly white teeth.
Let's take a look at a before and after.
This is the four.
This is after.
So we got that really shiny looking teeth for the subject.
And it's looking pretty natural because of the blurring that we did.
You can always go back on your layer and increase the amount.
If you solve that, the edges are just not as soft.
Just change that right here.
So this can be applied to any other instances.
Just make sure that your masking and tracking is right or else you're going to reveal this bright and
desaturated effect onto her lips and her skin.
So this is the end of our lesson.
It was a really simple technique that you can use on your videos to give your subject pearly white teeth.
I'll see you guys in the next lesson where we take a look at some other effects that you can do with
Premiere Pro.


### 4. Removing People From Clips

In today's lesson, we're going to learn about different techniques that can help us remove subjects
from videos.
So let's get started.
We're going to begin with the easiest method and in progress into more advanced method.
And by the end of this lesson, you will have some options that you can use to remove subjects from
your clips.
For the first example, we have this really simple clip.
It's shot on a tripod.
And what I'm trying to do is to get rid of this boat and just have the landscape.
So this is the easiest method.
You're just using Premiere Pro without the help of After Effects or Photoshop.
So let's make a sequence from this video.
Don't need the audio.
Hold down option, select it and then delete it.
So what we want to do is to duplicate this by holding down option or alt clicking and then dragging
it above the original clip.
You can also hold down shift while you're doing this so that you don't move it into a different frame.
Let go once you're finished.
And now on the top layer, we're going to mask that subject.
So let's zoom in into our video right on that subject that we want to get rid of.
You can start anywhere in the video because the footage was shot on a tripod.
I don't really need to start from the middle.
But if let's say your subject was turning around, you would want to start on the frame where the boat
is straight ahead and not tilted.
I will start at the beginning of the video.
Go to the effect controls for this clip.
Under opacity, you can grab the pencil or the Ellipse mask, grab the pen tool and begin masking around
your subject.
Be sure to leave enough room between the subject and the edge of your mask because we're going to feather
this out to.
Once you have your mask, just increase the mask whether.
To around 25, make sure that the feathered edge does not go over your subject.
You can always move your mask around to point.
And the whole mask itself.
We want enough room between the mask feathering and the subject.
So when I hide the first layer, you can see that we only have the subject selected in the second layer.
But now we want to invert this mask so that we get everything but our selection.
When I bring back the first layer, nothing looks different.
But now if I grab my first layer, use position X and Y to just go over to a different part of the video.
We now have gotten rid of that subject.
You can use position X and Y and find the perfect spot.
For your video.
Sometimes you may have to go back to your mask and perhaps add or remove from the feather.
So in my case, I had to add, and now it's looking pretty natural.
The subject is no longer seen.
But now we need to kind of track this mask because the subject does move.
You don't actually need to track it like this because the subject is moving in one line and the movement
is in that exaggerated.
So just grab your mask, toggle on the animation, move forward in time, and when the subject is revealed,
we just want to kind of pull this mask over that subject.
So I made this many keyframes.
If I pull this.
You can see that I made a few.
And now the subject is completely hidden in our clip.
You may also want to create keyframes for your bottom video.
Because at certain times the lighting changes and the video currently set towards the side.
So just go to your first frame.
Make a key frame for position on the bottom video.
And when you get an outline like this, just use position X or Y.
To just pull the video where it needs to be.
Trying to achieve a softer look for that key frame.
So now we got rid of that subject completely using Premiere Pro alone.
Now let's take a look at another example where things can get a little bit more difficult.
In the second example, we have a lot of people just walking around.
And we want to get rid of this group of people just to make this whole video look busy and less distracting.
So for this example, we're going to need the help of after Effects because one camera is moving to
there are patterns on the floor.
We can see these lines going around.
And three, we have one of the people coming close contact with that group.
But notice how they're not overlapping.
That's really important.
If this person was covering one of these people, then we will not be able to do this so easily.
So let's make a new sequence from this clip.
And we're going to duplicate this again by holding down option or alt right.
Click on the top one replace with the after effects composition.
It's going to open up after effects.
Once you have this opened and after Effects, we're going to just skip through and find how much of
this video we need.
So I will start mine around here since this content aware rendering may take some time depending on
your computer.
I want to keep this short so that we don't spend too much time waiting for this to render it end right
click trim Come to work area.
So we're going to grab the pen to zoom right in into the subjects.
Use your scroll wheel, hold down space to go right on that area.
So skim through and find that subject that comes in close contact right here and begin making your mask
on this frame.
If these subjects have shadows, you want to include that as well.
So for me, there's this little shadow casted.
I want to include that in my selection.
Once we have this, we're going to hit em on a video to reveal the mast properties.
Hit em twice, actually.
And what we want to do is to change the mode from add to subtract, because we want to keep everything
but the selection.
Now we're going to make sure that the mask stays around the subject.
You can use mask path, key frames or track it.
But but my subject stayed within that selection at all times, so there's no need for me to track it.
But let's say if you wanted to remove someone that is moving, then you would want to track the mask
either manually or just track the mask by right clicking.
So let's further out the edges right here by increasing the pixels again, making sure that nothing
goes in contact with any of the people out there.
Once we have this, we can open up the content aware fill window, which you can find up here.
Just click on it once and it's going to show up over here.
We want to change the film method to object lighting correction.
You want to keep it on.
I will stick with moderate because there isn't that much of a change.
And then keep the range to work area.
So I will go back.
To the beginning, you can see that this small bit is being revealed.
Okay.
Once you have everything set, we can now generate fill layer.
It's going to analyze your clip and then render.
So depending on your computer, it may take a long time or a short time.
So this is what it looks like for me.
You can see that it removed.
The people, but at the same time, it ended up distorting the floor.
So this is where the Photoshop reference frame comes in handy because after effects may not keep these
patterns in mind.
So what we want to do is to delete this film layer.
And instead create a reference frame.
Just click on this once it opens Photoshop.
But before that, let's just turn the mask mode into none.
So we have something to look at.
Then I can delete this.
And create another reference frame.
So if I have the mask mutants and subtract, then I can't really see what I'm getting rid of.
So that's why we need to turn it back into none.
Use your scroll wheel to zoom in right on those people.
And like the previous lesson, you can use any method that you prefer.
I will begin with a simple cloning because we do have these patterns that we need to keep when we cover
up the selection.
So let's choose a decent size.
Make sure that your hardness is low so we get a softer edge.
Use your left and right bracket to change the size of your brush.
Hold down option or alt and begin with one set of these lines.
So try to keep your brush on top of one of these lines, but within the sidelines.
So grab one right here and begin covering up your subject, saying we need to increase our hardness
a bit.
Sample the intersection right here and then bring it down.
Then slowly make your way lower until you reach the bottom right here.
Then we just need to grab the intersection again.
And make your stamp this time going upwards.
So it's a really simple process.
You can see that we get rid of the person's head and because we have these geometric patterns in our
video, it's really easy to remove it using Photoshop.
So just keep doing this until you got rid of your subjects.
You can also use other methods such as Content Aware Fill, which is in Photoshop.
We'll just show you what that looks like, but you will still need to use the clone tool to repeat these
patterns selected with the lasso tool and then right click content aware fill.
It's going to open up this window and you can show the sampling area.
So by default it samples everything but the subjects, which is actually what we want.
But as you can see, does kind of give us a distorted result, just like After Effects did.
So you can use this to kind of get rid of the height of the people and then go over it with the stamp
tool or just begin with the stamp tool from the beginning.
There's also the Patch tool and many other methods out there in Photoshop for you to cover something
up.
So use your favorite method.
And if you're new to Photoshop, then I think you can just use the clone stamp tool.
To just cover up your subject.
So I'm going to do this real quick and then I'll be right back.
So I use the Clone stamp tool and some adjustment layers to get rid of those people.
Once you're done, hit command se for control as on windows, go back to after Effects and now you've
got yourself a good reference frame.
This is going to help after Effects figure out exactly what the pattern needs to look like when they
remove the people.
So grab your video, turn this back to subtract, bring this below and begin generating that fill layer.
It's going to take a while, depending on your computer and how long your video is.
Because mine is only 4 seconds.
It was rather quick.
So now we have.
Removed those people.
So this was our second method, just like the previous lesson.
The method where you use Photoshop and after effects will give you a cleaner result.
Once you're done, hit command as and after effects.
Now we can go back to your premium pro to get the video.
This was before.
This is after.
So it's quite different.
So those are two ways that you can use to remove people from videos.
The less complicated the video is, the easier it is to remove those people.
But if you've got patterns or just more detailed backgrounds and you can just use the help of after
effects in Photoshop to create that reference layer and fill layer.
I hope you guys enjoyed this lesson and I will see you in the next one.


### 5. Stabilizing Videos

In today's lesson, we're going to take a look at different ways that we can stabilize a shaky footage.
So let's get started.
I've got three different situations, and for each of these videos, we're going to use a different
technique.
So one will be easy.
The second will be moderate and the final will be a little complicated.
So let's begin with the easiest one, which is basically a video that you have a shot handheld.
Just take a look at this video.
I'm going to drag it into my timeline, play it back.
And as you can see, the camera is shaking because the video was shot handheld.
So this is a pretty common situation and it could be better or worse.
But with a simple warp stabilizer, we can stabilize the footage.
So it's as easy as grabbing the stabilizer from the effects panel, dragging it onto your shaky clip,
having it analyzed, which will take some time, depending on how long your clip is.
And then you're basically ready to go.
It's going to stabilize now.
And when they play it back, normally you can see that it's not as shaky.
Now, if the result isn't what you're looking for, you can take a look at some options in the effect
controls underneath warp stabilizer in the effects controls.
You also have some options to adjust the stabilization for the result.
It should be on smooth motion.
Basically, it means that Premiere Pro is going to use the necessary methods to give your video a smooth
motion.
So it's going to create motion itself to make it look like this video is stabilized.
Now, the type of motion depends on DX method.
We have subspace, warp perspective, position, scale and rotation or just position.
For me, it's on the last option.
Basically, it's kind of like warping the footage.
You can see it's kind of like wobbly.
And that's the method that Premium Pro is using to stabilize my footage.
But I can ask it to just maybe use perspective.
It's going to stabilize again, and it's just going to use these sharp turns to make my video look more
smooth.
Now, the method entirely depends on the type of footage that you have.
So based on the result that you see here, you would want to choose a different method.
With position scale and rotation Premiere Pro will transform your clip.
Zoom in, move it to the left and right to stabilize your footage.
So when I played this back, you can see that it's kind of shaky because the method is not suitable.
So always preview your video after choosing a method to make sure that it's suitable for your clip.
And finally, we have just position.
This is not the best option for my example.
You can see that it's almost more shaky now due to the wrong method.
So Subspace warp is the best method for my clip.
So when I play this back with the subspace warp, it's going to give me the best result.
And if I were to stabilize my footage, the subspace warp method is the best for me.
Now let's take a look at another example which uses the same technique, but the method may differ.
Make a new sequence.
And this is the video that we have.
So you can see there isn't that much shake, but I can kind of have the video be stabilized based off
my subject.
So grab the warp stabilizer effect on your video and it's going to analyze your clip.
We got rid of this light shaking the background and in the effect controls, we can try different results.
So if I put it on no motion, I can see that it kind of zoomed in.
Can also noticed a warp from the method.
So I bring this forward.
You can see that the background is kind of expanding.
And that's because of our method.
But if I change this to position scale in rotation, we're going to get a different result.
Now it's kind of bouncing up and down.
Try a prospective method and I will get something that's a little bit more shaky.
Virtue's position.
I will get a really stiff movement for my video.
Sometimes you're trying to get rid of shake within a video.
Other times you want to add shake to a clip.
So maybe you're trying to make a tripod shot look more like a handheld shot.
So this is where the different methods will come in handy.
So this was the technique in Premiere Pro.
Now, let's take a look at our second technique with a different video.
So this is my second video going to view it Here we have someone dribbling on a ball and I just want
to make the focus of the video on the ball.
To basically have the victim move with the bouncing that is happening.
And we can do that by using after effects.
Make a sequence from your clip.
We can delete the previous sequence when I really need them.
So duplicate your clip and place it right above.
This way we can see it before and after once we're finished.
Right click on the top layer and replace with after effects composition.
Move into the tracker panel, which you can bring in right here and choose the stabilized motion option.
It's going to give you a little box before positioning the box over the ball.
Just go through and find a part where.
The ball is in focus, but it's away from the person's hand.
So right on this frame, I'm going to grab the box.
Set the point on maybe one of these lines.
Then position the box so that it's perfectly fit for the ball.
There we go.
Now I'm just going to make sure that position is the only option that's turned on.
Go to options and enable these stop tracking in the dropdown menu.
The reason we're doing this is because sometimes after effect loses sight of that point and we'll start
creating random keyframes in order to avoid those random key frames.
We're going to ask the program to stop tracking when it's confused.
So by default it should be on a depth feature, but just put it on.
Stop tracking so we can avoid.
Fixing those key frames as much as possible.
Okay, once you're finished and then we're going to track forward, jump back to this point, which
you can just put a marker on by grabbing this guy here.
And then track backwards.
So hit, analyze, forward.
And just wait for after Effects to stop tracking on its own.
If it does not stop, then just let it go.
That just means that After Effects does have that point in sight at all times.
So, so far it hasn't stopped and the box is nicely fit on top of the basketball to let it do its thing.
And then I'll be right back so we can continue.
So it stopped tracking here.
Just grab the box and reposition it on another point.
So that it's not confused.
Ventures analyze forward.
At around this point, it's going to stop tracking and we don't really need the rest of the video.
So it's fine.
Then just go to your marker.
Click on it once and we're going to track backwards.
From this point.
So if your box is nicely fit for your object, you should have no problems and the chances of it stopping
will be low.
There we go.
I have all of these tracking points.
And now we're going to send the tracking data onto the video itself.
So your target should be your video since you wouldn't have any other layers.
Then just hit apply to push this data onto the video.
When I play this back, you can see that it's stabilized.
But we're getting these black bars because After Effects is moving the video itself.
So it's an easy fix when it comes to this.
Just hit s on your video.
Zoom right in and then use position to just.
Put it where it needs to be.
Comb through your footage and make sure that you do not reveal the edges.
So zoom in as much as you'd need to.
You can also zoom out at like 25% and make sure that the video frame does not get revealed.
When you're done, hit command se and go back to your premiere pro.
So now we have this interesting stabilization method for this ball.
And once you have it in Premiere Pro, you can just maybe do some color grading, put some music, put
the rest of your clips in and you're ready to go.
Now let's take a look at our third technique, which involves 3D cameras.
So the third we do is, I believe.
This one.
Basically, in this video, we make a sequence real quick.
We just have someone walking, but it's been shot handheld and there's a lot of shake.
So instead of using Premiere Pro's more stabilizer or the technique that we just saw, I will be using
these 3D camera technique.
So duplicate your clip for reference.
Right click on the top one.
Replace with after effects composition.
Zoom right in here.
And now the process is the same, which is going to use track motion instead of stabilized motion.
Click on this once you're going to get the same track points and this time I will be using something
that has a lot of contrast on our subject.
So let's start at the beginning.
Grab the checkpoints.
Make them bigger.
Zoom right in, and maybe I can use one of his rings or his eye to just track everything.
Think I will use one of his rings?
Put these small box right around those rings and the big box around the ear.
So you're telling after Effects to look for the ring within this area.
Now we're just going to create a new null object.
Go back to the video and choose the transform option, then track forward.
So it stopped tracking because of our option.
If I go back, I can see the reason why it kind of loses sight of the earring early on so we can actually
reset this and try something else maybe his eye will give us.
A better result.
Put that right there.
Use the bigger box to just.
Make the selection more suitable and soon write in.
Do this.
Let's attempt to analyze this.
You can see now it doesn't stop as much.
And we only stop because, well, he closes his eye.
So let's make a marker right here.
Find an area where he opens his eye, which should be here.
Put another marker.
Then grab this box, pull it back on his eye.
Analyze forward again.
It stops.
Make a marker.
Could you where he opens his I push this guy back.
Then analyze forward.
So keep doing this until you have all of the frames analyzed.
I'm going to stop my video right here.
But if something does cover the eye or if the subject just closes their eye, you can stop tracking,
put a marker, continue tracking from the frame where everything is good, and then we can just come
back to these later.
It's just going to hit end right here.
And shrimp comp go back to my markers so I can show you what you're supposed to do.
During these times.
So go back to marker one where we had the first pause.
And what you want to do is to just position these key frames on the correct area.
So go to the next frame.
It's on the eyebrow.
Just pull it down.
And then right here, we're going to use the analyze one frame forward option instead of the normal
button so that we can check each of the frames between marker one and marker two.
It's looking good so far.
Just keep going.
And once we're at marker two, we don't really need to do this.
Let's go to marker three.
Actually, it needs to be here.
Let's pull this guy back.
Use markers.
Three Analyze forward one frame, make sure that it's set on the eyeball and not anywhere else.
Looking good so far, and I think the rest is good to go.
So once I have this, I just want to check my keyframes real quick.
Go and frame by frame.
Sometimes there may be a key frame that's not where it's supposed to be.
So I'm just going to analyze and if needed, just move these key frames back on the eye.
You can also move in frame by frame by holding down command and pressing the right area key.
That's control, right, Eric on windows.
So keep moving frame by frame.
And if at any point a key frame is not suitable, then just move it around.
I'm going to modify the key frames and then I'll be right back.
So I modified my key frames and now everything is looking good.
Now we're going to edit Target, set it onto our null object and hit reply.
So now the knowledge is stuck to that eyeball at all times.
But now we want the video to move with the keyframes because right now it's looking pretty normal.
So we're just going to create a new camera layer.
Hindu king.
And now we need to connect the camera to the null one.
When I play this back, you can see that the video is kind of moving by itself.
And we need to just transform this so that it stays within decomposition frame.
So just grab the original clip use position.
And scale to one, make it really big.
And to avoid getting blackboards at the edge of our frame.
So there we go.
Now, we're not getting those blackboards and everything is within the composition frame.
Once you're done, you can hit command s on your keyboard.
Go back to your premiere pro and do the rest of your editing.
But this was our final technique for stabilizing video.
Now that you know all three of these techniques, you can choose the right one for your video and have
a less shaky footage.
I hope you guys enjoyed this lesson and I will see you in the next one.


### 6. Noise & Grain

In today's lesson, we're going to see how we can remove noise from our clips and then add it on for
creative purposes.
Let's begin by learning how to voice our videos in Premiere Pro.
So sometimes you may not be careful with your camera settings and you end up bringing some noise into
your clips.
This happens when your ISO is way too high and you do not have the right shutter speed.
So in this example, we have a lot of noise.
If I assume right in, you can see all these little dots around my subject's hand.
So these little dots are called noise and it's pretty common to have them in your videos.
But there is simple fixes in post-production, so there's no need to panic.
First, we're going to learn how to remove noise.
Then after we're going to learn how to add noise in green to make a video look like it was shot on a
film camera.
This clip is in your resource pack.
Just make a sequence from it and we can begin working with the way it looks.
Duplicate your video so we can have one for reference.
Then look for the DX noise option in the immersive video folder.
This effect is initially made for VR videos, but you can also use it for clips like this.
So it's not only limited to VR at this onto your video.
And immediately you can see the difference.
This is before.
This is after.
Kind of softened everything out and actually ended up making the subject's hands look like watercolor
drawings.
So this is before.
This is after.
So this is kind of what we want.
We want to smooth things out, but not to the point where there is no detail on our subject's hand.
So go to the effect, controls it down to the ordinary section.
Have the noise type set on random valued.
And reduce the noise level.
So by default it should be on point 20.
But this is way too much, as you can see.
So go for 0.08 or a very small number.
So even with this small number, we're still getting a pretty good result.
This is without noise.
This is with the noise.
We can go even further.
And to something less than 0.08 Strive five.
And I think that looks better.
So we get rid of the noise, but it's still looking a little grainy.
So we're just going to head over to the color workspace.
And by using the color sliders, we can kind of hide the fact that this video has some noise.
Begin in the basic correction section and increase your contrast.
Then we're going to lighten up those shadows.
And increase those highlights.
So let's zoom in and slowly we're going to hide those little dots that were all around our video.
This was before.
This is after.
So it's a really simple color change.
You can take it a step further and maybe reduce your exposure.
And now I got myself a completely different footage.
This was before.
This is after.
Take a look at this up close.
This is before.
This is after.
So it's a really important step that you need to take in times where you shot with the wrong camera
settings.
Now, apart from Premiere Pro, there are some plug ins that can just get rid of the noise with a single
click.
Most of them are paid, so usually this DX noise effect is the best option.
But if you saw that this is not doing it for you and you need more of a noise effect, then you can
just go ahead and get those plug ins.
So if you search this on Google, you're going to get this page.
If you go to video enhance I one of the things that it does is that it removes the noise so you can
see can also upscale your video.
So it is a bit pricey but it does a really good job at removing the noise and upscaling your video from
SD to HD HD to 4K or a game.
So it's powered by AI and I would say it's totally worth the amount that you're paying.
But if you don't want to spend money on these plug ins and you can just stick with the premiere pro
DX noise effect.
So that was how we can remove noise.
Now let's see how we can add noise for creative purposes.
Let's go back to the editing workspace.
And take a look at our second video.
I'm going to just make a new sequence here.
We have a vertical shot in black and white of this, two people just having fun with their photography.
So what we're going to do is to not only add noise, but you add on some overlays that can make this
look like a Super eight film camera.
So let's begin by duplicating this, bringing this above.
Go to the effects menu and look for the and look for the noise eagles in the obsolete folder at this.
On to your clip.
Go to the effect controls.
It helps to zoom in onto your subject so you know how much of noise you need to add on.
Just go back here to a scene where.
She is in focus.
You use my scroll wheel until I am on the right frame.
Now head down to the noise atlas on the controls and we get some different noise options.
The first one is uniform, which means that you're going to have a pretty routine noise particles on
your video.
This is the default option, but there's also squared.
And grain.
So depending on what you're looking for, you would want to choose a different noise type, work with
the settings and see which one is best for your clip.
I personally like grain because it gives me more of a random look and it makes it look closer to the
film.
Eight Camera, which by the way, is a camera by Kodak that's that looks like this.
It's a pretty popular camera and the footage looks pretty vintage, as you can see.
So what we're trying to do in this lesson is to take that video and make it look pretty vintage.
So the first thing we need is some noise.
Let's choose the great option.
Come down to the light down here and increase the light amount.
The more I increase, the more of these little dots I will get on my clip.
So let's go for around 10%.
And now we're getting these grain on top of our clip.
You can take it a step further by working with the saturation, which can add those RGB colors.
That is pretty common with colored clips.
But because mine is black and white, there's no point in me having saturation on.
But if your video had color, then I would recommend adding maybe 20 or 30% off the saturation slider.
Next, we have the grain size, which is the size of these little particles.
If you increase it, you're going to get something like this that doesn't look that nice.
So I would just keep it at the default, which is one you want those tiny grains all over your subject.
We also have noise phase, which is the placement of these noise around your clip.
So if you want this to move the noise to kind of move around, which could add a nice artistic flair,
then you would want to go at the beginning of your timeline, toggle the animation for noise phase,
go to the end.
And add to the degree you can go further and make it do a full cycle.
So this is the amount I kept seven times 78.1 degrees.
Let's zoom out.
And now we've got a nice screen for our video.
Maybe 20% for lightness, just because I can't really see those grains once I have my grain, I'm just
going to add on the overlays that are also in your resource pack.
And these overlays are going to make this look more like the camera that we just saw.
So the first one is actually named after the camera.
It's going to give you this frame.
Which is perfectly made for this vintage look.
So grab this right above your clip.
Select the overlay and use the scale, rotation and position to just make it fit for your video.
Once I have this, I can now change the blending mode into darken.
And this is going to give my video a vintage look to it.
You can see that the frame is shaking.
We've got some noise and we have this pretty nice frame going to trim the end here, then put on a film
damage, which is just going to make everything perfect.
Again, we're going to have to scale and rotate this and then we can just change the blending mode to
screen.
Play this back and now we get these lines going across our video.
If you don't want this bluish yellow tint, you can just go on your first overlay, head down to the
color workspace and just remove the saturation completely.
So it's going to remove that yellow hue and leave you with a fully black and white clip.
But if you want the color, you can just increase the saturation and get a more classic look to your
video.
You can even enhance the video itself by adding some color to these shadows, mid tones and highlights.
You can give it a light red color to the shadows.
As for highlights, we can choose a warm color.
One that is less intense, of course, and a mid tones, I think I'll just add a slight red.
So now I took it away from looking black and white and gave the video a nice vintage look.
It also helps you go to the creative section and increase the amount for faded film, because usually
those old cameras don't have that much of a contrast.
So you want to mimic that by increasing the faded film slider.
In a further lesson, we're going to see how we can make a video vintage.
I'm not going to get into details right now, but there's going to be a separate lesson dedicated for
this video style.
You can also increase the sharpen slider.
To again bring out the rough edges of the video and make this look more like a film.
Increase that.
Add some Whitney as well.
Bring it towards the left.
It's going to give you these darkened edges and you can adjust the shape by reducing the roundness.
Let's adjust the midpoint.
And make this look more vintage.
So now we're done with the effect.
We solve first how to remove noise and then secondly, how to add noise to a clip.
So you're going to be dealing with noise a lot in post-production.
And depending on how bad the noise is, you would either use Premiere Pro's a built in plug in, or
just buy a plug in from the internet.
You can check out the website that I showed you earlier and find the best software that can help you
with your needs.
I hope you guys enjoyed this lesson and I will see you in the next one.


### 7. Enhancing Colors in Videos

#### P1
Color is one of the most important things in video.
And in today's lesson, we're going to see how we can enhance the colors that we got in our camera and
make the video look more alive with the proper settings.
So let's get started.
We're going to begin with some landscape shots, meaning that we're going to be focused on nature and
other objects.
Then later on we're going to progress into portraits and see how we can enhance the colors on a human
subject.
So you got four videos in your resource pack, bring them into your project.
And we're going to begin with one of the landscape shots.
So here someone is just walking in a forest and here the coloring isn't quite right because we got some
fog in the background.
The person is walking really slowly.
So the goal of this video is to create a mysterious setting, but because of the colors, we're not
really getting that setting.
So what we want to do is to just add some contrast, change the colors in there, make the greens more
vibrant, and just create the right setting for this video.
Duplicate your clip with the option or alt.
Then go to the color workspace.
Do your edits on the top video.
Leaving the bottom one for reference.
So first, when it comes to color, you want to make sure that you have the right lighting, because
without light we can't really see colour.
So it's really important that your exposure is right, your shadows contrast and all that so that we
can actually see what colours we're dealing with before moving on to working with them.
So for exposure, the video has a pretty good exposure, but I just want to lower that to create that
mysterious mood that I want contrast.
We want to increase that quite a bit.
Highlights, we can decrease it.
So I get more of those.
Shadows.
Dark in the shadows, of course.
Lower the whites and we can maybe darken the blacks.
So already with basic correction alone, we darkened the clip to create that mysterious mood.
Now onto the colors, which needs to be done after your basic correction.
We're going to first increase the vibrance.
So already you can see that we just bring it here.
We brought in some of the blue and green that was already in the video, so I didn't add any tents yet.
And just by using the vibrant slider, I brought out some of the colors that the camera got.
Once you get your vibrance set, you can increase the saturation if necessary.
Increase your sharpness if necessary.
And now we can move on to the curve section and work with the different RGV curves.
So we get the red channel, green Channel, blue Channel and the Archer curve.
So I'm just going to use this to create an SX curve for this clip.
This is what an S-curve looks like, by the way.
You can see that it kind of looks like a nice.
That's where it gets its name from.
You go 1.4 shadows, mid tones and highlights, and that is what creates that S-curve.
All right.
If you saw that your video is way too blue or way too green, you can use the suitable channel to just
remove from that color.
So the video is a little green.
And I want to reduce that amount by adding the color opposite to green, which is magenta.
So just grab the shadows down towards the bottom and you can see that I'm adding more magenta just by
bringing this down.
So here's a magenta, Here's a green.
If I wanted to add more to the green, I would just have to pull it up.
Do the same for blue.
The opposite of blue is yellow.
So when you pull the points down, you're adding more yellow to the highlights in my case, and that
way I can reduce some of that blue.
So this is without the curves.
This is with the curves.
So it's an important change.
So now to enhance those greens, which we already did by working with the following panels, but you
can use the secondary if your greens are not popping out as much or if your blues are just not there.
So we already know how to use this.
Just grab your eyedropper tool, select the colour that you want to work with.
Think I will go with one of those greens in the back?
Isolate that colour by using the sliders.
And then onto that selection, we can bring the colouring maybe towards the greener side.
Can I make mine a little green?
And dark in those areas.
Looking good so far.
Then come up to the basic correction section and add some blue to the temperature.
Then I'll add a little bit of a green tint, maybe negative one, and then we're good to go.
So just by using the metric color panel, I was able to enhance the colors inside this video.
So let's take a look at it before and after.
So the blues are way more visible and so are the Greens.
So that's our first example.
Let's move on to the second one.
In the second example, we got some clouds, the sky and a lot more green.
So let's see how this works with this method.
So the first thing we want to do is to work with the basic correction, which is going to give us the
proper lighting in order to work with the colors later.
So I worked with my light settings.
You can also see it before here.
It's looking a lot less flat and I created some contrast.
Let's add a yellow temperature this time.
Head down to the creative section and begin with the colors.
First, let's sharpen this clip.
Increase the vibrance.
Add some of that green outs and then increase the saturation.
Pretty good.
Now for the highlights, which is the the sky and the clouds, we want to add a nice, refreshing blue.
So just go to highlight tint and drag the sky down towards the blue or side or shadows.
You can also add something thing.
I'll add a nice yellow tint balance the tints by grabbing the slider.
And there we go.
It's looking pretty different from what we had before.
Head down to curves and we can just finalize the way this looks, create your S-curve.
Then go into the different channels and balance the colors that are on your screen.
All right.
I just want to add some of that bluish tint to the sky before was looking pretty yellow.
I wanted to make it a little blue, so I added some blue to the highlights.
So this was the before?
This is after.
Just by using these sliders, I was able to bring out more of that green and the other colors that are
inside this landscape.
So that was our landscape examples.
But how does this work on portraits?
Because we got different features that cannot be enhanced globally.
#### P2
Let's make a sequence from our next clip and I can show you what I mean.
So here I have a portrait of someone just looking at the camera.
When I want to enhance the colors in this subject, things are going to be a lot different because I
cannot just increase the sliders globally due to the different parts of the face.
So when it comes to portraits, you want to use different techniques.
This sort of enhancement is used quite a lot in fashion videos.
So you still have to do your basic correction if needed.
You can work with the different sliders.
It's going to do that real quick.
So I'm done with my basic correction.
This is before.
This is after.
It's a really subtle change.
But now on to color.
So when we go to the creative section, we still have the same sliders.
But like we said, we have to do some additional things because this is a human face.
So for this example, I just want to make our eyes glow more.
Make her lip a different shade and just make this suitable for a fashion commercial.
So what we're going to do is to just create a new adjustment layer down to new item and choose an adjustment
layer.
And call this ice.
Bring this right above.
So on this eye layer, we're going to use the basic correction section and just increase the exposure.
Do the same thing for contrast.
And right now, the video looks way too bright.
But we're going to mask this and put it only on her eyes so the rest of her face will remain normal
under just adjustment layer.
Go to the effects controls, then zoom in onto your subject.
More specifically, the eye.
Let's first see where we want to begin.
This mask.
Zoom right in on that eyeball.
Use the Ellipse mask to adjust.
Create a shape.
Around her iris hold down shift so it keeps you perfect circle and just make this as small as it needs
to be.
Now, you want to make it a little smaller than the actual I.
Because the feathering is going to kind of blend it into the rest of our eyeball, and that will give
you a more natural look.
So once I click away, I can see that we have added more light to our eyeball, and that's looking pretty
good.
But now we need to track this mask, so it just remains on her.
Iris.
Hit on your keyboard to create a marker right on the area.
That's you supposed to blink, track backwards, come back to this marker and then track forward until
the end of the video or when she just blinks again.
So I'm going to skip the tracking for now and just repeat this on her.
Either I hold down option or alt duplicate this and just move this on to the other side.
Go back to your marker, get the Ellipse tool and just position it on her eyeball.
So I got my two different mask on, both of her eyeballs.
Now let's take a look at how we can change or enhance the color of her lip.
Go back to the color workspace and using the Excel secondary, I can just isolate her lip color.
Let's just bring the two layers up and duplicate the video one more time.
The video that has the color adjustments and not the original.
You can just log the original so that you don't accidentally move it.
On the second duplicate, we're going to grab the key, sample her lips, and you're going to bring
in some of that skin tone.
But we're just going to remove that later.
So work with the sliders until you have isolated her lip alone.
So I went ahead and created these many keyframes for each of the eyes using the tracker when the subject
is blinking.
I created some mask opacity, keyframes, first one B 100, then zero when the eyes closed and then
100 again.
This continues until the last part of the video when she fully closes her eye.
As for the lib, I adjust that the sliders and got only her lib.
As you can see, we did get some of the areas on her face, but that's pretty easy to remove.
Once I had the selection of her lib, I went down here and added some red.
You can go for any other colour and you can use this lighter to either make it lighter or darker.
Just turn this off.
And just decide what shade of lipstick she has just by moving this slider and choosing the base color.
To only limited to her area.
We need to create a mask.
So go to a frame where you can see her lip and it's not covered.
Then grab the pen tool right here and just go around the lip area.
Once you're done with the mask, we're just going to feather it out.
Hit em to create another marker.
And based off this point, we're going to track backward, then forward.
So just track backward first.
Then go back to your marker, track forward, and then we'll be done with her lip.
And now the lip mask stays on top of her lip.
So we're done with this simple example.
But what if you want to take this further with changing the eye color of your subject so you could do
it in Premiere Pro with this method that we used instead of just increasing the exposure, you can just
head down to the colors in the creative tab and maybe make it red or just any other color.
But this method can be a little time consuming.
And when it comes to tracking, after effects just does a better job.
So for the second portrait example, we're going to use after Effects.
Make a new sequence.
Duplicate and then replace it with after effect composition.
Once you are in after effect, duplicate your clip by holding down command dx control dx on windows
and begin with looking for the perfect frame which is right around here.
So you want to start at a frame where the eye is fully open and preferably at a frame where the eye
is looking straight.
So I didn't take this frame because she's going to turn towards the camera.
So we're going to start tracking forward from this point and then backwards.
Let's mark this frame by grabbing a marker and begin by making a mask around the iris to zoom right
in, hold down the spacebar, to move the cameras around, then grab your tool of choice.
You could either use the pen tool to go around the eye or use a combination of the Ellipse tool and
the pen tool.
It's going to use this.
Make a mask inside the iris.
Click and drag to make curves.
Once I have this, I can just hit F on my duplicate layer that I'm just going to name color mask.
Further out your color mask by like ten pixels.
You can always come back to this.
Now, to change the eye colour, we're going to grab the hue and saturation effect.
The reason why we're not using colours because the eye is already bright and I just need to change the
hue of her iris.
But if her I was brown then I would have to use my true colour to first make the iris bright and then
colour to any colour that I want.
But we can skip the lightning step because this is already pretty bright.
Added on to your color mask using the master hue.
You can just change it to any color.
Then use mastered saturation and lightness to make this look more natural.
After putting the color in, you can adjust your feather.
And the mask expansion.
So hit em twice to open up everything.
Use mask expansion to just softly bring the colour towards the edge.
So now we got something like this.
And now to avoid the colour going on her pupil, we're going to minus from this color mask by simply
grabbing the ellipse tool, hold downshift, and just make that circle right in the middle.
Once you have this, we're going to change the mode of mass number two into subtract so the blue does
not go on top and we're just changing the color of the iris.
Of course, we need to feather and expand the edges, just like we did with Mask one.
And there you go.
Now it's looking quite nice.
All I have to do now is just track the movement so it does not fly around like this.
Start at the marker.
Grab your two mask.
Hold down command or control to grab more than one right click track mask.
Change the method to scale position and rotation and then track forward.
It's going to look weird at first, but once it's finished, it's going to go back to what it was.
So I'm going to let this track forward.
Then I'll come back to my marker track backwards, and then I'll be right back so we can continue.
So I tracked all of these frames right around here.
She's going to close our eye, and after Effects just created some random key frames, causing the color
to be far away from the iris.
So what you want to do is to make another marker on the last good frame.
And then go to the next area where her eye is fully open.
Make another marker.
So the markers are going to help you with knowing where you should begin tracking.
Of course, you can just not use them, but they can be pretty helpful.
Let's zoom in, grab our first mask, double click on one of the points.
And just pull it up towards the iris.
Second mass is way too big.
I'll downshift to scale it perfectly.
Once you're done, rescaling and repositioning your mask, we're going to track backwards from our third
marker until we reach the beginning of the video.
Again, we have the closed eye problem.
So let's begin making our mask path keyframes.
Go to frame word the eye is fully open.
Its on both of these mask layers.
Then we can just go on each of these key frames and alter their position.
So around here you can see that the eyelid is closing down.
Zoom in.
Therefore I can just grab one of these points and pull it down according to how close the eyelid is
coming down.
And do the same thing with the.
Pupil.
So you're just altering the key frames when it comes close to the blinking part.
When you're done with the key framing, you should have a nice blue eye for your subject.
I'm places where she closes her eye.
I also made mask capacity frames.
So here it's zero because the eye is closed.
100.
For the pupil, it's different because it gets revealed later on.
Again, we have another blink, so that's more opacity keyframes.
But now the colour is nicely fit inside your eyeball.
Even after tracking your mass, you can always go in and change the colour.
So it's not like a permanent thing and you have the freedom to change the colour whenever you want.
So that's how we can change eye colour using after effects.
The result is way more precise and premiere pro when it comes to tracking and you will just have an
easier time with key framing.
If you want this on both our eyes, you would have to repeat this whole process for her second eye.
But I'm not going to do that for this lesson.
Hold down commend as to save your project Control is on Windows.
Then go to Premiere Pro and enjoy your subjects.
Neil, I.
So this was before.
This is after.
So that was two ways that you can use to change your portrait videos.
Premiere Pro is an option on its own, but After Effects can help you get a more precise selection.
I hope you guys enjoyed this lesson and I will see you in the next one.


### 8. The Meaning of Colors

Going forward, we're going to be using colors to color our videos.
Before jumping into that, we need to know what each color means and what mood it creates for that clip.
Every color has its own meaning and they trigger different emotions in the audience.
Here.
I have some examples.
And for each of these examples there is a different type of acting.
And by putting different colors on this, we're going to transform the emotions that are being portrayed
in that video.
So apart from the acting, color plays a big role in the emotions that are taken away from your videos.
So let's begin with that first example.
I also have different color mats, which I just made by going into new item.
Color meant choosing my color here, hitting a K, giving it a name, and then saving it.
The first color we have is the color blue.
So blue on its own is a royal color.
And you can say that it's cold and calm.
It's used quite often in sad movies.
Whenever there is a sense of melancholy, they use a color blue because it triggers the right emotions.
So whether it's a war movie, a death scene, a sad conversation between two actors, the color blue
can help create that sad and cold emotion.
So what happens when I grab this blue color and bring it above this scene of these two actors hugging?
Want to use a simple blending mode.
To put this on top of my subject.
So right away you can see that the mood instantly changed.
A darkened first of all.
And we just made this scene look really sad.
So before this, we were just seeing two actors hugging.
We didn't know what was happening, what was the emotion portrayed here?
But the color blue can make this scene look sad.
So maybe the mother is saying goodbye to her daughter.
The daughter is leaving away.
And just by a simple blue overlay, we were able to portray that emotion.
So that's the color blue.
If you want to make something sad, cold, or make a person look alone, you would want to use the color
blue.
The next color is green.
Let's bring it right above.
Change the blending mode.
We're not really color grading here.
We're just putting this block of color above.
So with this color, we just created a dark and ominous mood for this video.
So green is usually associated with nature, but in movies, it can also suggest that there is some
darkness going on or some mystery and ominous mood.
And in our example, it looks like this person may be evil and she is maybe trapping the second person.
You may have also noticed in cartoons that the color green is associated with the villains, and that's
because it does create that scary and mysterious look.
It's also used quite often in horror films.
So usually in horror films, there's a combination of green and blue to make the video cold and then
make it scary.
So those two combine will perfectly set the mood for the audience.
We're going to talk about the topic in the next lesson and how by combining two colors or more, we
can create a certain mood.
So that's green.
Let's try this color on top of our second video.
So in our second video we do have a villain.
And when I put the green on top of it, you can see that it's completely different and she's beginning
to look more like a villain.
Of course, if we were actually color grading, we would have to darken the green.
But for now, you can see how it instantly changes the mood.
If we try blue, it's going to look really cold.
She's going to look really distant.
And when we combine the two, we're getting the perfect horror movie mood.
And the final member of the cult colors is the Color Purple.
Let's try to blend that in.
So the Color Purple is usually used in fantasy films, and it can transform your video into something
mystical and eternal.
The Color Purple is used a lot in movies like The Guardians of the Galaxy, Blade Runner and Star Wars.
Just movies where everything is full of fantasy and.
And the setting is in the future.
So let's try purple on this video.
And you can see how it again, completely changes the mood for the villain.
If you have neon objects in your videos, then you can pair it with the color purple to one, make those
neon colors pop and to create that fantasy mood that you're looking for.
So let's say I have this video and I created some sort of glowing eye effect for my subject.
I can just pair it with the Color Purple and my VFX is going to stand out a lot better.
So those three were a part of the cold color group.
And now let's jump into the warm color group, which is the opposite of the colors that we just saw.
So let's go into the project panel and begin with our first warm color.
That is the color orange.
Let's bring it right in.
So warm colors in general are associated with emotion, strong emotion specifically.
So usually in movies when there is a happy flashback, the color orange is used for color grading.
So not only does it make your video more warm, it makes it more friendly at times.
It can also make your video look more exotic.
I'm sure you've all seen the movie Mad Max.
The color orange is used quite often, and that's an example of how the color orange can be used to
create something exotic.
So if you're looking to make your video more friendly, more warm than you would want to add orange
to your color grading.
Next in our warm group is the color pink.
The color pink is usually associated with youth.
So in movies where they want to show an innocent character, the pink color really helps.
And it can also make your videos look more playful.
So an example of this would be the Grand Budapest Hotel.
The movie The Color Pink is used quite often to show playfulness and innocence for the characters.
So this is what it looks like on one of our examples.
Next, we have the color red.
This is used quite often as well.
Red is usually associated with love, violence at times and passion.
So on one side it can resemble love, passion and just really strong emotions.
On the other hand, it can show power, danger and violence.
So this is how the color red looks like in our example.
Can make this video look really passionate.
And on this video it can show a sense of danger.
So maybe this is a flashback of something that happened right before a dangerous event.
Finally on our list is the color yellow.
So the color yellow is usually associated with action.
You've probably seen it in movies like Kill Bill, Bruce Lee, Fast and Furious, or just any other
movie where there's a lot of action and violence.
The color yellow can also be used to portray obsession, jealousy and other emotions that are just not
that likable.
So now we know what each of these colors mean.
And in the next lesson, we're going to combine the colors to create certain moods.
Now, before we jump into the next lesson, I'm going to show you some examples of Hollywood films that
include these colors that we talked about.
So this is our first example for the color orange in the movie Mad Max.
There's a lot of action going on, and the movie is exotic.
It's shot in an unrealistic setting.
There's a lot that happens in that movie, of course, a lot of action, too.
And the color orange makes the movie really exciting and epic.
So the color orange is paired with this blue.
We're going to talk about color pairings in the next lesson.
But I just wanted to show you guys an example of how the color orange can be used on a video to show
exotic ness and just other emotions that we talked about.
In this case, it's just exotic and extreme, but in other cases it can be warm and friendly.
So in Harry Potter, there was this flashback of the mom.
Notice the color orange again, in this setting, the color orange was used to show something warm and
friendly, which was Harry's mother.
We have another scene here.
Then in another scene where something sad happens, they switch to the color blue.
So it's no longer orange, it's blue.
And this can trigger sad emotions in the audience because, well, someone died.
And the other character is crying.
So that's the orange color.
Now, let's take a look at the other movies.
Next, we have the color green, which, like we said, was used in a lot of horror movies.
And it's used in movies where there's a lot of nature.
So this movie is a perfect example.
You can see that the color palette includes a lot of greens and the setting is in nature.
So the color green in this sense is showing that darkness, mood, the ominous mood and of course the
nature all around.
The next color is red.
So in this movie, In The Mood for Love, there's a lot of love going on, a lot of passion, strong
emotions, and therefore the color red is used quite often.
We have a lot of warm colors in this movie.
Our next movie is a Grand Budapest hotel, which uses the color pink quite often.
So the color pink, like you said, shows innocence.
It shows sweetness, playfulness and all that.
And we can see how the use of the color pink can show us that emotion.
Another example of the use of color pink is with the artist Melanie Martinez.
She uses the color pink a lot to show that innocent and playful aesthetic that she has.
So if you want to make something look softer, more innocent, then you can use the color pink.
Our next item is the Color Purple.
It's used a lot in sci fi movies, especially ones related to technology.
So in this movie, Blade Runner 2049, there is a lot of purple used, especially in this scene.
And you can just use the Color Purple to show that fantasy futuristic look.
Our next movie is Interstellar.
In this movie, there's a lot going on, but nothing is exactly happy, warm and friendly.
So we're getting cold colors.
If we take a look at the color palette, we have different shades of blue that good mixed with other
neutral colors.
So in this movie, because everything is quite epic, there is a lot of blue used and the colors were
shifted towards colder tones.
So we got some blue here, some green, and we just barely have any warm tones.
Dunkirk is another good example of this.
We got a lot of cold colors again, some green, some blue.
We just get that warm tones from the human subjects.
Especially when there is a friendly interaction.
So if you want to make your videos look a bit more distance, a bit cold and a little bit more sad,
then you would want to use Blue as one of your main colours.
And our final colour is yellow.
The Lion King could be a good example of this.
We got a lot of yellow in this, especially with the characters that are warm and friendly.
So the main characters, they all have yellow.
But notice how the villain is a different colour.
So whenever he is plotting his evil plan, he is surrounded by the colour green.
That's because green can show that you are a dark person, you're the villain and there's some sort
of evil associated with this character.
But in other scenes there is the use of warmer colours.
So the colour yellow can also be associated with obsession and other times action.
So this movie is another good example of this, where the main character is always wearing yellow because
there's a lot of action and obsession with that character.
There's also the Bruce Lee movie and of course with Bruce Lee movies, we do have a lot of yellows because
like we said, it can show danger and action.
So those were some examples of these colours that we talked about within Hollywood films.
There are tons of other examples, but hopefully now you know what each one means and how adding these
colours to your videos can transform the emotion that the audience will take from it.
In the next lesson, we're going to talk about how we can use these colours either together or alone,
to create a certain mood for our videos.
I'll see you guys in D Next lesson.


### 9. Moods

Now that we know what each color means, it's now time to put them together to create different moods.
In this lesson, we have seven different moods that we're going to take a look at.
There's going to be more when we move forward.
But these are some basics that you should keep in mind when you're color grading your videos.
So let's get started.
Import all of your clips into your project and create different sequences.
I labeled mine according to the mood that I will be making for that video so that it's easier for me
to just go through each one.
Let's start with one of the basics, which is when you want to take a video of the fun event and you
want to make it memorable, maybe your client gave you some birthday videos and they want you to calibrate
it.
You've got to keep in mind that you're trying to make this video something memorable.
Therefore, you want to add some warm colors and make the video look really fun.
So as we know from the previous lesson, warm colors include yellow, orange, red and cold colors include
green, blue and purple.
Of course, there are more colors in between these, but those are the basics that you should know.
So let's begin by making this video more fun.
The video itself does have a lot of colors, but we're going to just pump up the warm colors and bring
out more of the vibrance that is already in that video.
Remember, when you want to make something fun and exciting, you want to add more light to that video
and bring out some of the colors that are already there.
So let's go to the basic correction and begin creating a fun mood for this video.
First, let's bring some light into this video.
Increase your exposure.
Then your contrast highlights.
I'm going to decrease it a bit, get those shadows going, decrease the blacks.
And increases whites.
It decreases shadow just by a bit.
Once we made everything a little brighter, we're then going to move into white balance.
So we want to add warm colors to this video, therefore adding a little bit of warm temperatures.
Going to keep that tone throughout the entire clip.
Add that on.
I'm going to skip the tent.
And now we're done with basic correction.
Let's move on to the creative tab and increase the vibrance of the video.
So when you're creating fun clips, especially in a setting like this, you want to think of fun places
like Disney World, Universal Studios, and any other place where you go to have fun.
So if you step into those locations, there's a lot of bright colors, lots of lights, and you just
want to recreate that setting inside your mood.
So by increasing the vibrance and the saturation, we're going to make those pinks, reds and all those
colors pop even more.
Sharp in the video.
So just by the basic correction tab alone, we completely transform the video to go to color wheels
and match.
So we're going to get these three wheels in the color wheel section.
By now.
You should know how to use them.
But here we're just going to use these wheels to apply a color combination.
So we want to add the colors that we mentioned, which was yellow and orange to the wheels that you
see right here.
So for shadows, we can just go for a nice yellow.
Just pull the sky towards the yellow side.
You don't want to go too intense because then it's going to look like they're in a really hot environment,
which is not the case.
So just drag this down to something like this.
And as for midterms, I'm going to make them orange.
So go towards the middle side again.
Not too much.
Just a tiny bit.
As for highlights, we can balance things out with the colour opposite to warm colours, which is a
nice blue.
The original combination is yellow and orange, which is adding this cold tone to balance the intense
yellow that we had before.
Once you have this, you can use the bar right here to work with the luminosity.
This is bright.
This is dark for me.
Tones, I'm going to bring it down a bit and dark in the shadows to creating contrast in the many items
that we have around.
As for highlights, I just want to increase it.
So now we have the tents.
This is before.
This is after.
You can see we took it away from that cold environment and added these warm colors to make this video
look more fun.
If needed, you can go to the Curves adjustment, create an S-curve.
And I'm just going to head back to the creative section, increase the vibrance, touch more, get the
exposure.
To be around six now for the sky because it's just a plain white surface.
I will use the secondary to just tone it down a bit and maybe add a different tint.
So let's grab the Eyedropper tool and sample this white color, Turn on color gray and you can see it
instantly selects the white bits.
First, let's blur the selection so the edges don't look that sharp.
Maybe we can add some tint.
So we used yellow and orange to make this video more fun.
So this was before.
This is after.
You can see we made the video more warm and brought out some of those colors.
Let's take a look at our next mood, which is going to be something different from this, and that is
fantasy.
So in this video, we have someone just sitting in a desert and you're looking pretty tense.
And I can use this video and make you look like maybe he's a villain.
He's an important character in a dangerous environment.
Let's head to the color workspace and we're going to go into basic correction one more time.
Unlike the fun video, we're not trying to make this video right, because this is a fantasy environment
and we want to make it look like a serious environment, too.
We need to actually kind of darken the video and create more shadows and contrast.
So for exposure, let's bring it down, increase that contrast, reduce those highlights, darken the
shadows, increase those whites.
In dark in those blacks.
He can go pretty back with the blacks.
Once you have your lighting, you can now add the cold temperature.
So this is not a warm memory, but a rather serious mood.
So we want to add a cool temperature.
As for tennis, we can just add maybe a little bit of green.
Just bring it towards the left.
And already this is looking pretty fantasy like.
This is before.
This is after.
We're not quite done with it, but so far it's looking pretty good.
Now let's head down to the creative section and maybe increase those vibrance and a little bit of that
saturation.
Now onto the color reels.
The combination that we're going to use for fantasy is a mixture of teal and orange.
Let's begin with the highlights and create that two color.
Grab this guy towards the bottom.
Something like that.
And for the midterms, we're going to make it Orange Shadows.
We can just.
Again.
Bring it towards the warmer side.
Maybe you can go for red.
So just pull it up there.
I also have face detection turned on.
So.
So it will not colorize these skin tones.
So now we added those two colors.
Of course, you can go further than this, but for my example, this is good.
Now use the sliders on the slide to work with the luminosity.
And there we go.
I can now go back to maybe the curves and just walk around with what I have.
So there is my fantasy mood that I created using the true color workspace.
Let's take a look at a before and after.
This is before.
This is after pretty easy.
And now this is the perfect fantasy environment for maybe a transformer car to appear or an alien to
show up.
So for fantasy, you want to use a combination of orange and teal to get something like this.
The next mood is sad.
I'm going to use this clip that we used before and the goal, which is to make the video really dark
and blue.
So let's begin by working with a basic correction and to go to a scene where both of these subjects
are there.
The video itself is already dark.
Remember that the lighting of the video when it was shot is also important.
So if you are shooting your own clips, you want to work with different angles of light in different
light intensities to a depot's production process.
So because this video is already dark and we're getting these harsh shadows, this will help me make
a pretty convincing set scene.
So I don't need to do much with the light section.
We can actually skip exposure and just work with the rest contrast.
Increase that dark in those shadows.
The more contrast, the better.
And for the whites, kind of increase it and darken those blacks for temperature.
Of course we want to make it cold.
And maybe a little bit of a magenta tint.
Now let's go to the creative section for sad movies.
There's actually not a lot of vibrant colors because things are not as lively as they usually are.
So you want to actually decrease the vibrance.
And a saturation not exactly black and white, but a kind of desaturated.
Look, we'll help you with that said feel.
Once you have your vibrant set, I will go to the color reels that begin the actual color combination.
So grab the mid tones towards the blue side.
Just pull it down like this.
And now we're getting a pretty sad look.
I don't need to do much with the highlights since we're not getting that much of them for shadows,
we can just pull it down towards.
Either the purple side or more blue.
It depends on your video, but for me, I think.
But for me, a little bit of purple is going to help make that video look more set.
Then just work with the different sliders for luminosity.
I'm just going to go back in basic correction and increase the blacks.
So there is my sad scene.
Let's take a look at it before and after, before, after.
So sad moods are desaturated, dark and blue.
So these combinations are going to make your video look more sad, more isolated and more cold.
So that's my sad mood.
Let's move on to the next one, which is scary.
So for this one, I just have a swing just rocking on its own and I want to make this look scary, mysterious,
and kind of make it look like something really big and gory is going to happen.
Let's say this is a scene from a horror movie.
Head down to basic correction and darken the entire clip by using these sliders available.
Once you have adjusted the lighting, we can now make the video cold and add a green tint.
You want to saturate the video too.
So this is similar to the sad mood.
The only difference is that we're adding green on top of that blue.
So it is dark, it is desaturated.
But when it comes to color wheels, we're actually adding green to the shadows.
So if there is nature in your video, you actually want to add more green and then just add some blue
to the midterms.
So it's a combination of green and blue that makes a video look more mysterious, scary and and frightening.
For highlights, you can just add a little bit of green.
Then just work with the following sliders.
So there is my scary scene.
It also helps to add a little bit of Winnie to the edges and just make this swing look really scary.
This is before.
This is after.
So this is our scary mood.
A combination of blue, green and dark.
Next is a tense mood.
Again, we have the same Sahara setting and we have some action going on.
So as you recall, yellow was the color for action.
And we're going to pair that with the color green.
So it's not teal.
Like the fantasy example we had, but just green.
Similar to the other examples you want to begin with Darkening the clip creating contrast.
Once you're done, we can add some yellow color.
And bring the tent towards the green side.
Now, this is similar to the fantasy example.
We do want the vibrance brought up and to saturation as well.
The only thing is in the color wheels where we add some green to the highlights.
And we're going to add some orange to the shadows, pair it with some red from the mid tones and you're
almost there.
To bring back some of my highlights.
And now we do have this blue color from the original video.
And I just want to turn that blue into something closer to green, and I can achieve that by using the
secondary.
Grab the color right there.
Check it with the color green and just increase the luminosity.
Blur the edges and the noise, the selection.
Now we can just add some of that grain, perhaps lower the saturation.
It was a bit too intense to bring this back.
Lower the saturation, add some green to there, add a little bit of yellow since that section of the
sky was already blue.
We're adding yellow temperature to make it green because blue and yellow makes green.
And just finish it off with a little bit of green tint.
So there's my tense movie scene.
I'm just going to go back once I have my colors and just create more contrast.
She knows to add a little bit of winning to make this more intense work with your curves and make it
perfect for your tense mood.
Depending on what you have in the video, you would want to balance the amount of green and orange.
Let's say if you had a forest in the video, then you would want more green than orange.
But here, since we had more sand, then we're adding more orange than green.
Let's take a look at our next example, which is playful.
So here I just have someone dancing.
And for playful videos, you want to increase the brightness.
So it's something like the fun mood that we did, that we did in the beginning.
But with playful videos, you want to add some pink, purple and red.
So these combinations are really helpful.
And before that we need to increase the lightness like we did in our fun mood.
So you want to increase those shadows, maybe lower those highlights If they're too much, decrease
those blacks.
And maybe decreases whites.
Less contrast is ideal.
So just with the basic correction alone, we brought out more of those colors.
Now down to the color wheels.
We're going to introduce the color pink to the combination.
So we're adding a combination of warm colors and two color pink.
So for shadows, let's add that pink color.
Just drag it right on highlights.
Let's add a warmer color like maybe red.
And we can balance things out with a little bit of cold for the midterms.
Another thing about these playful videos is that you want to create less contrast.
So just grab the contra slider towards the left in recreating a sort of faded film look.
To make this video look more playful, go to the curves adjustment.
Lift the shadows a bit.
If the colour is too much, you can just add a little bit of green because green cancels out magenta,
which is what we had here.
So we're not adding green ridges, canceling out the color that's already there.
Now I can just go back here and finish up my color wheels.
So now we use a combination of pink, purple and red and make the video more flat to create a playful
mood.
This is before.
This is after.
We have created a completely different mood.
Our final mood is futuristic.
Here I have a video that has some neon colors, and this is perfect for the mood that we're about to
create.
So for futuristic videos, you want to add the color purple and blue.
At the same time, you want to darken things because the parts are being futuristic.
It's also a serious scene and we already have this underground setting.
So we want to emphasize on the fact that this is underground and this is a futuristic setting.
Decrease your exposure.
Add contrast.
Increase highlights.
Darken the shadows.
Increase the whites.
Darken the blacks.
So with lighting alone we have created that contrast that futuristic reduce naturally have.
It decreases exposure at some blue temperature because this is not exactly a happy scene at some magenta
tent.
Then head down to creative and increase the vibrance.
So color is really important.
In futuristic videos, you want to increase the vibrance and saturation of whatever color you have,
especially if it's a neon color that we have because of this light.
Add to vibrance saturation and also applied some sharpness.
Then head down to colour wheels and we can begin with the combination that we talked about.
So for shadows, let's add some purple, bring this all the way towards the side.
And some blue for the midterms.
As for highlights, we can add a little bit of a pink since we have some pink going on.
Finish things off with the curves adjustment.
And we're finished with our futuristic mood.
This was before.
This is after.
We can again add a little bit of Whitney to bring emphasis on the subject.
If at any point you want to create those bars that are pretty common in cinematic movies, you can just
add the crop effect, add it onto your clip, then scroll down to remove maybe 10% from the top.
And 10% from the bottom.
And that's how you can create those cinematic bars.
You can repeat this for all the other moods, and if you want, you can even make it a square.
Something like the Zack Snyder film by adding a percentage to all four of these options.
So those were some examples of moods that require certain color combinations.
Going forward, you're going to have to use these color combinations to portray that emotion within
your video.
In further lessons.
We're going to take a look at more specific moves and how we can cull a grade to achieve that certain
style.
So I hope you guys enjoy this lesson and I will see you in the next one.


### 10. Color Match

Now you know the meaning of each color and how you can combine them to create certain moods.
So now the question is, where do you start and how do you choose the right color grading for your videos?
One way to practice color grading is by using popular films and taking the colors that was used in those
films and applying it to your own videos.
So in today's lesson, we're going to see how we can do that with the Color Match tool inside this program.
I have three examples for this lesson and three different movies in a series that we are going to use
and extract the colors from.
These are all in your resource bank.
What you want to do is to have snapshots of that frame that has the colors that you're looking for.
This is our first example.
This is our second example.
And finally, we have this series.
So I'm going to apply these same colors inside these movies to reduce that I have downloaded from the
Internet.
So this right now is pretty suitable for that Peaky Blinders colour grading.
And instead of just putting them side by side and trying to do it from scratch, I could just hit a
button and Premier Pro will do it for me.
Make a sequence from your clip.
I already did one right here.
And what we want to do is to have the clip on one side, the JPEG image on another.
So here I have the image.
Here's my video.
Just scale this up.
And now you want to bring your play ahead on your video selected.
Go to the color workspace underneath color wheels and match.
We're going to select comparison view.
So it's going to show you the reference right here and the current frame, which you can just change
by moving your head.
You can also choose a different views.
And once you have that, you're going to hit apply match.
So on its own, it does a pretty good job.
You can see that the video of mine does have that Peaky Blinder setting, but it could use some tweaking.
So this right here is good in terms of colour, but Peaky Blinders did have a lot more of a dark tone
to the scenes.
So once I have my color match, I can just go to basic correction and darken things up.
So we want less exposure, more contrast.
Darker shadows and brighter highlights.
So now I have myself a scene from Peaky Blinders just by using Color Match.
When we're done, we can just press this button to get out of comparison view and we can see our final
product.
So this was the before.
This is the after.
Let's take a look at another example.
I have my second video of this bright city landscape and I want to make it look like it's from the movie
Blade Runner.
Once again place the color and the video right next to each other.
It helps you scale things up.
Then go onto your video selected compares and view.
Come down to color wheels and apply match.
There you go.
So in this example, it didn't do that much of a good job.
So we're just going to have to do some tweaking ourselves.
Again, we need to darken things up, increase those highlights.
Quite a bit dark in the shadows.
Contrast.
Add more purple to the whole scene, more blue.
Now let's go to the color wheels and we can always change the points here so it's not exactly final
and you can just change it yourself.
So here is my video.
This was before.
This is after.
Let's take a look at our final example, which has more of a warmer tone.
I have a video that is perfectly fit for this color grading.
And we're just going to use this color grading like we did with the rest of the videos.
Pretty good.
Now, here it did add the colors that we were looking for, but it's looking a bit too sharp.
So head over to basic correction and make the video more flat.
We're also going to increase the vibrance.
This TV show in particular had a lot of vibrant color in it.
So we want to increase that.
Another thing that you can do once you have your color match is that you can grab the dropper tools
in the secondary and work with a certain color.
I'm going to grab this blue that's undercovered and turn it more towards the teal side.
Blur the edges.
And now in correction, we want to kind of bring it down towards the science side.
And to add some yellow temperature and a green tint to just make the color the way I want it to.
Now it has more of a green color then a head over to the curves.
You just make it look more like this snapshot that we have.
So now I saved myself the time of trying to match the colors from scratch by using the color Match feature
inside Premiere Pro.
Using this method, you can practice matching colors to your reference shots and it's helpful to do
this with your favorite films.
And that way you will know which sliders will be the most helpful in certain situations.
So I hope you guys enjoyed this short lesson.
It's really important to practice with the different color grading styles and find your own unique style
that you can use on your own clips.


### 11. Lens Correction

When you shoot a video with a drone or a GoPro, you will end up with a distorted fisheye effect.
This is pretty common in these cameras.
And in today's lesson, we're going to see how we can fix it in post-production.
So I have two examples for this lesson.
Just go ahead and import it into your project panel, then create sequences from each clip.
So take a look at what we have right now in the preview panel.
You can see that the horizon line is bent and we're just getting an overall circular effect.
This curvature effect in video is called the Fish Eye Effect.
Sometimes it is used to create some sort of artistic look.
It's used quite often in music videos, comedy clips and much more.
But other times it's the result of certain camera lenses and it's considered a distortion.
Some of you may be asking yourself, why is there a distortion in the first place?
And is it possible to just not get this distortion when we're using the GoPros?
So the reason why this distortion happens is because of the GoPro lens.
Already it's pretty small because GoPros need to fit on top of your head and they need to be light enough
for you to carry it around in your adventures.
So the lens itself has curved sides and that's exactly what we're seeing here.
The reason why it's curved is because it's meant to distort the light that is coming in from the side.
So this will give us a pretty high quality footage from this tiny lens.
And it's just a pretty common distortion that by now everyone is used to.
Every program has a lens distortion effect that you can just put onto your clip and fix this distortion
in a few clicks.
Now, some of the GoPro cameras do have the option for you to disable the fisheye effect or just a distortion,
but the older ones don't have this option.
So I will just show you how to fix this distortion using one effect in Premiere Pro.
Go to the effects panel and look for lens distortions and you're going to find this underneath the sort
at this onto your video and you're going to get some options in the effect controls, which you can
just bring in by going here right below, we can see that we got some sliders for curvature and some
other things.
So I just closed off all of those tabs and now we can focus on the actual lens and to duplicate this.
So I can always go back to this and see a before and after.
The most important one is curvature.
The other ones are just there to help you tweak the way it looks.
Normally you wouldn't be using these guys, but I will just explain regardless.
So if there was a moment that you needed them, you would know how to use them.
So before jumping into the slider, we need to know the difference between a convex lens and a concave
lens.
So a convex island effect is where the center of the video is pushed outwards, causing it to kind of
blow towards you in a concave effect is the opposite.
So instead of the middle being pushed out towards you, it's being pushed out away from you.
So we have the front side of the spoon, which we put the food in, and then we have the back side of
the spoon.
If we looked at ourselves from the inside of the spoon, we can see the distortion.
Now, here what's happening is how we're getting a concave effect, meaning that our face is going to
be small because the center is pushed back.
But the opposite side, which is the backside of the spoon, is a convex effect, meaning that the center
is pushed outwards.
And therefore, when we see our self in the back side, we're going to look kind of big and we're getting
that bloated distortion.
So that's the concept of convex versus concave lens.
And see that there's also the effect here.
There we go.
So on convex, we're bloated.
So you can see on concave, we're smaller because on convex the center floats towards you and on concave
D center floats away from you.
So now that we know the difference, we can decide what our video has, what type of distortion and
how much I need to use this slider, pull it towards the right.
You're going to get that convex effect.
The center is bloated and we're getting the edges kind of pulled backwards.
But if we go the other way, we're getting a concave effect, meaning that the edges are pulled towards
us and the center stays where it was.
So there really isn't a formula on how much you need for this slider.
You just have to eyeball it and if needed, you can just pull down a ruler, set it on the horizon line
that's usually in the center.
And then just that, just based on what you see.
If you're not seeing your ruler just hit down, commands are more control, are on windows, make sure
you select the preview panel first.
So the outside needs to be blue and you can just enable or disable the ruler.
So I'm almost there.
I'm just going to pull this back even more.
And now my horizon line is straight.
So this was before.
This is after.
It's quite different.
Now down to the other sliders.
These are just for you to fix the distortion further.
So like we said, normally you would need these other four sliders, but as the name suggests, you're
going to either center this video vertically.
Or horizontally.
Then you're going to add this price effects vertically.
Or horizontally.
So for me, I think I might need a little bit of vertical distortion.
If I pull down a ruler, you can see they're pretty good because I use this vertical centering.
I did end up distorting the horizontal line again.
So I have to go back.
With.
Horizontal the centering just until the water line meets my ruler.
So there you go.
Now, my video is looking pretty good.
Play it back and everything is looking straight.
So this was before.
This is after.
Pretty easy fix.
Now let's take a look at our second example.
Duplicate that.
And here we have a lot more of a distortion compared to the first one.
And we don't really have a horizon line to help us with the amount of the sliders.
So in this example and others like it, we just have to eyeball it and see when we need to stop, go
to the effects and bring this guy in.
And begin working with the slider.
So again, here we have a convex effect and see the edges are pushed back compared to the center.
So I would just have to pull it to a concave effect so that I can bring the edges closer towards the
center, making everything look balanced as it should be.
So here we can use a ruler and it's looking pretty good.
But if you don't have any guidance and you can just eyeball it and make this look less distorted.
So this was before.
This is after.
Now you will end up losing a bit of your video.
But generally, when you're shooting with GoPros or drones, you do want a lot of extra space around
your frame because most of the time you would have to reframe.
And that will cause some of your videos to not make it in the final shot.
So a general rule is to just center your subject in a way where there's enough space from all the edges
of your video.
So if my video was shot like this and I fixed the distortion, I will end up removing some of his feet,
his arm, his other arm, and that will just not look good.
So when you're filming with your GoPros, make sure that there is enough space all around.
So that's how we can fix Len's distortions using Premiere Pro because there is a built in effect.
You just have to move some sliders around and the rest is done by Premiere Pro.
Now, if this is not doing it for you, there's always plugins out there that will instantly fix your
videos so you can check those out.
If this effect is not satisfactory, I hope you guys enjoyed this lesson and I will see you in the next
one.


### 12. Light Issues

There are times where you have the wrong camera setting and then you get really dark or really bright
videos.
In today's lesson, we're going to see how we can fix this problem using a few simple sliders.
So I got two examples here.
One is really bright and the other one is really dark.
We're going to be using metric color to fix this, but before that, there are some things that you
need to keep in mind.
The first thing is that if your video is low quality and it has this problem, then fixing it will be
really hard and almost impossible because you don't have enough details to salvage the video.
So you want to make sure that the view you have is either shot by a professional camera or it has enough
details for you to manipulate the way it looked and make it look better or else you would be spending
too much time on something that's not possible.
So make sure that you have at least HD footage and that it's not compressed.
You got enough details.
The higher the resolution, the better.
So I shot these two videos at 4K 60 frames per second using my phone.
So I will switch to this tab that I just made myself.
You just remove any of the tabs that you don't need with this option and just focus on the color panel
and the preview panel.
I have the different sequences down here so I can just switch whenever I want.
Once you have set your workspace the way you want it to, you can just go down here, Save as new workspace.
Give it a name and it's going to show up right here.
So let's begin with this overexposed video.
First of all, the highlights are way too bright.
So let's just drag those highlights down so we can see some detail in the surrounding area.
Then go to your whites and you just want to reduce it so you don't get this blasting wide color, but
rather something soft.
Now the video is looking a little flat, so let's increase the contrast with the contrast lighter.
As for shadows, I'm going to reduce the amount to create more contrast.
All right.
You can also grab the exposure and pull it down.
It really depends on your video.
But for me, the only issue I had here was that I shot against the light source.
I did this on purpose so we can get some overexposure in our video.
Normally, you wouldn't want to do this.
And if your video was way more overexposed than the video here, then you would want to use the exposure
slider to.
Work with the white balance, make it the way you want it to.
But but so far it's looking better at down to the curves adjustment and work with the different points
to get a decent result.
So let's go to color wheels and match.
And since I don't have any details in the windows due to the fact that I shot against direct sunlight,
I can just maybe add a simple tint to the highlights and make it look better.
So I will add maybe a warm yellow color to make it look like sunlight, then tints the shadows and highlights
to the way that I want.
So now I have somewhat salvaged my overexposed shot.
This is what it looked like before.
This is what it looks like after.
So the more detail your video has, the more you can salvage.
Now, let's take a look at our second example, where we have a really underexposed video.
Begin with basic correction here.
I just want to increase the exposure so we can see what we're dealing with.
Increase the shadows.
Contrast.
Increase the whites.
And a little for highlights.
You don't want to touch the blacks because you're going to just flatten everything out.
So now, just with those sliders, I can see what's happening inside this clip.
All I have to do is to go down to curves and just make this perfect with an S-curve.
There we go.
The video is looking a little yellow.
To go to the blue channel and lift up the mid tones towards the blue side to cancel out the yellow colors.
Go to green.
We have some green now lowered that downwards towards magenta, which is the opposite color of green.
There we go.
Now let's go to the creative section and increase the vibrance.
Sharpen this video and a little bit of saturation.
So the video is looking pretty good right now.
We have.
Brought out details.
Now we can tell that this is a plant, but we're getting a lot of noise now with underexposed videos.
This is a pretty common problem that you will face regardless of what you're using.
And if you are using a camera, using a high ISO and a wrong shutter speed can lead you to this problem.
But we already learned how to fix this, so this will not be that big of a deal.
I would just go to my color reels and add some color grading to this, maybe.
Have the highlights go towards a colder side.
Shadows will bring it to a warmer site and just bring them into to a colder side to balance out the
colours.
Basic correction work with temperature and tint.
So we just used exposure to the full amount because we had a lot of dark areas.
Go to the effects tab right here and look for the look for the void noise effect.
Double click to apply it to your video.
Once you did that, go to the effect controls I added to by accident.
Delete the first one and we can just zoom right in and decide how much of this we want.
So this right now is way too much.
Just so lower that, as you recall, you want to add a really small number and if needed, work your
way up from there.
Let's try 0.15.
That's looking good.
Look for the sharpen effect.
Go to VR.
Sharpen double click.
And now we can add to the sharpened amount.
So this will end up bringing a little bit of noise in.
So you want to add maybe two or one.
And that way we can minimize the noise result.
Bring this above your noise.
And now things are looking better than they did before.
This was before.
This is after.
It's not exactly perfect, but we managed to get something out of our video.
Now, if you're not happy with the result, it plays back.
What you can do is to first reframe your video by zooming in so we can avoid the edges.
Let's add the reduce interface flicker, which is right there, and add maybe six to the video.
When I play this back, you will notice a little bit of a flickering effect in details.
So what we're going to do is to duplicate the clip, hold down option or alt and bring it right above
on the top video.
We're going to reduce the opacity to 50%.
And then using the slip tool, we're going to shift this to frames towards the right so that the top
layer is not playing exactly with the bottom layer.
So once we have that, we should be able to reduce that flickering effect and get something better.
So now let's take a look at it before and after.
So this was before we had a really dark video.
And this is after using these simple techniques, you can save your overexposed or underexposed videos.
So I hope you guys enjoyed this lesson and I will see you in the next one.


### 13. Blur & Depth

In today's lesson, we're going to learn all about blurring in Premiere Pro.
Firstly, we will begin with sharpening a blurry video and then continue to add blur to a footage in
order to create some depth.
So let's get started.
I have four clips and they're all in your resource bag.
Import them into Premiere Pro and create a sequence from each one.
First, let's begin with blurry videos.
It's pretty common to end up with a blurry video after a long day of shooting.
Most times you are able to fix this issue with a few tweaks inside Premiere Pro, but other times you
may be kind of difficult, so you may have to use more advanced tools such as a technology.
So take a look at this video right now.
We have one side that is more in focus and the other side that is completely blurred out.
So if your videos look like this, the chances of you fixing them will be rather slim.
This side, using AI technology, you may be able to salvage a video that is completely blurred out
like this.
But if your video looks like the right side where there is some detail but it's not exactly sharp,
then there is a chance that you can fix it in post-production.
So if I zoom in right here, the problem is that we're not really seeing the sharp details of the eye.
And things are not as crystal clear as we'd want them to be.
Let's zoom out.
Begin by duplicating your video, holding down option or alt clicking and dragging it above.
Then go to the effects menu and look for the on sharpened mask.
It's inside this folder.
Edit On the top video, let's zoom right into the eyeball.
The Fed controls and began adding to the amount.
By default, it's on 50.
So just crank this up to somewhere around 200 you don't want to go to up or else you're going to create
noise.
So I think maybe 250 is good for this example.
And right away we can see a lot more from the eyeball.
Says before, after, because this is a mask.
I can ask Premier Pro to only apply this sharpness on the area where there needs to be sharpness.
Simply grab the pen tool or any other shape and begin drawing around that area.
You don't want to go to extremes that are really rough.
Selection.
And now I will not get that sharp effect on deep blurred areas, because if we do, we're just going
to create excess noise.
Be sure to soften the edges of your mask and if needed, just.
Track it, but for me it's pretty good.
I don't need to do that.
So that's how easily you can fix your blurry videos.
There are some other options in the Blur and Sharpen.
We got some other things like the sharpen effect.
This is a more general effect compared to the one that we just used.
So if I just zoom in here, I can use the sharpen effect to just add a tiny bit more of a detail.
Can see that immediately.
It brings a lot of noise.
So I recommend using this effect and if necessary, go with this one.
Let's try 25.
This is before.
This is after.
Just going to copy the mask.
Command C Control C, then select Sharpen Command V, Control V, And now this effect is limited to
her eyeball.
Looking good.
So now this was before without any effect.
This is after.
If you saw that these effects are adding a lot of noise to your clip, you can go ahead and add a VR
noise reduction effect that we already learned how to use the VR noise effect added on top.
Then change the amount to something little like 0.08 can even go lower and that will just give us a
softer look.
This is before.
This is after.
Depending on how much noise it brought to your clips, you can play around with the amount.
There we go.
Now let's move on to our second example.
So here I don't have an eye and my subject is actually pretty far.
So now let's just use the sharpen effect at the sharpen effect right above and then add to the amount.
On top of that, I'm going in with the sharp mask.
You can go further than usual because I will be using the noise effect right after 200 for this.
And already it's looking pretty good.
To duplicate this and delete the effects from the first one.
So just by those two, we were able to bring out some of those details into flour.
If needed, you can also add to the radius underneath Onshape Mask by default.
It's on one, but you can go up to like four and get some of those fine lines.
Now finish off with a noise effect.
Reducing the amount so it doesn't look as flat.
And there we go.
So now we're not getting all of the noise and we're just keeping the details on the flower.
Now my subject is in focus.
So this was before.
This is after.
You can go further with the noise thing.
I'll go with point 15 just to get rid of those tiny details.
And that's looking good.
Now, what if you want to do the opposite instead of removing the blur you want to add to it in order
to create depth of field.
Depth of field is how you can show the distance between each of the elements in either a photograph
or a video.
So here clearly there is a lot of distance between our subjects and the landscape.
Now, depending on the settings that you have on your camera, you will either get depth of field or
not get it at all.
So here we're not getting that much of depth of field and therefore I can just achieve it in post-production.
Duplicate your clip.
And on this one we want to add a blur effect.
Type in blur and we're going to use the fast blur effect added right above.
We are choosing fast Blur because it gives us the most natural result.
And I could just get some blur by adding in to the blurriness amount.
I think 15 is good, but now I need to mask it so that it does not go on top of my subject.
Simply grab your mask of choice, grab this rectangle, and place it right over there.
Then we're going to increase the mask further.
So zoom out of your clip and pull the top part away.
So we don't get a feathered effect at the start, but only from this point on.
There we go.
So we blurred out the mountains in the back by simply adding in the fast blur effect.
So I will actually delete my mask one and instead just go around my subject with the pencil.
Starting here, I want to blur out the mountains somewhere around here and just go around and then just
go around the subject.
Once you're done, you want to zoom out from your canvas and finish it in a rather large scale because
we're going to feather this out.
And we don't want the softness to reach the corner of our video.
Increase the mask feather.
Reposition the point if you have to, and you're basically done because the video is stable.
I don't really need to track it, but if yours was moving, then you would want to make a mask around
your subject and then track it.
That way we will not end up blurring out the subject's body.
You can also use a ruler.
To make sure that your mask path is straight.
You can activate the ruler by hitting down command R or control R once you have your mask ready.
Now you have created a depth of field effect for your video.
You can expand it closer to the edge here, but I'm just going to leave it in the back and have it look
like the mountains are really far away.
Our next example is of this flower.
And this is a situation where we need to use a radial mask instead of the mask we're using.
Duplicate your clip at the same fast blur and then using the radial mask.
Let's first add maybe.
Turn to the amount and the amount that you put for blurring is is really important because you can't
just randomly make everything flat.
You have to keep in mind the distance between the subject that the camera is focused on and the subjects
around it.
So in our previous example, the mountains are really far away from our subject.
So I have the liberty of adding a good amount like 15 or so.
But in the second example, the leaves are pretty close to the flower, meaning that I can just add
a large amount because it's going to look unrealistic.
Usually the leaves on a flower are pretty close to the petal.
And therefore, if our camera were to catch this depth of field, it would not look this extreme.
So for this example, ten is a good number.
This is before.
This is after.
Then grab a mask.
And place it around the flower.
Leaving some space from the edges because we're going to feather the sides.
Now we need to invert the mask so it doesn't go on to flower and then finally feather the edges.
So now this is looking a lot more realistic than if I were to put a large number.
Now, for this one, we're going to have to track the mask since it does move around.
And they hit on the frame that I set the first mask, then just track the mask going forward.
So creating depth and fixing blurry videos is not that hard in Premiere Pro, as long as the video does
have the possibility of it being fixed.
So like we said, if your video is just way too blurry like this side of the model, then saving it
and making it sharper is unlikely.
You want to work with videos that have a tiny bit of blurring, meaning that the details are there and
we just want to make them pop and be sharper.
So I hope you guys enjoyed this lesson and I will see you in the next one.


### 14. Multi Camera Editing

In today's lesson, we're going to learn how we can use Premiere Pro's Multicam feature.
So in sport events or any other event.
There are usually a lot of cameras around the room, so all of these cameras are focused on the subject.
This could be a race car, a dancer, a animal or anything else.
And the reason why there are so many cameras is so that later on in post-production, they can switch
between the different angles as they are editing the video.
This is pretty common with life events.
Imagine a basketball match.
There's always multiple cameras around the court.
All of these cameras are filming the match, but each of them is focused on one element.
So one camera is focused on the player, the other one on the ball.
One has a wider shot, one has a close up, and then there's a person that directs which camera goes
on the screen.
So in the live stream they can just switch between camera three, four and switch between the different
angles to make the audience more engaged.
But if you're not switching between cameras life, then you would have to do it in post-production.
So Premiere Pro already has this feature, which allows us to put many different videos on top of each
other and switch between them as we play the video.
So by default, you would just maybe go through your clip, trim it, and then bring the Skype back,
maybe switch it like this.
But this can take a lot of time.
So the multicam feature allows you to play the video.
And then while you're watching the preview, you're making your cuts.
So it's as interesting as it sounds and we're going to go over it in this lesson.
So there are two ways that you can use the multicam effect.
The first one is to create it in the project panel and then bring it into the timeline or just create
it inside the timeline.
That depends on your videos.
It's going project panel.
If you want your entire clip from start to finish, then you can just bring them all into the timeline
and create the Multicamera sequence.
But if in your clips, you only want, let's say this much of your video, then you would want to do
it inside the project panel.
Let's begin with the project panel method.
I'm going to use my play head set, a mark endpoint and a mark out point.
So it could be like a tiny bit of this video and maybe the entire clip for the last one.
Once you have set your points, we're going to grab them.
All right.
Click create, multi source sequence.
You're going to get this window.
Give it a name and call it Multicam Method one.
Now, in our example, I have some random videos from the internet, but usually this method is used
for when you have one subject doing one action, and then you've got different cameras around a subject
recording at the same time.
For example, your subject is sitting on a chair.
They're talking and you have one camera really close up, one camera really far away, one camera from
maybe behind them and one camera from above.
The cameras are all recording at the same time.
And in all of those videos, your subject is performing that action.
So you would want to synchronize all of those so that when you put these different clips next to each
other, they don't kind of cut off the subject's action.
Essentially, we would just be looking at the subject's action from different angles.
So that's why we have these synchronized option synchronize with endpoints, then hit OC.
So there's my multicam sequence.
I call it that again.
In the beginning it had my video name Delete that and then just make a sequence.
Right click new sequence from clip.
So once I have this, I'm going to go down here and the wrench button.
And enable the Multicamera option.
So we have all of our videos right here and the numbering is one, two, three and four.
It's not written there, but that's how it is.
One, two, three, four.
Then this is your final preview.
So now what I can do is to play my video and switch between these different clips.
If you want to change the order, you would want to go back to settings.
Come down here.
Edit Camera's.
Here.
I can see the numbers assigned to each clip and I can just switch their position if I want.
If I want another video above the other.
You can also turn a video on or off by pressing this button down here.
We can change cameras per page.
So if I had more than four videos, I can change the amount here.
Maybe I have 16 or eight and I can just set the number here.
If I set this to two, I will not get the rest.
And instead I have a page two that I can just switch between using the arrows right here.
Go back to edit cameras and change it back to four.
So now I'm going to play my video in space and then press on the camera that I want.
When I hit space again.
You can see the cuts down here.
This is the final preview.
We had this clip.
I jumped into this one and it just keeps going until we got all of our video.
Now, the reason why I'm getting a black screen is because of the duration that we set in the beginning.
So process clips, if you recall, we made these little cuts and therefore some of the videos will be
shorter than the other ones.
It may sound a little inconvenient with a clip like this, but imagine editing a two hour video using
the classic tools like Drop Tool, Eraser Tool and all that.
It's going to take a long time.
So why not have it play and just simply click to make these edits?
So this was one method by clicking.
Now let's take a look at another method.
So I brought in my eclipse again, and now I'm going to drag them all at the same time into my timeline.
So this is for instances where you don't want to sit in or out points and you want the whole length
of each clip.
What you need to do next is to place the clips right above each other like so.
I'm just going to trim all of them at this point so they play at the same time.
Be sure to enable all of your videos then without selecting anything.
We're going to hold down Command K or Control K on Windows.
After splitting the videos, we're going to delete the extra bits.
And now I'm left with four clips playing at the same time.
Grab all of your clips, highlight them right click next call this multi camera.
Then right click on your nest again.
Multi-camera enable.
Not to see the different cameras.
We're going to head to settings again and just enable the camera view.
So again, I'm left with the same exact view.
But now instead of clicking, I'm going to use my keyboard shortcuts.
So by default, the shortcuts would be command or control.
One, two, three, four.
So if I want to select this clip, which is number four, I would have to hold down command and four
at the same time.
But that can be a little bit inconvenient because I have to hold down command to every time.
But I can change that into something more suitable.
Hold down option command K.
That's alt control K.
On windows, you're going to get the keyboard shortcuts in the search bar.
Look for the camera option.
Come down to the cut to camera options.
It's actually control one, not command one.
And I could just type in one instead of the control option.
And instead of having to press two keys, I'm just going to delete the current shortcut and hit number
one on my keyboard.
So we got this one.
I'm going to change all of them into these different numbers.
Once I have my different numbers, you can go further and fill up all of these.
But I only have four different cameras.
So these will be enough.
Once you're finished.
Now I'm going to have my video play, then have my fingers on one, two, three and four on the keyboard.
And just using those numbers, I can switch between the different clips.
You still have the option to click it with your mouse, but on the keyboard it's a lot more convenient
and easier to do.
Play your clip.
Camera two.
Camera three, four, one, three, two, four.
Once it's finished, I now have these different cuts on my timeline.
Let's go back to composite video, play this back.
And I have these cuts inside of the video.
You can see how much more convenient and easy this is compared to having to track each clip playing
through command.
K delete the extra bit, bring in another clip, and then keep going till the rest of the timeline.
That's going to take a really long time.
So this Multicamera feature is really cool and really handy.
So that's how you can use the Multicamera feature inside Premiere Pro.
This is especially helpful when you're working with longer clips and it's also helpful for talking heads
or any other situation where you have different cameras set on one subject.
So practice with this tool and it's definitely going to come in handy.
I hope you guys enjoyed this lesson and I will see you guys in the next one.


### 15. Zoom

In today's lesson, we're going to see different ways that we can zoom into our eclipse while maintaining
the quality of our videos.
So let's get started.
I have four different things right here.
Two of them are videos and the other two are images.
For the clips.
I have really high quality ones they are both for.
One of my images is 1920 by 1491 and the other one is slightly larger.
So as you can see, we don't have identical footage.
And in today's lesson, we're going to see the best way that we can zoom into these different footage
without losing their quality.
Let's pull all of these guys into the timeline.
So as you can see, the larger videos are perfectly fit, but the images are just not quite fit.
In other times they are way too zoomed in without me doing so.
The first thing that you can do is to set one scale for one of your footage and then copy it onto the
other ones.
For example, I will be on the first clip selected.
Go to effect controls using scale.
I will just bring it in by like 120.
Then copy the clip.
Command C control C select the rest of the videos.
Right click paste attributes.
So this is going to paste the stuff that you select here.
For me, that's motion.
We didn't really do anything in time, remapping or opacity.
Just make sure that motion is turned on.
Motion counts for position scale rotation.
So if you're doing any of those, you would want this guy to be turned on.
Once you hit.
Okay.
Now the rest of the videos are scaled in by 120.
If I go in each one 120.
120 and 120.
So if you have a large selection of clips, you don't need to scale them in one by one, but instead
do your scaling on one video and then paste the attributes on the others.
The next method is for situations like this where some of our clips are surrounded by black bars.
You can see this guy is falling.
On the other hand, it's a bit too large, so when I scale it out, you can see that it's actually quite
taller than what we were seeing.
So we're going to select the video right click.
So down here we have scale to frame size and set to frame size.
There is a big difference between these two.
I will tell you that in a minute.
But for now, just for it to fit my frame, I'm going to choose the set of frame size option.
So now I'm not getting those black bars in.
I didn't even have to scale it up myself.
Try to figure out where I need to stop.
I just did one click and my image is perfectly fit for my frame.
Do the same thing for the other one.
Right click.
Said to frame size.
Now, it doesn't matter if your clip is too big or too small for your sequence.
As long as you do this one click Premiere Pro will determine if it needs to remove from the default
100 scale or add to the default 100 scale.
You can also create keyframes for these zoom movements.
So right over here I have two words.
I want to slowly zoom in onto this bird and then zoom out towards this second bird.
So we already know how to create keyframes.
Then extend this window right here.
Then go to the beginning of your video.
Make a default keyframe right here.
One for skill and one for position.
Go onto the frame that you want to zoom in using scale.
I'm going to zoom in towards the bird and then position to just move the canvas to where it needs to
be.
Now because my video is 4K, zooming in does not cause a lot of resolution problems.
And when I play this back, I can still get a sharp result for my bird.
Around here.
I'm going to make another keyframe for both of these options.
Then zoom out to the default 100% and just move the video back towards the second bird.
Which is kind of hidden.
A zoom in again.
There you go.
There is my second bird.
And now we have these keyframes set on DVD video.
The problem is that the movement is really static.
And it's kind of looking stiff and not ideal.
So what we want to do is to create keyframe animations instead of leaving them to be linear keyframes.
So grab the inky frames.
Highlight them like this.
Hold down, downshift and grab the other pair, right click temporal interpolation and then choose the
ease in animation.
Then grab the rest of these guys and set them to ease out.
So now we're going to get a movement, a smooth movement compared to what we had before.
So let me just hit Command Z and show you exactly what we did.
When I open up the position and scale, you can see how stiff these turns are.
Just really sharp points going around.
And when you're getting sharp points, you're kind of getting the exact same stiff movement that is
shown in these lines.
Now, watch what happens when you grab all of these guys right click and let's say I'm going to make
them auto busier.
This is just a random choice for now.
But notice how there are a lot of curves now, which means that the movement will be a lot more smooth.
Play this back.
And you can see how the movement has changed, first of all.
And we're not getting that stiff left and right movement we had before.
Now for this type of framing, the auto busier wasn't the best option.
So go back to what we had before.
The graph looks completely different and my movements are just a lot more smooth.
This can be helpful for these type of slow zoom animations.
So what if you want to zoom in and out into your subject, but with like some motion blur involved?
I'm going to zoom in onto the wolf's head and introduce some motion blur.
Now, instead of using the same motion properties right here, I will be adding the transform effect,
which basically does the same, but it gives us a few more options.
Drag this onto your wolf clip.
Go to effect controls.
Down here.
You can see we still have position, scale, rotation, opacity and all that.
But now we have the shutter angle option, which is something we didn't have right above.
So let's go to this frame where the wolf is looking away.
Select the position property.
You will see this blue thing which you can just drag around.
Set this onto the wolf's head.
And now whatever movements we do, we will be doing it based off the wolf's head.
Make a key frame for position, then go in on to where you want to zoom in towards the wolf's head.
Scale right in.
We also need to create anchor point keyframes.
So go back to the first key frame.
Make a key frame for anchor point going forward.
I can just pull this back.
To the wolf's head.
And the position is fine.
Make a Q frame.
Now I have a movement that goes with the wolf's head.
You can see that the video itself is slowly shifting towards the side, just as the wolf's head is moving.
Now, to avoid the black bars, we're just going to zoom in using scale.
I'll make you free.
Go to the last frame.
And here we have some room so I can just zoom out to 119.
Now I can just animate the keyframes, just as we did previously.
Play this back and I have a really nice head lock animation.
Now to add motion blur.
So around here, I'm going to do a really fast animation.
So let's kind of reset the keyframes and then I'm going to add a really crazy rotation keyframe just
for a dramatic.
Animation that I can use to introduce some motion blur as your rotation Q frame here.
We can kind of like turn it around like this.
Now, when I play this back, you can see the motion blur that is around the.
That is not there when the keyframes finish.
So here we have motion blur when the transition is happening, and the closer you bring these together,
the more motion blur you will have.
So here we have plural.
Here we don't.
And the motion blur will be placed on your anchor point.
Currently, I believe we have it set on this point.
Let me just change it to the wolf's head so we don't get any blur.
And now I'm going to get something like this.
Motion Blur is going to add a really nice touch to your transitions.
It's almost an essential thing in sport videos or videos where there is a lot of action.
So using the transform effect, we can introduce motion blur to our videos.
Now let's talk about the difference between scale to frame size and set to frame size.
So if you recall, we had two options when we wanted to scale this to the frame size.
Let's say this is my original video.
It's, as we said, a4k clip.
And I just want to scale this up so I don't get these black bars.
Of course, I can grab these scale right here, but I wouldn't know exactly where to stop.
And just figuring out how much I need is going to be time consuming.
So when you right click go down.
We have two options for this issue scale to frame size and set to frame size, kind of pull these guys
away and duplicate my clip by holding down option or alt if you're not getting a snapping effect on
your timeline.
It may be because you had s by accident.
So when I move this around, you can see jumps to the end of the previous clip.
But if I hit s on my keyboard, I'm going to disable that snapping option.
So make sure you have snapping, turn it on so you can put it right after your first clip.
So I will use it to images that we had from before.
One of them is too small.
Let me set this back to the default number.
And the second one was too big.
On this one, I'm going to right click.
Scale to frame size.
And on the second one, I'm going to write a click set to frame size.
Now, both of these options did help me with my issue, but there is a big difference.
So in the second option set to frame size, I got a value less than 100 for scale.
For the scale two frame size.
I did not get a changed value, even though this guy was a lot smaller than the frame size.
So what happened and why do they look different?
So when it comes to scale, which is the first option that we had.
Apart from fitting the video into the frame size, we actually rationalise the footage, meaning that
the original quality of this footage was reduced to the sequences dimension.
So if I had a sequence that was HD 1920 by 1080 and my image or video was like for K eight, k, scaling
to frame size is going to reduce the quality of my video to HD.
So it's going to pasteurize the 4K clip and turn it into HD.
And that's not a good thing because let's say after I have scaled down my video, I want to continue
zooming in, maybe make some key frames, something like this.
But because Premiere Pro Pasteurize, this image, I will be getting a blurry result.
That is because my footage is no longer 4K and is now HD.
So that's why scaling to frame size isn't always good when you have high quality footage.
But in the second option set to frame size, it's not going to pasteurize the clip and it's just as
if we were using the scale ourselves.
So I still have my 4K footage.
The only difference is that the scale is no longer 100 and it's like 67.
So this option is better when you have high quality clips because it does not get pasteurized.
And throughout the entire project you will keep the original quality of your videos.
So those were some tips regarding zooming into your footage inside Premiere Pro.
Always remember to have high quality footage if you're looking to zoom in during your editing.
So I hope you guys enjoy this lesson and I will see you in the next one.
