- [[Artisti/Sol LeWitt]]不仅写下了创作壁画的公式化规则，这些壁画通常由许多直线组成（有时多达 10,000 条），这些直线彼此之间有特定的距离和/或绘制了特定的分钟数），而且他训练他的助手以特定方式执行这些指令。他甚至停止了在泰特美术馆建造“他的”一件作品，因为他觉得泰特的工作人员执行他的传真指示（他们认为这完全是直截了当的）是不可接受的。 [(p.110)](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/36FR2KYB?page=110&annotation=P4R5N9VH) ```Perhaps the best example of this is the American artist Sol LeWitt. Not only did he write down formulaic rules for composing his wall drawings, which usually consisted of many straight lines (sometimes, as many as 10,000) positioned at specified distances from each other and/or drawn for a specified number of minutes), but he trained his assistants to execute these instructions in a particular way. He even halted the construction of one of ‘his’ pieces at the Tate gallery because he felt that the execution of his faxed instructions by the Tate’s staff (which they had assumed was utterly straightforward) was unacceptable. He sent out two of his own staff from New York to do the job instead.```
