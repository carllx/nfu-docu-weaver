- 互联网已成为外部或交互记忆的主要形式，其中信息集体存储在我们之外 [(p.0)](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/7LPVVXGV?page=0&annotation=QNNNCV3Y) ```The Internet has become a primary form of external or transactive memory, where information is stored collectively outside ourselves.```

- 过去计算机出现之前，人们通常会发展小组或交互记忆 (1)，这是个人直接持有的记忆库和他们可以访问的记忆库的组合，因为他们认识的人知道那个信息。 [(p.0)](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/7LPVVXGV?page=0&annotation=JHR3Q4UJ) ```In any long-term relationship, a team work environment, or other ongoing group, people typically develop a group or transactive memory (1), a combination of memory stores held directly by individuals and the memory stores they can access because they know someone who knows that information.(1)D. M. Wegner, in Theories of Group Behavior, B. Mullen, G. R. Goethals, Eds. (Springer-Verlag, New York, 1986), pp. 185–208.```

- 证实，当人们知道 "what"时，他们不记得“where”，但当他们不记得时，确实记得在哪里可以找到信息。 [(p.2)](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/7LPVVXGV?page=2&annotation=W4AITBRZ) ```It would seem from this pattern that people don’t remember “where” when they know “what” but do remember where to find the information when they don’t recall it.```

- 如朋友是我们信息源，失去互联网意味着我们也失去朋友。我们必须保持与Google连接，知道那些它知道的信息 [(p.2)](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/7LPVVXGV?page=2&annotation=DFL5WWTM) ```We have become dependent on them to the same degree we are dependent on all the knowledge we gain from our friends and co-workers—and lose if they are out of touch. The experience of losing our Internet connection becomes more and more like losing a friend. We must remain plugged in to know what Google knows.```
