## Abstract

Two of the key information technologies with very high expectations to change our contemporary society are the fifth generation broadband cellular network technologies, which are already emerging to markets, and the foreseen sixth generation broadband cellular network technologies currently under research and development. The core promise of these next generation technologies lies especially in lower latency for providing users feedback on their behavior; thus, growing opportunities for influencing users in their everyday contexts. This viewpoint article seeks to discuss how these opportunities may impact future information technology in general and especially persuasive design and research before 2030. In addition, we will address challenges regarding the promise of 5G and 6G technologies. Information and communication technology can support individuals’ behavioral change only if they can access the technology. In this article, we will exemplify this by presenting possible ways to minimize the digital divide between rural and urban areas, wherein lies a general danger that the divide would increase further.



## Notes

- Mobile 技术在未来也成为互联网连接的重要元素，5G 和 6G 将使个人和社区能够改变他们的行为 [(p.1)](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/TMRMF64Y?page=1&annotation=U95BHHLB) ```There is all the reason to believe that mobile technologies will serve as important elements for Internet connectivity also in the future, and that 5G and 6G will enable individuals and communities to change their behavior towards what is more sustainable in the long term```

- 用户行为分析和说服力设计PSD 的更紧密耦合 [[persuasive technology]] [(p.7)](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/TMRMF64Y?page=7&annotation=BLAFPBMX) ```The need for understanding user context could be expected to become more prominent with the emerging next generation broadband cellular network technologies. Tighter coupling of the analysis of user behavior and the design of persuasive influences may enable stronger support for personalized software features```

- 我们做一件事情只想将数字技术是为辅助工具的时候，这些工具可能需要非常高的认知注意力，例如需要你沉浸其中 [(p.8)](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/TMRMF64Y?page=8&annotation=M4RLWZJ7) ```Paradoxically, even if we tend to think about these technologies as tools or aids when we need to do something, these technologies may suddenly require a very high cognitive attention without our control. Some of the “tools” could even require immersion into their platforms.```
