# Abstract 抽象的

-   This article attempts to understand the reconstitution of the `present` in modern societies. I argue that this reconstitution is the result of work done on `bare life`, which I associate with that little space of time between action and performance. The article goes on to consider the ways in which this reconstitution of the present is taking place, using examples from the economic sphere. Throughout the article, I argue that operations on [bare life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/bare_life "Definition of bare life") are not only instrumental but also open up new spaces of biopolitical practice based on a greater recognition of the value of slowness in a world commonly figured as fast.

# Main approaches discussed?  
描述所讨论的主要方法？
The main approach discussed in this paper is the reconstitution of the 'present' in modern societies. This process involves work done on what I refer to as ‘bare life’, which can be thought of as a state where individuals are stripped away from their social and cultural identities. The article looks at how bare life has been used by governments and other institutions to control populations through various means such as surveillance, censorship, or even violence. It also examines how these practices have shaped our understanding of time and space within society today.  
本文讨论的主要方法是重构现代社会中的“当下”。这个过程涉及对我所说的“赤裸生命”所做的工作，这可以被认为是个人被剥夺其社会和文化身份的一种状态。这篇文章着眼于政府和其他机构如何通过监视、审查甚至暴力等各种手段利用赤裸裸的生命来控制人口。它还考察了这些实践如何塑造了我们对当今社会时间和空间的理解。

## Abstract

-   This article attempts to understand the reconstitution of the `present' in modern societies. I argue that this reconstitution is the result of work done on `bare life', which I associate with that little space of time between action and performance. The article goes on to consider the ways in which this reconstitution of the present is taking place, using examples from the economic sphere. Throughout the article, I argue that operations on [bare life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/bare_life "Definition of bare life") are not only instrumental but also open up new spaces of biopolitical practice based on a greater recognition of the value of slowness in a world commonly figured as fast.

-   1. I use the word  'instincts' here to signal my intention to try to transcend humanist approaches to [nature](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/nature "Definition of nature"), though many of these 'instincts' are complex biological-cultural constructions. 
    我在这里使用 `instincts(本能)`  一词，表明我打算尝试超越人文主义的自然方法，尽管这些 `instincts(本能)` 中有许多是复杂的生物-文化 (biological-cultural)建构。

-   2. Then when we say  `information`  in everyday life, ==we spontaneously think of information as the result of a discarding of information. We do not consider the fact that there is more information in an experience than in an account of it.== It is the account that we consider to be information. But the whole basis of such an account is information that is discarded. Only after information has been discarded can a situation become an event people can talk about. The total situation we find ourselves in at any given time is precisely one we cannot provide an account of: we can give an account of it only when it has `collapsed` into an event through the discarding of information. ([Norretranders, 1998](chrome://new-tab-page/#rNorretranders_1998_a): 109)
	 那么当我们在日常生活中说到 `information(信息)`  时，我们会自发地认为信息是摒弃信息的结果。我们不考虑这样一个事实，即在一个经验中比在对它的描述中存在着更多的信息。我们认为账户才是信息。但是，这样一个账户的全部基础是被抛弃的信息。只有在信息被抛弃之后，一种情况才能成为人们可以谈论的事件。我们在任何特定时间发现自己所处的总体情况正是我们无法提供的一种说明：只有当它通过丢弃信息而 "崩溃 "成一个事件时，我们才能对它作出说明。
 
-   3. Many of these bodily practices necessarily contain improvisational elements, since they are always performative, instantiated in the capacities of particular bodies and content-specific (see [Hayles, 1999](chrome://new-tab-page/#rHayles_1999_a); [Thrift, 2000](chrome://new-tab-page/#rThrift_2000_a)). Think only of the face with its potent muscular geography (cf. [Brothers, 1997](chrome://new-tab-page/#rBrothers_1997_a); [McNeil, 1998](chrome://new-tab-page/#rMcneil_1998_a); [Taussig, 1998](chrome://new-tab-page/#rTaussig_1998_a)).
		许多这样的身体实践必然包含 improvisational(即兴) 的元素，因为它们总是表演性的，在特定身体的能力中体现出来，并且是特定内容的（见Hayles，1999；Thrift，2000）。仅仅想一想脸部及其有力的肌肉地理环境
-   4. This is a very different notion of metaphor from that employed by [Lakoff and Johnson (1998](chrome://new-tab-page/#rLakoff_1998_a)) which seems to me to over-determine both the idea of metaphor and the process of metaphorization.
-   5. In other words, the notion of speed is part of the rhetoric of how [Euro-American](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euro-American "Definition of Euro-American") societies go on.
-   6. There are interesting connections here with all kinds of earlier body practices from drill to dance which could be brought out and which are brought together in the 20th-century city in the work of writers like Laban (see [Thrift, 2000](chrome://new-tab-page/#rThrift_2000_a)).
-   7. The practice of photography, in other words, is as important for its process of doing as for its results (photographs which are normally rarely looked at).
-   8. Aided, in certain cases, by stimulants like drugs.
-   9. All these practices are heightened by the growing sense, stimulated by the media, of audience (see [Abercrombie and Longhurst, 1998](chrome://new-tab-page/#rAbercrombie_1998_a)); we now constantly see and take in other body practices: ways of walking and the like. This mundane anthropology is becoming more and more important.
-   10. Thus, for example:
-   ... when we approach a great fir on the crest of a mountain, we stand tall or our eyes travel upward to the clouds and eagles, when we approach a willow our gaze sweeps in languid arcs across the backs of lime branches rippling over the lake. When we come upon a fallen tree, we have difficulty seeing it is a willow or a pine or a tree; it appears as a thicket about a log, in a confused lay out inviting closer scrutiny. ([Lingis, 1998](chrome://new-tab-page/#rLingis_1998_a): 53)
-   11. Note also Derrida's thoughts on [nature](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/nature "Definition of nature") as a form of writing (see [Kirby, 1997](chrome://new-tab-page/#rKirby_1997_a)).
-   12. Ancient Christian prayer cited in de Certeau (1992: 1).
-   13. The main marketing slogan of the [American](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/american "Definition of American") Wilderness Experience.
-   14. So think of the following quotation as a business proposition.
-   To recognise a person is to recognise a typical way of addressing tasks, of envisaging landscapes, of advancing hesitantly and cautiously or ironically, of playing exuberantly down the paths to us. Someone we know is someone we relate to posturally, someone we walk in step with, someone who maintains a certain style of positioning himself or herself and gesticulating in conversation and with whom we take up a compromising position as we talk. ([Lingis, 1998](chrome://new-tab-page/#rLingis_1998_a): 53)
-   15. I realize that this section might be read as a Baudrillardian account of the rise of simulacra. This is not, however, the way I would want it read. Baudrillard's accounts are far too sweeping for me, and lack any but a stylized historical sense.

# Introduction 介绍

-   I would like to acknowledge the cognitive environment provided by the Scandinavian Collegium for Advanced Study in the [Social Sciences 承认斯堪的纳维亚社会科学高级研究学院提供的认知环境](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_Sciences "Definition of Social Sciences") (SCASSS) in the preparation of this article. Several people there discussed its contents with me and enabled me to hone the arguments, in particular [Katharine Young](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Katharine_Young "Definition of Katharine Young") and [Barbara Kirshenblatt-Gimblett](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barbara_Kirshenblatt-Gimblett "Definition of Barbara Kirshenblatt-Gimblett"). I also very much appreciated the opportunity to present the article at the Materiality/Sociality Conference held at Brunel University. 非常感谢有机会在布鲁内尔大学举行的物质性/社会性会议上发表这篇文章。Several people at the conference provided valuable comments and especially Dede Boden, [Kevin Hetherington](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_Hetherington "Definition of Kevin Hetherington"), [Bruno Latour](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bruno_Latour "Definition of Bruno Latour") and [Steve Woolgar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Woolgar "Definition of Steve Woolgar"). Finally, the comments of the five referees helped me to further hone and clarify the article. 五位审稿人的评论帮助我进一步打磨和澄清了这篇文章。
