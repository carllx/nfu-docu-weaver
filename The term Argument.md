##  The term 'argument' 
meaning of the term 'argument' and how it differs in programming development and academic papers?
In programming, an argument is a piece of data that is passed to a function when it is called. The function can then use this data to perform its task. For example, the following function takes two arguments, the first being the name of a file and the second being the number of lines to print:↳

Code snippet

```
def print_lines(filename, number_of_lines):
  with open(filename, "r") as f:
    for i in range(number_of_lines):
      print(f.readline())
```

When this function is called, the arguments must be provided in the correct order. For example, the following code would print the first two lines of the file "my_file.txt":↳

Code snippet

```
print_lines("my_file.txt", 2)
```

In academic papers, an argument is a statement or claim that is supported by evidence. The evidence can be in the form of facts, statistics, expert opinions, or personal experiences. For example, the following is an argument from an academic paper:↳

- The use of social media has increased significantly in recent years.
- This increase has been accompanied by a decrease in face-to-face interaction.
- Therefore, social media is contributing to the decline of social interaction.

The argument is supported by two pieces of evidence: the first is a fact (the increase in social media use), and the second is an expert opinion (the decrease in face-to-face interaction).↳

The main difference between the two meanings of "argument" is that in programming, an argument is a piece of data that is passed to a function, while in academic papers, an argument is a statement or claim that is supported by evidence.↳

Here is a table summarizing the two meanings of "argument":↳

|Meaning|Programming|Academic papers|
|---|---|---|
|Definition|A piece of data that is passed to a function|A statement or claim that is supported by evidence|
|Example|The first argument to the `print_lines()` function is the name of the file to print.|The argument that social media is contributing to the decline of social interaction is supported by two pieces of evidence: the increase in social media use and the decrease in face-to-face interaction.|
