Rate Distortion Curve 反应了压缩效率 (compression efficiency),  说明能够在无损压缩的基础上对数据进行多少压缩

rate-distortion curve
This curve shows the trade-off between the rate (or size) of the compressed file and the distortion (or loss of quality) introduced by the compression process. 
该曲线显示了压缩文件的速率（或大小）与压缩过程中引入的失真（或质量损失）之间的权衡(trade-off)
