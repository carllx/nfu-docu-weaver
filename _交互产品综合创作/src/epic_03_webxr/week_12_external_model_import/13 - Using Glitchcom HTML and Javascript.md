00:00:01,160 --> 00:00:01,920
Hello

2
00:00:02,420 --> 00:00:13,020
in this video we are going to talk a little bit about glitch dot com and how to get started making your own application using HTML and JavaScript

3
00:00:13,290 --> 00:00:15,560
So glitch dot com is

4
00:00:17,820 --> 00:00:19,420
A requirement entirely in the browser

5
00:00:19,420 --> 00:00:20,380
And it's cloud based

6
00:00:20,390 --> 00:00:23,160
so you can share code with other people

7
00:00:23,740 --> 00:00:25,700
Andlook your time

8
00:00:25,880 --> 00:00:30,830
So there are a couple of important elements for CLT dot com

9
00:00:33,740 --> 00:00:37,990
If you're looking at this page and this exact project

10
00:00:39,790 --> 00:00:41,440
you are the P Url dash

11
00:00:41,450 --> 00:00:44,650
a framed dash example From the Url

12
00:00:45,580 --> 00:00:51,540
you might have the option to remix this project that you see here on the top right corner

13
00:00:52,670 --> 00:00:59,300
You can also access it by going to the drop down menu here and selecting Remix

14
00:01:00,220 --> 00:01:05,000
which will allow you to edit your own version of this project

15
00:01:06,270 --> 00:01:07,540
And if you create an account

16
00:01:07,630 --> 00:01:12,580
you can keep that project for later on to access again

17
00:01:12,670 --> 00:01:13,470
access it again

18
00:01:13,470 --> 00:01:14,570
and edit it further

19
00:01:15,270 --> 00:01:23,120
You also see the different files associated with the project here

20
00:01:24,060 --> 00:01:25,650
And most importantly

21
00:01:26,250 --> 00:01:27,260
you have this

22
00:01:29,370 --> 00:01:36,490
Show option of hitting the top in which you can open a new tab to preview your project

23
00:01:39,070 --> 00:01:40,600
On the deployed website

24
00:01:41,700 --> 00:01:52,500
or you can see it next to the code in the same window and see it updated in real time

25
00:01:53,550 --> 00:02:05,340
So glitch dot com will take your edits and it will redeploy the website every time you make any edits to your actual file

26
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:08,040
To give you example of that

27
00:02:09,300 --> 00:02:10,910
let me change the header file

28
00:02:12,750 --> 00:02:13,710
do something else

29
00:02:14,220 --> 00:02:15,660
maybe like hello world

30
00:02:17,170 --> 00:02:20,700
I don't see that it refreshes it in real time

31
00:02:20,950 --> 00:02:28,120
And you can share this website with everyone else by using this Url and

32
00:02:30,890 --> 00:02:39,480
It works just like you might with the developer environment on your own computer without all the setup that you will have to go through

33
00:02:42,940 --> 00:02:45,460
And so that said

34
00:02:45,470 --> 00:02:50,090
let's talk a little bit about HTML or JavaScript

35
00:02:50,600 --> 00:02:56,750
So what we are seeing right now is our index dot h table file

36
00:02:57,390 --> 00:02:59,030
And HTML

37
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:01,620
or hypertext markup language

38
00:03:02,970 --> 00:03:12,010
is the piece of web development that defines the actual content you would find on the web page

39
00:03:12,580 --> 00:03:17,130
So it gives the content and the structure

40
00:03:18,250 --> 00:03:21,180
whereas you use your JavaScript

41
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:24,870
And as you see here

42
00:03:24,870 --> 00:03:33,310
your style docs is to define styling and the functionality that it might come with

43
00:03:34,770 --> 00:03:51,310
So you can have save HTML file and change this functionality or change the styling of it to have the web page to be displayed entirely in an entirely different phase and

44
00:03:55,370 --> 00:03:59,390
So we have a series of tags

45
00:04:00,020 --> 00:04:09,910
So every HTML page has to have this HTML tag as the leading pay tag to start with

46
00:04:10,440 --> 00:04:13,160
And everything else fades inside of that

47
00:04:14,570 --> 00:04:16,600
And then you see your head

48
00:04:17,780 --> 00:04:23,720
So the head is where you specify things like metadata

49
00:04:25,100 --> 00:04:28,040
things like the title of the web page

50
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:31,670
So you can see it up here in this other tab

51
00:04:32,340 --> 00:04:36,020
So this is title for the tab

52
00:04:36,550 --> 00:04:41,480
And as well as linking other scripts to it

53
00:04:41,820 --> 00:04:43,640
other style sheets

54
00:04:44,580 --> 00:04:47,700
and any other type of

55
00:04:50,060 --> 00:04:53,780
Content or assets that you might want to include

56
00:04:54,540 --> 00:04:58,420
This would go in the hit file or in the head tags

57
00:05:01,010 --> 00:05:02,870
And then we have the body tag

58
00:05:03,820 --> 00:05:10,330
And the body tag is where the actual content of the web page goes

59
00:05:11,560 --> 00:05:18,370
And so you can go to WC schools

60
00:05:18,510 --> 00:05:19,530
I highly recommend it

61
00:05:19,540 --> 00:05:22,790
a great website to tell you more about HTML

62
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:30,130
And JavaScript development and see what different types of tags are out there

63
00:05:31,650 --> 00:05:34,040
But using a frame

64
00:05:34,040 --> 00:05:37,210
we will talk more about the specific tags

65
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:40,090
So for the time being

66
00:05:40,140 --> 00:05:42,080
let's just give you some examples

67
00:05:42,220 --> 00:05:44,480
So you see this H1 tag

68
00:05:45,030 --> 00:05:49,210
which finds the header at the level 1

69
00:05:50,790 --> 00:05:58,190
We can add something like H2 to be another header

70
00:05:58,250 --> 00:06:01,760
And we can put how did

71
00:06:05,560 --> 00:06:11,790
And you will see that this header structure goes all the way down to H 6

72
00:06:14,140 --> 00:06:17,060
Of various all nights in size

73
00:06:20,330 --> 00:06:20,700
Or

74
00:06:20,700 --> 00:06:21,060
you know

75
00:06:21,070 --> 00:06:21,930
most often

76
00:06:21,940 --> 00:06:25,290
if you're adding actual just text content

77
00:06:26,030 --> 00:06:30,070
you could use a paragraph tag or just P

78
00:06:33,380 --> 00:06:36,940
So you could add something like this is some text

79
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:42,010
And see that come up on the page as well

80
00:06:44,020 --> 00:06:45,590
And all this is defined

81
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:47,510
the styling of it

82
00:06:47,610 --> 00:06:48,960
by your CSS file

83
00:06:52,030 --> 00:06:55,250
We want your case as very much an A frame

84
00:06:55,250 --> 00:07:01,630
but if you are defining your own website for your own 2D website

85
00:07:02,280 --> 00:07:07,980
you do quite a bit of CSS and more to find that

86
00:07:14,750 --> 00:07:18,080
So now let's talk about JavaScript

87
00:07:20,640 --> 00:07:21,330
As the name implies

88
00:07:21,340 --> 00:07:24,320
like it's a scripting language

89
00:07:25,210 --> 00:07:29,630
so you probably both set it to Python

90
00:07:30,460 --> 00:07:37,740
but it's relatively simplistic and it's very loose typing

91
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:42,990
which can be beneficial for rapidly writing code

92
00:07:43,410 --> 00:07:44,890
prototyping things

93
00:07:46,520 --> 00:07:48,780
but it can get dangerous as well

94
00:07:50,320 --> 00:08:02,220
You can have unexpected behavior that would happen very quickly because the language itself doesn't do straight enforcement for you

95
00:08:02,230 --> 00:08:10,550
It kind of assumes that the person who's writing it knows what's going on and

96
00:08:11,460 --> 00:08:11,830
there's

97
00:08:17,810 --> 00:08:19,580
It it has a relation to Java

98
00:08:19,920 --> 00:08:21,770
so if you are interested

99
00:08:22,150 --> 00:08:23,410
it has the relation to Ja​‌​‌​​‌‌​​‌‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌​​‌‌​​‌‌​​‌‌​​‌‌​​​‌​​‌‌​​‌‌​​‌‌‌​‌‌​​‌‌‌‌‌‌​​‌‌​‌​‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌​‌‌​​​‌‌‌‌‌‌​​‌‌​‌‌‌​​‌‌​‌​‌​​‌‌‌​‌‌​​‌‌​​​‌​​‌‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌​‌‌‌​​‌‌​​​‌​​‌‌‌​​‌‌‌​‌​‌​‌​​‌‌​‌​‌​​‌‌‌​​‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌​​​‌‌‌​‌‌​​‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌​​‌‌‌​‌‌​​‌‌​‌‌​​​‌‌​​‌‌​​‌‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌​‌​‌‌‌​‌​‌‌​​​‌‌‌​​‌​​‌‌‌‌‌‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌​‌‌​​​‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌‌​​‌‌‌​‌​‌‌‌​​‌‌​‌​‌‌‌​‌‌​‌‌​​‌‌‌‌‌​​​‌‌​‌‌‌​​‌‌​​​‌​​‌‌​​‌‌​​‌‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌​‌‌‌​​‌‌‌‌‌​​​‌‌​‌‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌​‌‌​​‌‌​‌​‌‌‌​‌‌​​‌‌‌​‌​‌​‌​​‌‌​‌‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌​‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌​‌‌​​​‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌‌​​‌‌‌​‌​‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌‌​​‌‌​‌‌‌‌‌​‌​‌​‌​​‌‌​‌​‌​​‌‌​‌​‌‌‌​‌‌​​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌‌​​‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌​​‌‌‌​​‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌​‌‌​​​‌‌‌​​‌‌‌​‌​‌‌‌‌‌​‌​‌‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌​‌‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌​‌‌​​‌‌​​‌‌​​‌‌​‌​‌​​‌‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌​‌​‌‌‌​‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌‌​‌‌​​‌‌‌​​‌​​‌‌​‌‌​​​‌‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌​‌​‌‌‌​‌​‌‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌​​​‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌​​‌​​‌‌​‌​‌‌‌​‌​‌‌‌​​‌‌​‌‌​​​‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌​‌‌‌​​‌‌‌‌‌​​​‌‌​‌​‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌‌​​‌‌‌​‌​‌‌‌‌‌​‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌‌​​‌‌‌‌‌‌​​‌‌​‌‌‌​​‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌‌​​‌​​‌‌​​‌‌​​‌‌‌​​‌​​‌‌‌​​‌​​‌‌​‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌va

100
00:08:24,010 --> 00:08:27,460
So if you want to know how it became JavaScript

101
00:08:27,470 --> 00:08:31,270
you can Google that and you'll get to know about some interesting history

102
00:08:32,230 --> 00:08:37,070
So let's go over some of the basics of JavaScript

103
00:08:37,550 --> 00:08:41,620
So the first thing you see here is the console dot log

104
00:08:42,210 --> 00:08:48,030
And this is the closest that you have to a print statement in JavaScript

105
00:08:48,690 --> 00:08:52,070
So you see console dot log high here

106
00:08:53,040 --> 00:09:00,420
And if you go over to kind of the actual proper web page then

107
00:09:02,760 --> 00:09:03,740
The fresh air

108
00:09:04,670 --> 00:09:05,490
And we'll see

109
00:09:11,820 --> 00:09:15,620
You can just access it by right click on a page and clicking Inspect element

110
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:21,240
So

111
00:09:24,270 --> 00:09:26,200
Yeahso this is how you access the console

112
00:09:28,330 --> 00:09:29,530
So now let's

113
00:09:30,550 --> 00:09:31,830
look at the types for JavaScript

114
00:09:32,030 --> 00:09:36,550
So JavaScript has very few types

115
00:09:36,550 --> 00:09:37,100
actually

116
00:09:43,140 --> 00:09:44,670
So it has numbers

117
00:09:44,680 --> 00:09:46,270
it has strings

118
00:09:46,820 --> 00:09:48,990
it has Booleans

119
00:09:49,830 --> 00:09:53,480
it has a nudality

120
00:09:53,550 --> 00:09:58,530
and then there it also has arrays and objects

121
00:09:59,770 --> 00:10:01,060
So arrays

122
00:10:01,060 --> 00:10:01,940
you can see

123
00:10:02,150 --> 00:10:06,140
are formatted here by using brackets

124
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:19,320
What's interesting about JavaScript errors is that they can actually continue a variety of different types within the same

125
00:10:20,260 --> 00:10:23,260
So the same adequate have numbers

126
00:10:23,270 --> 00:10:26,970
stringsand other data types

127
00:10:31,520 --> 00:10:37,520
So that's one of the things that you'll have to look out for pertaining to the dangers of JavaScript

128
00:10:37,520 --> 00:10:39,950
So you will have to know what's in the array

129
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:43,840
You can't assume what type of data you have in that array

130
00:10:47,410 --> 00:10:56,280
You have to be knowledgeable of what you're expected to have in that area

131
00:11:02,190 --> 00:11:02,620
So

132
00:11:05,960 --> 00:11:08,040
Based upon what operations you want to do for it

133
00:11:08,500 --> 00:11:13,950
And then you have objects which are rectified by these curly braces

134
00:11:13,960 --> 00:11:16,100
So you have the

135
00:11:18,470 --> 00:11:22,650
Property objects like name and then colon

136
00:11:22,660 --> 00:11:25,400
and then the actual value for those properties

137
00:11:26,700 --> 00:11:29,360
So we just have two strings here

138
00:11:32,280 --> 00:11:35,310
So you can see arrays

139
00:11:35,520 --> 00:11:36,440
JavaScript or

140
00:11:38,970 --> 00:11:40,250
Zero index

141
00:11:42,650 --> 00:11:43,700
As you expect

142
00:11:44,610 --> 00:11:51,460
you just do the variable name followed by the brackets and then the index you want to access it

143
00:11:53,280 --> 00:11:55,400
And then with

144
00:11:59,020 --> 00:11:59,500
We have

145
00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:07,420
To access it

146
00:12:07,490 --> 00:12:11,540
you can just use dot and then the name of portable property or to access

147
00:12:13,550 --> 00:12:19,440
So you can see we logged Red and John

148
00:12:23,850 --> 00:12:31,630
So that being the index number four of AB and John being the dot name for the object C

149
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,560
And one thing we need to talk about here

150
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:45,430
that's some here in JavaScript is

151
00:12:48,970 --> 00:12:49,980
Instead of defining variables

152
00:12:55,930 --> 00:12:56,670
Instead of using Word

153
00:12:56,970 --> 00:13:03,260
there's been a new way of defining them or assigning them called let

154
00:13:04,350 --> 00:13:13,580
And the significance of this is that when a variable is assigned with ver

155
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:16,840
it's assigned to global scope

156
00:13:17,170 --> 00:13:18,850
And what that means is that

157
00:13:20,950 --> 00:13:24,780
It's that same value for the whole duration of the script

158
00:13:28,040 --> 00:13:29,380
But using Let

159
00:13:29,880 --> 00:13:43,180
you can assign variable within a specific block of code and it does start propagate outside of that block of code

160
00:13:43,420 --> 00:13:46,790
So you kind of have an example here to show that

161
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:47,360
right

162
00:13:47,950 --> 00:13:51,550
So we assigned x 2

163
00:13:51,550 --> 00:13:53,580
1 at the top of our script here

164
00:13:54,190 --> 00:13:59,530
And we are printing out the value of x

165
00:13:59,530 --> 00:14:00,540
which should be one

166
00:14:01,810 --> 00:14:03,800
And then we have a for loop

167
00:14:03,860 --> 00:14:08,920
So you can see that for loop is relatively simple JavaScript

168
00:14:10,540 --> 00:14:12,050
It's just

169
00:14:12,130 --> 00:14:12,410
you know

170
00:14:14,690 --> 00:14:16,440
As you expect with a for loop

171
00:14:16,450 --> 00:14:17,510
so it's y

172
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:21,500
x equals to 0x less than 5x plus plus

173
00:14:23,990 --> 00:14:26,120
To do the arbitration

174
00:14:28,910 --> 00:14:36,040
So we are using var here to assign our x value to initialize this for loop

175
00:14:38,690 --> 00:14:42,020
We are just doing some random value addition here

176
00:14:47,770 --> 00:14:55,030
And we do print out the value of x after wave accomplished this for loop tight

177
00:14:55,030 --> 00:14:59,480
So if you have done five iterations

178
00:15:00,150 --> 00:15:02,070
are you doing less than 5

179
00:15:02,070 --> 00:15:04,790
So we're going to assume that

180
00:15:07,020 --> 00:15:07,430
X

181
00:15:07,430 --> 00:15:09,120
but the end of the snoop is going to 5

182
00:15:12,540 --> 00:15:14,700
But then we will reset x to one here

183
00:15:16,750 --> 00:15:16,970
Which

184
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:23,420
We'll set fire to a global scope again

185
00:15:23,860 --> 00:15:27,210
And then in the second for loop

186
00:15:27,210 --> 00:15:28,780
we'll use let instead

187
00:15:30,280 --> 00:15:38,030
And what that means is that lead is only inside the scopes of this for loop

188
00:15:38,940 --> 00:15:43,590
So x is gonna be incremented again

189
00:15:43,900 --> 00:15:46,650
but because it's on the inside of this

190
00:15:46,850 --> 00:15:48,160
the scope of this block

191
00:15:49,230 --> 00:15:53,630
it won't propagate to the final version

192
00:15:53,850 --> 00:15:56,690
the final log statement here

193
00:15:58,060 --> 00:16:04,940
So what we should expect is that x at the end is still going to be well

194
00:16:05,470 --> 00:16:07,660
because that's the global scope of x

195
00:16:08,660 --> 00:16:13,920
and x within this block was only changed to 5

196
00:16:15,570 --> 00:16:22,100
but then it was flocked back to the global scope because of the were outside of it

197
00:16:25,230 --> 00:16:29,370
And so let's go back to our script here

198
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:32,690
And we uncomment that and refresh it

199
00:16:32,970 --> 00:16:37,740
We see exactly what we are expecting

200
00:16:57,140 --> 00:17:02,770
So this is useful and obviously a for loop

201
00:17:02,780 --> 00:17:09,530
but it's also especially useful to make your for loops aren't overriding our values

202
00:17:11,530 --> 00:17:25,330
but in a greater context because you might have more complex scripts or you don't want to be changing the global scope of variables because of the

203
00:17:28,800 --> 00:17:32,450
Because of the blocks of code that will be added in the future

204
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:35,330
so is very useful

205
00:17:37,650 --> 00:17:41,420
Way of doing assignments to variables

206
00:17:41,870 --> 00:17:53,440
And we will see that in the A frame videos in the later on in the course to make sure that we are not changing global scope

207
00:17:54,150 --> 00:17:58,470
2 variables within your own sections of code

208
00:18:01,300 --> 00:18:07,040
And the last thing that I want to talk about with JavaScript here is that defining functions

209
00:18:07,790 --> 00:18:09,010
So it's

210
00:18:09,020 --> 00:18:13,390
againrelatively simple to define a function in JavaScript

211
00:18:13,830 --> 00:18:16,330
just the syntax of function

212
00:18:17,490 --> 00:18:19,100
then the name of the function

213
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:23,690
what parameters that should be passed into it

214
00:18:24,170 --> 00:18:25,810
and then the console do

215
00:18:26,380 --> 00:18:28,430
or something that happens inside of the function

216
00:18:30,660 --> 00:18:33,390
So we just do a long statement here

217
00:18:33,460 --> 00:18:36,940
which could we could also do a return statement

218
00:18:40,740 --> 00:18:42,550
You could just to return

219
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:43,330
you know

220
00:18:43,330 --> 00:18:43,520
whatever

221
00:18:45,620 --> 00:18:46,720
Any information you want

222
00:18:50,810 --> 00:18:51,480
Thereno

223
00:18:51,850 --> 00:18:54,440
againbecause of the way typing works in JavaScript

224
00:18:56,100 --> 00:19:02,590
there's no guarantee if the type that you're gon na get back from a function

225
00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:06,180
Andyou know

226
00:19:06,190 --> 00:19:11,050
a function based on what is to encode return different types

227
00:19:11,060 --> 00:19:11,830
different times

228
00:19:13,450 --> 00:19:15,500
So again

229
00:19:15,520 --> 00:19:23,940
that's something to be careful about whether functions to make sure that the parameters it is passing or what you are expecting

230
00:19:27,180 --> 00:19:28,360
And what do you expect so

231
00:19:31,730 --> 00:19:33,550
So we have an example here

232
00:19:33,960 --> 00:19:37,590
parsing in two numbers to this function

233
00:19:38,600 --> 00:19:41,690
And the expectation should be that if he

234
00:19:43,770 --> 00:19:46,420
Refresh it with the result is 7

235
00:19:49,640 --> 00:19:58,460
An important thing to note here about numbers JavaScript is that there is only one number type

236
00:20:00,920 --> 00:20:02,480
There'sthere's only one number time

237
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:07,060
There's two integers or floats or doubles

238
00:20:07,310 --> 00:20:08,960
It's just all one number type

239
00:20:10,290 --> 00:20:19,160
So you can do things like half decimals or or node decimals

240
00:20:19,650 --> 00:20:22,040
Everything is assumed to be a number

241
00:20:22,830 --> 00:20:27,200
so you can just add 3．124

242
00:20:28,290 --> 00:20:32,160
and likewise what you expect is 7．1

243
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:37,960
All numbers are numbers

244
00:20:37,970 --> 00:20:41,500
There's no integer decimal separation here

245
00:20:44,650 --> 00:20:49,810
So this has just been a high level description of how JavaScript works

246
00:20:50,680 --> 00:20:52,910
We'll see a lot more later on tutorials

247
00:20:55,520 --> 00:20:59,930
But now we're going to start talking about a frames specifically in the next video
