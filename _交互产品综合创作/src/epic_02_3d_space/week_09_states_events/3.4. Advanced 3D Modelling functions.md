1
00:00:01,290 --> 00:00:02,450
So in this chapter

2
00:00:02,450 --> 00:00:06,400
we talk about some more advanced 3D modeling tools

3
00:00:06,410 --> 00:00:13,600
So you guys already got to know the more basic types of shapes here in the designer

4
00:00:13,690 --> 00:00:20,100
but it should be clear that you can't build everything right off those default shapes here

5
00:00:20,620 --> 00:00:24,640
So we will introduce some more advanced shape building tools here

6
00:00:25,520 --> 00:00:29,520
And to show you guys the 3D modeling tools

7
00:00:29,850 --> 00:00:32,780
I will place a cube on our base plane here

8
00:00:34,580 --> 00:00:39,050
You can make it a little bit bigger while holding option and shift

9
00:00:41,010 --> 00:00:43,330
and then move it a little bit up here maybe

10
00:00:44,980 --> 00:00:46,300
And on the right side here

11
00:00:46,300 --> 00:00:49,750
I will remove the corners for now

12
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:52,130
And also our base plane

13
00:00:52,130 --> 00:00:54,650
we don't have to use this one right now

14
00:00:54,650 --> 00:00:57,580
So I will just hide it from the scene

15
00:00:58,620 --> 00:00:59,950
And then you can click

16
00:01:00,100 --> 00:01:02,000
click on your QP on the left sidebar

17
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:05,240
or you can directly click it here in the view

18
00:01:05,500 --> 00:01:11,150
So what we are going to do right now is we again click on the move and edit button

19
00:01:11,500 --> 00:01:12,840
edit button here

20
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:20,600
and then you already see that that the cube is now looking a bit strange now

21
00:01:21,350 --> 00:01:26,560
but we can change this now by decreasing the subdivision modifier

22
00:01:27,110 --> 00:01:28,100
But in this tutorial

23
00:01:28,130 --> 00:01:30,650
I actually want to do the opposite

24
00:01:30,650 --> 00:01:35,090
So I will want to increase the subdivision modifier here

25
00:01:35,740 --> 00:01:48,410
And now you see that that it appears as a the right now and now you see on the top side here that there are some options to choose from

26
00:01:49,760 --> 00:01:50,390
And we

27
00:01:51,480 --> 00:01:55,710
I will guide you through the different functions here

28
00:01:56,170 --> 00:01:59,920
So first we talk about the three first options here

29
00:02:00,040 --> 00:02:01,230
So for example

30
00:02:01,230 --> 00:02:04,410
if you have about this first option here

31
00:02:04,410 --> 00:02:05,210
you see the face

32
00:02:05,530 --> 00:02:12,640
And what this simply does is that you can actually select one of the facing sides here

33
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:13,980
For instance

34
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:15,820
if you click on this side here

35
00:02:16,020 --> 00:02:21,530
you can drag this side however you want

36
00:02:24,290 --> 00:02:26,900
I will revert it for now

37
00:02:27,490 --> 00:02:29,240
Then you have the second option

38
00:02:29,240 --> 00:02:31,600
which is selecting an edge

39
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:34,570
So you guys see maybe the difference here

40
00:02:34,570 --> 00:02:38,520
So I can't select the front here again

41
00:02:38,530 --> 00:02:41,160
I just can select the edges right now

42
00:02:41,620 --> 00:02:45,240
And if I click here on one of the edges

43
00:02:45,530 --> 00:02:52,120
you now can change the edge in every direction you want

44
00:02:57,760 --> 00:03:00,780
And then the last option is actually the vertex

45
00:03:00,790 --> 00:03:03,740
So you can't anymore select the edge here

46
00:03:03,740 --> 00:03:06,990
You can just select a single vertex

47
00:03:07,940 --> 00:03:10,080
So if I click here on one vertex

48
00:03:10,540 --> 00:03:17,400
it just moves the vertex in the direction I'm choosing

49
00:03:26,450 --> 00:03:34,930
And what you can also do is you can select multiple vertexes or multiple edges or multiple faces like this

50
00:03:34,940 --> 00:03:38,960
So you can just can drag across here the vertices

51
00:03:39,380 --> 00:03:43,690
and then you can move around all the vertexes

52
00:03:43,770 --> 00:03:44,920
vertices selected

53
00:03:45,650 --> 00:03:46,540
Or for example

54
00:03:46,750 --> 00:03:50,210
you can also select multiple address here

55
00:03:50,490 --> 00:03:51,170
So for example

56
00:03:51,380 --> 00:03:52,850
this one's here

57
00:03:53,060 --> 00:03:57,180
Then you can move the group of edges around

58
00:03:58,130 --> 00:04:08,980
or you can also just select multiple bill faces here and then also move them around or rotate them

59
00:04:11,300 --> 00:04:13,810
Twist them like anything you want

60
00:04:18,130 --> 00:04:22,430
What you can also do is you can not just drag across the sea here

61
00:04:22,570 --> 00:04:27,280
but you can also click option and shift here

62
00:04:27,290 --> 00:04:36,900
And then you can select multiple faces or go to peel edges or multiple uticensis

63
00:04:42,190 --> 00:04:43,420
Then we come to the next part

64
00:04:43,430 --> 00:04:46,140
which is the modeling part

65
00:04:46,490 --> 00:04:47,710
So for instance

66
00:04:47,710 --> 00:04:50,900
we can now go on the right side here

67
00:04:50,900 --> 00:04:54,050
So these are just the selections of the edges

68
00:04:54,050 --> 00:04:54,820
the vertices

69
00:04:54,820 --> 00:04:55,680
and the faces

70
00:04:56,120 --> 00:04:57,590
And now on the right side here

71
00:04:57,590 --> 00:04:58,980
you see another option

72
00:04:58,980 --> 00:05:00,680
which is called extrude

73
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:03,370
So if I activate now the extrusion mode

74
00:05:03,990 --> 00:05:05,310
and for instance

75
00:05:05,640 --> 00:05:07,980
choosing now this side here

76
00:05:08,440 --> 00:05:10,030
you see that it's selected right now

77
00:05:10,030 --> 00:05:13,720
And you also see a little blue dot here

78
00:05:14,070 --> 00:05:15,630
And if I click on the blue dot

79
00:05:16,280 --> 00:05:20,460
you see now that I can actually insert a new

80
00:05:21,130 --> 00:05:22,210
a new layer here

81
00:05:22,410 --> 00:05:26,630
So the shape is getting transformed in this direction

82
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:31,940
And I can do this for every of the faces here now

83
00:05:32,970 --> 00:05:33,980
So for instance

84
00:05:33,980 --> 00:05:35,640
let's do this also

85
00:05:38,140 --> 00:05:40,350
And then the top 1 as well

86
00:05:50,290 --> 00:05:53,080
And now I don't really like the looking of this

87
00:05:53,090 --> 00:05:54,730
so I will do this again

88
00:05:55,950 --> 00:05:57,180
clicking on the face

89
00:05:57,610 --> 00:05:59,020
face side here again

90
00:05:59,190 --> 00:06:09,380
And then I will make a little one in front of this face side so it looks a bit more edgy

91
00:06:11,760 --> 00:06:13,620
So this is like a common

92
00:06:14,280 --> 00:06:17,030
common shape type that you see often in spline

93
00:06:17,780 --> 00:06:21,820
And this is it for the first option

94
00:06:21,820 --> 00:06:23,130
Here is the extrusion mode

95
00:06:24,060 --> 00:06:26,740
Then you have the inset mode

96
00:06:26,740 --> 00:06:30,390
So if I activate the inset mode now

97
00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:37,160
and for instance I'm clicking on this facing side here

98
00:06:38,130 --> 00:06:39,770
and again you have already

99
00:06:39,830 --> 00:06:42,540
you have again the blue dot here visible

100
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:49,300
And if I click on the blue dot here and move it forwards or backwards

101
00:06:49,330 --> 00:06:51,010
you now see what it does

102
00:06:51,120 --> 00:07:01,360
So it actually makes the facing rectangle smaller or bigger depending on in which direction I'm pulling the trigger here

103
00:07:01,380 --> 00:07:09,050
So I will make it a little bit tinier here and what you can do with it is

104
00:07:09,100 --> 00:07:10,030
for instance

105
00:07:10,030 --> 00:07:14,900
you can now you can activate the extrusion mode here

106
00:07:14,950 --> 00:07:16,170
and then you have

107
00:07:16,710 --> 00:07:20,400
you can select this little face here

108
00:07:21,320 --> 00:07:22,160
and then again

109
00:07:22,170 --> 00:07:24,990
you can extrude it

110
00:07:25,300 --> 00:07:31,100
but in the direction so you can make a hole or something

111
00:07:32,060 --> 00:07:34,720
That's what I'm going to do right now

112
00:07:37,020 --> 00:07:42,650
And I will do this for all of the facing sides here so we can

113
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:46,740
Make it a little bit big

114
00:07:47,130 --> 00:07:48,440
Tinier here

115
00:07:49,480 --> 00:07:51,310
Going back to the extrusion mode

116
00:07:54,510 --> 00:08:00,460
And pulling a hole here inside and also for th​‌​‌​​‌‌​​‌‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌​‌‌‌​​‌‌​​‌‌​​‌‌​‌‌‌​​‌‌​​‌‌​​‌‌​‌​‌​​‌‌‌​​‌‌‌​‌​‌​‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌​‌‌​​​‌‌‌‌‌‌​​‌‌​‌​‌‌‌​‌​‌​‌​​‌‌‌​‌‌​​‌‌​​​‌​​‌‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌‌​​‌‌‌​‌‌​​‌‌‌​‌​​​‌​​‌‌​​​‌​​‌‌​‌​‌​​‌‌​‌​‌​​‌‌‌​​‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌​​​‌‌‌​‌‌​​‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌​​‌‌​​‌‌​​‌‌​‌‌​​​‌‌​​‌‌​​‌‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌​‌​‌‌‌​‌​‌‌‌‌‌​‌‌​​‌​​‌‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌​‌‌​​​‌‌​‌‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌‌​​‌‌‌​‌​‌‌‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌​​​‌‌‌‌‌​​​‌‌​​‌‌​​‌‌​​​‌​​‌‌​​‌‌​​‌‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌​‌‌‌​​‌‌‌‌‌​​​‌‌​‌‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌​‌‌​​‌‌​‌​‌‌‌​‌​​​‌​​‌‌​‌​‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌​‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌​‌‌​​​‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌​‌‌​​​‌‌​‌​‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌​‌‌‌‌‌​‌​‌​‌​​‌‌​‌​‌​​‌‌​‌​‌‌‌​‌‌​​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌‌​​‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌​​‌‌‌​​‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌​‌‌​​​‌‌‌​​‌‌‌​‌​‌‌‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌​​​‌​​‌‌‌​‌‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌​‌‌​​‌‌​​‌‌​​‌‌‌‌‌‌​​‌‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌​‌​‌‌‌​‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌​‌‌​​​‌‌​​​‌​​‌‌‌​​‌​​‌‌​‌‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌​‌‌‌​​‌‌​‌‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌​​​‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌​​‌​​‌‌​‌​‌‌‌​‌​‌‌‌​​‌‌​‌‌​​​‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌​‌‌‌​​‌‌‌‌‌​​​‌‌​‌​‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌‌​​‌‌‌​‌​‌‌‌‌‌​‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌‌​​‌‌‌‌‌‌​​‌‌​‌‌‌​​‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌‌​​‌​​‌‌​​‌‌​​‌‌‌​​‌​​‌‌‌​​‌​​‌‌​‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌e top layer here

117
00:08:00,530 --> 00:08:01,190
So again

118
00:08:02,230 --> 00:08:03,190
in that mode

119
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:09,670
Make the facing side a little bit tinier

120
00:08:10,950 --> 00:08:12,820
Going back to the extrusion mode

121
00:08:14,740 --> 00:08:18,430
and then drill a hole inside of the shape

122
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:22,640
So

123
00:08:22,640 --> 00:08:25,060
and then you have the third mode here

124
00:08:25,060 --> 00:08:26,670
which is called the loop cut

125
00:08:26,870 --> 00:08:28,240
So with the loop cut

126
00:08:28,250 --> 00:08:33,300
you can actually add some edges inside of the existing shape

127
00:08:33,460 --> 00:08:34,900
So for instance

128
00:08:35,350 --> 00:08:36,100
let's put

129
00:08:36,530 --> 00:08:38,860
let's put an edge here inside

130
00:08:38,870 --> 00:08:40,360
So you see now that it's

131
00:08:42,550 --> 00:08:45,360
Visible here in the red color

132
00:08:45,780 --> 00:08:47,100
And if I

133
00:08:47,110 --> 00:08:48,620
if I want to add now an edge

134
00:08:48,620 --> 00:08:50,390
I just can simply click on it

135
00:08:50,670 --> 00:08:55,510
And now one edge is created in the center now of this direction here

136
00:08:55,620 --> 00:08:59,950
And I can choose that I want to add more edges here

137
00:09:01,660 --> 00:09:03,680
I can hover on it again

138
00:09:04,510 --> 00:09:06,510
So adding an edge here

139
00:09:07,010 --> 00:09:08,520
adding an edge here

140
00:09:08,580 --> 00:09:09,720
maybe here again

141
00:09:13,250 --> 00:09:13,910
Againagain

142
00:09:13,930 --> 00:09:14,460
again

143
00:09:17,940 --> 00:09:19,930
And you see actually what it does

144
00:09:19,940 --> 00:09:23,990
So first we had a quiet round shape here

145
00:09:24,190 --> 00:09:27,600
And while adding some of the loop cuts

146
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:30,670
you're now moving the edges in the corner

147
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:34,810
And now you have a more edgy shape

148
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:36,050
And again

149
00:09:36,050 --> 00:09:37,350
just for clarification

150
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:43,350
you can still just move anything you want round

151
00:09:43,350 --> 00:09:44,440
So for example

152
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:49,370
I want to move this facing side now a little bit to this side

153
00:09:50,330 --> 00:09:55,560
or I want to move this edge now to this side

154
00:09:56,010 --> 00:09:58,340
You can do whatever you want here

155
00:09:58,580 --> 00:09:59,280
Or again

156
00:09:59,280 --> 00:10:04,940
you can also select multiple vertices here and move them around

157
00:10:05,640 --> 00:10:07,920
So you can play around with it here

158
00:10:07,930 --> 00:10:08,800
So again

159
00:10:08,900 --> 00:10:17,150
just the first three runs are the selecting tools and there remaining four ones are the main 3D modeling tools

160
00:10:18,390 --> 00:10:20,700
So this was just the first example

161
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:27,910
but we will make another example here to show you guys all the details about the 3D modeling tools

162
00:10:28,770 --> 00:10:31,470
I'm going to delete this old shape from now

163
00:10:32,100 --> 00:10:32,850
from now

164
00:10:32,860 --> 00:10:36,950
and we will make a cube again here

165
00:10:40,530 --> 00:10:45,110
And you can make a sharp here with the zero corner element here

166
00:10:45,130 --> 00:10:47,240
And then going to the smooth and edit

167
00:10:48,140 --> 00:10:49,260
So and again

168
00:10:49,260 --> 00:10:52,800
we will increase the subdivision modifier for now

169
00:10:53,510 --> 00:10:55,820
Soand I want

170
00:10:56,640 --> 00:10:59,710
I want to show you more details about the loop cut now

171
00:10:59,820 --> 00:11:02,940
So I will select the loop cut from here

172
00:11:03,960 --> 00:11:09,210
And then you see maybe more what the loop cut does

173
00:11:09,220 --> 00:11:12,740
So if I'm adding here in a loop cut

174
00:11:12,740 --> 00:11:18,480
you see that the address is actually moving out out of the box

175
00:11:19,170 --> 00:11:21,530
So you get a more edgy element

176
00:11:26,530 --> 00:11:32,470
And what you can also do is you can drag this edge by choosing the edge slide here

177
00:11:33,590 --> 00:11:36,520
I now added here in a loop cut

178
00:11:36,530 --> 00:11:40,900
And now I can actually drag this one up and down as I want

179
00:11:44,910 --> 00:11:47,100
And this is also a quite helpful feature

180
00:11:47,380 --> 00:11:48,130
So for instance

181
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:53,310
I can also drag this out of the box here

182
00:11:53,310 --> 00:11:56,680
So you get a little hole here

183
00:11:56,970 --> 00:12:00,500
which can be also useful in 3D modeling

184
00:12:01,860 --> 00:12:08,080
And that's basically what you can achieve when using the loop cut and the edge slide here

185
00:12:08,670 --> 00:12:17,290
So it may be a little tippie you can actually select some vertices or edges or facing sides here

186
00:12:17,970 --> 00:12:22,540
same as in creating shapes where you're holding command and shift

187
00:12:22,550 --> 00:12:26,860
You can maybe you notice you can hold command and shift

188
00:12:26,870 --> 00:12:29,980
and then the whole shape is extending similar

189
00:12:30,490 --> 00:12:36,570
Soand this feature you can also use here in the advanced modeling tools

190
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:42,010
So I've selected now all the vertices here on the top side

191
00:12:42,140 --> 00:12:45,440
And now if I'm holding command and shift

192
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:52,220
and now I'm clicking here on this little ball and move it inside

193
00:12:53,380 --> 00:13:00,050
outsidenow you see that all sides are exceeded and decreased similar

194
00:13:03,230 --> 00:13:04,410
So for instance

195
00:13:04,410 --> 00:13:07,770
I can also rotate it around here

196
00:13:07,780 --> 00:13:09,040
maybe also on this side

197
00:13:09,800 --> 00:13:12,170
So selecting all the vertices

198
00:13:12,180 --> 00:13:13,910
holding command and shift

199
00:13:14,450 --> 00:13:20,020
and then you can decrease or increase however you want the shape to look like

200
00:13:25,390 --> 00:13:28,060
So that's it for the four shaping models here

201
00:13:28,250 --> 00:13:30,930
And on the right side here

202
00:13:30,930 --> 00:13:34,870
now you have also just simple selection tool

203
00:13:35,350 --> 00:13:37,580
Then here you have the scalp mode

204
00:13:37,750 --> 00:13:41,420
which we talk about in another video

205
00:13:41,820 --> 00:13:47,220
And then here you have also some properties that you can change actually

206
00:13:47,220 --> 00:13:51,140
which affects the way that the 3D modeling tool works

207
00:13:51,730 --> 00:13:57,080
And to visualize how these properties affect the 3D modeling tool

208
00:13:57,160 --> 00:14:00,710
I will create a new cube

209
00:14:04,930 --> 00:14:10,710
So just place it here and make it a little bit bigger again

210
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:16,060
So reducing the corners

211
00:14:16,630 --> 00:14:17,890
And then again

212
00:14:17,890 --> 00:14:19,700
go in this move and edit mode

213
00:14:20,750 --> 00:14:23,580
I will now keep the cube as it is

214
00:14:23,590 --> 00:14:26,290
So without the subdivision modifier

215
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:32,150
And now what I'm going to do is I select the facing mode now here

216
00:14:32,540 --> 00:14:35,950
and I will select two of the sides here

217
00:14:36,150 --> 00:14:37,910
So by holding command and shift

218
00:14:37,910 --> 00:14:43,030
I can select the two sides here with a little bit here to this side

219
00:14:43,860 --> 00:14:48,010
And then you see the extrude in inset mode here

220
00:14:48,020 --> 00:14:53,010
So you can actually choose between a group or individual mode

221
00:14:53,180 --> 00:14:58,850
So when I'm going to extrude this shape now

222
00:14:59,020 --> 00:14:59,860
so again

223
00:15:00,010 --> 00:15:01,670
select both of the sides here

224
00:15:02,170 --> 00:15:03,650
and when I'm extruding

225
00:15:03,650 --> 00:15:09,240
now you see how this extrusion works in the group mode

226
00:15:10,110 --> 00:15:17,810
But if I redo this with the individual mode

227
00:15:18,030 --> 00:15:23,950
you now see that both of the shapes now are independent from each other

228
00:15:23,950 --> 00:15:27,840
so they're going in there specific direction

229
00:15:28,890 --> 00:15:29,630
So again

230
00:15:29,630 --> 00:15:31,360
this is the individual mode

231
00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:34,880
and when I'm changing to the group mode

232
00:15:35,620 --> 00:15:39,080
you see that they are getting extruded

233
00:15:41,200 --> 00:15:42,720
In a similar direction

234
00:15:43,290 --> 00:15:47,720
And the second thing you can change in the properties here is the extrude direction

235
00:15:49,540 --> 00:15:53,070
Againwe will select both of the sides here

236
00:15:54,670 --> 00:15:59,770
And now when you activate the drag mode and extrude it

237
00:15:59,770 --> 00:16:00,310
you know

238
00:16:00,450 --> 00:16:06,270
see that it's actually extruded in the direction of my cursor

239
00:16:07,160 --> 00:16:10,240
So if I redo this now with a normal mode

240
00:16:11,930 --> 00:16:13,630
you see the difference here

241
00:16:19,980 --> 00:16:23,990
So then you have to choose between the selection properties here

242
00:16:23,990 --> 00:16:24,740
So for this

243
00:16:24,740 --> 00:16:28,650
nowI will again increase the subdivision layer here

244
00:16:28,660 --> 00:16:33,400
So it gets transformed to a cube

245
00:16:33,840 --> 00:16:35,020
to the sphere here

246
00:16:35,520 --> 00:16:36,330
So next up

247
00:16:36,460 --> 00:16:38,450
we have the selection mode here

248
00:16:38,450 --> 00:16:40,870
So for instance

249
00:16:41,760 --> 00:16:44,740
if I select and drag across here

250
00:16:46,010 --> 00:16:48,420
you see now that some of the Pos are deleted now

251
00:16:48,420 --> 00:16:51,520
And if I'm choosing to delete these Pos

252
00:16:51,660 --> 00:17:00,460
maybe you now see that also the behind the parts I actually have selected are also getting delete it

253
00:17:00,470 --> 00:17:02,680
And if you don't want that

254
00:17:02,700 --> 00:17:07,410
you can actually change the property here to just front

255
00:17:07,830 --> 00:17:12,680
So if you now select some edges here and remove it

256
00:17:13,200 --> 00:17:24,920
you just have a hole from the Pos that are that were selected now and the Pos behind the selected pods are still there

257
00:17:26,220 --> 00:17:28,400
So we do this again

258
00:17:30,800 --> 00:17:35,250
Then you can also choose between the selection mode here

259
00:17:35,250 --> 00:17:35,960
So for now

260
00:17:35,960 --> 00:17:38,740
it's just if you drag across here

261
00:17:38,740 --> 00:17:40,850
you selecting the boxes

262
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:43,280
but you also have a paint mode now

263
00:17:43,280 --> 00:17:45,900
So if I'll select the paint paint mode

264
00:17:45,910 --> 00:17:54,150
now you can actually paint by clicking your mouse and hovering across the shape

265
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:57,780
and then all the parts are getting selected

266
00:17:58,950 --> 00:18:02,170
And then the last part actually is the whole filling mode

267
00:18:02,170 --> 00:18:03,810
So for instance

268
00:18:04,460 --> 00:18:08,720
I will draw a shot hole inside of here

269
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:09,960
So delete

270
00:18:09,960 --> 00:18:10,810
delete this one

271
00:18:12,440 --> 00:18:14,460
And what I forgot to talk about

272
00:18:14,470 --> 00:18:20,080
you can actually fill holes by selecting the edges of the hole so

273
00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:22,640
A little bit

274
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:27,690
So if you select all the edges around the hole here

275
00:18:33,060 --> 00:18:35,690
You know that this option here pops up

276
00:18:35,700 --> 00:18:37,240
which is called fill a hole

277
00:18:37,240 --> 00:18:38,730
And if I click on it

278
00:18:39,250 --> 00:18:42,680
you now see that the field that the hole is getting filled

279
00:18:43,290 --> 00:18:47,030
But you have different properties to choose from

280
00:18:47,030 --> 00:18:51,570
So you can choose if you want the whole skating filled

281
00:18:51,570 --> 00:18:52,550
flatcurved

282
00:18:52,560 --> 00:18:53,690
or engine

283
00:18:55,430 --> 00:18:56,600
And for example

284
00:18:56,600 --> 00:18:57,900
I can do it flat now

285
00:19:00,070 --> 00:19:01,870
I can do it in the engine

286
00:19:04,250 --> 00:19:06,120
You can play around with it

287
00:19:06,120 --> 00:19:11,500
So it looks a little bit different from property to property

288
00:19:13,080 --> 00:19:13,580
But yeah

289
00:19:13,580 --> 00:19:15,350
that's that is how you feel

290
00:19:15,360 --> 00:19:16,240
the holes in that

291
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:20,910
There's also the whole explanation of the property part here
