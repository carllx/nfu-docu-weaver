1
00:00:00,570 --> 00:00:02,600
So let's talk about physics

2
00:00:02,790 --> 00:00:06,000
So to activate the physics mode in spline

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:10,310
you have to go to the simulation part here and the right to bar

4
00:00:10,660 --> 00:00:13,530
And then you see the first choice of physics

5
00:00:13,530 --> 00:00:14,840
you have to activate it

6
00:00:14,850 --> 00:00:16,710
and then you should be good to go

7
00:00:17,650 --> 00:00:18,270
First

8
00:00:18,270 --> 00:00:23,530
we will make an example of how the physics properties work

9
00:00:24,440 --> 00:00:25,160
And first

10
00:00:25,200 --> 00:00:30,140
we will now again hide the base plane here

11
00:00:30,380 --> 00:00:33,520
And we will create a new cube here

12
00:00:34,760 --> 00:00:36,780
So put it on here

13
00:00:37,790 --> 00:00:41,430
make it a little bit bigger by holding command and shift

14
00:00:45,490 --> 00:00:49,800
But we want more like a table or something

15
00:00:52,510 --> 00:00:54,090
So turn around here

16
00:01:03,190 --> 00:01:05,370
So something like this

17
00:01:07,630 --> 00:01:11,630
Okaymaybe give it also another color

18
00:01:11,630 --> 00:01:14,090
So maybe some white so you see it better

19
00:01:14,850 --> 00:01:20,610
And then on top of this table will place some more objects

20
00:01:21,530 --> 00:01:22,500
So choose a planar

21
00:01:24,690 --> 00:01:25,390
And then again

22
00:01:25,470 --> 00:01:28,910
make the cube a little bit bigger by holding command and shift

23
00:01:31,480 --> 00:01:34,480
I am reducing the corner so it looks more like a cube

24
00:01:38,520 --> 00:01:43,310
And then we will place it onto the table here

25
00:01:47,630 --> 00:01:48,710
So on top of that

26
00:01:48,710 --> 00:01:50,090
we will make another cube

27
00:01:50,090 --> 00:01:54,370
So you can​‌​‌​​‌‌​​‌‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌​‌‌‌​​‌‌​​‌‌​​‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌​​‌‌‌‌‌​​​‌‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌​‌​‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌​‌‌​​​‌‌‌‌‌‌​​‌‌​‌​‌‌‌​‌​‌​‌​​‌‌‌​‌‌​​‌‌​​​‌​​‌‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌‌​‌‌​​‌‌‌​​‌‌‌​‌​​​‌​​‌‌​​‌‌​​‌‌​‌​‌​​‌‌​‌​‌​​‌‌‌​​‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌​​​‌‌‌​‌‌​​‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌​​‌‌​​‌‌​​‌‌​‌‌​​​‌‌​​‌‌​​‌‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌​‌​‌‌‌​‌​‌‌‌‌‌​‌‌​​‌​​‌‌​​​‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌​​​‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌‌​​‌‌‌​‌​‌‌‌​​‌‌‌​​‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌​​​‌‌‌‌‌​​​‌‌‌‌‌​​​‌‌​​​‌​​‌‌​​‌‌​​‌‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌​‌‌‌​​‌‌‌‌‌​​​‌‌​‌‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌​‌‌​​‌‌​‌​‌‌‌​‌​‌‌‌​​‌‌​‌​‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌​‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌​‌‌​​​‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌​‌​‌‌‌​‌‌​​‌​​‌‌​‌‌‌‌‌​‌​‌​‌​​‌‌​‌​‌​​‌‌​‌​‌‌‌​‌‌​​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌‌​​‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌​​‌‌‌​​‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌​‌‌​​​‌‌‌​​‌‌‌​‌​‌‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌​​​‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌​​​‌​​‌‌‌‌‌​​​‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌​‌‌​​‌‌​​‌‌​​‌‌‌‌‌‌​​‌‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌​‌​‌‌‌​‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌​‌‌‌​​‌‌‌​​‌​​‌‌‌​​‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌​‌‌‌​​‌‌​‌‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌​​​‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌​​‌​​‌‌​‌​‌‌‌​‌​‌‌‌​​‌‌​‌‌​​​‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌​‌‌‌​​‌‌‌‌‌​​​‌‌​‌​‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌‌​​‌‌‌​‌​‌‌‌‌‌​‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌‌​​‌‌‌‌‌‌​​‌‌​‌‌‌​​‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌‌​​‌​​‌‌​​‌‌​​‌‌‌​​‌​​‌‌‌​​‌​​‌‌​‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌ simply select the cube now and hit command D

28
00:01:54,370 --> 00:01:56,260
so you duplicate the cube

29
00:01:57,820 --> 00:01:58,950
place it on top

30
00:01:58,950 --> 00:02:01,600
Here you can make again

31
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:02,710
another cube

32
00:02:02,820 --> 00:02:05,230
So you have three in total

33
00:02:09,230 --> 00:02:13,750
So then we will give every cube another color

34
00:02:13,860 --> 00:02:16,860
So you see the difference a little bit better here

35
00:02:18,200 --> 00:02:19,310
Some purple

36
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:22,360
Heremaybe some blue

37
00:02:22,370 --> 00:02:23,240
Also here

38
00:02:26,960 --> 00:02:27,580
Okay

39
00:02:28,100 --> 00:02:31,830
and we will group up these cubes here

40
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:36,100
So you can select a cube here and then hit command G

41
00:02:36,500 --> 00:02:37,400
so you group them

42
00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:40,760
you can see it in the left tube and all the cubes are grouped

43
00:02:42,090 --> 00:02:44,450
Soand then you click on the group

44
00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:49,260
and then you see on the right side here a tab called physics

45
00:02:50,650 --> 00:02:54,190
And first we start here with the body type

46
00:02:54,190 --> 00:02:55,050
So first

47
00:02:55,060 --> 00:02:56,950
its position by default

48
00:02:56,960 --> 00:03:00,760
and we will change it now to a dynamic value

49
00:03:01,250 --> 00:03:04,320
Soand what this does is basically

50
00:03:04,340 --> 00:03:09,090
if you move this group up now and

51
00:03:11,620 --> 00:03:12,850
Start the simulation

52
00:03:12,860 --> 00:03:16,940
You now see that the cubes are actually falling down

53
00:03:17,710 --> 00:03:22,290
If you change the body type back to position now and again simulate

54
00:03:22,290 --> 00:03:23,940
you now see that nothing happens

55
00:03:23,950 --> 00:03:29,240
so it stays in this original position now

56
00:03:29,350 --> 00:03:31,230
So going back to dynamic

57
00:03:31,240 --> 00:03:34,220
we can also give it a little twist here

58
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:38,860
Sobut you actually may notice that these

59
00:03:39,110 --> 00:03:41,700
all these cubes are stuck together

60
00:03:42,580 --> 00:03:44,230
And to get rid of it

61
00:03:44,240 --> 00:03:49,520
you can simply select the group here and say that the children are not fused

62
00:03:49,530 --> 00:03:51,440
but separated now

63
00:03:52,240 --> 00:03:56,500
And you may notice now that it's still not falling down yet

64
00:03:56,510 --> 00:04:02,180
because now you have to go one layer down and give all the cubes

65
00:04:02,180 --> 00:04:04,860
Now in the settings here

66
00:04:05,050 --> 00:04:07,250
the dynamic take here

67
00:04:07,260 --> 00:04:08,580
so also body type

68
00:04:08,580 --> 00:04:13,000
you have to select every cube to dynamic

69
00:04:14,470 --> 00:04:16,830
And when you now simulate again

70
00:04:17,480 --> 00:04:22,530
you see now that the cubes are all bouncing in different directions

71
00:04:25,100 --> 00:04:29,290
Soand every cube now has some different settings

72
00:04:29,550 --> 00:04:30,580
So for example

73
00:04:30,930 --> 00:04:36,760
now you can change the collider model to a simple faster model or a precise slower model

74
00:04:36,950 --> 00:04:39,450
I will keep it with a simple faster model

75
00:04:39,450 --> 00:04:43,720
Now here you can change the weight of the cube

76
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:46,820
so you can give every cube a different weight

77
00:04:47,420 --> 00:04:48,970
We will come to this later

78
00:04:49,320 --> 00:04:52,970
You can also give them another gravity scale

79
00:04:52,980 --> 00:04:57,640
So one here is like the normal gravity

80
00:04:57,640 --> 00:05:03,070
so 9．81 m per second squared

81
00:05:03,650 --> 00:05:09,780
And if you now adjust this value to maybe like 2

82
00:05:09,790 --> 00:05:12,700
it gets multiplied by 2

83
00:05:12,700 --> 00:05:17,310
so it is like something like 16 m per second squared

84
00:05:18,330 --> 00:05:23,780
and this object will now fall much faster down on the floor

85
00:05:23,830 --> 00:05:24,670
So for example

86
00:05:24,970 --> 00:05:32,290
if I'm now giving the bottom cube here now a gravity scale of 2

87
00:05:32,660 --> 00:05:39,030
and maybe we will bring this up a little more so you see a better difference

88
00:05:40,700 --> 00:05:43,030
And then when we simulate again

89
00:05:44,010 --> 00:05:44,420
you know

90
00:05:44,570 --> 00:05:48,780
see that actually the guys don't see it

91
00:05:48,820 --> 00:05:49,710
that's a grid

92
00:05:49,940 --> 00:05:51,990
so maybe a little bit more up here

93
00:05:55,310 --> 00:06:00,730
So I see that the last cube is getting much faster on the ground

94
00:06:01,990 --> 00:06:05,910
And also give the second one a little less here

95
00:06:07,490 --> 00:06:10,420
And the top one also

96
00:06:12,260 --> 00:06:13,040
Soyou know

97
00:06:13,050 --> 00:06:13,320
you know

98
00:06:13,380 --> 00:06:15,900
see that with evil gravity

99
00:06:15,900 --> 00:06:17,250
they are still stuck

100
00:06:17,250 --> 00:06:21,060
So maybe some more gravity

101
00:06:22,780 --> 00:06:24,470
And then when you simulate again

102
00:06:24,480 --> 00:06:31,010
you see that the two top cubes are falling much slower than the third cube

103
00:06:31,030 --> 00:06:31,760
Now

104
00:06:32,610 --> 00:06:36,750
okaythen what you can also do is friction

105
00:06:38,090 --> 00:06:42,250
I will bring the whole group down again here

106
00:06:45,480 --> 00:06:47,510
Maybe like

107
00:06:48,310 --> 00:06:51,050
okayso rotate it back

108
00:06:53,530 --> 00:06:54,760
Soand maybe

109
00:06:54,760 --> 00:06:55,400
for example

110
00:06:55,480 --> 00:07:00,770
now if you give the last CPS some adjustment in the friction now

111
00:07:01,110 --> 00:07:08,600
so you take the zero value now here and also do it for the other cubes

112
00:07:11,750 --> 00:07:16,690
We will make the table here a little bit bigger

113
00:07:25,770 --> 00:07:27,840
And when I am simulating now

114
00:07:27,850 --> 00:07:31,590
you see that the cubes are all sliding now

115
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:33,980
like they are on ice or something

116
00:07:35,100 --> 00:07:39,800
Yeahand that's basically what the friction value does

117
00:07:43,140 --> 00:07:47,630
I will remove the table size now again

118
00:07:48,690 --> 00:07:53,620
And what you can also do is you can change the bouncing value

119
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:55,670
So for instance

120
00:07:57,430 --> 00:08:04,290
I will move this up again a little bit and we will make the last cube a little bit more bouncy

121
00:08:04,920 --> 00:08:07,700
So choose the one value value of one now

122
00:08:08,840 --> 00:08:10,540
and you actually see that it

123
00:08:11,060 --> 00:08:13,580
it's quite really bouncy so

124
00:08:16,110 --> 00:08:17,390
Maybe if I rotate it now

125
00:08:17,550 --> 00:08:20,690
you see a better difference when I simulate again

126
00:08:20,760 --> 00:08:23,180
So you see how jumpy it is

127
00:08:23,420 --> 00:08:24,590
So it's like a big

128
00:08:24,610 --> 00:08:25,920
it's a very high value

129
00:08:25,920 --> 00:08:29,200
Now if you reduce it a little bit

130
00:08:33,490 --> 00:08:34,910
Yeahyou see the difference now

131
00:08:35,240 --> 00:08:38,220
So this is a bounce factor

132
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:43,380
I will shut up on not

133
00:08:45,460 --> 00:08:47,720
And now I will rotate it back

134
00:08:50,040 --> 00:08:54,170
And then we also have the damping factor

135
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:57,530
For example

136
00:08:57,900 --> 00:09:01,010
if I am increasing the damping factor for every cube

137
00:09:06,900 --> 00:09:14,520
So if I have now every damping value now increased and bring this a little bit more up the group here

138
00:09:15,830 --> 00:09:18,060
you actually see that it's more damp

139
00:09:18,070 --> 00:09:19,180
Nowof course

140
00:09:19,220 --> 00:09:21,440
the last cube is still

141
00:09:22,950 --> 00:09:25,910
still has the increased gravity scale

142
00:09:25,910 --> 00:09:31,420
so we reduce it again and also decrease the bounce level here

143
00:09:31,470 --> 00:09:32,870
I don't know what it is

144
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:33,410
on the other hand

145
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:34,350
Okayon the other key

146
00:09:34,350 --> 00:09:35,730
we have 0．2

147
00:09:35,910 --> 00:09:38,390
So we also take 0．2 here now

148
00:09:41,940 --> 00:09:42,430
And then

149
00:09:42,440 --> 00:09:47,240
ohI think I missed it already on the gravity scale is also 0．2

150
00:09:49,110 --> 00:09:50,740
Change it now here again

151
00:09:51,910 --> 00:09:56,620
And now you see that it's kind of smoothly now because of the damping factor

152
00:09:58,450 --> 00:09:58,960
And yeah

153
00:09:58,960 --> 00:10:00,970
that's basically what the damping factor does

154
00:10:00,970 --> 00:10:07,020
so it slows down the whole scene a bit and gives some more smoothly animations

155
00:10:08,490 --> 00:10:09,420
So next up

156
00:10:09,420 --> 00:10:12,030
we will talk about the weights now

157
00:10:12,030 --> 00:10:13,610
So for example

158
00:10:14,070 --> 00:10:14,510
now I will

159
00:10:16,960 --> 00:10:18,980
Bring two cubes now out of the group

160
00:10:19,070 --> 00:10:20,000
By dragging it out

161
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,490
I can delete this group for now

162
00:10:24,840 --> 00:10:27,840
And then I will put one cube on this side

163
00:10:30,470 --> 00:10:33,510
And one cube on this side

164
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:38,070
And then when I simulate

165
00:10:38,790 --> 00:10:45,580
nothing happens right now because actually the table is now fixed in its position

166
00:10:46,140 --> 00:10:47,490
But I will change it now

167
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:54,110
So if I click on the table now and again change to the dynamic body type

168
00:10:55,340 --> 00:10:55,860
you know

169
00:10:55,870 --> 00:10:58,450
see actually that everything is falling down

170
00:10:58,560 --> 00:11:00,440
but we don't want that now

171
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:03,970
So we see another setting here

172
00:11:03,970 --> 00:11:07,030
which is a translation and also a rotation factor

173
00:11:07,540 --> 00:11:11,410
Soand if we deactivate all the excess here

174
00:11:13,560 --> 00:11:16,660
You see then actually that it's only rotating

175
00:11:16,660 --> 00:11:18,150
it's not falling down

176
00:11:19,210 --> 00:11:23,740
And we can also deactivate now the other two axis

177
00:11:23,750 --> 00:11:24,840
the x and y axis

178
00:11:24,840 --> 00:11:28,130
so it only whips in the that direction

179
00:11:29,620 --> 00:11:31,420
And now if I'm going to simulate

180
00:11:31,430 --> 00:11:35,100
you see now that it's falling down on the left side

181
00:11:36,400 --> 00:11:36,860
And then

182
00:11:36,860 --> 00:11:37,500
for example

183
00:11:37,740 --> 00:11:44,060
when I'm changing the weight of the right cube now to maybe something like 5

184
00:11:44,600 --> 00:11:46,850
and then I simulate again

185
00:11:46,850 --> 00:11:52,910
you now see that it whips down to the right side because the weight on the right side is now bigger than on the left side

186
00:11:53,210 --> 00:11:54,120
So of course

187
00:11:54,120 --> 00:11:57,210
it makes sense now that it's moving in the right direction

188
00:11:58,950 --> 00:12:01,920
But also you can maybe

189
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:02,350
for example

190
00:12:03,180 --> 00:12:07,910
give the left one like a weight of three

191
00:12:08,450 --> 00:12:14,030
but you can increase the volume of the of the cube now

192
00:12:19,190 --> 00:12:22,170
Maybe also a little bit higher now

193
00:12:22,920 --> 00:12:24,710
And when I'm simulating now

194
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:27,710
againyou see it's bouncing back to the left side

195
00:12:28,780 --> 00:12:29,800
But on the other hand

196
00:12:29,810 --> 00:12:34,240
I can increase this value now again to maybe something much

197
00:12:34,250 --> 00:12:34,860
much higher

198
00:12:34,860 --> 00:12:36,660
so 100 or something

199
00:12:37,720 --> 00:12:39,140
And when I simulate again

200
00:12:39,140 --> 00:12:40,920
now it's moving to the right side

201
00:12:41,070 --> 00:12:44,190
So you guys maybe see what I'm trying to explain

202
00:12:44,230 --> 00:12:48,190
So maybe you know it from the math school

203
00:12:48,190 --> 00:12:53,130
So it actually depends on the volume and the density of the material

204
00:12:53,730 --> 00:12:54,970
But yeah

205
00:12:54,970 --> 00:13:02,080
you can play around a little bit with it and get to know how to use the weight and gravity scale and so on

206
00:13:02,090 --> 00:13:02,670
yeah
