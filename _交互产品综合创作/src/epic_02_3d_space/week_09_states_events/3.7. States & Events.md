1
00:00:00,020 --> 00:00:02,420
So let's talk about state and events

2
00:00:02,580 --> 00:00:05,430
So state and events is a big topic

3
00:00:05,430 --> 00:00:06,270
So again

4
00:00:06,270 --> 00:00:10,090
if you're not interested in watching the full detail of every step

5
00:00:10,410 --> 00:00:13,230
you can also skip to the next part of the course

6
00:00:13,740 --> 00:00:14,560
But for now

7
00:00:14,560 --> 00:00:17,860
we now talk about state and events

8
00:00:17,870 --> 00:00:20,890
So let's head over to our plan C now again

9
00:00:22,470 --> 00:00:24,360
and for demonstration again

10
00:00:24,450 --> 00:00:28,100
I will place some objects here on our base plane

11
00:00:28,520 --> 00:00:29,240
But for this

12
00:00:29,240 --> 00:00:33,080
now we actually extrude our base plane a little bit

13
00:00:33,160 --> 00:00:35,040
So here in the right t​‌​‌​​‌‌​​‌‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌​‌‌‌​​‌‌​​‌‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌​​‌‌‌​​‌‌‌​‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌​‌​‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌​‌‌​​​‌‌‌‌‌‌​​‌‌​‌‌‌​​‌‌​‌​‌​​‌‌‌​‌‌​​‌‌​​​‌​​‌‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌‌​​‌​​‌‌‌​​‌‌‌​‌​​​‌​​‌‌‌​‌‌​​‌‌​‌​‌​​‌‌​‌​‌​​‌‌‌​​‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌​​​‌‌‌​‌‌​​‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌​​‌‌‌​‌‌​​‌‌​‌‌​​​‌‌​​‌‌​​‌‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌​‌​‌‌‌​‌​‌‌‌‌‌​‌‌​​‌​​‌‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌‌​​‌​​‌‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌‌​​‌‌‌​‌​‌‌‌​​‌‌​‌‌​​​‌‌‌‌‌​​​‌‌‌‌‌​​​‌‌​‌‌‌​​‌‌​​​‌​​‌‌​​‌‌​​‌‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌​‌‌‌​​‌‌‌‌‌​​​‌‌​‌‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌​‌‌​​‌‌​‌​‌‌‌​‌​‌‌‌‌‌​‌​‌​‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌​‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌​‌‌​​​‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌​‌‌​​​‌‌​‌​‌‌‌​‌​‌​‌‌‌​‌​‌‌‌‌‌​‌​‌​‌​​‌‌​‌​‌​​‌‌​‌​‌‌‌​‌‌​​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌‌​​‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌​​‌‌‌​​‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌​‌‌​​​‌‌‌​​‌‌‌​‌​‌‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌​​​‌​​‌‌​‌​‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌​‌‌​​‌‌​​‌‌​​‌‌​‌​‌​​‌‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌​‌​‌‌‌​‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌​‌‌‌​​‌‌‌​​‌​​‌‌​‌‌​​​‌‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌​‌‌‌​​‌‌​‌‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌​​​‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌​​‌​​‌‌​‌​‌‌‌​‌​‌‌‌​​‌‌​‌‌​​​‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌​‌‌‌​​‌‌‌‌‌​​​‌‌​‌​‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌‌​​‌‌‌​‌​‌‌‌‌‌​‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌‌​​‌‌‌‌‌‌​​‌‌​‌‌‌​​‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌‌​​‌​​‌‌​​‌‌​​‌‌‌​​‌​​‌‌‌​​‌​​‌‌​‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌o over

14
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:41,620
let's give it a little extrusion and also color it a little bit

15
00:00:41,850 --> 00:00:42,950
maybe in white

16
00:00:43,250 --> 00:00:46,560
Soand we will make the plane a little bit bigger

17
00:00:46,750 --> 00:00:46,890
you know

18
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,560
So we'll hold option and shift now

19
00:00:49,710 --> 00:00:52,060
or maybe we zoom out a little bit first

20
00:00:52,400 --> 00:00:54,160
So holding option and shift

21
00:00:54,180 --> 00:00:57,750
you can increase the size evenly here

22
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:04,840
So now we have a nice little plane here and on top of the plane

23
00:01:04,840 --> 00:01:07,370
we will now place a cube

24
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:12,210
So put it on here and again

25
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:18,600
we holding option and shift make it a little bit bigger here for better visibility

26
00:01:21,380 --> 00:01:21,650
Okay

27
00:01:21,650 --> 00:01:23,850
now we have now this cube here

28
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:28,620
And now I will introduce the state and events part

29
00:01:29,440 --> 00:01:31,940
Make sure your cube is selected here

30
00:01:31,950 --> 00:01:34,310
And on the top right corner here

31
00:01:34,310 --> 00:01:36,040
you now see two topics

32
00:01:36,050 --> 00:01:37,340
One is the state event

33
00:01:37,490 --> 00:01:38,500
one is the state

34
00:01:38,950 --> 00:01:41,950
and the second one is the events topic here

35
00:01:42,740 --> 00:01:45,220
Soand to create a new state

36
00:01:45,220 --> 00:01:46,240
for instance

37
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:49,040
you can just simply click on this plus icon here

38
00:01:49,410 --> 00:01:52,100
And now you see that two states are created

39
00:01:52,580 --> 00:01:54,400
The first one is the base state

40
00:01:54,810 --> 00:01:57,360
and then you have a second state here

41
00:01:57,580 --> 00:02:01,360
Soand what states as simply does is

42
00:02:01,460 --> 00:02:02,870
so you have the base state

43
00:02:02,870 --> 00:02:06,890
Now this is just like this gray cube here now

44
00:02:07,310 --> 00:02:14,040
but you can actually change the cube in a way that it's transitioning ​‌​‌​​‌‌​​‌‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌​‌‌‌​​‌‌​​‌‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌​​‌‌‌​​‌‌‌​‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌​‌​‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌​‌‌​​​‌‌‌‌‌‌​​‌‌​‌‌‌​​‌‌​‌​‌​​‌‌‌​‌‌​​‌‌​​​‌​​‌‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌‌​​‌​​‌‌‌​​‌‌‌​‌​​​‌​​‌‌‌​‌‌​​‌‌​‌​‌​​‌‌​‌​‌​​‌‌‌​​‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌​​​‌‌‌​‌‌​​‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌​​‌‌‌​‌‌​​‌‌​‌‌​​​‌‌​​‌‌​​‌‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌​‌​‌‌‌​‌​‌‌‌‌‌​‌‌​​‌​​‌‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌‌​​‌​​‌‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌‌​​‌‌‌​‌​‌‌‌​​‌‌​‌‌​​​‌‌‌‌‌​​​‌‌‌‌‌​​​‌‌​‌‌‌​​‌‌​​​‌​​‌‌​​‌‌​​‌‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌​‌‌‌​​‌‌‌‌‌​​​‌‌​‌‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌​‌‌​​‌‌​‌​‌‌‌​‌​‌‌‌‌‌​‌​‌​‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌​‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌​‌‌​​​‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌​‌‌​​​‌‌​‌​‌‌‌​‌​‌​‌‌‌​‌​‌‌‌‌‌​‌​‌​‌​​‌‌​‌​‌​​‌‌​‌​‌‌‌​‌‌​​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌‌​​‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌​​‌‌‌​​‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌​‌‌​​​‌‌‌​​‌‌‌​‌​‌‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌​​​‌​​‌‌​‌​‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌​‌‌​​‌‌​​‌‌​​‌‌​‌​‌​​‌‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌​‌​‌‌‌​‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌​‌‌‌​​‌‌‌​​‌​​‌‌​‌‌​​​‌‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌​‌‌‌​​‌‌​‌‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌​​​‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌​​‌​​‌‌​‌​‌‌‌​‌​‌‌‌​​‌‌​‌‌​​​‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌​‌‌‌​​‌‌‌‌‌​​​‌‌​‌​‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌‌​​‌‌‌​‌​‌‌‌‌‌​‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌‌​​‌‌‌‌‌‌​​‌‌​‌‌‌​​‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌‌​​‌​​‌‌​​‌‌​​‌‌‌​​‌​​‌‌‌​​‌​​‌‌​‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌to another state

45
00:02:14,040 --> 00:02:15,120
So for example

46
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:19,320
now I will give this state now another color

47
00:02:19,480 --> 00:02:21,980
like maybe some purple here again

48
00:02:23,070 --> 00:02:25,430
And then if you swap in between the states

49
00:02:25,580 --> 00:02:28,150
you see now that the base state is still gray

50
00:02:28,770 --> 00:02:30,840
but the second state now is purple

51
00:02:32,020 --> 00:02:38,710
And what you can achieve now is two states is that you can trigger an event

52
00:02:38,940 --> 00:02:46,150
So if you click on this plus icon on the event topic here and head over to this one here

53
00:02:46,150 --> 00:02:47,190
the start event

54
00:02:49,660 --> 00:02:52,270
You can now add a transition to this

55
00:02:52,700 --> 00:02:54,840
So choose the first option here

56
00:02:54,860 --> 00:02:55,900
which is called transition

57
00:02:57,510 --> 00:02:59,030
and then click again on it

58
00:03:00,190 --> 00:03:03,160
Now you see a bunch of settings here that you can change

59
00:03:03,160 --> 00:03:06,610
So the first one now is called the target

60
00:03:06,610 --> 00:03:08,650
So target is our cube

61
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:11,780
but you can actually change anything here you want to

62
00:03:12,680 --> 00:03:15,880
And then we have this transition part here

63
00:03:15,890 --> 00:03:20,110
So the first transition is base from the current state now

64
00:03:20,120 --> 00:03:22,970
but we will change it now to our initial one

65
00:03:22,970 --> 00:03:23,850
the base date

66
00:03:24,860 --> 00:03:32,330
And the transition should maybe a cure every three seconds

67
00:03:32,330 --> 00:03:36,960
So I will put a three here on it

68
00:03:37,720 --> 00:03:41,420
and we get also an ease in out transition

69
00:03:41,590 --> 00:03:43,560
So we are first the base stitch

70
00:03:43,740 --> 00:03:46,470
then we have a transition here is and out for three

71
00:03:46,470 --> 00:03:48,680
second for 3 seconds

72
00:03:48,980 --> 00:03:51,930
and then we're achieving the second state here

73
00:03:52,920 --> 00:03:56,060
Soand what this simply does is if I'm

74
00:03:56,870 --> 00:04:02,710
if I now simulate you now actually see that in three seconds

75
00:04:02,710 --> 00:04:05,310
now the color is changing from gray to purple

76
00:04:07,030 --> 00:04:12,020
And now what you can also do is you can add as many states as you want

77
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:15,910
I will now add a new state

78
00:04:15,910 --> 00:04:17,150
so the state 2

79
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:17,820
And again

80
00:04:17,820 --> 00:04:20,100
here I can change the color

81
00:04:20,340 --> 00:04:21,610
so maybe to blue

82
00:04:25,060 --> 00:04:29,530
And then we can also add this state to a transition transition

83
00:04:29,530 --> 00:04:30,630
So again

84
00:04:30,710 --> 00:04:32,900
head over to the events topic here

85
00:04:33,180 --> 00:04:37,680
And then we can add a new transition here by clicking this plus icon

86
00:04:38,860 --> 00:04:42,180
And then automatically added is now the state 2

87
00:04:42,190 --> 00:04:51,550
So if we again give it a delete transition delay of three seconds here and close it and simulate again

88
00:04:51,650 --> 00:04:56,390
you now see that it's fading from gray to purple and then to blue

89
00:05:00,640 --> 00:05:03,770
So then you see actually that the transition is stopping now

90
00:05:04,280 --> 00:05:09,700
but you can actually get rid of it by adding now a loop event here

91
00:05:09,700 --> 00:05:11,520
So click on the loop here

92
00:05:11,650 --> 00:05:16,680
And then you can choose between if you want the loop to be counting

93
00:05:16,690 --> 00:05:18,030
So for instance

94
00:05:18,030 --> 00:05:19,190
just one time

95
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:23,670
or you can also make it to infinity here

96
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:25,740
So it's repeating every time over time

97
00:05:25,740 --> 00:05:27,910
time and time again and again

98
00:05:28,860 --> 00:05:33,700
And then you can also choose if you want to cycle it

99
00:05:33,700 --> 00:05:35,470
So for instance

100
00:05:35,470 --> 00:05:35,770
you know

101
00:05:35,770 --> 00:05:38,080
if I'm just simulating this one here

102
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:42,740
you see that it's fading from gray to purple to blue

103
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:45,110
and then it's restarting

104
00:05:45,180 --> 00:05:53,840
but you can actually make it like like a ping pong animation

105
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,820
So head over here to the cycle 1

106
00:05:56,860 --> 00:06:00,730
and then you can choose a ping pong topic here

107
00:06:01,960 --> 00:06:06,280
And now you see that it's fading from gray to purple to blue

108
00:06:06,760 --> 00:06:09,170
and then actually it's reversed now

109
00:06:09,170 --> 00:06:10,550
so it's back to purple

110
00:06:10,580 --> 00:06:12,910
and then back to gray

111
00:06:12,920 --> 00:06:14,200
and then so on

112
00:06:15,850 --> 00:06:19,830
And what you can also do you can not just simply just change the color

113
00:06:19,830 --> 00:06:22,900
You can also change any property you want here in the States

114
00:06:23,040 --> 00:06:23,960
So for example

115
00:06:24,440 --> 00:06:26,920
I am now in the second state

116
00:06:27,260 --> 00:06:29,910
and I want to increase the size here

117
00:06:29,940 --> 00:06:31,980
maybe for the cube

118
00:06:31,990 --> 00:06:35,300
So I will increase this x property here

119
00:06:36,540 --> 00:06:37,720
And when I simulate again

120
00:06:37,720 --> 00:06:39,460
now you see that the color is changing

121
00:06:39,510 --> 00:06:42,300
but also the width of the cube

122
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:46,490
And of course

123
00:06:46,490 --> 00:06:49,020
what you can also do is like give it a little twist

124
00:06:49,020 --> 00:06:50,500
for instance

125
00:06:51,450 --> 00:06:55,400
changing it here to 45 degrees on that axis

126
00:06:55,530 --> 00:06:59,950
And now you see that it's moving in the

127
00:07:03,380 --> 00:07:06,890
So give it here a little twist of 45 degrees

128
00:07:07,170 --> 00:07:08,700
And now when you simulate

129
00:07:09,340 --> 00:07:10,800
we see that the color is changing

130
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:12,830
but also the angle of the cube

131
00:07:16,350 --> 00:07:16,890
And again

132
00:07:16,890 --> 00:07:20,290
you can do this for any property you want here

133
00:07:20,320 --> 00:07:22,320
So maybe one more example

134
00:07:23,250 --> 00:07:28,180
You can also translate it in a different direction here in x

135
00:07:28,180 --> 00:07:30,550
yand z position

136
00:07:31,480 --> 00:07:36,420
And now you see that it's transitioning smoothly in this new state here

137
00:07:37,460 --> 00:07:37,870
So

138
00:07:37,870 --> 00:07:39,510
and to activate the transition

139
00:07:39,510 --> 00:07:42,630
you can not only just call the start event here

140
00:07:42,630 --> 00:07:45,370
you choose many triggers here

141
00:07:45,370 --> 00:07:46,570
So for example

142
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:48,040
the mouse up event

143
00:07:48,040 --> 00:07:52,200
So if you click and then leave your finger up

144
00:07:52,390 --> 00:07:54,410
you are calling the mouse up event

145
00:07:54,410 --> 00:07:56,420
So simulate again

146
00:07:56,420 --> 00:07:58,720
And now if I click on the cube

147
00:07:59,170 --> 00:08:01,390
and then I'm releasing my finger on the mouse

148
00:08:01,400 --> 00:08:04,910
you now see that the transition is starting now

149
00:08:07,150 --> 00:08:10,260
And you can also do this for the mouse down event

150
00:08:10,260 --> 00:08:12,340
So when I'm clicking down

151
00:08:12,350 --> 00:08:13,980
the transition is starting

152
00:08:17,400 --> 00:08:20,890
And you can also do it like for a simple mouse press

153
00:08:20,890 --> 00:08:22,840
So while I'm pressing the mouse

154
00:08:22,920 --> 00:08:24,260
the transition is starting

155
00:08:25,030 --> 00:08:27,880
I have to keep my finger on here

156
00:08:27,890 --> 00:08:29,040
And if I'm releasing

157
00:08:29,040 --> 00:08:31,260
the transition is stopping now

158
00:08:31,830 --> 00:08:34,300
So this is the mouse press event

159
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:40,500
Then you also have the mouse hover event

160
00:08:40,830 --> 00:08:42,300
So SNM says

161
00:08:43,140 --> 00:08:46,630
so when I'm hovering over the shape

162
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:49,340
now the transition is starting

163
00:08:53,740 --> 00:08:58,210
And then you can also have some key events

164
00:08:58,340 --> 00:09:01,810
So same for the keys now as for the mouse

165
00:09:01,930 --> 00:09:03,250
So the key up event

166
00:09:03,670 --> 00:09:07,720
you can choose this one and then can enter a key example

167
00:09:07,930 --> 00:09:10,660
I'm choosing the key K now

168
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:15,290
and when I now on my keyboard

169
00:09:15,500 --> 00:09:18,100
press the button K here

170
00:09:18,630 --> 00:09:19,620
and again

171
00:09:19,620 --> 00:09:21,130
this is a key up event

172
00:09:21,130 --> 00:09:22,790
So if I'm releasing my fingernail

173
00:09:23,650 --> 00:09:25,400
the transition is starting

174
00:09:27,100 --> 00:09:30,400
And I can also do it now for the key down event

175
00:09:31,010 --> 00:09:33,290
So if I'm pressing key

176
00:09:33,930 --> 00:09:35,720
the transition is starting

177
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:42,300
And then also you have the key press event

178
00:09:43,620 --> 00:09:45,020
So simulate again

179
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:47,360
if I'm pressing the K button

180
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:50,400
now the transition is getting started

181
00:09:52,120 --> 00:09:57,350
So then we also have a scroll trigger here

182
00:09:57,410 --> 00:09:59,410
So if you select the scroll trigger

183
00:10:00,630 --> 00:10:07,530
you now see two options here at the you can start the transition by step

184
00:10:07,530 --> 00:10:08,730
So for example

185
00:10:10,040 --> 00:10:13,620
maybe I should use like 20 steps

186
00:10:13,790 --> 00:10:16,960
And then I'm going to simulate and scroll

187
00:10:18,180 --> 00:10:25,340
You now see that the transition is going on depending on how far I zoom out

188
00:10:25,750 --> 00:10:28,350
So maybe you can also increase the steps here

189
00:10:28,350 --> 00:10:31,530
So it's delayed a bit

190
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:40,350
And you can also choose a type scroll here

191
00:10:40,350 --> 00:10:42,100
So it's more page

192
00:10:42,690 --> 00:10:46,200
You have a page dependency depending on the view

193
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:51,810
The page where it starts can also set an offset and so many else

194
00:10:51,820 --> 00:10:58,000
But keep in mind that the scroll mode only works when you're exporting in the spline views

195
00:10:59,280 --> 00:11:00,650
Be careful when you simulate

196
00:11:00,660 --> 00:11:03,010
Maybe it doesn't look like it should

197
00:11:04,730 --> 00:11:05,400
And yet

198
00:11:07,950 --> 00:11:08,660
Then next up

199
00:11:08,780 --> 00:11:13,400
we also have the drag and drop trigger here

200
00:11:13,490 --> 00:11:18,060
So if you click on it and maybe simulate now you know

201
00:11:18,220 --> 00:11:21,280
can actually drag around this cube

202
00:11:22,500 --> 00:11:25,360
And what we also learned about physics

203
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:28,120
now you can actually apply physics to this cube

204
00:11:29,580 --> 00:11:35,760
If you head back now select the cube and scroll down a little bit here on the right side

205
00:11:36,590 --> 00:11:40,730
You can now change again the physics to dynamic

206
00:11:40,770 --> 00:11:46,550
And when I simulate again now and dragging this cube around and leave it

207
00:11:46,580 --> 00:11:48,740
you now see that it's falling down

208
00:11:52,770 --> 00:11:53,990
So

209
00:11:56,150 --> 00:11:59,940
So back in the drag and drop property window here

210
00:12:01,220 --> 00:12:01,680
you can

211
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:02,750
for instance

212
00:12:02,780 --> 00:12:03,770
change the cursor

213
00:12:03,770 --> 00:12:04,530
Here

214
00:12:04,660 --> 00:12:07,620
You can also apply a damping

215
00:12:08,950 --> 00:12:14,950
So you now see that it's much more smoother when I'm pulling the cube around here

216
00:12:18,010 --> 00:12:24,510
Then you can also choose if you want it to be adaptive to the camera or maybe to an A

217
00:12:24,900 --> 00:12:26,240
so for instance

218
00:12:26,440 --> 00:12:28,740
if you click the Y axis now here

219
00:12:28,740 --> 00:12:30,960
you can only move it up and down

220
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:36,400
So you not can not anymore move it to the right side or to the front

221
00:12:36,400 --> 00:12:37,680
the back side here

222
00:12:39,500 --> 00:12:45,630
And this is what you simply can do for every axis or even the floors here

223
00:12:49,450 --> 00:12:56,490
Then you can choose if you want the plane mode to be keep initial to the plane position or to use the current object position

224
00:12:57,570 --> 00:13:00,530
Then you can change between the world coordinate system

225
00:13:00,540 --> 00:13:03,100
parent and object based

226
00:13:06,400 --> 00:13:10,870
And then what you can also do is you can add some drag limits here

227
00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:11,320
But first

228
00:13:11,320 --> 00:13:15,670
I will actually change it back to the mode adaptive to camera

229
00:13:16,100 --> 00:13:18,730
And then also our table here

230
00:13:18,730 --> 00:13:21,120
I don't want it to be dynamic anymore

231
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:22,500
So for the simulation

232
00:13:22,510 --> 00:13:25,560
we stick up with position now from here

233
00:13:26,280 --> 00:13:27,720
and then back to the cube

234
00:13:28,680 --> 00:13:29,100
So

235
00:13:29,100 --> 00:13:31,710
and then we can add some track limits

236
00:13:31,720 --> 00:13:32,920
So for example

237
00:13:33,320 --> 00:13:36,370
some x values here

238
00:13:36,380 --> 00:13:38,630
x minus x max

239
00:13:39,290 --> 00:13:44,870
So I will increase it to maybe like 70 here in the minus direction

240
00:13:46,580 --> 00:13:50,280
and something like 70 here in the positive direction

241
00:13:50,980 --> 00:13:53,010
And when I simulate now again

242
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:58,550
you now see that I only can move the cube here in the x direction

243
00:13:58,760 --> 00:14:04,280
And it n plus and -70 coordinates

244
00:14:04,280 --> 00:14:06,250
But still in every other direction

245
00:14:06,250 --> 00:14:07,160
it's still possible

246
00:14:08,900 --> 00:14:11,460
But maybe for some more purposes

247
00:14:11,460 --> 00:14:12,650
Now you can

248
00:14:12,850 --> 00:14:13,570
for example

249
00:14:13,750 --> 00:14:18,100
change the plane mount now here to also x axis

250
00:14:18,380 --> 00:14:22,040
And now you can actually just move it in the x direction

251
00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:33,430
And maybe if I now increase this a little bit to like maybe -200 and plus 200

252
00:14:33,450 --> 00:14:37,840
now you can move it up and down here

253
00:14:40,450 --> 00:14:45,640
And for maybe some real world projects now can

254
00:14:45,640 --> 00:14:46,190
for example

255
00:14:49,500 --> 00:14:52,070
I will add something here

256
00:14:59,740 --> 00:15:01,810
So we will add a cube now here

257
00:15:02,310 --> 00:15:05,000
and we will create a kind of slider

258
00:15:07,640 --> 00:15:09,230
So pull it down a little bit

259
00:15:09,730 --> 00:15:12,030
I don't know if it's centered right now

260
00:15:12,040 --> 00:15:12,420
Ohyeah

261
00:15:12,420 --> 00:15:13,100
it is

262
00:15:14,030 --> 00:15:16,590
And maybe another color here

263
00:15:16,900 --> 00:15:17,780
some black

264
00:15:19,510 --> 00:15:20,100
and maybe

265
00:15:20,100 --> 00:15:20,650
you know

266
00:15:20,730 --> 00:15:21,350
see what it

267
00:15:21,350 --> 00:15:25,640
it looks like it looks a little bit like a slider

268
00:15:27,560 --> 00:15:31,130
I will decrease the size a little bit

269
00:15:33,540 --> 00:15:34,620
And then when you simulate

270
00:15:34,630 --> 00:15:37,640
now you see it's like a slider

271
00:15:37,640 --> 00:15:39,170
which you can pull up and down

272
00:15:39,180 --> 00:15:44,420
Now you can also increase min and max values a little bit more

273
00:15:44,420 --> 00:15:50,860
So like -250 plus 250

274
00:15:53,460 --> 00:15:55,240
Maybe even even a little bit more

275
00:15:55,240 --> 00:15:58,730
So it's right aligning with the edge now here

276
00:15:58,740 --> 00:16:04,160
but you actually see for what you can use this for

277
00:16:05,630 --> 00:16:08,740
you can make this a little bit smaller here also

278
00:16:09,300 --> 00:16:11,990
And then you have a nice little slider here

279
00:16:13,500 --> 00:16:14,880
And next up

280
00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:18,560
we also have another feature that is called the drop feature

281
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:18,840
Now

282
00:16:18,840 --> 00:16:24,520
So let me just redo now the basic properties here

283
00:16:24,520 --> 00:16:26,090
so adaptive to camera

284
00:16:26,860 --> 00:16:31,480
And I will remove the drag limits from now

285
00:16:32,860 --> 00:16:36,290
And then I will activate this drop feature here now

286
00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:41,570
So then you see that some new properties are added here

287
00:16:41,960 --> 00:16:45,670
and the first one is called the snap to function here

288
00:16:45,670 --> 00:16:51,110
You can choose either if you want to snap it to the object position or the surface

289
00:16:51,150 --> 00:16:52,330
So for instance

290
00:16:52,350 --> 00:16:53,910
this might look a little bit awkward

291
00:16:54,930 --> 00:16:57,390
And now moving it here

292
00:16:57,760 --> 00:17:01,280
you now see that it's snapping to the center of the object

293
00:17:01,280 --> 00:17:03,760
So because here from the plane

294
00:17:03,760 --> 00:17:06,320
now you have your base coordinate system

295
00:17:08,270 --> 00:17:11,610
I will delete this also again so you see it a little bit better

296
00:17:12,340 --> 00:17:12,880
So again

297
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:13,770
if you simulate

298
00:17:13,770 --> 00:17:17,110
now it's snapping to the base coordinate system

299
00:17:18,150 --> 00:17:19,890
So no matter where I drag it

300
00:17:19,890 --> 00:17:23,600
it's also just snapping to the middle of the part here

301
00:17:24,380 --> 00:17:26,570
but I can change it now

302
00:17:26,580 --> 00:17:28,060
And to do this

303
00:17:28,130 --> 00:17:31,540
I can change it from object position to surface now

304
00:17:32,150 --> 00:17:36,080
So and when I simulate again now and drag it here across

305
00:17:36,180 --> 00:17:40,520
it's snapping to the surface of the table here

306
00:17:41,910 --> 00:17:48,460
So that's basically the difference between the two snap two types here

307
00:17:50,100 --> 00:17:53,720
And you can also choose if you want to have an offset here

308
00:17:54,500 --> 00:17:58,630
And you can also reduce or increase the snap speed

309
00:17:58,660 --> 00:17:59,600
So for example

310
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:05,050
the lower Snapseed will now look a little bit smoother

311
00:18:05,050 --> 00:18:05,680
you know

312
00:18:05,890 --> 00:18:07,390
than the one before

313
00:18:09,910 --> 00:18:11,810
So this looks like maybe a little

314
00:18:11,900 --> 00:18:14,160
a little more realistic

315
00:18:15,090 --> 00:18:17,240
Then you have the auto Orient feature

316
00:18:17,430 --> 00:18:19,340
So for example

317
00:18:19,510 --> 00:18:22,050
if I'm leaving this one on off

318
00:18:22,250 --> 00:18:29,880
now you actually see that it's not facing the sides like it did before

319
00:18:29,900 --> 00:18:35,280
So it stays in the same orientation as it's by default

320
00:18:36,610 --> 00:18:41,300
So for the comparison

321
00:18:41,300 --> 00:18:48,510
now you see there is actually rotating depending on which side it's snapping to

322
00:18:49,810 --> 00:18:51,830
And this is what the Auto Orient does

323
00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:54,520
Then you can also choose the fallback mode here

324
00:18:54,520 --> 00:18:56,870
So if you want to that

325
00:18:58,740 --> 00:19:01,060
and you can also choose a four-block mode here

326
00:19:01,260 --> 00:19:04,390
So if it's in the drop position

327
00:19:04,390 --> 00:19:12,120
it's returning to the original position or it's returning to the last snap position now

328
00:19:14,660 --> 00:19:16,810
And here you can choose the drop on

329
00:19:16,810 --> 00:19:22,080
So you can say that this shape drops on every other shape

330
00:19:22,170 --> 00:19:26,800
Or you can actually give a list of objects where it should snap on

331
00:19:27,900 --> 00:19:28,850
So for instance

332
00:19:28,850 --> 00:19:33,570
if I am now adding a new shape here

333
00:19:33,860 --> 00:19:35,670
so maybe just a cube

334
00:19:38,850 --> 00:19:40,940
And back on the main cube here

335
00:19:41,940 --> 00:19:45,360
and I select now the list of objects here

336
00:19:46,310 --> 00:19:48,550
Choose now the cube 2

337
00:19:50,050 --> 00:19:54,620
You now see that it's snapping to this object

338
00:19:54,780 --> 00:19:57,600
but not to the table anymore

339
00:20:00,010 --> 00:20:03,560
And now what we can also do is we can change the behavior

340
00:20:03,760 --> 00:20:09,050
So we can make an action based on the behavior on drag or on drop

341
00:20:09,590 --> 00:20:11,020
And for this 1

342
00:20:11,020 --> 00:20:17,090
I will now remove our state that we have created before

343
00:20:17,100 --> 00:20:20,180
And then we will create two new states here

344
00:20:20,190 --> 00:20:26,040
And we will just change the color of the second second state here to green

345
00:20:27,830 --> 00:20:32,510
And then if we head over back to the drag and drop property window here

346
00:20:33,040 --> 00:20:35,220
going to the behavior and drop here

347
00:20:35,490 --> 00:20:39,440
And then we can make a new transition here for the cube

348
00:20:40,280 --> 00:20:42,960
And we will take the base state here

349
00:20:43,130 --> 00:20:48,220
and we will do a transition here to the second state

350
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:57,190
Soand what this does is basically when I'm moving now with this cube around and it's snapping to the object

351
00:20:57,340 --> 00:21:02,950
now a tradition is triggered and the cube now is getting in the second state

352
00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:06,320
and the color is changing from gray to green

353
00:21:07,010 --> 00:21:11,920
And maybe what you can also do is you can also like add the sound maybe

354
00:21:13,030 --> 00:21:18,720
So if you click on sound now here you can choose the sound file from the library here

355
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:19,300
So maybe

356
00:21:20,520 --> 00:21:21,260
I don't know

357
00:21:22,070 --> 00:21:24,190
anot a bell here

358
00:21:24,190 --> 00:21:26,430
but maybe some pop

359
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:29,400
Yeahthat sounds good

360
00:21:30,760 --> 00:21:36,390
And now when you simulate now and it snaps

361
00:21:37,350 --> 00:21:38,700
ohthat's the wrong sound

362
00:21:39,690 --> 00:21:43,600
So head over back to the drop sound here

363
00:21:43,850 --> 00:21:45,500
we don't want the bell

364
00:21:45,500 --> 00:21:47,240
we want the pop sound here

365
00:21:47,590 --> 00:21:48,460
okay

366
00:21:49,100 --> 00:21:49,940
And now again

367
00:21:49,940 --> 00:21:50,930
when you simulate

368
00:21:52,100 --> 00:21:55,310
now you see it's snapping to the surface

369
00:21:55,360 --> 00:21:58,030
the color is changing too green

370
00:21:58,780 --> 00:22:02,300
and you also get a little pop sound

371
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:09,220
It's not pretty slow

372
00:22:09,220 --> 00:22:09,800
but again

373
00:22:09,800 --> 00:22:12,320
you can play around with the settings here now

374
00:22:12,320 --> 00:22:18,000
So I will reduce the damping factor a little bit so it's more faster

375
00:22:23,140 --> 00:22:23,570
And yeah

376
00:22:23,580 --> 00:22:26,870
this is what you can do with the drag and drop mode here

377
00:22:29,700 --> 00:22:30,810
So in next up

378
00:22:30,820 --> 00:22:33,050
we have the look at feature

379
00:22:33,050 --> 00:22:34,120
which is quite cool

380
00:22:34,120 --> 00:22:34,880
So again

381
00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:38,050
go on the Events tab and then choose the look at function

382
00:22:39,030 --> 00:22:40,010
And for example

383
00:22:40,010 --> 00:22:48,790
we will now rotate it back to the original base rotation factor of 0 here and bring this up a little bit

384
00:22:51,290 --> 00:22:53,540
And then if you simulate again

385
00:22:53,540 --> 00:22:57,470
now you see that it's actually facing your cursor

386
00:22:57,470 --> 00:23:02,170
So if you imagine this is a robot or face or something else

387
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:05,550
you now see that it's always looking at my cursor

388
00:23:05,870 --> 00:23:09,210
And this is what we also are going to do in later project

389
00:23:09,240 --> 00:23:10,470
in the Eve project

390
00:23:11,220 --> 00:23:13,280
which is a really cool feature now

391
00:23:15,380 --> 00:23:16,080
And yeah

392
00:23:16,120 --> 00:23:16,820
And also here

393
00:23:16,820 --> 00:23:18,630
you can change some properties

394
00:23:19,120 --> 00:23:21,460
So you can choose a target here

395
00:23:21,470 --> 00:23:24,410
I would let it just be the cursor

396
00:23:25,050 --> 00:23:31,960
Then you can also choose if you want it to be aligned with the camera or with some layers

397
00:23:32,230 --> 00:23:35,180
the floor layer or the front back layer here

398
00:23:35,180 --> 00:23:36,040
So for example

399
00:23:36,050 --> 00:23:37,960
if you choose the floor now here

400
00:23:38,900 --> 00:23:43,390
you now see that it has some constraints here

401
00:23:43,400 --> 00:23:45,400
It can only move in the flow direction

402
00:23:45,930 --> 00:23:47,440
So not up and down

403
00:23:47,840 --> 00:23:49,510
just sidewards here

404
00:23:52,140 --> 00:23:55,810
Then you can also give it a damping factor

405
00:23:57,060 --> 00:23:58,810
so it's a little bit smoother

406
00:24:03,340 --> 00:24:06,330
And here you can also just change the direction

407
00:24:06,330 --> 00:24:13,560
So if I'm heading back to the line of camera and choosing maybe the y direction here

408
00:24:15,620 --> 00:24:19,640
You can see that it's rotating in another direction

409
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:22,240
So for instance

410
00:24:23,310 --> 00:24:24,800
the base date is that

411
00:24:26,350 --> 00:24:29,380
But you can also give it like the x direction

412
00:24:31,700 --> 00:24:31,960
And yeah

413
00:24:31,960 --> 00:24:36,180
you can play around a little bit with these properties

414
00:24:36,700 --> 00:24:42,200
And then what you can also do is adding a reset function here

415
00:24:42,230 --> 00:24:44,330
So if you hover out

416
00:24:44,610 --> 00:24:46,140
it's resetting

417
00:24:46,150 --> 00:24:47,170
So for example

418
00:24:47,170 --> 00:24:50,830
now if I'm hovering out of the we here

419
00:24:50,840 --> 00:24:52,790
it's getting back to the base date

420
00:24:53,310 --> 00:24:55,090
but you can also get rid of it

421
00:24:55,110 --> 00:24:56,900
You can say you don't want to reset

422
00:24:56,900 --> 00:24:59,520
So if I'm hovering now out of the window

423
00:24:59,700 --> 00:25:05,600
it stays in the position that was detected before

424
00:25:07,020 --> 00:25:11,070
And you can also decrease or increase the reset speed

425
00:25:13,010 --> 00:25:14,140
So for example

426
00:25:14,740 --> 00:25:18,900
I will now add a reset and then when I'm having route

427
00:25:19,570 --> 00:25:22,760
it's getting slowly back to the original position
