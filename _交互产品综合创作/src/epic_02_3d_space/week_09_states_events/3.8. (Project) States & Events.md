1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:00,720
So

2
00:00:00,720 --> 00:00:04,610
and to summarize the state in the event topic

3
00:00:04,610 --> 00:00:07,140
we will make a little project for now

4
00:00:07,920 --> 00:00:08,750
So first

5
00:00:08,750 --> 00:00:14,170
we will just make our base plane invisible or delete it just

6
00:00:15,380 --> 00:00:18,220
And then we will place a new rectangle here

7
00:00:18,900 --> 00:00:19,800
anywhere you want

8
00:00:19,860 --> 00:00:21,940
and zoom in a little bit

9
00:00:22,680 --> 00:00:27,480
Soand then we will form a little button here

10
00:00:30,140 --> 00:00:31,330
And on the right side

11
00:00:31,480 --> 00:00:35,710
we will increase the corners a little bit so it's more rounded

12
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:41,080
And then also give it a little bit of extrusion here

13
00:00:43,030 --> 00:00:46,100
You can rotate it as you see a little bit

14
00:00:46,220 --> 00:00:49,110
So maybe like this here

15
00:00:51,020 --> 00:00:55,820
And then we can also do some bevel for some smoother edges

16
00:00:58,250 --> 00:01:01,300
And to make it a little bit more modern

17
00:01:01,300 --> 00:01:03,620
I will also change the background color here

18
00:01:03,620 --> 00:01:05,960
So just click anywhere in the scene

19
00:01:06,070 --> 00:01:07,370
And then on the right side here

20
00:01:07,380 --> 00:01:09,200
you see the BG color

21
00:01:09,880 --> 00:01:14,360
I will take just a white background here

22
00:01:16,620 --> 00:01:21,030
And then we will head over back to our button again

23
00:01:21,400 --> 00:01:23,230
And on the button

24
00:01:23,230 --> 00:01:25,290
we will place an ellipse

25
00:01:27,320 --> 00:01:31,060
And then scale it a little bit up

26
00:01:31,170 --> 00:01:33,400
So I holding option and shift

27
00:01:33,630 --> 00:01:35,160
You can scale it evenly

28
00:01:35,890 --> 00:01:37,790
So maybe like this

29
00:01:38,700 --> 00:01:40,500
And then again on the right side

30
00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:46,120
give it a little bit of extrusion and also some bevel

31
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:48,820
So maybe like this

32
00:01:50,590 --> 00:01:50,870
Oh

33
00:01:50,870 --> 00:01:54,480
that's a little bit much extrusion now

34
00:01:58,560 --> 00:01:59,900
We like this

35
00:02:01,190 --> 00:02:05,240
Move it in front of the button here

36
00:02:07,580 --> 00:02:09,470
Soand check the alignment

37
00:02:09,470 --> 00:02:11,440
So a little bit more down here

38
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:13,930
Okay

39
00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:20,340
so for now we are ready with the basic shape here and we will do some materials

40
00:02:20,340 --> 00:02:21,080
Now also

41
00:02:22,070 --> 00:02:25,140
I would like to make it in a clean white here

42
00:02:25,140 --> 00:02:34,670
so head over here to the material settings and I will make it white here

43
00:02:35,550 --> 00:02:37,350
So the lighting tape is good now

44
00:02:37,530 --> 00:02:42,570
but I will also do some Fresnel here

45
00:02:42,890 --> 00:02:43,980
So click on Fresno

46
00:02:44,850 --> 00:02:46,210
so white is also good

47
00:02:46,210 --> 00:02:47,660
The settings are also good

48
00:02:47,740 --> 00:02:51,410
so you get a little bit of more contour here

49
00:02:52,820 --> 00:02:58,180
and then I also want some more spectral reflection here

50
00:02:58,180 --> 00:03:03,650
so I will also add a mat cap here

51
00:03:03,660 --> 00:03:04,710
a matte cap layer

52
00:03:06,430 --> 00:03:10,490
and for now I'm choosing from the library like this one here

53
00:03:10,490 --> 00:03:12,180
so you get a little nice reflection

54
00:03:13,330 --> 00:03:16,550
And now you see that it's getting black

55
00:03:16,550 --> 00:03:16,920
You know

56
00:03:16,960 --> 00:03:18,080
I don't want that

57
00:03:18,330 --> 00:03:23,150
so I'm choosing here on the medcap function overlaid topics

58
00:03:23,160 --> 00:03:25,780
so now you're getting the layer overlaid

59
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:31,940
so it gives a little nice shininess here

60
00:03:34,050 --> 00:03:39,240
And this I'm also going to do now for the button here

61
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:43,520
So I will leave this now for now

62
00:03:44,380 --> 00:03:49,240
but let's add also a matte cap layer here

63
00:03:50,160 --> 00:03:50,830
And again

64
00:03:50,830 --> 00:03:52,270
from the library here

65
00:03:52,270 --> 00:03:53,360
the shiny 1

66
00:03:55,420 --> 00:03:59,490
And I also choose the overlay function here

67
00:04:00,520 --> 00:04:02,350
But now in the default state

68
00:04:02,350 --> 00:04:04,490
I actually want the button to be red

69
00:04:04,490 --> 00:04:08,160
So I will change the color here to some red

70
00:04:12,960 --> 00:04:14,370
Maybe a little bit darker here

71
00:04:14,370 --> 00:04:15,490
So yeah

72
00:04:15,500 --> 00:04:17,000
something like that

73
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,920
So it only shines in the red color

74
00:04:21,470 --> 00:04:27,740
And then I can also add a little bit of outline here

75
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:29,480
So maybe

76
00:04:31,850 --> 00:04:33,140
And also some red

77
00:04:35,550 --> 00:04:37,080
Just a little here

78
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:40,300
So it's more separated now

79
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:47,670
Okayand then I will also add a little bit of background

80
00:04:47,710 --> 00:04:50,680
So where the button actually slides in the position

81
00:04:51,420 --> 00:04:56,010
So I will add another rectangle here on the existing button

82
00:04:58,100 --> 00:05:00,340
And I will exceed the size a little bit

83
00:05:02,570 --> 00:05:03,580
Maybe like this

84
00:05:11,590 --> 00:05:11,710
Okay

85
00:05:11,970 --> 00:05:13,420
and now again

86
00:05:13,420 --> 00:05:17,450
increase the corners here so it's a little bit more rounded

87
00:05:19,100 --> 00:05:20,500
Yeahthat looks good for now

88
00:05:21,350 --> 00:05:34,720
Maybe some more on the right side here and a little bit down so it's more centered and I will change the color to like a really light gray here

89
00:05:34,920 --> 00:05:38,900
so it gives a little bit of modern look

90
00:05:40,710 --> 00:05:44,350
And now we have the basic shape here

91
00:05:44,360 --> 00:05:44,990
so the basic pattern

92
00:05:45,350 --> 00:05:48,600
So also it just already looks

93
00:05:48,860 --> 00:05:50,110
pretty cool in my opinion

94
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:55,180
Sobut maybe we can also add a little outline here

95
00:05:55,330 --> 00:06:00,240
So let's add another layer here and choose

96
00:06:00,350 --> 00:06:00,540
oh wait

97
00:06:00,550 --> 00:06:12,170
is it the outline here and make it also red maybe like a little bit brighter red here

98
00:06:15,250 --> 00:06:15,920
Maybe like this

99
00:06:17,770 --> 00:06:20,250
And now we come to the functionality of the button

100
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:21,910
So we actually want that

101
00:06:22,290 --> 00:06:23,730
If we click here on the button

102
00:06:24,330 --> 00:06:27,620
this whole button moves to the right

103
00:06:27,760 --> 00:06:30,330
and this is now in a green color

104
00:06:30,330 --> 00:06:32,450
so it's like an activation mode

105
00:06:33,220 --> 00:06:34,230
And to do that

106
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:36,610
we will click here on the ellipse

107
00:06:36,670 --> 00:06:44,940
I will quickly rename it so you have a better understanding of the shapes

108
00:06:44,940 --> 00:06:44,960
Here

109
00:06:46,450 --> 00:06:47,730
We'll call it button

110
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:53,840
And then we can also rename this one

111
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:55,140
Here is a rectangle too

112
00:06:55,150 --> 00:06:56,240
toomaybe

113
00:06:59,090 --> 00:07:05,940
So the slider background and this rectangle is our hole button

114
00:07:06,810 --> 00:07:11,430
And we really renamed this juice to the button wrapper

115
00:07:11,430 --> 00:07:12,230
maybe

116
00:07:12,750 --> 00:07:13,710
Okay

117
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:20,180
then choose a button and we will introduce two new states here

118
00:07:20,190 --> 00:07:23,420
So we click just on the plus icon here

119
00:07:23,630 --> 00:07:27,420
and then we have the base state and the second state here

120
00:07:27,660 --> 00:07:30,900
And this is basically just our base state

121
00:07:31,260 --> 00:07:35,030
And if we do a transition to the second state

122
00:07:35,040 --> 00:07:38,060
now we want this button to move to the right here

123
00:07:38,570 --> 00:07:39,430
And to do that

124
00:07:39,430 --> 00:07:41,850
just activate the second state here

125
00:07:42,180 --> 00:07:47,670
And then you can move this button to where it should be in the end

126
00:07:48,200 --> 00:07:49,660
So maybe like here

127
00:07:50,980 --> 00:07:54,750
And we also want that the button is getting the color green

128
00:07:54,750 --> 00:07:56,430
So still

129
00:07:56,430 --> 00:07:58,580
we are still in the second stage here

130
00:07:58,810 --> 00:08:03,550
So you can just change the color here to something green

131
00:08:04,050 --> 00:08:05,430
Yeahmaybe like that

132
00:08:07,470 --> 00:08:11,870
And then we will also head over here to our slider background

133
00:08:13,570 --> 00:08:14,210
Also here

134
00:08:14,210 --> 00:08:16,180
we will introduce a second state

135
00:08:16,530 --> 00:08:17,350
So again

136
00:08:17,350 --> 00:08:19,310
we have a base state and the second state

137
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:24,160
And also if we trigger now this second

138
00:08:25,270 --> 00:08:29,040
the outline color should also change to a green here

139
00:08:32,100 --> 00:08:33,340
Yeahmaybe like that

140
00:08:34,100 --> 00:08:34,580
So again

141
00:08:34,580 --> 00:08:35,330
in the base state

142
00:08:35,500 --> 00:08:36,010
it's red

143
00:08:36,190 --> 00:08:37,280
and in the second state

144
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:38,600
it's green

145
00:08:38,820 --> 00:08:42,880
And also we have to do this for this outline here

146
00:08:43,240 --> 00:08:46,740
So back to our button here in the second state

147
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:53,710
and we will change the outline color here also to a green

148
00:08:56,600 --> 00:08:59,500
Soand this is it for the states now

149
00:09:00,540 --> 00:09:04,080
So if we head over back to the base set here

150
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:08,050
you'll see that the position is getting changed

151
00:09:09,590 --> 00:09:12,250
And to activate this transition now

152
00:09:12,250 --> 00:09:17,500
we will create a new event and not by start here

153
00:09:17,500 --> 00:09:20,290
but with the click of button here

154
00:09:20,510 --> 00:09:24,320
So maybe just the mouse down event

155
00:09:25,280 --> 00:09:28,750
And then we will trigger a transition now

156
00:09:30,120 --> 00:09:33,180
So in this transition is applied to the button

157
00:09:34,280 --> 00:09:35,180
And for mode

158
00:09:35,190 --> 00:09:37,120
now we will choose the toggle function

159
00:09:37,250 --> 00:09:40,840
So this transition is not only played one

160
00:09:40,840 --> 00:09:42,980
so it doesn't just go on the right side

161
00:09:42,980 --> 00:09:57,000
but it also toggles back to the left side If I click on the button again and I want to transition from the base date to the state here now

162
00:09:57,050 --> 00:09:58,260
so is the second state

163
00:09:59,830 --> 00:10:00,440
Okay

164
00:10:00,450 --> 00:10:01,880
that's it for now

165
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:05,420
So if I simulate now again and click on the button

166
00:10:06,110 --> 00:10:11,160
you now see that it's moving to the right side and the color is also c​‌​‌​​‌‌​​‌‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌​‌‌‌​​‌‌​​‌‌​​‌‌​‌​‌​​‌‌​​‌‌​​‌‌‌​​‌‌‌​‌​‌‌​​​‌‌​‌​‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌​‌‌​​​‌‌‌‌‌‌​​‌‌​‌‌‌​​‌‌​‌​‌​​‌‌‌​‌‌​​‌‌​​​‌​​‌‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌‌​​‌‌‌​‌​​​‌​​‌‌​‌​‌​​‌‌​‌​‌​​‌‌​‌​‌​​‌‌‌​​‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌​​​‌‌‌​‌‌​​‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌​​‌‌‌​‌‌​​‌‌​‌‌​​​‌‌​​‌‌​​‌‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌​‌​‌‌‌​‌​‌‌‌‌‌​‌‌​​‌​​‌‌​​‌‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌‌​​‌​​‌‌‌​​‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌‌​​‌‌‌​‌​‌‌‌​​‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌​​​‌‌‌‌‌​​​‌‌​​‌‌​​‌‌​​​‌​​‌‌​​‌‌​​‌‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌​‌‌‌​​‌‌‌‌‌​​​‌‌​‌‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌​‌‌​​‌‌​‌​‌‌‌​‌​‌‌​​​‌‌​‌​‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌​‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌​‌‌​​​‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌​‌‌​​​‌‌​‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌‌​​‌‌​‌‌‌‌‌​‌​‌​‌​​‌‌​‌​‌​​‌‌​‌​‌‌‌​‌‌​​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌‌​​‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌​​‌‌‌​​‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌​‌‌​​​‌‌‌​​‌‌‌​‌​‌‌‌‌‌​‌​‌​‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌​​​‌​​‌‌‌​​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌​‌‌​​‌‌​​‌‌​​‌‌​‌​‌​​‌‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌​‌​‌‌‌​‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌​‌‌‌​​‌‌‌​​‌​​‌‌‌​​‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌​‌‌‌​​‌‌​‌‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌​​​‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌​​‌​​‌‌​‌​‌‌‌​‌​‌‌‌​​‌‌​‌‌​​​‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌​‌‌‌​​‌‌‌‌‌​​​‌‌​‌​‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌‌​​‌‌‌​‌​‌‌‌‌‌​‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌‌​​‌‌‌‌‌‌​​‌‌​‌‌‌​​‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌‌​​‌​​‌‌​​‌‌​​‌‌‌​​‌​​‌‌‌​​‌​​‌‌​‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌hanging to green

167
00:10:11,570 --> 00:10:16,690
Sobut what you might notice is that this little background here is not getting green

168
00:10:17,240 --> 00:10:20,380
And to also activate this transition

169
00:10:20,390 --> 00:10:25,160
now we can just simply head over back to our event center here

170
00:10:26,430 --> 00:10:29,750
And then we have to create a new transition

171
00:10:30,170 --> 00:10:30,820
So again

172
00:10:30,820 --> 00:10:37,010
click the plus icon here for a new transition and then choose the targets

173
00:10:37,010 --> 00:10:38,310
the slider background

174
00:10:38,310 --> 00:10:39,400
So not the button anymore

175
00:10:39,520 --> 00:10:41,190
but the slider background

176
00:10:42,270 --> 00:10:42,910
then again

177
00:10:42,910 --> 00:10:44,240
also the toggle feature

178
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:47,150
So it just move

179
00:10:47,460 --> 00:10:48,870
When it moves to the right

180
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:49,790
it's getting green

181
00:10:49,790 --> 00:10:50,920
And if you toggle it back

182
00:10:50,920 --> 00:10:52,850
it's getting right again

183
00:10:53,580 --> 00:10:59,370
And then also we do a transition here from the base state to the second state

184
00:11:01,100 --> 00:11:01,630
And yeah

185
00:11:01,730 --> 00:11:02,980
that's it

186
00:11:03,990 --> 00:11:05,570
And then when you simulate again

187
00:11:05,570 --> 00:11:07,900
now we have

188
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:09,760
I don't

189
00:11:09,780 --> 00:11:11,350
this doesn't work for now

190
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:14,440
I think I missed one feature here

191
00:11:14,920 --> 00:11:15,950
Hiokay

192
00:11:15,960 --> 00:11:16,460
okay

193
00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:19,540
So I don't know why it changed back to once

194
00:11:19,550 --> 00:11:24,670
but if you click here again on the toggle function here from the button now

195
00:11:25,870 --> 00:11:27,070
now it should work

196
00:11:27,100 --> 00:11:28,670
So when you simulate again

197
00:11:29,280 --> 00:11:34,070
you now see that the outline now is changing to green and the button also

198
00:11:34,080 --> 00:11:35,650
if I click on it again

199
00:11:35,650 --> 00:11:43,800
now it goes back to the original position and also back to the red color and the red outline here

200
00:11:44,930 --> 00:11:49,370
Soand I think this looks pretty cool for now

201
00:11:49,380 --> 00:11:56,180
So this is a nice little project to introduce you to the state and events topic

202
00:11:56,390 --> 00:11:58,420
And in the further course

203
00:11:58,420 --> 00:12:02,500
we will make some more advanced and complex events

204
00:12:02,500 --> 00:12:05,980
So this is just a little introduction

205
00:12:06,050 --> 00:12:09,330
So you know how to apply states and events
