1
00:00:00,360 --> 00:00:01,420
So in this lecture

2
00:00:01,420 --> 00:00:03,250
we will talk about materials

3
00:00:03,260 --> 00:00:07,220
which is a quite important but also big topic here

4
00:00:07,270 --> 00:00:08,420
As you can imagine

5
00:00:08,510 --> 00:00:10,320
no matter what shape you're building

6
00:00:10,420 --> 00:00:13,860
or also no matter what animation you're creating

7
00:00:13,910 --> 00:00:17,520
it comes to life with some different sets of materials

8
00:00:17,700 --> 00:00:19,810
And this is what I'm going to show you now

9
00:00:19,810 --> 00:00:21,160
what's possible here

10
00:00:21,170 --> 00:00:22,620
and let's get started

11
00:00:23,060 --> 00:00:25,080
So back in our spline program here

12
00:00:25,080 --> 00:00:28,540
I will just quickly create a little text here

13
00:00:30,110 --> 00:00:31,150
And for the content

14
00:00:31,150 --> 00:00:33,440
I will maybe just write material

15
00:00:34,720 --> 00:00:36,720
make it a little bit bigger here

16
00:00:37,240 --> 00:00:40,220
And now you notice whenever you create an object

17
00:00:40,440 --> 00:00:44,270
no matter if it's a text or a shape or anything else

18
00:00:44,550 --> 00:00:48,850
you always have this kind of like gray look here

19
00:00:48,870 --> 00:00:53,000
And this is just the default material created by spline here

20
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:56,160
which consists of a color and the lighting here

21
00:00:56,290 --> 00:00:57,630
So in general

22
00:00:57,660 --> 00:00:59,300
this is the Material tab here

23
00:00:59,300 --> 00:01:04,210
So every material properties will just be inserted or deleted here

24
00:01:04,220 --> 00:01:04,670
And again

25
00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:05,860
just by default

26
00:01:05,860 --> 00:01:08,460
you have your color and lighting here

27
00:01:08,460 --> 00:01:12,310
which then concludes in this gray look here

28
00:01:12,450 --> 00:01:19,040
And now what's quite important to notice here is that materials are generally built up in layers here

29
00:01:19,160 --> 00:01:20,030
So for example

30
00:01:20,030 --> 00:01:22,450
now we have a lighting layer and the color layer

31
00:01:23,320 --> 00:01:26,030
but we can now also add another layer here

32
00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:28,980
And this can be done by this plus icon here

33
00:01:29,500 --> 00:01:31,210
and then a new layer is created

34
00:01:31,450 --> 00:01:32,260
So by default

35
00:01:32,360 --> 00:01:32,840
it's again

36
00:01:32,840 --> 00:01:34,560
just the color layer here

37
00:01:34,620 --> 00:01:37,980
But if you now click on this little arrow down here

38
00:01:38,700 --> 00:01:42,260
you now have a bunch of options which you can choose from here

39
00:01:42,610 --> 00:01:45,770
And about all these options we will talk in a few minutes

40
00:01:45,780 --> 00:01:46,350
So for now

41
00:01:46,350 --> 00:01:50,900
I will just give a quickly and general overview of the Material tab here

42
00:01:51,010 --> 00:01:54,100
So this is how you can create a new layer

43
00:01:54,160 --> 00:01:58,150
but you can also just delete it here by using the red X here

44
00:01:58,160 --> 00:02:03,710
And you can also just hide your material layer by clicking on this eye icon here

45
00:02:03,710 --> 00:02:05,820
So you can hide it or show it

46
00:02:06,050 --> 00:02:08,730
And here on the top by the value 100

47
00:02:08,740 --> 00:02:11,920
this is just your overall opacity here

48
00:02:11,930 --> 00:02:15,970
So if you maybe reduce your opacity to 30

49
00:02:16,330 --> 00:02:22,940
you now see that the material text is getting a lot darker here because the opacity was reduced

50
00:02:23,170 --> 00:02:28,100
And this can be and just changed again to 100 here

51
00:02:28,150 --> 00:02:30,430
But also some layers have

52
00:02:30,750 --> 00:02:32,600
yeahtheir own opacity tap here

53
00:02:32,600 --> 00:02:34,250
so you don't have to reduce

54
00:02:34,330 --> 00:02:35,900
So opacity overall

55
00:02:35,900 --> 00:02:40,860
you can also just change the opacity here from layer to layer

56
00:02:41,030 --> 00:02:41,520
But again

57
00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:43,870
this is not possible for every material layer

58
00:02:43,990 --> 00:02:47,800
So keep in mind to look at what's possible here

59
00:02:48,060 --> 00:02:49,010
So the next step

60
00:02:49,010 --> 00:02:50,760
we also have this little icon here

61
00:02:50,760 --> 00:02:51,830
which is the blending mode

62
00:02:51,890 --> 00:02:55,320
So you have normal multiply screen and overlay

63
00:02:56,090 --> 00:02:56,590
But yeah

64
00:02:56,590 --> 00:02:57,630
what this does

65
00:02:57,640 --> 00:02:59,940
we will also talk about in a few minutes here

66
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:03,140
so I will not go deeper inside of you

67
00:03:03,520 --> 00:03:04,260
And next up

68
00:03:04,260 --> 00:03:06,990
we also have those four dots here

69
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,540
And if you click on it

70
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:11,750
a material assets library will open here

71
00:03:11,850 --> 00:03:13,190
Sobut generally

72
00:03:13,190 --> 00:03:17,640
you can also just save your material at any time

73
00:03:17,970 --> 00:03:20,420
So by just clicking on this plus icon

74
00:03:20,420 --> 00:03:23,810
you will just save your settings from down below here

75
00:03:24,060 --> 00:03:25,980
you can also just give it a name

76
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,070
So maybe just default material

77
00:03:29,390 --> 00:03:33,250
And you also just have some materials here from the spline library

78
00:03:33,250 --> 00:03:34,420
which you can use

79
00:03:34,430 --> 00:03:39,390
So here are a bunch of different materials from patterns to gradients

80
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:41,470
but also metals and many

81
00:03:41,470 --> 00:03:42,050
many more

82
00:03:42,050 --> 00:03:45,070
So you can just take one of those if you want

83
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:46,650
And yeah

84
00:03:46,650 --> 00:03:48,940
this is just the general introduction

85
00:03:48,940 --> 00:03:49,960
Now for the material

86
00:03:49,970 --> 00:03:50,840
tap here

87
00:03:51,310 --> 00:03:53,990
And maybe if you don't bound on the material

88
00:03:53,990 --> 00:03:56,250
you can also just unbound it again

89
00:03:56,250 --> 00:03:58,760
And then you have your layer structure again

90
00:03:58,910 --> 00:03:59,660
So again

91
00:03:59,730 --> 00:04:03,490
this is just when you're using a material from the library here

92
00:04:03,500 --> 00:04:05,910
you can then just unlink it again

93
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:09,190
and then you have your material layer structure again

94
00:04:09,330 --> 00:04:14,210
Soand to show you guys what the different material layers do

95
00:04:14,220 --> 00:04:19,600
I just prepared a kind of matrix here for every material layer

96
00:04:20,060 --> 00:04:27,360
So we have just here on the left side of material layers that are available in spline here

97
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:28,760
And on the right side

98
00:04:28,760 --> 00:04:30,940
we have a different blending mode here

99
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:35,300
Soand now to show you guys what the different material properties do

100
00:04:35,300 --> 00:04:36,060
in the end

101
00:04:36,200 --> 00:04:38,180
I just prepared a little

102
00:04:38,610 --> 00:04:40,520
yeahlike matrix here

103
00:04:40,530 --> 00:04:46,060
which has every material layer inside of here and also every blending mode here

104
00:04:46,060 --> 00:04:47,600
which I just talked about

105
00:04:47,890 --> 00:04:50,380
So we kind of have now here

106
00:04:50,380 --> 00:04:53,240
maybe for the first material layer

107
00:04:53,240 --> 00:04:54,260
the lighting layer

108
00:04:54,500 --> 00:04:55,430
we have now here

109
00:04:55,500 --> 00:04:57,290
the normal lighting layer

110
00:04:57,330 --> 00:04:59,340
then we have a multiply

111
00:04:59,920 --> 00:05:01,400
then the screen

112
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:03,460
and then the overlay

113
00:05:04,010 --> 00:05:08,240
And this is just then continued for every material layer here

114
00:05:08,790 --> 00:05:13,860
And then we will just do a simply walk through to the different material layers

115
00:05:13,890 --> 00:05:16,890
And we will just start now with the lighting layer

116
00:05:17,100 --> 00:05:19,640
So now we have our 4 spheres here

117
00:05:19,750 --> 00:05:20,400
and again

118
00:05:20,430 --> 00:05:23,110
they just differ by the blending mode here

119
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:26,880
So they have all kind of the same material properties

120
00:05:26,890 --> 00:05:31,310
but just another blending mode here and the lighting material layer

121
00:05:31,780 --> 00:05:32,090
So

122
00:05:32,090 --> 00:05:36,600
and if you insert the lighting material layer in your material group

123
00:05:36,760 --> 00:05:43,220
this just basically means that your material is actually interacting with the lighting environment

124
00:05:43,460 --> 00:05:44,460
So for example

125
00:05:44,470 --> 00:05:47,800
if I maybe just deactivate the lighting layer

126
00:05:47,910 --> 00:05:58,020
you now see that the color is just gray here and doesn't really interact with our directional light or any light source that is available in the scene

127
00:05:58,290 --> 00:06:00,740
And this is just in general

128
00:06:00,750 --> 00:06:03,240
what the lighting layer does

129
00:06:03,260 --> 00:06:03,650
So

130
00:06:03,650 --> 00:06:06,940
and then if we go inside of the lighting material layer here

131
00:06:06,950 --> 00:06:10,140
we just see a bunch of options with that we can change here

132
00:06:10,140 --> 00:06:10,740
So for example

133
00:06:11,060 --> 00:06:14,480
I just made every reflection here in the color red

134
00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:16,600
So you see it just a little bit better

135
00:06:17,140 --> 00:06:21,210
But we will maybe just start here with the type of the lighting

136
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:22,320
And for the type

137
00:06:22,320 --> 00:06:25,170
you've got four different options to choose from

138
00:06:25,170 --> 00:06:26,750
So you've got Lambert form

139
00:06:26,760 --> 00:06:28,540
physical and tune here

140
00:06:28,690 --> 00:06:31,180
and the most commonly used are Lambert and FG

141
00:06:32,130 --> 00:06:39,560
so they differ kind of like in the way that Fong has a specular reflection here and Lamber does not

142
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:49,260
So Lambert is most likely to get used for like matte materials and fog is for more like shiny materials here

143
00:06:49,420 --> 00:06:54,470
So the funk type is just generally selected by default here in Spline

144
00:06:54,980 --> 00:06:58,330
and you just saw that I change the color of it

145
00:06:58,330 --> 00:06:59,950
so you can just change

146
00:07:00,100 --> 00:07:03,240
change the color of the spul reflection here

147
00:07:03,610 --> 00:07:06,920
And you can also increase or decrease the shininess

148
00:07:06,930 --> 00:07:12,220
So you get the light more concentrated area of the specular reflection here

149
00:07:12,530 --> 00:07:15,620
or you can also smooth it out a little bit here

150
00:07:15,790 --> 00:07:18,230
And now if you choose the type Lambert here

151
00:07:18,230 --> 00:07:21,450
you now see that the specular reflection disappears now

152
00:07:21,990 --> 00:07:24,760
and now if I change the color here of the lamber

153
00:07:24,870 --> 00:07:26,520
you see what it does

154
00:07:26,670 --> 00:07:31,720
So you don't have a really like concentrated area of reflection

155
00:07:31,940 --> 00:07:36,710
You just have a more kind of like smoothed out lighting behavior

156
00:07:36,740 --> 00:07:37,610
And Lambert

157
00:07:37,830 --> 00:07:41,900
and this is just great for using in matte materials

158
00:07:42,330 --> 00:07:43,270
So next up

159
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:46,270
you have the physical lighting type here

160
00:07:46,390 --> 00:07:48,400
this one also got specular reflection

161
00:07:48,660 --> 00:07:51,480
but you can just change some more options here

162
00:07:51,550 --> 00:07:55,120
So you can increase or decrease the roughness here

163
00:07:55,500 --> 00:08:00,880
You can increase or decrease the metals and also the activity

164
00:08:01,640 --> 00:08:02,760
And last but not least

165
00:08:02,770 --> 00:08:04,990
we have the tune lighting layer

166
00:08:06,050 --> 00:08:12,170
and this one is also just a little bit of a mixture of everything here

167
00:08:13,060 --> 00:08:17,020
so you can change the color and also the shininess here

168
00:08:17,030 --> 00:08:19,440
So next up we have Fresnel here

169
00:08:19,470 --> 00:08:20,060
And again

170
00:08:20,060 --> 00:08:20,730
for the setup

171
00:08:20,730 --> 00:08:25,450
we have the same material setup for every of those spheres here

172
00:08:25,460 --> 00:08:26,690
They just differ

173
00:08:26,950 --> 00:08:28,090
The blending mode here

174
00:08:28,100 --> 00:08:32,760
And maybe what I have to mention is that we just kept now our lighting layer here

175
00:08:32,760 --> 00:08:35,410
So maybe if you just deactivate it

176
00:08:35,410 --> 00:08:39,400
you see how it looks like without the lighting layer

177
00:08:39,410 --> 00:08:50,480
but I think the lighting layer is just an important layer and I will just keep it inside of every other showcasing here for the materials

178
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:52,730
Soand next up

179
00:08:52,740 --> 00:08:54,440
we have matte caps here

180
00:08:54,450 --> 00:08:58,030
So matte caps just simply stands for Material Capture

181
00:08:58,310 --> 00:09:07,000
so it's kind of a material with a single texture that stores static lighting and reflection information here

182
00:09:07,510 --> 00:09:11,690
and you can just access some medcaps here from the spline library

183
00:09:11,690 --> 00:09:16,300
So if you just insert it to Me Capp layer here

184
00:09:16,590 --> 00:09:20,520
you can just simply browse some of the spline libraries here

185
00:09:20,620 --> 00:09:23,720
So you have different options to choose from

186
00:09:24,410 --> 00:09:31,300
Every of those just has a different texture and also some different reflection informations here

187
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:35,230
but I will maybe just stick around with this here

188
00:09:35,240 --> 00:09:36,090
and now again

189
00:09:36,090 --> 00:09:48,500
you see by using different blending modes here how it looks and this connection here between all of those layers is actually 1 I personally also use a lot

190
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:51,390
So the lighting fresnel and medcap 1 here

191
00:09:51,390 --> 00:09:52,970
So with this combination

192
00:09:52,970 --> 00:09:54,240
you just can create

193
00:09:54,590 --> 00:09:55,640
So yeah

194
00:09:55,650 --> 00:10:02,560
realistic materials and you can just try it out for yourself with those different options

195
00:10:02,780 --> 00:10:07,040
You also have the possibility to just upload your own mat cap here

196
00:10:07,310 --> 00:10:08,350
This can be also done

197
00:10:08,350 --> 00:10:11,070
You will find most madcaps online

198
00:10:11,840 --> 00:10:12,660
some free ones

199
00:10:12,660 --> 00:10:14,390
but also some paid ones here

200
00:10:14,390 --> 00:10:15,910
which you can just upload

201
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:17,530
And yeah

202
00:10:17,540 --> 00:10:19,800
this is it for the mat cap here

203
00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:22,610
So next up we talk about image and video

204
00:10:22,610 --> 00:10:25,880
So those ones have kind of like the same settings

205
00:10:26,520 --> 00:10:31,990
They only differ in the way that a video is like an image sequence here

206
00:10:32,050 --> 00:10:33,140
Soyeah

207
00:10:33,140 --> 00:10:36,570
it's just shown as a video while I'm rendering here

208
00:10:36,570 --> 00:10:37,340
For example

209
00:10:37,340 --> 00:10:39,240
you have this little cat here

210
00:10:39,490 --> 00:10:43,770
and this is just a static frame or a static image here

211
00:10:43,840 --> 00:10:47,380
Soand if we maybe go inside of the image settings here

212
00:10:47,390 --> 00:10:50,890
againyou have some different kind of options to choose from

213
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:54,790
So there are also some images here in the spline library

214
00:10:54,790 --> 00:10:56,020
which you can use

215
00:10:56,130 --> 00:10:59,280
but you can also just use your own image here

216
00:11:00,010 --> 00:11:01,150
Then on the bottom

217
00:11:01,150 --> 00:11:02,750
we have some more settings here

218
00:11:02,750 --> 00:11:06,320
So the most important one is maybe the projection mode here

219
00:11:06,610 --> 00:11:10,370
So you have the possibility to choose in between UV

220
00:11:10,370 --> 00:11:11,760
planarspherical

221
00:11:11,770 --> 00:11:14,200
cylindricalor triplanar here

222
00:11:14,380 --> 00:11:19,030
And this is just depending on what kind of shape you're using

223
00:11:19,030 --> 00:11:19,740
So for example

224
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:21,740
now we use a sphere here

225
00:11:21,740 --> 00:11:26,560
So it just makes sense that we use the spherical project here

226
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:27,290
But yeah

227
00:11:27,290 --> 00:11:31,450
if you're using a cylinder or like a plane or something else

228
00:11:31,630 --> 00:11:35,940
it's quite dependent on the shapes you're using here

229
00:11:36,330 --> 00:11:39,170
So now maybe if I just use planar here

230
00:11:39,180 --> 00:11:42,380
you now see that it's projected on the plane here

231
00:11:42,820 --> 00:11:43,830
And now you can

232
00:11:43,830 --> 00:11:44,450
for example

233
00:11:44,910 --> 00:11:48,760
now choose the axis which you want to be displayed

234
00:11:49,610 --> 00:11:50,310
So for example

235
00:11:50,500 --> 00:11:52,260
now this is the z axis

236
00:11:52,550 --> 00:11:55,200
which the image will be projected to

237
00:11:55,750 --> 00:12:00,960
And you can also choose if you want to have both sides projected here

238
00:12:01,080 --> 00:12:01,690
So for example

239
00:12:01,690 --> 00:12:06,560
I can only also just only use the front side here or the back side

240
00:12:06,820 --> 00:12:07,910
but also both

241
00:12:07,910 --> 00:12:08,850
Of course

242
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:11,580
then you have the wrapping here

243
00:12:11,580 --> 00:12:13,270
You can just do clamp

244
00:12:13,270 --> 00:12:14,740
repeator mirror here

245
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:17,270
Then you also have some sharpness settings here

246
00:12:17,270 --> 00:12:22,280
So you can choose in between pixelated or crisp or smooth here

247
00:12:22,520 --> 00:12:24,070
so you don't really see it

248
00:12:25,860 --> 00:12:27,500
A minor effect here

249
00:12:28,420 --> 00:12:30,100
but maybe you see it this way

250
00:12:30,960 --> 00:12:34,670
Then you can also choose if you want to crop the image or no

251
00:12:34,680 --> 00:12:38,550
And you also can apply some scale if you want to

252
00:12:39,070 --> 00:12:44,280
And both X and Y can also choose an offset

253
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,530
so just a symmetrical image

254
00:12:47,550 --> 00:12:48,900
But yeah

255
00:12:49,070 --> 00:12:50,330
for other images

256
00:12:50,340 --> 00:12:52,480
this can be also just quite helpful

257
00:12:52,860 --> 00:12:55,700
And you can also do a rotation here

258
00:12:57,470 --> 00:12:58,030
And again

259
00:12:58,030 --> 00:13:00,430
if you want to upload an O image

260
00:13:00,440 --> 00:13:01,470
you can do so

261
00:13:01,670 --> 00:13:04,120
So for example I've got some leaves here

262
00:13:04,270 --> 00:13:06,980
but this could be anything you want here

263
00:13:07,500 --> 00:13:12,470
and then it can be also just quite helpful to use overlaying modes here

264
00:13:12,470 --> 00:13:13,230
for example

265
00:13:14,090 --> 00:13:15,370
any other blending modes

266
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:19,610
So you can just create some really nice materials with this effect

267
00:13:19,700 --> 00:13:20,330
And yeah

268
00:13:20,330 --> 00:13:24,180
this is just again the same for the videos here

269
00:13:25,160 --> 00:13:27,090
You have kind of like the same settings here

270
00:13:27,090 --> 00:13:32,040
but it's just a video and not a single image here

271
00:13:32,230 --> 00:13:35,740
So and next up we will talk about depth and gradient here

272
00:13:35,740 --> 00:13:37,990
So those two might look very similar

273
00:13:38,210 --> 00:13:40,410
but they have some small differences

274
00:13:40,580 --> 00:13:43,040
which I will explain in a few seconds here

275
00:13:43,050 --> 00:13:43,600
But first

276
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:46,470
we will just start with the properties of

277
00:13:46,630 --> 00:13:48,680
yeaheach material layer here

278
00:13:48,690 --> 00:13:52,180
Soand then if we go inside of the dev settings here

279
00:13:52,190 --> 00:13:55,670
we have some different options to choose from ​‌​‌​​‌‌​​‌‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌​‌‌‌​​‌‌​​‌‌​​‌‌​​​‌​​‌‌​​‌‌​​‌‌‌​​‌​​‌‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌​‌​‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌​‌‌​​​‌‌‌‌‌‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌​‌​‌​​‌‌‌​‌‌​​‌‌​​​‌​​‌‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌​‌‌​​​‌‌‌‌‌‌​​‌‌​​​‌​​‌‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌​‌​‌​​‌‌​‌​‌​​‌‌‌​​‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌​​​‌‌‌​‌‌​​‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌​​‌‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌​‌‌​​​‌‌​​‌‌​​‌‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌​‌​‌‌‌​‌​‌‌‌‌‌​‌‌​​‌​​‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌​‌‌‌​​‌‌​‌‌‌​​‌‌‌‌‌‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌‌​​‌‌‌​‌​‌‌‌​​‌‌‌‌‌​​​‌‌​‌‌​​​‌‌‌‌‌​​​‌‌​‌‌​​​‌‌​​​‌​​‌‌​​‌‌​​‌‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌​‌‌‌​​‌‌‌‌‌​​​‌‌​‌‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌​‌‌​​‌‌​‌​‌‌‌​‌​‌‌‌​​‌‌​‌​‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌​‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌​‌‌​​​‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌​​​‌​​‌‌​‌​‌‌‌​‌​‌‌​​​‌‌​‌‌‌‌‌​‌​‌​‌​​‌‌​‌​‌​​‌‌​‌​‌‌‌​‌‌​​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌‌​​‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌​​‌‌‌​​‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌​‌‌​​​‌‌‌​​‌‌‌​‌​‌‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌​‌‌​​‌‌‌‌‌‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌​‌‌​​‌‌​​‌‌​​‌‌‌​​‌​​‌‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌​‌​‌‌‌​‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌​​​‌‌‌‌‌‌​​‌‌‌​​‌​​‌‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌​‌‌‌​​‌‌​‌‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌​​​‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌​​‌​​‌‌​‌​‌‌‌​‌​‌‌‌​​‌‌​‌‌​​​‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌​‌‌‌​​‌‌‌‌‌​​​‌‌​‌​‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌‌​​‌‌‌​‌​‌‌‌‌‌​‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌‌​​‌‌‌‌‌‌​​‌‌​‌‌‌​​‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌‌​​‌​​‌‌​​‌‌​​‌‌‌​​‌​​‌‌‌​​‌​​‌‌​‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌again

280

281
00:13:59,030 --> 00:14:03,640
we can change the origin to vector or camera

282
00:14:05,340 --> 00:14:07,290
And we also have a blending mode here

283
00:14:07,290 --> 00:14:10,710
So we can choose linear or smooth

284
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:11,830
This is just the

285
00:14:12,280 --> 00:14:13,840
yeahlike a little difference

286
00:14:13,970 --> 00:14:16,250
but you can use it if you want to

287
00:14:16,420 --> 00:14:23,400
And then we have the ramp here where you can change the color of your the gradient to anything you want here

288
00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:28,570
You can also just add colors here by clicking onto the color slider

289
00:14:28,990 --> 00:14:30,750
And then you have the type here

290
00:14:30,860 --> 00:14:31,740
which is by default

291
00:14:31,750 --> 00:14:32,460
add linear

292
00:14:32,610 --> 00:14:34,650
But you can also use the radio 1

293
00:14:35,190 --> 00:14:39,910
And this is maybe the time where I will just introduce a cross section now

294
00:14:39,930 --> 00:14:45,860
so the dev is more likely to get used for like three dimensional objects here

295
00:14:45,970 --> 00:14:51,060
So if you're using a radial like Def gradient

296
00:14:51,420 --> 00:14:59,850
you have to notice that your gradient actually applies from the middle of your shape to the outer side of the shape here

297
00:14:59,980 --> 00:15:08,360
So you have to keep in mind that that is why you only see now the yellow color because the green color is basically inside of the sphere here

298
00:15:09,250 --> 00:15:13,400
Soand then I will just simply change back to the linear type here

299
00:15:13,610 --> 00:15:16,340
And we will just continue with position here

300
00:15:16,350 --> 00:15:17,540
So for the position

301
00:15:17,540 --> 00:15:20,530
you can choose the local or world coordinate system

302
00:15:20,900 --> 00:15:28,430
And then you also see that the origin values are also getting changed when you go to the world mode here

303
00:15:29,180 --> 00:15:30,840
then you have the direction here

304
00:15:30,840 --> 00:15:31,790
So for example

305
00:15:32,090 --> 00:15:36,080
if I place a one inside of the y value

306
00:15:36,230 --> 00:15:39,780
you now see that I get a 45 degree angle here

307
00:15:39,790 --> 00:15:42,110
And this is just the same before

308
00:15:42,310 --> 00:15:43,540
maybe like that

309
00:15:43,540 --> 00:15:45,700
So it will be pushed inside here

310
00:15:45,910 --> 00:15:50,120
But you can just play around and get a little nice rotation here

311
00:15:51,620 --> 00:15:55,980
And then you also have the near and far values here

312
00:15:55,980 --> 00:15:59,690
So this is just where the gradient starts

313
00:15:59,780 --> 00:16:04,390
So you just see it here by this little arrow here and the color pi

314
00:16:05,270 --> 00:16:07,490
So you can just move it around here

315
00:16:07,490 --> 00:16:09,000
So this is just a nice

316
00:16:09,010 --> 00:16:10,670
a nice little indicator

317
00:16:11,330 --> 00:16:14,630
And you can do this also for the file value

318
00:16:16,880 --> 00:16:20,090
And this is it for the dev settings here

319
00:16:21,450 --> 00:16:23,670
So and now for the gradient settings

320
00:16:23,670 --> 00:16:29,300
Now you maybe notice that it kind of looks like it only has one color here

321
00:16:29,650 --> 00:16:31,510
But if we rotate around

322
00:16:32,150 --> 00:16:38,840
you now see that the gradient is actually applied to the whole surface of the sphere here

323
00:16:38,900 --> 00:16:42,690
And this is the main difference between both of those here

324
00:16:42,690 --> 00:16:44,460
So depth and gradient

325
00:16:44,920 --> 00:16:45,620
So again

326
00:16:45,620 --> 00:16:51,800
the gradient of the depth material layer just go inside of the cross section also

327
00:16:52,130 --> 00:16:53,820
But when you're using gradients

328
00:16:53,820 --> 00:16:57,900
it's most likely to get used on the surface here

329
00:16:58,090 --> 00:17:00,930
And now for the settings of the gradient layer

330
00:17:00,940 --> 00:17:04,180
it's kind of like the same as for the dev 1 here

331
00:17:04,230 --> 00:17:04,930
So again

332
00:17:04,960 --> 00:17:07,420
you can choose mask or color mode here

333
00:17:07,440 --> 00:17:09,380
You can use the type here

334
00:17:09,490 --> 00:17:10,410
so linear

335
00:17:10,420 --> 00:17:11,720
radialor polar

336
00:17:13,420 --> 00:17:13,960
Then again

337
00:17:13,960 --> 00:17:16,700
you can also activate the blending function here

338
00:17:16,990 --> 00:17:18,380
You have your color ramp here

339
00:17:18,380 --> 00:17:19,800
which you can change

340
00:17:21,260 --> 00:17:24,450
and then you can also just set an angle here

341
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:26,720
So rotate your gradient around

342
00:17:27,620 --> 00:17:28,280
and again

343
00:17:28,280 --> 00:17:34,960
you have some offsets and you can also morph the gradient here

344
00:17:35,690 --> 00:17:38,020
So for the next material layers

345
00:17:38,130 --> 00:17:41,290
we just go back to our metrics here

346
00:17:41,300 --> 00:17:45,100
So those ones we just actually discussed here

347
00:17:45,100 --> 00:17:49,070
and now we can just continue with the bottom ones here

348
00:17:49,080 --> 00:17:51,090
So next up on the list

349
00:17:51,090 --> 00:17:53,140
we have the normal material layer

350
00:17:53,300 --> 00:17:55,320
so this is a quite simple one

351
00:17:55,320 --> 00:17:58,620
which has just this kind of looking

352
00:17:58,620 --> 00:18:00,940
So you can activate x

353
00:18:00,940 --> 00:18:02,080
yand z here

354
00:18:02,090 --> 00:18:04,100
And while you activating

355
00:18:04,110 --> 00:18:05,970
another color is added here

356
00:18:05,980 --> 00:18:10,710
So this is just a simple normal layer from spline itself

357
00:18:10,790 --> 00:18:14,030
So this is just not quite important

358
00:18:14,030 --> 00:18:15,250
You can use it of course

359
00:18:15,260 --> 00:18:19,110
but it's not really that customizable

360
00:18:19,500 --> 00:18:20,510
So and next up

361
00:18:20,520 --> 00:18:21,670
we have noise here

362
00:18:21,670 --> 00:18:26,020
so noise can be also just quite helpful in some situations here

363
00:18:26,200 --> 00:18:28,510
But if we look inside of the settings here

364
00:18:28,510 --> 00:18:29,460
maybe again

365
00:18:29,470 --> 00:18:31,350
you have the mask mode here

366
00:18:31,540 --> 00:18:35,230
but you also have some different kind of types to choose from

367
00:18:35,240 --> 00:18:38,060
So you have two simplex modes here

368
00:18:38,130 --> 00:18:40,030
you have ashima fpm

369
00:18:40,030 --> 00:18:41,900
purlinor veronii here

370
00:18:42,050 --> 00:18:45,890
and maybe if you just go from type to type

371
00:18:45,890 --> 00:18:49,310
you see the kind of like difference from each other

372
00:18:49,990 --> 00:18:52,010
And then you have just some

373
00:18:52,010 --> 00:18:55,650
againsome simple properties that you can change

374
00:18:55,710 --> 00:18:56,690
So for example

375
00:18:56,690 --> 00:18:58,600
the size here for simplex

376
00:18:58,770 --> 00:19:01,450
you can increase or decrease the scale here

377
00:19:01,450 --> 00:19:03,870
So less scale just means

378
00:19:04,980 --> 00:19:07,560
yeahlike more noisy here

379
00:19:08,180 --> 00:19:12,960
you can also change the movement here or the colors

380
00:19:12,970 --> 00:19:13,540
for example

381
00:19:15,720 --> 00:19:17,500
So we have four colors here

382
00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:24,400
And you can also just increase the distortion here in x and also in y

383
00:19:26,220 --> 00:19:28,760
and then you also have some factors here

384
00:19:28,760 --> 00:19:29,660
which you can

385
00:19:30,410 --> 00:19:31,870
yeahplay around with

386
00:19:32,680 --> 00:19:33,180
And yeah

387
00:19:33,180 --> 00:19:33,570
with noise

388
00:19:33,630 --> 00:19:36,210
you can just create some awesome materials here

389
00:19:36,210 --> 00:19:37,120
So for example

390
00:19:37,220 --> 00:19:46,780
maybe if I just copy the material here and paste it on this one and choose the overlay function here

391
00:19:47,450 --> 00:19:51,060
you see some really nice noise here

392
00:19:51,950 --> 00:19:55,000
interesting combination with some other material layers

393
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:58,500
You can just create some really cool looking materials

394
00:20:00,140 --> 00:20:00,930
And yeah

395
00:20:01,530 --> 00:20:04,170
so next up we have the rainbow effect

396
00:20:04,170 --> 00:20:09,300
So I like to use this a lot in combination with some iridescent materials

397
00:20:09,760 --> 00:20:12,790
but maybe if you just look inside of the settings here

398
00:20:12,790 --> 00:20:13,270
So again

399
00:20:13,270 --> 00:20:14,420
we have the mouse mode

400
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:17,150
And then next up we have the frequency

401
00:20:17,410 --> 00:20:21,080
So a higher frequency just means that you get more of those

402
00:20:21,310 --> 00:20:23,750
Yeahlike rainbow rings here

403
00:20:24,110 --> 00:20:30,840
and you can also change the movement here and you can change the color here

404
00:20:30,850 --> 00:20:36,120
so get it kind of like more retro style here

405
00:20:37,420 --> 00:20:43,580
Then you can also add some noise here and also scale up the noise or scale it down

406
00:20:44,220 --> 00:20:48,390
And also you have just some offset settings here

407
00:20:49,090 --> 00:20:49,660
And again

408
00:20:49,660 --> 00:20:55,190
just feel free to use those effects with the different blending modes that are available

409
00:20:55,190 --> 00:21:03,690
So you can also just use the screen multiply or overlay function and get some really cool effects done

410
00:21:04,310 --> 00:21:04,690
So

411
00:21:04,690 --> 00:21:05,870
and then next up

412
00:21:05,870 --> 00:21:07,530
we have the tune material layer

413
00:21:07,990 --> 00:21:08,740
So by now

414
00:21:08,740 --> 00:21:10,390
you don't really see that much

415
00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:13,490
but it's actually just because of the default state

416
00:21:14,320 --> 00:21:19,550
And if I just use maybe some red and some green

417
00:21:19,560 --> 00:21:20,100
for example

418
00:21:21,090 --> 00:21:23,150
you see it a little bit better here

419
00:21:23,970 --> 00:21:26,190
So maybe if I move it out a little bit

420
00:21:28,420 --> 00:21:29,390
You see what the tune does

421
00:21:29,750 --> 00:21:33,690
So you can just create some nice outlining effects

422
00:21:33,990 --> 00:21:35,660
And as the name maybe says

423
00:21:35,660 --> 00:21:39,260
you can also just use it for some cartoon style

424
00:21:40,580 --> 00:21:41,350
And then again

425
00:21:41,350 --> 00:21:43,440
you have some different options here

426
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:46,170
So you can apply an offset here if you want to

427
00:21:46,550 --> 00:21:50,450
can create some noise and also scale up the noise here

428
00:21:51,250 --> 00:21:54,100
And this is just also a little nice

429
00:21:54,220 --> 00:21:56,590
but not really often used material layer

430
00:21:57,960 --> 00:21:59,100
Soand then next up

431
00:21:59,100 --> 00:22:01,030
we have the outlet material layer here

432
00:22:01,110 --> 00:22:04,780
This 1 I also personally use a lot of my projects

433
00:22:04,920 --> 00:22:08,680
so maybe if we check out the settings here

434
00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:10,850
so first we've got the outline here

435
00:22:10,850 --> 00:22:14,220
this is this white line around the sphere

436
00:22:14,290 --> 00:22:15,190
So of course

437
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:22,770
we can just change the color here of the outline and we can also just change the width here with the slider

438
00:22:22,830 --> 00:22:23,860
Soand then next up

439
00:22:23,860 --> 00:22:25,740
we have the threshold here

440
00:22:25,750 --> 00:22:27,660
and this simply describes

441
00:22:28,430 --> 00:22:32,270
yeahhow much you see of the outline when zooming out

442
00:22:32,300 --> 00:22:33,140
So for example

443
00:22:33,140 --> 00:22:35,690
now I zoom out like here

444
00:22:35,700 --> 00:22:38,190
and then when I increase the threshold

445
00:22:38,320 --> 00:22:40,810
you now see a lot more of the outline still

446
00:22:40,840 --> 00:22:42,910
And when I'm decreasing it

447
00:22:42,930 --> 00:22:45,080
you see less of the outline here

448
00:22:45,170 --> 00:22:46,090
And then for the contra

449
00:22:46,140 --> 00:22:46,650
you can

450
00:22:46,910 --> 00:22:47,470
of course

451
00:22:47,480 --> 00:22:54,290
also just change the color here and also the width here and the threshold again

452
00:22:54,300 --> 00:22:54,790
So this is

453
00:22:54,790 --> 00:22:56,460
againwhen zooming out

454
00:22:58,410 --> 00:23:00,960
then you can increase or decrease frequency

455
00:23:01,270 --> 00:23:04,100
So depending on which wavelength here

456
00:23:04,100 --> 00:23:06,620
you see more lines or less lines here

457
00:23:07,080 --> 00:23:10,040
And then you can also change the direction here

458
00:23:10,230 --> 00:23:11,290
So again

459
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:13,220
maybe if you just choose y here

460
00:23:13,220 --> 00:23:15,480
you get these horizontal lines

461
00:23:15,840 --> 00:23:17,370
or if you're just using X

462
00:23:17,370 --> 00:23:19,230
you're getting vertical lines

463
00:23:19,240 --> 00:23:20,680
And if you activate both

464
00:23:20,690 --> 00:23:22,880
you get 45 degrees

465
00:23:23,900 --> 00:23:29,960
and then you can also change in between cont or continues here also

466
00:23:29,960 --> 00:23:31,980
depending on your use case

467
00:23:32,520 --> 00:23:34,630
So and then next up on the list

468
00:23:34,690 --> 00:23:36,360
we have the glass material layer

469
00:23:36,700 --> 00:23:38,690
So this one here

470
00:23:38,700 --> 00:23:40,470
I just added an outline effect

471
00:23:40,470 --> 00:23:46,470
So you see it better here because otherwise it would simply be invisible here

472
00:23:47,760 --> 00:23:50,830
But maybe if you now rotate around

473
00:23:51,260 --> 00:23:53,850
maybe here on the top side or something else

474
00:23:54,490 --> 00:23:57,150
we now see what the glass material does here

475
00:23:57,150 --> 00:24:01,790
So you can basically look through the glass element here

476
00:24:02,380 --> 00:24:04,460
And if we go inside of the settings

477
00:24:04,460 --> 00:24:07,010
you can change three properties here

478
00:24:07,010 --> 00:24:09,440
So blur thickness and refraction here

479
00:24:10,050 --> 00:24:12,540
And maybe if I decrease the blur

480
00:24:12,540 --> 00:24:16,800
you now better see what's behind of this sphere here

481
00:24:17,020 --> 00:24:21,480
So you can increase the blur and see less of what's behind

482
00:24:21,500 --> 00:24:22,060
Or you can

483
00:24:22,070 --> 00:24:26,830
you can decrease it and basically see through here

484
00:24:27,450 --> 00:24:34,170
And then you can also adjust the thickness here of the gloss and you can also the refraction

485
00:24:34,610 --> 00:24:35,830
So with those settings

486
00:24:35,830 --> 00:24:36,570
you can again

487
00:24:36,570 --> 00:24:40,120
just play around and see what fits to your design here

488
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:46,420
But the glass material is also like very popular and often used

489
00:24:47,680 --> 00:24:49,930
Definitely try to get familiar with this one

490
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:54,520
And then we will just continue with the display material layer

491
00:24:54,580 --> 00:24:58,560
So this is the only layer that doesn't have a blending mode available

492
00:24:59,450 --> 00:25:06,030
And maybe it looks quite different if you use it by default because I change the value

493
00:25:06,030 --> 00:25:12,490
Actuallymaybe if we go back to the yeah default value here of 8

494
00:25:12,850 --> 00:25:14,740
it doesn't really see that

495
00:25:15,300 --> 00:25:16,640
Yeahthis form here

496
00:25:16,670 --> 00:25:21,240
but you can change it in plus and also in a negative direction here

497
00:25:21,340 --> 00:25:24,320
And then it kind of looks like this here

498
00:25:24,340 --> 00:25:26,330
And if we go inside of the settings here

499
00:25:26,620 --> 00:25:27,160
we have

500
00:25:27,160 --> 00:25:31,580
againthe same options here as in the noise material layer

501
00:25:31,580 --> 00:25:35,060
So we have two simple legs times here

502
00:25:35,060 --> 00:25:36,020
Then we have ashima

503
00:25:36,020 --> 00:25:37,040
FBMpurlin

504
00:25:37,050 --> 00:25:38,280
and voronoi

505
00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:45,470
and they can all of those types look a little bit different from each other here

506
00:25:46,060 --> 00:25:47,230
And then you can

507
00:25:47,300 --> 00:25:50,020
againjust play around with the settings here

508
00:25:50,790 --> 00:25:51,860
So for example

509
00:25:51,860 --> 00:25:55,550
you can make those little edgy stars here

510
00:25:55,940 --> 00:25:57,720
and with a scale factor

511
00:25:58,220 --> 00:26:01,440
then you can also bring in some movement and again

512
00:26:01,440 --> 00:26:06,330
have the option to choose some values here for the offset

513
00:26:06,390 --> 00:26:06,770
So

514
00:26:06,770 --> 00:26:07,730
and last but not least

515
00:26:07,740 --> 00:26:10,510
we have the pattern material layer here

516
00:26:10,520 --> 00:26:13,360
And if we go inside of here in the settings

517
00:26:13,550 --> 00:26:17,230
we can choose in between some different paddings here

518
00:26:17,380 --> 00:26:17,890
For example

519
00:26:17,920 --> 00:26:19,040
we have a ring

520
00:26:19,040 --> 00:26:22,220
we have a polygen crosses

521
00:26:22,240 --> 00:26:24,380
diamondscheckboard

522
00:26:25,740 --> 00:26:26,440
and lines

523
00:26:26,440 --> 00:26:27,150
of course

524
00:26:27,160 --> 00:26:29,340
and also some waves here

525
00:26:29,980 --> 00:26:33,800
and then we have just some properties that we can change

526
00:26:33,830 --> 00:26:38,380
So maybe you remember from the image and video material layer

527
00:26:38,450 --> 00:26:43,130
we can change the projection mode here to spherical or also triplanar

528
00:26:43,630 --> 00:26:46,280
depending on what shape you're using

529
00:26:46,580 --> 00:26:47,190
Then of course

530
00:26:47,190 --> 00:26:50,290
againwe can change the offset values here

531
00:26:50,320 --> 00:26:55,460
We can also change the colors of the pattern here

532
00:26:56,380 --> 00:26:58,870
we can decrease or increase the frequency

533
00:26:58,980 --> 00:27:04,810
So if we want to more circles here or less circles in both x and y direction

534
00:27:06,280 --> 00:27:10,390
then we can also change the size here of the circles

535
00:27:11,970 --> 00:27:14,060
We can also bring in some variation

536
00:27:14,560 --> 00:27:17,620
So not every circle looks the same

537
00:27:17,620 --> 00:27:18,760
Here again

538
00:27:18,760 --> 00:27:25,940
we can apply some smoothness and also some zigzag here to bring in even more variation

539
00:27:26,410 --> 00:27:27,020
and again

540
00:27:27,020 --> 00:27:29,140
we have some rotation also

541
00:27:29,140 --> 00:27:32,610
So this kind of looks like now like a baseball maybe

542
00:27:33,130 --> 00:27:41,650
And then we can also just cut it in half or sew both in vertical and also in horizontal here

543
00:27:59,160 --> 00:27:59,530
So

544
00:27:59,530 --> 00:28:02,830
and now we only have one thing left on the list

545
00:28:02,840 --> 00:28:05,200
and this is the mask mode actually

546
00:28:05,300 --> 00:28:07,170
So to show you this 1

547
00:28:07,180 --> 00:28:14,030
I just prepared this little sphere and it's structured like it has two images here on top

548
00:28:14,040 --> 00:28:16,400
and then just the lighting and color layer

549
00:28:16,790 --> 00:28:18,740
And the first image is here

550
00:28:18,740 --> 00:28:22,410
just this red matte cap here from the library

551
00:28:22,510 --> 00:28:26,200
And the second one are those little bricks here

552
00:28:26,340 --> 00:28:28,910
Soand then to show you what the mask mode does

553
00:28:28,920 --> 00:28:30,430
I will create a new layer

554
00:28:30,440 --> 00:28:31,360
And for this 1

555
00:28:31,370 --> 00:28:33,520
I will use the noise 1 here

556
00:28:34,300 --> 00:28:36,600
And then inside of the noise settings

557
00:28:36,610 --> 00:28:40,050
we will then just activate the mask mode now

558
00:28:40,770 --> 00:28:48,330
And now what you see is that this noise effect is actually applied to this image down below

559
00:28:48,860 --> 00:28:54,970
And maybe if we now change the scale of the mask and now see the difference here

560
00:28:54,980 --> 00:28:57,820
so maybe I will reduce it a little bit here

561
00:28:58,930 --> 00:29:03,600
And then you actually see that the noise is applied to the image here

562
00:29:03,600 --> 00:29:07,940
So everywhere where the noise is or should be

563
00:29:08,160 --> 00:29:11,660
it's showing the image down below here

564
00:29:12,200 --> 00:29:13,420
And for example

565
00:29:13,430 --> 00:29:17,930
now I can also maybe change it here to something like this

566
00:29:17,930 --> 00:29:18,720
gold medca

567
00:29:19,110 --> 00:29:28,920
So now you see that the gold matte cap is shining through and you can just do it for every material here and also every combination here

568
00:29:28,920 --> 00:29:30,760
So it doesn't have to be an image

569
00:29:30,840 --> 00:29:33,040
You can also just choose a color

570
00:29:33,040 --> 00:29:34,230
for example now

571
00:29:34,710 --> 00:29:38,410
So I would just go by yellow now here

572
00:29:38,410 --> 00:29:41,980
And then you have this nice little ball here

573
00:29:42,260 --> 00:29:46,650
We have the noise Lus yellow here

574
00:29:47,030 --> 00:29:47,680
but again

575
00:29:47,680 --> 00:29:52,230
you also have just then parts of the medcap here

576
00:29:52,240 --> 00:29:53,780
So this one

577
00:29:53,780 --> 00:30:02,110
so this is just a really good example of how you can merge those things all together and create some really

578
00:30:02,110 --> 00:30:04,070
really cool materials

579
00:30:04,360 --> 00:30:08,480
And this is basically what the mouse mode does here

580
00:30:08,630 --> 00:30:09,400
But again

581
00:30:09,400 --> 00:30:10,790
you can just play around with it

582
00:30:10,790 --> 00:30:14,560
So there are endless possibilities how to use it

583
00:30:14,810 --> 00:30:18,380
This is just a little example here in combination with noise mode

584
00:30:18,930 --> 00:30:19,560
And yeah
