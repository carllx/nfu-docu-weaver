1
00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:00,980
So for now

2
00:00:00,980 --> 00:00:06,110
we will take a walk-through to the different kind of shapes that are available in the Spline editor

3
00:00:06,170 --> 00:00:10,610
So if you're not interested in watching every property of every shape

4
00:00:10,620 --> 00:00:13,350
feel free to skip to the next part of the course

5
00:00:13,730 --> 00:00:14,790
Sobut for now

6
00:00:14,790 --> 00:00:16,420
we will start with the first shape

7
00:00:16,710 --> 00:00:19,360
So if you go to the top two wire here

8
00:00:19,420 --> 00:00:21,960
you will see so in 2D shapes

9
00:00:22,200 --> 00:00:23,650
So in total

10
00:00:23,650 --> 00:00:24,750
you have the rectangle

11
00:00:24,830 --> 00:00:25,240
the ellipse

12
00:00:25,240 --> 00:00:25,740
the triangle

13
00:00:25,740 --> 00:00:26,320
the Pentagon

14
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:27,740
and the star 4

15
00:00:27,850 --> 00:00:29,340
the first demonstration

16
00:00:29,570 --> 00:00:32,740
So first we will take the rectangle here

17
00:00:33,830 --> 00:00:37,110
place it on the plane

18
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:41,240
and for a better a visibility I'm going to change the color of the plane now

19
00:00:41,240 --> 00:00:45,280
So you guys see the shapes

20
00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:49,120
And if you press now option and shift

21
00:00:49,130 --> 00:00:53,330
you can resize is plain to any size you want

22
00:00:54,200 --> 00:00:56,430
And also if you look on the red side

23
00:00:56,430 --> 00:01:11,580
now you have a table called shape here and also here you can change the size of the plane here or the rectangle and also you can change the corners of the rectangle

24
00:01:11,580 --> 00:01:13,890
So you make can make it rounded

25
00:01:14,740 --> 00:01:17,070
you can extrude the rectangle

26
00:01:18,310 --> 00:01:21,440
you can bevel it for smooth edges

27
00:01:22,060 --> 00:01:26,430
and you can also increase the bevel side 0

28
00:01:29,500 --> 00:01:31,680
So the second shape is the ellipse

29
00:01:31,780 --> 00:01:36,260
So if we go to the top two wire and click on the ellipse part

30
00:01:36,710 --> 00:01:39,450
you can again put it on the base plane

31
00:01:39,660 --> 00:01:41,620
And with option and shift

32
00:01:41,630 --> 00:01:46,820
you can make it bigger or bigger

33
00:01:47,500 --> 00:01:48,570
And for instance

34
00:01:48,570 --> 00:01:52,550
you can also change the properties here and the right to bar

35
00:01:52,590 --> 00:01:54,230
So in x and y position

36
00:01:54,330 --> 00:01:56,820
you can change the size here

37
00:01:57,070 --> 00:01:58,840
You can also make a ring

38
00:01:59,010 --> 00:02:02,130
you can change the angle

39
00:02:02,300 --> 00:02:05,500
so it's more like a progress bar or something

40
00:02:05,610 --> 00:02:09,480
You can change the sides so it's more edgy

41
00:02:11,700 --> 00:02:12,490
More rounded

42
00:02:13,310 --> 00:02:13,930
And extrude it

43
00:02:13,930 --> 00:02:14,780
of course

44
00:02:15,640 --> 00:02:21,250
and bevel it for smoother edges and also increase the bevel sides

45
00:02:21,770 --> 00:02:24,250
The third object now is the triangle

46
00:02:24,460 --> 00:02:25,580
So in the top tuba

47
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:27,090
click on the triangle

48
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:38,320
Againyou can increase the size with optional shift or in the right toolbar you can increase the X component or the Y component

49
00:02:40,380 --> 00:02:44,250
Then you can choose between the equilateral or the rec

50
00:02:45,870 --> 00:02:47,730
So you see the difference here

51
00:02:47,860 --> 00:02:48,640
You can

52
00:02:48,670 --> 00:02:52,470
you can smooth out the corners for a more round triangle

53
00:02:53,170 --> 00:02:54,520
You can extrude it

54
00:02:55,470 --> 00:02:58,040
bel it for smooth edges

55
00:02:58,070 --> 00:02:59,950
and increase bevel side

56
00:03:01,430 --> 00:03:02,570
Then the fourth object

57
00:03:02,580 --> 00:03:05,170
it's called a Pentagon here

58
00:03:05,190 --> 00:03:06,850
so if you click on the top Toa

59
00:03:07,220 --> 00:03:09,430
place it on plane

60
00:03:09,780 --> 00:03:10,730
and again

61
00:03:10,770 --> 00:03:14,430
increase the size with option and shift in every direction

62
00:03:15,370 --> 00:03:22,640
you can also change the size here in the right to bar in X way axis

63
00:03:23,780 --> 00:03:27,910
You can increase or decrease the sides of the Pentagon

64
00:03:28,190 --> 00:03:29,560
So for instance

65
00:03:29,570 --> 00:03:30,600
if we take a here

66
00:03:30,600 --> 00:03:32,330
you have an octagon

67
00:03:33,070 --> 00:03:35,980
you can also move out the corners again

68
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:37,820
you can extrude it

69
00:03:39,980 --> 00:03:43,620
Bevel lid and increase the bevel sides

70
00:03:45,110 --> 00:03:47,260
The next shape is called the star

71
00:03:47,930 --> 00:03:49,280
So in the tatua

72
00:03:49,290 --> 00:03:52,590
take this star topic here

73
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:55,240
increase it with option and shift the size

74
00:03:57,690 --> 00:04:02,500
Againyou can also increase the size here in the red to in X and Y

75
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:06,770
you can increase or decrease the size of the star

76
00:04:08,100 --> 00:04:15,740
We can move out or move in the inner part of the star

77
00:04:16,290 --> 00:04:18,880
You can adapt an angle

78
00:04:19,020 --> 00:04:22,840
so only a half star or full star or something else

79
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:23,350
And again

80
00:04:23,350 --> 00:04:25,040
you can smooth out the corners

81
00:04:25,060 --> 00:04:27,720
So a more rounded star

82
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:28,930
you can extrude it

83
00:04:28,930 --> 00:04:29,360
of course

84
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:33,370
againand then bevel it also

85
00:04:36,280 --> 00:04:37,530
For much smoother edges

86
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:41,090
So it looks maybe like a gear or something

87
00:04:41,380 --> 00:04:42,160
And again

88
00:04:42,170 --> 00:04:43,850
you can increase the bevel sides

89
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:47,920
So the next shape will be the text element

90
00:04:47,960 --> 00:04:50,590
So the UI is going to be skipped for now

91
00:04:50,590 --> 00:04:52,430
We will talk about this later

92
00:04:52,490 --> 00:04:53,430
So for now

93
00:04:53,430 --> 00:04:55,260
we talk about the text element

94
00:04:55,950 --> 00:04:57,600
place it here on the base plane

95
00:04:57,830 --> 00:04:59,000
And on the right side

96
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:03,450
you can see a tab called content where you can write anything you want

97
00:05:04,060 --> 00:05:05,450
I will explain for now

98
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:08,820
Then you can increase the font size as you want

99
00:05:09,900 --> 00:05:14,160
make sure that the parent element also fits to the font size

100
00:05:15,210 --> 00:05:23,600
so make this element a bit bigger if you want want to have a more bigger font size can also adapt the line heat

101
00:05:23,610 --> 00:05:26,320
Now the spacing between the letters

102
00:05:28,410 --> 00:05:31,150
The font type can also change here

103
00:05:31,540 --> 00:05:34,700
You can also upload an own font if you want

104
00:05:35,270 --> 00:05:39,010
And you can also choose between gold

105
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:41,470
italicor some other styles

106
00:05:42,270 --> 00:05:46,470
You can align the text as you want

107
00:05:47,470 --> 00:05:49,870
both in horizontal and vertical direction

108
00:05:50,530 --> 00:05:55,030
can choose between the case and also again

109
00:05:55,050 --> 00:05:57,540
you can extrude the text

110
00:05:57,900 --> 00:05:58,510
be it

111
00:06:01,260 --> 00:06:02,000
As you want

112
00:06:02,990 --> 00:06:04,720
And also increase the level sides

113
00:06:06,300 --> 00:06:06,880
Then up next

114
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:08,450
we have the path element

115
00:06:08,470 --> 00:06:08,950
So again

116
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:12,660
top tuba and then choose the path tool here

117
00:06:12,890 --> 00:06:17,830
Click on the base plane and then you can begin to draw your path here

118
00:06:18,210 --> 00:06:20,210
So maybe something like this

119
00:06:20,340 --> 00:06:21,400
for example

120
00:06:22,350 --> 00:06:23,010
with escape

121
00:06:23,050 --> 00:06:25,500
you can go out of the path to

122
00:06:26,520 --> 00:06:27,350
And then again

123
00:06:27,350 --> 00:06:28,430
on the right toolbar

124
00:06:28,430 --> 00:06:33,670
we have now some settings that we can go to

125
00:06:34,510 --> 00:06:35,540
For instance

126
00:06:35,860 --> 00:06:42,940
we can change the shape to a polygon or star or something else

127
00:06:43,450 --> 00:06:45,570
We'll keep it as a circle for now

128
00:06:46,120 --> 00:06:49,290
You can increase or decrease the size here in X and Y

129
00:06:49,910 --> 00:06:51,490
you can form a ring

130
00:06:52,040 --> 00:06:54,480
so it's like a tunnel or something

131
00:06:55,470 --> 00:06:57,470
You can adapt the angle

132
00:06:57,560 --> 00:07:02,820
So half a tunnel or full tunnel can change the sides here

133
00:07:02,830 --> 00:07:05,310
Some more edgy or more rounded

134
00:07:05,990 --> 00:07:06,630
Let's go for this

135
00:07:06,630 --> 00:07:10,330
Now you can increase or decrease the depth

136
00:07:11,610 --> 00:07:13,430
can maybe make a transition with it

137
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:19,850
or adapting your model with it can change an offset so it begins later

138
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:23,720
You can change the angle

139
00:07:24,540 --> 00:07:26,950
the twist

140
00:07:29,670 --> 00:07:30,770
And the scale

141
00:07:30,780 --> 00:07:31,560
for instance

142
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:32,800
beginning now

143
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:34,380
is much smaller

144
00:07:34,750 --> 00:07:35,540
And the end

145
00:07:36,130 --> 00:07:36,820
it's more bigger

146
00:07:43,400 --> 00:07:46,020
And then also in the top part here

147
00:07:46,020 --> 00:07:49,500
you can increase the corners so it's more rounded

148
00:07:51,340 --> 00:07:55,500
And also you can increase the subdivision layer so it's more precise

149
00:07:56,580 --> 00:07:57,310
Next up

150
00:07:57,310 --> 00:07:58,730
we have the 3D elements

151
00:07:58,740 --> 00:07:59,310
So again

152
00:07:59,310 --> 00:08:00,670
go to the top toolbar

153
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:02,830
you will find the 3D elements here

154
00:08:02,840 --> 00:08:05,330
So we will talk about cube sphere

155
00:08:05,330 --> 00:08:07,160
cylinder to Celtic cone

156
00:08:07,170 --> 00:08:08,920
pyramidand so on here

157
00:08:09,150 --> 00:08:09,930
So for now

158
00:08:09,930 --> 00:08:11,520
let's take a simple cube

159
00:08:12,460 --> 00:08:14,510
make it bigger with option and shift

160
00:08:15,650 --> 00:08:16,230
And again

161
00:08:16,230 --> 00:08:17,150
on the right side

162
00:08:17,340 --> 00:08:19,940
you can now increase the corners so it's more rounded

163
00:08:20,610 --> 00:08:21,850
If it's zero corners

164
00:08:22,040 --> 00:08:29,770
it's pretty edgy and you can also increase or decrease the corner sides

165
00:08:30,500 --> 00:08:31,160
Next up

00:08:31,170 --> 00:08:34,310

167
00:08:34,720 --> 00:08:36,780
So take the sphere here

168
00:08:37,540 --> 00:08:39,620
increase the size with option and shift

169
00:08:41,130 --> 00:08:47,330
And again here on the right to where you can now adapt the sizes in x

170
00:08:47,330 --> 00:08:48,030
yand that

171
00:08:48,040 --> 00:08:48,640
So of course

172
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:53,270
we're now in the 3D space and we have another that axis now

173
00:08:54,430 --> 00:08:58,660
And here you can also like slice the sphere

174
00:08:59,120 --> 00:08:59,950
So the next shape

175
00:09:00,100 --> 00:09:01,670
it is going to be a cylinder

176
00:09:02,490 --> 00:09:02,960
So in the top

177
00:09:03,340 --> 00:09:04,170
I click on the cylinder

178
00:09:05,560 --> 00:09:08,100
make it a little bit bigger with option and shift

179
00:09:10,810 --> 00:09:11,680
Then on the right

180
00:09:12,530 --> 00:09:13,380
two by again

181
00:09:13,380 --> 00:09:15,940
you can increase or decrease the size in x

182
00:09:15,940 --> 00:09:21,500
yand that direction you can find it

183
00:09:21,510 --> 00:09:23,740
I'm going to bring this up a little bit

184
00:09:24,490 --> 00:09:28,350
You can increase or decrease the size of top and bottom here

185
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:32,330
You can choose between an angle

186
00:09:32,340 --> 00:09:36,600
so maybe half a cylinder or a full cylinder here

187
00:09:36,920 --> 00:09:39,580
You can choose if you want to have a cap or not

188
00:09:40,130 --> 00:09:42,270
You can make it hollow

189
00:09:43,030 --> 00:09:44,210
If you look inside

190
00:09:44,230 --> 00:09:50,220
it's now hollow and you can increase or decrease the corners

191
00:09:50,290 --> 00:09:54,300
So for more edgy cylinder and also again

192
00:09:54,300 --> 00:09:56,580
the sides of the corners

193
00:09:57,750 --> 00:09:59,970
the next up we have the Taurus

194
00:10:00,070 --> 00:10:05,180
so click on the top 2 of our Taurus place on the base plane

195
00:10:07,030 --> 00:10:08,540
And again on the right side

196
00:10:08,540 --> 00:10:10,690
you can increase or decrease the size

197
00:10:12,080 --> 00:10:12,660
can increase

198
00:10:13,100 --> 00:10:14,430
decrease the tube size

199
00:10:14,440 --> 00:10:17,810
Be careful with it because it can be quite overloading

200
00:10:19,480 --> 00:10:23,590
So then you can make it more edgy or more rounded

201
00:10:25,630 --> 00:10:29,310
You can also adapt the radio sides here

202
00:10:30,250 --> 00:10:33,240
You can slice it in any degree you want

203
00:10:33,870 --> 00:10:36,160
So you can like a progress bar or something

204
00:10:36,790 --> 00:10:37,760
And you can also

205
00:10:37,870 --> 00:10:38,580
if you slice it

206
00:10:39,310 --> 00:10:44,930
can also increase the corners here for more rounded edge and again

207
00:10:45,300 --> 00:10:49,310
increase also the corner sides here for more precise

208
00:10:50,540 --> 00:10:52,870
Then next up we have the hex

209
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:54,320
So top 2 by again

210
00:10:54,660 --> 00:10:56,730
choose a hex shape

211
00:10:57,260 --> 00:10:58,730
place it on the base plane

212
00:11:01,380 --> 00:11:01,960
Then again

213
00:11:01,960 --> 00:11:03,400
we can adapt

214
00:11:05,860 --> 00:11:07,380
Xy in that direction

215
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:10,470
You know

216
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:12,830
can make it twisting as you want

217
00:11:13,840 --> 00:11:14,240
I believe

218
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:15,190
so I can see it better

219
00:11:17,130 --> 00:11:19,400
So I can see what the revolution does

220
00:11:20,460 --> 00:11:23,490
You can make it more edgy or more rounded

221
00:11:23,620 --> 00:11:27,060
Againwith the sides hold here

222
00:11:27,070 --> 00:11:30,600
you can increase or decrease the radius of the path

223
00:11:33,950 --> 00:11:38,650
You can also adapt it to this more edgy or more rounded part here

224
00:11:38,650 --> 00:11:42,330
The radius can increase or decrease the corners

225
00:11:45,530 --> 00:11:46,140
And again

226
00:11:46,140 --> 00:11:47,320
also the corner sides

227
00:11:48,380 --> 00:11:49,330
better precision

228
00:11:49,730 --> 00:11:50,600
And for instance

229
00:11:50,600 --> 00:11:54,180
you can model like a suspension of a car or something with it

230
00:11:54,500 --> 00:11:56,160
So it can also be quite helpful

231
00:11:56,160 --> 00:11:56,820
Or spring

232
00:11:56,820 --> 00:11:57,790
for instance

233
00:12:00,440 --> 00:12:01,600
Then next up

234
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:03,570
we have the cone

235
00:12:07,400 --> 00:12:08,730
So place it on the base plane

236
00:12:08,730 --> 00:12:09,960
make it a little bit bigger

237
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:14,090
Bring this up real quick

238
00:12:15,110 --> 00:12:15,820
Now again

239
00:12:15,830 --> 00:12:17,410
you can adapt the x

240
00:12:17,410 --> 00:12:19,290
yand that coordinate here

241
00:12:21,890 --> 00:12:23,810
Change the sides here

242
00:12:24,010 --> 00:12:27,040
So like more edgy or more rounded

243
00:12:27,340 --> 00:12:32,360
both in y and x direction can change the angle

244
00:12:35,080 --> 00:12:36,100
The corners

245
00:12:37,650 --> 00:12:38,520
So for instance

246
00:12:38,520 --> 00:12:41,100
you can make a water drop or something with it

247
00:12:42,180 --> 00:12:42,760
and again

248
00:12:42,770 --> 00:12:45,820
also increase the conoys for a better precision lay

249
00:12:49,800 --> 00:12:53,420
Then next up we have the pyramid

250
00:12:56,660 --> 00:12:59,660
Make it a little bit bigger now with option Itchy

251
00:13:02,300 --> 00:13:03,400
This up here

252
00:13:04,220 --> 00:13:05,080
And again

253
00:13:05,890 --> 00:13:07,880
increase or decrease the size

254
00:13:10,960 --> 00:13:13,060
Bring up more sides to it

255
00:13:15,610 --> 00:13:17,160
Both in x and y direction

256
00:13:20,250 --> 00:13:21,800
And also smooth it out

257
00:13:22,350 --> 00:13:23,980
Move it out if you want to

258
00:13:25,580 --> 00:13:26,350
Then next up

259
00:13:26,370 --> 00:13:28,460
we have the icoh hadron

260
00:13:29,260 --> 00:13:30,880
So let's take this one for now

261
00:13:32,220 --> 00:13:33,550
place it on the base plane

262
00:13:34,100 --> 00:13:36,050
make it bigger with option and shift

263
00:13:37,420 --> 00:13:39,596
move it up real quick

264
00:13:39,596 --> 00:13:40,467
and again

265
00:13:40,467 --> 00:13:45,640
change the size of it and all in both X and Y

266
00:13:45,640 --> 00:13:54,810
and that direction can give it more detail or less detail can smooth out the corners and the corner sides again

267
00:13:55,410 --> 00:13:59,720
Then next up we have the O deah hadron

268
00:14:00,770 --> 00:14:01,310
So again

269
00:14:01,310 --> 00:14:05,480
place it on the base plane and same as before

270
00:14:05,560 --> 00:14:06,290
make it bigger

271
00:14:06,930 --> 00:14:10,000
move it up and like same properties

272
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,620
Now here you can change the details

273
00:14:13,260 --> 00:14:15,760
you can make it more softly

274
00:14:17,910 --> 00:14:24,190
Can increase the corner sides or change the properties in x

275
00:14:24,190 --> 00:14:25,730
yand z direction

276
00:14:27,310 --> 00:14:29,540
So next up we have the Taurus mod

277
00:14:29,940 --> 00:14:32,150
So choose the Taurus mod here

278
00:14:32,660 --> 00:14:34,160
place it on the base plane

279
00:14:35,250 --> 00:14:39,920
move it up a little bit and make it bigger with option and shift

280
00:14:41,390 --> 00:14:42,440
So like that

281
00:14:43,210 --> 00:14:43,960
And then again

282
00:14:43,960 --> 00:14:44,650
on the right side

283
00:14:44,710 --> 00:14:50,230
you can also adapt here the Y and that axis properties

284
00:14:51,560 --> 00:14:54,700
You can increase or decrease the path radius here

285
00:14:55,520 --> 00:14:57,320
the puff slides

286
00:14:57,390 --> 00:15:05,690
so more edgy or more rounded can also adapt the radial sides for more eddy or more rounded

287
00:15:06,650 --> 00:15:09,400
And you can also change the fact to P and Q here

288
00:15:12,060 --> 00:15:14,460
So maybe like this

289
00:15:15,050 --> 00:15:15,360
like that

290
00:15:15,460 --> 00:15:18,180
So it's more twisted inside here

291
00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:23,380
And last but not least

292
00:15:23,380 --> 00:15:27,280
we have a lathe that it's also quite helpful to know about

293
00:15:28,120 --> 00:15:29,340
And here on the right side

294
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:31,350
you can also adapt x

295
00:15:31,460 --> 00:15:35,460
yand the z axis to anything you want

296
00:15:36,430 --> 00:15:40,580
You can decrease or decrease the x and y sides

297
00:15:42,230 --> 00:15:42,950
And for this

298
00:15:42,950 --> 00:15:45,530
you can drag around

299
00:15:45,790 --> 00:15:48,950
you see what it does

300
00:15:49,030 --> 00:15:51,160
So you can also make a drop or something

301
00:15:51,170 --> 00:15:54,510
or maybe like you know it from a rocket

302
00:15:54,920 --> 00:15:57,380
the fire that comes out of the rocket

303
00:15:57,640 --> 00:15:59,830
you can model something like this

304
00:16:00,360 --> 00:16:00,810
And yeah

305
00:16:00,810 --> 00:16:04,120
also the lathe can be quite helpful to use
