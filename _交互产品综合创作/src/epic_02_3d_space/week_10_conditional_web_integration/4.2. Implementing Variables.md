1
00:00:01,370 --> 00:00:03,840
So let's talk about variables

2
00:00:03,840 --> 00:00:07,700
So variables are a nice way to give you a 3D scene

3
00:00:07,700 --> 00:00:09,420
some dynamic behavior

4
00:00:10,110 --> 00:00:11,360
And to do so

5
00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:12,810
we will now again

6
00:00:13,110 --> 00:00:20,450
build some shapes around the functionality so you guys see it already in action how variables work

7
00:00:20,930 --> 00:00:21,610
And for this

8
00:00:21,610 --> 00:00:22,360
we are now

9
00:00:22,360 --> 00:00:25,540
againin our basic default spline scene here

10
00:00:26,710 --> 00:00:33,140
And I will create now a rectangle just on our base plane here

11
00:00:33,400 --> 00:00:36,160
which will be used as a button

12
00:00:36,440 --> 00:00:40,430
So maybe just a little one here in the left down corner

13
00:00:42,450 --> 00:00:44,560
And I will give it a white color

14
00:00:44,720 --> 00:00:46,880
for example

15
00:00:46,890 --> 00:00:55,470
so we have some more contrast and also maybe a little bit rounded for the aesthetic

16
00:00:57,810 --> 00:00:59,940
Maybe also some bevel here

17
00:01:01,130 --> 00:01:04,310
And let's also change the background here

18
00:01:05,930 --> 00:01:07,960
Looks a little bit more nice and clean

19
00:01:08,410 --> 00:01:13,700
And also we can change the color of the background here a little bit

20
00:01:14,200 --> 00:01:15,700
Someokay

21
00:01:15,710 --> 00:01:18,730
maybe also some smoother edges here

22
00:01:20,260 --> 00:01:20,890
Okay

23
00:01:21,650 --> 00:01:24,760
so now we'll make a little button here

24
00:01:24,770 --> 00:01:25,760
let's move it here

25
00:01:26,160 --> 00:01:26,710
bit here

26
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:34,250
And this button actually should do the functionality of increasing a variable

27
00:01:34,500 --> 00:01:38,460
So I will also give it a little icon here

28
00:01:38,460 --> 00:01:43,190
So it looks like a plus icon here

29
00:01:45,660 --> 00:01:46,580
Like that

30
00:01:51,390 --> 00:01:52,200
Yeahthat looks good

31
00:01:52,930 --> 00:01:55,160
Then duplicate it with C and D

32
00:01:55,170 --> 00:01:59,800
and then you can rotate it to -90 degrees

33
00:02:00,810 --> 00:02:03,120
And now we have a little plus icon here

34
00:02:03,900 --> 00:02:08,240
And maybe I will move this a little bit in the center now

35
00:02:10,520 --> 00:02:11,780
So maybe like this

36
00:02:11,790 --> 00:02:15,840
you can also make it a little bit smaller by holding option and shift

37
00:02:15,850 --> 00:02:19,210
And then you can size it down evenly

38
00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:19,970
Okay

39
00:02:19,970 --> 00:02:21,380
now we have a button here

40
00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:27,450
And for better visibility here and better understanding

41
00:02:28,270 --> 00:02:32,430
quickly change the name here of the rectangles

42
00:02:32,440 --> 00:02:35,260
But first we can group this up

43
00:02:37,520 --> 00:02:44,560
And so just select the three rectangles here and then hit command and G so you can group them up

44
00:02:45,180 --> 00:02:49,890
And then you can rename it to button maybe

45
00:02:52,820 --> 00:02:53,700
Okay

46
00:02:53,990 --> 00:02:55,600
so that's it for now

47
00:02:56,320 --> 00:02:58,370
And now we need another shape

48
00:02:58,820 --> 00:03:00,310
So maybe

49
00:03:01,820 --> 00:03:04,800
yeahwe can just also do a rectangle here

50
00:03:06,910 --> 00:03:11,430
Or maybe we can also actually just duplicate the button here

51
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:12,800
So hit command and D

52
00:03:12,870 --> 00:03:13,840
now we have a second button

53
00:03:15,940 --> 00:03:16,940
Move it up a little bit

54
00:03:17,070 --> 00:03:27,660
And then you can just delete the plus icon here and also rename it to maybe just

55
00:03:27,660 --> 00:03:30,530
yeahyou can just call it rectangle again

56
00:03:32,540 --> 00:03:33,140
Okay

57
00:03:34,040 --> 00:03:38,060
so now we have a little nice play here with a button and rectangle

58
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:44,820
And what we want to achieve now is actually by triggering this plus icon

59
00:03:44,830 --> 00:03:50,720
the variable or the extrusion actually changes from the second rectangle here

60
00:03:51,320 --> 00:03:52,530
So to do so

61
00:03:52,530 --> 00:03:55,780
we will activate or select here the rectangle

62
00:03:55,780 --> 00:03:57,180
or maybe I will give it another name

63
00:03:57,180 --> 00:03:58,340
Because rectangle

64
00:03:58,990 --> 00:04:01,160
it's a little bit too simple

65
00:04:04,320 --> 00:04:07,480
So maybe like diagram

66
00:04:11,490 --> 00:04:15,740
Okayand then if we select this one here

67
00:04:15,740 --> 00:04:19,610
so the shape under the diagram here

68
00:04:19,620 --> 00:04:24,270
we can actually change the extrusion here of this element

69
00:04:25,860 --> 00:04:29,180
but we can actually also connect it to a variable

70
00:04:29,330 --> 00:04:31,660
So if you have on the elements here

71
00:04:31,660 --> 00:04:35,770
you always see a little plus icon here on the top right corner

72
00:04:36,810 --> 00:04:38,470
And if we click on it

73
00:04:38,480 --> 00:04:42,830
we can actually search for a variable or we can also select one

74
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:45,790
So if you enter the four dots here

75
00:04:46,230 --> 00:04:50,720
you actually come into this little selecting tool here

76
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:55,400
And for our application

77
00:04:55,400 --> 00:04:57,510
we will just simply choose a number

78
00:04:57,670 --> 00:05:03,270
but we also have the opportunity to choose a Boolean or a string

79
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:07,160
You can also select dynamic variables like a time or a counter

80
00:05:07,880 --> 00:05:10,690
and also some random variables

81
00:05:10,780 --> 00:05:11,780
But for now

82
00:05:11,780 --> 00:05:14,100
we will just choose the number here

83
00:05:15,330 --> 00:05:19,220
And this is then actually just our base state number

84
00:05:19,420 --> 00:05:23,300
So we can actually maybe just choose 10 here

85
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:29,280
And now we've created a variable called number with a value of 10

86
00:05:30,520 --> 00:05:31,230
And then again

87
00:05:31,230 --> 00:05:35,330
we can actually choose this variable here in our extrusion

88
00:05:35,410 --> 00:05:37,600
So if you just click here on the plus icon

89
00:05:38,150 --> 00:05:43,120
you now see that a new variable was created called number with the value 10 here

90
00:05:43,170 --> 00:05:45,220
Soand if I click on it now

91
00:05:45,220 --> 00:05:51,780
you see actually that the extrusion value also changes to the number 10

92
00:05:53,540 --> 00:05:55,260
And for example

93
00:05:55,260 --> 00:05:58,990
now if I actually change this variable number

94
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:04,670
now see that it's connected to this little diagram here

95
00:06:05,220 --> 00:06:07,030
So by changing the variable

96
00:06:07,050 --> 00:06:09,510
you're also changing the extrusion number

97
00:06:10,480 --> 00:06:13,730
But we will keep it now at the number of 10

98
00:06:16,030 --> 00:06:21,720
And then what we can actually do is we can now trigger an event by the button

99
00:06:21,790 --> 00:06:24,600
So just click here on the group button again

100
00:06:24,980 --> 00:06:27,440
And then we will create a new event

101
00:06:27,900 --> 00:06:28,940
So by default

102
00:06:29,350 --> 00:06:30,430
it's a start event

103
00:06:30,430 --> 00:06:35,180
but we actually want to do it by click of button

104
00:06:35,310 --> 00:06:38,360
So we can use the mouse down feature here

105
00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:41,100
So click on the mouse down feature

106
00:06:41,100 --> 00:06:43,590
And to trigger it just simply on this object

107
00:06:43,590 --> 00:06:45,450
so just on the button here

108
00:06:46,700 --> 00:06:48,860
And then now you see again

109
00:06:48,860 --> 00:06:49,950
the actions list here

110
00:06:49,960 --> 00:06:54,860
And we will now select here the set variable function

111
00:06:56,370 --> 00:06:57,820
So now it's selected here

112
00:06:57,900 --> 00:06:59,160
the set variable function

113
00:06:59,790 --> 00:07:01,270
And if you click on it

114
00:07:01,270 --> 00:07:03,240
now you can select a variable

115
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:03,910
So

116
00:07:03,910 --> 00:07:06,390
and if you have done everything right now

117
00:07:06,390 --> 00:07:09,200
you should see your variable created here

118
00:07:10,040 --> 00:07:12,680
variable number with the value 10

119
00:07:13,930 --> 00:07:17,080
And then you can also add an expression to it

120
00:07:17,720 --> 00:07:18,780
And if you click on it

121
00:07:18,780 --> 00:07:25,850
now you have some opportunities to choose from and we can actually

122
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:31,260
Use some different properties here

123
00:07:31,660 --> 00:07:32,530
So for instance

124
00:07:32,530 --> 00:07:34,530
you can take the mouse position

125
00:07:34,530 --> 00:07:36,790
You can make also a random value here

126
00:07:36,790 --> 00:07:37,450
You can add

127
00:07:37,450 --> 00:07:38,880
subtractmultiply

128
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:40,360
divide some values

129
00:07:40,770 --> 00:07:42,630
But what we are going to do now

130
00:07:42,630 --> 00:07:45,860
we just simply take our variable here now

131
00:07:45,870 --> 00:07:47,680
so the number variable

132
00:07:48,760 --> 00:07:50,500
and as you might notice

133
00:07:50,500 --> 00:07:52,000
this value is 10

134
00:07:52,390 --> 00:07:55,190
But now if we actually click on the button

135
00:07:55,190 --> 00:07:57,250
now you can increase this value

136
00:07:57,260 --> 00:08:01,450
So you can just type in plus 10 here maybe

137
00:08:02,360 --> 00:08:05,110
or you can also use this add add function here

138
00:08:05,110 --> 00:08:06,010
So if you click on it

139
00:08:06,020 --> 00:08:09,540
it just simply put the plus sign here

140
00:08:10,640 --> 00:08:14,040
and then we're actually actually changing the variable here

141
00:08:14,050 --> 00:08:17,300
so the number number value to by

142
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:23,350
So we're changing the number value by adding a value of 10 to the existing variable

143
00:08:24,580 --> 00:08:29,410
And now if you simulate this whole scene now and click on the button

144
00:08:30,870 --> 00:08:36,230
you now see that the variable is changing by clicking on this button now

145
00:08:37,840 --> 00:08:41,970
So this is actually what a simple variable does

146
00:08:41,980 --> 00:08:44,390
so you can create an action by it

147
00:08:44,390 --> 00:08:48,720
You can increase the value or just do some crazy stuff with it

148
00:08:48,960 --> 00:08:51,380
So this is just an easy example now

149
00:08:52,850 --> 00:08:53,940
But yeah

150
00:08:53,940 --> 00:08:54,730
you can

151
00:08:55,010 --> 00:08:55,880
for example

152
00:08:55,880 --> 00:09:00,460
also put a minus sign out here

153
00:09:00,460 --> 00:09:03,470
so you can also decrease the value of the diagram

154
00:09:03,750 --> 00:09:05,830
so you can increase or decrease it

155
00:09:06,850 --> 00:09:10,590
maybe also half the value here by some click of a button

156
00:09:11,560 --> 00:09:15,480
So you are really free in your creativity here now

157
00:09:17,180 --> 00:09:17,660
So

158
00:09:17,730 --> 00:09:18,540
but yeah

159
00:09:18,540 --> 00:09:23,100
I also have some other possibilities here with variables

160
00:09:23,390 --> 00:09:27,770
So here we just show some static values here

161
00:09:28,190 --> 00:09:31,750
but you also have to choose from dynamic values

162
00:09:32,820 --> 00:09:33,470
For example

163
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:37,230
we can make a little ellipse here

164
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:43,560
Yeahand then we can also change the color here again

165
00:09:44,970 --> 00:09:49,620
And then give it a little resize where holding option and shift

166
00:09:50,060 --> 00:09:50,620
So again

167
00:09:50,620 --> 00:09:53,580
you can size it evenly

168
00:09:56,350 --> 00:10:01,950
And then we can maybe make a little ring here

169
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:05,480
Yeahthat's good

170
00:10:07,050 --> 00:10:08,050
And now we

171
00:10:08,270 --> 00:10:14,200
what I'm trying to do now is we can connect this angle value here to a dynamic value

172
00:10:14,500 --> 00:10:17,380
So it's like a stopwatch here

173
00:10:18,120 --> 00:10:19,610
So if you click on a button

174
00:10:19,730 --> 00:10:24,750
now the angle is now changing to the dynamic variable

175
00:10:24,750 --> 00:10:30,010
So you can achieve that by clicking here on the angle

176
00:10:30,020 --> 00:10:34,100
And now we will create a new dynamic variable here

177
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:35,120
So again

178
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:36,470
on the four dots

179
00:10:38,140 --> 00:10:40,620
and then hit the plus icon here

180
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:44,860
And then you have to choose between the dynamic variables here

181
00:10:45,190 --> 00:10:49,190
and then we choose the counter variable here

182
00:10:50,220 --> 00:10:51,070
So by default

183
00:10:51,080 --> 00:10:52,300
it's 0

184
00:10:52,460 --> 00:10:53,410
So if you

185
00:10:54,450 --> 00:10:57,080
ohlet me just quickly reload the scene here

186
00:10:57,080 --> 00:10:57,910
I don't know where

187
00:10:57,910 --> 00:10:59,820
it's okay

188
00:10:59,820 --> 00:11:00,810
now we're back

189
00:11:03,520 --> 00:11:04,020
So

190
00:11:04,020 --> 00:11:09,010
and then if you click on the angle here now and clicking on the dynamic value of the counter

191
00:11:09,620 --> 00:11:14,170
you now see that it's disappearing because the angle is now set to 0

192
00:11:16,450 --> 00:11:20,850
And we can actually trigger this angle event

193
00:11:21,070 --> 00:11:25,740
but just we can just simply create another button here

194
00:11:28,090 --> 00:11:30,700
So we can duplicate it with command in D

195
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:39,420
and I will rename it quickly to maybe like Counter Start

196
00:11:41,820 --> 00:11:44,150
And then we also duplicate it here

197
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:45,300
the mouse down event

198
00:11:45,300 --> 00:11:48,390
So we can actually just delete it for now

199
00:11:48,550 --> 00:12:06,370
So we have this button here for the increasing variable event and this one here for the counter start event can also maybe delete this plus icon here and put the text on here

200
00:12:06,370 --> 00:12:09,210
which says play

201
00:12:10,820 --> 00:12:11,750
Yeahthat looks good

202
00:12:13,300 --> 00:12:19,560
Make it a little bit smaller here and move it here onto the button

203
00:12:21,980 --> 00:12:23,970
Decreasing the font size here a little bit

204
00:12:29,880 --> 00:12:30,240
Okay

205
00:12:30,520 --> 00:12:33,520
now we have a plus button and a play button here

206
00:12:35,430 --> 00:12:41,010
and we select the counter to start button again and enter a new event

207
00:12:42,380 --> 00:12:44,280
And for this event

208
00:12:44,680 --> 00:12:47,600
we will also choose a mousedown event

209
00:12:48,190 --> 00:12:50,820
but not now the set variable mode

210
00:12:51,130 --> 00:12:53,490
but the variable control mode

211
00:12:54,150 --> 00:12:57,310
So if you go into the variable control mode

212
00:12:57,310 --> 00:13:00,390
you now see that you can select a dynamic variable

213
00:13:01,110 --> 00:13:01,920
And to do so

214
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:04,550
we now see our dynamic counter variable

215
00:13:04,640 --> 00:13:07,780
which is set to 0 by initial state

216
00:13:09,110 --> 00:13:12,140
And then we can choose an interaction mode

217
00:13:12,140 --> 00:13:13,390
So for now

218
00:13:13,390 --> 00:13:19,160
we will just hit the play interaction and we don't want a delay

219
00:13:19,160 --> 00:13:21,030
so it just starts instantly

220
00:13:23,030 --> 00:13:26,190
And that's it for now

221
00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:32,280
And now if you head back over to your ellipse

222
00:13:32,280 --> 00:13:37,890
now you see you already have connected the dynamic value

223
00:13:37,890 --> 00:13:39,680
But if you play it now

224
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:40,860
nothing happens

225
00:13:42,270 --> 00:13:47,940
So we will step back into our dynamic variable setting here

226
00:13:47,950 --> 00:13:52,780
And then you actually see some little settings icon here

227
00:13:52,930 --> 00:13:54,180
So if you click on it

228
00:13:54,180 --> 00:13:56,760
now you see the initial value

229
00:13:56,770 --> 00:14:00,310
You see an interval step and an end value

230
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:03,280
And you can also do an on end event

231
00:14:03,280 --> 00:14:06,100
So you can actually restart it or just stop it

232
00:14:07,060 --> 00:14:07,510
For now

233
00:14:07,510 --> 00:14:08,580
I will only want

234
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:11,080
I only want that it plays once

235
00:14:12,530 --> 00:14:14,650
And then for the steps

236
00:14:15,140 --> 00:14:17,880
we can maybe choose 10

237
00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:24,440
And the n value is we need an n value

238
00:14:24,900 --> 00:14:28,890
And if you imagine we have an angle of 360 degrees

239
00:14:28,900 --> 00:14:30,880
So that is a full circle

240
00:14:31,270 --> 00:14:34,250
And that should also be our end value

241
00:14:34,250 --> 00:14:37,940
So it doesn't exceed 360 degrees

242
00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:40,880
And yeah

243
00:14:40,900 --> 00:14:42,100
that should be good to go

244
00:14:42,100 --> 00:14:43,730
And the interval is set to one

245
00:14:43,730 --> 00:14:45,440
so every one second

246
00:14:48,520 --> 00:14:48,900
Okay

247
00:14:48,900 --> 00:14:51,160
I will bring this maybe a little bit down here

248
00:14:55,300 --> 00:14:59,290
Okaynow let me check the Mo down event quickly

249
00:14:59,290 --> 00:14:59,940
yeahOkay

250
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:02,430
so now if you

251
00:15:02,640 --> 00:15:03,560
if we simu​‌​‌​​‌‌​​‌‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌​‌‌‌​​‌‌​​‌‌​​‌‌​‌​‌​​‌‌​​‌‌​​‌‌​‌‌‌​​‌‌‌​​‌​​‌‌​‌​‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌​‌‌​​​‌‌‌‌‌‌​​‌‌​‌‌‌​​‌‌​‌​‌​​‌‌‌​‌‌​​‌‌​​​‌​​‌‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌‌​​‌​​‌‌‌‌‌‌​​‌‌​​​‌​​‌‌​‌‌‌​​‌‌​‌​‌​​‌‌​‌​‌​​‌‌‌​​‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌​​​‌‌‌​‌‌​​‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌​​‌‌‌​‌‌​​‌‌​‌‌​​​‌‌​​‌‌​​‌‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌​‌​‌‌‌​‌​‌‌‌‌‌​‌‌​​‌​​‌‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌​‌​‌‌‌​‌​‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌‌​​‌‌‌​‌​‌‌‌​​‌‌​‌‌​​​‌‌​‌‌​​​‌‌‌‌‌​​​‌‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌​​​‌​​‌‌​​‌‌​​‌‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌​‌‌‌​​‌‌‌‌‌​​​‌‌​‌‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌​‌‌​​‌‌​‌​‌‌‌​‌​‌​‌​​‌‌​‌​‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌​‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌​‌‌​​​‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌‌​‌‌​​‌‌​‌​‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌​​‌‌​‌‌‌‌‌​‌​‌​‌​​‌‌​‌​‌​​‌‌​‌​‌‌‌​‌‌​​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌‌​​‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌​​‌‌‌​​‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌​‌‌​​​‌‌‌​​‌‌‌​‌​‌‌‌‌‌​‌​‌‌​​​‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌​‌‌​​‌‌​‌​‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌​‌‌​​‌‌​​‌‌​​‌‌​‌​‌​​‌‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌​‌​‌‌‌​‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌​‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌​​​‌‌‌​​‌​​‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌​‌‌‌​​‌‌​‌‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌​​​‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌​​‌​​‌‌​‌​‌‌‌​‌​‌‌‌​​‌‌​‌‌​​​‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌​‌‌‌​​‌‌‌‌‌​​​‌‌​‌​‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌‌​​‌‌‌​‌​‌‌‌‌‌​‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌‌​​‌‌‌‌‌‌​​‌‌​‌‌‌​​‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌‌​​‌​​‌‌​​‌‌​​‌‌‌​​‌​​‌‌‌​​‌​​‌‌​‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌late again

252
00:15:03,560 --> 00:15:12,240
now we see that actually the progress bars never actually getting added up by a value of 10 every second

253
00:15:12,760 --> 00:15:13,890
And for example

254
00:15:13,890 --> 00:15:17,510
you can also make this even faster

255
00:15:17,510 --> 00:15:26,160
So if you head back over to the ellipse now and go back to the counter event here

256
00:15:26,170 --> 00:15:28,690
you can actually play around with the settings

257
00:15:28,690 --> 00:15:28,750
Here

258
00:15:28,930 --> 00:15:34,940
You can make it like an interval of 0．1 seconds

259
00:15:35,140 --> 00:15:37,690
So if you simulate now again and hit the play button

260
00:15:38,600 --> 00:15:40,790
you now see that it's much faster now

261
00:15:43,630 --> 00:15:44,760
And yeah

262
00:15:44,760 --> 00:15:46,160
what I forgot to mention

263
00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:50,640
you also have to drag the text element again in the counter start button

264
00:15:51,870 --> 00:15:53,980
Otherwiseif you click now the text

265
00:15:54,080 --> 00:15:56,120
the event would not start

266
00:15:56,200 --> 00:15:58,190
Alsobe careful with this one

267
00:15:58,190 --> 00:15:59,270
So you also

268
00:15:59,410 --> 00:16:01,570
if you add new things to one element

269
00:16:01,670 --> 00:16:05,170
you also have to put them inside of the group here

270
00:16:05,560 --> 00:16:13,280
So what we can also do is we can actually trigger some events based on the state of a variable

271
00:16:13,280 --> 00:16:18,570
So if you imagine how we play this animation now

272
00:16:18,580 --> 00:16:21,120
and this is

273
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:21,820
for example

274
00:16:21,820 --> 00:16:22,640
the stopwatch

275
00:16:22,650 --> 00:16:25,200
And this stopwatch now comes to an end

276
00:16:25,200 --> 00:16:30,740
so it receive going to the 360 degrees

277
00:16:31,970 --> 00:16:37,110
we can maybe like change the color of it for now

278
00:16:37,110 --> 00:16:38,810
It's like in a white

279
00:16:39,010 --> 00:16:40,810
but if it's a full circle

280
00:16:40,810 --> 00:16:42,260
now we can make it red

281
00:16:42,260 --> 00:16:42,820
for example

282
00:16:43,650 --> 00:16:44,990
And to do so

283
00:16:44,990 --> 00:16:49,580
we will introduce now conditional statements for variables

284
00:16:49,880 --> 00:16:53,600
So we can just select the ellipse now here

285
00:16:54,610 --> 00:16:57,760
and we have to create a new state event

286
00:16:58,290 --> 00:17:01,490
so we have the base state and the second state now again

287
00:17:02,080 --> 00:17:03,500
and on the second state

288
00:17:03,550 --> 00:17:09,210
now we want that the ellipse is getting red or the ring is getting red

289
00:17:10,420 --> 00:17:14,070
and then we have to apply an event for now

290
00:17:15,850 --> 00:17:17,190
And to do this

291
00:17:17,190 --> 00:17:18,500
we can actually

292
00:17:19,020 --> 00:17:22,670
we want to trigger this event when the variable is changing

293
00:17:23,530 --> 00:17:24,150
For now

294
00:17:24,150 --> 00:17:26,480
every second the variable is changing

295
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:29,330
and then we want to trigger this

296
00:17:30,740 --> 00:17:31,470
this event

297
00:17:31,470 --> 00:17:35,730
So we will actually use the variable change event now

298
00:17:36,290 --> 00:17:40,200
And then we will select our counter variable

299
00:17:42,620 --> 00:17:44,480
And then we will actually

300
00:17:45,020 --> 00:17:45,420
as I said

301
00:17:45,420 --> 00:17:48,540
we will introduce now the conditional statements here

302
00:17:48,660 --> 00:17:49,860
So it's like

303
00:17:49,860 --> 00:17:52,340
if you are familiar a little bit with programming

304
00:17:52,350 --> 00:17:54,970
you have the if and else statements

305
00:17:55,510 --> 00:17:56,720
So for example

306
00:17:56,840 --> 00:18:00,120
now we can select our variable here

307
00:18:00,120 --> 00:18:01,250
so the counter variable

308
00:18:02,690 --> 00:18:08,920
and then say if this counter variable is actually greater

309
00:18:09,670 --> 00:18:19,040
So you can choose this one here is greater than like 359 here

310
00:18:19,040 --> 00:18:22,290
So if it's bigger than this value

311
00:18:22,550 --> 00:18:24,820
some action will trigger

312
00:18:25,050 --> 00:18:25,770
And for this

313
00:18:25,770 --> 00:18:27,830
we will choose the transition again

314
00:18:29,670 --> 00:18:30,820
And then again

315
00:18:30,820 --> 00:18:32,480
the target is still the ellipse now

316
00:18:33,380 --> 00:18:37,930
and then we will change from the base state to the second state now

317
00:18:37,940 --> 00:18:40,260
And we will do this immediately

318
00:18:40,260 --> 00:18:42,240
so with no delay or ease

319
00:18:43,880 --> 00:18:47,010
And so what this simply does now is actually it

320
00:18:47,080 --> 00:18:50,670
it's getting triggered every time the variable is changing

321
00:18:50,850 --> 00:18:51,710
And if you remember

322
00:18:51,710 --> 00:18:59,880
this counter just increases and increases every second or every millisecond or whatever value you choose there

323
00:19:00,150 --> 00:19:08,260
And then actually it's getting asked if the counter is actually greater than 359

324
00:19:09,230 --> 00:19:10,010
And if so

325
00:19:10,010 --> 00:19:13,210
we actually trigger this transition from the ellipse

326
00:19:13,260 --> 00:19:17,580
So it's getting from the white state to the red state

327
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:21,830
Then if you simulate now again and hit the play button

328
00:19:23,550 --> 00:19:30,840
you should actually see that the color is changing where the variable is now over 359

329
00:19:31,350 --> 00:19:32,720
And under the value

330
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:34,970
it's still white

331
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:38,860
Yeah

332
00:19:38,870 --> 00:19:46,200
and this functionality we're actually going to implement now in a much more realistic project now

333
00:19:46,200 --> 00:19:53,300
So with some more nice looking materials and also some nice looking shapes

334
00:19:53,550 --> 00:19:56,080
So if you are interested in this project

335
00:19:56,080 --> 00:19:57,290
you can keep watching

336
00:19:57,290 --> 00:20:03,840
So we will just we use everything we learn now in this course for now

337
00:20:04,470 --> 00:20:07,400
So you will learn how to apply the state

338
00:20:07,400 --> 00:20:08,650
the conditional logic

339
00:20:08,650 --> 00:20:09,510
the variables

340
00:20:09,510 --> 00:20:10,420
and so on
