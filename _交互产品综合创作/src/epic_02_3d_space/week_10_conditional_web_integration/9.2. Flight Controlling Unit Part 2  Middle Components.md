1
00:00:00,880 --> 00:00:06,090
So now we can actually continue with all the parts here down below

2
00:00:06,120 --> 00:00:09,260
So maybe we'll just start in the middle here now

3
00:00:09,920 --> 00:00:12,090
And for now

4
00:00:12,100 --> 00:00:15,680
I will actually create these light stripes here

5
00:00:15,700 --> 00:00:17,010
the orange ones

6
00:00:17,710 --> 00:00:18,740
And to do so

7
00:00:18,740 --> 00:00:19,600
we can again

8
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:25,570
just simply create it from some rectangles here and here

9
00:00:25,570 --> 00:00:27,200
For the x component

10
00:00:27,200 --> 00:00:30,910
we can use maybe a value of 0．5

11
00:00:32,220 --> 00:00:33,660
This could fit

12
00:00:33,850 --> 00:00:34,640
Yeahmaybe

13
00:00:35,340 --> 00:00:40,290
And for the height or the y component

14
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:51,640
we can actually use the value of maybe like 34 and then move it a little bit down here

15
00:00:51,720 --> 00:00:59,240
So it actually is on the left side of the Hdg lettering

16
00:01:00,830 --> 00:01:02,720
so maybe like here

17
00:01:08,660 --> 00:01:10,020
Or is it here

18
00:01:10,750 --> 00:01:15,290
And then also apply the orange material here to this one

19
00:01:18,250 --> 00:01:20,330
So let me just check the positioning

20
00:01:24,380 --> 00:01:27,130
Yeahnot really

21
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:30,580
Maybe we actually have to also

22
00:01:33,160 --> 00:01:36,070
Make this one a little bit smaller here

23
00:01:39,100 --> 00:01:40,010
I like that

24
00:01:41,120 --> 00:01:42,350
and then bring this up

25
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:47,890
Yeahlike that

26
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:50,300
So I'm looking actually at the bottom corner

27
00:01:50,300 --> 00:01:50,800
you know

28
00:01:51,510 --> 00:01:59,090
And here I will actually move the display maybe a little bit more down here

29
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:06,100
Maybe I can also group all of those elements together

30
00:02:08,350 --> 00:02:10,300
So hit command G again

31
00:02:10,480 --> 00:02:11,960
and I will rename it

32
00:02:12,450 --> 00:02:12,760
I mean

33
00:02:12,760 --> 00:02:13,980
I have this player here

34
00:02:14,180 --> 00:02:19,490
but display with text maybe

35
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:26,780
And I will rename this one to display elements maybe

36
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:40,780
So what I'm doing it now because now I can actually move all of the elements down below because they are now grouped up together

37
00:02:42,220 --> 00:02:45,780
So I will move this little bit more down

38
00:02:46,440 --> 00:02:47,420
maybe like that

39
00:02:47,450 --> 00:02:52,520
And now you have to imagine that this part actually is quite dark

40
00:02:52,520 --> 00:02:59,940
So you don't actually see really the height for the space between the display and the lid here on top

41
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:03,160
So I will just make it maybe like that and

42
00:03:05,710 --> 00:03:08,540
Alsobring this a little bit more up here

43
00:03:08,810 --> 00:03:09,430
So again

44
00:03:09,430 --> 00:03:13,560
you don't have to choose just some specific values here

45
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:18,080
Just do it as best as you can

46
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:21,420
Now I will do it like that now

47
00:03:23,430 --> 00:03:23,890
And again

48
00:03:23,890 --> 00:03:25,640
if you want to have the same values

49
00:03:25,740 --> 00:03:26,880
just stop the video

50
00:03:26,880 --> 00:03:28,080
And then on the right side here

51
00:03:28,090 --> 00:03:32,160
you see the values I I've got now here

52
00:03:33,020 --> 00:03:35,790
but we will actually just keep it as it is

53
00:03:35,790 --> 00:03:39,600
Now it will be good on the left side

54
00:03:40,020 --> 00:03:41,040
And now again

55
00:03:41,050 --> 00:03:44,860
if you check in on the Effects tab here

56
00:03:46,170 --> 00:03:52,580
you can see also that the stripe is also getting lightened up

57
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:57,080
So deactivate it again

58
00:03:59,030 --> 00:04:01,360
and then we can continue

59
00:04:02,620 --> 00:04:08,870
Soand then I will actually just quickly rename it to maybe like a light strip

60
00:04:11,500 --> 00:04:17,420
And then we can duplicate it and place one here on the right side

61
00:04:19,910 --> 00:04:30,790
Maybe we like here and now we have made the space here where actually the buttons will be placed now

62
00:04:31,460 --> 00:04:34,710
But maybe actually it looks a little bit more tightened up

63
00:04:35,940 --> 00:04:39,990
Actually move it a little bit more in now

64
00:04:45,370 --> 00:04:45,680
Yeah

65
00:04:45,690 --> 00:04:46,840
maybe like this

66
00:04:47,640 --> 00:04:53,000
Okayso then we can actually start over with this top part here

67
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:57,260
So a little push button here with the text on the left and right side

68
00:04:58,540 --> 00:05:02,230
And I will actually just start over with the orange elements now

69
00:05:02,580 --> 00:05:05,730
So we have a little circle in the middle

70
00:05:06,510 --> 00:05:19,790
so I will actually just click on the Ellipse tool and then place it like here and maybe increase it a little bit

71
00:05:19,790 --> 00:05:21,810
So maybe like 9

72
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:24,270
Take a look

73
00:05:25,700 --> 00:05:27,310
yeahmaybe like this

74
00:05:28,090 --> 00:05:32,160
And now we can actually make a ring here and

75
00:05:34,460 --> 00:05:38,050
And we will use like 85 here

76
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:41,460
So it fits to the width of the light strips

77
00:05:43,170 --> 00:05:43,920
I don't know

78
00:05:44,930 --> 00:05:45,990
maybe like 19

79
00:05:52,180 --> 00:05:52,640
Yeah

80
00:05:52,820 --> 00:05:53,680
maybe like​‌​‌​​‌‌​​‌‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌​​‌‌​‌‌‌​​‌‌​​‌‌​​‌‌​‌‌‌​​‌‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌​‌​‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌​‌‌​​​‌‌‌‌‌‌​​‌‌‌‌‌‌​​‌‌​‌​‌​​‌‌‌​‌‌​​‌‌​​​‌​​‌‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌‌​​‌​​‌‌​​​‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌​‌​‌​​‌‌​‌​‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌‌‌‌​​​‌‌‌​‌‌​​‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌​​‌‌​‌‌‌‌‌​‌​‌‌​​​‌‌​​‌‌​​‌‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌​‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌​​​‌‌‌​​‌​​‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌​‌‌‌​​‌‌‌‌‌‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌‌​​‌‌‌​‌​‌‌‌​​‌‌​‌‌‌‌‌​‌‌​​‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌​​​‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌​​​‌​​‌‌​​‌‌​​‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌​‌‌‌​​‌‌‌‌‌​​​‌‌​‌‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌​‌‌​​‌‌​‌​‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌​‌​‌​​‌‌​‌‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌​‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌​‌‌​​​‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌​‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌​​​‌‌​‌‌‌‌‌​‌​‌​‌​​‌‌​‌​‌​​‌‌​‌​‌‌‌​‌‌​​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌‌​​‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌​​‌‌‌​​‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌​‌‌‌​​‌‌‌​​‌‌‌​‌​‌‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌​​​‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌​​‌​​‌‌​‌‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌​‌‌​​‌‌​​‌‌​​‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌​‌​‌‌‌​‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌​​​‌‌​‌​‌‌‌​‌‌​​‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌​‌‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌​​​‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌​​‌​​‌‌​‌​‌‌‌​‌​‌‌‌​​‌‌​‌‌​​​‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌​‌‌‌​​‌‌‌‌‌​​​‌‌​‌​‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌‌​​‌‌‌​‌​‌‌‌‌‌​‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌‌​​‌‌‌‌‌‌​​‌‌​‌‌‌​​‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌‌​​‌​​‌‌​​‌‌​​‌‌‌​​‌​​‌‌‌​​‌​​‌‌​‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌ that

81
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:59,450
Okayand then bring it here in the center

82
00:06:05,070 --> 00:06:06,100
It's actually a little bit

83
00:06:07,730 --> 00:06:08,360
Oh no

84
00:06:08,370 --> 00:06:12,100
this is a body now on the ellipse

85
00:06:13,100 --> 00:06:14,080
Bring this down a little bit

86
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:20,590
And also here we can choose the orange material

87
00:06:22,520 --> 00:06:24,740
And then on the left and right side

88
00:06:24,740 --> 00:06:26,200
you have some text

89
00:06:26,250 --> 00:06:30,720
And now what I actually noticed is that the line

90
00:06:30,730 --> 00:06:34,650
it is actually a little bit less in the reference image

91
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:36,350
I would actually quickly change it

92
00:06:37,850 --> 00:06:40,180
So just click here on the text

93
00:06:40,180 --> 00:06:43,170
and then you can reduce the line heat a little bit

94
00:06:44,290 --> 00:06:45,780
maybe to 0．9

95
00:06:45,780 --> 00:06:50,400
Yeahand then bring this down real quick

96
00:06:50,920 --> 00:06:52,680
And also for the left one

97
00:06:52,710 --> 00:06:52,900
maybe

98
00:06:55,630 --> 00:06:58,670
So select it and choose 0．9

99
00:07:00,770 --> 00:07:02,560
And also move it down

100
00:07:07,720 --> 00:07:09,810
And now you can actually

101
00:07:09,970 --> 00:07:12,310
I don't know if the text is actually similar

102
00:07:14,070 --> 00:07:14,730
Oh yeah

103
00:07:14,790 --> 00:07:16,090
the left and right text is similar

104
00:07:16,360 --> 00:07:17,710
So we can just copy it

105
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:21,050
And to do so

106
00:07:22,370 --> 00:07:29,560
okaylet's just duplicate this one and bring this up here

107
00:07:29,560 --> 00:07:32,390
So move it out of the display group

108
00:07:33,620 --> 00:07:35,750
And now we can actually move it down here

109
00:07:36,350 --> 00:07:38,900
So maybe like here

110
00:07:39,350 --> 00:07:41,180
and same for the other text

111
00:07:41,450 --> 00:07:45,940
So duplicate it and bring it out of the group

112
00:07:48,330 --> 00:07:52,200
And move it down here so it's aligned to the left text

113
00:07:55,810 --> 00:07:59,130
And now this actually already looks quite good

114
00:08:01,270 --> 00:08:07,720
Soand then we can actually maybe start to create a group here for the middle part elements here

115
00:08:07,940 --> 00:08:08,920
And to do so

116
00:08:08,920 --> 00:08:09,920
we will just

117
00:08:10,360 --> 00:08:13,520
againselect all of the elements here

118
00:08:13,530 --> 00:08:15,220
hit command in G

119
00:08:15,580 --> 00:08:17,970
and then we will give it a name

120
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:22,020
maybe like the image components

121
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:25,000
Okay

122
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:37,820
and maybe at this point we will do some more fine adjustments here because I actually don't like the overall positioning here of the elements in comparison to the reference image

123
00:08:38,350 --> 00:08:45,920
So maybe we will actually bring some elements or move some elements more to the top here

124
00:08:46,420 --> 00:08:47,670
And for example

125
00:08:47,750 --> 00:08:52,390
I will now move the whole display up here

126
00:08:52,390 --> 00:08:53,960
Maybeyeah

127
00:08:54,410 --> 00:08:55,540
maybe like here

128
00:08:57,510 --> 00:09:00,430
and also the mid components now

129
00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:05,830
So now they are all grouped up so you can move them all simultaneously

130
00:09:07,540 --> 00:09:09,170
Yeahmaybe like that

131
00:09:13,020 --> 00:09:20,360
And then I will actually also reduce the height here of the body because it actually is a little bit lower in height

132
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:23,730
So just select the FCU here

133
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,190
go to the body

134
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:27,960
and then resize it a little bit

135
00:09:29,640 --> 00:09:29,900
maybe like

136
00:09:30,250 --> 00:09:30,360
like

137
00:09:32,690 --> 00:09:32,720
That

138
00:09:37,090 --> 00:09:40,190
Okaythis looks good for now

139
00:09:41,500 --> 00:09:44,730
And maybe if we activate the blue mode now again

140
00:09:46,520 --> 00:09:53,590
Yeahso I think this color actually looks quite similar to those light strips

141
00:09:53,660 --> 00:09:56,750
Maybe I will actually show you guys the screenshot here

142
00:09:56,750 --> 00:10:00,930
So this color actually looks quite the same here

143
00:10:01,020 --> 00:10:06,370
but the display color actually is a little bit more yellow

144
00:10:06,370 --> 00:10:07,300
like in the

145
00:10:07,310 --> 00:10:08,790
in the reference image

146
00:10:09,030 --> 00:10:13,090
So maybe I will change this one as well quickly

147
00:10:13,790 --> 00:10:21,210
And maybe we can actually just select the display texts here in the in the group

148
00:10:21,370 --> 00:10:24,500
So now I selected all of the five texts here

149
00:10:25,410 --> 00:10:28,410
And now you see on the right side there

150
00:10:28,580 --> 00:10:30,920
it's shown the orange part material

151
00:10:30,920 --> 00:10:34,710
but we will actually unlink it so we can change it

152
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:40,390
So we actually don't change the overall overall color of every element

153
00:10:40,900 --> 00:10:48,570
And here we can actually maybe bring this a little bit more to the yellow side here

154
00:10:50,970 --> 00:10:52,280
Yeahmaybe like that

155
00:10:54,850 --> 00:10:57,340
Yeahthis looks good for now

156
00:10:58,620 --> 00:11:02,370
So now you have a little bit more of the yellow color in it

157
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:05,620
Like that

158
00:11:08,620 --> 00:11:09,800
Yeahthis looks good for now

159
00:11:09,800 --> 00:11:15,070
So you can actually just copy the color code here if you want to have the same color as me now

160
00:11:16,400 --> 00:11:25,390
And then we can actually also just save this material has the display

161
00:11:27,650 --> 00:11:29,910
Display the text

162
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:33,900
So we can just save this color value

163
00:11:34,750 --> 00:11:36,500
And now we're ready to go

164
00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:45,460
And now you have a more separation of the of display text and the light strips of the yellow blurry color here

165
00:11:45,660 --> 00:11:48,240
So this actually looks quite nice now

166
00:11:51,130 --> 00:11:53,420
YeahI think this looks good

167
00:11:56,250 --> 00:12:02,620
And maybe also the color of the body is actually a little bit more darker

168
00:12:02,730 --> 00:12:03,630
in my opinion

169
00:12:05,260 --> 00:12:11,070
So maybe we can actually change the body color as well here

170
00:12:12,820 --> 00:12:16,090
If we head over again to our FCU group here

171
00:12:16,850 --> 00:12:21,450
we can actually maybe change this color value here to an overlay

172
00:12:22,330 --> 00:12:26,430
Yeahand now we actually see that it's not that orange anymore

173
00:12:26,430 --> 00:12:31,190
So we actually get a little bit more of the blue color again

174
00:12:32,140 --> 00:12:32,650
And yeah

175
00:12:32,650 --> 00:12:35,580
I actually like this a lot more

176
00:12:35,580 --> 00:12:37,980
So we actually keep it now as it is

177
00:12:37,980 --> 00:12:38,460
So again

178
00:12:38,460 --> 00:12:44,470
just change the overlay color here as the color of the orange color here to overlay

179
00:12:45,750 --> 00:12:48,640
And now this actually looks quite good

180
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:50,180
So next up

181
00:12:50,180 --> 00:12:54,390
we can actually start with this little knob here

182
00:12:54,390 --> 00:12:56,160
or this push button

183
00:12:56,890 --> 00:12:59,950
as you see it in the reference image

184
00:13:00,420 --> 00:13:02,220
So this one here

185
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:07,970
so we have just a little black button here with some specular reflection on the bottom

186
00:13:08,500 --> 00:13:11,650
and we will just rebuild that

187
00:13:11,660 --> 00:13:15,980
So we just head back over to our spline scene here

188
00:13:16,740 --> 00:13:21,520
and then we can actually just make use again of the Boolean modifier

189
00:13:21,700 --> 00:13:23,290
So for instance

190
00:13:23,290 --> 00:13:26,420
we can just work with two ellipses here

191
00:13:26,440 --> 00:13:32,660
So choose the Ellipse tool here from the top toolbar and then place it here on the body

192
00:13:33,930 --> 00:13:36,690
And for the width and heat

193
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,910
we can actually maybe use a value like 7

194
00:13:40,180 --> 00:13:40,700
for example

195
00:13:41,930 --> 00:13:51,630
So we have some a little gap here around the button and then align it here in the middle

196
00:13:53,790 --> 00:13:55,080
Okaymaybe like that

197
00:13:55,520 --> 00:14:00,370
And then we can maybe actually add some extrusion here

198
00:14:00,370 --> 00:14:02,470
So we can go with two here maybe

199
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:07,050
And then we also start to bevel it

200
00:14:07,060 --> 00:14:08,160
And the bevel sides

201
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:09,760
you can also just increase

202
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:12,720
And then if you rotate around

203
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:14,200
you see a little pill here

204
00:14:15,730 --> 00:14:17,390
and then again

205
00:14:17,420 --> 00:14:20,300
make sure that it's connected to the body

206
00:14:22,180 --> 00:14:28,320
Soand then I will actually just give it a quick recolor here

207
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:29,040
So just black

208
00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:30,080
so you see it better

209
00:14:31,300 --> 00:14:36,410
And then we can actually maybe just duplicate this layer

210
00:14:36,580 --> 00:14:39,400
So now we have ellipse and ellipse 2 here

211
00:14:40,190 --> 00:14:41,780
and for the ellipse 2

212
00:14:41,790 --> 00:14:44,620
we'll resize it again

213
00:14:44,870 --> 00:14:51,440
so maybe like 5．5 and for the height as well

214
00:14:52,580 --> 00:14:56,330
And now if you actually bring this up here

215
00:14:56,780 --> 00:14:59,400
you see that you see now that you have a little

216
00:15:00,250 --> 00:15:04,050
a tinier version here of the default ellipse

217
00:15:04,270 --> 00:15:09,190
And what we are going to do now is actually just subtract the shapes from each other

218
00:15:09,780 --> 00:15:10,260
each other

219
00:15:10,260 --> 00:15:15,870
so just select both of them and then again on the top right to over here

220
00:15:15,870 --> 00:15:19,130
you can just select the subtraction mode

221
00:15:19,690 --> 00:15:25,350
And now you see that both of the shapes now are merged together

222
00:15:25,420 --> 00:15:29,090
And the second shape actually is subtracted from the first one

223
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:34,640
Soand we can also make some corrections afterwards

224
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:38,520
So just head over to the Boolean operator in the menu

225
00:15:38,730 --> 00:15:45,190
and then you can actually just move it and the right on the right side here

226
00:15:45,190 --> 00:15:46,720
or on the left side

227
00:15:46,810 --> 00:15:52,140
I will maybe do it like that here

228
00:15:54,900 --> 00:15:56,770
Okaythat's good for now

229
00:15:57,680 --> 00:15:59,700
And yeah

230
00:15:59,710 --> 00:16:01,230
that should be fine

231
00:16:02,470 --> 00:16:06,020
And then maybe align it again on the not on that side

232
00:16:06,050 --> 00:16:07,310
on this side here

233
00:16:08,640 --> 00:16:11,490
and then move it a little bit inside here

234
00:16:13,550 --> 00:16:14,610
All right

235
00:16:15,660 --> 00:16:17,310
so for the basic shape

236
00:16:17,320 --> 00:16:18,840
this should be fine now

237
00:16:18,850 --> 00:16:22,600
And then we can actually start over with the material here

238
00:16:23,260 --> 00:16:24,120
And again

239
00:16:24,130 --> 00:16:25,960
if we look at the reference image

240
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:31,100
we see that it has some specular reflection here

241
00:16:31,470 --> 00:16:33,380
And to achieve this

242
00:16:33,380 --> 00:16:36,620
we can actually again go with the medcap layer here

243
00:16:36,630 --> 00:16:38,900
So just select the Boolean operator

244
00:16:39,790 --> 00:16:42,780
I will actually just quickly rename it for you

245
00:16:43,160 --> 00:16:45,840
So we will name it it like

246
00:16:48,180 --> 00:16:49,680
Knobbutton

247
00:16:51,850 --> 00:16:54,010
And then on the material side here

248
00:16:54,020 --> 00:16:59,040
we can actually bring this lighting layer here to the bottom

249
00:17:00,580 --> 00:17:05,510
And then we can actually introduce another medcap layer here

250
00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:10,090
such as medca the from the menu here

251
00:17:10,210 --> 00:17:14,710
And then we will actually use this one here from the library

252
00:17:17,140 --> 00:17:20,290
And then bring it one down here

253
00:17:20,450 --> 00:17:21,490
And for the color

254
00:17:21,490 --> 00:17:23,790
we will actually use an overlay

255
00:17:24,620 --> 00:17:27,100
So now it has a color black

256
00:17:28,200 --> 00:17:32,900
And then we can actually also add a little outline

257
00:17:32,900 --> 00:17:37,670
So we have a little more of a separation from the background

258
00:17:37,800 --> 00:17:44,050
So choose outline here and here you can play around how how you want to

259
00:17:44,320 --> 00:17:48,580
but I will actually maybe increase the size here a little bit

260
00:17:50,810 --> 00:17:52,200
And the outline

261
00:17:52,200 --> 00:17:54,880
I also want to be an overlay

262
00:17:56,270 --> 00:17:57,010
And you can look

263
00:17:57,020 --> 00:18:00,970
maybe you can also make it white and maybe leave it here

264
00:18:01,420 --> 00:18:03,580
but now in black

265
00:18:05,580 --> 00:18:10,710
And then we can actually make another Matte Capp layer

266
00:18:12,950 --> 00:18:14,060
And for this 1

267
00:18:14,060 --> 00:18:18,060
I will make it not as shiny as the first one here

268
00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:21,830
but do also an overlay here

269
00:18:23,880 --> 00:18:24,830
And now actually

270
00:18:24,830 --> 00:18:26,890
I think this looks quite good

271
00:18:27,430 --> 00:18:31,250
So if you compare the two objects here

272
00:18:31,250 --> 00:18:35,320
now I know this specular reflections is a little bit bigger here on the bottom

273
00:18:35,890 --> 00:18:41,480
but we will maybe change the overall lighting setup afterwards

274
00:18:42,590 --> 00:18:47,000
This specular reflection maybe moves a little bit more on the left side here or the bottom

275
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:50,990
But I actually think for the first try

276
00:18:50,990 --> 00:18:53,120
this looks now pretty good

277
00:18:54,360 --> 00:18:55,950
Maybe we can do some

278
00:18:59,300 --> 00:19:03,830
I don't know if we can maybe actually make it a little bit smaller

279
00:19:04,860 --> 00:19:06,860
So like 6．5

280
00:19:07,940 --> 00:19:09,980
because I think if we look at the image

281
00:19:10,090 --> 00:19:11,150
you have a little bit

282
00:19:12,050 --> 00:19:16,780
a little bigger gap here around the light circle and the button itself

283
00:19:18,300 --> 00:19:19,490
So this should be fine

284
00:19:19,490 --> 00:19:19,890
Now

285
00:19:20,770 --> 00:19:23,350
and just for clarification

286
00:19:23,350 --> 00:19:27,070
I will just rename those ellipses also

287
00:19:27,250 --> 00:19:31,140
So this is the inner ellipse

288
00:19:33,380 --> 00:19:37,580
This one was the younger ellipse

289
00:19:40,660 --> 00:19:41,380
Okay

290
00:19:42,360 --> 00:19:46,180
so now we have this push button created here

291
00:19:47,160 --> 00:19:49,790
So this looks quite good

292
00:19:50,660 --> 00:19:51,600
Maybe I will actually

293
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:52,200
you know

294
00:19:53,290 --> 00:19:55,550
maybe you guys see it If I'm zooming out

295
00:19:55,560 --> 00:20:00,230
the outline effect actually is a little bit too to be in my opinion

296
00:20:00,230 --> 00:20:04,170
So I will actually reduce the outline value here

297
00:20:06,770 --> 00:20:08,680
And now if I zoom out

298
00:20:09,950 --> 00:20:12,020
the outline is a little thinner

299
00:20:12,080 --> 00:20:14,220
So this should be fine

300
00:20:14,220 --> 00:20:14,700
Now

301
00:20:15,340 --> 00:20:16,800
okaythis was it for

302
00:20:17,330 --> 00:20:22,130
so then we can actually start to continue with the other buttons

303
00:20:22,450 --> 00:20:24,160
So those ones here

304
00:20:25,340 --> 00:20:27,140
greenblack ones here

305
00:20:27,280 --> 00:20:28,430
So for AP 1

306
00:20:28,430 --> 00:20:29,150
AP 2

307
00:20:29,150 --> 00:20:30,990
and the third one here

308
00:20:31,710 --> 00:20:35,680
and best for this shape

309
00:20:35,680 --> 00:20:36,530
we can actually

310
00:20:36,530 --> 00:20:40,250
againjust use some of the simple shapes here

311
00:20:40,290 --> 00:20:42,330
So for this little

312
00:20:42,330 --> 00:20:44,160
I don't know if you see it

313
00:20:44,550 --> 00:20:50,560
So you have a little surrounding here in around of the

314
00:20:50,570 --> 00:20:52,500
of the main button here

315
00:20:53,360 --> 00:20:57,630
So we would just maybe start with a simple rectangle here

316
00:20:58,340 --> 00:20:59,940
place it in here

317
00:21:00,570 --> 00:21:02,890
and for the size

318
00:21:03,830 --> 00:21:06,200
we can maybe just make it a little bit bigger here

319
00:21:06,590 --> 00:21:07,680
So maybe

320
00:21:07,750 --> 00:21:08,370
ohsorry

321
00:21:08,460 --> 00:21:13,020
maybe 10 in both directions

322
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:16,230
And then for the corner

323
00:21:16,230 --> 00:21:18,420
we can make it a little bit rounded

324
00:21:18,750 --> 00:21:20,980
so maybe just one here

325
00:21:21,420 --> 00:21:22,840
And for the extrusion

326
00:21:23,710 --> 00:21:25,550
I will maybe choose 0

327
00:21:26,020 --> 00:21:27,930
0．25

328
00:21:28,620 --> 00:21:29,300
And yeah

329
00:21:29,310 --> 00:21:31,080
this should do the work now

330
00:21:31,140 --> 00:21:32,080
And for the color

331
00:21:32,210 --> 00:21:41,940
I will actually use black and also bring it above the lining layer so it is indeed black

332
00:21:42,660 --> 00:21:48,260
And then I will move it a little bit down here and on the left

333
00:21:49,130 --> 00:21:53,350
So maybe add a O if we look at the reference image

334
00:21:54,080 --> 00:21:56,420
so it's not really aligned with the text

335
00:21:57,480 --> 00:22:00,860
a little bit more align to the center

336
00:22:02,270 --> 00:22:06,690
So I will actually move this one more on this side

337
00:22:09,900 --> 00:22:11,390
Okaymaybe like that

338
00:22:12,760 --> 00:22:13,280
Okay

339
00:22:13,290 --> 00:22:15,450
and then on top of this shade

340
00:22:15,460 --> 00:22:18,780
we will actually place the main button here

341
00:22:19,840 --> 00:22:23,060
this little bit more tinier button here

342
00:22:23,070 --> 00:22:26,970
So we have the surrounding and then the main button in the center

343
00:22:28,320 --> 00:22:29,950
And for this

344
00:22:29,970 --> 00:22:33,500
I will actually just duplicate this one

345
00:22:34,830 --> 00:22:37,950
And then for the size of it

346
00:22:38,310 --> 00:22:41,820
I will actually use maybe

347
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:45,640
maybe something like 8

348
00:22:47,180 --> 00:22:51,440
So we'll just try and look how it looks

349
00:22:52,820 --> 00:22:54,460
And for the extrusion here

350
00:22:54,510 --> 00:22:57,470
I will use a little bigger value here

351
00:22:57,470 --> 00:22:58,600
So maybe like 0

352
00:22:59,020 --> 00:22:59,920
12．5

353
00:23:01,410 --> 00:23:06,160
and then also give it a max bevel and also max bevel sides

354
00:23:07,230 --> 00:23:10,390
And the corner should actually be fine now

355
00:23:11,350 --> 00:23:12,580
And now if you rotate it

356
00:23:14,300 --> 00:23:15,450
yeahyou see now

357
00:23:16,180 --> 00:23:19,220
or maybe I will just change quickly the color here

358
00:23:19,230 --> 00:23:22,900
So now you see you have an extruded side here

359
00:23:24,030 --> 00:23:28,010
This little black 1 is behind the first one here

360
00:23:28,460 --> 00:23:36,570
So just as the same as in the reference image or the wrong alignment here

361
00:23:36,920 --> 00:23:37,820
okay

362
00:23:38,730 --> 00:23:46,820
And then we can actually maybe start to adapt the material of the of the main button here

363
00:23:47,220 --> 00:23:48,850
So the background

364
00:23:48,850 --> 00:23:51,200
we can actually just leave as black here

365
00:23:51,560 --> 00:23:52,820
And for the main button

366
00:23:52,820 --> 00:23:55,260
we will do some changes

367
00:23:55,830 --> 00:23:57,790
So and for the material

368
00:23:57,810 --> 00:24:02,720
actuallyI will change this one again to a black here

369
00:24:03,670 --> 00:24:05,890
And the lighting 1

370
00:24:05,890 --> 00:24:08,680
I will actually change physical right now

371
00:24:09,730 --> 00:24:12,420
and then I will introduce another layer

372
00:24:12,420 --> 00:24:14,350
which will be a medcap layer

373
00:24:15,050 --> 00:24:16,690
And for this matte cap

374
00:24:16,700 --> 00:24:24,390
I will actually again choose this white 1 here from the library and then bring it one down

375
00:24:25,170 --> 00:24:30,220
And then we will change the black color here to an overlay

376
00:24:30,300 --> 00:24:37,020
So now you see the reflection again and maybe change the opacity here to something like 80

377
00:24:37,570 --> 00:24:40,870
so it's a little bit more separated here from the background

378
00:24:40,870 --> 00:24:42,820
So it looks a little bit more gray

379
00:24:43,710 --> 00:24:46,090
And this should actually do the work

380
00:24:46,090 --> 00:24:46,590
I think

381
00:24:46,590 --> 00:24:48,530
So this actually looks good

382
00:24:49,600 --> 00:24:54,610
And now we can keep on going with the text here

383
00:24:54,610 --> 00:24:57,390
and also maybe I will show you

384
00:24:57,390 --> 00:25:00,570
So we have a little text here and another

385
00:25:01,180 --> 00:25:05,160
yeahlike light or green rectangle here

386
00:25:05,160 --> 00:25:08,350
So just if we talk about the geometry

387
00:25:09,640 --> 00:25:12,780
so we will do that for now

388
00:25:14,310 --> 00:25:15,710
And for the text

389
00:25:15,710 --> 00:25:20,140
we can actually maybe just copy the text here from the button

390
00:25:22,240 --> 00:25:23,020
Here

391
00:25:23,230 --> 00:25:25,360
so where is it

392
00:25:25,500 --> 00:25:26,460
Like here

393
00:25:26,480 --> 00:25:43,100
You can go here in the left toolbar and then just simply copy one of the texts here and just then copy and paste it here on top of the new button

394
00:25:44,980 --> 00:25:46,270
So maybe like here

395
00:25:46,280 --> 00:25:51,650
And then you have to keep in mind to bring this in front here

396
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:53,380
So maybe like that

397
00:25:56,670 --> 00:25:58,110
Align it in the middle

398
00:25:58,400 --> 00:25:59,730
And for the content

399
00:25:59,740 --> 00:26:03,390
actuallywe have to use AP one

400
00:26:04,870 --> 00:26:14,760
So go to the text and then delete the old content and type in AP 1 and then move it down here

401
00:26:14,810 --> 00:26:15,550
So like

402
00:26:15,690 --> 00:26:18,760
just like in the like in the reference image

403
00:26:19,040 --> 00:26:20,220
so here on the bottom

404
00:26:24,320 --> 00:26:26,860
And then you're good to go for the text

405
00:26:28,060 --> 00:26:29,310
And then for the

406
00:26:29,470 --> 00:26:30,820
for the rectangle here

407
00:26:30,820 --> 00:26:31,510
the green

408
00:26:31,620 --> 00:26:32,810
the green rectangle

409
00:26:33,520 --> 00:26:34,300
we show it again

410
00:26:34,300 --> 00:26:35,420
This one here

411
00:26:35,860 --> 00:26:39,980
we actually can just use a simple rectangle

412
00:26:40,960 --> 00:26:43,230
place it here on the button

413
00:26:44,700 --> 00:26:45,980
Maybe for the Wif

414
00:26:46,060 --> 00:26:49,700
we will actually just use the same Wif here as the text

415
00:26:50,970 --> 00:26:55,860
So maybe zoom in a little bit and resize it here

416
00:26:58,650 --> 00:26:59,980
So maybe like that

417
00:26:59,990 --> 00:27:01,750
I just quickly look

418
00:27:02,740 --> 00:27:05,040
Okayhere's a little bit more of a gap

419
00:27:05,460 --> 00:27:08,000
So it will also

420
00:27:08,940 --> 00:27:10,330
ohI mean

421
00:27:10,360 --> 00:27:14,540
it looks actually quite similar the way we will just leave it here as it is

422
00:27:15,080 --> 00:27:17,230
And for the green color

423
00:27:17,420 --> 00:27:20,290
we actually have to change the material here again

424
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:23,990
So for the color I will actually use

425
00:27:24,830 --> 00:27:26,930
I paste it here

426
00:27:27,710 --> 00:27:30,000
So this is RGB code here

427
00:27:30,010 --> 00:27:32,770
and this is a hex code

428
00:27:33,010 --> 00:27:35,550
So just like darker green

429
00:27:35,550 --> 00:27:38,810
But we will actually work then with the lighting layer here

430
00:27:38,820 --> 00:27:39,850
And for that

431
00:27:39,870 --> 00:27:43,370
we will actually paste the same color here

432
00:27:43,370 --> 00:27:44,090
So again

433
00:27:44,100 --> 00:27:46,440
this is a hex code here of the green color

434
00:27:46,970 --> 00:27:49,520
and then just hit enter

435
00:27:50,640 --> 00:27:53,700
And now if you compare both of the images

436
00:27:54,330 --> 00:27:56,530
it looks actually quite similar

437
00:27:58,050 --> 00:28:03,120
but maybe actually let give it a little bit of a corner here

438
00:28:03,130 --> 00:28:03,780
So yeah

439
00:28:05,510 --> 00:28:12,630
maybe like that and zoom out a little bit compared with the reference image again

440
00:28:14,340 --> 00:28:16,500
And yeah

441
00:28:16,520 --> 00:28:18,410
this looks quite good

442
00:28:19,460 --> 00:28:22,850
I actually don't really like the size of the text here

443
00:28:22,850 --> 00:28:26,330
so maybe just a little bit smaller

444
00:28:26,600 --> 00:28:31,710
So let's go with something like maybe 2．8

445
00:28:32,910 --> 00:28:33,830
So like that

446
00:28:35,190 --> 00:28:36,200
bring this down

447
00:28:38,250 --> 00:28:41,940
And now if you compare both of the images

448
00:28:43,010 --> 00:28:44,670
it looks quite similar

449
00:28:46,040 --> 00:28:46,990
And now again

450
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:48,590
just rename everything

451
00:28:48,590 --> 00:28:51,770
So this one is the background

452
00:28:54,200 --> 00:28:55,150
Background black

453
00:28:56,790 --> 00:28:58,640
This one is the main button here

454
00:29:02,800 --> 00:29:06,810
And this one is the button text

455
00:29:09,730 --> 00:29:12,770
And this one is the green highlight

456
00:29:18,800 --> 00:29:19,350
All right

457
00:29:20,440 --> 00:29:31,840
and then we will actually group this all together and rename the group to maybe the other one was no button

458
00:29:32,320 --> 00:29:35,200
So this one will be the push button

459
00:29:37,400 --> 00:29:44,750
And maybe we have to now look at the reference image again

460
00:29:46,650 --> 00:29:48,360
And for the positioning

461
00:29:48,850 --> 00:29:52,060
I will actually bring this a little bit more up here

462
00:29:52,240 --> 00:29:53,230
So too

463
00:29:54,630 --> 00:29:55,900
maybe like here

464
00:29:57,820 --> 00:30:04,200
And then what's quite nice now is that we can actually just copy this button here

465
00:30:04,300 --> 00:30:07,460
So we have the three runs here

466
00:30:08,520 --> 00:30:09,530
So again

467
00:30:11,020 --> 00:30:13,160
just copy the group

468
00:30:13,270 --> 00:30:15,060
So hit command to D

469
00:30:15,580 --> 00:30:17,970
and then you can move it here to the side

470
00:30:20,050 --> 00:30:20,730
Then align it

471
00:30:20,730 --> 00:30:24,080
So if it fits to the grid here

472
00:30:25,140 --> 00:30:26,390
so maybe like that

473
00:30:27,250 --> 00:30:32,410
And here I will just change it quickly to AP 2

474
00:30:33,980 --> 00:30:35,120
And then again

475
00:30:35,170 --> 00:30:37,650
just hit command and D

476
00:30:38,400 --> 00:30:42,720
duplicate the button and then bring the last one down here

477
00:30:43,760 --> 00:30:49,020
So you can also just orientate here to the green line so it fits

478
00:30:51,340 --> 00:30:54,080
I'll just check the reference image again

479
00:30:54,470 --> 00:30:57,830
So this gap is actually a little bit smaller

480
00:31:00,660 --> 00:31:01,720
So maybe like

481
00:31:03,960 --> 00:31:04,500
That actually

482
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:14,540
I'll move it a little bit here and the other ones to the fender

483
00:31:18,380 --> 00:31:22,050
So we have kind of like the same gap here and also here

484
00:31:27,200 --> 00:31:28,790
So if we simulate now

485
00:31:30,260 --> 00:31:32,510
maybe even a little bit closer

486
00:31:36,170 --> 00:31:36,190
So

487
00:31:39,190 --> 00:31:39,660
Like that

488
00:31:39,680 --> 00:31:40,420
maybe

489
00:31:41,410 --> 00:31:43,510
So this looks good for now

490
00:31:43,600 --> 00:31:46,710
So if we compare it here to the reference image

491
00:31:46,880 --> 00:31:51,790
we can maybe bring the light strips more together here so

492
00:31:54,150 --> 00:31:55,610
So better overall

493
00:31:56,140 --> 00:32:00,110
Looking to move the light strips here

494
00:32:00,650 --> 00:32:02,130
more to the center

495
00:32:05,280 --> 00:32:05,980
And then again

496
00:32:05,980 --> 00:32:07,830
compare it here with the reference image

497
00:32:09,400 --> 00:32:10,260
And this

498
00:32:10,320 --> 00:32:16,960
those strips actually are kind of like an alignment with the last button here

499
00:32:17,170 --> 00:32:26,810
So I will actually just select both of the strips here and move them a little bit in the direction of the last button

500
00:32:30,680 --> 00:32:33,370
And for the overall looking

501
00:32:37,430 --> 00:32:41,610
We maybe have to reduce the height here again

502
00:32:41,620 --> 00:32:42,210
So again

503
00:32:42,210 --> 00:32:48,280
just click on the body and then resize it a little bit

504
00:32:49,880 --> 00:32:51,020
So maybe like th​‌​‌​​‌‌​​‌‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌​​‌‌​‌‌‌​​‌‌​​‌‌​​‌‌​‌‌‌​​‌‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌​‌​‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌​‌‌​​​‌‌‌‌‌‌​​‌‌‌‌‌‌​​‌‌​‌​‌​​‌‌‌​‌‌​​‌‌​​​‌​​‌‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌‌​​‌​​‌‌​​​‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌​‌​‌​​‌‌​‌​‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌‌‌‌​​​‌‌‌​‌‌​​‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌​​‌‌​‌‌‌‌‌​‌​‌‌​​​‌‌​​‌‌​​‌‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌​‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌​​​‌‌‌​​‌​​‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌​‌‌‌​​‌‌‌‌‌‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌‌​​‌‌‌​‌​‌‌‌​​‌‌​‌‌‌‌‌​‌‌​​‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌​​​‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌​​​‌​​‌‌​​‌‌​​‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌​‌‌‌​​‌‌‌‌‌​​​‌‌​‌‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌​‌‌​​‌‌​‌​‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌​‌​‌​​‌‌​‌‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌​‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌​‌‌​​​‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌​‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌​​​‌‌​‌‌‌‌‌​‌​‌​‌​​‌‌​‌​‌​​‌‌​‌​‌‌‌​‌‌​​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌‌​​‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌​​‌‌‌​​‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌​‌‌‌​​‌‌‌​​‌‌‌​‌​‌‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌​​​‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌​​‌​​‌‌​‌‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌​‌‌​​‌‌​​‌‌​​‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌​‌​‌‌‌​‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌​​​‌‌​‌​‌‌‌​‌‌​​‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌​‌‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌​​​‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌​​‌​​‌‌​‌​‌‌‌​‌​‌‌‌​​‌‌​‌‌​​​‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌​‌‌‌​​‌‌‌‌‌​​​‌‌​‌​‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌‌​​‌‌‌​‌​‌‌‌‌‌​‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌‌​​‌‌‌‌‌‌​​‌‌​‌‌‌​​‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌‌​​‌​​‌‌​​‌‌​​‌‌‌​​‌​​‌‌‌​​‌​​‌‌​‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌at

505
00:32:53,180 --> 00:32:56,500
So now if you compare both all the objects

506
00:32:58,510 --> 00:33:00,570
It looks much better

507
00:33:00,840 --> 00:33:01,990
much better now

508
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:03,460
So maybe again

509
00:33:03,530 --> 00:33:05,340
just a little bit

510
00:33:06,300 --> 00:33:07,380
So like that

511
00:33:09,430 --> 00:33:09,830
Okay

512
00:33:09,840 --> 00:33:13,730
now we are kind of ready with the middle part here

513
00:33:13,730 --> 00:33:17,360
And now we will just continue with the right side and the left side here
