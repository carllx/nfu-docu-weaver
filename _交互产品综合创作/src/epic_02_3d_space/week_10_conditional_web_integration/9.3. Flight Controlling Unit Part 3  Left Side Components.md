1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:07,300
So now we can actually start with the left side here or maybe show on the screenshot

2
00:00:07,300 --> 00:00:09,560
So this left side here

3
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:11,930
And maybe at this point

4
00:00:11,930 --> 00:00:20,600
we will actually try to make the size of the object actually as exactly as possible

5
00:00:20,900 --> 00:00:25,870
So maybe you can just use a screenshot here as a mask here

6
00:00:26,280 --> 00:00:27,120
And for that

7
00:00:27,120 --> 00:00:32,210
I actually try to bring this down here on the left side

8
00:00:32,220 --> 00:00:35,690
maybe to get the hydride

9
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:42,160
So maybe scale the that property

10
00:00:42,160 --> 00:00:44,850
not you sir or not sir

11
00:00:45,490 --> 00:00:47,760
b​‌​‌​​‌‌​​‌‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌​​‌‌​‌‌‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌​​‌‌​‌​‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌​‌​‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌​‌‌​​​‌‌‌‌‌‌​​‌‌‌​‌‌​​‌‌​‌​‌​​‌‌‌​‌‌​​‌‌​​​‌​​‌‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌‌​​‌​​‌‌‌​​‌​​‌‌​​​‌​​‌‌‌‌‌‌​​‌‌​‌​‌​​‌‌​‌​‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌‌‌‌​​​‌‌‌​‌‌​​‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌​​‌‌​‌‌​​​‌‌​‌‌​​​‌‌​​‌‌​​‌‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌​‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌​​​‌‌‌​​‌​​‌‌​‌‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌​‌‌‌‌‌​‌​‌‌​​​‌‌‌‌‌‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌‌​​‌‌‌​‌​‌‌‌​​‌‌​‌‌​​​‌‌‌​​‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌​​​‌‌‌‌‌​​​‌‌​​​‌​​‌‌​​‌‌​​‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌​‌‌‌​​‌‌‌‌‌​​​‌‌​‌‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌​‌‌​​‌‌​‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌​​​‌‌​‌​‌​​‌‌​‌‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌​‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌​‌‌​​​‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌​​​‌​​‌‌​‌​‌‌‌​‌​​​‌​​‌‌​‌‌‌‌‌​‌​‌​‌​​‌‌​‌​‌​​‌‌​‌​‌‌‌​‌‌​​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌‌​​‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌​​‌‌‌​​‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌​‌‌‌​​‌‌‌​​‌‌‌​‌​‌‌‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌​​‌​​‌‌​‌​‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌​‌‌​​‌‌​​‌‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌​‌​‌‌‌​‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌‌​​‌​​‌‌​‌‌‌​​‌‌‌​​‌​​‌‌‌‌‌‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌​‌‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌​​​‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌​​‌​​‌‌​‌​‌‌‌​‌​‌‌‌​​‌‌​‌‌​​​‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌​‌‌‌​​‌‌‌‌‌​​​‌‌​‌​‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌‌​​‌‌‌​‌​‌‌‌‌‌​‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌‌​​‌‌‌‌‌‌​​‌‌​‌‌‌​​‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌‌​​‌​​‌‌​​‌‌​​‌‌‌​​‌​​‌‌‌​​‌​​‌‌​‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌ut 0．3

12
00:00:50,050 --> 00:00:53,550
And the y component to 0．3

13
00:00:55,130 --> 00:00:59,680
And now you see now that it actually matches here quite good

14
00:01:00,580 --> 00:01:07,740
And then we can also just exceed the value of the x component

15
00:01:08,710 --> 00:01:12,550
And now we actually know that the height is actually correct

16
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:17,360
but the width of both of the objects is now not the same

17
00:01:17,650 --> 00:01:23,430
So now we can actually just adapt the size of our object to the image

18
00:01:23,440 --> 00:01:24,860
and then it should fit

19
00:01:25,150 --> 00:01:30,280
So then we can actually just go to the FCU here and then resize it

20
00:01:32,900 --> 00:01:34,320
So maybe like that

21
00:01:40,380 --> 00:01:43,740
So now it is in alignment here with the screenshot

22
00:01:43,860 --> 00:01:48,790
But now we actually also have to resize our screen here

23
00:01:48,790 --> 00:01:50,000
So the display

24
00:01:50,660 --> 00:01:51,990
And for this

25
00:01:51,990 --> 00:01:56,720
we can also just resize it here

26
00:01:58,670 --> 00:02:02,020
So look that this is now in alignment with this here

27
00:02:02,700 --> 00:02:05,040
And the same for the other side

28
00:02:07,830 --> 00:02:09,380
So maybe like that

29
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:17,160
And now we can also just bring the text here

30
00:02:17,160 --> 00:02:18,570
maybe in alignment

31
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:20,530
So maybe this one even more on the right side

32
00:02:22,710 --> 00:02:25,140
And also this one

33
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:33,200
So this actually looks quite good where it is

34
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:42,970
But then we can actually also bring this whole middle component part here a little bit to the left

35
00:02:42,980 --> 00:02:47,030
But I actually forgot to bring all of the other things here in the group

36
00:02:48,570 --> 00:02:49,170
Just again

37
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:50,500
select everything

38
00:02:50,520 --> 00:02:55,950
we just create it and then bring this one here in the mid components group

39
00:02:56,870 --> 00:03:01,640
And now we can drag everything here on the left side

40
00:03:02,520 --> 00:03:06,990
So now it actually is again in alignment here in the center

41
00:03:08,680 --> 00:03:09,840
And yeah

42
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:12,290
this actually looks now quite good

43
00:03:12,970 --> 00:03:13,770
Okay

44
00:03:14,260 --> 00:03:17,660
so then we can actually start with the left side here

45
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:33,610
so maybe just hide this for now and maybe what we can just start right off are those elements here because we already created a kind of version of those elements here

46
00:03:33,610 --> 00:03:35,310
So the no button

47
00:03:35,310 --> 00:03:37,370
we can just actually copy from here

48
00:03:37,390 --> 00:03:39,290
And this little button here

49
00:03:39,290 --> 00:03:40,900
we can copy from here

50
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:45,260
but this is actually just a little bit tinier here

51
00:03:45,510 --> 00:03:53,200
so we can just adapt the size to our needs and we will just head back over to SPE

52
00:03:54,880 --> 00:03:55,950
And first

53
00:03:55,960 --> 00:04:00,700
we will actually just copy our no button here

54
00:04:01,020 --> 00:04:03,000
So hit command and C

55
00:04:03,300 --> 00:04:04,990
or maybe just command and D

56
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:09,620
duplicate it and bring it here on the left side

57
00:04:12,050 --> 00:04:13,960
So maybe like here

58
00:04:16,330 --> 00:04:23,380
And then make sure to actually move this out of the mid components part here because we actually divided here

59
00:04:23,380 --> 00:04:25,210
So this is the mid component part

60
00:04:25,210 --> 00:04:28,100
This will be the left components part

61
00:04:28,110 --> 00:04:31,470
and this will be the right components part here

62
00:04:32,470 --> 00:04:32,880
Okay

63
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:38,960
And then we actually also have to copy the lighting and the description of the button

64
00:04:39,960 --> 00:04:43,010
So look at the ellipse here

65
00:04:43,020 --> 00:04:46,560
So maybe I can just also rename this one here

66
00:04:47,270 --> 00:04:50,050
So light ellipse

67
00:04:52,640 --> 00:04:54,040
And then duplicate it

68
00:04:54,350 --> 00:04:58,320
And also bring this one here to the left side

69
00:05:00,010 --> 00:05:02,600
Look that it's aligned here in the center

70
00:05:04,060 --> 00:05:05,330
So for this alignment

71
00:05:05,480 --> 00:05:06,980
this should actually fit

72
00:05:07,930 --> 00:05:12,640
And then we only have to also duplicate the text here

73
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:22,120
So maybe just duplicate this here and bring it here on the left side

74
00:05:22,650 --> 00:05:25,270
And here the text is actually down below of the button

75
00:05:26,980 --> 00:05:28,730
Move this one down

76
00:05:29,260 --> 00:05:31,770
So like here

77
00:05:31,790 --> 00:05:33,690
And for the description

78
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:36,200
you can look at the screenshot here

79
00:05:36,200 --> 00:05:38,650
it's called Spd Mach

80
00:05:42,760 --> 00:05:46,710
So let's just change the content here of the button

81
00:05:48,060 --> 00:05:51,610
so to Spd and Mach

82
00:05:56,480 --> 00:05:57,180
All right

83
00:05:57,700 --> 00:05:58,560
this looks good for now

84
00:06:00,700 --> 00:06:01,680
And again

85
00:06:01,690 --> 00:06:05,640
because we were working now on the left component side here

86
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:15,760
we will actually also bring this one here out of the commit component group as well as the light ellipse here

87
00:06:19,170 --> 00:06:19,860
All right

88
00:06:20,140 --> 00:06:23,310
this should be fine for now

89
00:06:23,950 --> 00:06:25,000
And actually

90
00:06:25,100 --> 00:06:29,490
now I can group all of those things here up

91
00:06:29,740 --> 00:06:31,480
So hit command and G

92
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:32,520
oh no

93
00:06:32,530 --> 00:06:33,170
not like that

94
00:06:34,490 --> 00:06:36,800
So make sure everything is selected

95
00:06:39,700 --> 00:06:40,250
Like that

96
00:06:40,290 --> 00:06:42,340
And then hit command in G

97
00:06:42,980 --> 00:06:49,080
and now I will rename it here to the it was the name of the okay

98
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:52,880
so two left components

99
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:56,390
All right

100
00:06:57,300 --> 00:06:59,880
soand then if we look at the screenshot again

101
00:07:00,410 --> 00:07:03,400
we will actually create this button now

102
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:05,230
And to do so

103
00:07:06,290 --> 00:07:08,030
we can just again

104
00:07:08,200 --> 00:07:11,030
copy one of the existing buttons

105
00:07:12,330 --> 00:07:13,690
maybe like this one

106
00:07:14,320 --> 00:07:15,720
hit command and D

107
00:07:16,680 --> 00:07:18,280
so you duplicated it

108
00:07:18,660 --> 00:07:21,380
and then you can just drag it here on the left side

109
00:07:23,900 --> 00:07:24,940
So for the alignment this

110
00:07:27,220 --> 00:07:33,290
Should fit now and then bring this one a little bit down

111
00:07:33,290 --> 00:07:37,040
So maybe you see they are not really in alignment here

112
00:07:38,480 --> 00:07:41,160
just maybe a little bit more down here

113
00:07:43,040 --> 00:07:44,260
And for the description

114
00:07:44,690 --> 00:07:46,030
it's called Loc

115
00:07:48,810 --> 00:07:51,360
So I will also quickly change it

116
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:54,450
and I will see

117
00:07:55,300 --> 00:07:56,490
And then again

118
00:07:57,220 --> 00:08:03,990
we will drag this push button here out of the mid components group inside of the left components group

119
00:08:05,380 --> 00:08:10,040
And then we actually also have to change the height here of the button

120
00:08:10,370 --> 00:08:11,330
And to do so

121
00:08:11,340 --> 00:08:13,990
let's just go inside of the group here

122
00:08:15,290 --> 00:08:24,150
And then we will actually reduce the y value here for everything

123
00:08:24,640 --> 00:08:26,590
So for this 1 -2

124
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:32,890
And this is fine now

125
00:08:34,160 --> 00:08:43,230
And maybe also bring this one down here and the button text a little bit up

126
00:08:44,660 --> 00:08:46,290
So maybe like that

127
00:08:47,690 --> 00:08:51,910
So you actually see that this gap is much more Tanier than this one

128
00:08:51,910 --> 00:08:54,380
So this is actually fine for now

129
00:08:54,870 --> 00:08:56,010
Maybe later on

130
00:08:56,010 --> 00:09:05,070
we can just maybe reduce the size here of the green highlighted a little bit because I think it's actually a little bit too big

131
00:09:05,400 --> 00:09:07,050
but we will keep it for now

132
00:09:08,490 --> 00:09:12,130
And then we actually just resize the whole button here

133
00:09:12,840 --> 00:09:17,310
And so we can also bring this down again here

134
00:09:18,970 --> 00:09:20,460
maybe to this position

135
00:09:21,070 --> 00:09:25,350
So now we actually just created those two elements here

136
00:09:26,380 --> 00:09:29,240
and then we can keep on going with the rest here

137
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:37,080
So

138
00:09:37,080 --> 00:09:40,970
and now we can actually just keep on going with the regulator

139
00:09:40,970 --> 00:09:44,790
So I will just show you this one in the YouTube video

140
00:09:45,220 --> 00:09:49,630
So we have kind of like four different regulators

141
00:09:50,140 --> 00:09:53,160
We will just start now with this one here

142
00:09:53,160 --> 00:09:59,950
So this is a quite a small one and we will actually make use of the star shape

143
00:10:00,010 --> 00:10:01,310
So maybe if you count here

144
00:10:01,310 --> 00:10:02,030
we have 1

145
00:10:02,040 --> 00:10:02,900
23

146
00:10:02,900 --> 00:10:03,800
45

147
00:10:03,800 --> 00:10:05,970
So maybe in summary

148
00:10:05,970 --> 00:10:08,760
now we have like 9 edges here

149
00:10:09,740 --> 00:10:11,970
So if I head back over to spline here

150
00:10:11,970 --> 00:10:12,780
for instance

151
00:10:13,390 --> 00:10:23,380
I will choose the star tool here from the top toolbar and place it here on the body and now here on the right side in the shape menu

152
00:10:23,380 --> 00:10:25,330
I have the option sides

153
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:31,240
And this 1 I would set to 9 as we counted in the video

154
00:10:31,860 --> 00:10:36,830
and actually also increases inner side value

155
00:10:38,990 --> 00:10:40,210
And overall

156
00:10:40,210 --> 00:10:43,560
we also have to change the size here

157
00:10:43,560 --> 00:10:47,480
So maybe like 15 for now

158
00:10:48,980 --> 00:10:53,140
And then also give it some bevel here

159
00:10:53,350 --> 00:10:54,190
Oh no

160
00:10:54,200 --> 00:10:55,180
sorrynot bevel

161
00:10:55,180 --> 00:10:56,740
but corners here

162
00:10:57,170 --> 00:10:58,310
So like that

163
00:11:00,040 --> 00:11:01,530
So if you look again in the video

164
00:11:01,540 --> 00:11:04,780
you see that it's kind of rounded here

165
00:11:04,780 --> 00:11:05,860
so like this one

166
00:11:07,230 --> 00:11:09,850
And now maybe as a comparison

167
00:11:09,850 --> 00:11:14,790
I can actually just just drag it here to the image

168
00:11:15,280 --> 00:11:18,290
give it a little recolor here

169
00:11:19,940 --> 00:11:24,170
And then if I move it here above of the regulator

170
00:11:24,250 --> 00:11:28,290
you now see actually that the size actually fits quite good

171
00:11:28,790 --> 00:11:38,890
So now I can actually just bring this one down here again and just change the color again to a white so we see it better

172
00:11:41,510 --> 00:11:44,920
And then bring this one a little bit down here

173
00:11:44,920 --> 00:11:47,050
So as you see in the reference image

174
00:11:48,310 --> 00:11:51,040
maybe something like here

175
00:11:51,540 --> 00:11:52,000
Alright

176
00:11:52,660 --> 00:11:54,040
and then of course

177
00:11:54,040 --> 00:11:57,070
we just have a two dimensional shape now here

178
00:11:57,070 --> 00:11:59,150
So we have to give it some extrusion

179
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:00,990
So for the extrusion

180
00:12:00,990 --> 00:12:03,240
take a value of 4 maybe

181
00:12:05,390 --> 00:12:08,330
So if you just give it a little twist here

182
00:12:08,370 --> 00:12:13,950
you can maybe just recolor it a little bit here so you see it better

183
00:12:15,150 --> 00:12:22,140
So this is actually quite good if you compare both of the extrusions here

184
00:12:23,110 --> 00:12:27,580
But then we can actually also give it some bevel maybe

185
00:12:28,310 --> 00:12:30,650
so just a little value

186
00:12:30,650 --> 00:12:34,140
so maybe like a small value

187
00:12:34,140 --> 00:12:35,900
maybe like 0．5

188
00:12:38,220 --> 00:12:39,360
Yeahthis looks good

189
00:12:42,740 --> 00:12:43,340
All right

190
00:12:48,220 --> 00:12:48,700
Okay

191
00:12:48,930 --> 00:12:54,070
and then we will actually just build it from here now and then rotate it afterwards

192
00:12:54,080 --> 00:12:59,220
because otherwise we will have to bring those other elements now behind

193
00:12:59,220 --> 00:13:02,700
So we will actually just rotate the whole group afterwards

194
00:13:04,550 --> 00:13:10,100
So we can just start over with this cone element here

195
00:13:10,960 --> 00:13:15,440
So you see that actually we have now the star element in front

196
00:13:15,710 --> 00:13:17,580
Then we have a little cone here

197
00:13:17,590 --> 00:13:21,060
and then it's connected to a base plate here

198
00:13:22,310 --> 00:13:26,700
Sobut we will actually don't use the cone tool now

199
00:13:26,700 --> 00:13:29,460
we will use the cylinder run

200
00:13:29,940 --> 00:13:39,060
So choose cylinder here from the top toolbar and then place it here onto the star

201
00:13:41,410 --> 00:13:45,140
AgainI will just quickly give it another color

202
00:13:47,510 --> 00:13:54,200
And then make sure that it's actually aligned here to the center as good as you can

203
00:13:56,320 --> 00:13:56,800
Alright

204
00:13:57,360 --> 00:13:58,770
so for the size

205
00:13:58,770 --> 00:14:01,260
we can actually maybe go

206
00:14:02,670 --> 00:14:03,780
yeahlike 7

207
00:14:07,400 --> 00:14:08,770
So like that

208
00:14:10,380 --> 00:14:11,880
So a little bit down here

209
00:14:14,020 --> 00:14:16,630
And then if we rotate it real quick

210
00:14:19,060 --> 00:14:21,750
We see now that it's basically a sphere

211
00:14:21,750 --> 00:14:22,100
Right now

212
00:14:22,710 --> 00:14:28,140
We actually have to reduce the corners h​‌​‌​​‌‌​​‌‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌​​‌‌​‌‌‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌​​‌‌​‌​‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌​‌​‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌​‌‌​​​‌‌‌‌‌‌​​‌‌‌​‌‌​​‌‌​‌​‌​​‌‌‌​‌‌​​‌‌​​​‌​​‌‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌‌​​‌​​‌‌‌​​‌​​‌‌​​​‌​​‌‌‌‌‌‌​​‌‌​‌​‌​​‌‌​‌​‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌‌‌‌​​​‌‌‌​‌‌​​‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌​​‌‌​‌‌​​​‌‌​‌‌​​​‌‌​​‌‌​​‌‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌​‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌​​​‌‌‌​​‌​​‌‌​‌‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌​‌‌‌‌‌​‌​‌‌​​​‌‌‌‌‌‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌‌​​‌‌‌​‌​‌‌‌​​‌‌​‌‌​​​‌‌‌​​‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌​​​‌‌‌‌‌​​​‌‌​​​‌​​‌‌​​‌‌​​‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌​‌‌‌​​‌‌‌‌‌​​​‌‌​‌‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌​‌‌​​‌‌​‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌​​​‌‌​‌​‌​​‌‌​‌‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌​‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌​‌‌​​​‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌​​​‌​​‌‌​‌​‌‌‌​‌​​​‌​​‌‌​‌‌‌‌‌​‌​‌​‌​​‌‌​‌​‌​​‌‌​‌​‌‌‌​‌‌​​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌‌​​‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌​​‌‌‌​​‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌​‌‌‌​​‌‌‌​​‌‌‌​‌​‌‌‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌​​‌​​‌‌​‌​‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌​‌‌​​‌‌​​‌‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌​‌​‌‌‌​‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌‌​​‌​​‌‌​‌‌‌​​‌‌‌​​‌​​‌‌‌‌‌‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌​‌‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌​​​‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌​​‌​​‌‌​‌​‌‌‌​‌​‌‌‌​​‌‌​‌‌​​​‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌​‌‌‌​​‌‌‌‌‌​​​‌‌​‌​‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌‌​​‌‌‌​‌​‌‌‌‌‌​‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌‌​​‌‌‌‌‌‌​​‌‌​‌‌‌​​‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌‌​​‌​​‌‌​​‌‌​​‌‌‌​​‌​​‌‌‌​​‌​​‌‌​‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌ere and also the corner sides

213
00:14:29,630 --> 00:14:33,040
And then for this cone geometry

214
00:14:33,480 --> 00:14:38,010
we will actually have to reduce the bottom value here

215
00:14:38,010 --> 00:14:42,140
So you see now the top 1 is 2 and the bottom 1 is 2

216
00:14:42,670 --> 00:14:43,090
Oh no

217
00:14:43,100 --> 00:14:43,380
okay

218
00:14:43,380 --> 00:14:46,120
We have to actually do it in

219
00:14:47,900 --> 00:14:48,510
in reverse

220
00:14:48,510 --> 00:14:50,980
So we actually have to reduce the top value here

221
00:14:50,990 --> 00:14:52,580
So maybe like that

222
00:14:54,300 --> 00:14:59,020
And now you actually see this kind of like cone geometry

223
00:15:02,310 --> 00:15:05,120
So this actually already looks quite good

224
00:15:05,800 --> 00:15:10,830
And then this one is actually just connect it to the base plate here

225
00:15:10,840 --> 00:15:14,380
So we can just maybe choose the Ellipse tool

226
00:15:17,520 --> 00:15:19,370
Move it to the center here

227
00:15:21,430 --> 00:15:28,980
Give it some little extrusions or maybe 0．25 and increase the size here too

228
00:15:28,980 --> 00:15:32,650
Maybe something like 10

229
00:15:32,660 --> 00:15:33,780
for instance

230
00:15:35,500 --> 00:15:36,610
Yeahlike that

231
00:15:38,060 --> 00:15:40,700
And then connect it here to the cone

232
00:15:46,280 --> 00:15:46,630
So

233
00:15:46,630 --> 00:15:52,510
and then we actually have just the basic shaping of the first regulator here

234
00:15:52,760 --> 00:15:57,600
So I will just quickly group all of the elements up here

235
00:15:57,640 --> 00:15:59,260
So select all of them

236
00:16:00,060 --> 00:16:01,590
hit command and G

237
00:16:02,570 --> 00:16:04,920
and then rename it

238
00:16:05,150 --> 00:16:08,800
I will just Rema to regulator small

239
00:16:12,820 --> 00:16:13,010
All right

240
00:16:14,400 --> 00:16:15,580
so good for now

241
00:16:16,340 --> 00:16:17,400
And actually

242
00:16:17,400 --> 00:16:22,110
just now we can rotate it real quick

243
00:16:22,130 --> 00:16:25,160
can also do it from the top right side here

244
00:16:25,160 --> 00:16:28,340
So give it a twist of 180 degrees

245
00:16:29,610 --> 00:16:30,370
So like that

246
00:16:34,170 --> 00:16:34,910
And then

247
00:16:39,380 --> 00:16:47,040
Maybe you may actually see that the star element is a little bit tiny

248
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:47,870
I guess

249
00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:50,340
or smaller than the base plate

250
00:16:50,510 --> 00:16:55,310
We will actually maybe change this one real quick

251
00:16:57,020 --> 00:16:58,510
So for the ellipse now

252
00:17:01,630 --> 00:17:04,680
I will actually choose a value of a bigger value

253
00:17:04,680 --> 00:17:05,900
So maybe like 12

254
00:17:08,200 --> 00:17:09,560
Yeahmaybe like that

255
00:17:09,910 --> 00:17:14,030
And now you see just a little bit the base plate here

256
00:17:14,650 --> 00:17:18,750
So this is kind of more like realistic to the reference image

257
00:17:20,330 --> 00:17:21,490
So maybe like that

258
00:17:24,820 --> 00:17:25,260
All right

259
00:17:26,900 --> 00:17:30,880
and then we also have this light ring here

260
00:17:32,020 --> 00:17:33,500
It also needs to be done

261
00:17:33,860 --> 00:17:35,130
And for the lighting

262
00:17:35,130 --> 00:17:38,140
I actually can just copy it from here

263
00:17:38,140 --> 00:17:39,290
So from the left

264
00:17:39,570 --> 00:17:40,800
no button here

265
00:17:40,820 --> 00:17:42,930
so just hit command and D

266
00:17:43,590 --> 00:17:54,590
duplicate it and then bring it inside of the small regulator group and then bring it here on the right side

267
00:17:56,740 --> 00:17:58,960
And for the size we

268
00:17:59,250 --> 00:18:02,410
I think we choose the value of 15

269
00:18:02,420 --> 00:18:06,580
So we make it maybe a little bit bigger here

270
00:18:06,580 --> 00:18:10,040
So maybe like 17

271
00:18:15,070 --> 00:18:16,630
Bring this one down here and

272
00:18:19,220 --> 00:18:20,060
Like that

273
00:18:25,610 --> 00:18:27,170
Just zoom in a little bit

274
00:18:29,630 --> 00:18:31,870
Maybe I don't know if the gap is actually too big

275
00:18:32,180 --> 00:18:33,420
Yeahmaybe a little bit

276
00:18:35,470 --> 00:18:38,930
So maybe we go with 16 here

277
00:18:40,750 --> 00:18:41,230
So yeah

278
00:18:41,420 --> 00:18:42,370
this is better

279
00:18:42,380 --> 00:18:43,210
I think

280
00:18:45,140 --> 00:18:46,980
And line it here real quick

281
00:18:47,050 --> 00:18:52,420
And now we also have to maybe reduce the border width here a little bit

282
00:18:52,420 --> 00:18:57,420
So I will actually have to increase the ring value to get a smaller border width

283
00:19:00,010 --> 00:19:01,020
Maybe like that

284
00:19:02,610 --> 00:19:03,600
But then again

285
00:19:03,610 --> 00:19:06,520
the gap is actually just increased by that

286
00:19:06,600 --> 00:19:06,900
The way

287
00:19:06,900 --> 00:19:12,750
we have to actually resize again

288
00:19:12,750 --> 00:19:18,520
So maybe choose 15 and now it should be fine

289
00:19:19,860 --> 00:19:21,860
So now if you compare both of them

290
00:19:22,460 --> 00:19:24,890
this actually looks quite good

291
00:19:25,480 --> 00:19:30,360
So now we will actually start to create the material of the regulators

292
00:19:30,380 --> 00:19:33,430
So if you look at the reference image

293
00:19:33,920 --> 00:19:36,920
you see that all of the regulators have a kind of light

294
00:19:37,050 --> 00:19:38,200
light gray color

295
00:19:38,870 --> 00:19:41,450
And to achieve this kind of color

296
00:19:41,580 --> 00:19:44,640
you maybe just select the star module here

297
00:19:45,240 --> 00:19:48,220
And then we will head over to our material panel

298
00:19:49,420 --> 00:19:50,520
And the first thing

299
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:56,070
the first thing we are going to do actually bring this lighting layer down

300
00:19:56,070 --> 00:19:57,820
So it's the first one here

301
00:19:58,410 --> 00:20:01,020
And just for the properties here

302
00:20:01,020 --> 00:20:02,590
you can just leave it as it is

303
00:20:02,600 --> 00:20:06,300
So type form and the base color and the shininess of five

304
00:20:07,260 --> 00:20:08,600
And for the color here

305
00:20:08,600 --> 00:20:11,660
we will use this color code

306
00:20:11,670 --> 00:20:12,990
So in hex

307
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:17,360
it's actually 7 C 8 2 8 1

308
00:20:17,880 --> 00:20:19,470
and for the RGB code

309
00:20:19,470 --> 00:20:21,800
you can just copy that from here

310
00:20:22,680 --> 00:20:23,430
And here

311
00:20:23,880 --> 00:20:25,030
We just leave it as it is

312
00:20:25,030 --> 00:20:27,350
So no blending mode or something else

313
00:20:28,660 --> 00:20:32,750
And then we will introduce a third layer

314
00:20:32,840 --> 00:20:35,650
and this one will be a Fresnel layer

315
00:20:36,810 --> 00:20:38,230
And here for the Fresno

316
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:41,560
we will choose a simple black color

317
00:20:42,890 --> 00:20:43,900
And for the bias

318
00:20:43,900 --> 00:20:48,360
you can actually just change it to something like 0．14

319
00:20:50,140 --> 00:20:51,750
And for the blending mode

320
00:20:51,760 --> 00:20:53,250
we will choose Overlay

321
00:20:55,580 --> 00:20:57,310
And now we will add another layer

322
00:20:57,720 --> 00:21:00,600
And this one will be a matte cap

323
00:21:01,570 --> 00:21:02,660
And for the matte cap

324
00:21:02,670 --> 00:21:06,260
we will choose the blurry one from the spline library

325
00:21:08,130 --> 00:21:11,760
And here we will actually choose the blending mode screen

326
00:21:13,280 --> 00:21:14,620
And now last layer

327
00:21:14,660 --> 00:21:16,210
And this one will be

328
00:21:16,220 --> 00:21:19,920
againjust simple color layer here

329
00:21:20,460 --> 00:21:21,320
And for the color

330
00:21:21,320 --> 00:21:24,380
we will actually choose this one here

331
00:21:25,190 --> 00:21:26,200
So in hex

332
00:21:26,200 --> 00:21:29,450
it's called 6 a 60

333
00:21:29,460 --> 00:21:30,420
60

334
00:21:31,210 --> 00:21:33,030
And for the RGB code

335
00:21:33,030 --> 00:21:35,580
you can just simply copy that from here

336
00:21:36,020 --> 00:21:37,910
And here we actually again

337
00:21:37,920 --> 00:21:46,690
use the blending mode overlay and maybe reduce per ad to something like 75

338
00:21:48,100 --> 00:21:49,860
And now you have a like

339
00:21:50,220 --> 00:21:52,980
nice little light gray material here

340
00:21:53,100 --> 00:21:59,370
And maybe we will actually just add this material to our own library

341
00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:06,260
So just click on the four dots here and then create a new material library

342
00:22:07,400 --> 00:22:14,870
And here we will actually call it gray regulators and hit enter here

343
00:22:16,910 --> 00:22:25,530
Soand now you can actually just go ahead and places material on the rest of the regulator

344
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:29,650
Maybe you like on the ellipse

345
00:22:29,840 --> 00:22:34,850
you can just choose a material here and same for the cylinder

346
00:22:36,730 --> 00:22:38,360
Or you can just select all of them

347
00:22:40,360 --> 00:22:44,560
So now you have a little nice gray color here

348
00:22:45,890 --> 00:22:46,250
So

349
00:22:46,250 --> 00:22:49,040
and then if you look at the reference image

350
00:22:49,070 --> 00:22:56,140
actuallyyou will see that the regulator has a kind of like triangle on it

351
00:22:56,140 --> 00:22:57,950
So if I zoom in a little bit

352
00:22:57,960 --> 00:23:00,770
you maybe just barely it here

353
00:23:00,780 --> 00:23:03,990
but here's a little triangle on top of the regulator

354
00:23:04,340 --> 00:23:07,150
And to also visualize this

355
00:23:07,150 --> 00:23:09,020
we will just simply use

356
00:23:09,500 --> 00:23:11,680
simply use a triangle function here

357
00:23:11,900 --> 00:23:19,270
So choose triangle from the top two bar and then place it to the regulator

358
00:23:20,530 --> 00:23:22,320
And for the scale

359
00:23:22,380 --> 00:23:24,180
I will actually increase it

360
00:23:24,190 --> 00:23:27,580
So I will not actually use the size function here

361
00:23:27,990 --> 00:23:30,630
but the scale one here to actually just

362
00:23:31,240 --> 00:23:32,650
yeahscale it evenly

363
00:23:32,650 --> 00:23:37,310
And so I don't have to actually use some floating numbers here

364
00:23:37,320 --> 00:23:39,470
So I will actually maybe

365
00:23:40,640 --> 00:23:42,050
maybe even more

366
00:23:42,490 --> 00:23:44,600
maybe to something like 1．8

367
00:23:46,250 --> 00:23:51,410
So 1．8 in x and 1．8 in here

368
00:23:52,340 --> 00:23:54,380
And then give it a little twist here

369
00:23:54,470 --> 00:23:59,320
So 90 degrees can also just type it in here

370
00:24:00,600 --> 00:24:03,620
And then just quickly align the triangle

371
00:24:05,890 --> 00:24:06,890
So like that

372
00:24:10,100 --> 00:24:13,180
And then I will actually duplicate this layer

373
00:24:13,320 --> 00:24:15,280
So now we have a triangle 2 here

374
00:24:15,690 --> 00:24:16,830
And for this triangle

375
00:24:16,830 --> 00:24:22,900
I will actually reduce scaling factor to something like 1．6

376
00:24:24,710 --> 00:24:28,480
And then I will select both of the triangles again

377
00:24:28,920 --> 00:24:30,690
give them a little bit of extrusion

378
00:24:31,480 --> 00:24:34,520
so maybe something like 0．2

379
00:24:35,020 --> 00:24:36,560
And then when again

380
00:24:36,570 --> 00:24:38,380
both of the triangles are selected

381
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:41,370
I will actually use a Boolean modifier tab

382
00:24:42,500 --> 00:24:49,250
And now you see that it's not quite evenly spread it around

383
00:24:49,890 --> 00:24:52,650
So just select the triangle 2

384
00:24:52,650 --> 00:24:56,120
and then you can move it a little bit here to the center

385
00:24:58,430 --> 00:25:04,990
So if it has the same border width on all sides

386
00:25:05,640 --> 00:25:08,530
and maybe if you want to make this line a little bit bigger

387
00:25:08,530 --> 00:25:11,000
you can play around with the scaling factor here

388
00:25:11,390 --> 00:25:12,230
So for example

389
00:25:14,110 --> 00:25:18,260
maybe I can choose 1．9 here or for the first triangle

390
00:25:21,440 --> 00:25:25,080
And then your border width actually is exceeded

391
00:25:26,540 --> 00:25:29,410
So I think this looks quite good

392
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:35,120
And then maybe we can just change the material real quick

393
00:25:35,510 --> 00:25:47,790
So maybe I will just drag it to the black here instead and maybe reduce the opacity to something like 80 or maybe even more

394
00:25:48,630 --> 00:25:49,960
let's say 60

395
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:53,860
And actually

396
00:25:54,130 --> 00:25:57,520
we will do some fine adjustments here

397
00:25:57,520 --> 00:25:58,290
So again

398
00:25:59,150 --> 00:26:01,150
I will just move it a little bit in the center

399
00:26:01,150 --> 00:26:06,610
So it's it has an even border width

400
00:26:07,510 --> 00:26:10,690
And so if you look now at the reference image

401
00:26:10,770 --> 00:26:14,810
this shape is just rebuilt here in spline

402
00:26:15,220 --> 00:26:15,950
okay

403
00:26:17,980 --> 00:26:21,850
And maybe some more fine adjustments here

404
00:26:21,870 --> 00:26:30,280
I actually think we should do a little less of of the star sides here

405
00:26:30,280 --> 00:26:39,200
So I will actually red use here the sides to maybe 7 or maybe like 8

406
00:26:39,330 --> 00:26:41,200
YeahI think 8 is fine

407
00:26:43,880 --> 00:26:44,870
All right

408
00:26:45,440 --> 00:26:48,280
so this is the first regulator here

409
00:26:48,940 --> 00:26:53,650
Maybe we can even just increase the base plate here a little

410
00:26:56,280 --> 00:26:58,390
Bit choose this ellipse here

411
00:26:58,390 --> 00:26:59,290
So the base plate

412
00:26:59,300 --> 00:27:05,740
and actually I will make it like 0．5 maybe

413
00:27:07,750 --> 00:27:08,300
And actually

414
00:27:08,300 --> 00:27:11,320
we could also give it a little bit of bevel here

415
00:27:12,180 --> 00:27:16,120
Also increase the bevel sides and now

416
00:27:18,360 --> 00:27:22,370
We have a nice rounded base plate here

417
00:27:22,820 --> 00:27:23,390
All right

418
00:27:25,180 --> 00:27:28,110
and this is it basically for the first regulator

419
00:27:28,850 --> 00:27:32,440
So we will just continue with the second one here

420
00:27:32,440 --> 00:27:34,210
So this one on the left side

421
00:27:34,830 --> 00:27:37,300
so basically it has the same

422
00:27:38,850 --> 00:27:40,810
same size kind of

423
00:27:40,820 --> 00:27:44,130
but it has some more star sites here

424
00:27:44,600 --> 00:27:50,250
So we can actually just copy our first regulator

425
00:27:50,490 --> 00:27:55,320
And maybe I will just drag this one in the group here for now

426
00:27:56,430 --> 00:27:59,720
And what I actually forgot to check is the alignment

427
00:28:00,670 --> 00:28:02,790
So again

428
00:28:02,790 --> 00:28:06,640
make sure that everything is kind of like connected to each other

429
00:28:06,800 --> 00:28:08,580
So I will ring this

430
00:28:09,460 --> 00:28:15,610
I will rename it to triangle here to the regulator

431
00:28:17,250 --> 00:28:21,400
Soand then we can actually just copy the whole thing here

432
00:28:21,650 --> 00:28:25,010
Sobut maybe for clarification

433
00:28:25,010 --> 00:28:27,350
I will just start to rename everything here

434
00:28:27,350 --> 00:28:28,460
So this is like the

435
00:28:30,330 --> 00:28:33,360
I will just call it star sides here

436
00:28:34,890 --> 00:28:36,480
the cylinders actually

437
00:28:39,290 --> 00:28:47,840
Rename the cylinder and maybe to like cone and the ellipse

438
00:28:47,840 --> 00:28:50,350
I will just rename to base plate

439
00:28:52,180 --> 00:28:55,320
And the light ellipse is just quite good as it is

440
00:28:56,350 --> 00:28:59,760
And so now we can actually just duplicate this whole thing

441
00:28:59,760 --> 00:29:01,400
So hit C and D

442
00:29:01,980 --> 00:29:04,940
and then move this thing here to the left

443
00:29:05,770 --> 00:29:06,900
And for the alignment

444
00:29:06,920 --> 00:29:07,460
I will again

445
00:29:07,460 --> 00:29:10,620
to make sure that it's aligned

446
00:29:10,970 --> 00:29:12,640
kind of like with the screenshot

447
00:29:14,720 --> 00:29:15,980
So maybe like that

448
00:29:18,890 --> 00:29:24,480
And here you may see that we don't have a triangle here

449
00:29:24,480 --> 00:29:30,420
So I will just delete it from the second regulator

450
00:29:33,030 --> 00:29:34,580
And then we have lot

451
00:29:34,830 --> 00:29:36,050
a lot more sides here

452
00:29:36,270 --> 00:29:42,440
So just click on the star sides shape here

453
00:29:42,440 --> 00:29:47,560
And then we will just increase it something like this

454
00:29:48,200 --> 00:29:55,910
And I will actually also increase the inner one here real quick just a bit

455
00:30:01,690 --> 00:30:05,780
I don't know how much we maybe do like 20

456
00:30:07,780 --> 00:30:09,320
We can achieve that

457
00:30:14,220 --> 00:30:14,730
So again

458
00:30:14,730 --> 00:30:16,140
this is a little bit of fine

459
00:30:16,140 --> 00:30:18,340
just finer trusting here

460
00:30:22,440 --> 00:30:23,230
All right

461
00:30:26,580 --> 00:30:27,010
So yeah

462
00:30:27,020 --> 00:30:28,000
maybe like that

463
00:30:30,780 --> 00:30:32,330
And for this one

464
00:30:32,980 --> 00:30:35,100
we actually saw it in the video

465
00:30:35,100 --> 00:30:39,870
So it doesn't have a kind of like cone shaft

466
00:30:39,870 --> 00:30:43,800
So I will try to actually find it here on the video

467
00:30:43,810 --> 00:30:44,460
So this

468
00:30:44,470 --> 00:30:49,680
this one is actually much longer and doesn't have a kind of like cone connect

469
00:30:52,030 --> 00:30:54,600
So we will actually get rid of that

470
00:30:57,010 --> 00:31:03,890
So we maybe just you make the top and bottom actually even

471
00:31:06,100 --> 00:31:07,530
So maybe like that

472
00:31:08,910 --> 00:31:12,080
maybe also just decrease it here too

473
00:31:13,050 --> 00:31:13,680
I know this one

474
00:31:13,830 --> 00:31:16,690
not this one to 5

475
00:31:19,410 --> 00:31:20,730
And actually

476
00:31:22,740 --> 00:31:24,690
We have to make the shaft longer

477
00:31:26,240 --> 00:31:30,240
So I will move it a little bit to the front here

478
00:31:31,780 --> 00:31:36,680
And I will just exceed the size of the cone here so it fits

479
00:31:40,890 --> 00:31:42,280
So the whole thing

480
00:31:45,010 --> 00:31:47,380
And then move it inside of the regulator

481
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:49,580
So now everything is connected

482
00:31:52,760 --> 00:31:57,880
And I think this actually looks quite good for now

483
00:32:00,040 --> 00:32:00,680
And

484
00:32:03,150 --> 00:32:05,620
Yeahthat's basically it for the left side now

485
00:32:05,700 --> 00:32:07,100
So maybe this

486
00:32:07,350 --> 00:32:09,620
you just have this little screw here

487
00:32:09,770 --> 00:32:12,820
but we will maybe just make it in the end here

488
00:32:12,890 --> 00:32:16,340
So let's just continue with the right side here

489
00:32:17,300 --> 00:32:20,680
Just finished the left side here so

490
00:32:22,740 --> 00:32:23,210
I will

491
00:32:23,220 --> 00:32:24,000
actually

492
00:32:26,100 --> 00:32:28,040
Just move the regulators here again

493
00:32:28,050 --> 00:32:30,330
inside of the left components group

494
00:32:31,510 --> 00:32:34,640
So everything is just grouped up

495
00:32:34,770 --> 00:32:40,860
And now we actually have like four big components

496
00:32:40,900 --> 00:32:43,080
So the first one is the FCU

497
00:32:43,090 --> 00:32:44,420
then we have the display

498
00:32:44,950 --> 00:32:47,300
the mid components and the left components

499
00:32:48,670 --> 00:32:49,140
All right

500
00:32:49,150 --> 00:32:52,500
and then we will just start with the right component side here
