1
00:00:00,200 --> 00:00:00,600
So

2
00:00:00,600 --> 00:00:01,930
and now for the right side

3
00:00:02,200 --> 00:00:05,040
this should be actually quite easy

4
00:00:05,180 --> 00:00:08,810
So maybe we take a look at the reference image again

5
00:00:09,250 --> 00:00:10,460
So for the right here

6
00:00:10,460 --> 00:00:15,220
we can actually just make use of components we already created

7
00:00:15,230 --> 00:00:16,520
So for example

8
00:00:16,740 --> 00:00:23,720
we just got this regulator here also on this side and this button here on this side

9
00:00:24,230 --> 00:00:26,790
and also this button here

10
00:00:27,640 --> 00:00:29,510
And for this one

11
00:00:29,700 --> 00:00:32,520
we can also use this button here actually

12
00:00:32,530 --> 00:00:36,070
and just change the color here of the front

13
00:00:36,470 --> 00:00:38,060
And for this regulator

14
00:00:38,060 --> 00:00:40,520
we have to do some tiny adjustments

15
00:00:40,520 --> 00:00:44,990
but it should also be just done quite fast

16
00:00:45,450 --> 00:00:52,130
So let's just start over here with maybe the regulators

17
00:00:52,280 --> 00:00:52,980
I think

18
00:00:53,040 --> 00:00:56,620
So I will actually just copy this one

19
00:00:58,150 --> 00:01:02,740
So duplicate it here and bring it out of the left components group

20
00:01:04,900 --> 00:01:06,390
And then move it here to the side

21
00:01:07,440 --> 00:01:10,210
So maybe like here

22
00:01:14,130 --> 00:01:15,730
Yesmaybe like here

23
00:01:16,120 --> 00:01:21,110
So actually you see maybe that this gap is actually tinier than this one

24
00:01:21,110 --> 00:01:23,510
So it doesn't have to be symmetrical

25
00:01:24,050 --> 00:01:29,050
So bring this one here more to the middle

26
00:01:30,020 --> 00:01:34,280
and then I will actually also just duplicate this regulator

27
00:01:35,930 --> 00:01:37,980
bring it out of the left components group

28
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:49,560
and then bring it here to the right side and just barely align it that it fits to the screenshot here

29
00:01:51,800 --> 00:01:52,420
All right

30
00:01:53,920 --> 00:02:01,300
then we can maybe just also duplicate this button here

31
00:02:02,500 --> 00:02:07,410
So we actually have to make sure that the light ellipse is also getting copied

32
00:02:08,920 --> 00:02:14,840
So maybe we will actually just drag this light ellipse here inside of the group

33
00:02:14,980 --> 00:02:18,680
or maybe not because it's a Boolean group

34
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:20,660
So we have to keep it out here

35
00:02:21,530 --> 00:02:23,010
Okayso maybe just undo it

36
00:02:24,860 --> 00:02:25,120
Okay

37
00:02:25,130 --> 00:02:27,440
but we would like to just duplicate it now

38
00:02:28,170 --> 00:02:29,020
Then again

39
00:02:29,030 --> 00:02:31,000
bring it out of the left components group

40
00:02:33,410 --> 00:02:35,600
Drag it here to the middle

41
00:02:37,820 --> 00:02:39,400
So maybe like here

42
00:02:40,750 --> 00:02:46,320
And then also just copy the light ellipse and also the text maybe

43
00:02:46,530 --> 00:02:51,230
So select both of it and duplicate

44
00:02:53,630 --> 00:02:57,070
And so which one is actually the duplicated one

45
00:02:57,070 --> 00:02:58,400
I think this one

46
00:02:59,730 --> 00:03:00,410
And again

47
00:03:00,410 --> 00:03:02,420
bring it out of the left components group

48
00:03:04,660 --> 00:03:06,350
Move it here to the side

49
00:03:08,910 --> 00:03:11,590
And then also for the light ellipse

50
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,960
we will also bring it out of the component group

51
00:03:17,170 --> 00:03:18,680
And then here on the right side

52
00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:21,200
And here again

53
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:25,840
make sure that it's an alignment here to the center

54
00:03:28,830 --> 00:03:30,800
And same for the text

55
00:03:30,910 --> 00:03:32,800
So maybe like that

56
00:03:35,610 --> 00:03:36,070
All right

57
00:03:36,070 --> 00:03:37,340
this looks good for now

58
00:03:37,720 --> 00:03:40,870
And maybe we can just change the text now

59
00:03:40,970 --> 00:03:42,940
So for the text

60
00:03:42,940 --> 00:03:45,040
it's actually metric alt

61
00:03:47,850 --> 00:03:50,350
So we will change this one also real quick

62
00:03:51,080 --> 00:03:57,030
So go to the text and then type in metric Alt

63
00:03:59,540 --> 00:03:59,940
All right

64
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:06,330
So now we have three more elements here on the right side

65
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:11,220
And then we just have to copy those buttons here

66
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:12,970
And for this

67
00:04:12,980 --> 00:04:16,200
we will duplicate the Loc button here

68
00:04:16,390 --> 00:04:18,920
So this one push button for

69
00:04:19,930 --> 00:04:20,580
So again

70
00:04:20,580 --> 00:04:22,860
hit command in D and duplicate it

71
00:04:24,230 --> 00:04:25,500
bring it out of the group

72
00:04:26,890 --> 00:04:29,650
and the​‌​‌​​‌‌​​‌‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌​​‌‌​‌‌‌​​‌‌​​‌‌​​‌‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌‌​‌‌​​‌‌​‌​‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌​‌‌​​​‌‌‌‌‌‌​​‌‌‌​‌‌​​‌‌​‌​‌​​‌‌‌​‌‌​​‌‌​​​‌​​‌‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌​‌‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌​​​‌​​‌‌​‌‌‌‌‌​‌​‌​‌​​‌‌​‌​‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌‌‌‌​​​‌‌‌​‌‌​​‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌​​‌‌​‌‌​​​‌‌​‌‌​​​‌‌​​‌‌​​‌‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌​‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌​​​‌‌‌​​‌​​‌‌‌‌‌​​​‌‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌​‌‌​​​‌‌‌‌‌​​​‌‌‌‌‌‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌‌​​‌‌‌​‌​‌‌‌​​‌‌​​‌‌​​‌‌‌‌‌​​​‌‌‌‌‌​​​‌‌​‌​‌‌‌​‌​​​‌​​‌‌​​‌‌​​‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌​‌‌‌​​‌‌‌‌‌​​​‌‌​‌‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌​‌‌​​‌‌​‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌​‌​‌​​‌‌​‌‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌​‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌​‌‌​​​‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌​​‌‌​‌​‌‌‌​‌‌​​‌​​‌‌​‌‌‌‌‌​‌​‌​‌​​‌‌​‌​‌​​‌‌​‌​‌‌‌​‌‌​​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌‌​​‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌​​‌‌‌​​‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌​‌‌‌​​‌‌‌​​‌‌‌​‌​‌‌‌‌‌​‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌​‌​‌‌‌​‌​‌‌‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌​‌‌​​‌‌​​‌‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌​‌​‌‌‌​‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌​​‌‌‌‌‌​​​‌‌‌​​‌​​‌‌‌​‌‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌​‌‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌​​​‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌​​‌​​‌‌​‌​‌‌‌​‌​‌‌‌​​‌‌​‌‌​​​‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌​‌‌‌​​‌‌‌‌‌​​​‌‌​‌​‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌‌​​‌‌‌​‌​‌‌‌‌‌​‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌‌​​‌‌‌‌‌‌​​‌‌​‌‌‌​​‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌‌​​‌​​‌‌​​‌‌​​‌‌‌​​‌​​‌‌‌​​‌​​‌‌​‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌n move it to the right side here

73
00:04:31,540 --> 00:04:32,720
So like that

74
00:04:37,150 --> 00:04:40,740
And then we can actually just duplicate this one again

75
00:04:40,750 --> 00:04:42,140
So we have another push button

76
00:04:43,860 --> 00:04:44,470
And this one

77
00:04:44,470 --> 00:04:49,860
we will just place it here under the first regulator

78
00:04:52,480 --> 00:04:52,800
All right

79
00:04:53,290 --> 00:04:55,520
and for the right button

80
00:04:56,430 --> 00:04:59,020
we will also have to change the text here

81
00:05:00,190 --> 00:05:02,430
It's called APR

82
00:05:04,100 --> 00:05:05,950
So for the text

83
00:05:06,590 --> 00:05:08,070
choose APR

84
00:05:11,980 --> 00:05:16,140
Maybe what I just noticed is that the font is actually a little bit too big

85
00:05:16,140 --> 00:05:22,230
So maybe afterwards we can also just resize the font here a little bit

86
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:24,490
And for this left button

87
00:05:24,840 --> 00:05:28,590
actuallywe can select this one here

88
00:05:29,250 --> 00:05:34,060
delete the green highlight and also the button text here

89
00:05:35,210 --> 00:05:36,340
And for the main button

90
00:05:37,340 --> 00:05:42,460
we can actually just maybe choose the body material here

91
00:05:42,460 --> 00:05:48,060
So click on the four dots and then just hit on the green body

92
00:05:48,840 --> 00:05:50,710
And now we have just simply

93
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:54,160
yeahfinish this button for now

94
00:05:55,830 --> 00:05:57,260
This button also

95
00:05:57,790 --> 00:06:00,500
and we have both of the regulators and the knob button

96
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:02,720
So what's missing now is basically

97
00:06:04,100 --> 00:06:07,720
so if we again step over here to our reference image

98
00:06:08,180 --> 00:06:10,680
we have some more text here

99
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:15,830
So those numbers and this description here

100
00:06:15,830 --> 00:06:17,640
So we will actually also make this

101
00:06:20,170 --> 00:06:21,940
And to do so again

102
00:06:21,940 --> 00:06:25,420
just head over to your spline project

103
00:06:26,860 --> 00:06:32,040
And maybe I can actually just copy this text here

104
00:06:32,050 --> 00:06:38,880
So duplicate this layer and then move it here to the side

105
00:06:39,510 --> 00:06:41,340
And I actually forgot the content here

106
00:06:41,340 --> 00:06:43,140
so we have to take another look

107
00:06:44,730 --> 00:06:48,330
So we have push to level off actually

108
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:49,600
All right

109
00:06:51,290 --> 00:06:52,020
so again

110
00:06:52,400 --> 00:07:01,420
click on the text and type in push to level off

111
00:07:01,890 --> 00:07:02,440
All right

112
00:07:03,890 --> 00:07:07,910
and then just move this thing here in the middle

113
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:11,480
So maybe if we look at the text here

114
00:07:11,480 --> 00:07:16,720
so we can actually move it a little bit more to the left side here

115
00:07:17,430 --> 00:07:18,070
So again

116
00:07:18,070 --> 00:07:22,690
you see that this font is actually a little bit smaller than this one

117
00:07:22,690 --> 00:07:26,310
but we will actually just maybe change it afterwards again

118
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:32,760
But we will leave it as it is now and keep on going with the other descriptions here

119
00:07:33,890 --> 00:07:36,890
So for the numbers

120
00:07:36,900 --> 00:07:39,020
we actually have here 100

121
00:07:39,230 --> 00:07:42,220
or maybe I will show you again in the reference image

122
00:07:42,900 --> 00:07:47,120
So here we have the number 100 and also 1000

123
00:07:50,370 --> 00:07:51,270
You also get this

124
00:07:51,270 --> 00:07:51,940
right

125
00:07:54,790 --> 00:07:59,820
I will maybe just place some little rectangles here on the body

126
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:06,920
So maybe like this for the y component

127
00:08:06,920 --> 00:08:10,400
I think we used a width of 0．5

128
00:08:10,410 --> 00:08:16,880
Maybe I will actually give it some reasonable numbers

129
00:08:16,880 --> 00:08:19,400
So maybe 2 and 0．5

130
00:08:20,570 --> 00:08:28,700
and then also give it here a little twist of -45 degrees

131
00:08:28,710 --> 00:08:28,940
maybe

132
00:08:32,930 --> 00:08:35,270
Maybe I will just move it

133
00:08:35,380 --> 00:08:36,360
So it looks good

134
00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:36,940
actually

135
00:08:39,870 --> 00:08:41,320
So maybe like this

136
00:08:45,660 --> 00:08:46,710
And again

137
00:08:46,890 --> 00:08:48,940
make sure that it's connected to the body

138
00:08:48,940 --> 00:08:50,490
This actually looks quite good

139
00:08:52,120 --> 00:08:53,110
And for the color here

140
00:08:53,260 --> 00:08:57,980
againwe can just use it here from the Material Assets panel

141
00:08:59,170 --> 00:09:00,690
So I think it was this color

142
00:09:01,880 --> 00:09:02,200
right

143
00:09:04,110 --> 00:09:06,190
Maybe I have to increase the width a little bit

144
00:09:09,140 --> 00:09:10,400
But if we look at it

145
00:09:11,800 --> 00:09:13,930
yeahthat's this is actually quite small

146
00:09:13,930 --> 00:09:17,160
Alsomaybe reduce it a little bit

147
00:09:17,770 --> 00:09:24,660
So just maybe 1 and 0．7 here

148
00:09:26,510 --> 00:09:29,540
or maybe like 0．6

149
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:31,040
Yeahlike that

150
00:09:32,670 --> 00:09:34,460
maybe a little bit bigger

151
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:38,250
1．2so like that

152
00:09:39,490 --> 00:09:41,580
And then same for the right side

153
00:09:41,580 --> 00:09:43,670
So just duplicate this rectangle

154
00:09:45,260 --> 00:09:46,170
move this up

155
00:09:46,290 --> 00:09:48,240
and he will actually just

156
00:09:50,310 --> 00:09:53,470
Rotate it by 57 degrees maybe

157
00:09:56,570 --> 00:09:58,470
And then move it here to the side

158
00:10:04,370 --> 00:10:04,740
All right

159
00:10:05,080 --> 00:10:07,990
so I think this should fit now

160
00:10:08,260 --> 00:10:09,950
Yeahkind of like

161
00:10:11,080 --> 00:10:12,490
And then for the description

162
00:10:12,490 --> 00:10:13,390
actuallyyou can

163
00:10:13,390 --> 00:10:16,290
againjust copy any text you want here

164
00:10:16,290 --> 00:10:18,050
I will just choose a metric

165
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:19,050
add 1 and

166
00:10:21,190 --> 00:10:24,240
Move this thing here

167
00:10:25,970 --> 00:10:29,100
Change the text to 100

168
00:10:31,970 --> 00:10:32,910
Move it down here

169
00:10:35,450 --> 00:10:45,330
I think actually here we already have to reduce the font size because it it doesn't fit anymore

170
00:10:46,390 --> 00:10:52,400
So maybe I will reduce it to maybe 2．5

171
00:10:53,210 --> 00:10:56,200
Yeahmaybe like that

172
00:10:58,830 --> 00:10:59,650
And again

173
00:10:59,910 --> 00:11:01,920
we can duplicate this one

174
00:11:02,730 --> 00:11:04,140
bring it to this side

175
00:11:06,100 --> 00:11:10,240
And then we actually just have to add another 0 here to the text

176
00:11:12,110 --> 00:11:15,580
And then we have this description ready here

177
00:11:17,590 --> 00:11:22,090
Soand then maybe it's time actually to clean this up a little bit

178
00:11:22,090 --> 00:11:27,190
So we will just rename all of the things we just created real quick

179
00:11:27,660 --> 00:11:28,600
So for this 1

180
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:31,180
I will just call it 1000

181
00:11:33,280 --> 00:11:35,820
And this one is 100

182
00:11:38,940 --> 00:11:41,540
Alsocollapse it real quick and

183
00:11:43,590 --> 00:11:47,050
Maybe this one is blue button here

184
00:11:51,500 --> 00:11:53,290
This is AR APR

185
00:11:57,540 --> 00:11:59,940
Alsocollapse it here

186
00:12:00,890 --> 00:12:02,320
And we forgot

187
00:12:03,560 --> 00:12:04,550
Yeahthis one

188
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:07,800
maybe we will call it level off

189
00:12:12,290 --> 00:12:14,790
This one was a metric oney

190
00:12:16,830 --> 00:12:17,850
Metric

191
00:12:21,630 --> 00:12:23,630
And maybe we can also call it

192
00:12:24,030 --> 00:12:26,300
or maybe we leave it as another button

193
00:12:26,510 --> 00:12:27,060
actually

194
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:34,280
And those ones were from the regulator

195
00:12:34,280 --> 00:12:34,620
actually

196
00:12:37,230 --> 00:12:41,330
So I will actually move them also inside of this group

197
00:12:42,100 --> 00:12:43,500
So maybe like here

198
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:49,390
And rename it to

199
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:52,860
Maybe

200
00:12:54,950 --> 00:12:56,250
1000 pin

201
00:12:57,080 --> 00:12:59,720
And this is the 100 pin

202
00:13:04,070 --> 00:13:05,100
All right

203
00:13:07,640 --> 00:13:12,400
So I think we got everything right here

204
00:13:15,140 --> 00:13:18,310
YesI can't move this one inside of here because it's Boolean

205
00:13:18,770 --> 00:13:21,370
So maybe it's just more clear now

206
00:13:21,370 --> 00:13:22,070
actually

207
00:13:22,580 --> 00:13:24,410
But again

208
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:30,950
we will actually also group this one here up

209
00:13:31,240 --> 00:13:33,860
So I think I got actually everything

210
00:13:34,400 --> 00:13:35,880
So select all of them

211
00:13:35,890 --> 00:13:37,220
hit command n G

212
00:13:38,010 --> 00:13:44,750
and then we will rename this group to write components

213
00:13:48,330 --> 00:13:49,060
All right

214
00:13:50,030 --> 00:13:53,940
so now we nearly have everything up together

215
00:13:54,830 --> 00:14:00,460
but this one is actually missing two descriptions here and also those arrows

216
00:14:00,610 --> 00:14:02,000
arrows here

217
00:14:02,540 --> 00:14:05,160
So maybe just do this for now

218
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:10,890
So I can actually also

219
00:14:13,320 --> 00:14:21,920
Maybe duplicate the numbers here because so is also a little bit smaller in size

220
00:14:23,320 --> 00:14:24,590
And for the description

221
00:14:25,490 --> 00:14:27,530
we have DN and up

222
00:14:27,530 --> 00:14:28,940
so down and up

223
00:14:31,020 --> 00:14:37,600
So just quickly change the contents of the end and then duplicate it

224
00:14:38,650 --> 00:14:39,520
bring it up

225
00:14:41,490 --> 00:14:43,590
and also name it up

226
00:14:44,100 --> 00:14:45,950
So like that

227
00:14:47,740 --> 00:14:50,400
And quickly also rename the group here

228
00:14:50,410 --> 00:14:58,500
So this one is up text and this one was a down text

229
00:15:01,580 --> 00:15:02,170
All right

230
00:15:04,530 --> 00:15:07,170
And now when I see it right

231
00:15:07,170 --> 00:15:09,990
we actually have to do the arrows

232
00:15:11,510 --> 00:15:12,500
So for this one

233
00:15:12,500 --> 00:15:13,360
we can maybe

234
00:15:18,980 --> 00:15:22,070
Maybe actually duplicate the light ellipse here

235
00:15:24,470 --> 00:15:26,950
And then resize it here

236
00:15:27,330 --> 00:15:31,170
So maybe do something like 18

237
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:35,370
So yeah

238
00:15:35,370 --> 00:15:36,030
like that

239
00:15:38,140 --> 00:15:41,950
And also maybe just change the ring a little bit

240
00:15:41,950 --> 00:15:43,670
So not that much

241
00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:44,970
maybe to 93

242
00:15:46,470 --> 00:15:46,750
Alright

243
00:15:46,990 --> 00:15:52,460
and here we actually have the opportunity to also adapt the angle here

244
00:15:54,030 --> 00:15:54,990
And for this 1

245
00:15:54,990 --> 00:16:05,080
I will maybe just simply use 90 here or maybe a little bit less because if you look at the image

246
00:16:06,570 --> 00:16:09,310
it's not really like full 90 degrees

247
00:16:09,310 --> 00:16:10,960
So it's a little bit less

248
00:16:11,970 --> 00:16:18,100
So maybe use 70 or maybe even maybe 60

249
00:16:18,110 --> 00:16:19,370
Let's go with 60

250
00:16:21,020 --> 00:16:23,620
and then we actually

251
00:16:25,690 --> 00:16:29,380
Have to bring this down here

252
00:16:32,760 --> 00:16:34,980
So this is actually way too near here

253
00:16:34,980 --> 00:16:36,810
but we will change it afterwards

254
00:16:38,220 --> 00:16:39,830
But if you look at the arrow

255
00:16:42,840 --> 00:16:44,060
Yeahmaybe even more

256
00:16:47,130 --> 00:16:47,970
So like that

257
00:16:54,940 --> 00:16:57,900
And then we also have to do another one

258
00:16:57,900 --> 00:16:59,970
So maybe duplicate it

259
00:17:00,830 --> 00:17:01,460
This one

260
00:17:01,460 --> 00:17:04,460
we have to bring it down here

261
00:17:07,190 --> 00:17:07,760
So like that

262
00:17:13,840 --> 00:17:14,250
Yeah

263
00:17:14,250 --> 00:17:15,300
this looks quite good

264
00:17:18,120 --> 00:17:20,800
And then we just have to do the arrow cap

265
00:17:21,060 --> 00:17:24,030
Actuallymaybe like that

266
00:17:24,200 --> 00:17:31,600
I will just quickly resize a metric out text because this one is way too big

267
00:17:32,080 --> 00:17:36,370
Let me just check what we have chosen here for the 100

268
00:17:36,370 --> 00:17:38,960
So we have a 2．5 font size here

269
00:17:39,940 --> 00:17:44,930
so I will just maybe also use it here because this is much better now

270
00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:50,300
And maybe also use it here for the level of text

271
00:17:50,820 --> 00:17:52,190
So 2．5

272
00:17:54,360 --> 00:17:56,860
Move it a little bit here to the center

273
00:17:58,640 --> 00:18:03,970
And then we can just continue with the arrows

274
00:18:05,430 --> 00:18:07,720
I will just quickly rename it here too

275
00:18:08,610 --> 00:18:15,280
Arrow line up and arrow line down

276
00:18:17,300 --> 00:18:19,340
So you just see the difference

277
00:18:21,250 --> 00:18:23,560
And then we just have to do the cap

278
00:18:23,560 --> 00:18:24,070
actually

279
00:18:24,070 --> 00:18:28,060
So maybe we can do it with a triangle here

280
00:18:28,290 --> 00:18:29,730
So give it a twist

281
00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:32,530
Maybe like that

282
00:18:33,290 --> 00:18:33,780
And again

283
00:18:33,780 --> 00:18:35,580
we have to increase the size here

284
00:18:37,150 --> 00:18:37,360
You know

285
00:18:37,610 --> 00:18:38,060
that's good

286
00:18:38,070 --> 00:18:39,880
Maybe 1．4

287
00:18:45,160 --> 00:18:45,380
Okay

288
00:18:45,410 --> 00:18:47,050
it's a little bit longer actually

289
00:18:52,210 --> 00:18:52,490
Okay

290
00:18:52,490 --> 00:18:58,420
maybe 1．4 and x and zero point 1．9 in y

291
00:19:00,130 --> 00:19:00,990
maybe like that

292
00:19:04,870 --> 00:19:08,170
Then just move it around so it looks quite good

293
00:19:09,520 --> 00:19:10,360
And also

294
00:19:10,360 --> 00:19:16,030
againclick on the four dots here and choose the orange material from the asset library

295
00:19:16,120 --> 00:19:17,360
So orange pots

296
00:19:19,300 --> 00:19:21,210
And then I will again

297
00:19:21,210 --> 00:19:24,140
just quickly check if it's aligned

298
00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:25,130
It's not really aligned

299
00:19:25,130 --> 00:19:26,160
what it looks like

300
00:19:26,890 --> 00:19:32,750
it just fits for this tutorial and then duplicate it

301
00:19:35,240 --> 00:19:38,440
And then we will bring this one down here

302
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:44,460
So I really like that

303
00:19:59,580 --> 00:20:00,250
All right

304
00:20:02,920 --> 00:20:05,510
I think actually this looks quite good now

305
00:20:06,330 --> 00:20:08,060
So we have the up and down arrow

306
00:20:08,060 --> 00:20:09,680
We have every description

307
00:20:10,680 --> 00:20:19,520
and maybe we have to actually then do a little bit more edit here on this regulator

308
00:20:20,550 --> 00:20:21,010
But first

309
00:20:21,010 --> 00:20:23,720
againwe have to rename everything

310
00:20:23,720 --> 00:20:25,880
So again

311
00:20:26,330 --> 00:20:27,210
this one was

312
00:20:29,220 --> 00:20:30,210
Arrow up

313
00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:35,340
And this one was the arrow down

314
00:20:38,610 --> 00:20:44,210
And maybe we'll just move it here inside of the regulator

315
00:20:48,600 --> 00:20:50,480
So this should be fine

316
00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:53,470
or I actually didn't want it to be there

317
00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:54,600
So maybe like that

318
00:20:56,270 --> 00:20:56,920
All right

319
00:20:57,440 --> 00:20:59,920
now we have everything named correctly

320
00:21:03,570 --> 00:21:08,240
And then we will do some more edit on the on this regulator here

321
00:21:10,600 --> 00:21:11,500
So this 1

322
00:21:13,040 --> 00:21:23,380
I will actually also rename it here to regulate left and this one to regulate right

323
00:21:25,860 --> 00:21:26,380
Okay

324
00:21:26,410 --> 00:21:27,200
and here again

325
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:29,980
we don't actually have the triangle

326
00:21:30,280 --> 00:21:30,880
So again

327
00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:33,620
we can just delete this one

328
00:21:34,940 --> 00:21:35,510
And again

329
00:21:35,510 --> 00:21:38,880
if we maybe look at the video

330
00:21:40,180 --> 00:21:42,990
you now see that it's

331
00:21:43,010 --> 00:21:49,390
yeahwe have a kind of like black base here underneath

332
00:21:50,030 --> 00:21:51,610
So maybe we can

333
00:21:53,810 --> 00:21:55,950
Get this one also here

334
00:21:57,490 --> 00:21:58,760
So first I will actually

335
00:21:58,760 --> 00:21:59,920
againmaybe just

336
00:22:03,040 --> 00:22:04,930
Resize this cone here

337
00:22:04,930 --> 00:22:13,920
So top and bottom is equally n for x and not y again

338
00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:16,240
but z component here

339
00:22:16,740 --> 00:22:19,870
So we'll make it a little bit thinner here

340
00:22:21,340 --> 00:22:34,500
And then we can maybe select those three elements here and move them a little bit to the front here

341
00:22:35,780 --> 00:22:37,150
And let me check real quick

342
00:22:37,150 --> 00:22:40,790
So this base plate is a little bit bigger

343
00:22:43,470 --> 00:22:45,870
But maybe not in the whiff

344
00:22:46,170 --> 00:22:46,890
in the height

345
00:22:47,010 --> 00:22:54,660
So I will reduce it to 10 here and increase the extrusion here to 2

346
00:22:55,050 --> 00:23:00,450
But then we actually also have to reduce the bevel here

347
00:23:03,710 --> 00:23:04,300
Maybe 2

348
00:23:04,300 --> 00:23:05,420
0．5

349
00:23:05,620 --> 00:23:06,040
Let me check

350
00:23:06,040 --> 00:23:07,490
Yeahthis one looks good

351
00:23:09,340 --> 00:23:14,490
And now we just have to insert the black base here

352
00:23:15,650 --> 00:23:16,690
And maybe

353
00:23:16,690 --> 00:23:24,280
maybe we will actually just reduce the size of the base blade a little bit more

354
00:23:24,440 --> 00:23:25,710
So maybe like 9

355
00:23:27,730 --> 00:23:28,820
Maybe like this

356
00:23:29,890 --> 00:23:31,360
And for this black base

357
00:23:31,370 --> 00:23:32,230
we can

358
00:23:32,750 --> 00:23:33,140
Yeah

359
00:23:33,140 --> 00:23:38,130
we can actually maybe just copy this cap here from the right regulator

360
00:23:39,840 --> 00:23:41,910
So let me just copy this one

361
00:23:45,030 --> 00:23:49,240
Duplicate it and then move it here to the side

362
00:23:53,440 --> 00:24:01,460
And then we will just rearrange the view a little bit and bring it here to the body like

363
00:24:05,090 --> 00:24:05,400
That

364
00:24:07,820 --> 00:24:08,160
Now

365
00:24:08,160 --> 00:24:10,750
I actually noticed that the light ring isn't really connected to the body

366
00:24:10,750 --> 00:24:14,140
but we will actually just leave it as it is now

367
00:24:16,060 --> 00:24:22,280
But now we can actually just also increase the extrusion here of this one

368
00:24:25,970 --> 00:24:27,650
Maybe just connect it here

369
00:24:31,830 --> 00:24:32,820
Then yeah

370
00:24:33,500 --> 00:24:35,170
just increase it there

371
00:24:37,060 --> 00:24:38,570
So if we look now

372
00:24:40,150 --> 00:24:41,610
this could fit quite good

373
00:24:44,340 --> 00:24:45,060
But actually

374
00:24:45,060 --> 00:24:45,900
for the color

375
00:24:46,250 --> 00:24:57,960
we may maybe unbound the material here and actually use maybe a darker color here for the top color layer like that

376
00:25:00,010 --> 00:25:03,110
And then let me just check

377
00:25:05,290 --> 00:25:06,930
I think this should be actually fine

378
00:25:10,940 --> 00:25:10,960
Yeah

379
00:25:11,630 --> 00:25:12,990
this should be quite good

380
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:18,720
I think this works

381
00:25:20,630 --> 00:25:25,640
but maybe so if we align it here to the center

382
00:25:25,640 --> 00:25:32,870
maybe we will reduce the size of the with the front screw here

383
00:25:33,300 --> 00:25:33,910
But actually

384
00:25:33,910 --> 00:25:48,020
I will just maybe move it again out of the out of the group here and connected to the regulator left because we were working now in the in the left regulator and now here

385
00:25:48,180 --> 00:25:52,810
I will actually resize it to 13 maybe

386
00:25:53,930 --> 00:25:54,790
So like that

387
00:25:55,300 --> 00:25:57,810
And this 1 I will increase

388
00:26:00,640 --> 00:26:01,650
To 16

389
00:26:01,900 --> 00:26:02,250
maybe

390
00:26:07,940 --> 00:26:11,800
Because if we maybe look again at the reference image

391
00:26:13,840 --> 00:26:18,490
I think actually that the front one is a little bit smaller than the one behind

392
00:26:18,800 --> 00:26:22,320
so maybe we'll just leave it as it is now

393
00:26:25,930 --> 00:26:27,540
Maybe if you look at the video

394
00:26:27,620 --> 00:26:32,100
you see also that this ground here is kind of like black

395
00:26:32,230 --> 00:26:35,470
So you will also get this one real quick

396
00:26:36,200 --> 00:26:39,410
And to do is to just duplicate the light ellipse here

397
00:26:39,410 --> 00:26:39,730
maybe

398
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:43,310
So we have another one

399
00:26:44,210 --> 00:26:50,020
and then we can actually just remove the ring element here

400
00:26:50,950 --> 00:26:53,770
but also resize it here

401
00:26:53,770 --> 00:26:55,640
So maybe like 14

402
00:26:56,870 --> 00:26:58,000
And for the material

403
00:26:58,020 --> 00:27:02,640
we will just choose a gray regulator

404
00:27:02,640 --> 00:27:03,600
1 here

405
00:27:04,020 --> 00:27:05,500
and then again

406
00:27:05,520 --> 00:27:12,570
unboundedand choose the black 1 here for the last material layer

407
00:27:14,860 --> 00:27:17,980
And now this should be quite good

408
00:27:18,710 --> 00:27:19,540
I think

409
00:27:25,820 --> 00:27:26,020
Okay

410
00:27:26,020 --> 00:27:26,310
nice

411
00:27:26,920 --> 00:27:34,110
So then just maybe the kind of like last step is now to create those little screws here

412
00:27:34,120 --> 00:27:36,950
And that is just the last

413
00:27:37,520 --> 00:27:38,380
maybe not the last step

414
00:27:38,380 --> 00:27:40,340
but one of the last steps for this project

415
00:27:40,350 --> 00:27:42,810
So we will just also quickly do it

416
00:27:44,500 --> 00:27:45,450
So here again

417
00:27:45,450 --> 00:27:48,680
we will just make a quick ellipse maybe

418
00:27:48,880 --> 00:27:51,480
So choose from the top two or the Ellipse tool

419
00:27:51,950 --> 00:27:52,880
And then

420
00:27:52,880 --> 00:27:53,310
I don't know

421
00:27:53,310 --> 00:27:53,850
for the

422
00:27:54,420 --> 00:27:55,380
for the size

423
00:27:56,290 --> 00:27:57,460
maybe 3 and 3

424
00:28:00,020 --> 00:28:01,490
Maybe 2．5

425
00:28:02,500 --> 00:28:05,630
So a little bit smaller

426
00:28:06,770 --> 00:28:09,570
And then I can connect it to the body

427
00:28:10,720 --> 00:28:12,730
can also give it a little bit of extrusion

428
00:28:13,020 --> 00:28:18,530
So maybe like 0．3 here

429
00:28:18,530 --> 00:28:21,090
You see now that it's connected to the body

430
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:27,540
So then change to the front view and look

431
00:28:27,540 --> 00:28:29,290
if the ali​‌​‌​​‌‌​​‌‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌​​‌‌​‌‌‌​​‌‌​​‌‌​​‌‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌‌​‌‌​​‌‌​‌​‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌​‌‌​​​‌‌‌‌‌‌​​‌‌‌​‌‌​​‌‌​‌​‌​​‌‌‌​‌‌​​‌‌​​​‌​​‌‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌​‌‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌​​​‌​​‌‌​‌‌‌‌‌​‌​‌​‌​​‌‌​‌​‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌‌‌‌​​​‌‌‌​‌‌​​‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌​​‌‌​‌‌​​​‌‌​‌‌​​​‌‌​​‌‌​​‌‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌​‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌​​​‌‌‌​​‌​​‌‌‌‌‌​​​‌‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌​‌‌​​​‌‌‌‌‌​​​‌‌‌‌‌‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌‌​​‌‌‌​‌​‌‌‌​​‌‌​​‌‌​​‌‌‌‌‌​​​‌‌‌‌‌​​​‌‌​‌​‌‌‌​‌​​​‌​​‌‌​​‌‌​​‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌​‌‌‌​​‌‌‌‌‌​​​‌‌​‌‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌​‌‌​​‌‌​‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌​‌​‌​​‌‌​‌‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌​‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌​‌‌​​​‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌​​‌‌​‌​‌‌‌​‌‌​​‌​​‌‌​‌‌‌‌‌​‌​‌​‌​​‌‌​‌​‌​​‌‌​‌​‌‌‌​‌‌​​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌‌​​‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌​​‌‌‌​​‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌​‌‌‌​​‌‌‌​​‌‌‌​‌​‌‌‌‌‌​‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌​‌​‌‌‌​‌​‌‌‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌​‌‌​​‌‌​​‌‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌​‌​‌‌‌​‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌​​‌‌‌‌‌​​​‌‌‌​​‌​​‌‌‌​‌‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌​‌‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌​​​‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌​​‌​​‌‌​‌​‌‌‌​‌​‌‌‌​​‌‌​‌‌​​​‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌​‌‌‌​​‌‌‌‌‌​​​‌‌​‌​‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌‌​​‌‌‌​‌​‌‌‌‌‌​‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌‌​​‌‌‌‌‌‌​​‌‌​‌‌‌​​‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌‌​​‌​​‌‌​​‌‌​​‌‌‌​​‌​​‌‌‌​​‌​​‌‌​‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌gnment is right

432
00:28:29,620 --> 00:28:32,940
Okaymaybe a little bit more to the right side

433
00:28:33,650 --> 00:28:37,430
And now this should be fine

434
00:28:37,760 --> 00:28:38,850
And for the material

435
00:28:38,850 --> 00:28:40,800
actuallywe can maybe

436
00:28:40,800 --> 00:28:43,890
just maybe

437
00:28:43,940 --> 00:28:47,450
just use the material here from the knob button actually

438
00:28:49,730 --> 00:28:50,760
Maybe to

439
00:28:54,600 --> 00:28:57,520
Maybe you can just click here with the right

440
00:28:57,710 --> 00:29:04,190
with the right mouse or to the knob button and then actually just copy the material

441
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:15,670
So this is also a possibility to use materials and then choose ellipse 1 and paste material here

442
00:29:15,670 --> 00:29:25,040
So now we have a little black shiny material onto here that I will rename this one to screw maybe

443
00:29:27,960 --> 00:29:29,440
And this 1

444
00:29:29,450 --> 00:29:35,860
I will just move inside of the right components group and then duplicate it

445
00:29:38,530 --> 00:29:45,710
And move this to the left side also because there we also got a screw

446
00:29:46,690 --> 00:29:50,910
So maybe like here and this one

447
00:29:51,670 --> 00:29:55,850
we will actually move inside of the left component group

448
00:29:58,000 --> 00:29:59,920
So this one is actually far up

449
00:30:02,300 --> 00:30:08,460
So let me just collapse it real quick and then move this one in the left components group

450
00:30:10,390 --> 00:30:11,680
So if you simulate now

451
00:30:11,690 --> 00:30:15,130
you actually see that the shaping work pretty good

452
00:30:17,300 --> 00:30:22,120
So it looks more and more like the reference image

453
00:30:23,970 --> 00:30:26,090
So we're now to finish this project

454
00:30:26,090 --> 00:30:30,050
actually make sure that maybe I forgot to say it

455
00:30:30,050 --> 00:30:36,020
but also change the material of the top element actually to the green body

456
00:30:38,860 --> 00:30:42,470
The body and the top is actually actually have the same material

457
00:30:43,630 --> 00:30:45,720
And now for the last steps

458
00:30:45,720 --> 00:30:49,330
we can just maybe delete or hide the screenshot

459
00:30:49,560 --> 00:30:52,520
So we have a clean view here

460
00:30:53,280 --> 00:30:55,920
And now if you just render it

461
00:30:56,310 --> 00:30:58,000
it already looks quite good

462
00:30:59,780 --> 00:31:03,100
But maybe for some details

463
00:31:03,100 --> 00:31:07,450
we can actually also add a little texture to the background

464
00:31:07,970 --> 00:31:09,500
And for this 1

465
00:31:09,500 --> 00:31:12,660
I will maybe in type in FCU

466
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:15,660
And for the font size

467
00:31:15,670 --> 00:31:18,680
we can maybe use like 180

468
00:31:19,910 --> 00:31:24,700
But make sure that the wrapper is actually big enough for your font

469
00:31:27,460 --> 00:31:30,070
Adapt the size of the font fits

470
00:31:31,500 --> 00:31:40,950
And then I will move this a little bit up here to the side and also to the background here

471
00:31:42,860 --> 00:31:45,330
Maybe give it also a little bit of extrusion

472
00:31:45,850 --> 00:31:48,150
so maybe something like 30

473
00:31:50,060 --> 00:31:51,080
so like that

474
00:31:52,120 --> 00:31:55,540
And also we will actually

475
00:31:56,100 --> 00:32:00,860
yeahdo a little bit of material adaption here

476
00:32:01,030 --> 00:32:02,830
So for the color

477
00:32:02,980 --> 00:32:05,510
you will actually choose this one

478
00:32:05,540 --> 00:32:07,020
So in hex code

479
00:32:07,020 --> 00:32:13,290
it's again 1 4 2 4 2 7 and an RGB

480
00:32:14,420 --> 00:32:15,430
this value here

481
00:32:15,440 --> 00:32:16,230
So you can

482
00:32:16,460 --> 00:32:18,310
you can just simply copy that

483
00:32:19,720 --> 00:32:25,780
For the lighting we will just leave it maybe as it is for now

484
00:32:27,690 --> 00:32:35,760
but we will actually introduce another layer and this one will be a Fresnel 1 and this one

485
00:32:35,850 --> 00:32:38,350
move it down here to the second position

486
00:32:39,980 --> 00:32:50,010
And for the resen now we will just use a simple black and the bias change the 2 0．14

487
00:32:52,160 --> 00:32:53,030
For the blending mode

488
00:32:53,030 --> 00:32:56,840
we will use Overlay and both Lighting and Fresno

489
00:32:58,800 --> 00:33:03,280
And then maybe for the lighting

490
00:33:03,290 --> 00:33:08,920
you can bring in a little bit of red so it fits to the whole body

491
00:33:10,410 --> 00:33:11,770
I prepared the value

492
00:33:11,770 --> 00:33:13,770
which I think works pretty good

493
00:33:14,470 --> 00:33:16,340
and this is this color

494
00:33:17,120 --> 00:33:18,030
So again

495
00:33:18,030 --> 00:33:21,290
it is a hex code and here is our RGB code

496
00:33:24,030 --> 00:33:28,750
Soand maybe some more fine adjustments here

497
00:33:29,280 --> 00:33:33,450
I will reduce the opacity of the Fresnel layer to 40

498
00:33:34,250 --> 00:33:35,250
And for the lighting

499
00:33:35,250 --> 00:33:37,410
we can just keep it as it is

500
00:33:38,180 --> 00:33:41,100
But for the overall material opacity

501
00:33:41,110 --> 00:33:45,190
we will just use 50% here

502
00:33:47,090 --> 00:33:47,800
All right

503
00:33:48,720 --> 00:33:50,280
this looks quite good

504
00:33:51,230 --> 00:33:51,820
So again

505
00:33:51,820 --> 00:33:53,320
if we render now

506
00:33:54,920 --> 00:34:01,270
it already looks quite good and maybe some little more fine adjustments I like

507
00:34:01,430 --> 00:34:04,820
I like the effects that actually a lot

508
00:34:04,980 --> 00:34:10,050
So maybe I will use a little bit of vignette here

509
00:34:10,710 --> 00:34:14,170
So maybe like an offset of

510
00:34:16,210 --> 00:34:18,020
Maybe 0．28

511
00:34:18,120 --> 00:34:19,150
And for the darkness

512
00:34:19,220 --> 00:34:20,210
I will leave it as

513
00:34:22,220 --> 00:34:23,420
For the value one

514
00:34:24,380 --> 00:34:26,910
And now if we zoom in a little bit

515
00:34:29,180 --> 00:34:30,820
This looks quite good

516
00:34:33,740 --> 00:34:34,320
And now

517
00:34:34,950 --> 00:34:38,540
so I don't actually want to exceed the limits of this video tutorial now

518
00:34:38,550 --> 00:34:43,000
but can now imagine that you can also do some animations

519
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:45,230
like for the buttons for the regulators

520
00:34:45,230 --> 00:34:47,170
So for example

521
00:34:47,170 --> 00:34:48,530
if you push the button

522
00:34:48,600 --> 00:34:53,350
then the light is the light will be changed to red or something

523
00:34:54,050 --> 00:34:57,140
The values of the display are going to change

524
00:34:57,150 --> 00:35:01,710
And so you have endless possibilities for this tutorial actually

525
00:35:01,710 --> 00:35:04,470
just how you can

526
00:35:05,080 --> 00:35:09,640
yeahmaybe get the get the workflow for rebuilding

527
00:35:09,640 --> 00:35:10,980
something like that

528
00:35:11,180 --> 00:35:11,890
So again

529
00:35:11,890 --> 00:35:14,630
this is not as precise as in the video

530
00:35:14,630 --> 00:35:15,640
but I mean

531
00:35:15,640 --> 00:35:19,030
for this time we actually build it

532
00:35:19,030 --> 00:35:20,040
it's quite good

533
00:35:20,050 --> 00:35:20,570
So again

534
00:35:20,570 --> 00:35:23,590
if you take take more time

535
00:35:23,590 --> 00:35:24,930
you will also

536
00:35:25,650 --> 00:35:28,940
yeahcreate more details and we'll

537
00:35:29,600 --> 00:35:33,270
yeahget the same result as this one maybe

538
00:35:33,530 --> 00:35:34,400
So yeah

539
00:35:34,410 --> 00:35:37,500
there possibilities are endless

540
00:35:37,520 --> 00:35:44,140
And this is just a little example of how you can achieve something like that
