1
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:02,740
So let's talk about 3D cameras

2
00:00:02,820 --> 00:00:07,680
so how you can create them and how to do some nice transitions with them also

3
00:00:08,120 --> 00:00:09,650
And for this lesson

4
00:00:09,650 --> 00:00:14,800
we will actually choose the same scene setup as in the components lesson

5
00:00:15,160 --> 00:00:18,550
So we have now here our 3 little buttons

6
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:22,940
which will actually change the color of the light bulb down below

7
00:00:23,310 --> 00:00:24,140
And again

8
00:00:24,140 --> 00:00:25,420
this is component based

9
00:00:25,420 --> 00:00:28,660
So if you don't know about components yet

10
00:00:29,080 --> 00:00:35,050
please make sure to actually watch the lesson about components so you know what we are doing right now

11
00:00:35,630 --> 00:00:36,450
And yeah

12
00:00:36,460 --> 00:00:37,790
so to start

13
00:00:38,280 --> 00:00:42,110
we will actually look at the base scene here

14
00:00:43,010 --> 00:00:45,520
Whenever you actually create a default scene

15
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:47,440
you have a camera by default

16
00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:51,090
because otherwise you wouldn't actually see anything

17
00:00:51,270 --> 00:00:53,770
So if you have nothing selected here

18
00:00:53,770 --> 00:00:58,750
you see on the top right corner that you have the viewport called Personal camera

19
00:00:59,250 --> 00:01:02,260
And this personal camera exists at any time

20
00:01:02,270 --> 00:01:04,650
So whenever you create a new scene

21
00:01:04,890 --> 00:01:09,270
But there's also the possibility actually to create your own camera

22
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:10,240
So for example

23
00:01:10,380 --> 00:01:12,630
you could choose this option here

24
00:01:12,630 --> 00:01:15,220
which calls Add new camera

25
00:01:15,340 --> 00:01:20,880
but you can also actually just choose the camera from the top two bar here on the plus icon

26
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:23,350
And here you see the camera option

27
00:01:24,500 --> 00:01:26,240
Soand if you click on it

28
00:01:26,410 --> 00:01:29,160
you will actually just create a new camera

29
00:01:29,230 --> 00:01:32,840
which is indicated by this little yellow rectangle

30
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:36,180
So

31
00:01:36,180 --> 00:01:38,280
and on the top left corner here

32
00:01:38,290 --> 00:01:41,390
you actually see the POV

33
00:01:41,390 --> 00:01:43,030
as we may call it now

34
00:01:43,030 --> 00:01:45,900
So the view from your new camera that was created

35
00:01:45,910 --> 00:01:47,770
So here in the camera

36
00:01:47,790 --> 00:01:53,300
so maybe if I just rename it to maybe something like second view

37
00:01:53,820 --> 00:01:57,380
you now see that this one is also getting changed to second view

38
00:01:57,380 --> 00:02:01,390
And this just basically indicates your view here

39
00:02:01,640 --> 00:02:05,360
And you now see that while I'm changing the camera position

40
00:02:05,540 --> 00:02:10,120
the view on the bottom left side is also getting updated

41
00:02:11,250 --> 00:02:14,440
And now you can actually just play around with it

42
00:02:14,510 --> 00:02:16,450
And here on the right side

43
00:02:16,450 --> 00:02:19,970
you actually have also some properties that you can change

44
00:02:20,030 --> 00:02:20,860
So for example

45
00:02:22,030 --> 00:02:26,000
you can change between the perspective and the orthographic view

46
00:02:26,210 --> 00:02:28,470
or you can change the new and file value

47
00:02:28,470 --> 00:02:32,030
Or you can also zoom in how you want to

48
00:02:32,980 --> 00:02:33,630
Okay

49
00:02:33,640 --> 00:02:39,670
so maybe we will stick around with the perspective view now here and here

50
00:02:39,670 --> 00:02:41,980
You have now also some other changes

51
00:02:41,980 --> 00:02:42,710
So for example

52
00:02:42,810 --> 00:02:44,580
you also have a Fov

53
00:02:44,740 --> 00:02:46,120
so a field of view

54
00:02:46,520 --> 00:02:47,510
So for example

55
00:02:47,510 --> 00:02:48,680
what the field of view is

56
00:02:48,690 --> 00:02:54,480
actuallyyou see here the body or the guy here that is looking forward here

57
00:02:55,030 --> 00:02:58,500
And the angle actually indicates the field of you

58
00:02:58,660 --> 00:03:01,550
So maybe if you compare it with some camera lenses

59
00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:03,280
so wide angles

60
00:03:03,300 --> 00:03:03,790
so for example

61
00:03:03,790 --> 00:03:05,220
140 degrees

62
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:06,700
it's pretty wide angle

63
00:03:06,700 --> 00:03:08,620
So you actually see a lot of

64
00:03:09,140 --> 00:03:11,870
yeahobstacles in front of you

65
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:14,760
And maybe if you have a less field of view

66
00:03:14,760 --> 00:03:20,120
you actually only see obstacles that are aligned here with the rays here

67
00:03:21,250 --> 00:03:23,700
Yeahin around 2．5 degrees

68
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:26,870
So now you also know what the field of view is

69
00:03:26,880 --> 00:03:27,820
And also here again

70
00:03:27,820 --> 00:03:29,870
you also have the zoom factor here

71
00:03:29,870 --> 00:03:32,660
So you can zoom in and out as you want to

72
00:03:33,080 --> 00:03:33,930
And again

73
00:03:33,940 --> 00:03:36,270
maybe if we watch the bird eye view here

74
00:03:36,270 --> 00:03:40,890
you can also just simply move your camera to the front

75
00:03:40,890 --> 00:03:41,660
to the side

76
00:03:41,670 --> 00:03:42,630
or give it a twist

77
00:03:42,630 --> 00:03:45,190
So just like any other obstacle

78
00:03:45,480 --> 00:03:46,210
So again

79
00:03:46,210 --> 00:03:52,960
you can also do a rotation maybe here as you see for some little nice effects or something

80
00:03:53,410 --> 00:03:57,330
But I will actually just stick around with 0 degrees here

81
00:03:57,990 --> 00:04:01,390
And if you actually want to lock your camera

82
00:04:01,390 --> 00:04:04,630
you can also and do this here by the lock

83
00:04:04,900 --> 00:04:07,250
And now your camera can't be moved

84
00:04:07,860 --> 00:04:12,010
but we will actually just unlock it now because we will do some features with it

85
00:04:13,350 --> 00:04:16,540
And that is what we are going to do now

86
00:04:16,970 --> 00:04:17,910
So by default

87
00:04:17,920 --> 00:04:22,260
you now have your second view here and also the personal camera view

88
00:04:22,310 --> 00:04:23,240
So for example

89
00:04:23,240 --> 00:04:25,990
if I now actually just do the play

90
00:04:25,990 --> 00:04:27,840
you now see that it zooms in

91
00:04:28,120 --> 00:04:33,200
That's because we actually are going to render the view with our second view here

92
00:04:33,550 --> 00:04:37,870
And we are now at the viewpoint of our personal camera

93
00:04:38,140 --> 00:04:40,270
So you can snap to our camera

94
00:04:40,270 --> 00:04:42,560
Now you see that it's also zoomed in

95
00:04:42,920 --> 00:04:45,990
And now we're actually looking through the second view here

96
00:04:45,990 --> 00:04:46,810
So if I render

97
00:04:46,810 --> 00:04:49,930
now you see it from that kind of view

98
00:04:51,230 --> 00:04:54,980
And now we can actually also do some transitions with it

99
00:04:54,990 --> 00:04:56,840
So for example

100
00:04:56,840 --> 00:05:01,210
now I will maybe zoom out a little bit

101
00:05:01,300 --> 00:05:05,880
So at first we just see the three buttons here

102
00:05:07,230 --> 00:05:11,860
and then we will actually introduce some of new states here

103
00:05:12,410 --> 00:05:15,010
Soand maybe one more

104
00:05:15,020 --> 00:05:16,400
So now we have a base state

105
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:17,090
a state

106
00:05:17,100 --> 00:05:18,660
and a state two here

107
00:05:18,710 --> 00:05:24,180
And the base state is basically how we look at​‌​‌​​‌‌​​‌‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌​​‌‌‌​​‌​​‌‌​​‌‌​​‌‌‌‌‌‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌​‌​‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌​‌‌​​​‌‌‌‌‌‌​​‌‌‌​​‌‌‌​‌​‌​‌​​‌‌‌​‌‌​​‌‌​​​‌​​‌‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌‌​​‌‌‌​‌‌​​‌​​‌‌​​​‌​​‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌​‌​‌​​‌‌​‌​‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌‌‌‌​​​‌‌‌​‌‌​​‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌​​‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌​‌‌​​​‌‌​​‌‌​​‌‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌​‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌​​​‌‌‌​​‌​​‌‌​​‌‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌​‌‌​​​‌‌‌‌‌‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌‌​​‌‌‌​‌​‌‌‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌​​‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌​​​‌‌​‌‌​​​‌‌​​​‌​​‌‌​​‌‌​​‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌​‌‌‌​​‌‌‌‌‌​​​‌‌​‌‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌​‌‌​​‌‌​‌​‌‌‌​‌​​​‌​​‌‌​‌​‌​​‌‌​‌‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌​‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌​‌‌​​​‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌‌​​‌‌​‌​‌‌‌​‌​‌‌​​​‌‌​‌‌‌‌‌​‌​‌​‌​​‌‌​‌​‌​​‌‌​‌​‌‌‌​‌‌​​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌‌​​‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌​​‌‌‌​​‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌​‌‌‌​​‌‌‌​​‌‌‌​‌​‌‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌​​​‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌​​‌​​‌‌‌​‌‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌​‌‌​​‌‌​​‌‌​​‌‌​‌​‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌​‌​‌‌‌​‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌‌​​‌​​‌‌​‌‌‌​​‌‌‌​​‌​​‌‌‌​‌‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌​‌‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌​​​‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌​​‌​​‌‌​‌​‌‌‌​‌​‌‌‌​​‌‌​‌‌​​​‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌​‌‌‌​​‌‌‌‌‌​​​‌‌​‌​‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌‌​​‌‌‌​‌​‌‌‌‌‌​‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌‌​​‌‌‌‌‌‌​​‌‌​‌‌‌​​‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌‌​​‌​​‌‌​​‌‌​​‌‌‌​​‌​​‌‌‌​​‌​​‌‌​‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌ our objects now

108
00:05:24,750 --> 00:05:28,040
And now we will actually introduce the state here

109
00:05:28,050 --> 00:05:31,010
and this one will be actually a little bit twisted

110
00:05:31,260 --> 00:05:32,330
So for example

111
00:05:33,160 --> 00:05:37,410
now maybe if I change the view here a little bit

112
00:05:37,410 --> 00:05:40,220
it is a camera like here

113
00:05:41,380 --> 00:05:45,590
I will actually bring this a little bit to the front here

114
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:49,700
a．snot maybe in this state

115
00:05:49,700 --> 00:05:52,240
but actually in every state here

116
00:05:52,370 --> 00:05:53,800
So maybe like that

117
00:05:54,740 --> 00:05:59,290
So now it is indeed here on the new position in every state

118
00:05:59,690 --> 00:06:03,450
And I will actually decrease the zoom factor a little bit

119
00:06:03,960 --> 00:06:05,890
So again

120
00:06:05,910 --> 00:06:09,680
all obstacles actually fit in the view

121
00:06:10,020 --> 00:06:11,910
maybe like 1．6

122
00:06:12,550 --> 00:06:13,840
Yeahmaybe like that

123
00:06:14,750 --> 00:06:17,120
So if we know Brenda

124
00:06:17,410 --> 00:06:20,270
we now actually see all of the obstacles

125
00:06:21,790 --> 00:06:23,710
And for the second state

126
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:30,660
we will actually just rotate the camera a little bit so you now see the yellow cone

127
00:06:30,670 --> 00:06:34,480
so this spreads around the rays here to the edges

128
00:06:35,160 --> 00:06:37,050
And for example

129
00:06:37,150 --> 00:06:44,360
if I am increasing the field of view now here you actually see I would change this in the second view also

130
00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:48,600
just as a little reminder of the field of view section here

131
00:06:49,140 --> 00:06:54,320
And what we're actually going to do now in the state is we give it a little twist

132
00:06:55,700 --> 00:06:57,170
so maybe like that

133
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:02,080
and then we also zoom in a little bit

134
00:07:03,870 --> 00:07:05,190
So maybe like that

135
00:07:09,200 --> 00:07:10,140
Okaythis looks good

136
00:07:10,950 --> 00:07:13,010
And for the second state

137
00:07:13,230 --> 00:07:14,760
we will actually do the same

138
00:07:15,510 --> 00:07:18,080
but actually then on the right obstacle

139
00:07:18,090 --> 00:07:19,130
So like that

140
00:07:19,860 --> 00:07:21,460
And for the zoom value

141
00:07:21,460 --> 00:07:25,820
I would just take the same value as in the day 2

142
00:07:27,130 --> 00:07:29,080
so 3．92

143
00:07:29,290 --> 00:07:33,710
And then we're zooming on to the right obstacle

144
00:07:34,760 --> 00:07:36,030
so maybe like that

145
00:07:38,860 --> 00:07:39,400
Okay

146
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:43,890
so now we have the base date and we like that

147
00:07:43,960 --> 00:07:45,790
And we have the base state

148
00:07:45,980 --> 00:07:46,730
the state two

149
00:07:46,730 --> 00:07:48,620
which is focused on the left side

150
00:07:48,630 --> 00:07:50,300
and the state two

151
00:07:50,300 --> 00:07:52,120
which is focused on the right side

152
00:07:52,850 --> 00:07:53,820
So

153
00:07:53,930 --> 00:07:58,180
and now you actually can introduce an event here

154
00:07:58,280 --> 00:07:59,280
And for this

155
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:00,980
we will actually do you start

156
00:08:01,190 --> 00:08:04,510
You can also maybe like introduce a button or something

157
00:08:04,510 --> 00:08:06,590
which you will trigger the transition

158
00:08:06,950 --> 00:08:09,420
but we will just use the start rendering function

159
00:08:09,920 --> 00:08:12,390
And then we will introduce a transition here

160
00:08:13,050 --> 00:08:14,470
And for the transition

161
00:08:14,470 --> 00:08:23,800
we will actually choose our camera and we will do a transition from our base state to the state here

162
00:08:24,100 --> 00:08:27,850
And this we will do in maybe like 5 seconds

163
00:08:28,570 --> 00:08:31,360
And we will use a linear transition here

164
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:34,310
Like that

165
00:08:34,330 --> 00:08:36,950
And then we will actually introduce another state

166
00:08:37,280 --> 00:08:40,640
And here we will also do a transition of 5 seconds

167
00:08:40,760 --> 00:08:48,320
And this one will be then ending in the state two event and also the linear way

168
00:08:49,550 --> 00:08:50,140
All right

169
00:08:50,180 --> 00:08:52,640
and now if I actually start the view

170
00:08:53,030 --> 00:08:57,470
you see now that the camera is actually moving with the transition to the right

171
00:08:57,590 --> 00:08:58,420
to the right side

172
00:08:58,430 --> 00:09:00,800
and then the left side

173
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:02,480
and then to the right side here

174
00:09:04,500 --> 00:09:08,340
Sobut this isn't actually the only thing you can do is cameras

175
00:09:08,350 --> 00:09:12,070
So you can just do transitions with them as you want to

176
00:09:12,210 --> 00:09:17,280
So you already have a variety of options you can do

177
00:09:17,280 --> 00:09:22,390
So the possibility with those functions are actually endless

178
00:09:22,390 --> 00:09:25,320
so you can just play around with it how you want to

179
00:09:26,610 --> 00:09:33,760
But what's also possible now is that we can also do a transition based on the path

180
00:09:33,830 --> 00:09:35,100
So for example

181
00:09:35,330 --> 00:09:39,620
I will now actually just remove this camera for now

182
00:09:40,140 --> 00:09:42,070
and also the transition we just built

183
00:09:42,850 --> 00:09:46,610
And now we will actually introduce a path here

184
00:09:46,690 --> 00:09:47,720
So for example

185
00:09:47,720 --> 00:09:49,940
just choose a vector tool here

186
00:09:51,060 --> 00:09:51,720
and maybe

187
00:09:51,720 --> 00:09:52,360
for example

188
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:56,100
we would just draw a line here from here to here

189
00:09:57,110 --> 00:09:59,640
Soand then press escape

190
00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:01,300
And now here on the right side

191
00:10:01,300 --> 00:10:04,110
you now have the possibility to convert it to path

192
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:06,560
So we click on convert to path

193
00:10:06,580 --> 00:10:08,240
Now we have a little like

194
00:10:08,290 --> 00:10:11,770
yeahlike line here

195
00:10:11,780 --> 00:10:14,030
but we actually don't want it to be extruded

196
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:22,020
so I will just remove the size here and maybe also the opacity of the material so you don't even see the shape

197
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:25,530
Soand then with the shape created here

198
00:10:25,650 --> 00:10:30,960
we can actually just start over and create a new camera again from the top toolbar here

199
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:35,240
So choose camera here and while the camera is selected

200
00:10:35,240 --> 00:10:38,780
we now have the possibility to align it to a path here

201
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:40,370
And for the object here

202
00:10:40,370 --> 00:10:41,180
we can actually

203
00:10:41,180 --> 00:10:42,610
we just choose the shape

204
00:10:42,620 --> 00:10:45,990
We just draw a so

205
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:50,470
And now you actually see that this camera is now aligned to the path here

206
00:10:50,980 --> 00:10:51,810
So again

207
00:10:51,810 --> 00:10:56,140
I will actually use the perspective view here in a little bit

208
00:10:56,750 --> 00:10:57,990
So maybe like that

209
00:11:00,210 --> 00:11:01,980
Alsogive it a little bit of rotation

210
00:11:01,980 --> 00:11:02,560
actually

211
00:11:03,480 --> 00:11:05,480
So maybe like that

212
00:11:06,610 --> 00:11:10,550
And for the height

213
00:11:10,550 --> 00:11:13,960
actuallyI will make it like that

214
00:11:13,970 --> 00:11:14,350
maybe

215
00:11:14,620 --> 00:11:16,330
So it's centered here

216
00:11:17,940 --> 00:11:20,720
So now it looks just fine

217
00:11:21,180 --> 00:11:24,580
And now we can actually just introduce again some new states

218
00:11:26,330 --> 00:11:28,440
Click on the plus icon here on the state

219
00:11:29,060 --> 00:11:31,340
and now we have a base state and state here

220
00:11:31,830 --> 00:11:33,910
Soand for the state here

221
00:11:33,910 --> 00:11:38,180
we will actually just increase the value of the offset to one

222
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:44,050
And what this does actually is that from the base state to the state

223
00:11:44,060 --> 00:11:45,980
we now have an offset of one

224
00:11:46,260 --> 00:11:51,110
which is just the same as the length of the shape we just created

225
00:11:51,110 --> 00:11:52,110
So this shape

226
00:11:52,450 --> 00:11:55,920
so now you see it's now here on the top right corner

227
00:11:56,460 --> 00:11:57,880
And in the base state

228
00:11:57,890 --> 00:12:01,080
it's actually just at the beginning of the path

229
00:12:02,870 --> 00:12:05,110
Soand now you can actually just

230
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:06,870
againcreate any event here

231
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:08,010
So any event you want

232
00:12:08,010 --> 00:12:12,110
I will just again use the start function and here we can do a transition

233
00:12:12,910 --> 00:12:14,050
And for the transition

234
00:12:14,050 --> 00:12:16,040
againthe target is the camera

235
00:12:16,660 --> 00:12:20,260
We will actually do a transition from the base state to the state

236
00:12:20,640 --> 00:12:23,900
And this one may be like in 7 seconds

237
00:12:23,910 --> 00:12:24,620
And also

238
00:12:24,620 --> 00:12:26,760
I will use a linear transition here

239
00:12:28,500 --> 00:12:31,820
And then if we now actually press start

240
00:12:31,890 --> 00:12:38,610
we now see that the camera is actually moving in alignment with the vector we just drew

241
00:12:38,620 --> 00:12:41,880
So this is not perfectly aligned here

242
00:12:41,950 --> 00:12:43,880
but for the technique

243
00:12:44,650 --> 00:12:45,880
it will be the same

244
00:12:46,380 --> 00:12:54,500
And maybe what's also just important to notice that you can also just actually use the scene as the same as before

245
00:12:54,500 --> 00:12:57,840
So you can trigger all transitions here

246
00:12:58,270 --> 00:13:00,570
So even while the camera is moving

247
00:13:00,580 --> 00:13:02,160
so it doesn't really matter

248
00:13:02,830 --> 00:13:05,910
but it's just a kind of like animation how to

249
00:13:05,910 --> 00:13:10,390
yeahgive it a little bit more of dynamic in your project

250
00:13:10,600 --> 00:13:14,430
And I hope this one will help you actually with

251
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:16,540
yeahyour further projects

252
00:13:16,540 --> 00:13:20,600
And I hope you actually enjoyed this lesson and see you in the next one
