00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:00,800
Hi guys

2
00:00:00,800 --> 00:00:07,730
so in this practice tutorial we will make a little portal based on the particles function in plane

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,900
And this is what I'm going to show you now in this tutorial

4
00:00:10,910 --> 00:00:12,420
so let's get started

5
00:00:12,750 --> 00:00:16,890
So then let's get started with the basic scene setup here

6
00:00:16,890 --> 00:00:19,960
So we are again in our default spline scene here

7
00:00:20,300 --> 00:00:21,460
And first

8
00:00:21,470 --> 00:00:26,640
we will actually just indicate here on our base plane where the port later will be

9
00:00:26,750 --> 00:00:29,660
So I will actually just place an ellipse here

10
00:00:30,270 --> 00:00:32,540
So no sizing or anything else

11
00:00:32,780 --> 00:00:36,530
but just as a little indicator where our portal later will be

12
00:00:37,430 --> 00:00:40,180
And I will give you just a quick white color here

13
00:00:41,460 --> 00:00:46,440
and then we will actually just build the scene around of this ellipse

14
00:00:46,620 --> 00:00:47,640
So for now

15
00:00:47,820 --> 00:00:50,420
I will actually just also hide the base plane

16
00:00:50,420 --> 00:00:54,460
Or maybe you can also just delete the base plane here

17
00:00:55,180 --> 00:00:59,150
And now we will actually build some walls and also a floor here

18
00:00:59,160 --> 00:01:02,310
So we will have a back back wall here

19
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:03,110
a left wall

20
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:04,660
and the floor

21
00:01:05,700 --> 00:01:06,610
And to do this

22
00:01:06,620 --> 00:01:15,260
we will just use a plain shape here from the top to the chooses and just place it anywhere in the scene

23
00:01:15,570 --> 00:01:18,090
And now hit option and shift

24
00:01:18,100 --> 00:01:22,250
And now you can actually just exceed the size in every direction

25
00:01:23,170 --> 00:01:27,010
And then I will place behind our portal here

26
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:29,670
so maybe like here for it first

27
00:01:30,900 --> 00:01:32,100
Now it looks like this

28
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:34,910
maybe a little bit down here

29
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:36,020
So it's centered

30
00:01:36,930 --> 00:01:41,200
And now we will also choose the visibility here

31
00:01:41,210 --> 00:01:42,290
So for the sides

32
00:01:42,290 --> 00:01:43,650
we will choose both

33
00:01:43,700 --> 00:01:47,480
And what this does actually is if you look at this

34
00:01:47,480 --> 00:01:49,870
we have now both sides visible

35
00:01:49,930 --> 00:01:56,180
so every color of material layer actually effect on both sides of the plane here

36
00:01:57,780 --> 00:02:03,370
So we have our back over now and now let's just do the left wall also

37
00:02:04,860 --> 00:02:05,990
So to do this

38
00:02:06,900 --> 00:02:14,030
I will actually just bring it up here and then you can rotate it so like that

39
00:02:14,760 --> 00:02:22,380
Or maybe you can just type 90 degrees in here and then move it here to the left side

40
00:02:22,890 --> 00:02:24,020
So like that maybe

41
00:02:28,070 --> 00:02:35,770
And then I will just duplicate again and then rotate it to this side so we get a nice flow

42
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,760
So maybe actually just again

43
00:02:39,950 --> 00:02:40,940
type here

44
00:02:40,990 --> 00:02:42,360
0 degrees

45
00:02:44,350 --> 00:02:46,390
and then move this one down

46
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:49,350
And this will be our floor

47
00:02:52,070 --> 00:02:52,570
So like

48
00:02:54,750 --> 00:02:58,060
That I will bring this 1 a little bit to the front here

49
00:02:58,240 --> 00:03:02,250
So we are connected with both of the other walls here

50
00:03:04,710 --> 00:03:09,220
Soand now you can imagine that our camera angle will be something like that

51
00:03:09,220 --> 00:03:13,710
So we actually look at both walls here and the floor

52
00:03:15,320 --> 00:03:17,010
Soand then for clarification

53
00:03:17,010 --> 00:03:20,160
I will just quickly also rename all of the planes here

54
00:03:20,260 --> 00:03:21,370
So this one is

55
00:03:23,570 --> 00:03:26,240
I will rename it to Right Wall

56
00:03:29,220 --> 00:03:31,360
Plane 2 is left wall

57
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:32,130
actually

58
00:03:33,830 --> 00:03:35,780
So left wall

59
00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:39,460
And plane 3 should be our floor here

60
00:03:40,310 --> 00:03:42,680
So rename it to floor

61
00:03:44,200 --> 00:03:44,980
All right

62
00:03:45,950 --> 00:03:49,340
and now we can actually just start over with the materials

63
00:03:49,570 --> 00:03:57,860
So I will actually use the same material for both walls here and the kind of little different material for the floor

64
00:03:58,800 --> 00:04:00,600
Sobut first

65
00:04:00,620 --> 00:04:06,120
we will actually just use or create the wall material here

66
00:04:06,470 --> 00:04:07,700
And for the color

67
00:04:07,710 --> 00:04:10,030
I will actually choose this one here

68
00:04:10,230 --> 00:04:12,490
So in hex

69
00:04:12,490 --> 00:04:16,320
it is 0 9 0 9 1 6

70
00:04:16,930 --> 00:04:20,910
And here is the RGB code for the lighting

71
00:04:20,910 --> 00:04:23,280
We will actually just keep it as it is now

72
00:04:24,250 --> 00:04:28,900
and here we will actually add a little bit of outline as the next layer

73
00:04:29,750 --> 00:04:31,460
And for the outline color

74
00:04:31,460 --> 00:04:32,880
we will choose white

75
00:04:33,350 --> 00:04:35,590
And the width of 2 is actually fine

76
00:04:36,220 --> 00:04:38,480
And here you will choose the overlay mode

77
00:04:39,300 --> 00:04:45,650
and then we will add another material layer and this one will be an image

78
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:47,190
And for the image

79
00:04:47,190 --> 00:04:50,530
we will choose this one here from the spline library

80
00:04:51,150 --> 00:04:52,380
so this white 1 here

81
00:04:52,410 --> 00:04:53,070
And again

82
00:04:53,590 --> 00:04:59,510
we will choose the overlay mode here so that this is our raw material then

83
00:05:00,760 --> 00:05:06,240
And we can actually just also save it here in the library

84
00:05:06,450 --> 00:05:08,540
So click on the plus icon here

85
00:05:09,270 --> 00:05:12,310
and then we will call it raw material

86
00:05:13,690 --> 00:05:14,780
so like that

87
00:05:15,470 --> 00:05:18,830
And then we can also just choose it for the right wall here

88
00:05:18,840 --> 00:05:20,780
So here in the four dots

89
00:05:21,270 --> 00:05:26,500
you can just access the material library again and then choose the wall material

90
00:05:27,430 --> 00:05:27,840
So now both

91
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:30,890
both of the walls are now connected to the material

92
00:05:30,930 --> 00:05:33,540
So you can also just maybe if you want to

93
00:05:33,890 --> 00:05:36,040
you can change some properties here

94
00:05:36,040 --> 00:05:36,640
So for example

95
00:05:37,460 --> 00:05:41,560
maybe I don't want the image to be like 100% opacity

96
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:44,100
so I can also choose like 50%

97
00:05:44,650 --> 00:05:49,110
So it gets changed immediately while I'm entering the new value here

98
00:05:50,040 --> 00:05:53,360
Soand then we will actually just continue with our floor here

99
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:56,390
So click on the floor and here for the color

100
00:05:56,390 --> 00:05:58,040
we will choose this one

101
00:05:58,090 --> 00:05:59,350
This is in hex

102
00:05:59,350 --> 00:06:05,960
it is 0 7 0 8 and 1 3 and an RGB code at this one here

103
00:06:05,960 --> 00:06:08,070
So just copy that from the video here maybe

104
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:11,060
And the lighting layer

105
00:06:11,080 --> 00:06:12,180
we will just again

106
00:06:12,190 --> 00:06:13,400
keep it as it is

107
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:20,210
And now we will actually introduce another layer here and this one will be a matte cap

108
00:06:20,700 --> 00:06:21,990
And for the matte cap

109
00:06:22,210 --> 00:06:25,180
we will choose this one from the spline library

110
00:06:25,200 --> 00:06:26,440
so the white 1 here

111
00:06:27,020 --> 00:06:28,570
and for the blending mode

112
00:06:28,620 --> 00:06:33,500
we will actually use Multiply so it gets dark again here

113
00:06:33,880 --> 00:06:35,350
And then on top

114
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:37,810
we will again place the image here

115
00:06:37,820 --> 00:06:38,580
So again

116
00:06:38,980 --> 00:06:40,040
from the spline line

117
00:06:40,220 --> 00:06:44,260
we choose this material or this image here

118
00:06:44,450 --> 00:06:45,540
And for the blending mode

119
00:06:46,010 --> 00:06:47,780
we will use overlay

120
00:06:49,750 --> 00:06:51,360
So now if you render the scene

121
00:06:51,370 --> 00:06:53,830
it looks kind of like that here

122
00:06:53,830 --> 00:06:56,580
so not so special by now

123
00:06:56,590 --> 00:06:59,760
but we will go there to the end

124
00:07:02,370 --> 00:07:02,690
Okay

125
00:07:02,690 --> 00:07:06,330
and now we can start to work on the portal here

126
00:07:06,390 --> 00:07:07,470
So for the portal

127
00:07:07,700 --> 00:07:15,790
I will actually just duplicate this layer here and I will give it a name to inner portal

128
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:19,960
And the ellipse 2 will be renamed to outer portal

129
00:07:21,070 --> 00:07:24,980
And why we do that is because of the usage of particles

130
00:07:25,830 --> 00:07:27,430
This will be explained later on

131
00:07:27,430 --> 00:07:29,500
So just do the step here

132
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:31,480
And for the inner portal

133
00:07:31,810 --> 00:07:35,060
we will use a size of 100 here

134
00:07:37,790 --> 00:07:39,440
And both x and y

135
00:07:39,460 --> 00:07:42,250
I will actually just hide this one for now

136
00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:47,590
The second or auto portal and zoom in a little bit

137
00:07:48,110 --> 00:07:49,050
And for the ring

138
00:07:49,050 --> 00:07:51,730
we will choose a value of 95

139
00:07:51,820 --> 00:07:52,810
And for the extrusion

140
00:07:52,810 --> 00:07:54,920
we will use 10 here

141
00:07:55,020 --> 00:07:57,300
And then also give it a little bit of bevel

142
00:07:58,070 --> 00:08:00,450
And then you can also increase the bevel 0

143
00:08:02,990 --> 00:08:03,420
Alright

144
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,880
soand then for the auto portal

145
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,190
make sure to make it visible here again

146
00:08:08,880 --> 00:08:10,370
And here for the values

147
00:08:10,370 --> 00:08:18,240
we will choose the size of 115 and both x and y and a ring of 86

148
00:08:22,270 --> 00:08:23,870
The angle is just fine

149
00:08:24,390 --> 00:08:25,590
as well as the sides here

150
00:08:25,590 --> 00:08:26,620
And for the extrusion

151
00:08:26,950 --> 00:08:29,350
we will choose 14

152
00:08:30,660 --> 00:08:31,220
And again

153
00:08:31,220 --> 00:08:33,460
make sure to increase the Beverly here to maybe

154
00:08:33,730 --> 00:08:34,240
I don't know

155
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:39,320
something like 40 or 30 and also increase the bevel sizes here a little bit

156
00:08:40,260 --> 00:08:42,800
So if you look at the view now

157
00:08:43,450 --> 00:08:45,840
make sure that it's actually centered here

158
00:08:46,820 --> 00:08:52,140
That inner portal is actually in alignment here with the outer portal

159
00:08:53,520 --> 00:09:00,870
So make sure that you have a gap here on both sides as well as on the right and left side

160
00:09:01,300 --> 00:09:02,910
For the material of the inner portal

161
00:09:03,010 --> 00:09:06,800
we will just use the same material as for the floor here

162
00:09:08,010 --> 00:09:11,670
maybe just click on the floor here and also save this material

163
00:09:11,990 --> 00:09:15,220
You can just do this again as before you

164
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:17,430
So just give it a name here

165
00:09:17,430 --> 00:09:20,350
maybe floor material

166
00:09:22,390 --> 00:09:25,530
And now we can also choose it here from the library

167
00:09:25,820 --> 00:09:26,930
So for the inner portal

168
00:09:26,930 --> 00:09:29,620
just choose the floor material here

169
00:09:32,760 --> 00:09:34,530
And for the outer portal

170
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:38,470
we will use a little bit of a different material here

171
00:09:38,590 --> 00:09:40,440
So we give it a blue color

172
00:09:40,790 --> 00:09:42,370
So the x code here is 2

173
00:09:42,370 --> 00:09:44,750
43D 4 8

174
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:47,120
or in RGB again here

175
00:09:47,130 --> 00:09:47,620
this one

176
00:09:47,620 --> 00:09:48,470
you can just copy it

177
00:09:49,410 --> 00:09:50,410
For the lighting

178
00:09:50,420 --> 00:09:54,360
we will use the physical lighting method here

179
00:09:54,580 --> 00:09:56,120
And then on top of it

180
00:09:56,430 --> 00:09:58,150
we will place again

181
00:09:58,160 --> 00:10:01,690
our image here from the spline library

182
00:10:01,800 --> 00:10:03,740
So this one and here

183
00:10:03,740 --> 00:10:07,330
make sure to choose the blending mode overlay

184
00:10:07,470 --> 00:10:11,570
And you can also reduce the opacity here to 50

185
00:10:11,740 --> 00:10:12,120
So

186
00:10:12,120 --> 00:10:14,740
and to get the functionality here of our portal

187
00:10:14,750 --> 00:10:19,340
we will now use the particle effects or the particle functionality

188
00:10:19,560 --> 00:10:20,940
So to do so

189
00:10:20,940 --> 00:10:25,110
we will maybe just add a particle emitter for now

190
00:10:26,370 --> 00:10:28,840
So it looks kind of like that

191
00:10:29,290 --> 00:10:32,830
And here we will maybe just change the colors for now

192
00:10:33,530 --> 00:10:38,980
Maybe some blue here and some lighter blue

193
00:10:39,820 --> 00:10:40,970
maybe like this

194
00:10:42,040 --> 00:10:44,060
And for the coloring mode

195
00:10:44,060 --> 00:10:45,370
we will use random

196
00:10:46,090 --> 00:10:46,880
For the size

197
00:10:46,890 --> 00:10:49,270
we will use maybe something like 3

198
00:10:49,270 --> 00:10:53,560
so just a small that here maybe

199
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:55,920
And for the birth rate

200
00:10:56,030 --> 00:10:59,650
we will increase this to 1500

201
00:11:00,830 --> 00:11:02,880
The lifetime of one second is alright

202
00:11:03,150 --> 00:11:07,610
as well as the fade out and also the speed

203
00:11:07,610 --> 00:11:08,950
Can we will

204
00:11:08,950 --> 00:11:11,450
we will just keep the speed for now here

205
00:11:11,460 --> 00:11:17,360
So this one should be fine and for the emitter we will choose now a custom object

206
00:11:18,610 --> 00:11:23,130
So in this custom object will now be our inner portal

207
00:11:24,440 --> 00:11:26,020
So it looks like that now

208
00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:32,360
And now we actually want that all of the particles are now sucked in into the portal

209
00:11:32,470 --> 00:11:33,610
And to do so

210
00:11:33,620 --> 00:11:38,360
we can get this done by using the particle forces here

211
00:11:38,450 --> 00:11:40,480
So add this one to your scene

212
00:11:41,030 --> 00:11:43,990
Now we have a particle emitter and a particle force

213
00:11:44,600 --> 00:11:46,600
And for the force type here

214
00:11:46,610 --> 00:11:48,310
we will choose a tractor

215
00:11:49,020 --> 00:11:55,220
And what this does is you see is it sucks all particles in now to this little box

216
00:11:55,910 --> 00:11:58,130
And we can also change this one

217
00:11:58,130 --> 00:11:59,930
So it doesn't have to be a box

218
00:11:59,940 --> 00:12:01,940
it can also be a sphere here

219
00:12:02,310 --> 00:12:06,510
And now we can also reduce the size here

220
00:12:06,680 --> 00:12:11,540
So I will maybe just use one here in every direction

221
00:12:13,470 --> 00:12:15,060
So maybe like that

222
00:12:15,700 --> 00:12:19,740
I will just lower the damping here maybe a little bit for now

223
00:12:21,700 --> 00:12:25,370
And now I will actually just center this one here

224
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:27,520
So I will try to move it

225
00:12:28,930 --> 00:12:29,700
It is the middle

226
00:12:29,700 --> 00:12:32,350
I will not resize it

227
00:12:32,350 --> 00:12:36,940
but I only move it so a little bit up here

228
00:12:36,940 --> 00:12:38,830
so it's in the center

229
00:12:41,190 --> 00:12:42,220
So like that

230
00:12:42,790 --> 00:12:44,070
Alrightand for the range

231
00:12:44,070 --> 00:12:47,210
you can just leave it on infinite here

232
00:12:47,530 --> 00:12:48,850
And for the intensity

233
00:12:48,850 --> 00:12:52,290
we will choose a value of 0．89

234
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:54,580
And for the damping

235
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:57,140
we will use 0．56 here

236
00:12:58,600 --> 00:12:59,620
So like that

237
00:13:00,340 --> 00:13:00,890
All right

238
00:13:00,890 --> 00:13:03,950
then we will head back over to our particle emitter here

239
00:13:03,960 --> 00:13:05,310
because as you see now

240
00:13:05,310 --> 00:13:06,430
this is kind of

241
00:13:07,260 --> 00:13:10,660
yeahnot really aligned the to the inner portal here

242
00:13:11,710 --> 00:13:15,120
Soand now we only have to align it to the center here

243
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:19,650
So make sure that you are camera is aligned here to the center

244
00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:26,310
And now we will just move it here so it doesn't exceed the boundaries anymore

245
00:13:26,350 --> 00:13:27,530
So maybe like that

246
00:13:28,050 --> 00:13:30,970
And this is mainly what the outer ring is for

247
00:13:30,970 --> 00:13:35,920
So if you imagine how we will hide the outer outer portal ring

248
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:44,530
you now see that it's quite hard to make this one not exceed the boundaries because there's a little bit of

249
00:13:45,700 --> 00:13:47,230
yeahfluctuation in this

250
00:13:47,240 --> 00:13:54,080
So we will use this auto portal ring actually to hide all of the noise here from the particle emitter

251
00:13:55,320 --> 00:13:58,960
Soand this is it now basically for the portal here

252
00:13:58,960 --> 00:13:59,740
So the portal anime

253
00:14:00,570 --> 00:14:04,420
we can maybe just play around a little bit with the colors

254
00:14:04,420 --> 00:14:05,050
for example

255
00:14:05,170 --> 00:14:07,590
So I like it to be a little bit more dark

256
00:14:07,590 --> 00:14:09,910
maybe so like that

257
00:14:11,280 --> 00:14:13,390
and this looks very good for now

258
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:17,920
Now we will add a little extra animation here

259
00:14:17,930 --> 00:14:20,130
So we will in detail

260
00:14:20,130 --> 00:14:25,570
place a point light here that will rotate around the inner portal ring here

261
00:14:25,700 --> 00:14:28,640
So for a little nice animation here

262
00:14:29,090 --> 00:14:30,270
And to do this

263
00:14:30,280 --> 00:14:35,630
we will maybe just place a point light here inside of the portal

264
00:14:36,380 --> 00:14:40,820
So now the scene will just be lightened up a little bit

265
00:14:41,820 --> 00:14:43,510
so maybe like that

266
00:14:44,620 --> 00:14:45,940
And for the color light

267
00:14:45,940 --> 00:14:48,070
we will choose a blue 1

268
00:14:49,130 --> 00:14:50,330
So maybe like that

269
00:14:53,330 --> 00:14:54,600
And for the intensity

270
00:14:54,630 --> 00:14:58,320
we will actually make it to 10 years or very high

271
00:14:58,710 --> 00:15:00,700
And for the distance

272
00:15:00,700 --> 00:15:05,610
we will reduce it a little bit to maybe something like 400 or 500

273
00:15:06,500 --> 00:15:07,980
And for the DK

274
00:15:08,120 --> 00:15:10,630
we will also use a value of 10 here

275
00:15:12,270 --> 00:15:14,520
So this will be our point light then

276
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,930
And now to get this rotation done

277
00:15:19,250 --> 00:15:24,530
we have to place another ellipse here inside of the portal

278
00:15:24,710 --> 00:15:30,340
And this one will be set to 75 in both directions

279
00:15:33,630 --> 00:15:34,430
So like that

280
00:15:35,540 --> 00:15:36,410
And then again

281
00:15:36,410 --> 00:15:40,400
make sure that it's kind of centered here

282
00:15:42,510 --> 00:15:43,180
So like that

283
00:15:47,540 --> 00:15:48,180
Alright

284
00:15:48,700 --> 00:15:52,190
and now the magic happens when we convert it to power here

285
00:15:52,600 --> 00:15:54,190
So now it looks like that

286
00:15:54,360 --> 00:15:55,850
So it doesn't matter really

287
00:15:56,300 --> 00:16:01,160
So we will just reduce the size here to 0．01

288
00:16:01,620 --> 00:16:08,420
and then we will also change the opacity here for the material to zero so you don't see the path anymore

289
00:16:09,320 --> 00:16:12,900
So now we have an invisible path here

290
00:16:12,910 --> 00:16:15,390
which is in the form of an ellipse

291
00:16:15,960 --> 00:16:20,110
And now we can actually make use of the align to power function

292
00:16:20,600 --> 00:16:23,980
So if we head back over to a point light here

293
00:16:24,990 --> 00:16:27,930
we can actually align it here to the path

294
00:16:28,180 --> 00:16:31,530
So this is the ellipse we just created now

295
00:16:31,530 --> 00:16:32,640
if we choose this

296
00:16:33,030 --> 00:16:37,540
we now have connected the point light here to the ellipse path

297
00:16:38,040 --> 00:16:40,390
And now if I change the offset here

298
00:16:40,400 --> 00:16:45,390
you now see that the light is rotating around the portal

299
00:16:46,860 --> 00:16:48,980
And based on this functionality

300
00:16:48,980 --> 00:16:51,640
we can make a new state here

301
00:16:52,440 --> 00:16:55,420
So click on the plus icon and create a new state

302
00:16:55,940 --> 00:16:57,420
And for the base state

303
00:16:57,420 --> 00:16:59,460
we will just keep it as it is now

304
00:17:00,070 --> 00:17:01,710
And for the second state

305
00:17:01,720 --> 00:17:05,480
we then we will use a value offset of one

306
00:17:06,170 --> 00:17:09,220
So it makes one full rotation here

307
00:17:09,920 --> 00:17:11,890
And based on this rotation

308
00:17:11,900 --> 00:17:15,710
we can create a new start or a transition event here

309
00:17:15,710 --> 00:17:16,520
So by start

310
00:17:16,520 --> 00:17:18,490
we will trigger a transition

311
00:17:19,070 --> 00:17:26,230
and this transition will be done from the base state to the state

312
00:17:27,040 --> 00:17:28,240
And for the time

313
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:31,300
we can maybe use 0．9 seconds

314
00:17:31,680 --> 00:17:35,030
And what is important now is to choose a linear transition

315
00:17:37,970 --> 00:17:40,360
And for the loop we will use in

316
00:17:42,610 --> 00:17:43,180
And now

317
00:17:43,190 --> 00:17:46,570
if I am now running the scene

318
00:17:46,780 --> 00:17:50,750
you will now see this rotational animation

319
00:17:52,260 --> 00:17:52,640
So

320
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:54,940
and maybe some fine adjustments from here

321
00:17:55,030 --> 00:17:58,570
I don't really like that the color is

322
00:17:58,580 --> 00:18:00,500
So yeah

323
00:18:00,500 --> 00:18:01,790
like shining on the background

324
00:18:01,790 --> 00:18:07,790
So I will maybe lower the distance a little bit to something like 450

325
00:18:08,190 --> 00:18:09,050
And also

326
00:18:09,050 --> 00:18:12,380
I will just deactivate the shadows from the light

327
00:18:12,690 --> 00:18:13,800
So it looks like that

328
00:18:15,350 --> 00:18:22,390
So this is fine for now because we will just move the back wall here a little bit

329
00:18:23,510 --> 00:18:25,620
Yeahso this side here

330
00:18:25,970 --> 00:18:32,840
and make sure that it's still connected to both floor and left wall here

331
00:18:34,020 --> 00:18:35,850
So now if we're running the scene again

332
00:18:36,220 --> 00:18:39,430
you now see this little nice animation here

333
00:18:40,190 --> 00:18:44,170
So now we have built the basic functionality of our scene

334
00:18:44,270 --> 00:18:46,220
And for again

335
00:18:46,220 --> 00:18:47,100
better understanding

336
00:18:47,100 --> 00:18:50,830
I will just quickly rename everything we just created

337
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:52,380
So for the particle emitter

338
00:18:52,610 --> 00:18:54,990
I will maybe choose the name

339
00:19:00,110 --> 00:19:00,950
Portal bullets

340
00:19:00,950 --> 00:19:01,410
maybe

341
00:19:02,650 --> 00:19:13,920
And then we name the particle force to portal force the point light to rotating light

342
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:19,800
And the ellipse here to light path

343
00:19:22,710 --> 00:19:25,180
Soand all of those things

344
00:19:25,190 --> 00:19:27,930
we will actually grew up here

345
00:19:28,620 --> 00:19:31,260
as well as the outer portal and inner portal part

346
00:19:31,670 --> 00:19:35,180
So just select everything and then hit command and G

347
00:19:35,920 --> 00:19:39,080
and now this will be just named to portal

348
00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:44,530
Now you can just drag everything here together

349
00:19:44,540 --> 00:19:45,610
up and down

350
00:19:47,740 --> 00:19:49,510
So we will do this now

351
00:19:51,080 --> 00:19:55,750
Soand now we can actually try to clean up the scene a little bit

352
00:19:56,140 --> 00:19:57,830
And for this 1

353
00:19:57,830 --> 00:20:00,020
I will bring up the floor maybe

354
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:06,100
So it's more nearer to the portal here

355
00:20:07,010 --> 00:20:07,560
So maybe

356
00:20:07,560 --> 00:20:09,480
maybe like that here

357
00:20:09,670 --> 00:20:12,150
And also the back bowl here

358
00:20:12,160 --> 00:20:17,000
just the right ball we have to bring up in front here

359
00:20:17,180 --> 00:20:21,060
So it's connected to everything as well as the left wall here

360
00:20:21,060 --> 00:20:29,440
So we have a little nice edge here and also realign the portal maybe a little bit

361
00:20:31,370 --> 00:20:32,230
So maybe like that

362
00:20:33,880 --> 00:20:36,990
And maybe for the floor material

363
00:20:36,990 --> 00:20:39,770
I will make it a little bit darker maybe

364
00:20:42,040 --> 00:20:42,620
For this

365
00:20:42,650 --> 00:20:54,000
I will actually change the foam color here to a simple black and maybe also reduce the image opacity here by maybe 25%

366
00:20:54,010 --> 00:20:54,980
So like that

367
00:20:56,130 --> 00:21:04,120
And actually I will bring this up a little bit here and maybe some fine adjustments for the floor

368
00:21:04,130 --> 00:21:08,040
I actually want that it's a little bit darker than the walls here

369
00:21:09,160 --> 00:21:13,370
I will maybe just change the front color here to a single black

370
00:21:14,630 --> 00:21:16,500
And maybe for the image opacity

371
00:21:16,850 --> 00:21:19,300
we will go with 70 here

372
00:21:19,800 --> 00:21:22,290
And now also for some details

373
00:21:22,300 --> 00:21:29,520
we will make like a little staircase here where the portal actually is standing on

374
00:21:29,710 --> 00:21:30,900
So to do that

375
00:21:31,020 --> 00:21:37,130
we can just take simple squares here maybe or cubes

376
00:21:38,680 --> 00:21:41,670
and just place it here on the floor

377
00:21:42,500 --> 00:21:44,040
reduce the corners here

378
00:21:44,810 --> 00:21:50,530
and then maybe rearrange the view real quick

379
00:21:51,520 --> 00:21:57,220
and then just drag it A in a staircase

380
00:21:59,340 --> 00:22:00,590
Geometry here

381
00:22:00,890 --> 00:22:03,350
So maybe I will just duplicate them here

382
00:22:04,460 --> 00:22:05,110
So like that

383
00:22:06,110 --> 00:22:11,040
then make one stair after another Sta

384
00:22:13,880 --> 00:22:13,990
Like that

385
00:22:17,120 --> 00:22:19,620
And then I will select everything

386
00:22:19,750 --> 00:22:20,800
group it up

387
00:22:21,600 --> 00:22:24,720
and give it the name stairs here

388
00:22:30,870 --> 00:22:31,070
Okay

389
00:22:31,070 --> 00:22:33,850
now let's check how this looks here

390
00:22:34,450 --> 00:22:44,490
So we also have to make sure that the front view is actually aligned and also increase the width of the staircase a little bit

391
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:46,380
So like that

392
00:22:48,920 --> 00:22:52,840
And maybe a little bit smaller in the height

393
00:22:55,350 --> 00:22:59,390
So this should look very nice here

394
00:23:00,110 --> 00:23:01,780
And for the material

395
00:23:01,780 --> 00:23:05,090
we just use the same one as for the floor

396
00:23:05,090 --> 00:23:06,460
So just the floor material here

397
00:23:07,290 --> 00:23:09,960
So we have a little nice dark look here

398
00:23:10,660 --> 00:23:16,230
Maybe I will decrease the height a little bit more like that

399
00:23:17,640 --> 00:23:18,300
So again

400
00:23:18,300 --> 00:23:19,060
make sure that your

401
00:23:21,450 --> 00:23:23,370
Alignment is correct all the time

402
00:23:24,440 --> 00:23:26,720
And maybe for some more details

403
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:28,300
we can also like

404
00:23:28,300 --> 00:23:29,320
for instance

405
00:23:29,330 --> 00:23:30,460
add railing here

406
00:23:30,470 --> 00:23:37,950
So maybe just choose the rectangle to and place it onto the stairs here

407
00:23:40,850 --> 00:23:46,570
Just increase the size so it fits to the staircase

408
00:23:47,050 --> 00:23:47,640
So like that

409
00:23:49,100 --> 00:23:50,540
And maybe for extrusion

410
00:23:50,540 --> 00:23:52,620
we can just go with two here

411
00:23:52,860 --> 00:23:56,140
And I also want the rounded top left corner here

412
00:23:56,310 --> 00:23:59,670
so can maybe go with the Note 20

413
00:23:59,670 --> 00:24:00,790
Yeah20 looks good

414
00:24:02,700 --> 00:24:08,430
And then we have a railing here and for the material

415
00:24:08,690 --> 00:24:14,460
maybemaybe some glass that would look very nice

416
00:24:14,700 --> 00:24:16,830
So just use the glass layer here

417
00:24:17,050 --> 00:24:26,400
bring it to the first position and the color to the last one here and choose the overlay function

418
00:24:28,340 --> 00:24:30,460
So this looks like that for now

419
00:24:30,640 --> 00:24:34,080
And I will actually use the white overlay here

420
00:24:34,690 --> 00:24:41,830
maybe a little less so 80 in opacity and also add some outline baby

421
00:24:43,500 --> 00:24:44,170
so we

422
00:24:46,500 --> 00:24:49,170
Outline and also in white

423
00:24:51,460 --> 00:24:53,690
And the width of 2 is also fine

424
00:24:53,700 --> 00:24:55,760
And then you can choose the overlay function

425
00:24:58,160 --> 00:24:59,640
And maybe for the glass

426
00:24:59,650 --> 00:25:03,320
we could play around with the settings here

427
00:25:04,210 --> 00:25:06,230
So maybe a little bit more blur

428
00:25:08,480 --> 00:25:10,950
So just like that

429
00:25:11,100 --> 00:25:11,550
maybe

430
00:25:12,200 --> 00:25:15,610
So I will go with a blur of 21 here

431
00:25:16,470 --> 00:25:17,080
And again

432
00:25:17,080 --> 00:25:19,280
I will save this material or no

433
00:25:19,620 --> 00:25:24,340
I will save the material in our materials and assets library here

434
00:25:24,660 --> 00:25:29,600
So click the plus icon and then just call it class

435
00:25:31,640 --> 00:25:32,230
All right

436
00:25:33,320 --> 00:25:35,760
and now we can just duplicate this one

437
00:25:35,760 --> 00:25:47,500
I will quickly rename it to glass railing and duplicate it and then bring it also to the left side here

438
00:25:51,870 --> 00:25:52,900
So like that

439
00:25:57,790 --> 00:26:00,120
And the alignment is a little bit off

440
00:26:00,370 --> 00:26:01,890
I think

441
00:26:03,790 --> 00:26:07,610
And then just move it here to the left side a little bit

442
00:26:09,790 --> 00:26:15,480
Soand then finally also bring the whole portal down here to the staircase

443
00:26:16,630 --> 00:26:17,570
So like that

444
00:26:18,490 --> 00:26:23,700
Now if you rearrange the view and maybe also just play the animation

445
00:26:23,700 --> 00:26:25,460
now this looks really

446
00:26:25,460 --> 00:26:25,860
really good

447
00:26:28,090 --> 00:26:31,120
And now maybe for some even mo​‌​‌​​‌‌​​‌‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌​​‌‌‌​​‌​​‌‌​​‌‌​​‌‌‌​​‌​​‌‌‌​​‌‌‌​‌​‌​‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌​‌‌​​​‌‌‌‌‌‌​​‌‌‌​​‌‌‌​‌​‌​‌​​‌‌‌​‌‌​​‌‌​​​‌​​‌‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌‌​​‌​​‌‌​​​‌​​‌‌​‌‌​​​‌‌​‌​‌​​‌‌​‌​‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌‌‌‌​​​‌‌‌​‌‌​​‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌​​‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌​‌‌​​​‌‌​​‌‌​​‌‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌​‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌​​​‌‌‌​​‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌‌‌‌​​​‌‌​‌‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌‌​​‌‌‌​‌​‌‌‌​​‌‌​‌‌‌‌‌​‌‌​​‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌​​​‌‌‌​​‌​​‌‌​​​‌​​‌‌​​‌‌​​‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌​‌‌‌​​‌‌‌‌‌​​​‌‌​‌‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌​‌‌​​‌‌​‌​‌‌‌​‌​‌‌‌‌‌​‌​‌​‌​​‌‌​‌‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌​‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌​‌‌​​​‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌​‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌​‌‌‌‌‌​‌​‌​‌​​‌‌​‌​‌​​‌‌​‌​‌‌‌​‌‌​​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌‌​​‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌​​‌‌‌​​‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌​‌‌‌​​‌‌‌​​‌‌‌​‌​‌‌‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌​​‌​​‌‌​‌‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌​‌‌​​‌‌​​‌‌​​‌‌​‌​‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌​‌​‌‌‌​‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌​‌‌​​​‌‌​‌‌‌​​‌‌‌​​‌​​‌‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌​‌‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌​​​‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌​​‌​​‌‌​‌​‌‌‌​‌​‌‌‌​​‌‌​‌‌​​​‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌​‌‌‌​​‌‌‌‌‌​​​‌‌​‌​‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌‌​​‌‌‌​‌​‌‌‌‌‌​‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌‌​​‌‌‌‌‌‌​​‌‌​‌‌‌​​‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌‌​​‌​​‌‌​​‌‌​​‌‌‌​​‌​​‌‌‌​​‌​​‌‌​‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌re details

448
00:26:31,310 --> 00:26:35,710
I will actually in a little light strip here

449
00:26:35,710 --> 00:26:39,870
which is indicating the way to the portal

450
00:26:40,950 --> 00:26:43,940
I will make it a little bit thinner here

451
00:26:46,150 --> 00:26:48,070
I like that

452
00:26:51,440 --> 00:26:53,570
Connect it to the staircase here

453
00:26:55,550 --> 00:26:56,320
maybe even longer

454
00:27:05,990 --> 00:27:08,400
And then try to align it here again to the middle

455
00:27:14,320 --> 00:27:15,490
And then for the color

456
00:27:15,490 --> 00:27:17,860
we will choose the light blue

457
00:27:17,860 --> 00:27:18,480
maybe

458
00:27:19,890 --> 00:27:20,650
So like that

459
00:27:23,260 --> 00:27:25,330
And maybe we could also just

460
00:27:25,480 --> 00:27:26,700
yeahcontinue this

461
00:27:27,040 --> 00:27:29,260
the stripe here also to the staircase

462
00:27:29,690 --> 00:27:35,500
So maybe we will just duplicate the stairs here and then

463
00:27:37,510 --> 00:27:39,710
Resize it to the width of the stripe

464
00:27:44,510 --> 00:27:49,010
I will zoom in a little to make it as precise as I can

465
00:27:49,900 --> 00:27:51,730
I could also choose a value here

466
00:27:51,730 --> 00:27:57,060
but I will just do it here by the look in here

467
00:27:57,770 --> 00:27:58,620
So like that

468
00:28:01,110 --> 00:28:05,860
And then I will quickly rename it to light strip

469
00:28:08,330 --> 00:28:12,090
And quickly also copy the color code here

470
00:28:14,870 --> 00:28:18,220
And rename the stairs to two colors stairs

471
00:28:20,200 --> 00:28:23,830
And here I will unlink the material

472
00:28:24,330 --> 00:28:25,930
Just delete the upper one

473
00:28:25,930 --> 00:28:27,380
so the image and the matte cap

474
00:28:28,010 --> 00:28:29,150
And for the color

475
00:28:29,450 --> 00:28:31,570
I will choose yes

476
00:28:31,630 --> 00:28:33,730
light blue value here

477
00:28:34,080 --> 00:28:35,810
And then slightly

478
00:28:36,600 --> 00:28:40,310
just bring up this element

479
00:28:42,060 --> 00:28:45,920
And now we have a nice little light strip here

480
00:28:45,940 --> 00:28:49,940
which is also overlaid to the staircase here

481
00:28:51,260 --> 00:28:54,930
And now you may see that this light strip here is a little bit

482
00:28:56,070 --> 00:28:57,510
yeahof position here

483
00:28:58,560 --> 00:29:03,900
I will maybe just give it some extrusion and bring it down to the floor here

484
00:29:05,880 --> 00:29:09,390
So it just barely looks up

485
00:29:17,770 --> 00:29:20,820
And now this just looks fine now

486
00:29:21,440 --> 00:29:26,390
And now for you guys that are even more interested in adding some detail to this scene

487
00:29:26,470 --> 00:29:34,060
we could also maybe like add an animation where some obstacles are driving in the portal here

488
00:29:34,920 --> 00:29:36,080
And to do so

489
00:29:36,080 --> 00:29:39,430
I will maybe just draw a path here on the strip

490
00:29:40,990 --> 00:29:44,270
So I choose the vector to for at first

491
00:29:45,120 --> 00:29:47,720
and then just draw a line here

492
00:29:47,720 --> 00:29:47,760
maybe

493
00:29:49,390 --> 00:29:53,330
And now you can imagine that we have a stair here

494
00:29:53,340 --> 00:29:55,590
Then we have a little distance

495
00:29:55,830 --> 00:29:57,600
Againthe stare

496
00:29:57,770 --> 00:29:58,640
the distance

497
00:29:59,430 --> 00:29:59,950
the stare

498
00:30:00,720 --> 00:30:02,480
and then again some distance

499
00:30:03,280 --> 00:30:10,680
And why I'm saying that is because now if we change the view here and we have our shape created

500
00:30:11,030 --> 00:30:13,240
we can now convert it to power view

501
00:30:15,280 --> 00:30:20,900
And then I will quickly just delete the size here and also

502
00:30:23,810 --> 00:30:26,720
Reduce opacity to 0

503
00:30:27,880 --> 00:30:30,000
And now when I edit the path here

504
00:30:30,150 --> 00:30:32,080
I now see all the dots here

505
00:30:33,180 --> 00:30:35,680
And maybe for a better view

506
00:30:35,680 --> 00:30:39,680
I will just quickly hi​‌​‌​​‌‌​​‌‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌​​‌‌‌​​‌​​‌‌​​‌‌​​‌‌‌​​‌​​‌‌‌​​‌‌‌​‌​‌​‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌​‌‌​​​‌‌‌‌‌‌​​‌‌‌​​‌‌‌​‌​‌​‌​​‌‌‌​‌‌​​‌‌​​​‌​​‌‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌‌​​‌​​‌‌​​​‌​​‌‌​‌‌​​​‌‌​‌​‌​​‌‌​‌​‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌‌‌‌​​​‌‌‌​‌‌​​‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌​​‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌​‌‌​​​‌‌​​‌‌​​‌‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌​‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌​​​‌‌‌​​‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌‌‌‌​​​‌‌​‌‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌‌​​‌‌‌​‌​‌‌‌​​‌‌​‌‌‌‌‌​‌‌​​‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌​​​‌‌‌​​‌​​‌‌​​​‌​​‌‌​​‌‌​​‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌​‌‌‌​​‌‌‌‌‌​​​‌‌​‌‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌​‌‌​​‌‌​‌​‌‌‌​‌​‌‌‌‌‌​‌​‌​‌​​‌‌​‌‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌​‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌​‌‌​​​‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌​‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌​‌‌‌‌‌​‌​‌​‌​​‌‌​‌​‌​​‌‌​‌​‌‌‌​‌‌​​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌‌​​‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌​​‌‌‌​​‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌​‌‌‌​​‌‌‌​​‌‌‌​‌​‌‌‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌​​‌​​‌‌​‌‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌​‌‌​​‌‌​​‌‌​​‌‌​‌​‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌​‌​‌‌‌​‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌​‌‌​​​‌‌​‌‌‌​​‌‌‌​​‌​​‌‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌​‌‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌​​​‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌​​‌​​‌‌​‌​‌‌‌​‌​‌‌‌​​‌‌​‌‌​​​‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌​‌‌‌​​‌‌‌‌‌​​​‌‌​‌​‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌‌​​‌‌‌​‌​‌‌‌‌‌​‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌‌​​‌‌‌‌‌‌​​‌‌​‌‌‌​​‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌‌​​‌​​‌‌​​‌‌​​‌‌‌​​‌​​‌‌‌​​‌​​‌‌​‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌de the glass railing

507
00:30:39,900 --> 00:30:40,980
So now you see it

508
00:30:42,020 --> 00:30:45,220
And now I can just drag those points

509
00:30:47,250 --> 00:30:52,810
And create this little staircase here with the pathing tool

510
00:30:54,040 --> 00:30:56,770
So just drag it a little bit

511
00:30:59,860 --> 00:31:04,450
Upso it creates a gap in between the stairs and the path

512
00:31:06,580 --> 00:31:08,080
Doesn't have to be really precise

513
00:31:08,610 --> 00:31:09,930
but maybe just like that

514
00:31:17,940 --> 00:31:18,320
All right

515
00:31:18,330 --> 00:31:20,720
now we have the path created here

516
00:31:21,390 --> 00:31:23,190
And I will quickly just

517
00:31:25,210 --> 00:31:27,540
Yeahactivate the gloves railing again

518
00:31:28,280 --> 00:31:29,560
And then

519
00:31:31,860 --> 00:31:33,610
I will place maybe

520
00:31:36,070 --> 00:31:38,840
A little triangle here on top

521
00:31:39,780 --> 00:31:44,520
Give the rotation so it's facing in front of the portal

522
00:31:48,630 --> 00:31:50,870
And also give it some corners maybe

523
00:31:51,360 --> 00:31:51,800
So like that

524
00:31:51,910 --> 00:31:54,470
It looks like a navigation arrow here

525
00:31:54,470 --> 00:31:55,100
So I like that

526
00:31:57,380 --> 00:31:59,070
And also give it a little bit of extrusion

527
00:32:00,060 --> 00:32:01,060
maybe like that here

528
00:32:03,270 --> 00:32:04,060
Just a little bevel

529
00:32:05,180 --> 00:32:06,360
maybe just one here

530
00:32:07,010 --> 00:32:07,370
All right

531
00:32:08,200 --> 00:32:11,390
and then we bring this down here

532
00:32:13,850 --> 00:32:16,020
And in the middle of the triangle

533
00:32:16,020 --> 00:32:18,010
we will add a point light

534
00:32:20,040 --> 00:32:21,600
So choose point light here

535
00:32:22,580 --> 00:32:26,540
And I will just rearrange to a bird eye view

536
00:32:27,400 --> 00:32:31,970
And I don't know where the light is off

537
00:32:33,280 --> 00:32:41,220
So here I will just bring it to this side and then try to center it here

538
00:32:41,800 --> 00:32:45,270
side of the triangle in the bird's eye view

539
00:32:45,280 --> 00:32:46,230
but also

540
00:32:48,380 --> 00:32:49,640
On the right view here

541
00:32:49,770 --> 00:32:50,940
So maybe like that

542
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:52,640
And for the color

543
00:32:52,640 --> 00:33:00,990
againI will choose some light blue and increase the decay and reduce distance something

544
00:33:03,170 --> 00:33:03,450
Like that

545
00:33:04,160 --> 00:33:06,310
Maybe a little bit more of intensity

546
00:33:07,480 --> 00:33:11,030
So we have like a little nice shine on the ground here

547
00:33:15,970 --> 00:33:17,780
And then also for the triangle

548
00:33:18,030 --> 00:33:21,110
I will also choose a light blue color

549
00:33:24,020 --> 00:33:24,770
Yeahlike that

550
00:33:25,550 --> 00:33:27,080
Maybe give it some outline

551
00:33:29,430 --> 00:33:30,820
Which is outline here

552
00:33:31,630 --> 00:33:35,360
Maybe just white and hit overlay

553
00:33:38,570 --> 00:33:40,740
And now we will group this up

554
00:33:41,420 --> 00:33:43,730
So select triangle and point light

555
00:33:43,740 --> 00:33:45,310
group this up

556
00:33:45,700 --> 00:33:48,960
and we rename it to arrow

557
00:33:51,870 --> 00:33:52,730
And now again

558
00:33:52,730 --> 00:33:54,990
we will make use of the It to power function here

559
00:33:55,480 --> 00:33:57,080
So we will align it to path

560
00:33:57,240 --> 00:33:58,410
And for this one

561
00:33:58,410 --> 00:33:59,890
we will use the shape one

562
00:34:00,830 --> 00:34:03,930
So now it's aligned to the shape half

563
00:34:03,950 --> 00:34:05,260
We just draw it

564
00:34:07,660 --> 00:34:08,230
And again

565
00:34:08,230 --> 00:34:10,950
here we will introduce two new states

566
00:34:11,730 --> 00:34:14,520
So one state has the offset of 0

567
00:34:14,570 --> 00:34:18,250
and the second state as you offset of one

568
00:34:19,020 --> 00:34:20,310
When I'm moving this up

569
00:34:20,320 --> 00:34:21,510
you now see what it does

570
00:34:22,420 --> 00:34:23,660
It moves up the path

571
00:34:24,580 --> 00:34:29,280
maybe just like it stays in front here

572
00:34:30,820 --> 00:34:31,490
And now again

573
00:34:31,490 --> 00:34:33,340
we can just add a trigger here

574
00:34:33,340 --> 00:34:34,080
So again

575
00:34:34,080 --> 00:34:34,900
by start event

576
00:34:35,090 --> 00:34:38,240
and then we will trigger the transition here for the arrow element

577
00:34:39,360 --> 00:34:43,500
And we will do a transition from our base state to our state

578
00:34:44,500 --> 00:34:48,390
And this could take maybe like 5 seconds

579
00:34:48,910 --> 00:34:49,540
And again

580
00:34:49,540 --> 00:34:51,630
we will use a linear transition

581
00:34:53,100 --> 00:34:56,590
You could now do this by count or by inf

582
00:34:57,280 --> 00:34:59,620
I will just maybe just do it once here

583
00:35:00,010 --> 00:35:03,380
show you guys what's possible with this scene

584
00:35:05,300 --> 00:35:07,520
So maybe if I rearrange the view now

585
00:35:09,600 --> 00:35:10,220
And simulate

586
00:35:10,240 --> 00:35:15,220
Now you see the little triangle moving the to the portal

587
00:35:15,220 --> 00:35:16,130
Yeahand this

588
00:35:17,190 --> 00:35:19,310
yeahthis could be even take

589
00:35:19,520 --> 00:35:22,190
you can take this even further here by choosing

590
00:35:22,330 --> 00:35:22,720
I don't know

591
00:35:22,720 --> 00:35:25,650
iconsanything else you can imagine

592
00:35:25,650 --> 00:35:32,940
So this is less just like a little reminder of how to use the align to Cur function in combination with transition modes

593
00:35:34,750 --> 00:35:35,550
And yeah

594
00:35:36,140 --> 00:35:40,000
so I hope you like this little particle lesson here

595
00:35:40,050 --> 00:35:41,420
and I will see you in the next one
