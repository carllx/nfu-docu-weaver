1
00:00:00,190 --> 00:00:01,050
So in this video

2
00:00:01,070 --> 00:00:02,310
we will talk about particles

3
00:00:02,380 --> 00:00:05,440
so how you can create things like particle forces

4
00:00:05,440 --> 00:00:06,800
particle emitters

5
00:00:06,870 --> 00:00:11,740
and how to connect those techniques to create some different kind of animations and effects

6
00:00:11,750 --> 00:00:12,900
So let's get started

7
00:00:13,020 --> 00:00:16,630
So we are back again in our basic splines in here

8
00:00:16,630 --> 00:00:19,450
So the only thing that I changed is the background

9
00:00:19,450 --> 00:00:21,180
So this one is black now

10
00:00:21,180 --> 00:00:25,340
So you see the particles a little bit better here

11
00:00:25,550 --> 00:00:28,920
And we can also just delete our base plane here

12
00:00:28,920 --> 00:00:33,100
So we have a little noise and empty view here

13
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:35,110
So to create our first particles

14
00:00:35,150 --> 00:00:38,180
we can just go again to our top toolbar here

15
00:00:38,230 --> 00:00:39,640
click on the plus icon

16
00:00:39,720 --> 00:00:41,680
and then scroll down a little bit

17
00:00:41,730 --> 00:00:45,790
And here you see the function called particle emitter now

18
00:00:46,810 --> 00:00:48,160
And now if you click on it

19
00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:52,580
you already see some particles that are getting created here

20
00:00:52,730 --> 00:00:55,220
And I will zoom in a little bit so you see it better

21
00:00:55,760 --> 00:00:56,190
So

22
00:00:56,190 --> 00:01:00,800
and then you see on the right side there are a bunch of options popped up here

23
00:01:00,810 --> 00:01:03,990
So maybe we'll just start with the first ones here

24
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:08,430
So you get the simple option to choose the colors here for the particles

25
00:01:08,430 --> 00:01:11,020
So you have a color A and a color B code

26
00:01:11,430 --> 00:01:15,540
And maybe I will just now change this one here to blue

27
00:01:15,780 --> 00:01:21,500
And then you actually see that this color is getting from blue to yellow here

28
00:01:21,500 --> 00:01:24,960
So the bottom ones are blue and the top ones are yellow here

29
00:01:25,330 --> 00:01:27,410
And maybe if you just change the colors

30
00:01:27,420 --> 00:01:29,480
it will be vice versa

31
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:30,880
And yeah

32
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:34,320
But you also have the ability here to choose the coloring mode

33
00:01:34,500 --> 00:01:36,260
So now it's in the blending mode

34
00:01:36,270 --> 00:01:36,880
So again

35
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:39,760
it's blending from blue to yellow here

36
00:01:39,850 --> 00:01:42,620
but you also got the option here to choose random

37
00:01:43,050 --> 00:01:47,010
And now you see that some particles are yellow here

38
00:01:47,020 --> 00:01:47,660
or blue

39
00:01:47,670 --> 00:01:48,450
or even green

40
00:01:48,460 --> 00:01:52,210
So like the combination of yellow and blue here

41
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:56,150
And this is what the coloring mode random does

42
00:01:56,370 --> 00:01:57,170
Then next up

43
00:01:57,170 --> 00:01:59,170
we also have the size function here

44
00:01:59,170 --> 00:02:00,030
So for example

45
00:02:00,080 --> 00:02:01,780
if I increase this value now

46
00:02:01,780 --> 00:02:08,720
you now see that the particles are getting bigger or even smaller depending on the value of the slider here

47
00:02:09,590 --> 00:02:11,900
And you have also the ability here

48
00:02:11,910 --> 00:02:14,240
If you click on this little icon here

49
00:02:14,570 --> 00:02:20,350
you can also change the starting value here and the end value of the particle sizes

50
00:02:20,870 --> 00:02:23,130
So in this example here

51
00:02:23,130 --> 00:02:27,990
now it will start by the value of one and it ends by 50

52
00:02:27,990 --> 00:02:31,790
So it's actually getting bigger while it's yeah

53
00:02:31,790 --> 00:02:34,000
emitting from the surface here

54
00:02:34,610 --> 00:02:35,420
And next up

55
00:02:35,430 --> 00:02:37,400
we have the rotation value here

56
00:02:37,410 --> 00:02:40,760
And this simply means that while I'm increasing the value

57
00:02:40,850 --> 00:02:43,080
the particles are getting rotated

58
00:02:43,300 --> 00:02:44,150
So for example

59
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:47,870
a value of one actually means 360 degrees

60
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:50,130
So now because we have

61
00:02:50,810 --> 00:02:54,830
yeahcircle or rounded particle here

62
00:02:54,870 --> 00:02:56,510
you don't really see the rotation

63
00:02:56,510 --> 00:03:02,420
but maybe later on where we introduce some like custom particles

64
00:03:02,420 --> 00:03:03,220
you will see it better

65
00:03:03,740 --> 00:03:07,820
So I will just skip this for now and continue with the birth rate here

66
00:03:07,930 --> 00:03:12,310
So the birth rate simply means that if you increase the value

67
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:15,250
you now see that more particles are getting created

68
00:03:15,590 --> 00:03:18,300
so like born or emitted here

69
00:03:18,970 --> 00:03:21,080
And this is what the birth rate means

70
00:03:21,110 --> 00:03:24,030
So lower value of the birth rate

71
00:03:24,130 --> 00:03:26,200
which simply means less particles

72
00:03:26,210 --> 00:03:29,320
and the higher birth rate just means more particles here

73
00:03:29,330 --> 00:03:30,420
And next up

74
00:03:30,420 --> 00:03:31,560
we have the lifetime here

75
00:03:31,810 --> 00:03:32,550
So by default

76
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:34,090
it's one second

77
00:03:34,090 --> 00:03:37,440
So the S just simply stands for seconds here

78
00:03:37,580 --> 00:03:38,260
So for example

79
00:03:38,580 --> 00:03:41,100
if I choose a value of three here

80
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:48,470
you now see that the particles are actually living like 3 seconds until they are vanished here on the top

81
00:03:49,150 --> 00:03:51,330
And this is what the lifetime means

82
00:03:52,070 --> 00:03:53,010
So then next up

83
00:03:53,010 --> 00:03:55,020
we have the fading modes here

84
00:03:55,220 --> 00:03:55,860
But first

85
00:03:55,860 --> 00:03:58,930
I will actually just give every particle the same size here

86
00:03:59,170 --> 00:04:02,940
So you see the difference a little bit better in the fade mode

87
00:04:03,150 --> 00:04:05,380
So we have the alpha fade here

88
00:04:05,380 --> 00:04:10,340
and this simply means now that the particles are getting faded out here

89
00:04:10,340 --> 00:04:12,950
So just linear fade out

90
00:04:12,950 --> 00:04:16,000
So it starts by full opacity here

91
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,500
And then by the end

92
00:04:17,500 --> 00:04:19,430
you have 0 opacity

93
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:20,610
And for example

94
00:04:20,670 --> 00:04:23,090
now I can also choose like linear fading

95
00:04:23,820 --> 00:04:30,610
and now you see that it's fading in like 0 opacity here

96
00:04:30,620 --> 00:04:34,370
and then it has more opacity on the top side

97
00:04:35,480 --> 00:04:39,100
and you can also choose like fade in and fade out

98
00:04:39,220 --> 00:04:40,640
So then in the middle

99
00:04:40,640 --> 00:04:45,020
you have like the full opacity here and the bottom and the top

100
00:04:45,020 --> 00:04:45,800
it's less

101
00:04:46,550 --> 00:04:50,220
And then you also you have like the ease in and ease out function

102
00:04:51,170 --> 00:04:53,650
and you can also use a constant here

103
00:04:53,660 --> 00:04:58,660
and now you see it's a little bit more colorful because they all have a full opacity here

104
00:04:59,030 --> 00:05:01,490
And this is what the alpha fade does

105
00:05:01,910 --> 00:05:04,500
And then you also have the size fade here

106
00:05:04,510 --> 00:05:07,570
And what this does is now by default

107
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:09,340
it's a fade out here

108
00:05:09,470 --> 00:05:15,320
So you now see that the particles are actually bigger here and getting smaller on the top

109
00:05:15,510 --> 00:05:17,880
and this is because of the fade out here

110
00:05:17,940 --> 00:05:18,670
So for example

111
00:05:18,750 --> 00:05:20,830
if I am choosing the fade in mode now

112
00:05:21,610 --> 00:05:25,770
you now see that it's smaller at the beginning

113
00:05:25,770 --> 00:05:29,390
and then it's getting bigger while it's fading out here

114
00:05:30,370 --> 00:05:35,400
Then you again have also the possibility to choose fade in and out

115
00:05:35,530 --> 00:05:36,240
So again

116
00:05:36,250 --> 00:05:37,280
smallbig

117
00:05:37,290 --> 00:05:38,520
and then small again

118
00:05:39,320 --> 00:05:42,120
and then also ease in and ease out

119
00:05:43,030 --> 00:05:43,820
and again

120
00:05:43,830 --> 00:05:44,490
constant

121
00:05:44,490 --> 00:05:49,280
So the size just stays the same in the whole animation here

122
00:05:49,390 --> 00:05:50,300
And then next up

123
00:05:50,300 --> 00:05:51,750
you have the speed value here

124
00:05:51,750 --> 00:05:53,870
So just by increasing this value

125
00:05:54,150 --> 00:05:57,830
you now see that the particles are flying much faster here

126
00:05:57,830 --> 00:05:59,220
And by a lower value

127
00:05:59,340 --> 00:06:01,440
they are much slower here

128
00:06:01,780 --> 00:06:06,360
And you can also change the orientation mode here from axis to surface here

129
00:06:06,370 --> 00:06:07,260
So for example

130
00:06:07,260 --> 00:06:08,450
now by default

131
00:06:08,530 --> 00:06:10,330
it's the axis here

132
00:06:10,340 --> 00:06:14,100
And you have now different kind of directions to choose from

133
00:06:14,110 --> 00:06:15,030
So for example

134
00:06:15,030 --> 00:06:18,370
nowif I may go to the top view here

135
00:06:18,380 --> 00:06:21,300
you now see that the particles are getting up here

136
00:06:21,780 --> 00:06:26,540
And now maybe if I change this x value here to 90 degrees

137
00:06:26,730 --> 00:06:32,050
you now see that the particles are now flying in 90 degree expos here

138
00:06:32,580 --> 00:06:37,740
And I can just maybe use something like 180 here

139
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:42,540
So now they want to actually go down here

140
00:06:42,540 --> 00:06:44,000
But because of the gravity

141
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:49,730
actually they again fly up and then maybe 270 here

142
00:06:51,860 --> 00:06:56,370
You now see that the particles are now flying in the opposite direction

143
00:06:56,960 --> 00:07:00,560
And this is the same just for the y and that here

144
00:07:01,460 --> 00:07:04,690
And then we can just activate the surface mode here now

145
00:07:04,700 --> 00:07:07,800
And I will just go back to the front view here

146
00:07:08,300 --> 00:07:10,160
And to show this 1

147
00:07:10,170 --> 00:07:14,330
I will actually just choose another shape for the emitter here

148
00:07:14,330 --> 00:07:15,630
So not a plane

149
00:07:15,750 --> 00:07:17,710
but maybe a box here

150
00:07:17,780 --> 00:07:20,700
And now you see what the surface emitting does

151
00:07:20,760 --> 00:07:25,920
So basically now the particles are getting emitted here from the surface of the box

152
00:07:26,310 --> 00:07:27,730
And before we had a plane

153
00:07:27,730 --> 00:07:34,070
so you don't see the emitting there are quite good because of the two dimensional shape

154
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:35,860
And here with the box

155
00:07:35,860 --> 00:07:40,700
you now see that all the particles are now getting emitted from the surface here

156
00:07:41,030 --> 00:07:41,380
So

157
00:07:41,380 --> 00:07:44,990
and the last option here from the particle step is image 1

158
00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:48,730
So you can just use custom images as particles here

159
00:07:48,730 --> 00:07:49,890
So for example

160
00:07:49,890 --> 00:07:52,980
you can choose images here from the libraries

161
00:07:52,990 --> 00:07:56,250
So you have a bunch of different options to choose from

162
00:07:56,580 --> 00:07:58,250
but you can also just

163
00:07:58,260 --> 00:08:02,490
yeahuse a default image or any image you want here

164
00:08:02,650 --> 00:08:03,530
So for example

165
00:08:04,180 --> 00:08:05,980
I will use some stars here now

166
00:08:05,980 --> 00:08:07,960
which I got from this site

167
00:08:07,960 --> 00:08:14,120
So iconizer doo or any icon side or image side you want here

168
00:08:14,670 --> 00:08:17,130
And then you have custom particles here

169
00:08:17,990 --> 00:08:20,550
And then for the particle emitter functions here

170
00:08:20,550 --> 00:08:21,490
you can again

171
00:08:21,490 --> 00:08:23,660
just choose any shape you want

172
00:08:23,700 --> 00:08:25,720
You can also use a custom object

173
00:08:25,730 --> 00:08:27,690
which I will show you afterwards

174
00:08:28,390 --> 00:08:29,390
And again

175
00:08:29,390 --> 00:08:33,550
you can also just change the size here of the emitter

176
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:36,070
And you can use an autoplay

177
00:08:36,090 --> 00:08:38,040
or you can also deactivate it

178
00:08:38,290 --> 00:08:41,030
and you can also change the emit time here

179
00:08:41,040 --> 00:08:42,320
So now it's just in

180
00:08:43,380 --> 00:08:49,340
and you can also maybe do it like one time by ​‌​‌​​‌‌​​‌‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌​‌‌‌​​‌‌​​‌‌​​‌‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌​​‌‌​‌​‌‌‌​‌​‌‌​​​‌‌​‌​‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌​‌‌​​​‌‌‌‌‌‌​​‌‌​‌‌‌​​‌‌​‌​‌​​‌‌‌​‌‌​​‌‌​​​‌​​‌‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌​‌‌​​​‌‌‌​​‌‌‌​‌​​​‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌​‌​‌​​‌‌​‌​‌​​‌‌‌​​‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌​​​‌‌‌​‌‌​​‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌​​‌‌‌​‌‌​​‌‌​‌‌​​​‌‌​​‌‌​​‌‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌​‌​‌‌‌​‌​‌‌‌‌‌​‌‌​​‌​​‌‌​‌‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌​​‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌‌​​‌‌‌​‌​‌‌‌​​‌‌‌‌‌​​​‌‌‌‌‌​​​‌‌‌‌‌​​​‌‌‌​​‌‌‌​‌​​​‌​​‌‌​​‌‌​​‌‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌​‌‌‌​​‌‌‌‌‌​​​‌‌​‌‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌​‌‌​​‌‌​‌​‌‌‌​‌​‌‌​​​‌‌​‌​‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌​‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌​‌‌​​​‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌​​​‌​​‌‌​‌​‌‌‌​‌‌​​‌​​‌‌​‌‌‌‌‌​‌​‌​‌​​‌‌​‌​‌​​‌‌​‌​‌‌‌​‌‌​​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌‌​​‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌​​‌‌‌​​‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌​‌‌​​​‌‌‌​​‌‌‌​‌​‌‌‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌​​​‌​​‌‌‌‌‌‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌​‌‌​​‌‌​​‌‌​​‌‌​‌​‌​​‌‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌​‌​‌‌‌​‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌​‌‌​​​‌‌‌​​‌​​‌‌‌‌‌​​​‌‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌​‌‌‌​​‌‌​‌‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌​​​‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌​​‌​​‌‌​‌​‌‌‌​‌​‌‌‌​​‌‌​‌‌​​​‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌​‌‌‌​​‌‌‌‌‌​​​‌‌​‌​‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌‌​​‌‌‌​‌​‌‌‌‌‌​‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌‌​​‌‌‌‌‌‌​​‌‌​‌‌‌​​‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌‌​​‌​​‌‌​​‌‌​​‌‌‌​​‌​​‌‌‌​​‌​​‌‌​‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌a custom duration here

181
00:08:49,570 --> 00:08:52,110
or you can also loop it here

182
00:08:52,130 --> 00:08:54,270
So you can maybe just

183
00:08:54,280 --> 00:08:56,020
yeahchoose a delay here

184
00:08:56,760 --> 00:09:00,680
So it will only repeat it like every one second here

185
00:09:01,180 --> 00:09:02,300
And yeah

186
00:09:02,310 --> 00:09:09,180
Soand maybe one little thing I forgot to mention is that you can also give them now a rotation factor here

187
00:09:09,260 --> 00:09:11,050
so a little nice transition

188
00:09:11,050 --> 00:09:11,720
So for example

189
00:09:12,050 --> 00:09:14,280
if I'm placing a 0 here

190
00:09:14,490 --> 00:09:17,910
you now see that the particles are getting rotated here

191
00:09:17,910 --> 00:09:21,380
So from 0 to 360 degrees

192
00:09:21,500 --> 00:09:24,660
So why their lifetime is ending here

193
00:09:26,900 --> 00:09:29,100
Soand then onto the next step here

194
00:09:29,100 --> 00:09:31,230
which is called particle forces

195
00:09:31,240 --> 00:09:35,390
Here we have the opportunity to choose the gravity value

196
00:09:35,650 --> 00:09:37,290
So now by default

197
00:09:37,310 --> 00:09:39,200
it's on the value one here

198
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:41,630
So the particles are flying upwards

199
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,210
And by choosing a negative value here

200
00:09:44,270 --> 00:09:48,190
they will actually fall down and depending on the value

201
00:09:48,190 --> 00:09:49,660
so by instance

202
00:09:49,730 --> 00:09:50,910
I will choose a big value

203
00:09:50,910 --> 00:09:53,640
they will fall much faster down here

204
00:09:54,070 --> 00:09:56,300
And with very high value

205
00:09:56,300 --> 00:09:58,400
they will just simply fly

206
00:09:58,740 --> 00:10:00,620
Yeahmuch faster upwards

207
00:10:02,860 --> 00:10:07,460
So I will just simply get it back here to the value one here

208
00:10:07,790 --> 00:10:12,170
And now we also have the opportunity to choose a collider here

209
00:10:12,380 --> 00:10:15,580
But this will be explained in a few seconds here

210
00:10:15,590 --> 00:10:19,520
And we will just continue with the particle noise tab here

211
00:10:22,280 --> 00:10:22,470
So

212
00:10:22,470 --> 00:10:23,150
and next up

213
00:10:23,150 --> 00:10:25,550
we can talk about the particle noise here

214
00:10:25,560 --> 00:10:26,270
But for this

215
00:10:26,280 --> 00:10:30,710
I will just simply change some settings here in the particle step

216
00:10:31,050 --> 00:10:32,240
So for the size

217
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:35,250
we will maybe just take 5 here

218
00:10:35,390 --> 00:10:37,380
And also

219
00:10:37,560 --> 00:10:40,290
yeahrevert the rotation factor here

220
00:10:40,300 --> 00:10:41,500
For the birth rate

221
00:10:41,850 --> 00:10:44,570
maybe use 1500

222
00:10:45,290 --> 00:10:46,680
and for the lifetime

223
00:10:46,680 --> 00:10:48,620
maybe 2 2

224
00:10:49,320 --> 00:10:51,000
And for the alpha fade

225
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:57,390
we will use the linear fade out here and a speed of 100 maybe

226
00:10:58,990 --> 00:11:08,990
And also I will just delete the five star edge here and will simply choose this one here from the spline library

227
00:11:10,180 --> 00:11:11,230
And for the shape

228
00:11:11,240 --> 00:11:14,800
we will use plane instead of a box here

229
00:11:14,900 --> 00:11:16,840
So it should look something like this

230
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:19,200
All the particles are now getting fired up

231
00:11:19,740 --> 00:11:21,060
And for the plane size

232
00:11:21,090 --> 00:11:25,220
we will just simply use a 100 by 100 plane here

233
00:11:25,230 --> 00:11:28,720
So it should look like this in the end here

234
00:11:28,780 --> 00:11:32,010
So now if we head over to the particle noise tap here

235
00:11:32,010 --> 00:11:34,550
we have three different types to choose from

236
00:11:34,550 --> 00:11:36,440
So the first here is curl

237
00:11:36,450 --> 00:11:39,440
and we have simplex and also FBM here

238
00:11:39,800 --> 00:11:42,430
So maybe let's just start with the curl one here

239
00:11:42,520 --> 00:11:43,200
So for example

240
00:11:43,500 --> 00:11:46,480
if I increase the scale now here

241
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:49,030
it looks something like this here

242
00:11:50,070 --> 00:11:52,390
And while I'm increasing the scale

243
00:11:53,160 --> 00:11:56,270
the noise looks a little bit different by time to time

244
00:11:56,420 --> 00:11:58,560
So for example

245
00:11:58,830 --> 00:12:00,980
this is now the full scale

246
00:12:01,520 --> 00:12:06,620
and this is just a less tiny value here

247
00:12:07,060 --> 00:12:07,520
And then

248
00:12:07,520 --> 00:12:08,110
for example

249
00:12:08,120 --> 00:12:10,350
I can also increase the variation here

250
00:12:10,350 --> 00:12:13,190
So it is kind of like the speed

251
00:12:13,190 --> 00:12:14,960
So while I'm increasing

252
00:12:15,730 --> 00:12:16,690
so in next step

253
00:12:16,690 --> 00:12:20,810
we can also like change the variation parameter here

254
00:12:20,820 --> 00:12:24,960
So this kind of works like the speed of the particle noise here

255
00:12:24,960 --> 00:12:27,580
So while I'm increasing the variation

256
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:31,520
now the particles are getting accelerated here

257
00:12:31,530 --> 00:12:34,160
And then we also have the see function here

258
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:37,060
So maybe I will use 5 seconds here

259
00:12:37,180 --> 00:12:42,130
And then you see the how the animation is getting changed by that

260
00:12:42,180 --> 00:12:43,060
Then next up

261
00:12:43,060 --> 00:12:45,080
we have the simplex noise

262
00:12:45,490 --> 00:12:47,580
this looks like that here

263
00:12:47,610 --> 00:12:48,310
And again

264
00:12:48,310 --> 00:12:50,050
while I'm increasing the scale

265
00:12:50,050 --> 00:12:52,300
it looks a little bit different here

266
00:12:52,370 --> 00:12:59,940
so they are also like kind of clusters that are getting created here while increasing the value or decreasing the value

267
00:13:00,690 --> 00:13:01,410
And again

268
00:13:01,410 --> 00:13:06,520
you can just accelerate them or change the variation in particular

269
00:13:06,940 --> 00:13:08,300
And then last but not lea​‌​‌​​‌‌​​‌‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌​‌‌‌​​‌‌​​‌‌​​‌‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌​​‌‌​‌​‌‌‌​‌​‌‌​​​‌‌​‌​‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌​‌‌​​​‌‌‌‌‌‌​​‌‌​‌‌‌​​‌‌​‌​‌​​‌‌‌​‌‌​​‌‌​​​‌​​‌‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌​‌‌​​​‌‌‌​​‌‌‌​‌​​​‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌​‌​‌​​‌‌​‌​‌​​‌‌‌​​‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌​​​‌‌‌​‌‌​​‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌​​‌‌‌​‌‌​​‌‌​‌‌​​​‌‌​​‌‌​​‌‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌​‌​‌‌‌​‌​‌‌‌‌‌​‌‌​​‌​​‌‌​‌‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌​​‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌‌​​‌‌‌​‌​‌‌‌​​‌‌‌‌‌​​​‌‌‌‌‌​​​‌‌‌‌‌​​​‌‌‌​​‌‌‌​‌​​​‌​​‌‌​​‌‌​​‌‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌​‌‌‌​​‌‌‌‌‌​​​‌‌​‌‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌​‌‌​​‌‌​‌​‌‌‌​‌​‌‌​​​‌‌​‌​‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌​‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌​‌‌​​​‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌​​​‌​​‌‌​‌​‌‌‌​‌‌​​‌​​‌‌​‌‌‌‌‌​‌​‌​‌​​‌‌​‌​‌​​‌‌​‌​‌‌‌​‌‌​​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌‌​​‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌​​‌‌‌​​‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌​‌‌​​​‌‌‌​​‌‌‌​‌​‌‌‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌​​​‌​​‌‌‌‌‌‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌​‌‌​​‌‌​​‌‌​​‌‌​‌​‌​​‌‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌​‌​‌‌‌​‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌​‌‌​​​‌‌‌​​‌​​‌‌‌‌‌​​​‌‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌​‌‌‌​​‌‌​‌‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌​​​‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌​​‌​​‌‌​‌​‌‌‌​‌​‌‌‌​​‌‌​‌‌​​​‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌​‌‌‌​​‌‌‌‌‌​​​‌‌​‌​‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌‌​​‌‌‌​‌​‌‌‌‌‌​‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌‌​​‌‌‌‌‌‌​​‌‌​‌‌‌​​‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌‌​​‌​​‌‌​​‌‌​​‌‌‌​​‌​​‌‌‌​​‌​​‌‌​‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌st

270
00:13:08,300 --> 00:13:10,120
we have the FBM 1 here

271
00:13:10,130 --> 00:13:12,260
which looks like that here

272
00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:13,250
And again

273
00:13:13,250 --> 00:13:16,020
you can increase or decrease the scale here

274
00:13:16,060 --> 00:13:19,210
and here you have also some cluster building

275
00:13:19,400 --> 00:13:22,580
And you can also change the variation here

276
00:13:23,050 --> 00:13:29,550
And maybe if the you have some noises where the variation actually doesn't really slow down your particles

277
00:13:29,550 --> 00:13:35,760
so you can just use the speed function here in combination to slow down your particles here

278
00:13:35,770 --> 00:13:36,010
So

279
00:13:36,010 --> 00:13:39,420
and then you have another tap here called particle randomness

280
00:13:39,580 --> 00:13:40,330
And for example

281
00:13:40,380 --> 00:13:42,850
now if I am increasing the value of this Kon

282
00:13:43,080 --> 00:13:49,450
now here you see that you have some bigger particles and also some smaller particles

283
00:13:49,770 --> 00:13:54,350
So you just apply some randomness to the size of the particles

284
00:13:54,760 --> 00:13:58,580
And here you can also increase the rotational factor here

285
00:13:58,640 --> 00:14:03,540
So the particles are actually rotating around here

286
00:14:03,620 --> 00:14:07,710
So now we talked about the basic particle middle functions here

287
00:14:07,720 --> 00:14:12,100
and then we will just continue with the particle forces functions

288
00:14:12,380 --> 00:14:13,420
And to do so

289
00:14:13,420 --> 00:14:18,780
I will just delete this particle me for now and create a new one

290
00:14:18,780 --> 00:14:20,600
So we have just the same

291
00:14:21,390 --> 00:14:23,920
yeahdefault properties here

292
00:14:24,180 --> 00:14:25,120
So again

293
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:42,720
choose a particle meter here and here we will just maybe increase the birth rate here a little bit and reduce the size and increase also the lifetime maybe to something like 5 seconds here

294
00:14:44,070 --> 00:14:44,960
And yeah

295
00:14:44,960 --> 00:14:46,270
this should be fine now

296
00:14:46,520 --> 00:14:50,270
Soand then I will give the emitter here a little twist

297
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:50,980
for example

298
00:14:51,900 --> 00:14:52,900
So like that

299
00:14:54,210 --> 00:14:56,110
rearrange the view a little bit

300
00:14:56,120 --> 00:15:02,920
and then I will also decrease the gravity here to something like -1 here

301
00:15:03,150 --> 00:15:06,650
and maybe I can just increase the speed a little bit here

302
00:15:06,650 --> 00:15:09,260
So it gets shooted out here from the emitter

303
00:15:11,100 --> 00:15:13,030
maybe even a little bit more

304
00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:14,680
so like that

305
00:15:14,870 --> 00:15:16,700
And now with this setup here

306
00:15:16,700 --> 00:15:19,420
we will introduce a particle force here

307
00:15:19,910 --> 00:15:21,780
So choose particle force here

308
00:15:21,780 --> 00:15:24,460
and don't worry if it looks a little bit strange here

309
00:15:25,930 --> 00:15:27,170
And then by default

310
00:15:27,170 --> 00:15:30,800
you will actually have the false type collider here set

311
00:15:30,820 --> 00:15:34,820
And now you simply also see what the collider does here

312
00:15:34,940 --> 00:15:42,800
So you now see that the particles are actually bouncing back from the surface because it's selected as a collider here

313
00:15:43,210 --> 00:15:43,780
And also

314
00:15:43,790 --> 00:15:47,290
if you maybe just go to the particle emitter here

315
00:15:47,390 --> 00:15:49,920
you now see that in the collider model here

316
00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:52,440
the particle force is selected here

317
00:15:52,950 --> 00:15:53,370
So

318
00:15:53,370 --> 00:15:57,230
and then you also have some different kind of properties that you can change

319
00:15:57,470 --> 00:15:58,790
So for example

320
00:15:58,790 --> 00:16:03,220
you can choose if you want the collider to be a box or a sphere here

321
00:16:03,230 --> 00:16:08,400
So now it's getting bounced back from the sphere surface here

322
00:16:09,110 --> 00:16:12,290
And you can also increase the size of the shape here

323
00:16:12,290 --> 00:16:14,880
So maybe make it a little bit wider here

324
00:16:15,710 --> 00:16:18,270
and maybe also move it a little bit down here

325
00:16:18,350 --> 00:16:22,570
And now you see that the particles are actually bouncing back from the surface

326
00:16:22,780 --> 00:16:26,430
And now you maybe see that this bouncing here is quite strong

327
00:16:26,430 --> 00:16:36,240
And you can also just change that by going back to the particle emitter here And then under the particle fourth step here

328
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:39,860
you have an option called elasticity here

329
00:16:39,870 --> 00:16:42,620
hereAnd while reducing the value here

330
00:16:43,860 --> 00:16:48,000
you also see that this balancing here is getting reduced

331
00:16:48,220 --> 00:16:51,310
So the elasticity in particular here

332
00:16:51,340 --> 00:16:53,320
So maybe if you do like zero here

333
00:16:53,320 --> 00:16:59,310
it's kind of like sticking here and very high value here

334
00:16:59,310 --> 00:16:59,630
Now

335
00:16:59,640 --> 00:17:03,950
should it shoots a particle here away from the surface

336
00:17:04,270 --> 00:17:07,990
but that's actually not the only collider model that is available

337
00:17:07,990 --> 00:17:13,420
So if we go back to the particle first step here and go to the false type here

338
00:17:13,420 --> 00:17:16,030
we can also choose an add tractor here

339
00:17:16,030 --> 00:17:16,990
So not the collider

340
00:17:16,990 --> 00:17:18,500
but an attractor here

341
00:17:18,820 --> 00:17:24,630
And now you see that the particles are actually getting sucked in into the collider here

342
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:26,970
So this is the second type of force

343
00:17:27,380 --> 00:17:27,990
and again

344
00:17:27,990 --> 00:17:29,950
here also can use

345
00:17:30,570 --> 00:17:35,470
you can choose if you want the collider be sphere here

346
00:17:35,480 --> 00:17:38,290
or rectangle or box in particular

347
00:17:38,980 --> 00:17:42,530
And then you also have the possibility to choose the range here

348
00:17:42,530 --> 00:17:43,200
So by default

349
00:17:43,280 --> 00:17:45,140
it's at in here

350
00:17:45,300 --> 00:17:47,860
but you can also choose the inside area

351
00:17:47,870 --> 00:17:53,580
So while the particles are hitting the surface here or the inside area

352
00:17:53,910 --> 00:17:57,970
then they are getting sucked in and not just by default

353
00:17:57,980 --> 00:17:59,340
by emitting here

354
00:17:59,510 --> 00:18:02,430
So this is the difference from the range here

355
00:18:03,500 --> 00:18:07,560
And then you can also increase or decrease the intensity here

356
00:18:08,920 --> 00:18:14,050
So you see what changing the value does here to the particles

357
00:18:15,260 --> 00:18:18,240
And then you can also apply some damping here

358
00:18:22,830 --> 00:18:24,300
And then also just

359
00:18:24,420 --> 00:18:28,170
yeahincreasing or decreasing the size of the attractor here

360
00:18:28,180 --> 00:18:30,140
And the last one is just a helper function

361
00:18:30,140 --> 00:18:32,210
So you can hide it or show it

362
00:18:32,210 --> 00:18:33,980
So this is the yellow rectangle

363
00:18:33,990 --> 00:18:37,520
which kind of indicates how the attractor looks like

364
00:18:37,550 --> 00:18:38,040
And yeah

365
00:18:38,040 --> 00:18:41,760
this can be just tied it or shown now here

366
00:18:41,880 --> 00:18:43,490
So and last but not least

367
00:18:43,490 --> 00:18:46,440
we have the first type vortex here

368
00:18:46,450 --> 00:18:49,050
So to show you this 1

369
00:18:49,060 --> 00:18:53,010
I will actually just rotate the emitter back here too

370
00:18:53,070 --> 00:19:05,350
0and then I will also move it inside of the yellow collider here and maybe just rearrange the view here a little bit

371
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:08,580
and I will also make it a little bit wider here

372
00:19:08,910 --> 00:19:12,740
So by changing that value here

373
00:19:12,750 --> 00:19:13,780
some maybe be like that

374
00:19:13,780 --> 00:19:17,080
So it's kind of like a square here

375
00:19:18,440 --> 00:19:24,570
And then if we look from above and choose a false type vortex here

376
00:19:24,590 --> 00:19:29,070
you now see that it's you're getting rotated user particles

377
00:19:29,680 --> 00:19:30,460
and now again

378
00:19:30,460 --> 00:19:33,360
you have some properties that you can change

379
00:19:33,530 --> 00:19:34,580
So for example

380
00:19:35,160 --> 00:19:35,740
for example

381
00:19:35,750 --> 00:19:38,880
you can increase or decrease the intensity

382
00:19:38,930 --> 00:19:42,000
which is kind of the speed of the particles now

383
00:19:42,060 --> 00:19:46,170
So high intensity will rotate faster here

384
00:19:46,180 --> 00:19:49,130
and the low intensity will rotate slower

385
00:19:50,150 --> 00:19:52,470
And then you also have the aperture

386
00:19:52,730 --> 00:19:57,500
So an aperture of 1 here is a kind of like a cluster

387
00:19:57,500 --> 00:20:02,490
so they stick more together here in the vat-exempt and the lower aperture

388
00:20:02,750 --> 00:20:07,280
which is increase this gap here between the particles

389
00:20:07,710 --> 00:20:14,300
And this is just much more smoother and not really like clustered together here

390
00:20:14,970 --> 00:20:15,770
And also again

391
00:20:15,770 --> 00:20:21,640
hereyou can just change the height and the width of the collider here

392
00:20:22,540 --> 00:20:25,530
And this is simply what the vortex does here

393
00:20:26,180 --> 00:20:26,580
So

394
00:20:26,580 --> 00:20:32,460
and maybe one more function is that you can actually apply particles to objects here

395
00:20:33,420 --> 00:20:35,400
I will just show you here

396
00:20:35,410 --> 00:20:38,200
So maybe just create a new particle emitter here

397
00:20:38,200 --> 00:20:40,400
So this is just as the default one

398
00:20:40,870 --> 00:20:45,470
And now you can apply those particles to any shape you want here

399
00:20:45,580 --> 00:20:46,370
So for example

400
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:49,060
I will go with text here

401
00:20:49,850 --> 00:20:53,120
so place the text wrapper on the screen here

402
00:20:53,680 --> 00:20:55,060
and for the content

403
00:20:55,140 --> 00:20:58,000
I will simply write particles

404
00:20:58,940 --> 00:21:01,460
maybe increase the font size here a little bit

405
00:21:02,940 --> 00:21:05,420
And now if you head back over to the particle meter

406
00:21:06,310 --> 00:21:07,550
you may notice that

407
00:21:08,080 --> 00:21:09,940
yeahby choosing the shape type here

408
00:21:09,940 --> 00:21:12,840
you can also use a custom object here

409
00:21:12,990 --> 00:21:14,750
So if you select it

410
00:21:14,790 --> 00:21:18,030
you have another tab opened called object

411
00:21:18,170 --> 00:21:20,590
and here from the object Ta tab

412
00:21:20,600 --> 00:21:23,450
you can just choose a text or yeah

413
00:21:23,450 --> 00:21:26,860
maybe like any 3D object you just created here

414
00:21:27,680 --> 00:21:30,340
And then it maybe looks like this year

415
00:21:30,360 --> 00:21:36,140
And this is just because we have to adapt some values here

416
00:21:36,670 --> 00:21:39,960
So where we may be increasing the birth rate

417
00:21:40,440 --> 00:21:40,880
you know

418
00:21:40,890 --> 00:21:44,910
see maybe the kind of shape of the particle is text here

419
00:21:45,460 --> 00:21:56,180
and then we can also like maybe reduce the particle size here and maybe also the lifetime here

420
00:21:57,990 --> 00:22:04,830
So those are the values you have to change to see the result here

421
00:22:05,350 --> 00:22:07,690
And now you can just play around with it

422
00:22:09,010 --> 00:22:12,800
apply it to a sphere or a Boolean operator or anything you want

423
00:22:12,990 --> 00:22:18,450
So this is also a really nice feature about particles and yeah
