1
00:00:00,550 --> 00:00:04,490
So then let's start with the Eve project

2
00:00:04,740 --> 00:00:05,300
So again

3
00:00:05,300 --> 00:00:08,610
we are now now in our basic default spline scene

4
00:00:09,170 --> 00:00:17,550
And now we will actually place an image here on our base plane as a reference for the basic shape of If

5
00:00:17,560 --> 00:00:18,830
And to do so

6
00:00:18,840 --> 00:00:19,400
we could just

7
00:00:19,580 --> 00:00:22,740
you can simply click on the import button down below

8
00:00:23,060 --> 00:00:27,880
and then we will browse our files here

9
00:00:27,880 --> 00:00:32,810
And then we can just import some images from Google or anything

10
00:00:33,080 --> 00:00:35,240
any default source you have

11
00:00:36,570 --> 00:00:45,290
And now we can actually use this image to create the basic body shape and arm shape and also the head shape of Eve

12
00:00:48,010 --> 00:00:48,540
So

13
00:00:48,540 --> 00:00:53,890
and we will just now simply start with the body here

14
00:00:54,010 --> 00:00:54,920
And to do so

15
00:00:54,920 --> 00:01:01,240
we will just create a sphere here on the body and place it here

16
00:01:01,570 --> 00:01:02,980
And now if you rotate it

17
00:01:02,980 --> 00:01:05,370
you see actually that it looks a bit weird

18
00:01:05,370 --> 00:01:08,300
So we will just hide the base plane for now

19
00:01:09,870 --> 00:01:12,420
So we just have the image in this sphere now

20
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:16,130
So you now can imagine that this is a 2D image

21
00:01:17,090 --> 00:01:20,500
You just actually have to go convert it in 3D

22
00:01:20,550 --> 00:01:25,670
So you take a sphere and not just simply a simple circle here

23
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:33,770
and then we will actually just increase the size of the sphere here by holding option and shift

24
00:01:35,380 --> 00:01:39,070
And now we actually make it like that

25
00:01:39,070 --> 00:01:45,190
So the edges now are aligned with the body shape here

26
00:01:45,870 --> 00:01:50,060
And then we actually choose to move and edit function here

27
00:01:50,220 --> 00:01:52,760
So enter the edit mode here

28
00:01:53,700 --> 00:01:58,400
And then we will actually try to convert this sphere to the body here

29
00:01:59,250 --> 00:01:59,680
So

30
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:04,190
and now we actually want to convert this sphere here to the body

31
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:06,080
So by deforming it

32
00:02:07,290 --> 00:02:10,950
we will choose the edge option here now in the top toolbar

33
00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:20,180
And then we can actually just select all the edges down and we will bring it down here

34
00:02:21,730 --> 00:02:24,420
And now you have to look at the edges here

35
00:02:24,420 --> 00:02:31,030
So we want actually that this little blue line aligns with the image outline here

36
00:02:32,210 --> 00:02:37,720
And so this line actually also aligns with the body now

37
00:02:37,720 --> 00:02:40,760
So we will step to the next part of the body

38
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:44,230
So select the next row here

39
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:46,090
then also bring it down

40
00:02:47,420 --> 00:02:50,610
And now we will do this again and again

41
00:02:50,650 --> 00:02:51,650
So now choose

42
00:02:53,670 --> 00:02:54,790
The next layer here

43
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:55,840
and bring it down

44
00:02:59,280 --> 00:02:59,740
And so

45
00:03:08,930 --> 00:03:11,310
Then bring this down here

46
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:16,480
So now the bottom already looks pretty good

47
00:03:17,380 --> 00:03:20,960
And we will just continue with the top here of the body

48
00:03:22,610 --> 00:03:23,340
And now actually

49
00:03:23,340 --> 00:03:29,140
we can't use the same technique for the upper body because we just reduce the width here

50
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:30,860
If we do the same technique now

51
00:03:30,860 --> 00:03:33,180
we will just getting smaller and smaller

52
00:03:33,180 --> 00:03:44,080
but we actually have to go wider here so we can actually stay in the edge editing mode here and just simply select one edge here

53
00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:51,420
And then we can just increase the width of every edge step by step

54
00:03:51,640 --> 00:03:52,360
So again

55
00:03:52,370 --> 00:03:55,940
click on this little circle here and then hold option shift

56
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:02,250
and then you can bring this little blue line here in alignment to the E body

57
00:04:03,500 --> 00:04:08,230
This is what we also going to do now for all the other other edges

58
00:04:10,970 --> 00:04:15,500
Maybe bring this also a little bit out here

59
00:04:19,960 --> 00:04:23,340
So this is a little bit of fine adjusting here

60
00:04:32,360 --> 00:04:32,540
Now

61
00:04:32,540 --> 00:04:34,680
and sometimes you can't see the edges

62
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:40,980
so you can actually just hover over it and you will just select them like that

63
00:04:41,720 --> 00:04:47,890
And then you can also bring them to the corners here

64
00:04:52,120 --> 00:04:54,190
So I do this step by step now

65
00:04:57,240 --> 00:04:59,800
Then move this a little bit up here

66
00:05:02,610 --> 00:05:04,610
So you see the other edge

67
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:08,350
And then also bring this

68
00:05:09,180 --> 00:05:09,790
ouch

69
00:05:12,450 --> 00:05:17,200
And then what we can actually do is to get this little curve here

70
00:05:17,490 --> 00:05:20,560
We can actually go to the vertex mode now

71
00:05:21,250 --> 00:05:24,600
And then we will select all the upper vertices

72
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:26,190
So not this one in the middle here

73
00:05:26,190 --> 00:05:28,070
but just the outer ones

74
00:05:29,020 --> 00:05:32,410
And now we can actually bring them up here

75
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:37,710
So make sure it's aligned with the image

76
00:05:38,700 --> 00:05:41,180
Maybe a little bit more here

77
00:05:42,770 --> 00:05:43,250
like that

78
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:51,010
And then maybe we can also just select the middle 1 here and bring this down a little bit

79
00:05:52,330 --> 00:05:59,200
So you have like this little nice hole here where the head is actually going to be positioned later

80
00:06:00,520 --> 00:06:04,800
And if you maybe just make the picture invisible

81
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:10,980
Now here we actually see this nice little body already

82
00:06:14,220 --> 00:06:22,970
So let's go back to the editing mode because I actually want to insert another edgy because it looks quite edgy now

83
00:06:23,260 --> 00:06:26,810
So you can just loop card here

84
00:06:27,580 --> 00:06:29,160
and then you can create a new

85
00:06:32,070 --> 00:06:33,070
And your edge here

86
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:39,610
So like that

87
00:06:45,050 --> 00:06:45,070
Yeah

88
00:06:45,130 --> 00:06:46,250
that looks pretty good

89
00:06:53,220 --> 00:06:54,820
Then you can leave the editing mode

90
00:06:55,420 --> 00:06:58,900
And now you're kind of like ready with the body now

91
00:07:00,010 --> 00:07:03,020
So we can actually go to the next part of the body

92
00:07:03,580 --> 00:07:06,240
which is the head now of Eve

93
00:07:07,410 --> 00:07:08,030
So don't worry

94
00:07:08,030 --> 00:07:10,300
it looks a little bit displaced here

95
00:07:10,410 --> 00:07:13,250
but we can actually just make it symmetrically

96
00:07:14,710 --> 00:07:19,270
And I will actually bring this a little bit down here like that

97
00:07:21,480 --> 00:07:22,500
And then again

98
00:07:22,500 --> 00:07:26,080
we will just start over with the sphere now here

99
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:30,640
So we can just place a sphere here

100
00:07:32,290 --> 00:07:37,660
Make sure you are actually aligned in this x's now here

101
00:07:37,790 --> 00:07:39,750
So we're choosing this little blue dots

102
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:46,740
and then we can actually just increase the theory again

103
00:07:46,740 --> 00:07:51,470
so it matches the hat like that

104
00:07:52,740 --> 00:07:56,550
and then maybe see that it's not really a full circle here

105
00:07:56,550 --> 00:07:57,140
So it's

106
00:07:57,450 --> 00:07:59,880
it has actually more width than heat

107
00:07:59,940 --> 00:08:08,050
So I can just drag this up here to this side and also to this side actually

108
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:10,840
Maybe like that

109
00:08:11,880 --> 00:08:16,590
But then actually the bottom of the head has a different curvature

110
00:08:17,250 --> 00:08:20,300
So we will just step back to the editing mode

111
00:08:20,750 --> 00:08:21,740
And now again

112
00:08:22,700 --> 00:08:24,530
we will activate the edge mode

113
00:08:24,530 --> 00:08:27,250
So you can select all the edges of the shape

114
00:08:27,380 --> 00:08:32,260
and then we will bring them again to the outline of the image

115
00:08:33,410 --> 00:08:34,180
Select the edge

116
00:08:34,900 --> 00:08:44,560
and then again hold option and shift and bring this little blue outline here to align body

117
00:08:45,160 --> 00:08:46,440
the head shape here

118
00:08:47,640 --> 00:08:52,230
And then do this for every other edge now

119
00:08:53,930 --> 00:08:54,810
So again

120
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:55,730
select the edge

121
00:08:58,600 --> 00:08:59,660
And bring this out here

122
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:01,120
oops

123
00:09:23,330 --> 00:09:26,620
I will actually move the head up a little bit because I can't

124
00:09:28,300 --> 00:09:30,910
Or maybe I would just move the body down

125
00:09:30,940 --> 00:09:32,460
It's much more simpler

126
00:09:32,900 --> 00:09:34,060
So again

127
00:09:34,380 --> 00:09:38,700
step back to the editing mode and then do it for the last edges as well

128
00:09:55,050 --> 00:09:56,120
Stone here

129
00:09:56,130 --> 00:10:03,040
I will just add another edge here so we get a smoother solution

130
00:10:03,570 --> 00:10:05,430
And I just want the edge

131
00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:08,550
Like that

132
00:10:24,180 --> 00:10:24,730
Yeah

133
00:10:24,740 --> 00:10:28,220
so now we have the basic head shape

134
00:10:28,230 --> 00:10:30,160
Now I will just quickly

135
00:10:32,210 --> 00:10:34,440
Move this body up again

136
00:10:35,960 --> 00:10:40,480
And I will just simply rename it now

137
00:10:40,850 --> 00:10:42,630
So for better understanding

138
00:10:42,630 --> 00:10:48,830
So this is a head shape and this is body shape

139
00:10:52,340 --> 00:10:54,440
And maybe we can also rename the image

140
00:10:54,760 --> 00:10:55,980
So this is just the reference

141
00:10:57,280 --> 00:10:59,960
If okay

142
00:11:00,310 --> 00:11:02,540
and maybe I will actually make this a little bit

143
00:11:04,760 --> 00:11:05,280
Down here

144
00:11:07,890 --> 00:11:11,590
And maybe like this can now

145
00:11:11,590 --> 00:11:14,380
if you have done everything all right

146
00:11:14,760 --> 00:11:16,450
it should be symmetrically

147
00:11:16,840 --> 00:11:21,490
So I actually have to adjust this head a little bit

148
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:24,190
Align in the center

149
00:11:26,700 --> 00:11:32,090
And also because I just actually dragged the head in both right and left side

150
00:11:32,100 --> 00:11:33,220
It's not anymore

151
00:11:33,590 --> 00:11:36,140
it's not spherical anymore

152
00:11:36,140 --> 00:11:40,330
So you actually can just make it here

153
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:41,220
Click again

154
00:11:44,070 --> 00:11:44,590
Like that

155
00:11:47,900 --> 00:11:52,700
And now if you hide the reference reference image

156
00:11:52,700 --> 00:11:58,930
now you actually see that you have actually done the basic shape of Eve

157
00:12:00,500 --> 00:12:04,520
Soand then we can actually start with the arm

158
00:12:04,520 --> 00:12:05,920
so the right and left arm

159
00:12:06,750 --> 00:12:09,620
And to get this

160
00:12:10,520 --> 00:12:15,300
shapewe can actually use the lathe tool here

161
00:12:15,390 --> 00:12:17,550
So where is it here

162
00:12:17,560 --> 00:12:18,470
The lathe 1

163
00:12:20,120 --> 00:12:26,220
And I actually going to hide the reference image for now

164
00:12:27,390 --> 00:12:33,410
And then we will bring the lathe element like here in the position where the arm should be in the end

165
00:12:35,010 --> 00:12:36,310
And now here on the right side

166
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:39,090
you see some settings that you can change

167
00:12:39,260 --> 00:12:40,880
So for example

168
00:12:41,050 --> 00:12:43,480
if you drag this here up and down

169
00:12:43,480 --> 00:12:46,480
you see how the lathe element is actually changing

170
00:12:46,660 --> 00:12:49,840
So for the top here and also for the bottom

171
00:12:51,340 --> 00:12:56,500
And then what you can also do is you can just adjust the curvature of the lathe

172
00:12:57,640 --> 00:13:04,720
So maybe for the arm now we will make the autumn a little bit more thinner

173
00:13:05,780 --> 00:13:10,950
end the shoulder a little bit more rounded

174
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:15,960
Maybe like this

175
00:13:16,130 --> 00:13:18,770
I'll just quickly rearrange the view

176
00:13:19,710 --> 00:13:25,680
And also I will just recolor it so you see it better on the gray background here

177
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:30,570
And then center it here a little bit more

178
00:13:31,590 --> 00:13:35,160
So this actually looks quite good from the basic shape

179
00:13:35,180 --> 00:13:38,160
I will actually make this a little bit more curved

180
00:13:38,270 --> 00:13:41,650
So the hand of Eve maybe

181
00:13:43,770 --> 00:13:44,550
Like this

182
00:13:46,090 --> 00:13:48,190
and then it should also be a little bit longer

183
00:13:48,190 --> 00:13:53,610
So actually going to increase the scale here in the y direction

184
00:13:58,310 --> 00:13:59,230
And maybe like this

185
00:14:02,030 --> 00:14:08,580
And then I'm also going to increase that area so it gets a little bit bigger

186
00:14:11,060 --> 00:14:20,780
And maybe also increase the width here of the shoulder a little bit more because I actually want that

187
00:14:21,340 --> 00:14:23,380
It's getting from big to small

188
00:14:23,940 --> 00:14:25,180
so it fades in a little bit

189
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:31,060
Let me just try adjust this a little bit

190
00:14:32,310 --> 00:14:33,970
And so maybe like this

191
00:14:36,530 --> 00:14:39,800
So if it doesn't look exactly like my armpits

192
00:14:40,060 --> 00:14:40,770
totally fine

193
00:14:40,770 --> 00:14:42,900
This is just personal preference

194
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:45,290
Make this

195
00:14:45,300 --> 00:14:47,060
make it as good as you can

196
00:14:48,140 --> 00:14:51,180
And if we just view now here

197
00:14:52,280 --> 00:14:54,100
looks like​‌​‌​​‌‌​​‌‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌​​‌‌‌​​‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌​‌​‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌​‌‌​​​‌‌‌‌‌‌​​‌‌‌‌‌‌​​‌‌​‌​‌​​‌‌‌​‌‌​​‌‌​​​‌​​‌‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌‌​​‌‌‌​‌‌​​‌​​‌‌​​​‌​​‌‌‌​​‌‌‌​‌​‌​‌​​‌‌​‌​‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌‌‌‌​​​‌‌‌​‌‌​​‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌​​‌‌​‌‌‌‌‌​‌​‌‌​​​‌‌​​‌‌​​‌‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌​‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌​​​‌‌‌​​‌​​‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌‌‌‌​​​‌‌​‌‌​​​‌‌‌‌‌‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌‌​​‌‌‌​‌​‌‌‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌​​‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌​​​‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌​​​‌​​‌‌​​‌‌​​‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌​‌‌‌​​‌‌‌‌‌​​​‌‌​‌‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌​‌‌​​‌‌​‌​‌‌‌​‌‌​‌‌​​‌‌​‌​‌​​‌‌​‌‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌​‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌​‌‌​​​‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌​‌​‌​​‌‌​‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌​‌‌‌‌‌​‌​‌​‌​​‌‌​‌​‌​​‌‌​‌​‌‌‌​‌‌​​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌‌​​‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌​​‌‌‌​​‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌​‌‌‌​​‌‌‌​​‌‌‌​‌​‌‌‌‌‌​‌​‌‌‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌​​‌​​‌‌‌​‌‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌​‌‌​​‌‌​​‌‌​​‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌​‌​‌‌‌​‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌‌​​‌​​‌‌‌‌‌​​​‌‌‌​​‌​​‌‌​‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌​‌‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌​​​‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌​​‌​​‌‌​‌​‌‌‌​‌​‌‌‌​​‌‌​‌‌​​​‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌​‌‌‌​​‌‌‌‌‌​​​‌‌​‌​‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌‌​​‌‌‌​‌​‌‌‌‌‌​‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌‌​​‌‌‌‌‌‌​​‌‌​‌‌‌​​‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌‌​​‌​​‌‌​​‌‌​​‌‌‌​​‌​​‌‌‌​​‌​​‌‌​‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌ this

198
00:14:54,140 --> 00:14:55,150
yeahokay

199
00:14:56,370 --> 00:14:59,280
or maybe just make it a little bit

200
00:15:01,890 --> 00:15:04,150
Tiny in the x direction

201
00:15:07,630 --> 00:15:07,810
Like that

202
00:15:11,390 --> 00:15:16,040
Soand then I actually want to bring this arm here in alignment to the body

203
00:15:16,430 --> 00:15:18,820
So move it in the direction of the body

204
00:15:18,820 --> 00:15:21,510
Now give it a little rotation

205
00:15:25,130 --> 00:15:27,120
A little bit more

206
00:15:34,180 --> 00:15:34,880
So again

207
00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:40,310
this is a lot of fine adjusting here to rotate it a little bit more

208
00:15:50,150 --> 00:15:50,230
See

209
00:15:50,310 --> 00:15:52,820
the car is not quite good

210
00:15:53,050 --> 00:15:58,890
So I'm actually going to curve this outer ring a little bit more

211
00:16:01,250 --> 00:16:02,220
Yeahmaybe like that

212
00:16:03,860 --> 00:16:04,940
Yeahit should just work now

213
00:16:09,460 --> 00:16:10,060
Okay

214
00:16:10,250 --> 00:16:16,060
so this would actually look like the arm is aligned to the body now

215
00:16:16,910 --> 00:16:23,790
And now we actually have to use a Boolean operator now to create the rest of the shape

216
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:28,130
And to do so will actually duplicate the body layer now

217
00:16:28,140 --> 00:16:32,200
So now we have a second body here called body 2

218
00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:36,710
And I will bring this up here over the lathe layer

219
00:16:38,270 --> 00:16:40,920
And then you can actually choose both of the shapes here

220
00:16:40,920 --> 00:16:43,920
So body 2 and the lathe now

221
00:16:44,220 --> 00:16:48,060
And now you have to use the first Boolean modifier now

222
00:16:49,130 --> 00:16:52,130
And then you see a new group is created called Boolean

223
00:16:52,150 --> 00:16:57,400
And then if you bring this up here on the left side

224
00:16:57,410 --> 00:16:58,680
you now see actually that the

225
00:17:01,370 --> 00:17:03,790
Body shape is now merged into the arms

226
00:17:03,940 --> 00:17:10,360
so it looks like it's much more aligned to the body

227
00:17:12,040 --> 00:17:15,170
We can also give it a little bit of rotation now again

228
00:17:16,030 --> 00:17:17,350
so maybe like that

229
00:17:19,980 --> 00:17:20,810
And yeah

230
00:17:20,820 --> 00:17:22,210
this looks quite good now

231
00:17:22,470 --> 00:17:27,980
So if I just maybe recolor both of the shapes here

232
00:17:27,980 --> 00:17:30,990
So you can see that it looks

233
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:36,660
it looks actually already pretty good in terms of shape of shaping

234
00:17:37,970 --> 00:17:39,650
Let's enter this a little bit more

235
00:17:44,680 --> 00:17:45,420
And then actually

236
00:17:45,420 --> 00:17:48,810
you can just simply duplicate the left arm

237
00:17:49,170 --> 00:17:50,490
So hit command and D

238
00:17:52,470 --> 00:17:54,650
and then actually we will

239
00:17:58,870 --> 00:18:01,050
Reset the rotation here

240
00:18:01,050 --> 00:18:06,540
So we can bring this here on the right side without

241
00:18:06,540 --> 00:18:09,200
without a change of the x and y coordinates here

242
00:18:10,920 --> 00:18:14,270
And then I notice this direction

243
00:18:15,030 --> 00:18:15,570
not that

244
00:18:16,090 --> 00:18:17,200
So the right direction

245
00:18:17,750 --> 00:18:18,770
so rotate it

246
00:18:19,370 --> 00:18:23,100
it rotated around 180 degrees

247
00:18:25,210 --> 00:18:27,820
And then you see on the left

248
00:18:27,930 --> 00:18:40,300
I did a little rotation here of 3．75 degrees and that we are going also to do now for the right arm here

249
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,450
that we actually have to choose here

250
00:18:44,460 --> 00:18:49,200
-183．75 degrees

251
00:18:51,300 --> 00:18:53,990
And then bring this up to the body here now

252
00:18:57,070 --> 00:19:00,330
And now we have the basic shape here of E

253
00:19:00,370 --> 00:19:01,850
so the right and left arm

254
00:19:02,780 --> 00:19:04,970
And for better understanding

255
00:19:04,970 --> 00:19:08,110
now I will also rename both of the shapes

256
00:19:08,210 --> 00:19:09,310
So this is the left arm

257
00:19:12,410 --> 00:19:16,030
And Boolean two will be renamed to the radar

258
00:19:21,210 --> 00:19:25,050
So now you have the basic shape here of if

259
00:19:25,060 --> 00:19:26,300
and actually

260
00:19:26,970 --> 00:19:29,280
I want to make a little adjustment here

261
00:19:30,740 --> 00:19:32,930
If you look at the picture here

262
00:19:32,930 --> 00:19:33,920
now you see actually the

263
00:19:36,050 --> 00:19:40,050
Vary of if actually is a little bit curved here on the top body

264
00:19:41,400 --> 00:19:47,220
And I also want to wait more

265
00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:48,330
Okaynow

266
00:19:48,340 --> 00:19:53,240
so I actually want to make this also for the body here

267
00:19:53,240 --> 00:19:53,920
So I

268
00:19:53,960 --> 00:19:59,630
againI would just add the body here in the edit mesh mode now

269
00:20:01,080 --> 00:20:02,550
And to make this curvature

270
00:20:02,930 --> 00:20:10,770
actuallythis can just select this top edges here and move them a little bit down

271
00:20:12,450 --> 00:20:13,580
And then again

272
00:20:14,100 --> 00:20:14,590
work

273
00:20:17,170 --> 00:20:18,250
Let me to the middle

274
00:20:27,960 --> 00:20:28,140
So

275
00:20:28,140 --> 00:20:30,650
and now we actually have the main body

276
00:20:30,650 --> 00:20:32,270
mouth and the head

277
00:20:32,280 --> 00:20:33,750
and also the arms now

278
00:20:34,530 --> 00:20:42,620
But I actually want to do slightly changes here now to the body because if you look at the picture here

279
00:20:43,090 --> 00:20:49,520
you actually see that this body actually has a little bit of curvature at the top

280
00:20:50,710 --> 00:20:54,710
And to also achieve this curvature

281
00:20:54,850 --> 00:20:58,120
we will just head back over to our body element here

282
00:20:58,600 --> 00:21:01,770
And then we will edit the mesh here again

283
00:21:03,700 --> 00:21:05,630
and then zoom in a little bit

284
00:21:06,050 --> 00:21:13,580
And now we can actually just select those edges here and pull them a little bit down

285
00:21:15,020 --> 00:21:16,660
And then we can also do it

286
00:21:16,670 --> 00:21:17,210
Now

287
00:21:19,080 --> 00:21:22,620
if we work our way up to the center here

288
00:21:23,480 --> 00:21:24,550
maybe like this

289
00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:35,570
and then we can actually also select the middle vertex here and also pull it a little bit down here

290
00:21:37,260 --> 00:21:41,090
And now you also have this little nice curvature here

291
00:21:41,090 --> 00:21:43,480
so like the reference image

292
00:21:44,840 --> 00:21:45,840
And yeah

293
00:21:45,960 --> 00:21:47,100
so this is it

294
00:21:47,110 --> 00:21:50,920
Now for the basic shaping now of the body

295
00:21:51,240 --> 00:21:55,920
And now we can actually step towards to the material

296
00:21:56,550 --> 00:21:57,390
And for this

297
00:21:57,390 --> 00:21:59,820
we can just select the body now here

298
00:22:00,550 --> 00:22:08,880
And I will actually change this now to a little more blue gray here

299
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:11,780
So maybe like that

300
00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:14,770
So for if you want to know it

301
00:22:14,780 --> 00:22:16,110
it's t 4

302
00:22:16,120 --> 00:22:16,670
t 4

303
00:22:16,680 --> 00:22:17,750
e 4

304
00:22:19,750 --> 00:22:23,160
And then we can also add some Fresnel to it

305
00:22:23,480 --> 00:22:24,430
So again

306
00:22:24,910 --> 00:22:28,270
just add a material layer by clicking this plus icon

307
00:22:29,020 --> 00:22:31,040
And then we can add a Fresno layer

308
00:22:32,210 --> 00:22:33,570
And for the Fresno layer

309
00:22:33,590 --> 00:22:37,240
we actually just make the color white here

310
00:22:37,570 --> 00:22:43,230
And we can actually just leave the settings here as they are

311
00:22:43,670 --> 00:22:47,500
And then we actually can introduce another Fresno layer here

312
00:22:47,540 --> 00:22:51,730
So we can just add a new layer and choose Fresno here

313
00:22:52,440 --> 00:22:58,630
And then I will actually do some more grey light color here

314
00:22:58,910 --> 00:23:00,050
So maybe like ed

315
00:23:00,140 --> 00:23:00,830
eded

316
00:23:02,600 --> 00:23:05,870
So now you have the two Fresnel layers here

317
00:23:05,970 --> 00:23:10,260
And I will actually increase the scale of the second layer here too

318
00:23:10,470 --> 00:23:11,040
too

319
00:23:11,490 --> 00:23:14,040
So you have a nice little transition here

320
00:23:16,070 --> 00:23:21,170
And then we actually can also change the background here

321
00:23:22,370 --> 00:23:24,300
But for now

322
00:23:24,300 --> 00:23:28,880
I will actually choose the base plane here as the background

323
00:23:30,230 --> 00:23:31,450
Maybe zoom out a little bit

324
00:23:31,750 --> 00:23:40,270
And then you can just hold option and shift and then increase the plane here to the size you want

325
00:23:41,440 --> 00:23:45,560
And I will also move it a little bit in the background here

326
00:23:46,070 --> 00:23:47,130
So it'll be like this

327
00:23:48,560 --> 00:23:50,840
And then I will zoom back in here

328
00:23:51,070 --> 00:23:55,220
Now I will also rename it real quick

329
00:23:55,420 --> 00:23:56,620
So background

330
00:23:59,040 --> 00:24:01,270
And also give it the color here

331
00:24:02,250 --> 00:24:04,030
So maybe like this D 40

332
00:24:04,030 --> 00:24:04,450
d 4

333
00:24:04,540 --> 00:24:05,100
4

334
00:24:07,580 --> 00:24:09,450
So this already looks pretty good now

335
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:15,600
And then we can also apply this material to the other object here

336
00:24:16,040 --> 00:24:16,990
So for example

337
00:24:16,990 --> 00:24:20,480
you can now maybe just create a new material here

338
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:22,080
So by clicking this plus icon

339
00:24:23,830 --> 00:24:28,370
and then we can call it like if body

340
00:24:30,570 --> 00:24:35,170
And now you can actually just reference this material for every object here

341
00:24:35,170 --> 00:24:35,820
So for instance

342
00:24:35,920 --> 00:24:37,430
if you click on The

343
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:43,830
and now you can actually access it from the material assets library and just click on it

344
00:24:45,010 --> 00:24:56,540
Or what you can also actually do is you can just copy the material and then paste it actually onto the next shape

345
00:24:57,150 --> 00:24:59,540
So you can do it how you prefer it

346
00:25:01,910 --> 00:25:06,080
And now this already looks a little bit more clean now

347
00:25:07,430 --> 00:25:12,500
And then we will actually do the next part of the shaping

348
00:25:12,500 --> 00:25:14,230
which is the head element now

349
00:25:14,230 --> 00:25:20,240
So if you look at the reference image and maybe just hide the head for now

350
00:25:20,750 --> 00:25:24,040
we actually want to do this little display here

351
00:25:24,740 --> 00:25:26,290
Soand to do the head now

352
00:25:26,800 --> 00:25:30,390
we will just hide again the reference layer here

353
00:25:30,760 --> 00:25:40,190
And I will actually make this head a little bit smaller here because I think it's fitting more here

354
00:25:40,650 --> 00:25:42,050
So maybe like this

355
00:25:46,770 --> 00:25:48,210
Yeahthis looks good for now

356
00:25:49,050 --> 00:25:53,560
And then we can actually just duplicate the head layer here

357
00:25:54,520 --> 00:25:56,230
then rename it

358
00:25:56,470 --> 00:26:00,130
So maybe like display app

359
00:26:02,510 --> 00:26:06,730
And now we can actually resize it also

360
00:26:06,730 --> 00:26:07,380
So again

361
00:26:07,390 --> 00:26:10,770
hold option and shift and resize it

362
00:26:10,940 --> 00:26:13,840
It doesn't have to be like any specific size

363
00:26:13,850 --> 00:26:19,560
So we will just take a look at how it fits to the head now

364
00:26:21,580 --> 00:26:25,110
And then we will move it out of the box here for now

365
00:26:26,020 --> 00:26:30,920
And we can also like give it another color

366
00:26:30,920 --> 00:26:31,520
So for now

367
00:26:31,520 --> 00:26:32,140
it's again

368
00:26:32,150 --> 00:26:35,130
just our material from the library

369
00:26:35,260 --> 00:26:39,100
And we can actually just click here to unbound the library

370
00:26:39,600 --> 00:26:43,240
And then we have all the properties here now again

371
00:26:43,550 --> 00:26:47,250
and I will just do some black here for now

372
00:26:49,120 --> 00:26:51,140
So now it looks like that

373
00:26:51,730 --> 00:27:00,330
That doesn't really look like how we want it to be and what we can actually just play around a little bit with it

374
00:27:02,160 --> 00:27:05,030
So increasing with you a little bit

375
00:27:07,690 --> 00:27:08,180
Maybe like that

376
00:27:12,120 --> 00:27:13,890
That's a little bit down here

377
00:27:30,220 --> 00:27:32,860
So maybe like this for now

378
00:27:33,210 --> 00:27:35,760
Or maybe actually

379
00:27:38,270 --> 00:27:39,740
Up a little bit more

380
00:27:40,500 --> 00:27:42,080
And then we can again

381
00:27:42,080 --> 00:27:44,250
make use of the Boolean operator

382
00:27:44,260 --> 00:27:45,620
And to do so

383
00:27:45,620 --> 00:27:48,650
we will actually duplicate the head again

384
00:27:49,820 --> 00:27:52,540
So now you have a head and the head 2 here

385
00:27:53,120 --> 00:27:55,010
and also the display head

386
00:27:55,250 --> 00:27:57,320
which we just adjusted right now

387
00:27:57,860 --> 00:28:03,980
And then we can actually select the display head and also the duplicated head

388
00:28:04,540 --> 00:28:07,870
And now we can use the second Boolean operator now

389
00:28:10,030 --> 00:28:14,490
And then now you actually see that it's disappearing now

390
00:28:15,210 --> 00:28:21,820
But now you actually have exactly the same curvature again for the display

391
00:28:24,200 --> 00:28:28,000
And if I go just a little bit back here now

392
00:28:28,010 --> 00:28:29,280
and then again

393
00:28:29,910 --> 00:28:34,770
just redo the material properties here now to some black

394
00:28:38,330 --> 00:28:38,650
And I have to

395
00:28:38,800 --> 00:28:38,930
actually

396
00:28:46,550 --> 00:28:48,580
It so not

397
00:28:49,110 --> 00:28:52,130
Yeahand the lead position here

398
00:28:54,490 --> 00:28:58,050
We actually now get to see the display here

399
00:28:58,060 --> 00:28:58,980
So basically

400
00:28:58,980 --> 00:29:05,970
you just created a Boolean operator shape here now based from the head to get the curvature right

401
00:29:06,230 --> 00:29:08,440
And then for the display head

402
00:29:08,440 --> 00:29:09,840
it's the basic

403
00:29:09,900 --> 00:29:17,620
basically the width and the heat that you want to get for the display with the Boolean operator

404
00:29:17,620 --> 00:29:21,160
Now you mix both of the shapes together

405
00:29:22,500 --> 00:29:25,920
and now you have this little nice display in the head

406
00:29:27,120 --> 00:29:29,310
And actually this is not shiny enough

407
00:29:30,050 --> 00:29:37,540
so we will​‌​‌​​‌‌​​‌‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌​​‌‌‌​​‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌​‌​‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌​‌‌​​​‌‌‌‌‌‌​​‌‌‌‌‌‌​​‌‌​‌​‌​​‌‌‌​‌‌​​‌‌​​​‌​​‌‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌‌​​‌‌‌​‌‌​​‌​​‌‌​​​‌​​‌‌‌​​‌‌‌​‌​‌​‌​​‌‌​‌​‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌‌‌‌​​​‌‌‌​‌‌​​‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌​​‌‌​‌‌‌‌‌​‌​‌‌​​​‌‌​​‌‌​​‌‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌​‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌​​​‌‌‌​​‌​​‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌‌‌‌​​​‌‌​‌‌​​​‌‌‌‌‌‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌‌​​‌‌‌​‌​‌‌‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌​​‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌​​​‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌​​​‌​​‌‌​​‌‌​​‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌​‌‌‌​​‌‌‌‌‌​​​‌‌​‌‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌​‌‌​​‌‌​‌​‌‌‌​‌‌​‌‌​​‌‌​‌​‌​​‌‌​‌‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌​‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌​‌‌​​​‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌​‌​‌​​‌‌​‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌​‌‌‌‌‌​‌​‌​‌​​‌‌​‌​‌​​‌‌​‌​‌‌‌​‌‌​​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌‌​​‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌​​‌‌‌​​‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌​‌‌‌​​‌‌‌​​‌‌‌​‌​‌‌‌‌‌​‌​‌‌‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌​​‌​​‌‌‌​‌‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌​‌‌​​‌‌​​‌‌​​‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌​‌​‌‌‌​‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌‌​​‌​​‌‌‌‌‌​​​‌‌‌​​‌​​‌‌​‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌​‌‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌​​​‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌​​‌​​‌‌​‌​‌‌‌​‌​‌‌‌​​‌‌​‌‌​​​‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌​‌‌‌​​‌‌‌‌‌​​​‌‌​‌​‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌‌​​‌‌‌​‌​‌‌‌‌‌​‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌‌​​‌‌‌‌‌‌​​‌‌​‌‌‌​​‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌‌​​‌​​‌‌​​‌‌​​‌‌‌​​‌​​‌‌‌​​‌​​‌‌​‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌ also rearrange this wheel creek by adding a matte cap layer here

408
00:29:38,510 --> 00:29:41,350
Againjust add a material layer here

409
00:29:41,390 --> 00:29:41,680
And then

410
00:29:42,500 --> 00:29:43,110
and then again

411
00:29:43,110 --> 00:29:47,410
we can just use this red cap layer here

412
00:29:47,540 --> 00:29:51,000
which gives a little nice shiny surface here

413
00:29:54,300 --> 00:29:54,930
And then for now

414
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:58,470
I can actually just remove one of the Fresnel layers here

415
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:01,300
So maybe like this one

416
00:30:03,230 --> 00:30:05,930
And then we are good to go for now

417
00:30:07,300 --> 00:30:07,640
So

418
00:30:07,640 --> 00:30:10,930
and then we actually have the basic shape

419
00:30:10,940 --> 00:30:11,290
you know

420
00:30:11,290 --> 00:30:13,040
for the display

421
00:30:13,050 --> 00:30:15,870
if you want to do some little fine adjustments

422
00:30:15,890 --> 00:30:17,640
be careful with the Boolean operator now

423
00:30:17,640 --> 00:30:25,890
So you actually have to select the display head now to actually adjust the width and the heat

424
00:30:27,010 --> 00:30:30,230
So not the Boolean operator here

425
00:30:30,320 --> 00:30:31,870
but the display head

426
00:30:33,700 --> 00:30:36,650
And I will just do it like that for now

427
00:30:37,720 --> 00:30:39,840
And yeah I'm fine with this

428
00:30:42,270 --> 00:30:46,660
And then we can actually go ahead now to the eyes of Eve

429
00:30:49,650 --> 00:30:51,860
Soand to create the ice

430
00:30:51,860 --> 00:30:58,740
we can actually just simply choose the Ellipse tool here now and place an ellipse here on the head

431
00:31:00,010 --> 00:31:06,060
and then actually adjusted a little bit so it looks like an eye

432
00:31:07,950 --> 00:31:10,330
and also give it a little bit of rotation now

433
00:31:11,820 --> 00:31:12,370
So again

434
00:31:12,370 --> 00:31:15,620
if you look at the reference image

435
00:31:15,780 --> 00:31:20,560
and I will just quickly hide the head now and also this one

436
00:31:20,950 --> 00:31:24,260
So you actually see that the ice is a little bit rotated

437
00:31:24,780 --> 00:31:28,160
And also if the shape here is like that

438
00:31:28,450 --> 00:31:35,100
I can maybe use this as a reference now to make it a little bit bigger

439
00:31:37,710 --> 00:31:38,450
Like that

440
00:31:39,510 --> 00:31:42,930
I guess it rotation actually fits right now

441
00:31:43,920 --> 00:31:45,980
so this should be alright

442
00:31:46,350 --> 00:32:01,460
Now you can make both the head and the display visible again and also rearrange the view here and then bring the eyes in the position for now

443
00:32:05,060 --> 00:32:05,950
So like that

444
00:32:13,820 --> 00:32:14,710
And then you can

445
00:32:14,710 --> 00:32:19,890
you can just duplicate this ellipse now

446
00:32:20,630 --> 00:32:23,160
And for better positioning

447
00:32:23,160 --> 00:32:26,500
now I would recommend to redo the rotation

448
00:32:26,510 --> 00:32:32,060
Now there's then just bring it here on the right side

449
00:32:34,090 --> 00:32:36,170
And then we do the rotation

450
00:32:36,420 --> 00:32:40,300
So here it is -21．6

451
00:32:41,620 --> 00:32:45,470
So we will do 21．6 in this direction

452
00:32:46,290 --> 00:32:49,880
And now you have actually the same rotation factor here now again

453
00:32:54,730 --> 00:32:55,100
All right

454
00:32:55,390 --> 00:32:56,440
then again

455
00:32:56,440 --> 00:32:59,210
I will just hide the reference image for now

456
00:33:00,480 --> 00:33:01,140
And actually

457
00:33:01,260 --> 00:33:07,800
maybe I will just quickly make them wider

458
00:33:12,300 --> 00:33:15,950
Here and a little bit more down

459
00:33:20,140 --> 00:33:20,870
Like this

460
00:33:20,910 --> 00:33:21,360
so again

461
00:33:21,370 --> 00:33:27,400
21．6 and -21．6

462
00:33:27,640 --> 00:33:29,100
This is the rotation here

463
00:33:30,050 --> 00:33:32,460
So now we have two eyes here

464
00:33:33,040 --> 00:33:36,830
Soand now we're getting to get the curvature of the eyes

465
00:33:36,830 --> 00:33:37,200
right

466
00:33:37,200 --> 00:33:42,060
So we just use the same technique as we used before for the this play it

467
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:44,170
And to do this

468
00:33:44,490 --> 00:33:49,490
we will first just simply extrude both of the eyes now

469
00:33:50,370 --> 00:33:51,580
So maybe like this

470
00:33:51,720 --> 00:33:52,780
So don't worry

471
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:54,510
it looks a bit strange for now

472
00:33:56,550 --> 00:34:00,370
Then we will just bring this up here inside of the head

473
00:34:02,820 --> 00:34:04,510
And then we can actually

474
00:34:04,580 --> 00:34:11,840
againjust duplicate the head shape here on the left sidebar and then bring this up here

475
00:34:13,190 --> 00:34:17,380
And now you just simply select one of the eyes and the head shape

476
00:34:18,180 --> 00:34:22,820
And then just use the second Boolean operator now here

477
00:34:23,150 --> 00:34:25,520
And then if you actually drag it out here

478
00:34:25,520 --> 00:34:31,720
you now see that the I actually has the same curvature as the head

479
00:34:31,720 --> 00:34:35,210
So it's perfectly connected to the surface

480
00:34:36,450 --> 00:34:39,760
And now we actually made the first I

481
00:34:41,950 --> 00:34:45,090
I'll actually rearrange this real quick

482
00:34:46,010 --> 00:34:46,800
The left side

483
00:34:46,800 --> 00:34:49,090
so it's perfectly aligned here

484
00:34:49,100 --> 00:34:49,910
so like that

485
00:34:51,150 --> 00:34:52,100
And then again

486
00:34:52,120 --> 00:34:53,320
for the second eye

487
00:34:54,560 --> 00:34:56,830
we will again duplicate the head shape

488
00:34:57,430 --> 00:34:58,060
bring this up

489
00:34:58,070 --> 00:35:04,930
Now select both of the shapes and then choose the second Boolean operator here

490
00:35:05,920 --> 00:35:06,960
And then again

491
00:35:07,560 --> 00:35:12,750
maybe go on the right view here and bring this I in front

492
00:35:14,030 --> 00:35:15,260
So like that

493
00:35:18,420 --> 00:35:21,110
And now you have it with two eyes now

494
00:35:22,450 --> 00:35:22,850
So

495
00:35:22,850 --> 00:35:33,480
and maybe you know from the reference image that we actually have some kind of pattern here in the eyes of Eve

496
00:35:33,970 --> 00:35:35,200
So if you look at this

497
00:35:35,880 --> 00:35:38,740
we actually see some little lines here

498
00:35:39,440 --> 00:35:45,640
And we can actually achieve this by using the pattern feature in the material properties

499
00:35:46,930 --> 00:35:47,540
And to do this

500
00:35:47,550 --> 00:35:52,470
I will just quickly hide again the reference image

501
00:35:52,820 --> 00:35:54,210
And again

502
00:35:54,210 --> 00:35:54,500
for better

503
00:35:54,770 --> 00:35:59,120
for better clarification here

504
00:35:59,130 --> 00:36:03,150
I will just also rename both of the eyes here

505
00:36:03,160 --> 00:36:05,110
so left eye

506
00:36:06,960 --> 00:36:12,620
and also rename the right one to right eye

507
00:36:14,250 --> 00:36:19,410
Okayand then we can just head over here to the material tab again

508
00:36:20,020 --> 00:36:20,580
and again

509
00:36:20,580 --> 00:36:23,460
it's choosing the default if party material

510
00:36:23,460 --> 00:36:27,550
but we can just simply unbound it by using this icon

511
00:36:27,550 --> 00:36:30,310
Now and again

512
00:36:30,310 --> 00:36:42,310
I can just remove one of the Fresno layers and then introduce new layer and we can use from the layer function that we can just use the pattern 1 here

513
00:36:43,400 --> 00:36:50,460
Soand then adjust the properties here and we actually want for the style

514
00:36:50,460 --> 00:36:53,020
we actually want the lines here

515
00:36:54,630 --> 00:36:57,010
And we want to do it spherical

516
00:37:06,670 --> 00:37:07,910
And for the color

517
00:37:07,910 --> 00:37:14,610
actuallywe will keep the black 1 and we will introduce also the blue 1 here

518
00:37:14,620 --> 00:37:18,900
So it looks a little bit like the color from the reference image

519
00:37:20,260 --> 00:37:23,850
And then to get a little bit more of the lines here

520
00:37:23,850 --> 00:37:24,910
now in the eye

521
00:37:24,920 --> 00:37:28,600
we actually have to adjust the frequency of the lines

522
00:37:29,020 --> 00:37:31,350
So not in the x position

523
00:37:31,350 --> 00:37:32,490
but in the y position

524
00:37:32,880 --> 00:37:33,550
So for example

525
00:37:33,810 --> 00:37:35,370
if I increase the value

526
00:37:35,940 --> 00:37:39,280
you now see that a lot of a lot more lines are not visible

527
00:37:39,280 --> 00:37:43,930
So it will actually make a bigger value here

528
00:37:44,460 --> 00:37:45,160
maybe like 100

529
00:37:47,820 --> 00:37:48,890
Yeahlike that

530
00:37:49,740 --> 00:37:52,980
And then to get a little bit of blurry effect

531
00:37:52,980 --> 00:37:56,730
we can actually also increase this smoothness factor here

532
00:37:56,730 --> 00:38:05,030
So if I increase factor and you see that it's getting a little bit more blurry around the edges

533
00:38:06,600 --> 00:38:07,250
So we get

534
00:38:07,260 --> 00:38:11,120
againget a little bit more of this display kind of look

535
00:38:13,760 --> 00:38:14,240
And yeah

536
00:38:14,240 --> 00:38:14,790
this is it

537
00:38:14,800 --> 00:38:17,350
Now for this material

538
00:38:18,960 --> 00:38:19,630
And again

539
00:38:22,090 --> 00:38:22,660
And again

540
00:38:22,660 --> 00:38:27,760
we can just simply also save this material to your Asset panel now here

541
00:38:28,320 --> 00:38:33,660
and maybe choose the eye material here

542
00:38:35,740 --> 00:38:40,490
And then we can also apply this material here to the second eye

543
00:38:44,280 --> 00:38:45,300
And actually

544
00:38:45,300 --> 00:38:49,900
I will just adjust the eyes a little bit more so I can just

545
00:38:51,480 --> 00:38:53,790
if you want to adjust the size

546
00:38:53,790 --> 00:38:56,730
you can just go inside of the Boolean operator

547
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:03,020
And I will make it actually a little bit bigger now here

548
00:39:05,970 --> 00:39:06,850
So maybe like that

549
00:39:09,630 --> 00:39:13,620
And also a little bit on the outside

550
00:39:18,010 --> 00:39:20,020
I think I can with

551
00:39:26,360 --> 00:39:29,220
I have to choose with an operator ellipse

552
00:39:39,640 --> 00:39:40,360
So maybe like that

553
00:39:41,670 --> 00:39:42,710
So now again

554
00:39:42,710 --> 00:39:45,800
we can make some little adjustments here

555
00:39:45,800 --> 00:39:52,830
So I will actually make this display actually a little bit more like this

556
00:39:54,750 --> 00:39:58,230
And also for the material actually on display head

557
00:39:58,730 --> 00:40:01,260
I will no

558
00:40:03,600 --> 00:40:04,440
Not this one

559
00:40:07,880 --> 00:40:08,990
Yeahbut this

560
00:40:09,720 --> 00:40:13,240
So actually I will move this Fresnel layer up here

561
00:40:13,240 --> 00:40:20,710
Soand then I will actually make it black here so it doesn't look that shiny now

562
00:40:22,090 --> 00:40:25,680
And maybe also increase the intensity here to 3

563
00:40:26,870 --> 00:40:27,880
So like that

564
00:40:28,460 --> 00:40:29,970
And also to get

565
00:40:30,750 --> 00:40:33,590
againthis little more blur

566
00:40:34,470 --> 00:40:36,120
display it

567
00:40:37,880 --> 00:40:39,190
television effect

568
00:40:39,470 --> 00:40:42,220
you can call it as anything you want

569
00:40:42,580 --> 00:40:43,950
And we will actually

570
00:40:43,960 --> 00:40:46,740
againintroduce some bloom effect here

571
00:40:46,740 --> 00:40:48,800
So activate the bloom 1

572
00:40:49,890 --> 00:40:51,050
And then for the size

573
00:40:51,190 --> 00:40:55,310
actuallyI will use small size here

574
00:40:55,890 --> 00:40:59,100
the threshold I will actually bring down to 0

575
00:40:59,660 --> 00:41:06,570
and also the intensity may be like 0．3 or something

576
00:41:06,580 --> 00:41:07,880
And then maybe you can

577
00:41:08,780 --> 00:41:09,480
if you want

578
00:41:09,670 --> 00:41:12,260
increase this moving factor a little bit

579
00:41:13,080 --> 00:41:14,190
So like that

580
00:41:16,740 --> 00:41:20,670
And now this actually looks really good in my opinion

581
00:41:21,310 --> 00:41:22,310
I will maybe

582
00:41:22,560 --> 00:41:27,720
sorrybut I actually moved the eyes again a little bit

583
00:41:28,530 --> 00:41:29,670
Go down here

584
00:41:36,330 --> 00:41:38,110
So I like that

585
00:41:38,620 --> 00:41:41,700
So this actually looks quite cool for now

586
00:41:44,250 --> 00:41:51,600
And then we will actually head over to the body part where we will add some more details

587
00:41:51,770 --> 00:41:52,910
So for now

588
00:41:52,910 --> 00:41:57,490
I will actually add some buttons here and also a little bigger red button

589
00:41:57,640 --> 00:42:01,930
which kind of simulates the heart of If

590
00:42:03,140 --> 00:42:06,160
where we will also use the same techniques

591
00:42:06,160 --> 00:42:08,140
Now here again

592
00:42:08,360 --> 00:42:11,170
as we did for the display and for the eyes now

593
00:42:12,140 --> 00:42:14,840
and just to get some practice here

594
00:42:14,850 --> 00:42:19,780
to get all the curvature right here in some more complex shapes

595
00:42:20,460 --> 00:42:21,840
And to do so again

596
00:42:21,840 --> 00:42:22,770
we can

597
00:42:23,130 --> 00:42:27,340
againjust add some ellipses here

598
00:42:28,560 --> 00:42:30,050
maybe like

599
00:42:32,240 --> 00:42:37,460
Here I will actually size them down a little bit

600
00:42:39,580 --> 00:42:45,060
So maybe like that and then duplicate it by hitting command button D

601
00:42:48,170 --> 00:42:49,950
Maybe like three little ones

602
00:42:51,610 --> 00:42:56,680
And then one bigger button here

603
00:42:56,740 --> 00:43:00,850
So the heart maybe also center to your right

604
00:43:03,900 --> 00:43:05,370
Yeahmaybe like this

605
00:43:05,390 --> 00:43:07,850
Ohit's not really centered

606
00:43:11,730 --> 00:43:13,290
A little bit more on the right side here

607
00:43:14,460 --> 00:43:15,030
Okay

608
00:43:15,320 --> 00:43:19,040
and now we will start with the three little knobs here

609
00:43:19,820 --> 00:43:20,180
So again

610
00:43:20,180 --> 00:43:22,650
if you look on the left side here

611
00:43:22,650 --> 00:43:29,620
you see that it's just a two dimensional shape and we actually have to bring them down here in the body

612
00:43:30,420 --> 00:43:31,410
So again

613
00:43:31,860 --> 00:43:43,210
just select all of the three little ellipses and then extrude them and move them in the body

614
00:43:44,230 --> 00:43:47,770
Maybe like maybe you like that here

615
00:43:48,540 --> 00:43:49,590
So if you look around

616
00:43:50,550 --> 00:43:56,020
you now see actually that all of the shapes now are connected with the body

617
00:43:57,600 --> 00:43:59,460
And then again

618
00:43:59,460 --> 00:44:02,260
we can just simply duplicate the body

619
00:44:03,070 --> 00:44:04,690
bring the body up here

620
00:44:06,390 --> 00:44:09,870
We will start with this one and again

621
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:16,840
select both of the buddies and then merge them with the second Boolean operator

622
00:44:19,830 --> 00:44:22,830
And then move outside

623
00:44:26,290 --> 00:44:28,280
Have a look from the top here

624
00:44:28,790 --> 00:44:30,300
I don't know

625
00:44:30,360 --> 00:44:33,160
we can get a nice view here

626
00:44:34,670 --> 00:44:42,290
Maybe I will also just reco it really quickly like that and then

627
00:44:46,850 --> 00:44:47,940
Move it inside

628
00:44:51,660 --> 00:44:51,880
So like

629
00:44:53,680 --> 00:44:53,860
like

630
00:44:57,570 --> 00:45:01,580
Or maybe a little bit more like that

631
00:45:02,460 --> 00:45:09,580
And then we can actually just repeat the steps as the steps here for the left one here

632
00:45:09,680 --> 00:45:10,590
So again

633
00:45:10,600 --> 00:45:12,580
duplicate the body here

634
00:45:12,590 --> 00:45:15,080
I will just do it quickly two times

635
00:45:16,720 --> 00:45:19,080
bring both of the bodies up here

636
00:45:20,510 --> 00:45:22,590
select the button and the body

637
00:45:23,550 --> 00:45:25,190
choose the second Boolean operator

638
00:45:27,380 --> 00:45:27,920
Bring this up

639
00:45:34,080 --> 00:45:35,020
Now you see it

640
00:45:35,350 --> 00:45:36,810
And then again for the last one

641
00:45:39,180 --> 00:45:40,840
Choose the second wooden operator

642
00:45:43,480 --> 00:45:46,610
Mer them and bring them out of the surface

643
00:45:46,630 --> 00:45:48,130
I will not rotate it

644
00:45:50,720 --> 00:45:53,900
And then we will do it also for the big one here

645
00:45:54,390 --> 00:45:57,560
So you can move it to the side of the body

646
00:45:58,740 --> 00:45:59,940
duplicate the body

647
00:46:01,630 --> 00:46:02,760
bring this up here

648
00:46:04,080 --> 00:46:06,500
and then choose the second Boolean operator

649
00:46:09,940 --> 00:46:13,050
So now it should look something like this

650
00:46:13,860 --> 00:46:18,400
And then we can just actually change the materials for now

651
00:46:19,400 --> 00:46:22,980
And for the little ones

652
00:46:23,010 --> 00:46:25,030
I will actually just make them white

653
00:46:25,880 --> 00:46:26,950
But first I will actually

654
00:46:27,710 --> 00:46:31,140
againjust rename it here for better understanding

655
00:46:33,150 --> 00:46:33,660
Like little button

656
00:46:37,850 --> 00:46:39,880
Also a little button

657
00:46:41,830 --> 00:46:45,300
And this is also a little button

658
00:46:47,370 --> 00:46:51,780
And maybe ​‌​‌​​‌‌​​‌‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌​​‌‌‌​​‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌​‌​‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌​‌‌​​​‌‌‌‌‌‌​​‌‌‌‌‌‌​​‌‌​‌​‌​​‌‌‌​‌‌​​‌‌​​​‌​​‌‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌‌​​‌‌‌​‌‌​​‌​​‌‌​​​‌​​‌‌‌​​‌‌‌​‌​‌​‌​​‌‌​‌​‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌‌‌‌​​​‌‌‌​‌‌​​‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌​​‌‌​‌‌‌‌‌​‌​‌‌​​​‌‌​​‌‌​​‌‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌​‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌​​​‌‌‌​​‌​​‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌‌‌‌​​​‌‌​‌‌​​​‌‌‌‌‌‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌‌​​‌‌‌​‌​‌‌‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌​​‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌​​​‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌​​​‌​​‌‌​​‌‌​​‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌​‌‌‌​​‌‌‌‌‌​​​‌‌​‌‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌​‌‌​​‌‌​‌​‌‌‌​‌‌​‌‌​​‌‌​‌​‌​​‌‌​‌‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌​‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌​‌‌​​​‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌​‌​‌​​‌‌​‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌​‌‌‌‌‌​‌​‌​‌​​‌‌​‌​‌​​‌‌​‌​‌‌‌​‌‌​​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌‌​​‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌​​‌‌‌​​‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌​‌‌‌​​‌‌‌​​‌‌‌​‌​‌‌‌‌‌​‌​‌‌‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌​​‌​​‌‌‌​‌‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌​‌‌​​‌‌​​‌‌​​‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌​‌​‌‌‌​‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌‌​​‌​​‌‌‌‌‌​​​‌‌‌​​‌​​‌‌​‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌​‌‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌​​​‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌​​‌​​‌‌​‌​‌‌‌​‌​‌‌‌​​‌‌​‌‌​​​‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌​‌‌‌​​‌‌‌‌‌​​​‌‌​‌​‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌‌​​‌‌‌​‌​‌‌‌‌‌​‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌‌​​‌‌‌‌‌‌​​‌‌​‌‌‌​​‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌‌​​‌​​‌‌​​‌‌​​‌‌‌​​‌​​‌‌‌​​‌​​‌‌​‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌we can group all of these little buttons

659
00:46:55,490 --> 00:46:59,940
And you can call it buttons

660
00:47:00,100 --> 00:47:01,450
maybeor anything you want

661
00:47:02,710 --> 00:47:07,600
And now we can add a new material here

662
00:47:07,610 --> 00:47:11,600
And I will just like the white here

663
00:47:13,400 --> 00:47:14,530
So like that

664
00:47:16,100 --> 00:47:17,430
And for the big 1

665
00:47:18,460 --> 00:47:19,710
I will call this one

666
00:47:22,300 --> 00:47:22,810
The heart

667
00:47:24,820 --> 00:47:26,260
And for the material of the heart

668
00:47:26,270 --> 00:47:33,840
we can actually do some red here and maybe like this

669
00:47:37,790 --> 00:47:42,450
And then we can also maybe like add a little bit of outline here

670
00:47:42,460 --> 00:47:50,970
So create an outline layer and maybe increase the width here a little bit

671
00:47:53,160 --> 00:47:53,500
Maybe like that

672
00:47:54,160 --> 00:47:55,590
Also do some smoothing

673
00:47:58,530 --> 00:48:02,650
And then I will do this in a little more lighter red

674
00:48:05,790 --> 00:48:05,990
So yeah

675
00:48:06,200 --> 00:48:07,650
maybe like this

676
00:48:10,510 --> 00:48:10,810
Okay

677
00:48:12,580 --> 00:48:15,120
so now it looks like this now

678
00:48:16,720 --> 00:48:23,490
And I will actually maybe decrease this outline effect a little bit

679
00:48:24,120 --> 00:48:25,430
It like 4

680
00:48:25,440 --> 00:48:26,430
So if you zoom out

681
00:48:26,440 --> 00:48:28,020
it looks like this

682
00:48:29,190 --> 00:48:37,050
And now we can maybe also add a little text here in the background so that

683
00:48:39,410 --> 00:48:42,700
Give CSE the font size here

684
00:48:45,050 --> 00:48:45,770
Two140

685
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:48,450
300or maybe even more

686
00:48:50,170 --> 00:48:50,840
Three4

687
00:48:53,470 --> 00:48:56,800
And then also maybe increase the spacing a little bit

688
00:48:57,090 --> 00:49:02,470
Make sure that the parent element is big enough to fit the front here

689
00:49:09,570 --> 00:49:09,990
Okay

690
00:49:10,050 --> 00:49:11,160
increase it even more

691
00:49:14,770 --> 00:49:15,020
Like that

692
00:49:19,740 --> 00:49:25,700
And also maybe use some bolt font here

693
00:49:29,630 --> 00:49:31,380
This should look great now

694
00:49:31,810 --> 00:49:32,850
but not so far

695
00:49:35,360 --> 00:49:35,980
So like this

696
00:49:40,050 --> 00:49:43,040
And then maybe also change the color here

697
00:49:43,860 --> 00:49:46,360
So maybe some white here

698
00:49:46,670 --> 00:49:53,840
You can also maybe reduce the transparency a little bit so it fades better with the background

699
00:49:55,700 --> 00:49:58,150
And then it looks like this

700
00:49:59,450 --> 00:50:04,340
So now we were actually ready with the basic shaping now of Eve

701
00:50:04,720 --> 00:50:13,050
and now we will come to the animation part and we will add some basic transitions to it and some follow up effect

702
00:50:13,400 --> 00:50:18,860
And one simple animation is the look at feature

703
00:50:18,860 --> 00:50:20,970
which we will implement implement

704
00:50:21,010 --> 00:50:45,240
Now this is quite easy and we will actually use the head for this and I will just quickly group all the head elements up in one group and I will do this and not the buttons and maybe from here to here

705
00:50:47,460 --> 00:50:48,960
So not the arms

706
00:50:49,990 --> 00:50:51,450
So the right eye

707
00:50:51,450 --> 00:50:52,620
the left eye

708
00:50:53,880 --> 00:50:57,570
The big pulley has a display Boolean modifier and the head

709
00:50:58,080 --> 00:51:08,380
And I will g this up and rename it to the moving head or maybe something like that

710
00:51:09,210 --> 00:51:14,260
Now you have actually all the elements of the head combined in one group

711
00:51:14,270 --> 00:51:17,380
And this is actually quite important for the lookout feature

712
00:51:18,220 --> 00:51:19,880
And to implement it

713
00:51:19,880 --> 00:51:24,040
you can just simply head over to the events topic here

714
00:51:25,330 --> 00:51:31,010
And then you can actually use a look at feature here

715
00:51:31,010 --> 00:51:32,920
So not using the start function

716
00:51:33,600 --> 00:51:35,480
but the Lookout feature

717
00:51:35,860 --> 00:51:38,590
And now it's actually just implemented

718
00:51:38,680 --> 00:51:40,440
So if you simulate now

719
00:51:41,060 --> 00:51:45,120
you already see that the head is actually following your cursor

720
00:51:46,030 --> 00:51:47,110
And now you can play

721
00:51:47,550 --> 00:51:49,040
play a little bit around with the features

722
00:51:49,410 --> 00:51:53,030
So I will maybe just increase the damping mode a little bit

723
00:51:54,960 --> 00:51:56,500
And yeah

724
00:51:56,500 --> 00:51:58,110
that's maybe it for now

725
00:52:00,100 --> 00:52:05,850
So now you have a little nice animation here where each looks at your cursor

726
00:52:06,220 --> 00:52:08,200
So this looks pretty cool

727
00:52:10,520 --> 00:52:12,940
And it's also quite easy to do

728
00:52:13,230 --> 00:52:18,210
So it's actually a lot more easier than building the shapes

729
00:52:19,720 --> 00:52:23,640
So now we actually implemented the logout feature

730
00:52:24,230 --> 00:52:27,000
So this looks pretty cool now

731
00:52:29,160 --> 00:52:33,770
And then we can also add a new animation here

732
00:52:33,770 --> 00:52:36,840
So I actually want that Eve is floating a little bit

733
00:52:36,840 --> 00:52:38,490
So like in the movie

734
00:52:38,810 --> 00:52:43,160
it's moving up and down all the time because it just simply floats in the air

735
00:52:43,360 --> 00:52:44,880
And to do that

736
00:52:44,890 --> 00:52:46,650
we will make another group

737
00:52:46,660 --> 00:52:50,710
So we actually have to group all the shapes that we just created

738
00:52:50,970 --> 00:52:53,280
So also the head and the body in the arms

739
00:52:53,480 --> 00:52:58,490
So actually everything is floating simultaneously

740
00:52:59,050 --> 00:53:00,680
And to do so

741
00:53:01,670 --> 00:53:04,520
we can select the heart here

742
00:53:04,530 --> 00:53:05,190
the buttons

743
00:53:05,520 --> 00:53:06,850
the moving head

744
00:53:07,050 --> 00:53:08,060
right and left arm

745
00:53:09,040 --> 00:53:11,130
and also the body now here

746
00:53:11,140 --> 00:53:14,220
and create a group with Commander G

747
00:53:14,490 --> 00:53:15,660
the short key

748
00:53:16,320 --> 00:53:20,170
And then I will just simply rename it to Eve

749
00:53:22,920 --> 00:53:26,700
So then we have all the shapes now grouped together

750
00:53:26,910 --> 00:53:27,870
And with this

751
00:53:27,870 --> 00:53:32,080
now we can actually introduce two new state here

752
00:53:32,080 --> 00:53:32,570
So again

753
00:53:32,570 --> 00:53:34,870
we have the base state and the second state

754
00:53:35,580 --> 00:53:36,600
And for example

755
00:53:36,690 --> 00:53:37,920
now in the base state

756
00:53:38,840 --> 00:53:43,340
if it's now in this position and in the next step

757
00:53:43,530 --> 00:53:47,540
actuallyit should be a little bit more up here

758
00:53:47,990 --> 00:53:48,770
So maybe like that

759
00:53:49,860 --> 00:53:51,870
So you now see the difference

760
00:53:51,980 --> 00:53:53,230
So in the base state

761
00:53:53,300 --> 00:53:53,940
it's here

762
00:53:53,950 --> 00:53:55,420
and then in the second state

763
00:53:55,600 --> 00:53:55,880
it's here

764
00:53:56,500 --> 00:54:00,360
Maybe even move this a little bit more up

765
00:54:01,100 --> 00:54:12,260
And now we can trigger this state by adding transition and this transition transition is basically just started when the scene is starting

766
00:54:12,260 --> 00:54:16,880
so you can just give it as it is now with the starting condition

767
00:54:17,810 --> 00:54:22,030
And then you can click on transition and the target is again

768
00:54:22,030 --> 00:54:23,320
the group if here

769
00:54:25,140 --> 00:54:26,540
and you actually want that

770
00:54:26,890 --> 00:54:31,200
it's skulking from the base state to the second state now

771
00:54:31,330 --> 00:54:34,710
and maybe you can increase the time a little bit

772
00:54:34,960 --> 00:54:36,220
like 1．5

773
00:54:36,770 --> 00:54:39,610
And here you can actually make it linear

774
00:54:39,790 --> 00:54:41,880
but you can also make it like this

775
00:54:41,890 --> 00:54:42,660
in and out

776
00:54:44,310 --> 00:54:47,260
The top and the bottom is a little bit damp

777
00:54:49,170 --> 00:54:51,380
so we can alle it as it is now

778
00:54:52,100 --> 00:54:55,950
And we also should do it infinitely

779
00:54:56,740 --> 00:55:03,910
And we will actually cycle it with the ping pong so it actually bounces up and down and up and down

780
00:55:05,200 --> 00:55:06,960
And this is it now

781
00:55:07,140 --> 00:55:09,100
And now if we simulate

782
00:55:09,110 --> 00:55:12,120
now you see that E is floating

783
00:55:12,480 --> 00:55:16,620
And also the login feature is still active here

784
00:55:20,940 --> 00:55:25,570
And then maybe we can just add another little animation now

785
00:55:26,420 --> 00:55:27,420
So for example

786
00:55:27,420 --> 00:55:33,090
we can make Eav jump by clicking on the body or anywhere in the scene

787
00:55:34,650 --> 00:55:37,180
So we will actually also implement this feature now as an example

788
00:55:38,600 --> 00:55:39,640
So to do that

789
00:55:39,710 --> 00:55:51,670
we can just step back to the If group here and we will actually trigger a new event here by the Mo down feature

790
00:55:53,240 --> 00:56:00,830
And then we will just go back again and we will introduce another state here

791
00:56:00,840 --> 00:56:02,410
So the state 2

792
00:56:02,500 --> 00:56:03,650
we can actually make it

793
00:56:05,730 --> 00:56:08,010
We can actually call it like maybe jump

794
00:56:10,500 --> 00:56:12,740
And when it jumps

795
00:56:12,750 --> 00:56:17,730
I actually want the position to be higher than this

796
00:56:18,300 --> 00:56:22,150
So choose the second state here

797
00:56:22,160 --> 00:56:23,100
the jump state

798
00:56:23,390 --> 00:56:25,450
then make this even more higher

799
00:56:26,220 --> 00:56:30,100
So now you see these two are floating ones

800
00:56:30,110 --> 00:56:33,080
and this is a jumping condition

801
00:56:36,900 --> 00:56:40,010
And we can trigger this now

802
00:56:42,080 --> 00:56:45,050
By our the mousedown event

803
00:56:45,740 --> 00:56:50,280
so add a transition here for if do it once

804
00:56:51,260 --> 00:56:54,460
and then we will just do a transition from the current state

805
00:56:54,460 --> 00:56:58,280
So no matter if it's currently in the base state of the state

806
00:56:58,760 --> 00:57:02,900
And then we actually going to do a transition to the jump state

807
00:57:03,370 --> 00:57:04,430
So for example

808
00:57:04,870 --> 00:57:08,020
now if I simulate click

809
00:57:08,030 --> 00:57:10,040
you can see that it's moving up

810
00:57:10,050 --> 00:57:12,960
But this is actually quite slowly

811
00:57:12,960 --> 00:57:17,320
So I will just reduce this timing bit a little bit

812
00:57:17,660 --> 00:57:19,620
maybe like 0．3

813
00:57:21,220 --> 00:57:22,080
And now again

814
00:57:22,190 --> 00:57:25,500
you see that it's moving up

815
00:57:26,050 --> 00:57:26,880
so like that

816
00:57:29,870 --> 00:57:32,730
But now you actually see that it's not coming back down

817
00:57:32,730 --> 00:57:34,480
So it stays in this position

818
00:57:35,390 --> 00:57:38,720
And we also have to get rid of that

819
00:57:38,780 --> 00:57:43,040
So we will actually take another transition back to the base date

820
00:57:44,710 --> 00:57:46,990
so back to the original position

821
00:57:47,510 --> 00:57:51,510
and we can actually make this a little bit shorter as well

822
00:57:52,240 --> 00:57:53,800
So maybe like 0．5

823
00:57:54,760 --> 00:57:57,550
And now if you simulate again and jump

824
00:57:58,100 --> 00:57:58,520
you know

825
00:57:58,540 --> 00:58:02,030
see that it's also falling down again

826
00:58:04,540 --> 00:58:07,400
So this is actually a little jump here

827
00:58:07,610 --> 00:58:13,900
And now we can actually make some more crazy stuff now here

828
00:58:14,950 --> 00:58:20,700
but maybe we can also let the head rotate while Eve is jumping

829
00:58:21,100 --> 00:58:23,910
So this could also be a nice little feature

830
00:58:25,430 --> 00:58:27,830
So we will combine this actually with the

831
00:58:28,650 --> 00:58:31,300
with the transition we just created

832
00:58:32,280 --> 00:58:39,020
So we will go to the moving head now here and create a new state

833
00:58:40,050 --> 00:58:43,390
And now we have the base state and the second state

834
00:58:43,430 --> 00:58:44,810
And in the second state

835
00:58:44,910 --> 00:58:54,130
I actually want to rotate this head by 360 degrees so it makes one full rotation

836
00:58:55,640 --> 00:58:58,570
So now actually the head is getting rotated now

837
00:58:58,570 --> 00:59:03,810
but we also have to look at the body is

838
00:59:03,820 --> 00:59:05,030
welljump

839
00:59:06,300 --> 00:59:08,570
So it's in this position now

840
00:59:09,300 --> 00:59:11,170
And if we head back over to the head

841
00:59:11,170 --> 00:59:15,870
now we can actually move this up also a little bit

842
00:59:16,260 --> 00:59:18,910
So it's actually losing it

843
00:59:18,920 --> 00:59:20,440
its head while it's jumping

844
00:59:21,410 --> 00:59:28,490
And then we can actually do another transition here back to the original state

845
00:59:29,970 --> 00:59:31,160
So yeah

846
00:59:31,160 --> 00:59:32,250
like this position

847
00:59:32,840 --> 00:59:34,190
So if you look now

848
00:59:37,090 --> 00:59:41,040
Okaywe will actually then copy this y over value

849
00:59:41,110 --> 00:59:44,900
And then we will place it here in the state 2

850
00:59:45,670 --> 00:59:46,990
So now actually

851
00:59:47,400 --> 00:59:48,920
this is the base state now

852
00:59:48,930 --> 00:59:50,230
And if we jump

853
00:59:50,330 --> 00:59:57,680
the head is getting then moved up and also rotate it and

854
00:59:59,750 --> 01:00:02,300
I have to actually change this value again here

855
01:00:02,640 --> 01:00:03,200
So again

856
01:00:03,210 --> 01:00:05,110
360I don away

857
01:00:07,370 --> 01:00:08,910
It's not there anymore

858
01:00:09,050 --> 01:00:09,690
And also here

859
01:00:09,820 --> 01:00:10,830
360

860
01:00:12,890 --> 01:00:14,040
So now it's getting up

861
01:00:14,050 --> 01:00:16,670
rotatedand then it's coming back down

862
01:00:17,590 --> 01:00:18,070
So

863
01:00:18,070 --> 01:00:23,610
and now we have to introduce those states here to our click event

864
01:00:23,610 --> 01:00:24,400
So again

865
01:00:25,050 --> 01:00:29,900
head back over to the E body and then to the mouse down feature

866
01:00:31,550 --> 01:00:34,020
And then this will leave it as it is

867
01:00:34,020 --> 01:00:37,740
Soand then we will do another transition

868
01:00:40,570 --> 01:00:40,610
Okay

869
01:00:40,860 --> 01:00:41,940
this one here

870
01:00:42,350 --> 01:00:43,340
And for the target

871
01:00:43,340 --> 01:00:45,150
now we will choose a moving head

872
01:00:47,590 --> 01:00:53,380
And here we will now do in transition from the current state

873
01:00:53,430 --> 01:00:56,630
in the A state now

874
01:00:57,240 --> 01:01:04,140
And then also we will do a transition back to the state 2 here now

875
01:01:05,560 --> 01:01:08,550
And I think if you simulate this one now

876
01:01:11,060 --> 01:01:11,410
Oh no

877
01:01:11,420 --> 01:01:12,470
this doesn't work

878
01:01:14,280 --> 01:01:17,300
So now if you head back over to the mouse down feature

879
01:01:17,300 --> 01:01:20,020
now you should actually this

880
01:01:20,040 --> 01:01:20,840
this was wrong

881
01:01:20,840 --> 01:01:26,240
You actually have to transition to the state here and then to the state 2

882
01:01:26,360 --> 01:01:27,280
So again

883
01:01:27,280 --> 01:01:29,030
if we look at the states here now

884
01:01:30,460 --> 01:01:32,250
so this is just a base state

885
01:01:32,250 --> 01:01:36,650
And we have to do a transition now from the current state in this state

886
01:01:36,760 --> 01:01:38,720
and then back to the state 2 now

887
01:01:39,940 --> 01:01:43,360
So if we head back over here to the mile down feature

888
01:01:43,560 --> 01:01:44,540
so again

889
01:01:45,130 --> 01:01:52,580
we actually do a transition no matter where we are at the moment to the state where it's actually jumping up the head

890
01:01:53,200 --> 01:01:56,540
And then we will do in transition where it comes down again

891
01:01:56,540 --> 01:01:58,970
So we stay to the So

892
01:01:58,980 --> 01:02:02,940
And now if we simulate again and do this

893
01:02:03,310 --> 01:02:07,080
and I see that the timing is actually not really

894
01:02:07,910 --> 01:02:10,570
it's not really fitting the simulation now

895
01:02:12,020 --> 01:02:14,940
So it's moving way too slowly

896
01:02:15,460 --> 01:02:19,440
So we are actually added the timing now a little bit

897
01:02:20,320 --> 01:02:21,060
So again

898
01:02:21,060 --> 01:02:25,380
we will just head back over to E here to the e-body

899
01:02:25,570 --> 01:02:26,490
and then again

900
01:02:26,500 --> 01:02:28,030
select the mouse down feature

901
01:02:28,040 --> 01:02:28,840
And now we will

902
01:02:29,150 --> 01:02:32,970
we want actually that it's getting faster up

903
01:02:32,970 --> 01:02:36,390
So we will reduce this value

904
01:02:36,390 --> 01:02:38,550
So maybe I will show you

905
01:02:38,930 --> 01:02:41,630
So actually this time is way too slow now

906
01:02:41,740 --> 01:02:42,600
So we increase

907
01:02:42,600 --> 01:02:50,230
we will decrease this time and also decrease the time where the head is actually moving down

908
01:02:51,220 --> 01:02:53,760
So we will do both of the timing events now

909
01:02:54,140 --> 01:03:04,140
So maybe this one like 0．4 and this one like maybe 0．7 now

910
01:03:04,380 --> 01:03:07,510
And now if you simulate again and click on the body

911
01:03:07,670 --> 01:03:12,550
you now see that it's actually it moving quite nicely

912
01:03:15,560 --> 01:03:18,250
The head is actually lifting up

913
01:03:18,760 --> 01:03:20,990
rotatingand then coming back down

914
01:03:22,590 --> 01:03:22,880
So

915
01:03:22,880 --> 01:03:31,790
and you might notice that I actually have to restart the scene every time by menu because the states are actually not repeating

916
01:03:32,110 --> 01:03:35,000
And you could also do it with some toggle features

917
01:03:35,000 --> 01:03:39,840
but this could actually be quite complex for now for this lesson

918
01:03:40,600 --> 01:03:43,370
and to get rid of this

919
01:03:43,900 --> 01:03:48,480
I will actually just do a reload of scene

920
01:03:48,920 --> 01:03:50,350
And to do that

921
01:03:50,450 --> 01:03:53,530
we can just go back to the milestone event here

922
01:03:53,790 --> 01:03:55,080
add a new action

923
01:03:55,090 --> 01:03:59,300
and then we will use the reset scene feature here

924
01:04:00,010 --> 01:04:05,710
You can also bring this down here so you better know that that it will be played in the end

925
01:04:06,810 --> 01:04:08,870
And now you can actually choose a delay here

926
01:04:08,960 --> 01:04:14,820
And now you have to count actually how many seconds your transition transition takes

927
01:04:15,230 --> 01:04:19,020
So maybe mine will now take like here

928
01:04:19,490 --> 01:04:23,360
one second and 0．8 seconds

929
01:04:23,360 --> 01:04:35,370
So a delay of two seconds now should fit now here and now whenever I click now on if and the transition is actually playing

930
01:04:35,370 --> 01:04:37,560
now after two seconds

931
01:04:37,830 --> 01:04:39,250
the scene will be reset it

932
01:04:39,350 --> 01:04:41,560
and then I can actually start over again

933
01:04:42,110 --> 01:04:45,100
So if you simulate now and do the jump

934
01:04:45,560 --> 01:04:50,790
you actually see now that the zoom is reset it

935
01:04:51,280 --> 01:04:56,720
and then I can actually just do this over and over

936
01:04:56,720 --> 01:05:00,700
Soand maybe you can also do some little features here again

937
01:05:00,820 --> 01:05:03,430
and maybe 1

938
01:05:03,440 --> 01:05:05,980
one more little transition here for you guys

939
01:05:06,650 --> 01:05:14,050
We can also make hard like pulsing so we get a little bit more life into Eve

940
01:05:14,800 --> 01:05:15,770
And to do that

941
01:05:15,770 --> 01:05:17,500
we can just make it

942
01:05:17,730 --> 01:05:19,190
we can make a new data

943
01:05:20,070 --> 01:05:20,730
So again

944
01:05:20,730 --> 01:05:22,860
we have the base date in this state here

945
01:05:23,610 --> 01:05:26,390
and then in the second stage

946
01:05:26,510 --> 01:05:30,980
we can actually increase the width of the outline here

947
01:05:32,740 --> 01:05:38,700
And now you see actually that it's increasing in the second state here

948
01:05:40,680 --> 01:05:44,680
And then we can just simply add this one to the start event

949
01:05:45,830 --> 01:05:47,310
add a new action here

950
01:05:47,750 --> 01:05:49,130
and you transition

951
01:05:50,640 --> 01:05:53,260
and then select the heart here

952
01:05:54,040 --> 01:05:59,740
And then we can just choose the base state and the second state here

953
01:06:00,100 --> 01:06:01,930
and one second should be fine

954
01:06:02,500 --> 01:06:06,340
and we want to do this infinitely

955
01:06:07,100 --> 01:06:07,920
And also

956
01:06:07,920 --> 01:06:09,260
we will use the ping pong effect

957
01:06:09,260 --> 01:06:12,410
So it's getting wider and smaller and so on

958
01:06:13,980 --> 01:06:17,190
Soand then you can actually simulate it now

959
01:06:17,200 --> 01:06:20,780
and then you see a little nice pulsing heart here

960
01:06:20,920 --> 01:06:25,770

961
01:06:26,420 --> 01:06:28,570
Soand to summarize everything

962
01:06:28,570 --> 01:06:30,820
we now have the look at feature

963
01:06:31,210 --> 01:06:33,650
we have the jumping animation

964
01:06:34,020 --> 01:06:36,960
and we also have this little pulsing heart

965
01:06:38,270 --> 01:06:38,830
And yeah

966
01:06:38,830 --> 01:06:41,420
