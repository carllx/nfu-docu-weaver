1
00:00:00,410 --> 00:00:02,860
So let's talk about components

2
00:00:02,860 --> 00:00:06,700
So components you may also know from other design resources as well

3
00:00:06,700 --> 00:00:16,900
So they are actually a common way to make things much more easier and to actually enhance your workflow and to show you guys what components do

4
00:00:16,910 --> 00:00:19,380
we will actually make a little project out of it

5
00:00:19,640 --> 00:00:20,490
But again

6
00:00:20,490 --> 00:00:23,200
if you don't want to do all of the steps

7
00:00:23,200 --> 00:00:29,420
you can also get the fire from Spline community or in the download section down below

8
00:00:29,820 --> 00:00:33,600
But we will actually just make a little project here in Spline now

9
00:00:33,930 --> 00:00:34,460
So we

10
00:00:34,470 --> 00:00:38,680
againwe have our base plane here and the DFAT scene

11
00:00:39,540 --> 00:00:45,280
And we will just maybe make a little cube here on on top of the plane

12
00:00:46,090 --> 00:00:48,320
make it a little bit bigger here

13
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:49,720
So like that

14
00:00:50,580 --> 00:00:51,330
And then again

15
00:00:51,330 --> 00:00:55,400
we can just hide the rectangle layer here

16
00:00:57,290 --> 00:01:04,990
And I will change the background color here to maybe a little light black

17
00:01:06,180 --> 00:01:09,490
Soand now we have this little cube here

18
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:11,110
and on top of the cube

19
00:01:11,310 --> 00:01:17,400
I will actually place another rectangle and this will be a button later on

20
00:01:17,770 --> 00:01:22,790
So I will make this a little bit bigger like that

21
00:01:22,790 --> 00:01:24,930
So quickly

22
00:01:24,930 --> 00:01:25,790
another color here

23
00:01:25,790 --> 00:01:31,830
so you see the difference better and also give it some corners here

24
00:01:33,020 --> 00:01:34,450
also some extrusion

25
00:01:35,440 --> 00:01:41,000
I will just go for the nut for the other view here

26
00:01:41,480 --> 00:01:41,540
maybe like

27
00:01:43,550 --> 00:01:45,290
Even though not about the corners

28
00:01:45,320 --> 00:01:47,830
the extrusion here maybe like

29
00:01:49,800 --> 00:01:51,090
yeahmaybe like 13

30
00:01:52,800 --> 00:01:56,280
So reduce the corners here a little bit again

31
00:01:57,510 --> 00:02:00,480
Okayand you can also give it some bevel here

32
00:02:00,480 --> 00:02:01,720
maybe like 2

33
00:02:03,730 --> 00:02:05,800
And on top of this rectangle

34
00:02:05,970 --> 00:02:08,420
I will place a text now

35
00:02:08,950 --> 00:02:11,750
And this text will be press

36
00:02:13,770 --> 00:02:17,380
And now we have to actually resize the text here

37
00:02:19,050 --> 00:02:20,900
bring it onto the button

38
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:27,660
So make it a little bit tiny edges

39
00:02:27,970 --> 00:02:31,420
So maybe like or 10 is a little bit small

40
00:02:32,460 --> 00:02:33,880
maybe like 12

41
00:02:36,060 --> 00:02:40,240
And then we can also just do some spacing actually here

42
00:02:40,540 --> 00:02:41,660
maybe like that

43
00:02:43,830 --> 00:02:45,300
Place it to the center here

44
00:02:51,530 --> 00:02:51,940
Okay

45
00:02:51,960 --> 00:02:54,620
this I leave a little bit more to the right

46
00:02:55,770 --> 00:02:56,530
Okaylike that

47
00:02:57,210 --> 00:02:58,410
And then here on the bottom

48
00:02:58,980 --> 00:03:02,140
we will introduce a sphere actually

49
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:05,850
and this one will be later on

50
00:03:06,450 --> 00:03:07,930
Yeahlike a light bulb maybe

51
00:03:07,930 --> 00:03:12,450
maybe a little bit smaller and like that

52
00:03:14,430 --> 00:03:16,300
Againbring it to the center here

53
00:03:18,090 --> 00:03:18,570
All right

54
00:03:19,060 --> 00:03:21,790
and then I will rearrange the view here again

55
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:24,010
And I don't want it to be spherical

56
00:03:24,010 --> 00:03:29,580
so I will actually bring it a little bit to this side here

57
00:03:31,190 --> 00:03:32,330
make it centered

58
00:03:33,340 --> 00:03:37,480
And this one is actually just the basic

59
00:03:38,180 --> 00:03:40,370
yeahdesign we will do

60
00:03:40,380 --> 00:03:42,630
And now for

61
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:46,170
And now actually

62
00:03:46,170 --> 00:03:48,840
I will just quickly rename everything here

63
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:50,860
So this one will be a light bulb

64
00:03:54,320 --> 00:03:56,810
This one is button text

65
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:03,750
This one is a button rectangle

66
00:04:05,430 --> 00:04:07,120
And both of them

67
00:04:07,130 --> 00:04:12,680
I will actually group up and then rename this one to button

68
00:04:12,910 --> 00:04:13,830
So again

69
00:04:13,950 --> 00:04:20,590
group is just command and G and the coupon will be our body

70
00:04:25,830 --> 00:04:27,440
And yeah

71
00:04:27,940 --> 00:04:29,300
this should be it

72
00:04:29,480 --> 00:04:31,440
Maybe actually because of the light bulb

73
00:04:31,480 --> 00:04:35,910
we will actually also introduce a point light here

74
00:04:36,300 --> 00:04:37,340
So it actually

75
00:04:39,670 --> 00:04:41,040
This light and up

76
00:04:41,070 --> 00:04:42,060
So bring it here

77
00:04:42,060 --> 00:04:46,610
maybe to the center and also to the center of this side

78
00:04:48,640 --> 00:04:49,690
And yeah

79
00:04:49,700 --> 00:04:50,670
this looks good

80
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:54,640
And then actually everything up this

81
00:04:54,650 --> 00:05:01,710
we will also group up and we will rename it component

82
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:06,220
Yeahmaybe component group

83
00:05:08,970 --> 00:05:09,580
Okay

84
00:05:11,020 --> 00:05:15,890
soand then we will actually start over with some of the materials

85
00:05:16,610 --> 00:05:19,480
And maybe I will just start with the body here

86
00:05:19,710 --> 00:05:20,670
And f​‌​‌​​‌‌​​‌‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌​​‌‌​​‌‌‌​‌‌​​‌‌​​‌‌​​‌‌​‌​‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌​‌‌​​​‌‌‌‌‌‌​​‌‌​‌‌‌​​‌‌​‌​‌​​‌‌‌​‌‌​​‌‌​​​‌​​‌‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌​‌‌‌‌‌​‌​‌‌​​​‌‌​​​‌​​‌‌​‌​‌‌‌​‌​‌​‌​​‌‌​‌​‌​​‌‌‌​​‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌​​​‌‌‌​‌‌​​‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌​​‌‌‌​‌‌​​‌‌​‌‌​​​‌‌​​‌‌​​‌‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌​‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌​​​‌‌‌​​‌​​‌‌‌‌‌​​​‌‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌​‌‌​​​‌‌‌‌‌‌​​‌‌‌‌‌‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌‌​​‌‌‌​‌​‌‌‌​​‌‌​​‌‌​​‌‌​‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌​​​‌‌‌​‌‌​​‌‌​​​‌​​‌‌​​‌‌​​‌‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌​‌‌‌​​‌‌‌‌‌​​​‌‌​‌‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌​‌‌​​‌‌​‌​‌‌‌​‌‌​​‌​​‌‌​‌​‌​​‌‌​‌‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌​‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌​‌‌​​​‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌‌​​‌‌‌​‌​‌​‌‌‌​‌​‌​‌‌‌​‌​‌‌‌‌‌​‌​‌​‌​​‌‌​‌​‌​​‌‌​‌​‌‌‌​‌‌​​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌‌​​‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌​​‌‌‌​​‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌​‌‌​​​‌‌‌​​‌‌‌​‌​‌‌‌‌‌​‌​‌‌‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌​​‌‌​‌‌‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌​‌‌​​‌‌​​‌‌​​‌‌​‌​‌​​‌‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌​‌​‌‌‌​‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌​‌‌​​‌‌‌​​‌​​‌‌​‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌​‌‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌​​​‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌​​‌​​‌‌​‌​‌‌‌​‌​‌‌‌​​‌‌​‌‌​​​‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌​‌‌‌​​‌‌‌‌‌​​​‌‌​‌​‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌‌​​‌‌‌​‌​‌‌‌‌‌​‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌‌​​‌‌‌‌‌‌​​‌‌​‌‌‌​​‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌‌​​‌​​‌‌​​‌‌​​‌‌‌​​‌​​‌‌‌​​‌​​‌‌​‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌or somebody

87
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:26,280
I will actually maybe reduce the con see a little bit

88
00:05:26,980 --> 00:05:32,150
so maybe like that and just make it a little bit darker here

89
00:05:33,960 --> 00:05:36,550
Maybe we can just give it some madcap here

90
00:05:36,570 --> 00:05:37,290
actually

91
00:05:37,390 --> 00:05:38,550
So choose Madcap

92
00:05:39,090 --> 00:05:44,700
maybe this one here from the library and choose overlay

93
00:05:45,950 --> 00:05:47,330
maybe not 100

94
00:05:47,490 --> 00:05:49,620
but like 60 opacity

95
00:05:50,500 --> 00:05:52,140
So this looks actually quite good

96
00:05:53,020 --> 00:05:54,020
And for the button

97
00:05:55,010 --> 00:05:58,540
we will just make it a little bit darker here

98
00:06:00,460 --> 00:06:01,250
so like that

99
00:06:01,490 --> 00:06:04,920
So we go with the dark mode now here

100
00:06:05,770 --> 00:06:06,840
and for the text

101
00:06:06,940 --> 00:06:08,720
I will choose white

102
00:06:08,870 --> 00:06:15,140
but I will actually change the opacity here to 50 because later on we will actually make a transition

103
00:06:15,140 --> 00:06:18,240
So when this button is pressed

104
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:20,360
the opacity will then change to 100

105
00:06:20,360 --> 00:06:22,300
So we have a little nice effect here

106
00:06:23,040 --> 00:06:25,060
but this should be fine

107
00:06:25,060 --> 00:06:25,870
Now here

108
00:06:27,060 --> 00:06:28,480
and for the light bulb

109
00:06:29,220 --> 00:06:37,500
we will introduce the layer here and so just create the depth layer here

110
00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:40,070
bring it to the first position here

111
00:06:40,640 --> 00:06:41,940
And for the dev one

112
00:06:41,940 --> 00:06:43,870
we will use a linear function

113
00:06:45,060 --> 00:06:46,810
And for the near factor

114
00:06:46,950 --> 00:06:48,520
maybe choose 70

115
00:06:49,160 --> 00:06:50,270
And for the far

116
00:06:51,080 --> 00:06:53,080
will you use -70

117
00:06:55,260 --> 00:06:58,770
Soand to actually see the gradient

118
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:01,430
just remove the color layer here

119
00:07:01,500 --> 00:07:04,030
And then you will actually see the dev layer

120
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:06,840
And for the dev layer

121
00:07:06,840 --> 00:07:10,830
we will also use a kind of dark mode here

122
00:07:12,740 --> 00:07:13,720
So maybe

123
00:07:13,740 --> 00:07:14,450
maybe like that

124
00:07:17,620 --> 00:07:18,890
And for the lighting

125
00:07:18,890 --> 00:07:21,300
we will actually bring it up to 100

126
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:28,760
And then we will also introduce an outline layer here

127
00:07:29,940 --> 00:07:31,050
Make it white

128
00:07:31,570 --> 00:07:33,990
So we have a little bit of contour here

129
00:07:34,790 --> 00:07:36,660
The width 2 is all right

130
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,950
And we will change this one to overlay

131
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:43,790
And then for the real bulb effect

132
00:07:43,790 --> 00:07:48,120
we will actually introduce a rainbow layer and this one

133
00:07:48,120 --> 00:07:50,170
we will simply maybe

134
00:07:50,260 --> 00:07:57,260
yeahdo like 20 opacity and also do an overlay here

135
00:07:58,160 --> 00:08:02,830
And now this one looks maybe like light or something

136
00:08:04,590 --> 00:08:07,840
Alrightso this one is our basic shape here

137
00:08:08,410 --> 00:08:10,270
It's all grouped up in the component

138
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:16,700
Maybe I will rename the point light real quick to light source

139
00:08:18,920 --> 00:08:19,840
Like that

140
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:24,410
And what do we actually didn't change with the light source here

141
00:08:24,570 --> 00:08:29,740
So I will actually maybe just increase the light effect here

142
00:08:29,740 --> 00:08:31,280
maybe to 1．4

143
00:08:31,350 --> 00:08:34,770
the distance to 2300

144
00:08:35,080 --> 00:08:37,410
and also give it a little bit of DK

145
00:08:37,780 --> 00:08:39,170
so maybe like 6

146
00:08:39,570 --> 00:08:43,490
And now you see we have little nice light effect here on the edge

147
00:08:44,820 --> 00:08:47,340
So this one looks quite good

148
00:08:47,830 --> 00:08:50,630
Maybe some tax adjustments

149
00:08:50,710 --> 00:08:52,630
Maybe I will go with 10 here

150
00:08:53,820 --> 00:08:54,250
So it's a bit

151
00:08:54,260 --> 00:08:56,600
a little more minimal here

152
00:08:59,400 --> 00:08:59,940
So like that

153
00:09:00,970 --> 00:09:01,980
Alright

154
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:06,220
soand to actually make this one a component

155
00:09:06,400 --> 00:09:09,160
we will actually just select the component group

157
00:09:10,580 --> 00:09:13,650
and then choose the create component function here

158
00:09:14,050 --> 00:09:15,860
Soand if you created a component

159
00:09:15,880 --> 00:09:18,910
you actually see it here by the four green dots

160
00:09:19,180 --> 00:09:22,200
So this one is the main component now

161
00:09:22,860 --> 00:09:28,450
And to maybe give you a little quick hint of what a component now is

162
00:09:28,810 --> 00:09:35,960
if we now maybe like duplicate this component here and we will move it to the right here

163
00:09:37,270 --> 00:09:41,900
So it looks for you like a simple copy now of the left one

164
00:09:42,150 --> 00:09:43,500
But on the left side

165
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:47,740
you now see that this copy now has two little green dots

166
00:09:47,750 --> 00:09:50,750
And this one indicates that it's a child component

167
00:09:50,760 --> 00:09:55,740
Actuallyyou may know it from like programming languages or something

168
00:09:55,740 --> 00:10:01,160
So you have a parent and child function or remain and child component

169
00:10:01,260 --> 00:10:02,540
I will call it now

170
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:06,610
So and what is the magic actually behind the component

171
00:10:06,620 --> 00:10:13,360
So I will actually now choose the main component here and make some quick adaptions here to the body

172
00:10:14,030 --> 00:10:14,960
And now what you see

173
00:10:14,960 --> 00:10:19,300
actuallywhile I'm changing the width here of the cube or the body

174
00:10:20,140 --> 00:10:27,210
actually the child element is also getting changed now in real time or simultaneously

175
00:10:28,060 --> 00:10:32,170
And this is not also just for the cube

176
00:10:32,270 --> 00:10:35,620
but actually for every element here inside of the main component

177
00:10:36,440 --> 00:10:37,700
So for example

178
00:10:38,060 --> 00:10:42,460
I can also just change the text here to maybe like button

179
00:10:43,070 --> 00:10:46,460
And you see that simultaneously

180
00:10:46,460 --> 00:10:49,690
the text of the child element is getting also changed

181
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:54,980
I will just call it press here again

182
00:10:55,830 --> 00:10:57,470
But this effect is

183
00:10:57,710 --> 00:11:01,520
againjust used for every element here inside of the main component

184
00:11:01,810 --> 00:11:02,710
So for example

185
00:11:02,710 --> 00:11:06,070
I can also choose a red light here for the light source

186
00:11:06,360 --> 00:11:11,820
or maybe I can make the button here bigger

187
00:11:12,330 --> 00:11:18,130
or I can change the color of the light bulb actually

188
00:11:18,580 --> 00:11:21,060
So it can make it maybe like red

189
00:11:22,860 --> 00:11:31,610
So you see actually that every change here of the main component also affect the child component

190
00:11:31,620 --> 00:11:34,330
And now you can imagine if I make like

191
00:11:34,630 --> 00:11:35,260
I don't know

192
00:11:35,260 --> 00:11:39,430
100 hundreds of duplications here of the main component

193
00:11:39,770 --> 00:11:47,660
it can be quite time saving because actually every child component is getting the changes of the main one as well

194
00:11:48,690 --> 00:11:55,710
And what's now also nice about components is that if you make changes on the chain component

195
00:11:56,630 --> 00:11:59,940
those one will actually not affect each other

196
00:11:59,950 --> 00:12:06,070
So maybe I will actually give you another child element here on the right side

197
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:08,250
So maybe like that

198
00:12:13,630 --> 00:12:16,320
I will just quickly rearrange it here now

199
00:12:16,330 --> 00:12:19,140
So you have this one as the main component

200
00:12:19,550 --> 00:12:20,600
This one is a child

201
00:12:20,610 --> 00:12:21,980
and this one is also a child

202
00:12:23,560 --> 00:12:25,330
Soand if I

203
00:12:25,340 --> 00:12:26,110
for example

204
00:12:26,110 --> 00:12:30,770
now want to change this one

205
00:12:30,770 --> 00:12:37,240
the child here to maybe like light mode maybe or a light lighter version of the

206
00:12:38,290 --> 00:12:39,460
of the main component

207
00:12:39,460 --> 00:12:46,890
you can just simply do all or everything you want here and this will not affect the rest of the components

208
00:12:47,640 --> 00:12:49,910
So if you make changes on any child component

209
00:12:49,990 --> 00:12:54,270
it will not affect any of other child components or the main component

210
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:58,560
So we call it actually an overrides

211
00:12:58,560 --> 00:13:01,590
So every time you make change to a child component

212
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:03,860
it overrides the value of the main component

213
00:13:06,470 --> 00:13:11,580
I can actually just do some changes here to this chart element

214
00:13:11,770 --> 00:13:14,140
and it will not affect anything

215
00:13:15,020 --> 00:13:21,220
And this one can be quite helpful because you can make just other versions of designs here

216
00:13:21,220 --> 00:13:21,790
So for example

217
00:13:21,990 --> 00:13:29,160
thisI will just maybe quickly make this one a little bit brighter here

218
00:13:32,370 --> 00:13:33,580
Or maybe not this one

219
00:13:34,140 --> 00:13:35,140
We keep it as it is

220
00:13:35,410 --> 00:13:38,610
But now you actually see we just created like a white

221
00:13:38,620 --> 00:13:41,200
a white version here of the black version

222
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:45,910
And this one you can just do for like thousands of versions

223
00:13:47,570 --> 00:13:50,470
This can be actually just quite helpful

224
00:13:51,060 --> 00:13:51,510
So

225
00:13:51,510 --> 00:13:56,080
and what's actually also nice about components is that you can

226
00:13:56,090 --> 00:14:02,930
yeahmake changes to the So the main components will then also affect all of the child components

227
00:14:03,460 --> 00:14:04,410
So for example

228
00:14:04,410 --> 00:14:08,910
I can now just do the designs for every button here

229
00:14:08,920 --> 00:14:17,270
but I can also just introduce other features like I could just make a change here to the to this component

230
00:14:17,280 --> 00:14:21,040
actually bring it inside of the main one

231
00:14:21,170 --> 00:14:26,880
And then you actually see that all of the other child components also get this new design element

232
00:14:27,890 --> 00:14:32,130
But this is not also just for design elements

233
00:14:32,140 --> 00:14:37,890
but you can also make transitions or like animations or anything you want

234
00:14:38,280 --> 00:14:39,320
So for example

235
00:14:39,430 --> 00:14:51,480
I can now introduce the state here to the button and now we have a base state and state And now if you look inside of the child components

236
00:14:51,480 --> 00:14:53,470
you actually see that simultaneously

237
00:14:53,820 --> 00:14:58,080
all of the buttons actually also get this state

238
00:14:58,600 --> 00:15:03,220
So and for the state now I will actually want to

239
00:15:03,860 --> 00:15:05,710
so this will be the button

240
00:15:06,380 --> 00:15:08,220
but in the button state here

241
00:15:08,230 --> 00:15:11,820
I will actually want that it moves inside of here

242
00:15:12,200 --> 00:15:20,820
so it's like clicked and then I actually also want it

243
00:15:23,110 --> 00:15:24,130
The text element

244
00:15:24,220 --> 00:15:27,200
So we will make a change here as well

245
00:15:27,220 --> 00:15:29,700
So introduce another state to the button text

246
00:15:30,400 --> 00:15:33,550
I now want that in the second stage

247
00:15:33,690 --> 00:15:36,570
the opacity will be changed to 100

248
00:15:37,260 --> 00:15:40,100
So now we have a base state and state here

249
00:15:40,130 --> 00:15:43,060
and this will just change the opacity of the button

250
00:15:45,380 --> 00:15:50,980
Soand then I can actually make an event now

251
00:15:51,240 --> 00:15:52,630
And for the event

252
00:15:53,070 --> 00:15:57,400
I will choose the mouse down function here and add a transition

253
00:15:58,100 --> 00:15:59,450
So n for the transition

254
00:16:00,010 --> 00:16:07,290
we will use the toggle mode and do a transition here from the base state to the state

255
00:16:07,860 --> 00:16:11,700
And this one we will do in 0．2 seconds

256
00:16:12,100 --> 00:16:13,520
And for the transition

257
00:16:13,520 --> 00:16:15,060
we will make it linear

258
00:16:16,910 --> 00:16:18,300
And now you actually see

259
00:16:18,310 --> 00:16:19,280
if I simulate

260
00:16:19,290 --> 00:16:24,090
now you see that the button actually hovers inside while I'm pressing it

261
00:16:25,050 --> 00:16:26,500
So because of the toggle function

262
00:16:26,810 --> 00:16:30,370
I can actually just press it however I want

263
00:16:30,670 --> 00:16:34,770
And now it's just cool about it because we are in a component based group

264
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:39,580
I can now actually do this for every other of the child components here

265
00:16:41,860 --> 00:16:45,400
And since we can just now exceed further

266
00:16:45,460 --> 00:16:46,450
So again

267
00:16:46,450 --> 00:16:52,550
we just actually I change the opacity of the texture in the second state

268
00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:56,420
And this 1 I will also introduce now to this transition group

269
00:16:57,400 --> 00:17:00,110
So do create a new transition here

270
00:17:00,110 --> 00:17:05,770
And this one will affect the button text again

271
00:17:05,770 --> 00:17:07,010
also in toggle mode

272
00:17:07,570 --> 00:17:15,420
And it will do a transition from the base state to the state and also in 0．2 seconds

273
00:17:18,170 --> 00:17:21,280
And then now if we simulate again

274
00:17:21,330 --> 00:17:26,310
you see now that the opacity is changed while I'm clicking it

275
00:17:27,390 --> 00:17:30,400
Also for this one and also for this one actually

276
00:17:32,870 --> 00:17:33,250
So

277
00:17:33,250 --> 00:17:38,030
and now we can actually just do it as well for the light bulb maybe

278
00:17:38,030 --> 00:17:40,680
So we will introduce a new state

279
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:42,880
And for this state

280
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:46,790
we will actually change the depth color here to maybe

281
00:17:48,270 --> 00:17:51,200
maybe here like a light red and here a darker red

282
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:54,980
Select that

283
00:17:56,560 --> 00:18:02,490
And then we will also introduce another state for the light source

284
00:18:03,160 --> 00:18:03,790
So again

285
00:18:03,790 --> 00:18:05,990
we have a base state and the state here

286
00:18:06,050 --> 00:18:07,930
And in the second state

287
00:18:07,990 --> 00:18:11,760
I want the light source color to be red

288
00:18:14,840 --> 00:18:23,140
And now we can also introduce this one to the button event here

289
00:18:23,460 --> 00:18:24,080
So again

290
00:18:24,080 --> 00:18:29,180
doing the transition 1 for the light bulb here

291
00:18:29,740 --> 00:18:34,170
Also choose a toggle function base state and state

292
00:18:34,690 --> 00:18:38,920
give it 0．4 seconds maybe

293
00:18:39,280 --> 00:18:41,070
and choose the linear 1

294
00:18:43,060 --> 00:18:44,680
So we have this one

295
00:18:44,700 --> 00:18:50,280
and then also a transition for the light source

296
00:18:50,780 --> 00:18:54,900
Choose toggle from base state to state

297
00:18:55,510 --> 00:18:59,910
give it also like 0．4 seconds and all

298
00:19:00,010 --> 00:19:01,790
So a linear effect

299
00:19:04,280 --> 00:19:06,700
So now if we made everything correct

300
00:19:06,710 --> 00:19:12,110
we're pressing the button and the light source and the light bulb will actually change

301
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:15,790
And this one will also affect every of our component

302
00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:22,060
And now you can imagine now that we can make different versions

303
00:19:22,060 --> 00:19:22,540
Now again

304
00:19:22,540 --> 00:19:24,310
in the child components

305
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:25,440
So for example

306
00:19:25,480 --> 00:19:30,730
now if I'm choosing the light bulb here in the second state

307
00:19:30,840 --> 00:19:33,550
I can actually recolor it here

308
00:19:33,550 --> 00:19:34,060
for example

309
00:19:34,390 --> 00:19:36,740
So maybe like green

310
00:19:37,670 --> 00:19:38,660
so a light green

311
00:19:39,660 --> 00:19:40,410
the dark green

312
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:43,880
so like that

313
00:19:45,360 --> 00:19:51,570
And then also choose the second state of the light source here and make it green

314
00:19:54,300 --> 00:19:56,070
And now if you simulate again

315
00:19:56,070 --> 00:19:57,880
actuallyand press this one

316
00:19:57,880 --> 00:19:58,900
it will be red

317
00:19:59,210 --> 00:20:00,640
And if you press this one

318
00:20:00,650 --> 00:20:01,970
it will be green

319
00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:09,230
And maybe just for the other components component as well

320
00:20:09,250 --> 00:20:13,690
So I can make this one in the second stage

321
00:20:13,900 --> 00:20:15,790
like blue now

322
00:20:20,970 --> 00:20:24,870
Give it a light blue and some darker blue

323
00:20:26,320 --> 00:20:27,960
And also for the light source

324
00:20:27,960 --> 00:20:30,490
againin the second stage

325
00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:34,530
give it some blue color

326
00:20:39,860 --> 00:20:40,480
So

327
00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:47,730
Now

328
00:20:47,730 --> 00:20:52,640
you can imagine actually that if you have like many more of those elements

329
00:20:52,640 --> 00:21:09,750
it can be just quite helpful that you choose the component structure because you can just make changes to everything and also just give it some like specific edits here just for some of the elements

330
00:21:11,320 --> 00:21:16,050
Soand now what I actually also want to choose is that you can also do some

331
00:21:16,490 --> 00:21:17,870
yeahrevert steps

332
00:21:17,870 --> 00:21:24,760
So maybe if you don't want actually that this child's element has some overrided settings

333
00:21:24,760 --> 00:21:27,860
like the light bulb or the button or something else

334
00:21:27,870 --> 00:21:37,960
you can also just click any time the child component here and just reset all overrides or push changes to the main

335
00:21:37,960 --> 00:21:42,070
You can also just adapt those changes to the main component

336
00:21:42,310 --> 00:21:45,430
but you can also just reset all of the overrides

337
00:21:45,430 --> 00:21:48,410
And now you have just simply the same

338
00:21:49,520 --> 00:21:52,120
Yeahsame settings as the main component now

339
00:21:52,320 --> 00:21:55,040
And now maybe for clarification

340
00:21:55,050 --> 00:21:59,360
I will just simply change this one again to green here

341
00:22:03,130 --> 00:22:07,740
So because later this will be published in the Spine community

342
00:22:07,740 --> 00:22:08,630
So we have just

343
00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:13,950
yeaha nice cleaned up project here

344
00:22:15,170 --> 00:22:17,830
And also for the light source again

345
00:22:20,390 --> 00:22:20,960
So like that

346
00:22:21,770 --> 00:22:23,350
And now we have like a red

347
00:22:23,350 --> 00:22:25,860
the green and the blue button here

348
00:22:30,130 --> 00:22:30,720
All right

349
00:22:31,460 --> 00:22:35,960
and now maybe one little function as well you can

350
00:22:36,600 --> 00:22:37,860
I actually also

351
00:22:37,870 --> 00:22:42,410
if you just copy this one again and make a new chart element

352
00:22:44,380 --> 00:22:45,980
you can do it anytime

353
00:22:45,980 --> 00:22:49,330
Just unlink everything of the component here

354
00:22:49,340 --> 00:22:51,040
So here's a little unlink function

355
00:22:51,700 --> 00:22:53,470
and if you click on it

356
00:22:53,480 --> 00:22:54,450
it will actually be

357
00:22:55,540 --> 00:22:58,450
will be converted to a normal instance here

358
00:22:58,590 --> 00:23:06,830
So this one is just the same like group we just created before we did all of the component work

359
00:23:06,840 --> 00:23:07,480
So this

360
00:23:07,830 --> 00:23:15,600
yeahyou can also just do so this one will be then not affected by any of the components settings

361
00:23:15,610 --> 00:23:16,000
yeah

362
00:23:26,410 --> 00:23:27,940
So now you have just

363
00:23:27,940 --> 00:23:30,090
againall of the buttons here

364
00:23:30,100 --> 00:23:30,700
And we just

365
00:23:31,470 --> 00:23:32,610
as you see now

366
00:23:32,610 --> 00:23:35,460
we just change the color of all of the child elements

367
00:23:35,690 --> 00:23:41,780
So this is one specific advantage of the component groups here

368
00:23:41,950 --> 00:23:42,450
But again

369
00:23:42,450 --> 00:23:44,580
you can just play around with it

370
00:23:44,580 --> 00:23:45,550
So for example

371
00:23:45,550 --> 00:23:51,290
we just now change some appearance settings here of the light bulbs

372
00:23:51,300 --> 00:23:57,160
But maybe now you can also like just go inside of the main component again here

373
00:23:57,260 --> 00:23:58,050
for example

374
00:23:58,560 --> 00:24:00,980
choose all of the functions here

375
00:24:01,370 --> 00:24:04,280
And now we can actually make the transition

376
00:24:04,280 --> 00:24:05,060
for example

377
00:24:05,060 --> 00:24:08,380
just longer for every of the components here

378
00:24:08,580 --> 00:24:09,900
So for example

379
00:24:09,900 --> 00:24:12,240
now I will not use the button and text function

380
00:24:12,250 --> 00:24:14,710
but maybe like the light function here

381
00:24:15,010 --> 00:24:16,170
So for example

382
00:24:16,170 --> 00:24:22,960
we can just maybe use two seconds here for the light bulb and also for the light source

383
00:24:23,400 --> 00:24:29,460
Now you can again see that actually that the functional also just

384
00:24:30,950 --> 00:24:37,490
and now you actually see that all of those changes now adapt to the child elements as well

385
00:24:37,600 --> 00:24:39,160
So if I click now on it

386
00:24:39,570 --> 00:24:43,250
you now see that the light is changed now more slowly

387
00:24:43,260 --> 00:24:46,250
And this one also for all of the child elements

388
00:24:46,800 --> 00:24:47,460
So again

389
00:24:47,460 --> 00:24:50,470
this is one big advantage of using components

390
00:24:51,750 --> 00:24:52,220
So

391
00:24:52,230 --> 00:24:58,820
and also a nice way to actually use components is in combinations with other functions

392
00:24:58,830 --> 00:24:59,310
So for example

393
00:24:59,890 --> 00:25:01,240
the clone module

394
00:25:01,530 --> 00:25:07,030
so maybe I will just show it here with the body element

395
00:25:07,030 --> 00:25:17,400
So just duplicate the body element and actually bring it out of the instance group and maybe give it also a little brighter color

396
00:25:18,370 --> 00:25:26,550
So we will bring this one down here and maybe make it a little bit longer here

397
00:25:27,370 --> 00:25:28,390
And now again

398
00:25:28,390 --> 00:25:31,010
as we just saw in some of the other lessons

399
00:25:31,010 --> 00:25:37,810
we can just activate the cloner module here and then choose how many clones we want

400
00:25:38,830 --> 00:25:43,240
Soand maybe I will also give them a little bit of twist

401
00:25:43,250 --> 00:25:45,080
like 20 degrees

402
00:25:46,510 --> 00:25:49,720
Soand now you actually see that you have a lot of

403
00:25:50,180 --> 00:25:52,160
yeahshapes created here

404
00:25:52,270 --> 00:25:55,360
Againif you change this main shape here

405
00:25:55,370 --> 00:25:57,770
you will also change everything

406
00:25:57,940 --> 00:25:59,950
every shape of the cloner module

407
00:26:00,360 --> 00:26:06,520
but you can now not access like any of those elements you created by the clone element

408
00:26:06,920 --> 00:26:07,940
But to do this

409
00:26:07,940 --> 00:26:11,340
we can actually just convert this one to instances

410
00:26:12,070 --> 00:26:16,780
And now you see actually that you have those body two clones here

411
00:26:16,900 --> 00:26:18,760
And now if you look inside of it

412
00:26:19,110 --> 00:26:26,300
you now see that every of the cloner element is actually converted to a child instance here

413
00:26:26,630 --> 00:26:32,330
So now we have this one here indicated with the four green dots as our main component

414
00:26:32,810 --> 00:26:36,510
and this one with the two green dots actually as our child components

415
00:26:37,760 --> 00:26:43,040
And now as we just did here in the project here

416
00:26:43,050 --> 00:26:48,580
we can actually just choose anything here of the child components and change it

417
00:26:49,030 --> 00:26:49,840
So for example

418
00:26:49,840 --> 00:26:53,500
I would just now change the color here of this element

419
00:26:53,500 --> 00:26:54,720
So maybe like green

420
00:26:54,970 --> 00:26:57,000
And also for this one

421
00:26:58,260 --> 00:26:59,310
maybeoh

422
00:26:59,470 --> 00:26:59,940
this one

423
00:27:04,660 --> 00:27:05,630
And now again

424
00:27:05,740 --> 00:27:09,180
because we are in a components based group here

425
00:27:09,190 --> 00:27:10,590
you can now just again

426
00:27:10,590 --> 00:27:13,920
make changes to the main component

427
00:27:13,930 --> 00:27:15,550
So like that

428
00:27:16,500 --> 00:27:17,430
But you can also

429
00:27:17,430 --> 00:27:22,360
againjust edit some of the child components here

430
00:27:22,380 --> 00:27:25,850
And this one will affect just not all childs

431
00:27:27,020 --> 00:27:30,350
So you can just play around with it

432
00:27:30,350 --> 00:27:32,120
You can change every property

433
00:27:32,120 --> 00:27:34,990
You can do transitions or something else

434
00:27:35,510 --> 00:27:38,360
But this is also quite helpful in the cloner module

435
00:27:38,370 --> 00:27:39,810
And yeah

436
00:27:39,820 --> 00:27:42,390
this is also a quite nice function

437
00:27:42,880 --> 00:27:44,980
which you can do with components
