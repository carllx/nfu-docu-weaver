00:00:00,010 --> 00:00:00,460
Hi guys

2
00:00:00,460 --> 00:00:01,490
so in this lesson

3
00:00:01,490 --> 00:00:07,840
we will actually recreate this flight controlling unit from the wind wind wing

4
00:00:08,790 --> 00:00:09,870
So in specific

5
00:00:09,870 --> 00:00:11,520
this middle part here

6
00:00:11,530 --> 00:00:16,310
maybe we will do the other parts as well later on in the course

7
00:00:16,310 --> 00:00:16,890
But for now

8
00:00:16,890 --> 00:00:23,920
we will actually focus just on the body part to not exceed the video duration limit

9
00:00:24,770 --> 00:00:26,810
And yeah

10
00:00:26,820 --> 00:00:33,570
So to start now we will actually make a simple screenshot of the flight controlling unit

11
00:00:35,110 --> 00:00:41,890
And then we will head over to a default spline scene now and actually import this screenshot

12
00:00:42,220 --> 00:00:43,190
So to do so

13
00:00:43,190 --> 00:00:53,580
just click on the bottom left side here on the import button and then choose image and then choose your screenshot file here

14
00:00:54,370 --> 00:01:00,830
And I will actually move this up a little bit and maybe also resize it

15
00:01:01,020 --> 00:01:03,850
So would you like 25%

16
00:01:04,220 --> 00:01:15,390
So I will actually just make every coordinate here to 0．25 and then move this down here

17
00:01:17,820 --> 00:01:18,400
Okay

18
00:01:18,990 --> 00:01:26,990
and now we can actually just maybe change the background as well to just simply black

19
00:01:27,870 --> 00:01:29,350
And then we can actually

20
00:01:31,420 --> 00:01:33,300
Rename this real quick

21
00:01:33,300 --> 00:01:37,400
So the screenshot so we know which element it is

22
00:01:37,970 --> 00:01:40,690
Rename the screenshot to anything you want

23
00:01:40,700 --> 00:01:43,340
I will just choose screenshot for now

24
00:01:44,870 --> 00:01:45,710
And yeah

25
00:01:45,720 --> 00:01:48,750
then we can actually just start right away

26
00:01:49,170 --> 00:01:50,340
And to do so

27
00:01:50,340 --> 00:01:55,150
I will actually just start by the body element now

28
00:01:55,300 --> 00:01:56,170
And to do so

29
00:01:56,170 --> 00:01:59,940
we can maybe just like choose a cube here

30
00:02:00,900 --> 00:02:03,200
So place it on the place plane now

31
00:02:03,810 --> 00:02:05,320
And for the size

32
00:02:05,330 --> 00:02:13,710
I will actually choose something like 190 and maybe

33
00:02:27,250 --> 00:02:27,610
So

34
00:02:27,610 --> 00:02:30,690
and then we can actually use just a simple cube element

35
00:02:30,690 --> 00:02:33,000
So place it on the base plane here

36
00:02:33,310 --> 00:02:35,400
And then for the size

37
00:02:35,420 --> 00:02:43,180
I can actually choose the values like 190 here and 75

38
00:02:44,120 --> 00:02:45,740
And for that

39
00:02:45,750 --> 00:02:48,560
I will choose 56

40
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:53,380
And now you see the basic geometry should fit to the original image

41
00:02:54,090 --> 00:02:56,100
Now I will bring this here in the middle

42
00:02:56,150 --> 00:02:58,680
and maybe that's a little bit up here

43
00:03:00,010 --> 00:03:01,090
And the base planner

44
00:03:01,090 --> 00:03:03,660
you can actually just delete for now

45
00:03:05,420 --> 00:03:07,960
So then you have this little body here

46
00:03:07,960 --> 00:03:11,820
So the corner is actually a little bit too rounded in my opinion

47
00:03:12,200 --> 00:03:16,820
so we will reduce it to something like 0．5

48
00:03:18,710 --> 00:03:20,280
So now if you zoom in

49
00:03:20,970 --> 00:03:21,970
you see just a little

50
00:03:23,870 --> 00:03:25,740
little rounded edge here

51
00:03:28,150 --> 00:03:37,590
And then we can rename it also here so it doesn't get confused later on

52
00:03:38,210 --> 00:03:41,240
And I will just call this buddy

53
00:03:42,970 --> 00:03:43,190
Okay

54
00:03:43,190 --> 00:03:45,590
now we have the basic shape of the body now

55
00:03:45,940 --> 00:03:53,820
and we can actually just start over with the lid here or the add the shape on top of the body

56
00:03:54,470 --> 00:03:56,160
And to do so

57
00:03:56,170 --> 00:03:58,350
I will rotate this camera on top

58
00:04:00,010 --> 00:04:03,600
And then I will actually place another cube on it here

59
00:04:04,380 --> 00:04:09,960
which also has kind of the same values here in size

60
00:04:09,970 --> 00:04:14,840
So for x 190 and for y

61
00:04:14,850 --> 00:04:19,080
I can maybe choose something like 65

62
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:20,950
Yeahthis could fit right now

63
00:04:21,790 --> 00:04:22,820
And for that

64
00:04:23,050 --> 00:04:26,200
I actually want this to be kind of thin the lid

65
00:04:26,450 --> 00:04:28,220
So maybe just one

66
00:04:29,410 --> 00:04:32,220
and then zoom in a little bit and try that

67
00:04:32,220 --> 00:04:35,660
It's kind of fits to the body

68
00:04:35,660 --> 00:04:39,780
so it doesn't have to be 100% precise

69
00:04:43,480 --> 00:04:46,460
Soand then also bring this down here

70
00:04:48,750 --> 00:04:49,830
It like that

71
00:04:50,200 --> 00:04:53,120
And now if you actually rotate the view

72
00:04:53,890 --> 00:04:56,840
you now see a little nice lit here on top

73
00:04:57,600 --> 00:04:59,950
And it also produces some shadows

74
00:05:00,950 --> 00:05:03,220
So if you look at the screenshot

75
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,360
the screenshot by itself

76
00:05:05,370 --> 00:05:09,150
you also see that there is a little dark shadow here

77
00:05:09,870 --> 00:05:11,650
but we will come to this later

78
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:14,020
But so for the basic geometry

79
00:05:14,330 --> 00:05:15,530
it should fit now

80
00:05:17,850 --> 00:05:27,660
And then we can actually move this whole thing a little bit more up here and also rename the cube here

81
00:05:29,010 --> 00:05:31,390
I will call it top element

82
00:05:34,540 --> 00:05:39,690
And then we can actually also group the whole thing up

83
00:05:39,810 --> 00:05:42,030
I will just select both of the elements

84
00:05:42,030 --> 00:05:44,210
Now hit command in G

85
00:05:44,210 --> 00:05:45,400
and now we have a group

86
00:05:46,120 --> 00:05:51,660
And I will also rename this group two flight controlling unit

87
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:53,740
Okay

88
00:05:53,940 --> 00:06:02,480
so now we can actually just start over with the material to get this kind of cinematic look right away to at the beginning

89
00:06:02,900 --> 00:06:04,430
And there are now different

90
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,180
yeahlike options

91
00:06:06,180 --> 00:06:09,610
how you can get the colors right here

92
00:06:10,290 --> 00:06:13,450
One option is to choose something like color picker

93
00:06:13,450 --> 00:06:14,130
So for example

94
00:06:14,140 --> 00:06:19,400
you can add a color picker to your chromic Google Chrome by an extension

95
00:06:20,200 --> 00:06:22,510
So I have here the color

96
00:06:22,510 --> 00:06:25,010
the color element

97
00:06:25,420 --> 00:06:26,480
and with this one

98
00:06:26,480 --> 00:06:31,390
you can actually just choose the colors here right from the reference image

99
00:06:31,910 --> 00:06:34,170
But this option we will not use now

100
00:06:34,170 --> 00:06:36,640
So I actually prepared the material layer

101
00:06:36,650 --> 00:06:38,270
which we are going to use

102
00:06:38,740 --> 00:06:45,690
And this just works work pretty well with the with the image here now

103
00:06:45,740 --> 00:06:52,480
And you get kind of like the same look because it's a lot of fine adjustment here

104
00:06:52,480 --> 00:06:57,560
So I will actually use some existing material layer here

105
00:06:57,890 --> 00:06:59,400
And for this

106
00:06:59,410 --> 00:07:04,270
we will actually just choose our body element here now

107
00:07:04,280 --> 00:07:13,020
and we will create a new material and we will give it a name here

108
00:07:13,030 --> 00:07:16,180
So green buddy

109
00:07:19,330 --> 00:07:22,150
And then I will make some changes to it

110
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:23,180
So for the color

111
00:07:23,180 --> 00:07:26,950
we will actually use this color here

112
00:07:27,410 --> 00:07:30,580
So it is check

113
00:07:31,130 --> 00:07:32,500
this is RGB code

114
00:07:32,500 --> 00:07:37,590
So you can simply copy this right away or in hex it is

115
00:07:38,360 --> 00:07:42,670
we show 1 4 2 3 2 7

116
00:07:44,680 --> 00:07:47,380
So this is the base color layer now

117
00:07:48,120 --> 00:07:50,100
And then on top of this layer

118
00:07:50,100 --> 00:07:52,760
we will actually create a Fresnel layer

119
00:07:53,860 --> 00:08:03,570
So actually just add a new material layer and then choose the Fresnel 1 and then bring this down to the lightning here

120
00:08:03,570 --> 00:08:12,000
So just that is that it's positioned in the middle here where between the color and lightning element and on the Fresno side

121
00:08:12,010 --> 00:08:15,450
we will actually use the color black here

122
00:08:17,290 --> 00:08:18,560
And for the bias

123
00:08:18,610 --> 00:08:22,240
choose the value 0．14

124
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:23,650
And for the scale

125
00:08:23,650 --> 00:08:24,680
intensityand factor

126
00:08:24,680 --> 00:08:26,420
you can leave it as it is now

127
00:08:28,010 --> 00:08:29,620
So this is it for the Fresnel layer

128
00:08:32,040 --> 00:08:34,570
And then for the lightning layer

129
00:08:36,910 --> 00:08:40,660
We will choose the type form here

130
00:08:40,780 --> 00:08:41,910
And for the color

131
00:08:41,910 --> 00:08:44,250
we will actually make some

132
00:08:45,030 --> 00:08:45,930
bring in some red

133
00:08:45,940 --> 00:08:50,110
So it actually has to do with those orange elements here

134
00:08:50,110 --> 00:08:58,960
So you get kind of like this reflection that the yellow elements produce now to the body

135
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:00,990
And for the shininess

136
00:09:00,990 --> 00:09:03,570
we can actually leave it here on five

137
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:07,810
So we have these three layers here

138
00:09:08,420 --> 00:09:11,200
and then we will create another layer

139
00:09:11,470 --> 00:09:15,470
And this one will be a Madd Capp layer

140
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:18,700
And for the medcap here

141
00:09:18,700 --> 00:09:21,360
we will choose something from the spline library

142
00:09:21,540 --> 00:09:24,140
So we can go with this one here

143
00:09:27,180 --> 00:09:27,950
And then actually

144
00:09:27,950 --> 00:09:30,790
we have to adjust the blending modes here

145
00:09:30,790 --> 00:09:32,020
So for mat cap

146
00:09:32,020 --> 00:09:34,960
we will actually use screen mode

147
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:36,920
And for lightning

148
00:09:36,930 --> 00:09:38,700
we will use the overlay mode

149
00:09:39,640 --> 00:09:40,800
And for Fresno

150
00:09:40,810 --> 00:09:43,700
we will also use the overlay mode

151
00:09:46,040 --> 00:09:51,000
And then we actually have to also reduce the resin and here a little bit

152
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,460
So maybe choose something like 40

153
00:09:53,720 --> 00:09:58,120
So now you see that it's getting a little bit brighter here

154
00:09:58,650 --> 00:10:03,580
And then we can maybe also introduce another color layer

155
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:06,070
And for this

156
00:10:06,150 --> 00:10:09,640
we will actually use again

157
00:10:09,640 --> 00:10:11,100
some orange here

158
00:10:12,610 --> 00:10:14,590
So this is the color again

159
00:10:15,190 --> 00:10:16,580
And in hex

160
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:17,760
it is Ff

161
00:10:19,220 --> 00:10:20,210
Let me check real quick

162
00:10:20,220 --> 00:10:24,390
FFA F3 6

163
00:10:24,500 --> 00:10:26,320
So you can simply copy it

164
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:28,230
And then for the opacity

165
00:10:28,230 --> 00:10:30,440
you will actually reduce it a lot

166
00:10:30,440 --> 00:10:32,310
so maybe like nine point

167
00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:37,770
So this will be our material here

168
00:10:37,790 --> 00:10:38,170
So

169
00:10:38,170 --> 00:10:38,630
you know

170
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:39,340
seeactually

171
00:10:39,340 --> 00:10:42,100
it doesn't really look like the original one

172
00:10:42,440 --> 00:10:55,100
but you guys have to imagine now that also we will introduce a light source and then you will actually see how the material changes based on the light

173
00:10:55,740 --> 00:10:57,010
And to do that

174
00:10:57,010 --> 00:10:58,970
we will create a new object

175
00:10:59,430 --> 00:11:03,940
And to get this kind of shiny cinematic look here

176
00:11:03,940 --> 00:11:07,850
now you maybe see that it's getting light it from the top

177
00:11:08,100 --> 00:11:13,180
So we will actually create a spotlight here

178
00:11:14,430 --> 00:11:23,560
And then we will actually move this one up here a little bit so you can actually change

179
00:11:25,910 --> 00:11:29,990
The view here a little bit to adapt it and actually one that it's

180
00:11:30,540 --> 00:11:32,000
yeahlighting

181
00:11:32,080 --> 00:11:42,370
lighting the body in a more like 45 degree angles or actually we give it a little twist here by 45 degrees

182
00:11:44,840 --> 00:11:45,010
And maybe

183
00:11:45,010 --> 00:11:47,190
yeahlike that

184
00:11:50,350 --> 00:11:51,490
And for the color

185
00:11:51,500 --> 00:11:55,620
I will actually choose some more blue lighting here

186
00:11:56,390 --> 00:12:00,640
So the color code is a 7 C 1 d

187
00:12:02,200 --> 00:12:03,720
And for the intensity

188
00:12:03,730 --> 00:12:07,280
I will choose something like maybe 7

189
00:12:09,590 --> 00:12:12,780
So a little bit brighter here

190
00:12:13,320 --> 00:12:22,000
For the distance I will actually reduce is a little bit maybe like 1300 and the angle

191
00:12:22,010 --> 00:12:24,010
So actually see what the angle does

192
00:12:24,200 --> 00:12:27,820
So it increases or decreases the spotlight angle

193
00:12:28,150 --> 00:12:29,100
And for this

194
00:12:29,240 --> 00:12:33,430
I will actually choose a value like a little bit over 50

195
00:12:35,110 --> 00:12:37,830
And then we can also give it some blur here

196
00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:38,820
For the edges

197
00:12:38,860 --> 00:12:42,520
I will choose a value of 0．5 here

198
00:12:43,140 --> 00:12:47,160
And the DK can be set to 0

199
00:12:48,220 --> 00:12:51,300
And the rest is maybe you can

200
00:12:51,450 --> 00:12:57,250
you can give it somewhere here and the rest should be alright

201
00:12:57,450 --> 00:13:00,490
Maybe you can adjust the pin number as you want

202
00:13:00,860 --> 00:13:04,190
I will choose a value of 0．6 here

203
00:13:06,080 --> 00:13:10,930
And now you see actually that we are almost getting there to the color

204
00:13:10,970 --> 00:13:12,280
But later on

205
00:13:12,830 --> 00:13:16,050
againwe will also create those orange elements

206
00:13:16,230 --> 00:13:22,160
The color will be changed a little bit over the process of creating this FCU

207
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:24,760
But now for now

208
00:13:24,760 --> 00:13:27,270
this actually looks quite good

209
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:32,190
Let me just rearrange this a little bit more

210
00:13:35,870 --> 00:13:40,990
So I will actually bring this a little bit more here

211
00:13:42,460 --> 00:13:47,550
So this center light is actually reflecting on the front here

212
00:13:48,930 --> 00:13:50,300
So maybe like this

213
00:13:51,260 --> 00:14:00,770
And also you may see or notice that the light is actually coming a little bit more from the right here on the reference image

214
00:14:00,770 --> 00:14:06,710
So I will actually also move the spotlight here a little bit to the right

215
00:14:09,430 --> 00:14:10,240
So later on

216
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:15,130
the shadows will also just reflect more to the right here

217
00:14:16,420 --> 00:14:17,810
And yeah

218
00:14:17,820 --> 00:14:20,030
this actually looks quite good

219
00:14:20,810 --> 00:14:29,760
Maybe I will bring this down so we actually see how the shadows are also changing while I'm moving the spotlight up and down

220
00:14:30,600 --> 00:14:32,420
And yeah

221
00:14:32,420 --> 00:14:35,840
I will maybe leave it like here

222
00:14:37,880 --> 00:14:42,380
Okayand now you see for the color

223
00:14:42,380 --> 00:14:46,440
it actually matches to the reference image quite good

224
00:14:46,450 --> 00:14:47,230
I would say

225
00:14:47,740 --> 00:14:48,890
And so far

226
00:14:49,490 --> 00:14:50,730
and yeah

227
00:14:50,740 --> 00:14:52,600
this is actually the first step

228
00:14:52,840 --> 00:14:56,860
So we're getting there

229
00:14:59,000 --> 00:14:59,300
Soso

230
00:14:59,300 --> 00:15:03,770
and then we can actually start over with the display here

231
00:15:03,770 --> 00:15:05,950
So if I move in a little bit

232
00:15:05,950 --> 00:15:10,560
so this one here where the text is displayed

233
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:11,870
the orange text

234
00:15:12,630 --> 00:15:14,340
and to do so

235
00:15:14,340 --> 00:15:19,610
we can maybe just add a little rectangle here

236
00:15:19,980 --> 00:15:27,410
So choose a rectangle to from the top two bar and then just simply paste it here on the Or

237
00:15:27,660 --> 00:15:29,760
place it here on the cube

238
00:15:30,860 --> 00:15:32,180
And for the size

239
00:15:32,190 --> 00:15:41,320
we will use something like 161 and in y direction or the y size

240
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:44,890
we will actually use P 14

241
00:15:44,990 --> 00:15:46,120
So maybe like this

242
00:15:48,270 --> 00:15:51,170
Soand then actually make sure that you align it right here

243
00:15:52,130 --> 00:15:53,860
It fits to the body here

244
00:15:53,910 --> 00:15:55,270
So maybe like this

245
00:15:56,380 --> 00:15:59,190
And from the top

246
00:15:59,200 --> 00:16:01,620
you can actually move this up a little bit

247
00:16:01,760 --> 00:16:02,170
I think

248
00:16:02,170 --> 00:16:06,050
Yeahso maybe like there

249
00:16:09,200 --> 00:16:09,680
Okay

250
00:16:11,800 --> 00:16:14,300
And now for the properties

251
00:16:15,160 --> 00:16:20,450
you can actually do the corners here or give the corners a value of three

252
00:16:20,450 --> 00:16:22,560
so it's more rounded on the edges

253
00:16:23,190 --> 00:16:25,330
And for extrusion here

254
00:16:25,500 --> 00:16:28,490
we can maybe go with two

255
00:16:28,910 --> 00:16:30,220
And for the bever

256
00:16:30,220 --> 00:16:37,980
we can actually choose a value of 64 and the bevel sides value of 10

257
00:16:39,030 --> 00:16:39,630
Okay

258
00:16:39,800 --> 00:16:42,130
now you have a basic ranked element here

259
00:16:42,300 --> 00:16:47,790
herewhich is smooth on the edges and also has a little border radius here

260
00:16:48,630 --> 00:16:51,830
And to actually get this look here

261
00:16:51,830 --> 00:16:56,130
maybe you see that the display is actually kind of

262
00:16:56,790 --> 00:17:04,610
yeahinsert it in the in the so there is a little gap here between the display and this border

263
00:17:05,500 --> 00:17:07,480
And to achieve this

264
00:17:07,500 --> 00:17:12,950
we can actually just duplicate this rectangle here

265
00:17:12,970 --> 00:17:18,760
So make sure this rectangle is selected here and then hit command and D

266
00:17:19,120 --> 00:17:21,470
so we have now the second element

267
00:17:21,470 --> 00:17:24,870
which is just displayed over the old element

268
00:17:25,360 --> 00:17:29,860
And here we will actually make some changes now

269
00:17:31,150 --> 00:17:32,790
So to get this border

270
00:17:32,790 --> 00:17:37,120
we will actually make this new element a little bit smaller here

271
00:17:37,120 --> 00:17:37,990
So for example

272
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:41,810
our x size is now 161

273
00:17:42,300 --> 00:17:47,950
And if we maybe take something like 159

274
00:17:48,140 --> 00:17:48,840
you know

275
00:17:48,850 --> 00:17:55,290
see that the new element is now kind of smaller than the old one

276
00:17:55,510 --> 00:17:58,930
So we actually will get this border here

277
00:17:59,470 --> 00:18:03,020
And this we can also do for the y component here

278
00:18:03,220 --> 00:18:05,710
So instead of using 14 here

279
00:18:05,710 --> 00:18:07,320
we will choose 12

280
00:18:08,790 --> 00:18:10,360
And it automatically

281
00:18:10,860 --> 00:18:13,430
it automatically fits here to the sensor

282
00:18:13,430 --> 00:18:15,080
So don't worry about that

283
00:18:15,390 --> 00:18:18,070
So now you have a gap of one here

284
00:18:18,080 --> 00:18:18,900
one here

285
00:18:18,910 --> 00:18:19,610
one here

286
00:18:19,620 --> 00:18:21,050
and one on the right

287
00:18:23,450 --> 00:18:31,050
And here we will actually reduce the bevel to 0 and the bevel sides to one

288
00:18:31,050 --> 00:18:33,070
maybe so

289
00:18:33,070 --> 00:18:34,000
and now again

290
00:18:34,010 --> 00:18:36,800
we will make use of the Boolean operators now

291
00:18:36,800 --> 00:18:38,520
which we already talked about

292
00:18:38,950 --> 00:18:45,500
So make sure that you select both of the elements now and then you on the top right corner

293
00:18:45,500 --> 00:18:47,520
you see the Boolean modifier tool

294
00:18:47,830 --> 00:18:50,650
And then use the first one here

295
00:18:52,220 --> 00:18:58,360
And now you actually see that it's subtracted one from the other

296
00:19:00,410 --> 00:19:02,480
And this looks actually quite good

297
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:09,760
Now maybe I will change the color to black here for the first year

298
00:19:10,050 --> 00:19:10,940
Soyou know

299
00:19:10,980 --> 00:19:13,530
you have this little border here

300
00:19:14,030 --> 00:19:15,030
But again

301
00:19:15,030 --> 00:19:17,130
we also want this

302
00:19:17,150 --> 00:19:21,470
this blade to be kind of black here and so on

303
00:19:21,470 --> 00:19:25,030
We will make a little change to the Boolean modifier

304
00:19:26,090 --> 00:19:30,400
So just select one of the rectangles here in the Boolean modifier

305
00:19:31,080 --> 00:19:33,550
And then I will actually drag it

306
00:19:35,840 --> 00:19:39,260
A little bit behind or front maybe

307
00:19:39,270 --> 00:19:40,100
let's see

308
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:45,040
And like that

309
00:19:47,710 --> 00:19:50,140
Maybe I'll show you guys see it a little bit better now

310
00:19:50,420 --> 00:19:51,840
So by moving the rectangle

311
00:19:51,850 --> 00:19:59,890
the Boolean modifier also it adapts to the change positioning here

312
00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:02,870
So I will actually drag it a little bit inside here

313
00:20:02,870 --> 00:20:05,970
make sure it doesn't drag it too far

314
00:20:05,970 --> 00:20:09,120
So the Boole modifier will just disappear like this

315
00:20:09,490 --> 00:20:13,830
So make sure it is still in the canvas here

316
00:20:17,250 --> 00:20:17,800
But maybe

317
00:20:17,800 --> 00:20:20,030
yeahlike that

318
00:20:21,910 --> 00:20:23,020
I know this was too far

319
00:20:31,640 --> 00:20:31,970
Yeah

320
00:20:31,980 --> 00:20:32,790
maybe like that it

321
00:20:35,970 --> 00:20:38,140
Was actually hard to see because of the blacks

322
00:20:38,310 --> 00:20:41,010
Or maybe I will show you in the white color

323
00:20:41,010 --> 00:20:44,650
So here you now see the edge created

324
00:20:46,010 --> 00:20:48,580
So the edge is still or the border is still there

325
00:20:48,580 --> 00:20:52,780
but we also have the surface here right behind the edge

326
00:20:52,970 --> 00:20:56,280
And this will actually be the display later on

327
00:20:56,290 --> 00:20:59,940
So I will actually change it back to black here

328
00:21:02,740 --> 00:21:05,930
And now if you look at the front now here

329
00:21:05,930 --> 00:21:09,860
you see that it looks already quite good

330
00:21:10,560 --> 00:21:16,680
And make sure you actually connect the display with the body here

331
00:21:18,790 --> 00:21:22,680
Change the view and then move it to the body here

332
00:21:24,700 --> 00:21:25,180
Okay

333
00:21:26,840 --> 00:21:31,660
and now we will actually also change the material here

334
00:21:31,670 --> 00:21:32,670
And for this 1

335
00:21:32,700 --> 00:21:36,580
I will actually just create a Mat Capp layer here

336
00:21:36,590 --> 00:21:37,870
And for the mat cap

337
00:21:37,880 --> 00:21:40,520
we can choose the second one here

338
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:43,800
And now it's getting there where we want

339
00:21:44,200 --> 00:21:50,740
So now you actually see a little like nice shininess around the border here

340
00:21:51,190 --> 00:21:53,560
And if you rotate a little bit

341
00:21:53,920 --> 00:21:56,740
you now see that you have this edge here

342
00:21:56,750 --> 00:21:57,480
So the border

343
00:21:58,450 --> 00:22:00,200
and right behind it

344
00:22:00,200 --> 00:22:03,460
you have like the display surface where we later on

345
00:22:03,740 --> 00:22:09,400
we write those numbers here and the text

346
00:22:09,520 --> 00:22:10,080
So again

347
00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:13,860
here's the border and this surface here

348
00:22:14,010 --> 00:22:15,370
it's a display

349
00:22:17,900 --> 00:22:24,720
But maybe I will actually make this board a little bit bigger now

350
00:22:24,730 --> 00:22:26,180
So to do so

351
00:22:26,750 --> 00:22:32,940
I will just increase the extrusion of both of them a little bit

352
00:22:32,950 --> 00:22:34,110
So now you know guys

353
00:22:34,110 --> 00:22:38,500
so you guys now see that it's a little bit bigger here

354
00:22:38,610 --> 00:22:39,220
the bottom

355
00:22:41,980 --> 00:22:42,480
And yeah

356
00:22:42,490 --> 00:22:45,220
this looks quite good for now

357
00:22:46,920 --> 00:22:48,280
Soand now again

358
00:22:48,290 --> 00:22:52,090
we will actually rename this one real quick

359
00:22:52,100 --> 00:23:06,660
So I will just rename the Boolean now to maybe like this and these two rectangles also to maybe a rectangle

360
00:23:10,500 --> 00:23:12,160
And 2

361
00:23:12,630 --> 00:23:13,380
I don't know

362
00:23:15,470 --> 00:23:17,730
Rectangle behind

363
00:23:19,900 --> 00:23:21,420
There's a miss betting here

364
00:23:21,880 --> 00:23:23,150
rectangle behind

365
00:23:24,820 --> 00:23:25,010
So

366
00:23:25,150 --> 00:23:25,750
you know

367
00:23:26,100 --> 00:23:26,920
actuallyagain

368
00:23:26,920 --> 00:23:29,760
have a clear description of your elements

369
00:23:31,310 --> 00:23:33,980
And maybe to organize this

370
00:23:34,010 --> 00:23:35,990
I will move this one up here

371
00:23:35,990 --> 00:23:37,710
So on the down side

372
00:23:37,710 --> 00:23:43,500
you have all your light sources and on top here you have all the elements

373
00:23:45,040 --> 00:23:49,420
So then we can actually start over with the content of the display

374
00:23:49,420 --> 00:23:51,910
So this little orange text here

375
00:23:51,920 --> 00:23:57,720
So we will actually just use the same text and symbols and numbers here

376
00:23:59,020 --> 00:24:01,060
And to get the this kind of effect

377
00:24:01,070 --> 00:24:02,490
So we will

378
00:24:02,740 --> 00:24:10,620
I will actually maybe move a little bit down here like that behind the our element or body

379
00:24:11,670 --> 00:24:28,300
And then we can actually just choose the text tool here from the top to bar and then place it here on the display and then resize it a little bit so it fits to our body shape here or display shape

380
00:24:29,680 --> 00:24:32,930
And now you can actually start writing here

381
00:24:33,170 --> 00:24:33,780
But again

382
00:24:33,780 --> 00:24:37,150
we want this content here

383
00:24:37,150 --> 00:24:40,640
So maybe I will start over with the top here

384
00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:44,410
so the Spd ma ch

385
00:24:45,080 --> 00:24:53,610
So just write sorry s PDM AC h

386
00:24:54,120 --> 00:24:57,480
and now you see the text is a little bit too big here

387
00:24:58,320 --> 00:25:02,330
And here you can actually then just change the properties of the text

388
00:25:02,370 --> 00:25:08,810
But now you guys actually may also see that this is more like a digital phone

389
00:25:08,810 --> 00:25:10,880
So we will actually also upload

390
00:25:11,570 --> 00:25:13,020
our own font here

391
00:25:13,320 --> 00:25:14,660
But yeah

392
00:25:14,660 --> 00:25:15,990
for the top one

393
00:25:15,990 --> 00:25:19,340
we can actually use an existing font here

394
00:25:19,670 --> 00:25:20,760
And for this one

395
00:25:20,760 --> 00:25:23,700
we can actually use a Re font

396
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:27,550
This is one which fits quite good

397
00:25:27,550 --> 00:25:31,480
So here you have a bunch of different font types here

398
00:25:31,800 --> 00:25:34,040
but yeah

399
00:25:34,050 --> 00:25:38,410
we will stick around with a remote one type in

400
00:25:41,770 --> 00:25:42,170
Remote

401
00:25:46,090 --> 00:25:52,720
Soand then also reduce the font size here to something like 3．2

402
00:25:52,820 --> 00:25:56,680
So a little bit tinier here

403
00:25:57,700 --> 00:26:00,700
but I actually want it to be bold

404
00:26:01,310 --> 00:26:05,690
So a little bit more thickness to the letters

405
00:26:08,520 --> 00:26:10,820
And yeah

406
00:26:10,820 --> 00:26:13,760
this actually looks quite good for now

407
00:26:15,310 --> 00:26:22,220
but we can actually make it a little bit more fitting to the to the display here

408
00:26:22,630 --> 00:26:24,460
So maybe reduce it a little bit

409
00:26:25,980 --> 00:26:31,620
And I will make it make it like this for now because we actually

410
00:26:31,620 --> 00:26:32,670
if you guys see it

411
00:26:32,670 --> 00:26:37,930
maybe the upper letters are a little bit smaller than the leather ones

412
00:26:38,040 --> 00:26:39,640
The letters down below he​‌​‌​​‌‌​​‌‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌​​‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌​​‌‌‌​​‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌​‌​‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌​‌‌​​​‌‌‌‌‌‌​​‌‌‌‌‌‌​​‌‌​‌​‌​​‌‌‌​‌‌​​‌‌​​​‌​​‌‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌‌​​‌‌‌​‌‌​​‌​​‌‌​​​‌​​‌‌​​‌‌​​‌‌​‌​‌​​‌‌​‌​‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌‌‌‌​​​‌‌‌​‌‌​​‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌​​‌‌​‌‌‌‌‌​‌​‌‌​​​‌‌​​‌‌​​‌‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌​‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌​​​‌‌‌​​‌​​‌‌‌​‌‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌‌​​‌‌‌​‌​‌‌‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌​​‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌​​​‌‌​‌‌‌​​‌‌​​​‌​​‌‌​​‌‌​​‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌​‌‌‌​​‌‌‌‌‌​​​‌‌​‌‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌​‌‌​​‌‌​‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌​‌​‌​​‌‌​‌‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌​‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌​‌‌​​​‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌​‌​‌​​‌‌​‌​‌‌‌​‌​​​‌​​‌‌​‌‌‌‌‌​‌​‌​‌​​‌‌​‌​‌​​‌‌​‌​‌‌‌​‌‌​​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌‌​​‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌​​‌‌‌​​‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌​‌‌‌​​‌‌‌​​‌‌‌​‌​‌‌‌‌‌​‌​‌‌​​​‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌​​‌​​‌‌‌​‌‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌​‌‌​​‌‌​​‌‌​​‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌​‌​‌‌‌​‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌​‌‌‌​​‌‌​​​‌​​‌‌‌​​‌​​‌‌​‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌​‌‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌​​​‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌​​‌​​‌‌​‌​‌‌‌​‌​‌‌‌​​‌‌​‌‌​​​‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌​‌‌‌​​‌‌‌‌‌​​​‌‌​‌​‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌‌​​‌‌‌​‌​‌‌‌‌‌​‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌‌​​‌‌‌‌‌‌​​‌‌​‌‌‌​​‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌‌​​‌​​‌‌​​‌‌​​‌‌‌​​‌​​‌‌‌​​‌​​‌‌​‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌re

413
00:26:39,840 --> 00:26:40,490
the 8

414
00:26:40,680 --> 00:26:45,100
8．8much bigger than the upper part here

415
00:26:45,260 --> 00:26:47,780
So we will leave a little blank space here

416
00:26:47,780 --> 00:26:50,610
So we can later on insert the eights

417
00:26:51,140 --> 00:26:52,200
the eights here

418
00:26:53,630 --> 00:26:54,560
But for now

419
00:26:54,560 --> 00:26:56,770
we will actually go to the color here

420
00:26:56,770 --> 00:26:59,950
So make it orange

421
00:27:00,180 --> 00:27:01,380
And to do so

422
00:27:01,440 --> 00:27:04,600
we will actually introduce another material here

423
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:05,450
So again

424
00:27:05,450 --> 00:27:06,310
on the right side

425
00:27:06,310 --> 00:27:08,980
click on the on the four dots here

426
00:27:09,190 --> 00:27:16,060
and then we will introduce another material and we call it orange parts

427
00:27:18,560 --> 00:27:20,300
And this is a simple

428
00:27:20,310 --> 00:27:23,960
basic material where we just actually change the color here

429
00:27:25,140 --> 00:27:27,750
So the color will be this one

430
00:27:28,190 --> 00:27:30,270
So this is the RGB code

431
00:27:30,700 --> 00:27:31,830
And in hex

432
00:27:31,840 --> 00:27:39,950
it's let me check CC 6 a 1 or 0 1

433
00:27:41,050 --> 00:27:46,210
And the light thing we can actually just hide for now

434
00:27:46,460 --> 00:27:54,490
Soand now you may notice that this orange color doesn't really fits to the So the reference screenshot for now

435
00:27:54,740 --> 00:27:55,610
But this is

436
00:27:56,100 --> 00:28:01,830
yeahthis is totally normal because we will actually later introduce Bloom filter here

437
00:28:01,830 --> 00:28:04,460
So we will get to the right color here

438
00:28:04,630 --> 00:28:07,200
I will maybe just show you what it does

439
00:28:07,210 --> 00:28:07,490
the bloom

440
00:28:07,490 --> 00:28:08,740
the bloom effect

441
00:28:09,240 --> 00:28:11,570
So to apply effect just again

442
00:28:11,570 --> 00:28:14,000
as we have shown before

443
00:28:14,030 --> 00:28:16,850
just click on an empty space here

444
00:28:16,850 --> 00:28:23,430
And then you have on the right side the opportunity to actually activate the Effects tab

445
00:28:23,940 --> 00:28:27,750
And here you will have the Bloom property

446
00:28:28,280 --> 00:28:30,200
And to show the Bloom effect

447
00:28:30,200 --> 00:28:32,930
just simply click on the eye icon

448
00:28:33,500 --> 00:28:38,410
And then we can actually also do some changes here

449
00:28:38,660 --> 00:28:39,770
So for the size

450
00:28:39,770 --> 00:28:42,720
we will actually use very small

451
00:28:42,940 --> 00:28:44,530
And for the intensity

452
00:28:44,530 --> 00:28:48,370
we will maybe use something like 2．45

453
00:28:49,020 --> 00:28:49,780
The blur scale

454
00:28:49,780 --> 00:28:51,960
you can leave it as it is

455
00:28:52,040 --> 00:28:57,520
and the threshold will be reduced a little bit to 0．22

456
00:28:58,380 --> 00:28:59,980
And for the moving defect

457
00:29:00,130 --> 00:29:03,940
we will use 0．44

458
00:29:05,240 --> 00:29:07,390
And now you may see that also bloom

459
00:29:07,710 --> 00:29:12,250
The bloom effect is also getting applied to the reference image

460
00:29:12,360 --> 00:29:17,040
So it's now quite hard actually to compare those colors

461
00:29:17,280 --> 00:29:17,820
But actually

462
00:29:17,820 --> 00:29:21,130
if you maybe go to the YouTube video again

463
00:29:21,470 --> 00:29:29,550
you now maybe see that the orange actually feels quite good to the reference image

464
00:29:30,380 --> 00:29:30,970
But yeah

465
00:29:30,970 --> 00:29:34,490
thisthis is also something we have to keep in mind again

466
00:29:34,520 --> 00:29:35,520
to actually

467
00:29:39,930 --> 00:29:46,320
Get this model really precise to how it looks like in the video here

468
00:29:47,800 --> 00:29:48,440
But for now

469
00:29:48,440 --> 00:29:49,800
we can actually just

470
00:29:50,050 --> 00:29:52,810
yeahdeactivate the bloom effect again

471
00:29:53,490 --> 00:30:02,840
But we have to keep in mind that this orange actually looks like the reference image just with the bloom effect activated

472
00:30:04,480 --> 00:30:06,870
Soso

473
00:30:06,870 --> 00:30:11,400
and then we can actually continue with the digital numbers here

474
00:30:11,400 --> 00:30:18,170
So you maybe know that this phone type isn't really matching with with this one here

475
00:30:18,170 --> 00:30:22,690
So those numbers are in the like digital font type

476
00:30:23,010 --> 00:30:23,900
So for example

477
00:30:24,110 --> 00:30:29,170
if I will maybe place some numbers here

478
00:30:29,690 --> 00:30:33,510
you see that it doesn't really look like the digital numbers here

479
00:30:34,140 --> 00:30:41,130
And what we will do now is actually we will upload a font here

480
00:30:41,130 --> 00:30:42,240
So a custom font

481
00:30:42,250 --> 00:30:47,330
which we can maybe download from the internet or anything else anywhere else

482
00:30:47,910 --> 00:30:55,180
And the font we will choose will be actually called DS DIY font

483
00:30:57,100 --> 00:31:01,070
And you can simply download this one from the website here

484
00:31:01,320 --> 00:31:02,670
the daon procom

485
00:31:03,250 --> 00:31:04,110
and you know

486
00:31:04,120 --> 00:31:06,490
you see actually that it is looks

487
00:31:06,500 --> 00:31:07,600
it looks like

488
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:10,240
yeahlike a digital font here

489
00:31:10,690 --> 00:31:13,110
And then we can actually just download it

490
00:31:15,410 --> 00:31:24,520
And in spine now we have actually the opportunity to upload our custom font here

491
00:31:25,260 --> 00:31:25,910
But for now

492
00:31:25,920 --> 00:31:31,600
we'll actually maybe just duplicate this text here real quick

493
00:31:32,340 --> 00:31:33,230
move it here

494
00:31:34,830 --> 00:31:36,680
And then again

495
00:31:36,700 --> 00:31:38,780
we will upload our font here

496
00:31:39,790 --> 00:31:41,020
We actually have to extract it

497
00:31:41,030 --> 00:31:42,310
extract it real quick

498
00:31:43,320 --> 00:31:51,270
So let me just unzip it in my downloads folder here and now again

499
00:31:53,440 --> 00:31:55,270
Now just a unzip it

500
00:31:55,340 --> 00:31:57,740
and then you have the DS digital font

501
00:31:58,340 --> 00:31:59,300
And from here

502
00:31:59,300 --> 00:32:06,150
I will use TS minus e dot Ttf and then upload it

503
00:32:07,280 --> 00:32:10,580
And now you have your own custom font right now in spline

504
00:32:11,350 --> 00:32:12,450
And now if I

505
00:32:13,280 --> 00:32:15,140
we will insert some numbers here

506
00:32:15,140 --> 00:32:20,210
you actually see that it looks more like our reference image

507
00:32:20,440 --> 00:32:21,530
So for the content

508
00:32:21,620 --> 00:32:27,590
I will actually place the 3 eights here with some following dots

509
00:32:29,810 --> 00:32:34,040
And then we also have a little big dot here

510
00:32:34,440 --> 00:32:44,640
So we can actually maybe it also just copy it from the internet and maybe where you find it here

511
00:32:46,940 --> 00:32:49,540
We can actually just copy this point

512
00:32:51,630 --> 00:32:56,800
And then place it here in the text field

513
00:32:59,130 --> 00:33:00,000
And now actually

514
00:33:00,480 --> 00:33:02,650
we need to adapt the size here

515
00:33:02,650 --> 00:33:03,730
So again

516
00:33:03,990 --> 00:33:06,740
this font here is a little bit bigger than this one

517
00:33:07,690 --> 00:33:11,910
but I will actually just adapt the size here a little bit

518
00:33:15,100 --> 00:33:16,620
And then move it down below

519
00:33:17,780 --> 00:33:19,180
And here for the font size

520
00:33:19,180 --> 00:33:24,810
we can actually maybe choose something like 12

521
00:33:24,820 --> 00:33:25,800
could be a little bit big

522
00:33:26,460 --> 00:33:29,790
but maybe something last year

523
00:33:30,420 --> 00:33:32,430
maybe we will go with 8

524
00:33:33,660 --> 00:33:36,200
And then we can actually move it

525
00:33:38,210 --> 00:33:40,410
Hereso it fits to the content

526
00:33:43,210 --> 00:33:43,900
And maybe like that

527
00:33:47,700 --> 00:33:51,840
And what maybe also notice will actually from the top text

528
00:33:51,850 --> 00:33:52,990
I will actually maybe

529
00:33:55,110 --> 00:33:56,880
And that the heat here also

530
00:33:57,010 --> 00:33:59,450
So the bottom one is still clickable

531
00:34:00,780 --> 00:34:05,770
And the front here on top is actually much more stuck together

532
00:34:05,770 --> 00:34:06,480
So the line

533
00:34:07,240 --> 00:34:11,610
the letters spacing is actually quite new

534
00:34:11,610 --> 00:34:14,440
So the letters are new to each oth​‌​‌​​‌‌​​‌‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌​​‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌​​‌‌‌​​‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌​‌​‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌​‌‌​​​‌‌‌‌‌‌​​‌‌‌‌‌‌​​‌‌​‌​‌​​‌‌‌​‌‌​​‌‌​​​‌​​‌‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌‌​​‌‌‌​‌‌​​‌​​‌‌​​​‌​​‌‌​​‌‌​​‌‌​‌​‌​​‌‌​‌​‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌‌‌‌​​​‌‌‌​‌‌​​‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌​​‌‌​‌‌‌‌‌​‌​‌‌​​​‌‌​​‌‌​​‌‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌​‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌​​​‌‌‌​​‌​​‌‌‌​‌‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌‌​​‌‌‌​‌​‌‌‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌​​‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌​​​‌‌​‌‌‌​​‌‌​​​‌​​‌‌​​‌‌​​‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌​‌‌‌​​‌‌‌‌‌​​​‌‌​‌‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌​‌‌​​‌‌​‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌​‌​‌​​‌‌​‌‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌​‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌​‌‌​​​‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌​‌​‌​​‌‌​‌​‌‌‌​‌​​​‌​​‌‌​‌‌‌‌‌​‌​‌​‌​​‌‌​‌​‌​​‌‌​‌​‌‌‌​‌‌​​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌‌​​‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌​​‌‌‌​​‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌​‌‌‌​​‌‌‌​​‌‌‌​‌​‌‌‌‌‌​‌​‌‌​​​‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌​​‌​​‌‌‌​‌‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌​‌‌​​‌‌​​‌‌​​‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌​‌​‌‌‌​‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌​‌‌‌​​‌‌​​​‌​​‌‌‌​​‌​​‌‌​‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌​‌‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌​​​‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌​​‌​​‌‌​‌​‌‌‌​‌​‌‌‌​​‌‌​‌‌​​​‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌​‌‌‌​​‌‌‌‌‌​​​‌‌​‌​‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌‌​​‌‌‌​‌​‌‌‌‌‌​‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌‌​​‌‌‌‌‌‌​​‌‌​‌‌‌​​‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌‌​​‌​​‌‌​​‌‌​​‌‌‌​​‌​​‌‌‌​​‌​​‌‌​‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌er

535
00:34:14,810 --> 00:34:26,090
So we will actually make this also a little bit tinier and like 0 -0．05

536
00:34:26,120 --> 00:34:27,630
And now we actually see it

537
00:34:27,880 --> 00:34:32,100
The head of the spacing is actually reduced a little bit

538
00:34:34,390 --> 00:34:35,670
And for the alignment

539
00:34:37,760 --> 00:34:39,080
We will maybe place it here somewhere

540
00:34:41,580 --> 00:34:42,720
And now again

541
00:34:42,780 --> 00:34:45,770
if you maybe reactivate the Bloom Filter again

542
00:34:46,270 --> 00:34:50,280
we actually now see that it's getting more bright here

543
00:34:50,280 --> 00:34:53,520
And so it actually fits to this kind of style here

544
00:34:55,290 --> 00:34:55,700
Okay

545
00:34:55,700 --> 00:34:58,670
and this is it for the first numbers here

546
00:35:00,010 --> 00:35:08,740
And maybe we can actually also decrease the letter spacing for the bottom one here

547
00:35:08,740 --> 00:35:10,150
So maybe here again

548
00:35:10,940 --> 00:35:14,600
u 0．05 here

549
00:35:14,880 --> 00:35:19,370
Yeahso this looks more like the reference image

550
00:35:19,380 --> 00:35:23,360
And now you actually see that the alignment actually from the edge and the dot

551
00:35:23,930 --> 00:35:28,600
it's actually more like in the reference image

552
00:35:29,470 --> 00:35:31,440
Yeahthis looks actually really good

553
00:35:32,210 --> 00:35:36,740
And now we can actually just continue with all the values here

554
00:35:36,760 --> 00:35:39,330
and this is what I'm going to do now

555
00:35:41,570 --> 00:35:41,590
Oh

556
00:35:41,600 --> 00:35:42,060
but first

557
00:35:42,320 --> 00:35:44,570
we can actually maybe look at the alignment here

558
00:35:44,570 --> 00:35:48,660
So this is also the thing you have to keep in mind

559
00:35:50,100 --> 00:35:54,070
I will actually rename the text elements real quick

560
00:35:54,290 --> 00:35:55,860
So this is the upper text

561
00:35:58,670 --> 00:35:59,490
And this is

562
00:36:03,050 --> 00:36:04,320
There will be text

563
00:36:07,600 --> 00:36:10,420
And maybe I will actually group this one

564
00:36:11,330 --> 00:36:11,900
So again

565
00:36:11,900 --> 00:36:13,280
select both ones

566
00:36:13,690 --> 00:36:15,030
hit command and G

567
00:36:15,040 --> 00:36:17,520
and group both of the elements

568
00:36:18,200 --> 00:36:24,830
And I will rename this group also to display text

569
00:36:26,530 --> 00:36:32,570
And then you can actually just move the goop to the display here

570
00:36:42,030 --> 00:36:45,000
You can actually move it

571
00:36:47,500 --> 00:36:50,250
Just like it doesn't

572
00:36:52,520 --> 00:36:53,650
Hide in the background

573
00:36:54,220 --> 00:36:55,550
So maybe like this

574
00:36:57,310 --> 00:37:03,760
Okayand now we can actually just continue with the other text elements here

575
00:37:04,360 --> 00:37:06,620
So just select the group here

576
00:37:07,050 --> 00:37:08,320
hit command and D

577
00:37:08,460 --> 00:37:10,470
so duplicate the text layers

578
00:37:10,720 --> 00:37:16,080
and then we can actually continue with the second text here

579
00:37:16,500 --> 00:37:17,220
And for here

580
00:37:17,220 --> 00:37:20,880
we actually just have to change the upper text

581
00:37:25,240 --> 00:37:25,610
Okay

582
00:37:25,610 --> 00:37:26,760
I actually

583
00:37:27,330 --> 00:37:30,840
I actually fucked up because I actually just

584
00:37:34,100 --> 00:37:34,700
Name the

585
00:37:36,900 --> 00:37:38,090
Name the elements wrong

586
00:37:38,090 --> 00:37:39,200
So this is actually the

587
00:37:41,370 --> 00:37:42,570
Upload text

588
00:37:42,780 --> 00:37:45,070
So I will just call the text up now

589
00:37:46,550 --> 00:37:49,390
And this one is in text down

590
00:37:51,210 --> 00:37:52,710
renamefixed down

591
00:37:53,270 --> 00:37:54,180
sorry for that

592
00:37:55,780 --> 00:37:58,200
And now we can continue again

593
00:37:58,220 --> 00:38:02,640
So duplicate the text layer and then move it here on the right side

594
00:38:04,330 --> 00:38:10,990
Okayand then we can actually edit the upper text here

595
00:38:10,990 --> 00:38:18,860
so to Hdg T RKL T

596
00:38:22,230 --> 00:38:22,260
Okay

597
00:38:22,260 --> 00:38:23,500
this is fine now

598
00:38:26,030 --> 00:38:30,760
Then we have another text here on the right side

599
00:38:32,930 --> 00:38:33,550
So this

600
00:38:33,590 --> 00:38:34,640
againwe can

601
00:38:37,740 --> 00:38:43,540
Or maybe I will rename this one real quick to display text Hdg

602
00:38:46,510 --> 00:38:49,290
And this one to Spds

603
00:38:49,300 --> 00:38:55,140
So we know the difference from each text in the in the left two bar here

604
00:38:56,240 --> 00:38:58,820
And then we will create now this little one

605
00:38:59,620 --> 00:39:01,830
So you can duplicate this layer

606
00:39:03,770 --> 00:39:05,570
move it to the right side

607
00:39:07,430 --> 00:39:16,160
And actually here I can delete the bigger part that we just have the little text here

608
00:39:16,510 --> 00:39:20,930
And here I will actually use

609
00:39:23,060 --> 00:39:25,460
Htg Grk

610
00:39:27,140 --> 00:39:30,140
And then you see actually it's aligned to the middle here

611
00:39:30,360 --> 00:39:36,310
So choose the horizontal alignment here and place and choose middle he​‌​‌​​‌‌​​‌‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌​​‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌​​‌‌‌​​‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌​‌​‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌​‌‌​​​‌‌‌‌‌‌​​‌‌‌‌‌‌​​‌‌​‌​‌​​‌‌‌​‌‌​​‌‌​​​‌​​‌‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌‌​​‌‌‌​‌‌​​‌​​‌‌​​​‌​​‌‌​​‌‌​​‌‌​‌​‌​​‌‌​‌​‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌‌‌‌​​​‌‌‌​‌‌​​‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌​​‌‌​‌‌‌‌‌​‌​‌‌​​​‌‌​​‌‌​​‌‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌​‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌​​​‌‌‌​​‌​​‌‌‌​‌‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌‌​​‌‌‌​‌​‌‌‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌​​‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌​​​‌‌​‌‌‌​​‌‌​​​‌​​‌‌​​‌‌​​‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌​‌‌‌​​‌‌‌‌‌​​​‌‌​‌‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌​‌‌​​‌‌​‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌​‌​‌​​‌‌​‌‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌​‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌​‌‌​​​‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌​‌​‌​​‌‌​‌​‌‌‌​‌​​​‌​​‌‌​‌‌‌‌‌​‌​‌​‌​​‌‌​‌​‌​​‌‌​‌​‌‌‌​‌‌​​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌‌​​‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌​​‌‌‌​​‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌​‌‌‌​​‌‌‌​​‌‌‌​‌​‌‌‌‌‌​‌​‌‌​​​‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌​​‌​​‌‌‌​‌‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌​‌‌​​‌‌​​‌‌​​‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌​‌​‌‌‌​‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌​‌‌‌​​‌‌​​​‌​​‌‌‌​​‌​​‌‌​‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌​‌‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌​​​‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌​​‌​​‌‌​‌​‌‌‌​‌​‌‌‌​​‌‌​‌‌​​​‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌​‌‌‌​​‌‌‌‌‌​​​‌‌​‌​‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌‌​​‌‌‌​‌​‌‌‌‌‌​‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌‌​​‌‌‌‌‌‌​​‌‌​‌‌‌​​‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌‌​​‌​​‌‌​​‌‌​​‌‌‌​​‌​​‌‌‌​​‌​​‌‌​‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌re

612
00:39:37,290 --> 00:39:42,220
And then also reduce the canvas size here

613
00:39:44,460 --> 00:39:49,930
And then you can actually move the group down here to the bottom

614
00:39:55,660 --> 00:39:56,170
So maybe

615
00:39:56,170 --> 00:39:56,730
I don't know

616
00:39:56,730 --> 00:39:58,350
it's getting quite hard here

617
00:39:58,410 --> 00:40:03,240
but maybe like position it like here

618
00:40:05,760 --> 00:40:06,170
Okay

619
00:40:08,260 --> 00:40:11,960
And then rename it again

620
00:40:14,390 --> 00:40:20,220
So this one is the Hdg TRC little

621
00:40:23,680 --> 00:40:27,280
And now we have this text also here

622
00:40:27,280 --> 00:40:30,870
So we can just duplicate this one and move it to the right

623
00:40:31,680 --> 00:40:32,490
So again

624
00:40:32,490 --> 00:40:34,900
hit command in D and duplicate the layer

625
00:40:35,920 --> 00:40:37,590
move it to the right here

626
00:40:39,150 --> 00:40:42,770
and then change the text again

627
00:40:43,560 --> 00:40:51,690
So here we would like to use the V and S followed by FPA

628
00:40:53,530 --> 00:40:53,590
okay

629
00:40:56,900 --> 00:40:57,660
So

630
00:41:00,820 --> 00:41:03,000
We actually have a lot of space here left

631
00:41:03,010 --> 00:41:06,720
You will see in the end if it fits

632
00:41:07,250 --> 00:41:07,890
For now

633
00:41:07,900 --> 00:41:10,710
we will continue with this part here

634
00:41:12,130 --> 00:41:13,250
And for the last part

635
00:41:13,260 --> 00:41:19,000
now we can actually just duplicate one of the bigger ones here

636
00:41:19,050 --> 00:41:22,020
AgainI will actually move this up now

637
00:41:25,070 --> 00:41:25,470
You guys

638
00:41:26,630 --> 00:41:29,540
I have a better listing here

639
00:41:29,840 --> 00:41:31,120
And then move it to the right

640
00:41:33,800 --> 00:41:37,380
I will rename it real quick to display text

641
00:41:38,190 --> 00:41:43,480
what is displayed or maybe just right side

642
00:41:45,820 --> 00:41:46,410
Okay

643
00:41:48,120 --> 00:41:52,240
and here we now have a lot of eights in the bottom

644
00:41:54,800 --> 00:41:56,170
So we have 1

645
00:41:56,180 --> 00:41:57,220
23

646
00:41:57,230 --> 00:41:58,720
4five eights

647
00:42:00,200 --> 00:42:02,090
followed by the big point

648
00:42:04,110 --> 00:42:06,820
I will actually just copy it real quick again

649
00:42:09,350 --> 00:42:09,810
Here

650
00:42:12,700 --> 00:42:15,890
And then insert it here again

651
00:42:17,230 --> 00:42:18,260
Then we have a little

652
00:42:18,260 --> 00:42:19,380
I don't know what it is

653
00:42:19,390 --> 00:42:21,820
but we can actually just leave it out here

654
00:42:21,820 --> 00:42:24,220
So maybe just a blank space here

655
00:42:25,030 --> 00:42:29,760
And then we have some more eights

656
00:42:33,230 --> 00:42:37,700
And we actually have to exceed the width here

657
00:42:37,700 --> 00:42:38,880
so it fits

658
00:42:40,350 --> 00:42:41,110
So like that

659
00:42:44,090 --> 00:42:47,620
Yeah8．8 and then 2 eights again

660
00:42:48,900 --> 00:42:51,480
And then for the upper text

661
00:42:52,700 --> 00:42:55,050
we have a Lt

662
00:42:56,800 --> 00:42:59,590
then followed by character

663
00:42:59,590 --> 00:43:02,020
we can actually not display

664
00:43:02,020 --> 00:43:06,800
You can maybe just put some rectangles here if you want to

665
00:43:06,800 --> 00:43:10,120
but I will actually just skip this one for now

666
00:43:11,980 --> 00:43:19,250
And then we have the level L VL slash c h

667
00:43:19,950 --> 00:43:22,390
and then maybe some blank spaces again

668
00:43:22,400 --> 00:43:28,430
And then the Oh so exceeded the mid here

669
00:43:28,430 --> 00:43:30,640
So just exceed the width here

670
00:43:31,480 --> 00:43:36,300
And then we have V slash S and FPA

671
00:43:38,320 --> 00:43:46,940
And this one we actually want to align to the right side here and then move it like here

672
00:43:47,870 --> 00:43:54,810
And now you see the A is actually in alignment with the third 8 here

673
00:43:54,810 --> 00:43:58,580
So it kind of works now here

674
00:43:59,760 --> 00:44:05,370
And I can actually make just maybe some more space in here

675
00:44:05,580 --> 00:44:06,070
So like that

676
00:44:07,720 --> 00:44:10,470
Yeahthis should do the work some

677
00:44:10,820 --> 00:44:13,700
And now we can actually make some alignment

678
00:44:15,130 --> 00:44:18,800
The right part is actually more on the right side

679
00:44:21,090 --> 00:44:24,630
So I will actually move this thing here

680
00:44:27,090 --> 00:44:30,420
And the second one right here

681
00:44:34,780 --> 00:44:35,960
This one there

682
00:44:41,180 --> 00:44:42,140
So maybe like that

683
00:44:43,430 --> 00:44:44,570
maybe check real quick

684
00:44:47,060 --> 00:44:49,030
Yeahnot not 100%

685
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:58,030
Those have to be stuck together more

686
00:45:04,070 --> 00:45:06,690
So this is just some fine adjustments now

687
00:45:15,940 --> 00:45:18,130
So I will leave it as it is now for now

688
00:45:18,930 --> 00:45:24,030
But I think it actually looks kind of the same as a reference image

689
00:45:24,500 --> 00:45:25,490
And now again

690
00:45:26,500 --> 00:45:28,560
if you activate the bloom effect now

691
00:45:31,850 --> 00:45:32,990
And zoom in a little bit

692
00:45:34,550 --> 00:45:37,530
So this is actually from the video now

693
00:45:38,160 --> 00:45:41,350
And this actually looks quite a similar now

694
00:45:42,120 --> 00:45:43,160
Sobut we will like

695
00:45:43,220 --> 00:45:45,140
againjust deactivate it for now

696
00:45:45,140 --> 00:45:46,010
The bloom effect

697
00:45:48,340 --> 00:45:51,990
And then we just created the display for now

698
00:45:52,060 --> 00:45:56,010
So another part of the SCU is now finished

699
00:45:56,300 --> 00:46:00,020
And then we will continue with all the buttons here

700
00:46:00,030 --> 00:46:02,560
the sliders and so on now
