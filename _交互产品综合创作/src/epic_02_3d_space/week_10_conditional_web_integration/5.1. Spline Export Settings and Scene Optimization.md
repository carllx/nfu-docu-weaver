1
00:00:00,010 --> 00:00:02,640
So we talked a lot about creating shapes

2
00:00:02,650 --> 00:00:04,220
customizing materials

3
00:00:04,220 --> 00:00:06,510
and also animating our projects

4
00:00:06,520 --> 00:00:12,080
But we also have to export them into some other applications and show them to the world

5
00:00:12,270 --> 00:00:15,260
And this is what we are going to do now in this lecture

6
00:00:15,330 --> 00:00:16,750
so let's get started

7
00:00:17,050 --> 00:00:18,090
So for this lecture

8
00:00:18,090 --> 00:00:22,020
we will actually use project from the states and events course here

9
00:00:22,020 --> 00:00:24,180
So if you don't have the file by now

10
00:00:24,180 --> 00:00:29,450
you can also just check out my spline community profile here and get it from there

11
00:00:29,480 --> 00:00:33,760
Or you can also just download it from th​‌​‌​​‌‌​​‌‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌​​‌‌​‌‌​​​‌‌​​‌‌​​‌‌​‌​‌​​‌‌‌​‌‌​​‌‌​‌​‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌​‌‌​​​‌‌‌‌‌‌​​‌‌‌​​‌‌‌​‌​‌​‌​​‌‌‌​‌‌​​‌‌​​​‌​​‌‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌‌​​‌​​‌‌‌​​‌​​‌‌​​​‌​​‌‌‌​​‌​​‌‌​‌​‌​​‌‌​‌​‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌‌‌‌​​​‌‌‌​‌‌​​‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌​​‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌​‌‌​​​‌‌​​‌‌​​‌‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌​‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌​​​‌‌‌​​‌​​‌‌​‌‌​​​‌‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌​‌​‌​​‌‌‌‌‌​​​‌‌‌‌‌‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌‌​​‌‌‌​‌​‌‌‌​​‌‌​‌‌​​​‌‌‌​​‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌​​​‌‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌​​​‌​​‌‌​​‌‌​​‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌​‌‌‌​​‌‌‌‌‌​​​‌‌​‌‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌​‌‌​​‌‌​‌​‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌​​‌‌​‌​‌​​‌‌​‌‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌​‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌​‌‌​​​‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌​‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌‌​​‌‌​‌‌‌‌‌​‌​‌​‌​​‌‌​‌​‌​​‌‌​‌​‌‌‌​‌‌​​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌‌​​‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌​​‌‌‌​​‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌​‌‌‌​​‌‌‌​​‌‌‌​‌​‌‌‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌​​‌​​‌‌​‌​‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌​‌‌​​‌‌​​‌‌​​‌‌​‌​‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌​‌​‌‌‌​‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌​​‌‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌‌​​‌​​‌‌‌​‌‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌​‌‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌​​​‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌​​‌​​‌‌​‌​‌‌‌​‌​‌‌‌​​‌‌​‌‌​​​‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌​‌‌‌​​‌‌‌‌‌​​​‌‌​‌​‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌‌​​‌‌‌​‌​‌‌‌‌‌​‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌‌​​‌‌‌‌‌‌​​‌‌​‌‌‌​​‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌‌​​‌​​‌‌​​‌‌​​‌‌‌​​‌​​‌‌‌​​‌​​‌‌​‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌e description down below here

12
00:00:34,150 --> 00:00:34,690
So

13
00:00:34,690 --> 00:00:38,070
and we start just with the most common use case here

14
00:00:38,080 --> 00:00:40,410
and this is exporting for web

15
00:00:40,420 --> 00:00:44,180
So just go to your top-tube here and click on export

16
00:00:44,600 --> 00:00:47,900
And now you have three different options to choose from

17
00:00:47,900 --> 00:00:49,800
So you have a public Url

18
00:00:49,810 --> 00:00:52,620
you have a viewer or code export here

19
00:00:52,780 --> 00:00:55,860
and we will just start with the public Url now

20
00:00:55,970 --> 00:00:58,980
And on the right side now you see a bunch of options

21
00:00:58,980 --> 00:01:03,980
Now I will guide you through that and show what the different settings do

22
00:01:04,070 --> 00:01:07,310
And maybe we'll just start with the play settings here

23
00:01:07,310 --> 00:01:09,060
So click on play settings

24
00:01:09,070 --> 00:01:12,490
and then you see a lot of options here that you can change

25
00:01:12,530 --> 00:01:15,090
So the first one here is play settings here

26
00:01:15,090 --> 00:01:15,790
So again

27
00:01:15,790 --> 00:01:17,230
if you have multiple scenes

28
00:01:17,230 --> 00:01:17,970
for instance

29
00:01:17,980 --> 00:01:20,040
or also multiple cameras here

30
00:01:20,110 --> 00:01:24,200
you can choose the scene you want here and also the camera you want

31
00:01:24,280 --> 00:01:25,090
And next up

32
00:01:25,090 --> 00:01:26,110
we have the logo here

33
00:01:26,110 --> 00:01:29,220
So by default or any free spline plan

34
00:01:29,220 --> 00:01:31,730
you also have a watermark on your export

35
00:01:31,740 --> 00:01:33,750
So to get rid of it

36
00:01:33,780 --> 00:01:37,070
you have to use a subscription from spline here

37
00:01:37,080 --> 00:01:40,760
and then you can actually deactivate the watermark here

38
00:01:41,010 --> 00:01:41,880
So next up

39
00:01:41,880 --> 00:01:43,230
we have the background color here

40
00:01:43,230 --> 00:01:46,910
So you can simply hide it or show it depending on your use case

41
00:01:47,370 --> 00:01:53,830
Then you have the page scroll so you can deactivate or activate it also depending on your use case

42
00:01:54,310 --> 00:02:00,370
So maybe if you integrate it into your website and you don't want the users to be allowed to scroll

43
00:02:00,370 --> 00:02:06,320
so you can deactivate it here and you can also hide your cursor here

44
00:02:06,330 --> 00:02:07,160
So by default

45
00:02:07,170 --> 00:02:07,820
it's visible

46
00:02:07,880 --> 00:02:09,660
but you can also just hide it

47
00:02:10,150 --> 00:02:13,710
So and next up is the orbit pan and zoom function here

48
00:02:13,730 --> 00:02:16,520
And for the guys of you that don't know what it is

49
00:02:16,550 --> 00:02:20,680
I will maybe just activate it and hit play here

50
00:02:20,910 --> 00:02:23,520
So and while I'm holding my left

51
00:02:23,530 --> 00:02:26,710
the mouse cursor here and dragging across

52
00:02:27,260 --> 00:02:30,190
you now see what's called orbit here

53
00:02:30,620 --> 00:02:36,480
And when I click my mouse wheel and drag my design across here to any side I want

54
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:38,200
this is called pen

55
00:02:38,570 --> 00:02:39,690
And then of course

56
00:02:39,690 --> 00:02:42,210
you also have the zoom function here

57
00:02:42,570 --> 00:02:46,570
And this is what you simply can activate or deactivate here

58
00:02:46,670 --> 00:02:47,560
So for example

59
00:02:47,570 --> 00:02:52,410
now if I deactivate everything and simulate again

60
00:02:52,440 --> 00:02:55,500
now I can't orbit or I can't drag it across here

61
00:02:55,530 --> 00:02:57,770
or even zoom in or zoom out

62
00:02:58,970 --> 00:03:02,040
And then you also have the soft orbit function here

63
00:03:02,040 --> 00:03:06,780
So if I go back to the export settings and maybe activate orbit again

64
00:03:06,890 --> 00:03:07,960
So by default

65
00:03:07,970 --> 00:03:10,870
it's activated to a soft orbit function here

66
00:03:11,060 --> 00:03:13,520
but I will maybe just show you the difference

67
00:03:13,710 --> 00:03:17,940
So this is what it looks like with the soft orbit function now

68
00:03:18,420 --> 00:03:23,000
And when I deactivate it and simulate again

69
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:25,820
you now see that it's not so really damp

70
00:03:26,020 --> 00:03:30,030
So this is a little nice feature here that you can also use

71
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:31,290
So next up

72
00:03:31,290 --> 00:03:32,860
we have the touch settings here

73
00:03:32,860 --> 00:03:35,800
So this is mainly for phone and tablet use

74
00:03:35,950 --> 00:03:40,560
So here you declare how you can actually interact with your design

75
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:41,370
So for example

76
00:03:41,700 --> 00:03:45,440
the orbit function here is triggered by using two fingers

77
00:03:45,710 --> 00:03:48,970
or the pen function by using three fingers

78
00:03:48,980 --> 00:03:51,900
And the zoom is done by pinching

79
00:03:52,130 --> 00:03:59,040
And you can just maybe also use a different amount of fingers for every function here

80
00:03:59,090 --> 00:04:02,140
And you can also just deactivate the page scro

81
00:04:02,140 --> 00:04:02,880
for instance

82
00:04:02,890 --> 00:04:06,250
or also deactivating the zoom

83
00:04:52,430 --> 00:04:52,860
So

84
00:04:52,860 --> 00:04:55,030
and then we will come to the next topic

85
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:56,570
This is on hover trigger

86
00:04:56,780 --> 00:04:59,100
So if we just activate it

87
00:04:59,170 --> 00:05:01,720
we can now choose the behavior of

88
00:05:06,770 --> 00:05:08,560
So then on to the next

89
00:05:10,220 --> 00:05:12,010
So then on to the next topic

90
00:05:12,020 --> 00:05:13,580
This is on hover event

91
00:05:13,580 --> 00:05:20,600
So here we can just simply choose the behavior of what happens when we hover into our scene here

92
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:21,640
So for example

93
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:28,270
we can use Orbit camera here and also use the sensitivity and damping factor here

94
00:05:28,330 --> 00:05:31,030
So maybe if I just simulate again

95
00:05:31,090 --> 00:05:33,190
you now see what this does here

96
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:35,530
So while I'm hovering around in this scene

97
00:05:35,660 --> 00:05:38,210
we can orbit our object here

98
00:05:39,010 --> 00:05:41,860
And depending on the values here

99
00:05:42,230 --> 00:05:49,910
we can also maybe decrease the sensitivity a little bit and increasing the damping here

100
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:51,650
And now if we simulate

101
00:05:51,650 --> 00:05:54,260
againthis looks much more

102
00:05:54,840 --> 00:05:57,300
yeahdamped and continues here

103
00:05:58,320 --> 00:06:05,600
And then we also can choose if we want to reset it if we have out or it doesn't

104
00:06:06,470 --> 00:06:08,650
Yeahwe want to reset at all here

105
00:06:09,350 --> 00:06:09,970
And of course

106
00:06:09,970 --> 00:06:12,080
we can also do it for pen here

107
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:17,320
So if I activate pen behavior and hovering around in the scene

108
00:06:17,320 --> 00:06:21,850
you now see that I can pan around the object now

109
00:06:22,810 --> 00:06:26,300
Soand then you can also activate limits for orbit

110
00:06:26,300 --> 00:06:27,530
pan and zoom here

111
00:06:27,590 --> 00:06:28,210
And for that

112
00:06:28,410 --> 00:06:35,220
I will maybe just deactivate the on hover function and make sure that I can orbit pan and zoom here

113
00:06:35,490 --> 00:06:37,660
So I will activate those again

114
00:06:38,170 --> 00:06:42,170
And then I will maybe just activate the orbit limits for now

115
00:06:42,620 --> 00:06:44,680
And here you now have the direction here

116
00:06:44,890 --> 00:06:50,740
so you can choose of both here or only horizontal and only vertical here

117
00:06:51,130 --> 00:06:53,730
And then you can also set some boundaries here

118
00:06:53,730 --> 00:06:54,870
So for example

119
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:59,900
now if I maybe just choose a value of 10 here

120
00:06:59,980 --> 00:07:01,360
so around 10

121
00:07:01,420 --> 00:07:02,200
and simulate

122
00:07:02,210 --> 00:07:10,010
now you see that I can now only drag around like 10 degrees here in every direction

123
00:07:10,010 --> 00:07:13,160
so it's reaching the boundaries there

124
00:07:14,280 --> 00:07:17,920
And maybe when I exceed this value now

125
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:20,880
so maybe to left and right

126
00:07:21,910 --> 00:07:24,350
so maybe like 45 degrees

127
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:25,430
something like that

128
00:07:25,920 --> 00:07:30,140
You now see that I can go much further until I hit the boundary

129
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:33,100
And yeah

130
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:37,780
And then you also have like a little animation here

131
00:07:37,940 --> 00:07:39,670
So this is a soft limit now

132
00:07:40,450 --> 00:07:42,440
Now I've got it by none here

133
00:07:42,440 --> 00:07:46,200
but you can also do bounce or an ease transition here

134
00:07:46,470 --> 00:07:47,270
So for example

135
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:52,480
if I hit bounce now and simulate again and reach a boundary

136
00:07:53,170 --> 00:07:55,800
you now see that it is bouncing back

137
00:07:57,430 --> 00:07:59,190
And this is also like a little

138
00:08:00,010 --> 00:08:02,920
yeahnice smoothing function here you can use

139
00:08:04,070 --> 00:08:08,560
And you now got just the same functionality also for pan and zoom here

140
00:08:08,620 --> 00:08:09,300
So again

141
00:08:09,300 --> 00:08:10,800
you have pan here

142
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:13,930
directionand also some boundaries that you can change

143
00:08:14,100 --> 00:08:15,540
And for the zoom limits

144
00:08:15,540 --> 00:08:17,960
you can use a min and max value here

145
00:08:18,440 --> 00:08:18,900
So

146
00:08:18,900 --> 00:08:19,600
and next up

147
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:21,490
we have the animated turntable here

148
00:08:21,670 --> 00:08:23,690
So if we activate it

149
00:08:23,930 --> 00:08:30,650
and maybe I will reduce the speed here to something like 0．5 and simulate again

150
00:08:30,650 --> 00:08:34,780
Now you see that our object is actually rotating

151
00:08:35,040 --> 00:08:36,730
but because of our boundaries

152
00:08:36,740 --> 00:08:38,400
it actually stops

153
00:08:38,790 --> 00:08:44,820
Now I will maybe just inactivate all of the limits here

154
00:08:46,330 --> 00:08:52,330
So deactivate the zoom limits and also the orbit limits here

155
00:08:52,540 --> 00:08:54,540
And now if we simulate again

156
00:08:55,260 --> 00:08:59,940
we now see that it's getting rotated around the axis here

157
00:09:01,480 --> 00:09:05,310
and you can make it faster or slower

158
00:09:05,320 --> 00:09:07,940
or you can also choose a direction here

159
00:09:07,940 --> 00:09:08,680
So for now

160
00:09:08,680 --> 00:09:09,550
it was right

161
00:09:10,170 --> 00:09:14,470
You can also maybe do it on the left side and then faster here

162
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:16,260
So this is much faster now

163
00:09:17,150 --> 00:09:21,250
but this is also like a little nice feature you can use

164
00:09:21,590 --> 00:09:22,430
So next up

165
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:25,040
you also have an event behavior here

166
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:31,710
so you can choose if the trigger and will stop at an object or it will pass through the object

167
00:09:31,900 --> 00:09:36,480
And the last two here are mainly for the file size

168
00:09:36,610 --> 00:09:38,360
So for the material

169
00:09:38,360 --> 00:09:40,740
if you're using glass materials

170
00:09:40,740 --> 00:09:43,360
you can set the precision of the glass here

171
00:09:43,400 --> 00:09:45,940
So a higher value means also more quality

172
00:09:46,090 --> 00:09:49,190
but also a larger file size here

173
00:09:49,670 --> 00:09:53,040
And here you can also activate compression

174
00:09:53,150 --> 00:09:54,800
So for example

175
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:58,690
you can use if you want to have more performance or more quality

176
00:09:58,690 --> 00:09:59,280
So again

177
00:09:59,290 --> 00:09:59,940
more performance

178
00:10:01,650 --> 00:10:07,060
yeaha less file size and more quality is a bigger file size here

179
00:10:07,480 --> 00:10:13,250
And then you can also just change the image image quality here by using the slider

180
00:10:13,970 --> 00:10:17,550
And you can also activate or deactivate the preload

181
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:18,580
So

182
00:10:18,580 --> 00:10:22,440
and maybe if you worry about your file size or performance in general

183
00:10:22,440 --> 00:10:29,340
you can just go to the overview tab here and down below you have this little performance testing tool here

184
00:10:29,570 --> 00:10:32,590
And maybe if we just click on run test

185
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:36,010
we now see some metrics or benchmarks here

186
00:10:36,010 --> 00:10:37,200
So for example

187
00:10:37,430 --> 00:10:41,720
we also see the file size here and time score in general

188
00:10:42,660 --> 00:10:46,310
and also some metrics here of how many objects you used

189
00:10:46,310 --> 00:10:47,380
how many Booleans

190
00:10:47,390 --> 00:10:48,310
and so on

191
00:10:48,840 --> 00:10:53,830
And also a nice little feature here is the Opportunities tab

192
00:10:53,860 --> 00:10:59,320
So this just shows you if you have unused assets in your project here

193
00:10:59,370 --> 00:11:00,320
So for example

194
00:11:00,540 --> 00:11:01,870
I have a color here

195
00:11:01,870 --> 00:11:02,930
which I don't use

196
00:11:02,940 --> 00:11:04,720
and this is also just

197
00:11:05,500 --> 00:11:06,860
yeahsize here

198
00:11:06,860 --> 00:11:09,740
so file size that we can get rid of here

199
00:11:09,750 --> 00:11:10,970
And to do that

200
00:11:10,970 --> 00:11:15,660
we can just click on the trash bin here or remove the unused acids here

201
00:11:17,210 --> 00:11:17,950
All right

202
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:20,870
so and in general

203
00:11:20,870 --> 00:11:22,420
for the overview tab here

204
00:11:22,420 --> 00:11:38,450
we can again switch in between our scenes here or our cameras and also deactivate the benchmark here if we have the Pro subscription from Spline and also can activate a little spinner here

205
00:11:38,450 --> 00:11:46,410
So this is just when the file size is actually quite big and the user's connection isn't really that good

206
00:11:46,420 --> 00:11:48,600
It will show a little preloaded here

207
00:11:48,860 --> 00:11:52,670
And this one is available in both dark and light mode

208
00:11:53,260 --> 00:11:56,400
You can also just show a loading preview

209
00:11:56,730 --> 00:11:59,050
and you can also give a little hint here

210
00:11:59,050 --> 00:12:01,990
So if you have orbit activate it

211
00:12:01,990 --> 00:12:05,110
you can activate a little animation

212
00:12:05,110 --> 00:12:06,090
which will be shown

213
00:12:07,060 --> 00:12:13,210
This should help the user that you can actually interact with the design here

214
00:12:13,390 --> 00:12:15,400
And I can also show you this one here

215
00:12:15,640 --> 00:12:15,810
maybe

216
00:12:15,810 --> 00:12:17,250
So on top here

217
00:12:17,250 --> 00:12:21,080
you have your custom Spline project domain

218
00:12:21,110 --> 00:12:23,520
which you can open by this little arrow

219
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:24,600
So if I click on it

220
00:12:24,680 --> 00:12:27,690
now you see in your browser your design

221
00:12:28,310 --> 00:12:32,830
and then also here you see the little hint here that you can move it around

222
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:41,940
And here you can also just copy the link by clicking on it and also copy and embed here

223
00:12:42,250 --> 00:12:46,250
So for the guys of you that maybe know iframes

224
00:12:46,250 --> 00:12:51,380
so you also can embed your design as an iframe here

225
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:53,790
Then next up

226
00:12:53,790 --> 00:12:55,770
we have the viewer export function

227
00:12:56,100 --> 00:12:59,240
So here we got a little nice JavaScript code

228
00:12:59,240 --> 00:13:05,020
which we can in any website or content management is still

229
00:13:09,660 --> 00:13:10,410
Then next up

230
00:13:10,410 --> 00:13:12,770
we have the viewer export function here

231
00:13:12,770 --> 00:13:17,920
So here we got a little JavaScript code and also production domain

232
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:23,250
And the only difference to this tab here is actually the mouse events

233
00:13:23,320 --> 00:13:26,070
So you can choose if those

234
00:13:26,520 --> 00:13:30,700
yeahI applied to the canvas container or the global window here

235
00:13:30,710 --> 00:13:33,020
but the rest is actually the same

236
00:13:33,020 --> 00:13:33,620
So again

237
00:13:33,620 --> 00:13:35,760
also for the play settings here

238
00:13:35,860 --> 00:13:40,560
So this just differs by the type of integration here

239
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:42,790
So here you've got the JavaScript code

240
00:13:42,860 --> 00:13:47,020
and this is more like domain or iframe based here

241
00:13:47,490 --> 00:13:48,560
And last but not least

242
00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:50,200
we have the code export here

243
00:13:50,200 --> 00:13:52,400
so for the developers of you

244
00:13:52,400 --> 00:13:57,350
so you also get the possibility to integrate it to something like 3 JS React

245
00:13:57,390 --> 00:13:59,910
next traces or anything else

246
00:14:00,130 --> 00:14:01,490
But yeah

247
00:14:01,490 --> 00:14:03,650
this will be done in another video

248
00:14:03,740 --> 00:14:06,900
So this whole programming thing

249
00:14:06,900 --> 00:14:09,270
I will append afterwards to the clause

250
00:14:09,420 --> 00:14:14,460
So now we will just focus on the public Url and the viewer export function
