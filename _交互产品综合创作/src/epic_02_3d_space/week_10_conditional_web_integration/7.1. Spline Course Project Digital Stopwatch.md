1
00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:04,010
So then let's start with the stopwatch project for now

2
00:00:04,220 --> 00:00:06,120
So we have just

3
00:00:06,120 --> 00:00:08,800
againour basic spying here now

4
00:00:09,020 --> 00:00:10,520
And for now

5
00:00:10,520 --> 00:00:15,360
I will just begin with the body of the digital stopwatch

6
00:00:15,680 --> 00:00:16,630
And to do that

7
00:00:16,630 --> 00:00:21,470
we can just bring a circle up here on our base plane

8
00:00:22,670 --> 00:00:24,860
And then let's increase this a little bit

9
00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:31,050
So by holding option and shift can make it a little bit bigger as you want

10
00:00:32,460 --> 00:00:36,040
And I can actually just hide this base plane for now

11
00:00:36,340 --> 00:00:40,040
So you just have this circle here

12
00:00:40,860 --> 00:00:47,140
Okayand then we can start by extruding the circle

13
00:00:47,370 --> 00:00:54,290
So rotate a little bit and choose the width edge as you want now

14
00:00:54,300 --> 00:00:55,150
So for me

15
00:00:55,160 --> 00:01:04,560
let's go with this kind of I and then maybe some smoother edges also

16
00:01:04,560 --> 00:01:08,140
So I will just increase the bevel here a little bit

17
00:01:10,670 --> 00:01:14,260
Okayand then this should be our body for now

18
00:01:14,770 --> 00:01:21,950
Soand then what I'm trying to do now is I want to add a little light ring here later on in the project

19
00:01:21,950 --> 00:01:27,220
So I will use a Boolean operators to make a little extrusion here

20
00:01:27,480 --> 00:01:28,660
And to do so

21
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:31,750
I will just reset the view here to frontal

22
00:01:33,660 --> 00:01:45,030
And then I will draw another ellipse here and also make it a little bit bigger by holding option and shift so you can size it evenly

23
00:01:48,010 --> 00:01:50,020
And also give it a little bit of extrusion

24
00:01:51,250 --> 00:01:54,410
I will just simply just recolor it for now

25
00:01:55,320 --> 00:01:56,380
The difference

26
00:01:57,060 --> 00:01:58,670
it's easier to see

27
00:02:00,760 --> 00:02:02,140
And now what you guys maybe see

28
00:02:02,140 --> 00:02:03,330
it's not really centered

29
00:02:03,330 --> 00:02:07,580
So I will just head over here to the position tab

30
00:02:08,670 --> 00:02:11,040
So the bigger one is now at -2

31
00:02:11,040 --> 00:02:12,900
13 and 1

32
00:02:14,550 --> 00:02:19,190
And so I will choose also here -13

33
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:20,880
Ohwhat was it

34
00:02:21,090 --> 00:02:22,000
-2

35
00:02:24,040 --> 00:02:26,500
Minus two and 13

36
00:02:27,870 --> 00:02:28,620
okay

37
00:02:31,180 --> 00:02:34,510
So now the inner circle is now centered

38
00:02:35,810 --> 00:02:42,570
And what I'm going to do right now is actually subtract this little circle from the big one

39
00:02:44,220 --> 00:02:44,940
But first

40
00:02:44,960 --> 00:02:48,810
I actually wanted to make it a little bit bigger now

41
00:02:51,640 --> 00:02:52,640
Maybe like that

42
00:02:53,830 --> 00:02:56,310
And also the ring should be a ring

43
00:02:56,310 --> 00:02:59,440
So I will actually increase the ring value here

44
00:03:00,890 --> 00:03:02,440
So maybe like this

45
00:03:05,860 --> 00:03:12,480
And then move this little ring inside of the bigger ring

46
00:03:14,030 --> 00:03:15,450
So maybe like that

47
00:03:16,350 --> 00:03:17,820
And check the front view again

48
00:03:17,820 --> 00:03:19,510
So looks good for now

49
00:03:21,070 --> 00:03:26,250
And then I will select both of the ellipse now and then

50
00:03:28,380 --> 00:03:29,430
I will not this one

51
00:03:32,960 --> 00:03:36,270
And then I will select both of the ellipses now

52
00:03:38,780 --> 00:03:41,410
And then choose on the Boolean modifier

53
00:03:41,410 --> 00:03:42,910
Here is the first choice

54
00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:49,750
And then you see now that the first one got subtracted from the second one

55
00:03:52,470 --> 00:03:54,280
And also the color changed now

56
00:03:54,580 --> 00:03:58,560
So we're just going back to the gray here

57
00:04:00,010 --> 00:04:01,770
And now inside of this later

58
00:04:01,770 --> 00:04:02,360
he will

59
00:04:02,980 --> 00:04:05,080
we will placing this light ring now

60
00:04:06,570 --> 00:04:07,680
But first for now

61
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:10,400
we just have the basic shape now here

62
00:04:10,410 --> 00:04:11,510
the body shape

63
00:04:12,150 --> 00:04:15,720
Soand then we will actually use a little trick

64
00:04:15,720 --> 00:04:18,470
So we just divided

65
00:04:18,980 --> 00:04:22,260
We just subtract the ellipse 2 here from the whole thing

66
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:25,340
But we can actually also

67
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:28,790
we actually wanted to use later for the light ring

68
00:04:29,590 --> 00:04:35,090
We'll just duplicate this ellipse now and place it out of the Boolean modifier

69
00:04:36,590 --> 00:04:38,490
And now you see it like that

70
00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:43,030
and then just decrease the extrusion again

71
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:46,980
So you can just do like two or something

72
00:04:48,700 --> 00:04:51,920
And now you see that the ring perfectly fits here inside

73
00:04:51,920 --> 00:04:54,930
And you also have this negative extrusion out

74
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:02,080
And for better clarification

75
00:05:02,140 --> 00:05:06,900
we will simply also rename the shapes

76
00:05:07,170 --> 00:05:10,720
So this will be the light ring

77
00:05:13,080 --> 00:05:15,600
And this is just the body

78
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:21,280
And this is

79
00:05:25,300 --> 00:05:27,000
Big circle

80
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:27,360
maybe

81
00:05:27,910 --> 00:05:29,990
And I don't know other

82
00:05:31,350 --> 00:05:32,450
just sorry

83
00:05:33,190 --> 00:05:35,290
this was a small circle

84
00:05:37,130 --> 00:05:37,950
Small circle

85
00:05:39,510 --> 00:05:43,030
And this is a big circle

86
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:46,860
Okay

87
00:05:47,810 --> 00:05:50,940
soand then what we also need is like a little knob

88
00:05:50,940 --> 00:05:53,680
so where you activate the stopwatch

89
00:05:54,830 --> 00:05:56,480
And to do that

90
00:05:56,480 --> 00:06:02,440
we will actually use the star shape here now and

91
00:06:04,900 --> 00:06:05,450
Oh wait

92
00:06:05,480 --> 00:06:06,310
I will do it again

93
00:06:06,310 --> 00:06:06,680
Now

94
00:06:08,310 --> 00:06:11,530
Actuallywe can maybe also choose the top here again

95
00:06:12,770 --> 00:06:15,780
So rotate the scene upwards here

96
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:21,290
And then you can place this star icon on the stopwatch

97
00:06:21,940 --> 00:06:28,230
You can maybe align it here and then already move it where you want it

98
00:06:28,360 --> 00:06:30,620
So try to center it

99
00:06:32,690 --> 00:06:34,720
And then give it a little extrusion

100
00:06:38,310 --> 00:06:39,300
So maybe

101
00:06:39,300 --> 00:06:42,990
yeahmaybe like that a little bit more

102
00:06:42,990 --> 00:06:43,560
maybe

103
00:06:46,510 --> 00:06:52,600
Okayand then you can also bevel it like this one

104
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:55,220
So it looks like more

105
00:06:55,230 --> 00:06:57,000
it looks more like a knob

106
00:06:57,400 --> 00:07:00,530
but actually it's a little bit too tiny in my opinion

107
00:07:00,910 --> 00:07:03,400
So I will actually increase the size here

108
00:07:03,820 --> 00:07:06,270
So maybe to like 60

109
00:07:10,320 --> 00:07:11,420
Or maybe even more

110
00:07:11,480 --> 00:07:12,820
Maybe like 80

111
00:07:17,820 --> 00:07:20,820
And then also maybe some more sides here

112
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:23,200
So like this

113
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:26,410
Yeahlike that

114
00:07:27,630 --> 00:07:31,550
You can also increase the bevel sizes here a little bit

115
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:37,280
Maybe the corners also

116
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:43,110
So it gets a little bit more concentrated to the to the inner circle

117
00:07:43,960 --> 00:07:46,190
And that's what I'm doing with the corner value here

118
00:07:46,200 --> 00:07:48,300
So don't worry

119
00:07:48,300 --> 00:07:50,440
this is quite computing intense

120
00:07:50,450 --> 00:07:51,600
So it could take a while

121
00:07:54,220 --> 00:07:54,410
Yeah

122
00:07:54,410 --> 00:07:57,880
but I think this looks like a nice knob here

123
00:08:00,380 --> 00:08:05,630
And now I will actually move this thing up a little bit

124
00:08:08,450 --> 00:08:14,660
And now I will also insert a little shaft here where this button actually triggers on

125
00:08:15,620 --> 00:08:16,490
And to do so

126
00:08:16,490 --> 00:08:17,220
you can

127
00:08:18,590 --> 00:08:22,290
I will actually move this a little bit more up now

128
00:08:23,630 --> 00:08:25,040
rotate the scene

129
00:08:25,260 --> 00:08:27,330
and then I will place

130
00:08:27,690 --> 00:08:28,080
I don't know

131
00:08:28,340 --> 00:08:30,290
maybe I will look from above

132
00:08:30,290 --> 00:08:30,800
you know

133
00:08:32,290 --> 00:08:34,630
So take the top bird view here

134
00:08:35,090 --> 00:08:37,670
and then we will place a little circle here

135
00:08:39,900 --> 00:08:41,770
And also extrude it

136
00:08:44,970 --> 00:08:46,190
I have to look at the

137
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,270
yeahmaybe that's good

138
00:08:50,870 --> 00:08:53,130
Maybe a little bit more extrusion here

139
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:55,630
Yeahthis looks good

140
00:08:56,830 --> 00:09:02,160
And now you can actually select both of the shaft and the star now and rotate it

141
00:09:04,940 --> 00:09:05,420
By

142
00:09:07,470 --> 00:09:07,790
Ohno

143
00:09:07,830 --> 00:09:09,010
not like that

144
00:09:09,020 --> 00:09:10,930
We have to group it first

145
00:09:11,550 --> 00:09:16,320
So select the star in the ellipse and then press command G

146
00:09:17,020 --> 00:09:18,360
now you have it grouped up

147
00:09:18,680 --> 00:09:22,910
I will also rename it to maybe we like button

148
00:09:24,830 --> 00:09:27,690
And now when you have both of the shapes now in the group

149
00:09:28,070 --> 00:09:32,750
you can actually rotate it to 180 degrees here

150
00:09:35,390 --> 00:09:39,590
And then we will change to the front view now again

151
00:09:39,610 --> 00:09:42,460
and we can bring this button down here

152
00:09:43,480 --> 00:09:45,130
So maybe like that

153
00:09:47,740 --> 00:09:48,940
Yeahthat looks good

154
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:56,040
So we are getting further in the direction we want to be

155
00:09:56,660 --> 00:09:59,950
So now we have the body and the knob here on top

156
00:10:02,610 --> 00:10:04,170
And for now

157
00:10:04,170 --> 00:10:07,150
we can also start with no news here

158
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:11,910
So you may notice every stopwatch has some no news on it

159
00:10:13,210 --> 00:10:15,420
And so to create the no news

160
00:10:15,420 --> 00:10:20,780
we will simply just make a little rectangle here and give it another color

161
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:27,690
And then we will make it a little bit smaller here

162
00:10:30,630 --> 00:10:33,440
So maybe like this

163
00:10:36,370 --> 00:10:37,840
Yeahthat looks good

164
00:10:38,070 --> 00:10:41,450
And then we will actually make use of the cloner element

165
00:10:43,110 --> 00:10:44,790
The rectangle 2 should be selected

166
00:10:44,910 --> 00:10:47,960
And then you activate the Clo cloner module

167
00:10:48,700 --> 00:10:50,860
And now we will choose as the type

168
00:10:50,950 --> 00:10:52,790
we will choose a radio function

169
00:10:54,110 --> 00:10:58,860
and then we should also hide the base of the middle part here

170
00:11:00,010 --> 00:11:05,740
And then we can increase the count here to maybe like something like 16

171
00:11:06,140 --> 00:11:09,090
So it should be an even value because of the non-us

172
00:11:09,100 --> 00:11:11,110
so 360 degrees

173
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:14,760
and then you can divide it by 16

174
00:11:14,760 --> 00:11:19,550
and then you have a little nice gap here between the no

175
00:11:21,350 --> 00:11:25,750
And what's also important now is the alignment now

176
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:28,250
so if you choose yes now

177
00:11:28,990 --> 00:11:29,790
now you see

178
00:11:29,800 --> 00:11:33,180
so it's every notice is horizontal here

179
00:11:33,980 --> 00:11:35,570
And if you change the alignment

180
00:11:35,570 --> 00:11:39,610
now it's more aligned to the center

181
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:44,290
And if we now change the rotation value

182
00:11:44,290 --> 00:11:47,520
now here you guys see what I'm trying to do

183
00:11:49,820 --> 00:11:52,210
Is getting zonia here

184
00:11:52,220 --> 00:11:55,760
so it should be -90 or plus 90

185
00:11:56,470 --> 00:11:57,910
depending how you see it

186
00:11:59,960 --> 00:12:07,270
And then we will increase the radius here so it fits to our I

187
00:12:07,420 --> 00:12:15,030
the ring also have to change the position here a little bit because it's not centered

188
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:15,680
right

189
00:12:17,610 --> 00:12:19,370
So maybe like this

190
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:21,710
okay

191
00:12:23,300 --> 00:12:27,380
But actually the newness is a little bit too big in my opinion

192
00:12:27,380 --> 00:12:33,610
So I will actually make it a little bit smaller by adjusting the parent size here

193
00:12:33,790 --> 00:12:37,790
Alsothe children is also getting changed

194
00:12:39,450 --> 00:12:40,990
So maybe like this

195
00:12:45,060 --> 00:12:50,040
Okayso and now again

196
00:12:50,040 --> 00:12:52,480
center it a little bit more

197
00:12:54,040 --> 00:12:57,470
Yeahand then increase the radius to your knees

198
00:13:00,580 --> 00:13:01,810
Yeahmaybe like this

199
00:13:01,820 --> 00:13:03,820
So this looks good for now

200
00:13:06,030 --> 00:13:11,060
I will change the color to white maybe again here so you see it a little bit better

201
00:13:12,270 --> 00:13:14,650
So now you have a big nous

202
00:13:14,660 --> 00:13:17,730
but I also want to do a sub nous

203
00:13:17,730 --> 00:13:19,480
so between the bigger ones

204
00:13:20,690 --> 00:13:22,250
and to do so

205
00:13:22,300 --> 00:13:25,020
I will just rename this one to the big nos

206
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:37,290
And then duplicate this cloner module and call it the small onions

207
00:13:43,780 --> 00:13:49,350
And then we can actually just rotate the no news first

208
00:13:50,660 --> 00:13:53,460
So changing the z value here

209
00:13:55,220 --> 00:13:56,460
maybe like that

210
00:13:57,900 --> 00:13:59,900
I will also give it another color for now

211
00:13:59,900 --> 00:14:04,280
So maybe a little bit more dark here

212
00:14:07,980 --> 00:14:08,590
And then

213
00:14:11,520 --> 00:14:12,170
You can

214
00:14:12,570 --> 00:14:16,600
ohmaybe I will just redo it shortly

215
00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:19,850
So just press command Z

216
00:14:20,380 --> 00:14:20,940
and first

217
00:14:20,940 --> 00:14:24,040
we're actually going to resize this

218
00:14:25,580 --> 00:14:27,640
So make it a little bit smaller here

219
00:14:27,900 --> 00:14:29,630
smallerno use

220
00:14:31,390 --> 00:14:32,310
maybe like that

221
00:14:33,900 --> 00:14:36,480
And now we can actually rotate it

222
00:14:36,640 --> 00:14:39,940
So you see now we be the difference

223
00:14:43,630 --> 00:14:43,970
So yeah

224
00:14:44,020 --> 00:14:44,920
maybe like that

225
00:14:47,500 --> 00:14:49,540
And then also give it another color

226
00:14:49,540 --> 00:14:52,080
So we will just do it a little bit darker here

227
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:54,000
And then

228
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:58,180
yeahthen you have the basic shape of the stopwatch ready

229
00:15:00,010 --> 00:15:00,230
So

230
00:15:00,230 --> 00:15:03,670
and to bring this stopwatch alive a little bit more

231
00:15:03,670 --> 00:15:09,860
so we actually going to change the material of the I was a body for now

232
00:15:10,830 --> 00:15:14,990
and I want to achieve a little more metal look like so

233
00:15:15,010 --> 00:15:18,500
A little bit of matte metal shininess

234
00:15:19,280 --> 00:15:21,090
And to do so

235
00:15:21,100 --> 00:15:24,650
I will create a new layer here

236
00:15:26,550 --> 00:15:30,150
which we are going to choose a matte cap layer

237
00:15:31,300 --> 00:15:32,880
And from the library

238
00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:34,660
you can maybe choose this one

239
00:15:34,660 --> 00:15:36,150
So this is very shiny

240
00:15:36,150 --> 00:15:38,110
this is a little bit less shiny

241
00:15:38,560 --> 00:15:41,780
and this is also a little bit matte here

242
00:15:42,100 --> 00:15:46,340
So this is a good solution in between matte and shiny

243
00:15:47,910 --> 00:15:50,280
And so we take this one here

244
00:15:55,740 --> 00:15:58,380
And then we actually move it down here

245
00:15:59,710 --> 00:16:01,980
So to the very bottom here

246
00:16:05,220 --> 00:16:06,640
We actually don't need the color anymore

247
00:16:06,760 --> 00:16:10,320
So we're actually going to hide this color for now

248
00:16:10,940 --> 00:16:14,040
And this already looks pretty nice

249
00:16:14,070 --> 00:16:16,650
but we can actually also add some Fresnel

250
00:16:16,780 --> 00:16:17,770
maybe be here

251
00:16:17,780 --> 00:16:20,480
So let's choose the Fresnel layer here

252
00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:25,760
And then maybe reduce the bias here a little bit

253
00:16:28,420 --> 00:16:29,980
Maybe a little bit negative here

254
00:16:31,450 --> 00:16:32,680
Yeahthis looks good

255
00:16:32,690 --> 00:16:32,830
maybe

256
00:16:35,980 --> 00:16:36,520
Okay

257
00:16:41,630 --> 00:16:47,540
And then we maybe can also do some little rainbow effect here

258
00:16:50,290 --> 00:16:58,450
Maybe just changing the opacity to something like the Note 12 or maybe even less like this

259
00:17:02,460 --> 00:17:06,870
So you get a little bit more detail here

260
00:17:07,180 --> 00:17:08,720
So this looks good for now

261
00:17:10,020 --> 00:17:15,400
And now we can actually save this material here

262
00:17:15,430 --> 00:17:17,800
So by clicking the four dots here

263
00:17:18,040 --> 00:17:23,920
and then we will create a new material here called Metal Dark

264
00:17:25,410 --> 00:17:29,010
And now we have saved it to our material assets panel here

265
00:17:29,720 --> 00:17:35,070
and then we can also maybe to use a knob here in this material

266
00:17:35,510 --> 00:17:43,650
I will also quickly just rename it here to knob and the ellipse to a shaft here

267
00:17:48,590 --> 00:17:50,560
Okayand then also again

268
00:17:50,570 --> 00:17:51,810
choose the knob

269
00:17:52,340 --> 00:18:02,310
And then you can actually access metal dark material from the acid library and give it also the metal material

270
00:18:04,700 --> 00:18:07,840
So this looks definitely better right now

271
00:18:08,500 --> 00:18:13,160
I would also change the background here to maybe some black here

272
00:18:17,430 --> 00:18:20,490
Okayso

273
00:18:20,490 --> 00:18:24,880
and for the shaft now we will actually just make it white

274
00:18:25,910 --> 00:18:27,360
So maybe like this

275
00:18:29,730 --> 00:18:31,810
And then for the lightning type

276
00:18:31,970 --> 00:18:34,280
we can just keep it by phone here

277
00:18:36,100 --> 00:18:36,830
But actually

278
00:18:36,830 --> 00:18:41,580
I will move this button a little bit more down now here

279
00:18:42,570 --> 00:18:43,590
maybe like this

280
00:18:43,660 --> 00:18:44,550
Okay

281
00:18:45,160 --> 00:18:48,720
so this looks already more like a​‌​‌​​‌‌​​‌‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌​​‌‌​​‌‌​​‌‌​​‌‌​​‌‌​‌​‌‌‌​‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌​‌​‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌​‌‌​​​‌‌‌‌‌‌​​‌‌‌​​‌‌‌​‌​‌​‌​​‌‌‌​‌‌​​‌‌​​​‌​​‌‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌‌​‌‌​​‌‌‌​​‌​​‌‌​​​‌​​‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌​‌​‌​​‌‌​‌​‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌‌‌‌​​​‌‌‌​‌‌​​‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌​​‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌​‌‌​​​‌‌​​‌‌​​‌‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌​‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌​​​‌‌‌​​‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌​‌‌‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌‌​​‌‌‌​‌​‌‌‌​​‌‌‌​​‌‌‌​‌‌​​‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌​​​‌‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌​​​‌​​‌‌​​‌‌​​‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌​‌‌‌​​‌‌‌‌‌​​​‌‌​‌‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌​‌‌​​‌‌​‌​‌‌‌​‌​‌‌‌​​‌‌​‌​‌​​‌‌​‌‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌​‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌​‌‌​​​‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌​​‌‌​‌​‌‌‌​‌​‌​‌​​‌‌​‌‌‌‌‌​‌​‌​‌​​‌‌​‌​‌​​‌‌​‌​‌‌‌​‌‌​​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌‌​​‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌​​‌‌‌​​‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌​‌‌‌​​‌‌‌​​‌‌‌​‌​‌‌‌‌‌​‌​‌‌‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌​​‌​​‌‌‌‌‌​​​‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌​‌‌​​‌‌​​‌‌​​‌‌​‌​‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌​‌​‌‌‌​‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌​​​‌​​‌‌‌​​‌​​‌‌‌‌‌‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌​‌‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌​​​‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌​​‌​​‌‌​‌​‌‌‌​‌​‌‌‌​​‌‌​‌‌​​​‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌​‌‌‌​​‌‌‌‌‌​​​‌‌​‌​‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌‌​​‌‌‌​‌​‌‌‌‌‌​‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌‌​​‌‌‌‌‌‌​​‌‌​‌‌‌​​‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌‌​​‌​​‌‌​​‌‌​​‌‌‌​​‌​​‌‌‌​​‌​​‌‌​‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌ stopwatch now

282
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:51,470
but actually we will make some fine adjustments here

283
00:18:51,470 --> 00:18:54,660
I don't really like the big face here from the body

284
00:18:55,810 --> 00:18:58,970
So I will actually just add

285
00:19:00,060 --> 00:19:01,960
reduce the bevel here a little bit

286
00:19:02,870 --> 00:19:04,280
Maybe you like 3

287
00:19:04,510 --> 00:19:06,050
Okaythat's better for now

288
00:19:08,020 --> 00:19:11,700
And then we will start over with the light ring for now

289
00:19:12,600 --> 00:19:13,710
And for the light ring

290
00:19:13,720 --> 00:19:19,500
I am going to change the material here and add a depth layer

291
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:26,750
So we make a little gradient here And so just click on the gradient layer here

292
00:19:26,760 --> 00:19:30,290
And then we will make some maybe like yellow

293
00:19:32,050 --> 00:19:34,160
2 orange here

294
00:19:35,940 --> 00:19:37,240
Yeahmaybe like that

295
00:19:39,430 --> 00:19:41,320
And I don't want it to be RA you

296
00:19:41,330 --> 00:19:43,810
I just want a linear gradient here

297
00:19:45,780 --> 00:19:46,130
And yeah

298
00:19:46,130 --> 00:19:48,040
this looks quite good for now

299
00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:53,220
So

300
00:19:53,220 --> 00:19:59,260
and then I actually want to make another little outline corner here

301
00:19:59,260 --> 00:20:00,910
So the display

302
00:20:00,910 --> 00:20:02,960
so this should be a display later on

303
00:20:03,120 --> 00:20:06,210
is more separated from the rest of the clock

304
00:20:06,820 --> 00:20:07,720
And to do so

305
00:20:07,730 --> 00:20:10,500
I will just align the view here

306
00:20:11,670 --> 00:20:18,650
And then maybe I can just actually copy the light ring here and duplicate it is

307
00:20:18,650 --> 00:20:25,480
So the reason I am duplicating this is because it's centered completely in the middle here

308
00:20:25,860 --> 00:20:30,170
And then I can actually just resize it here

309
00:20:30,170 --> 00:20:31,020
So again

310
00:20:31,020 --> 00:20:36,640
with holding option and shift can actually resize it here

311
00:20:38,130 --> 00:20:46,490
and I would just increase extrusion here a little bit and also remove this material for now

312
00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:50,050
So you see the difference

313
00:20:51,410 --> 00:20:53,240
So if you look around now

314
00:20:53,240 --> 00:20:54,090
here you have a big

315
00:20:54,910 --> 00:20:56,030
big ring here

316
00:20:56,040 --> 00:21:02,140
but we're actually reducing the riff of the ring here by increasing the ring value

317
00:21:02,150 --> 00:21:05,770
So maybe like this

318
00:21:06,430 --> 00:21:08,930
againcheck out the front view here

319
00:21:09,540 --> 00:21:11,720
So this was wasn't actually enough

320
00:21:11,720 --> 00:21:15,050
so I will just resize it down a little bit more

321
00:21:15,050 --> 00:21:15,620
So again

322
00:21:15,630 --> 00:21:17,110
hold option and shift

323
00:21:18,610 --> 00:21:25,090
and then move it so it fits the whole scene

324
00:21:25,090 --> 00:21:25,520
Now

325
00:21:26,940 --> 00:21:28,800
Yeahthis looks quite good

326
00:21:29,610 --> 00:21:31,220
And then so

327
00:21:32,850 --> 00:21:34,700
and then I will increase the bevel

328
00:21:34,700 --> 00:21:39,850
Also here you have much more smoother edges

329
00:21:39,860 --> 00:21:44,650
so in comparison to the bevel here and without bevel

330
00:21:47,480 --> 00:21:49,040
And then for the material

331
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:55,160
I will just add another matte cap layer here so it fits to the rest of the material

332
00:21:56,430 --> 00:21:58,810
And I will choose again this one

333
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:04,150
And then you have a nice little

334
00:22:04,530 --> 00:22:06,180
a nice little country here

335
00:22:06,460 --> 00:22:10,140
So it looks more like a digital display here

336
00:22:11,110 --> 00:22:13,990
Soand then we will add a text here

337
00:22:13,990 --> 00:22:17,930
So which is the display text from the stopwatch

338
00:22:18,140 --> 00:22:30,050
So choose the text function here and then just simply click on the layer and I will actually just drag it here so it fits the scene

339
00:22:31,290 --> 00:22:32,110
the display

340
00:22:33,230 --> 00:22:34,420
So maybe like this

341
00:22:36,050 --> 00:22:37,020
And for example

342
00:22:37,120 --> 00:22:45,950
I will start just with a 0 here and then align it here in the horizontal way and also in the vertical way

343
00:22:47,360 --> 00:22:49,170
So for the color

344
00:22:49,170 --> 00:22:51,980
we actually just choose white here

345
00:22:53,590 --> 00:22:57,050
Soand then we can also maybe like change the font here

346
00:22:57,050 --> 00:22:59,710
So I will maybe just choose 1

347
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:03,240
You can choose anything you like here

348
00:23:03,730 --> 00:23:04,720
I will maybe use

349
00:23:04,940 --> 00:23:05,760
yeahthis one

350
00:23:05,760 --> 00:23:07,390
the Baja jewelry here

351
00:23:08,360 --> 00:23:11,640
it looks a little bit more like some digital typography

352
00:23:12,630 --> 00:23:16,970
and then we can increase so size here a little bit

353
00:23:18,200 --> 00:23:20,630
so maybe like this

354
00:23:21,410 --> 00:23:22,470
And for the weight

355
00:23:22,620 --> 00:23:27,630
we can also go to both here or maybe like semi bolt

356
00:23:27,960 --> 00:23:29,540
yeahlike the semi bold one

357
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:33,380
And yeah

358
00:23:33,780 --> 00:23:34,880
So like that

359
00:23:36,780 --> 00:23:42,170
I know what you maybe notice is that the knob is actually not really aligned to the center right now

360
00:23:42,340 --> 00:23:46,960
So we're actually going to move it more in the middle now

361
00:23:47,480 --> 00:23:49,920
Yeahso this is now more

362
00:23:49,930 --> 00:23:51,350
much more centered

363
00:23:51,650 --> 00:23:52,260
So

364
00:23:52,260 --> 00:23:56,860
and then we can already start maybe with the functionality of the watch

365
00:23:57,430 --> 00:24:01,260
And we will maybe just start over here by the button

366
00:24:01,270 --> 00:24:01,810
actually

367
00:24:03,340 --> 00:24:07,450
And what we can do now is we can create a new state

368
00:24:07,530 --> 00:24:08,140
So again

369
00:24:08,140 --> 00:24:10,900
we have now a base state and the second state

370
00:24:11,630 --> 00:24:14,220
And if you imagine now

371
00:24:14,220 --> 00:24:15,420
if we click on the button

372
00:24:15,420 --> 00:24:18,800
I want that the knob actually moves in a little bit

373
00:24:19,480 --> 00:24:21,820
So we head over to the second state

374
00:24:21,830 --> 00:24:22,470
Now here

375
00:24:24,270 --> 00:24:30,900
actuallyyou're going to place this button a little bit more down

376
00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:32,830
And now you see the difference

377
00:24:32,850 --> 00:24:33,630
actually

378
00:24:33,630 --> 00:24:36,380
So in the default state and in the clicked state

379
00:24:36,380 --> 00:24:39,980
I can even maybe make this more down

380
00:24:42,120 --> 00:24:43,000
Okay

381
00:24:43,320 --> 00:24:47,650
and then we can actually just trigger an event on this button

382
00:24:47,980 --> 00:24:49,490
So create a new event

383
00:24:50,390 --> 00:24:51,530
And then for the trigger

384
00:24:51,600 --> 00:24:53,910
we will choose the mouse down function again

385
00:24:54,980 --> 00:24:57,680
and then we will activate a transition

386
00:24:58,650 --> 00:25:03,610
And this trans transition should apply to the button only once

387
00:25:04,120 --> 00:25:09,600
And we want to go from the base state here to the second state

388
00:25:10,190 --> 00:25:12,600
And I think one second is fine here

389
00:25:13,880 --> 00:25:17,350
So if you simulate now and click on the button

390
00:25:17,350 --> 00:25:19,120
you see that it's moving down

391
00:25:19,240 --> 00:25:23,470
But actually the bottom here comes a little bit out of the watch

392
00:25:23,630 --> 00:25:25,670
So we're actually going to change this

393
00:25:25,670 --> 00:25:26,640
So again

394
00:25:27,230 --> 00:25:30,320
select the second state here

395
00:25:30,320 --> 00:25:35,400
and then we will just move this a little bit more up

396
00:25:36,500 --> 00:25:38,060
Or we can also

397
00:25:39,610 --> 00:25:40,560
I don't know

398
00:25:40,570 --> 00:25:41,140
this is not good

399
00:25:41,480 --> 00:25:44,790
So just move it a little bit up here so it doesn't

400
00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:49,240
Moves out here

401
00:25:49,370 --> 00:25:50,920
out of the watch

402
00:25:52,950 --> 00:25:53,220
Okay

403
00:25:53,220 --> 00:25:54,020
and if you simulate

404
00:25:54,020 --> 00:26:01,420
now you see a little nice animation here can actually make it a little bit faster now

405
00:26:01,840 --> 00:26:06,060
So maybe like 0．6 seconds

406
00:26:08,870 --> 00:26:13,250
Maybe even 0．3 seconds

407
00:26:13,300 --> 00:26:14,500
So it's more like

408
00:26:14,560 --> 00:26:14,720
yeah

409
00:26:16,980 --> 00:26:18,020
That looks great

410
00:26:18,680 --> 00:26:21,200
Okayso

411
00:26:21,220 --> 00:26:23,440
and for the next functionality

412
00:26:23,440 --> 00:26:26,920
now we actually want that by the trigger of the button

413
00:26:26,920 --> 00:26:29,510
the value of the text is changing

414
00:26:29,980 --> 00:26:31,620
So to do so

415
00:26:31,630 --> 00:26:33,220
we will click on the text element

416
00:26:33,300 --> 00:26:36,090
Now I will quickly also rename it

417
00:26:37,170 --> 00:26:41,070
so maybe the counter value

418
00:26:44,680 --> 00:26:46,580
And then also up

419
00:26:46,730 --> 00:26:47,800
just for clarification

420
00:26:47,800 --> 00:26:48,380
I will just

421
00:26:50,780 --> 00:26:53,020
Rename the lighting also here

422
00:26:53,310 --> 00:26:58,260
So you have like the display ring

423
00:26:58,960 --> 00:27:01,440
And this is still the light ring

424
00:27:06,280 --> 00:27:08,770
So then head back over to the counter value here

425
00:27:08,780 --> 00:27:11,760
And then you can choose for the content here

426
00:27:11,830 --> 00:27:14,570
you can actually create a new variable

427
00:27:15,820 --> 00:27:17,290
which is a counter variable

428
00:27:17,810 --> 00:27:18,810
so a dynamic 1

429
00:27:20,130 --> 00:27:24,930
You can rename it to display account

430
00:27:27,320 --> 00:27:30,300
And this display count value starts by 0

431
00:27:31,100 --> 00:27:34,060
And then if you click on the preferences icon here

432
00:27:34,600 --> 00:27:36,780
can actually reduce the interval

433
00:27:36,780 --> 00:27:39,560
So maybe like 0．1

434
00:27:40,280 --> 00:27:42,460
So the steps can be just one

435
00:27:42,460 --> 00:27:45,040
So it's incrementing from one to 2

436
00:27:45,040 --> 00:27:45,860
34

437
00:27:46,430 --> 00:27:47,800
And in the end

438
00:27:47,800 --> 00:27:50,940
you should reach the value of 60 here

439
00:27:51,550 --> 00:27:52,750
And then by the end

440
00:27:52,760 --> 00:27:53,980
we don't want to restart it

441
00:27:54,310 --> 00:27:57,980
We just want to stop there variable

442
00:28:00,280 --> 00:28:04,400
Okayand then to trigger this event

443
00:28:04,410 --> 00:28:11,410
we head back over to our button here and choose the events topic here

444
00:28:11,420 --> 00:28:14,090
And then we will actually create a new action

445
00:28:14,870 --> 00:28:17,130
which is a variable control

446
00:28:19,320 --> 00:28:20,030
And here

447
00:28:20,030 --> 00:28:22,840
we're actually going to choose a display​‌​‌​​‌‌​​‌‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌​​‌‌​​‌‌​​‌‌​​‌‌​​‌‌​‌​‌‌‌​‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌​‌​‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌​‌‌​​​‌‌‌‌‌‌​​‌‌‌​​‌‌‌​‌​‌​‌​​‌‌‌​‌‌​​‌‌​​​‌​​‌‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌‌​‌‌​​‌‌‌​​‌​​‌‌​​​‌​​‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌​‌​‌​​‌‌​‌​‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌‌‌‌​​​‌‌‌​‌‌​​‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌​​‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌​‌‌​​​‌‌​​‌‌​​‌‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌​‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌​​​‌‌‌​​‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌​‌‌‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌‌​​‌‌‌​‌​‌‌‌​​‌‌‌​​‌‌‌​‌‌​​‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌​​​‌‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌​​​‌​​‌‌​​‌‌​​‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌​‌‌‌​​‌‌‌‌‌​​​‌‌​‌‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌​‌‌​​‌‌​‌​‌‌‌​‌​‌‌‌​​‌‌​‌​‌​​‌‌​‌‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌​‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌​‌‌​​​‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌​​‌‌​‌​‌‌‌​‌​‌​‌​​‌‌​‌‌‌‌‌​‌​‌​‌​​‌‌​‌​‌​​‌‌​‌​‌‌‌​‌‌​​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌‌​​‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌​​‌‌‌​​‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌​‌‌‌​​‌‌‌​​‌‌‌​‌​‌‌‌‌‌​‌​‌‌‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌​​‌​​‌‌‌‌‌​​​‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌​‌‌​​‌‌​​‌‌​​‌‌​‌​‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌​‌​‌‌‌​‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌​​​‌​​‌‌‌​​‌​​‌‌‌‌‌‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌​‌‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌​​​‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌​​‌​​‌‌​‌​‌‌‌​‌​‌‌‌​​‌‌​‌‌​​​‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌​‌‌‌​​‌‌‌‌‌​​​‌‌​‌​‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌‌​​‌‌‌​‌​‌‌‌‌‌​‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌‌​​‌‌‌‌‌‌​​‌‌​‌‌‌​​‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌‌​​‌​​‌‌​​‌‌​​‌‌‌​​‌​​‌‌‌​​‌​​‌‌​‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌ count

448
00:28:23,770 --> 00:28:29,930
And we just want to let it play with the delay of 0 now

449
00:28:31,610 --> 00:28:34,010
And now if we simulate again

450
00:28:35,830 --> 00:28:39,500
nothing happens because we didn't choose the value here

451
00:28:39,500 --> 00:28:43,210
So you can head over back to the counter value

452
00:28:43,210 --> 00:28:48,920
and then you have to choose actually this display count value by the text content

453
00:28:49,610 --> 00:28:52,100
And now if you simulate again

454
00:28:52,120 --> 00:28:56,820
you now see that the counter is getting started while pressing the button here

455
00:28:57,880 --> 00:29:01,080
And then it reaches the values of 60

456
00:29:01,170 --> 00:29:01,610
So

457
00:29:01,610 --> 00:29:07,180
and then what I can also do now is that we can maybe

458
00:29:07,190 --> 00:29:10,220
if the stopwatch is starting

459
00:29:10,220 --> 00:29:20,570
we can actually change the light ring here to maybe like a green or something that's visualize visualizing that the counter has started

460
00:29:20,650 --> 00:29:28,040
And then we can also do a color of red for the light ring if it finishes 60 seconds

461
00:29:29,360 --> 00:29:31,070
And to do so

462
00:29:31,760 --> 00:29:37,920
we will head over here to our light ring and introduce two new states

463
00:29:38,790 --> 00:29:40,440
So now we have the base state

464
00:29:40,450 --> 00:29:43,550
the second state or the primary state

465
00:29:43,560 --> 00:29:44,800
and the state 2

466
00:29:45,310 --> 00:29:47,990
I will just rename it if as the base date

467
00:29:50,740 --> 00:29:53,340
Maybe green state

468
00:29:55,800 --> 00:29:57,120
And red state

469
00:29:59,740 --> 00:30:01,660
Soand in the green stage

470
00:30:02,770 --> 00:30:05,110
​‌​‌​​‌‌​​‌‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌​​‌‌​​‌‌​​‌‌​​‌‌​​‌‌​‌​‌‌‌​‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌​‌​‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌​‌‌​​​‌‌‌‌‌‌​​‌‌‌​​‌‌‌​‌​‌​‌​​‌‌‌​‌‌​​‌‌​​​‌​​‌‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌‌​‌‌​​‌‌‌​​‌​​‌‌​​​‌​​‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌​‌​‌​​‌‌​‌​‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌‌‌‌​​​‌‌‌​‌‌​​‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌​​‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌​‌‌​​​‌‌​​‌‌​​‌‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌​‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌​​​‌‌‌​​‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌​‌‌‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌‌​​‌‌‌​‌​‌‌‌​​‌‌‌​​‌‌‌​‌‌​​‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌​​​‌‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌​​​‌​​‌‌​​‌‌​​‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌​‌‌‌​​‌‌‌‌‌​​​‌‌​‌‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌​‌‌​​‌‌​‌​‌‌‌​‌​‌‌‌​​‌‌​‌​‌​​‌‌​‌‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌​‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌​‌‌​​​‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌​​‌‌​‌​‌‌‌​‌​‌​‌​​‌‌​‌‌‌‌‌​‌​‌​‌​​‌‌​‌​‌​​‌‌​‌​‌‌‌​‌‌​​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌‌​​‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌​​‌‌‌​​‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌​‌‌‌​​‌‌‌​​‌‌‌​‌​‌‌‌‌‌​‌​‌‌‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌​​‌​​‌‌‌‌‌​​​‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌​‌‌​​‌‌​​‌‌​​‌‌​‌​‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌​‌​‌‌‌​‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌​​​‌​​‌‌‌​​‌​​‌‌‌‌‌‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌​‌‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌​​​‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌​​‌​​‌‌​‌​‌‌‌​‌​‌‌‌​​‌‌​‌‌​​​‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌​‌‌‌​​‌‌‌‌‌​​​‌‌​‌​‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌‌​​‌‌‌​‌​‌‌‌‌‌​‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌‌​​‌‌‌‌‌‌​​‌‌​‌‌‌​​‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌‌​​‌​​‌‌​​‌‌​​‌‌‌​​‌​​‌‌‌​​‌​​‌‌​‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌I actually want the color to be green

471
00:30:05,110 --> 00:30:12,940
So I will head over back to the material topic here and I will change the color to green here

472
00:30:12,960 --> 00:30:15,950
So maybe a light green to dark green

473
00:30:17,910 --> 00:30:21,740
And I would also do this for the red state here

474
00:30:22,730 --> 00:30:23,060
Again

475
00:30:23,060 --> 00:30:29,760
go to the dev property here and then change it to a light red

476
00:30:30,950 --> 00:30:33,700
which fades in darker red

477
00:30:35,600 --> 00:30:38,030
And now if you swap in between the states

478
00:30:38,290 --> 00:30:39,830
so now by default

479
00:30:39,880 --> 00:30:41,900
you have the orange state state

480
00:30:41,900 --> 00:30:42,800
the green state

481
00:30:42,800 --> 00:30:44,020
and the red state

482
00:30:46,290 --> 00:30:50,940
Soand then actually we will head over back to our button now

483
00:30:51,990 --> 00:30:55,020
And we can introduce another state here

484
00:30:55,030 --> 00:30:58,780
So another event which is triggered by the button here

485
00:30:58,830 --> 00:31:05,410
So we have the moving transition button and also the variable control event

486
00:31:05,550 --> 00:31:08,050
And now we will just make a transition now

487
00:31:08,420 --> 00:31:10,360
So when starting

488
00:31:11,140 --> 00:31:15,330
we want the light ring actually

489
00:31:15,340 --> 00:31:16,490
So for the target

490
00:31:16,500 --> 00:31:22,890
the light ring we want to get from the base date to the green state

491
00:31:23,190 --> 00:31:29,060
So the clock is activated and we want to do this immediately

492
00:31:30,820 --> 00:31:33,930
Soand now if you simulate again

493
00:31:34,220 --> 00:31:34,500
you know

494
00:31:34,590 --> 00:31:36,420
see when the clock is started

495
00:31:36,420 --> 00:31:40,910
now that the color is changing from orange to green

496
00:31:41,730 --> 00:31:45,260
And now we actually also want that if it hits

497
00:31:45,420 --> 00:31:47,430
if it hits the value of 60

498
00:31:47,430 --> 00:31:52,020
now we finish the clock and the color should change to red

499
00:31:53,860 --> 00:31:55,230
And to do this

500
00:31:55,260 --> 00:32:01,370
we will just head over to the light ring here and introduce a new event

501
00:32:03,360 --> 00:32:04,730
And this event

502
00:32:04,860 --> 00:32:08,320
againis triggered by a variable change

503
00:32:08,330 --> 00:32:10,240
so not again by a mouse click

504
00:32:10,270 --> 00:32:11,680
but a variable change

505
00:32:12,340 --> 00:32:14,040
And for this variable change

506
00:32:14,040 --> 00:32:17,150
we will use the display count variable

507
00:32:18,770 --> 00:32:30,190
Soand we will then introduce conditional statement here and this condition

508
00:32:30,190 --> 00:32:30,710
So again

509
00:32:30,710 --> 00:32:33,260
we have an if an else statement here

510
00:32:33,850 --> 00:32:34,970
and we want that

511
00:32:37,300 --> 00:32:38,890
The display count value

512
00:32:38,900 --> 00:32:44,760
if this count value is bigger than 59

513
00:32:47,220 --> 00:32:50,090
We actually want to trigger a transition now

514
00:32:50,870 --> 00:32:52,890
And this transition now

515
00:32:53,150 --> 00:32:55,340
againthe target is still the light ring

516
00:32:56,410 --> 00:33:03,100
And we want here to do a transition from the green state to the red state

517
00:33:03,120 --> 00:33:06,470
And also we will do it immediately

518
00:33:07,610 --> 00:33:08,340
So again

519
00:33:10,310 --> 00:33:12,790
triggers every time a variable is changed

520
00:33:13,310 --> 00:33:14,620
a variable is changing

521
00:33:14,620 --> 00:33:15,510
So for example

522
00:33:15,510 --> 00:33:17,540
if it changes from 0 to 1

523
00:33:17,540 --> 00:33:20,540
this event is triggered and so on

524
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:26,000
And then we will ask if this display count value is bigger than 60

525
00:33:26,680 --> 00:33:31,560
And then we will actually do a transition from the green state in the red state

526
00:33:32,550 --> 00:33:36,170
And then we have finished the clock

527
00:33:38,040 --> 00:33:38,790
So again

528
00:33:39,620 --> 00:33:40,940
when I simulate now

529
00:33:41,860 --> 00:33:45,260
and now when it's it reaches 60

530
00:33:45,260 --> 00:33:48,700
now we get in the third transition end

531
00:33:48,990 --> 00:33:51,160
the clock is getting red

532
00:33:52,830 --> 00:33:53,720
okay

533
00:33:53,890 --> 00:33:54,300
So

534
00:33:54,300 --> 00:33:57,930
and what you can also do for a better looking here

535
00:33:58,060 --> 00:34:03,600
and what I personally also like to do a lot is adding a little bloom effect

536
00:34:03,610 --> 00:34:09,550
especially when you're using or you're trying to build some display mode or something

537
00:34:09,550 --> 00:34:10,680
some digital stuff

538
00:34:10,680 --> 00:34:16,600
So it's get the shape is getting more blurry around some brighter modules

539
00:34:17,020 --> 00:34:17,960
brighter colors here

540
00:34:18,580 --> 00:34:20,030
So for example

541
00:34:20,140 --> 00:34:25,110
if I activate now the blue mode and increase it here

542
00:34:25,260 --> 00:34:26,610
maybe do some large

543
00:34:27,790 --> 00:34:29,040
So you actually

544
00:34:29,050 --> 00:34:31,360
I will just increased intensity here

545
00:34:31,360 --> 00:34:34,410
Now you see what the bloom effect actually does

546
00:34:34,970 --> 00:34:38,130
but that's way too much bloom effect

547
00:34:40,970 --> 00:34:41,910
So I will keep it

548
00:34:41,910 --> 00:34:43,860
It maybe like this

549
00:34:46,370 --> 00:34:50,790
And maybe reduce the threshold here a little bit

550
00:34:52,320 --> 00:34:54,090
increases the threshold

551
00:34:55,220 --> 00:34:57,700
can also do some smoothing

552
00:35:00,680 --> 00:35:08,230
And now you see actually that this digital display actually has some like white contour around it

553
00:35:08,230 --> 00:35:09,460
some blurry contour

554
00:35:10,190 --> 00:35:14,540
And this is what you also see in We Live on This Place

555
00:35:15,860 --> 00:35:21,000
So this is a little nice effect that you can add just for the looking now

556
00:35:21,380 --> 00:35:26,850
So you have some break of the transition topics and so on

557
00:35:28,300 --> 00:35:28,850
So

558
00:35:28,860 --> 00:35:36,080
and maybe what we can also do now is like in the previous explanation of the variables

559
00:35:36,300 --> 00:35:39,110
you can actually make a little progress bar here

560
00:35:39,110 --> 00:35:45,650
So it also visualizes how far the clock is in time

561
00:35:46,940 --> 00:35:49,120
And to do so

562
00:35:49,190 --> 00:35:52,180
I will just align this view maybe here

563
00:35:53,140 --> 00:35:53,820
And again

564
00:35:53,820 --> 00:35:58,200
I could just duplicate the light ring here

565
00:35:59,720 --> 00:36:04,280
or maybe not because it has so much states already on it

566
00:36:04,580 --> 00:36:18,870
I will just duplicate the display ring here and then maybe make it a little bit bigger here and also remove the matte cap here

567
00:36:18,880 --> 00:36:21,860
Now you already have like a little white ring here

568
00:36:23,180 --> 00:36:26,970
and I will just resize it also

569
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:27,670
So again

570
00:36:27,670 --> 00:36:29,360
hold option and shift

571
00:36:31,470 --> 00:36:33,290
Then you can resize it

572
00:36:35,470 --> 00:36:37,410
Alsocheck around the edges here

573
00:36:37,410 --> 00:36:38,150
So it doesn't

574
00:36:39,390 --> 00:36:41,580
so it stays connected to the body

575
00:36:42,710 --> 00:36:43,400
And actually

576
00:36:43,400 --> 00:36:48,640
I don't really want an extrusion on this and also no bevel

577
00:36:49,860 --> 00:36:50,390
Oh no

578
00:36:50,400 --> 00:36:52,410
you have to again

579
00:36:52,890 --> 00:36:53,920
resize it

580
00:36:56,690 --> 00:36:58,030
Yeahmaybe like this

581
00:37:01,380 --> 00:37:04,870
And now you see it's still extruded here

582
00:37:06,010 --> 00:37:13,620
So just make it like this and move it a little bit inside here

583
00:37:16,690 --> 00:37:20,020
This looks great for now and it doesn't exceed

584
00:37:22,420 --> 00:37:23,990
And you or something

585
00:37:25,910 --> 00:37:28,570
So based on this

586
00:37:28,580 --> 00:37:34,270
we will rename it to display progress

587
00:37:37,710 --> 00:37:47,780
And then we can also just actually connect this value to the angle value to the display count

588
00:37:51,410 --> 00:37:54,050
And maybe we can not

589
00:37:58,500 --> 00:38:03,700
Soand then we actually have to connect this angle to a new variable

590
00:38:03,940 --> 00:38:06,600
So you could actually use this value

591
00:38:06,600 --> 00:38:10,380
but this value actually just goes from 0 to 60

592
00:38:10,620 --> 00:38:11,350
And again

593
00:38:11,350 --> 00:38:13,580
weto fill the full circle

594
00:38:13,580 --> 00:38:15,600
we need 360

595
00:38:15,600 --> 00:38:17,220
so 360 degrees

596
00:38:17,540 --> 00:38:20,970
And if we use this value from the display

597
00:38:20,970 --> 00:38:24,140
we only reach out 60 degrees

598
00:38:24,140 --> 00:38:26,250
And it's basically not enough

599
00:38:27,270 --> 00:38:28,530
And to do so

600
00:38:28,530 --> 00:38:31,920
we can just introduce another variable

601
00:38:32,500 --> 00:38:34,580
So click on the angle here

602
00:38:34,580 --> 00:38:38,650
and then we will create a new variable and this one

603
00:38:40,690 --> 00:38:41,980
We were also going to do it

604
00:38:44,560 --> 00:38:45,260
And then

605
00:38:45,760 --> 00:38:46,320
well

606
00:38:50,310 --> 00:38:51,800
Yeahbut yeah

607
00:38:51,840 --> 00:38:54,160
come on Phil

608
00:39:29,650 --> 00:39:30,160
So

609
00:39:30,160 --> 00:39:34,040
and then we select the display progress bar here

610
00:39:34,270 --> 00:39:38,680
We can maybe just actually change the color to more white here

611
00:39:39,420 --> 00:39:40,110
more white color

612
00:39:41,910 --> 00:39:44,620
And then we will introduce a new variable

613
00:39:44,620 --> 00:39:45,990
So select the angle

614
00:39:46,020 --> 00:39:47,100
little circle here

615
00:39:48,090 --> 00:39:57,610
and we will create a new counter value and then rename it to maybe like display progress

616
00:39:59,700 --> 00:40:01,570
And here in the preferences

617
00:40:01,570 --> 00:40:07,910
we actually have to change it to the end value of 360

618
00:40:09,390 --> 00:40:15,740
And you can imagine now that we have to increase the steps also

619
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:16,580
But first

620
00:40:16,580 --> 00:40:20,130
we're going to edit here the interval

621
00:40:20,290 --> 00:40:22,620
so also 0．1 seconds

622
00:40:22,750 --> 00:40:24,900
the same as the variable before

623
00:40:25,860 --> 00:40:29,980
But here we actually have to use 6 steps now

624
00:40:31,020 --> 00:40:34,840
So because 360 divided by 60 is 6

625
00:40:35,070 --> 00:40:36,360
to get on the same level

626
00:40:36,360 --> 00:40:41,100
the same counting level as the display text here

627
00:40:41,680 --> 00:40:52,790
And so that's a progress circle now also fits the timing model as same as text now here

628
00:40:56,830 --> 00:41:05,470
And then we will just connect the angle property here to the display progress variable

629
00:41:05,520 --> 00:41:06,160
So for now

630
00:41:06,160 --> 00:41:10,740
againit's disappeared because the initial value is 0 here

631
00:41:11,770 --> 00:41:18,020
And then we also have to trigger this variable by the button here

632
00:41:18,310 --> 00:41:26,140
So just head back over to the button now and go to the Events tab here

633
00:41:26,310 --> 00:41:26,880
And again

634
00:41:26,880 --> 00:41:32,140
we have to create a new action when the button is clicked

635
00:41:32,350 --> 00:41:33,680
And there

636
00:41:33,680 --> 00:41:36,350
we also have to do the variable control

637
00:41:37,320 --> 00:41:41,220
And then we will select the progress variable

638
00:41:41,990 --> 00:41:43,360
choose the play function

639
00:41:43,740 --> 00:41:44,480
and again

640
00:41:44,490 --> 00:41:45,700
without a delay

641
00:41:46,700 --> 00:41:49,090
And then if we simulate again

642
00:41:49,890 --> 00:41:52,060
we now see this little progress bar

643
00:41:53,720 --> 00:41:58,210
and now it should exactly fit

644
00:41:58,210 --> 00:42:03,350
Now we actually have to stop the simulation now

645
00:42:04,330 --> 00:42:07,210
So head back over to the display progress bar

646
00:42:09,850 --> 00:42:11,830
Choose the value here again

647
00:42:13,400 --> 00:42:17,900
And then we actually have to do to change this property on end

648
00:42:17,910 --> 00:42:19,400
It should not restart

649
00:42:20,040 --> 00:42:22,130
It should simply stop

650
00:42:23,420 --> 00:42:26,560
So now if you simulate again now

651
00:42:31,010 --> 00:42:31,930
And now actually

652
00:42:31,930 --> 00:42:42,790
the progress bar simultaneously reaches the end when also the other value actually hits the value of 60

653
00:42:49,020 --> 00:42:49,940
So for now

654
00:42:49,940 --> 00:42:52,850
this actually looks really good now

655
00:42:53,240 --> 00:42:56,720
but we will add some more details now

656
00:42:56,720 --> 00:43:06,540
So maybe we can also just add a feature where this progress bar actually is getting the color red while the clock is finishing

657
00:43:07,370 --> 00:43:08,450
So to do that

658
00:43:08,460 --> 00:43:13,500
we will head over to our display progress bar here

659
00:43:14,020 --> 00:43:17,190
and then we will introduce a new state here again

660
00:43:18,320 --> 00:43:19,580
And in the base state

661
00:43:19,580 --> 00:43:22,420
it just simply has a color white now

662
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:25,510
And if we go to the second state now

663
00:43:25,520 --> 00:43:28,290
we will make it red

664
00:43:30,100 --> 00:43:31,260
So and again

665
00:43:31,310 --> 00:43:35,750
if we hit this value on the light ring wizard

666
00:43:35,750 --> 00:43:36,230
I guess

667
00:43:36,240 --> 00:43:40,150
yeahso on the variable change function now

668
00:43:41,800 --> 00:43:49,870
and then we can just simply add a new transition here if the number is actually exceeding the 59 value

669
00:43:49,990 --> 00:43:50,900
And to do so

670
00:43:50,940 --> 00:43:52,650
we will just make a new transition

671
00:43:53,110 --> 00:43:57,870
And for the target now we will just choose the display progress bar here

672
00:43:58,340 --> 00:43:59,220
And then again

673
00:43:59,260 --> 00:44:02,400
we will change from the base state to the second state

674
00:44:02,940 --> 00:44:04,680
state to the second state

675
00:44:05,050 --> 00:44:05,950
and then again

676
00:44:05,960 --> 00:44:07,850
we will just just do it immediately

677
00:44:09,390 --> 00:44:11,150
And if you now simulate again

678
00:44:12,690 --> 00:44:18,150
you will see that this color we will now also be red

679
00:44:19,510 --> 00:44:22,300
We actually have some transition here in the background

680
00:44:22,300 --> 00:44:22,850
which I don't

681
00:44:25,740 --> 00:44:26,660
One2

682
00:44:32,720 --> 00:44:32,980
Oh yeah

683
00:44:32,990 --> 00:44:36,640
so we actually don't want this transition

684
00:44:36,660 --> 00:44:39,590
So it also should change immediately

685
00:44:40,260 --> 00:44:40,760
Now again

686
00:44:40,760 --> 00:44:45,000
just for a complete view now here

687
00:44:46,020 --> 00:44:49,060
so this color also changes immediately

688
00:44:51,290 --> 00:44:51,890
And yeah

689
00:44:51,920 --> 00:44:55,710
now we can also just add some little background here

690
00:44:55,710 --> 00:44:56,600
So we can

691
00:44:57,070 --> 00:44:59,000
or little nice design

692
00:44:59,250 --> 00:45:01,640
add as much details as you can

693
00:45:01,960 --> 00:45:05,860
And I will just put a little text here on it

694
00:45:06,780 --> 00:45:10,240
maybe like change

695
00:45:12,310 --> 00:45:13,000
The time

696
00:45:15,070 --> 00:45:16,670
And then just center it

697
00:45:18,550 --> 00:45:22,850
Actually move it to the center here now

698
00:45:23,470 --> 00:45:26,520
And then increase the font size

699
00:45:28,140 --> 00:45:28,560
Okaylike that

700
00:45:35,470 --> 00:45:40,830
And then I will also add some more details here to have a much more complete design here

701
00:45:41,150 --> 00:45:44,600
So maybe like a background text here

702
00:45:45,290 --> 00:45:52,280
change the time and I will make it a little bit bigger here

703
00:45:56,060 --> 00:45:58,670
And then increasing the font size

704
00:45:59,700 --> 00:46:09,760
So maybe also over over the slider values and maybe like 160 or 180

705
00:46:10,460 --> 00:46:11,630
Yeahlike that

706
00:46:12,140 --> 00:46:17,820
And then I will also change the horizontal and the vertical alignment here

707
00:46:20,200 --> 00:46:24,060
Soand then also pull it here in the background

708
00:46:25,600 --> 00:46:28,240
You can also give it some extrusion here

709
00:46:28,530 --> 00:46:30,140
maybe here like that

710
00:46:33,140 --> 00:46:35,400
Then you have a little nice background here

711
00:46:35,400 --> 00:46:38,040
Maybe you can also increase the weight here

712
00:46:39,810 --> 00:46:42,840
maybe like semi boat or something

713
00:46:45,190 --> 00:46:45,950
Mediumyeah

714
00:46:45,950 --> 00:46:46,880
like that

715
00:46:50,050 --> 00:46:50,460
I actually

716
00:46:53,520 --> 00:46:55,800
Maybe I make it even bigger

717
00:46:58,550 --> 00:46:58,760
So

718
00:47:01,640 --> 00:47:01,700
So

719
00:47:11,570 --> 00:47:12,600
Like 240

720
00:47:31,070 --> 00:47:34,720
I will actually just insert some white spaces here

721
00:47:35,070 --> 00:47:38,570
So it actually has a gap around the clock

722
00:47:45,950 --> 00:47:46,320
Like that

723
00:47:47,810 --> 00:47:48,950
Put it up here a little bit

724
00:47:50,240 --> 00:47:50,730
Maybe even more

725
00:47:50,730 --> 00:47:52,250
More wet space

726
00:47:54,420 --> 00:47:56,200
Want to do​‌​‌​​‌‌​​‌‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌​​‌‌​​‌‌​​‌‌​​‌‌​​‌‌​‌​‌‌‌​‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌​‌​‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌​‌‌​​​‌‌‌‌‌‌​​‌‌‌​​‌‌‌​‌​‌​‌​​‌‌‌​‌‌​​‌‌​​​‌​​‌‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌‌​‌‌​​‌‌‌​​‌​​‌‌​​​‌​​‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌​‌​‌​​‌‌​‌​‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌‌‌‌​​​‌‌‌​‌‌​​‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌​​‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌​‌‌​​​‌‌​​‌‌​​‌‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌​‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌​​​‌‌‌​​‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌​‌‌‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌‌​​‌‌‌​‌​‌‌‌​​‌‌‌​​‌‌‌​‌‌​​‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌​​​‌‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌​​​‌​​‌‌​​‌‌​​‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌​‌‌‌​​‌‌‌‌‌​​​‌‌​‌‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌​‌‌​​‌‌​‌​‌‌‌​‌​‌‌‌​​‌‌​‌​‌​​‌‌​‌‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌​‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌​‌‌​​​‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌​​‌‌​‌​‌‌‌​‌​‌​‌​​‌‌​‌‌‌‌‌​‌​‌​‌​​‌‌​‌​‌​​‌‌​‌​‌‌‌​‌‌​​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌‌​​‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌​​‌‌‌​​‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌​‌‌‌​​‌‌‌​​‌‌‌​‌​‌‌‌‌‌​‌​‌‌‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌​​‌​​‌‌‌‌‌​​​‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌​‌‌​​‌‌​​‌‌​​‌‌​‌​‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌​‌​‌‌‌​‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌​​​‌​​‌‌‌​​‌​​‌‌‌‌‌‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌​‌‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌​​​‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌​​‌​​‌‌​‌​‌‌‌​‌​‌‌‌​​‌‌​‌‌​​​‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌​‌‌‌​​‌‌‌‌‌​​​‌‌​‌​‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌‌​​‌‌‌​‌​‌‌‌‌‌​‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌‌​​‌‌‌‌‌‌​​‌‌​‌‌‌​​‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌‌​​‌​​‌‌​​‌‌​​‌‌‌​​‌​​‌‌‌​​‌​​‌‌​‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌ more

727
00:47:56,440 --> 00:47:57,410
Okaynice

728
00:47:58,720 --> 00:48:03,060
And then bring it to the center here now

729
00:48:07,530 --> 00:48:08,800
Yeahmaybe like that

730
00:48:10,830 --> 00:48:14,580
And then for a better contrast to the background

731
00:48:14,580 --> 00:48:19,550
we can actually make a little point light source in the background

732
00:48:24,190 --> 00:48:24,890
Get from above

733
00:48:25,070 --> 00:48:25,830
maybe

734
00:48:27,470 --> 00:48:28,850
So right to the back now

735
00:48:29,990 --> 00:48:31,400
And then when you simulate

736
00:48:32,390 --> 00:48:39,550
you have a little nice lightning from the back will actually make the extrusion also a little bit bigger

737
00:48:41,630 --> 00:48:42,410
Maybe like that

738
00:48:43,650 --> 00:48:46,390
And then also change it to a little bit darker

739
00:48:52,570 --> 00:48:57,250
But I can also now make the intensity a little bit stronger

740
00:48:57,250 --> 00:48:58,510
So click on the point light

741
00:48:58,520 --> 00:48:58,560
you know

742
00:48:58,570 --> 00:48:59,300
and maybe

743
00:49:03,100 --> 00:49:06,010
Like the density a bit more

744
00:49:07,520 --> 00:49:09,240
Now we knew hover around

745
00:49:09,320 --> 00:49:09,550
you know

746
00:49:09,620 --> 00:49:15,540
see a little nice shiny edge around around the font

747
00:49:17,880 --> 00:49:20,620
And to make it a little bit more color specific

748
00:49:20,630 --> 00:49:26,100
now we can also add a point light maybe to the front of the clock

749
00:49:28,260 --> 00:49:35,980
So pull up your point light here and maybe with like here or something

750
00:49:39,030 --> 00:49:41,800
And in the initial stage

751
00:49:42,500 --> 00:49:44,490
we will make it orange

752
00:49:46,060 --> 00:49:47,050
So maybe like that

753
00:49:47,080 --> 00:49:49,580
Now you see a little bit of the color here

754
00:49:49,580 --> 00:49:52,020
Also reflecting on the font

755
00:49:53,000 --> 00:49:54,320
it's looking pretty good

756
00:49:55,230 --> 00:50:00,670
And what I actually will make this fun color a little bit more darker

757
00:50:02,670 --> 00:50:04,150
yesor maybe like this

758
00:50:05,630 --> 00:50:05,890
Okay

759
00:50:06,010 --> 00:50:08,240
then head back over to the point light here

760
00:50:09,930 --> 00:50:11,700
I will quickly rename it

761
00:50:11,700 --> 00:50:16,330
So maybe like color point light

762
00:50:18,270 --> 00:50:18,720
Okay

763
00:50:20,280 --> 00:50:24,900
and then we will also introduce 3 new states here

764
00:50:25,800 --> 00:50:26,460
So again

765
00:50:26,460 --> 00:50:27,530
we have the base state

766
00:50:27,540 --> 00:50:28,390
the second state

767
00:50:28,400 --> 00:50:29,990
and the state 2 here

768
00:50:30,150 --> 00:50:36,350
And now you can already think about it that we will just make the same colors for the light

769
00:50:36,360 --> 00:50:41,800
So initially we have the orange light and we will change to green light

770
00:50:41,870 --> 00:50:43,410
And then if the clock is finished

771
00:50:43,740 --> 00:50:45,440
we will change to a red light here

772
00:50:46,350 --> 00:50:46,980
So again

773
00:50:47,870 --> 00:50:54,330
we will head to the second stage here and make a green light here

774
00:50:54,580 --> 00:50:56,820
maybe like like this

775
00:50:58,090 --> 00:50:59,940
And now for the red state

776
00:51:01,730 --> 00:51:03,000
a red light

777
00:51:04,900 --> 00:51:07,340
we have all stayed set here

778
00:51:07,340 --> 00:51:08,980
So we have the orange light

779
00:51:08,990 --> 00:51:09,870
the green light

780
00:51:09,940 --> 00:51:11,000
the red light

781
00:51:11,650 --> 00:51:12,680
and then again

782
00:51:12,680 --> 00:51:16,290
we will trigger these states now by an event

783
00:51:17,260 --> 00:51:19,730
So for the first event

784
00:51:19,730 --> 00:51:27,460
we will just simply go back to our button here and we will also introduce it here to the miles down event

785
00:51:27,510 --> 00:51:28,120
So again

786
00:51:28,120 --> 00:51:30,080
just do and we transition

787
00:51:30,870 --> 00:51:32,640
And for the target here

788
00:51:32,640 --> 00:51:35,020
we will choose the color point light now

789
00:51:36,380 --> 00:51:44,060
And we will go toggle it once only and then again with no delays or do it immediately

790
00:51:44,550 --> 00:51:49,370
And we will change from the base stage to the stage

791
00:51:49,380 --> 00:51:51,240
So the second stage here

792
00:51:53,320 --> 00:51:56,360
And if we just check it over now real quick

793
00:51:56,370 --> 00:51:58,970
we now see that the color is also getting green

794
00:52:00,010 --> 00:52:02,210
So the transition works now

795
00:52:04,190 --> 00:52:07,170
And then for the red light

796
00:52:08,010 --> 00:52:10,350
we will head back over to our light ring

797
00:52:10,640 --> 00:52:11,000
I guess

798
00:52:11,000 --> 00:52:14,730
Yeahwe will declare where we declared the variable change

799
00:52:15,770 --> 00:52:16,950
and then again

800
00:52:17,440 --> 00:52:19,950
we will just add it to the conditional event

801
00:52:19,950 --> 00:52:23,660
So when the value exceeds the 59 value

802
00:52:24,140 --> 00:52:26,450
we will do a new transition here

803
00:52:27,460 --> 00:52:29,450
Also choose a color point light

804
00:52:30,620 --> 00:52:31,150
And again

805
00:52:31,150 --> 00:52:35,110
we will do a transition from the base state to the Ana

806
00:52:35,110 --> 00:52:41,310
We will do actually the transition from the state to the state 2

807
00:52:41,450 --> 00:52:42,270
and again

808
00:52:42,970 --> 00:52:44,760
we will do it immediately

809
00:52:46,300 --> 00:52:48,090
So now we simulate again

810
00:52:50,780 --> 00:52:53,880
Actuallythe color should change of the whole scene to the red

811
00:52:58,260 --> 00:53:02,460
It so this looks pretty nice

812
00:53:02,460 --> 00:53:12,400
Now I will actually just make the light a little bit smoother because I actually think that the intensity is maybe a little bit too high

813
00:53:12,530 --> 00:53:16,020
So maybe like 0．55

814
00:53:17,540 --> 00:53:18,200
You also and you also

815
00:53:19,790 --> 00:53:20,250
okay

816
00:53:24,260 --> 00:53:25,740
Soand then if you simulate

817
00:53:25,740 --> 00:53:28,430
now you actually see the result here

818
00:53:28,730 --> 00:53:32,510
So maybe I will some little adaptions

819
00:53:32,510 --> 00:53:32,790
you know

820
00:53:32,960 --> 00:53:36,140
So maybe a little bit more extrusion on the text

821
00:53:39,170 --> 00:53:39,960
And actually

822
00:53:40,120 --> 00:53:43,710
I will just quickly rename it to the background light here

823
00:53:45,720 --> 00:53:49,410
You can also reduce a little bit the intensity here

824
00:53:51,490 --> 00:53:52,580
And then if you simulate

825
00:53:52,700 --> 00:53:57,800
againyou have this nice little stopwatch here

826
00:53:59,400 --> 00:54:01,740
Soand also maybe you can again

827
00:54:01,750 --> 00:54:04,160
just make like some little adaptions here

828
00:54:04,160 --> 00:54:04,870
So for example

829
00:54:04,910 --> 00:54:09,300
you can maybe change the material a little bit

830
00:54:09,300 --> 00:54:10,720
So for instance

831
00:54:10,720 --> 00:54:20,890
you could also make an overlay with the Fresnel so it it looks a little bit more darker and you can also reduce the lightning effect a little bit

832
00:54:24,050 --> 00:54:24,640
And yeah

833
00:54:24,640 --> 00:54:26,810
you can be creative as you want here

834
00:54:27,700 --> 00:54:31,200
Maybe you can also change the color a little bit

835
00:54:56,240 --> 00:54:59,040
So I think this actually looks quite nice

836
00:54:59,040 --> 00:55:00,980
So let me know what you think about it

837
00:55:01,300 --> 00:55:10,450
This is a really nice little project which introduces you to state in events and variable control and also conditional logic

838
00:55:10,650 --> 00:55:14,710
And you can imagine now that you can be creative as you want to

839
00:55:14,710 --> 00:55:21,960
You have endless possibilities to do with those things you learn now from the past topics

840
00:55:21,970 --> 00:55:29,790
and I am happy to see all the projects that you guys will do is this knowledge

841
00:55:31,300 --> 00:55:32,220
and then we will

842
00:55:33,550 --> 00:55:35,770
and then I will see you again in the next course
