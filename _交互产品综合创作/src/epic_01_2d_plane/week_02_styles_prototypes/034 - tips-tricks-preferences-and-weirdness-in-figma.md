Okay, it's time for a little interlude of exciting tips and tricks and preferences and weirdness. That's kind of the name of this video. We're going to do it with just, we're going to go back to our low-fi because we've got more stuff to do tips and tricks with. Okay, so I feel you're at a point now where actually some workflow stuff will actually, will actually not freak you out, but actually help you out. So, let's go through a few of them.

### [00:27] 讲者
Now, in terms of all the shortcuts, you can kind of find them by hovering over some of them. Lots of them are hidden though. See this little question mark down here? I hope it's still here. Okay, if you click on this, like help and resources, we've all been conditioned by early software that built-in help and resources is like useless and should be avoided. But in Figma it's really good. So click in here, and I'm going to go to the shortcuts one. Okay, they've got great stuff. Okay, with the shortcut one is really useful, and nicely laid out. So, the essentials, there we go. Okay, I'm not going to run through them all. I just want to show you, just have a little look through and go, "Okay, there's that one. Okay, there's that one, view." Okay, all these ones, how to access the layers panel, jumping from assets, design, prototype. We've been doing that a bit, going between here and here. You might go, "Okay, that's me." That's Alt or Option 9. Okay, so just work through, there's some really good ones. I'll cover the main ones throughout this course, but there are some nice ones in there. So, let's go Option 9 on mine, and Option 8. Design, prototype, design, prototype. Okay, so a little helpful thing down there.

### [01:32] 讲者
Another really useful shortcut is the shortcut that rules them all. Okay, hold down Command on a Mac, Control on a PC, and hit your forward slash. There are two slashes, one of them goes forward, one of them goes backwards. So the forward slash brings up this. You're like, "What is that?" Basically, it's going to look through everything Figma can do if you can type it and spell it okay. So remember before I was changing the color, where I wanted to select all the same fill? So if I selected that, I kind of did that flippantly when we were doing commenting, right? You're like, "Where is that again?" What you do is, I don't go and find, I know where most of them are, okay, but this is, I'm doing this for your benefit because this is a really awkward way of doing it. It's all about the shortcuts, at least for me anyway. So I can click on this and go Command, forward slash, and I can say "select". I've just typed in S-E-L-E, I don't even have to spell very well. I can see "Select all with same fill". Then go and change the color. I find that super useful. Okay, instead of having to figure out where is it? Is it under Edit? Was it under Edit? I don't select, is it under View? Okay, so just type it out. If I want this all to be uppercase, I'm just going to go Command, forward slash, and I'm going to go "upper". There you go, uppercase. Boom. I don't have to do anything. I don't have to go find it. It's in there. It's over here somewhere as well. But I use that Command forward slash all of the time.

### [02:50] 讲者
Alright, another handy thing which we haven't really covered is right-clicking. Okay, so if you go into here, right-clicking will actually show you stuff relative to what you've got selected. You can see this will change depending on what you've got selected. Okay, and there's just helpful bits and pieces that relate to what you're doing. Bring forward instead of all the way front. You can see the shortcut, but you can just click it here. You can move it to another page. So right-clicking stuff will give you lots of interesting things related to the object you've clicked. Okay, right-clicking, you know how to right-click. It's on my list here.

### [03:19] 讲者
Preferences. There's only a couple that I would change, up to you. Okay, so I'm going to go to, I have no idea where preferences are. So we're going to use our Command forward slash and type in "preferences". Of course, it's not the one in there. Okay, where are my preferences? I bet you they're under Edit. No, they're under File. Please hold. There they are down the bottom here. There's not many in this program. Okay, so the one that I change is "Keep tool selected after use". I turn that on. It's off by default. Okay, it just means that whenever I grab my rectangle tool before and I dragged it, it went back to the selection tool. Then I had to go back to my rectangle tool. To pick a tool and it stay around. Up to you. The only other thing I go and mess with in here is under Preferences and the Nudge amount. Okay, so small nudge just means, a nudge is this. When I grab that rectangle, let's say I'm working on this, I'm going to use my sweet shortcut, Shift 2. Shift 2 is, we did Shift 1, everything that is on this entire frame or page, sorry. And if I've got something selected, Shift 2 zooms right into it. Anyway, what were we here? Nudging. So I've got these two in a group. Nudging just means it's going to go one pixel at a time. And that's probably fine. Okay, unless I'm dealing with my eight, remember we did our app design and we're dealing with eight, our 8-point grid. You'll remember it, that layout grid, and we did eight points when we were doing app design. So it could be really nice to go into here and say Preferences, Nudge amount, actually the big nudge is not 10, it's 8. That's useful because it means that I can get it to here and be nudging in points of eight. Only useful when you're developing apps.

### [05:14] 讲者
Alright, a little bit not super exciting that one, but let's have a look at, we've got these groups. I know that that is inside of there. Okay, and I know I can double-click them to get inside. A nice shortcut, okay, is to be holding down the Command key on a Mac, Control key on a PC, and just click on it once. And you see it just dives straight in, rather than having to go click, double-click. Okay, and when you've got lots of things kind of grouped, let's say that you decide to group this, using normal group, then I'm going to group it with that. You've got groups with groups with groups. Okay, you have to double-click, double-click. Okay, you can just hold down the Command key. Instead of trying to figure out all of this, I can grab this line by just holding down Command and clicking once. I've got straight in there. It's Control on a PC.

### [06:06] 讲者
Okay, those are my shortcuts that I use. There's a few more I'll introduce in the class. But really that Command forward slash and then just typing things in. Look, it's even got the ones that I've used last, which is nice. And this little help thing down here and checking on the shortcuts is kind of, I'm teaching you how to fish, that's what I'm trying to do. That's what I'm trying to say, instead of teaching each individual one. Let's also cover a few weird things in Figma just so they might be catching you out already or maybe in the future. Let's say if you do have a frame, is this weird? No, this is just a regular. This is a group, you can go up here and say, "Actually, I want all the extra stuff for a frame." Okay, if you have got groups everywhere and you want to move to using frame features, you can just switch it over here. Things that are weird is if your name appears above a frame, okay, it's called Frame 1. If I end up putting it up here, where am I going to put it? I'm going to put it just outside of everything. There you go. So if you end up with names everywhere, it's because this frame, even though it looks like it's in Homepage, it's not. It's hanging out by himself. You've got to make sure he goes in there. Alright, so that is it for my tips, tricks, preferences, and a little bit of weirdness there at the end. Alright, I'll see you in the next video.

## 重点整理（第一人称视角）
我从这个视频中学到了几个非常实用的 Figma 工作流技巧：

1.  **查找快捷键**：Figma 的所有快捷键都可以在右下角的问号图标（帮助与资源）里的“键盘快捷键”中找到。这是一个分类清晰的列表，我可以随时查阅，特别是切换设计（Option/Alt + 8）和原型（Option/Alt + 9）模式的快捷键非常方便。

2.  **万能搜索命令**：`Command + /` (Mac) 或 `Control + /` (PC) 是一个“万能”快捷键。它能打开一个搜索框，让我直接输入命令来执行操作，比如“选择所有相同填充”或将文本“转换为大写”，而不需要在菜单里到处找，这极大地提升了我的工作效率。

3.  **直接选择嵌套元素**：当处理复杂的嵌套分组时，我可以按住 `Command` (Mac) 或 `Control` (PC) 键，然后直接单击任何深层嵌套的对象来选中它，避免了烦人的连续双击。

4.  **调整首选项**：我可以根据自己的习惯调整一些首选项。例如，勾选“使用后保持选中工具”，这样画完一个矩形后，矩形工具仍然是激活状态。另一个重要的设置是“微调距离”（Nudge Amount），我可以将“大步微调”的距离从默认的 10px 改为 8px，以更好地适应 8 点网格系统。

5.  **处理“怪异”现象**：如果画布上出现了元素的名称标签（如 Frame 1），这通常意味着这个框架或组没有被正确地放置在顶层画板内。我只需要在图层面板中把它拖拽到对应的画板里，标签就会消失。

## 关键术语和人物
- **Figma**：一款基于云端的协作式 UI/UX 设计工具，用于创建、测试和交付更好的设计。
- **Low-fi (Low Fidelity)**：低保真原型，指设计的早期阶段，通常只包含基本的布局、线框和结构，用于快速验证概念和流程。
- **Nudge Amount (微调距离)**：在 Figma 中使用方向键移动对象时的距离。分为“小步微调”（默认 1px）和按住 Shift 的“大步微调”（默认 10px）。
- **8-point grid (8点网格系统)**：一种设计规范，要求界面中所有元素的尺寸和间距都是 8 的倍数，以确保视觉上的一致性和协调性。

## 图像补充信息
- **键盘快捷键面板**：视频 [00:49] 处，讲者点击右下角的问号图标，选择了“Keyboard shortcuts”。屏幕底部弹出一个黑色的面板，上面用标签页（Essentials, Tools, View 等）分类列出了所有可用的键盘快捷键及其对应的按键组合。
- **万能搜索框**：视频 [01:43] 处，讲者按下 `Cmd + /` 后，屏幕中央出现一个搜索框，提示“Search menus, commands, and plugins”。他通过输入关键词，快速找到了“Select all with same fill”等命令。
- **Nudge Amount 设置**：视频 [04:05] 处，讲者打开了“Nudge amount”设置弹窗。弹窗中有两个输入框：“Small nudge”（小步微调）和“Big nudge”（大步微调），他将“Big nudge”的值从 10 修改为 8。
- **Frame 与 Group 的切换**：视频 [06:36] 处，在 Figma 右侧的设计面板中，讲者点击了一个下拉菜单，将一个选中的“Group”（组）切换为了“Frame”（框架），从而获得了框架特有的功能（如 Clip content、Layout grid 等）。
