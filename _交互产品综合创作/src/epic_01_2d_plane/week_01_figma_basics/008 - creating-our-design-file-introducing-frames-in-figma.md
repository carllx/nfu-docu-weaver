## 逐字稿内容

### [00:00:04] Daniel Scott
Okay, so let's make our first design file. So it can be a little confusing for this first screen. Yours is going to look different from mine because they change this quite often. If you have nothing like mine, you might go up to the top left-hand here and click on the little drop-down. If you're somewhere else, you might have to click on the home button first and then this little drop-down. And what you're looking to do is to click on your name. Mine will be a bit blurry here because it's got my email addresses as well. But click on your name, not community, click here, and you should get to something resembling my screen. What we want to do is a new design file. That only appeared the other day, so what I've normally done in the past is I go to, we're going to create a drafts, okay, and there's this little plus, it's kind of next to it. Okay, so either way, we're making a new design file. Okay, and there we go.

### [00:00:53] Daniel Scott
All right, if you're brand new, I've kind of reset my Figma so all these little pop-ups. You can show stuff. I'm here to show you, so I'm going to cancel that. You end up with this big nothing screen. So, we've got our design file, okay, now we need to introduce frames. Frames are these guys here. It's this little icon here, third one in, click on it. Okay, and you can draw out any size frame. Think of a frame as a page. Okay, so if we're drawing an app, we're going to draw something kind of like, oh, go back to this tool here. Draw out something that looks like an app. You can have multiple frames, okay, all sorts of different sizes. Desktop one, tablet one.

### [01:30] Daniel Scott
So, frames have many uses, okay, but at this early stage of the course, think of them as a page or an artboard if you're from Adobe land. Um, what we need to do is delete them because those are random sizes. Click anywhere in the inside of them and hit delete. Click them, delete them. All right, so go to your frame tool and actually let's be a little bit more specific with our sizes. Okay, over here you'll have some pre-made sizes. Okay, you are going to be in the future, so you might be at iPhone 52. Okay, I'm going to use iPhone 8. It's a nice generic size for both Android and Apple. Some of these big ones get a bit big and strange sized.

### [02:05] Daniel Scott
Now the goal here is to pick a size that is generic. Okay, we're not going to design every different iPhone in different size. We're going to design something close enough to the general purpose phone and our developer will build something that is a bit more responsive and will adjust for the kind of small changes and different pixels. So pick a phone size that is quite generic. It's easiest just to Google like most common phone size. Um, you know, you will get something or most common desktop size, okay, and you will get something in here and pick it. If you're designing a watch, if you're doing kind of just regular old school paper, the wood stuff. Okay, there's all sorts of things in here. So yours will be different. Now, I'm going to start with a phone and I'm going to start with iPhone 8, even though it's really old. I don't know why it's still in here. Hey, it is, but it's a good generic size. 375 pixels I like.

### [02:54] Daniel Scott
You can adjust it afterwards. Here's your frame, okay, and you can say, actually, the new size is not even listed there. I'm going to use 400 and just type over the top. I'm going to undo that because iPhone 8 is perfect for what I need. And again, if you're watching in the future and there's no like iPhone 8, you can type in this, uh, 375, 667 to get the same dimensions, but hey, go with whatever's common for you right now. The other thing I tend to do is I try and at the meeting figure out what kind of phone my client has because they're going to be potentially testing it on their phone. Okay, so I want to make sure like if they've got some sort of phone, I might use that just so that it the mock-up works really great on their phone.

### [03:32] Daniel Scott
So, we're going to end up with naming loads of these frames because iPhone 8-1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 is not going to help us. So we're going to double click on the word up here or you can double click over here in your layers panel. If you can't see the layers, you might be on assets. Okay, double click it, either one, and let's call this one, remember our task flow, okay, we've got, we're going to have our marketing page. We'll call it the homepage. Homepage/marketing page. We want another one. So you can go back to your frame tool, click on iPhone 8 again, you'll get another one and just keep going the way through. We're not going to do huge amounts of shortcuts in this course, but we're going to have to learn a few. The first one's going to be spacebar. So hold down spacebar. It's pretty common in lots of design programs, right? And click, hold, and drag. Okay, and I'm going to name it in this one. So remember our task flow is marketing page, then product details.

### [04:20] Daniel Scott
Another shortcut that we use quite a lot is you can just copy and paste these frames. So just click the name, Command C on a Mac or Control C on a PC, then V. So Command V, we got another one. Control V on a PC. Okay, up to you. I say no shortcuts and then I start with lots of shortcuts. Uh, let's put in our four pages. So our task flow said, we're going to do that, product details, what else was there? There was a checkout. Okay, and copy paste, spacebar, click and drag. We are going to do our confirmation.

### [04:52] Daniel Scott
Cool. So in the same document, there's no reason why you can't then go, actually, now I want my desktop version. Okay, so I'm going to click on frame. I'm going to say tablet, and I'm going to say we're going to be designing for the iPad Pro 12, because that's the one I own. Okay, and over here, landscape, portrait. Let's spacebar across. Landscape, portrait. You can move them. Okay, I'm going to click the name, you drag the name, spacebar around, drag the name around. Okay, you might say copy paste, paste, and do the same thing. We're going to have homepage, product details, same with like, uh, the desktop versions. I'm going fast here because we're going to delete them, so you don't need to. Maybe practice playing around with it. Okay. Um, if you, see this one's iPad Pro at the moment, okay, you can click on this frame and say, actually, now you are, um, a normal kind of standard desktop. That's a really good desktop size. Okay, um, really common and generic.

### [05:44] Daniel Scott
Now, zooming in and out, Command on a Mac, Control on a PC, and just hit the plus and minus keys. Okay, there's a million different ways of doing lots of things here in Figma. I'm going to give you one way that I think is probably the easiest at your level, or just the generic best way. If you do find another way and you're horrified I'm not using the hold option, hold the command key down and use my scroll wheel. That's what I can do to zoom in and out. You can do that, that's fine.

### [06:12] Daniel Scott
But what I want you to do is for this course is I'm going to select all of these. I'm just using this tool. It defaults to it every time, so you don't really need to pick it that much. I'm just going to delete it. This is where I want you to be at the end of this. If you end up in the middle of nowhere, I zoomed in into the middle of nowhere. Okay, I'm going to zoom out, use my spacebar, get it right in the middle, and then zoom in. Okay, so this is what I want you to get to. I want just four boring old frames. Okay, and I want you to name them all. And the last thing I want to show you kind of kicking off this getting used to Figma is naming your file. Just so you know, you're going to end up with lots of untitled documents. It just happens. I don't know, this program loves having untitled documents. Um, so we're going to be really specific and actually name them.

### [07:00] Daniel Scott
If we click off in the background here, can you see it appears up there? If you've got something selected, it goes away. Have nothing selected, click in no man's land, and you can click up here and you can say, give it a name. Okay, and you've already got your brief, right? So mine is Scott, yours is going to be something different, but we're all going to call ours Ecom V1. Okay, so you pick your, you know, the name of your company and put Ecom V1. Our e-commerce version one. Just the V1, just something, A, B, C, 1, 2, 3, it doesn't matter. As long as you're not like a final person, final one, revisited, final, final. If you're laughing, it's, you know what I'm talking about. I'm talking to you. Give it some version numbers. There are some sweet features later on for like versioning within the document, but that's later on. Another thing is if you have got a bunch of untitleds, you can, let's go back to, I want to explore this little house or go back to, yeah, go back to the little house. Remember, make sure you're at your little name here and not community. Okay, and what you'll notice is, look, there he is down there. Uh, Ecom one. If you've got lots of, uh, untitleds already, okay, I've cleaned mine out. You can right-click them and go to rename and just do it there. Or open them up and do what we just did. Back to this tab, back to home. Get practicing that. Home base into our work, kind of like a browser.

### [08:15] Daniel Scott
All right, that is our basic setup. These are frames. The whole thing's called a design file. Frames have other sneaky settings that we'll talk about later in the course, but for the moment, consider them pages or artboards, but they're called them frames. Onwards to the next video.

## 重点整理（第一人称视角）
我从这个视频中学到了如何在 Figma 中开始一个新项目，核心是理解和使用画框（Frames）。

首先，我学会了如何创建一个新的设计文件。在 Figma 的主界面，我可以点击蓝色的“New design file”按钮，或者点击左侧“Drafts”旁边的加号图标来新建。

接下来，我了解了“Frame”这个核心概念。Frame 就像一个页面或画板（Artboard），是我所有设计元素的容器。我可以通过点击顶部工具栏的网格图标（Frame Tool）来自由绘制任意大小的画框，也可以在右侧面板选择预设的设备尺寸，比如为 iPhone 8 创建一个画框。讲师建议选择一个通用的尺寸（如 iPhone 8 的 375px 宽度）开始设计，因为响应式适配最终会由开发人员处理。

为了保持项目整洁，我学会了给画框和文件命名。双击画框顶部的名称或左侧图层面板中的名称就可以重命名。我按照用户流程（Homepage -> Product Details -> Checkout -> Confirmation）创建并命名了四个画框。同样，点击顶部中央的“Untitled”可以为整个设计文件命名，一个好的命名习惯是“[项目名] V1”，这样便于版本管理。

最后，我还学到了一些基本操作技巧：按住空格键可以拖动画布（平移），使用 `Cmd/Ctrl + C` 和 `Cmd/Ctrl + V` 可以快速复制和粘贴画框，使用 `Cmd/Ctrl` 加上 `+` 或 `-` 键可以缩放视图。这些基础操作让我能更高效地在 Figma 中工作。

## 关键术语和人物
- **Figma**：一款基于云端的协作式 UI/UX 设计工具。
- **Frame** (画框)：Figma 中的核心容器，相当于其他软件中的画板（Artboard）或页面，用于承载设计内容。
- **Artboard** (画板)：一个在设计软件中划定出的、用于创作的固定区域，常见于 Adobe 系列软件。
- **UI/UX** (User Interface/User Experience)：用户界面和用户体验设计。
- **Daniel Scott**：本视频的讲者和课程导师。

## 图像补充信息
- **创建新文件**：在 Figma 主界面（Dashboard），可以通过点击显眼的蓝色“New design file”按钮，或左侧边栏“Drafts”文件夹右侧的“+”号图标来创建。
- **Frame 工具**：在设计文件界面的左上角工具栏中，Frame 工具的图标是一个井号或网格符号（#）。
- **预设尺寸**：当选中 Frame 工具后，界面的右侧会出现一个“Design”面板，里面列出了各种设备的预设尺寸，如 Phone (iPhone, Google Pixel), Tablet (iPad), Desktop 等，点击即可创建相应尺寸的画框。
- **文件命名**：在设计文件界面的顶部中央，默认显示为“Untitled”。点击这里即可修改整个设计文件的名称。
- **图层面板 (Layers Panel)**：在界面左侧，显示了项目中所有的画框和元素。可以在这里双击画框名称进行重命名。
