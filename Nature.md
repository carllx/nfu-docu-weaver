## What is Nature of things? 

Nature in [[philosophy]]有两个相互关联的含义.  [slife](https://slife.org/nature-in-philosophy/#:~:text=Nature%20in%20philosophy%20has%20two%20inter-related%20meanings.%20On,the%20essential%20properties%20and%20causes%20of%20individual%20things.)
- On the one hand, 它是指所有自然的(natural)、或受自然规律(laws of nature)正常作用的事物的集合
- 另一方面，它意味着个别事物(individual things)的本质属性(essential properties)和原因(causes)

一些哲学家，如 Anthony Quinton，试图发展一种连贯的 [[ontology]] 或一种关于 what exists 的理论，基于 [[唯物主义|Materialism]](唯物主义) 的版本, 万物都是由物质构成的观点(everything is made of matter) [3](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/philosophy/article/nature-of-things/49AA4B25F9F23E7BF69468A1CC808F4E). 

其他人则探索了 [[philosophy]] 本身的性质和范围，以及它与其他知识领域的关系，如 science, religion(宗教)，ethics(伦理)和艺术。[4](https://sciencetheory.net/nature-and-scope-of-philosophy/).

 [[philosophy]] 中 nature of things 是一个广泛而复杂的话题，有许多不同的观点和论点(perspectives and arguments)。它试图对整个reality 达成一个理性的概念(rational conception)。 [4](https://sciencetheory.net/nature-and-scope-of-philosophy/).


### By Learning what is Nature, which philosophers and schools should I know?
#### Answer 1:
According to the search results, nature in philosophy has two inter-related meanings. On the one hand, it means the set of all things which are natural, or subject to the normal working of the laws of nature. On the other hand, it means the essential properties and causes of individual things¹².

- The ancient Greek philosophers, such as Thales, Anaximander, Anaximenes, Heraclitus, Parmenides, Empedocles, Anaxagoras, Democritus, Plato, and Aristotle, who tried to explain the origin and structure of the natural world using rational arguments and empirical observations¹.
There are many philosophers and schools of thought that have discussed the meaning and significance of nature in different ways. Some of the most influential ones are:

- The medieval philosophers, such as Augustine, Boethius, Avicenna, Averroes, Maimonides, Aquinas, Scotus, and Ockham, who integrated the natural philosophy of the Greeks with the revealed truths of Christianity, Judaism, and Islam, and developed the concepts of natural law, natural theology, and natural rights¹.
- The modern philosophers, such as Descartes, Hobbes, Spinoza, Leibniz, Locke, Berkeley, Hume, Kant, Hegel, and Marx, who challenged the classical and medieval views of nature and introduced new methods and perspectives, such as rationalism, empiricism, [[理想主义|idealism]], [[唯物主义|materialism]], and dialectics, to understand the natural world and the human condition¹⁴.
- The contemporary philosophers, such as Husserl, [[Martin Heidegger|Heidegger]], Sartre, Merleau-Ponty, Wittgenstein, Quine, Kuhn, Popper, Foucault, Derrida, and Rorty, who have questioned the assumptions and limitations of the modern philosophy of nature and have explored the issues of [[Phenomenology(现象学)|phenomenology]], existentialism, language, logic, science, culture, and postmodernism¹.

These are just some of the examples of the philosophers and schools of thought that have contributed to the philosophy of nature. There are many more that you can explore and learn from. I hope this helps you with your learning. 😊

#### Answer 2:
Philosophy of nature, also known as natural philosophy or cosmology, is a branch of natural sciences that deals with the world of nature in general¹⁹. It traditionally studies questions about the definition of matter, motion, time, infinity, and the components of the universe¹³.

Some of the main philosophers of nature are:

- Plato, who is one of the most influential philosophers in history and who proposed the theory of forms and the idea of the demiurge as the creator of the physical world⁶.
- Aristotle, who is considered one of the fathers of philosophy and who developed the concepts of substance, form, matter, potentiality, actuality, and the four causes⁶.
- Rene Descartes, who is regarded as the father of modern philosophy and who introduced the method of doubt, the cogito ergo sum, and the [[二元论|dualism]] of mind and body⁶.
- Isaac Newton, who is recognized as one of the most important scientists of all time and who formulated the laws of motion, the law of universal gravitation, and the theory of optics⁶.
- Charles Darwin, who is famous for his theory of evolution by natural selection and his book On the Origin of Species⁶.

There are also other philosophers of nature, such as Ralph Waldo Emerson, Henry Thoreau, Immanuel Kant, and Plotinus, who have different perspectives and approaches to the study of nature⁷ [^10^] ¹¹.

### Aristotle's views 
(-- `Aristotle’s Natural Philosophy (Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy)` [stanford](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/aristotle-natphil/#PrimSour))

本文讨论了Aristotle 对 Nature、四个原因的看法，以及自然如何与因果关系学说相结合

Key takeaways:
1. Aristotle 认为，Nature 是一个变化和being 的内在原则。
2. 四个原因是物质、形式、有效原因和最终原因 (matter, form, efficient cause, and final cause)。
3. 自然界(Natures)可以在四个因果功能中的任何一个发挥作用。

Counter arguments:
1. 对单一事态的解释可以用不同的方式进行。
2. 有效原因的作用与实体的物质和形式的作用不完全相同。

```markdown
The text is about Aristotle's natural philosophy, which is his view of the world and how it works. He thought that the world was made of natural substances that had two aspects: matter and form. Matter was what things were made of, and form was what made them what they were. He also said that there were four kinds of causes that explained why things happened: material, formal, efficient, and final. Material cause was the stuff that something was made of, formal cause was the shape or essence that made it what it was, efficient cause was the force or agent that made it change, and final cause was the purpose or goal that it aimed for. He believed that natural things had an inner principle of change and being at rest, which meant that they had their own natural tendencies and goals. He also studied the different types of natural things, such as living things, elements, and heavenly bodies, and tried to understand their characteristics and functions.

### Descartes's Views

```markdown
The text is about René Descartes, a French philosopher, scientist, and mathematician who lived in the 17th century. He is considered one of the founders of modern philosophy and science. He had a new way of thinking about reality, which he divided into two kinds of things: matter and mind. Matter is anything that takes up space and has shape and size. Mind is anything that thinks and has no shape or size. Descartes said that the nature of matter is not what we see or feel, such as color or hardness, but only its extension, which means how long, wide, and deep it is. He also said that the laws of nature are based on mathematics and logic, and we can discover them by using our reason, not our senses. Descartes wanted to help humans control and use nature for their benefit. He believed that the mind and the body are separate, but they can communicate with each other through a small part of the brain called the pineal gland.

[[René Descartes]] was a French philosopher and mathematician who is known as the father of modern philosophy. He developed a method of rational inquiry based on clear and distinct ideas that could be deduced from self-evident principles[1](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Rene-Descartes).

According to Descartes, nature is a broad term that can refer to different kinds of things. He divides the simple natures into three classes: intellectual, material, and common[2](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/descartes-method/).

-   Intellectual natures are the objects of the mind, such as knowledge, doubt, ignorance, volition, etc.
-   Material natures are the properties of extended things, such as extension, shape, motion, etc.
-   Common natures are the universal attributes of all things, such as existence, unity, duration, etc.

Descartes also uses the term nature to refer to the essence or nature of a thing, which is what makes it what it is. For example, the nature of a body is extension, the nature of a mind is thought, and the nature of God is perfection[3](https://libquotes.com/ren%C3%A9-descartes/quotes/nature).

Descartes also uses the term nature to refer to the laws or principles that govern the natural world, which he believes are established by God and can be discovered by human reason. For example, he argues that the nature of light is to move in straight lines, and the nature of matter is to conserve its quantity of motion[2](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/descartes-method/).


### Monism and dualism
Monism and dualism are two philosophical views that deal with the nature of reality and the relationship between mind and matter. [Monism means a theory or doctrine that denies the existence of a distinction or duality in some sphere, such as that between matter and mind, or God and the world](https://bing.com/search?q=monism)[1](https://bing.com/search?q=monism). [Dualism, on the other hand, is the theory that the mental and the physical – or mind and body or mind and brain – are, in some sense, radically different kinds of thing](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/dualism/)[2](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/dualism/).

[The difference between monism and dualism is that monism postulates unity of the origin of all things and reduces all [[Phenomenology(现象学)|phenomena]] to one principle, while dualism postulates two irreducible, heterogeneous principles or categories of things or modes of existence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monism)[3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monism)[4](https://www.britannica.com/topic/dualism-philosophy). [The connection between monism and dualism is that they are both attempts to explain the nature of reality and the mind-body problem, which is the question of how the mental and the physical interact and influence each other](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/dualism/)[2](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/dualism/)[5](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dualism).
