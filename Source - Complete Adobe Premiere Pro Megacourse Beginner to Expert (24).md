## 1. What is Sound Design

Now that we know everything about video editing and the basics of color theory, we're going to move
on to sound within editing.
So what is sound design and why is it important that we use it in all of our videos?
So sound design is when you take different audio tracks and balance them in a way that can make the
audience feel like they are in your video.
For example, if you have a video montage of your travels at the beach with the right sound design,
you can make the videos look really relatable and your audience will feel like they are in that beach
with you.
So it's about taking a look at the elements inside your video and putting the corresponding noises together
in your timeline.
So in the beach example, I would have to put the noise of seagulls, maybe some people talking in the
back or anything else that's within the video.
Putting those different audio tracks in my footage is going to make my video not only better, but more
professional.
So in the following lessons, we're going to learn about different examples of sound design and how
we can use the design to make our videos look better.
Before that, let's take a look at what sound design looks like in Premiere Pro.
So for a sound design, you would be occupying the audio tracks that are present inside your timeline.
If I just make a sequence.
You can see we have video tracks and audio tracks.
So every sort of design that I do will be right in this area and I would just be bringing in different
audio tracks, whether it's a sound effect, a soundtrack, voiceover, and so on.
Then I would have to balance it with what's happening in the video tracks above.
So what the audience sees and what they hear is corresponding.
Let's head to Google and see what a professional timeline will look like when we have sound design.
If you search this on Google, you're going to see many examples of what professional timelines look
like.
So you can see that it's pretty crowded.
Look at this.
They have around 64 different video tracks, each one with audio.
And separately, they have some audio tracks which we can't really see the rest.
But essentially, this is what it looks like.
You're putting different sounds from either a video or an audio track together.
You have trimmed them, split them and just place them next to each other.
And when the audience just sees this video, it's going to feel so relaxing and essentially more understanding.
Here is another example.
We got many more to look at.
So these examples are what Hollywood editors do, which is pretty advanced.
But in the following lessons, we're going to see how we can get started on creating a more professional
timeline for our videos.
So first, let's learn about the different types of sound.
So the most basic type of sound that I'm sure you've all used in your videos before is music.
When it comes to music, we have different categories.
So we have instrumental, which means that there's only instruments playing in that song and there is
no one singing or talking.
Secondly, we have vocals only, which means that there's no instruments and it's just someone singing.
And thirdly, we have both of those combined, which is instruments and vocals.
So the first one is music, our first time.
The second type of audio is voiceovers.
Now, voiceovers can be anything.
They can be a poem, a speech, a regular conversation and discussion, or just anything else that comes
from a person's mouth in a raw format.
So with voiceovers, you're not really adding any autotune or any other editing.
It's mostly about the person's voice and how it's going to be blended in into your clip.
So that's our second type voiceovers.
Third type is soundtracks.
So soundtracks are essentially music created for that.
We do soundtracks are usually quite long and you would just play them throughout your entire clip or
for a small section.
Sound effects are a lot more shorter that we hear in our daily lives bird noise, rain noises and things
like that that you could just blend into your music and your voiceovers.
Now when it comes to sound effects, we have organic effects like the examples that I mentioned, bird
noises, thunder and all that.
Other times we have artificially produced sound effects, meaning that a person is recreating a sound
that would usually not be heard in real life.
For example, alien noises, monster noises and all of that.
These are artificially produced by humans, sometimes using simple objects, other times using technology.
Moving forward with the lessons.
We're going to be using all of these different sounds, putting them together in our timeline, editing
them and adding transitions to them just as we would with video.
So let's take a look at an example of sound design.
I have the opening scene from the movie Dunkirk, and I want you guys to listen to all the audios within
this video.
Then guess how many different soundtracks the editors had to put in?
So let's analyze this.
We can see papers falling from the sky and we can hear the papers movement.
Apart from that, we're getting this creepy, ominous noise in the background.
And when the subjects are running away, we can hear their footsteps.
We can hear that epic music in the back.
The sound of gunshots and the subject's panting.
So these are many different sounds placed on top of each other to have the audience be engaged with
what's happening.
Now, imagine the scene where the subjects are running away, but only with some epic music.
You will not feel as nearly as engaged as you would with the other sound effects.
So this was an example of what sound design looks like and the effects that it can have on the audience.
Moving forward, we're going to create different examples where we take different ideas, put them together
in relevance to what's happening in our videos.
So without further ado, let's get started with our first example.


## 2. Nature Audio Design Example Pt. 1

So let's begin with our first sound design example.
We're going to begin by finding the right video and the corresponding sound effects that are inside
that clip.
So first, we're going to need the base footage that we can easily find on either Pexels.com or Pixabay.com.
In this lesson, I will be grabbing resources from free platforms just in case some of you guys don't
have subscriptions or stock platforms.
So if you need any images or videos, you can come to these two websites and then begin searching whatever
you need.
So I'm going to search for Beach Walk because I want a human subject and we have plenty of options to
choose from.
So I will choose this video, download it, and we have officially found our first clip.
Here is my second clip.
They're not from the same subject, but we're going to assume they are.
So once I have downloaded my videos, I'm going to analyze them.
So playing this back, I can see that there is water.
There is someone walking in water.
So I need splash sound effects.
Normally in this setting there are some seagulls flying around, so I need seagull sounds and maybe
a wind sound coming from the back because I can see there is a soft current on the water.
So just for this video alone, I need a couple of sound effects.
One was the water splashing because she's walking in water.
Number two, I need some wind noises.
Three, I need seagulls.
And then I'm just going to put all of these on top of my music.
Let's take a look at the second video.
So again, she's walking, but this time on sand.
So that's the first sound effect I need walking on sand.
I need distance wave crashes because there's a lot of rocks.
Then I need seagulls wind and there's soft water noises.
So these are the things I need for this video.
So it's helpful to write these down once you analyze your clips, if the subject is talking or if there's
a group of people, you also need to grab some talking noises.
For example, if you chose this video, you also need the sound of these two people talking.
If there is an animal in your clip, you need the sound of a dog.
And if there is fabric just fluttering in the wind.
You also need that sound.
So you want to spend enough time analyzing your clips.
And then based off what you see, you are going to compile a list.
Once I have my videos and I have my list, it's now time to search for a background music.
You can either choose one with vocals or an instrumental one.
And the platform that we're going to use is actually Pixabay audio.
So just head to pixabay.com slash music and we have a lot of options.
I just searched instrumental, but again, if you want with vocals, you would want to search it here
in the search box.
Choose your genre here and go to ambient mood.
Let's go for relaxing.
So this completely depends on what's happening in the video.
Since both of my videos are of nature and they are in slow motion, then I would want to grab something
that is just as relaxing and beautiful.
So over here I have a lot of options.
I can give it a listen and see which one looks best on my video.
So I think the best one for my video is the second option by this person.
And you can see the duration.
Of course, we're not going to use all 16 minutes, but it's good to have a lot of room so that you
can choose the right area.
Download your audio and we're done with our second step.
Now, the third step is to bring in those sound effects that we talked about.
Refer to your list, and we're just going to head over to our third platform, which has different sound
effects for you to use.
Again, these are free.
Like I said, not everyone has those subscriptions.
So you can either grab the sound effects from this platform or go to another subscription such as Envato
Elements, Motion Array, Adobe Stock and all those other platforms.
I just searched for seagulls in this form.
One more thing about this platform is that you need to make a free account.
I just logged into mine.
It's pretty easy to make.
So here again, we can listen to a preview.
Skip through them.
Let's try this one.
So the second one is a lot more clean.
I'm just going to download this as our first sound effect.
So I just searched for walk.
Water.
Got to be really direct with the terms.
And also, keep in mind that your video is slow motion.
So this guy is a bit too fast.
We can't slow it down in post, but it's better to find something that's relevant.
So the first option is the best one.
There's my footsteps in water, and then we have another one for sand.
There's my third audio.
Next, we need soft wind.
So there's my wind sound, and I'm just going to keep on repeating this until I have all of the items
checked off my list.
Download all of them, and then we'll be ready to move on to Premiere Pro where we can put them all
together and have a successful sound design.
So I have finished downloading all of my sound effects.
I got my music and my two clips.
Import your first clip into the timeline and make a sequence from it and I'm just going to place my
music right underneath.
Extend the space so I can see the sound waves.
Let's see which part I want in my video
to start from here.
Make a cut.
Get rid of the rest.
So I have my music starting from this point.
And I'm just going to add a simple fade in transition for audio search.
Crossfade.
And I'm going to use exponential fade added at the start.
Then increase the amount to around here.
So this will slowly introduce the music and this is what it sounded like without the exponential fade.
So it just shows up out of nowhere.
But once I add a crossfade.
It's going to make it sound more cinematic.
So very slowly we're introduced to what's happening inside the video.
Grab your clip, command, dx or control dx to add a cross dissolve transition when it puts it here.
So it kind of shows up with the audio.
Get rid of the other crow's feet.
We only need it to start.
Now, let's put on the second video right after that, this right next to this one.
And I'm just going to have to right click set to frame size.
Maybe a little more.
So you.
So this is what we have right now.
We have just music and some slow motion clips of people at the beach.
Then to cut off the audio.
Right around here.
Get rid of the extra bits at the same exponential fade near the end, extending the amount so that it
slowly fades out our music.
Select this video command and now I have a crossfade at the end.
You can even pull this closer.
There we go.
So this on its own is the base level of sound design.
You've got to put your food and your music, and then you're going to take it a step further by adding
in all of those sound effects.
So let's pull the video tracks up so I can see more of the audios.
So let's head to our project panel and we're going to begin putting on two different items.
The first audio that we have is the Eagles, and I'm just going to have this play in the back of this
video.
Because seagulls are most likely in this setting rather than the other one.
So drag the audio right underneath.
Play this back.
So it's a bit too loud.
We extend these.
What you want to do is to grab that over to effect controls and reduce the level.
Just go for negative ten.
Now, let's give it a listen.
Still a little too loud.
-15 should be better.
Now I'm going to have this audio track play a little before the second video.
We're going to learn about these types of transitions in a further lesson.
But for now, just played like this.
And instead of putting it right where the video starts, you want to put it a few seconds before grab
your clip and add in the same exponential fade so that it slowly builds up as we move forward.
So there you go.
So that's my signal sounds and it cut it off around here, get rid of the extra bits and add the same
exponential fade.
Let's pull it further.
When you're fading out audio, you can also increase the exponential fade length so that it slowly fades
out rather than being instant.
So this was our first audio.
Let's go to our next audio.
We have the wind noises.
I had this reserved for the first video.
Just like the SEALs ordeal, we're going to reduce the decibels.
For this one, I will go with like negative ten.
Faded in and faded out.
Have the start a few frames before the video.
And this is another transition that we're going to talk about in a further lessons.
But essentially you're fading out the audio while the top audio is fading in.
So when the attention is shifted towards the skull sound, we are secretly fading out the previous sound.
So because this guy is playing right above, we can't really tell that we're fading out.
The wind audio swan transition that you can do.
The next audio is birds.
This is again for the first clip since I have seagulls in the second one, drag this underneath.
Play this back.
So it's a little too low.
I'm going to increase the volume for this one.
That's much better.
Introduce the audio a little further than the constant noise that you have.
So the wind here is a constant noise.
It's playing from the start to the end of the clip.
But this guy is kind of like the vocals of this clip, so I'm going to have it start a few seconds after
the wind noise at the effect right on the fade effect.
Play this back.
We're
looking good.
And then I'm going to fade it out a few seconds before the top audio ends.
That is pretty good.
The next idea we have.
Is the waiting water.
And that is for the steps that the subject is taking in this video.
So we need to kind of mark out the areas where her feet would be in the water.
And I'm going to have to watch the video, hit em on my keyboard, and then match this with those markers.
Grab the audio right underneath.
We can actually start it from here since the rest is silent.
Start this with our first marker.
We're
going to cut the first part off since it's kind of different from the rest and then grab another small
section from the audio.
Looking good.
Say the beginning.
And the ending.
Now over here, we have two different cuts.
We want to kind of blend them in so there isn't a obvious cut in the audio.
Grab constant gain and place it in between these two audios.
So now we will not get a sudden jump in our audio channel.
You can see it's pretty constant.
So far, this is what our timeline looks like.
If you want to have this be more organized, you can grab any of these audios, right click label into
different colors.
So this one will be wireless, the music, we can make it blue, and just labeling the audio tracks
as different things is going to make this more digestible for you so that you don't get overwhelmed
with all the green tracks stacked on top of each other.
All right, Let's move forward with the rest of the audios.
The next one is.
Waves lapping on rocks, which is worth this video.
So we have some waves and we got rocks.
So this audio is perfect.
Drag this underneath again a few seconds before the video begins.
Grab your exponential fade right at the start.
Play this back.
So.
Since the rocks are in the distance, we can't have the audio be as loud as if it were to be right here.
So drag the audio line down.
Play it back.
All right.
So that's pretty good.
Again, faded out.
A little after the video finishes.
So this is a constant sound like the wind that we have here.
So that's why we're starting it before the video and finishing it after the video.
Moving on.
We have soft waves.
That's where the first video.
Let's go down and make another audio track.
There's going to be a lot of audio tracks.
This is common with audio design, so just have everything organized at the start and then moving forward,
you will not be overwhelmed.
Good to lift up the audio line for this one and then close it off with our constant sound, which was
the wind sound.
So if a razor tool is not snapping like this, it may be because you hit s on your keyboard.
So if I hit, as you can see that I'm just moving around freely.
But make sure that you have snapping turns on when you're working with audio design.
Get rid of the rest and add those exponential fates.
Match it with your wind audio.
Let's give it a listen.
I might be a little lower than that.
The next ordeal is walking on sand, which is for the second clip, just like the first video.
We need to look at our clip.
Mark out the parts where she's taking a step forward and then match the audio with those steps.
So make sure you're not selecting anything.
Play your video and hit em on your keyboard where she's walking.
Grab this idea underneath and this guy is a bit too fast.
So first I'm going to extend the bars here so I can see the peaks.
Those peaks are when the person is taking a step forward.
So I need to match it with the markers first.
I'm just going to slow this down.
Let's go for 70.
Solo this track.
Still a bit too fast.
Let's go for 60.
So that's better.
So that's my first step.
I need to match the beginning with the first marker.
Check the audio right here.
Have the rest of the order.
You begin with my second marker.
Third step.
Match it with the other marker and just keep going forward until you have finished all the markers.
So I have cut that audio into different parts and matched it with my markers.
Play your video back.
Make sure that the sound matches the movement of her feet.
Once you're finished, you can just on solo this track and listen to it all together because the sound
is not as loud.
We don't need to fade it out.
It gets blended in nicely with all of the tracks that we have.
So let's give it a listen.
So there is that soft movement of her feet on the sand.
If you want to increase the volume or do anything else, it will be time consuming to grab each one
one by one and change the effects here.
So first, I'm going to label this as a different color.
Let's make it into magenta.
Do the same thing for this other color.
Make it a different color.
Then head to the audio workspace.
And this is audio track six.
Find it right here which which you can if you scroll down.
And for audio six, we're just going to increase the volume.
We're going to come back to this workspace once I have all of my ideas and just balance out the different
volumes.
For now, let's focus on composing the sound design and then later we can go back to that workspace.
So those are all of our tracks.
We have placed them on top of each other, and then all we have to do is to make everything balanced
and maybe finish off this video with some overlay, some text and other effects.
So this is it for now.
We're going to continue this example in the next lesson.


## 3. Nature Audio Design Example Pt. 2

Welcome back.
This is where we left off in the previous lesson.
We combined all of these different sound effects along with some music and our main clips.
I've also faded them out.
And now it's time to finish this with some overlays and text.
Head to the audio workspace.
And we're just going to play this back and adjust these volume sliders.
If you go up, you're going to make it louder.
If you go down, you're going to make it lower.
This is audio track one to audio track six, so you can see what's on that track.
We have the music on audio track one.
And finally the footstep sounds on the audio track six.
I'm just going to drag things down.
So each of these different audios have their own separate track.
So now each of these ideas have their own individual tracks, and if you want to move them down without
changing their position, you can hold down shift.
Let go once you're finished.
So now instead of six, I have eight audio tracks.
They are all here.
I'm going to listen to everything and then adjust their volume.
All right.
I have adjusted the odd use for each of these different treks.
And now my video is good to go.
Let's head to the captions and graphics workspace.
So we can put on our text and pull this down so I can see the area for my text.
Grab my text to, which is up here.
Let's first find out where I want to put my text.
Grab it.
And just write something random.
Command or control H to select your text and then do your adjustments.
Once you're done, we can grab the move tool and position this.
Going to have a plea at this point.
Work with the length and play it back.
So I have my text right now.
I'm just going to add a simple dissolve transition.
Select your clip command to put on a cross, dissolve transition at the beginning and at the end.
And then right at the second peak of the music, can I put my plate right here?
I will change the source text into something different.
Let's go to the effect controls.
Open up text.
Enable the stopwatch for source text.
Push the keyframe back and then change the text into something else.
So suddenly we're going to get this transition from this into this.
And this is matched with the piano key right here.
The wheel is back.
There we go.
So match your keyframe with the beat here.
And now I'm going to make another text for my second video somewhere around here.
Put in some random text position into where you want it and then hit command or control.
DH on Windows.
Now for this one.
If you want, you could use a transition.
Simply make keyframes for position.
We're going to learn about transitions in another lesson.
But for now, I'm just going to do a quick position animation.
Make a keyframe right where you want it to show up and then go back a few frames, pull it towards the
right.
Just right at the start of her leg.
So now we're going to have something like this.
Then pull these guys back.
If you extend the space between the two key frames, it's going to show up a lot more slope.
Grab the two key frames right click and change them to ease in.
Then repeat the same source text animation or the second text right on this beat.
I'm going to make another text appear.
Let's double click.
Another key frame here.
Pull it back so that it stays unlearn.
In between these two key frames and then put in your third text.
I'm using my left and right Roderick keys to move around.
Then I'll make my final text.
Let's call it Nature Company.
Let's say this is the name of my project.
Place it here, make it a little smaller, and have it go past her leg.
On this point, I'm going to make a position keyframe.
And basically before that, I don't want my text to be so far away from her legs.
So go on your second position, Keyframe.
Select that keyframe and just push this guy down.
You could take this a step further and track it to the ground.
But we're not going to do this for this example.
I think for the last text, let's do something else.
Close up this text bar here and instead make a new text layer for the company's logo
commending.
Let's choose a different font and style.
Center using these two.
And now I have my logo.
At the center of this video commanding and extend the length.
Make a new adjustment layer.
Put it underneath your new text.
Grab a blur effect and add it right onto your adjustment layer so we can finish this off like an ad.
Blew everything.
15 points.
Add on a simple shadow effect in effect controls on your text layer.
Just go down to shadow, check the box and reduce the opacity.
So there is some dimension with your logo.
You can of course put in an actual logo, but this text should do it for me.
Now for this text where it shows up from this area, I'm going to create some mask transitions so that
it looks cool.
Go to the frame where the animation has ended, select your text, hit M and go down to the text mask.
You're going to have to zoom in on her link.
Then go to a frame where this comes in contact with her feet.
Grab your mask.
And just go around her feet.
Doesn't have to be perfect because four feet is far away.
But just try to make an accurate selection.
Invert your mask so everything shows up except for the parts where you can see the feet.
Now we're going to make a keyframe for mask path, then go each frame back, making sure that the Explore
text does not show up on her feet.
So right here, I'm going to make keyframe, adjust my mask.
You can see that it kind of goes over her feet.
Just pull these to the side.
And just repeat this until the text has fully gone behind her feet.
Delete the across the self transition and I'm just going to fade this out the old fashioned way.
Go down to motion, make a keyframe for opacity, and when it reaches the start, we're going to reduce
it to zero.
And I extend my mask here.
And just modify your keyframes until you have a good result.
So once they play this back, we have a nice mask text effect.
All right.
Once I'm done with my text, I can go back to my editing panel.
Let's fix this up.
Then get a nice preview.
So if you want, you can finish this off with some color grading.
But the videos are pretty good on their own and therefore I will skip that step.
So that's about it for our first example.
Let's take a final look and then move on to our next lesson.


## 4. Action Audio Design Example Pt. 1

Now let's take a look at another example where we can use sound design to make the experience better
for the audience.
In the previous lesson, we looked at a nature example, meaning that the sounds were of nature, they
were organic sounds.
But in this lesson, we're going to take a look at sounds made from action.
So I will have a human subject in this example.
And therefore, apart from the environmental sounds, we also need to put in the human sound.
If you have filmed the video yourself, then you wouldn't need to get those extra sounds.
But we're just going to assume in this lesson that you recorded that video on mute, or that the audio
of the person wasn't good enough for you to use it.
So I'm back in pixels.
I will just look for my type of video, which will be sport.
When you search sports, you're going to get a lot of options such as basketball, surfing, archery,
football, swimming and so on.
So I think I will grab maybe an intense sport such as boxing.
I'll just look for it in the search bar.
The more specific, the better.
So I will grab this video of this person practicing their boxing.
That's my first clip.
Now let's take a look at another example.
Let's go for maybe jump rope.
If you are going for something like this, look for videos where the subjects are kind of jumping at
the same time.
So preferably you would want one subject, but if there are more than one, try to try to get a video
that has matching movements.
So there are my clips.
I'm going to once again open them up and analyze what's happening inside the video.
So this is a pretty organic environment.
We obviously have the contact between the glove and the sandbox.
But apart from that, we need to add the chain noises because this guy is getting pushed back with every
punch.
Certainly since there is another person, we're going to assume that this is some sort of gym and that
there are other people in the back.
So this could be some distant communication, some distant punch noises and so on.
And of course, we need an epic music for this training video.
This person isn't really saying much.
So.
I won't be needing to do anything for him.
Another thing when it comes to action videos is the breathing of this person.
So naturally when you're boxing, you are having really sharp breaths taken with every punch.
So that's another sound that we need to add to our list.
Our second video is not boxing, but it's another extreme movement.
So we have the sound of the jump ropes.
And once again, I'm going to assume that this is a gym and there are other people around these two
subjects.
Once I have analyzed my two videos, it's now time to move into the audio part of this, get our music
and then our sound effects.
Let's begin with our music.
I'm going to head to the instrumental section.
Let's go for maybe electronic mood.
Let's see.
Epic.
Let's see what these are.
So I chose this music for my video.
It's quite short, but that's exactly what we need.
And by the way, if you choose to do the same thing that I'm doing, then the items are in your resource
pack.
So there's my music.
Let's grab the sound effects from our third platform.
So first, let's begin with the boxing video type in boxing.
Let's give it a listen.
So this is a good idea for the MIT because the speed of this audio and the speed of the subject in the
clip are not going to be the same.
And therefore, I want to clean the sound of the Mitt hitting the sandbag.
So this is a pretty good audio.
Next, I will grab this one where it's a boxing gym.
So like we said, we want to make it look as if there are other people in that gym boxing with our subject.
So I will have this guy play in the back and this one playing in the front search for sport breathing.
So we get some briefing and think, I'll grab the first one.
This will go in between the punches for our subject.
Finally search for Jim ambience.
Onto the second video, which is the jumping rope sound for the jump rope.
Let's take a look.
So let's grab this one.
It's the most relevant to the video.
I don't want it to be too intense because they are a bit further away from the camera.
Pay attention to the type of flowing too.
If the jump rope sound is way too loud, then you would not be able to use it for this floor.
These guys usually don't echo back any movement.
It's pretty common in gyms or any other training centers, so try not to get something that's too loud.
For example, this guy.
So this is obviously a wooden floor.
There's a lot of guess echo coming from every hit.
That's not what we need since our floor is not wood.
So we got the jump rope.
I will use the same gym ambiance in the second clip.
So those are the orders we need.
Compared to the nature example, it's a lot less.
And the most important thing here is the combination of human noises with the environmental noise,
because these two videos are shot in a closed environment.
We will not have things like wind noises, bird noises, wave noises and all that.
So that is why there is a smaller number of audio tracks.
Download all of your different sounds, import them into Premiere Pro and then we can begin.
Once we're in Premiere Pro, we're going to make a sequence from our first clip.
Just turn these into a list and I can take a look at how big each of these items are.
So make a sequence from your first clip.
Let's get rid of the audio and put in the second clip.
The audio in this video didn't really have anything.
So that's why I got rid of it, since it would be an extra track for me.
Let's right click on this set to frame size.
Pretty good.
Now, let's begin by putting in our music, finding out which part I want and which part I don't want.
So this is the idea that I have.
It's a little too long.
And I think instead of grabbing and kind of cutting the end, I can just bring in another sport that
will be a better choice.
Let's go back into Pexels and maybe this time look for basketball.
So I will grab this video, download it.
Now, in terms of sound, I don't need much.
Let me close all those tabs.
Get basketball and look for the ball hitting the ground.
There you go.
So this is pretty good because I have some talks in the back and I have the bouncing of the ball practicing.
Secondly, I will need like a park sound.
Let's grab this park sound.
And together I will have all that I need.
So let's just import those in here too.
So now I have imported all of my footage into the timeline, bring in the video to and and basically
match the duration of the music.
And cut it off around here.
Get rid of the excess.
Grab my first clip.
Command or control DX, offset the beginning.
Command your control dx on the last video two.
So I get a cross dissolve transition at the end and at the start.
So now the base work is there.
I have my clips, I have my music and all of my audio tracks are ready to go into next lesson.
We're going to put it all together and learn how we can combine human noises with environment noises.
So I will see you guys in the next lesson.


## 5. Action Audio Design Example Pt. 2

Welcome back.
In the previous lesson, we downloaded all of these footage.
We got some sound effects, the music and some clips, then replaced it into our timeline, as you see
right here.
So now it's time to put in those sound effects and get started with the sound design.
The first thing you want to do before adding in all of these sound effects is to analyze your music.
There's always a high and a low in these songs, such as When the Beat Drops.
So unlike our previous example, where we had like a constant piano in the back, here we have more
going on and therefore I want to match those beats with my videos.
Let's extend the audio bar right here and zoom in into my timeline.
So without me having to play this, you can see that things are slow here, but right around here things
start to get pretty intense.
So this right here is like the prequel of the song.
And then this is where the beat drops and the most epic thing needs to happen right here.
So based on my videos, I'm going to decide which one is the most epic and which one is not.
So the boxing one is pretty epic.
But the jump rope, I guess you can say that it's not the most epic thing in the world.
So let's bring it in front.
Get rid of the first half and then cut it right at this big drop.
Just zoom in here.
Bring your play head right there, click away and then hit Command K or control K on Windows.
I can get rid of this half.
Then bring in the next intense work, which I will just choose the basketball and then the boxing video.
Let's get rid of the cross dissolves and create new ones by hitting down command D or control D.
So now when I play this back,
I can see jump straight into basketball.
I chose basketball over boxing.
This is my preference.
You can, of course, go with the boxing first, but now I have something that matches my music.
Later on we're going to use what we learned from the speed lessons to match the speed with what's happening
in the music and just to fill up the space.
I went ahead and got another basketball video.
So on right here, there's more than one person here.
So this is like a match that this subject prepared for.
Bring it right there.
Close it off.
Right at the peak.
Use a C on your keyboard to grab the razor to make it cut.
Get rid of the excess command to your control DX on this final video.
And now I have filled the timeline.
All right, so I'm going to move this for a second.
And that way I can just analyze the video and start putting into different sound effects.
So let's begin with the jump rope.
I'm going to play it and then hit em whenever the rope hits the ground.
There you go.
I did this on the video itself.
You can do it on the timeline by clicking away.
Once I have all my markers, I can bring in my jump rope sound effect.
Let's extend this and find the jump rope.
There we go.
Drag it underneath.
Let's give it a listen.
Closes down a bit.
Open this instead.
Let's give it a different color.
And when you have produce like this, the best type of sound is the ones where it's clean.
So there's no background audio in between them.
There isn't someone talking some random noises.
This way I can just duplicate this track as many times as I need to fill up my timeline.
So let's match the rope with the.
Sounds.
So let's have the -- begin on our first marker.
Then the audio should match on its own.
If it's not, just work with it.
But because the person in this audio recording is skipping ropes, then the rhythm should be the same.
You just have to adjust the duplicate.
So we need to start here rather than here.
Let's get rid of the first part
and match the start.
There we go.
We can cut off the access.
And that's my first audio track.
Let's minimize that track and make room for the rest.
Back to our project panel.
We need to add in the second noise.
I'm just going to take a look.
And that's the gym audio.
Bring it right in.
Underneath everything else, starting with the video clip.
Change the color as you go on to that.
Things can be less confusing.
Solo.
This track.
And we can decide when it should end.
Lower the audio of it and then command K right on this area.
We could linger it for a little bit after the video ends.
That's one of the techniques we used in the previous lesson.
Now let's listen to everything all together soloing the jump rope and the gym.
We don't need the music right now.
Later on, we will work with the volume of each one.
For now, just try to make it relevant to what you're seeing.
I think that's all we need.
The breathing, I believe, is for the boxing footage.
Yeah.
Okay, so for our first clip, we just needed these things.
Then when it played back, this is what we have.
So the sounds are all there, but because one of them is overpowering the other ones, we're not quite
hearing the gym noises and the jumper noises, so we definitely need to adjust the audios.
Let's move to the second track.
I'm going to mute the music so I can focus on what's happening.
So here we have a dribbling effect going on.
Before I move on, I'm going to add the exponential fade at the beginning and at the end of my gym audio.
You don't need to do it for the jumping rope idea because like we said, it's clean.
And if we take a look at the sound waves, nothing is happening at the start and at the end.
So let's add our first audio, which is the sound of the ball hitting the ground.
Let me double click on this.
There you go.
This is the audio we took for this situation.
Played a few seconds before the basketball video.
Let's change the color into.
Dark green.
And now play your future back.
Marking out the areas where the ball hits the ground, you can either select the clip and make markers
on that clip or click away and have the markers up here.
Let's change the color of the video and begin analyzing.
There you go.
So this is our first hit.
And it's matched with that.
I'm just going to.
Touch the audio right here and match the second one with the second marker.
Hit us to disable snapping.
And that way you will have an easier time moving these tracks around.
Cut the extra bit off.
We're still going to use this audio for our second basketball clip.
So don't delete this.
So there are some background audios in these clips.
Therefore I need to just fade them in and fade them out.
To do this manually, it's going to take a long time.
So what you can do is to create your own shortcuts so that with two keys you can have that transition
happen.
Go to the premiere Pro Menu.
Keyboard Shortcuts.
And right over here, we can search Crossfade.
In the Timeline panel, you have two options.
So the video Crossfade is Command D, but the audio crossfade is something different.
You can change this by deleting this and then pressing the keys that you want.
So I will go with, let's say, command edge and now I can apply the Crossfade transition for my audios.
So command edge.
And now I have the Crossfade transition that I can just kind of adjust to my liking.
There you go.
That's so much better.
You can also grab a few command edge and have it all look the same.
So I added those crosses, all transitions, and now the audio fades in, then fades out.
So that's the first audio track for this video.
Let's add the next one.
So for this one, I'm going to keep it really simple because it's in slow motion.
From this one audio, I'm getting the ball effect and some distant talks.
So I only need one track for this.
Now on to a more real time video.
So this one is not so.
This one is not in slow motion and therefore I can add more audio.
The sounds of the people will not be heard.
But if you did want to add some noises of people talking or people cheering.
You would have to match it with the speed of the video.
So we can't have a slow motion clip and have people shouting in real time.
You need to slow that down so it's more realistic.
Onto the real time clip.
At your boxing order, you place it right underneath.
And the reason why we're giving each one a separate audio track is that when we adjust the audios,
we will have an easier time so that when we adjust the audio's, we will have more control over how
each track sounds.
Now, this is a clean audio as well.
I pull it down, you can see that there's nothing going on here and throughout each of the punches.
So there's no point in me starting it from here.
And I just need to match these high points with each punch.
Select your video playback and hit em whenever they come in contact.
Just going to change this to a different color and then proceed to do that.
Since this is in real time, you would want to use your play head.
He is quite fast, just going slowly.
There's the first punch.
It m.
There is a second punch.
Make sure that it hits the sandbag before you make a marker.
And there is the third punch.
No punches.
And then he goes back.
So I'm going to do that, create my markers, and then I'll be right back.
So I have all of these markers and now it's time to match the hits with the markers.
Go to the first one.
Track the track right there.
Be sure to disable snapping by hitting s on your keyboard so you can move these guys around.
There is my first punch.
Trim the second one by hitting C on your keyboard to get the razor tool and just repeat these punches.
And now I have my first set of punches.
Repeat this with all the other markers and then we'll be ready to move on to our next audio track.
So I have all these different cuts, and now our subject is actually punching the sandbag.
There you go.
And again, we have the per give a clean audio.
I don't need to add a crossfade transition for all of these little tracks.
So make sure that the audio tracks you find are clean tracks so that you don't have to add that transition.
It Pull this up.
We're getting quite a lot of audio tracks.
Make some space here.
And and now onto our next audio.
Let's go in the project.
And I think we had like a gym.
Very good workout.
Gym, training, Boxing.
So this was supposed to be for the background music.
Going to drag it right underneath our video.
And this one because there is stuff going on.
I can start it before the video actually shows up.
So this is where the video begins.
But I will start it right here.
Label this into something different so we don't mix them up.
Command etch to fade the beginning and the end.
This is a bit too much.
We're going to balance the volumes later on.
But right now we have the nice punching noises and the sounds of other people.
Maybe training.
Let's just close this off again a little after the video finishes.
Looking good.
So let's move on to the next video.
It's a little zoomed in, going to set to frame size.
Looking good.
Got these black bars.
Extend that in.
There we go.
So for this one, we have a lot more ideas.
First one being the.
Scratchy noises that these sneakers usually make when they're playing basketball.
So just add that right in below everything and let's match that with what's happening.
Have it begin when the constant power transition starts.
Command edge.
So your secretly fading one out and secretly fading one in.
Just we just need to match it with the actual shoe movement.
So whenever this is happening, we just remind that the foot is forward.
It kind of gets pulled back.
That's when this squeaky sound is made.
So I'm going to begin the order here, actually.
It's a little too slow.
Let's go back.
Good.
All right.
First squeak.
We had one here.
So cut.
This started around here.
Command, which.
Just then, we'll do pretty good.
Now we can just duplicate this audio since we have a little bit of the video left hold down option or
alt click and drag to the side.
They can stay in one track since it's the same audio.
Let's see if there's any squeaking motion.
He's landing straight so there won't be any sounds.
Let's take a look at the opponent.
Maybe when he lands because he landed with his toe first and then his heel.
So just pull this your aside and there we go.
Cut the audio around here.
Command, which again?
And fixed duration.
Pretty good.
Change.
The color is always we want to be organized as we move forward.
All right.
The next audio for this one.
Let's see the thing.
It was this.
All right, So I can use this for my second basketball video.
This is in real time.
So there will be more bounces compared to the older compared to the other basketball video.
Again, I would have to play this through March when the ball hits the ground and match it with the
the sound effect.
Not seeing the ball bounce here, but I guess we can assume there's one out of frame, one behind him.
And there we go.
I can just copy these guys since they're pre faded and ready to go.
Option or alt bring it underneath and match it with the markers.
But our second marker, I can just bring this in.
To manage on this audio.
Make sure that there's a transition at the start and at the end, if your audio is not clean or else
you're going to get a really awkward cut when you're playing your feedback.
That's our next marker.
One here.
And finally, one here.
Comment manage if you plan on cutting the audios.
Now, if the idea is too short for you to add a constant power transition, you can just do a manual
transmission by going to the selecting the video first, then go into effect controls, enabling the
stopwatch for levels, making keyframe go to the end and just reduce it to like negative something.
Do the same thing for this one, because sometimes when your audio is really short, these transitions
will not work.
Let's play this back.
All right.
So you may have noticed the rise and fall in the sneaker audio, but when it goes underneath the music,
you will not hear it as much.
All right.
So I think we used all of our audios.
We have this briefing audio that I think I'll place on this third basketball clip because you exhale
with every punch and he was punching pretty fast.
So for this breathing, I think we can put it for basketball.
So it's kind of like we're inside the player's head as they're focused on the ball.
Label your audio track, and I think the audio is good.
It was a constant reading,
and I think that's good comment and we're pretty much done with the audios.
This is what we have.
It's looking pretty crazy, but it's absolutely necessary for audio design.
So in this lesson, we combined all of the different audio tricks that we had matched it with a video,
and now we're ready to do some final adjustments balanced to different volumes, put on maybe some text,
some speed effects and so forth.
We already know a lot about how to use Premiere Pro, so you really have the liberty of doing anything
you want to this video.
So I will see you guys in the next lesson where we continue with this video.


## 6. Action Audio Design Example Pt. 3

Welcome back to the lesson.
In the previous two lessons, we took some resources from the Internet, sound effects, music and clips,
put them all together in our timeline and match the audio with what's happening inside the videos.
So now that I have everything lined up, it's now time to balance all the different volumes and finish
this off with some additional effects.
I also went ahead and got a chain sound effect because like we mentioned, there's a chain up here.
This is what it sounds like.
So I just kept this right here.
We're going to have to reduce the volume so it's not overpowering the punch noises that we kept before
I hit command H to add the crow's feet, and now all I have to do is switch to my audio workspace and
balance all the different audios.
So I'm in the audio workspace right now.
We have quite a lot of audio tracks.
If you're not seeing your track here, then it may be disabled, so just make sure everything is there
before moving forward.
So I have a one to a ten, I have a one to a ten right here too.
For example, if I've locked one of my tracks, it's not going to show up.
All right.
Let's focus on one video at a time.
I have the preview panel right here.
It's quite small, but it should do so.
Play this back, adjust just different audios in the first video.
We have audio track one through three.
Let's unmute this, play this back.
So the music is way too loud and we can barely hear the rest of the stuff.
And by the way, don't worry about the cuts you made on each of the tracks.
These guys are targeting anything in this row, so it doesn't matter if you.
So it doesn't matter if you have split your audio into different parts.
This will affect everything in let's say, audio track for.
So let's reduce audio track one.
That's try negative five.
Chad.
I'll stick with negative five.
You can also click and type it in if you can get that exact number.
So my music is negative five.
I need to bring up the volume for audio to.
Let's bring it up to like six.
That is good.
We're hearing some of the heads of the group maybe reduce it a bit.
And finally, the gym noise that we had.
I want to increase it so we at least know it's there.
All right.
So that's the first video.
Let's move on to the second one, which is about audio track for.
And that's it actually for audio track for we need to see if we can hear the different sounds.
So it's really low.
It's bringing up the volume to like 4.8.
That's pretty good.
Let's go to our next video that has three track five, track six and finally ten.
So let me see what this is going to solo, this track.
So that's the background.
Boxing.
I need this to be lower than the actual punches.
So how do you track five?
Increase the amount.
Track six We can reduce it to like negative two.
Then for a ten, we are going to reduce the amount.
So it's kind of in the far back.
All right.
And finally, in the last clip, we have audio track seven until nine.
That's.
So already we can barely hear the ball bounce.
So audio track eight, we need to increase the amount quite a bit.
And this, I believe, is the sneaker.
Sounds so maybe raise that up as well.
So that's for the audience.
We ended up with the following numbers.
So put this back as many times as you need to and adjust the volume.
Now let's head back to our previous workspace and now I will begin maybe adding some text, working
with the speed and so on.
Saying I will not do anything with this speech since some of the videos are slo mo and the other ones
are faster and I'm happy with the speed, but if you did want to change the speed, then you would have
to move these audio tracks around.
So if you, let's say, slowed down your video, you would have to increase the space between these
different audio tracks.
That means that you need to analyze your video one more time, create the markers again, and then adjust
the placement of the following tracks.
I will, however, do some sort of simple animations just to make the videos more dynamic.
Let's play this back.
So maybe for this I will go to effects controls.
Let's actually add the transform effect.
On the video to effect controls underneath transform.
We are going to scale this in.
But then, of course, have both of your subjects centered so it doesn't look bad.
Enable the stopwatch for scale and position.
Whoosh!
These guys at the beginning of the video and end around the end.
I want to bring it back to what it was.
So we're going to type in 100.
And just push this guy back to where it was.
Which is 1920.
So very slowly.
We're zooming out from our subjects and we can add a animation where the key frames such as ease out
and ease in.
Just to make the smooth.
So we're keeping it simple with this simple animation, so the rest of the videos are quite dynamic.
The subject is doing a lot of things, so there won't be a need for me to add additional animations.
But the first video, they were just doing one motion over and over.
So in times like this, you would want to add the animation yourself.
So this is my video so far.
Let's finish this off with, like some text animations at the back.
So I'm going to delete, cross, dissolve and extend this here.
So it ends right with that fate.
Now on to fate.
I'm just going to put a simple text.
Let's go to the captions and graphics workspace, grab your text tool and type in something.
Sport Company command.
Thin.
Choose your font, increase the size, then place it right in the middle.
Move, the anchor pointed to center.
I'm going to place my text like this.
Right after the video ends, we jump straight into our logo.
Now on this text or my logo, I'm going to add a very simple animation with the transform effect.
Could you effect controls, make a key frame for scale right around here.
And at the beginning of this text, I just want to increase this quite a bit.
1452.
Then we're going to head down to the.
Shutter angle.
Turn this off so I can get some motion blur.
So when I play this back, let me mute the music I'm going to get.
A quick scale down of my text, then grab the two key frames right quick, then hit ease in.
So just a simple transition and I will finish this with command D for a simple cross dissolve.
And that's looking pretty good.
Return to your editing workspace.
Now you have yourself a fully edited action video.
In the further lessons, we're going to see how we can spice up these types of videos with special transitions,
some text effects, video effects and so on.
But for now we're more focused on the audio.
So I kept the video part simple.
So this is it.
For this lesson we learned how to combine different ideas together when it comes to action.
In the next lesson, we're going to learn more about how we can control the way our audio sound.
And hopefully by the end of this category, you will know how to use Premiere Pro's Tools to get the
best audio for your videos.
So I hope you guys enjoyed this lesson and I will see you in the next one.


## 7. Cleaning Audios

So by now we learned about two examples where we can use sound design to make our videos better.
But what about instances where you want to add a voiceover on top of these videos?
So basically you're going to have one audio track, be the focus of the audios and have the rest of
the environmental noises playing behind them.
Into this lesson, we're going to learn how we can achieve clean audio from different situations.
There's always going to be noise issues when you shoot outdoors, maybe someone talking in the back,
the wind and these things can be helped depending on the situation.
So I have three videos here.
I will also demonstrate how we can do noise a voiceover.
So by the end of this lesson you will know how to clean different types of audios.
So let's begin with a video where we have a lot of background noise and see how we can salvage the clip.
Let's make our sequence right here.
You can see how crazy these sound waves are.
He just goes up and down and there are no pauses in between.
Let's listen to the audio.
So the wind is so intense that it's just going straight into the microphone, therefore catching all
of these sound waves.
So when I come to the audio workspace, I have some options.
If you go right here in audio track mixer and it's telling you the name of the video, if you're not
seeing this, just go to window and bring in the audio track mixer for that clip.
Once you have this, I'm going to click on this arrow to get these white bars.
Now, this is where you get to add special effects to your audio.
So our first special effect is to noise, this clip.
Which basically means that I'm going to remove the background noise with this special effect.
Grab the first selection, click on it.
By default it's on non.
But once you go down to noise reduction slash restoration, you will have some options.
So we're going to go straight for the noise.
Click on it.
Once by default it's on 40, but you get to increase it depending on how well it helps your clip.
Let's play this back.
So it's a little different.
Let's see what happens when I increase this all the way.
So like 100.
Play this back.
Notice how it kind of made everything flat.
And we're not hearing that intense wind.
That's because the noise is targeting the audios that are not that close to the mic.
So let's say if your mic is in front of you and someone is talking in the next room, adding the noise
to your clip is going to get rid of that background noise and just focus on your audio.
But the problem with this video is that, like we said, the wind is way too harsh and it's pretty close
to the microphone.
So even when I brought it to 100%, I couldn't get rid of the really high peaks that you see right here.
So adding dinos, you can remove the little noises that are underneath normally there underneath this
line, but the ones that go above this will be harder to remove.
So I can't really do much with this clip.
Maybe try to embrace the wind and just try to make it a little mellow.
So maybe 76% play this back.
This is what it sounds like without the noise.
Click on this f.
So it did remove something and I played it again with the noise.
Without the noise.
So with the noise, it makes it a little mellow.
But in the end, we weren't able to get rid of these really high peaks.
You could try to save this with some music, a voiceover or anything else that can distract the audience
from the heavy wind and into whatever the point of your video is.
Also, it's really important to add your special effects in the audio track mixture rather than directly
onto that track.
That way you can avoid getting complications as you are trimming your video.
Let's say this is my raw clip and I have yet to split it and trim it.
So instead of just adding the noise, bring my effect menu here.
Let's search for the noise.
If I add it in here directly onto my audio track.
I mean, whenever I split this premium Pro is going to have to analyze this little section all over
again.
So imagine if you had to make many cuts.
Premiere Pro would have to do that for every tiny bit.
And that can be a problem when you are about to export.
So this problem will show up in your audio track when you export it as a fade in.
So at every little cut there will be a fade in and basically you're kind of talking like this instead
of like this because you're interrupted at every cut that you made during editing.
So it's really important to add your special effects in the audio track mixer and not directly onto
your audio tracks.
This way, if I do it here, no matter what I do here, I make like 50 cuts on my video.
This effect is just permanently over this entire track so it doesn't have to re analyze my clip.
It's just there from the beginning and it just stays there until I export.
So it's really important to do it here and not straight onto your footage.
All right.
Let's take a look at another example.
I'm going to bring my project window here.
All right, Get rid of this one.
Now, let's bring something that's a little easier to deal with.
We have this outdoor shot.
You can see that these sound waves are a lot less intense compared to this one.
You can see the difference.
So everything is underneath these zero decibels.
This line is currently set on zero.
Let's remove the noise and see what we're dealing with.
So I took this outdoors.
There were people speaking.
There was a restaurant that had like a TV turned on and and there is a lot of audio coming in, but
it's a lot less intense than the other video.
And we can just tell that from the sound waves.
Now, what happens when I add this noise onto this, the same noise effect onto track one, make sure
that you're putting it on the right track.
With just 40%.
Let's see how that changes the audio.
So it's a lot better.
This is without noise.
This is with the noise.
And now I have the opportunity to use this with my sound designs.
If you increase this above the amount necessary, you will end up distorting your audio.
So if 40% is good, there is no need for you to go to like 100 because you're going to distort everything
within your audio.
Who?
So there is no need for you to exceed the required amount, and the amount depends on your audio.
So there isn't a magic number.
So that's my second example.
I just need a noise.
But sometimes you will have other things going on.
So because this was shot outdoors, the noise should do it for me.
I don't need any other effects for noise removal when there's a situation like this.
This was shot indoors.
So when you're shooting indoors, there's naturally going to be echo, especially if your room has less
furniture.
The amount of echo will be increased.
So the sound waves of this clip is rather intense compared to our second example.
Let's see what it sounds like.
So why are these so loud?
Well, the obvious reason is that the camera is pretty close to the action.
And with every click that the person is doing with their metal tool, we are getting a high point in
our soundwave.
So there is still people talking in the back and I can remove that with my noise effect audio track
mixture and noise.
Try 40%.
So now I'm not hearing the people in the back, but mostly the clicks that this person is doing.
So try to increase this amount.
So now I know that it went overboard because the sound is distorted.
Let's go back to maybe 33.
Play this back.
So this is a lot better because I get the little click sounds, but I'm just not getting the additional
noise of people talking in the back.
This is what it sounded like without the noise.
This is what it sounds like with the noise.
You can also play it and turn it on and off.
So it's quite different and I only needed 33%.
Now, apart from noise, because we said this was shot indoors, I also need a reverb effect.
So reverb should be familiar for most of you guys if you listen to your remixes on the internet.
Reverberating is basically where you add echo to an audio.
So it's not the traditional echo where the person says something and it comes back with a delay, but
rather a smoother echo effect.
So it's an effect used quite often in music.
But here we don't want any echo, so we need to deliver.
So essentially removing the reverb, click on it.
Once and again we get this percentage.
This will go right underneath your first effect.
Let's try it with 40%.
So 40% is too much.
Let's reduce it.
Still a little much.
I think maybe 15% should do it.
And that's better.
Let's see the before and after results.
So with every click and every thud, we're not getting that big response.
That's because we reverb the audio.
So now I have a cleaner audio that I can use for my commercials and so on.
Now, these were examples of just any idea without clear vocals.
But what if I had a video where someone is speaking in it and I just want to get rid of the background
noise?
So we're going to try that with a voiceover that I can do inside Premiere Pro.
Let's delete this video and get rid of these guys.
So I'm just going to record a few voiceovers using this tool right here.
If you click on it once, it's going to count from three, then it's going to record.
You can stop it right here.
So I'm going to do one where I'm just speaking directly into the microphone, another one where I'm
speaking from a distance and another one where I'm just making random noises.
So we're going to see how I can save those different types of voiceovers using the effects that we learned
about.
So I am back with my different voiceovers.
I use Premiere Pro for these voiceovers, but you can also use other applications.
So there are three examples, one where I'm close to the mic, one where I'm away from the mic and another
one where I'm just making random noises as I'm speaking into the mic.
So let's listen to what each one sounds like.
Zoom in right here.
Play the spec.
This is me close to the mic.
One, two, three.
So notice how my voice is a lot higher than the background noise.
These guys are background, by the way.
So this is the easiest example because you're pretty close to the mic and you're not getting that much
of a background noise.
If we take a look at these sound waves, you can see that there's barely anything here.
But but my voice is the only thing that's loud.
So first of all, when I play this back, this is notice how it's really high.
So it's giving me this red mark.
If your audio's are too loud, you need to fix the volume so that it's not discomforting for the audience.
So right now I got this red bar, which means that I need to work with my volume.
You can just grab it down here.
Let's try negative two decibels.
Me close to the mic.
Try to go a little more.
Let's try.
Negative five is me close to the mic.
One, two, three.
So now I'm no longer getting that red bar, which means that I'm in the safe zone.
I could make this lower depending on what I'm doing.
But for now, we're just going to stick with negative five.
In a further lesson, I will give you guys some tips that you can use for better recordings.
Let's get rid of the background noise.
Go to the audio track mixer.
For reference, I'm just going to duplicate this audio on the second track.
Let's make this a different color so everything an audio one will be affected by the special effects
that we put on here and audio two will be for the originals.
So let's go into the audio track one and our noise effect.
Start with 40.
I'm going to mute the original so we don't hear it at the same time.
This is me close to the mic.
One, two, three.
So just with 40%, I got rid of the background noise.
Depending on how much you have, you would want to play this bag, increase the amount or decrease it.
It's really important to play your audience back multiple times so that you don't miss out any distortions.
If you did hear any distortions, you would want to reduce the amount, and that's the only thing you
need to do.
So apart from the background noise, we do have a little bit of a echo because I recorded this in a
room and usually your voice bounces off the walls.
So depending on how big or how empty your room is, you would want to use the reverb option.
Scope here D Reverb.
Try 40.
This is me close to the mic one so this distorted my audio.
I need to reduce the amount to like ten nine.
This is me close to the mic.
One, two, three.
To increase it to like ten.
This is me close to the mic.
One, two, three.
And that's pretty good.
So 10% dx reverb, 40% for DX noise.
Let's take a look at the before and after results.
Push this to the side.
So this is what our audio sounded like before me close to the mic.
One, two, three.
And this is what it sounds like right now.
This is me close to the mic.
One, two, three.
So we fixed it with just two effects and we got ourself a really clean audio that now I can put onto
my commercials, my YouTube videos and so forth.
Now let's take a look at our second audio where I'm a bit further away from the mic.
You can see that these sound waves are not as high as the other example.
So for this one, I guess I had a distance of like 40 centimeters from the mic.
And in the previous one, it's about maybe ten.
So let's first see what we're dealing with.
Going to move this guy down to the original so I don't get these effects.
This is me away from the mic.
One, two, three.
So there's a lot more noise because, well, the microphone is catching on to the surrounding as I'm
not close to the mic.
So the distance between your mouth and the mic is really important.
Here I was really far away, so I would have to add more to the amount for both of these effects.
Duplicate the track.
For dinos, I think we would have to go for 50.
We have more river.
Let's go for 20.
This is me away from the mic.
One, two, three.
So first, let's fix the audio.
Try negative for.
This is me away from the mic.
One, two, three.
Right for noise.
That's a little higher.
This is me away from the mic, 1 to 3.
And I'm just going back and forth with the amounts, depending on how it makes my audio sound.
It may take a while, but it's really important that you put enough time for your four cleaning ideas.
So this is what I ended up with.
37% noise, 15% reverb.
Here is my result.
This is me away from the mic 1 to 3.
So it's a lot better, but it's not as clean as the first one because of the distance I had from my
mic.
But still we were able to salvage the audio using these effects.
Let's see what it sounded like before.
Excuse me.
Away from the mic.
One, two, three.
So this was before.
This is after.
This is me away from the mic.
One, two, three.
So we got rid of that hissing sound that was in the air.
We got rid of the echo.
And now our audio is a lot more clean.
So our third example is a lot more complicated.
Usually if you're recording professionally, you wouldn't be getting something like this.
But there are times where clients give you audios that are just not recorded properly and they want
you to fix it.
So one of the first steps that you should take is adjusting the volume.
Naturally, if the volume is louder, you're going to hear more of those background noise and those
other random noises in the back.
So begin by lowering your audio.
Let's try negative five.
This is me away from the mic with random noises and duplicate this for later.
So when I lowered the volume, I can hear these guys less.
But to take it a step further, I need to just add these effects.
Let's try the things we had before.
37% noise.
And for a driver, 15%.
This is me away from the mic with random noises.
So let's zoom in onto our timeline and take a look at the sound waves in this audio.
So by default, there are two types of audio.
We have the primary sound and then we have background noise.
So your primary sound or your primary noise is whatever that is close to the mic.
So this could be a song, someone speaking, a speech, etc..
These are the focus of your audios and therefore they're supposed to be louder than the background noise.
So if your primary sound is not louder than the background sound, then the chances of you saving this
audio and cleaning it are rather low.
So it's really important for your primary sound to have a big difference.
You can see right here, it's quite taller than the background noise.
So the next time that you are approached with a complicated ordeal where there isn't a difference between
the primary sound and the background sound, then you would just know that there isn't a point in you
trying to save it.
So let's say this is what your complicated audio sounds like.
In this section there is someone speaking, giving a speech and there is the sound of other people talking.
So already this sound waves quite low.
And at the same time, I'm not seeing a difference between my primary sound, which is the person giving
a speech and the background noise, which is the people talking.
So instead of wasting time and using all of these different effects, I can just try to get a better
audio.
Now, there are some tools out there that can save ideas like this, but those can be quite pricey and
they might not give you the audio that you're looking for.
So the next time you get an idea, take a look at these sound waves and then decide what you're supposed
to do with it.
There's no need to jump straight into the special effects when you don't even know what type of audio
you're dealing with.
So for this one, I was really far away from my mic and I'm getting these peaks as I was snapping my
fingers.
So with the following settings, this is what I have.
This is me away from the mic with random noises.
So as you can see, I didn't add that much of each of these effects, but my voice is already distorted.
This is because of the distance I had with my mic.
And if I try to maybe make these more, I'm going to get a distorted audio.
This is me away from the mic with random noises, so I sound like a robot right now.
So for ideas like these, I have to be really careful with the amount that I'm using or else I will
get a really bad audio strike.
18%.
This is me away from the mic with random noises.
So as you can see, I got something out of this, but the background noise is still there.
I still have the background noise because when I was like brushing my fingers, I was doing it close
to the mic.
But if I was doing this in the far back of the room, then I wouldn't be getting those extra noises
in my primary sound.
Let's try to work with the second option 8%.
This is me away from the mic with random noises, so this is a lot better.
You can see that I had to use less audio because there is less room for Premiere Pro to work with.
But in my first example where I was close to the mic, you can see that we ended up using quite a bit,
although we changed it, but I think we had more than 40% for noise.
So as you get further away from the microphone, you're going to have to use less of these effects.
You will find the most professional result when you're closer to your mic.
And I don't mean like maybe one inch away from your mic, a good, maybe four inch or five inch is a
good place to start for recording voiceovers, podcasts, speeches and so on.
You don't want to be too close to your mic and you don't want to be too far away.
We're going to talk about this in another lesson.
Let's first see the difference between the third audio and its original version.
This is me away from the mic.
With random noises.
This is me away from the mic.
This is me away from the mic.
It is so much better and I just need it to affect to fix this.
So those were how you can clean different types of audio.
What's happening inside these audios are really important.
So like we said, there isn't a magical rule that you can apply to every type of audio.
It depends on the sound waves, how much background noise you have, how separated your primary sound
is, and so on.
Now that we know how we can get clean vocals from audio, we can now go ahead and try a sound design
that includes vocals.
So we're going to learn about some other techniques all in the next lesson.


## 8. Vocals Audio Design Example Pt. 1

So now let's see how we can create the suitable sound design when we have a vocal in our video.
So the techniques I'm about to show you in this lesson are suitable for maybe a poetry video, a speech
video, a motivational video, and so forth.
Basically, any video where someone is talking and you just want some complimentary sounds and videos
to help deliver the message.
So with these types of videos, we need to do the opposite, meaning that we need to focus on what's
the most important.
And that is our voiceover.
So in the previous two sound design examples, we went for the videos first because the focus was the
videos.
But here we're doing the opposite, and we're going to begin by finding our voiceover.
So I'm just going to grab something from free sound.
Search your type of voice over.
I'm going to look for poems.
You can look for speech, motivation, anything else that you want.
I do not know who I am.
Yet.
I desperately want self-definition.
So I'm going to grab this poem and it's by this person.
And now, based on the theme of this audio, the mood of the audio and basically how it makes you feel
when you listen to it, you want to choose the suitable music and then finally, you're going to go
to the videos and the additional sound effects.
You can record the audio yourself, just pick a topic, get a good distance from your microphone.
I'll have a quiet room and begin your recording.
You can do that easily on Premiere Pro Clean the audio as we learned in the previous lesson and then
come back so we can continue with the sound design and just the editing of this example.
So this poem that I have right now is pretty deep.
It's not like a happy, vibrant poem, but more of a serious and I guess it's talking about finding
yourself and knowing who you are.
So the person is talking about self definition and therefore, based on what I feel and understood from
this poem, I can now go ahead and get my music.
So Pixabay.com stash music or any other platform that you prefer.
So choose your genre.
We obviously don't want any upbeat electronics, but rather something more mellow.
Let's give it a listen.
So I ended up with the following search results.
Sometimes you may have to download more than one audio because you're not sure which one would fit your
vocals.
Sometimes you have to put maybe 30 different musics underneath your vocals and test.
Which ones sounds the best.
Finalize your selection, download all of them and then we can test them out in Premiere Pro.
So I have my selection, my vocal, and now it's time to go and look for my video.
When it comes to these types of footage.
The focus shouldn't be on the video, so I'm not looking to distract my audience from the audio and
therefore I need to just find some slow motion clips that are relevant to my audio and just have them
play with the music.
Since the audio is talking about not knowing who they are and self definition, then we just need to
go for clips that match the energy.
I cannot have like a happy video when the audio is clearly sad so we can go for like person in nature
and just videos of people seeking something.
For example, this video.
He doesn't know who he is and he's looking for self definition.
This video is perfect.
I notice how it's not that distracting.
There isn't like a car crash happening and it's just about this person in isolation.
So this will be my first video.
Gonna choose my orientation so I don't get any vertical videos and only horizontal.
So just have the audio play in your head and for it to set like a standard when you're choosing your
videos, I'm just going to keep looking until I find a good selection of videos.
So I imported everything into Premiere Pro.
We've got a lot of videos and some music choices for me to choose when we move forward.
Now, I may not use every single one of these, but it's good to have choices when I'm editing.
So let's first decide which of these songs will go well with our audio.
I'm going to make a new sequence.
Go for a classic $0.80 30 frames per second and call it whatever you want.
So in my poem video sequence, I'm going to bring in my audio.
Then I'm going to bring in my first option.
I'm going to switch to the audio workspace so that I can change the volume as I go on label each of
the tracks.
And now we can begin.
Let's bring in the rest of the music's.
And label each one.
All right, let's solo the audio and the first music, go to our audio track mixer and lower the sound
of the music because the focus is the poem.
I do not know who I am yet.
I desperately want self-definition.
I'm trying to get us to abandon that terminology.
All right, so this was my first music.
It's not so bad, but let's give the other ones a try.
This is audio track three.
Lower the volume just the same.
So now we're working with the green track and the pink track.
Yet I desperately want self-definition.
I'm trying to get us to abandon that terminology.
I am saying something inconsistent.
All right, let's try the third one, lower the volume and let's listen.
From this point on, I'm trying to get us to abandon that terminology.
I am saying something inconsistent.
I am energized by students, encouraged by staff, and inspired by colleagues.
I am speaking to a microphone, broadcasting my despair.
But I hear no response.
So personally, I like the third option better than the first two.
The first two were just sad, and there is some sort of hope in this poem, so I don't want to make
it like that black and white.
And therefore I will choose the third music because it has that.
It has a little bit of an inspirational mood to it.
Choose whichever you prefer and get rid of the extra audios.
Let's bring this on and we're pretty much good to go.
Once you have everything set, be sure to adjust the volumes one last time and reset the empty tracks
because we're going to put different sound effects and we don't want them to be low when we first import
them.
Let's go back to the editing workspace.
So my sequence is now 4 minutes long.
I'm not going to use all of the poems since it would be a really long lesson.
Instead, I'm just going to comb through and cut the bits that I want.
So let's take a look at the sound wave for the poem.
See how clean the lines are.
That's because the person who posted this already d noise and reverbs their audio.
So I can simply just cut and stitch together the parts that I need.
And once I export this clip, the audience will not even know that I have split this audio.
So let's see which parts I want to keep.
Not know who I am.
Desperately want self-definition, trying to get us to abandon saying something inconsistent.
So let's say I want to get rid of this part.
Grab your eraser tool right here or head C on your keyboard.
Make a cut on this or select the clip.
Go on that area.
Command K or Control K.
If we get rid of this middle bit, push this guy back.
You can barely tell that there was a cut.
I am saying something inconsistent.
I am.
Let's try it with the audio.
Alone.
Assistant.
I am.
So that's the perk of the clean audio.
If you did record your own audio, make sure that these sound waves of your audio looks just like this
and that you're not getting any background noise.
That way you can trim it and do many things with it.
So I'm going to kind of shorten up this poem so that we're left with maybe 15 seconds or 30 seconds.
And that way we can keep the lesson focused on the techniques rather than the duration.
So I just trimmed my audio and do something like this.
It's currently about 8 minutes long.
But like we said, because it's a clean audio, I can just I can just cut this up as many times as I
need to.
Now, let's listen to the audio with the music and it just drag this.
Somewhere here.
So we kind of have an opening scene and then it jumps into the poem.
I do not know who I am yet.
I desperately want self-definition.
I'm trying to get us to abandon that terminology.
I'm saying something inconsistent.
I am speaking to a microphone.
So it's also helpful for these types of videos to kind of divide the audio that you have into smaller
chunks.
So right here, this is like part one of my music.
Then I'm just going to grab the rest and pull them towards the side.
Of course, matching it with the music.
But you don't want to play the entire audio all at once because that's kind of unprofessional and it
doesn't help with its blending into the story that you're about to create.
So now we have something like this to get us to abandon that terminology.
I'm saying something inconsistent.
I am speaking to a microphone, broadcasting my despair, but I hear no response.
I'm not sophisticated, but simple, concentrated and friendly.
I'm not well trained in Smile.
I'm not well trained.
I'm not well trained in smile, but always curious.
I want to help others.
I am a little bit afraid that it might sound naughty to you.
I am a visitor.
Once you're done, you can just split the rest of your audio and we can simply fade this out.
Command edge.
Control edge on windows to fade.
The beginning and the end.
We want to extend this so it has a slower fade.
I am a visitor.
So that's a lot better than this.
This is the default duration you get, but you definitely want to make this lower so that it's a lot
more clean.
We can get rid of the beginning.
Crossfade Since the song already has that.
There's no need to add an extra one.
So now I have a base to work on.
I have my opening here, I have my poem, and in between the poem I have some sections that I can maybe
put some sound effects nice video, and just make this poem more digestible for my audience.
So now let's put in the different videos.
I'm just going to filter it based on type.
There it goes.
I have my videos below and my audio is above.
I'm going to start with this shot of the flower.
Right click.
Said two frame rate.
Let's go for the second audio, which I'm going to put in this clip.
Again, make sure that you set two frame rate just in case it's a little too big.
Let's see what my third one is.
So I have three different videos for my opening now.
I need to match it with the music and have it blend in better with this bass that we have.
Let's play it back.
So right at this piano key, I want to cut to my next clip.
Have you played right on there?
Split that video using your razor tool.
I'm going to lock my audio track one and then ripple delete.
So now on this beat, I'm going to transition to the second video.
We have another one right here.
Let's get my next video.
Let's go with this one.
I do not know who I am.
Yet I desperately want self-definition.
So right before the second sentence, I'm going to cut the rest of this clip and put in my next video.
Yet I desperately want self-definition.
So based on what they're saying, I'm going to choose one of the videos where it's, I guess, more
about the subject.
Yet.
I desperately want self-definition.
I'm trying to get us to abandon that terminology.
So just repeat this until you have filled your entire timeline with videos, you can cut them on where
there is a new sentence, a certain beat within the song.
I would have to get more clips since I'm running short.
Then I'll be right back so we can continue.
Pixels.
I place them next to each other and based on the beat and what the author is saying, I split the clips
and got rid of the extra bits.
So now I got myself a decent framework to work on.
All that's left is to bring in those sound effects, and we should be ready to go.
So just like the previous lesson, you want to make a list of the ideas that you need.
It helps to watch your put you on mute so that you can focus on what's happening in each video.
Now, the thing about these types of clips is that the focus isn't really on the videos, but mostly
on what the author is saying.
So you don't want to grab any crazy sounds, any sound that is too loud and can overpower the poem.
You always want to grab something that complements the vocals.
So even for the videos, you probably notice that they're mostly slow motion and there's nothing crazy
going on in any of them.
That's because I don't want the audience to get distracted by what's in the videos and just stay focused
on what this person is saying.
So make your list and now we can head to the platform to download our sound effects.
I'm using free sound or g for this, but again, you can use any other platform.
So I downloaded all of my sound effects.
And now before I bring them into Premiere Pro, I need to organize my project panel, then make a bin
out of all these different audios.
Now, this bin doesn't mean that you're just deleting everything permanently.
It's just meant to keep things organized and in college music and vocal.
Then drag these guys, put him into this bin so I can always go back here and do my thing.
But this way, I can keep things more organized as I bring on more footage.
We can do the same thing with your videos.
Call it videos.
Grab all of your clips.
Be sure not to grab your sequence.
The icons are different.
This is a sequence.
This is a video.
Grab them all.
Everything is organized.
Now I can just double click and bring my different audios.
So these are all in your resource back.
You can follow along or just grab your own clips and audios.
So every video in this sequence is in slow motion, but there are some cases that we can use these different
sound effects to bring the video to life.
For example, in the first video, I just muted both the vocal and the music so that I can focus on
what's happening.
So here we have wind.
Clearly you can see the leaves are moving and this person is in nature.
Let me just turn this into a list.
So we have there we go.
We have a nature audio.
I can just grab a tiny bit of it, then put it right underneath.
Play this back.
So you can see how it helps with the environment that the video is in just one audio and now your video
is looking a lot better.
Let's pair this with the music.
So much better.
I can continue this on to my second clip because the setting is the same and my subject is still in
nature.
My third footage is still of nature.
I can just keep this going until here because we have no trees in this setting, which is sound different.
Let's just split the audio, delete the extra bits.
And I'm just going to pull this down into a separate audio track.
Because like we said in previous lessons, we want every audio to have their own separate track.
That way, when I go to the audio track mixer, I will have an easier time adjusting to different volumes.
So that's my audio.
And because it's not a clean audio, meaning that it's mostly background noise.
I will have to fade it in and out.
So extended past your current video.
So that we have enough space to fade this out.
Command edge or control edge on windows.
We can get rid of the first crossfade.
Just keep the second one for as long as the.
Next, we do a place.
So this is where the video begins.
Let's see how it sounds.
Now let's bring the other audios.
Just going to label this real quick.
Magenta is good.
And now let's find my other areas.
Thank you to my audio.
So here again, we have nature.
So I can just go back to my stores and maybe grab a different section.
This is a three minute long audio track.
So it's pretty helpful for me to just grab it and put it in different parts of my video.
Let's extend it here.
So it begins right before this video ends.
Take a look at my next video.
We can cut it here because I have a different audio for this scene.
Command, etch or control etch.
Let's bring my next audio, which is the bamboo plants in the wind.
So normally in this setting, there would be like bamboo plants, wheat plants that are just being moved
around because of the wind.
So this audio is suitable and it grab a tiny bit of it.
Grab it right here.
On a different track.
Command pitch.
Next video.
We don't really need a sound effect because it's a drum shot and we're clearly far away from the subject.
Next one.
We have these two people that think I can use.
Let's see what this is all about.
So I just have a sound effect of people talking.
We have this laughter section that I'm going to keep for later, but this section where it's quite mellow,
I can use it for this video, drag it right underneath a separate audio track.
Don't forget to change your color.
So it's not confusing when you move forward.
Squeeze these guys back.
And make more space for the new audience.
Because we're not going to change the volume here, but in the audio track mixer.
So just by adding this ordeal, I made it look like there is a roof party and the camera is focused
on these two people.
But there are others around these two people talking about something.
Command inch control edge, and let's end it.
You can actually make it go into the second video and bring the laughter part.
Right above.
Let's it down whole downshift so you don't change the position.
And maybe start the new audio right before the this video shows up.
So here is a transition between video.
A video.
I'm going to place my new audio in between them.
Command edge.
So now we have something like this.
I'm just going to slow it down.
Right click speed duration, maintain audio pitch.
Let's try 70%.
I'm
going to try different parts.
And then here I can just bring in my seagull audio.
There's a lot of seagulls.
Drag this right underneath again, giving it a separate audio track.
Be sure to start this before the singles video shows up, Commander.
Let's give it a listen.
And then we're back to the nature scenes, which again, I can use my park view, but a different section.
Let's go here before the video starts.
Pull it back.
Command etch.
Close it off right here.
And I can also bring in the bamboo audio.
In a separate area.
So they kind of play together and they have these beautiful environment where my subject.
If you're hearing the cut of the seagulls, you can just extend the crossfade so that it fades out cleaner.
So now I have all my different audios there, perfectly placed.
The final step is to work with the volume and maybe add a cinematic crop.
So let's move into the audio workspace.
Go to your audio track mixer, make sure nothing is mute.
And we're going to begin by playing our video back.
So in this part where we have only two audios, it's pretty good.
I'm not going to do anything to it.
But once you enter the area where there is the voiceover, the music and different sound effects, you
want to work with the different volumes.
I do not know who I am yet.
I desperately want self-definition.
But I'm not.
I'm saying something.
If you like my voiceovers to low and increase it to five.
I know who I am.
Yet I desperately want self-definition.
I do.
Track three is a little hard to hear.
Let's get 1.6 desperately wants self-definition.
I'm trying to get us to abandon that terminology.
This was pretty good.
Here it was inconsistent.
A microphone broke.
I am not sophisticated, but so audio track six can't really hear anything.
Bring that up.
I am not sophisticated, but simple, concentrated and friendly.
I'm not well trained in smile, but always want to help others.
See?
Let's see.
I am a little bit afraid that it might sound lousy to you.
I am a visitor.
All right.
So this is pretty good.
My volumes are set.
One thing that you have to do when it comes to vocals, it's that it might sound lousy to you is to
add something called audio ducking.
It means that whenever there is a primary sound playing the background noise or the secondary noise,
which is like our music, it needs to be lowered.
So right in the end, let's listen to it first.
I am a visitor.
So the sound of the birds and the wind is playing at a constant rate.
Even when our subject is talking.
So what I need to do is to just zoom right in and after my subject finished talking, I need to create
keyframes for my two sound effects.
So let's work with the wind sound first.
Make a keyframe for level at zero decibels.
Go forward and pull this up to like five decibels because our video's finished and this is our outro.
So what happened right now is this is suddenly gets louder.
Let me just click this so I can see the space increase, increases space.
So it's a slow and gradual thing.
And you do the same thing with the second order.
You click once.
Five decibels.
I may have to change the number later, but for now let's focus on making them louder.
And so that.
There you go.
You can also do the same thing for the music.
It's a pretty common thing.
I guess for the music we can go with a smaller number such as three decibels.
I'm going to bring my play there.
A visitor.
So what we did right now, it's called audio ducking.
It can also be done during your project.
So, for example, here your audio is your decibels.
You're going to reduce it to maybe negative five decibels when the person is talking and then bring
it back to zero decibels.
So that's the technique which you will have to use whenever there is a primary sound plane among all
your other sounds.
To finish off my video, I'm going to put in the cinematic crop.
So grab all of your videos.
Right click next.
On this nested group, we're going to add the crop effect and down to effect controls maybe 5% from
the top 5% from the bottom.
And now I have the cinematic crop.
You can add some color greetings, some text.
I will leave it like this, but fade out the beginning and the end by holding down command D control
D on Windows.
Select your first command D and now it's going to fade in and then fade out.
For the end.
We can make it more dramatic and match it with the music.
So that's pretty good.
And now I have myself a really nice poetry video that I can share with my friends and family.
So the takeaways from this lesson is the importance of your primary sound and the background sound.
Audio ducking.
We learned about that.
And now that I know the bass work of vocals, I can learn more about different channels, how to make
a more engaging video with these vocals and other effects.
So before moving on to the next lesson, let's see how the video turned out to be.
I do not know who I am yet.
I desperately want self-definition.
I am trying to get us to abandon that terminology.
I am saying something inconsistent.
I am speaking to a microphone, broadcasting my despair, but I hear no response.
I'm not sophisticated, but simple, concentrated and friendly.
I'm not well trained in smile, but always curious.
I want to help others.
I am a little bit afraid that it might sound dirty to you.
I am a visitor.


## 9. Vocals Audio Design Example Pt. 2

So this is what I did with my timeline.
I got more videos from Pixels.
I placed them next to each other and based on the beat and what the author is saying, I split the clips
and got rid of the extra bits.
So now I got myself a decent framework to work on.
All that's left is to bring in the sound effects, and we should be ready to go.
So just like the previous lesson, you want to make a list of the ideas that you need.
It helps to watch your video on mute so that you can focus on what's happening in each video.
Now, the thing about these types of clips is that the focus isn't really on the videos, but mostly
on what the author is saying.
So you don't want to grab any crazy sounds, any sound that is too loud and can overpower the poem.
You always want to grab something that complements the vocals.
So even for the videos, you probably notice that they're mostly slow motion and there's nothing crazy
going on in any of them.
That's because I don't want the audience to get distracted by what's in the videos and just stay focused
on what this person is saying.
So make your list and now we can head to the platform to download our sound effects.
I'm using free sound or g for this, but again, you can use any other platform.
So I downloaded all of my sound effects.
And now before I bring them into Premiere Pro, I need to organize my project panel, then make a bin
out of all these different audios.
Now, this bin doesn't mean that you're just deleting everything permanently.
It's just meant to keep things organized and call it music and vocal.
Then drag all of these guys, put him into this bin so I can always go back here and do my thing.
But this way, I can keep things more organized as I bring on more footage.
You can do the same thing with your videos.
Call it videos.
Grab all of your clips, be sure not to grab your sequence.
The icons are different.
This is a sequence.
This is a video.
Grab them all.
Everything is organized.
Now I can just double click and bring my different audios.
So these are all in your resource pack.
You can follow along or just grab your own clips and audios.
So every video in this sequence is in slow motion, but there are some cases that we can use these different
sound effects to bring the video to life.
For example, in the first video I just mute it both the vocal and the music so that I can focus on
what's happening.
So here we have wind.
Clearly you can see the leaves are moving and this person is in nature.
Let me just turn this into a list.
So we have there we go.
We have a nature audio.
I can just grab a tiny bit of it, then put it right underneath.
Play this back.
So you can see how it helps with the environment that the video is in just one audio and now your video
is looking a lot better.
Let's pair this with the music.
So much better.
I can continue this on to my second click because the setting is the same and my subject is still in
nature.
My third footage is still of nature.
I can just keep this going until here because we have no trees.
And this setting, which is sound different.
Let's just split the audio, delete the extra bits.
And I'm just going to pull this down into a separate audio track.
Because like we said in previous lessons, we want every idea to have their own separate track.
That way, when I go to the audio track mixer, I will have an easier time adjusting to different volumes.
So that's my audio.
And because it's not a clean audio, meaning that it's mostly background noise.
I will have to fade it in and out.
So extended past your current video.
So that we have enough space to fade this out, command edge or control edge on windows.
We can get rid of the first crossfade.
Just keep the second one for as long as the next video plays.
So this is where the video begins.
Let's see how it sounds.
Now let's bring the other audios.
Just going to label this real quick.
Magenta is good.
And now let's find my other areas.
Thank you to my audio.
So here again, we have nature, so I can just go back to my stores and maybe grab a different section.
This is a three minute long audio track.
So it's pretty helpful for me to just grab it and put it in different parts of my video.
It's extended here.
So it begins right before this video ends.
Take a look at my next video.
We can cut it to you because I have a different audio for the same command or control edge.
Let's bring my next audio, which is the bamboo plants in the wind.
So normally in this setting there would be like bamboo plants, wheat plants that are just being moved
around because of the wind.
So this audio is suitable and to grab a tiny bit of it.
Grab it right here.
On a different track.
Command ditch.
Next video.
We don't really need a sound effect because it's a drone shot and we're clearly far away from the subject.
Next one.
We have these two people that think I can use.
Let's see what this is.
So I own.
So I just have a sound effect of people talking.
We have this laughter section that I'm going to keep for later.
But this section where it's quite mellow, I can use it for this video.
Drag it right underneath.
Separate audio track.
Don't forget to change your colors.
So it's not confusing when you move forward.
Going to squeeze these guys back.
And make more space for the new audios.
Because we're not going to change the volume here, but in the audio track mixer.
So just by adding this audio, I made it look like there is a roof party and the camera is focused on
these two people.
But there are others around these two people talking about something.
Command and control edge.
And let's end it.
You can actually make it go into the second video and bring the laughter part.
Right above.
Spool it down whole downshift so you don't change the position.
And maybe start the new audio right before the this video shows up.
So here is a transition between video.
A video.
I'm going to place my new audio in between them.
Command edge.
So now we have something like this.
I'm just going to slow it down.
Right click speed duration, maintain audio pitch.
Let's try 70%.
I'm
going to try different parts.
And then here I can just bring in my seagull audio.
There's a lot of seagulls.
Drag this right underneath again, giving it a separate audio track.
Be sure to start this before the singles video shows up, Commander.
Let's give it a listen.
And then we're back to the nature scenes that again, I can use my park module, but a different section.
Let's go here before the video starts.
Pull it back.
Command etch.
Close it off right here.
And I can also bring in the bamboo audio.
In a separate area.
So they kind of play together and I have the suitable environment for my subject.
If you're hearing the cut of the seagulls, you can just extend the crossfade so that it fades out cleaner.
So now I have all my different orders there, perfectly placed.
The final step is to work with the volume and maybe add a cinematic crop.
So let's move into the audio workspace.
Go to your audio track mixer, make sure nothing is mute.
And we're going to begin by playing our video back.
So in this part where we have only two audios, it's pretty good.
I'm not going to do anything to it.
But once you enter the area where there is the voiceover, the music and different sound effects, you
want to work with the different volumes.
I do not know who I am yet.
I desperately want self-definition.
A terminology.
I'm saying something.
I feel like my voiceover is too low and increase it to five.
I who I am.
Yet I desperately want self-definition.
I do.
Track three is a little hard to hear.
Let's get 1.6.
I desperately want self-definition.
I'm trying to get us to abandon that terminology.
This one's pretty good.
Let's hear it with you.
Inconsistent.
A microphone.
I I'm not sophisticated but so audio track six can't really hear anything.
Bring that up.
I am not sophisticated, but simple, concentrated and friendly.
I'm not well trained in smile, but I can help others
see class.
Let's see.
I'm a little bit afraid that it might sound lousy to you.
I am a visitor.
All right.
So this is pretty good.
My volumes are set.
One thing that you have to do when it comes to vocals is that it might sound lousy to you is to add
something called audio ducking.
It means that whenever there is a primary sound playing the background noise or the secondary noise,
which is like our music, it needs to be lowered.
So right in the end, let's listen to it first.
I am a visitor.
So the sound of the birds and the wind is playing at a constant rate, even when our subject is talking.
So what I need to do is to just zoom right in.
And after my subject finished talking, I need to create keyframes for my two sound effects.
So let's work with the wind.
Sound first.
Make a keyframe for level at zero decibels.
Go forward and pull this up to like five decibels because our video is finished and this is our ultra.
So what happened right now is this is suddenly gets louder.
Let me just click this so I can see the space increase in space.
So it's a slow and gradual thing
where you do the same thing with the second order, you click once five decibels.
I may have to change the number later, but for now let's focus on making them louder.
And so that.
There you go.
You can also do the same thing for the music.
It's a pretty common thing.
I guess for the music we can go with a smaller number such as three decibels.
Can I bring my play there?
A visitor.
So what we did right now, it's called audio ducking.
It can also be done during your project.
So, for example, here your audio is your decibels.
You're going to reduce it to maybe negative five decibels when the person is talking and then bring
it back to zero decibels.
So that's the technique which you will have to use whenever there is a primary sound playing among all
your other sounds.
To finish off my video, I'm going to put in the cinematic crop, so grab all of your videos.
Right click next.
On this nested group, we're going to add the crop effect down to effect controls maybe 5% from the
top 5% from the bottom.
And now I have the cinematic crop.
You can add some color grading, some text.
I will leave it like this, but fade out the beginning and the end by holding down command D control
D on Windows.
Select your first command D and now it's going to fade in and then fade out.
For the end.
We can make it more dramatic and match it with the music.
So that's pretty good.
And now I have myself a really nice poetry video that I can share with my friends and family.
So the takeaways from this lesson is the importance of your primary sound and the background sound of
you ducking.
We learned about that, and now that I know the bass work of vocals, I can learn more about different
channels, how to make a more engaging video with these vocals and other effects.
So before moving on to the next lesson, let's see how the video turned out to be.
I do not know who I am yet.
I desperately want self-definition.
I am trying to get us to abandon that terminology.
I am saying something inconsistent.
I am speaking to a microphone, broadcasting my despair, but I hear no response.
I'm not sophisticated, but simple, concentrated and friendly.
I'm not well trained in smile, but always curious.
I want to help others.
I am a little bit afraid that it might sound dirty to you.
I am a visitor.


## 10. Tips for Recording Better Audios

Into today's lesson, we're going to learn about some tips and rules that you should follow when you
are recording your audios.
For most of you out there, you may not be getting the right audio result when you're recording.
You may end up with some background noise.
Your voice is not clear and you may have wondered how you can avoid getting extra sound in your audio's.
So I will be talking about all of that in this lesson.
But if you do know how to professionally record your audio, then this may not be the right lesson for
you.
So first, let's talk about the environment that you are recording in.
For most of you, it's inside your house.
Maybe it's your bedroom, a separate room, and it's just something normal that you use to record.
So not everyone has a studio, but I'm going to give you some tips today about the room that you're
recording in.
It doesn't matter what type of room it is because there are just some things that you need to follow
in order to get a perfect audio.
So first, I want you guys to analyze the room that you're recording in.
Is it an empty room?
And if so, are there any windows?
So sound bounces off the walls when we speak in an empty room.
When you try saying something in an empty room, you can already hear the echo.
So if you can hear it like that, then you can imagine what that sounds like inside your recorded audio.
So the first thing is to not record in an empty room and instead try to record in a room where there
is a lot of furniture because furniture or any other object is going to absorb the bounced audio so
that you can avoid getting an echo in your audios.
The type of furniture is important.
You're not looking to fill the room with reflective objects, but objects that can absorb the audio.
So this can be a couch, a pillow, a cushion, it can even be a bed.
So a lot of people end up recording in their bedroom because of all of these soft objects that absorbs
audio.
Rule number two is to take a look at the amount of windows that you have.
So, again, windows have glass on them and glass is a reflective thing.
So your voice will end up bouncing off from that window unless it's like a special window.
But for most people it's just a regular window and it's made of glass.
So when you speak, your audio is going to bounce off that glass and back into your microphone, causing
an echo in your finalized audio.
So if you do have a lot of windows in one room but have less windows in another, it's a better idea
to move into the second room where there isn't that much windows.
So once you're in a room that has less windows, you want to make sure that those windows are closed.
If possible, closed your curtains so that your voice doesn't bounce off from that reflective surface.
So close those curtains, close the window, and have your room filled with soft objects.
If you do not have the right furniture, let's say your room is full of cupboards, then you can just
throw in some independent soft objects, get some pillows, toss them around the room, stuffed animals,
anything that can absorb the sound and give you a cleaner idea.
If you're going to be recording audio professionally moving forward, then you can just soundproof that
room.
So soundproofing involves getting some sort of foam and putting it all over the walls or any reflective
surface.
So this is what the material looks like made of foam.
There are different types out there, so you just have to go to your local store, ask the store clerk
about these, and they'll give you some options.
So these type of materials are best for smaller rooms, but if your room is too big, then you can just
try the furniture option.
So this is the material that they use for flat surfaces, and there are some other ones for windows
and doors.
So for doors they use foams like this placed in between.
There's also these ones that go underneath the door and some expensive versions where it's like a cover
that goes on your door.
So again, you have tons of options.
You just have to see which one is better for your budget.
Now let's see how we can soundproof windows.
You can use the same foam that you bought for your doors, for the windows, too.
You can also get acoustic insulation, glass.
These will cost you a bit more.
And we have like these cover things that cover the window and the area around it.
Again, depends on your budget.
Now that we have the right environment, let's talk about technology.
So first of all, you're going to need a microphone to record your audios.
If you don't have a microphone already, then it's best to do some research on the different brands
and their functionalities so that you would be using your money for something practical.
So there are tons of different mikes out there.
We have all the different shapes.
In the end, they all record audio, but we have studio mikes, we have the ear mikes.
And depending on what you plan to do with this mic, you would be making your purchase.
So the most budget friendly microphone out there would be DH Love your microphone.
And there are the tiny ones that usually clip onto your clothing and they have a really long table so
you can use it for your camera or your phone, your laptop, your PC and so forth.
So that's the best microphone that you can get if you don't have a microphone yet.
And then once you want to pursue this audio recording in a more professional way, you can upgrade to
a studio mic, which usually looks something like this.
Studio mics can be a lot more expensive than love your mikes.
So if you don't know which one you get first, get the love your one, because it's more versatile and
it's more budget friendly later on, you can just upgrade to any other microphone.
But a studio microphones do give a high quality audio compared to love your mikes and that is exactly
why they are so expensive.
So once you have your mike, you're going to need some sort of foam to go on top.
Most of your mikes come with the phone.
It's actually called loverly or I'm not sure how you pronounce that, but they usually have these guys
on them.
But I've seen some microphones don't come with this foam, so make sure that you buy one before recording.
Putting this on just reduces the amount of background noise and only captures the primary sound so it
will capture less wind and less of whatever that is happening in the background.
Now, again, even when you record with a microphone and the foam, you will not get a perfectly clean
audio.
You're just trying to reduce the amount of work that you have to do in post-production.
So don't expect a clean audio with the right microphone and the correct foam on top.
And if you wanted to film yourself as well, like you have a camera set on a tripod, these guys are
great because if you wanted to record with the camera's built in microphone, if your camera is not
that close to you, you will get more of the background noise and less of your actual voice.
So just plug these microphones in and it doesn't matter how far the camera is away from you because
these guys have a pretty long cable.
So now you've got the room, you have the microphone, and you have basically soundproofed your room,
either using some foam or just some other furniture.
Now, let's see how we can prepare our voice and what are some things that we should avoid before recording.
So the first thing you want to do is to limit caffeine intake about an hour before recording.
So have your coffee, your tea or any other drink that has caffeine, even energy drinks have that you
want to have those drinks one hour before recording.
The reason why is because caffeine in general disturbs the mucus production and can make our throat
feel dry.
So you are going to find a need to constantly clear your throat and your voice will just not be as clear.
So that's one of the first rules of recording.
The second rule is for times when your voice is not clear for those moments, a simple glass of warm
water is going to help you a lot.
You could infuse it with some herbal teas, but the simplest format is just warm water.
You can replace it with your regular water when you're recording so that you can get a clear voice for
your audios.
You can also try mixing a little bit of honey with your warm water if you want a better result.
The third item is for times when your voice isn't loud enough, so you never want to scream into your
mic or just shout at it.
And sometimes we feel like our voice is just not coming out the way we want it to.
At times like this, try to yawn and stretch your vocal cords.
Yawning is a pretty simple thing that we all do, but at the same time it stretches the vocal cords
and you will find that after yawning, your voice will be louder and more clear.
So try doing that next time you feel like you're not getting the right voice from your throat.
Tip number four is to always breathe when you're recording.
This sounds obvious, but taking deep breaths between your recording, especially when they're long,
it's going to make sure that your voice does not shake.
You don't stammer, and you just get a clear idea.
So yawning, breathing, these are all important.
They sound really simple, but they really help.
Tip number five is to always have a script written for whatever you're recording, even when it's a
short recording.
Sometimes our mind just wanders off to different places.
We're thinking of what to say next, and this can distract us from what we're seeing now.
So have a piece of paper next to you and the points written.
You can just write every sentence or just the key points that you want to make.
And that way you are more focused on what you're actually saying rather than what you're about to say
next.
So a script is really good for you to have.
So now it's time for a recording.
There are three tips that I wanted to share with you guys now that we got the right room, the right
voice, and the right equipment.
So you want to keep a distance of around 5 to 6 inches when you're recording.
So your mouth shouldn't be too close to your mic and not too far away.
We had an experiment with that in a previous lesson, but it's important to have an average distance
from your mic so that you are getting less background noise and more of your actual voice.
So 5 to 6 inches distance and depending on what type of mic you have, the distance can change.
If you're working with these microphones, 5 to 6 inches is good, but if you're working with these
guys, then you can go closer because there is already a space between the microphone and this cover.
But if your microphone doesn't have these covers, then 5 to 6 inches.
Tip number two is to always redo with full sentences.
If you were talking and then mid-sentence, you said the wrong word instead of starting over from that
word, start over from that sentence.
Because when you're editing this, it will be hard to stitch the two together as your vocal levels change
when you're redoing that sentence.
For example, if this is the sentence that I was saying and instead of saying this, I ended up saying
this.
So it's raining today.
I messed up the word raining.
Instead of continuing from raining today, I need to continue from the beginning.
So I have to say it's raining today again so that later on when I'm editing there isn't a noticeable
jump because naturally your energy levels change when you're doing a redo.
So if I redid this from raining today, from this point on, the way that I recorded, it is different
from the way I recorded Raining today.
So if I put these two different recordings together, it will not sound like a full sentence and I will
get something like It's raining today so it's not exactly smooth.
I'm going to get a jump and that's pretty noticeable.
So instead of having it's raining today, I should have it's raining today in one flat line.
So always read you from the start of the sentence instead of mid-sentence.
The next step is to always check your recording system before recording.
This may sound obvious, but a lot of times the recording system will maybe have an issue due to the
settings that you've applied.
For example, on Mac, you have to choose the sound option down here.
But if I didn't check before recording, I may be on maybe a different output and this will result in
me having a muted audio.
So always check your system, make sure you're on the right output.
I'm sure Windows has something like this and always test to see whether or not there is audio going
inside your microphone.
Record a test audio, make sure that there isn't any hissing sounds, any buzzing sounds and your voice
is not getting cut off.
And that way, by conducting these little tests, you're going to make sure that after a maybe two hour
long recording, you get the proper output and not a muted audio and not a muted audio.
So those were some tips and tricks for recording your audios in a more professional way.
Moving forward with the lessons so you can use these tips to record the right tracks for the practice
lessons.
So I hope you guys enjoyed these tips and I will see you guys in the next lesson.


## 11. Audio Effects Pt. 1

In today's lesson, we're going to learn about some fun audio effects that you can do with Premiere
Pro.
Some of these effects are things that you might have used before, but we're going to see how we can
use it in the right situation and the results that we can get.
So I'm back in my poem video sequence that we went over a few lessons ago.
In this example, we did everything manually, but we're going to take the same audio tracks and see
how we can balance them with each other using the essential sound panel.
So I'm just going to head to the audio workspace and just reset everything.
So turn all the volumes to zero.
And if you applied any effects for the audios, remove those two.
So we're going to start from scratch.
When we are balancing the audios, make sure that there's nothing listed in any of these because we
don't want anything to interrupt our new audio adjustments.
So the first effect that we're going to look at is the noise effect.
We learned that applying it here is easier than applying it directly onto the audio track.
This is, of course, for audio tracks that you do not need to trim or split, meaning that you shouldn't
apply the noise effect directly onto things that look like this.
It's made for these type of audio.
So without any cuts and without any adjustments.
So I went ahead and recorded this voiceover using the tool inside Premiere Pro.
It's a really short recording and I happen to applied any effect to this audio recording?
Let's hear the recording.
It's raining a lot today, so we have background noise, as we usually do when we record audio.
So now instead of adding my noise in the audio track mixer, I'm going to apply the effect directly
onto my track because this audio track does not need any editing and I can just use the noise effect
to get some presets to save me time.
So let's search for the noise and the effect panel.
Drag it right above effect controls.
Right here.
This is our choice.
Choose the edit button.
And you should be seeing this window.
So we have some presets, as you can see.
I'm going to bring my play head here right now.
It's on default, going to play it back so we know what it sounds like with just 40%.
It's raining a lot today.
Looking good.
So this was pretty easy to do and we can do it in the audio track mixer as well.
So now let's take a look at the presets that we have and what they do.
So there's the default, which is the 40% that comes when you apply the effect, but then you have the
option for heavy noise reduction and light noise reduction.
So heavy means that, well, it's going to add a lot of the noise.
And this is great for situations where you have a lot of background noise and the audio is just crowded
with noise that you do not need.
So now this is what it sounds like with 80%.
It's raining a lot today, so that's pretty clean.
And instead of me experimenting with each number, playing it back, Premiere Pro just gave me this
number and I could just go with it.
On the other hand, when you record in a room that is soundproofed and you just don't get that much
background noise, you do not need 80%.
So you can go for the light noise reduction, which will just add 20%.
But on my audio where I have a lot of background noise, this may not do the trick.
It's raining a lot today.
So I can hear a little bit of that hissing sound in the back.
So if I were to export this audio now, I would be getting a perfect result.
So the heavy noise reduction is pretty good for this audio.
We also have processing focus.
We have the first option, all frequencies.
This is the default form and you should have yours on this too.
We have focus on lower frequencies.
We have mid frequencies.
Lower and higher and higher frequencies.
So it depends on your audio, really.
But by default, you should just keep it on all frequencies.
Next, we have gain if you increase this.
It's raining a lot today.
It's obviously louder.
I'm going to leave mine at zero decibels.
The seed before and after.
You can just hit this shut down button.
It's raining a lot.
To see it before, turn it back on to see the after.
It's raining a lot today.
And that's pretty good.
So this was our first audio effect.
It's pretty handy.
But again, don't use this on tracks where there is a lot of cuts.
Let me just show you what that means.
If this is my audio and I needed to make this many cuts.
Mid editing.
Premiere Pro will have to re analyze each of these files separately.
So sometimes when you export this glitch can happen that you're going to get like a feed in at the beginning
of each cut.
I recommend not risking it because let's say after 3 hours of editing, the last thing that you want
is your cut to have a fading.
So avoid doing that and use this direct technique for hole audios like this.
If you plan on cutting your audience multiple times, then you can just refer to the audio track mixer.
All right, let's get rid of this and take a look at our second effect.
So the second effect is pretty interesting.
If you want to blend a sound effect or a music into the area of the video, it would take a lot of time
to do it manually.
For example, if you have a video, we just take a look here and import some new stuff.
They are also in your resource pack, make a new bin and use stuff at the straight in.
Let's say this is my video.
So clearly we are in a room with closed windows.
So if I were to add maybe a crying sound effect, I needed to match the environment so that it looks
like the person is actually crying.
And I didn't just put a separate sound effect trying to hide the fact that we're adding additional effects
to the original video.
So we have like a crying sound effect here, going to place it right below.
Let's see what that sounds like on its own.
So the sound effect is too loud and the subject is clearly far away from the camera.
So this doesn't make any sense.
And if I were to just maybe lower the volume, that will still not give me the environmental effects
that I need.
So let's try negative nine decibels.
Again, it sounds like the actor is close to the microphone.
So take a look at the video.
Like we said, it's a closed environment.
She is she has her head down on her arm.
There is windows and the room looks pretty big.
So if you're crying in a big room and there is no one else, there will obviously be some echo.
Now, if I were to add the noise, the echo, the volume change manually, then that will take me a
lot of time.
So I'm going to introduce you to this effect surround reverb.
And this is perfect for situations like this at this directly on your audio.
And by the way, you can do this with music if you want to make it sound like it's coming from like
a speaker here, go to effect controls.
Once you apply the effect, hit.
Edit and we're going to get this window.
We have some presets in the top left and we have a lot of options.
So based on what's in your video, you would choose one of these presets.
Let's see the options we have.
We have auditoriums, center stage, concert dimensions, drum house and so much more.
But for me would have to be like in the church, literally click in once and now I can play this back.
So there's the echo that I needed, but of course it's a bit much.
So I have all these reverb settings to work with to just make this perfect, going to leave everything
as it is.
But the only thing that I will change is to remove from the surround width.
Let's try 100.
So this is what I have right now.
I got all these different settings and this is how you're supposed to change the preset.
Play it back while it's playing.
You got to work with these sliders.
So now let's take a look at it before and after we bring this back up.
This was before
this disaster.
So it needs to be a little lower than usual because she's far away.
And now I got the perfect surround reverb that I needed.
You can do this with literally anything.
Maybe.
Maybe if your subject is in a small room, you can use the small room preset auditorium, and there's
just a lot of options for you to choose from.
So these presets are really handy and you can just experiment to see which one works best.
But of course, related to what's happening in the video so that you don't get a weird sound effect.
So this was our second sound effect.
Another thing that you can add to a situation like this is something called low pass.
So this low pass effect basically muffles the music.
Usually let me get like a sad music that I can put in the back.
All right.
So I got this sad music and I'm just going to drag down.
And this is what it sounds like on its own.
Let me just change the label.
So this is the raw music placed underneath our reverb sound effect.
So it's too loud and we can barely hear the person crying.
So for situations like this, instead of just lowering the audio, there is an effect that can muffle
the audio and bring the attention to whatever your sound effect is.
Maybe someone is talking here.
In our case, someone is crying.
But when you want to shift the attention from the music to whatever's happening here, then you would
want to use this effect.
So before the girl crying, I'm going to get like a random video.
So we go from this.
So I can't have the music play at the same rate when there's no vocal or sound effect versus when there
is vocals or sound effect.
So the music needs to sound different here and different here.
So let's go to the effects menu and add the low pass effect.
Add it on top of your music.
Effect controls.
And we have something called cut off, which is basically how much of your music is taken out to make
it muffled.
So let's take a look at our default number.
And now I'm just going to reduce this amount into something way less.
Let's try 500.
Play this back.
So now it's muffled and I can just bring more attention to whatever that is above it.
So this is what it sounds like without the low pass.
This is what it sounds like with low pass.
So now that I have this muffled effect, I can use it to bring attention to the girl crying.
So let's see what it sounds like with the girl crying.
So that's pretty good.
I just need a little bit more.
So this is a lot better than something like this without lupus.
So when you don't muffle music in emotional scenes like this, the audience's attention may shift to
the music rather than the dialogue or the girl crying.
And because the scene is about the girl crying.
I cannot have everyone's attention shifted to the piano music.
So let's turn on the low pass.
And I can just make keyframes so that it's muffled somewhere, but not in another place.
So because I have nothing here, I don't really need the muffled effect.
A few seconds before our sound effect.
I'm going to make Keyframe for cut off.
Go backwards to the beginning and turn it back to what it was.
So I think it was like 1300 something.
So that's pretty good.
I just need to bring this here, actually,
so you can hear that it just gets muffled out of the blue.
So I'm going to change the second keyframe.
To 1000.
I'm sorry.
The first 1 to 1490.
Let's hear the audio.
You can even go higher than 700.
Let's try 500.
And then when your sound effect is finished, you can just bring it back to the original amount.
So make a keyframe a few seconds before the sound effect ends.
Then go forward, then increase it back to what you had before 1495, I think, and then you're going
to get the transition back to the original music.
Kind of bring it to this area so we can see the transition rather here, the transition.
So see how the audio just becomes a lot more clear as we proceed with the key frames.
So this is a really good effect to use for situations like this.
So those were some effects that you can use for your short films, music videos.
They are really helpful and you should just use each of the sliders to find the best settings for your
videos.
We're going to continue with the audio effects in the next lesson, so I will see you guys there.


## 12. Audio Effects Pt. 2

Welcome back to the lesson.
This is where we left off.
We made these different adjustments using three effects inside Premiere Pro.
Now we're going to move on with even more effects and see how we can change the way our audio sounds.
The next effect that we're going to work with concerns the channel in your audio.
So let me just bring a music here.
So pay attention here when these song plays.
Notice how these two bars just show up.
We have one on the right side and one on the left side.
So when these two bars play at the same time, you can see here it's not exactly at the same time,
but there are times where they move together.
And that basically means let me see if I can find one that moves together.
There we go.
So this audio right now is playing in one line.
Again, take a look at here.
It goes up in one rate cups, down in one rate.
So when your ideas look like this, that means that there is no dimension.
The amount of audio from the left and right channel are equal throughout the whole song.
But in our second example, when I play it back, you can see that the amount of music coming from the
left channel is different from the right channel.
So this is a music with dimension, and usually these types of musics give people a better experience.
So what if you had a music like the first example and you want to make it sound like the second example?
So I have here a I guess, flat music, and I'm going to use an effect called balance to add more dimension
to that music.
Go to the effect controls.
And we have two options one for bypass and one for balance.
So with this one, I can shift the audio towards the right channel and to the left channel because there
is a stopwatch.
I can also create keyframes so it kind of shifts left and then goes right.
We're going to learn about this in another lesson.
Or now I'm just going to teach you how we can add more dimension to audio.
Using a simple effect in Premiere Pro, let's grab the balanced slider and pull it towards the right
34 and see how the right side is now tolerant.
Let's go up even more to 100.
And now we're only getting it from the right channel.
And the left channel is completely down.
So you can just choose a number depending on what you're going for.
Going to the negative side will make it go towards the left side.
And I'm not sure if you guys can hear in the lesson you.
But if you do this yourself, you can hear a different result when you play it back.
So if you shift the balance slider all the way to 100, you should be hearing the audio from the right
side of your speaker or the right side of your headphones.
So try it yourself.
Give it a listen and you can see the difference.
So let's try shifting the audio zero.
Let's make a keyframe for zero and go forward all the way to the right, then All the way to the left.
Can I play this back?
Just pay attention here.
So I'm sure you heard that the audio was normal and then it goes towards your right speaker and back
to the left speaker.
Try this yourself and look at the result.
So this is how we can add more dimension to our audios by switching to the left and the right channels.
So that's our second effect.
Let's do this and move on to our next effect.
Our next effect is a really simple one that is four times where you want to raise your volume beyond
the default numbers.
So I'm going to get like.
This audio, The Crying Girl Sound Effect.
So let's say raising this guy up is not doing it for me, and I want it to be louder than 15 decibels.
So there's an effect for that.
We do this and it's called mastering.
So mastering just refers to your master audio and anything that you're add on here will be applied to
the entire audio.
So it's kind of like you go in here, custom setup, edit, and we have all these options.
So here there are some things that you can use to add special effects such as reducer, stereo to mono
monitor stereo warm concert hall.
Let's try this.
You can see that the equalizer changed.
Play the spec.
They tried this with the music since we already use this in previous lesson.
You get like.
At the mastering effect right on the controls edits.
So this is what it sounds like with bright hype, the first preset.
Then it hit I and oh, to set my end point and out point.
You can also set your endpoint an out point using this guide to mark end and this guide you mark out.
All right, play the spec.
All right.
So that's what it sounds like with big hype.
Let's try a different preset.
They tried Club master.
Sounds a little different, but let's go for something more extreme, like the warm concert hall.
We have some reverb applied.
Dream sequence.
We have a lot of reverb
and it just sounds a little more sharp now.
This is what it sounded like before.
So this is a effect that you will use quite often because it gives you so many options in just one window.
Once you have chosen your preset, you have the option to work with the equalizer.
So equalization or just EQ you refers to when you isolate certain frequencies within an audio and then
you either lower them or make them louder and just adjust them to make them sound different.
So equalizer here is referring to that.
You can see there are some key frames that I can just move around and right now I'm just targeting different
frequencies.
So if I just hold this here, you can see that I changed this from 69.9 decibels to 8.6 decibels.
So I'm targeting a certain frequency and making it sound different.
Let's try something really extreme.
So just by doing that, I just made the piano sound louder than the violin sound.
So I targeted the violin frequencies, made that lower than targeted piano frequencies, and made that
louder.
So this is a pretty handy window.
I'm just going to go back to one of these guys.
All right.
Once you've chosen your preset, we have some stuff in the corner.
We have reverb that we already know what it is.
It adds an echo to our audio
so we can just hear that echo going over and over.
Without echo, without reverb, this is what it sounds like.
So now we don't have any echo.
Next, we have some stuff for like tape retro, and we're just changing the way the audio sounds, essentially.
So we have Loudness Maximizer.
Let's play it back.
That's at 100.
This is at 0%.
So we're not raising the volume, which we would do in here.
This is just making it sound louder.
And just by showing you a difference, let me play it to your.
So I'm basically grabbing the lower frequencies and raising those up.
If you're raising the volume of something, then you're just raising everything at the same time.
But this is targeting a smaller section.
Thanks.
We have output gain.
This is where you get to make things louder than they usually are.
15 decibels, -20.
I can make it 15 here, 15 here, and then I'll just get a really loud volume.
Undo that to bring it to zero.
So Exciter is basically going to make your audio sound more crisp.
Let me just play it back with 0% turn back to zero decibels.
This is what it sounds like with Exciter at 100%.
So I basically took all the high tones and made them, well, sharper.
And this is actually something you would use with vocals rather than music.
We just get vocals real quick.
So going back to my voiceover and it tried the exciter on it.
And by the way, you can also grab these effects from the audio track mixer track number six.
I can go over it right here and just apply an effect right here.
So click on this one, go to special and then mastering.
If you double click on this, you're going to get the same window.
So again, if you're going to make a lot of cuts in your ad, then you would want to apply mastering
or any other effect right here.
So on this audio, let me just turn it into subtle clarity.
This is great for audience that you are speaking in.
Not exactly music, but maybe voiceovers your speech or poem or your commentary in YouTube videos.
So this is the best preset you can choose for those types of clips.
And you can see that it increased the exciter to 15%.
This is what it sounds like.
It's raining a lot today.
Let me just add a noise real quick.
It's raining a lot today.
So I have my is back to mastering if I increase my exciter all the way.
I'm going to sound like this.
It's raining a lot today, so it sounds really bad.
It's like my voice is like 1000 needles right now, so this can make your audio more crisp, but you
don't want to go overboard.
Less than 20 is good, so don't go overboard.
It's raining a lot today.
It's pretty good.
I do want to remove reverb because I don't want my voice to echo.
It's raining a lot today, but if you do want it to echo, increase it to like 40%.
It's raining a lot today.
All right.
So the Wagner is where music's going to go back in here.
It's cool to like zero.
Try these subtle clarity.
This one is also said to 15%.
But if I increase the Weidner,
it didn't exactly make the audience low, but it kind of put it kind of muffled it a little bit and
made it more flat.
So this is great for music that you want to play underneath your vocals.
So if you have a YouTube video and you're speaking over this audio, then you would want to use Wagner.
Now, again, you don't want to go above the recommended amount, which in our case was I think 15%
when you go for 17.
It's raining a lot today.
So if I were to put these two on top of each other, my vocal audio definitely needs to be louder.
Let me select this one.
Now to adjust the volume underneath a voiceover, there is a different technique.
I'm going to show you that later on.
But for now, this is what the mastering window looks like.
Pretty good for those that use audio a lot during editing.
So now let's move on to the next effect.
Close this off.
And now I'm going to show you how you can change and shift the pitch of your ideas.
So I'm just going to delete the mastering onto here.
And now we're going to look for the pitch shifter, which is right here.
You can also search it in the effects menu.
Double click on this and you're going to get this window.
So let's play this back and to mute the music.
It's raining a lot today.
This is what it sounds like now.
But when I bring this towards the right side, I'm going to make it sharper.
The ball.
So my voice is really high right now, and I just did that with one pre set.
You can go for other effects that can make your voice deeper, like the Dark Lord.
That's one I didn't want to do.
Quite literally sounds like a villain because things in the middle, like deathly ill.
It's raining a lot today.
It just made my voice deeper, but in a more believable way.
Then we have the stretch.
A 20 minute walk today sounds like a robotic audio.
So these presets are fun.
You can use it for videos where let's say you have a villain character.
You want to you want to distort your audio for music or anything else.
If you're not happy with the amount, you can always track these sliders around.
The more towards the right, the higher the pitch towards the left.
It's going to be a lower pitch.
In that back.
And that's our second effect.
Now, you can use this on music as well.
Doesn't have to be just for vocals.
Let me bring this guy here.
And show you what that sounds like.
So here's my audio.
Play this back.
Not sure what we have on.
We don't have anything right now.
Let's try the dark Lord.
So for music, you want to be really subtle.
Let's try, like negative five.
So that sounds like a scene from a horror movie.
You can work with sense and change the way it sounds.
Sounds really creepy.
Let's try the other way.
Which is Anchorage April.
So for music, I think the two middle ones are the best option because they give you a really tiny bit
of difference.
All right, so that's our pitch shifter.
It's a really fun effect that you can use.
Another way that you can use the pitch shifter is to change a sound effect.
So voiceovers in music, we saw how to deal with them.
But what if you had a sound effect?
Let me bring my sound effect.
Right here on track number one.
So this is my sound effect right now.
I'm going to mute everything else.
So that's my sound effect.
I want to turn it into an audio transmission.
So for this, I'm going to make a new sequence.
We have a lot going on.
Call it audio transmission.
In here.
I'm going to bring my crush Sound Effect.
And my cricket audio in the back.
All right, let's get lucky.
Not creepy, but something that's just unsettling.
Bring it here.
Make it look like the person is having a nightmare and they're running away.
Set this.
The frame size.
And now I want the transition to happen right here.
So before I begin, I want to make this music sound creepier so I can just use the I can use the pitch
shifter, but I don't do this audio and just choose the and use the deathly ill preset.
So this sounds pretty creepy right now.
And.
And I can take this a step further by changing the speed.
So what I can do now is to add the muffled audio effect as well.
I'll pass it right on my music effect controls and change the cutoff to 800.
Sounds really creepy.
I'm going to stop here and now work on my transition.
Right click on your crash audio.
Go to speed duration, reverse speed, and then slow it down.
Inter came and now match the cut from A to B with the end of your sound effect.
So we can actually remove the first half of the sound effect because nothing is happening.
Just get rid of it like that.
Pushes backwards.
We're going to mute my music.
And actually, when the crash starts, the video is not there.
So look at the end sound wave.
Now.
Let's hear it.
And there you go.
So maybe if you want to add tension to your clips, something crazy is happening and you want to cut
into something less crazy.
You can use this technique.
Now let's turn on the music and I'm going to add the mastering effect to adjust the levels so that it
blends in well with my transition sound.
Oops, that's the wrong one.
This one.
So let's go with.
Subtle clarity.
And then remove from the output game.
Maybe add some reverb.
And I'm going to remove from the exciter increase the whitener.
I want like a really flat music that's going on in the back.
So the attention is on the transition sound and the video.
That's pretty good.
And I'm just going to cut the music right when the transition happens.
There you go.
That's a nice tension builder that I can use to build some excitement just to make this even more horror
movie.
Like, I'm going to get a simple.
Let's type in the metro color symmetry and we have some options that we can choose from.
So it's Fuji Monochrome.
I think monochrome is suitable.
Let's add the normal contrast one.
And I'm going to switch to my Luma Tricolor panel so I can see a bigger preview.
That's pretty good.
Maybe I can put like some heavy breathing sound effects, birds, etc. But you can build tension just
like this using all of the effects that we learn so far.
So that was another set of audio effects that you can use to spice up your audios.
In the next and final lesson, we're going to take a look at the Essential Sounds panel, which will
give you a lot of options for different types of sound, whether it's dialogue music as effects.
The Essential Sound panel has you covered.
So I will see you guys in the next lesson.


## 13. Audio Effects Pt. 3

Welcome to the third and final lesson of our audio effects.
In today's lesson, we're going to take a look at the Essential Sounds panel.
So this is where we left off.
We made this tension using two different audios.
We use audio effects to turn this sound effect and soundtrack into back more creepy and perfect for
this suspenseful scene.
So now what we want to do is to start with a clean timeline.
I'm going to use the same sequence.
Then I will bring in the severe.
So this is a video of three people cheering with their beer bottles.
But I want to make it look like the party was much bigger than what it seems here.
And I can do that with some sound effects.
So I will use this sound effect, which is in your resource pack right underneath this video.
Now I want to play it back.
This is what I get.
So it sounds like there are more people around these three subjects, but it's not exactly blending
in into the room.
So it's pretty obvious that I just kept an additional sound effect underneath this video.
So we're going to be using the central sound panel, which you can just bring in by going to window
and essential sound.
This is what you will get.
Let me just make this a little organized.
All right.
So this is the essential sales panel.
So a lot of here we have to assign a tag to each of you.
So when I grab this one, you can see these guys are no longer gray and I have four options.
So now, based on the tag that I give, my audio premiere Pro will give me some presets to work with.
I just selected the previous audio, which, as you recall, was the.
So this is considered an SFX, not exactly a music or a dialogue, but sometimes you can switch these
up to get the result that you want.
For example, this doesn't really have any dialogue, but I want some of the presets that are in the
dialogue tag.
So I'm going to choose dialogue instead of as effects.
Once I do that, I can choose my preset.
Let's take a look.
And I will choose in a large room, because we are assuming that this is a party going to use my other
track.
Let's listen.
So that's what it sounds like.
You can change the dynamics, but in a lower that.
Okay, So I'm going to just keep this rather low.
Turn this much and then you can choose a preset down here.
So background, voice, intercom and so much more thing.
I'll go with background voice.
All right, We got some reverb going on.
We can increase the amount.
Which is what I want, because I want to make it look like this room that they're in is pretty big.
All right.
Once I have this, I'm just going to apply a noise because I can hear some of that background noise
and it doesn't sound right.
And when you apply something in the Essential sound panel, you're going to get a bunch of effects in
your effect controls.
So on this track, I have studio reverb, vocal enhancer, which we would need.
Graphic equalizer, dynamic processing disorder.
And then we have the noise that we just kept on.
Noises go with light to try it out.
All right, That's good.
Now let's work with our second audio.
I'm going to choose specific for this one just so we can see the different options for a preset we can
do, like from outside in a large room, close a distance and so many more, but going do a large room
because that's what we're trying to do here.
And.
So we can hear the reverb is quite big.
If it's too much for you, you can just make that smaller.
They choose make distance.
I think I'll stick with make distant.
Based on this I can choose light reverb outside reverb room.
Reverb room is the best one for my situation.
The tiered.
So now my SFX is blending well with my video again, when I go into the effect controls, we've got
studio reverb and that's it actually.
So this is what it sounded like for me.
Turn that off.
So this track
and this is what it sounds like after.
So this is going to make it look more believable when you try to blend different sound effects.
Well, let's see the before and after for this trick solo.
The trick?
And turn off all the different effects.
This is what it sounded like before.
And this is what it sounds like after.
Put together, they make a pretty believable party scene.
So that's the essential sound.
There are some other ways that you can use it, apart from making different tracks more believable in
your scene.
For example, we can just do something else with it.
We try to fix things up here, so organize my workspace.
Now I can move on to the different things that we can do with the essential sound panel.
So one of the things that you can do and you get my other sequence.
So one of the things that you can do is to take dialog.
I'm going to use the poetry sound here.
Click and drag anything that you want in one of these tags.
Then his dialogue and interpreter says, I'm going to go for from the radio.
So this track then go to preset.
Once you've chosen dialog, go to preset and choose, let's say from the radio.
Let's zoom in here and play this back.
I do not know who I am.
Getting desperately wants self-definition.
So it definitely sounds like it's on the radio.
And if you want to see it before.
This is what it sounded like before.
I do not know who I am yet.
I desperately want self-definition.
So you can do some pretty cool stuff in here because so much more like podcasts.
Voice intercom from the telephone.
Television.
Let's try television.
I'm going to make it louder.
I do not know who I am yet.
I desperately want self-definition.
So yeah, we just want to click.
I can get these special effects.
Let's go back to the default.
And depending on the tag that you choose, you're going to get a different result.
So let me choose this one, for example.
Change it from dialog to like a set of x.
The sea must choose this one.
I am not well trained in smile, but always curious.
I want to help others so your idea doesn't have to be exactly one of these things.
You can use the other options for your audio.
So this is not really an SFX, but I just used this tag to get this preset.
Let's try ambience.
From outside.
I am not well trained.
Each smile, but always curious.
I want to help others.
So it's really low and there's like a little bit of reverb.
And it makes total sense.
Let's try a wide and deep.
I'm going to increase the volume down here.
I'm not well trained.
In a smile, but always curious.
I want to help others.
So it sounds like it's coming in from like a far off tunnel just with less echo because we're on outside.
But if you put it like.
Inside a room or in a large room, the reverb will sound different.
You can even add a wind effect.
I'm not well trained.
He's smart, but always curious.
I want to help others.
So you're going to get a wind effect on your audio.
Let me just clear audio type and get back to my original audio.
All right.
So those are the different things that you can do.
You don't exactly need to have the type of audio to use it's preset.
You can just work with different presets no matter what type of audio you have.
Another thing that you can do is when you have vehicles like this, let's say this is a YouTube video
right now and I have my vocals, then I have my music.
So instead of adjusting to volume yourself, make sure that zero and you have no special effects.
So instead of adjusting this volume myself, I can just drag all my vocals.
Good dialogue.
And then in the present you can choose balanced.
Male voice which I did right here, click Reanalyze, and it's going to balance the volume throughout
the timeline.
So when I play this back, just pay attention here and you can see the different volumes as we move
forward.
I do not know who I am yet.
I desperately want self-definition.
I am trying to get us to abandon that terminology.
So instead of me playing this back over and over, trying to figure out if my volume is too loud or
too low, I can just have premium pro do it and then I can just save time.
Now let's do the same thing with music.
Let's solo the music and you can also grab the presets here.
Just go to music.
You can either go for balanced background music or smooth vocal ducking.
We learned about ducking in the previous lessons, just we didn't see how we can get an automated option.
So because I have vocals, I have to choose this one.
But if I had like a track on its own without any vocals, then I can just go with smooth background
music and a solo both of these layers, and then listen to how it sounds.
I do not know who I am yet.
I desperately want self-definition.
I am trying to get us to abandon that terminology.
You can see that the music has been lowered in a sense that I can hear my subjects speaking.
You can, of course, click on the music and you can see the dunking.
So it gains dialogue clips, which are the ones up here.
If you did not tag them as dialogue, you can just select this button.
But in my case, if I click this, it's going to duck here and then not here.
So once you have that so you can increase the sensitivity, decrease it, add to the ducking the amount,
which is how much it's going to take away from the volume of the music when the subject is speaking.
And then we have the phase revision, which is the fade from the undocked music to the docked music.
You can set them as default, and if you want to modify it yourself, you can hit generate keyframes.
Once I do this, don't let it do its thing.
I can just open this up and notice all of these keyframes.
So when my subject is speaking, you can see that the volume has been lowered until they finish speaking.
So this just goes on until my subject has finished speaking and I didn't have to do this manually.
So this is a crucial step that you need to take when you have music and vocals.
As far as effects, which are these things down here, again, make sure that you have nothing applied
to these tracks.
Let it grab them all.
Let's solo hours, effects tracks, then grab them all together.
Choose as effects, and you can choose a different preset for this.
So your video was shot in a room.
You would want to add some reverb.
I'm going to choose outside reverses.
All of my videos are shot outdoors.
Let's see what that sounds like.
So.
So there is a refurb that I need.
And now when I play the spec with all my other audios, it is going to sound a lot more natural.
Yet I desperately want self-definition.
I am trying to get us to abandon that terminology.
I am saying something inconsistent.
I am speaking to a microphone, broadcasting my despair, but I hear no response.
So because of these highs and lows, the music almost sounds like a completely different thing.
So the ducking is too much.
You can just select the track, come down here and reduce the ducking amount that's going to pull the
keyframes up.
But of course, you would have to generate new keyframes.
So now you can see they're pulled up.
This way I will not get that much of a ducking when my subject is speaking.
I do not know who I am yet.
I desperately want self-definition.
So now the music has been lowered, but at least I can hear the music when the subject is speaking.
You can do the same thing with the sound effects.
You would just have to clear the type.
Go to music and maybe have them said to balanced background music.
Too desperately wants self-definition, so I can't do that.
But then I'd have to lower the volume here since I have ducking for the music.
Who I am.
Yet I desperately want self-definition and that is perfect.
So with the presets, I save a lot of time.
It's pretty fun to use and experiment with the different effects.
And moving forward, you would want to use the central sound panel when you're dealing with different
types of audio, especially when it comes to vocals and background music.
You want to make sure that everything is balanced so that the audience can stay focused on your voice.
And when your voice is in there, they can enjoy the background music.
So this is something that you do practice with a lot.
I just shows you the basics, but there are probably some loopholes out there that you can use to get
the effect that you desire.
So now that we're done with the audio effects, let's move on to the next lesson.


## 14. Audio Panning

In today's lesson, we're going to see how we can create multiple dimensions for our audio before we
continue in Premiere Pro, I'm just going to show you some examples of multi dimensional audios.
So let's go to YouTube.
I just searched three D audio, which means three dimensional audio, but as you can see, there is
nine dimensions, 12 dimensions, even eight dimensions.
And the more dimensions, the finer the experience will be.
So pause D lesson right now, go get a headphone because the experience will be better and then return
so we can watch one of these videos.
So I'm going to go for this one.
So let's increase the audio and pay attention to the shift from the different speakers.
Wondering if after all these years you like to me to go over everything they say.
The Times of course heal here, but I am done much healing.
So you can hear that the audio is coming from different places from your speaker.
To visualize this better, I'm going to go back to the three D audio search results and this is what
it looks like.
So basically that's you.
And normally with regular songs, you're going to hear the music from these different speakers equally,
meaning that you can tell if it's coming from the front, the back, the left or the right.
But when we create multiple dimensions for an audio, we are changing the amount of volume that comes
from each of these speakers.
So let's play this back.
Rights around.
Back.
Left.
Surround, left.
Left front.
As you heard, we can make the hearing experience a lot better by changing from different parts of the
speaker.
So this is great If, let's say, for example, you have a car or a vehicle passing by.
You want the if the car's here, you want it to be on the right side of your audiences.
Speaker And then slowly make its way to the left side.
By default, it's going to sound normal, like it's all going to come from the center no matter where
the car is.
But when we add audio pending in our editing, it's going to make not only the video more professional,
but it's going to make it more enjoyable because the people who see your video are going to experience
something different and something really exciting.
So they can have maybe a bird in the right side of their speaker and have the plane on the left side.
So let's jump into Premiere Pro and see how we can do that.
So before we get started with how we can turn our audio multi dimensional, I'm going to tell you the
difference between stereo audio and mono audio.
So when you're downloading audio, you come across these two terms and it's really important to know
what each of them are and what the difference is.
So this right here, you can see there's two levels of audio.
There's one down here and one up here.
If you look at the corner, there's one label R and another one labeled L.
So that's the left and right channels of the audio and whatever comes in front of R is the stuff that's
coming in from the right side of the speaker.
We have the same situation for left.
When I play this audio back, you can see that both of these bars go up on the right side and on the
left side
they don't go up at the same rate.
There is a little difference and I have the option to solo the right channel or the left channel just
by hitting the SE on the right side.
I can now listen to what's underneath here.
I can do that with the left side to.
So because there is audio coming from the left and right channel, this is a stereo audio.
So now what does a mono audio look like?
So mono on its own means singular, and that means that I only get one of these bars.
Let's grab another audio, which is stereo.
But in Premiere Pro, you can turn an audio from stereo to mono.
Just select your audio right click.
Audio channels and you're going to get this window.
So media source channel, by default, it's on left and right, but you can just have one of these channels.
So I can only keep one of these.
Let's choose L And now there's only one row of sound waves.
You can see the difference.
This is a stereo audio and this is mono.
Just by importing your audio with your premiere pro, you can tell the difference.
Now which one should you choose for your videos by default, Stereo audio gives your audience a better
experience because it's more dynamic.
You're going to get audio from the left channel and the right channel.
So when the audience puts a headphone on, they can get the full experience.
But with a mono audio, let me play this back.
They will only hear it from the left side of their headphones and that can just not be as fun unless
you are doing something specific, like let's say a smart so I can just turn this back.
Into stereo.
You can also switch the different sound waves.
You can preview it here.
So this is what's coming up from the left side.
This is what's coming out from the right side.
And now I am back to stereo.
So now let's move on with learning how we can make our audio multidimensional.
I'm going to focus on this audio.
So with the examples that we saw, there is like a circular motion with the audio channels, meaning
that if this is the left channel and this is the right one, the audio is kind of traveling around.
And since you're in the center, it's like the audio is just dancing around you.
So that's really easy to do.
In Premiere Pro.
Just go to your audio workspace because it's easier.
And then instead of grabbing the balance effect that we learnt about, there is actually something else
that we can use.
So on your audio track, just scrap this show keyframes button, click it once, scroll down to track,
pin or balance.
So this will just bring this guy down.
But what you're doing here when you make keyframes is that you're switching between the different channels.
So let's play this back.
Right now, it's on the right side because we brought it all the way down.
But if I bring it upwards,
it's going to be on the left side.
If you put it in the middle, it's zero.
It's going to be equal.
So just play your music forward and maybe before one of the beats make a keyframe at zero.
So it's playing normally until here and then.
And then a few beats forward.
I'm going to make a keyframe.
Let's count three more beats.
Another one here, three more beats here.
So now, once I made my keyframes, I can pull this guy all the way down to pull it towards the right
channel, have it go back to the left channel by dragging this up.
So when I play this back page engine here.
So it's normal here.
Right, left, normal.
I'm going to delete all those keyframes.
This time.
I will have more space between the keyframes.
Make one here.
And now I can just do this.
Make another one next to the.
Key frames so that it stays on the right channel for a little bit before moving on to the left channel.
Another way of creating these keyframes is by grabbing the pen tool.
Just click on any of these and just make.
A more free form selection.
Of course, not like this, but instead of clicking the keyframe button, you can just grab the pen
tool and just like this, you get to switch between the two channels within your audio.
Now let's see how this would be applied to sound effects.
I brought in some videos and different sound effects.
Let's turn the old ones into a bin.
And then make a sequence from your first video.
So over here, there is already an audio.
But what if you didn't like this audio and you want it to sound different?
It's going to hold down option or alt click on the audio part only and just push it to the side.
So now over here, I can just make my own sound effect using the stuff I have.
So I have this exploration sound effect and because these guys are sport cars, this will do nicely.
I'm going to drag this underneath my video.
Let's take a look.
So what we want to do now is to match the sound to when the car actually shows up.
Let's mute it for a second and see where the first car comes in, where it's closest to the camera.
So I guess right around here, I'm going to have it be the loudest.
Hit em on your keyboard to mark this and repeat this for all the other cars.
There's the other one.
So there's all my cars.
I'm just going to leave these guys before later.
But let's begin with the first car.
So right around here, I need to make everything the loudest.
I'm going to go down here.
Try.
PENNER balance.
Before the car shows up here.
It's all the way in the back, which means that it should be on the left side of our ear.
Grab your pen to make one in the beginning.
And one here, then another one to decide.
So the first keyframe, we want it to be on the negative side.
So -100.
The other one.
We want it to be that positive 100.
So basically it needs to be on the negative until the car shows up to bring it a little closer.
If you want, you can grab a ruler.
Command are or control are on windows and then grab a ruler.
So, you know, when you should switch between the two channels.
So before the car reaches this, it needs to be on the left channel.
So I just.
Pull my keyframe closer.
Let's zoom in here.
Bring it closer at -100 when it's crossing this line.
It needs to be like this, but then it needs to be on the right side until it leaves the video.
All right.
Let's give it a listen.
So it goes from the left and then it comes to the right.
So once we have that set, we now need to work with the distance of the audio because the car is coming
all the way from there and then all the way here.
So for this, I'm going to use the low pass effect.
Switch back to clip keyframes, your balance keyframes are still there
and then go to effect controls.
Let's see when the car is on the right side.
You want to make a key frame for cut off.
But before that, it should be lowered.
So we want to less of that audio.
Let's try 500.
There you go.
So you can look at your key frames here.
So I'm going to start the first key frame here.
Basically, move this towards the side.
There we go.
Let's play this back row for the second keyframe.
We're getting this muffled effect, and therefore I want to add to my audio.
Now that sounds better.
The more you add, the more crisp it's going to be.
So just increase that amount.
And that's a lot better.
So once you have the base work ready, I'm just going to.
Extend my timeline and basically duplicate this.
For as many markers that we have.
So this is our first marker.
I just brought it back to my balance keyframes.
This is the first marker to match this.
Here.
It's actually go back to keyframes and duplicate this for as many cars that we have.
I'm just going to focus on four cars, but you can just duplicate for as many cars that you have.
Once you've done that, you're going to grab all of these key frames and.
And look at their balance keyframes.
All right.
So the second car, which is audio two, I'm going to solo this track and just take a look at when the
car comes in.
So until here, it's at the left side.
It's kind of similar to audio one.
So I'm just going to mimic the key frames here.
It's the closest to the camera, and then it just leaves the scene here and needs to be on the left
side.
Closest to the camera.
Bring it down.
Have it on screen until around here.
Match the key to the movement of the car.
So just repeat this with all the other tracks solo them use the pen tool to create keyframes.
Once you're done with the balanced keyframes, go back to clip keyframes and copy and paste the low
pass effect.
Adjusting the keyframes if necessary.
And then we can move forward with the video.
So I edited all of my audios for four of the cars, and this is what it sounds like.
So I just hit on the section where the last car passes by and be sure to click on this guy and enable
loop.
So you can just practice with a few cars rather than all of these guys.
But if you did want to do it for every single car, the process will be the same.
So I have all of my cars.
I use the balance keyframes and the low pass effect to one change two channels throughout the timeline
and to muffle the audio according to the distance of the car to the camera.
And by the way, for a low pass, you have to pay attention to the car because the camera is here.
Right.
So on the second car, for example, it's a little bit further away towards the right side.
If you kept 8000 for the second keyframe on low pass, then for the second car you have to put maybe
5000 or 6000 because there is a distance between this car and that car.
But all the other cars that are on the same lane, you don't need to do that.
So if there was another car on the third lane, you would have to put maybe 4000.
So just pay attention to the distance of the cars.
Now, to finish this off, we're going to take a look at the other things inside this video.
So there's obviously a large crowd in there cheering when the cars are passing by.
So I have this sound effect that I'm just going to place underneath all of these audios.
So now the audio is good, but I'm going to use the essential sound to add the outside reverb.
So grab it as effects presets make decent.
Let's increase the volume.
So I'm going to make one distant for those people and then duplicate the sound effect for the people
that are closer.
Option or alt click and drag down, then let go.
On this one, we want light, reverb or outside reverb.
But the audio needs to be louder.
And to make this a little bit more dynamic, I'm going to maybe offset the top trek.
So the two tracks are not identical.
And now we have a pretty good idea that I created from scratch using the different channel Keyframes,
Low Pass and the Essential Sound panel.
So when you have your own video and you just don't like the sound that was cut with the camera, you
can use these techniques to recreate the sound in a better way.
If you want, you can maybe add some wind, some maybe birds in the back and really make your audio
more dynamic.
In the next lesson, we're going to see how we can create a 3D audio experience using different sound
effects, background music, and maybe some vocals.
So I will see you guys in the next lesson.


## 15. 3D Audio Example 1

Welcome back.
Now we're going to take a look at how we can create 3-D audios with what we have learned so far.
So I have some sound effects and some clips that I will use for this lesson.
You can find all of these in your resource pack, download them, import them into your project, and
then we can get started.
Let's begin with our first example.
Which is of this city landscape.
Make a sequence with your video.
There's no audio here, so I can just get rid of that by holding down option or alt clicking on it,
then hitting backspace.
So this video has no audio and I just need to analyze it myself and list down to things that I would
hear if I was in the situation.
My first sound effect is city ambience.
Drag this underneath your video.
And now let's see how that sounds like.
It sounds okay, but there are some problems.
First of all, the audio is too loud and the camera is clearly far away.
Second of all, I'm hearing cars passing by way too quickly, and that's not corresponding with what
I see on the screen.
So let's leave this in and bring in our next audio and then we can work to make it sound appropriate.
So I'm going to keep that in mind and bring in my other audios.
I have car horn.
That's something that you will hear in a situation like this.
Next, we have highway traffic cars.
And then we have car pass by.
All right.
So I have all of these different audios, and when I played them all at the original format, this is
what it sounds like.
So this is my base work.
I have aligned all of my sound effects and now before I adjust everything to the way it should be,
I'm going to just duplicate a few of these audios, maybe adjust the duration, fade some of them out,
and just make everything ready for when I want to add a tag to my tracks.
So for the car horn, I definitely want more than one click on that audio alter option and just duplicate
this a bunch of times.
Next we have car passing by.
Duplicate this two in a really random way.
You don't want anything to have rhythm or be predictable.
Next, I have this really long audio.
I'm going to cut it around here.
Get rid of the excess command edge to add crossfade transitions.
Do the same thing with the top audio command edge.
And there we go.
So now all of these audios are fit for this video.
Let's play it back.
So that's what it sounds like.
It's not perfect, but we're going to work with it now.
So the first audio is just the ambience.
Which definitely needs a little bit of reverb, and we can do that by clicking it here.
Essential Sound Panel as effects preset make distant outside Reverb.
So that sounds a lot better.
If it's too low for you, you can just work with the volume.
All right.
So that's my first audio.
The second audio involves the horns.
I'm going to solo this track.
Horns are just coming directly from those cars, so it cannot be this loud.
And we definitely need some reverb.
Grab all of your audio.
Label it as maybe dialogue.
Let's see what we can do here.
But medium shot, let's play this back.
Let's try this preset
that is better.
Let's just increase clarity.
Just work with the different sliders.
Then increase the volume and we should be good to go.
One last thing is to add a crossfade to all of these audio's command edge or any other shortcut that
you have.
And now they're going to fade in, then fade out.
If you want, you can stack different audio tracks on top.
And just create more dimension and pull these two audios down, duplicate one of these horns and have
it play maybe underneath one of these guys to make it sound a bit different.
I can grab the pitch shifter effect.
In fact, controls.
And just increase the pitch.
So when these two play at the same time, they sound different.
You can also work with the speed.
Speed, duration.
Let's go for like 70.
I'm just going to maintain audio pitch.
So if you want, you can duplicate and place on top of each other.
Just to make it sound like there are more cars honking at the same time.
All right, there's my honking audio.
Now we can move on to the next one, which is, I believe, just.
Just cars.
All right.
So the essential sound panel, I'm going to go for on Beyonce this time.
And let's go for like from outside.
Outside on Beyonce, you can add a wind effect.
Let's try both.
So this is outside.
This is when defect.
I think the first one sounds better.
We can increase or decrease.
Play it back and work with these slider.
That is looking good.
Let's work with the final audio.
For this one.
I want multiple audios.
Let's put one here.
And duplicates many times, making the distance between each one really random.
So it doesn't sound that predictable.
Grab them all.
Manage.
Then we can choose ambience or SFX.
I'm going to go for wide and deep outside Beyonce.
There you go.
Increase the volume if necessary.
And now I have myself a good base to work on.
Let's duplicate the high pitch horn, maybe reverse it so it doesn't sound identical.
Let's do it one more time here.
So once I have this, I can just take a look at how it looks on the video.
So the video itself, you can see that it's, first of all, a drone shot and the drone is moving in
from afar and getting closer to the cars.
So we need to animate the sound and volume as the drone gets closer to the cars.
So we need to create some keyframes and match them with the movement of the drone.
But the thing is that we need all of these audios as we organize them.
So we would have to kind of nest our audios.
The problem is that you can't really nest audios in Premiere Pro.
So we're going to have to do some additional things in order to just group all of these audios together,
maintaining the order and all of the effects.
So let's move to the editing workspace.
And bring our project panel over here.
We're going to make a new item for adjustment layer.
Then bring it on your video.
Make sure that the duration matches your audios.
Now we're going to grab our audience whole downshift and choose the adjustment layer.
Right click.
Why do you click Nest?
Let's call this audience.
Hit.
Okay.
And then delete all of your audios and the next.
Are you going to bring the Knesset clip inside and just get rid of the video track, leaving us with
the nested audio?
If I play this back, you can see that we have our audio.
So now, instead of adding the finalized effects to each of those tracks, I can just do it once with
this nested technique.
So the effect that I will use for this is a low pass added to your nested audio.
And now, based off the movement of the camera, we're going to create key frames.
First of all, play this back and see if it's clear enough.
So this is a little muffled I'm going to add to cut off.
All right, so when we're closest to the cars.
I'm going to make a key frame for this number.
The higher the better.
But I will keep mine around 8000.
Then around here I want to remove from this number.
So maybe 500.
Let's try 1500.
So as we get closer to the cars, the muffle effect will be less.
The second effect concerns the volume of all of these sounds.
Look for volume.
Add it on top.
And again, when we get close, we want to set a key frame for zero decibels.
At the beginning, we want to go with like negative ten,
maybe -20.
So as we get closer, the sounds just get louder.
And that's precisely what we need.
Another effect is the reverb effect surround reverb.
Set controls.
And choose the great outdoors.
Work with the sliders, and then when you're finished, we can close this off.
So this is how you can stack different audios on top, nets them and make it fit for the environment
that the video has.
In our second example, we're going to take a look at how we can create a more dynamic sound effect
and maybe have different sounds come from the right channel and different ones from the left.
So this was a more general example, but with all the different things that we applied, it definitely
made things more dynamic than if we were to have just the traffic sound effect.
So if we only had this, it wouldn't be that good.
Therefore, adding different ideas on top, working with the different settings can give us a really
natural sound effect.
So I'll see you guys in the next lesson where we take a look at our second example.


## 16. 3D Audio Example 2 Pt. 1

So now let's work with our second example and create a three dimensional audio for our video.
I have this video right here, which is of nature.
We are in a forest and we're slowly moving forward.
This video doesn't really have an audio.
So this is a perfect opportunity for me to use what we learned and make a really fun experience for
my viewers.
Let's get rid of the audio and begin examining our sound effects.
So the selection of sound effects is totally optional.
It depends on what kind of mood you're trying to create here.
But I went for like a mystical forest kind of mood.
So I have things like wind chimes, a lullaby, birds and all the other things.
This is the first sound effect.
We have some bell sounds in the distance, some birds, the wind and a bunch of other things.
The second audio is the Force Lullaby.
We have a tropical jungle Sound effect.
And finally, some wind chimes.
There's also this bird voice sound effect, and this is optional, but I want to do like a channel switch
throughout my video.
If you want to follow along, make sure that your make sure that your audio is clean and we have these
breaks in between each sound.
So I can use these breaks to switch between the left channel and the right channel.
All of these videos and audios are inside your resource pack, so download them, import them and now
we can get started.
So my main audio is the lullaby.
I'm going to put this right underneath.
So if you have a main music, you want to put it in first, adjust the duration, faded out, fade it
in, and then once you're done with those adjustments, you can move on with the rest of these sound
effects.
So I had the opportunity to split my audio since there was a pause right here.
Grab your audio command edge to fade the audio in and then out.
And now to match the video's duration with the audio, we can simply slow it down.
Let's try 80%.
Then command DNA with to just add a simple cross dissolve transmission.
Going to stretch the cross dissolve at the end.
So it matches with the audio.
There we go.
So once I have my main audio, I'm going to start layering the different sound effects.
So I'm going to add the first one right below.
Let's label this solo, this track,
and that's pretty good.
So we're just going to switch between the two channels for this audio just to create that surround effect
that we talked about in the effects panel.
Look for look for the channel volume effect added onto that audio track.
The fact control at.
Let's extend this and focus on the key frames.
So we have one for left, one for right.
If it's on positive 15.
It's going to be mostly on the left side.
But if you want it to be fully on the left side, you need to remove from the right volume.
So that's how you can switch it, turn them back to zero.
And now I can begin putting in my key frames.
So until here, let's zoom out.
First, let's cut the audio so we don't get everything.
Command Ich.
Extend the fade a little longer because we have more stuff going on in this audio.
All right.
Let's go back.
So this is the full span of my audio.
Now, throughout this, I'm going to make two key frames.
One four left at full capacity and one for right at the negative capacity.
So it's always going to be like this.
It goes to the left.
Then we're going to switch these to.
So it's going to be full capacity here and then negative here.
Again, we're going to copy these two command C, move forward to Command V.
You just pushed him a little forward.
So everything is nicely balanced.
Now, copy these two key frames.
And just paste it until the video finishes.
You can grab and change the spacing.
And now this is what we have.
Pay attention here and see the difference in the two different channels.
So this is how we can kind of create that circular effect the three RD ideas have.
You can work with the spacing of these and just make it perfect and to delete the last one.
Grab the rest of the key frames except the first ones.
Pull it back.
Hold down.
Command or control.
Get rid of the next set.
Pull the others back.
This way I can create some space and have the transition go on for longer.
There you go.
So once I have my 3-D audio, I can just close this off.
And click away.
So I'm done with this second jungle ordeal.
Now, moving on to the third one, we have the bills.
Drag this right below.
Let's label our audio before moving forward.
So for this one, I'm going to.
Cut it from one of the breaks and then bring this right underneath.
Cut the Xs off and just trim this like so.
So for this one, I'm going to kind of have one set play on the right side only.
And the other sets play on the left side.
Let me just solo the tracks.
So we have different bells right now, but I'm just going to grab them.
One of them go to the audio workspace.
You see the track mixer?
This is track number three, so I'm just going to pull it all the way towards the left.
This one will be pulled all the way towards the right.
So now it's a lot more obvious that one is coming from the right and one is coming from the left.
If I solo one at a time.
That was the right one.
This is the left one.
Play them together.
And we have this really crisp, surround experience.
Cleared with my jungle audio.
And that's sounding a lot better.
All right.
Let's take a look at our next audio.
There you go.
So it's like a distant bell.
Some birds in the back going to have this right underneath.
Label it.
So grab your audio and tag it with the tag that you want.
Now that we know most of the presets, you can choose whichever you prefer.
You can also go up here so you can avoid going into a different view.
Can quickly see two different presets.
Let's try from outside.
So this track.
Let's decrease the amount.
That's pretty good.
You can also increase the volume down here.
Let's get rid of the excess command etch and fade it out quite a bit because the audio itself does not
fade out.
All right.
We forgot to fade out the bells.
For these guys.
We got to increase the weight quite a bit because the bills are sharp from the beginning till the end.
All right.
Let's take a look at what we have so far.
We still didn't adjust the volumes, but but we did do some adjustments.
I also want to do something with my lullaby audio.
So for this one, I think we can create some channel volume keyframes.
Just like how we did with the Nature audio.
So I'm going to extend the view here and just look for the different vocals that de person has.
So we had like a humming.
This was the high pitched.
It lowers down here before going up again.
So over here I can turn it towards the left channel all the way and remove from my right channel.
Here again, there's a pause before she starts singing again.
So this time we're going to switch, right?
Will be 15 decibels left will be -281 or just negative infinity.
We're going to let this go until this other drop.
So left becomes 15 again.
This becomes negative to 81.
And then finally, we're going to go to the opposite side.
So just copy the middle keyframes.
If you want the transition from each of these key frames to be smoother, you can grab them.
All right, click.
And change them to like out of his ear.
This way we're going to get like a smoother transition between the left and right channels.
Let's give it a listen.
All right.
That's looking pretty good.
If you want, you can switch to different positions.
Just be sure to put on some markers Before you do that, Select my audio, hit em, and just switch
the position of these key frames.
Because it feels like when she's singing, we're not getting her full audio to do the same thing right
here.
Switch things up.
And let's see where the last audio is.
There we go.
So this is the last one.
Let's see how it turned out.
Pretty good.
We can also change the key frame amount.
So if -218 is too much, we can go for like -15.
Just to keep things mellow.
This is all up to your preference.
There's no magic formula here, so just experiment with the different numbers.
I'm going to try the -15 positive 15 solution.
And see if that gives me a better result.
All right, let's hear this.
Okay.
I like this a lot better, so I will stick with -15, positive 15.
Let's bring this back up.
And now I got around five rows of audios.
Believe we have some more.
We have some bird voices, which, again, is a clean audio, meaning that I can just cut it.
Have one come from the right channel, one from the left channel, and make the audio experience better.
So the bird track.
Let's change the color first.
Let's take a look at these sound waves.
I'm just cutting after each of these sounds.
All right.
So I have this many cuts and we're going to add the same channel volume effect, which we already have.
And I'm going to have one of these guys fully on the left channel and the other one under right channel.
So all of these have the channel volume, but we can just.
But we can just right click and fix the channels there.
So if you look at the audio, there are two floors of sound waves, floor, one floor to select it,
right click audio channels.
And I'm just going to keep the left one on this one.
Okay.
Now, this should only come from the left side.
They open this up,
do the same thing with the other one just on the right side.
So change this to right.
Now this will be on the right side.
Repeat this with all of this alternating from left to right.
And this will give us a funnier experience.


## 17. 3D Audio Example 2 Pt. 2

When you're done.
The symbols down here should be l.
L.
R.
R.
L.
L.
R.
I also deleted the extra one that we have here, and when I play this back, I'm going to get these
sounds from one channel at a time.
Just be sure to create some space between these audios.
So that the change in channels would be a lot more noticeable.
Yes.
We won't be needing these to.
So now I have this going on.
If you want, you can hit s on your keyboard or just or just disable snap timeline here so that you
can move these guys around a lot more freely.
I don't need to fade these out because like we said, this is a clean audio and the start and the finish
does not involve any noise.
All right.
Let's play all of this back and see how well we did.
All right.
Just for the last bird sound, I'm going to hit command edge.
Get rid of the first fade and just increase the second one so that after the video finishes, we don't
get any bird noise.
All right.
One last thing that I want to add in terms of sound effects is the sound of leaf getting pushed away.
Because when we play this back, I can see that there like some leaves getting pushed out as the camera
is moving forward.
So I'm just going to get that real quick and we can put it inside the video.
I have this leaf sound effect.
Which would make sense in this environment since the person is stepping on leaves and he's passing through
different leaves.
So we're going to have that.
Just go to the Essential Sound panel.
Grab your audio.
Let's try SFX.
And see what we can do.
Make close up.
So there's a difference.
I'm just going to duplicate this.
Because this is underneath all of these audio's duplicate won't be that noticeable.
Just to label this as something else.
Just over here.
I want to maybe add a normal keyframe for level underneath volume and turn it to a.
To the negative side so that it kind of blends in into the second audio.
It's too fast.
You can just pull it backwards.
Make another one for 0%.
Delete the old one and now it's going to fade out.
And this second audio is going to fade in.
To make it smoother, I'm going to make a similar transition here.
Get rid of the ex's command etch.
And again, because this audio is just loud, you want to have the constant power effect lasts a little
longer.
All right.
Looking good.
Let's play it all back.
And see what we got.
Okay.
I think I'll delete the last bird noise.
It's a little too distracting.
Just hit command edge on the last bird noise and get rid of the first one.
The first transition.
And for the bird sound effect.
I was thinking of doing something different rather than just a left and right channel.
Maybe we can try upper right, bottom left and make it more dynamic, because for all the other ideas
we have, the left and right situation.
So for the bird, we can try like maybe front back, upper left, bottom right.
All right, let's grab our first bird effect.
Increase this right here.
Let me just turn all the audio back to stereo.
Play it back.
Check here.
And what we're going to do is to work with the different channel volumes.
So if you want to make something opera right, or just not on the left or the right side, but in between,
you want to add a combination of left and right.
For example, if you want to do bottom left, we're going to have to add just bring it towards the left
side, but not all the way to -281.
So maybe we can try 17 -17 and four, right?
We can add a small amount like.
Ten.
Let's hear it.
So now this is on the upper right.
Try to visualize that yourself.
And when I play it back, you can see that we get mostly right and a little bit of left.
Let's try -24.
Left.
Back.
So this is opera, right?
Right now.
And.
If you want to make it, just bring it more towards the upper side.
You would have to reduce from the right.
So I guess five so -24 left positive, ten four.
Right.
Never getting a upper right effect.
So I went with -30 and positive ten.
So this is like upper right or the second one we're going to try the opposite.
So it will be positive.
Ten four left, -34.
Right?
So this is upper left can actually try this on the next audio.
So there's a variation ten four left, -34 right now to try bottom left, we're going to have to add
maybe five, four left and negative ten.
All right.
So this is bottom left right now.
Can I repeat this here, but with the opposite.
So here it was positive.
Five four left.
It needs to be negative ten here for left positive for positive, five for right.
This is upper right,
bottom left.
Bottom right.
Upper left
and four back.
I guess we can do like negative ten for both.
You can even do lower.
Let's try -20 loops.
Just make sure that the number is equal
and that it's on the negative side.
If we had another one, I would do front, which would be like positive 20, positive 20.
So when you mix the numbers in, you're going to go for a different direction.
And depending on the number, it would be upper left.
Upper right.
Bottom.
Left.
Bottom right.
And like we said, back would be negative numbers, but equal for both.
Front will be positive numbers equal for both.
All right.
So now this is a lot better, in my opinion, but you can go for any number.
It's really up to personal preference.
Let's play this back.
That sounds a lot better.
Now.
All I have to do is to work with the different volumes.
You could use the essential sound panel, but I'm just going to keep it simple with the audio track
mixer.
Let's extend it.
So I can see all of my tracks.
So our dear one is our music.
It needs to be the loudest.
The second audio is the jungle sound.
Pull the ruler away, then adjust the different volumes as I go.
All right.
Pretty good.
Now, I have a different volume set
now for the bird noises.
One thing that I don't like is that it's really sharp and it sounds like the birds are right next to
the camera, which is not true.
So once you have assigned the volume, we're just going to grab all of them here and just choose whichever
tag you want.
I'm going to go with dialogue.
Something that can pull the bird noises away from the camera because birds are in the sky or high up
in the trees.
Make distance.
Let's play this back.
Pretty good because I want more of a echo.
So let's go with, like, in a large room.
Close repair.
Here is our reverb.
Let's play the spec.
Increase the reverb.
This all the way.
And for the loudness, I'm going to hit automatic.
This is going to take a look at all of your audios and then adjust the volume depending depending on
the rest of your audios.
Auto Match.
So this.
It's.
So you can see with the reverb, we made it quite distant
and that is sounding pretty good.
I tried church.
Maybe this is better.
So that's the echo I need.
Going to repeat this with the bells.
Let's assume the bells are up in the trees too.
And not right next to the camera.
For this one.
I guess we can do like.
Let's see.
In a large room.
So the bells.
Add to the reverb amount.
This is before the reverb.
This is after.
It's a lot less loud.
It has the echo and it's just perfect for this situation.
All right.
So I have all of my audio set.
This is optional, but I'm going to add like a glow effect on top of my video just to add to this magical
fortress effect.
Duplicate your video.
Look for Gaussian blur added to the duplicate.
State control and.
20 points change the blending mode to maybe.
Right.
So we get that glow.
To add to this
26 is good and we can create keyframes 26% here.
Before that, I'm going to have a higher number.
And there we go.
So I made my audio more dynamic or 3D by adding some channel keyframes, some reverb.
And in the end, I created a really fun experience for my audience.
This is a really helpful way to make your videos more engaging, especially if it's like a travel video
or your vlog.
Instead of putting a flat music, a flat voiceover, you can try to add these three D audios and make
the experience more cinematic for your audience.
So I hope you guys enjoyed this lesson.
Let's see how the video turns out.


## 18. What Makes a Good Commercial

So we're almost done with the audio category, and pretty soon we will be editing a commercial from
scratch.
But before we get into that, it's important to know what makes a video engaging and how we can get
the best results by following some simple rules.
In today's lesson, we're going to take a look at those rules, see some examples and learn exactly
what makes a video good and what makes a video bad.
More specifically, we're going to be focused on commercials.
But these rules generally apply to all types of videos, whether it's a montage, documentary, short
film or any video that you want to edit needs to follow a few rules.
So we make videos to deliver messages.
These messages could be anything.
It could be related to a product.
It could be to send news about a certain event.
It could be a collection of memories, a inspirational message, or just anything else that you want
to be delivered to the audience when they watch your video.
But if you do not use the correct editing techniques or composition techniques.
Your audience will not learn of this message.
Maybe halfway through it you're going to click away or just not watch the video at all.
So with that in mind, let's learn about the first concept of video editing, and that is storytelling.
What are you trying to tell your audience and do you have the right materials to tell that?
So just like a book, a video needs to have a story.
And just like any other story, a video needs a start, middle and end.
Also, it could be a exposition, climax and resolution.
So you're basically giving something to the audience by the time they finish your video.
This could be, like we said, an important message, a motivational quote or anything else, really.
So storytelling is really important in video, and you want to tell a narrative in the best way.
If you just take a look at any of the movies you've watched so far, there were some movies that really
caught your attention.
You couldn't hit Pause and you just wanted to find out what happens at the end.
On the other hand, there are movies that were just really boring and you couldn't even sit through
maybe 20 minutes.
So you don't want your videos to be like those boring movies and instead have all of the techniques
that we learned so far and some new ones that we're going to learn in the future.
Combine those in your video editing in order to keep your audience engaged.
So by default, the audience out there has a few seconds for your videos, meaning that from the moment
that they click on your video, they will just dedicate maybe around less than 10 seconds really, to
see whether or not your video is worth watching.
So you have a small window to grab their attention and therefore you want to use that in the best way.
So let's talk about rhythm in video editing.
Rhythm talks about the cuts in your videos.
How often do you change from scene to scene and how long are those cuts?
The general rule is that the shorter the cut, the more tension is built.
The longer the cut.
The more peaceful that scene is.
And by peaceful, it could also mean that you're asking the audience to pay attention to what's happening.
So an example, when there is like a fight scene, there's a lot of cuts we get like the two characters
fighting from different angles.
Cuts could be like 2 seconds, 3 seconds.
And because of all these cuts and the epic music in the back, you can feel the tension and you're starting
to get excited to find out who wins at the end.
And as the editor, your job is to keep that tension with those fast cuts, different angles and the
sound effects and music.
On the other hand, if your scenes are longer, you're asking the audience to pay attention to what's
happening.
So now let's take a look at some visual examples and see exactly how the length of cuts can change the
way we feel when we watch certain movies.
So here I have a scene from the movie Inception, and I want you guys to pay attention to the sound
effect, the music, the cuts and the vocals, which in this case would be the voice of the actors.
So notice how there was a lot of cuts from different angles.
There was a bike next to the vehicle and we get to see the scene from different angles along with the
epic background music.
It really helps build tension.
As the fight gets more complicated, we get more cuts, sound effects, the music gets louder and detention
just continues.
So if you want to build tension in your videos and you just want your audience to be excited as to what
happens next, you want to put in a lot of cuts.
Now let's see what longer cuts look like and where you should use them.
So here we have a scene from the movie Pulp Fiction.
And again, I want you guys to pay attention to the duration of each cut if there is any music Sound
Effect.
And of course, the dialogue.
17.
The path of the righteous man is beset on all sides by the inequities of the selfish and the tyranny
of evil men.
Blessed is he who, in the name of charity and goodwill, separates the weak through the valley of darkness,
for he is truly his brother's keeper and the finder of lost children.
And I will strike down upon thee with great vengeance and furious anger those who attempt to poison
and destroy my brothers.
And you will know my name is the Lord.
What I lay my vengeance upon thee.
So the character was delivering an important speech.
You can see right here, this is what they were talking about.
And these shots were longer.
So when the shots are longer, the audience are just focused on what the person is saying.
And also notice that there was no background music.
We weren't hearing a piano in the back.
And therefore we get the silence of the speech and just keep the audience's attention on what the dialogue
is about.
So we didn't get like a cut to a different room.
We had everything here, but there were some cuts showing the different reactions of the characters.
So throughout the scene, the speech wasn't interrupted, but we did get cut to the other character's
reaction.
The subject was speaking from the start to the end, but we get different angles showing the importance
of what the person is saying.
And then near here where the I guess, final delivery happens, we get a closeup up and this is really
important.
When the subject is saying something important, you want to make sure that there's nothing distracting
and the focus is just on the emotion of the character.
So if the person delivered the important thing in a situation like this, there would be a lot of elements
that the audience could get distracted by, such as other subjects, stuff on the wall, decor and so
on.
But when you close it up to the subject alone, there is nothing to get distracted by and we're just
focused on the subject.
Now, this is the concept of AI trees in editing.
Let me get to that in a second.
But analyzing your favorite movies like this can really help you understand concepts of editing.
Now, one thing about longer scenes, if you do not have a dialogue, let's say it's a scene of two
people hanging around in the park.
Another way that you can keep the audience engaged if you do not want to make cuts in that peaceful
video clip.
You can try different angles, try different sound effects, put some music in the back and attract
your audience with emotion.
So in the previous example where we made that nature 3-D audio, I didn't really use that many videos
to make my composition.
It was just a slow motion clip of someone walking in to the forest, and I kept the audience engaged
with all of the different sounds.
So you can either work with the stuff that you have visually or use some hearing aid to keep your audience
engaged.
The general rule of cuts is that you should change your angle or video every 4 to 6 seconds.
So that means that if you have this scene, you can keep it on for 4 to 6 seconds and then you have
to switch to a different scene.
Now, we're still in the same room, but we just got a different angle.
But like we said, if you do not want to change every 46 seconds, you can just keep your audience engaged
with maybe some jump cuts, sound effects, music, text, graphics and other things.
All right.
Let's talk about trees, which, like we mentioned here is when we give our audience a different cut
so that they stay focused on the most important thing.
In this scene, our attention goes to this subject because of what they're saying.
But when the message gets really important, we get a close up.
And this allows me as the audience to not wander off and think about all the other stuff.
So it's about isolating the most important thing.
So I'm going to tell you some tips and some techniques that are commonly used to to drive the attention
of the audience towards the most important thing in that scene.
So this is our first example where we can isolate one color and leave everything else as black and white.
We're going to learn how to do this in a further lesson.
But this is one of the techniques that is used.
So by default, our eye will just go towards the most brightest thing, especially when that bright
thing is like a vibrant red.
And our attention immediately goes to this, even though there are other people moving, talking and
doing other things.
So this is one technique you can use, isolate the color of the most important subject or object in
order to drive your audience's attention to where you want it to.
The second technique is to have your camera stable and have the subject move alone.
So in this scene, the movie Joker, the camera was stable and Joker was just dancing down the stairs.
Now, because the subject is the only thing moving, our attention will be only on this.
But if there were other people dancing with him, then we may kind of get confused and have our eyes
go towards the other subjects.
So if you have a scene like this where you have your subject, the stairs, but there are some distracting
elements, then you would want to get rid of those distracting elements by either using after effects
or cropping that scene out.
This way people will be focused on your main subject and not on the smaller details.
Third technique is to zoom in onto the most important thing.
We saw that in the Pulp Fiction movie, but just slowly zooming into your subject or using a jump cut
is going to make sure that whatever your subject is saying or doing is the focus of the scene.
So if you have a scene like this, you would want to crop the video so that we don't get distracting
elements or slowly zoom in towards that subject.
So those were some tips and concepts that you should keep in mind.
Next time you are editing a video.
Let's revise them real quick.
You first want to say you should always have a story to tell.
Your video needs to have a beginning, middle end, meaning that from the moment your audience watches
the video until the end, they should have picked up a message, an emotion, or just maybe some inspiration.
This is one of the most important things in video.
And if your video doesn't have that, then you will not succeed in grabbing people's attention.
The second concept was rhythm, the duration of each cut.
The longer your cuts, the more the audience will pay attention.
The shorter the cuts, the more tension that is built and the more excitement.
Pair these with the right music sound effects and you have yourself an engaging scene.
Third concept was its base, which is to keep the most important subject or object at the center of
attention.
We looked over some examples, and moving forward, we're going to see the techniques that can help
us get those effects.
So now that we know these tips, let's take a look at what a good commercial looks like.
So this right here is a commercial by Apple or Apple Watch Ultra.
So let's start the beginning.
I'm going to skip to the middle on the end.
Of course, you can go and watch the full video.
Let's play this back.
Every explorer has a packing list.
The essential tools for heading out into the unknown.
We put as many of those tools on your wrist as we could.
The result.
With a new Apple Watch ultra.
So until the 32nd mark, we learned about the problem.
And the problem was visualized with some explorers in really harsh weather conditions.
So immediately, if I'm someone like this, I'm like, Yep, that happened to me too.
And because of the right sound effect, the right cuts, the right color grating, it really felt real
to me.
And now that I can see the solution, which is the watch, I want to keep on watching and see exactly
how this watch can help me.
Ultra's design pushes the boundaries so you can do the same.
The rugged yet lightweight titanium case extends to protect the flat sapphire crystal.
If you look right here, we can see that they're using the single color technique, which drives my
attention straight to the watch, because this is the most important thing.
And moving forward, it's pretty consistent.
You can see everything is black and white except for the watch.
So they're using that single color technique marking and backtrack Dropping points along your route
to their was a zoom technique.
Point marking and backtrack zooming into your subject.
When you have a white shot dropping points along your route to keep you found when the conditions leave,
you lost.
A turn of the Crown engages night mode, which removes retina altering blue light to ease the strain
on your eyes in the dark.
Beside the bigger, brighter screen.
Is its most versatile tool.
A customizable action button.
One push lets you track race segments.
Find a way out.
Here is another example.
We have a stable shot.
The mountains are not moving.
The only thing moving is our subject.
So we're going to be paying attention on this person.
Start up the dive computer.
Which is now strapped to your arm, tracking everything from depth to water temperature.
Micro polished sapphire surface and sealed case result in an Apple Watch twice as water resistant as
any Apple Watch to come before.
And the audio system's three microphones triangulate it.
So you can be heard.
So the subjects will call right here triangulated.
You can be heard is muffled.
And they used one of the techniques that we learnt about where you have to make the sound effect match
the environment.
So the audio was muffled.
There is this harsh wind and it's not as loud because we have some narration over it.
Even in extreme weather.
Of course, none of this matters if it falls off your wrist.
Which is why we've designed three new bands Alpine Trail and Ocean.
For specific environments.
Maximum comfort.
To endure long runs.
Hard balls.
Ripping currents.
Apple Watch Ultra.
The inspirational music gets louder near the end as the narration delivers the final message.
Is an essential tool.
For essentially anything.
And then we get to resolution, which is just the fact that we need this watch.
If we have those problems.
So this was a good example.
It kept us engaged.
It used different color grading, sound effects and different cuts to keep us as the audience engaged.
And if we were the target audience, we would be completely convinced.
So now that we know what makes a video good and what makes a video bad, it's now time to work on our
own commercial.


## 19. Practice Commercial Pt. 1

So now it's time to work with our commercial style video.
Now that we know how we can tell a story with our clips, how to audio design and the concepts of video
editing, this should be pretty easy for us.
So in your resource pack, I got some clips and some audios.
This is the storyline that I'm going with, but of course you can get your own clips and audios.
So my story here is about like a herbal tea.
And with the videos that I have, I'm going to show the person's week and how hectic her week was.
And then she just slows down with this cup of herbal tea.
So if I just place these next to each other, we can see how the story unfolds.
Let's make a new sequence.
Go with DSLR.
Ten 8030 frames per second.
Let's call this final and drag my first video.
Said to frame size.
This is my opening scene.
Someone is turning up a radio and I'm going to introduce my background music here.
I'm just going to need a little bit of this.
And cut it around here.
Command K or control K, then get rid of the excess.
So once I have my opening scene, I can kind of introduce the subjects week, which of course starts
with Monday.
So on Monday she was busy.
Here's a scene of someone working with their laptop.
Set this to frame rate.
And then we have another cut of a bunch of people in the office.
We're going to assume that she's one of them.
And then we reached the weekend, which is going to be partying and just having fun.
A bunch of party clips here and then right next to your previous video.
And just fill up your timeline according to your story.
So this was her weekdays.
She was in the office, super busy, and then she parties on the weekend.
Then she's going to be waking up.
After that hectic week, then you're going to need an end scene, which is basically where your product
is or where your solution is.
So for me, because it's an herbal tea, I'm going to need a scene of tea being poured out and then
someone enjoying a cup of tea.
So these are all of my videos.
Go ahead and switch the position.
We're going to work with the duration later.
Just make sure you have all the videos you need.
So I'm going to introduce the music right here and then we can work with the duration depending on the
music speeds.
So this is my music and drag it right underneath.
And right off the bat, you're going to make sure that you are labeling your audios so that moving forward
you can handle them better.
All right.
So the music that I chose is relevant to the scene.
I have like a vintage jazz music that goes perfectly with all of my stuff.
So I will introduce it as if it's coming from the radio and that once the person has turned this, we
mute this for a second.
Around here, the music starts and we get to hear it for the rest of the video.
So apart from this, I have like a radio sound effect.
So it's like switching between channels until we find the song at this right underneath, label it.
And this is a mono audio.
So right over here, I'm going to have the music start.
Before that, you're kind of like switching between the different channels.
All right, Let's get rid of the rest of this noise.
We don't really need it.
Maybe have it go on for a little longer.
Command edge.
Get rid of the first transmission and just keep the second one.
So for this section where we have the radio on screen, I want to make the music sound like it's coming
from the radio.
All right, let's grab the music.
Head over to the audio workspace.
I grab that audio essential sound panel.
Then grab this audio.
Go to dialogue.
They choose the preset from the radio.
Let's solve the trick.
And now it sounds like it's coming from this radio.
We have some presets for the type of radio, so you can go for like public radio, old radio, intercom,
podcast and others.
And try this one.
I do the same thing with the noise audio.
So we have the echo and the distance.
For this one I will stick with older radio.
And that's sounding a lot better.
So I have introduced my music for the rest of the video.
I guess we can add a kind of a distant effect.
Let's add the same from the radio effect or the rest of the music.
Just have it go a little louder.
To blend these in, grab both the audios and put on constant power, command edge or control edge on
windows.
We have this noise and then we get our music that we'll play for the rest of the video.
Now let's work with the second video, which is the person working in an office.
But first, we need to figure out how much of this we do need.
Then we can work with the sound effects.
So I'm going to change it based on the beat of the song right before the second beat.
I'm going to grab the video command K, get rid of it and bring in my next video.
And.
It.
And so once we change our narrative from something really mild and static to something more dynamic
and extreme, I can add like a beat audio.
So this will be like the club music playing in the back.
And now let's move on with the use of the sound effects.
We have like a bar crowd background audio.
This goes underneath the party clips.
We're going to cut it a few seconds into the next video.
Then get rid of the excess.
Let's label this clip, the audio.
Next, we have this bird audio that I'm going to place when she wakes up.
So it's coming in from the window.
Drag it right underneath.
Then label the audio.
We also have this other audio, which is birds singing and leaves rustling.
This one, I actually kept it for the final scene where she's just in a jungle and is relaxing with
the product.
So put this in the last scene.
Match it with the last food you label it.
Next we have breathing, which is for when she wakes up.
So it's kind of like the week once a nightmare for her.
And she just woke up.
This is like a breathing sound effect.
We got some party noises next.
Put this underneath the party videos.
We got some cheering with that underneath.
We're going to have to duplicate this a bunch of times, but that will be done later.
Party noises.
We have this heartbeat.
And you put that right underneath the sleeping with you.
We have another party audio.
Then a keyboard typing ordeal, which I think was.
Here.
This is for when she wakes up.
Put it right underneath the crashing on you.
We're going to repeat the transition.
We did a few lessons back to build tension when she wakes up.
The next video is kind of like moving in her bed.
So this is like the sound of blankets moving around.
Perfect for this scene and the one before it.
Office audio.
Put this underneath all of the videos that she's in an office.
So it starts from this video, follows up to the second video.
We can extend it a little bit after the second clip.
So it's as if the office sound is lingering in her head, even when she's trying to relax, because
this is not the product that we're going to advertise.
The final sound effect is for this scene pouring coffee.
Let's put it right here.
So your timeline should look something like this once you have all of your videos and sound effects.
Kept it.
Cut this off.
Once you have your different audio set and your videos placed in the right order, play things back
and work with the duration of the videos.
So we did that for the first two videos, but I just want to do it for the rest to.
And try to match the video with the music.
And.
It helps to lower your resolution.
And.
And when she wakes up, I don't want the music to play because that week is over and she's about to
have a fresh start with our product.
So here we're just going to work with the different sound effects.
She's going to wake up.
Then we get a different angle.
Then she gets up to make our team the product.
And finally enjoys it next to this relaxing view.
And then here we're going to put in our final message.
Before fading everything else.
Let me see what this audio is.
All right.
So once you have your duration for your clips, the audience and everything is perfect, we can now
begin by working with each individual audio.
So your timeline should look something like this.
If it's not looking like this, take your time.
Make sure that everything is perfect so that we can move forward in the next lesson.
In the next lesson, we're going to continue with the different effects, add some transitions, add
the graphics, and just make this commercial perfect.
So I will see you guys in the next part of this project.


## 20. Practice Commercial Pt. 2

Welcome back.
So this is where we left off.
We aligned all of our sound effects.
We have our music and our videos, and basically we're ready to move on to the next step.
So the next step is to match each of these audios to the room that the video is in.
We learn two ways on how to do this.
One is to use the essential sound panel, and the other one is to use surround reverb.
Now the easiest method is the essential sound panel.
And that way I don't have to figure out the effects I need when I'm looking for a certain type of reverb.
So let's head over to the audio workspace, and here is the essential sound panel.
So we edited the music we have from the radio.
The next one is the keyboard sound.
This is what it sounds like.
Now, before moving on to choosing the style and the preset, I want to work with the loudness of all
of these sound effects because all of our audios are sound effects.
I can just tag them all at the same time and have Premiere pro adjust the loudness for me, click and
drag all of these sound effects.
And this right here is a music.
It was the club music background.
So make sure you do not choose the music thing.
I'll just make it violent and match it with the other music.
Once I have dragged all of my sound effects, let's tag them with sound effects and give them a loudness
auto match.
So just click on loudness.
It auto match.
And now everything has been matched.
I'm going to mute the music so we can see how they are.
That's right.
I'm going to analyze one of these so we can see it before and after solo this track.
This is without the loudness.
This is with the auto match.
Let's start with the keyboard and we're going to choose a preset in a room.
I'm going to assume it's a large room because offices are quite big.
So this track.
So the reverb is a bit much.
Let's reduce that to like room reverb.
Let's change reverb to light.
Reduce the amount.
If you want to loop a section over and over, just hit I at the start then.
Oh, at the end.
Then go to this icon and enable loop.
So we get to hear this particular audio over and over.
All right.
That's pretty good.
Let's hear it with the Music Man.
So I get that little keyboard hit right at the back.
If it's too much, you can just go back on your music, then adjust a different sliders.
And once you're done with this selection, you can just get rid of it by holding down option and x or
alt x.
Just be sure that you are selecting the timeline option X and now that selection is gone.
Now let's take a look at our next sound effect.
Again, we're going to hit X.
Match it to the duration of the sound effect solo this track.
Let's see what it is first.
So this is the office audio and I want to choose like make distant.
So it's like the people in the back talking.
Yes.
Yeah.
All right.
And so the trick.
And now we can listen to it with the keyboard, the music, and see how it is.
Now for the telephone.
We have this audio that has a little breaks.
So you want to just cut this off.
And since it's a repeated audio, you can just get rid of the rest.
And just work with one.
I'm going to have the telephone ring before we move into the office.
So it's like a sneak peek of the office.
So that's good.
Going to solo this track, then work with the pitch off the telephone.
It's going to affect controls.
Edit Lower the pitch.
Let's isolate this audio track.
And go to essential sounds.
So I think for this one I might make it like.
A dialogue instead.
From outside a building.
We have the auto match and we have the preset for IQ.
Option X.
And when I play it back with all the other audios, I can see that it's not loud enough.
Increase the clarity.
And the volume of the audio.
Now for this audio where we're kind of getting background office noise.
I want to change the volume over time because here it's in the back.
But in our next scene, it's.
Pretty close.
So the video gets cut here.
Go to effect controls, make a keyframe for level under volume, and just another one at the beginning.
Then we can make one around here.
And kind of increase the volume.
We're done with the office scene.
Now let's move to the party scene.
Let's start with this music.
Let's tag it as music.
Preset balanced background music.
And.
And
try matching it.
Make decent.
Much reverb.
Let's reduce the volume.
And.
All right.
The music is a little short.
We need it to last this long.
But it's.
It finishes right here.
Change the duration to like 75.
She can come back here and maintain the pitch.
And I wanted to cut here.
So grab both of these audios.
Then right on this cut, we're going to hold down command K, control K, can windows get rid of the
extra bits?
All right.
I believe we have some stuff underneath.
I'm going to try dialog for this.
From outside a building.
Going to have the audio begin here.
Get rid of the first bit and it's kind of like made for this second video.
All right.
And for this one, we want to cut it to right here.
Then we have this other audio.
I'm going to keep this for the first clip.
Cut it right here.
Let's get rid of the excess and choose D from outside presets.
Pretty good.
And finally, we have this thing.
Hooray sound.
Oh, can I put one here.
Hold down option or alt to duplicate it for another spot.
Grab both of them.
Then used dialogue.
What?
Oh, such you're in and out points so we can work on it.
All right.
For the second one, I'm going to change the pitch.
This way, it sounds a little different.
All right, so there's my Wu sound, and we're pretty much done with the party audio.
I'm just going to head command etch on this audio since since the ending is not faded.
Command etch and the rest is okay since it will be covered with the transition audio.
So this is what we have so far.
And it mutes the rest of the audience for now.
So everything just stops and then we get the other set of audio.
I just had to manage on this audio.
All right.
So now that I have the base work of my first scene, first and second scene, actually, I can go ahead
and move on to the next one.
We're going to continue this in the next lesson.
If you want to work with the duration, the volume, or just anything else for the first half of this
video, you got to do it now so that when we move forward, we do it without worrying about the previous
scenes.
See you guys in the next lesson.


## 21. Practice Commercial Pt. 3

Now we're going to continue with the second half of our commercial.
This is where we left off.
We just said the audio of the following scenes, the office scene, the party scenes and the opening
scene.
Now we're going to work with the scene where she wakes up and finally introduced the product.
So let's analyze these sound effects that we have and begin with the first one.
So this is the sound of the bird.
So if we take a look at the video, you can see that the window is on her left side.
And I need to, first of all, make it sound like it's coming from the outside.
And secondly, have it show up from the left side of our speaker.
Go to the essential sound panel.
Make distant outside reverb.
Now let's go to effect controls and push this towards the left speaker.
Now we want to reduce the volume so it's less loud.
So that's the bird audio.
I'm going to have it play a little after the video shows up.
Then he'd command edge, control edge on windows to just fade out the end.
So that's our first sound effect in the second half.
The second sound effect is for breathing.
So it's really long breaths and we're trying to make it look like she had a nightmare and she's just
breathing.
Choose from the left because this is where her head is and I just reduce the volume.
Play this together with the bird.
Again, I'm going to cut it here a little after the first video finishes.
So it's a special cut command edge and fade out the end.
You.
I would have to cut my bird audio.
And for the second one, we're going to head to the channel and make this come from the front.
So that would be like 12 decibels for left, 12 decibels for right.
And this way we change the direction of the sound from left to front.
Our next audio is, I think, like a jungle audio.
Not sure.
So it's actually the heartbeat.
Normally when we get nightmares, we get fast heartbeat.
Once again, we need to go to the essential sound panel and make a distant.
Let's go for, like, light reverb.
Increase the volume test tested out with the other sound effects.
The bird audio is a little too loud, so I'm going to grab the first bit and make it even lower.
Then cut it right here and get rid of the rest.
Because let's say in this scene she had some time to wake up, think about her week, and she's now
a little better.
The next audio is like the blankets moving around.
I'm going to have this play for the second video.
Let's assume she's moving her legs and that is causing some extra sound.
Cut it right here.
Make it come from the right side.
The Fed controls.
Let's first add a preset from the right and just lower the volume.
Fade out the end on etch.
Then we have the coffee sound.
It's all the way in the back.
Just got to bring it closer and match it with the video.
Once again, make this distance because it's not exactly close to the camera.
Light reverb.
There you go.
Finally, we have some nature sounds that is going to play when the subject is enjoying her team.
But we need to, one, make it come from the outside and to have it play from the right side of the
speaker.
Preset from outside.
It's not exactly all the way to the right, but an almost front side of the speaker.
Let's try.
Five, four left.
Ten four.
Right.
Then we can just cut it here and fade the audio.
Extend the audio a little bit before the video.
All right.
We have all of our sound effects.
The final one is our transition audio.
We try this effects a few lessons ago or we grab where we have a crash.
Sound effect.
In my case, it's a drum, but you're just looking for this type of curve, especially one that has
a really long fade.
Right click.
And change to speed to like.
Maybe 70 70% and reverse to speed.
Forgot to do that.
Maintain audio pitch.
Now it's going to go from the other side.
Play this back.
Very good.
So you want to match the end with the first video.
Just make sure that there isn't a break here.
So just zoom right in and make sure there isn't any pause.
So we get something like this.
You could stretch it out.
So it begins from here.
But.
But I'm okay with this.
Just simply, if you want to do that right click speed and duration and maybe go from 70% to 60.
Just before we continue, make sure that you can hear the crash.
Among all of the party noise.
To grab it right here.
Central sound.
So you can see that everything is too loud and we can barely hear what's happening.
So what we want to do is to kind of add a fade at the end of all of these ideas so that the attention
goes to this transition.
Audio.
Grab all of your sound effects and the music.
And I'm just going to grab exponential fade right here.
Put it.
Under music and the sound effects.
Then extend the length of these transitions so that it's slowly fading out.
As the crash audio is slowly fading in.
Let me keep this at the beginning.
And reduce the transition.
And between the two bird audios, you need to add a crossfade.
Grab them both.
Delete the first puts and just put one in the middle.
So this is how my ideas look so far.
My timeline looks like this.
Let's have a look from the start.
And if it's good, we can continue on to the next part.
Around here.
We're going to put our final message.
So that's why it's a bit too long.
We can fade the end of our video by selecting it.
Command Control DX.
And we have a problem here.
So here, instead of constant power, we need to grab exponential fate.
Put it right here.
And.
And I think I'm going to extend the audio so that it plays on this scene, too.
Similarly, I'm going to grab the party noises, extend it a little here towards the right.
Extended outwards later and simply add a fate.
All right, So we're done with the music and the sound effects.
Everything's looking good.
So one thing that I want to do is when she's about to wake up and we have this crash audio, I want
to build tension.
And we learned in an older lesson that when you want to make tension, you should have faster cuts.
So that's what we're going to do right here that we have the crash audio going to make really fast cuts
between this video and the one next to it.
So grab your razor tool, see on your keyboard, and just make cuts in this video, the first one being
rather long.
Second one being shorter.
And just keep making it shorter until you reach the end.
You want something like this?
And if you ever wanted to undo a cut, you can just grab your selection tool, click on that, cut it,
delete, and now you can make a fresh one.
Think I would go with something like this?
Repeat this pattern onto the second video.
I do the same thing here.
Cut this guy up.
First, begin with a long cut, then make the cuts smaller and shorter.
So now we're going to replace the blocks in one video with the other blocks.
For example, here we have this scene.
Then I'm just going to grab all of these guys, pull them up and bring the other bits forward and make
it a little longer.
All right,
cut this kid my second bit here.
Let me bring this down.
My second cut.
Bring it right here.
Then the next one, we're kind of like sandwiching these and getting faster as we reach that crash.
And keep there.
Really fast forward for when we hear the crash.
So right here, it needs to get really fast.
And before that, it could be a little bit mellow.
So you can just stretch these.
All right.
Let me just mark out the part where the crush gets really intense.
It m on your keyboard.
And I'm just going to have the cuts ready.
So from here until here, we can have this video, then suddenly cut into the champagne clip.
Go back to this.
Pull these guys up to make some space.
And once you run out of those cuts from your first video, you can actually duplicate these clips because
it's going to be really fast.
And the context of that video will not be that important.
So just duplicate it, cut it into little chunks and proceed with your flash effect.
Each time becoming shorter and just keep doing this until you reach the end of the crash.
So I'm going to pull these guys since I have this large chunk.
See exactly where this starts.
So grab everything from your first cut.
Pull it towards the right until you reach the end.
And over here, I can just stretch the duration of this video.
We can get rid of these.
And now this is what we have.
There you go.
So that's really going to aid the tension that we have and also the fact that she was having a nightmare
of all those parties.
Then select some of the medium shots, not the longer ones.
Right click.
Speed, duration, reverse them and do this with the other video.
Just two of them.
You don't have to do this with every cut.
This is just to make it look even more exciting and crazy.
Let's play the spec.
So right here where we have a smaller chunk, I'm going to reverse it on reverse.
Reverse on reverse.
So it means that Let me just change the color.
Let's make this man go grab your razor tool.
Cut them into four pieces.
Grab the first third, then just reverse the speed.
So we're going to get something like this.
So it has a glitch effect, and that can show that things are not as smooth as they appear to be.
So I have all of my cuts here.
My sound effects are looking good.
I got all of my fades, surround reverbs, and we're pretty much ready to go.
In the next lesson, we're going to work with the color grading of the studio and then finally put in
some text which can introduce our imaginary product.
So I will see you guys in the next lesson.


## 22. Practice Commercial Pt. 4

So now we're ready to color greatest video and match it with the vintage style music that we have.
Let's head to the Metro workspace and begin working with the clips now, because each video has its
own type of lighting, different colors and all that, it will be kind of difficult to use one adjustment
layer and apply all of these changes at once.
So I will be editing each video on its own and for the ones that are similar, I can just use an adjustment
layer.
We're going to use the vintage style that we learned about in a previous category and make this really
old school.
Let's lower the exposure contrast, remove that completely.
Lower the highlights.
Lift the shadows.
Increase the white, darken the blacks.
Temperature.
We wanted to be on the warmer side.
Now we can move to the creative section and do some adjustments.
Now you can go for either a retro look or an old film look, meaning that you can either keep the colours
and get a retro look or get rid of the colours and get a film look.
So this is up to you.
Experiment with both of them and see which one you prefer.
So I have two images in your resource pack that you can see and decide which style you prefer.
This is the film style and this is one sample of winter styles.
You can look for others on the internet and use this as your reference.
I'm going to stick with a film style, so I'll delete this.
I'm going to bring the reference image right above and let's group all of these files.
Select them right click and group.
So whenever I select one, I end up selecting everything and I don't disturb the order that I created.
Push this to the side.
Grab your first video.
Then we can enable comparison view.
So that's my reference.
This is my current frame.
All right, let's begin.
Going to UN group once I move that to the side so I can work with one clip at a time.
So based on what we learned, match the frames to your preferred style, either using auto match or
doing it from scratch.
And if you have some scenes where the lighting is similar, you can use an adjustment layer.
So I'm going to call a grid all of my files and then I'll be back so we can continue.
So I fixed the color for all of the videos and now I have myself a retro film.
Then here's a tip.
If you don't know how to copy and paste color settings from one clip to the other, grab the clip that
already has your settings.
Command Z or Control Z.
Grab the clip that doesn't have anything on right click paste attributes and just check effect.
Match your color if you have anything else going on for motion opacity and time remapping, make sure
that they are not selected.
Once you're finished and you're going to copy the exact same settings, then you can just come into
this new clip, tweak some stuff up and you're ready to go.
You can also do this with multiple clips.
Again, copying the attributes from this clip.
Then select more than one clip, grab all three right click paste attributes and you can just do that
easily so you don't have to copy and paste one by one and be sure to only use one clip as your reference.
So for the further ones you want to copy and paste from this first video and not from like one of the
middle guys, because as you recall, when we copy and paste it onto these clips, we had to tweak some
of these settings.
So you're going to copy and paste those additional changes onto the other videos and that's going to
make things look bad.
So I have one video as reference and if needed, copy and paste your settings.
So I did that until here.
Since.
In this scene she wakes up and things are different.
Once you're done with your color grading, you can just grab everything again except for your reference
shot.
Get rid of your reference image and pull these guys back.
Once you're done in group turn off comparison view.
And I got myself a nice retro film now because I chose this style, I have to put some overlays on this.
So I just downloaded some from the internet, drag it on top, go to effect controls.
And change the blending mode to screen.
So I get these little overlays, which are pretty common in old films.
Now we can just copy and paste this multiple times and just fill up our timeline.
I'm going to change the color so it stands out.
There we go.
We just need the damage film until this part.
So now I've got my damaged film.
One last thing that I want to add is some grain on top of the videos.
Go to the project panel, make a new adjustment layer.
Add this right on top.
And look for noise.
And here we want to just add maybe 20%.
Then I'm going to remove this option so that I don't get color inside my noise.
Now, let's set our endpoint and the point.
Make sure that it doesn't go on top of the second half.
Once you have your endpoint an out point, you're going to hit enter on our keyboard.
All right.
We render the effects and this is what we have so far.
And we actually forgot to add one sound effect.
The sound of the glasses clicking.
Going to get that and put it right here.
So I got this wine glass contact sound.
We're going to put it on the first section and not for the rest.
Let's see where the contact happens.
Add this on your right underneath and match the contact with the beat.
So look at these sound wave.
We have one beat here.
In other ones moving forward and it hit em and mark this.
All right.
So I'm going to use this section where there's more than one contact and match the high point with my
plant.
All right.
We don't need this one because they're pulling back.
You can just cut it here and get rid of the rest.
Let's just go to the essential sounds.
We can get it here.
Central sound.
Call this an SFX.
Make distant light reverb.
It's pretty good.
Just going to reduce the volume and that is pretty good.
So that's our color grading option or alt it X to get rid of the in and out points.
I want to add a cinema crop to the vintage section, and before I do that, I just want to nest all
three of these floors so that the cinema crop could be placed easier.
Grab them all and not the second half, just the first half.
Right click and nest.
Let's call this.
Call it whatever you want.
And now on this, I can just easily add my crop effect.
I'm going to go for a higher number this time.
Usually we do five, but this time I'm going with ten.
So I can use 5% for when she wakes up.
All right, bring your nested clip one floor up so we can change the background.
Go to your bin.
Now.
I just made this background by right clicking new item color matte.
I grabbed the Eyedropper tool and selected one of the darker browns, then just lowered the brightness
to 8%.
Bring this underneath your nested clip so we add brown bars rather than black bars.
You can go with any other color, but the black was too obvious, so I just made it a little brown and.
All right.
Pretty much ready to go with this section of our video.
For the second section, the color grading should be rather more realistic because.
This is just once you wakes up and is brought back to reality.
So let's head to the tricolor and begin with our first clip.
Not going to do anything too intense.
Maybe add a little bit of cold because this is before she drinks our product.
So we want to make it look like she's not her happiest self right now.
And therefore you want to add some cold colors, maybe make things a little dark and gloomy.
Contrast.
Let's add more blue to the shadows.
And some green to the highlights.
Copy this.
Next clip.
Right.
Click.
Paste.
Attributes.
Effect.
Limit your color.
Then here is when she's pouring our product.
So we want to add some warmth.
Contrast a little bit of red to the shadows, and that is looking good.
And then in the final scene where she's drinking our team, everything needs to look perfect.
So we're going to embrace the colors that we have by first getting the proper lighting.
Make everything nice and warm like her cup of herbal tea.
And it adds some red to the shadows and a little bit of cyan to the highlights.
And there we are.
So the color grading is really simple here.
Now, I'm going to make another adjustment layer for these cinematic bars.
You can actually just use it here.
I made one before for this clip.
Put it right above.
But instead of 10%, we're going to go with 5%.
So 5% for top 5% for bottom.
Just to make things look subtle.
And there we go.
Now, because of all of the effects that we have.
Playback will be a little slow.
So if you do want to see a playback, make sure to set your in and out points.
Hit enter and just wait for it to render.
So we're done with the color grading, the sound design and everything else.
In the next lesson, we're going to bring in the titles and finish everything up.
So I will see you guys in the next lesson.


## 23. Practice Commercial Pt. 5

So I just moved to the captions and graphics workspace right over here.
And now we can begin by putting in the titles.
So for my titles, I want to make some that shows the day of the week and then finally introduce the
brand.
So let's go into our next clip and match the titles with the start of each video and a Type Monday right
here with with this font and just the size thing, light is better and change the fill color.
Once you're done with your text, click away and look for the linear wipe effect.
Then go to effect controls down here.
So in the effect controls, bring your play head at the start of your text.
Make a keyframe at the beginning with 100%, then go halfway through your text and turn it to zero.
So we're going to get something like this.
Let me just disable the video.
If you wanted to go faster, just change the space between the two key frames.
But when we play this bag, it's going from the other way to fix this.
Just change it from 90 degrees into 270 degrees.
Now it's going to play from the right side.
Now I have a nice typewriter effect for my text.
Additionally, you can move this adjustment layer above your text so you get the noise on top of the
font match duration of this text.
To the video.
Let's try to make this a little bigger.
Additionally, I want to add some sort of edge effect to this just type edge here at the rough and edges
effect on the text, head to your effect controls and work with the complexity and scale.
This will give us a noisy edge.
Which is perfect for the style.
So we want to repeat the key frame at the end of the text.
So once we see that it's Monday and we're about to move on to the next video, this just retreats back
to the left side.
Make a keyframe for 0% again, then go to the end of your video and of your text, actually, and turn
it back to 100%.
So if I.
Hide my stuff again.
We're going to get something like this.
Let's work with the position.
And that's pretty good.
So we want to repeat this for all the other days.
So we have like three videos, even though there's five weekdays.
So I'm just going to like, skip through the days.
So that was Monday, let's call this Wednesday and the next one Friday.
Just duplicate this text.
And simply change the text from like Monday into something else.
Going to disable all of my other videos because it's going to get a little bit laggy.
So from Monday I'm going to change it into Wednesday and the next one into Friday.
Just check on key frames.
So for this one, I think we need to stretch the time because it's a longer clip.
So move these guys back.
We're going to have variety like this.
So right here, when we go from the weekdays into the weekend, I want to put a like a transition text.
If you just search vintage in the Adobe Stock section.
There's one right here going to put it underneath our adjustment layer.
So it goes from writing into this transition text and then we go to the weekend.
So I'm just going to work with the animations.
I don't need everything.
I'm going to type in like the weekend and remove the second line.
There are some options here, like the size of your text, the spacing and all of that.
But I'm just going to leave mine as it is.
If you want to get rid of the transition at the start, just move forward until it's settled.
Cut it from that point.
Get rid of that first bit.
And use the second half.
All right.
I have some sound effects for the text as well, because we have like a typewriter effect and also this
like vintage screen.
So in your research back, there is some stuff.
So let's start with the typewriter.
Go to your first text at this right underneath.
And just match the beat with the actual text.
I only need this much.
Then repeat this for the rest of the text.
This is Wednesday.
Finally, we have Friday.
Now let's grab all three of these.
Go to the essential sound panel.
Use the make distant preset light reverb.
Later on we can come back and adjusted with the music.
That's the sound effect for the first text.
Secondly, we have this one, which I want to add some sort of noise.
Put it right underneath.
Cut the extra bit.
Then I have a transition sound which is actually mouse clicks, but we're going to modify it.
So I just need this small section.
Said you're in and out.
Point.
Get the audio.
For this one.
We're going to match the beginning of the audio.
With the start of this text.
So first we need to increase the volume, grab the audio as if x.
Make close up.
And then we're going to grab the pitch shifter effect
and just lower the pitch.
Next.
I'm going to slow down this audio.
With 70% maintain audio pitch.
Then add an exponential fade.
Transition.
At the end of this ordeal.
So that's the text for the week events.
When we go back, we should be able to hear everything.
So I can see that my text is way too low.
Command or control are in windows and grab a ruler for where your text should be.
Then go back in week events and just pull these guys up.
And right where the transition happens, I want to get rid of these cinematic bars.
So let's see where it is.
Put your head right when the text shows up.
Then go to final.
Make your cut.
Then go back in here and just go for the end of this text.
So right here, make a cut.
And now in this middle section, we want to delete the crop effect.
So when we get the transition text, there are no cinematic bars.
Now, finally, in the last scene, we're going to introduce our product.
So right when she's about to drink her tea, you can use your own text or just get one from Adobe Stock.
Going to grab this bold title effect.
Get rid of this stuff I don't need and position it right.
Let's change this.
We have a skill animation, which I don't want.
Open this up source text and then introduce your brand.
So I'm going to make mine sample tea.
And now this is what I get.
I also brought this 100% natural logo, which will be in your resource back.
And I'm going to do a simple fade transition with opacity keyframes.
So when I get sample tea, I'm going to put this in the corner.
Then we can just end the video and put command DX on both of these overlays.
Just make sure that the crust is all of the text and the PNG happens faster than the video.
So I have my text right here and I want to kind of skew it onto the window.
Go to the effects panel and look for the transform effect.
Add this onto your text.
The effect controls, then come down to this lighter.
To increase it.
You can just like, do this.
There's also an option for the access so we can make it perfect for the window.
So I used a collection of skew skew axis and rotation to place my text inside the window.
I will go with the color blending mode and perhaps change the color of the actual text.
So white is not doing it for me.
Going to grab the Eyedropper tool and select the lighter color of her sweater.
Based off this, I can just change the blending mode.
If you go in your text, there are some options for drop shadow.
Additionally, you can use the corner pin effect.
Just type it here, coin your pin and use these circles to.
Define the corners of this window.
I'm actually going to delete the transform since I got the corner pin and now we can increase the scale.
Of the text.
I'm going to work with the drop shadow.
Let's zoom right in.
That little black thing is the drop shadow, which should be here.
Just make sure that shadow is turned on.
You can work with the distance.
The size of these.
And of course, the feathering and opacity.
I'm actually going to delete the old one so I can avoid redoing all of my settings.
So let's go forward and change the text.
All right.
And then around here, I'm going to introduce the logo.
So.
So let's go to the project panel.
Grab the blur effect.
Put it on top of your video and then we're just going to make a keyframe for 0%.
Push it back, then increase the blurriness until we cannot see the subject.
And I'm going to cut this before this blur transition.
So your text should feed somewhere around here.
And then we're supposed to get blurred video on this blurred video.
We can add the logo, which I'll just type in.
Put it in the center and we can maybe put this organic logo at the bottom.
Extend the length.
Command d to fade out the logo.
So we were able to use all that we learned so far and create this commercial was really simple to do.
It just took a while to make.
But making commercials like this is a great way to practice your skills within Premiere Pro because
it forces you to use different concepts from color grading, transitions, text animations and so much
more.
So come up with imaginary brands, write a concept for it, and then use what you learned to make a
commercial for it.
Always be sure to save these videos somewhere up for yourself so that later you can look back and see
how far you've come along.
Now we're done with the audio category.
Let's move on to our next category, which concerns transitions.
