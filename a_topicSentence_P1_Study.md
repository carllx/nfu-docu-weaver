### Where do you study? / What do you do? / Do you work or study? (高频) 
I'm currently a senior student at Hunan University, and I'm studying computer science at the moment. 
### Is it ( your school) a good place to study? (高频) 
Yes, it is. The faculty are great. There's also a lot of support available for students $_2$. There's a writing centre that can help you refine your assignment $_3$. And there are also lots of people you can talk to if you're struggling in your program. I really enjoy studying here.

### Would you like the place where you study to make any changes? (高频) 
A: Um...I would love it if my school installed air conditions for our dorms. During the warmer months, I sweat like a pi $_6$ when I'm in the dorm. It's so brutal $_7$. If they installed air conditioning, life would be a breeze $_8$. I wouldn't have to hang out on campus just for the cool air.

B: Well, there aren't many options when it comes to food in the school cafeteria. I'm so sick of eating the same three thing $_9$. In general, the food in the cafeteria isn't that great. I would be better of $_10$ making instant noodles at home. So I really hope the cafeteria will expand their selection. 

### What is your major? /What do you study?/What subjects are you studying? (高频) 
I'm studying computer science at Hunan University. It's an undergraduate major, and it usually takes four years to earn the degree. I feel happy being enrolled in this program, because coding is one thing I'm passionate about. Plus, I think I have a knack for $_{11}$ it since my math is good. 
### Do you sometimes feel that you have to study too hard? (高频) 
Yeah, I've had that feeling before. My program can be very demandin $_{12}$. It definitely takes up a lot of my time. And I find that I don't always get the grade that I want. So I put in hours and hours of work to try and do better. It can be really exhausting. Sometimes I wonder if it's worth it.
### What do you like to do just after you finish class every day? (高频) 
I really like to go for a walk or do something else to relax. Going for a walk is great because I can enjoy the fresh air and take my mind off of school for a whil $_{13}$. If I'm not able to go for a walk somewhere, I'll just chill at hom $_{14}$ and scroll through social media on my phon $_{15}$. 
### Do you like your major/subject? Is it very interesting? 
Yes, I do like my major. But you know... there will always be parts you like and parts you don't like. For example, the field training is very interesting, but the theoretical courses are about as fun as watching paint dr $_{16}$ because some abstract concepts are quite difficult to understand.

### Why did you choose to study that (major)? /Have you always wanted to study this(major)? 
Well, as for the reasons why I decided to study computer science, I think the main one is that I have lots of passion in that field. I never feel bored and I always enjoy studying and researching things about it, and I've noticed that since I was still in high school. So, I told myself that if I went to a college, I would take computer science as my major. 
### Do you study best in the morning or the afternoon? / Do you prefer to study in the morning or in the afternoon? 
I think it's good to study in the morning. I have to wake up earlier, but when I get through the wor $_{17}$, I have the rest of the day off. And the afternoon is usually a better time of day to enjoy myself. So it's best to get studying over wit $_{18}$ as early as possible. 
### Are you looking forward to working? 
Yes, I am. I've been studying as a student for almost 16 years of my life. I really expect to have a proper job after graduating from college. It will be a huge change of lifestyl $_{19}$ and I will be able to support myself financiall $_{20}$, which will make my parents proud as well. I can't wait to find a good job. 
### What technology can help you learn better? /What technology do you use when you study? 
There are lots of websites and apps that can quiz you and test your knowledge. All you have to do is input your term $_{21}$ and then you can use online flashcard $_{22}$. I've used a couple of them to memorize important terms before an exam. They're definitely a life-save $_{23}$ when you're in a rush to catch up on $_{24}$ some class content.
