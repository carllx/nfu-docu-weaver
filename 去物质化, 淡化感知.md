### 去物质化, 淡化[[感知]]
- [[Aesthetic]](美学) 的重点是加强概念艺术强调观念而不是[[感官知觉]]——Lucy Lippard (1973) 称之为艺术品的非物质化。如果艺术品背后的想法比它作为物理事物的[[nature|本质]]更重要，那么它需要被思考而不是被感知。 [(p.89)](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/36FR2KYB?page=89&annotation=Q29IGEXI) ```The aesthetic point, in most of these cases, was to reinforce the conceptual art emphasis on ideas rather than sensory perception—what Lucy Lippard (1973) called the dematerialization of the art object. If the idea behind the artwork was more important than its nature as a physical thing, it needed to be thought rather than perceived.```

- 艺术家的目标都是通过淡化可感知的事物并尝试来挑战正统(orthodox,惯例convention, [[传统]] )的艺术概念（雕塑、音乐、绘画、拼贴画、表演......）——正如 [[Artisti/Sol LeWitt]] 所说—“让观众在精神上对他的作品感兴趣”。 [(p.94)](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/36FR2KYB?page=94&annotation=ITCLKQ3F) ```In all the cases I’ve mentioned, the artist’s aim was to challenge orthodox notions of art (sculpture, music, painting, collage, performance ...) by playing down what’s perceptible and trying instead—as LeWitt put it (1967: 822)—‘‘to make his work mentally interesting to the spectator’’.```

- [[Artisti/Sol LeWitt]]不仅写下了创作壁画的公式化规则，这些壁画通常由许多直线组成（有时多达 10,000 条），这些直线彼此之间有特定的距离和/或绘制了特定的分钟数），而且他训练他的助手以特定方式执行这些指令。他甚至停止了在泰特美术馆建造“他的”一件作品，因为他觉得泰特的工作人员执行他的传真指示（他们认为这完全是直截了当的）是不可接受的。 [(p.110)](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/36FR2KYB?page=110&annotation=P4R5N9VH) ```Perhaps the best example of this is the American artist Sol LeWitt. Not only did he write down formulaic rules for composing his wall drawings, which usually consisted of many straight lines (sometimes, as many as 10,000) positioned at specified distances from each other and/or drawn for a specified number of minutes), but he trained his assistants to execute these instructions in a particular way. He even halted the construction of one of ‘his’ pieces at the Tate gallery because he felt that the execution of his faxed instructions by the Tate’s staff (which they had assumed was utterly straightforward) was unacceptable. He sent out two of his own staff from New York to do the job instead.```
