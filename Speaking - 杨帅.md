注意过程在于沟通
我傻但我英语好,

It's not about what you say;
It's how you say it.
```

```markdown
一般与特殊
## How often do you go to parks?
- Well, there's a park close to my apartment and [[typically]], I go there 3 or 4 times a week, very frequently I would say. I like to go there with my folks and we walk and chat and have fun together.
- [[However]], [[occasionally]], there might be something that takes up a lot of my time, like an important exam, a big project ... in this case, I guess I only go to this park once a week or even less often than that.

- [[most of the time]], [[in most cases]], [[generally]], [[normally]], [[typically]] ...
- [[however]], [[but]]
- [[from time to time]], [[once in a while]], [[occasionally]]

一分类讨论
Do you like to get up early in the morning?
- Well, [[it depends what]] time I went to bed the previous night.
- [[if]] I hit the sack at a normal time, say 11 pm or earlier than that, I'll just get up around 6:30 or 7, which I think is pretty early.
- [[However]], [[if]] I had a lot of homework to do and had to stay up until 1 or 2 in the morning, getting up early won't be an option anymore.

- _it depends_
- it depends on the person/the individual/gender/city
- it depends what/when/where/who ...
- it varies from person to person
- it varies from generation to generation
- it varies from city to city
- if .., but however .., if..
