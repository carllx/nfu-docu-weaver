## 11 Adding Audio
### 1. Understanding Audio Tracks

Audio is a huge part of video generally, and I say generally because it is known throughout the industry
that an audience will forgive a slightly less quality video if the audio is good.
Hence why.
And this is quite tongue in cheek, but hence why I'm using quite an expensive microphone to record
this rather than just a cheap small microphone.
Because you have to deal with the audio all the time.
You can look away from video.
Of course you can mute the audio, but it's no use to you.
Once it's muted, you can look away from the video at times.
You can kind of see what you want to see throughout the whole picture, whereas audio is all being fed
to you at the same time.
So good quality audio makes up at least 50% of a good video, if not more.
I say most of the time because that's changed a little in recent years, depending on where you're consuming
the media.
That is video.
Because a lot of people watch video on mute, say if they're on a bus or train or in public or they're
on the sofa and someone else is watching the TV and they're watching a video on their mobile device,
whether they're scrolling through Tik Tok or Facebook or Instagram stories.
And that is where subtitles come in a lot, especially if, well, there's spoken dialogue.
But it's still it still does speak to the point that audio is really important.
So you should never forget the importance of good audio.
That's what we're going to touch on now in this section.
And first off, we're going to understand the audio tracks.
So if we just revert just quickly back to the video tracks, you've got one, three, five video tracks
going left to right now.
Below this definite line is the audio track.
So of the audio tracks, if I hold down shift, by the way, and scroll down, shrinks up all the audio
track so I can see them all.
Same with the top.
I come into the top and hold down, shift and scroll down and it will either grow or shrink while scrolling
down will shrink them down.
I hope that's a little tip that you'll use.
You will?
I promise.
You can do it manually by up and down with the sliders here.
But I.
And, of course, here as well.
But I always use the scroll wheel.
If you've only got a touchpad on a laptop, as I said earlier in this course, I would highly suggest
you adding a mouse.
But if you haven't got a mouse and you still want to use this function with the scroll most modern day
laptops the touchpad will support two two finger scrolling you'll already know about.
So just like the video tracks here, the audio tracks are here.
But the audio tracks in the workspace that we have set up are also duplicated.
And that is up here with audio track mixer.
Remember when I said to get rid of the audio clip mixer?
And that's because and I'm only going and only going to mention this now and then, we're never going
to talk about audio clip mixer again, because I think it's one of the most dangerous things to have
in a workspace, because what this audio clip mixer does is it only effects one clip and you could be
dialing in settings, etc. because they look so similar to the audio track mixer.
You could be affecting just one track and the rest of the clips on that track won't be affected.
And personally, the way that I've learned and the way that I'm teaching you, you will never need the
audio clip mixer.
We just we just don't need it.
So close that panel out.
We just do not use that.
So I know we've got no audio, as you can see down here, but let's just have a quick look at the audio
track mixer because there are a number of things in here which you need to be aware of all the way through
your production, all the way through your editing.
First and foremost, we have a dropdown here for the audio to go to the mics.
And what does that mean?
Well, that means that all of these clips, all of these tracks are going to the main mics.
We can add another super mix.
See how this is titled mics.
Well, I always title this as and it used to be.
I don't know why it's changed, but this used to be titled as master and it won't let me edit that.
That's strange.
That must be an update.
However, we can change the titles here.
Let me let me change this to VEO.
That's what we use for voiceover and maybe we'll change this to BGM.
So background music and you could do that all the way down and it helps you to just keep track of what
is playing on which track and when you've got a numerous tracks all the way through the sequence.
It's really handy to see what is peaking or it's too quiet that needs to be turned up and all that.
It's always really, really handy to label these, but we've got four tracks and we've got the mix of
the master.
If we right click down here, we can add an audio super mix.
Why would we do that?
Well, see, you've got voice here and you've got maybe background music here as we have, and you've
got maybe sound effects here.
Well, let's say that the sound effects, SFX, you want it to have the sound effects and the background
music going to a separate mix before it got to the main.
And you want the main voiceover going straight to the main.
This is all to do with your audio sound and how you want that final mix to be.
Well, that's where this drop down comes in, because now rather than just mix, we now have the option
to send it to a sub mix.
So let's send the background music and the sound effects.
So here to the sub mix.
Now within this sub mix, you can turn it up and down should you wish to, because these are sliders
or faders just like on a music desk, you know, you see in these big recording studios, that's what
these are, these are faders.
They all default to set to zero DB and can be taken all the way down to infinity minus infinity and
all the way up to plus 15.
DB If you ever want to get it back to zero.
And this works in so many different areas within the Adobe Suite, not just premiere pro double click
and it'll snap straight back up to zero.
You may not and to be honest with you, I know a number of editors that never work with this sub mix.
I'm just explaining that.
So you don't go through anything.
Oh, well, why am I given being given a mix?
And when the sub mix wasn't there, my options are mix or mix.
That's why if you ever need a sub mix and you'll know when you come across it and you come across a
time in your editing where you may need it.
That's where it is.
And you can have several sub mixes so you can have maybe you got two or three people talking at the
same time.
You could have them all set up an IQ, how you want them, and then send them to the vocal sub mix and
then you'd have a music and sound effects of mix.
This can build on and build on and build up.
So in on top of the option to switch where it goes to it, it goes to the main mix or master and the
sub mix.
You have the option to pan.
So this goes all the way over to the left speaker.
This goes all the way over to the right speaker.
See how it dragging like we like we have done in the past in the effects controls.
That's.
Where that does.
Also, you can click in here and dial in the number and also you can double click to get back to zero.
Next down, we have read you've got off latch touch and.
Right.
This is all part of automation.
And in all honesty, as a professional, professional videographer, I never use this.
I have in the past, but I think it over complicates things.
In short, if we have it on right, you could go all the way through a production and let's say rather
than right on there, let's put it right on BGM as the background music, you could then play it back
and maybe set your music down to here.
Okay, then we're playing and what we then do is maybe turn on your music to here and then it's a point
where you want the music up a bit and then maybe up a little bit and then maybe all the way up if we
then stop and play that back, see how this is all moving.
So we set it to right and go back to the beginning.
It started playing and you bring your music, say, down to a little bit like here, then maybe needs
to be a little bit quieter and then it needs to be all the way up here and then maybe down a little
bit.
Because we've then come to write that if we then go back to read.
Look how it all changes.
And it's supposed to change all the way through, but it never really does.
And I don't.
And I think that's I don't think that's ever been worked on.
Purely because it doesn't really work and no one uses it.
Let me just check.
I've got all that out.
Yeah, all that information is out of this slide.
And that's also because there's a great way to do it automatically, which we will touch on in a future
section to easily level your music.
So that's all of the audio track mixer.
But it's not because those eagle eyed among you and I know I'm always calling on the eagle eyed.
You have a dropdown.
So now what we have is we have one, two, three, four, five slots for effect.
We also have one, two, three, four, five slots for second assignments.
Now the second assignments are all to do again with sub mixes and mono sub mixes and adaptive sub mixes.
I've never used these and I don't know anyone in the industry who does.
Maybe.
Maybe audio designers would use these, but this is the minutia.
Whereas these I've used these a lot and this is where using the audio track rather than the audio clip
is most important.
Let's say you have a talking head and all the audio on clip.
One is talking and you want to boost all of that talking or then maybe go to slot one.
And you have all of these you you may not have the best, but you definitely one of the best because
these are plug ins that I use.
But here we have so many options to affect your audio.
And to give it just a nice little punch.
I often come into amplitude and compression down to multi-band compressor, click it and nothing happens
other than multi band compressor comes up here, but it's now in the chain and what we do is we double
click and all of a sudden we're greeted with this.
Now, I know this could be quite daunting for some, which is why I've got no music in there, no audio
in here right now, because I want to just show you this space.
And although the multi-band compressor is a greatly customizable tool and you can change all the different
bands of the audio all the way reading all the Hertz, what I often do is just simply drop down a preset
and hit broadcast.
Broadcast is a really easy way to just give punch to everything.
I mean, to everything.
I will show you a little bit later how that works.
But I want you to see just how important this track mixer is, because it just it makes all the difference
with your audio.
So that's the audio track mixer.
And what we're going to do next is going to find some audio, first off, some music, and then maybe
some sound effects to bring in to the project.


### 2. Understanding Music Licences

For this next section, we're going to take a step away from Premiere Pro because we need to understand
music.
Now, I'm not expecting you to go into a music degree or be the next Mozart or Ed Sheeran, but we need
to understand what we can use in a video, and that's not a genre or a style of music.
It's actually with regards to the copyright of a music you see, although you physically could put any
audio in here, whether it be spoken, sound effect or any kind of music, anything in these audio channels,
as long as it's a recognized file type, whether that be MP3, wav, flexi OGG Vorbis.
There are so many different types of audio file, not just M.P. three, but we need to confirm that
you can use it because whether you're making a video for a just a special occasion to be played in front
of just a small group of family and friends, or whether it's going online on off on a Facebook page,
on an Instagram account or even on YouTube or Vimeo.
And of course, this goes without saying or should go without saying for any professional work, because
effectively you're selling a client the deliverable, the edited video and everything that is included
within that video.
Now, if there's copyrighted music in that video, you're effectively reselling that copyrighted material.
And if you don't have the license to sell that, then you could be in quite deep water legally.
In fact, I need to stress this probably fully.
It's illegal to do that, and you could get smacked with quite a large lawsuit.
I know that sounds quite serious, but it needs to be pointed out because there are so many people.
And let's take it back maybe a step from professional videography and professional video creation,
and let's step it to YouTube.
The first thing that people want to do when they're really pushing a YouTube channel is to get monetized
now above the amount of you need a certain amount of subscribers and a certain amount of watch hours
per year.
Currently, it's a thousand subscribers and over 4000 watch hours in a particular year, a 365 day period
to be able to become monetized.
Now, once you're monetized, you're then being paid for advertising on those videos.
If you're using unlicensed copyrighted music, all that money will go to the people who own the copyright
for the music, even though it's only a portion of the video.
Similarly, if you're not monetized and you use copyrighted music, you can continue to use that and
have it go up on the video and playback in YouTube.
But your video will be monetized even though your channel isn't monetized.
And lo and behold, the perceived the earnings from that monetization again will go to the copyright
holder.
So it's really important to make sure you're only using music that you're allowed to use.
I'm going to show you few examples here.
There are a number of databases throughout the Internet with varying qualities of of music that you
can use.
But I'm just going to show you three.
The first couple are paid for and the third is completely free.
But with you get what you pay, you do get what you pay for.
So if something's free, it's not necessarily the best.
But let me show you just a couple.
This is art, by the way.
As I said in the previous chapter, any corresponding links to things that I show you will also be at
the bottom of the worksheet and these will link through to these.
So you're getting exactly what I'm talking about and not necessarily a flavor or a different version
of what I'm talking about.
So this first and foremost is Art List.
Art List is a subscription service used to only be able to pay for it per year.
You can now pay for it per month.
And what this gives you is a massive and I mean massive collection of music.
All of these are original.
All of these are yours to use once you have the subscription.
Not only that, but once the subscription runs out and this runs with all of these services, all these
kind of services that I'm especially I'm going to show you today, as long as you had a subscription
at the time of downloading, a license is generated and you can then use that going.
Forward in as much as it can stay on the video that you downloaded it for.
Bearing in mind that that doesn't then mean you can use that same piece of music on future projects
for each project.
So you use Dessa The Hope Lounge, Dr. Paranoid.
I'm just going to play a little bit of it.
I can't play loads of it because I was the copyright.
So that's the track you wanted.
You downloaded it and you then put it into your video.
You then can't use it in another video.
If you wanted this again to use another video, you'd have to come back and download it again just to
generate a license for each project.
I hope that's clear with at least at least a great for being able to fine tune exactly what you're looking
for because you can search by mood.
You can also search by video, theme, genre and particular instruments that you want.
You can.
This is a new thing with there.
You can also say not only what you want, but also what you don't want to say.
You're looking for something, but you know that you don't want acoustic guitar.
You can just exclude anything with acoustic guitar.
All of a sudden, the list that we have, which as you keep scrolling, it will add more.
None of these have acoustic guitar in them.
You can simply say No acoustic guitar and you still want it.
You want it uplifting and maybe you want it funny.
So now all of these that coming to your list have no acoustic guitar and are uplifting and funny.
Let's check.
Let's check princess.
I would say that matches the the the requirement also with or not list which is new is you can then
find similar really easily.
So say you liked princess you liked it but it wasn't quite right on this button here you can toggle
for similar songs and it doesn't just look for the same artist.
This is Serge quite Rado, but it also looks for others.
So by Serge we also have Imperial.
It's similar.
And we also have Hans Johnson at the zoo.
Yeah.
And a whole load.
This is such a good database to use.
As I said, it is chargeable.
There is a cost to pay to to buy this and to have a license for this.
If you use the link in the workbook, I think it gives you a couple of months free as well, which is
quite good.
Do make sure you check the links in the bottom of the workbook because they have been collated especially
for you for this course.
Also within our list you have the option for sound effects, which is always handy when you are doing
audio design for your your video.
Remember the, the woosh that we had before in one of the transitions.
Well, this has so many wishes.
If you've ever been aware of the term.
Foley.
Foley y Disney have a massive Foley department and is literally just getting sounds and recording sounds
that sound like other things or say coins dropping.
They'll have a full department that will record things like that, coins dropping or glass smashing
and all that kind of thing.
And those Foley we used in in the likes of Mickey Mouse cartoons and all that kind of thing, all the
way up to feature films as well.
And art, they also have a section which is footage.
So this opens a new tab.
I don't have this, but this is stock footage as well, which is great.
And we will touch on stock footage a little bit later on in the course where I use another system called
Motion Ray.
Now let's just step over to Motion Way actually, because Motion Array are also a great source for not
only audio, royalty free music and sound effects again, just like heartless, but also presets that
you could use within Premiere Pro here and Adobe after effects and templates that you can use in premiere
pro and after effects.
Adobe After Effects always works really well with Adobe Premiere Pro.
Remember what I said at the very beginning of this?
This course?
If you're going to use more than one product from Adobe, it's probably best you get the full suite.
There are a number things say in here, the templates that are premiere pro templates.
Some of them will work completely in Premiere Pro, but they will use after effects.
I have a friend in the industry, a very dear friend of mine in the industry called Chris and he uses
a number of premiere pro templates in his videos.
They all are all powered by after effects, but he's never, ever opened after effects.
He just has a installed.
So After Effects can run in the background and give all the details for Premiere Pro.
But here we are here right now for audio and this looks very similar to artist it's a another great
database of music is fantastic let's just a quick play of here preview.
Now let me hear preview artless.
Don't play it.
But on here it does.
And it just stops people from playing it back using a sound recorder and getting the file because again
that preview in the.
Here again in the background.
It's purely there so it can't be used.
Audio Jungle You'll hear here being spoken in the back of a number of videos, some that actually people
have just put up on YouTube probably because they don't realize or they don't care.
The fact that it's actually watermark, that's a way of watermarking an audio file.
So it shouldn't be used or it stands out that it actually hasn't been licensed.
Similarly, emotionally, we also have sound effects, which is again brilliant.
I also have a plug in that I never have to come into this website and I'll show you a little bit later
on.
And the third choice of audio, which is free, is in YouTube.
Now you have to have a YouTube channel to be able to use this.
And here I am in the back end of my YouTube channel, Music of a man.
I do tech gear reviews, all that kind of stuff.
It's a little bit of a sandbox for me to play with in my own spare time while I'm running my media production
company on in the day.
But to get to the audio library in YouTube, you need to come up to the top here and you need to go
to what is Creative Studio.
It's not there now because that's where I'm in.
And then you go down to the bottom left here and you go to audio library.
Now this again is very similar to the likes of Art List.
If we go back to the music, you can see artist is there and here.
Motion array again.
All the music there.
The audio library here is very similar.
The only thing is, is that it's not really updated that much.
I say not much.
I mean, we're filming this in January 2022 and here the latest.
I've got this a sorting by most recent.
So the most recent was put up in December 2021 doesn't give me a date and if I scroll down the okay
that full page of 30, let's go to 100.
Okay.
So maybe halfway through, we then got August.
So it's only maybe updated every couple of months or so.
Now you can just go ahead and start using some of these bots.
Again, the audio library within YouTube, although you can use these and monetize with no hurt and
you can earn all that money.
There are some tracks that require some form of recognition and the way in which I show you here is
if you click into the search bar, you can search a title, you can select a genre clicking back into
here.
You can select a mood just like you could in art artist, and you can select a duration or an artist
name.
But also, it's really important here to have a look here at the bottom.
Attribution not required.
Attribution required.
Now, if you had attribution required, that would mean that although you can use these, this is now
obviously only showing tracks which require attribution.
You can use any of these in your video.
However, you need to mention in your description what the track is that you're using and also where
to get it from.
Here's your license type here so you're free to use the this audio in any of your videos, including
videos that you monetize.
However, you must include attribution information in your video description.
So I've amassed over this CC here, if I come down and then click a few details that now gives me the
full details for this track.
And this is how YouTube require you to include it.
The easy way to do that is to click this button here, which copies it to your clipboard.
And then what I would do is I would paste that into a notepad or a word document or something and keep
it to one side.
Ready to go into the video description when you actually post the video, that also goes for anywhere
where you're posting this, not just in YouTube, but so you put it on Vimeo or you put it on social
media, you would you would be required by law, kind of a can't overemphasize this.
You would be required by law to include this in the description of your video if we don't want to do
that.
We would then have to have to refine by attribution not required.
And again, if we come over here where we used to be before, you're free to use this audio track in
any of your videos, including videos that you monetize, no attribution is required.
So we know that we can use that.
So let's have a look for some music.
Don't forget, you can also do sound effects as well, but we'll come back to that.
Let's go to genre and let's go for, I don't know, maybe some pop who doesn't like pop.
The hands are going up at the back and I don't know, sunset dream.
What I often like to do is I like to check if there's a fade out or a fade.
Yeah.
If there's a fade out or a definite ending on a track.
I don't know, I.
I just like to check.
So that's kind of that playing.
Well, it's quite nice.
Okay, let's have that.
So we selected this is the track that we want.
I like the fact that You Tube, even though you press pause, it leaves a little signifier here.
Don't forget that YouTube owned by Google, obviously they change things all the time.
So this may look a little bit different to you, but it should look pretty much the same way.
It should be quite clear when you're looking at it, if it does look different, just how to get this.
So here we are in Sunset Dream.
I'm just going to download this track and there it is.
Down here.
I'm using Chrome.
I swear by Chrome.
So here is the track Sunset Dream.
So let's go and find that in the folder.
And here I am in the folder of our premiere pro project.
Just a quick reminder, we have our original project file and obviously we had an update within Premiere
Pro.
So we're now at number one.
And I'm going to go into audio and into music and I'm just going to paste that into that because I copied
it from before.
So now that we've got our music.
We're going to now take it and put it into our program.
But now, at this point, we finished the point of explaining just why and how you get the right kind
of music for your videos.


### 3. Importing Audio

So here is where we left off.
And right now, we have our music track.
Now, I can use this music track in this course because I've downloaded it and it doesn't need any attribution.
I similarly, as I have a subscription, I could have downloaded any of the tracks from the likes of
Art List or Motion.
Ray and I could have used them in here.
However, you couldn't have got these yourself if you're following along.
Similarly, I can't include this as part of the source files because I don't have a license to redistribute.
However, you can go to the audio library in YouTube just like I did and download this same track should
you wish.
Just to make that clear on the licensing front.
You always have to have that in mind when you're working with other people's creative material, whether
it be photo, video, audio, anything, anything to do with that, you need to make sure that you have
the rights to use it.
So now we have the music that we want to bring into the sequence.
So we just grab it and drag it in.
Well, yeah, we can.
We absolutely can.
Obviously, we try and keep everything as clean as possible in our project.
Just touching on that, we're on the thumbnail assessing at the moment.
I often like it here in the list view so I can kind of keep an easy idea of everything that's here and
also I can close up things.
As you can see, this is a bin folder and this is called a bin that we didn't create, but this was
created for us when we were using Premiere Composer.
Remember when we dropped in those transitions and they had audio files?
Well, it automatically creates a bin within here and another sub bin or subfolder with assets.
And then we've got the graphics because remember we did a light leak.
So we have certain things here.
It literally the great thing is, is that it collates everything.
So it doesn't just throw everything within here, but it has to be in the project folder within here
because yeah, say the project panel and it has to be in here because everything in a timeline, whether
it be in this sequence or a nested sequence or whatever, has to also it has to read from somewhere.
And the somewhere is the project panel hope that makes sense.
It can get quite messy, so I try to manage it as much as I can, just so I can see everything, what
I need to see.
And now we're all the way outside within the project panel and the light greys, that's the colour.
So I'm okay with that being, I'm not really okay with that being there, but let's just leave that
for now.
We can be too tidy, although my wife would not agree.
But we we also get sequences, we've got videos, we've got nested, we've got the premiere composer
files.
Now, if we just grabbed that audio track and dragged that into here, that would be a standalone audio
track.
You could just drag it into here.
But I'm trying to get you the correct habits just to make sure everything's as clean as possible.
But the thing is, having the audio track, the music right there, it's like having a video out here
on its own.
So I'm going to control that.
That and there's two ways we can get it into a bin.
We can either add a new bin like this and title it music and then drag the music into there or controls
that controls that.
What I like to do is because I've already got this in a music folder, I can save that step, I can
grab that music, the folder and drop it into here.
That then creates a bin.
And within that bin is the music.
Honey.
Hey, now, what I would love to do would be able to set this as a watch folder.
And I think this is something that Adobe needs to work on.
I've dragged that folder from here into here.
What I would love is for that then to become a watch folder.
What I mean by that is that anything else I can put into here?
Any more music?
Anything within music I could then?
Or that premiere pro would automatically read that and bring that into here.
So then it would populate in here.
It doesn't currently, and it never has.
But I think that would be a really good solution.
I might just get in contact with Adobe and make suggestions for that.
The the Adobe community is really good.
It's a full scale forum and a number of Adobe representatives monitor that on a daily basis.
So I might make that recommendation.
You never know when you're using this.
That might actually be an option.
And if it was, I would imagine that you would just right click and somewhere along here you'd set it
as a watch folder.
But until that day comes, we will have to limit and do it like this.
And any more music that we would bring in, even if it was in this folder, we would just have to manually
drag it in.
So now we have the music in.
Let's double click and you can do exactly the same as you did with music, with video.
You could double click this and it would open in the source monitor.
Remember when we double clicked a video?
It would open in the source matter here.
Remember he's in an out that we set.
You can do the same with music and you can playback just within the source monitor.
So there's a track and you can scrub through and you can find in obviously the waveform.
The smaller the waveform, the quieter it is, the the bigger the way in form, the louder it is.
That's a very simple explanation of that.
But this is throughout the whole the whole audio realm, as it were, and silence is right through the
middle.
This is a stereo track.
So this is the left channel.
This is the right channel.
And right through the middle of each of these is silence.
And anything branching out in both ways shows volume of some sort.
So you can see if I zoom in here.
You can see where it's going to hit.
And as you as you move on with your editing process, you'll actually start to edit with with the waveform.
When I actually have screen recorded and come to edit top and tail at these screen recordings, there's
a number of times where I, I cough or a song comes to the door or anything like that.
And all I do is I clap.
I clap really loud when I come back.
If you remember the clapperboard that you've seen on sets of movies, what it does is it creates a spike.
And you see this right here.
Let me tell you this.
See this right here?
That's a spike.
Let's listen to it.
Yes, that's a spike.
And what I do is I will read that.
So I'll see that the audio maybe when I'm talking, it looks like this.
And when I'm not talking and there's just ambient noise, it will be a little bit like this.
So then when I see that spike, I'll think, right.
Okay.
Yeah, that's where the take continues.
And that's just a little brief look at waveforms, but they're really handy.
And you can tell just literally by looking at this that this is where it's going to kick in.
First spike.
So we're right.
And as we can, if we continue that reading of the wave form all the way out, we can see that.
Here's that little fade down that we had when we were playing back.
And then, bang, it was that little spike at the end.
Let's listen.
And then it continues with that water, sand towards the end, like crashing waves.
But it's that boom.
That's yeah, it's that's understanding wave forms.
So now that we have the music, let's bring it in to the timeline.
So obviously anything up above this line is V.
So that's video one, two, three, four, five.
And anything below is a audio.
Audio.
One, two, three, four.
So let's grab this music and let's drag it down to our timeline.
And let's put it right up against the edge and let go.
Okay.
So if I hold down alt and scrolled down on my mouthfeel, that is the full track within that.
And this can be cut open just like you can with a video track.
But let's see how this plays back and let's see if it looks nice with what we're what we have here.
Okay.
So a couple of things.
I think firstly, I think the slow mo, the slow motion that we have in the video really complements
the music, which is great.
What I do think is that we need to now be listening to the music because the music can really often
dictate where we have cuts.
So let me just quickly go through this.
You can watch along and just see what you do.
I want to make I want to make something of this.
Okay.
I'm going to take a little bit of a creative flair here and see what we can do.
So first and foremost, as you heard, there was like two bars.
And I switched to the next video right on that point.
It felt natural.
What I'm actually going to do is take a little bit of of of creative license and I'm going to hit a
block at that point.
And I already know my footage, so I know what I'm going to bring in.
Let's get that right of in fact, I don't even have to play it back again.
We know where that is.
So we're going to put the play head right where that is, and I'm going to cut.
So I'm going to highlight that.
And remember our shortcut is the backslash that cuts there.
We could repo delete.
Let me undo that for a moment.
We could use W which trims everything to the right of that point.
But watch what happens.
We've actually cut the music as well.
If I grab this, you see how there's a cut there.
And if we listen, that's not what we wanted.
So I'm making sure that we're not cutting the audio.
We can lock it right here, but you'll be locking and unlocking all the time.
But let's go to right on that point, and I'm going to cut and I'm just going to delete that.
And then because the story is we've dropped in the wood pallets, we've set fire to them and we're now
closing the hopper.
I then want to come in to the fire showing from the other side with in the actual pizza oven.
So that's pizza oven, too.
You can see here that's pizza oven, too.
So let's just say that's my lovely wife that if I just scrub through.
Um.
I don't know.
No, I don't really want that.
What I want is the actual.
This is what I want.
I want the front.
That's what I'm shooting.
I get further in.
Oh, it's making me hungry now.
Okay, so let's get this bit of footage right now.
I want this.
Uh, right about there.
So remember we then here we press eye for ends.
That's where we want to start it playing a little bit.
That's probably enough.
Oh, and we just want the audio.
So remember, we track video only and track it down into our timeline and we don't want it here because
that's where we've got where I want it is where we can see the audio come back.
Let's see how that looks.
You ready?
Let's go from the beginning.
You see how just a simple cut to black and just building up that little bit of tension, that little
bit of tension between here, which is what if we start at nine and 13 frames and this bit, which is
ten and three frames, it's not even a second, but see how that's not quite on there.
Now, I could drag it, but here's a nice little tip if I've got this highlighted, if I hold down alt
and then just use the cursor, the arrow keys on my keyboard, I just pressed right there once and it's
actually that's just nudged by one frame.
You see how it is here?
10 seconds and four frames.
If I move back again and go to the ten and three frames who literally was just one frame, but for me,
it makes all the difference.
As you can see, I mean, that is as near as we can get it to there.
If we go to track one more, that's one frame and it's passed.
So yeah, that's something we're just going to have to live with.
But I don't think I'd as my as my father used to say, a blind man on a galloping almost wouldn't know
the difference.
Of course you would.
But let's just have a little I love this I love this moment now that we're creating with the music,
and it's so important to add it with music in mind.
It's such a lazy editor that just edits up the video and then just puts any music underneath it.
And if you're if you're in this course, then you clearly want to do something more than just chuck
a lot of video somewhere and put a bit of music on.
Let's just watch this again.
I like that.
So that's the start of anything to music or, you know, importing the audio and starting to work with
the audio.
What I want to do next is show you a couple of little things that we can do within audio on the audio
track to kind of change up certain things as and when you need to.
And that's what's coming up in the next chapter.


### 4. Working with Audio

So it's really now time to just really start working with audio and we're going to continue the process.
So to be able to work with the audio, you don't have to.
But we're also going to build on the video as well.
So we can yes, we can really get a feel of editing to video because I think a lot of people or a lot
of courses at least that I've I've seen and that I've purchased myself over the years, they don't really
touch too much on this.
And I think especially the way that video production is going, we're definitely, definitely going
into the realm of just one overall piece of video which encapsulates everything, not just a pretty
video, not just an infomercial, not just an informative piece or not just something that just looks
good.
It's got to feel good as well.
And music, the audio makes up at least half of that.
So let's build on this.
And I'm going to I'm going to kind of work through this and kind of stop at points where I feel we need
to stop and talk it through.
But I'm just going to describe what I'm doing and in as many places as I can, explain why I'm doing
something.
So first and foremost, we're going to get rid of this.
I know it was pretty, but we're just we're clearing up the space for now.
So just exactly what is it that I drew a marquee over it with the selection tool and just pressed delete,
done and dusted.
By the way, we will be looking through these.
I just think if if we address these too early on in our learning, it can it can confuse things.
So I'm teaching as and when you need to know first and foremost I hope some of you noticed I never did.
But remember when we labeled these tracks the first three tracks, video being voiceover, BGM being
background music and a three being SFX sound effects.
Well, this is on the wrong track.
Is that because this is background music?
So we're going to move this down to Channel two, which is right here.
Now, you can see there's a red line here and there's a red line here.
We can click it to get rid of it.
But what that does is it tells us that we have some peaking.
Where do we have peaking?
Well, it was in one.
Right.
And what was in one was music.
So let's have a quick playback do.
Everything seems fine.
Okay.
So what's happened is when this has been created, it's been bad.
It's been turned all the way up to to what could actually be almost well, this has eclipse.
It must just about clip, which is what happens when a piece of audio clips, it means it's gone too
loud.
And if it clips all the way past, if we look at the waveform again to look like this, if we look at
the waveform, as I said, right the way through the center, it's the same on both.
This is a stereo track.
So this is your right channel, this is your left channel.
And if right in the middle is silence, right at the end is as loud as we can get.
Now we can go louder technically.
But what that would then lead to is peaking and distortion and not the kind of cool distortion that
you get with an electric guitar.
We're talking distortion because it's far too loud and the thing is, you can get peaking and distortion
when it's far too loud and it doesn't sound loud.
It's just far too much for the channel.
So let's tilde to to get close to that and let's see if we can sort this out.
I will be showing your way to sort this out really easily.
Once you have maybe background music and voiceover and some sound effects, there's a great plug in
that I use that sorts out all these things.
It is a purchasable plug in, but if you're doing this a lot, it can really it can really just help
out everything.
But first and foremost, remember we talked about these sliders.
Let's just love this back up.
Because we're not using that right now.
And let's get rid of the sub mix.
We're going straight to the mix.
So let's have a look back.
Yes.
It's definitely on my hit where we where we peak well in dos and I try and drag it down just a little.
And just like with everything else and Adobe Premiere Pro, we can slide and affect it with some kind
of control.
But if you're looking down here as we pull down, it goes to minus and goes all the way through to this
symbol, which is infinity, which means absolutely quiet.
Let's just bring it back up here.
I'm just going to bring it let's let's just click in here and let's just type minus one and hit enter.
But see if that still clips, see how it's no longer there.
So we just went to minus one.
Well, I think whoever's exported this, they've put a brick wall limiter on it, which is exactly what
it sounds like.
It it doesn't bring it doesn't keep it below any kind of threshold.
It takes the threshold right up against the absolute limit.
And sometimes for the brick wall limiter, it can it can just ruin everything because it can take it
far too loud.
Also, if you imagine everything coming out, the speakers, this is only one channel.
If we add more channels, that's going to add to the general volume.
And so even if it's if this isn't peaking now, if we watch here on the on the other graphic, I see
the the yellow lines that are just there just momentarily.
What that does is it gives you a split second notification as to where the loudest point is.
And if we're really close that if we added anything else at this point, the mics would peak and it
would clip.
So we don't want that, but we will deal with that further down the line and I'll be showing you ways
of being able to turn up and down the the track of see the clip.
Sorry, because this is the clip and this is the track.
But yeah, let's build on this and let's see what else we can create.
So we first and foremost got these two clips and then we kind of stuck
a do like that in the next in the next section, which is adding motion, we're going to be building
on the manipulating media things that we did and remembering effects controls.
And I'm going to show you a really lovely effect that we can do with this.
But first and foremost, let's see where we're going to go.
So, yeah, let's do what I said.
Let's keep building on this.
I want to be out by then.
You see how we we kind of we've already set the precedent here with.
If you count into four, it's one, two, three, four, two, two, three, four.
And then we've moved.
So now cutting it down to one boss, we can count.
One, two, three, four.
I want to be out by the next one.
So with this highlighted, I'm going to hit my back, my back slash to cut it.
And I'm just going to select the second part that we don't want.
I'm going to delete.
Now, I want to easily and quickly get into the folder where all this footage is.
I could go into here and go to videos and double click and all that.
But there's a really easy way to do it, and it's right click here and reveal in Project Reveal and
Explorer would open a window, which is just off my screen at the moment.
And that opens the window with all of.
These things in here.
But what we don't what we want is we want to find the projects.
If we right click and review and project, there we are.
There's our pizza oven and that's where we're at.
So if we double click the pizza oven, which is this footage and that's there been set up there, um,
to scrubbing through.
That's everything that I wanted there.
These are new ways, flower beds we know through the winter now, but it's Yeah.
That's cut them all back.
But what a fun summer we had last summer so that's still a click into a pizza oven for and this is where
we were getting our pizza on.
Uh, you see how this handle these handles here?
I'm just going to come all the way out just to make sure I've got the full range of motion throughout
all of this.
And if we think this is our ops, the our output, this is our source, we've already got this open.
So I don't want to show it being opened, but I would like to show the pizza going in.
That's quite good.
And I had a little bit of a trouble getting it off peel as called a pizza peel.
It's got absolutely nothing to do with this course, but it's a term I learned last year and I'm sharing
it with you.
A big, huge tray that a pizza goes on.
It's called a pizza peel.
Well, you're welcome.
Just adding value.
So let's go.
Let's go back and let's grab it on a grab here.
So I'm going to have an endpoint here.
Scroll forward a little bit, don't where we're going to be with the music.
But I want to get towards the end and I'll show you how this is how I ate it.
That's everything that I want there.
Is that okay.
So I kind of want it from the point where Emma puts on the hand for to move there a little bit, but
hey Hope.
Well I'll be fine at work.
So I'm just zooming out a little bit here on the timeline just so I've got I can see everything where
it goes in and it just grabbing the audio and bearing in mind I need to turn back on snap snapping at
a timeline is so handy so very handy.
So I always keep that on and I'm going to track the video into here, see how much that takes up.
I'm just going to snap it but it right up against that.
So now if we zoom back in and hit spacebar to hit play.
Okay.
So that's where we're at here.
Now, I'm going to go a little bit further advance now with anything in the timeline.
And to do this, I'm going to use shortcuts.
But before we go any further, remember when I did a repo delete before and it affected the music?
I'll show you again now.
So let's say we want to put this here.
So I use backspace and cut.
Then if I go a bit further up here and then I use W to trim off the rest of that.
You see how again, it's, it's.
It's and it's the music as well.
And that's not what we want at all.
So I'm going to do is I'm going to lock this track just for now.
Don't forget again, it's not destructive.
Nothing is destructive.
But we just we want to be in a better position and we don't want to be chasing our tail later on.
Think, Oh, actually we've turned it to music that's been put in the wrong place and we don't want
to do that.
So this controls that again, to get rid of that cut, I'm just going to look.
That truck.
So if I do the same again, if I w which is reportedly from the end.
You see how we we've cut off the whole of that.
But the music has stayed untouched because it's on this track, which is locked.
And if I zoom by holding shift and scrolling up and then if I hold down control and scroll down, you
see how we're all coming up.
This kind of line is sticky and I can look all the way down the audio tracks.
And this is all completely grayed out.
So that's perfect.
By the way, if you ever have just problems and we're all over the place and you can't find a way to
get your time out looking how you want to, you can go to this little rent chair and you can go to minimize
all tracks and that just brings everything absolutely tiny as it was in the beginning.
You can also save presets.
So say when I'm improving.
If I'm improving, which is my or I see I've renamed all these if I'm in audio, no scripting.
Maybe now I used to have one called audio leveling, which I kind of I haven't used for ages, so I
kind of got rid of.
But let's just go back to automatic thing and say you wanted to mainly see the audio.
You could zoom in here, maybe pull this up here, and you could say that as a preset.
So you had more abilities within here.
You see this line that runs all the way through.
When we talk about that very soon, and to mainly manipulate this quite well, you need to have a very
tall audio form with in a waveform within the timeline.
So if that's how you want it, you could just literally hit that little spanner and save a preset and
you would put that in, you would name it as audio leveling preset.
So let's do that audio leveling.
Oh, let's make sure that the actual caps lock isn't turned on.
And if we hit enter that preset.
Oh, you see, I did actually have that preset already saved.
So if I go into there and find Ah, there we go.
Audio leveling.
There we go, we're already there.
We've got a nice total waveform ready for us and that will work in that situation.
Again, if you want to reset all the way back, we just minimize everything and we're back to where
we want to be.
The only thing that it won't affect is this middle bar here, so you can always move this around how
you wish.
So now that we've got a base established, we're now going to start building within here as we've already
started.
But we can cut and trim and all that without worrying about affecting the audio.
So let's just play that back.
I think that works quite well to get to that point.
By the way, some of these clothes aren't quite right.
We're going to be playing with those in a later chapter as well on color correction and grading.
So for now, if you're thinking, oh, that's a little bit brighter, that's a little bit dark, we
can play with that and we will adjust those a little bit later on.
But and it is actually best practice to do it right now, but I'm not going to do it right now because
I don't want to get all caught up with that.
But we will address it.
I promise.
That's the cut that I want right on that beat.
So I'm just going to backslash to that.
And as they're throwing that off.
So, Rothman, coming back up to here, what I'm actually going to do, because obviously this is in
there and up to that, I'm going to drag this all the way out.
So I've actually now got this whole clip, which is all the way from there to 4:00.
Okay, cool.
So that's that's where our course is.
Now, let's see where I want to go into.
Maybe here.
Let's see how that works.
It's all about playing.
So rather than cutting and then selecting that and then deleting and removing that up.
Undo controls that, controls that, controls that.
What I'm going to do is, well, there's two things more I could do to do exactly the same thing I could
cut and I could hold down shift and press delete, which deletes the actual clip and then moves everything
up or even one less cut.
That's where we cut.
Before I could highlight that and press Q on my keyboard, this is default keyboard shortcut and that
is to trim and it ripple delete from the beginning.
So everything to the left.
Q Delete everything to the left.
W Delete everything to the right.
I say delete it, trim.
It removes the clip, it doesn't delete it.
Nothing's ever delete it unless you delete it in here, in the program, in the project area.
But at that point, we want to.
Q So we want to put everything before it, and let's see how that works.
Okay.
It took a lot longer than I thought it would be to get it off the peel.
So actually, I'm going to bring it back maybe just to here.
Let's see how that works.
I'm going to cue again.
Let's run that again.
Good.
And I've just posed it right on that next beat and let me somewhat with it.
We're close and cue again, and
I'm not going to be out at that point on that beat.
I just play that back
spacebar, going to cut that.
I'm going to delete the rest of that.
So if we have a quick look back, this is what we have so far.
Good.
I'm happy with that so far.
So now what we want to do is I want to add a few more audio bits.
Now that we are what we're at 20 seconds and I know it feels like we've taken a long time to get to
this stage, but that's because I've been explaining everything all the way to get to this point.
In an edit generally it would probably take me, including labeling the footage, bring all the footage
in, and it would probably take me about 10 minutes to get to this point.
And then everything just speeds up as you go through the creative process.
And you build up and you build up and you build up.
And yeah, what we're actually going to do is we're going to create something that's a minute long,
which would fit on all social media.
And then I'm going to show you how to them make it actually fit on all sorts of social media because
obviously 69, although it nowadays can fit on Instagram, it's not necessarily always the best way
to to post.
So maybe you want it square.
We can do that.
Obviously we going to be cropping off bit, but anyway we're going to head ourselves.
So now what I want to do is I want to introduce more audio elements.
So what I want is some spoken dialogue to be able to put into here and seen as a live label, this video
or voiceover.
What I'm going to do is I'm actually going to record some of the text that's on the website for this
pizza of it, because, as I said, I'm a professional videographer.
My company, we provide photo and video services for businesses.
But also, as you saw before, I have my own YouTube channel and from time to time it's mainly gadgets,
but I get sent products to review.
And just out of the blue, this company reached out and said, Do you fancy reviewing a pizza of it?
And I'd actually just recently reviewed a a beer brewing home system, so I guess that's why I came
up on their radar.
So these are outdoors and I've got to the about page and I think this bit of text would would do well.
It's enough for me to record.
So I'm going to move that off this screen to a different screen so I can read from that.
And I could record this outside of Premiere Pro, but I thought I'd show you how to do it Inside Premiere
Pro so you can see how to do that.
First and foremost, I'm going to unlock the music purely just so I can mute it and then lock it up
again, just so I can't touch it and bother it.
But now that's nicely muted and in track one, which is where we're at, it's just 12 that down don't
have any effects on here.
We are going to play with some of these effects once I've recorded the voiceover, but here is where
I'm going to record the voiceover.
So I'm going to press AR on here to enable track recording and because my input is my focus rate USB
audio, this is a great, great audio interface.
And into the USB audio interface, I actually have a really rather expensive shotgun microphone that
I'm recording this on and hopefully this screen recording will allow me to record not only to the screen
recording, but also to here at the same time.
There's only one way to find out.
So if you if there's a certain point in a video where you want to start recording your voiceover, you'll
set an endpoint.
So remember on here, we set in and out points in the source.
Down here you can set in an up points member when we pre-rendered I could set an endpoint there.
So that's where I kind of want to start my voiceover and then start recording and it would start from
there.
But I want to start from the beginning so I can either set my endpoint there or just click in and out
and it will start from the beginning.
So all I need to do now is I need to press record on there.
I've armed the track, that's what it's called, arming the track.
I've enabled it for recording and then I just hit this and once I hit this, it will count down 3 to
1 and then stop playing back and I'll start recording.
Now, some programs show the waveform being built as you record Adobe Audition does that, but it doesn't
end here, so you can kind of start to doubt yourself.
However, sometimes things change in Adobe or Adobe products, so it might start building up a complete
layer of me.
Anyway, let's see if I can get this done in one take.
It probably is more it's more text than is needed here, but I'm going to do it all even if we go into
past here, because we're going to build up on this as well.
So, okay, without further ado, let's record the voiceover when we think of.
Outdoor cooking, we think back to nature log fires, open flames and a good char on the food being
served.
That is why our biggest focus for our products is making sure you get that authentic wood fired taste,
whether it is from the rolling fire of our pizza oven or the blazing log burning fire from our Olympia
Grill, we have you covered.
Our range of log burners and chimneys are also the perfect garden accessory and showing you can stay
warm late into the evening, enabling you to enjoy those long summer nights.
Okay, I'm just going to stop that there.
As you can see, that's recorded.
I think that's just recorded on the left channel, which is great because I can show you what to do
if you only have audio on the left channel.
However, this did cover a number of products that we're not showcasing in here.
But I've just seen further down the Web page that I have this little bit of text with, which is which
is regarding the number one pizza oven.
So let's record that as well and see if we can maybe get rid of some of the audio I've already recorded
here and replace it.
So now we don't want to start recording from the beginning.
So I'm going to set an endpoint just maybe a little bit off here and I'm going to amend again and continue
recording.
So it's going to do a 3 to 1 in black because there's nothing playing, and then it will continue to
play through here where there's no video, but that's where we're just laying voiceover.
Okay, let's carry on.
When it comes to pizza, making our number one pizza oven is the go to family choice we have kept.
We have carefully designed the ovens so that there is a perfect flow of heat throughout, and you can
be cooking in as little as fit.
And I do that again.
We have carefully designed the ovens so that there is a perfect flow of heat throughout and you can
be cooking in as little as 15 minutes.
The steel pizza base is different from the traditional stone used in most ovens, as we believe from
rigorous testing that this gives you the perfect crisp base to your pizza.
Okay.
I just want to point out a couple of things that I remember when I talked about the clap and the and
the spike.
As you can see, if I just zoom in here a bit, I can see it already.
That's where my spike is.
That's just going to confirm.
We have carefully designed good.
So that's showing exactly where we want to cut that.
But before we do that, let me just clear the in and out just because it really hurts my eyes.
Remember, we have stereo channels here, and if I look down here, we have the left on the top, on
the right on the bottom.
However, the way that the focus rate is in to my system, it only records into the left channel.
That's no problem.
I have two inputs on here and sometimes I use the other inputs.
So I split left and right and there's a reason for that.
And that's because I don't want a full mono signal coming in and I can duplicate the left into the right
to simulate a stereo recording.
This is exactly what I do when I actually do a quick edit of the screen recording.
So I'm so glad I'm able to show you now how I do that.
So any, any audio that drops in, that's a stereo file that doesn't have it on both.
This is so easy.
Just think top left, bottom right.
So if you were kind of looking at with your head turned to the right, your left eye is on the left
and the right eye is on the on the bottom does I think it makes sense anyway.
So we want to duplicate the right channel.
With the left channel, this is as easy as right clicking and going to audio channels.
Now you see how left is left and right is right to us.
Do anything else other than getting right to be left.
That makes sense.
So left is reading the left.
I want the right to read the left as well.
So just tick that and press.
Okay.
And hey presto, we now have a stereo pair in that one channel.
We have you covered.
We do have you covered.
Nicely done.
We just do the same for the for the other clip as well.
So we go to right click audio channels and we want the left there as well.
So we now have stereo all the way through for this voiceover.
So let's now go through and I'm just going to actually I'm going to close, I'm going to toggle the
output of the video to off just so it doesn't distract us and I'm going to lock that as well.
Now you can do this audio editing in other programs like Adobe Audition.
Again, if you get the suite, you can use Adobe Audition as well, but it's just as easy doing it in
this one.
It's just a quick drop in of a voiceover.
And just to let you know, actually, I, I first got into audio editing.
My background is entertainment.
I used to be a singer, I used to work on ships, they used to tour, and my wife and I used to produce
shows.
We now work together producing videos, but we used to produce shows and I cut my teeth in editing,
starting with audio app.
And it's it was so easy to pick up from audio to video because it's an alley, it's a non-linear editor
and it all works exactly the same just with an added element of visual as well.
So let's see where we're at.
I'm just going to zoom in.
Obviously, that's where I had a bit of silence and play this back.
When we think of outdoor cooking, we think back to nature.
Okay, so what I could do is I could start affecting this now, but this is where I use the audio track
mixer over the audio clip mixer.
Let's just keep going and I'll show you.
Okay?
So I'm just going to trim off the end of that and I'm going to shift and delete to move it all the way
to the beginning.
When we think of outdoor cooking, we think back to nature, log fires, open flames and a good char
on the food being served.
Good.
That's good.
I like that.
That is why our biggest focus for our products is making sure you get that authentic wood fired taste,
whether it is from the rolling.
Okay, so this this doesn't really quite work because my voice is still a wood fired taste, whether
it is from the rolling fire of our pizza oven or the blade, because I now go into listing things.
So I'm going to do this bit again as a drop in.
But I don't want anymore.
I don't want the rest of this because this goes into their other products.
So actually I'm just going to delete that and I'm going to set an output out point of here, an endpoint
of the note that oh, an endpoint of the output of that.
When I start recording, you might hear me speaking a little bit just here because it plays back before
it does a 3 to 1 and it plays a couple of seconds before to kind of get you in the mood and get you
in the mood, get you up to speed.
So where was that?
I'm playing it, being served and served along.
Let me get a good char on the food being served on the good char on the food being served.
So that's there.
So what I'm going to then drop in is that is why our biggest focus for our products is making sure you
get that authentic wood fired taste.
I'm going to put a full stop there and that's just going to be a standalone, standalone little sentence.
So let's record and ARM and let's continue the good char on the food being served.
That is why our biggest focus for that was rubbish.
So we just go again, delete that.
On that and a good char on the food being served.
That is why our biggest focus for our products is making sure you get that authentic wood fired taste.
I'm happy with that.
Okay.
Obviously, we've come in with just the left channel again.
So right click and audio channels, both left boom, done, clever and in, out left.
That is why our biggest focus for our products is making sure you get that authentic woodfired taste
good.
I'm going to shorten that off just to make sure we we only have what we need.
And then I'm going to go through this second bit, which was about the actual the wood the wood fired
pizza oven that we're talking about.
I'm just going to trim this a little bit, so I'm just highlighting that I'm pressing.
Q Just to bring it right back to the beginning, remember, we have all other tracks locked, so we
can't affect any of the track when it comes to pizza.
Making our number one pizza oven is the go to family choice.
We have cat see our clapper didn't actually clap that loud but I could see from it doesn't look like
a nice rolling waveforms I knew I kind of must have done that.
So let's do a quick edit here choice.
So backslash to to cut or add edit and I'm picking back up there, so I'm going to pause up there.
Q Which will cut there, delete everything before and move everything up?
Turn my choice.
We have carefully designed the oven so that there is a perfect flow of heat throughout and you can be
cooking in as little as fit.
And I do that again.
Good.
That's good.
Way to pick it up from we have kept good is that the same point we have?
Carefully good.
So again, we're getting rid of all of this, going to go right from there.
And Q Again, this is going to cut remove that and push everything up.
Good.
Go back a couple of seconds.
Each choice we have carefully designed the oven so that there is a perfect flow of heat throughout and
you can be cooking in as little as 15 minutes.
Okay.
I've got quite a bit of silence there.
If you hear here and a lot of a lot of voiceover artists do this, you'll hear me take a breath, but
then I'll hold it for a second.
And that just gives me, you know, a little breath there.
And then I hold it.
That is just to give me the chance to cut right there so I don't get to.
And how do you know?
I mean, the breath doesn't run into the first word because that's so it's really annoying to edit for
any kind of editors.
You'll, you'll, you'll come across that and you'll have voiceover actors and you're like, Oh, please,
just give me a beat in between the breath.
Good because it back with the kill the steel pizza base is different from the traditional stone used
in most ovens, as we believe from rigorous testing that this gives you the perfect crisp base to your
pizza.
Good.
I'm happy with that.
Now we're going to paste this a little bit more, but just with that vocal and this vocal works about
46 seconds.
So that gives us 15 seconds to play with to get this under a minute.
Good.
Okay.
Let's carry out.
So I'm going to unlock the the the video.
Now I'm going to talk about back on.
I'm going to shrink this back a little bit.
And I, before we go any further, I'm going to get this audio sounding exactly how I want it.
Let's just listen.
When we think of outdoor cooking, we think back to nature.
Now, if you see here, we're looking in track one.
Let's just have a look at that fader.
We were kind of coming in around minus four when we think of outdoor cooking.
We think back to nature, not minus four, say, plus four.
These are decibels.
That's what we're looking at.
Log fires, open flames and a good char on the food being served.
That is why our biggest focus for up now with the music that might fit.
I might have to tighten it a little bit.
Remember this?
This little break off and then the bang here.
I might have to speed that text up a little bit, but not by speeding it up, but by cutting up and
making it just pace a little bit better.
Better.
But first and foremost, let's get the audio sounding better.
So we're on track once.
Let's twirl down here in the audio mixer.
And remember when I told you about the multi-band compressor?
So in video voiceover, you see how BGM is grayed out because we've got it locked, so we can't actually
do anything to this.
You can't do anything.
That's because it's locked.
It doesn't just lock that truck.
It locks everything within the track mixture as well.
It's really handy.
So we're on track one for the voiceover video and we're just going to drop this down.
We're going to go to amplitude and compression and we're going to go to multi-band compressor.
Now let's just see what difference that's made.
When we think of outdoor cooking.
Has it made any difference?
When we think of outdoor cooking while we can check because this little effect button here that's just
showing right now, if I click it, it disables it.
You see how it turns blue with a line through it.
Let's listen again.
When we think of outdoor cooking, it's done nothing because I haven't selected anything yet.
Let's just play it back again and toggle on and off and see.
When we think of outdoor cooking, we think back to nature.
I mean, there's the tiniest little change, but really there's there's absolutely nothing.
So we're going to we've we've put the multi-band compressor in here.
We're going to double click this and now remember this.
Can you remember from this dropdown?
Which one I selected?
It was.
It was broadcast right at the top.
But let's have a listen to.
Walkie talkie.
Walkie talkie.
When we think of outdoor cooking.
Now, you the minute you heard that, you probably thought of ways in which you've heard that in videos
before.
Not just not necessary people talking to walkie talkie, but maybe if you've got audio that's going
from maybe an old time radio or something.
When we think of outdoor cooking, it's it's such a handy little almost.
Well, it's a preset.
It's preset within the multi-band compressor.
And I don't know many editors who use the multi band compressor and it's brilliant.
So let's go for broadcast now, just like this little button here.
I can turn this off here, see how it's toggled for for the the effects to turn off.
And you may have noticed that this although it's a floating window when I click here, it doesn't get
rid of it.
So we can tweak things in here as we're playing back.
So without it on, remember when we think of outdoor cooking, I'm going to turn it on now and listen
to the difference.
When we think of outdoor cooking, it's so much more forward.
It's boosting everything that needs to be boosted.
It's just lovely.
We think back to nature now.
You could spend so much time playing around with e cue and audio settings, but honestly, nine times
out of ten and I do this professionally throwing on broadcast can really help sort any kind of audio.
It's brilliant.
And let me just zoom in here because I'm going to get this timed now.
I'm happy with that.
It works well for what we want it for now we may build on it, but let's just get this timed perfectly
because if I it's unlocked that let's on that and let's just mute that ring.
Let's just remind ourselves of the music.
Okay.
So we don't want anything here.
And as you can see right now, that end bit is over here on the food being served.
That is it.
Yeah, I get kind of I want it.
I want to make more of that.
So I don't want that playing.
So let's just I just want to meet this for now and let's just lock that and actually to make it easier,
I'm just going to lock the video as well, just so I can use the shortcuts to the best of my ability,
you know, to kind of like reportedly ignore that and just be able to move everything.
So let's just play it back and let's look for the silences.
I'm looking really here, I'm looking here, I'm looking here and trying to just tighten it up a little
bit, but still sounding naturally astounding, natural.
When we think of outdoor cooking, we think back to nature log fires, open flames and a good char on
the food being served.
Okay, this is going to be a little bit I was going to say it's going to be a little bit of a hack job.
It's really nice just finessing.
So I'm going to get right to the end of that little bit.
I'm just going to cut some use my back, my back slash just to the left of that.
And I'm going to go a little bit further over cue to bring this up.
And let's have a listen to a couple of seconds of let's see if that still sounds not outdoor cooking.
We think back to.
Of out.
We think of outdoor cooking, we think back to nature.
I kind of it's all I'm happy with that it's okay.
Let's do the same with this little silence here.
You actually hear me?
Breathe in there.
So it's good to get that out.
I do breathe, though.
It's not a it's not a as we think back to nature, log fires, open flames that's that break is I know
it's a list, but that break is low.
It's too too long.
So let's again, let's cut that and that's repo deleted from about there.
I want to do something a little bit different here, though.
If we listen, log fires, open flames, it doesn't sound too bad, but just to make sure it feels it
doesn't feel as abrupt at all.
I'm going to hold on control.
And we've done this before and I'm going to select the joint between those two.
Now, remember, our default transition default transition in video is crossed dissolve if we go into
audio transitions and crossfade there's only three on this constant gain, constant power and exponential
fade.
I will sometimes use exponential fade, but that's at the end.
Constant power is my default transition.
We can see because it's got a blue box around it.
So if I hit shift in D, that applies the transition.
Remember we had it set for a second.
Let's just see how that works.
Log fires.
Open flames.
Eyes open flame.
You can't hear the cut.
Not that you could before, but you definitely can't now.
Because there's definite audio all the way through and there's no abrupt cuts.
Worked really well.
If you ever need to do that with audio, especially with audio.
Okay, let's just check this other little section, hymns and a good char.
Log fires, open flames and a good char on the food being served.
Now, I'm quite happy with that finish in there because remember that little spike?
That's where we've got the music banging.
So.
Let's just highlight all this.
The reason why I just zoomed out there and made sure that I had all of this is because if I just stayed
in here and grabbed this and just moved it off, I'd overwrite the audio there.
And you can do that also with video and it can just ruin everything.
Now there's a couple of ways I could move everything up, and I could do just literally what I was about
to do, which was highlight them all and just move them along, which works perfectly.
Or I could use the shortcut.
And before I show you the shortcut, I'll show you the button.
And that's up here.
And that is Track Select Forward Tool.
And that's a if I click that all of a sudden rather than this pointer, we have this pointer and that's
showing you a double black arrows going right.
If I now just click once, that literally selects everything to the right.
It hasn't selected this and it hasn't selected this because those tracks are locked.
If I unlocked that and clicked again, it would select all of these.
Now, if I just track it moves everything that's selected, it's really handy.
Little tool.
Let me just lock that again.
The shortcut for track select forward is a the shortcut for the selection tool is V.
Knowing those two, you can go between those two without ever leaving here just by using your keyboard.
So to move everything up, I just tap a on my keyboard, I just drag them up, hit V and I go back to
my selects until you see how much easier that is than either going like this and like this.
Although I still do some do do that at that times or coming up here, clicking that button, grabbing
that, moving it up, going back up here.
Now, that doesn't sound like much, but if you've got to do that a lot, 100 times in an edit that
took, what, maybe about an extra second, you're saving yourself 100 seconds.
Now, that sounds nothing, but there's another button here, which is the razor tool, which if we
click this and click down here that added an edit.
Well, we already have a shortcut to add an edit and that is the backslash.
Again, if we had to come up here and click this and come back down and click and then come back up
here and then carry on with Selection Tool, you're going to do that for every single cut that's adding.
I was going to say hours and it can it can add hours to the the the editing, the post-processing of
an edit and time is money.
And we're going to get into that later on in this course.
How time is money and how certain things not just the shortcuts here, but if we if we think about the
term shortcut and we apply it to maybe plugins member, we had to play with the transitions before.
If we think about plugins time all of a sudden really is on our side.
And I'm sure there's a song about that by the Rolling Stones, but let's not go.
Okay, so let's see how this works with the music and let's see how it feels.
So I'm back in the sequence.
I'm going to press home on the keyboard to go back to the beginning and let's let's listen to it.
When we think of outdoor cooking, we think back to nature.
Log fires open for.
And a good char on the food being served.
Opposed it right there because I thought the break in the voiceover we'd want it coming back in around
there.
Let me see if I'm right.
Let me see if it feels right.
Put char on the food being served.
That is why our biggest focus.
Yeah.
Okay.
That works for me.
Now, you've probably noticed that this music is a little bit loud in comparison to the voiceover.
We're going to deal with that very soon.
And it's a great little tip.
But let's just move on.
In fact, what I want to do is I'm going to just turn this down for now, just so we can work with it
easier and see where we're at or our products is making sure you get that authentic wood fired taste.
Okay.
Let me bring this up.
Let's just quickly position all these.
When it comes to pizza, making our number one pizza oven is the go to family choice.
Here this up.
Let's see if that can go straight into that choice.
We have carefully designed the oven so that there is a perfect flow of heat throughout and you can be
cooking in as little as 15 minutes.
I thought that was a nice bit to leave that.
I'll see if we can cover that with nice better B-roll if we then bring in this last little bit, we're
up to what we up to at the end of the 5 to 15 seconds.
That's good.
Let's listen to this.
The steel pizza base is different from the traditional stone used in most ovens, as we believe from
rigorous testing, that this gives you the perfect crisp base to your pizza.
Okay, I'm happy with that.
Let's just bring that up.
I'm just going to do a little fade in and fade out of this one.
And just just so it doesn't there's no abruptness.
I know I can't hear you at the moment, but I've got my headphones quite quiet.
So I want to select this.
And this easy way to do that is to hold down control and drag, say and we've got that.
And now what do we do?
How do we apply our default transition?
Shift.
Andy.
Good.
So now we have this.
The steel pizza base to your pizza.
Perfect.
And quite often, I'll also come through here and I'll do exactly the same.
So control and drag all the way through the audio and shift D Let's see how that feels.
When we think of outdoor cooking, we think back to nature log fires, open flames and a good char on
the food being served.
That is why our biggest fault.
Okay.
I think we need to bring the audio in a little bit earlier, actually.
I think maybe on the second beat there.
That is why our maybe even earlier on the food being served.
That is why our biggest focus for our products is making sure you get that authentic wood fired taste.
When it comes to pizza, making our number one pizza oven is the go to family choice.
Okay, good.
So now we aren't only being dictated by the music, but we're being dictated by what's being said as
well.
So what did he.
What did he.
What did I just say?
You know, just play it back.
When it comes to pizza, making our number one pizza oven is the go to family choice we have carefully
designed.
Okay, let's so we want some of the actual pizza oven itself.
So let's right click and go to project.
So it just back in here and okay we're into.
Okay so that's just a that and looking through this this is a great way to skim through and just to
make sure everything you're not missing any of the footage pizza it was absolutely gorgeous.
Let me just zoom out here and make sure that we've got Google code and then we're, of course, in the
the pizza.
Good.
Okay.
So what we want to do again, when it comes to pizza, making our number one place, we've just shown
the going is the okay.
So I still want to kind of show the actual pizza oven.
But
yeah, you see how the fire's coming out the back there as well.
That that's great.
So I'm going to set an endpoint that in fact you see how it wasn't really moving at the beginning there.
I'm going to set an out point there, but I'm actually going to go further back and see if I just stayed
still just a little bit longer.
A date.
Okay, let's set an endpoint now.
Let's see how that feels just in the video, only
when it comes to pizza making our number one pizza oven good.
Okay.
I'm happy with that.
Let's see what else we can do.
I'm just going to let's just listen to that for the music.
When it comes to pizza making our number, that's where we want to come out of it.
Boom, in our number.
That's where I want to go.
Okay.
So I'm going to get that right back to that, but I'm actually going to then drag it out and I'm going
to cut.
So that's where I want the next piece of video to come and check it out a little bit further.
The thing is, you've probably noticed there's no cut and fast rule of how to edit.
It's just knowing how to work the actual software.
I'm just going to add a cut that can I add a cook before our number one pizza oven is the goat.
Yeah.
Okay.
So I don't want that.
It wants to be as much as my hand comes in.
That's good.
So see how I'm intentionally now overwriting that and not using Q or W now because all of these are
unlocked and I just I need to unlock and lock and all that.
And we want the freedom to be able to move around the audio if we need to, although I don't think we
will.
But I'm just I'm intensely overwriting now.
Let's have a listen.
KING Our number one pizza oven is the go to I want to cut again on that music
I think with and done with that footage which was five so let's delete the rest of that let's come back
in to number six and where we hear, okay, that's quite good.
Maybe, you know, it's good as she's turning it.
Okay I'm going to use bits of this
back and again is good.
And then she closes that again.
Okay so.
Let's just track that and make sure that the end see at the right hand side here.
Just make sure the end isn't overriding everything.
It's not overwriting even.
Okay, let's bring that in.
Let's see how this is.
Look, number one pizza oven is the go to family choice.
We have carefully designed a cut back and listen to the music as well as the audio and another.
Let's get there.
She's already moving forward.
Intentionally overwriting a go to family choice.
We have carefully designed the oven so that there is a perfect flow of heat.
Okay.
That looked a little bit messy, so let's pick it up there instead.
We have carefully designed the oven so that there is a perfect flow.
Okay.
Okay.
I'm using that anyway.
And I'm going to.
Yeah, that's good.
I'm going to cut to.
I'm now.
I'm now just using my left and right buttons, the curses sorry, the left and right buttons on my keyboard.
And I'm going to maybe go from there again backslash to cut and then I'm going to drag and overwrite
that.
I went too far.
This is where, again, the snapping is great because you see how that black line is now there between
and I just drop back.
It's a perfect flow of heat throughout and you can be cooking.
That's good.
And then I'm going to be.
Okay.
Let's just delete that now and.
Come back two throughout and you can be cooking in as little as 15 minutes.
That's all we've got of that clip.
That's.
If it can be cooking in as little as 15 minutes.
Okay, that's good.
And then we have.
We can't just leave it black.
So let's get some more.
Don't forget, the most important thing about making a video or filming a video is you always need more
B-roll than you think you have.
So.
I think I'm just about going to have enough.
Let's come in here.
And actually, I'm just going to track this whole clip because I know that we start from getting the
pizza out.
I make it all the way to the actual table outside and the cutting of the pizza.
I can still almost taste that pizza, so I'm going to drag all of this.
Just the video only.
Enter here.
Okay, so let's again, let's put that up and let's see where we're at in as little as 15 minutes.
Okay.
Let's start cutting with the music.
I can probably cheat and get a little bit there as well.
Minutes.
Good.
And what else are we saying?
The steel pizza base is different from the traditional stone.
Okay, so that's what we're talking about.
So I'm going to put that I'm going to move that up because that's kind of in the background, but it's
in shot at that point.
The steel pizza base is different from the traditional stone used in most ovens works quite well because
the pizzas ever so slightly out of shape.
I'd like to say that was intended, but no, I just wasn't quick to follow my wife with the with the
pizza and let's get it.
Okay.
This is out of focus here right now.
We're focused in on that.
Let me just cut this now, because I think it's a nice moment.
Let's see if that quickly comes into focus.
Oh.
Okay.
Maybe a little bit later and from that.
Yeah.
Okay.
So I'm just going to again intentionally overwrite.
The steel pizza base is different from the traditional stone.
You.
Now, we're going to do something with this clip a little bit later.
I'm not going to do it now because I know it's coming next.
And it's actually in the next chapter, a chapter with adding emotion, building on the knowledge of
the manipulating media section.
So remind me when we get here, we're going to do something here.
In fact, I'm going to remind myself and how do I do that?
We'll do something that we haven't done yet and that's marking out this.
It's really quite simple.
And that is you can marking in two different places within premiere pro you can either mock clip, whether
it be a video or audio or you can mark a path on the timeline.
Now what I will do is I'm actually going to mark a part on a timeline only because I know that this
isn't going anywhere, you know what I mean?
This is in this place in the sequence where it's going to be obviously all those things can change.
But I've decided that that's where it's going to be.
But if it wasn't and I wanted to mark a part in a clip, I'd simply think, Right, okay, this is where
I want to remind myself that this is I'm going to do something with this clip and with the clip highlighted,
I can just press am and you see how a little mark has been added to here.
It's actually been added to here as well.
And if I double click that and what I can do while this is still on the mark if I press am again.
It will bring me up with a little bit of a text here.
And what I can do is I can add something about the marker that I want to draw the attention to.
So I'm going to put in here motion because that's what we're going to be doing.
Don't give too much away, but motion and the mark color, it doesn't really stand out too well.
So I'm going to mark as red as well.
In fact, a little white and I'm going to hit.
Okay.
And that white.
Doesn't actually stand out of here.
But what did I say?
I said I was going to market on the actual sequence.
So that's control.
Z controls it and if I click out so nothing is selected and I press M now the marker is up here and
it's actually much clearer when it's away from everything.
So I'm going to leave it that club and I'm going to press M again, which will bring up again my dialog
box here.
I'm going to type in again motion and I'm going to put some comments in here and that is, I'm going
to say key framing.
I'm giving you even more, but that's all I'm going to say here.
I'm going to press.
Okay, so that's now my mark over here.
Now, if I came along, when we come along next and we see this, if I mouse over this, this now tells
me motion key framing if I double click that.
I could actually bring up that marker again if it was a lot of text in here.
This is really helpful when you're working between teams and you want to leave a comment on someone's
work, whether it be good or bad.
That works perfectly, really, really well for that.
Anyway, so leave that mark on that and let's move along.
Your pizza base is different from the traditional stone used in most ovens, as we believe from rigorous
testing.
I'm going to cook there on that music, people.
I'm going to take it to where she's just sliding it out to ovens, as we believe from rigorous testing,
that this gives you the perfect crit factor.
I'm going to do it there as the peel comes out.
This is appeal of I told you that.
And I'm very proud of myself for knowing a technical term because two pizzas.
Let's just have a look at that little bit of a sequence against, as we believe from rigorous testing,
that this gives you the perfect crisp base to your pizza.
That's good pizza.
Let me just I want to see where I want to use the perfect crisp base to your pizza.
I know the Emma goes back in with the pizza cutter, and I'm just thinking, this gives you the perfect
crisp base to make the wind that that hits that boom time.
Look at this way from base to is right on the top of that I just go there that's where I'm going to
cut.
It's a really lovely moment, but I do want to be in there for too long because I want to tell the actual
story as well.
It
okay, let's just cut there and let's delete all that and let's bring that up and let's see, however,
that this gives you the perfect crisp base to your pizza.
Okay.
I want it when she's actually just getting to the edge.
So I'd like to go up there.
I'd love to.
All in one movement, but hey ho.
Crisp base to your pizza.
Okay, good.
I'm just going to cut that and get rid of the rest of that.
I'm also going to label.
And which one did I think opens as we believe from rigorous testing, that this gives you the perfect
crisp base to your.
Yeah.
So I'm going to mark this as well.
Am, am.
And I'm also going to put motion here as well.
If I want to do some, I'm going to pretty much do the same thing I'm going to do on here.
Pretty much a very similar on here as well.
So good.
So we have a look back and see how it feels when we think of outdoor cooking, we think back to nature,
log fires, open flames and a good char on the food being served.
That is why our biggest focus for our products is making sure you get that authentic wood fired taste.
Okay, so we're we're we're kind of there.
We've got the basis of what we're working with.
However, the audio is just not right.
So let's click double click that slide of the music and bring that back up.
And let's just go back to the beginning when we think of outdoor.
Okay, now what I'm going to do now is use a plug in and actually, you know what?
No, I'm not.
I'm going to show you the in-built first and then I'll show you how easy it is to use a plug in.
But actually this is a new thing.
With regards to audio in Premiere Pro, it does make it a lot easier.
So let's just go to the audio workspace for now.
As I said before and as we did right at the beginning, we like to set up our are all our workspaces.
Is that my saved audio workspace.
Didn't think so.
Okay.
So this is my audio workspace.
In fact, that has changed because I much prefer it like there by the way, recognize this.
It's the same as what is audio clip doing that.
Let's close that panel and that's save the changes saves new workspace let's say audio and hopefully
it will overwrite Aux audio.
One.
And then.
Yeah.
Okay.
I'll deal with that later.
We don't want audio clip anywhere near anything ever.
I really wish Adobe would get rid of it, but maybe there's one guy who's been using it for about 15
years who still uses it.
So anyway.
So this is the same as this bad boy.
Oh, cooking.
We think back to nature.
Log fires open for.
And a good char on the food being served.
That's it.
And we're clipping again here.
Why is that?
Because we're at zero.
But don't worry.
We're going to rectify all this.
So how do we get it all sorted?
Well, first, I want the audio, the music to be the right time.
Now that we can take this into a different program, we can take this into Audio Adobe Audition, and
we can sort that out.
However, by the time you see this, you will actually have somewhere in here called Remix.
I know it's coming, but it's not here yet.
And in Remix you can rather than you see this duration.
You can tick this.
You can set your target duration, and it will all automatically cut and remix the music.
If we set this now for target duration, it actually just speeds it up.
I'll show you 55 seconds.
Let's say we want it for 59 seconds, because that will then allow us some titles and stuff, let's
say zero zero and 59 seconds and zero zero frames if I enter.
Everything has been brought up.
I know.
Well, you've been a judge.
Have a listen.
Oh, it's got to render it first.
When we think of undo copying and we think
that's not what we intended.
I just soloed this, by the way, when we muted before I said about this so you could hear it in all
its glory without my voiceover.
It's not really what we're looking for.
But as I said, when you by the time you get here, there will be something here called Remix.
Or if not, it will be very, very shortly being released.
It's in the beta version at the moment.
However, I don't run beta on my my system purely because I do this for a living.
If I have a beta version of Premiere Pro, it can fail and I can lose things and I can't afford to lose
things because I have pain clients.
But here's the way that I've always done it when I've wanted to stay within Premiere Pro and not because
this remix has been in Adobe Audition for years.
But anyway, let's show you just a nice, quick and easy way to trim it.
So let's go to the end and let's hear where I feel we could come in.
And so.
Doesn't it sound weird?
That is no.
Back to the normal speed.
Let's have a listen.
I think with a.
Sorry my wife gets so mad because sometimes I do things so quickly and they don't explain.
Let me just find it again.
Make the call and then I'll show you.
See, I just literally hit that as it was playing back.
I mean, just play and see if I definitely got out on the beat and it.
Yeah.
Okay, cool.
So let's go up here.
It should go through once.
Okay.
Cool.
Happy with that?
So what I want is for this pair.
Right here to be around one minute.
So I need to find somewhere earlier on that I can drop it in so that this is around one minute.
Okay, let's go back.
Let's meet that.
Okay.
We're in a different section in the music, so okay, this is going to be a little bit more difficult,
but we can make it work.
Okay.
I've just cut back because I know it's quite, quite a decent length.
Okay.
You can see what I've done.
Let me just get rid of that bit and let's just direct this music up here and see where we're at.
Doesn't always work that perfectly.
Let's play back and see if it works.
Okay?
Okay.
Maybe it doesn't work so perfectly.
Let's hear the beat.
So it comes in a little bit too early.
So what we're going to do is we're going to track this out and we're going to track this out a find
that been properly.
Hmm.
It feels like it should fit.
It's right on there.
See it right there.
So I'm going to notch one over two right there and then going to put this right up against that.
This should fit now, unless I'm actually at this bit in the wrong place.
So listen back.
Okay.
Now it's it feels a little bit of a bit abrupt, but how can we sort that out?
One of these.
Hold on control.
Hit that and then shift and de to do a crossfade.
Now, if it's not quite right, doing a crossfade where there's a beat will really highlight the problem
because you'll have beats going against each other like a bad deejay.
But if it's right, oh, we're going to be laughing.
That's our lesson back.
And that works.
Let's take it back a little bit further.
Good.
Happy with that?
Cool.
Okay.
So why do we get the music the right time?
First, before we did what we're going to do?
Well, because right now, what we're going to do is we're going to do what's called docking.
See?
Right there.
Docking.
Hmm.
Let me just clear those audio tapes just so I can show you.
Exactly.
Landing.
So, first and foremost, we want Premiere Pro to know that track one in the audio.
Audio one.
All of those clips are dialogue.
I'll tell you why in a minute.
But let's just do that.
So how do we select all of these?
Well, you could do control a like you would in like Microsoft Word or something, but that selects
the video clips and also the music.
What we can do is just drag a marquee and select them all like that.
So nothing is selected other than the voiceover clips.
Now you see, the minute that I select here, let me just select, but keep an eye up here when I go
to select again.
All this is grayed out when I do this.
It gives me the option to tell it what it is.
So I'm not going to say it's dialogue.
Click.
Now, sometimes when you're doing this after the fact or you've got all the clips involved, whenever
you click that always look down here, I'll make sure that all the clips that you selected are still
selected.
Sometimes it will select a clip like this, and you'll have to go and select that individual and say
that that's dialogue as well.
I'm not too sure why that happens.
And again, it may be a book fix that is fixed by the time you start playing with Premiere Pro.
But for now, I'm just telling you, if that ever happens and you'll notice when we do the next step
that it will stand out like a sore thumb that it hasn't actually selected as dialogue.
But now that we said this is dialogue, we're now going to select the music, which is this clip, but
it's not.
It's this clip and this clip.
So hold on shift and select them both.
Or again, as we did above here, Marquee Tool and select them both.
We're now going to say this is music.
The reason why is because when we say it's music and now gives us the option to duck.
Now what is ducking?
What ducking is, is it's a drop in the volume against something.
So you duck against something.
So if we tack on or tick on ducking, we're now saying it comes as default.
Duck against dialogue clips.
See why we actually said that this was dialogue so that this will duck against dialogue.
Now the default is the sense.
Sensitivity is six, the duck amount is -18 and the fades are 800.
I don't agree with that.
It never works for me.
Ducking by -18 takes it far too quiet and it might not as well even be in.
So instead of -18, you see how nothing has happened yet.
There's a reason for that.
We're going to click into here and we're going to type minus eight and just hit enter.
Nothing else has happened.
We just changed it.
We could again.
As always, we can play around with the slider.
I just like to click in minus eight.
I also don't want the faith to be a slope.
This eight 800 microseconds or milliseconds means that the fade takes 800 milliseconds to fade down.
And not only does it take that long to fade down, it takes that long to fade back up again.
And I want the music not only coming down only when it's needed, but I want it back and up as soon
as possible.
So I change this 800 to 300.
Good.
You see how it's move more towards fast now that we've got this end.
So it's six minus eight in 300, we generate the keyframes and once it does, it takes a couple of seconds.
I can take a couple of seconds and then we generate keyframes down here.
Now, remember I told you about this line going through?
Well, this line going through the audio is the volume envelope.
Watch when I hit Generate Keyframes.
Done.
I haven't shortened.
I actually did it in no time at all.
And if we look into here, let's just Tilde, so we can see all this and let's zoom in a little bit.
You can see that it's added what we call keyframes.
We're going to be touching on keyframes a lot in the next section.
But what this has done is it knows that this is dialogue and all this is dialogue.
So this line here, if you imagine all the way down, is silence.
All the way up is far too loud.
This line here is where it was originally, but it's added keyframes.
Right here.
And it set the level here when there's dialogue playing, then when there's no dialogue, it's taking
it back up to zero DB or normal volume.
And then just before this has started, it's brought it back down again and again, doing it here again.
It's it works brilliantly now.
For years it worked absolutely, terribly, but it works great.
So I'm going to tell the back off and now now without key frames and are docking in.
Let's go back to editing.
You could check it in there, but I can see I'm confident that it's absolutely fine.
And let's just play that back.
When we think of outdoor cooking, we think back to nature, log fires, open flames and a good char
on the food being served.
That is why our biggest focus for our products is making sure you get an authentic wood fired taste.
When it comes to pizza, making our number one pizza oven is the go to family choice.
We have carefully designed the events of.
Was a perfect flower.
Okay, let's hold that there.
You've probably noticed a couple of things.
Firstly, that we're clipping again, still we're peaking on the audio and that's because we're at the
normal audio level still at this point.
So what I'm going to do is I'm not going to take it to minus one like we did before.
I'm going to take it to -0.5.
And let's see if that has fixed it.
Let's just click that off and click that's off.
No, don't bring that.
Although to that, we don't want the master all the way up plus 15, double click, and that brings
it down and make sure we're clicking the red and let's bring the play, have back and play from that.
Let's see if we click being served.
That is why.
Okay, that's fixed it.
However, I also noticed right at the beginning, let's just jump back.
When we think of outdoor.
See how we've got a clip here.
But we've got no clip anywhere here.
That's because.
Of those who've been too far back.
It's because of this bit here.
That's the bit in my voice.
But that doesn't look like it's anywhere near clipping.
And it isn't.
Put my voice at that low at that intensity, plus even the duct down audio from the music has made the
master clip.
Okay.
Let me play that again.
Let me show you.
It's right at this point we think of yeah, it's a clip, so that's annoying.
Now that's where I'm going to bring in the plug in.
I talked about before I talked about it with the music, but I decided to do the docking instead because
docking has it come on leaps and bounds in Premiere Pro.
But I want to do this audio, the dialogue with the plug in first and foremost, because it gives a
much better feel than anything in the audio section from Premiere Pro does.
And it's brilliant.
It's called Alex Audio Bottleneck and once installed you can find it.
Don't forget all the links at the at the bottom of the worksheet and you'll find this under Alex audio
bottle.
So just like we did with the multi band compressor, we want another channel.
We've got one, two, three, four, five options for effects in here.
We got loads of effects, but we don't need to in this one, we just need to drop this down.
Go to v three tools uni mute us company that make it and voice so Alex and voice audio bottler as I
said can also also apply it to music, sound effects, tracks and master.
But let's just go for voice right now.
And just like we did with the multi band compressor, we're going to double click this and just set
a couple of parameters.
First and foremost, they're not varying source sources for the for the voice, it's just one constant
source being my voiceover.
And I want general compression.
I don't want Max, I don't want natural, I want general compression.
Okay, that's it.
Two clicks.
Let me just disable it to remind ourselves of what it what it sounds like without it.
When we think of outdoor cooking, we think back to nature log fires, open flames and a good char on
the food being served.
Okay, so that's without Alex Audio Butler.
Let's turn it on and listen back.
When we think of outdoor cooking, we think back to nature, log fires, open flames and a good char
on the food being served.
You hear a difference if you're listening on good quality headphones, you can definitely tell the difference.
Also, this Alex audio bottler is reading constantly as it plays, so if you play it back again, it
will learn more.
When we think of outdoor cooking, we think back to nature.
Now let's just take this another level.
And for background music, I'm going to go for Alex Music audio book, a double click into this and
I'm going to say my target volume is three and my auto docking see are dockings there and I have it
as medium.
So because that's going to be docking, let me go back into audio.
And I'm going to disable the docking of these two.
Let's just disable that for now.
You see how the key frames have come back up.
Let's go back here and let's see how a plugin can do better.
Now obviously we got to a certain level with the built in from Premiere Pro and it worked.
Okay.
But have a listen to a third party plug in and how much better it sounds.
When we think of outdoor cooking, we think back to nature, log fires, open flames and a good char
on the food being served.
That is why our biggest anti-hero brought it down really, really quickly.
That's, again, because it's learning.
Play it back again.
Good char on the food being served.
And it didn't come up at all then.
Right.
Because it's learning constantly.
You have to play this through about three or four times to get to where you want it to be.
But before we do that, I'm actually going to add it also to.
The Master.
Okay.
Just like with the other two.
This is the master.
And I want a compression boost.
And this is for online.
Okay, so the compression will boost all of the audio.
And this is for online delivery.
Obviously, if you're going for broadcast, you could go here or aka infused archive.
But if is broadcast by television, television producers require audio at a certain level.
But this is just for online, so I'm happy with that x out of that.
I'm going to render this a few times and then play it back to you to give it the best chance to do its
work.
As you can see, we've got old grain all the way along here.
I actually exported the audio a couple of times that's what Alex audio that that tells you to do and
have a little look.
I'm surprised it doesn't actually give me a boost here at all.
But it works.
It works really well.
And as you can see, there's no keyframes.
There's no lines have been changed all the way through here because it's actually working within itself
within the plugin.
Have a listen to this.
Especially here where it goes.
No dialogue.
And here as well.
And also here when the music goes a little bit quieter.
I Alex audio bottler is reading the quality of the music and the sound and the the overall timbre of
the music.
So it knows that it can keep it up a certain level because it's not as full as over here.
Similar to here, when we get to the end, it brings it up way before the end because it knows that
it's a much less depth of audio so it can bring it up earlier.
It sounds just so much more professional.
Have a listen.
In fact, you know what?
Before we go any further, I'm going to pull LFA down here.
How do I do that?
Just control.
Track Shifty.
You know what I'm doing?
Isn't it great to feel that you know what I'm doing just watching this now?
Okay.
Hello?
Listen, when we think of outdoor cooking, we think back to nature.
Log fires, open flames, and a good char on the food being served.
That is why our biggest focus for our products is making sure you get that authentic wood fired taste.
When it comes to pizza, making our number one pizza oven is the go to family choice.
We have carefully designed the ovens so that there is a perfect flow of heat throughout and you can
be cooking in as little as 15 minutes.
The steel pizza base is different from the traditional stone used in most ovens, as we believe from
rigorous testing that this gives you the perfect crisp face to your pizza.
So we're going to do something else here, but I'm going to wait until later on in the course to do
that.
But I just want to point out a couple of things.
Yeah.
As I said, it brought up the music way before I finished talking because it could it also did the same
here.
And let me point out that there is absolutely no clipping whatsoever all the way along, because the
audio bottler is working not only on the voice and on the music, but also on the master.
It works beautifully.
If you imagine if you've got a stupidly long sequence with loads of different types of audio, you've
got two different, different people talking at different times on different tracks.
You've got pieces of music, pieces of sound effects and all that kind of stuff.
Being able to just automate it like this and export it a couple of times, each stuff to export the
the audio, not necessarily the music and not necessarily the video.
And it just it just changes everything.
So that's where we're at.
That's working with audio.
I know we've done a lot.
We've covered a lot in this section with regards to audio.
But I think I think you coming out of this section knowing a hell of a lot more than what you did going
in.
Next up, we're going to add motion.
We're going to build more within this sequence and see what else we can do just to spice, just to add
that little flair.
And that's what this is all about, adding it's first getting a rough cut, which is what we did, and
then we've built on it with the voiceover and the music, and now we're going to go a little bit further
and add motion and then we're going to add color correction.
And I just it's just going to be brilliant.
Get ready.
It's going to give even more fun.

## 12 Adding Motion with Keyframing
### 1. Animating an Image

Okay.
So this is the first section where you could say that we're now building on our knowledge.
And although there are a few more introductory sections in the course coming up after, I think this
is the best point to introduce this part and that is key framing.
And in essence, key framing is setting a value at a certain point and telling premiere pro that over
a certain time you want to change that value to something else.
Let me show you what that looks like in visual.
But to first do that, we're going to do it with an image.
You can do it with video, you can do it with image.
You can do with all you can do with pretty much anything.
But to show you, I'm going to show you with an image just to show you the basics.
And the way in which I'm going to do that is, rather than drag in an image, I'm going to create an
image because of course, we could drag in an image like we've dragged in video into here, but we're
going to create an image within here and then we're just going to keyframe it, not for our final output
from this video, but just to show you what we can do.
So let's get a frame that I like to look.
How can we to give us some room?
You'll know what I mean by room when we get there.
So that's the image that I want.
And effectively what we need to do is we need to export that frame as an image.
Now I do have the button here.
I remember when we changed all these buttons by pressing that plus and then dragging down what we wanted.
If you remember right at the beginning, I also have the keyboard shortcut, an edit keyboard shortcuts
that check this over and my export frame is set to see if you want to do that.
It's not already in there.
Just a quick reminder, type in here X Ports, we scroll down to export frame and then we click in here
and you type see the default is controls shift e which for me is to to modify is being control and shift
to many see does me absolutely fine so this is the frame that we want.
So I'm going to either hit see on my keyboard or click this button and we now brought up with this dialog
box.
Now if this is the first time this dialog box has come up, it probably doesn't have import to project
checked and it's probably set to be MP or bitmap.
I would advise not to use bitmap for the highest quality or quality to size ratio.
I'd probably suggest pngs or you can also select JPEG and leave it with PNG g at the moment.
And I'm also going to tick import into project because if we left that unchecked and we saved this image
out, it would save in the path that we've set.
However, it wouldn't be here.
We don't have to do another step and go and find that and then track it in Premiere Pro can cut out
the middleman and cut out that step and import into projects.
I'm going to leave that checked however I your path is not going to be there so I'm just going to show
you if at this point before you export press browse and here is where I'm saving my images my exported
images from premiere pro.
If you remember, we set up the folders here and here in images is where I'm going to select the path
to save the images because as well as being here, it needs to be saved or anything that's in here needs
to be saved somewhere on your machine that can be accessible.
Flash drive, external hard drive, internal hard drive now system, whichever.
It just has to be readable and rightful from premiere pro and it can place it here so it can access
it.
A quick recap there for you.
So I'm going to select that folder and now going to name it and clicking in this name and control A
to select all the text and I'm going to title that pizza in of it.
You can name whatever you like really but pizza oven and I'm going to press okay and remember this is
a PNG not that you'll be able to really tell the difference in here and it's set to import into project.
So when I press okay it's going to place it up here in the project bin.
Now it doesn't matter where you are, both you in nests or sequences or whatever.
Anything that it creates, such as images in Premiere Pro will come right to the source, right to the
root, as it were, of say this is in a big folder where all your subfolders are in, so you could leave
that there.
But if you're doing a lot of this and you're generating a number of different things, you're going
to kind of want to keep it tidy.
So don't forget, you can go anywhere in this empty space, a right click and new bin.
Or if you've got no space left, you can click this little folder here which will create a new bin.
I'm going to label this.
As you can see, it creates a bin and has the text ready to be edited.
So I'm going to select, I'm going to type images and if you hit return, so the enter button right
below delete on your keyboard, it will save it will commit that title, but it will go to the next
item within there to edit that text and it does it all the way along.
And I think that's I think this is a way to be able to rename things quickly, but we don't really want
to do that.
The way in which I commit a title that I that I type in here is to the enter right on the edge of my
keyboard because I have an extended keyboard with the number pad.
And we talked about that before and I hit enter there and it commits it.
If you don't have that, once you've typed the name, you can just click anywhere and it will just commit
that.
I know that's a long explanation for that, but I've seen a number of people get lost within the naming
section of here and you start renaming things the wrong thing just trying to get out of it.
I've actually changed my mind that I'm going to export a different image, so I've just deleted it from
that.
And let's just I want to do that because I want to I want to focus in a different place.
So anyway, we do just as we did before I do a pizza and of an ongoing important project I'm press okay
now that's going to ask me if I want to overwrite because I've deleted it from here, but it's not deleted
from where it's saved, which is temp premiere pro images.
So I'm going to overwrite that.
It's going to bring in right there.
I'm going to drag that into images and double click in here.
And here is my image right there.
So as you can see, although I can screw up here because that's a video.
If I screw up here, it's nothing because it's just an image.
It's just showing me when I click into source that it's there.
So what I'm going to do is I'm just going to zoom all the way out here.
Don't forget alt or option.
If you got a mac and scrolling scroll wheel or if you don't have a scroll wheel and you can't use the
touchpad, you can zoom in and out by using these handles at the bottom and go over here and I'm going
to drag this image onto here.
Now, as you can see, it drags in just like a video clip.
Absolutely fine.
However, whereas a video clip will have a set amount that you can extend it because there's a limited
amount of footage in that, because this is a still image, you can make this as long or as short as
you like.
So I'm just going to create some space there.
And if I hit space on my keyboard to play, you can see it's playing it, but.
It's just playing a still image because that's all it is.
So if I get to 120.
And that's a really easy way to find.
To get to a specific point on your timeline, don't forget, we go frames, seconds, minutes, hours.
It's going to be up to here.
The reason why I'm doing that is because I want to set the duration of 5 seconds.
So at 120, I'm going to click in here and delete and press five and that's 5 seconds.
So if I trim that out there, we now have a 5/2 clip, which is just one image.
Now, what we're going to do here is we're going to add motion through key framing.
And the way in which we do that is we select the clip that we want to use and we go back to our favorite
place effects controls.
Now to initialize key framing, what we need to do is we need to start the stopwatch.
Remember I said key framing was affecting a value anything.
And I'm using vague, vague descriptors because it really can be pretty much anything.
But we need to set a value at a certain point and a value of that same thing at a different point for
a different value.
And that's how we're going to keyframe.
So let me show you quite simply.
So what we're looking for is a stopwatch, which is here.
If you remember the kind of stopwatch that a trainer would use to to time a sprinter, that's what this
is.
These are stopwatches.
And as you can see, as you go down, there are a number of things we can actually keyframe.
Not just positional scale.
You can do the rotation, the anchor points, the anti flicker filter.
Never use that in my life.
And the opacity at the speed for some reason, in time and time remapping is always toggled on.
That's how you can tell it's toggled on because of the blue.
But yeah, I really wouldn't worry about that.
But it's always toggled on.
Yeah.
So I'm going to go right to the very beginning of this clip, which is effectively a 5/2 still image.
And I'm going to toggle on the key framing for scale.
Nothing's happened.
Well, actually has.
But you can't tell right here because we're right at the edge.
You can only see half of it.
But if I drag it out, you can see a diamond and a blue diamond.
That means it's a keyframe.
If I click out, it's not highlighted.
The only reason it was Blue's because it was selected.
But this is a keyframe.
And it's a simple, linear keyframe.
Remember that?
We'll be dealing with that shortly.
But this is a linear keyframe.
I'm going to put that back where it was.
You can just literally track these around just by clicking and dragging.
And then I'm going to go to the end of this clip.
So remember, the shortcut, if we're in the timeline is just to press.
If you press right, it goes forward one frame.
If you hold down shift and go right, it goes forward five frames.
So obviously we went from 1 to 6 if we pressed down.
Bearing in mind that V one is selected here, if we press down, we go to the end of that clip.
Similarly, if we press up, we go to the beginning of that clip.
So we're pressing down.
I'm just going to zoom in here a bit and come back one frame and I'm going to set a keyframe here.
So to add another keyframe, you don't click the stopwatch again, because what the stopwatch does when
you click it the first time, it does two things.
It says, one, I want to animate and I want to keyframe this value, the scale value, and it creates
a keyframe like we did.
If we click that again, it will come up with a warning.
It will say this action will delete existing keyframes.
Do you want to continue?
That's because the stopwatch, so that the stopwatch literally turns on and turns off key framing.
Now, that used to really annoy me, the fact that when you want to turn it off, it comes up with a
warning.
But actually, as I'm doing this course, I'm realizing that when I first learned this six, seven,
maybe eight years ago, it really helped.
Because if you just if you're able to do that without a warning, you may then get further down the
road and realize, oh, I actually turned off my key framing.
I didn't change it.
So I've lost that.
And you'll have done loads of work since then and you'll have to redo the work because you can't just
undo because all the other work that you've done since is lost.
So what we want to do to create a new keyframe is not to toggle off key framing, but to click here,
which is add or remove keyframe.
What we can also do is change the value.
If we change the value, it will create a new keyframe.
But in this we will do that later.
But in this instance, I don't I just want to add another keyframe.
Now we're actually one frame before the end of come in just so you can actually have something on screen.
But if we tilde this, you can see that there's actually room for it to go.
So I'm going to move it all the way to the end till the back out.
And now what I'm going to do is I'm going to effect the first keyframe because I want to start in and
zoom out.
So to navigate between the keyframes, to snap to the different keyframes, you just use these little
arrow buttons.
So I'm going to click left to go to the first keyframe.
As you can see, the play head has now moved to the beginning of There is just too much.
We've got all that in view.
So what I want to do is I want to zoom in.
Now, bearing in mind that when your scale is at a hundred, that's 100%.
So if we want to zoom in, we don't go for a lower number, we go for a higher number.
So I want to scale in by about 20% so I could drag this number up, I could twirl this down and pull
it, pull the slider up.
But what I'm actually going to do is I'm just going to click in there, type 120 and hit Enter.
Boom.
We're in.
We are punched in to this image.
Now what happens?
Well, if we press play, what we're going to do is we're going to change.
We're going to move between these two keyframes.
And this first keyframe is set to scale.
120.
And if I skip.
To the next keyframe, which is right on the end.
That's not annoying at all, is it?
We're at 100 100, obviously.
We've gone to Black Coffee at the end of the clip.
So let's go back to the beginning and play this through.
And as you can see, over the course of 5 seconds, we've moved from 120.
To 100%.
Is that clear?
Great.
So what we've done is we've added motion to this image 120% all the way out to 100%.
Now, what I want to do next is I want to create maybe a little bit of, I don't know, natural movement
because this is what we call a linear keyframe.
As you can see, everything is straight line.
So this is the difference between 120 and 100 is actually slightly diagonal as a diagonal going down.
And this velocity, this is what we're looking at, the velocity is start and stop.
So that's the speed of the actual keyframe.
So what I want to do is I want to make that a little bit more natural, I think is the word.
So what I'm going to do is I'm actually going to come in by a few frames, let's say by 15 frames,
shift and press right three times, as you can see.
Right, 15 frames past 20 seconds.
And I'm going to get this keyframe.
I'm going to drag it to there.
So now from the beginning, we've got no movement, and then it starts and then again it then stops.
Something to do similar with the last keyframe.
I'm going to bring that.
Let's bring this up to 24/7.
We got a second of no movement at the end, and I'm going to drag this keyframe.
So now we've got.
Absolute stillness.
Start moving.
And stop moving that.
That's quite abrupt.
It really is quite an abrupt movement.
If I can make this show even more, I'm going to zoom in more.
So then the zooming out has to be quicker to get to a hundred at the same point.
So if I press play now, you can see how it starts and then stops.
Now, as I said, that's quite abrupt.
So we're going to we're going to add some easing.
And what that does is it eases the start and the stop of the keyframes.
As I said, this is a just a straight line going from where are we now?
One six 1 to 100.
And we're just at a velocity here, just straight from minus at -9.0.
This velocity stays the exact same value all the way through 70 -17.9 and then stops.
So we want to change that.
We want to change this.
We want to make it a curve on the way in which we do this is we change the interpolation.
And easy way to do that is on this diamond.
On the first one, what's a right click it and it gives us the option.
So linear is select two by default we've got BCA, auto, Basia, continuous basia hold ease in and
ease out.
Now these work BCA or two BCA continue BCA, but I prefer to do it manually.
So that's the way I'm going to teach you see not relying on anything else.
And the way to remember which ease you use in after effects.
You also have easy ease which eases both ends.
What we're going to do is the way in which to remember is we're starting, so we're easing out of a
stationary position.
So let's just to recap, we've selected this key frame.
We've right clicked it and we've gone to ease out.
And if I told you that you can see now that we've got rather than let me undo, rather than just a straight
line for the speed I'm going to redo, which is the opposite of undo which rather than control and Z
is controls shift z.
And we've now got a curve here which will ease out of the states new position, but press play and show
you what that looks like.
You see how it didn't just start?
It kind of started from the stationary and slowly sped up.
To the point where I wanted to go, but then it stops abruptly.
What we want to do is we want to do the same to the second keyframe, but in reverse, rather than easing
out.
We want to.
That's right.
E's in.
So we're going to right click this second, this final keyframe, and we're going to ease in.
See now how we've got a curve.
If I undo an undo.
We had a flat line.
If I redo and then redo.
We've now got a curve, and I'll show you what that looks like here.
Right towards the end.
It doesn't just stop.
It slows down before it stops.
So that's key framing.
That's the basics of key framing.
What I want to do is this is the final position and that's great.
I'm happy with that.
But let's go to that first key frame.
We're kind of starting from nowhere.
So let's also keyframe the position.
So just like we did before, we're going to hit position and then I'm going to move.
I'm doing this purposely, so I have to show you what to do.
If you haven't created the last keyframe first, I'll show you what I mean.
So with these values, this is the the Y value and the X values.
So the x, the X value is side by side control Z and the Y value is up and down.
So what I'm going to do is I'm going to drag this down and let's see, because we've zoomed in, because
we're in at 161%, we've got quite a bit of room to work with.
We can move within here.
So I want to start maybe here.
I'm going to set this like we did before to ease out, which is in the temporal interpolation.
So ease out.
And then I'm going to click to the last one and all of a sudden we've got black bars because we haven't
set a position, a second position, and we've changed the keyframe here to be up.
So now we need to bring it down.
How do we do that?
Well, if you want to be all the way out and the original position where we were at, it's easy.
Obviously, you can drag down and place it there and okay, we're back to 540, but you can also reset
parameter.
So that would even if this was all the way over that you could reset parameter, boom, we're back to
where we should be and we have another linear keyframe.
So I'm going to right click that temporal interpolation and ease in.
And now we go back to the beginning.
Press play.
And both keyframes.
Are easing out and easing in at the same time.
If I made that a linear and that keyframe a linear.
What would that look like?
Well, let's see.
What you're going to see is you're going to see that the movement starts and stops quite abruptly,
but the scale will ease.
You're probably going to see a bit of black bars.
Yep.
See the black father.
And that actually really shows the easing of the of the scale.
Watch this towards the end here.
And then we sit in.
That's because as we slow down the scale movement, the velocity of the position is staying the same.
So that's why we want to ease in at the end and ease out at the beginning like we did the first ones.
Then we've got no black bars.
I mean, nice and smoothly.
Keyframe that movement from zoomed in to zoom down.
That's your basics of key framing.


### 2. Animating a Video

So now we're going to build on that knowledge of key framing.
We've done an image.
We're now going to move on to video, so I'm just going to delete that.
I know you put you put so much work in something, he'd just get rid of it.
It's fine.
It's absolutely fine.
So let's get to where is this?
This is the clip that I'd said earlier that we're going to animate.
And just to remind you, this is the sequence for running up to it.
Yeah.
Log fires, open flames, and a good char on the food being served.
That is why our biggest focus for so on this bit.
The music comes back in with then looking up into the oven and we have that lovely warm boom of the
music.
That is why our big swell.
What I want to do is I want to punch in a little bit at the beginning.
So we're kind of slowly growing out.
And first and foremost, I don't really want to be all the way out here.
I want to finish a little bit further inside.
So before we start any key framing, I'm just going to get it framed up exactly how I want it.
I'm thinking maybe zooming a little bit there and maybe that's that's been on our safe margins.
That's our center if maybe no, no, let's have it set it as a center middle.
So we're kind of working off that was slightly off center, but that's I'm happy with that.
So what I'm going to do with this is I'm going to set the key frame for both the position and the scale,
because I know that we're affecting both the position in the scale or I'm I'm almost certain we're definitely
going to be affecting the scale.
But just in case we need to change the position at the beginning, we're going to we're going to set
a keyframe for both of those.
So, again, with the stopwatch, we'll set that keyframe and we'll set that keyframe.
Now, as you can see, we're not right at the end, but I want this running right to the end.
So as we've done before, to a marquee over them, push them all the way to the end.
That's only a little bit.
And now back in the timeline.
We're going to press up once to get to the beginning of the clip.
But that doesn't get us to the beginning of the clip.
Why is that?
That's because it's reading the edge of the clip from the audio as well.
That's no problem.
I'm quite happy with leaving that happening.
So we just press up again and we go to the end of the next clip and acted on an active track, which
is V one, which is where we want it to be.
So I'm now going to set the keyframe for both the position and the scale.
I think, as I said, definitely going to be setting a keyframe for the scale.
Let me actually leave those on and okay, let's show we click that.
But we can.
But the minute we change a property on a part that has key framing toggled on, it will automatically
create keyframe.
So we'll let the system do it for us.
So let's zoom in a little bit.
Maybe to about that.
And as you can see, not only has it scaled up, as we were saying, but it's actually created that
key.
Right now, I don't know about you, but I think that the flames are a little bit high up in the image
here.
So I'm going to bring that.
Down a little.
Just to.
Yeah.
I may be a little bit over to the left.
Yeah.
Happy with that?
Now, I've started the first keyframe right at the beginning of the clip, and the last keyframe is
right at the end of the clip.
So you'll see as we play it back, I don't need to add any ease, ease out or ease in, because I don't
need to show when that movement starts and when that ends because because we're having the movement
going all the way from the beginning to the end of the clip, it will actually look like we've done
it in-camera with the camera, not in the edit or post post-processing, which is what all editing is.
It's you do it in post.
It's actually a well-known term in the industry, especially with with videographers, where you're
like, Oh, so I do this that I try, I'll do it in post.
I was think I hadn't thought about at the time, but I could have easily have thought, okay, well,
I'll hold the camera still.
Just get a load of this and I'll do a slow zoom out and post is probably safer with this current subject
because it's fire.
I don't really want to be pushing my lens and the plastic parts of that lens inside a pizza oven that
is aiming to get over 400 degrees Fahrenheit.
It's probably not going to be good for it.
I was actually on an 18 millimetres lens, so I was actually pretty much all the way outside.
So punching in and creating this is almost well, we're achieving something that probably couldn't be
done in real life.
And that's the beauty of being able to edit after the fact.
So now that we have the punch in here and we're coming to the new and then the new position that let
me go back one here, which again, don't forget, is actually more zoomed in than the original is.
We're still at 133%.
Let's play this back and let's see what we've animate it being served.
That is why our biggest focus for our good.
Now the thing is I think that zoom out is a little bit fast.
That is why our biggest and we could slow that down.
But the problem with slowing that down would mean that we're in this clip longer and that would affect
everything else.
So what we want to do is we want to change the values of the scale because the speed of the zoom out
is dictated by the different values.
It's the 191.
And we just bring this.
Up a little bit.
The 1912, the 133.
So we either need to start.
In less or come out less.
I'm going to opt for coming out less, but I'm going to just bring these two up here so I can work on
them easier and I'm going to punch in a little bit more.
Let's just remind 191 and we've come out by 60%.
So maybe let's go in and let's maybe half that bring that down was by safe margins.
Not everything has to be obviously scented, but I want this to be centered so at least at least close
to center.
So let's see how that does.
So I've changed the value of the scale, which will then affect where I am in position.
So let's just grab those, put them back to the end and let's see the speed of that zoom being served.
That is why our biggest focus for that's better is that you can tell that that is better.
It's just it's a much slower, it's more elegant, it's more dare I say, it looks more expense on the
food being served.
That is why our biggest focus and because this is shots in 100 frames a second.
So we set it to 25 frames a second.
So it's it's 25 times 25% of the speed that with the slow zoom that just that that gives everything
doesn't it.
That is why our biggest focus for love that really I just I just love that that's brilliant.
Now with that in mind.
Let me just very quickly explain when we were.
Remember, we were looking at these these transitions before.
And I am going to do a full section.
If you look down on your worksheet, I am going to do a full section on premiere composer and the transitions.
But let's say just take the zoom, for instance, at two to do something like that.
Even the movement, the zoom in.
To do something like that.
Zoom in.
Can I.
It's.
It's just it for now.
This zoom in here to do that.
Actually, that's really annoying my eyes to do that.
Takes a lot in here, and it's not as simple as zooming in and then going to the next frame.
It's so much more.
And we're talking reflections of different channels and doubling up channels and all that.
So whereas this does utilize the whole effects controls, it will do it on something called an adjustment
layer.
And that's what we're going to look at in the next section.
With animating a crop, you can crop anything but an adjustment layer is what we're going to look at
in the next section to highlight something that you've probably seen in so many different videos.
And it's a lovely effect app, but I just want to make this point just at this point, because we're
talking about zooms and we're talking about movement and all this.
You've seen how much it's taken.
It doesn't take much.
Once you get past it, it's quite easy and it can be done in a matter of seconds.
But the knowledge that you need to be able to do that.
Then being able to do something like this, it really speaks to time over money.
And that's something that we are actually going to be dealing with, mainly with the plug ins, because
the plug ins, although a lot of plug ins, do great things and can and can bring so much levelling
up to your addicts.
Most plug ins can be achieved manually.
Most, I'd say, a good a good proportion of them.
However, the time in which it takes to achieve that same thing would cost you probably more in your
own time rather than buying a plug in.
Don't let that put you off.
Most of what you'll see in Premiere Pro's, premiere composer that I show you later on is free and you
can use it with whatever you want it.
Anyway, we're getting a little bit ahead of ourselves.
Let me just show you the starter pack.
It's just.
Yep, yep.
Let's not get ahead of ourselves.
So that is animating image and video up to now.
We're now going to go over animating a crop.
So this is animating a crop.
And I'm just going to I'm going to very quickly show you in with our image and then I'll show you how
you may use it in here.
Remember that we cropped before we we had a couple of images, a couple of tracks and video tracks on
the same line, and we crop them in.
We can animate that as well.
But we're building on that knowledge.
And let's just get this image.
Remember the pizza?
Of it, which is going to animate a crop here very, very quickly, because then I want to show you
what else you can do with it.
So if you remember how to get a crop, well, highlight this and we're going to go to effects and we're
going to type in crop and drag this transform crop either onto the clip or within the effects controls.
What I like to do is I always like to drag it onto the clip because say we're over this clip, but this
clip is selected.
We could drag this crop into the effects controls and start affecting it.
But nothing's happening because we're actually affecting this clip.
Undo.
Undo.
I think that highlights exactly that point.
We really need to drop in a crop onto the actual clip that we're working on, and that goes for anything
that you get in here.
I highly recommend that you drag it onto the clip that you want to effect.
Okay, good.
So now that we have the crop.
In here.
It now comes up within the effects control's going down.
So we've got again, we still got motion and all the way through here for position sky rotational.
Then we've got opacity.
We haven't touched on that yet, but we will time remapping again we're not going to use that and crop.
So now I've clicked crop we've now got the black the blue bar all the way around and we can easily just
start okay, let's not get ahead of ourselves.
Remember with motion, if we touch motion, we can move dots around.
Good.
Same with crop.
We can grab a side.
I'm bring it down, hold down shift and it keeps that aspect ratio.
Let go of shift and you're freeform with that corner, but you can use any of the other handles all
the way around or you can use these, which that's left.
That's right.
And they're, they're soon shown as percentages.
And you can also see we have stopwatches.
Yes, we do.
So let's say we want to animate a crop from the side for no other reason just to do it.
I'm not I'm not saying that this is going to look good, but this is just showing you the technique.
So let's say we want to crop the left from 0 to 25%.
So let's we're going to go from that amount of time in the clip and we're going to turn on the stopwatch.
So we're stop watching.
So we've started a keyframe and we're going to go forward a second.
So we know that we're on 25 frames a second.
So remember, shift and right goes forward five frames.
So if we do that five times, one, two, three, four, five, that's a second.
And now, as you can see, the play has moved along in the effects controls.
But there's no keyframe being changed because we haven't either clicked on to add a keyframe and we
haven't changed the value of what we're keyframe.
I'm going to crop in by 25%, so I'm going to click in there, take 25 and press enter.
Cool.
We've now crop ten by 25% because we're 19, 20 by 1080 or more.
More realistically, we're 16 by nine.
If I crop in 25% on the left and 25% on the right, we effectively make a square.
So we're going to do that at the same time.
Let me just take that back and show you.
Good.
But it's a horrible linear keyframe.
But we won't affect these this easy yet because we're going to do more to it and we'll do it all at
the same time rather than doing them all individually.
So let's go back to the first keyframe, and we're going to do the same with the right.
So toggle on the key framing and go to the next keyframe, which is when 25% is in from the left and
we're going to do the same 25% and hit enter, we're now boom done.
This may look like a square, does it?
Maybe my math is off anyway.
So we've now got left and the right coming in at the same time.
If I go back and play that.
Boom.
Nice.
Now, that may have given you giving away a little bit as to what we're going to be doing in the main
thing.
But let's just let's hold the horses.
So I'm going to ease these.
So I'm going to remember.
Track a marquee round highlight the first two key frames right click and ease.
Out and then do it with the other two.
Right click.
And he's in.
Let's take that back.
You see how we started slow and then ended slow, but we ramped up in the middle of a war.
It's just a much smoother, nicer way to animate by easing it.
I just.
I just love it.
We're then going to do the same with the top and the bottom, but we're going to actually offset these.
So if we zoom in a little bit.
And I want to start.
Maybe.
At that point.
So a half way through or thereabouts, halfway through the animation, I'm going to do the top in the
same time.
So that's done.
That's done.
Let's skip again and let's go forward another maybe 15 frames.
So anywhere over here or down here, hold down, shift and go.
Five, ten, 15.
In fact, let's make it 20 frames.
I'm going to bring in the top by 12% and I'm going to bring the bottom by 12%.
Now, this is where you need to be really kind of trying to highlight what you want and not highlighting
what you don't want.
Easy here.
Highlight in these two and we want to ease in with the out.
But to get in here.
Yeah, that's where your tilde comes in.
Really handy mouse over in this area.
Tilde That's easy, isn't it?
Honestly, when I learned how to tell that, it just made my life complete.
So it's easy out with those.
So let's tell that out and let's see what that looks like.
Good, huh?
Looks good.
In fact, I think they take a little bit too long, so I'm going to tilt in here.
Yeah, you can see the space between.
That is a lot different to the space between that.
So let's actually.
Let's bring it up a little bit shorter than that space.
Tilda out.
See how easy it is to move around the key.
And once you know what you're looking at, it's brilliant.
Let's try that again.
That's good, doesn't it?
Good.
So now that we've, we've learnt how to animate a crop.
Let me show you what I actually want to animate in here, which I'll just oh it's just going to level
up everything.


### 3. Animating a Crop

I'm going to introduce you to something brand new, but not fully explain it over then with this crop.
I know it's really annoying, but I want to introduce this element.
Now, before we go any further.
So then we can build on our knowledge as we go forward.
It will all become obvious, I promise.
So what we're going to do is we're going to work with a an adjustment layer.
So follow along and or just follow them doing.
And yeah, I'll show you.
So we create an adjustment layer.
I'm going to explain it.
Let's just right click.
And as you would create a new bean, we're going to go to a new part where we haven't been to before,
which is a new item, just like you could create and you've been done here if you didn't have any empty
space here to right click.
You can also click this here which says new item and you've got the list here by up here because you
can see easier.
So we're going to create a new just been there.
Remember how we create a new sequence are we have been in here before.
We're going to create a new adjustment layer.
Okay.
So done.
Now, just like with the color mapped, it will ask you what you want the settings to be.
It automatically populates it with our sequence settings, which obviously with this is 1920 by 1080
and 25 frames, a second pixel aspect ratio square pixels 1.0.
Don't ask me what that means.
Never touched it before.
You set up your sequence and your project and it just automatically does it.
So don't worry about that.
Press okay.
And just like when we created an image, the adjustment layer comes up in here.
I don't have any way to put this right now, so I'm just going to leave it there.
So what is an adjustment layer?
Well, let's drag it on and we'll see.
So just like with an image, when we dragged in the image and it came at that size, an adjustment layer,
let's undo that.
An adjustment layer is kind of like in an image.
I'll drag it and show you.
As you can see, it's the same size.
But if we zoom over and let's click over a part where the adjustment layer is.
What's the difference?
Let me delete that.
Did you notice anything different?
Controls that to bring it back.
Did you notice anything different?
No.
Good.
Because nothing's changed.
Nothing has changed at all.
What this adjustment layer does is it affects everything below it.
Okay.
So.
But in a certain way.
So if I move my position or my scale, it does nothing.
But that's not what it's for.
In this instance, we're going to crop.
But I'm going to give you a very, very quick view of let's just go into color.
And this is what a lot of people use for color grading.
So I know you haven't seen this area before, but let's say we want to affect the color and we go exposure.
Oh, that's ten of the exposure of what's below it.
But.
Not when it's not over it.
Because what you're doing is you're affecting this rather than that.
Why would that be helpful?
Let me just undo that and come out to that.
That would be helpful because if you've got the same change.
That you want to apply to all of these.
Then you could just put it on an adjustment layer and just like you did an image.
Track it out.
You follow in me, and then that change would be effected on everything.
So what do we want to do right now with the crop?
Well, I'm going to show you.
I'm going to do it on this clip and then I'm going to show you why we do it on an adjustment layer.
So effects crop and we're going to drop a crop on this first clip.
And what I'm going to do, just like we animated in the left and the right in the top on the bottom,
I'm going to do a slow animate in to crop in the top in the bottom.
And if I do that by 10%, the top by 10% and the bottom by 10%, you'll see that that makes absolutely
no difference on the bottom.
Why is that?
That's because the position.
Is not where we had it.
If I reset that and reset the scale, everything is different.
And that's because we had our anchor point different.
Remember what we did before on previous clips where it just wasn't quite right, and we moved it around
and we moved around the anchor point that still had that information in there.
The reason why not doing the crop on here will be, say, we wanted that to be where it was at and we
wanted it to stay where it was that we wouldn't want to do it on this clip.
But let's just re reset everything.
So we're there and we now have our crop on the top of the bottom.
Do you understand what I mean?
If that was there where we wanted it, you couldn't apply that effect to this clip because the crop
wouldn't come in at the right place.
I hope that makes sense.
So we're not in the top and the bottom and looks good.
That looks great.
But then the crops knocked back.
Let me take this a little bit further.
I want to animate this in and out.
Okay.
So I want to end by here.
So we're going to stop, watch the top and stop.
Watch the bottom.
We're going to go back a little bit and then I'm going to reset the top and the bottom.
You know what we're doing now.
We're right clicking the two and we're easing out.
I'm going to bring that right to the beginning.
How are we going to ease in?
For the end of that animation.
So let's see how that looks.
You've seen this before.
It's almost like this is going to be cinematic, but it's not on that clip.
So if we wanted that all the way along, we'd have to.
Now add the crop to all of these, but without the animation and that would be a real pain.
So I could copy and paste these attributes to the adjustment layer, but I'm not going to I'm just going
to undo all of these.
I'm going to show you how good an adjustment layer is when you use it like this.
Not many people know you can do this one adjustment layer, by the way.
A lot of people just know about the color grading and the color changing across multiple clips.
Not many people know about this.
So I'm going to where's that crop?
Is that crop?
Well, that crop is stellar.
I'm going to.
This line through here that turns off the effect.
It doesn't delete it, it just turns off the effect.
But I'm actually going to delete the crop.
To do that, I just literally click crop and press delete and that crop is out.
But that obviously is on this clip.
So now I'm going to do the same, but I'm going to do it on the adjustment layer.
Okay, so I'm going to grab that crop.
I don't forget I'm not putting in here.
I'm dragging it onto the adjustment layer just to make sure the crop goes where I want it to.
And we shall say, maybe back here, I want the top and the bottom.
To be at 10%, but I'm at the beginning, so let's just track them off.
And now.
Of the 10% there and 10% there.
Now, there's not much space here.
So let's Tilda to zoom in and I want to ease out the beginning and ease in.
The end.
I'm not too sure if that's going to be a little bit too quick.
It's only over a second.
Let's take it back and let's see.
I'd like it a little bit longer.
So how do we do that?
Well, as you can see, because we use the adjustment layer and the adjustment layer.
I've dragged that over the whole clip here.
It's really hard to see.
So this again, is where Tilde comes in.
But let's play it to where I want it to stop.
About there.
So now I've got my play ahead where I want it to stop.
I go up to effects controls till the end again.
I'm just going to track these two key frames and snap them to the play head.
Don't forget, if things aren't snapping, make sure snapping has turned on so important.
However, things are snapping.
You don't want them to just talk a lot off when you need to, but I would leave it on indefinitely.
So now we have that crop coming in on that clip, but then we go into the next clip.
But remember, the crop is animated on the adjustment layer, so that crop will now stay all the way
through.
The whole entire sequence.
Now.
Why would you want these crop bars?
Well, a lot of people like them because it makes it more cinematic.
But also the beauty of having these crop bars is you've also given yourself 20% more room to move 10%
to the top 20% at the bottom.
Remember, if we didn't have this, if I just highlight this and press zero, because we've got that
as a shortcut to enable and disable of disable that for now.
But remember, if I wanted this more up this clip, but 100% if I stopped moving it.
See, I've got the black bars cause I'm.
I'm running out of space.
I've got no room to move.
However, if I re-enable the adjustment layer with the highlighting or selecting it and present zero,
if I now move in here.
All those black bars hide a multitude of sins.
You see where I can.
Where I can come up to.
So that can really help to reframe a shot which isn't quite there.
And you don't you don't want to zoom in to maybe lose quality or anything.
So we can play through this and think, Oh yeah, okay, that's okay.
I'm happy with that framing.
I was quite happy with all of this framing, really.
But that framing, I'd like to maybe bring it up a little bit.
There you go.
So let's place that there.
Obviously, the black bars will kind of get in the way a bit, but it gives you so much freedom.
Again, with here, we don't need as much from the top left in the bottom.
Let's bring that all the way up.
I bring that up a little bit as well.
That's okay.
Maybe bring that down a little bit, actually see what I'm doing.
I'm just going through highlights in the clips that I want to effect.
That's good.
Maybe bring that up a little bit as well.
So I'm getting more of the peeled off.
I get this is a pizza peel.
You're very welcome.
Always adding value.
And.
Yeah.
Looks good.
Looks good.
Got to bring that up a little bit.
And I'm kind of going through this now where actually the the part of the lesson is showing.
Adjusting a crop.
But I think it's important to also look at when you've affected something how to then make it work for
you.
And that literally needs to be more in shot.
But that animating in of the crop just really, really helps a whole a whole lot.
And it's something that I wanted to do.
And I actually recorded on a previous, previous clip.
And then I trust that I trust the audio.
So that to rerecord it again is let's, let's add a bit of animation to this as well, because I want
to do a slow pan across.
And I think now that we've got the black bars, we can really go cinematic.
But the thing is, is we've got the bars on the top and the bottom.
So we've got that freedom of movement up and down, maybe about to there.
But we haven't got the freedom of freedom of movement side to side, you see.
So what I'm going to do is I'm actually going to zoom in a little bit because I want a pan from maybe
I will.
I'll just show you.
Let me bring up those safe margins and I'm going to punch in by, let's say, 85 at no.
Remember, 85, we'll take it down.
So let's say maybe 120, actually, let's just go ahead by 20%.
And I want to reframe that because I know it kind of stay still, but I want to give it a little bit
of a a travel across the screen.
So if we start there, I'm looking here now, the edge of the crust.
We've got room to get over to that.
So I'm looking at that bit of edge of the crust there.
We've got room to travel between those two points.
So I'm going to keyframe, but I'm not going to ease these because I'm going to do it throughout the
whole of the clip.
Keyframe that and put that to the end.
But yeah, I'm happy there.
I'm going to move that over to there, bring that to the end.
And now we've got the black bars that have cropped in at the beginning and it looks all really cinematic.
And then.
We've got that slow movement going across, which wasn't in the original.
You see how just with a with a few little tweaks to your key framing, you can really level up the quality
of the whole of the video.
Let's have a quick watch.
Back now with the voiceover, with the music.
I just how much more cinematic this is looking as we're building on it.
When we think of outdoor cooking, we think back to nature, log fires, open flames and a good char
on the food being served.
That is why our biggest focus for our products is making sure you get that authentic wood fired taste.
When it comes to pizza, making our number one pizza oven is the go to family choice.
We have carefully designed the ovens so that there is a perfect flow of heat throughout and you can
be cooking in as little as 15 minutes.
The steel pizza base is different from the traditional stone used in most ovens, as we believe from
rigorous testing, that this gives you the perfect crisp base to your pizza.
Good.
I'm happy with that.
I'm really happy with that.
It's just oh, it's all coming together now.
So going on from this section, we're going to look more at the color section with the adjustment layer
and without the adjustment layer.
So I'm glad I've introduced the adjustment layer at this point, but by now you should be feeling quite
confident with key framing and what at least what you can start to do with key framing will be built
in on with that.
But yeah, we're doing well.
You're quite into this course now, I hope.
I really do hope you're enjoying it.
Make sure that you do go over any section that you don't think you quite got and go over it again.
You're not going to retain all the information straight away.
But yeah, I'm excited where this is going to go next.

## 13 Basic Colour Correction and Grading
### 1. Lumetri Global Effects - Basic Exposure & WB Correction

Okay.
So now we're on to basic color correction and grading.
We're going to start off with the military global effects.
What does that mean?
Well, the military is the color correction engine inside premiere pro engine tool, whatever you'd
like to call it.
But the metric color is what we use in in Premiere Pro.
And what we're going to be dealing with in this chapter is basic exposure correction and white balance
correction will then progress through this chapter with other things that you can do with regards to
the color correction and color grading.
So first and foremost, I've selected this clip to make some changes to looking at it.
Let's get it away from the black bars that we've put in.
I'm going to hold down alt and click and drag while still holding down alt and let go of my mouse button.
And we've made a duplicate of this.
We've done that with other things so far.
But just to to repeat, it's a really easy way to duplicate what you need.
You can copy and paste like you would do in n word, but this is by far the easiest way to duplicate
anything in Premiere Pro, I think because you can do it in after effects as well.
And the whole Adobe Suite really air Photoshop, illustrator, InDesign, everything.
So now we've got this clip just on it.
So I'm just going to zoom into here and just a reminder, this is the clip where I was trying to get
the pizza to slide off the peel.
So we're just going to stop here at one frame in this clip.
And what we need to do is we need to change our workspace.
We are currently in Adam editing.
That's the workspace we set up with everything that we need for general editing.
We now need to deep dive into one certain element and that is color.
So here it is.
Up here it's the American US English spelling because it's an American program.
It doesn't offend me too much.
I'd love to have a UK version, but yeah, we click onto colour and now we're greeted with a different
workspace.
As you can see, the project, the project area has been moved down to here we have we have these history
and markers and all the different things that we deleted from the previous workspace in editing.
But it doesn't really bother me because I don't really access this down here.
If I could get rid of it, I'm going to I'm just going to.
So just a reminder, when you want to make any changes with regards to your workspace, you right click
whatever you don't want.
And close panel, I'm going to continue doing that with the rest of these just to get rid of them because
I really don't use them.
I've got my selection tools down here.
If I need them, I probably won't.
Although yes, sometimes you do me with the pen tool.
We'll deal with that a little bit later.
And we have our effects controls, which isn't necessarily that important.
What we do want is telemetry scopes.
Let me very briefly explain to you what we're seeing here, if you see this.
That looks very similar to maybe this shape.
Now, what this is doing is it's not showing you this image, although this is a little bit taller than
this is.
But what this is doing is it's measuring from 0 to 100, which is black through to whites and all the
different colors.
As you can see, there's red, green and blue AGP making up all the colors of the spectrum.
And what we have here down here are a certain areas which are closer to black, so close to the shadows
and complete blackness, and appear all the way up to whites.
And as you can see up here, this is very similar to the wave form.
When we were looking at the wave form before and we were looking at let me just get away from.
And you can see how the zero is right in the middle because we're in a stereo stereo pair.
But even if this was mono, we just have one of these taking up the whole.
But whereas this is zero, right the way through the middle and then it's maximum on the edges.
And let me show you scope.
If I click back, that clip zero is here and 100 or all the way up is right up here.
So if we apply the same thoughts from a waveform, where is that gun as a waveform to telemetry scopes?
What we can see is that the certain parts right in the middle of this image that are almost clipped,
just like in in sound, we say that it's clipping or peaking in color.
We say that we're clipping.
And as you can see, certain parts of this greens and some reds are you see how there's a red tinge
here are clipped.
Now, if we look across what I'm assuming, these bits of green will relate to all the leaves of basil
on the actual pizza.
Reason why I think that is because this one here is not only green but is really quite light or bright
and that will be affecting that if we scrub through a little.
You can see that these things change and actually that stays that doesn't move to the left or right.
So it's quite possibly this behind it, this plant behind, if we scrub a little bit further and it
doesn't move, whereas these bits of green are moving, which are no doubt the leaves of basil.
It's funny how they're very similar in shape.
It's not really it's it's not that funny at all.
It's it's green.
And also, you can see parts of green here that are are kind of washing through.
And that's no doubt this line of green we have here.
So this this is a great example, actually, how to explain this this limited scope.
There are certain different types of limited scope, but this is the one that we're looking at right
now, which is the waveform ogbe.
We also have a parade which splits the red, the green and the blue into different sections.
So you can see.
But let's just get rid of the parade for now.
Also, you can see this blue here.
So let's let's take a little bit of time and look through this image and see what we're seeing.
So there's this blue here and it's not a hundred.
So it's not really bright.
It's also not zero.
So it's not really dark.
I would imagine that this blue here not only means this, in fact, I would say that that definitely
means that because that's a definite blue.
However, we have a little bit of bluish ness, definitely not a word here as well, which is quite
possibly this here, which is actually an outdoor rock.
Never knew such a thing existed, but my wife introduced me to an outdoor rock last year.
Looking further, we have this little bit of purple here and I would imagine this is somewhere in the
blue red.
Six of the purple is made up of blue and red.
And as you can see, as we're moving through, we have a spike here of white.
I'm imagining that is the watch strap for my wife's Fitbit.
If we move it back and forth, that kind of works with her movement as well.
I'm looking here now as I move back and forth and yeah, that makes sense.
And of course, the whites here and the white here are the the the plate right here.
And a lot of the whites through here, although they're not brights, they are reflective.
And that's no doubt the pizza peel, but also parts of the mozzarella.
It's amazing what you can see.
What.
You understand the way forward.
GP And and can see and read it.
There's even parts of the yellow here which are quite bright and they're probably well they're no doubt
definitely adding to the blue and green here because blue and green together make yellow.
That's understanding this.
Now let's do a little bit of basic exposure and white balance correction because as I said, you can
see that some of this is actually clipped now in videography.
Quite often it's a balance between what you want to keep and what you are willing to lose.
When it comes to exposure, the amount of times where you're in a on a shoot and it's a very bright
sky behind you, and if you expose for the sky, so say we want to expose for this sky in the shoot.
And we wanted that to maybe show all the details of the cloud that was over.
It was a little bit overcast this day and you wanted to show all the details of that, then you'd bring
all the exposure down.
I'm just going to I'm going to try and do it a little bit in here to kind of show you.
I don't really think that show that much because we don't this isn't raw video.
By raw video, I mean video of a quality that's captured by a four or £5,000 camera.
We don't have the colour the color capture in a in a £2,000 camera, which is what was used in this.
It's all about colour space and where in 4 to 2 of them, four for four.
But if I bring down exposure, we're still not getting any details back here.
And that's because you see how this line is staying.
Not means it's clipped.
Don't forget anything in this.
If you want to get it back to zero, double click the slider and then brings it back up to the default
of 00000.
What I mean by this is the fact that we've blown out the effect is you've blown out the whites and quite
often on the shoot you need to be ready to sacrifice certain things, to be able to keep everything
else that you want reasonably exposed.
And by exposed I mean lit and if and exposed for up here and to bring in and to keep in all these shadows,
I would have brought down the exposure to allow for the brightness.
But bringing down the exposure to allow for the brightness in the sky would have meant that this would
be super underexposed.
And it's that battle.
And that's what I've done here.
I've exposed for the subject, which is this which as you can see, is, is well exposed.
You can, you can see it all.
It's well-lit.
You've got all the colours going all the way through it and the lightness.
But we have lost the, the sky.
But in all honesty, are you really looking at the sky?
Are you even looking at the trampoline that might there be something still?
You know, you're looking at this subject here.
So this is what we're paying attention to and what we want to make sure that the exposure and the white
balance is correct.
For now, the white balance also is something that you can maybe tweak a little bit.
But again, it depends on the quality of the footage that you have if you're shooting raw video, which
again, not only is next from a very expensive camera, it's an extremely large file size and a lot
of computers struggle with it.
But if you were shooting with very, very expensive footage, which this isn't, you would be able to
change a lot of the colours and a lot of the white balance and still keep the quality.
The problem is, once you start playing around with colours in in video, they can do what is referred
to in the industry as the picture can fall apart.
Let me show you an example of the picture falling apart.
I can see that the shadows on anywhere near.
So let me bring those shadows down.
Forget about the warmth.
We're adding warmth here because we're bringing down all the shadows.
That's all the shadows within all of the colours.
But if I bring down the blacks.
See how if you look in my wife's top here, you can see how if I tilde to make it bigger, I can see
how we now bringing in a lot of noise.
This doesn't look natural at all.
It's not a nice gradient through the color.
And again, this is a common fight that all videographers and editors have.
But as you can see, this doesn't look anywhere near as good quality as controls that, controls that.
Do it again.
And as good quality as that, this looks relatively flat, but it looks much better quality.
And that's because the image isn't falling apart.
So let's just do some basics within what we can do with this footage without it falling apart.
Well, first and foremost, it is a little bit overexposed, but I don't want to bring down the exposure
because everything here is okay for me.
So I going do something to bring down the highlights.
So the highlights all the way at the top here.
I'm going to bring down the highlights just a smidge and you see how everything comes down, because
this is what's called a global edit.
And this deals with everything in the image.
We can you can highlight certain areas and we'll do that in a in a later section.
But this is a global, as it were, affecting all of the image.
Bring down those highlights just a little bit more.
A lovely little tip is if you've got to that point, I don't really want to bring any further down.
-18.2.
Now, if I bring any further down, you start to have the head start to have effects with the color
that it just they just don't really look good.
It just doesn't look good.
Again, this is all personal preference and it's your own eye, which is what all of this is you're
making without sounding too cliche, you're making art and it's your interpretation.
But my interpretation is I don't like that.
Bear in mind that things will look different on different monitors depending on if it's calibrated or
if it's not.
I'm on a on a fully calibrated monitor, which shows me true color.
And the beauty of that is that I have the correct starting position because you can see all of your
videos that you create will be watched on a variety of different monitors, whether it be a TV that's
24 inch or 58, 65, 75 inches, which will all have different color spaces.
You could also be showing on your phone or someone's phone and the time of day will affect because it
will depend what brightness their phone is set up, whether they have the blue light field filter taken
out, so all the blues will be out.
So whereas with that in mind, say you, this is your video and you're showing this.
If I go to pay no attention to this at the moment but say someone's got the blue light filter on and
that means that blues are reduced, doesn't really make much of a difference in this image because we
don't have much blue.
But if I go for hue versus hue as well, I may be in affects the blue in a way of it warms up the blues
all of a sudden.
And I know that doesn't look like much, but if you look here, right here, these sticks, which are
to do with my next door neighbor's trampoline, if I take off that effect, those are blue, but I've
changed that blue to red.
Now, imagine if something was majorly blue in your shoot and then someone's watching it on an edit
on a on a phone that's got the blue light filter turned off.
That can make a big, big difference.
Like a huge difference.
Let's pretend blue is red and let's apply that to to this because we've got quite a lot of red and orange.
If we brought down the red, I mean, that's desaturated a lot.
You may not be able to tell, but it really has.
And if we take down the red and and recolor it for something, all of a sudden your red sauce has gone.
Well, it's on its way to green.
I mean, that's just that's a subtle it's not necessarily I can't even quite see possibly real green.
But I mean, let's let's let's say it goes all the way.
In fact, let's let's color pink to show you that color there.
That's orange.
And maybe that someone's watching on a device which oranges show as yellow.
Well, we're halfway to green now, and all of a sudden your orange looks yellow.
So this is something to bear in mind with regards to your colours, because you want your colours as
accurate as you can.
At the starting point.
I've shown you extremes here, which are really to be taken with a pinch of salt as it's a slice of
the pizza.
But yeah, I just wanted to explain that with regards to the.
Different devices that someone may be watching your videos on and to bear that in mind because you want
to get your colors as accurate as you can straight off the bat.
So with that in mind, let's maybe see if we can get the white balance any better.
I think I exposed for white balance and I set my white balancing camera really quite accurately.
But let's just double check here.
Right here we have on the white balance, we have WB selector and we have what's called an eyedropper.
What we can do with this is we can click it once and then bring this.
I'm not holding down.
I've just clicked it once and I've selected this and I need to find white.
But I don't.
What you want to find is kind of a gray.
It's called 18% gray.
And that's actually perfect white.
This actually looks quite gray.
It's not accurately gray, but let's select this and see what's the rest of the picture does.
What I'm telling now is I'm telling luminary color, which, as you can see, it's okay.
I'm telling limit.
You color that this is white and let's see what happens to the picture.
Did you notice?
Change?
Let me undo.
And redo, undo and redo.
He actually has a lot of warmth or there's a little bit of warmth coming up here.
We saw very little change.
And the reason for that is the fact that I got white very accurate in the actual filming of this.
I set my white balance really quite accurately.
So that's quite a reassurance that you've done the right thing.
I'm going to undo that because it doesn't really make a difference.
So what else can we do to this picture with regards to basic exposure and white balance?
Well, first and foremost, as I said before, when we came back to this, it's a little bit flat.
And what can help with flatness in an image is contrast and undertone.
We have contrast here.
We've already taken the highlights down a little bit.
If we add a little bit of contrast, let me take it all the way up so you can see see what it does.
It makes a lot the colors richer.
It doesn't increase the saturation, but it makes them richer.
Let me just get that off.
See the difference.
So I'm going to boost that contrast just a little bit.
And what I would also do is I you see how we're nowhere near zero.
That means we're not really using the whole of the color gamut game.
You take a whole gamut, which is 0 to 100 or zero to 2 to 5, depending on which side of the scale
you're looking at.
I prefer 0 to 100 because, well, it's just easier to see.
There's a lot of science that goes into this and that's not my forte, but I can make things look pretty.
So what I want to do is I want to cross the the the shadows a bit, cross the blacks.
And that's that's another terminology.
You lift the highlights if you need to.
We've actually crushed the highlights a little bit and we're going to cross the shadows a little bit.
What we can do is we're going to keep an eye on this.
We're also going to keep an eye on the parade down here of the waveform.
And let's see how that affects both.
Okay, so we're bringing them down.
That's too far because the color looks too much.
And the reason why that's affected the color is because it's bringing down the shadows within all of
these colors as well.
So let's bring those shadows a little bit back up.
So we're still representing best.
That's just to look like again and see where we're at.
Okay.
So I want to break down just a little bit.
And so we're a little bit further down.
We're not all the way down, but we've added quite a bit of change here.
And to show us how much change we've we've made under this basic correction, you can toggle it on and
off.
So that's ten enough.
That was the original turn that back on.
And yeah, you can see a big difference in the image if by the way, if we go to effects controls it's
added limit you color in here remember how we were adding other things like crop and stuff like that
it the minute you come into color and you start to play, it adds limit to color in here.
So turning this off is the same as turning off the effects here.
Okay.
Just for the draw the line between the two.
So if you have a back in in your editing workspace and you think, oh, I just want to double check
if that what the meta is doing, you go to effects controls on the clip you're using and you can easily
toggle on and off.
You can also if you if you don't need to go all the way up to color, maybe you think are actually one
other little bit more contrast.
You can twirl these down and all of a sudden you have here what you had over in the color space.
So you can easily just or maybe just add a bit more.
That's a lot more contrast, just a little bit more contrast in this bit without heading back over to
the color.
But let's head back over to the color because I want to play around again with with this in this area.
So as you can see, we've also got saturation at 100%.
That's although that's 100%.
It's only in the middle because you can boost your saturation by a further 100%, which I'm sure we'll
all agree looks more like a parsed lemon music video.
If you don't know Barcelona's, you need to look them up.
It's a lot of music videos.
Elsa was the director for Romeo and Juliet, the film, lots of colors, very, very rich colors.
But yeah, we that's not necessarily what we're looking for here.
And it's funny, if you if you do start playing around with saturation and boost it, you can see where
colors are, which aren't necessarily clear when saturation is just set to normal.
Look down underneath here.
I noticed something when I pulled up that saturation.
This looks a little bit well, it's under it's under here.
So it's being shadowed and kind of browns.
But if I boost saturation, you can actually see that a lot of yellow comes here as well.
So that's I mean, it's good to see these things because you can see actually where the colors are.
And if you go back to limit you scopes and we boost that saturation again, you can see that this starts
to really separate out.
And where there's a rich red the reds come into play with is a rich blue.
The blues really come out.
And this blue now I can see is actually this plate.
And it's this is actually a blue plate, but it's a very, very subtle blue.
It's nowhere near as much of a blue as this could us that bring that out.
But you don't want it, by the way, you don't want to stay in full saturation for too long because
once you bring it back, everything looks really flat.
Let me redo that control control shift set.
So that was where we were at at that point.
If I undo that, all of a sudden it looks flat.
But if I actually take off, limit your color totally, that will show you just how flat it was just
to almost reassure you.
You need to reassure yourself that, no, no, no, it's not actually too bad and it's not flat at all.
I'm just seeing it very, very oversaturated, much like when we were time the music in a previous chapter
and the music that we came back to after we'd spent it up something crazy and felt really slow.
It's not.
It's just in relation to where you were at before.
That's why it's also quite, quite good to step away from a video.
Edit When you get to a certain point, step away from it, go and get a coffee or tea or a water or
go for a walk.
Stay away for a good few minutes, maybe an hour, even a couple of hours, and then come back and see
it with a fresh set of eyes.
Because you can you can start to be blind to a to certain things within your video if you spend too
much time away from it.
So it's really important.
That's why in a lot of editing houses, you have a number of people all working on the same edits,
but they'll only work on it one at a time.
So then one person will do the work and then someone else will come in with a fresh set of eyes and
see what they're doing within the.
Oh yeah, it needs this change.
In this change.
And that's.
Where collaboration in editing can really help or it can hinder if you're used to editing yourself,
I'd hate some cutting to play with my edit, but hey, it's different strokes.
And so that's in your basic correction area.
We all can look in the creative section a little bit later and the curves maybe a little bit with the
color wheels and maybe a little bit with each cell secondary.
We could also play with vignettes.
Curves is really quite a powerful tool as well.
But yeah, for now that is the start of your basic color correction and grading.
I think you'll agree.
I think you'll be hard pushed not to agree, but with that being our starting point, although it feels
like we've done more than you can actually see.
But when I turn back on the meet you color, you could definitely, definitely agree that that's a much
richer, much richer picture for us to be to be viewing.
Let me play it through so you can see, in fact, I'm going to duplicate this.
So I got two versions of it now and I'm going to turn off each color for this one.
I'm going to play them one after the other, without and with.
Let's have a look.
I mean, it's it's night and day, at least for me.
It's night and day.
The difference, I hope that has shown you just a little bit of what we can do in our color space within
Premier Pro.
And from now on we're going to be building on that.


### 2. Creative Section of Lumetri (Correction & Creative LUTs)

So building on what we've already learned with regards to color grading, color correction, with the
basic exposure and white balance correction, we're now going to look at the a thing called a lot.
That's l u t, it stands for look up table.
And what that is in essence is it's a series of values that you load in to your color correction area.
And it will tell you it will tell the program certain values.
So red should be this green should be this, blue should be bears exposure.
Is this contrast, is this a whole host of things?
And you've got two different types of lots.
You've got a correction lot and you've got a creative lot.
Now there are no looks included in this course, firstly, because it's a very suggestible area.
And secondly, all of these are paid for and they can really range in their quality and effectiveness.
And it all depends on what you're shooting.
So if looks is something once we've gone through this that you do want to know more about, there's
a whole host of explainers out there, some good, some not great.
But if you get in some camera groups and some video editing groups, you can see what is generally used
within the industry.
I'm going to be using one set of lots in this that I highly recommend, but that is mainly in my case,
which is why I won't be linking to them.
But you will see the name of them so you can look them up if you need to.
The way in which we bring in a corrective lot is we've already seen this space, but we've now collapsed
it back down.
I'm going to open it back up again.
As you can see, you can open up the base correction, you can open up the creative and it closes up
the basic correction.
You see you just working one area at a time, but we can look at an input lot.
And first and foremost, the inputs lot will affect kind of all these things.
But without showing it's in here because then you can go further if it's not quite where you want it.
So I'm going to do is I'm going to reset all this back to original.
The way in which you do you can do this is I've hit that reset over here in effects controls or you
can reset it within the limit panel and that just resets everything back to zero.
Everything is back to the start.
And the way in which you bring in an input is you click this dropdown.
Now I've got a lot more or a considerable amount more than you have.
You'll probably have Alexa through down to maybe a lock, maybe not.
Ari Universal And you probably have Phantom.
Rex 709 Gamma I'm going to show you what it looks like when you load on the wrong corrective lot, because
what these lots are doing is they're assuming that your footage is at a certain state, whether it be
fully desaturated and flat or lacking only in contrast, these are all these are all industry standard
that a lot of people use.
But I'm going to show you what happens when you put in what was supposed to be doing here is correcting.
So bringing everything where it needs to be because this image is quite flat and that's when it was
shut up because this was shot in what is known as Sydney two, which is a log profile.
And what that does is it doesn't underexposed, it doesn't overexpose, it crushes a lot of the things
within it the colours, the shadows, the highlights, but in a way that can be built and edited to
a certain extent within the actual software, it's a much bigger file type.
If you're familiar with with photo, you've got raw and you've got JPEG.
Well, this is although it's not raw video, it's closer to raw in photo than a jpeg in a photo, if
that makes sense.
So first and foremost, we're going to go into a basic color correction and this is the wrong corrective
lot.
Watch this.
That does nothing for me.
It just wipes out everything.
If I go into the meat you scopes, you can see that everything has been lifted.
I could then try and bring things down, maybe overall exposure, bring it down.
But obviously I'm bringing everything down so it's still looking white it out.
Even if I bring it all the way down, I mean, we're going dark, but everything just looks desaturated.
Let me control the controls that.
Can you do anything else with that?
This is supposed to be a corrective lot.
I know I'm kind of overrating the putting here, but this is to really highlight how you can't really
do that much without a lot of work with the wrong corrective looked on.
Definitely needs some contrast.
So let's boost the contrast.
Doesn't really do much.
Let's bring down the blacks.
Blacks are all the way down and we're nowhere near black.
I think I've made that point.
So that was the wrong corrective.
Look, now we've reset this.
This actually looks really quite saturated now, even though it looked flat before we started again
is the power of suggestion and comparing where you were at to where you are.
Anyway, let's put on the right corrective look.
So I use the Leeming lot system.
We're actually at Pro three now.
It's produced by Geico, Paul Leeming.
He's got a lovely group on Facebook and he was over in Australia looking after his sick father quite
recently.
I think he's in Switzerland, he's somewhere and he's a lovely guy and he's so helpful.
But as I said, I'm shooting this in Sydney too and this is the Sydney to Sony A-Series pro to Leeming
lot correction because I shoot on the OR this footage was shot on the Sony A7 three so I'm going to
click Sydney to.
All of a sudden.
You see what I'm saying?
Let's deselect that out.
That makes a huge difference.
Okay.
We may be a little bit oversaturated, but if you look here, the colors are still quite well represented
and we've got a much better starting position because that's what we want.
It's correct.
It's a corrective lit to start where we want to go from.
It gives you a better starting position than this.
Now it looks flat.
You see what I'm saying?
Okay, so now let's start with this.
And is it is it too saturated?
I don't know.
Maybe a little bit.
Let's bring down that saturation a little.
You see that does that just kills everything?
There's no saturation.
No.
So what you can do is you see how I'm already starting to play in here with the basic correction again,
but everything's starting at zero again.
So we're being given a better starting position and we have the full range of these sliders.
Rather than say, I've brought one slider all the way to one side just to get here, there's nowhere
further we can go.
So let's, let's kind of build on this, maybe bring down the highlights a little bit.
That brings about, well, a bit more richness in here.
But as I said, it feels a little bit oversaturated to me.
But the minute I take out the saturation, it just kind of washes out and that's the tiny spit out.
So I'm going to do is I'm going to try and cool this a little and that's where the temperature within
the white balance can really affect you.
Don't be changing this too much because it can really break up an image and make it really fall apart.
But a slight tweak to the temperature.
Hmm.
So what that's done is it's brought it's kind of moved away from the warm orange tones to the blue tones.
If you look in on a color wheel, in fact, we can bring up the color wheel.
Why you?
Yeah.
So this is the color wheel.
And this is what's known as the flash line.
Let me just tell you this.
This is what's known as the flash lines.
All flash colors kind of go along this line.
But the point I want to make is that if you look here, here's red and here's cyan or light blue, his
orange and his blue.
So if we go back here, if we said orange was like maybe midway between red and yellow, which would
be here, the opposite side would be somewhere between dark blue and cyan.
So, yeah, that makes sense.
Orange and blue.
Similarly with the with the tint, we've got magenta and green.
If we go back into here, you know what I'm saying?
Magenta and green.
And what these two sliders do is they literally run.
They literally run a cross section through the color wheel.
If you imagine a line going from the magenta to the green.
That's right.
The way through the middle, that angle and the orange to blue runs right the way through that angle,
we were almost creating an X.
And why that's important is because these two, the temperature in the tent can actually change all
the colors.
With just two sliders, I'm at -7.3.
Let's say I go all the way blue and then all the way magenta.
You would agree that's completely changed the color space.
I say completely green is still green and blue is still kind of blue because they are dominant colors
within this composition.
However, most of the other colors were changed.
Let me just double click this and bring it back and show you that difference.
It's subtle, but it's all it needs to be.
It just needs to be okay.
It makes it look a little bit cooler, but it really makes the colors pop.
If we wanted it to be more of a of a summer's evening, which is actually what this was, you could
always go a little bit more in the warm tones.
You see how that really affects it.
And actually, there's no wrong answer here.
Now that we've got this corrected lot on here, it gives us more of a room to play.
And although you could say that this was the creative side, well, we're not in the creative side yet.
We're going to be very shortly.
And with that in mind, I'm going to take that temperature back.
I'm going to lead the highlights down, because in all honesty, I think on further examination of this,
I think maybe yeah, I think maybe the highlights were a little bit too much.
So it wasn't necessarily overexposed, but it was close to overexposure.
So I'm going to I'm going to place those.
It's somewhere about Yeah.
-14 or something.
I'm also going to boost the contrast a little bit.
That just makes it a little bit more richer throughout.
You can see now with a little bit of work that I've done here in this basic correction, you can see
now why there are people who specialize in color and color grading.
They're actually called colorists and big productions.
Those people are brought in to literally color grade and color.
Correct the footage, which in my opinion puts a lot more pressure on the on the camera operators and
the director of photography, which is what they call it.
They're called the DPS or the DPS.
And that's the person who's over all the equipment and everything to do with the with the cap, with
the image capture.
Because if you don't get the right or at least the correct white balance and the correct settings in-camera,
you add a hell of a lot more work for your colorist to have to deal with to get it to a usable state
in your production.
So building on from that, we have this in an effectively a usable state.
It's corrected.
I make videos every single day for for corporate clients.
My wife and I were getting into weddings this year and one of the most satisfying things I ever do in
an edit and one of the yeah, it is.
I mean, I love and I love getting something that looks just at the end of an edit and you think, Yeah,
I've really put my heart and soul into that.
And you can really it's a really oh, it's such a satisfying video.
But honestly, that first time when I bring in new footage and I put on that corrective look, that
just fills me with joy.
And in all honesty, I think it at least reassures me that I'm in the right industry.
So moving in moving on from this, now that we've we've got this with an.
Input lot and wear in a more presentable bit, we can now start to have fun.
And by fun I mean we can take it up another notch should we wish in the creative section.
Now bear in mind that everything that you do with a lot with another type of lot in this section can
be done throughout the whole of the the color panel.
With regards to creative in the curves, which we are going to touch on and the color wheels and the
Excel secondary.
But a lot can be done for you, just like with the quick to create a corrective look can get you to
a better starting position.
A creative lot can get you to an end position without doing too much work.
And there are two ways to select a creative lot.
You will have to load these in.
I have a load of lots already in here, a number of creative lots from the leaning lot pro selection
as well.
These are called quickies and that's exactly what they are.
They're a quick selection to put on and to get near or where you want to be to add more lots.
Any pack that you get down will have installation guide.
Some of them are a little bit different, but yeah, the way in which you add in the creative look once
it's in your system is to drop down and either select it from here, browse to one that's not currently
installed into Premiere, or you can use this panel here.
So this actually shows the video without your clip, without any basic correction on it, but it can
give you a good signifier as to where a lot can take you.
I mean, that's a big change.
But as you can see, this is toggled over.
But this hasn't changed because as you can see now, once we if we go back to here, our mouse stays
as a pointer.
But if we click over to the next one, which is Sydney space two, three, that one we have now a selection
finger.
And if we click it that will then apply it to here.
Now that's garbage.
Or is it because what we've applied is a creative lot on top of a corrective lot, but this creative
lot is intensity 100%.
Now remember how down here in the saturation and up here the saturation saturation is on your percent,
but the slider is only in the middle, while the same is here for the intensity of your creative lot,
because you can even double that which looks even more garbage double click to bring it to the beginning.
Or you can scale down that intensity maybe to around 30.
Now that looks better, doesn't it?
And that looks if we toggle off the creative, this is the beauty of here because rather than undoing,
you can toggle on and off to check actually what you've done and what changes and what difference what
you've done has made to the final output.
If we untangle this, actually, yeah, it's made a it's made a huge difference and that might be what
you're looking for.
Good.
You're doing literally within one click to add Sydney to one click to add a bit of contrast, another
click to take down the highlights.
That's three clicks and then four clicks to select this, and fifth to take down the intensity in five
clicks you've gone from.
This.
To this.
Now colorists can train for years and take ages to get to this point.
Good colorists.
Yeah.
Okay.
They can do a hell of a lot quicker.
But I hope you get what I'm saying here.
With just a couple of clicks, you can have your footage that comes in go from this to this.
And I'm sure you'll agree it looks much warmer.
Let's say that.
Let's look for a few of the creative lots.
I'm going to drop this down now so we don't necessarily have to commit them all.
Let's take that intensity, by the way, back to 100%.
So now let's go to let's go for a LEMING look quickie.
This makes it brighter.
It doesn't really do much.
Not in this setting.
Neutral film.
That's quite nice.
Let's go for a neutral film.
Brightest.
Now, that's a little bit too much.
But I know with neutral film.
Film Brightest, it does have quite a bit.
So if I bring down that intensity that all of a sudden without it.
It's brightened things, but it's not lost too much of the saturation.
You need to bear in mind that in direct contrast, excuse the pun, direct contrast with a corrective
lot.
A creative lot isn't necessarily going to work the same on every bit of footage that you put in.
When I say not necessarily, I mean not at all.
It completely depends on the footage that you put in.
Now, this neutral film, brightest at 100% intensity, might be absolutely correct for some piece of
footage, maybe something that you've shot at dusk in in the desert with loads of warm tones and all
about.
Maybe that's what you're looking for there, or in the cityscape again.
Maybe at night you want that little boost.
But cooking pizzas out in the back garden in late afternoon doesn't really cut.
So let's have a look at some others.
I mean, some of these absolutely are just everything.
Let's look at a big HDR.
I mean, that is just adding loads of kind of everything.
But again, you don't most lots you don't use that 100% intensity.
Let's bring it down to there and let's talk about off.
If you're looking around here, what it what this is doing is it's giving much more definition in the
in the shadows.
In and then without it it's punching through.
With regards to the darker areas.
So that's really good with that.
I like that it's a look at a clean Kodak and again, let's put 200%.
So without with that we bring down that intensity we were boosting.
No, don't do that.
We bring down the intensity.
And it's it's it's great.
I mean, you can really this is where you really can get as the actual section is titled Creative.
What I find really helps is when you toggle off and on, once you've done so, you think, Oh yeah,
that looks good if you talk it off and you actually well I actually prefer it without well it's not
the right lot.
And more often than not, depending on what you're making without a creative lot is what you want.
You may want to work in different areas and still within here, although we are going to look in the
curves and the color wheels within the creative area you can play around with also faded film.
I never use faded film.
I don't ever think it does anything decent.
I think it's there from years gone by and no one ever uses.
I don't know anyone in the industry that uses it.
I know quite a few people and you can sharpen not too much, but you could add a bit of sharpness if
we talk about off and on, can't really see too much, but if we're playing.
That definitely has added to the sharpness of the clip.
It certainly has.
You can make it more vibrant, which obviously it turns up the vibrance of the saturate of the colors,
but it doesn't boost the saturation that would be boosting the saturation.
In fact, let me just get down Vibrance.
That's turning up the saturation, which makes everything just very saturated.
Again, porthleven.
Or you can turn up the vibrance which it it it has the colours more exactly what it says.
Vibrant, but not rich in saturation.
And it's these little things that can really affect your overall picture.
Now, depending on what you watch on television, you may be also aware of of a colour grading technique
called orange and teal.
Now, if we look down here on this colour wheel, which is very similar to the way you view a colour
wheel here, you can see that red up here is red up here.
Green down here.
It's green down here.
So just to draw parallels, that's the same.
Remember this flash line which is along here?
That's effectively orange and the direct colour.
I mean, when I said it's somewhere between cyan and blue, dark blue.
Well, the actual the actual shade that's in-between here, which is more cyan than dark blue, is actually
teal.
That's the that's the shade of teal, which is right down here opposite say orange is maybe about 11:00.
Teal is about 5:00.
Now, what?
A lot of a lot of colour gray.
And I mean, in a Hollywood film as well as as as good quality television, it's it's a certain set
of colours that are really popular, not only in those industries, but popular with audiences as well.
And that means what that means the orange and teal look, is that you go with the shadows into the orange
and into the teal with the highlights.
Let's just see what effect that has.
So let's grab that and take it into the orange.
I mean, let's go overboard and let's get it right up into the orange.
Good.
And now let's get.
Now, that looks like when we grabbed this, I went all the way into the orange.
Remember that?
Much warmer into the temperature.
But the problem with that is that you could put everything over into the to the into the orange, into
the warmer temperature.
But then you can't go into the blue, which is where teal lives.
So what we've done is we've taken the shadows, we've put them into the orange.
And now what's happened when we get the highlights and put them into teal?
Not too much.
Taylor's actually breaking up that colleague.
See how it's breaking up everything.
If I bring a little bit further up.
See, again, this is what happens when you when you do too much to one part.
I see.
I brought that all the way down now.
And it's not it's not really showing what I want to show.
It's not really doing it.
Let me see if I can do it in curves.
No, it won't work with there either.
But what I'm what I'm effectively trying to show you is the orange and teal look can be applied at this
stage.
Should your footage allow it?
Let me see if I can play around.
Rather than I double click that to get that back to zero.
So the difference is that made.
Maybe if I bring everything cooler in the temperature and then that's my blue or the teal I want, and
then boost the oranges.
Yeah.
I mean, that's that's why we're there.
So if you look around here, you can see how you can do the same thing in different ways depending on
what the other values are.
It's, it's it's such a science.
It really is.
But effectively, what we here have here now is a basically corrected with a and a correction lot.
And we've worked with in the creative area, not with a creative lot, but playing with the shadow tent.
But effectively what we've done is we've made everything cooler and then we've taken the shadows and
made them warmer.
So if you look around here, if I toggle this off, it is subtle, but around the shadows here and I
mean the shadows here, the shadows throughout it all, even underneath here on the fence and in these
darker areas here, if I turn that back on all those shadows of warmed up and effectively we have a
version of the orange and tell look and that's that's simply done within the creative and the corrective
area.
Thing is, I don't really want an orange in to look for this because it's not it's not how I've shot
it and it's not what I was intending to do.
But let's have a little further look through here, because I want to see if there's anything that we
could use within these creative looks.
Blue steel and don't get the Zoolander reference day for night.
Yeah.
If you if you maybe brought down the intensity a little bit, that doesn't really work.
As I said, some of these looks, not only are they are they varying in quality, but also they vary
depending on depending on what footage you're putting, putting them on.
It's a real play around and it's a real place where you can either get really stuck or get really good
output from it.
But it takes time and it takes practice and you get to a point where you can you can easily look at
a piece of footage and think, Yeah, that's what I want to put on there.
That's not what I want to put on there.
But.
SL Noir, 1965.
It's not right for that.
But let's see if that is a correct.
No, that looks absolutely awful.
Again, these are awful lots.
They're just awful for this footage.
I think, to be honest with you, because of the camera that I'm using and what I've already done in
the street.
Yeah.
It's horrible what I've done in the.
In the street.
Basic correction.
I'm kind of at a point where I want to be looking back at that now.
Yeah.
In fact, all I really want to do, bearing in mind that I've added sharpness and have added vibrance
in here.
I do kind of just want to warm up those shadows just a little bit.
But to be honest with you, I'm happy with that.
I'm remembering what we've done is we've done a basic correction with a an input that we've played around
the contrast a little bit, a little bit with the highlights and then added in the creative section,
we've added a little bit of sharpness, a little bit of vibrance, and we've warmed the shadows ever
so slightly.
That's all we've done.
And if I go to effect controls and I toggle off, obviously I could talk them off here, but it's only
one at time.
The base correction of the creative.
If I come over here and toggle off all the matching color, that's where we started.
And now just with a few clips, a clicks and a bit of time spent in this area, we have such such a
more usable and so much more.
Or just a warmer piece of footage.
If I just mute these two tracks and get your eyes in on.
But I know if I bring it back here.
I mean, that just looks washed out in comparison now.
Like, completely washed out.
Doesn't look good at all.
Was that.
Oh, yeah.
Yeah, I can get on board with that.


### 3. Lumetri Curves

So this is where we left off from the creative area of the metric color there, basic color correction
and color grading in this chapter.
And just reminder, we are only working on this clip right now and that so we have as little distractions
as possible.
But I will show you the easy way to add this to all the clips and also how to add this to just one thing
and effect everything.
So we're on two curves.
And as you can see here in the color or the metrical it depending on how you want to say area.
We have basic correction.
Creative is just where we're at.
And we're now into curves.
Okay.
So what I'm going to do is I'm going to we could build on this light, we could do more things around
it.
But I want to strip this down just so we can wipe out looks all from washed out now, doesn't it?
It's going to strip this down to absolutely nothing.
So we can play with this again.
However, what I am going to do is I'm going to load in that corrective a lot.
So we've got a better starting position.
So again, with a strip down or virtually.
Well, no.
Let me show you color in the effects controls.
We're going to switch over to let me show you scopes and I'm going to drop down and select once again
Sinitta from the Leeming Lot section.
And that once again gives us our starting position.
I'm going to add a little bit more contrast.
Pretty sure that's what I did before.
Maybe Bring Down the Shadows actually makes it a bit more moody.
And I'm actually going to add a bit of sharpening, but doesn't really do much with regards to the curves.
It does little with regards to the shadows, but not too much.
So now we've got that basic where we want it.
Let's go into curves and this is where you can have a lot of fun.
And we'll show you a couple of things where you may have seen people have used on tik-tok for different
color changing.
And I'll show you just how easy that is in this section.
This is where all the magic happens with regards to really creative play with with color.
So first and foremost, right at the top, we have red as a white, even red, green and blue.
And if we bring actually now in our parade ogbe, so we have that collective, which is effectively
a mash of red, green and blue and white and black or highlights and shadows.
But this is what we're kind of going to be looking at.
I'm going to leave this up as well, just so you can kind of see how it affects this.
But we're looking at this area not first, though, because we're looking at the white, which means
that's talking about the whites in the blacks, that's talking about the highlights and the shadows.
And if we look at this line here, this right down, bottom left is all shadows, all the way to black.
And up here is white's highlights all the way to white.
A typical shape in this curve is an S-curve, and I'll show you why.
As you see, we get when we put our cursor over the line, we get the option.
We get a pen tool, which is similar to this pencil down here.
See that pen?
We get the pencil and we also get the option of a plus.
If we click anywhere on this line, when the pen tool is selected or highlighted, we click and we've
actually made a point similar to a keyframe kind of in as much as that's a holding point.
And we're going to put another little one here.
And we're going to put another one here.
So effectively, we have a handle here, which we can't really do anything about.
We have a handle here which we can't really do anything about because those are the two extremes.
And we've other than a handle here, which is halfway through the shadows, and we've had added a handle
here, which is halfway through everything, and we've added a handle here.
I've got the heat just the right way there, which is halfway between the Met and the highlights.
Midtown's will be around here.
So S-curve, if we imagine we're drawing a s on an angle, you kind of draw an X like that.
Does that make sense?
So if you tilted your head to the right, so that line is like almost vertical and s would be like this
well actually more through the center and that let's just do it.
I'll show you.
So an S-curve in color grading is simply bringing down the shadows.
I'm bringing up the highlights.
How does that look?
Okay, well, let's bring down the shadows a bit.
And you can see the minute I start to move, things start to move down here.
Let me just bring that back up again.
You see how everything is coming down.
So over red screens, the shadows of red, the shadows, the deeper, darker greens.
And the same with the blues.
They're all coming down and everything is coming down here.
If I uncheck that, that will show you the difference that literally just that little drop in the ogbe
or the white at the exposure curve has done.
Now we do the same as in pulling down with the highlights.
That's going to bring down everything.
And you see how this starts to fall apart.
That's because those parts in the flesh and on the flesh line, in the flesh tone, are just there's
no information there to bring them down.
If we brought it up, though, more like an S-curve, I'm going to go extreme here.
You see how we go?
Absolutely flattening out there and you can see it flat out there.
That means it's peaking up there.
So if we bring that back down and we just leave it about there.
That's literally affected everything just with that S-curve, which is why you use this very subtly.
Let's bring that.
In fact, that's yeah, that's I'm going to undo everything there.
I'm going to show you how much I personally would do keeping an eye on here while I'm also keeping an
eye on here and keeping an eye on here.
You need like three sets of eyes.
But I would bring this down just a little bit.
If you look up here, undo that.
Look up here, look in the shadowed areas.
So the darker areas, not just underneath here, but this is starting to pop more as well.
I like that.
But if we bring that down just a little and we want to bring the highlight, so if I drag this a little
bit more to the left or more towards the center, where affecting more of the mid tones, though if
this wasn't here, this wouldn't hold the midtown and we'd be going up here somewhere and it would be
absolutely awful, which is why we set a handle here.
So the midtown stay where they are and we can't fully blow out the Midtown and lose it while we're affecting
the shadows and the highlights.
And that's kind of where I'd want to go.
So without and with.
They were losing a little bit of detail in the red.
If I drop that off.
We've lost a bit of detail there.
So what I want to do is I want to switch over to the red.
See how the red is.
The red line is now where the white line used to be.
So I'm going to do so.
I'm going to add another handle right in the middle there and have a handle the end of the handle there.
And I'm thinking this may be the shadows, the shadow area of the red.
So if I bring that, obviously it's orange, but it's within the red palette.
If I bring that down a little bit, I've got a little bit more coming into here.
Now, I don't really want to do anything more with regards to the red.
That's that's enough for me if I toggle that off and on.
Yeah, maybe actually a little bit too much to be fair.
So I'm going to bring that up.
I'm going to go back to the whites.
I'm going to bring.
Pat down a little bit more.
You see how microscopic you can be with your adjustments.
And it can it can just make the whole world a difference.
And this is just on the curve.
We haven't even got down to the saturation curves below.
We'll get to that greens.
I'm quite happy with the Greens where they're at.
I'm going to possibly and a handle there in the midterm to handle that in the highlights, maybe bring
down the highlights of the Greens, maybe to make them richer.
You only know when you start moving things and yeah I don't like that.
Yeah.
I'm not even affecting that.
And with the blues similar, if I put a handle there and maybe play with the highlights of the blues,
I don't like that you see how this curve is now being affected because this curve coming up by undid
that and put a handle there.
But then only does this little bit.
It only affects that little bit.
Obviously, you could put another handle right there so it wouldn't affect it at all.
You see how it's holding and the only place it's actually moving is right in the middle there, which
you can't really say.
Boost those blues again a little bit.
I'm happy with that.
I am.
Let's talk a laugh and toggle back on.
That's again, just a basic correction.
But if we toggled off all of them, each color, I mean, it really is.
I know I've said it before, but it's night and day.
The quality, I mean, is the quality, the quality staying the same?
We're just finessing the color, but it gives the impression of the quality being much better.
And that's because the production value is much better.
So that's how to play around.
Say you've got a really, really bright blue in there and you want to dial that back.
You could do it here in the B curves, however, you could also do it in Hue versus SAT.
So there's a difference between hue and saturation.
Okay, so hue is the color, saturation is the amount of color.
So a hue, this hue of green is a different hue to this hue of green.
A hue is a shade, if that makes sense.
So if you reach shade, so this green is a different shade of green to that green.
Okay, so let's say we want it to change green or at least bring greens down.
How would we do that?
Well, we could click here.
You see how that's created the handle, just like we would create a handle here and we could bring that
down.
But watch what happens.
Everything comes down and that's all the saturation all the way down.
So how do we just mean just this green?
Well, just like you put a handle here and a handle here or a main handle there to hold.
You could do it either side of the screen so we could click maybe that and that.
So I'm saying that that needs to be definite and that needs to be definite.
I will I will set what these do.
And if you pull down this one, we're only pulling down right in the middle and that is holding where
the other greens are.
As you can see, we're also moving side to side up to the point where we've put these handles.
So if I controls that and controls that back through again, so I just got the three.
If I hold on shift while I'm dragging, I can't go anywhere side to side.
I can only go down.
What's happened here?
Well, I've just I've just selected one green in here, so it's brought down.
If I undo that, you can see watch the greens over here as I bring this down holding shift.
It brings down certain shades or certain hues of green, but there are other hues of green that stay.
They haven't been affected at all.
And this is how you can dial in on a particular color if you want to change it or affect it in a certain
way.
Let me just control is that all of that?
There's a easier way to get the exact color of green that you want to effect, and that's with this
eyedropper tool.
Remember in Basic Correction, where we use the Eyedropper Tool to set white well, the Eyedropper tool
is synonymous throughout the whole of the Adobe Suite.
And it's it's predominantly well, it's mainly a color picker.
So what we want to do here is not affect anything.
When we, when we clicked on the Eyedropper Tool and clicked on here, it affected everything because
we were telling it with this eyedropper what was white in this section.
All we want to do is say, I want to reference this color.
This is what I want to work with.
So let's grab the Eyedropper Tool and let's select a green.
Now in that selection, it's done kind of what I did before.
You see how it's created.
Three holders, three handles.
Well, what it's actually done is it's selected this as the color that I selected, and it's selected
either side of that equal distance to give me a kind of range that I'm working with.
So now if I grab this and I hold on shift and I pull down.
We're now affecting much more than when we selected ourselves, not only because we selected here just
by eyeballing the color, but also the handles were closer together.
You see how we're now affecting much more of the green, but again, we're only affecting this green.
These greens are kind of unaffected.
How do we affect those?
Well, let's go again and use the Eyedropper Tool and click that.
Okay.
Now we're in a model because it's it's created another three handles, but within these three handles.
But now what we have is we have a selection from here to here.
Of all the greens within what we've already selected.
So let's see what we can do with this.
Let's pull down that one and maybe let's pull down this one.
And all of a sudden a lot of the greens have been desaturated.
See how these greens are still there?
They're not wholly there.
If I toggle this off, there's more green that comes back.
But that means that there must be some of the color within this green that staying prominent.
So let's see what hue of green that is.
Oh, okay.
See how.
Let me just undo that.
Look around here.
I'm just going to redo rather than clicking again.
But watch what gets created here.
When I engage the color selection of here controls shift and Z to redo.
All of a sudden we have a handle here and a handle here, which means there must be a handle here.
So this must be the center.
So actually we know by looking at it, we're going more into the yellow.
By the way, if we're right up in the edges and you couldn't quite see this little scrollbar kind of
move it around so you're you can be almost working in the center of us, too.
So it's like the wheel is turning round.
So if we want to get this down as well, let's get these down.
So let's pull that down and pull this down and pull that further down.
Okay.
That again, has desaturated because remember, we're working on hue versus saturation here.
So it's just the saturation of the hue that we're selecting.
But rather than say, I turn this off and just to kind of fire this home, if I going to creative,
I could also doing basic correction in saturation, but that's going creative and pull down saturation.
We're pulling down the saturation of everything.
So every bit of color, we're taking the saturation out of the color rise in the curves.
We're just bringing down that one color.
This is how you do an effect called color splash where say you've got someone wearing a red top and
they're in a colored scene and you only want the red top.
You would color pick the red and you would boost that saturation and color, pick everything else and
get rid of it.
And then you've got black and white with red.
The effect is called color splash, and it's very, very done, to be honest with you.
But it's used a lot if you've seen the film Schindler's List.
There's a little girl with a an orange coat, and the whole film is black and white other than her.
And that's how they've done that.
They've used hue versus saturation and turned down everything, the saturation of everything other than
her orange coat.
They probably master out as well and kind of done that.
But that's that's how you do it.
It's it's in this kind of area.
So that's hue versus saturation.
Let me undo all this, because we're also going to look at another powerful area here, and that's hue
versus hue.
And this is where you can really play and make some some crazy things.
Let's say that we've been we've been working with the Greens.
Let's say let's work with the Reds now and say I want the red to be green as well.
I want a whole green party going on here.
Okay.
So Hue versus hue is where you do that because hue versus saturation is setting the saturation of the
hue or the shade.
Hue versus hue is setting the shade of the shade or in essence, changing whatever shade you're picking
to whatever shade of color you want it to be.
It's getting the Eyedropper Tool again, and let's select this orange.
So that's right in the middle there.
And we've got a handles either side.
Now, when I click on this, I'm not going to move it.
I'm just going to hold down my left mouse button.
You're now greeted with the whole of the color wheel right from the top of of cyan over down to the
bottom.
Cyan going through pink, magenta, red, orange, yellow, green back into cyan.
So if I hold down shift so I can't move side to side and I maybe move down towards the green, watch
what happens.
That does not look appetizing, but we're all the way down and we're now into green.
So the only clues being affected now is that orange.
Get in there.
So let's get the rest of this screen, because we did it with his first saturation when we selecting
green and different hues of green.
Let's select this one and keep an eye on.
Keep an eye out down here if I click.
Okay.
We've now been given some more handles, so this is now the new safe point.
So let's bring these down.
We've got a whole host of Green.
However, look at the rest of the picture.
Look at where there shouldn't be green.
Well, first, that first and foremost, these lights.
Well, they were orange.
This roof here.
Well, that was kind of like a reddish orange at the skin tone here.
My wife isn't Elphaba from from wicked.
But that's a ready flesh tone, just like the orange here and down here as well.
The board is like a light wood, but it's green in here.
So what we're doing is this is a global effect, but just to one colour which can be really useful but
can also really ruin your your whole the whole picture.
However, let me say this just controls that and get rid of all of those.
Let's say that there's this blue rug here.
I want to change the colour of that blue rock because it's not supposed to be blue.
It's actually supposed to be more like a lucky yellow.
Easy.
We know what to do.
Hue versus hue, we colour pick and select that blue.
Bearing in mind that there are other there will be other things in this video, in this clip that have
that shade of blue.
It just depends how much.
Now we're all the way over to the side here.
So I'm actually going to pull out a little bit.
So we're in the centre and I'm going to crop this and what color this I want it to be.
I want it to be.
I can't remember.
Let's say we want it to be red.
So I'm holding down shift.
I can see below all the way through the rest of the blue and pink and into red.
So let's hold down, shift and drag down.
And I'm changing that colour.
I've also changed these colours, but hey, what can you do?
But sadly, I've got a blue fringe here.
So rather than going in and colour picking and adding to it, we know that that's we can see that that
is that maybe the lighter blue or the darker blue?
I don't know.
Let's find out.
Let's grab this and pull it out.
So it allows for more.
His mind too much?
Not really.
Maybe this is a clue where we are actually going to have to delve more in color, pick more of it.
Okay, we've got more here.
So let's bring all of these further down towards Fred.
The problem is, is that we've actually got all of these now.
We've got everything that was blue changed color.
So you can only really use this carefully.
What I'm going to do in an in a in a further section is we're going to talk about masking and how to
do this on just the area that you want to affect.
But for now, that's all I really want to show you.
With regards to Hue versus hue, it's being able to make colors, pop less, use it in a way that we
actually would that we actually want to use.
And what I want to do is I want to make this orange maybe just a little bit richer.
So let's go for hue versus hue.
And let's pick this orange.
So all the way over here, I'm going to bring this so we can see it.
And again, just like we were in here with the curves, I mean, we're talking just a little bit on
the a little bit of of changing.
So let's hold down shift and let's take it all the way there.
And it looks absolutely awful.
So let's just boost it just a little.
I mean, that's the tiniest little bit.
Let's talk about off and on.
You can see it just around here.
Look around here.
So it has boosted a little.
That's all I want to do, because then I'm going to do a little bit more in Hue versus Luma.
So what is Hue versus Luma?
Well, Hue, we know what you know is the shade.
Luma is the luminescence of it.
So similar to the to the vibration.
To the vibration, similar to the vibrance of it, I guess.
Vibration, vibrance.
I think they have the same etymology but the vibrance Luma is very similar to that in in in terms of
the luminescence.
Let's just, let's pick the same color in Hue as is Luma and let's see what we get.
So holding on shift on the orange and let's see the effect it makes.
Yeah.
Luminescence again.
This is it.
There's a there's a part where you want to be very careful and we're talking mind nuit changes and actually
to make the switch, I think I need to turn the luminescence, the Luma down a little bit.
So let's hold down shift and let's track it down just a little.
By the way, before we go any further, as you can see, we've got a line that has come up once I've
clicked and rather than huevos issue where we've got the full color wheel.
What we have here is we have the brightness and the darkness of this color.
So I was right.
If we bring it down a little.
See, that's even.
That's too much.
See how we're losing all the detail here to bring up just a little.
And if I toggle this off and on, you see how because we've we've chosen an orange color, we're actually
looking at all the warm tones as well.
So it gives it just a little bit more depth.
In fact, when we talk about off now, this for me round here looks a little bit too bright.
We turn it back on, but crushing it a little bit.
I like that.
So that's Hugh versus Luma.
And now Luma versus saturation.
How we got sat versus.
See how we can really deep dive.
I'm just going to show you exactly on the same one.
Hue versus saturation.
And what does that do?
Well, have a look if we take it down.
See how it takes all of a saturation out, because we're looking at is we're actually looking at a saturation
of the luminous part, the brighter part.
So if I do it the opposite way, all of a sudden these oranges almost become reds.
I mean, it's still orange.
But again, that boosts that area.
That part of the color.
Color wheel.
So I think that's as far as I would go, I wouldn't really use Luma versus item.
I'm using it here because I'm showing it.
But in this section I wouldn't really use Luma versus soft.
But just to complete, let's look at saturation versus saturation and let's click on the same bit and
let's click it and start moving.
And what does that do with that?
Literally just kills the saturation and that boosts all the saturation.
I mean, we literally are into red here.
And so that's set versus saturation rather than hue versus not because hue versus that would be clicking
on the hue of the color.
What we're looking at in SAP versus although you very rarely would use SAP versus south.
It's dialing into the actual saturation of that actual saturation, not necessarily the hue.
I hope that makes sense.
I really do.
But that's the curves.
And as you can see, it can be such a powerful tool when used correctly.
Let me just talk a laugh once more, toggle off all of the media color.
So that was our starting point.
Remember when we first started this and we were first doing the cut and this looked fine.
It looks bland and awful now that just left it.
And if I look at here in the LA media color panel, if I just take off what we've done with the curves,
I mean, wow.
That has just levelled up everything once again, like we did before.
I'm just going to I'm going to copy that over so we can see them side by side again.
I mean, that's just I mean, that's everything personally for me, for my I, I'd say that's a little
bit too oversaturated now, so.
Because nothing is destructive in this, you can easily go in and go, okay, I'm happy with everything.
I'm happy with all the levels of colors compared to the other colors or the other hues.
But I'm gonna just take down that saturation just a little bit, just to, just to just ease this a
little bit, just so it's not too to add almost offensive to the eyes.
But yeah, going from that to that is just, uh, we're into night and day territory, I guess.


### 4. Lumetri Colour Wheels

And now finally on our current section with regards to basic color correction and grading, we're going
to look at color wheels.
And I'll be honest, I don't really use the color wheels that often, and that's because I have a lot
of correction here in my input.
LUT And also I set white balance well in camera while I'm shooting.
However, sometimes you want a different look and sometimes you really need to correct bad footage.
It doesn't necessarily have to be bad footage.
You, as I said, you can just want a certain look, but this can really help with bad footage as well.
But let's, let's, let's start with good footage.
I'm not just saying that because I shot it, but just like we had basic correction and creative and
curves, we're going to go to color wheels a much I'm going to leave on what we've already done with
the curves.
We're going to build on top of that.
And what we're going to do is we can select Color Wheels and Match.
Now, match is there.
I don't use it that much.
I really don't use it that much.
But color match very briefly is where you match one.
Clip to another and that say you bring in a clip that you want to emulate.
That's how you do it.
You were coming to Chloe as a match and go to comparison you.
All of a sudden, you got side by side.
And this is the current as in what selected.
I could select that and go to here and that's what we'll be selecting and working on.
But we're not.
We're working on this.
You see how current is changing.
So that's where I play heads.
But what we're looking for is a reference.
Now, this is black.
And why is that?
Well, that's because this is reading from the rest of our sequence, and the play head is right at
the beginning.
So let's drag it through.
And all of sudden, you see, okay, so we're looking through where we were at before.
Okay.
So let's say this has the colors.
Right here that I want to emulate.
I don't.
But this is how you would you would do it if it was a shot of people.
Usually face detection turned on because the exposure and the colors of someone's face is most important.
But there's no face here.
So let's turn off face detection and say that's our reference and we want to apply that color science.
It very rarely works, by the way, but sometimes it's the only option.
You've got to get started on a correction.
But let's say this is the color that we want and we want to effect this.
So this is in a current and this is our reference.
And if we apply match, it's done nothing because it doesn't really work.
Adobe lifted this and pushed it out so much in in years gone by and it doesn't really work.
Some people may get it to work.
It doesn't really work for me.
It's just a confirmation.
Let's just toggle the color wheels, a match off and I'm.
So this is the matching of it.
Turn it on again.
I mean, it makes it a little bit darker, but nothing really like not all.
So yeah, that that does nothing nothing at all for me.
So I'm going to undo one do keep on doing until everything goes back to normal.
There you go.
Just redo.
This is what it affected.
It didn't really do anything for me.
And the way to get out of comparison view is either to tuck a loaf here, which is where we where we
put our button or just click comparison view again and get rid of it.
However, colour Wales is something completely different and as much as it's something we can use.
So we have three things here.
You may have seen something similar to this.
Yes, you have.
Because it's in creative fun, the shadow tint and highlight tint.
What we have now in the colour wheels is we don't just have the shadows and the highlights, but we
also have the mid tones and is still effectively the tinting of these.
So next to each wheel you'll see a slider.
Now this slider is exposure.
So it's the exposure of the shadows, the exposure of the mid-terms, the exposure of the highlights.
Well, we've already dealt with exposure of shadows and highlights before being basic correction.
We've got shadows here and we've got highlights here.
But this is where we can just deep dive a little bit further.
So say we wanted to bring the shadows down.
Okay, cool.
We can do that with this slider and you see how everything gets darker.
Let's just turn all the meta scopes again, so I'll undo that.
Just so we can see more confirmation, I'm going to get rid of the IGP Parait.
Just so we've got the main factor scope, which is the waveform.
I'm going to bring down those shadows and you can see here, everything's starting to get crushed.
Good, good, good.
That works as expected all the way down.
And it's just.
Yeah, it's not great, is it?
So let's undo that.
I'm just going to bring them down a little bit.
Reason why I'm bringing down a little bit is because I want to affect the shadows.
So I'm then to bring them down because the shadows show up more when they're a little bit darker.
And remember the orange until we were talking about, okay, let's try it.
So let's grab this little crosshair and drag it a little bit towards orange.
But if I turn this off in other parts, the difference that we've made and then I'm going to do similar
with the highlights again, I'm going to bring them down just a little bit.
We're coming off the top here on do see how we're all the way up here.
Kind of bring it down just a little bit.
I'm going to drag the highlights a little bit towards the blue.
Not too much.
But if I undo and then redo.
You'll see around here the highlights here, the highlights here, and the highlights mainly around
here if I undo and then redo.
You can see that we've changed the highlights towards the blue part, but we've not affected anything
else.
And that's where these colour wheels can really come in handy.
So okay, that's the shadows and the highlights, what we do with the midtown's well, let's just turn
them all the way up.
Maybe not.
But you see what you can do.
You can bring up all the midtown's.
This is the exposure, the midterms all the way up.
But we're not really washed out.
In fact, if that was the look you're going for, that's how to achieve it.
Let's bring it back down.
Down again.
Now, looking at that now in comparison and let's compare it to the original.
Okay.
Maybe he is a little bit too dark, but if we went in here and brought up the exposure, it would bring
up everything.
Obviously wouldn't bring up that much, but it brings up everything.
So if you go back to the color wheels and just bring up the midtown's that can compliment everything
and can bring everything where we want it to be, to want to change the color.
Well, let that see.
You can always undo, maybe want the mid tones over towards the magenta.
Or we have.
Maybe we don't.
Or maybe you do.
It's all your call.
This is all as a personal preference.
But you see in bringing those midtown's where we've affected is right the way through the middle here.
If I undo you.
See how that's just gone here?
Watch this area here, which is the midtown's, which this has a lot of, because it's not necessarily
highlights, but it's certainly not shadows either.
But if I bring these midtown's up, watch how this splits.
Keep an eye on that.
You see how all the greens and the blues are kind of going down and the reds are coming up.
All the colors just separating.
It's almost like that paint on the separating out into their different colors.
Or they're finding different parts within the color spectrum and within the the the exposure of those
colors.
And they're representing in a completely different way, not just on the original, but as you can see
on here, which is why using one of the scopes is so handy, because you can see in the actual clip
what's happening, but you can deep dive or really see what certain colors are doing with in the waveform
as you affect.
And it can really help, especially if you don't have a color correct monitor because say your monitor
shows predominantly green and you are then moving things away from green because you think, oh, that's
a very green image.
But actually, in reality it's not.
This will tell you.
Yes.
Okay.
There's a lot of green here.
Maybe I chose the wrong color as an example, but this is quite a green look.
It's quite a green scene, as it were.
There's a lot of green in it.
But if you had an overly green cast of a of a screen and you thought, right, okay.
I mean, it depends.
You may be watching this on a on a monitor that's really quite green.
But you can you can see on here.
And if you're not looking here and you didn't have this and you're trying to get away from green, you
could pull it over here.
And maybe that looks better to you because you've got the midterms away from green, because that's
what your monitor is telling you and that might look right to you.
But if you look on here and you realize just how much blue is here, and if you're looking on a green,
a monitor, you're not going to be seeing blue here.
You're going to be seeing something as if it looks gray.
You can see here that it's not it's kind of like a pilot who is flying in complete mist and fog.
And he's using or he or she is using their instruments to show them the reality.
You show them their global position, show them their altitude and their and their speed.
That's what you're doing here.
You're using the tools within Premiere to confirm what you're seeing.
And you would always trust this over this.
Always trust this.
Over this.
Because on your monitor, maybe blues show more green.
Well, you can still see that some color is wrong.
And if you if you weren't certain that that was real blue, you could right click and go to your parade
and you know that it goes right green blue B and you can confirm.
Okay, that is that.
Yeah.
And it's far too much.
So we need to kind of back out of that a little bit, in fact, quite a bit.
Let's bring it back towards the center and all of a sudden this desaturated little and this comes more
not not down but closer to the other colors.
Because what we're trying to avoid, especially when we're trying to show something almost as a as a
as an accurate representation, we don't want one color to overpower when in the picture.
No, not one color overpowers.
Makes sense.
I think it does.
You may have you may have realized by now I doubt myself a little, but you should always I know I come
across as doubting.
I don't doubt myself.
I question myself because that's what you're doing in in in production of a video is while you're questioning,
you're looking at an idea and thinking, is this the best it can be?
Is this the best representation?
Is it the best?
Is this the best way of showing?
Is this the best way that my footage is emulating the music?
Well, I can be absolutely certain after questioning myself a couple of times if I come back here and
I forget I mean, forget about how bad the footage is going to look color wise now.
But I know that this bit here oh, it is my favorite, but I know that this section right here is the
best representation of that music.
Open flames and a good char on the food being served.
I know that.
But the amount of times that I questioned myself.
Until I got to that point.
You should always be questioning.
And with color.
Oh, that's just personally, I love the color of that.
Now, I think it just looks I think it looks lovely.
However, I have now noticed something that I'm not happy with, so I'm going to go and change it.
And that is this is supposed to be great.
And while I don't really mind it, I don't like the fact that it looks a little bit magenta.
So how do I change that?
Well, we go into curves, remember?
And we want to go to Hue versus hue.
Exactly.
We don't want consequences saturation because A to take color saturation.
But then again, do I because it's supposed to be gray.
So maybe that would be the easiest way to get rid of it.
Well, let's try hue versus hue first.
See how it is is blowing is towards towards the purple.
Let's see how that affects that.
If I pull that down.
Why do I want to take it?
Well, that's the problem.
I don't take it anyway.
I do.
I turn it to a different color because it's supposed to be gray.
So that's why I want hue versus saturation.
And I'm going to color pick this area because it's a bit darker.
And that's showing as blue now.
Okay.
Maybe not.
Maybe.
Let's pick it over here.
Okay.
But is showing blue.
So maybe my eyes are a bit off.
Again, I have a 100% color correct monitor, but maybe my eyes are off because I've been staring at
this for so long.
And that highlights what I was saying before.
You need to take some time away.
You need to step away or at least get someone else to bring their eyes.
And you can say, listen, does that look a little bit magenta?
But then you've got to be careful of the power of suggestion.
So then rather than then dialing in the color with your question, say, what color does that look like?
Now what I want it to look like is a kind of gray which gray sits in.
Gray can sit in the in the in the area of blue.
If you think of battleship gray, it's it is a hue of blue.
It's like a dark desaturated blue.
Not all gray, but this kind of gray is.
And the military is telling me that that's what this is.
So, okay, I will take my my instruments as at their word and say, well, if you're telling me that,
that looks gray.
Bluey Well, that's the clue.
I want it to be so.
Okay.
I will.
Rest assured that that's what that color is, but always come back and check because you just never
know.
But yeah, maybe I am happy with that.
Maybe I just don't realize that I'm happy with that.
Maybe I spent far too much time playing with the curve, so I don't really know where I'm at.
You see how you can.
You can spend a lot of time and a lot of effort in playing with the colors.
And you still not really too sure if you're out where you want to be, which is why you should always
start with some kind of correction.
That's if you're shooting in Sydney or some kind of luck profile.
If you're shooting without the picture profile, you've got imagery that comes through and it looks
saturated enough.
You don't need to put on an input.
Look, you don't need to correct it with a lot.
You can just start.
Or if it's shot absolutely perfectly and you're happy with it, you don't even need to come in to hear.
Not many people will tell you, but you don't always have to color correct your footage.
Sometimes your footage is just correct as it is.
But if you need to, you know, there are a whole load of tools in here that you can work with.
One part we're not going to look on is our secondary, purely because I never use it.
I think it can really overcomplicate stuff, and unless you've got footage that is really, really bad,
you're never really going to need to be in here.
It's just it just for me, it overcomplicate the whole process of of color correcting and video editing
in general.
It just it overcomplicate everything.
What I will show you very briefly is vignette.
We all know what a vignette is.
Do we?
Okay, I'll show you.
I hate the white vignette.
However, I do quite like the dark vignette.
Love that.
This, for me looks like a 1980s wedding album, but this can make something really quite nice and moody.
I'm not really going to use it for this.
These are actual projects.
But just to show you, if I take it all the way down to minus three so I can kind of show you the extremes.
If we move the midpoint.
You see how that brings in the vignette?
Let's bring that all the way down so you can see.
And then the roundness will affect that vignette.
Seahorse and we've got vertical bars here.
None of this is ever supposed to be used for the extremes.
But then again, if you see that round there, that almost looks like an old Sydney camera now, but
and then you can feather it so it will feather over in.
To it.
So you've got literally no feather and that does look almost like an old Sydney film, or you can feather
it out, so you almost have like a touch of it.
What I would do personally if I had to look like all these to take them back to Santa.
If you did want a vignette of some sort, I'd probably bring this down a little bit.
I'd take the midpoint, maybe a little bit further in the roundness.
I would possibly leave where it is and then feather it slightly.
If I toggle on and off that vignette, you can see the difference it makes.
I've not made a separate section on that, just purely because I don't really see the need for a vignette.
But if you want if you're looking for that effect, well, there it is for you.
Next up, we're going to be looking at graphics and getting text in here.
And with that, it will help us finish up our video.
Obviously, we're going to go back in because we need to sort out the core and I need to show you that.
But at this point, we're going to move on to graphics.

## 14 Essential Graphics
### 1. Essentials Graphics Tab & Creating Text

Okay.
So time waits for no man.
And and we push.
We will be looking at other ways to to play around with the color and all of that, as we did in the
previous section.
But right now we're going to look at graphics and essentially the essential graphics panel or tab.
It's actually a panel, the thanks shield, an essential graphics panel.
And that's what this is.
Yours look a little bit different because I've downloaded a few may come up with with here and good
this is what we're starting with if you don't have this go to window and make sure that you check on
essential graphics that come somewhere around here.
So what is the Essential Graphics panel?
Well, it it's something that's been updated in recent years.
And it used to be just the text element within Premiere Pro.
But as you can see, if I scroll down here, some of these you will have some of some of them you won't
but and some of these are actually things that I've made up.
But what they are essentially so for the puns are they're animated kind of how do we say this?
What the term I'm trying to avoid is.
MCGIRT Which I kind of shouldn't read do because that's what these are Emoji T, which stands for Motion
Graphics Template.
And that's what these are.
And we will be looking at these in depth in a little while.
However, what I want to do is I want to get to edit and what I can't do is I can't get to edit without
creating something first or dragging something in, and I'm not going to drag anything in yet.
So how do we get around this?
What we're going to do is we're going to put some text on screen.
So I'm actually going to use these clips or this clip that we're up to so far.
And I'm going to you're going to know what I'm going to do right now.
I'm actually getting rid of all the limit three on there that we've played around with.
I'm going to just add my corrective lit contrast, maybe a little bit.
The shadows could happen with that.
See how quick that was when you when you get used to it.
And I drag this out a little bit because I want a bit of time to play, but so what we're going to do
is we're going to put some text on screen and and simply going to write pizza.
How do we do that?
Well, the shortcut is to see how that changed.
If I press V, that goes back to my selection tool.
That's going to Adam editing.
That's better.
Thank you very much.
And what I just did then was I switch between the selection tool, which is the arrow and the text tool,
which is this and as you may have seen here, that switched between the two.
Another shortcut rather than coming up here and clicking that and then going there, we can just literally
hit T and we ready to text now to get text on the on the screen.
You can either check a box and say that's what I want to be typing in or you can you just click and
start typing either way, as you may have seen here, let me just press escape and control and set the
minute that you click in here with the type tool or the text tool is the text or type.
It's the type tool.
Well, remember, it will create a graphic on the next free track on video.
So let's bring it to where we want it to.
Come on.
Maybe they'd say here and I want to write here and I want to type pizza.
So and I've clicked in here and I'm just going to hold down shift press p that I said said Hey, I know
I can spell I know you're impressed and if I press v now, this is the only time where this may trip
you up.
I press v now I'm not going to go back to the selection tool.
I'm going to type V in here, obviously.
So to commit this, your text in there, this is very this is the same kind of shock that you have in
the likes of Illustrator and Photoshop, but escape will literally commit that.
And now, although you can't necessarily see that anything's change if I press V, it actually selects
all of the parameter of here.
But in doing it, it's gone back to the selection tool because what it's done is it's rather than being
an a type tool, it's going to selection tool.
So what can we do with this?
Well, let's not have this selected right now because let's not overcomplicate anything.
But did you notice something there?
You see that?
That the anchor point is down at the bottom.
Where we've seen anchor points before.
We have seen them.
Here.
There's an anchor point.
Hmm.
What does that mean?
Well, it's quite simple with text.
Your anchor point will automatically be placed bottom left of the text.
So that means if you're dragging out high, it comes up from the bottom left.
That can always be changed.
But by default, that's where Premiere Pro does it.
Now, that is one way to change the size of your your font.
But what I want to draw your attention to very quickly is just down here, because that is your font
size.
That has the same effect.
But what we're doing here is we're actually scaling up the font rather than scaling up the graphic.
The reason why that's important is because quite often you can get anti-aliasing and whether you know
what Anti-Aliasing is or not, you will have seen it.
Let me just bring this right up.
Let me see if we get any.
We won't get any now.
You just you just mark my words.
We will not get any.
No, of course we won't.
Anti-Aliasing is something that you get with with vectors.
Pay no attention to how I got this up here, Will.
Well, we'll show you shortly, but.
And I'm setting out the.
The best, best practice, so you don't ever really have to deal with it.
And Anti-Aliasing is something that you get with vectors and a text graphic is a vector.
It's just a collection of shapes.
And what you can get is, rather than a nice smooth curve around here, you can get stepping down like
straight lines all the way down.
And it looks awful.
And it's not round and it's not smooth and it's not sharp.
That's why we can get with anti-aliasing and quite often that is when you scale up a an already.
I don't want to throw terms at you, but an already raster ized vector, so an already committed and
finalized shape.
And when you then scale it up, it's almost like when you when you zoom in to a picture that's not great
quality, you're then going to start getting artifacts and noise and pixelation.
So best practice is if you want to scale up your text, you use this bad boy here either using the scale
or, you know, by now, double click to take it.
Double click.
Double click does not work in font on the font slider.
It doesn't work.
Oh mark that down.
Didn't know that.
See always learning but it defaults at 100 not ten Adam at 100.
And you can scale up or down from here and you can also type in that say 200 boom.
It's twice the size.
Good.
What do we want to do with this?
Well, first and foremost, let's get it.
Let's get it.
The font and the size that we kind of want, because different fonts are different sizes by default
and there's no point placing it where we want to place it and then losing, having to move it again
once we then change the font.
So I will go to one of my default fonts which is no esta.
I like no I a nice font and we're going to scale this up ever so slightly.
Pizza.
Good.
And then we're going to bring this down here.
Okay, that looks nice.
Let's play that back and see how it looks.
Good.
Now, what you're probably already noticing is the fact that because this is created as a clip, effectively,
it's a graphics clip.
This very much like an adjustment layer or an image can be as long or short as you want it to be.
So with that in mind, when you click when you click off a graphic, by the way, when you come back
to it, you don't have all the information that you had before or in the edit tab.
And we need to click what we actually want to change and then we get everything else good.
So what we then want to do with that, I'm actually quite happy with that placing right there.
However, if you wanted to place it along the bottom or in the middle or at the top or center center,
all these things here will help you with that.
This.
At this medal and center.
Well, it's very similar to this and this.
However, those will affect once you have more than one graphic, you can align them all to the center
or distribute them all.
If you've got more than one, it will give you the option to distribute.
But we're not touching that right now.
So we're here.
Now, what else do I want to do with this?
Well, I'd like to stretch it out slightly.
So I'd like to take out the kerning ever so slightly.
That looks good.
Looks quite Italian, doesn't it?
And what else do we want to do?
Well, we can do loads of stuff.
We can actually bring it up or down within itself.
And that is dependent on if you have different lines and you want to really space them out or you've
got text on different lines within the same graphic.
But just for here, right now, I'm quite happy with all of this.
You can really play around with all these, by the way.
Obviously, you'll be familiar with Left, Justified, Centre and Right and this.
If you ever worked with Excel, you'll be aware of these which are just fly to the top.
Just face the centre and justify a line to the bottom.
So what else can we do with this?
Well, we have a fill, which is white.
But what should we change it to?
I actually quite like the white colour, but just to use a different colour.
We've got two ways.
Three ways to change the colour so we can click into what the fillies and we can select our colour just
like we did with the colour mattes.
So we wanted it to be grey.
Fine.
We've got it updating as we go.
So we want it to be red.
We could come down to here and there is red.
So that's one way to select the colour.
Another way to select a colour would be to if you're working for a brand and they have specific colours,
they could give you a hex coat and it could be 60, 60, 60, which is a grey.
However, 60, 60 is a really I love this colour.
It's one of my favourites.
It's almost, it's almost like a teal.
So we're going to go with that 60, 60.
I love that.
And it always shows you what the colour was and what colour you're selecting.
Good.
So that's done.
What else can we do?
Well, as you can see, Phil is ticked, but nothing else is.
So we can add a stroke.
Hmm.
Before we do that, by the way.
So I did say there was three different ways to choose a color.
You can also use yep.
The color picker.
And we could go around here and we could pick a color that's within our.
Project in the clip.
Oh, we go for that one.
Good.
So that's another way to be able to color pic.
I'm not.
I'm using that because I really like that.
So let's add a stroke.
So that adds a white stroke all the way around.
It looks quite nice, doesn't it.
We can adjust the thickness of the stroke or the.
Yeah.
In pixels.
So that's ten pixels of a stroke.
We can also add another stroke and we could say we wanted this to be red because we've got the that
the different colours of, say, the Italian flag.
We could then stretch that out even further.
Give me that and see.
All of a sudden we've got one fill and then two strokes.
What else could we do?
Well, we could add a background.
Boom.
Done.
Where did I add that background to it?
Added it right behind the text.
However, it's right up against it.
Remember clicking in there?
We need to click into edit as well.
So what can we do with this background?
Well, first and foremost, it's set at 75%.
We could change that to 100%.
So it's a full block color.
We could scale it out a bit.
So it covers the whole of the actual word and gives us a bit of room.
We could also change that color so the background could change to say, white almost looks like a pizza
box now, doesn't it?
And now that we're doing this, you can see is it sitting correctly within itself?
Well, this is where this alignment would change that.
No, it was it was sitting absolutely, perfectly so happy that you're moving up.
Okay.
So we've got absolute straight corners.
We could round the corners a little, make it a little bit more, I don't know, a little bit softer,
a bit more fun.
And finally, still within just this graphics panel, essential graphics panel, in a text, we could
add a shadow.
So the shadows added to the text.
Let me just take that off and back.
There we go.
Maybe take up the opacity or take down the opacity, as it were, like bring it more in view and then
we can blow it more.
We can move it around.
So move it around first.
That's the distance.
And then we can blur it a bit and then we can add that blur.
There's so many options.
I mean, look, I know I may sound a little bit sad here, but the text panel used to be absolutely
awful in Premiere Pro.
But as you can see, just with a few clicks, you can mix it and it looks really quite smart.
So with that all set, just I'm going to have a little look back.
And what do I want to change?
Well, very little, other than you see how the red stroke is so thick that we don't really have the
hole in the P and the A.
So I'm going to bring that stroke back a little bit.
Just.
There we go.
Not too much, but just.
Yeah, that that that looks good for me.
Now, if I click out, I just want to show you this roll.
Please don't ever use this.
You can, but please only use it.
Well, no, I don't want you to use it, but I'm going to show it you anyway.
You see how that moves?
Because it's like this.
It looks awful.
The only time you would ever use this would be, say, if you're doing credits.
But I will show you soon.
There's a much better motion graphics template to be able to do credits, which is free within Adobe
Stock, and it's much better than that awful effort.
So with that in mind, we have pizza right there and.
Right.
That's it.
So what else can we do with that?
Well, we can make it longer, just like this.
And this beats.
I like that.
Good colors.
And of course, we can fade in and out.
So we hold down shift to our crosshair.
This is a real shock.
I love this.
And let go.
And they hold down shift.
And because we've held down control, we only highlighted the ends of the clips and we shift.
We've added our default transition and now beats.
If you haven't got hungry so far in this whole course, then I'd be very surprised.
Just for the record, that pizza was absolutely stunning.
So those are all our things that we would like to do or at least want to do with our essential graphics
by adding text.
There are so many different things, as you can imagine, that you can do with this just purely because
of how it's all set up.
But remember, this is effectively a clip.
So you know how we had role going up there?
Well, let's size this down a little bit and let me just show you what we can do with just a little
bit of thought as to what we've done before.
Is that picture interest?
Yeah.
Well, let's see.


### 2. Animating Text

Now.
I said at the end of that section, does that pique your interest?
But you already know the title of this section, and that is animating text.
And we're not going to spend too much time on this because you already know this.
You already know how to animate this in, and that's by using keyframes.
Now, just a little point here before we click into edit, we have these transform capabilities.
If you click in, you still have them.
They're just in here.
And you also have a line.
Now we can align to center there, can align to middle.
If you want something absolutely dead center, you align both of those.
And if we bring up our save margins, you can see the height is right the way through the center there
at the middle there on the center right there.
But we don't want that.
So how do we move it around?
Well, because it's selected, just like in motion, with an image, with a clip for an image.
We can bring this round and track around here.
And it's affecting here, but it's not affecting here.
See how it's not moving that well?
That's fine.
I just want to highlight that to you.
What we're going to be doing is we're going to be animating this.
But as you can't see here, there's no stopwatch.
So we can't keyframe any of the things here.
We could only keyframe them here.
So for best practice, what I would do is I would place this where you want it first.
And safe margins are a really good way to do that because although we now don't have four three, because
that is the old style of video used to cut down and cut down there.
What we have here is safe margins.
Now, you've seen these so far a couple of times.
What I need to draw your attention to with this is that these don't just help you with center the they
are giving you what are safe margins.
So anything that you want to put on top of video you normally want to do inside this first box.
The second box is it's almost like a yeah, you really don't want to go beyond here if you really want
to push it.
Yeah.
Okay.
Got to here.
But you don't want to go beyond here.
Into here.
And that's for a couple of reasons.
Firstly, depending on the device that whoever is watching this is on, they may have the aspect ratio
set to zoom rather than default, which sometimes crops in a little.
And you want to ensure that something's not missed.
There's nothing worse than watching a piece of video and some text comes up and it's kind of like there,
you know, at that point that you're missing something.
And then from that point on, you'll know there might be a lot that I'm not seeing and you don't want
your audience to be feeling that.
So what I would do is, yeah, okay, this is that safe area, but I always allow for playing in this
area as well.
So ignoring that in a box and just at least staying true to the outer box, that's what I do anyway.
But again, this is all up to you.
It's completely up to you.
It's it's however you want to do it.
A couple of little things to bear in mind when you are moving things around here like this without having
to track around on the slide here.
Once you start moving, you can move freely, click and drag if you want to move it or you want to keep
it in a certain position, you can then hold down shift.
Watch how this snaps.
If I'm coming down away from where it was originally and I press shift, hold down shift and I can't
take it to the right or left.
It stays on the y axis or the vertical axis controls that one.
Do that.
If I start pulling it to the right or along the x axis and then hold down shift, I now can't take it
down.
It's really quite intuitive thing within most of the Adobe suite and it really helps to ensure that
you are in a certain alignment that you're looking for.
So where do we want to put this?
I'm actually quite happy with it up here.
And we're going to have pizza animating.
Argh!
Now, as I said, we've placed it where we want it correct this align and transfer form, but the motion
hasn't changed.
So let's do something.
We actually have it on a crossfade.
I think I'm going to bring that back, but let's just get rid of that transition for now.
So as always, click on that transition and then press delete doesn't do anything other than the actual
crossfade.
So it's on.
So now let's set a keyframe at the beginning for the position.
So we know how to do that.
We have effects control.
If it wasn't on this, if it wasn't actually on effects controls, we'd highlight it to effects controls.
And then we're going to drop a keyframe right there.
So we're toggling on key frame.
So that's done two things at once.
Started, started the keyframe in process and placed the keyframe right at the beginning or right at
the point of our play head.
So I'm going to drag on a little bit maybe just to about here and I am going to drop another keyframe
and then I'm going to go back to the first keyframe.
And where do I want this coming in from?
Well, let's say I don't want it coming from the top.
I want it coming in from the side.
So that's this value here.
Again, we could grab it and drag it along.
But as you can see, nothing has changed here.
That's why I highlighted that at the very beginning.
With regards to graphics, you need to be really aware of what value you're affecting when you move
something, because what you'd expect is that we set the keyframe that sets keyframe here on this keyframe.
I've tracked it off, so surely if I press play, it'll automate in, but it doesn't.
And that's because I've moved it within this area and not where we're actually keyframe.
So that's Control and Z to bring that back in and we need to bring it off.
There we are.
All the way out.
Way out.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Just that good.
So we press play.
And we brought that in.
Now that comes in a little bit fast, but also it comes a little bit unnatural.
And what we're going to do with regards to the easing.
Going to track that out a little bit and.
Okay.
That now takes far too long.
So maybe somewhere in the middle.
Now I'm going to use my cursor and find somewhere better to finish this transition.
We're going to hold down shift.
I'm going to press right once for five frames and write again for another five frames, still holding
down shift and maybe another.
So I'm going to do it for 15 frames so I could delete this and create another one.
Or I could just grab this key frame and bring it into the let's just check if I if I'm happy with that
timing.
Yeah, that's good.
Now let's make it a little bit more natural so I could tilt it.
In fact, I will, just so you can see it better, but you don't have to.
I'm going to select this first keyframe right click, and I'm going to temporal interpolation and ease
out.
And then what do we do with this one?
Temporal interpolation.
Ease in sometimes ease.
And these are already there for you to play with.
Sometimes you have to go into temporal interpolation.
It's I've never noticed the reasons why.
Sometimes it's there and sometimes it's not.
Maybe someone knows, but I don't.
So let's just check that and see how that feels.
There we go.
See how it slowly.
Yeah, I like that.
It's more of a yeah, it's more natural.
But now with that, I think it needs a little bit longer to come in.
So I thought, right, that's where I want it to stop.
So I'm going to track that keyframe up to that play head now, and I'm happy with that.
But it's not just pizza.
It's pizza time.
So I want to make another one.
But I want to say time.
How do I do that?
Well, you know how to duplicate.
That's easy.
We just hold down alt and we drag up.
Now you can't see anything because they're both the same.
But there's now two versions.
Of pizza on the way, but I wanted to come down here.
So pizza and time underneath.
So I just need to grab this.
No, I don't.
We've keyframe this.
So if I get to the end here and drag the second pizza down here, why don't I want to do that?
Well, because that looks all fine, right at the end of the day, keyframe the movement.
But if I start to go backwards, we're now on this second pizza.
And let's have a look here.
What value is this first keyframe?
Where do you reckon this is going to go back to?
Is it going to go straight back like the first one?
Or if you're ahead of me, you'll know it's going to start moving diagonally.
That move, that is move him back up to the position of the first keyframe.
So let's undo that control and set.
And what we could do is we could clear all the keyframes and we could move it down.
But the easiest way is to come up to here and change where this is.
So now all of a sudden, an element of this that seemed confusing and why can't you do that has actually
really helped us because we don't really have to do anything else because now.
It goes back straight because it's moving in position relation to itself.
We've just offset the position in this area, makes it a lot easier, much, much easier.
So let's change this text.
How do we do that?
Well, we go to the type to either press T on your keyboard or click type.
And we're going to change this text and we're going to say it's pizza time.
So t I am a Oh, that's not how you spell type.
And because this is all left justified, we've stayed lined up here.
That's why you that's why you need to think about how your text is going to be justified right at the
beginning.
If you're going to move on and add more to it and you and you need to know where the text is going to
be aligned in relation to or the text.
That's always a good way.
If you if you're if you sent to justified and you move it all over to the side and then you bring in
another piece of text.
I mean, if that's if that was the case with this, all of a sudden you're off and then you're going
to have to do a whole load of changing.
So I'm happy with that pizza time.
However, what I want to do is I want to move this up a little bit.
So the weights, there's no break between the weight.
Yeah, I'm happy with that.
Now, you may also have noticed that when I was in the editing of text this box, you see the box,
it's all red.
That means that we're in editing mode with the text.
The minute that we click out, either by pressing escape or switching to the selection tool, it goes
to blue because the blue will no note to you that we're in a transform setting rather than editing of
the text setting.
What do we do now?
Well, let's go back to the beginning and see how that feels.
Pizza time.
Good.
Happy with that.
However, I want them to come on different times.
So how do we do that?
Well, we could move these keyframes.
I'll show you the long way and then the easiest way.
So both these key frames, these two key frames, and if I click on the other text clip the key frames
at the same time.
So what we could do is we could offset.
So let's play and maybe say we want this to start.
Time to come in, just as Pete says, finishing.
Well, we know that that's where the key frame is for Peter because they're on the same line.
So we could just grab these two and we could drag them off a bit.
You see how time goes out as we're doing that.
So let's start at the beginning and play that pizza time that works.
But we could do it easier as visually on the timeline because we know that the key frame starts right
at the beginning of this clip.
So all we need to do really is let's drag along to see where pizza comes in.
Ignore time for now.
And I kind of wanted to start just as pizza is almost all the way in.
So now on time, by the way, if we look here.
What is written in the text comes down on to here, so it's easy to keep track of what's actually happening.
Let's grab this and let's just offset it to there.
That's the beauty, again, of the snapping, because we can snap to the play head.
And that's where I wanted to start.
So we go back to the beginning and.
Pizza time.
Let's get rid of these safe margins for now and.
Brilliant.
Now that's animating the text then.
Do we want to animate the text out?
I think so.
And lets animate them both at the same time.
So what we could do is.
We could.
Keyframe them both to go out at the same time and set a keyframe, a set of keyframes for both of these.
But there is an easier way and it's first off, we need to commit that we're happy with this, although
we can always change it if we're happy with the way that they come in, which I am, and we're happy
with the duration that they're on the easiest way.
And brace yourself with this.
We nest to import.
We nested a while back.
We set up a nest.
Let me recap that for you so you can nest one clip or more clips.
What we want to do is we want to nest these two clips.
And the reason why we want to do that is because we can then treat them both as one object to get them
out easier.
So I'm going to select pizza, hold down, shift and select time.
This could easily also be done by drawing a marquee and selecting both.
And my shortcut is PN to start a nest.
If you haven't set that up, don't forget you know how to do that in your keyboard shortcuts.
You can right click and select nest.
What this then does is brings you up a dialog box where you can name this nest just like you could with
the adjustment layer and also with the climate.
And we're going to just put in here pizza text and click, okay?
And now we have both of those.
If I double click here, this opens another tab along here.
We haven't done this before, another tab along here.
And it only contains these two elements, which are the two graphics clips, pizza text.
So I'm going to excel at that.
Don't forget, if you have to something, you want to reopen it and it's not on your timeline.
Look right here, that is a nest because it's a it's a it's its own sequence, as it were.
If I zoom this up a little bit, you can see that right there.
It's a sequence.
Just like if we double click into sequences, we are here with our pizza oven sequence, which is this.
Now you can if you want to drag that nest into sequences.
What I quite often do at this point is create a new bin and cover nests, and I'll grab that and just
put it in there.
Now, if you don't do this or you miss doing this once and then you carry on and you make a load, it's
quite difficult to keep track of.
So the easiest way to keep track of it is to add moving a nest into a bin as part of the nesting process.
It's almost like you do it naturally.
I would love again in a future update from Adobe to have an option to create the when you create your
first nest for it to create a bin in the project in the project folder called Nest and to put that first
nest into that bin and then subsequent nest that you create to automatically put it into that bin.
Maybe I don't know why they wouldn't do it, but yeah, I would like them to.
So now we have this nest.
What are we going to do?
But it's really quite as simple as the first animation.
We're going to bring that and then we're going to start the animation from here.
But let's get to the end of the clip and obviously the text is out because it's not here.
But let's set a position keyframe and now let's go back holding down shift.
I think we did 15 frames.
So let's go five, ten, 15 and let's set a keyframe there.
And now what we're going to do is remember when we go to that last keyframe, because it's the end of
the clip, you currently see it really quite frustrating because it's gone off it.
So I'm going to come back one frame, I'm going to Tilde this in and let's get this keyframe, just
put it on there for now.
And then what we're going to do is we're going to grab the position and we're going to move it off.
All both act together happy.
So now we've got pizza time coming in and then both of them going out.
You know, we're going to do next.
Of course you do.
We go to add right click tempo interpolation and ease out.
And the opposite on the last one.
Temple interpolation ease in also.
This isn't right because the clip doesn't have to be.
But I want it to tilt out and let's have a look at that.
Great.
So that's your animating text.
Animating text is just like animating anything else for movement.
In Premiere Pro.
Really quite simple.


### 3. Adding a Colour Matte and Building On Text Animation

So we're now going to take this one step further, and I'm going to show you how to bring in other elements
to complement the text.
The thing is, there's a much easier way to do what we're going to do, but I think at least showing
you how to do it yourself will really improve your knowledge and build on your knowledge of this area.
Our Premiere Pro, but it should also help you in your appreciation of it.
Once we get to that stage, so I'm going to get rid of this ness.
But before we do, I'm going to stop us having to do this all again.
So I'm actually going to select pizza and control and see it's going to copy that because I want that
element, but not the nest.
So I'm going to select the nest and delete.
Now if I just paste what's in my clipboard, now I've got v one selected so watch what happens at the
play had control v and it cuts through that clip.
And so effectively what we've done is for the length of we've got the pizza text, then we press play
and we just have that on screen and then we have that back.
How do we avoid that?
Well, first and foremost, we could put it here first and then copy and paste and then drag it over,
which is normally what I do because it's much quicker.
Or we could toggle off V one and then control v and it will aim for the next available track which is
v two.
Either way is fine.
Just be aware of when you're pasting things onto a timeline it can quite easily overwrite.
You could also, rather than just toggling that off, you could just lock that that whole channel,
the whole track and then paste and it'll go into there.
Whichever way works for you is fine.
Just don't overwrite what we've already got and what we're trying to work on.
So what do I want to do?
I firstly, I want to get rid of this, this whole animation.
So we talk a lot the animation and obviously it will say this will delete all keyframes.
However, note where our play head is and it's halfway between those keyframes.
But if I press okay now with my play head here, I now I'm stuck with it at this position.
That's no problem because we're going to be moving it around.
But just be aware that if you do delete or toggle off your keyframes and get rid of all those keyframes,
whatever you're animating will be left at the point in which it is in the animation.
Depending on where your play head is.
I don't think that's a bug.
I think that's intended or it's just something that has been in from the very beginning of Adobe and
they haven't changed it because editors have got used to it.
Really, it's just as simple as that.
So what are we going to do with this?
Well, firstly, let's just reset the position.
So we're back up here and I'm going to bring this down just a little bit.
I'm going to put it down here instead, which is effectively what is known as, ah, almost dead on.
It's effectively called in the industry a lower third.
Now, if you ever watch any any news channels, any documentaries, anything that has someone speaking
and they want to bring up their name, you'll normally see their name and maybe the title, their title
like in an organisation down here, down either the bottom left here or the bottom right here normally.
And that's called the lower third because it comes up in the lower third of the screen.
If you imagine this was cut into three.
So there'll be a line right the way through here and the line right the way through here, which would
break it up into thirds, one, two and three.
This is always in the lower third.
Take that little bit further.
If I bring over my rulers, my marker, my guides even, I'd say that's probably a midway between this
line and the bottom, maybe a little bit further down.
So that, again, is in the lower third of the screen.
That clear?
Good.
So we're going to bring up we're going to bring this text in now as a lower third, but also with a
column that we've played with column outs before.
We're going to take our knowledge of column maths a little bit further.
Let's just get rid of that and let's get rid of that for now.
And because we're going to be using a column mat, we don't need the background that we've included
on this text.
So to get rid of that, we just go back into pizza because we've got this highlighted.
Back into pizza because that's what we're editing.
I only to scroll down and get rid of the background, so I'm just going to toggle that off.
That's all on its own now, doesn't it?
So there's a text on its own.
I'm also going to edit this text to have pizza time all on one line, so I might as well have it all
in the same text file.
Text clip.
So I'm going to click back into pizza and select my type tool.
Don't forget, shortcut is T and because this is a line to the left, I know that when I text it, when
I add text, it's just going to come out here to the right.
So if I go to the click in and go to the end and hit space and hit time e pizza time.
We're happy with that.
I'm happy with that.
I'm going to scale it down just a little, actually.
There's a number of ways we can scale down.
Remember, this is effectively a vector, so we can scale down here, but I prefer to scale down true
to itself.
And remember, if we click, if we go back to our selection tool, our anchor point is right down here.
So whatever we do with regards to scale is going to be reflected from this anchor point.
So we can scale it down just by here and bring it down this way, or we can scale down with the font
size.
It doesn't really matter.
I'm actually going to scale down with here just to make sure that we absolutely have the quality in
the vectors that make up the text.
I don't think that really matters these days with regards to the Anti-Aliasing, like I mentioned before,
because it doesn't really seem.
To pick slate.
It looks as clear as a clear as a bell for me.
So I'm going to use this just easier because this ladder is virtually all the way over here now.
So this just makes it just a little bit easier.
I've got a little bit more room to move, so I'm going to bring it down to, let's say there.
And because our anchor point is right down here at the bottom left, we know that that's not changed
within our safe margins.
If I told them back on, we're still within this safe margin, good.
So now what I want to do is I want to animate this in, but I want to animate the background before
it for it to sit on.
That's why we couldn't use the background in here, because the background sticks with the text.
So instead, I'm going to bring in a white color match and we're going to play around with it.
So it actually fits with this so I can animate in the color matte before pizza time comes in.
How do we do that?
Okay, well, first off, I want it below the text, so I need to make space below the actual graphic
on the timeline.
So I'm going to shift, I'm going to click and drag this up and I want to put a column up underneath
here.
So how do we make a comment?
We go back to here into our project area and we have a new item and color match or as you know, right
click new item, color matched.
And the settings are as always exactly what the sequence settings since we don't need to worry about
that, we just now need to worry about the color the default always picks is black, the blackest of
blacks.
If you ever watch Father Ted, it's Priest Black.
What we want is white, whiter than white.
So let's select that and hit.
Okay.
Now in After Effects, and I've mentioned it number times for and after effects.
When you make a color matte, it's called a solid in after effects.
And whatever color you pick, it kind of chooses the name for you.
So say you've chosen kind of maybe a hue of light blue.
It will come up light blue.
It doesn't do that in Premiere Pro and I love it too, because the amount of times where I do a color
math and I do it quickly and it hit okay, and I go along and I have like four or five color match in
here and they're all labeled color.
But I know it's you've got to, you know, you can easily do it yourself and that's what I'm doing.
But I would much prefer for Adobe to go.
Yeah, okay.
That's a white color, white matte.
But once again, until they do, we've got to do it ourselves is okay.
And as always, with everything that you create here it is now in our project bin.
So we can click and drag this in and just like it would with an image, we are set with certain number
of frames that it's there for.
However, we can make it as long or short as we want.
Okay, good.
So let's make it as long as the text that we've done there not to show how long we want it.
But as you can see, the problem here is that we're now face for the full white screen.
It's a bit too big, isn't it?
So we need to size it down.
There's a number of ways we can do that.
We can scale it down.
But as you can see, it keeps the aspect ratio of 16 by nine because that's the sequence it was made
in.
So we could scale it down and we could either use these or we could click motion and bring it down behind
it and that kind of works.
Then we could use the grab these handles and move it out.
But again, that stays correct to the scale.
We could turn off uniform scale.
In fact, let me just undo and undo.
We could turn off uniform scale and then we could really size it the way we want it to.
And that would work.
In fact, that does work, but there's a number of other ways we could do it.
So I'm going to that's one way you could size your column and there's another way, and I'll show you.
Now, let's just undo all of that.
And this is the way I do it.
And I don't know why I do it this way, but this is the way I've learnt so this is the way I kind of
keep and the first and foremost what we want to do is want a crop.
So we go to effects and we go to our crop to remember we've done that before and we grab it and we drag
it.
Nope, not there.
Although that's correct.
Because the matter is selected again to make sure that we're dropping onto the right clip.
We drop it onto the actual climate and now we're giving the dial up for crop.
So I could just go straight ahead and I could start dragging in and making sure it works with this.
However, there's a little there's a little way of helping you at the.
Point.
And to do that, we want to kind of see through this white mat just for a moment to be able to see where
we are with the pizza oven footage and with the text.
And for that, we're going to go back into our effects controls and deal with something we haven't dealt
with before, and that is opacity.
Now, the opacity on any track shows at 100% by default, it's showing all of it.
However, just like with these values for position and scale, we can grab this and start to drag it
down.
And as you can see, that affects the capacity of the white mat that works with everything.
Let me just select that and press zero to disable that color map for now.
And if I click into the video clip again, we still have opacity.
We can turn that up and down.
So you can set the opacity of what you want.
That's quite often helpful.
If you're if you want something that is quite opaque and you can see through it just for a time, or
you're trying to effect an adjustment layer, which, again, we'll deal with very soon, actually in
another in another section, just a little bit more on adjustment layers.
But what I want to do is I just want to affect the opacity for the color match right now.
So that's currently disabled.
I'm going to select it and press zero to enable it.
So we now have our color math at 24%.
So now we can see where we're at.
With regards to the video.
We can also see obviously where we are with regards to the text because the text is on top of the white
mat.
So with the crop tool, let's just start sliding and see where we come up with that.
Happy with that?
And let's bring it in from the right a little bit.
If we give it a little bit of room around there.
Yeah, I'm quite happy with that.
We can we can see that right now.
We've got effectively a lower third.
It takes up that bottom corner and we've got.
The text right on top of it.
So going to bring back up the opacity now.
Now that I'm happy with that crop and boom.
Now what I want to do is I want to bring this column up in from the left hand side on to animate that
in first and then pizza time.
I want to animate it.
Now, the beauty of using the crop is that we don't necessarily have to move this column at all.
I need to do is I can animate the right crop from the beginning to 58% where I want it.
So rather than animating and keyframe in the actual position of this white mat, all we're having to
do is keyframe the values of the crop effect that we've applied.
Let's do that now.
So I'm going to go right to the beginning of the white mat.
I'm going to toggle on keyframes for the right crop.
And if I drag along a little bit, I'm going to set a keyframe there.
Now, if I go back to the first keyframe and the crop is currently at 58%, what does that actually
mean?
Well, if it was at zero, it would be all the way because there's no crop.
So 58% is 50% of the distance from the right in a cross from right to left, effectively.
So what we want is we want this all the way over to here.
So we're cropping 100% from right to left.
Can't go any further.
100 is that the the maximum you can crop?
So then we set the keyframe where this keyframe is set, we want to set this keyframe as he's out and
we want to set the second keyframe as he's in.
So now we've got the crop animating from left to right from 100% right to 58% right, which is all we
need to give us that.
So now that that's done, I'm going to grab my pizza time and I don't want to animate it from this point.
So let's see, I want it to start coming in somewhere around here.
So I'm going to drop a keyframe here for position.
But I don't want to affect this movement yet.
I'm not going to drag it all the way because that's my finishing point that I want.
So let's play this little bit and save there.
That's where I want pizza.
Time to finish.
So I'm going to create this keyframe.
I'm going to go back to the first keyframe and let's drag it off the screen just off happy.
So you know what we do right click and temp interpolation and ease out right click temporal interpolation
is in and that should be all we need for this animating in both the climate and the text.
Good.
Doesn't kind of work exactly how I want it to.
I think maybe we need to start the Pizza Hut a little bit earlier.
Now we're right at the beginning with our key frame.
Or are we?
Maybe not.
Let's take it all the way.
Let's see if that makes any kind of difference.
Uh, not really.
In fact, it makes it take longer.
So I'm going to undo that.
And I'm actually going to drag this clip, which not only drags the timing of the clip, but also with
regards to the timeline.
These keyframes will sit in a different place.
So have a look.
Good.
You know what I actually want?
I want pizza.
Time to land at the same time as the crop finishes.
How do I do that?
Well, I click a click into the column up.
I get to the finishing part of the keyframe, and that's where my play head is now, without moving
my play head.
If I click into the text, I know the difference.
If I still do this, I can see the difference of time between that's when the crop finishes and that's
where my text finishes.
That's why it doesn't look quite, you know, as nice as it could do.
Let's maybe bring it a little bit closer.
Maybe not.
Maybe not the minute that the color stops cropping, but maybe just there.
Let's see if that makes a difference.
I like that.
Looks good, doesn't it?
Pizza time.
And then we can animate it out just exactly the same as we did before.
So how long do you want it up?
That's probably about enough, isn't it?
Good.
So we're going to drop a key frame here and then we're going to play.
And that's when I want the pizza timeout.
Isn't it great that you're literally watching me and you know exactly what I'm doing?
So I'm tracking this top position value and drag it out and I'm happy with that animation out.
Good.
But I'd like the crop to start coming back before pizza time is all the way out.
So let's say bye bye.
That's where I want that to start coming in as well.
So if I leave my head that it's going to the climate.
I'm going to set a keyframe.
Good.
And then I want this Klamath to almost chase the text so they're almost both off at the same time.
So if I drag my play head along, that's when the text is almost out.
That's when it's completely out.
If you take one more frame and that's when I'm going to complete that crop all the way to 100%.
Let's see how that goes.
See how the white chases it because the time the the yeah.
The time that the pizza time text takes to get out is longer than the color.
But so effectively you don't have the color match chasing it back out.
Good.
I'm happy with that.
It's one more thing that could make this look maybe just a little bit nicer.
And that is to add something to the color mat.
Now, what does the text have on it other than a fill and a couple of strokes?
It has a drop shadow.
And I like that.
And I think a drop shadow on the color mat would also look really nice because a column, a drop shadow
on the color mat would actually cast a shadow behind that the color mat.
So we'll actually be effectively round here.
And I think that would just just give it a little bit more oomph.
Let's see how it looks.
So we go back up to effects into here and type in drop.
There's our drop shadow.
Drop that on to the clip that we wanted on.
Already looks better, but it's not a similar shadow to this.
And I want to match this shadow.
How do I do that?
Well, we take, as you can see, in effects controls.
We've now got a crop effect and a drop shadow effect.
And what I said at the beginning, that you could add loads within effects control is just a one instance
on your timeline and it can really you can really build on this.
So we're going to take the opacity all the way up to 100%.
It's now a solid black line.
And then what we're going to do is when the offset the distance rather than the default of five, I'm
going to see how if I drag that up and down, it offsets that distance to maybe take it to about, let's
say 13, 13 works for me.
I'm going to keep that direction because I think that the direction is right.
See how if I move that round, it's like it starts twirling around.
That's the direction that the light is coming from.
And then I'm going to really just give this a load of softness, subtract that out, and they go, boom.
Now, you'll have seen so many graphics on TV that have a drop shadow and maybe not notice that it's
called a drop shadow.
But if you look at this and let me just turn off the effects for the drop shadow, you see the difference
that that makes not just here but also around the top here as well.
A kind of putting on a drop shadow almost gives it validity.
It says, yes, I'm here.
And because I'm here, I am.
I am affecting that around me.
So I'm affecting the clip by casting a small shadow on that.
I think Shadows drop shadows using graphics at the right time can have just a lovely effect.
So let's run that all with the animation.
The text on both the animation and the color match and the drop shadow on the color match.
Let's have a look.
Let's go from right at the beginning of that clip.
And there effectively is a lower third easier that isn't it?
Next section, I'm going to show you how to do that in, well, a quarter, a fifth, maybe a 10th of
the time.
But at least for now, you know how to do it yourself.


### 4. MOGRTs in Essential Graphics

So we've done our set up for text, we've animated in our text, we've given it a background and we've
done all that manually.
Now it's time to show you how to do it in just a couple of clicks.
The reason why I've shown you how to do it manually first is because I think it's important to know
how things work.
And I think a lot of tips and a lot of technique that you've learned in that section will help you for
so many different elements within Premiere Pro.
But as with everything in Premiere Pro, there's a number of ways to do things.
With varying degrees of success.
So we're going to go back into our essential graphics panel and rather than editing what we've already
made.
Let's go to Bruce.
Now you've got you'll have different things here.
These are a few things that I've downloaded in the past, but if I scroll down, you should have these
things right here.
And these are the Adobe Stock Motion Graphics templates, and these are a few that I've made for clients.
And this is something that I made, I think, for a client.
I think I made that.
Or maybe that's no, I think that's actually Adobe's and this is the one that we're going to play with
right now.
However, we have a problem and the problem is we have this warning sign up here which is T and that
says what that says is that there's a problem with the text.
And the problem is, is that there's a font missing.
So this uses a font that we don't have now in years gone by, that was a real problem because in Adobe
you were only allowed to activate a certain number of fonts at any one time.
They changed the policy quite recently, and now you can activate as many fonts from Adobe Fonts as
you like as long as you have the subscription.
So that's what we're going to do.
I'm going to size this down a little bit and I'm going to get rid of the time we had left by, and we're
going to grab this what we want right here.
Don't forget, we've got a search bar up here.
You've got a local templates folder.
These are all my local templates.
So these are the ones that I've downloaded.
These are the ones that I've already got from Adobe.
We also have libraries now.
We're not going to deal with libraries here because I don't really have much of a library, but we can
go to stock templates and that would be the stop templates that you've downloaded from Adobe Stock should
you wish to.
And you can look in Adobe Stock by clicking on here.
Now within Adobe Stock, you can also select whether you want free or premium.
A premium is kind of how it says and you can get ones that you can pay for or you can just look at the
free ones.
And these are all free motion graphics.
There's only.
What page?
One of nine pages, the sixth on this page, and we can click along and see all the different ones.
This is changing all the time.
So there's nobody here that I actually haven't seen.
And we will deal with these in a little bit.
But first and foremost, we're going to get a little bit more simple for now, and we're going to uncheck
libraries and we're in my templates.
So these are templates that I've already got done.
So as I said, we're going to play with the lower third, which is the basic lower that can sort of
be.
There we go.
And we're going to grab this.
I'm just going to drag it on to see how it comes on.
It's slightly bigger size than we normally would.
That's because Adobe has decided that this is the it's the length that it wants to default, that it
doesn't have to be that length.
Just like with any kind of graphics, you can have it as short or as long as you want it to be.
But what this comes in with is a default set up for you.
And remember how we were looking at the time.
There was one line here, well, there's now two lines here, so let's click on them.
So your name here and second line is smaller.
That works with it's actually in upside down.
I don't know why that is.
It's a bit annoying, but let's click in your name here and now we can affect what we want, but bear
in mind that these square brackets or parentheses mean that it's a font that isn't currently on your
system.
There's a real problem with the GOP funds and it's ongoing, and I think they're trying to sort out
the fixes.
But this has been like this for quite a number of years now, because I do have myriad in my system.
If I go up here and the Myriad Pro is right there, if I click that, it actually changes because what
it was doing at first is it was put it was emulating some kind of font, but it thought it was.
But it's not just be aware of that, because sometimes it can really trip you up and it can if I did
nothing.
This is the font that it would show in my clip, and I'm not really happy with that because that's not
the font I want.
But the beauty is you can change to whatever font you want.
So I'm going to go to no Norwest because you know how much I love Nor'easter.
So now we've got that in the font that we want.
We can click into the second line the smaller and we can do that with that.
If we like, we can change the font.
But I'm alright with that being that font.
So what can we do from here?
Well, as you can see, if we click into the first one, we have the same things available to us, like
we had with just one graphic, but it's just now stacked because we've got more than one element of
graphic within the same graphic, so we can change the film.
So let's change the film.
In fact, let's not.
I'm quite light, quite lightweight.
So we had a stroke.
Yeah, why not?
It's at the stroke to set that color.
Maybe set it to read.
Can hardly see it.
Should we size it up a little bit?
Okay.
Maybe a little bit too much.
I'm happy that your name here.
Boom.
You had a second stroke.
No, that's not for this.
But this other background, they see that that background is only affecting that text.
You see, what you bring in from Adobe is set by Adobe.
It's set by the elements that they've created with the lower third.
That's why I think it was really important to show you how to do it yourself first.
Just in case you can't necessarily find exactly what you're looking for, you can build that yourself.
And again, just like with the other one, we can change up at the background size, start up a little
bit, maybe round the corners, and if we click out, we can see boom.
We've got that.
Nice.
Now, say you want to leave the white as it is, B, can't quite see it.
Well, this again is where having a shadow is really helpful.
You can just literally boom.
And okay, that's not necessarily exactly how you want it, but we've added the shadow so we can now
edit this.
And I can tell by looking at it that it's actually the distance.
That's a little bit off because the size of the text is so small.
So let's track down this distance a little bit.
That's a little bit better, isn't it?
And so we blur a little bit.
Uh, more.
Just a little.
That's nice.
That's good.
So then if we play it, boom, we've got our lower third already pre-made for us.
And then it goes off.
Now you know how to animate this.
We can easily just set keyframe right at the beginning position.
Set another keyframe there.
Go back to the first and maybe we have it coming in from the bottom.
So will right click and temporal interpolation and it's out.
Tim Pawlenty ablation he's in and now we have.
Nothing looks amateurish, but okay, that works.
So that's how to effect motion graphics templates that you've brought in from Adobe.
There are so many other ones you can do as well.
Let's get rid of this and let's have a look at maybe bold credits or titles.
Let's bring in the ball credits.
So that's, again, just on screen.
But as you can see, there are so many different.
Versions that you can play with right here.
But there's one thing that you can see from that you can't see right now.
But if you look a little bit closer right here, we have some form of key framing and that is a fade
out.
It can add a transition fadeout as default.
So what this does is if I highlight this and go to source site effects controls even and select this,
you can see what does that mean?
Well, that's actually already put a keyframe in opacity.
And we were playing with opacity before.
If I go to the first keyframe, it's at 100.
If I go to the second keyframe, what's zero?
So this is actually added a fade out.
But what you can't see unless you look right here is there's a difference in the color.
And actually, if we look if we tilt on the the effects controls, there's a lot going on here.
What's this?
Well, I'll show you what this is.
It's already animating in all of the text and you'll recognize this text.
This is the kind of text that you get at the end of a trailer for an upcoming film.
See now all that is already done for you.
To do that yourself, you'd be.
Oh, you'd be getting all the different lines.
You'd be setting your key frames and dragging them off.
And you'd have to do that for each and every line you've got there, which you got one, two, three,
four, five, six, seven, eight lines.
You'd have to do that and offset them.
And it's done for you.
Yeah.
Okay.
The spacing isn't quite exactly right, but if we click in here, I'm pretty sure.
Yeah, it's not got the right font in.
So if we go and we find the right font, which is Babar Nu, which I know is in here, you may have
had a beep a little bit earlier.
That was because Adobe recognised that I didn't have the front and it added it.
And you always get told, oh, we've added your font.
Brilliant, thanks.
Didn't really tell that.
Just do it.
But yeah.
So that's now showing the right font and this is what's really important.
Whenever you bring something in, you need to check that the font is being shown on the actual fonts
because as you see as I'm going through this, even though it says here that it's Baba's new regular,
it's got these square brackets, a square parentheses around them.
So we just need to go in and just mainly go through and select each element and just confirm.
Yep, that's the font I am using.
Oh, so you don't have to.
You can use whatever you like, but this font is correct and this kind of effect that you're looking
for, which is the film credits, looks great.
Good.
Let's delete it.
You can't be precious about any of these.
And there are so many different types of motion graphics here.
Now let's have a look at some of the more in-depth ones.
And for that, we go to Adobe Stock and we've still got free up here.
And here's one edgy modern transition for video.
And if you scrub through just like we could with the images, with the video over in here, remember
when we say into our footage and we're on our thumbnail, where's that gone again?
Videos and we've got them maybe sized up a little bit.
You can pass through and have a quick view of what that clip is.
Well, we can do that just as easily in here.
Might take a couple of seconds, depend on your Internet connection and to load a cache of it.
Maybe click on it.
Yeah.
Oh, that's handy.
That's changed.
You used to just mouse over and it just start a whole load of animation, just like you do in here.
But you actually got to click on this and.
Yeah.
That's good.
That's quite cool.
Should we use that?
If you look here, by the way, you can see that these two shapes are coming in and that text is come
up.
But right here, this is black.
And what you can't quite see.
Let me see if I can size this up.
Yeah.
Okay.
That's really big, but at least you can see it.
Uh.
And it wasn't that way.
But it looks like it may be an alpha channel, which means there may be nothing.
I want to point out something else in this clip, but let's get it down.
So to get it down, you can do a couple of things.
You can either click here to license and download.
Just like with music.
Like I said before, you need to get a license for everything that you're using.
And even though it's free, you need to attain the license and buy by downloading.
That automatically generates your license to use it.
So we can either click that or we can, just as if it was on our computer, click and drag it into our
timeline.
So now we have a new motion graphics template to work with.
So what can we do with this?
Well, let's have a quick look at what's going on, because as you can see, once we highlight this
and got it in selected, there's a lot going on in the effects controls.
Let's tilde this and have a quick look.
Maybe it'll the right thing.
Well, there's a lot going on.
I mean, like, there's keyframes here in opacity.
There's keyframes here on opacity.
If I scroll up.
Okay.
It looks like there's mainly keyframes on opacity, on different layers.
There's more on opacity here.
If I'm looking along here, scrolling down, you see how much there is here?
Look, there's keyframes on position here and there's different speed graphs that we've played with
before.
That's linear, but that's not.
What is the.
That's a busy curve and that's been set for you.
There's a lot that's already been done for you.
Imagine if you had to keyframe each and every these each and every one of these things.
Not only that, but being able to visualize what you have to do to get what you want to achieve.
If I just twirl up all of these, these are all.
There's one, two, three, four text properties there.
There's then another.
There's the shapes.
There's.
It's just.
It's just.
It's.
Yeah, there's a lot going on here.
And all you had to do was drag and drop it into your timeline.
So let's see what it does then.
Let's track it right to the beginning and let's play.
And then we animate out.
I looks good.
Like it?
I'm going to bring it for the full.
Just to correct.
And be to the same length of time as the clip.
And that should.
Because it's all automated.
Yeah.
So it's affected the different length of time that things work because it's been pre-made.
If I drag it out, you see how this stayed the same.
This stays on for a little, for much longer, and then it starts animating.
I love it.
Like this dope.
You've really stepped up the game because the motion graphics, especially the free ones.
Okay, so what we want to do with this, well, there's a load we can do with this because we can see
each and every part of this motion graphics template is in here.
So what we're going to do, let's start changing the text.
So what we want to do, we want to make it correct to our video.
So let's say we want.
I'm going to I'm going to stay correct to what they're doing, which is all lowercase with a full stop
at the end.
And I'm going to say a pizza.
You see, also note that there's different colors here with regards to the full stop on the actual text,
and it'll be interesting to see what we can change with that.
So let's go pizza.
Toppings.
It.
See, I'm just literally clicking in those text and just editing them as if they're on a word document.
And our hashtag is going to be.
Pizza time.
That works.
However, our colours are quite right.
I'm not happy with the colors.
Should make the colors correct to what we had before with the time.
Yeah, let's do that.
Okay.
Blue rectangle.
What's that?
Well, the easy way to see what that blue rectangle is.
Meaning is if we toggle on and off the I.
Okay.
So that's the that's the blue rectangle on here.
What color do we want that to be?
I think we want that to be.
I'd like it to be white, actually.
But I can see the problem that we're going to have the minute that we change it to white because pizza
time text is also white.
But we'll deal with that.
So let's set it to white and press.
Okay.
Now, pizza time has disappeared.
Well, we can bring that back because we just go into pizza time and we're going to change the color
of the text.
The fill is going to be black.
Maybe.
Yeah, that'll pop out for good.
Happy with that?
Well, good.
Cool.
Let's move on.
Let's go back to the top.
And I like these bit to text in white.
Not too sure is is the color of the affected within here.
If I highlight that full stop and come down, here it is.
So you can change the different colors of text by highlighting them and changing them within themselves
so you can have more than one color in a text part.
And what I want these to be, what do I want that background to be?
I think what the background to be that green.
So then let's say red.
So going with the red, white and green of the Italian colors.
So if I want that red, I'm going to go for this to be like a green.
Like a rich green.
Want to do a little tick of tip here?
In fact, I want to show you two different ways.
I'm going to just commit that.
And if I click out.
But green is set.
Good.
Okay.
I want to do that again with this one.
But if I go into the colors, if I highlight that come down, going through the colors, probably not
going to easily find that green again.
And it's not going to be quite right.
Well, a couple of ways we can do this.
We want to change that, Phil, which is that full stop.
We just grab the Eyedropper Tool.
Go over to that green and pick it and click and out.
And those are now the exact same green.
However, if you know you're going to be doing that, which is what I thought when I was doing the Peach,
and I thought, Oh, which way did that do first?
If we go back into here and highlight this text and come down to the color.
And click in the color because that color is picked.
We have a hex code and we're told by hex cos before a 6060.
Well it's highlight that and control and see that's copy that to my clipboard.
So all we now need to do is go here and highlight that full stop, click in the color and click down
here.
Control A To select all that text control V to paste on top of that and look its pick the exact color
we want boom done out.
Good.
Let's keep going.
I want to effect this purple now.
I'm assuming that's the dark purple background.
Nicely labelled and we want it at the rich rate.
So that's come down all the way to red and look how it updates on here.
So we can kind of see I think.
Yeah.
I'm quite happy with that red pen.
Happy with that?
So what color could this be?
Well, this light blue could be white if we wanted it to be a white.
Yeah.
It doesn't look as good as I want it to.
Or the color.
Could it be?
It could be this green.
And bear in mind, we could color pick that green or we still have it in our clipboard so we could select
color control the again, there's a green boom done.
I like it.
I also want to change this hash in the hashtag.
So let's select that.
And I want that also to be the same green.
So again, scroll down.
It's currently set to black coming to here.
Paste in our hex code.
And okay, I also want to size that up.
I've still got the hash highlighted.
It's just changed that size just a little bit.
Good.
I'm happy with that.
Let me just draw your attention to a couple of things.
Looking at this whole graphics template, a MCGIRT Motion Graphics template.
Look at the couple elements of Drop Shadow.
We have a drop shadow underneath here.
Right on this button.
We also have a drop shadow on here.
And the reason why I feel best drop shadow is on here is to create a bit of a drop shadow on.
The element below it to kind of lift it up a bit.
It really adds to the effects, doesn't it?
If I go to the dark purple background, which is no longer dark purple, it's actually dark red.
I can right click and rename it so I can make it more correct.
So let's say that dark red background and a light blue background is now a dark green background.
So we do the same with that.
And we don't have to do this, but just to keep everything nice.
And that's going to really, you know, make us put a space in between the two worlds and turn it around.
Place.
Good.
And if I go into the dark red background and I scroll down, you can see that the shadow was actually
created here.
And to show you the difference that just that one little drop shadow makes.
Wow.
Let's play that without the drop shadow.
Okay.
It looks all right.
But I think that drop shadow.
Just it lifts it.
It gives it almost more of a 3-D effect.
It's not 3-D, obviously, but yeah.
Let's put that, doesn't it?
Pizza toppings eat pizza time.
Just turn your attention to the amount of things that are animating here.
So if we scroll through slowly, first we are greeted with the green, then we are greeted with the
red.
So those to establish what's going to come.
Just like we had with the white background that came up with pizza time as we scroll along.
So pizza fades in.
As does toppings, as does eat.
And then.
Pizza time with the hashtag.
Skrulls in.
That's obviously a motion keyframe.
And as we scroll through, once it starts, everything then goes in reverse.
So the pizza time button.
Animate out, we fade from bottom to top.
And then we animate out the bottom layers.
So everything then goes in reverse.
Now, how could we then level this up a little bit?
Well, what we could do is we could affect what's behind it.
Because as you see, although I think you'll agree, this looks great.
The problem we have here is that we can't quite see.
All of what's on the video.
Now we could just move it over.
We've done that before, haven't we?
Highlight the text, move it across with a position and that looks great, but that only really looks
great.
While this motion graphics template is on there, once it animates UDF.
And the problem then we have is the fact that we're now showing black bars to the side because the video
is off to the side.
So what we can do is we can build on our knowledge of our key framing.
So this is exactly where we want it when this comes on.
But let's drag it to a point where it's not where we want it because the motion graphics template isn't
onscreen.
Okay.
There.
It's at that point, isn't it?
Because that's where we can see black hair.
So let's use our arrow keys on our keyboard and just press right once.
Okay.
That's.
That's kind of.
That's good.
That's all covered.
So I'm going to set a position keyframe right there.
And let's go back to the beginning.
So let's press up to go to the beginning of that clip and let's just press reset.
So that's now where the clip is in default.
So let's add some time interpolation.
So let's right click and ease out, right click and ease in and let's see if that covers.
So tilt it out and play.
It goes a little bit fast, doesn't it?
And at one point.
We're still to the point where.
Yeah.
We go a little bit too fast.
So this all takes a little bit of jiggery pokery and playing around.
Let's drag that key frame up a little bit, so give it a little bit more time to move.
If I go back a little bit, okay, I've still got a bit, so I'm going to make this path just a little
bit.
Longer.
Okay.
That's not going to work.
So let's bring this.
Up here.
So the first keyframe actually doesn't start the beginning, but starts just a little bit.
It's almost like the movement of this motion graphic will then dictate this moving.
Happy with that.
That looks good.
Now I need to do that reverse for when it goes out.
And I'd say we probably want to start moving.
The minute that that starts moving.
So that's yeah.
Start moving once.
So let's hit a key frame there.
And I want to be I want to be moving at that point.
In fact, I kind of want to be back by that point.
Let's see how that looks.
No, that's a little bit too fast, isn't it?
Let's tilt it into here.
Let's split these key frames a little bit and see how that works.
Okay.
That's too long now, isn't it?
So we need somewhere in the middle.
Maybe if we started moving earlier.
And have that.
As you can see, it's a lot of playing around that started even earlier.
Almost like the video anticipates the movement of the motion graphics template.
Good.
It's a little bit fast.
So let's track that out a little bit.
That's now taking too long.
See how you need to really understand where you want to be.
And actually, I actually want to be back by that point because in a couple of frames time.
See between those two frames is when this corner becomes uncovered.
So let's say I want to be back by then.
So let's snap that key frame to here.
Let's go back and back here.
Frame is there.
Let's play that.
Yeah.
It's all right.
I want to kind of ease into this, though, because it's not easing in.
Let's see that.
Okay.
Maybe just a little bit too much.
That's.
Ease out.
That's.
Okay.
That just it goes a little bit too early for me.
So that's.
Let's say there.
Mm hmm.
Almost for almost their track on that keyframe just a little bit.
Uh, I think we just.
We missed one frame, don't we?
Let's go back.
It's just there.
Isn't that?
You see the tiny little micro adjustments that you need to make sometimes just to make them work.
That works for me.
I like the.
Great.
Love it.
So that's how to do this so quickly, so easily, in comparison to what you actually have showing on
here.
And and imagine the amount of time you would need to take to then be able to do this.
Manually.
And it's all done for you.
But knowing knowing how to build these, or at least knowing how to build the elements that go into
this.
Help you to understand just what you need to do to edit them in the way that you want them to be.

## 15 Further Colour Correction
### 1. Multiple Clip Colour Correction

So now we're going to revisit color correction because we're now going to build up on the knowledge
that we already have with regards to this part of Premiere Pro.
I would normally delete this, but I like it too much, so it's just it's going to be that over there.
That's it's really pretty.
So I'm going to meet these channels just when not playing back any audio.
Let's have a look at all these clips and.
Yeah.
None of those have been color corrected or do no one that has been color corrected, don't we?
And that is this clip, because we color corrected that in the color correction section.
So if we.
I'm just going to duplicate this clip.
I'm going to come back to here.
And let's go to color and let's get rid of that key framing and reset it back to here.
So that's color we like.
And now what you need to do is you need to make a note of what you've put in and the changes that you've
made.
And these are only joking.
You don't need to do that at all.
This is now set with a color correction that we're happy with.
So what we want to do is we want to copy all the settings, this clip to the other clips.
Easy, isn't it?
Well, if you remember, there was another shortcut that I had you do right at the beginning, and that
was for P and it was for the shortcut paste attributes.
So that's what we're going to do.
Now, bearing in mind that we corrected this clip, this somewhere along here, but, you know, we
color corrected it for this.
However, that's probably going to be similar colors, but in other clips it may be slightly different.
Now, there's no way to automate that.
But we can have a better starting position than we are at the moment with this set of attributes that
we have here.
And the way in which we do that is we select the clip that we've color corrected and we're happy with
and we copy it.
So control and see.
So that's now copied.
If I just went somewhere else and control a V, that's going to pop.
It's going to paste that whole clip.
That's not what we want.
What we want to do.
Let's say we want to affect this clip.
And just for now, I'm just going to hide the adjustment layer and I'm going to lock it just so we're
not affecting it.
And I want to get the colors off.
This clip and put it on this clip.
Well, I've copied that clip so I can right click this new clip and go to paste attributes or as we
set with our keyboard shortcuts.
Just hit the letter P on your keyboard.
Now this brings up a few options, and sometimes motion will be selected and other elements depending
on what things you've got in the effects controls and what changes you've made to that clip.
You'll have more options in here as to what attributes you want to paste.
Now, obviously we don't want to paste the motion because we're happy with this motion, and sometimes
no motion has been done and no motion is needed in the new clip.
And it doesn't really matter.
But because we've actually added motion to this clip, as you can see with our keyframes, remember
we had a little let me just cancel that out.
And we have a little movement, don't we?
From left to right, remember that?
Well, we don't want to affect that.
We don't to overwrite that with the motion from this clip, which if we had motion checked when we're
pasting attributes, it would overwrite that.
So let's highlight that clip and press again, because it's still not a clipboard.
And you can see that we have an option for the memory color.
Now, if you had, what else have we done?
We've put a drop shadow on things and we've also added a crop.
Anything that would come down here that would also be listed in effects, because to get a dropped shadow
and to get a crop, you go to the effects panel, remember?
So you would have the option to be able to put those in.
But because we only have a color correction on the other clip, that's the only thing that's available.
So let's do that.
It's okay.
Keep an eye on this.
That's our color correction added.
Let me undo control set and redo control shift set.
That's our color correction added.
So we haven't had to make a note of all of these things.
When I first started in first as a color correcting.
I didn't know about page attributes and that's literally what I had to do.
And it was it was the biggest time waster in the world.
It was it was awful.
So that's worked for that clip.
Brilliant.
Now let's undo that, controls that and let's add it to all of the clips.
Easiest way to do that is draw a trace, a marquee all the way around all of the clips in that press
P and hit okay with luminary color selected.
That's obviously done that clip, but it's also done all of the other clips.
How do I know?
Well, we can now click into each individual clip and you now have limit you color in the effects controls.
So just confirm that was before and that's after you see the difference.
If you think back to when you first started playing with this footage, that looks more than acceptable.
Fine.
But now, looking at it with what we can do with the colors, it's washed out.
So let's play it through.
You got more?
I mean, that that with the fire, you can you can see just how much.
That's like color correction does.
And in effect all we've done in this if we 12 these down because remember you can access it from this
point is we've added a bit of contrast.
We've obviously we've added a corrective lit.
We've added a bit of contrast and we've crushed the shadows a little bit.
And the effect is just it's once again, I feel it's just it's night and day.
Brilliant.
Now, let's see, because this scene is lit very similar to the first and very similar to this.
But it'll be interesting as to how that color correction will affect when we're inside the pizza oven
and we're quite dark.
So have a look.
I don't know about you, but I think that's more than acceptable.
Let's talk about us.
Just to say.
Well, it just makes it richer, doesn't it?
Don't be worried about this black bar.
Remember, we have these this box that we've animated in and just kind of check through this and see
how that all is like in that.
Have you seen how the fire pops that little bit more?
It just brings out the the oranges and the reds in the fire and in this reflection down here.
And even the green pops even more on the on the on the lawn.
Those colors are just.
So much more out there now.
That's a little bit dark.
Maybe that is.
Okay, let's let's correct that because it is a slightly differently lit scene, but we only want to
make a couple of little adjustments.
So let's play that into there.
And that is a little bit dark.
Now, we could go to the color, the color tap or color workspace and go down there, limit your color
tap.
But if it's only just a little bit, what we could do is come down here, maybe bring up the shadows
a little bit.
Yeah, that, that helps.
Maybe take up the exposure of so slightly we don't to do too much because we do want it to stand out
like a sore thumb against the other footage.
But.
I think maybe we need to add a bit of saturation there because I think that's what might be lacking
in a bit, that some of that saturation is because that that clip is so rich with the reds and the oranges.
But you see, what we're doing is we're affecting the color correction that's been added.
So we've got a better starting position.
Mm hmm.
I'm going to try and add what I've done to this.
To this.
So how do we do that?
Well, we copy that and we then just paste attribute.
No, we don't.
If we pasted attributes right now, we would add another.
Another instance of limit, you color.
Let me do it and show you.
Keep an eye on the image, obviously, but also keep an eye here.
If we paste attributes and just have them each color selected.
We've gone over the top everywhere.
And we've got a second limit color.
Once again, when I first started, this was something that I just couldn't get my head around.
And it really confused a lot of things because I had eye color.
Correct.
And that I'd make changes to a clip and think, Right, yeah, that's the one that I want.
So then I'd select that copy and then select all the clips and then paste.
And I was adding three or four different instances of Limit your color.
I was just chasing my tail, so let's undo that controls that we've copied, we've copied the attribute
from here.
We go into this, this clip that we want to change.
We select limit you color and we delete that from the effects control of this clip.
And as you can see that's going back to the beginning now we paste so we select and we paste and hit.
Okay?
And now we're at a more acceptable level of color correction if we play the them into each other.
Yeah, that works.
And that works.
That doesn't need to be changed.
I don't think maybe this does.
No, I'm okay with that.
And I'm okay with that.
And then we're towards the last few clips, which we know are exactly how we want how this looks a little
bit dark.
And how does that think?
It looks a little bit dark in comparison?
Yeah, it does.
So let's lighten that.
So with that clip, selected it again into the telemetry part in the effects controls.
And let's just boost that exposure ever so slightly.
Not too much.
Wow.
Doesn't take much at all, does it?
So take it to 1.4.
Whereas Control said it was a zero.
So control shift set to redo 1.4.
Maybe, just maybe, let's take those shadows down a little bit.
And I want to actually want to do this quite accurately.
So twirl down shadows.
And once again we have a slider which we can bring that down.
If I brought it down too much, it's going to.
Yeah.
Say about there.
Let's run them into each other.
Good.
I like that so far.
Really nice controls so we don't lose that.
So that's being able to add one color correction onto all of the clips without having to do them all
individually.
There is another way to do it.
And although I like this way because you can tweak and do what you need to do.
I'm going to show you another way to be able to do that.
And to start that base color correction.


### 2. Using Adjustment Layers to Colour Correct

To do that.
I wouldn't do it.
I'm just going to keep on controls adding because I do this quite often.
Let's just keep on undoing until I want to do until we get to.
This has been a lot.
There we go.
That's right.
So redo.
And that's for me.
Lock the adjustment layer.
So I'm going to unlock the adjustment layer.
I'm going to turn the adjustment layer back on.
So now we have it back where we were.
And this is color corrected.
Now, remember when I said the adjustment layer affects everything below it with a certain number of
things?
Well, one of the things that an adjustment layer can do is affect color.
You can add luminary color to an adjustment layer.
And while it won't affect the adjustment layer, because the adjustment layer is pretty much nothing.
What it will do is affect everything below it.
Let me show you.
So this is the clip that we like, the color of control and see to copy that.
And let's just come to anywhere anyway in this clip.
Let's say I like it when we bring it out.
I like the colors of that.
Looks good, doesn't it?
Okay.
So with the adjustment layer selected and bearing in mind we already have an animated crop on here because
that's what we did at the beginning.
I'm going to type, copy and paste the attributes of the color from the other clip over here.
Press.
Okay.
That's now applied to that clip.
But it isn't that's now affecting that clip.
However, it's actually using the information of the feature color on the adjustment layer.
So with just one paste on one item, that color has been affected everywhere.
I'll show you.
If I press play and I toggle on and off the adjustment there as we play, that's really just one layer
on parts with it off.
That's further down.
That's fair enough.
Now, let's say that you didn't necessarily want the the meat tricolour and the crop on the same clip,
on the same adjustment layer.
But that's easy as control and Z that and that control and that again because the actual undo was to
hide and the hide the adjustment layer and let's keep that limit you colour and delete it.
What I'm now going to do is I'm going to get another adjustment layer.
I can grab the one that's somewhere in there, just there.
But I'm just going to create a new adjustment layer and press.
Okay.
And I'm going to drag that on top.
Stretch out for the full length of the clip and then I'm going to pee and do that and that's it.
Done.
Now, best practice would be to possibly put the crop bars above the color correction, just purely
because the crop bars is to crop everything.
And while you can't really see the color correction through the black, it could affect it.
So we just don't want to take any chances.
So I'm going to start renaming this now, this adjustment layer.
I'm going to right click and rename this top adjustment layer is the crop bars.
So I'm just going to put it's the letter box and it's okay.
And that's now titled In That Letter Box.
And this adjustment layer is color correction.
So that's what I'm going to do, right click rename and that's like color correction.
So now I know which, which adjustment layer does what thing.
So that's the letter box and that's the color correction.
So now what we can do if we need to if we need to change the colors of these, because after we've got
one main color correction going over, everything is we can come back in and change these things if
we need to.
Yeah, it's a little bit of a long way around because we don't already have Lemmy Chocolate and any
of these.
But I'm actually quite happy with that now.
Maybe I was nit picking before was I.
Know that is quite dark.
That's quite dark.
So it's those two clips.
So there's no limit here now because we've not applied any limit.
But if I go to here, we don't need to put the input loss in because the input law is being fed from
this this adjustment layer here.
But I can just brighten it.
If I want to brighten.
In fact, if I bring on the curves, if you look at the bottom, we've got absolutely everything down
to the bottom and we've got the type on the top.
Let me just get rid of the the parade.
And that's because it's reading the black bars as well.
So don't be worried about that.
ABC, everything.
Oh, why is that all the way at the bottom?
That's because it's reading the the the letter box.
But if we bring that up just a little bit, that's way too high.
But let's just undo and undo.
Let's just bring it up a little bit.
We're not put up peaking anything, but we just need to bring those shut us down a little bit, bring
about contrast, I think.
And that will work for me.
And that one let's see if we can give that the same treatment.
So this is the clip that we effected before control C into here.
Control on to P, not even control P.
That's for print and press.
Okay.
That affects that.
And we're done.
That is such an easy way.
To add a color correction to just anything and a full selection of clips.
It's brilliant.
It's a great way to do it.
Moving on and just to finish up this this next section, it's only going to be a short one.
We're going to be discussing master tracks.
It might not be as short as I want it to be, but yeah, I think it's important that, you know.


### 3. Master Clip Colour Correction

So sometimes you may have a project where a an adjustment layer across everything won't do and you need
to color correct.
One piece of footage that is used multiple times in a video.
I'll show you how I set this up to show you to show you another technique.
And to do that, I'm going to duplicate this sequence.
So this is pizza oven sequence 1080.
And we know our sequences in here.
And the sequence has been, remember, were nice and tidy and right in there.
We've got our pizza oven sequence.
1080.
Now this.
Looks very similar to our footage in as much as we can.
Mouse over and through and you can view your footage.
It's exactly the same with a sequence.
All the way through.
Obviously, we're going to black here because we're all the way out here.
But as you can see, that's our sequence right there.
Now, if you ever close down a sequence and you can't find it and you can't deep dive and you've done
a load of things which have created more bends.
I've been in this position a number of times and you can't find the sequence and you know that the work
is there, but you can't find it.
And no amount of closing this or reopening it is going to open it with the sequence open.
The easiest way to find it is if you go down to here.
We're currently a thumbnail view.
If you go to list view, we can actually see it there.
But let's hide it because we can't find it as pretend.
And all you simply do is go into the search bar here.
This search bar is purely for the project panel and it's a sequence.
So you just start typing sequence as E Q and they are all your sequences.
So we've got wood pallets.
What was that?
Oh, that was a nest.
Remember when we nested that?
So that's effectively a sequence.
The pizza text is a sequence.
Remember, we were in here before and that sequence is our main sequence.
Close that, close that.
So that's the easy way to find the sequence if you can't find it.
So here is our sequence.
And when we go back into the thumbnail view, you can see that this is this.
So let's duplicate this.
That is easy.
Just right click and click duplicate.
So it's made another version you can't see here because it's too large and you can't see the text.
But if we go to list view.
And drag out the name.
You can see it's called it pizza oven sequence 1080 copies zero one.
So I'm just going to click in here, single click and then click again or right click and rename.
And I'm going to title this master click.
Example, just so I can show you.
I can mess around with this now it's not going to affect our the sequence quite often.
If you've got clients who ask for more and more versions, you don't want to lose what you've done.
You don't overwrite what you've done.
You make another sequence and you call it number two.
So because it's such a law that you'll get three or four versions down the road and your client will
be like, Oh, actually, in version one or two when the clips did this and this, can we have that
and add that to the latest version, which could be like version 86 and you don't have to do that work
again and you'll never get it exactly, exactly how you had it first time.
So making duplicates of sequences can give you almost like a breadcrumb trail back to the beginning
if you'll allow the the web design reference.
And it will save your sanity, I promise.
So now that we've duplicated the sequence, let's double click into master click clip example.
And just to be clear, that's the one we're working in, not in the pizza oven sequence.
In fact, I'm going to close that so I can't affect that at all.
What I want to do is I want to let's just get rid of these right now.
And I'm quite glad actually that everything or the color grading is going to affect because this is
going to make it a little bit clearer for me.
What I want to do is I want to go into my footage and I want to find a situation of that situation.
24 seconds will use that because it's the longest clip.
I'm just going to delete everything here.
I'm going to drag in this clip.
I'm also going to get rid of that audio because we don't need it to get rid of audio.
You can just press alt to unlink and then just delete that.
We don't need that clip and I'm going to drag it all the way out.
So we've got every bit of it.
And that is that clip all the way through to that.
So now this isn't going to look like it's going to look like an awful idea, but let's say we want this
bit cut that and then we want that bit, but we want a little bit later on and then so that the gap,
the eye maybe that bit that you see it's done that just literally cuts it up and splits it around.
And I'm going to bring in this clip and I'm going to close that up.
Let's bring in this clip and close that up again.
Deleting in-between the spaces by selecting the space.
Put that in there and that in there.
Six and oh that's quite a good one as well.
Six in the.
And seven at the end there.
It's quite a lot.
Now, you'd have noticed that I didn't press Allen unlinked and deleted as I went because I want to
show you this other little shortcut.
If you want to just select one of a pair.
So this is a link to video and audio pair.
You can just hold down alt with nothing selected and select that.
So that's just the video selected.
If I press delete, it's going to delete the video, but keep the audio.
Same with the with the audio.
If I just alt and click and then delete it, just delete that.
But we can take that one step further.
We can hold down alt and draw a marquee that selects all that audio and just delete and it's gone really
handy.
So why have.
Why have I done all this absolutely awful at it?
Well, it's because I want to show you how to apply a color grade to one particular clip.
Let's just say that the pizza oven for it's all color and we wanted to make this completely black and
white.
So every time in this sequence that pizza oven for is used, we need it to be black and white.
Oh, right.
Okay.
Well, we could select this clip and we could go to color and we could just take all that saturation
down.
So that's black and white.
That's not quite how I want it.
I want to maybe boost the contrast to maybe break down the shadows and.
Yeah, okay, that's how I want it.
Okay, so I'll copy that and then I'll go and find the next clip, which is Pizza Oven four and press
P and paste the attributes.
And you could do that.
And to be honest with you, it wouldn't be taking that long if there's only four or five instances of
it in the sequence.
Let's look back in to the metric panel and.
Right up here and maybe actually same Mazda clip example is probably not the best titling because that
may confuse.
So I'm actually going to rename the this sequence and I've done that just so I can show you how to rename
sequences.
And if you believe that you believe anything but must clip example, I'm going to say this is multi
clip example, so I'm just going to rename that just to make it a little bit clearer.
So we're still in the sequence, but it's the sequence formerly known as Master Clip Example and now
known as Multi Clip.
So let's go back to color.
And here we have right here multi click example.
That's the clip within the sequence and that's what we're working on.
However, if we look to the left in La Maitri, we have another title and it says Sauce Pizza oven for.
That's sauce, not the clip within.
The actual sequence.
So if we click this.
We've got all the different options here of all pizza oven four being used and we can affect each and
every one of those if we want to from this point.
However, let me just click back into multi clip example.
Let's turn that exposure all the way up just so you can see that something has been changed.
If I click into source, nothing's been changed.
Why is that important?
Well, because what's done in here is not reflected in here, because this is affecting the actual source,
not the clip within the actual sequence.
So why is that important?
Well, if we bring that exposure back here, not be working in the clip, copy working in the source.
We're now working in the whole of the clip of pizza oven for and now because we are effectively at the
source we call this the master and this is the color master of that.
Piece of footage, not just a clip.
Let me show you.
Keep an eye down here and keep an eye on what you can see.
So this is pizza oven for.
I'm pretty sure that's pizza for.
This is definitely pizza oven for because you can see it.
Let's bring down the saturation.
Let's just make a change to the sauce, the metric color.
What's changed down here?
Let me control, set and redo with control shifts that.
What you may have seen is that we now have a red line under the effects part of this clip.
Not only that, but every single instance where there's pizza oven for.
We have a red line.
So let's bring down that situation again.
That's down on their.
And don't be mistaken, although this.
Is on this you can see pizza of for here but that looks like this color in it and this looks like there's
color in it.
But that's just because the rendering hasn't caught up.
Well, let's play it through.
So there's pizza oven for black and white.
Pizza oven one.
Coca Cola.
We didn't do anything.
We haven't changed that pizza from.
For coming up black and white.
Haven't changed that clip individually.
Pizza, oven to coke.
We've got cola.
That's what we expected.
Pizza oven for black and white.
So what we've effectively done is we've added a blue meat tree collar effect to.
Every single instance because we've affected the source, not the clip.
Look, this is now selected and we're looking at the clip and there's no change.
But if we go back to the source.
Saturation is down now.
We could still make more changes, maybe add more contrast.
You see how it changes it over here.
First, let me just show you that again.
It's changing in the source monitor, not in the clip.
Because it's only when we let go and commit it.
Does it affect this?
Let's bring down the shadows again.
It's showing in the source monitor first, then when we let go, it's affecting this clip and that's
all being done in The Master.
So now if I go back to pizza one, you can see again, nothing on the clip.
But if I look at the source, that's what it's reading from.
And that is such a powerful tool.
If you've got so many clips and so many bits of footage and there's one shot, say it's a shot of of
say it's a wedding and it's a shot that you've done continuously all the way through the ceremony,
and it's slightly oversaturated or ever so slightly overexposed.
You need to bring down the exposure and you've only really noticed when you've got all the other footage
yet around it and you need to change it.
Well, the master track the master edit on the source part of the mitre color can help you do that without
having to go and find every single instance of that footage throughout your edit.
And I promise you, if you had to do that, the chances of you missing one of those clips is quite high,
especially if you've got loads of instances of it.
So using the master track can save you a massive headache and actually, depending on the edit that
you're working on, can save you hours and hours of going back and forth and changing everything when
the master can do it in just a series of clicks.

## 16 Exporting
### 1. Exporting a Frame

Okay.
So what I want to do now is I want to touch on how to get your video out of here before we go any further.
And you're nearly about halfway through this course.
I hope you feel like you've learned quite a bit up until this point.
But what I want to do now is I want to show you how to get your video out or more accurately, the term
exporting.
So how to get anything exported from here.
So the first step that we're going to do is export a frame.
We've already done this, but I want to recap this just to make it absolutely clear what we're doing.
So first and foremost, export a frame.
Well, exporting a frame is exporting an image, a snapshot.
So let's do that.
Let's find somewhere.
Let's just meet these so we don't have this plane back and let's have a little scrub through and let's
see what picture we want.
Actually, before we do, we need to get rid of that master check because we don't want that color grading
I'm doing.
So how do we do that while we select one of them?
Go to color and go to.
Master Member source and let's just reset.
So that gets rid of all those master things and obviously it will reset all that as well.
But our color correction is coming from this badboy, this adjustment layer.
So yeah, that's another great reason to use adjustment layers.
The thing that annoys me is the fact that this red hasn't updated and even though there's nothing changing
to match the source because it's been changed once.
It just does.
But bear that in mind, because that wasn't done in the sequence, was it was done in another sequence.
And now that we've done that to this clip, if we go back to the other sequence, which is in sequences
and we go to multiple of example, all these will now be back to color.
So that's something that could trip you up with regards to editing the colors or anything on the master
track, but just bear that in mind.
Anyway, we're exporting a frame and this actually looks the a good enough frame is any to export.
So bear in mind that this frame currently has those letterbox bars.
Do we want those?
Well, if we're exporting for social media or for a graphic, whether you're doing it on an another
editing part in The Sweet of Premiere Pro, or maybe you're taking up to Canva on line, maybe you don't
really want those baked in.
So let's select the letter box, which is the adjustment layer here, and just press zero on the keyboard
to disable.
We haven't moved this around, so we've got that full frame of the frame to use.
So export the frame.
Well, as you know, there's two ways to do it or there's more than two ways, but there's two ways
that we know of.
And that's either clicking this shortcut here, which lets you says export frame, or we can use the
shortcut that we set, which is C, so just hit C on the keyboard.
And as always, we have the option to put in the name, set the path.
And this was actually from a fluke that my wife and I did quite recently and into our project folder
and into images.
And this is where I want to save it.
Just bring that up so you can actually see it all.
I select that folder.
I'm just going to say that I'm just going to call it fire because that image is fire.
And don't forget, you can import it into the project if you wish and you hit okay.
And honestly, if we've imported it into the project, it will be somewhere in here.
Fire it saved it as PNG because I wanted the highest possible quality or at least the best possible
quality to size ratio.
And if I right click this and go to reveal in Explorer that will then open right there.
So that's the image I've got.
These are all the other images that we've exported out.
So that is how to export a frame.


### 2. Exporting a Sequence

The next way to export or the next thing we'd want to export is a sequence.
Let's just re-enable that adjustment layer which brings in a letter box and we now want to export the
sequence.
What is that also known as?
Well, that's known as rendering.
I don't actually think it's ever referred to in here as rendering.
No, it's really not.
But that's what we're doing.
We're rendering down the video.
The term render comes from cooking.
Enough because we're doing a video on cooking and you know, you're making a sauce and it's all quite
or everything's in there and maybe you've added stock and it's all really quite watery and you need
to, to, to boil off a lot of that moisture and have all of us try and look for a word that's other
than render.
But you do you what you want to simmer that that sauce so it gets thicker and it renders it to say yeah
I can't find another word.
But yeah, so, so we're rendering and that's what a rendering a video is all about.
You render all those parts.
So imagine if we are still talking about cooking.
The music is maybe some of the the salt and pepper in the seasoning.
The voiceover is maybe a few nice spices.
You've got the video, which is the main part, whether that be meat or vegetables or, you know, pulses
and lentils and all of that.
And you've got the color correction, which is possibly a bit of stock on top, just to add a little
bit of flavor.
And everything is in the whole recipes in we are cooking and now we want to render.
So what's the best way to set you up for success is not to just say, okay, let's save that out, because
if we saved this out and we didn't set any kind of parameters, well, that would would render a video
from the beginning from zero, which is where we want.
But there's other stuff in this sequence that we've been working on.
So actually, rather than if we look here and take our play head, maybe to the end of the music, that's
one minute and 21 frames, so nearly a minute and 1/2.
However, the end of this is 2 minutes and 43 seconds and 15 frames.
So actually you'd have a video if we didn't set any parameters of the whole of this.
So what you'd get here would be the better the music there and then total black video up until this
point and then you'd show a little bit of that.
You get to the end of that and then you'd have a whole load of just black video until we got to our
pizza time.
I do like that motion graphic.
That's really good.
And that comes with Adobe.
Brilliant.
But then your video would finish there, so we don't want that on.
Oh, maybe you do, but we don't.
So we're going to set some parameters and we could delete these.
But I always have extra stuff for my sequences.
Just I just, I don't like deleting things.
So what we're going to do well, we're going to we could set an in and out point, but whenever you
set an output to the endpoint, div defaults at the beginning.
So all we're literally going to do is we get to the end of the audio, the music.
So because we know that this is selected A2, which is the last the end of the clip right at the end,
we just need to press down once, which will go to the end of that clip and we just press oh on the
keyboard.
So that set the output moment just like we do open the in the source where we set in and out points
here.
We're now setting the output here.
And because we've only set the output to the endpoint, if I press home on the keyboard is right there
right at the beginning and that is all the sequence that we want rendering out all marked out.
Don't forget to unmute what you do on keeping in and now we go to our dialogue of exporting the sequence.
Now there are a couple of ways to do this.
I've never used this way.
File export and export media.
What I always do is control and m.
M is a term that is from way back when, when it was just audio editing and M means mixed out.
Now normally I get a preview in here.
I'm not too sure why I haven't got a preview.
Let me just save this.
And that's m again.
No preview.
I wonder why that is.
Oh, that's because export video isn't selected.
I was exporting some audio.
An hour on a client, a piece of work, and the settings that you normally put in will carry on from
a previous edit.
So bear that in mind.
But now that I've got export audio set, I now have a full if I scroll through here.
This shows me.
The whole sequence that I'm going to be rendering out to the source range here will default as in out.
Even if you set in out, if entire sequence is checked, then you're still going to get pizza over and
over that and you're still going to get the motion graphics.
So we'll leave that as in out.
I've never changed that.
Once it's set.
So we'll leave that for it is exactly what you what you want.
So that's that's saying rendered this to fit.
Now why is that important?
Well, it could be that you've got a piece of 4K footage and you're rendering out at 1920 by 1080.
And if you haven't got it to fit, you could actually be something like this, like all the way in.
So always have it to fit.
It doesn't really affect the sequence, but it affects how you can view.
And you'd be surprised.
I don't really look at this window, but in all honesty, I quite often will see something just at the
corner of my eye that Oh yeah, actually I need to change that before I add it.
So it's always good to have at least one frame, even though it's one frame in a whole host of frames
here.
And it's you'll be surprised how many things crop up either the.
Oh yeah, but I saw that one.
I saw a so scaling a scale to fit is the default and it's the best one.
It's the best one for the quality.
There's different things with regards to scaling and stretching as in scale to fill or stretch to fill.
You don't want any of that scale to fit is the perfect, perfect way to export.
Now we get to the nuts and bolts of this, and depending on the footage that you're using, you may
have different settings that you want in here, but more importantly, it's where you're outputting
to.
And it depends if you're outputting to Vimeo or YouTube or Facebook or Instagram.
But personally, I have one setting.
I mean, you can deep dive with all the things, but I have one setting that I use for everything.
And I don't know about you, but I love set and forget stuff like that, stuff like this.
You don't really want to be playing around with too much.
I will go through a couple of the aspects and explain them through, but just bear in mind that the
settings that I give you for this will cover you for 99% of your exports.
I promise you, the settings that I put in cover me for everything all the way through social media
and all the way through client work, including we're talking big corporate videos and music videos
and everything.
So this covers most things, the vast, vast, vast majority of things.
First and foremost, I never match sequence to settings, ever.
It just.
It doesn't.
No, just.
Just don't do that.
More often than not, you're going to be exposing it.
The format 8.264.
What does that mean?
Well, that's 8.264 and 8.265.
If you're watching this in the future, that's become the norm and is a version of an encoding for AMP
for, you know, AMP three are AMP three music and before is video and 8.264 is the standard that was
was applied by Apple many, many years ago when iTunes started doing video and the file format 8.264
was deemed the best quality to size ratio for a video file.
As a result, the Web has taken it to their hearts.
You may or you may not be aware, depending on your age, but there was a similar thing that happened
with DVD and HD DVD, and going even way further back there was VHS and Betamax 8.2641 out over many
other types of video encoding.
And generally it normally comes down to price, which this doesn't really but there is a price factor
involved.
And in in one point because if you imagine videos online are being stored somewhere on servers, even
if you upload to the likes of YouTube, it's being stored on a server owned by Google.
So 8.264 gave the best quality to the amount of storage space that the video would take up.
And that's just explaining that if you've never seen 8.264 before, that's purely what that means.
So the Presets will come back to this, in fact.
No, I'll set my preset so I can show you and.
I'll show you how to save this as a preset.
So I've called the CBR 20.
Bear that in mind.
Make sure that you have video and audio to export if that's what you want to export.
If you only want audio, obviously uncheck the video like I did before.
Or if you only want the video, uncheck the audio.
A lot.
The reasons why I uncheck the video is because I want to render out the audio a few times to allow Alex
Audio Bottler to fully process the audio.
You'll have you'll remember that from a previous section.
But here, right now, we're going to set the output name.
So this is very similar to when we exported a frame to change your output name.
You actually click on the blue text and this will open where we're exporting out to.
You may have to search and find the actual area where you're working in.
But this is ours and I want to put it into renders.
I always, always in my folder structure have renders as a folder.
I put Z before it just so generally it always gets the bottom.
So the render file is right at the bottom because this is enough vertical order.
So yeah, it's just a little tip that I do render, so I don't have to start looking all the way through.
I know that the render folder will be right at the bottom, double click into there, and then there's
nothing else in there because we haven't rented anything out there and it's looking currently for video
files and we're going to name this.
So the sequence comes in, sequence name comes in, and we want to maybe change that because the company
is called Char Updos.
So I'm going to say Char out doors.
And this was the pizza oven one, wasn't it?
So pizza oven number one.
Now, this is a tip that is pretty much across the whole of file structure, but I'm just going to highlight
this now.
So you never get tripped up.
Now, you probably know that number one can be written shortly like that or obviously in the long form,
number one.
However, if it's as an O one, lot of the times it's where the full stop, whenever you're saving out
a file, never, ever, ever puts a full stop in there.
And that's because if you have this, will this will render out like that.
Okay.
Pizza oven over.
Sorry, this will render out as pizza oven number one.
However, the actual file will be pizza oven number one dot MP four.
Can you see the problem if I put a dot here and one up period full stop however you you call that that
is going to affect or it could affect the file format when it gets exported.
Now that can be easily rectified once it's exported by deleting the one or putting the one the other
side and typing np4.
But you don't want these headaches.
So tip from the top.
Never, ever, ever put a full stop a period dot in your file name for anything.
Ever.
Just don't do it.
Okay.
Got a little soap lesson there.
So we're saving in our temp folder premiere pro z renders and the file name is char.
Those hyphen pizza oven number one.
So we're going to hit save.
Nothing's saved yet.
All that save there is doing is committing this title.
Good.
Let's move on.
Effects.
I never, ever touch the effects tab.
You don't need to.
You've done everything within here.
You don't need to look at this effects video.
So we're exporting at the same size that we were editing in the actual sequence, which is 1920 by 1080,
depending on what footage you're using in the future.
This could be just as easily four times this because you may be in 4K, but this is my CBR 20 preset
and it's it's never let me down.
So let's have a look at what this means.
We've got a width of 1920 by 1080.
Good.
And that's tacked on.
Good.
A frame rate is 25.
Remember, we set the frame rate of 25 right at the beginning.
Field order is progressive and the aspect is square pixels 1.0.
You remember seeing that when we generated the adjustment layer, it said square pixels 1.0.
Don't care.
Never touch that.
Never need to make sure render render at maximum depth is ticked.
Think by default this isn't ticked.
You want maximum depth.
This may make your computer struggle depending on the size and speed of your computer.
But yeah, best practice render at maximum depth performance.
Now this all depends if you've got a GPU, a graphics card.
If you don't have a graphics card, it will be set to software encoding.
It'll just take a little bit longer.
However, I always have hardware encode encoding.
That's it.
End of.
Don't touch it.
The profile is main level is 4.1 and the color space is rec.
So 709 that deals with the color space, which is what's being read by wherever the video is uploaded
to.
I've explained to you stuff that you don't really necessarily need to know, but I'm just I'm briefly
touching on it just so you have a slight explanation of it.
HDR graphics, weights.
This is measured in nets and this is fine.
This is the default for Adobe at this stage.
This may change as time progresses, but generally the default is perfect.
Good.
We've been down.
We don't care about our color primaries.
We don't touch them.
As you can see, all of them are grayed out.
So, yeah, that's we don't need to deal with these.
We do, however, need to deal with this.
And these are the bitrate settings.
If you get these wrong, your video is either going to look terrible from the outset, or more importantly,
your video is going to be so big that the vast majority of the spaces that you upload them to will over
compress and make the videos look rubbish.
What do I mean by that?
Well, let's take a full sized raw image from photography rather than maybe 1 to 2 megabytes.
Maybe three megabytes for your standard image.
A raw image can be anything between 20 and 40 megabytes, as in file size.
Now, if you export that and then upload that at that size to the likes of Facebook, Facebook will
see that as a very, very large photo file size and will compress it automatically.
And the compression is really quite aggressive.
So rather than a beautifully clear, high quality image, Facebook will overly affected Instagram do
this as well and will overly compress it to the point where your image looks terrible.
Now that's just one image.
Well, in our video, it's 25 frames a second.
It's 25 images every second.
Say it's not even a one minute clip.
You're talking a lot of images and each and every one of those can be really badly compressed by the
platform, the uploading, too.
So how do we get around this?
Well, we set our bitrate, which will directly affect our file size.
This isn't always accurate, by the way.
The estimated file size, sometimes it's it's wildly off.
But let's not worry about that right now.
Bitrate encoding.
So you have the options of VB R one pass, vb r to pass and CBR VB R stands for variable bitrate.
One pass means it goes through the video once and exports it to pass means it goes through, goes through
it twice and exports it to variable bitrate let me select variable bitrate.
I no see what we get as option targeted bitrate.
So we want to set our target bitrate.
But what it won't do is it won't guarantee that you'll have that bitrate, and that is what can really
affect your playback online.
Let's say we go via to pass.
We've now got another option, a target bitrate and a maximum bitrate.
But still we don't have a guarantee of what that rate will be.
So that's why we select CBA, which is constant bit rate.
And while this still only gives us a target bit rate because we're saying we want constant bit rate.
We should, and nearly every single time we will come out with a target bit rates of 20.
Why is this important?
Well, if you look at this number in correlation to this number with 2254 megabytes, let's take that
up to 50.
And all of a sudden we're at 382 megabytes.
It really affects the file size, but all the way up means you're going to get the best quality possible.
But as we know, best quality possible is increasing the file size and more often than not will actually
turn out a lesser quality video when played back online.
So what we do by clicking in here, setting 20 is halving the file size.
We're also setting that quality and that quality will be just below what the online platforms currently
will.
State is the the benchmark from where they would start to compress.
So that makes sense.
Let's say it's 20 is the benchmark.
If we then puts out a 21.
An export.
Facebook would see it and think, Oh, this hypothetical bed tray benchmark is 20.
This is at 21.
We need to compress it.
And all of a sudden, rather than bringing it down to 20, which is what you want, it could actually
then put it out to something like 4.29, which as you can see, the file size is it's less than a quarter
and the quality will be terrible as well.
So we leave it at 20.
This is correct as of this point.
And I've got to say, this has been my setting for about the last three years and it's perfect online
and there's videos that I've uploaded over three years, well within those three years, and the quality
is still perfect.
It's not being compressed, it's it's just spot on.
So bear that in mind.
I know that seems like a really geeky thing to be talking about, but your bitrate in your video can
really set the quality and will make a difference between your audience thinking, Wow, that's a really
good video.
Or Wow, that's a really bad quality video.
Your bitrate is or all important.
Moving on.
There is nothing else within the video tab that you need to change in audio.
Similarly, there is nothing in here you need to change.
You've set all you parameters within the sequence.
All you want to make sure is that the audio is coming out.
IAC is perfect.
Your audio codec as he's perfect, your sample rate is 58,000 hertz and your channels are stereo.
That's exactly what we want for anything.
Now bitrate for audio is a little bit different.
That's because these are kilobytes back here.
If we look back here, these are megabytes, 20, 20 megabytes is like 3000 kilobytes.
So you don't have to worry about the bitrate settings for your audio.
This is perfect.
320 is a really good quality setting for your audio.
It doesn't take up that much space.
You don't need to go higher.
In all honesty, I've never gone higher, so I don't know what problems you would have, but in the
God knows how many years I've been doing this.
I've never changed my bitrate on my audio and I've never had problems.
So just don't touch it.
Multiplex Yeah, no idea.
Never use that.
You don't need to leave that as is.
A lot of these settings are set when we're talking about other stuff.
When you set all the stuff in here, it will set it here, so don't even touch it.
Captions We're going to deal with this in a future secret sequence.
I'm right in here now.
We're going to deal with this in a future chapter, and that's when I will talk about this.
But for now, don't worry about it.
Publish now.
This is a bit of a weird one.
I've used it a couple of times.
Really, really don't like it.
However, what this can do is this can actually cut out the middleman.
So when we're finished and we go to export this, we're going to render out export out this.
But then what you would do is then decide where you want to publish this.
If it's if it's for online use.
And you'd then go to that platform and upload.
Well, in here you can actually set.
Log in to all your different accounts.
You could log into YouTube and you can set the channel playlist if it's if that's what you want to do
with the new YouTube channel.
Set the title, set the description, set the privacy whether you want it to publish or set it as a
scheduled, all that kind of stuff and even put in your custom thumbnail.
I just don't trust it.
I just don't trust it.
And also what you can't do here is the likes of cards and cards.
And yeah, I just I don't, I don't, I don't use things, although I, I'm sure that there's a full
department within, within Adobe who developed all this.
I know that's not for me and I would not suggest it.
I love a load of things that automate for you.
Publishing your videos is not one things I would use.
I just wouldn't so use at your own peril.
I'm going to come back here and go into the video tab so everything is set.
We're all happy.
You make sure moving down that your maximum render quality is turned on just like we did with regards
to the maximum depth.
I would always use maximum render quality.
You can use previews if you're struggling to render.
That can really help because obviously we've got previews in here, but I don't want to use any previews
in here.
We don't want to impose it into projects.
We don't want to use proxies.
We don't set the start time code.
It's all fine.
What you may want, depending on the quality turning out, is to go from frame something to frame blending.
But other than that, we're good to go.
So now we have two options with regards to how to render this out.
We can cue or we can export.
So if we click on export, it will actually just start exporting, start rendering down, and we'll
have a dialog right in front of us and we can't do anything in Premiere Pro.
That may not be a problem.
However, what a lot of editors like to do is they like to queue because what queuing does is it says,
Right, this is everything I want, this is everything I want to render.
If I queue it, either will add it to a list that I can do at a later date or and more importantly,
I can get some other program to start exporting, rendering that down while I continue with in premiere
pro I nine times out of ten I will queue.
So that's the way I'm going to show you export is literally that and you're done and it's as simple
as that.
I'm going to take it one step further now and show you how to queue and export.
So queue.
And what it does is it starts to open up Adobe Media Encoder whenever you download Premiere Pro.
Remember back in the day when we downloaded all of these programs from here?
Well, one of the programs that would have downloaded automatically when you download Premiere Pro will
be Media Encoder.
And that's because it's a second program that works with not only Premiere Pro but a number of other
programs, one of them being after effects.
And I've mentioned it a lot.
So what we have here, well, this is effectively a playlist and in here will be all the different files
or sequences that you've set an endpoint, an amp point, come through what we've just gone through
and clicked.
Q So now we only have one right here because that's what we're exporting it.
And as you can see, we are set at the 8.26 for codec.
We are on custom.
It should be CBR 20, but the reason why it's custom, if I click in there, if you see something different,
you want to change it.
It brings back up this dialog box.
But down here we now only have okay rather than queue and export us because we're only affecting the
settings that are going into here.
The reason why it's gone to custom is because I set it to optical flow.
If I go back to Siebel 20, that will go back to rain sampling and we have Siebel 20 there.
It doesn't matter either way, but if I press okay now that's now changed from custom to Siebel 20.
Similarly, we have the output file that we set, which was outdoors pizza of a number one C where you've
got the MP four right there.
If we'd have put it up there, it would have really confused the whole thing.
That's why I spent so much time explaining that, because that is absolutely crucial.
Just never put a full stop or a period in your file name.
So if we click in part again, if you've made a typo or something, I mean.
Well, no, I, I love a typo.
You can go in there and you can affect that again and then just hit save and again.
That does nothing other than says okay.
And that's what I want to do.
The way in which we start this render is the play button up here.
And as you can imagine, if you've got four or five or ten sequences all queued here, you might want
to just render out while you go on a lunch break or overnight if it's a really big render or a lot of
them, which is why Media Encoder is really good to use because it just saves all those facts in there.
And when you're ready to render, you'll actually just hit play.
Now the speed in which this will render will depend upon your the speed of your machine.
As you can see, this is going quite fast, to be honest with you.
It's a minute and 22 frames.
We're going to be done even faster than it takes to play the video.
Yeah, elapsed time is 20 seconds, so that's now out and done.
And as you can see right here, we have a tick next to it, which means that has been rendered and exported.
The other reason that I love using cue is because I don't have to go and try and find the file once
it's exported.
Let's say exports in here, it just goes back to this and you're like, Right, okay, where is it?
Whereas if you do it in Encoder, you can simply click that file name that you selected to record from.
And here it is.
And let's have a quick look.
When we think of outdoor cooking, we think back to nature log fires, open flames and a good char on
the food being served.
That is why our biggest focus for our products is making sure you get that authentic wood fired taste.
When it comes to pizza, making our number one pizza oven is the go to family choice.
We have carefully designed the oven so that there is a perfect flow of heat throughout and you can be
cooking in as little as 15 minutes.
The steel pizza base is different from the traditional stone used in most ovens, as we believe from
rigorous testing that this gives you the perfect crisp face to your pizza.
What do you think?
Looks good, doesn't it?
I just want to highlight one thing.
Remember how that just went to black at the end of.
And then we still have the audio behind.
That's because if I closed this and I closed down and cut it now because we don't need it, because
our input and our outpoint was set here rather than here.
If we set the outpoint to here to just simulate that, it would have played like this.
What about such an abrupt stop?
So being able to set that as an out point and allowing the music to play.
It just makes all the difference.
You know what I mean?
It's just good.
So that's exporting.
And I'm very briefly in the next section, just to round off this exporting section, I'm going to show
you where to check to make sure that your export settings are absolutely perfect.
These are going to be a this is going to be one main reference where you can check at any time, because
this guy is brilliant and it will be the start of you seeing the the other side of the community, the
editing community, because there are so many resources out there for you.
But that's coming up next.


### 3. Export Settings for a Particular Platform

So this guy is the guy I come to to check on my rent settings every now and again, because these things
can change.
I mean, they really can change a lot depending on what the platforms are doing.
We were talking Facebook, Instagram, all that kind of stuff.
And as you can see, this is just one of the videos that I've randomly picked out from from Matt's channel,
and this is export high quality Twitter videos.
This guy is called Matt Johnson and he's he's just such a great guy.
I love his whole style.
I love his just everything.
I'm going to I'm going to leave him playing here, but I can't use his audio.
But he's brilliant and he will deep dive into all export settings depending on what platform you're
uploading to.
So this is particularly for Twitter, and you can use so many different presets if you want to absolutely
make sure that it's completely correct for the platform that you're uploading to and the way in which
you do that is.
Let's go to here now again export.
And you saw I had a preset of CPR 20.
Well, let's say I changed up a couple of things as per what mattered said and I know that that is going
to be for Twitter.
Well, there's something that I haven't touched on yet, and I'll briefly show you and then I'll completely
I'll tell you to completely ignore.
And that is in this dropdown of Presets, because we're in 8.264.
In this load of presets, I've got my preset at the top, but all the way through here you've got different
types of presets, and now they have Facebook presets and Twitter presets and Vimeo presets and YouTube.
There's a reason why I wouldn't use any of them, and it's mainly because there's every chance that
they're not going to be the most up to date.
And if they are, they're not necessarily going to work with everything that you need them to work with.
To make that a little bit maybe clearer as to, you know, what we've been talking about in the past.
Remember what I said about creative lots and how this look might this look right here might be great
for footage that you shot a couple of weeks back and it was brilliant.
But put it on to here and it doesn't work very well at all.
Well, that's the same is kind of what I'm talking about when I talk about the presets for export in
Premiere Pro, I just don't trust them and I don't think you should either.
So I have my CBR 20 preset.
I do normally have a lot more presets, but I've updated and I've reinstalled and I haven't backed up
my settings.
Remember, you can do that by this bye boy down here and I'm going to need to rebuild them all again.
But let's say I've changed a lot of things around and that's the right thing that matters.
As for Twitter and Twitter is one that I'm going to be doing a lot for.
So what do I do?
I call up to here and this will then say custom.
Let me just change something now, but let's say it's optical flow.
So now we've got custom.
So I know that I've got no preset saved in here which has all of these settings exactly as they are.
So you could come straight to here and save presets.
And actually rather than Twitter, I'm going to say this is CBR constant bit rate of 20, but it's optical
flow.
So I'm going to go up here and actually show you what was the base preset that we've built this on?
It comes in as a as a suggestion.
So I'm going to say this is CBR 20 and I'm going to say optical flow.
Optical flow.
And now I press, okay, don't worry about saving effect settings or publish settings.
Again, we don't need to publish anyway and hit.
Okay, now you have that preset optical flow.
I also still have my CBR 20, and this is where queuing comes in really handy as well because let's
say we want to export, say we do have, you know, up here, we've got Twitter and Facebook and Instagram
and they're all ever so slightly different.
Well, that's cracking.
We come into here and we say, this one is for Facebook.
So we'll go in here and we'll say, it's exactly that video and it's f b for Facebook and hit.
Okay, that's good.
And I'm going to hit queue.
That's then going to open that up and media encoder.
Then what we're going to do is while that's doing that and getting that ready, we're going to export
again.
And we now want to do this for I'm going to use these just just to show.
But obviously you don't use these.
Let's say we want it as Twitter as well.
So we'd use the Twitter preset and come back into here and we're going to title this Twitter.
You see what I'm doing here and then going to hit queue and then I'm going to come back in here and
let's just do one more and I'm going to say this one is for YouTube and that 1080 so I'm going to go
back in here and I select and that's make it easy for me as a base file name and I'm going to say YouTube.
And now all of a sudden I've now queued those three without slowing down any of the system because nothing
has been doing.
All we've been doing is preparing everything.
And then when we're ready to render all these out, we just once again hit play.
And now what we're doing in no time at all is we're populating this renders folder with all these different
versions ready to be used in whatever way we want.
If I go with that for the list, that's the original one that we wanted.
And we now have a YouTube version, a Twitter version and a Facebook version.
All done.
And so Q them all up.
It was just literally hitting play and it starts.
It's brilliant, it's so, so good.
But making sure that you're using the right settings, not the in-built presets in Premiere Pro, This
Guy will be your saviour.
Look at his funny little face.
He's brilliant.
I've watched him for years and he's an absolute treasure trove of settings, both for sequence settings
and for export settings.
He's he's brilliant.
So I highly recommend who is Matt Johnson?
That's the end of all the basics.
We're now going to really deep dive and I have a little bit of an explainer at the beginning of the
next section.
And yeah, I look forward to seeing you there.

## 17 Reframing
### 1. Why Reframe

So we've learned how to export frames, export sequences, export different versions of sequences depending
on what platform we're exporting to.
However, unless you've been living under a rock for the last few years, you're going to realize that,
yeah, this is not the only style of video that's out there.
We have square video, which is quite popular on both Instagram and Facebook.
We have vertical video, which is literally like live like that, like this turn around 90 degrees.
And there's an easy way and hard way to be able to get different versions for different sequences.
So here's how we do it in Premiere Pro.
Let's say we've built this sequence and we like this sequence just going to mute it.
So we're not playing back the audio as well, but we're like this sequence.
But actually we'd like a version that's in square to be able to go on Instagram.
Now this 1969 or 1920, by 1080, this will now go on Instagram.
There was a time where you couldn't put widescreen video or wide aspect ratio on Instagram.
You can now, but still, there are going to be a number of times when square video is preferred over
your traditional 69.


### 2. How to Reframe

So let's make one from this.
So here's our sequence, pizza oven sequence 1080.
I'm going to right click and I'm going to duplicate this sequence so it comes up pizza oven sequence
1080.
I'm going to click in there to change the name and we're going to make a square version of this.
So I'm going to sequence in brackets square.
Now Square is also known as 1 to 1.
Like we talked talked about 69 and your fractions so that the best way to bring it down from 1920 to
1080 is six across to nine down.
Square is 1 to 1.
So it's one to the height or one to the width.
So they're equal on both sides.
Say that now.
So it makes it clear once we select what we're going to select.
So now we've got two sequences of the same thing, but we have two different titles.
So let's double click into the square one, which opens up in here, and it looks pretty much the same
because it is exactly the same.
I'm just going to these are the two elements that was the color grading and the motion graphics.
And here we have our sequence again.
Now we're going to go square.
So first and foremost are going to get rid of the letterbox.
So let's get rid of that because we don't need that.
I'm just going to spend a bit of time just going through making sure that everything isn't top or bottom.
And when we moved within like here.
So I'm just going to select this clip here and I'm going to just cancel that, reset it back to the
original.
That's fine.
That's fine.
That's not.
So we reset the parameters of the position back down.
Same with this one we frame.
Come over and.
We frame that?
It just takes a bit of time, but you just make sure that your.
In the correct position to start from, because what we're going to do is when we use Adobe Premiere
Pro to sequence the reframing of this.
Now, this is a new edition in Premiere Pro within the last couple of years, and it takes a lot of
the work for you.
It's not completely foolproof, but it does at least give you a better starting position.
And I'm going to leave.
I'm not going to reset this not only because top and bottom is fine, but also we've got this movement
on here and it'll be interesting to see what Premiere Pro does that does with that when we're trying
to reframe.
So now that we've got everything filling the whole screen, it's simply a one click in premiere pro
at least to get you to a decent starting position.
And that is within the actual sequence.
We're going to go up to sequence in the top and select auto reframe sequence.
So once we click that, we're going to get this dialogue and this is where we make the decision as to
what we're going to reframe this sequence as.
So my target aspect ratio is square, or as I said, 1 to 1, we're in 69, so that's there.
But you've also the option for five, which is kind of like square but a little bit taller.
A lot of video on Instagram is quite popular with four, five and 916, which is fully vertical, usually
used for the likes of reels and for stories.
But for this for this sequence, we're just going to say square 1 to 1.
But if you did want any of the others, they're all here.
Motion tracking I leave on as default.
You can say the slow emotion or faster motion.
I'll explain what that means once we get into it.
And I don't miss clips.
I don't want to nest any of the clips because if we want to then effect any of them, we'd have to go
into the clips and it can really just overcomplicate things.
So I'm just going to leave.
Don't miss clips and create.
Now what this is doing is it's working through.
If you look down here at the bottom right hand side, that's done in no time at all.
What that's done is it's also reframed this sequence to, as you can see, square video.
If we go back to the beginning of the sequence and press play, leaving the audio off for now.
You can see we now.
Taking up the full square.
Okay.
That doesn't work.
We'll have to change that because that doesn't.
That's not how we wanted it.
But moving around that might need a little bit reframing again.
That as well.
But yeah, in general, it's it's all right.
It's a it's a good starting position for us to give you an example of what it would have looked like
had we not reframed anything, your videos would have come in.
If I take off the auto reframe, it would have come in like this.
This is how it would have looked.
And you'd have had to maybe scale up a bit, maybe find where you want to be.
Whereas with auto reframe it starts it for you.
It's not always great as as we saw on that second frame, but we can easily affect that.
So that's I'm happy with that first clip.
Second clip, I kind of just want it to stay there, to be honest with you.
So I'm going to what you can't see here is the generative path of keyframes and the keyframes that we're
dealing with before.
If we tick this overwrite generative path, all of a sudden we have all these keyframes.
That we couldn't see before.
And if we skip through them, you can see that.
Yeah.
That's when Premiere Pro started moving everything over because they wanted to see my father in law,
Joey's hand.
And that's not what I want.
Now, what we could do is we could go with all of these different keyframes and readjust them if we
wanted to.
Or for this clip in particular, we could just turn off auto reframe.
We're scaled up.
Let's see how that looks.
I'm happy with that.
That doesn't need to be animated through.
We still got all this data in here, but we don't need it.
What I might do is I might move the video over a little bit of a clip over a little bit.
Remember when we have the letter box and we'll talk about the height and we're able to go up and down?
Well, we don't have any room, top and bottom, because we zoomed in all the way to fill top and bottom.
But because of the nature of the beast that is square, we've got room to go side by side and we've
still got area of our footage.
So if we go a little bit more central, bring on the safe markers.
And as you can see, these now reflect in square and I'm happy with that sent it up play that back.
Yeah, that's good.
Go through the next one.
Happy with that?
But we don't have the zoom out that we put in initially.
I can't see it.
That's going to I'm going to toggle off auto reframe and let's see how that original Zoom looked.
Good.
I prefer that I'm more than happy with that.
I'll leave that as it is.
So as you can see, Auto Reframe works for a lot, so it's not even needed.
That's definitely needed.
We need to move that now.
We could effect this generates a path or what we could do, which is easier is to reframe offset.
So we offset the reframe.
So just like up here, you've got the x axis and the y axis of the other way around.
You grab this and this is almost like playing with the anchor point and we're moving this over, but
we're not setting a key frame for it.
So if we play this now.
It's brought it to the side for us.
That works perfectly.
Similarly with this, I think maybe we need to bring it over to the left a little bit.
See, because what Auto Reframe is doing is it's using motion tracking and what it thinks you want in
shot sometimes isn't quite right.
So with this, again, we're all the way to the side of the picture up.
And so if we offset that just a little bit to the side, go to the clip before.
Yeah, I'm happy with that.
Okay.
That looks good.
Happy with that.
That does something a little bit strange that I don't want it to.
Okay, let's go into here and check the motion tracking of here.
If we overwrite, generate a path.
If we size this up a little bit, we can actually see the different ways of going between the handles.
It's that movement there that doesn't really fit.
I'm going to take out those key frames.
And maybe bring this key frame over a little bit.
And have it.
So it's there and maybe track that for the whole of it.
That makes that movement almost negligible, but it keeps the pizza in the center.
Moving on to the next clip.
Yeah, I'm happy with that.
That possibly needs to be offset a little bit off to the left.
Yeah.
Happy with that?
Oh, that doesn't do anything good.
Let's see.
This will get better over time.
It is relatively new, but I'm actually going to turn off auto frame with that.
Also every frame even.
And yeah, I'm happy with that.
These things, all these kind of tools of being able to also reflect.
You see, we don't even like that these these kind of auto reframe things.
And these are mainly the things that will get affected with bugfixes and updates during the year where
there's not major updates to the software, which is why it's really important to keep your program
as up to date as possible.
I'm not happy with that.
They're want to offset that position just a little bit here.
So it's more in frame.
Good.
Alex.
Good.
It looks like Auto Reframe is actually fighting against our pan across which you put here.
So let's turn off auto reframe and.
I'm going to actually zoom out here a little bit because I know that we zoomed in, scale out slightly,
see how much room we've got.
And I'm going to turn off that key frame because I don't think it works necessarily in square.
And yeah, okay.
That's about as much room as we've got.
And let's.
I'm just going to.
I'm going to reanimate this.
So we're going to get into here and set this position, put that right at the beginning, and then we're
going to go, baby, just to set that right at the end.
So then.
Oh, that's good.
That's a nice slope and a cross as we finish.
And that is how easy it is to reframe depending on what video format and what platform you want to export
out to.
You can have such freedom with this.
You can make almost entirely different videos depending on what you're playing with.
I mean, we talk like if you're in 16, nine, 16, which is fully vertical, you can put a couple of
videos on the same line and it works absolutely perfectly.
But yeah, I hope it helps.
That's how to reframe.
And yeah, that should set you up for even more work in social video.

## 18 Advanced Graphics
### 1. A Brief Introduction to Why We Use Plugins

So now we come to the area of the course, which I've titled Advanced Graphics, but I want to start
this section with a little bit of a preface, and that is a slight discussion with regards to plug ins
and the use of them.
Now on the surface, it may seem that plug ins is a way of cheating, but it's a tool.
It's a tool that you're using to be able to achieve what you want to.
Similarly, to maybe someone who's putting up a shelf and say they want to make sure that it's absolutely
level.
If you imagined a shelf, you'd be measuring from the bottom, from the floor up to one point and then
the same point further along and making sure that that's level.
The easy way to do that would be to use a spirit level.
It's exactly what we're doing in here.
The amount of things that you could do manually in here to achieve the effects that a plugin can achieve
is is easy.
It's there.
You can do it.
However, it's not easy.
I just said it's easy, but it's not.
It's time consuming.
And the one thing that you will learn very quickly in this industry is the time versus money, whole
paradigm.
And that is more often than not.
As an editor, you charge for an edit rate.
Now the edit rate might be when the video is done or it might be per day.
Either way, if you can get your edit done quicker, you're effectively getting paid more per hour.
Similarly, on the other end, if you're getting paid that way and it takes you so much longer, you're
effectively out of pocket or you're working for less money because it takes you more time to do it.
Following that idea, if you get things done quicker, not only are you getting paid more for the work
that you're doing, but you're also effectively earning more a second way because you're able to take
on more work or then you're able to start the next job earlier.
So plugins can really help with that.
And in advanced graphics, it's highly advisable.
The two main plugins that we're going to be looking at in this section are from a company called Mr.
Horse that make premiere composer and also motion write.
And the way in which these two plugins can really help you is that they can do most of the heavy lifting
for you.
So you can stay within the creative process.
You can literally select what you need, drag it in and move on, get that effect in.
There are some elements in even the starter pack in the text presets to do something like this.
Let me tell you this on I'm don't want to spend too much time in this because we are going to be deep
diving into this.
But that one's just caught my eye.
To do this with text, you effectively can't do this in Premiere Pro.
So you'd have to learn how to do it in after effects first.
And then that's a whole other different program.
And it would take to learn it first, would take hours to then implement it once, you know, it would
take at least well, it would take a while.
So being able to just drag something like that in here, edit it to the text that you want and move
on.
Will saves you hours.
And I mean, we are talking hours to to get the same effect.
And that's where plug ins can really help you in that, not just the finessing part of an edit, but
even right at the beginning when you start and if you shoot as well, if you film all the footage,
you can have a number of these effects in mind while you're shooting.
So you know the kind of effects you're going to apply at a certain point in the edit.
So we're going to be using premiere composer for Mr. Horse as an example.
We're also going to be using motion right now.
Motion Ray.
We looked at them a little while back on their website and these are pretty new for having a plugin
within Premiere Pro.
And this just makes it so much easier because you can search on all the different things here.
We're going to really look into this as well, but you can search what you need and download it within
here without having to go anywhere else.
And the minute that you've downloaded it, it's licensed for you to use.
This is all stock video, but there's stuck images.
The stock, there's royalty free music, there's graphics, there's everything we're going to have.
We're going to really deep dive into this one as well, because this is pretty new to me and I absolutely
love it.
And I've already used a handful of times of which I'll show you.
But yeah, so that's a quick explanation with regards to plug ins and why you would use them.
I hope that makes sense.
I hope I've been clear just really how important being able to use plug ins and being able to incorporate
them into your workflow is because they can really stand you apart, not only with the ability of what
you're able to achieve in your edits, but also the speed in which you're able to finish your edits
and turn around.
And a client that's kept waiting less is not only going to be happier, but also much, much more likely
to come back to you.


### 2. Content Plugins - Premiere Composer

So right up here, we're going to start with premiere composer.
And if you've downloaded it, don't forget at the bottom of the worksheet, you will have links, external
links for anything that I've suggested in this course that I feel you could make use of.
And if you've installed premiere composer and you can't see it, you go to window extensions and just
select Premiere Composer.
It will probably come in on its own and then you can just duck it where you need to.
Don't forget if you've got it where you like it and that's where you wants to stay, you'll right click
and you save changes to this workspace and that will always be in the workspace where you've saved it.
So I know I've touched on Premiere Composer quite a number of times in in Premiere Pro in the course
so far.
But let's have a real look at it now.
So here's the starter pack right here.
This is the free version and all of these elements are free for you to use in any project that you have.
I'm just going to very briefly look at a few of these.
By the way, the imagery that you see, none of these images, this isn't a stock image.
What they have here is they have one clip into another clip to show you the transition that the effects
that they're showing you will have.
But we'll get to that.
So let's look right at the beginning with regards to text elements, because we will look at text elements
before.
I love these and I use these all the time.
If you then as I said, this is the starter pack and this is free.
But if you choose to actually purchase anything from Premiere Composer, I'll just show you.
These are the two text elements that they have for you.
So it's it's quite a lot on the text presets here, which are slightly different.
I'll talk about those.
But if you've got the essential typography pack, all of a sudden we have so many ways in which you
can bring text into your project.
I'm still going.
I mean, you can imagine there are some of these which I have not used and have never used, but it's
great to have the opportunity and the availability of them should I ever need to.
Anyway, let's go back to the starter pack because it's a little bit less daunting and I'm going to
look at this one right here, which is one line fill text box.
What does that look like?
Okay, well, we can grab it and drag it onto our platform or hit add and they will add it to the next
free channel where I'll play headers.
So I'll do it like that so you can see it.
I've got that sound text that doesn't always bring in sound, it brings in sound.
If whatever you've selected in Mr. Horse in premiere composer has sound that these don't have a sound
element to them.
But I'm just going to add with sound all the all of them all.
And it'll just come in.
So what have we got here?
Well, first and foremost, as you can see, this has been generated on here and this is very similar.
If we just come here and start typing, that's a graphic member when we added the graphic before.
So it kind of comes in like that.
But.
It's a little bit different because this is an animated graphic.
So animates him and animates out.
It's going to change the wording because that's really easy to do.
And the easiest way to do that is we've got this right here, selected and in premiere composer.
This is where we got it from, but with it highlighted.
If we go to edit, we have the ability to change a number of different variables within this graphic.
First and foremost, the text that's in the box.
This is a one line text file.
So we want to stay on the same line.
But I'm going to put in here Pizza Hut.
So that was easy.
I can also change the text.
If you remember, one of my favorite fonts is No ESTA.
We're going to change it to that.
So select go in and yeah, it's learn my alphabet right there.
That's done.
Literally within a couple of clicks.
We've changed the text and we've changed the font.
If we play that back now, animate ten.
And animates.
And what else can we do with this?
Well, obviously, we can change the colors so we can change the color text.
You see how we've got this little click here?
Well, we've seen this before so we can pick from anywhere around here.
We can put in a hex code here, or we can grab the Eyedropper Tool and select a color maybe in here.
And that's affected.
The tax rate that we can also change the fell of the actual container, which is the box around it.
And we could change that to maybe I like the blue hair on Joey shirt, the light blue.
So rather than trying to guess it, I'm going to select within here as well.
You've got an Eyedropper tool and I can select that blue and if I press okay, that's now changed up
to the green doesn't necessarily go to well now does it.
So I'm going to change that color and maybe call that to white.
So that'll pop.
One thing that you can't do in Premiere Composer is add a shadow to these.
And I have reached out to them and asked if there's going to be a possibility to have that in the future.
They came back to me and said, We're working on it or we're looking into it.
I think they said, So you never know.
By the time you get to this, you may actually be able to add a drop shadow within here as well.
But for now we have this.
We can add a drop shadow, but it would add a drop shadow to the whole of it.
So it would actually effectively add it to this bit round here, the actual container.
But we know how to do that effect and drop shadow and we would drop that or drag it onto that actual
bit of in your in your timeline.
And as you can see, the drop shadow.
If I remove the distance, you can see that's there.
And if I offset it a little bit and blow it out of the we have that shadow.
The great thing with adding it to here in the effects controls is that it will actually animate in with
that box.
It's going to take that off for now.
So obviously that's not stock premiere composer.
What we can also do is we can size this up.
So if we wanted to change the the scale, obviously we could come into here into effects controls.
But because this is vectors, you want to make sure that you're scaling up the right thing so it doesn't
pixelate.
Remember that from before.
So I'm going to scale up from here.
Alex.
Good.
And I'm going to move it now.
Again, we could move around here, but as you see, our scale hasn't changed.
We also have position here and this will change the position within the graphic, not the overall effect
controls.
So let's use that to move it around.
And we could drop it down a bit.
Like maybe.
A lower third.
How does that look?
Good.
I like that.
Now.
Do you think that was on for long enough?
I don't think so.
So how do we affect that?
Well, every single bit of text graphic that comes from premiere composer.
Can be as long or short as you need to be, and it will animate out at the same point towards the end.
So if we go here and we say, right, that animated out what might be about here.
Yet if we move it out now and press play.
It will stay on for the entirety that it's there.
And then you will animate out somewhere around here.
Yeah.
Out.
So you can time this as long or as short as you want to, and you can duplicate these and have different
versions.
So let's say we want to do pizza time at our house.
Let's hold down alt and make a duplicate.
Let's move the top one up.
Just so it kind of reflects on the timeline.
And just a fact in that to go there, close that down.
So that's pizza time.
I'm going to select the second one, which is the bottom one, and I'm going to say at maybe at home.
So they were both coming together.
That looks good.
But let's say we want them to last a little bit longer.
That's as easy as just tracking them out.
And that's unlike that.
Now, what I want is I want at home to come in after pizza time, but I want them both to animate out
at the same time.
Well, just like affecting the end of the handle, we can actually affect the beginning.
And that will change when it comes in, but it won't speed up the animation.
So if I track this up a little bit and play.
And then the animator at the same time, such a powerful tool.
And it literally is just a couple of clicks.
The other thing that I absolutely love about this is that you can set presets within a preset.
So say you're happy with that font, the color of the text and the color of the container and say you're
working with a pizza company and that is their colors.
It's that blue and the white.
Well, you can save it as a preset, save as a new preset.
And we'll say it's.
Pizza Co.
Done.
Now let's say we bring in a new element, and this is just like the old element.
If we drop down the presets and say, Well, I actually want pizza company that's given us the place
in which they is the size and the colors and the font.
So you could set this up as, say, you've got multiple videos for this client, so they're an ongoing
client or it's your YouTube channel and these are your brand colors.
And you think, Right, that's the place where I always want the text come up and that's the font and
that's the color and that's the size.
Great.
It's that.
Such a powerful tool.
It's brilliant.
And this is literally only one element of one part in the starter pack.
And as I said before, these are all three.
So what else can we get within Mr. Horse?
Well, if you look in the starter pack again, you've got all different ways in which you can use these
bits of text.
So we got this wall which was animating down.
But we've got this animating up.
Same thing.
Animating from the left.
Animating from the right.
And then we've got typing.
So just like these are moving the whole thing together.
We've got this, which I can type out.
So let's add that and see how that looks.
That's great.
So now, just like we did with the with the other one.
Let's go to maybe Northwest.
I can do love this fund.
I really do.
All the way down to.
And.
And.
Can you see it?
Yeah, I couldn't.
And then we go.
Peter.
Toppings.
And what that does now is it types it out from the side because that's the effect that we're going for
and then it pulls it back like that.
I love it.
So let's see what else we can change within here so we know that we can change the position.
And we know we can change the scale.
Good.
Happy with that?
We can change here with a tick box for the animation.
What does that do?
Well, as you can see, the text is now coming up from the bottom.
Not just typing on.
Maybe that's the effect you're looking for.
Looks great, doesn't it?
We can also effect this.
Turn that off for now, because we can also affect the tracking and the position correction.
So say you've got a font that is mainly bottom heavy and it's going down here.
Well, you can use these handles for finite adjustments.
Look, it's just moving around.
But within that container, that's really helpful because I have I have a a client which uses this font.
And as you can see, everything's down towards the bottom.
So whenever I have to do any kind of text like this for them, I have to come down to the position correction
and just bring it up a little bit.
It means that you are not limited with regards to the font, depending on where a certain font or family
a default themselves.
So yeah, that's that's such a deep dive way.
The premiere premiere composer has that you can really dial in exactly what you're looking for.
Similarly with the tracking, so you can add tracking out for your text so you know, you can change
the tracking.
The kerning is what this is also known as.
And it literally affects everything.
It's it's such such a great way to absolutely make minuscule adjustments to make sure you get exactly
what you want stroke with.
Well, there's no stroke.
Well, no, because that's on zero.
But if we up the stroke, all of a sudden we're adding a stroke to this graphic like we did before in
essential graphics.
And not only can we other stroke, but we can change the color.
So say rather than the orange we wanted, the the more green of the basil on top while we use the color
picker and pick that green.
Brilliant look, not only can we at the stroke, we can round the corners of this box that looks more
like a like a, like a button that you click.
We can change the opacity of the stroke.
I mean, these are the things that you possibly wouldn't even think about.
But if you want to, you could turn down the capacity of the stroke, you could turn down the capacity
of the fill.
So you could literally take it all the way out, change the colour of the text back to white.
And you have a completely different looking graphic because there's nothing there.
Now let's add the drop shadow to that.
And all of a sudden.
We've got a piano on the text.
Granted, the Drop Shadow is also on the stroke as well, but you could get rid of the stroke.
If we look down here, we also have a fact that's going to undo those things.
Just so everything shows the opacity.
It's totally fell opacity.
We can change the horizontal and vertical padding within this whole thing.
So if we look here, we can make the box that little bit wider if we need it to or narrower if you wanted
it just right on the edge of the the text and same with the vertical so we can make it.
Or if we wish to.
Or bring it right down.
Just right on to the text, depending on what effects you're looking for, what overall look you're
looking for in your videos.
So that's just two of loads of fonts and text presets that we've got.
But we also have in the starter pack some text presets and what these are are pre-rendered pre coded
ways in which you can affect text.
Let's take this one for instance, because I was looking at that before position and rotate from the
start and you got the option from from the top.
So falling down or from the bottom.
So coming up and go from the top.
I like that.
Tilt that out.
I'm going to add that to our project goes through a little bit and we're now here and looks great simply
with the other things.
We can come in here and add that straight in, that we can change the color if we want to.
We could change that to black, maybe make it stand out a little bit more, but we can also do, Oh,
say, you know which one I'm going for?
What we can also do in here is we can affect the animation.
So let's get it halfway through the animation so we can kind of see what it's doing because it bounces
down, doesn't it?
Bounces down, then comes back up.
Let's get halfway through the animation and let's see what this is doing.
So we're currently at -120 degrees.
So if we effect that, see how the text is moving.
Let's put it two plus one, three, one.
Let's see the effect that that has.
So rather than leaning all the way forward, the text leans a bit back again.
It's the tiniest change, but that could be more of the effect that you're going for.
But also because this is being animated in each of these pieces of text animating individually, you
can deep dive and change so much, say the overshoot delay.
Let's say that we want to take that up a little bit.
Let's see how that affects it.
Completely.
I mean, it looks like a completely different animation.
Well, not completely different.
But, you know, I mean, it's it massively changes that animation.
So you've got all these different elements that you can affect.
You could also add motion blur.
So while it's moving, while the text is moving through the frame, we can be adding blur.
See how that's added blown out to the text.
If I look at it with the with motion blur turned off just comes down as it would if we add motion blur
and play that.
You can see it actually is a lot more CPU intense.
I'm going to prevent this just so you can see it.
Set an endpoint, set an output and control and enter that just pre renders everything that just bakes
everything in so we can properly view it.
Again, some of these effects are quite CPU and CPU intensive, so it depends how fast your machine
is as to how they'll play back.
I'm actually currently running a screen recorder within here as well, so that takes up quite a lot
of CPU and GPU, which is why it's probably not running as smoothly as it would.
So just quickly pre rendering, this will help me show you what you will probably be able to see just
on your system as normal.
And so now this is Pre-Rendered.
We can have a quick look through.
Looks great, doesn't it?
And the beauty is that it renders animates in and animates out.
It's it's such a such a powerful tool, certainly, that for now, Claire, that just to keep it all
nice and tidy.
If you look a bit further in the starter pack transitions.
Transitions are so popular and there are so many different ones.
I mean, we're quite limited within the app, within the starter pack.
But then I say that there's still a full range of panning, there's zooming out, as you can hear.
It's got a sound zoom in that has sound and then we have rotate, which we've got counter-clockwise
with sound, clockwise with sound that can slowly send you a little bit insane if you leave all the
sounds blank.
But yeah, we have all these transitions and again, these are all in the starter pack.
You've got so many more options.
Once you once you actually get a dedicated pack down, say you got the transitions pack down.
And I mean, look, not only do we now have just rotate like we had in the other one, but you also
have ways like this where it's anticipating and then switches.
I mean, there are so many different ways to try to transition in this plug in pan and tilt is really
good.
So you can actually panic but also angle slightly.
So it kind of gives a totally different effect.
And there's always, I mean, so much more than you'll ever need.
But if we go back into the transitions here, let's have a look.
A few of these Fade to Black is simply kind of like crossfade, but a little bit more of a moment where
there's black in the middle of those.
But I really love the zoom out.
So let's have a look at this with some of this footage, because this is a great way that this works.
And actually, I can I can show you how this would affect with this kind of letterbox in your adjustment
on top.
So let's say we wanted to do it.
With that.
In fact, I want to.
And do the zoom here, actually.
And we're going to do the zoom out right there.
Okay.
So we're in the the pizza oven and then we're out.
So I'm sure you agree that the just a straight cut.
Tells the story.
Great.
However, if we added a zoom out.
I can leave the sound off and I know I'm going to leave the sound on and hit at it.
Measures where my play had it and places it right at the point where my play had.
Not only these which are effectively adjustment layers with information in them, but also it adds the
audio right there.
So let's play this back and see how it looks.
Now you see how halfway through that it affected these.
See how it doesn't really work with that letter box.
That's no problem.
All we have to do is take that letterbox and put it above it.
Because remember how this works.
I just meant layers affect everything below it.
So if I keep that adjustment layer on top, these will just affect below and well, will be working
everything within still the letterbox because the letterbox is on top.
Play it back.
How good does that look?
And that's just one click.
Just one click.
I'm just going to get rid of that sound because it can be a little bit annoying if we haven't sorted
out the levels and all of that.
But let's just look at that back with the music on and just show you the difference in just this one
simple click and the right animation at the at the right transition at the right time.
The food being served.
That is why our biggest focus for our products is making sure you get that authentic wood fired taste.
Looks great, doesn't it?
With that in mind as well, let's go towards the towards the end, because remember, we were carrying
this along and then we ended up on the table.
Well, just like with the zoom we can pan and I want to go that way.
So I want the image to go to the right.
So if I get it right on here between these two and again, let's just remind ourselves of how it looks
without.
Ken tells the story.
But if we had a bit of movement.
Where it's going, right?
Turn off the sun.
We don't need that.
And just hit at.
Again, it goes for the two because there's two layers of adjustment layer here and it goes for the
two three without overwriting anything.
And effectively, that's below this letter box.
And now let's have a look at that.
Added movement between those cuts.
The base is different from the traditional stone used in most ovens, as we believe from rigorous testing
that seriously, the right transition at the right time can just make everything just so much better
and really levels of the quality of your production.
So those are transitions movement.
We also have other types of transitions.
If I tilted this on again still within the starter pack, we have rectangles, we also have circles
and we have diagonals.
Rectangles so easy.
I like this.
Let's just the out of here and have a right.
Transition me back and so it's not playing back to you and.
That point we're going to write.
We're going in.
So he could just zoom in, but it's not actually that much of a movement.
So let's just go for a right translation.
So it comes from the right to the left and again ahead where it needs to be hit at.
And there we are straight with our transition.
And remember, because the letter box is above, we're below everything.
We could always take these above the letter box and then it would go all the way through everything.
Well, it doesn't it's not really in keeping with what we're doing.
So because there's two colours here, we can change those two colours.
So what we want to change them to, well, we highlight them both.
We can select them both together.
Because if you look here, if we highlight one, we have colour one and colour two.
That's in that one.
I just my layer that's been created.
But if we go to the next, we've actually got this here as well.
So if we select them both, we can we can change both colours at the same time.
So I'm going to change this orange to maybe like maybe like the light kind of beige.
Now, that's good.
And I'm going to change this orange to the green behind it.
And that with just a couple of clicks.
Dumb things you swipe.
That is used on so many YouTube videos, tutorials, all that kind of stuff, and it's done within just
a matter of clicks.
If you were to do that yourself, you'd need a series of color mats and these are going at different
times.
So you see they start close together and then they kind of stretch out.
And then they kind of.
Catch up with each other towards the end.
The green is all the way off at that point, but they catch up towards the end.
So it's not just a case of animating it across the screen.
Everything is using easing as well.
Just.
It's just it looks brilliant.
Such an easy way to add just a little more level to your to your piece.
Circles and diagonals are very similar, but also within the starter pack we have these which are social
media animations.
And you can just see straight away what this would mean.
Say you're in a video and you've said, I don't forget to like the video.
Well, there's a like icon that we had and it comes straight at the point where I'll play heads and
if I play it, there it is right there.
Don't forget to like I can then move this around just like we could with the text and scale it up.
I could take the color.
Pick a color from maybe the.
That's actually very close to that.
So let's maybe go for the Greens, which stands out a bit more.
Don't.
Don't forget to, like, unsubscribe.
Looks great.
Similarly, we can animate the bell you know the note five bell in in YouTube and we can also put up
our different profiles on your socials.
Similarly, we can.
This is one of my favorites.
Where is it on the YouTube?
Let's just tell them that so we can see this is the one.
So if you select this and you can say whether you want it to just notify.
So if you're you know, you're telling your viewers, don't forget to subscribe and to the bell so you
get notified or you can just have standard.
Don't forget to subscribe so you don't miss out on anything done.
Brilliant.
So let's get this notify and I'll show you just how feature packed this.
It's just going to delete these for now.
Because it looks like it's it's a simple animation.
But if I leave sound on an ad.
Sound has come down here as well.
And what does that mean?
Well, let's watch.
It's those little things that will really just they sell the animation because they've got a slight
little sound on them.
You've also got all this text that you can change.
So.
The text here for Mr. Hall says maybe.
My channel.
That's plus they have them all capitals.
I think we can I think we can send that's the change that to 1 million subscribers.
I wish.
So that can easily be changed.
I subscribe to and subscribe, so that obviously changes now when you click subscribe.
It subscribed and it greys out and you click the bell.
But what you can also do is change the background.
So this background here, if I start around in corners, you can see it rounds off this.
But what I don't have is I don't have an image in here.
And I know that they are looking to be able to just select an image to easily put in there.
But until that happens, we can change the position.
Let's bring it maybe a little bit closer to the bottom and say you had your image there.
What images do we have?
We have.
What images do we have?
We have images.
We have pizza oven.
Maybe that's the image that you want to use.
Well, we bring that up to the next channel and bring that image behind.
Let's have a look at how we then place that where we need to.
We can scale it down a bit.
Get into motion and you see how I've put it below, because that's an alpha channel right there and
we can scale it down all the way.
Keep going.
Maybe size that up a little bit.
That might be a profile picture.
If that is your profile picture that works perfectly, place it in nicely behind that.
And then all you have to do is you need to time it.
So where it is.
So obviously that that image is right there on.
So now we just use the arrow keys and you see how it's fully covered there.
Great.
Well, we just get that pizza oven and just.
Start it there so it's not visible before.
And then there it is as it comes in.
And then keep our.
Finger down towards the end.
And it's at that point that we're out.
So you just trim it to the end there.
That's why they fade this twice first and then go so you can hide when you start.
When you begin and end the image that's behind.
But there it is.
But.
Don't forget to subscribe within a couple of clicks.
It's there and it's done, and you can then save that as a preset.
Sadly, not with the image behind.
But again, those kind of things will be updated and they always, always send out updates.
It's it's updated at least once a month.
What else do we have in here?
We have sharp elements.
So say you're talking about there.
So you're saying, oh, look at that baseline here.
Great.
Let's get back track that in and.
Bring it to the beginning.
Now, what is this doing?
This is painting.
Okay, let's click on Show Guide.
And this now shows handles of how to effect what you want.
And it shows the angle in which this arrow is being drawn.
So maybe we want to change the starting point of the position.
So just like over here, we have the X in the Y.
And we're now going to be affecting the beginning.
We don't need to be seeing those handles, but we start the beginning of this so we can drag this down.
Bring this over here.
And we can change the end point just the same way just by bringing that up there and bringing that back.
And then if we play that out.
A point right there and now.
If we leave that, I'm bringing in maybe one of those text boxes.
And I want it coming up this time.
An ad so we add to their.
Just with a couple of clicks what we can do.
It's.
Changed this text to maybe puzzle because that's what that is up on there.
And maybe bring that right speaking to that clip and move that little bit along.
And then all of a sudden.
Basil.
Just with a couple of clips, you're able to create something that would actually take take a lot of
time or at the very least, a lot of knowledge in another program.
I've done animations like this a lot and I've had to take the clip and then take it into after effects,
draw the stroke, animate over out and then bring that back into premiere pro.
Being able to do it within Premiere Pro, especially with something that's free of charge to use.
It's just it's brilliant.
I can't I can't recommend premiere composer from Mr. Horse Moore.
I really can't.
We have all these we have all these social media.
As I showed you, the shape elements are just we've even got circles, we've got curves, we've got
glitter.
There's there's custom lines and strokes, Tony, across.
I mean, seriously, so many things.
All these are sound effects that you can just use.
I mean, that's a bit scary.
You can change the pitch.
Or you can reverse it.
I mean, the ability the ability to add these in as well can really level up your your ability to paint
the pictures with the sound is called a soundscape and add to it all.
And there's so many sounds in here just straight up.
I mean, a safe high drone maneuver,
as you were, a small pop.
Now our pitch is at -12.
Should we see?
Yeah, that's a little bit better, if you like that kind of thing.
But as I said, all these are completely free within the starter pack.
Don't forget, there's a link in the worksheet for where to get this.
But yeah, that's premiere composer.
And out now you can see just why I've talked about it so much and little elements of it throughout this
whole course.
Because if you haven't got premiere composer installed into Premiere Pro limiting your ability so much
as an editor.
Next up, we're going to be talking about motion array.


### 3. Content Plugins - Motion Array

Now we're going to move on to another plugin, which I highly recommend them just delete those elements
in the app and this is a completely different plugin and using these two in conjunction is brilliant.
I'm just going to go to a blank space within this, this timeline and this is motion array now motion
array known throughout the industry, not not mainly because of their stock video, but because of their
template for motion graphics mainly.
But we have, as you can see here with the dropdown, we've got premiere pro templates, motion graphics
templates, premiere pro presets, stock motion graphics, stock video, stock photos, royalty free
music and sound effects.
There's a whole host in here, and each and every one of these titles means a lot.
So let's start from the top premiere pro templates and automatically you can see just what kind of things.
This plugin can do for you.
And this is a service, which is a subscription service.
So you pay each month and you have free reign of anything and everything in there.
Library.
Motion array are also under the same banner as Art List now and I'm going to look at Art List in in
another section.
But they're a very the same company and they both have similar models in as much as you pay a one off
subscription each month and for the entirety of the time they are subscription runs, you can download
not only the actual thing that you want to use, but it also comes with a license.
Not only that, but once you cancel your subscription, should you cancel your subscription, the things
that you've downloaded before then can continue to be used, but only in the projects that you downloaded
them for.
You can't use them again and again for different projects.
That's why if you've already saved, use this elegant design template.
If you wanted to use it again, you need to download it again.
You can effectively copy and paste it from sequence to sequence and project to project, but that's
not entirely legal.
And we're staying on the sides of legality here because there are so many ways in which you can trip
yourself up.
So let's have a look at one of these.
I'm just going to Tilda, and as you can see, we've got so many options to choose from.
This is just in the templates area.
I mean, there are so many things you can do here.
Let's view this one.
So as you can see, we've got the option to play it, the option to mute so we don't have the music
that's playing in the background.
And to download, let's just press play and see what we get.
Preview
next.
So as you can see, there's so many elements in this and everything that you're seeing, whether it
be the imagery, the text, even the sound in the background, this can all be edited and played it
with and it's literally it is packed full of these templates that you can use for anything that you're
looking for.
Let's say you what you're looking for a template for stories and stories.
And we've got templates here for so many different Instagram stories.
Let's play this one.
Now what you're seeing here is you're seeing an overall view of everything, but each and every one
of these elements will be six by nine or nine by 16.
Sorry, video which you can edit or the imagery or the text or the colors.
It's emotional day for these things have been going for years and you get the benefit of everything
that they've ever made and anything that they make in the future.
It's brilliant.
I love it.
I like the motion graphics templates as well because the motion graphics templates can bring in little
elements that you maybe not can't get from other places or can't make quick enough.
Let's say you've got a Black Friday sale coming up.
Let's say we're doing a quick video for the pizza oven that we've just done a video for.
Let's have a look at Black Friday.
You just pause this and mute this so I can talk over this.
So looking at this, this isn't all going to be on the screen on time.
This is showing you all the different elements that you can use in your project just by this one download.
There's so many elements that you may choose to bring in.
You know, let's get this downloaded and let's see what we can do in this.
So it's till they're out of here.
And as you can see, it's now saying it's downloading.
Well, as you can see, it's downloaded here.
We can install that template.
And what that will do is it will install it into our area of graphics.
Is that.
Essential graphics.
So we need to go to browse here now.
Quite often they come in to here, but these are actually bringing them.
So you can quickly view all these different elements right here.
Remember when we first looked into this essential graphics area?
We had other things that were here as well.
These were at the top.
But now that I've installed these these now at the top level, we do have a problem with fonts.
So let's deal with that.
Now, let's just go over there and sorry, I just hit on one of the places where it says there's a problem
with fonts.
We can go to info and it tells us the font in this are Montserrat Medium and Oswald heavy.
Not too sure if I have Oswald heavy.
I think that might be the problem.
Not Montserrat, but let's just bring one of these in here.
Not necessarily to use it, but I just want to get Oswald heavy that we have a problem with.
So how do we rectify that?
Well, if we go down here, we have other fonts that have been brought in about has been put in put
in instead of Oswald heavy.
Scroll down to see if I can find Oswald heavy here definitely isn't one of my fonts.
Okay, so we're going to go to Adobe Funds.
And so this is Adobe Fonts and this is why you can sort out a lot of your problems, which you may have
with fonts if we want to search for Oswald.
And there we have Oswald right here if we view the family.
They should be Oswald heavy somewhere along here.
Heavy regular.
Sometimes there's there's naming problems with regards to to some fonts and maybe it's actually Oswald
have irregular but it's only been saved as Oswald having so we want these fonts so I'm going to activate
all seven fonts and in the background all of those fonts will be downloaded and activated.
Just heard that.
I can't see it because it's off my screen, but that's now been activated within the program.
Used to be a lot bigger of a workaround, but now if we scroll down, we should be able to get Oswald.
Here there is Oswald and there's Oswald.
Heavy boom.
That's right.
If I undo.
Yeah, it does make a difference.
I guess so that we have and that's a graphic element that we have there ready to play with.
And just like with all other types of essential graphics, we've got all of the different elements that
we can change.
We can change the frame, the grocery cart, the car, the grocery cart color, the text, and it's
brilliant.
Let's go and see now that we've sorted that, although that's not really updated, let's see what we
do want.
Let's go back here and let's say we we're starting off at the beginning.
We're showing that maybe we want to show on that shot that we've got a Black Friday deal.
So let's see these in a bit so we can see what these are.
And just like before and if we scroll down and see what we fancy, we want to say it's an online Black
Friday, Cyber Monday deal.
So let's grab that and drag that into the project.
Oswald Harvey still a problem there but it's not this isn't sometimes a problem with premiere pro kind
of being up to date with everything.
Maybe because Oswald Heavy wasn't installed at the point that this was installed, a restart of Premiere
Pro was sort all those problems out.
But for now, let's just go along and select Oswald having let's play this out and see what it does.
Hmm.
As you can see, we're skipping frames a little bit here, but I really like that.
I'm going to play with that.
So let's get that way out of the way and connect to global controls.
And I'm going to this is the global size for everything.
So I'm going to bring that down a bit, maybe move it over to the side.
Bring it down a bit more.
This is quite an intensive a CPU and GPU intensive graphic.
So it may not be updating as much as it should do just because I'm also screen recording as well.
But just like before, what I want to do as I'm going to set an endpoint, an out point and although
the minute will make changes, that's all going to change again.
I'm going to pre render that right now.
So with that pre-rendered, I have a quick look through this.
And that looks it looks great.
To be able to bring something like this in.
And be able to effect it now have prevented this.
So the minute I start making any changes, it is going to near pre rendering again.
Again this is because I'm I'm screen recording so it's going to slow down everything but let's say rather
than Black Friday, we wanted to say maybe it's a summer.
Sale.
Now that's not updated there live.
You need to click out and and be that will affect that will go all caps here summer sale and that's
it's changed it for us now there will be kinds out there who will be looking for people who can provide
these kind of services are being able to least have.
We're back to that whole thing of a better starting position and having something that you can bring
in that you can then start to build on gives you the better starting position.
Because not only can we change obviously the text there, but we can change the global color.
So.
So you don't necessarily want it black, maybe you want it more of a gray.
Okay.
And that's affected the summer sale.
But if we are looking for other colors to change, if we scroll down, well, what's white?
Well, white on here is the screen.
I think I know that white is those texts.
So maybe we want to keep that there, but maybe not -70.
Maybe we want to dial the end and say, well, actually it's -70%.
Okay, so that's great.
But as you can see, it's kind of off the screen there, which is why we have this ability to scale
down that text, bring it down maybe a little bit more from 90 to 80.
Great.
We can see that.
That's perfect.
And then obviously we have other things like the word sale in here.
Maybe, maybe want to change that.
That's repeated three times in here.
Maybe we want to have a pizza in that to really sell the fact that that's what this is about.
You see how easily you can change all these different things.
And then we go into here and this is what I wanted to change.
I want to change these colors.
So we've got color one.
P.S. Now this is probably all the different elements within the PC, and this is where the color picker
can really come in handy.
So let's set a lighter gray first and foremost, and let's see what element that affects.
That affects it what looks like the global dark gray of that.
Let's see what this color affects.
It going to set red here just so it stands out.
Okay.
So that's the PC on here.
Okay.
So PC one PC to make sense.
Okay.
So let's give him maybe a kind of a hint of a blue that might be the brand color for your company and
then his torso, you know, okay, I'm happy with his stuff.
So being that dark color head, that's probably his hair.
So maybe let's give him a brown.
Where's brown?
In here.
Well, it's about here, isn't it?
So let's give him brown hair and beard that works at the circle.
So that's the circles.
So circle one, maybe we do it like a proper red.
I'm glad we've got this.
So I've selected a color which is right down here in the red.
However, we've got a warning triangle here.
So this red isn't necessarily what this refers to as broadcast safe.
And that's because although we're right down into red, what it feels like the IGP elements in the engines
behind TVs and monitors and all that kind of thing, that might be too much of a red to be safe in as
much as rendered accurately, which is why we have this warning triangle triangle coming up here.
And that will say this is the nearest hue, amber hues from the color correction, this is the nearest
hue for broadcast safe.
So I always err on the side of caution and as you can see, it's color picked just a little bit up further
to dark.
So okay, we're going to choose that red and press.
Okay.
And that changes the color of those circles circle too.
I want it to be the same color.
So rather than doing the same as we did before, we just get the color picker and pick that color from
there.
So that changes those colors.
Now, this frame, I'm assuming this frame is this call the hair one on one, about the same red.
And yeah, that changes that up.
So just for the few clicks, we've been able to change up that animation.
Now, should we take that one step further?
Yeah, I think we should, because I want to show you what else you can do with regards to this.
I want to bring the size back to where it was.
Can we do that?
Yeah.
So this would have been a look the option to reset.
But obviously I don't think we can.
But we know default size is 100 cricket.
However, these aren't, say, the right formula and although some.
That you bring down will give the option to reset.
We can't with it, but we do know that the default X and Y in 1080 is 1960 540.
Let's type them in and see if that works.
960 Tap.
540 Enter.
There we go.
Boom, we're on it.
So now that we've got this position, what I want to do is I want to start this maybe here just on top
of the letter box, and I want to scale this down.
Now, this template doesn't come with the ability to animate the animation, but I tell you what can.
Let's check this in.
I want him to come up there and just as though start to come in.
I want to animate this.
How do we do that?
Yep.
You guessed it.
We're going to toggle on scale and position key framing here.
I also want to set the anchor point.
Why?
Well, because I want to scale from the bottom here, but I want to be able to stay on this line.
So what I'm going to do is I'm gonna grab this anchor point and I drag this down, and I'm going to
put this anchor point pretty much on this line.
That means that whenever I scale it, I scaling it from there rather than from the center.
So I set my keyframes right there.
I'm going to drag it along a little and I'm going to scale this down.
And I'm also going to move it over to the side, which is where we had it before, which is about there.
And just like before.
I like those two interpretive appellation temporal interpolation and ease out.
Same here and ease in.
And you see how what we've learned before.
Can be used in conjunction with other things that didn't necessarily have them to begin with.
So let's prevent this out and see how it looks.
There's a little skip in time there, but I did actually stop screen recording at that point and the
pre render took seconds.
So I do know that a lot of this is being slowed down because I'm screen recording, but obviously if
I wasn't screen recording, you wouldn't be able to see this.
So let's have a look.
Now what we're finished with now that we've edited all these elements in here and we've actually keyframe
based.
So he grabbed the attention and then we pulled back down to the side as we continue with our footage.
And he will animate out because that's what the template does.
How good is that to be able to have those elements just literally at your fingertips, which you can
change up and color how you want?
And just a reminder, it looked like that's come out of the downloads and it looked like, can we get
it?
Can we find it?
It looked like that.
Just plain black and white to begin with.
And we've added color.
We've changed pretty much every element other than the white.
And we've now have something that's completely different, something that's just caught my eye that
we're going to look at next is this.
Which is glitch social media, lower third.
Let's have a look at this.
Love that I didn't have any music playing because it was.
It just has music on some of these, just to have music for the sake of it.
But let's download this template and let's see what this gives us.
So that's downloaded.
Again, don't need to install the template yet.
This is another one where we need to install the template.
So we're going to do that.
We're going to close that.
While that happens, Tilda out and go to Essential Graphics and to browse.
What was that called?
I think it started glitch, wasn't it?
It was glitch something.
This one that wasn't.
If I go to download again social media lower third click.
Okay, I check that because in my templates it comes as alphabetical.
So it's going to be somewhere down here.
And as social media, though, a third glitch I see all of a sudden we've got all of these.
Love it.
Right.
Should we try one?
Okay, let's let's really level it up.
And this looks like it's going to have some form of image as well.
So let's see how this is working.
Grab this and place it on our timeline.
That's now installed it and it's placed it back.
Good.
And I'm actually going to bring out this and move it over just so we're not playing with the letterbox
right now, because I don't want to overcomplicate things and we don't have the color correction anymore.
So I'm going to apply the color correction to this.
How do we do that?
That's our color correction.
I know all the information is in there, so I'm just going to copy that.
Select the clip, press P.
And I don't necessarily want the motion, but I do want to meet your color.
Boom.
We're in.
Good.
So I'm going to size this to the length of this template, and here we have it.
So.
What do we do?
Okay.
Well, let's first check what we want to do.
But how do we get an image into that?
Well.
Replace from Explorer.
So we go find an image.
Lets download an image emotion array.
Let's quickly go to stock photos and maybe go for Chef.
Do we have a chef?
We have a chef right there.
Like a pizza chef.
Let's tilt it in here.
Oh, I'm typing, Tilde.
Okay, let's Tilde in here.
And now we're looking at stock photos.
Does he look like he cook pizza?
He looks like a cook pizza, but he's holding a dessert.
Um.
He looks like he's making dough, doesn't he?
Okay, let's get him.
As you can see, we've got access to all this.
That means that it's currently.
Is he a better on this one?
Maybe down here.
You can see that this is a preview and that's a watermark.
However, the minute that we download once again, we are being granted a license, the minute we download.
And not only that, but it's automatically imported it inference seeing that we've got motion of.
That's what I was expecting before.
So we got motion, right?
Preparing homemade pizza.
And that's that image.
So how do we get that into here?
Well, we go back here, we go to essential graphics and we want to replace from Explorer.
So we need to find out where this has been saved.
Now, obviously, we could move this wherever we want, but let's just right click and reveal and explorer.
I can see let me make this a little bit smaller for you so everyone can see.
But what this has done is a lot more than you actually recognized at the time, because if you trace
this back through the through the breadcrumbs we've got preparing homemade pizza and we've got the picture
right there.
Motion array assets, which is with other motion array assets that we've downloaded, Black Friday and
Cyber Monday.
Social media, lower thirds glitch.
And it's also put it within the file structure.
We never created this folder motion array assets, but it's automatically put it in the area that our
project is.
That's clever, isn't it?
So let's go and navigate to that folder.
And here we are in our premiere pro folder, motion array assets, homemade pizza making.
And he was making pizza.
Oh I didn't notice that at.
I'm impressed and hit open.
So now that has brought that image into here and all of a sudden our chef is on that phone.
So what we want to do with this image, if we scale it up, as you can see, it's sized up quite some.
So let's control that and bring it down.
As you can see, this is locked up.
So 11% is 11% on the width as well.
It's kind of what you want.
I'm just going to take that if I don't even think we need to.
I'm quite happy with that size.
Yeah, let's leave that for now.
John Smith, do we reckon he's called John Smith?
I want to go more about, you know, that it's Italian.
So I have two cats and we decided that they're both called Italian names.
So what's called Gino?
I'm once called Giuseppe, so we're going to call him Gino Seppi.
I'm fully aware that that's quite the stereotype, but that's what we're going to go for.
Gino Seppi.
That's what he's called, and he's cooking your pizza.
And if we affected these positions, this position here can affect the text.
That's purely for the text.
So again, we can play around with the placing of everything depending if you've got more text, if
you've got a couple of lines or something.
I'm quite happy with that.
I'm going to say his Instagram profile is Gino Seppi.
Pete.
Maker.
Now.
Pizza chef.
That's making me feel better.
So he's the genius AP pizza chef.
I've put the underscores in here because that's the kind of thing you do here, but that's updated here,
all about design and more.
Now we're going to say loves pizza and so should you.
And you see just how easily this is affecting.
Now, what you can also see with regards to this is we have obviously a graphic of a phone on here.
We have a a color match that's been trimmed.
We have colors on the edge here, which is very much a gradient.
And as you continue to scroll down, there's loads of different things you can affect.
This follow will be the follow right there and you can change all the different areas and movements
and positions of hair in our colors here.
This right here, the purple and the orange will be this and I'm pretty sure that creates a gradient.
So you go from purple all the way through to orange.
Let's change that.
Let's go to our red now.
I want red, but I want proper broadcast.
Happy red so that purple is going to change to event.
Yeah, it does.
And the orange, we're going to change to a green because we're Italian and we've got the red.
We've got the green.
Once it decides to update good.
And we've got the white of our whole look that's in with the colors.
The blue here is obviously the blue that's been picked for Instagram.
So I'm going to leave that.
But as you can see, it's also affected that that green and that red has that this if I tilted this
on and it catches up the red and the green has also affected our Instagram and also the gradient going
around him as well.
So globally effects.
So I think it's time we kind of saw what this graphic actually does.
But before we do, it's a lower third, isn't it?
Let's place that where we actually want it.
I'm going to help up those colors.
And let's go back to the top.
And that's where I would expect everything to be.
But I don't think it's going to be no, I think it might be in the global settings at the bottom.
See, this is things that these are things that obviously that change depending on what template you're
using.
So here's your global settings right at the bottom and we can move, I'm assuming.
Yeah, that's moved it far too far.
So let's undo that.
And yeah, okay, that's where we want.
But then scale it down first just so we're at the right position and there's a y y position that's too
far up a little bit.
I'm going to bring the I'm going to bring it round here and going to track that after I say my system
is really slowing down quite so because of death.
But yeah, that's good enough.
I'm just going to pre render just before we play it back.
So with that pre-rendered, let's have a look at exactly what we get.
Love that.
So it glitches as it comes in and glitches as it goes out.
And you see how this is ethos.
So you've got at the moment, it starts as it comes out of a glitch.
We have that gradient which takes up a lot of space and then creates just the end stroke.
And then on the way out.
It does everything in reverse.
And if we shorten this up and it did another quick prevent that just to to save time they're clever
and in and because we've shortened it up and this is fully responsive.
If I get back to the beginning and play again.
It will animate out at that point as well, not just cut off.
And one thing to throw in here.
Remember when we when we were rendering output for control m to export out.
Remember when I when I was talking about it using previews.
If you have that pre-rendered something that is quite intensive, something like this.
This would be a good time to say yes.
Use previews because what that will then do is rather than trying to re encode and re render this again,
which will take which will add this something, this graphic intensive, rather, it's having to re
render all this once more.
What it will do is it will use the preview that you've already rendered out.
So it should speed up your time.
Now, what I have noticed, and this is something that you do need to keep an eye out for, is there's
a little bit of a line of text there.
And if I come out, it's definitely with this and we move globally.
So everything moved over.
However, if I tilde to see more this says NFT artist, 3D designer, that sometimes is a way that designers
will get their name into a project even if it's not supposed to be.
Can be quite annoying, but it's not just with motion rights with it's with a lot of a lot of things
like this.
You just need to double check because your client doesn't really want anything like that coming up.
And the thing is this, when it was first in was full, full size here and it was probably off the screen.
But now that you've brought it down to where you would normally have it, you kind of want to double
check and get rid of that.
It's a little bit frustrating, but that's where that is right there.
You just delete that text and click out and that will disappear from here.
And yeah, you just need to be a little bit aware of that because that can be really quite frustrating
sometimes.
It's it's the original design who's put it in themselves just to maybe get that little bit of notoriety.
But yeah, so that is an amazing graphic.
As you can imagine.
It stands out and it was done completely, including the image of our chef GOP, all from motion.
Right.
So we've touched on the motion graphics templates there.
I've still got Chef in here.
So we can actually see all the things because you can search not just in images, but in all of these
by keyword.
So if I tilde on here and just going to mute that for now, but this is in motion graphics templates
and.
It's going to do that again.
We've got a load of other things that we can bring in.
All of these elements can be used in your project, should you wish.
It's so content and value rich and you just you have so much to choose from.
So that's in the motion graphics templates in Premiere Pro Presets.
Let's have a look what we have here.
So okay, let's just start playing something and seeing how it looks.
We've got HDR look effects here.
I'm going to just mute that and play that.
So this looks like it's a series of lots, creative lots that we can download.
So it's shown before and after.
Let's quickly download this and see how it looks when we get it down again.
You go.
You can just you can download and install as much as you want because it's unlimited with your subscription.
If I install preset, okay, this is a proper preset and we saw where it was saved there.
So the easiest way to get a new preset in here is a queue of two effects next to your project PIN and
in Presets, just right click and Import Presets and it's taken a straight into where we were before.
Here's our HDR look effects and as you can see, we can see that file, which means it's a premiere
pro preset and we hit open.
And but now has installed into here for premiere pro are the way in which we find that is if we twirl
down our presets we now have HDR look effects right here and if we click in here and start looking down,
we can see so many effects that were allowed, which is effectively it's another version of a lot how
to go cinematic.
And as you can see, we're given an example of what it will look like depending on where our play head
is.
So say we wanted this look, we've just downloaded it.
We can grab that and drag it on.
And that has colored that effect.
And what that will do is that's actually added on top of altimetry.
Color correction.
So if we take out the metric, that will affect that as well.
So you see what we were seeing here right at the beginning was an idea of how it would look with regards
to the clothes on there at the moment.
And again, there's so many in just that one download, there's so many styles.
But you can use just by that one download.
Let's go back here and see what else we can get.
We were in the premiere Pro Presets.
Uh, what else we have?
So we have more transition presets, which obviously we had in Premiere Composer.
We've got seamless transitions.
It's a load of transitions that you can download to be used in so many different ways.
Text Animator What's this?
Love that.
So that in and out presets is great to say.
So if you're in Premiere Composer and you're even in text presets and you think, okay, yeah, they.
None of those really kind of work for me.
Jump off to motion, Ray.
And maybe that's the kind of preset you were looking for.
Say, we've got more transitions here.
Zoom and camera hit.
I saw a lot of presets in premiere pro are covering really it's it's mainly like transitions and looks
and looks and all that kind of stuff.
So that was just normal.
And now this is showing you the variety of transitions we've got.
See how it goes in the letterbox like.
Like we've done before.
Brilliant.
To actually automate that would take a long time yourself.
But there are so I mean, look at everything that you've got here.
Brushstroke.
What's that?
That looks quite cool.
Works with any font.
I like that.
Let's get that one down.
Let's see what that does.
So again, we're downloading.
What was that?
It's telling me that it's said titles, animated brushstroke in the preset.
Okay, so we know that that's there.
So we're going to tilt out of here, go back to our presets and import presets.
And it was titles animator brush stroke going to the preset and open that within that.
And now we know that that's going to be installed.
So we scroll to we will down the presets will back up the HDR looks for now and there's the title animator
brush stroke and that's our title brushstroke animator.
And because this is a preset, we can't just drag it in because it doesn't actually contain anything.
What we need to do is we need to create some form of text.
So onto here, we're going to hit the the type tool.
And once again, we're going to type in here and we're going to type pizza.
Good.
Happy with that?
Going to make it a little bit bigger.
Just so we say bigger or longer so we can actually see what we're doing.
Go into the essential graphics and let's go for.
Yeah, you know where we're going.
No, esta.
And I'm just going to size this up ever so slightly.
It's taking a bit to catch up.
Is the system right now, it's running a little bit slow again because we've got so much running on
that.
So now if we twirl down from the titles animator, we now have a variety of in styles.
So let's I'm just going to grab one for random six and how does this look?
Okay.
Let's just size up that text a little bit so we can see it better.
Pizza.
I'm just going to center it and censor it.
Good.
And I'm just going to pre-rendered this again.
My system is struggling a little bit at the moment with the amount of different graphics that are currently
running in this project, which is why it's always really handy to pre render because then you're giving
your system at least a fighting chance.
Let's have a look what this looks like.
Love it.
You wouldn't get that from anything else.
The.
And if you then cut that and put something else on, I'm going to get rid of this, which is the that
preset going to take that out?
I'm going to put something else and maybe an out.
Let's do six out as well.
And check that out a little bit and let's once again pre render.
You get very used to pre rendering and you quite often use this as an opportunity to take a drink of
water or just a little breath.
So we've got six in here, six out here.
Let's see what we got there.
Cool.
So a wiping in the same direction.
Looks great.
How about if we shorten that?
Okay, shorten it right up.
So it's almost like a wipe.
That's in and out.
Control enter to pre render everything.
Let's have a look how that looks like from pluck.
So that doesn't quite work.
What we need to do is we need to reapply.
So I guess the timing can work correctly.
Pre render.
And let's just check.
And that wipes all the way out.
And now we've got a piece of text.
That wipes in a way that you normally wouldn't and wipes out great.
And that's literally just from downloading from here.
Let's see what else we can get from motion.
Okay.
We've got stuck motion graphics, which opens up a whole host of stuff.
So you get into weddings and you want the ability to.
Maybe throw a few flowers around and make it all look really pretty.
As you can see, 50 floral elements that can all be just brought in and just dropped onto your project.
Just to add a little bit more, what's this more stop motion?
So this is actually a 3D render.
That's brilliant.
Imagine if you're starting some kind of series where you're looking at the planets or some kind of interplanetary
travel.
It's perfect.
The brilliant thing about this is, and I can't overstate this, but not only you downloading these
so easily, but you're getting the license to use them.
And that is half the battle.
When a client comes to you and says, Ah, do you mind if I kind of have this or that?
Let's say you have a client who deals with dentistry.
Well, okay.
What can we offer them?
Well, nothing in stop motion animation.
Maybe if you could spell dentist, that would be better.
Well, yeah, we've got a whole lot.
I mean, there's literally there's lots of stuff that looks like it's a 3D render.
We've got.
This which.
Maybe your dentist replaces Buck Tooth for good teeth.
Well, that's already made for you.
Dental implants.
We've got a dentist client who deals with dental implants.
To get something made like this.
Would cost a fortune.
I know because I've commissioned other editors to do similar well in dentistry, in the beauty industry,
but it's cost between three and £400 to get just something as simple as that, mate.
And I mean, look, we've got you've got everything.
Say it's a bar that you're doing some videos for.
Maybe that doesn't quite work as well.
Maybe if we pop.
Good.
Then we've got cans.
How about if we pop beer?
I mean, just having that kind of thing in the background, trying to sell a new beer that's coming
out or, you know, a thirsty Thursday.
That would be a great background to put up on the you see how many things we've got here and that's
just in stock motion preset if we put in here on pop bar.
I mean this is just stuff video.
Imagine if you've.
You're trying to make some form of video and you're in a bar.
You've got all your footage, and it's not quite right.
And maybe you need this shot.
Perfect.
In fact, I can give you for instance, I had an edit quite recently.
It was for a guy who does it is private wine tours or wine tastings, and there was a tour that they
went on that we weren't available to shoot.
So he took a gimbal offers and I did it all on his on his phone or got some footage that we could use.
But then when we got to the edit, I really wanted some kind of vineyard footage, so I literally searched
for vineyard.
And the funny thing is, was this one no, I'm trying to find it was this one.
And one of the vineyards that they actually visited was the shop and vineyard, which is down south,
and it was the southwest of south east, but here in the UK.
So I was able to use this footage.
And I showed it to the client and he noticed the building right at the end.
And he said.
Did you go down to shop him and get that footage?
Now, I don't have a drone license.
I don't have a drone license for commercial use.
And I said, well, no, I was just able to get the stock footage.
I mean, that was a lucky, lucky thing to be able it was a happy accident.
I like to call.
But the fact that I was looking for footage over a vineyard in the U.K. and the stock footage that came
available was literally the vineyard that they've been to.
But, I mean, look at the amount of stuff that is on here just for Vineyard.
And you've got I mean, you from the vineyard to the glass, you've got the footage there just to use.
And again, you can use all this commercially.
It's all to be use.
So whether you're doing it for a client or you're making videos on YouTube that you want to monetize,
I use this as well.
I actually took this footage.
I reversed it.
And then had a the transition of panning go up for now panning.
And I did that transition.
Which brought you into this and it looked all intended.
It's brilliant.
I love motion array.
I really do.
We touched on stop photos again.
We're still in Vineyard, so we could use a load of images from this if we need to.
But if I look for a dentist again, I mean, you know, these are all images that you can use commercially.
And their licence straightaway the minute that you download them.
And finally, we have royalty free music and sound effects.
And I mean, dentist is just there right now.
But if we clear that up very similar to artless, because these are now under the same company, you
can literally search whatever you want.
Let's say you're looking for something Italian to go with our pizza.
Again, it helps if you can actually spell Italian.
And that's how a little cooking with smile.
Maybe this could be a happy accident.
What we need.
Preview.
You had preview there because it's it's an audio mark, like a watermark for audio.
But the minute that I download it, I can now use it whether I was going to use it and I had to download
it because I'm playing it to you.
But if I go into my downloads that's now being downloaded, it will automatically think automatically
it will important my project and if I come into motion, right, cooking with the smile, there it is.
And there's my music and literally staying right in within premiere pro I'm able to get straight here
and.
Unmute.
And now cooking.
With the smile, as my music says.
I can't overstress just how much these all of these have both of these plugins bring to your workflow
and how much they open up.
They will.
Not only do they save you time, but they open up the creativity that you can apply to your projects
because you are not being held by what you're able, not only what you're able to do, but what you're
able to think about.
If you're just looking for for for some kind of inspiration, stock video, pizza making.
Okay.
Well, I'm getting an idea now of.
Okay, well, that's a two time lapse of dough rising.
Maybe you want to tell that story or you come here for inspiration before you go to a shoot and think,
okay, how did they shoot that?
And if I can't quite get it, well, the system is the whole set up.
Where I'm going to shoot is very similar to this.
But if I can't quite get a shot of the wood fired pizza, well, I know I have got bar on the backburner.
Excuse the pun, if I need it.
Using the right plug in at the right time can make the whole difference for you and really level up
your ability to provide for yourself in your own videos and also for your clients.

## 19 Captions (Subtitles)
### 1. Hardcoded vs Sidecar Subtitles and Why to Create Them

Well, time waits for no one.
And on we move with the next part, which is captions or subtitles.
What are they?
Well, very, very simply, you'll have seen subtitles or captions at some point during your viewing
life, and they are words that come up on screen to add as a transcript to what's being said in the
scene.
With regards to what we've been building since the beginning, what the dialogue will be will be the
voiceover that we recorded if I mute off the music and play it back.
When we think of outdoor cooking, we think back to nature.
So it's that kind of thing.
And there are a number of reasons why you would want subtitles.
So I'm first going to tell you the two different versions that we're going to be dealing with.
It's a whole different industry.
It's subtitles.
But the the the way in which Premiere Pro have now incorporated being able to create subtitles in the
program is so much less clunky and so much easier than days gone by.
Which is why I am more than happy to spend this time talking about them.
That said, if it did take a lot longer, we'd still do it.
It would just take a lot longer and more time out of your course.
There are two different versions of captions or subtitles that you can have in a video primarily, and
that is hardcoded and sidecar.
Now, the creation of the subtitles is exactly the same, regardless of whether you go into a hard code
or have them as a sidecar file.
However, it's when we get to the end to the export.
If I bring up this dialogue, remember in in this dialogue we had before and we had this idea for captions,
it's grayed out at the moment because there's not a captions track.
But this is where we would change what we're doing with regards to the captions, actually.
Yeah.
It would be in export options and quite simply, sidecar and hard coding literally mean whether you
end up with one file or two if you are hard coding.
It's also known as burning in and what it's effectively doing is it's rendering the video with the subtitles
on the screen permanently, just as if it was some form of text bringing that answer here.
It was that kind of text.
It's that whenever we bring in this kind of text, this is hard coded.
This is text, a graphic effectively when you boil down.
But this is a graphic element.
That's a text that is designed to be on the screen at the time of viewing.
So that's hard coding and that's what you would do on the export options.
And that would be if you're playing it back somewhere where you definitely want the subtitles showing.
That's usually if you're doing a video to playback on social media.
And although Facebook and now Instagram do have an option to put in an SRT file or a sidecar file,
a lot of producers still opt with just setting it the subtitles in there.
Why did they do that?
Well, recent studies show that most people on a mobile will watch video when they're scrolling through
social media, when they're on a commute, whether on a train or a bus or even just in a public area,
like a coffee shop or even at work.
And that's why you want to make sure that they get the the message that you want to get across in the
video.
And while they can't hear the music, they can at least get what's being spoken.
So that's why you would want to that's the event that you'd want to hard code in your captions.
The other option is SRT.
And as I said, that's a sidecar file.
And what that serves us as is a reference file to the video for wherever it's playing back.
Now that may be on say VRC player on a computer.
It could be in a number of other media players on a computer or a PC or Mac or anything like that.
And you can select a captions track.
However, most people would want that because you can upload the SRT or subtitle track separately when
you're uploading to, say, YouTube.
So now all of a sudden the viewer doesn't have to watch with the subtitles on.
If they don't want to, they can click the cog in YouTube and select.
See the subtitles, the captions.
And what that can do is it can overwrite what YouTube has been doing in recent years, and that is to
auto generate the text.
Now the problem with that is that it's not necessarily accurate and you can auto generate the wrong
text.
We'll see that when we actually create these captions.
But the beauty in doing it in Premiere Pro rather than in YouTube is that you can edit it or at least
edit it much easier.
Not only that, but an accurate captions file in a YouTube video allows Google who run YouTube to use
every single bit of text that's in the video as part of a search term.
So it adds to the metadata of the video.
So that would be why you would want to have an SRT file.
So those are the difference.
Hot coding built right into the image SRT file.
The end user, the end viewer can toggle on and off as they show wish, and whether you want to create
them or not, all depends on where this is being outputted to.
And if you need to build in accessibility.
So for those actually hard of hearing, which obviously is what captions was originally designed for,
it's just the modern world that we live in with regards to social media and mobile social media that
has called upon us using this already well-established form of getting the spoken word over when it
can't be heard.
So those are the two different versions of, say, subtitles and why we may create them.
We're now going to move on and show you how to create subtitles as easily and as quickly and Premiere
Pro.


### 2. How to Create Subtitles

How to create subtitles.
Well, as you can imagine, as we've already done a number of times so far in Premiere Pro, this calls
for a new window.
Yeah, it does.
It calls for the text window, which can be found appear window and text.
If you select that, it will pop up somewhere and you can duck it.
However, I have another workspace called Captioning and that is literally everything that I need for
captioning.
Okay, so we've got the reference monitor right here where we can see the video.
We've got the timeline, although pushed over to the right a little bit.
And here we have our text area.
We have a transcript.
We have captions.
Ammy also have graphics.
Now in here, this is showing there all the different graphics that we currently have in this timeline,
which is actually all the stuff over here for captioning.
We don't really need to deal with graphics.
So as you can see, we now in the captions area and we give them the option to transcribe a sequence,
create a new caption, text track or import captions from file.
So say you're working on something that someone has already done and you want to hardcoded the the already
established subtitles.
They will have an SRT or a text file and that's how you would import it.
But in this we're going to start from scratch and create it ourselves.
Over here is the transcript, which we will be given.
We will be taken to this point automatically when we do what we're doing in here.
So couple of bits of housekeeping.
First, I've muted off the music already.
There's no real need to do that, but I'm just doing it anyway.
I'm also going to set an output to here because that's the last bit of text that we want to be looking
at.
What has come around quite recently with regards to Premiere Pro, not only is this a whole new way
of creating subtitles and captions, but also within this run about version 1.4, 1.5.
And they've added a couple of other things.
So first and foremost, to make it easy for us, I'm going to go to the audio space and remember when
we selected an audio file and we said it was dialogue.
What I'm going to do is go back in here and I'm just going to make sure that it's all dialogue.
If it's not, let me just clear audio tape and we click on an audio clip and we're in the audio area
with the essential sound.
It's giving us the option to say what it is dialogue, music, SFX, sound effects or ambience.
So rather than just have one selected, I'm going to select them all and I'm going to mark them as dialogue.
So we're back to where we started when we first came into this area.
I just wanted to recap that, just to make sure that we've got the files selected as we want them,
because let's go back over to the captioning area.
And again, this isn't default.
I have created this space, but you know how to create your workspaces by now.
And if not, you can refer back to chapter.
Wow, that's quite a way back.
That wasn't it.
You can refer back to chapter two, mainly 2.2 and 2.3 for understanding the layout and setting up Premiere
Pro, which then goes on to explain the windows and how to set up the space, which is .2.4.
So that's the technique that I use to set up this space.
And once it's done, as I said in that original time that went through, once it's done, it's done,
and you never have to think about it again as long as you are sinking your settings right down here
and sync settings now.
So do that while I'm thinking about it, my preference and I'm uploading my settings, that was a bit
of a timely reminder.
I don't think I'd sync to my settings since we came back online earlier in the course.
So now that we are here, I now want to create captions.
My endpoint is set here and my output is set here.
So before we transcribe a sequence, we need to create a new caption track.
If you look down here on the actual timeline, we've got video here and we've got audio here.
But if we look over here, there's CC caption track options and it's grayed out.
We can't do anything with it, and that's because we don't have a caption track.
However, if we create a new caption track, we're saying that the format is subtitle.
You can have different styles if you decide to set them up.
I find that the default is absolutely perfect and works brilliantly for everything I do.
I'm going to show you in a few chapters time where I've used this in other projects and yeah, it's
so easy and it looks so professional, but you'll see in this one as well.
That's.
Okay to create that new caption track.
And now if I tell you this, you can now see if I think this down a little bit.
Bring this down maybe.
No, we can't bring that down.
Used to be able to.
That's fine.
We now have a subtitle track going along the top here and we have our video and audio till that back
out.
And as we can see, there's our subtitle track so that we are all ready to go and ready to create our
captions.
So we now need to create a transcription and this is where we use Adobe's service because the heavy
lifting of the, the voice recognition isn't done on your computer, it's done on Adobe's servers using
Adobe Sensei and that's, that's running through all the whole suite now which is brilliant.
It does a lot of automation for you.
Again, we'll touch on Adobe Sensei a little bit later on.
So we're going to create our transcription and we can see this button here with a cloud and a up arrow.
So it goes without saying, but you need to be connected to the internet to be able to do this.
Let's move on, create transcription.
So going to click that and now it's going to bring up this option.
Now the sequence length is 3 minutes and 29 seconds, which is way beyond that because of all the other
stuff we've got.
However, remember when I said, let us select these as dialog?
Well, I can then say.
Audio clips.
Tag this dialogue.
Easy as anything.
What that will do rather than audio on a track say it's already on a track and that's track one.
Brilliant.
Well, video is audio track one.
Because remember, we label that as VEO and great that will do all of the dialogue for all of that track.
However, what happens if you've got different people speaking on different audio tracks?
That's why we have the option to.
Analyze.
Use the audio analysis to analyze all clips tagged as dialogue that helps us rather than just stay on
one track.
This wasn't originally an option in this version.
Point one.
Another way in which we can help the whole system not look at absolutely everything is we set our endpoint
out point.
We're going to transcribe endpoint to our point only.
So it's not looking for anywhere else that's got dialogue, which there isn't, but just in case and
we're not going to merge output with existing transcription because we don't have an existing transcription.
However, if you'd already run this once before and you needed to add more text, this is when you would
merge output with existing transcription because where you have this C one, that's captions one, you
can have caption to caption three caption for however only one caption track can be live at any one
time.
So it's worth bearing that in mind if you have to come back and create more subtitles, merging output
with existing transcription will really help.
And here you can opt in to recognize when different speakers are talking.
That's really good when you've got more than one person talking and you can highlight who is who, it
will recognize who is who, and you can name each of those speakers.
It's just the a reference.
When you go back into here, it's a lot easier.
Now let's go down to this section and read this carefully.
When you use this feature, your audio files will be processed and transcribed automatically in the
cloud.
This process cannot be cancelled.
Once sent for transcription, there's nothing really to worry about with that.
I think it's just them covering themselves legally.
Really.
So yeah, once it started, it can't be stopped until it's finished.
So as long as we're all happy with that, let's hit transcribe.
And as you can see, this is uploading the audio to server.
It's gone there.
It's now transcribing the sequence.
It keeps you updated all the way through.
And you can imagine if you've got a very long sequence, this can take quite some time.
But in this instance, because we're literally well under a minute and the actual amount of text, if
we punched all this up, were probably way below 45 seconds.
It doesn't take any time at all.
So what have we got?
We've got here we've got all the text that has been auto generated, which we're going to look through
and we've got the name of the speaker.
It's unknown at the moment because we didn't opt in.
Also, we don't really need to name it because it's just me.
It's only one speaker.
So what do we do now?
Well, we play back and we see where we're at.
So let's go back to the beginning.
Press home on here.
And as we play, this will highlight the word that it thinks it's saying in here.
It's really quite clever.
Let's play back and let's see how well it's done.
When we think of outdoor cooking, we think back to nature.
Log fires, open flames, and a good char on the food being served.
So far, so good.
That is why our biggest focus for our products is making sure you get that authentic wood fired taste.
Okay, so there's a little bit of a skip there, wood fired and it says to taste.
We don't want that.
So what we're doing is going to double click into here and wood fired should be hyphenated.
So I'm going to delete that and put a hyphen in that.
We don't need the word two in there, so let's just delete that click out.
And this is highlighted.
Let's press spacebar to continue playing wood fired to taste happy.
Moving on when it comes to pizza, making our number okay so that shouldn't have a comma.
It's pizza making.
So we're going to go in here and delete that and press that.
It could be hyphenated, I guess, but we're not going to bother.
Pizza making our number one pizza oven is the go to family choice.
Okay.
So this is in the words, but actually the number one pizza oven is actually a title.
So I'm going to here and now we don't have to worry about full stops or periods or anything like that.
So that's what that's called.
That should be a capital that should be a capital click back out.
And career number one pizza oven is the go to family choice we have go to should be hyphenated as well
so we can see how easy this is to just change the text.
Never, ever, ever used to be this easy.
Go to family choice.
We have carefully designed the oven so that there is a perfect flow of heat throughout and you can be
cooking in as little as 15 minutes.
That's brilliant.
That's spot on.
Oven is highlighted here.
But I think that's because it's just a little bit of query.
The server possibly thought is that oven or is another word it was it was oven spartan that's count.
The steel pizza base.
That's correct as well.
It just doesn't.
Doesn't know if that was the spelling of steel we want because obviously we've got S.E.A.L.
As in to take without consent.
Oh, that sounds quite legal.
Carrying up is different from the traditional stone used in most ovens, as we believe from rigorous
testing that this gives you the perfect crisp base to your pizza.
I was just about to say the commas in here are perfect.
They're exactly where they should be.
However, I'm going to put another comma in here as well.
Perfect comma.
No, not full stop.
Perfect comma, crisp base to your pizza.
And that's it.
That's everything.
Check through.
I promise you.
It's never.
It's.
It's never normally that easily.
It depends who speaking.
Obviously, I was speaking on a voice of a microphone right here and do my best to be nice and clear.
Sometimes you've got at it with clients or people who are speaking, who are almost mumbling, and it
gets only about 50 to 60% accurate.
But as you can see, it's so easy to come in here and change that text about.
So that's not our captions, that's our transcripts, that's the transcription of the talking.
We now need to create our captions.
And because we have our captions track created, let's just create them.
This brings up this create the sequence create from sequence.
Transcript.
Yes, that's what we want to do.
Subtitle Default.
I want the format to be subtitle.
If we click in here, there are loads of different types of subtitle depending on where you are.
However, these days that's not really so important because pretty much everything is online viewing,
so that's all good style.
Again, you could have a style that you've saved, but again, I'm happy with that in here.
You kind of this is per personal preference, these are actually the defaults, but I'm quite happy
with these.
So the maximum length in characters is 42 characters per caption that's on the screen at any one time
and the minimum duration in seconds is three.
Those two values are kind of what's been set up through brand standard or industry standard as to what
the human eye can can read in a certain amount of time and how long it needs it on screen to be able
to easily get it.
That makes sense.
Good.
And finally, we can the options of single or double lines.
Personally, I believe in the thought that rather having one single line that goes all the way along
the bottom, having the ability to have double lines, keeps the viewer's eye right in the middle.
Isn't it crazy that we we think of these things even with regards to video editing?
It's it really is.
It's so many jobs in one.
But with all that in mind, I'm quite happy with all those settings.
So let's create our captions.
As you can see, it's now created within seconds.
It's done.
Now, already I'm looking here and I can see there's times where there's just one word and all that.
So now that we've created these captions, you can see them on screen.
We now need to go back now.
This is now started doing something new that I didn't ever did before.
And, you know, at the very beginning when we created the captions track.
Hmm.
It's overwritten that captions track with caption, too.
So maybe you don't need to do that now from the beginning.
However, the good thing is it's done it so I can show you that because caption to C2 is being created.
Caption one has been turned off.
And the minute I turn on C one, C two is turned off.
So that highlights the rule that I told you that you can only have one captions track on at any one
time.
Why is that?
Well, that's because.
Because you have the option to merge captions with pre-existing captions.
You can have the same language on one track.
And if you look here, we could have maybe English on C, one, French on C, two, Italian on C three
for the pizza's, Spanish, German all the way down in Mandarin.
And you could have all your different languages just laid out and then just render out each version
depending on which language you're looking to caption.
That's that's probably the best case use for that option to be able to switch and only being able to
have one caption track live at any one time.
So what do we do from here?
Well, we go right back to the beginning and we start playing through keeping an eye on here and here
at the same time as to what's being shown on screen and what is actually being reflected here.
If I make this a little bit taller, I'm just going to spread this out a little bit so we can kind of
see where we're working and hit spacebar to playback.
When we think of outdoor cooking, we think back to nature.
I'm happy with that.
That looks good.
Log fires, open flames and a good char on the food being served.
Okay, so I personally don't necessarily want those two to be separated.
So what we can do is, as you can see, this has created all our captions as graphics.
So I'm going to select this one, hold down shift and select this one.
As you can see over here, these two are now selected.
And what we can do is we can either merge or split so we don't have split.
So let's merge the captions.
And all of a sudden we have them all on the same caption, however, all on the same line.
So I want to drop that down.
So we double click into here and we decide where we want to start the second line.
And a good char, maybe we'll do it there.
So delete to bring that back into and it updates automatically on here.
Click out somewhere and that's now been committed fires, open flames and a good char on the food being
served.
I'm happy with that.
Now it does continue and it holds it on screen for a while.
I don't really want that.
Let's read it back and let's see where we then want the text to come off because we want this effect
to be really clear as well.
Log fires, open flames and a good char on the food being served.
I'm happy with it to actually go out at the time that the video goes out so we can pull this back just
as if it was any other kind of graphic object and it'll go off or play this and carry our food being
served.
That is why our biggest focus for our products is making sure you get that authentic wood fired taste.
Okay, there's a couple of things I want to do here.
I don't think that this really works on two lines.
I prefer it on the bottom line in the letter box.
So I'm going to go in here and I'm going to delete that and hit space to give some space between those
two words.
And as you can see, it defaults to the bottom.
It doesn't default to the top line, even though it's at the top line in this area.
It defaults to the bottom.
Happy with that?
Looks good.
And in this next bit, we have taste.
Sitting there all on its own.
Biggest focus for our products is making sure you get that authentic woodfired taste.
So what we're going to do.
Yeah, we're going to merge them.
Select them both.
And no, we're not going to split, idiot.
We're going to merge.
And we have all of those words in one.
Let's play that back.
A product's is making sure you get that authentic woodfired taste.
Now I think we actually need a comma with authentic woodfired because those are two descriptors.
So I didn't pick that up on the first time, but we can easily go in here and edit that now.
And now we have.
That is why our biggest focus for our products is making sure you get that authentic woodfired taste.
And that goes off the screen at the right point.
I'm quite happy for that.
Did you notice, though, wherever you select on here, the play had goes to the beginning, so it starts
playing from the beginning of that caption.
Log fires, open flames.
So that's a really good way to make sure that your playback is playing back from where you want you
not having to drag this play head along again.
That's another feature that was added to this version.
So it's clear taste.
When it comes to pizza, making our number one pizza oven is the go to family choice.
There's a lot of words there, isn't it?
Making our number one pizza oven is the go to family choice.
Okay.
So I'm going to do a little bit different here.
I'm going to split this one and I'm going to add parts of it to the one before.
The easiest way to do that is to find the timing when it comes to pizza, making our number one pizza
oven right there.
So I'm going to split back here and just have it with is the go to family choice.
So first and foremost, because of this one, which is the one that we want to split and let's split
there and it will split at the plate head.
See that.
So we now got two versions of this.
Now we know that in this section and this one is the go to family choice.
That's all we want is the go to family choice.
So we'll double click into there and delete everything before is happy with that.
Let's go back here.
Now, we don't we don't now need is the go to family chase because we know that that's not actually
being said of underneath this graphic.
So we'll double click that.
And similarly or in direct contrast, will delete that bit of text.
Also, what we're going to do is we're going to merge these two thumbs to pizza.
Making our number one pizza oven is the go to family.
Thing is, we could easily put those both on the same line and that would work when it comes to pizza.
Making our number one pizza oven is the go to family choice.
That's good, but I think there's too much changing at one time.
And it might be harder for the the viewer to follow all that text if they're watching silently.
So we're going to select them both and we're going to merge those.
However, they're both on the same line.
So just click in here and I'm going to delete and enter.
So now we've got no space at the end here and we've got two and two lines going up on pizza oven is
the go to family choice.
We have carefully designed the oven so that there is a perfect flow of heat throughout and you can be
cooking in as little as 15 minutes.
Okay.
So as you can see, we could easily pace this a lot better.
We could have it.
So we have heat throughout in this.
A perfect flow of heat throughout.
Good.
I'm going to just do this manually now and I'm going to come in here because you can now, we're going
to change that to they're going to change that there.
And I'm going to put the word throughout in here.
Similarly, I'm going to take out the word throughout from here.
Delete that up and let's just check if that works.
Okay.
We have carefully designed the oven so that there is a perfect flow of heat throughout and you can be
cooking in as little as 15 minutes.
And now I'm going to merge these two because I think that's that's one of the big us pays that the unique
selling point for this and I think having both those bits text on at the same time is not only correct
for how we're using the the captions here, but also it really helps the selling point because it's
on the screen at the same time.
So we're going to merge these two and I'm going to drop down from in.
But we have carefully designed the ovens so that there is a perfect flow of heat throughout and you
can be cooking in as little as 15 minutes.
Good.
Happy with that?
Maybe that maybe the captions are for a little bit too long minutes.
When we get it out there, I will show you.
The steel pizza base is different from the traditional stone used in most ovens, as we believe from
rigorous testing, that this gives you the perfect crisp base to your pizza.
Okay, so that's a lot of words in this one and this one.
So again, this is this is kind of personal choice, but let's just have a play back and you just watch
kind of what I come up with.
The steel pizza base is different from the traditional stone used in most ovens.
Okay, so I'm going to go here and I'm going to I'm going to split that and I'm going to get rid of
use the most as we believe, because I think that's nicer from now on from this.
But the steel pizza base is different from the traditional stone used in most oven.
The base is dipped.
The steel pizza base is different.
I'm going to split that by you.
See, if I split it here, it splits it here as well.
The steel pizza base is different from the traditional stone used in.
Okay, so I'm going to get rid of the steel pizza base.
Pizza base is different from the.
Yeah, so I'm going to have different on its own.
So if we get rid of that piece of text, bring that up, we're going to go into the first one and get
rid of the other text, which is from the traditional stone.
Delete that is there.
The steel pizza base is different from the traditional stone used in most ovens.
I'm going to now select those two and merge them two.
I think we're going to keep them on that line.
But obviously we have a duplicate now of this text used in most ovens.
So we're going to hear and delete, delete and start that again.
The steel pizza base is different from the traditional stone used in most ovens, as we believe from
rigorous testing that this gives you the perfect crisp base to your pizza.
Okay, I'm going to continue that because we are a single line here towards the end.
So I'm going to try and continue the testing that this gives you the perfect crisp base and then stop
it back there because we're finishing it off.
So I'm gonna go perfect crisp base and have to your pizza just sitting on its own right at the end.
Play that again as we believe from rigorous testing that this gives you.
Well, put those both on the same line as well.
From the traditional stone used in most ovens, as we believe from rigorous testing, that this gives
you the perfect crisp base to your pizza.
I'm going to keep that last bit of text on for a little bit longer that this gives you the perfect crisp
base to your pizza.
Good.
I like it.
So now, with all of the subtitles all made.
What do we do now?
Well, let's bring back in the music playback and double check that it's exactly how we want it.
When we think of outdoor cooking, we think back to nature, log fires, open flames, and a good char
on the food being served.
That is why our biggest focus for our products is making sure you get that authentic wood fired taste
when it comes to pizza.
Making our number one pizza oven is the go to family choice.
We have carefully designed the oven so that there is a perfect flow of heat throughout and you can be
cooking in as little as 15 minutes.
The steel pizza base is different from the traditional stone used in most ovens, as we believe from
rigorous testing that this gives you the perfect crisp face to your pizza.
Great.
I'm sure you'll agree.
I hope you'll agree that that just looks so much more professional.
Like, so much more.
I'm meeting there so I don't get playback when I come round.
I just want to point out, in case there's the inquisitive minds, they're a chore, by the way.
A good char on the food being served.
Char is like that.
I learned that by making pizzas, but the char is like, almost like the burnt charcoal bit on your
crust.
Good.
I'm glad to share that with you.
So now we need to export this and decide how we're going to do that.
However, before we do it, let's make sure that everything is ready to output how we want to do and
to get a better view of that, we're going to go back to Adam editing.
I think Joe's will be called differently, but that's my workspace.
We're done here.
Nothing else needs to be done and nothing needs to be committed because it's done.
It's in the sequence.
It's running as it needs to.
So let's go back to Adam editing.
Yeah, my system is taking a little bit of a time to catch up at the moment, probably because of all
the screen recording.
And I'm going to unmute the audio track and unmute the music.
However, I do just want to ask you a question.
Are you as broad as I am with that music by now?
If you are, then welcome to my world and the world you are going into because here it can really be
quite dreary.
So the endpoints in the outpoint aren't correct.
So we're going to go to the end of the music.
Remember the reason why we did that?
So we could continue the crashing waves at the end beneath that on.
Although I'd love to be on the beach right now rather than listen to this music and we're all set up
to render so we're not rendering anything.
Exporting.
Remember that exporting is rendering.
We're not rendering anything new other than this.
All this captions, however, we're going to do it all together to show you best practice.
And before we do that, I'm going to clear out the render file.
And then here, as you can remember from before, we've got all of these.
I'm just going to delete these for now, just so we're not confusing anything.
And we're going to I'm going to show you two versions of rendering, and it's going to also confer with
you one of the reasons that we exported the way that we did last time.
So we're in here, everything's running fine.
Let's just do one final little playthrough.
When we think of out God happy with that.
Everything is showing opens as we believe from Rick.
Chris, good world.
Good to go.


### 3. Rendering Options for Subtitles

So we're going to start the export.
And remember, you can go to file and export media or as I always do use the shortcut control M again,
remembering M stands for mixed down.
I'm going to turn on video.
Then a way that's defaulting has turned off for now.
But I mean, it's quite obvious when there's no video on here that we're not rendering video and we're
going to go to see b r 20 as we have done before.
And now remember, we were looking in captions before and this was all grayed out.
Well, we now have options.
And what options do we have?
Well, we have nothing to do.
Nothing with the with the subtitles.
And I promise you, at some point you're going to render out with all the captions, get a full render
and go, Oh, I didn't do anything with the captions, so you have to come back here and do it again.
Promise you, when you do that, think of me.
So we've got the export options as create a sidecar file or burn captions into video.
So those are the two things we're talking about.
Sidecar file makes it an SRT file that is going to sit alongside the actual video that can then be used
when you upload and you can include SRT styling if you wish.
Again, we haven't set up a style because personally and this is a personal thing, but I like to try
and force it on everybody around me.
SRT Styling should not be applied.
You do the default for SRT one because people are used to the way in which certain the way in which
subtitles are shown and to if you ruin or you change up the style, that can ruin the way in which a
media player reads the sidecar file.
Don't take your chances, just literally don't include the styling.
So now that we have the option chosen of a sidecar file and what we're going to save this as is going
to say, char out doors.
Number one, just going leave it as that.
And I explained to you why very shortly.
But first, I'm going to select that text and I'm going to copy that just so I don't have to type it
out again and I press safe.
So this is going to be the video which has a complementing sidecar file with it.
But we also want to export this or render this out with hard code subs.
So rather than exporting, we're going to queue.
And as you can see, if I bring in media encoder we now have added so to our playlist to render out
is right here.
Chart dose number one done.
It's now custom because it's not just CBR 20, it's CBR 20 with the fact that we're rendering out an
SRT file.
We're going to go back here before we start the render.
We're now going to render this out again or queue it out again with hardcoded subs.
And this may explain why I didn't include any kind of description of the captions in the old one, because
rather than having a sidecar we've still got here, we've got the captions already up.
Yours may just start like this and you have to come across to captions and we're going to say turn captions
into video.
This changed up a little bit, but now we can actually see that because that is on the base export from
this video and that's now going to burn the captions into it will always show regardless of what format
or what platform you're playing it on.
I'm going to go in here and we're going to set the the file name, but we're now going to put a parentheses.
It's used quite a lot in anything and it's a square bracket.
And I'm going to put in here sups and close parentheses.
And that just literally states that this is the version with subs, because if I save and I queue this
one out as well, if you imagine if you're looking at these two in a folder, this one saying subs will
show that it's definitely got subs in it.
This one doesn't have subs in it, but it has an SRT file that works twofold because not only do you
have an SRT file or a sidecar file to be able to cope with it.
But also this can be pushed out on its own without any SRT file, and it's just a standalone video.
So the way in which you title your output can really help with your workflow when you're pushing out
video versions to different areas or to different clients.
So let's hit the playback and start that render.
And as you saw, once that first version was rendered out, it starts with the next one.
It's brilliant, this media encode, and now once we're done, we can just click on one of those and
it will open up the file manager, which is right behind with what we need and what we have here.
Although we only exported two files, two videos, we have three files because we have to share out
those number one with subs.
So if I do look like this, when we think of our I use V Chelsea player by the way to cooking we think
back to nature log files.
Just mute that out for a moment and you can see that these are running hard coded.
If I right click and go to subtitle, there's no option in here to turn off the subtitles they're in.
However, if I go back to this and double click on this version.
We've got subtitles playing.
However, if we go to right click subtitle, subtitle, track and disable, we can turn them off.
That working in there will come will confirm for you that will work.
Online playback depending on where you're using.
And if I select that again, there we are.
So we've created a video that you can toggle on and off your subtitles for.
And that will work perfectly in pretty much every single online platform.
You want to play this.
Belsey is very clever.
If you haven't got it, you should get it because it plays pretty much every single video type anywhere.
And the beauty of this is the reason why we didn't have to right click subtitle and add subtitle file
is because.
The subtitle file is in the same folder as the video playing, so it automatically searches.
The minute you start a video, it automatically starts and searches in that folder for an SRT file.
It's funny how these things work in the background, and until you or you learn about them, you've
got no idea, even though they're always running all the time in the background.
So that's how to export hard coded and a sidecar of subtitles.
