Currently, [[AI assistant for Research and Writing(Obsidian)]]can only be used in Obsidian.
It achived by GPT-4 with MaxAI and and reailzed by Obsidian Plugins like Customjs and Commandar.

Future versions might consider expanding the functionality to apply system-wide rather than being restricted to operation within Obsidian. This would entail monitoring the clipboard content from all active applications using Osascript in the Alfred workflow, as well as invoking Mac OS's Modality feature.

The upcoming tasks will focus on exploring the Alfred workflow and Osascript capabilities:

- [ ] Additional capabilities: [[How to read the clipboard of all applications currently running via Osascript]] 
- [ ] Additional capabilities: [[How to executing operations within any active application using Osascript]]. 
- [ ] Additional capabilities: [[How to display elements using Mac OS's Modality via Osascript]]
