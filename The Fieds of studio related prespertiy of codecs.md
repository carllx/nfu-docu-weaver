[What are the 4 types of perception?](https://www.google.com/search?sxsrf=AJOqlzVZkc3e4b8zOMs6E2JDiNGQuLlGAw:1675129409620&q=What+are+the+4+types+of+perception%3F&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwit56ar1_D8AhWK1DgGHRZPDTEQzmd6BAgaEAU)
	The question for cognitive psychologists is how we manage to accomplish these feats so rapidly and (usually) without error. The vast topic of perception can be subdivided into 
	- **visual perception, auditory perception, 
	- olfactory perception, 
	- haptic (touch) perception, and 
	- gustatory (taste) percep- tion**.

## Cognitive psychology
### Abstract: 
In this article, the relationship between Cognitive psychology and Data Compression is explored. The [[mental processes]] studied in Cognitive psychology, such as perception, memory, problem solving, and decision making, are applied to understand the process of data compression. The article discusses different types of compressed data, such as text, image, video, software, and file systems, and the codecs used in data compression, including compression algorithms, AI-assisted compression, and formats for digital preservation. The concept of format-preserving encryption in cryptography is also explored. The article concludes by summarizing the relationship between Cognitive psychology and Data Compression and highlights the importance of understanding the [[mental processes]] involved in data compression to improve the efficiency and accuracy of compression techniques.

Cognitive psychology studies individual-level [[mental processes]], such as information processing, perception, memory, problem solving, and decision making. These [[mental processes]] can be seen as similar to the encoding, decoding, archiving and storing processes involved in data compression. Understanding these [[mental processes]] from a cognitive psychology perspective can help improve the efficiency and accuracy of data compression techniques by providing insight into the ways that information is processed and represented in the mind. By considering the [[mental processes]] involved in data compression, researchers and practitioners can gain a deeper understanding of how to optimize compression algorithms and ensure that data is stored and preserved in the most efficient and effective way possible.
