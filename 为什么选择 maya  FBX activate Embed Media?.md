Why choose FBX and activate Embed Media when uploading a Maya model to Sketchfab? What is the key role of Embed Media?

When uploading a Maya model to Sketchfab, you should choose the FBX format and activate the 

**Embed Media** option ==to create a self-contained, portable 3D model==. This ensures all textures and other associated media are bundled directly into the single FBX file, rather than being stored separately. 

Why choose FBX for Sketchfab?

While Sketchfab supports a variety of formats, FBX is an excellent choice for complex Maya models for several key reasons:

- **Comprehensive support**: FBX is a file exchange format developed by Autodesk, which means it has deep and reliable support for all data types generated in Maya.
- **Best for animations**: After glTF, Sketchfab recommends FBX as the best option, particularly for models that contain animations.
- **Rich data preservation**: FBX maintains the model's geometry, materials, animations, and skeletal data in a single file, ensuring that the model's appearance and function are preserved when moving between software. 

Key role of Embed Media

The **Embed Media** checkbox is critical for a smooth and reliable upload process. Its key role is to include all texture maps and other external files used by the model inside the FBX file itself. 

Here is a breakdown of why this is important:

|Situation|Without Embed Media (Default)|With Embed Media|
|---|---|---|
|**Transport**|The FBX file stores only a path (a link) to the texture files on your local computer. When you upload this FBX file to Sketchfab, the platform cannot find the texture files because the path leads to your hard drive, not to the internet.|The FBX file contains a physical copy of every texture and image file used by your model. This makes the FBX file completely self-sufficient and portable, so Sketchfab can find and use all the media.|
|**Convenience**|You would need to manually find all the separate texture files and upload them along with your FBX file. The upload is a multi-step process.|You only need to upload a single FBX file. Sketchfab will automatically extract all the embedded textures and apply them correctly to the model.|
|**Consistency**|If the original texture files are moved, deleted, or uploaded to a different computer, the FBX will lose its texture information and appear untextured or broken.|The textures are permanently bundled with the model, so there is no risk of losing the texture link. The model will look exactly as intended every time it's imported or uploaded.|

**Important trade-off**: Enabling **Embed Media** will increase the file size of your FBX, sometimes significantly, because all the images are now part of the file. However, this is a small price to pay for a robust and reliable upload to Sketchfab. You can reduce the size by changing the FBX format to binary during export, but the embedded textures will still cause a file size increase.
