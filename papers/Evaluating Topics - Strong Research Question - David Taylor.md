# Strong Research Question
## Research Question is Crucial
 It's a focused, one-sentence question about your topic that guides your research. Unlike a simple search, research involves seeking multiple answers to this question.
    
## Difference Between Search and Research
 Searching is looking for a specific answer (e.g., "What's the speed of light?"), while research involves exploring multiple aspects of a question (e.g., "In what ways does a service dog improve life for cancer patients?").
    
## Creating a Research Question
 It should require a list to be researched, giving your research a clear direction. For example, "What factors influenced world population growth in the 20th century?" necessitates identifying various factors.
    
## Narrowing or Broadening the Research Question
 This is a natural part of the research process. Depending on your findings, you might need to focus more narrowly or broaden the scope of your question.
    
## Avoiding Common Traps
 - **Unanswerable Questions**: Avoid questions that are too vague or philosophical.
 - **Opinion-based Questions**: Stay away from questions that lead to subjective answers.
 - **Why Questions**: These often don't yield clear, specific answers. Instead, frame them as 'what' or 'how' questions.

## Final Checklist

 - **Approval**: Ensure your research question is approved by your instructor or advisor.
 - **Objectivity**: Focus on answering the research question objectively, without letting personal opinions dominate.
 - **Answerability**: Confirm that the question can be answered with your research methods and within your timeframe.
 - **Feasibility**: Assess if you have the necessary knowledge, skills, resources, and time.

## Final Checklist
- Approved? (instructor, thesis adviser, etc.)
- Objective? (is not cause-driven)
- Answerable? (with your research design & method)
- Feasible? (time, resources, personnel, equipment)
## Practical Steps for Crafting a Research Question

## Identify a Broad Topic
 Start with a general area of interest.
## Initial Inquiry
 Ask a general question about the topic to begin narrowing down.
## Narrowed Focus
 Make the question more specific by focusing on certain aspects.
## Formulate a Strong Research Question
 Ensure the question is clear, concise, and researchable.

## Example 1: Climate Change

- **Broad Topic**: Climate Change
- **Initial Inquiry**: What are the effects of climate change?
- **Narrowed Focus**: How is climate change affecting agriculture in the Midwest United States?
- **Strong Research Question**: What impact has climate change had on corn production in the Midwest over the past 20 years?

## Example 2: Technology in Education

- **General Interest**: Technology in Education
- **Initial Inquiry**: How is technology used in education?
- **Narrowed Focus**: What is the effect of tablet computers on elementary school literacy rates?
- **Strong Research Question**: How have tablet-based reading programs affected literacy rates among 3rd graders in urban public schools?

## Example 3: Diet and Health

- **Subjective Query**: Diet and Health
- **Initial Inquiry**: Are low-carb diets effective for weight loss?
- **Narrowed Focus**: How do low-carb diets compare to low-fat diets in terms of long-term weight loss success?
- **Strong Research Question**: What are the differences in weight loss and cardiovascular health outcomes between individuals following a low-carb diet versus a low-fat diet over a two-year period?
# 强有力的研究问题
## 研究问题至关重要
这是一个关于你研究主题的集中的、一句话的问题，它指导你的研究。与简单的搜索不同，研究涉及到对这个问题的多个答案的探索。
    
## 搜索与研究的区别
搜索是寻找一个特定答案的过程（例如，“光速是多少？”），而研究涉及探索一个问题的多个方面（例如，“服务犬如何改善癌症患者的生活？”）。
    
## 创建研究问题
它应该需要研究一个列表，给你的研究一个清晰的方向。例如，“20世纪世界人口增长的因素有哪些？”需要确定各种因素。
    
## 缩小或扩大研究问题的范围
这是研究过程的自然部分。根据你的发现，你可能需要更加专注或扩大问题的范围。
    
## 避免常见陷阱

    
 - **无法回答的问题**：避免问题太过模糊或哲学性。
 - **基于意见的问题**：远离会导致主观答案的问题。
 - **为什么问题**：这些通常不会产生清晰、具体的答案。相反，将它们框定为“什么”或“如何”的问题。
## 最终清单

    
 - **批准**：确保你的研究问题得到你的指导老师或顾问的批准。
 - **客观性**：专注于客观地回答研究问题，不要让个人意见主导。
 - **可回答性**：确认问题可以用你的研究方法在你的时间范围内得到回答。
 - **可行性**：评估你是否具有必要的知识、技能、资源和时间。




## Avoid these 3 traps:
1. The Unanswerable: 避免提出那些无法通过研究找到答案的问题。例如，“人类为何会彼此残酷？”这类问题通常是哲学或道德性质的，不适合作为实证研究的主题。
2. Only Opinions: 避免那些答案主要基于个人意见而非事实或研究的问题。例如，“哪个国家公园是最好的？”这类问题通常导致基于偏好而非客观数据的结论。
3. Why-O-Why: 虽然 "why" 问题可以引发深入的思考，但它们有时可能不适合作为研究问题，因为它们可能需要探索主观动机或不可量化的因素。例如，“为什么公司尽管有规定还是继续污染环境？”这类问题可能需要探讨复杂的经济、社会和心理因素。
