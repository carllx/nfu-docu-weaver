A detailed illustration of a person sitting at a desk in a library surrounded by books and a laptop. The person is in the process of writing a literature review. The desk is organized with notes and highlighted articles, suggesting a deep research process. The scene should depict various stages of writing a literature review: defining the scope with notes, searching for literature on a laptop, evaluating sources with a pile of books, some marked with bookmarks, organizing the review with a mind map on paper, synthesizing information with an open journal with annotations, and revising a draft document. The person is focused, taking notes from one of the books. The library has tall bookshelves crammed with books in the background, reflecting a scholarly atmosphere. 2:1

# Literature Review Types Summary

A literature review is a critical component of academic research, providing a comprehensive survey of existing knowledge on a particular topic. It is important to select the appropriate type of literature review to fit the research assignment. Here are the different types of literature reviews:

## 1. Narrative/Chronological Literature Review
- **Commonality**: Most common type.
- **Function**: Traces the development of a topic over time.
- **Key Feature**: Highlights significant research chronologically and provides summary conclusions.
- **Thoroughness**: Essential aspect, but does not include the methodology for work selection.

## 2. [[Systematic Reviews|Systematic Review]]
- **Methodology**: Follows a defined method or procedure.
- **Strategy**: Involves a clear search strategy and criteria for including/excluding works.
- **Purpose**: To search for, synthesize, and evaluate relevant works systematically.

## 3. Scoping Review
- **Objective**: Estimates the amount of literature available on a topic.
- **Timing**: Typically conducted at the beginning of a project.
- **Goals**: Highlights research gaps and justifies the need for new research.

## 4. Critical Review
- **Scope**: Goes beyond providing an overview by evaluating the quality of the works reviewed.
- **Contribution**: Uses reflection and critique to provide context for the researcher's own opinions and approaches.

## 5. Theoretical Review
- **Focus**: Establishes and examines existing theories and their relationships.
- **Analysis**: Reviews the extent of prior investigation and the adequacy of current theories.
- **Outcome**: Highlights the necessity for new hypotheses, supporting the need for the researcher's project.

## 6. Methodological Review
- **Emphasis**: Centers on the research methods leading to findings rather than the findings themselves.
- **Utility**: Provides a framework for understanding previous research methodologies and clarifies methods applicable to the researcher's work.

## 7. Thematic Review
- **Approach**: Identifies and focuses on recurring themes within the literature.
- **Organization**: Uses these themes to structure the literature review.

## 8. Argumentative Review
- **Technique**: Selectively uses literature to support or refute existing arguments or assumptions in the field.
- **Concern**: There is a potential for introduction of bias.

## 9. State-of-the-Art Review
- **Frequency**: Conducted at regular intervals.
- **Currentness**: Concentrates on the latest research findings.
- **Insight**: Clarifies current understanding and points out areas of disagreement and research gaps.
