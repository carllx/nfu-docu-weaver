## key points
- **What a Literature Review is Not**: It is not an essay or a research paper. It doesn't state, prove, illustrate, corroborate, or develop your main points; those are in the body of your essay or paper.
    
- **Definition of 'Literature'**: In this context, 'literature' refers to major works published on a narrow topic, not everything on a broad subject.
    
- **Purpose of a Literature Review**: It involves reviewing the major published peer-reviewed sources on a narrow topic. A review is like taking a snapshot of the major concepts, points, outcomes, etc., from these sources.
    
- **Process of Reviewing**: The review captures the essence of each source and shows the relationships between them, which may be presented in a timeline.
    
- **Reasons for Conducting a Literature Review**:
    
    1. To improve your own understanding as a researcher.
    2. To demonstrate your knowledge and expertise to your professor.
    3. To serve the reader by bringing them up-to-date on the topic, similar to catching up with an old friend.
- **The Literature Review's Role**: It brings the reader up to the present state of research on the topic, setting the stage for introducing your own ideas and research.
