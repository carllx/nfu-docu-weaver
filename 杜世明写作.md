文化商业化帶来的坏处
[ts] Using traditional cultures as money-making tourist attractions may destroy them. [解释] This is because the way they are originally performed needs to be altered to meet the needs of tourists. [es.] For example, in order to help audiences easily understand the meaning of a traditional dance, the moves have to be simplified, [res] which as a result leads to the loss of authenticity of traditional art.

稳定心态对休育此装的作用
[ts]  On the other hand, many people believe that a stable and positive mentality, to a great extent, determines the results of sports competitions. [降层解释] More specifically, athletes aiming at winning medals must be able to stay calm throughout the game or not easily give up even in an uphill battle.  [es.] One of the most obvious examples of this is the shooting competition where the ability to focus on the target and not to be affected by the crowds is far more important than physical strength.

私人公司对科研的表马流孩被限制 
```markdown
[ts]Private companies' involvement in the research of some technologies must be restricted. [ts] If profit-driven organizations were allowed to freely conduct any experiment they are interested in, there would be devastating outcomes, [es.]For example, rather than being researched and developed by private companies, nuclear technology is strictly controlled by the government in almost every country. This is due to the fear that the technology of purifying radioactive materials which can be used to produce powerful weapons of massive destruction, such as an atomic bomb, may fall into wrong hands.

支持梭服的理由
People in favour of students wearing school uniforms believe that it has a number of benefits.
[ts.1]. First, requiring students to wear uniforms helps reduce peer pressure.When everyone in the class is dressed in the same way, they are not likely to talk about the price and taste of clothes. [res]As a result, no one would feel a sense of superiority or being prejudiced. 
[ts.2] In addition, the rule of wearing school uniforms keeps the campus safe. This is because those who are not members of the school can be easily recognized and kept outside. There are consequently less possibilities of some incidents, [es.]such as theft or gang bullying on campus.
