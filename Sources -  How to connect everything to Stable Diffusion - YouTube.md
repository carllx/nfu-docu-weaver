Transcript:
(00:00) you want to connect anything to stable diffusion like Photoshop or a webcam hi in this tutorial let's look a few examples on how to use stable diffusion in touch designer first install all necessary components then look at some basic example for generating images and how we can increase generation speed and we'll also build a simple interface let's start if you haven't installed tou designer yet download the latest version the free version will have a limit on IM size but that's enough for us then download the comi which contains
(00:35) everything you need to work in stable diffusion also install comy UI manager table diffusion models will be required to generate the images they can can be found for example on civit AI website copy the model to the folder confi models checkpoints also download various Auto encoder and copy it to the appropriate folder start confy UI download updates install additional notes to connect stb fusion and touch design restart confy UI let's check that the image generation
(01:40) is working take a already made workflow and simply move it to the confi window select the checkpoint double click to bring up the note menu and select vaa loader connect it to between code and decode and click Q prompts we've got generated image now we need to connect to touch Design This requires a slightly modification to the workflow in order to send images to confi we add load image base 64 note at the very [Music] beginning and in order to send images to touch designer we are the Send image websocket note at the very
(02:40) end now you need to save the workflow and load it into touch designer to do this enable def mode option in the settings and save it in a API format download the TD comy UI component it allows you to open comi projects in touch designer open Touch designer add a compony to the project add the workflow file to the project and connect it all parameters from confi will appear on the workflow tab let's set a picture press up and select mve file in seted to the desired resolution using fit note set the resolution create new at the
(03:56) end and that a source for generation add n after TD confy UI click generate and get a new image let's try with a webcam add a video device note in select a webcom and plug it instead of the picture
(05:00) click generate you can also enable Stream So image will be generated continuously and the question you probably have how can we speed this up to do this you need to download an additional model and copy it to the folder confi models lth go to confi add the Lauren not press refresh and connect as shown in the video save in API
(06:05) format add new file to touch designer change settings turn on stream you can also control the parameters in real time let's go to the Photoshop example now I need to install OBS and the obs pout plugin pout allows programs to share texture from video memory and if there is no plug-in for your software you can use OBS which is what we're
(07:08) about to do in Photoshop create a new document and set the resolution in OBS capture the window go to filters and customize scop add a spout filter go to touch design and it's spout in not and here is Photoshop
(08:18) canvas now we need to crop it by Alpha to do this download the r made component and add it after the spout not let's put together a simple interface to make it easy to draw create container and select resolution drag null after TD comi on container select background set alignment create a button that will be
(09:29) enable stream generation and connect it to container create null after the button press a on the keyboard and pull it over on stream select chop reference create window and drag contain select window operator in the parameters
(10:33) select always on top then set as perform window and press F1 to switch to perform mode press stream and start drawing you can use escape to exit to the editor we've covered the simplest examples of stable diffusion integration in touch design of course you can do more complex workflows with control net or other extensions which will hopefully open up space for any ideas you may have thanks for watching
