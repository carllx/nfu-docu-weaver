## Download the ARFoundation sample project from GitHub repository


(00:01) everyone and welcome back so we've now taken a look at what we'll be covering in the augmented reality playlist and I thought for these second video we'll actually get something working and built to some devices and we can start playing about and looking at least at the very basics of AR and then we can start building our very own project after this when we have an understanding of what the goals will be and how we can go about some of that so to get started with the AR foundation you're gonna want to head over to the git repository which
(00:31) again I'll link that in the description but allow for you to come over and take a copy and download when you're on this page you can either clone or download this as a zip file and then once you've extracted this you'll see that this is just a standard unity pre-built project where you can go into the assets go to the scene folder and pick a scene that you want to load and start trying to test and get working on your device and I'll show you how to do that in just a moment before that I just very quickly wanted
(00:59) to look at a few things down here show you what's on the page as well as a lot of this can be really really useful so the first thing is just to kind of recap again what I've kind of touched on in the past about the version of unity that you choose to use so again this one does highlight that is specifically compatible with 2019 and does say that you can get it working for 2018 you have to look at a different branch the preview branch again like I said I've seen somewhere else that just standard 2018 works and then there's something
(01:24) down below as well which just like I recommend you to download the latest version of 2019 or later so like I said I definitely recommend that if you can if you've got the space available for newer versions of the engine besides that as well if we scroll down a little bit more pretty much everything that you want to get working in here does have some documentation in the project on top of that all of the different examples are kind of loosely documented here as well and it will show you some of the restrictions using some of the packages
(01:53) so if you're trying something and it doesn't work then take a look back over to this webpage as it may shed some light on whether your device isn't compatible whether the unity version that needs something added to support that and everything like that so this this webpage is actually a really good kind of Bible for everything that you need to get most of these templates going okay so over to the Unity engine now what I wanted to show you is that like I said this will come pre packed with a lot of different things that you need to
(02:20) get going with the AR Foundation pack now this is one of those things where if you don't know what you're looking for to do or you don't know how to set things up this has everything kind of pre set for you which is great but again it could leave you when you're creating your own new project a little bit confused of why some of the classes might not be working things won't be loading so I'm going to go through those very briefly as well now what I mean by this if we first take a look at the package manager 


## Compared the pre-installed packages in the example project (AR Foundation, AR Subsystems, ARCore plugin)




so if we go to window
(02:45) and then package manager this will actually have a few things pre-installed that a standard fresh project will not have installed so if we go down first of all to the AR foundation this is the first one and we can see down here that this says remove which means that this has already been installed to this project likewise with the AR subsystems and the AR core plugin again they both say remove so that means that these are installed in the engine and by default that's not standard so this is one of those things that we're gonna do when we
(03:14) create our own project and this is just a small insight of some of the things that will be set up that can confuse new users and that's why I wanted to go through the step-by-step process of creating a brand new project rather than just using this fairly big project as well so that's another problem is inside of the AR foundation's project there may be a lot of things you actually don't want that you won't need to use that's quite a bloated project when you look at it in that sense okay so I actually realized that opened up the wrong
(03:40) augmented reality project but the same things apply so they've actually got a lot more of the packages again as you can see by these ticks as well they actually have a lot more of the packages pre-installed as well 


## ARFoundation Basic Plane Detection


so again just an inside of everything that's installed in this project which in a standard project wouldn't be included now moving on to getting something built though what I'm going to do is go down to these scenes folder and I'm gonna find the simple AR so this is going to be the first one which will just create some planes and
(04:07) give us a really really base understanding of how things will be working so if we go to the simple AR folder go to the simple AR scene and you can see what you're gonna see on your device here you have some buttons to pause the operation reload it if you wanted to reset all of the planes and get it to forget everything or completely reset it which is going to reload the entire scene and of course resume once you've pressed the way that this will be working the classes or prefabs responsible for that so you've got the AR sessions and when
(04:34) it comes to the scripts everything with these they they kind of look like Google cardboard so something everything with those as an icon for the scripts are part of the AR foundation code library so these are all things that will be in this project as well and then there are some which are the unique scripts which are just the ones which are specific to the certain template that you're looking at so for this one is going to be placing an object on the plane so the way that this is going to be handled is when we've got a valid
(05:03) plane which is being tracked in AR it's going to lie to choose an object by default this one has been selected as the a are placed cube so we're just going to expect to see that red cube being placed if there's a valid plane detected in the AR scene and again we're going to be saying a lot of these things up because there are some things like the AR plain manager or the a our sessions origin which we're going to need in all of our projects or most of the types of AR setups that we may want to do when we start making our custom stuff

## Packup Simple AR

(05:32) so now with a scene of your choice I would probably recommend these simple AR as a kind of starting point once you have your scene open though this is a very standard process you just want to make sure that you have your phone set up in developer mode go to the build and run settings if you know that that's all ready to go with your device plugged in otherwise if that doesn't work straight away then we can go to the build options make sure you're on the correct platform and if it's not finding the scene then
(06:00) you can come down here and tell it exactly which scene you want it to build which again in this instance is going to be the simple a off generally though I've just found that having it your device plugged in pressing build and run will get all of that working perfectly fine okay so back here I have the application built to my device just have a quick demonstration going on of using the simple AR package let's begin with I'm trying to find just a flat surface from a far enough away distance weight and decide what exactly is a plane you
(06:29) can steal these points trying to work out the distance around it that's created a plane on my desk and then where the the pinky red cube has been spawned that's where I'm tapping on the screen again this is just they're showing the detection of multiple different planes as well and I'd panned away their own purpose because what it does is it will remember the object you've placed because it's that's only like one at a time and it will remember where that was if you you pan away and then pan back you will see
(06:54) that same cube is there and you can see that's actually doing quite a good job at finding multiple different surfaces so it's keeping in memory a lot of different surfaces that it's find and other things notice is it is quite good with the the kind of the depth or the distance tracking so we'll know it's got a rough idea of the the size of the object based on which plane you're touching on and how big to make the object to make it appear as though it's closer further away so that's another quite interesting thing a lot noticed
(07:21) here as well now the last thing I've done just to kind of demonstrate something I've gone and found the animals so it's quite interesting to find interesting shaped objects you can see it's really focusing on the dog there you can see that all of the cluster of points have really trying to detect the shape of the dog whereas in comparison with the budgie it just assumed that was just part of the flat surface so given a little bit more time maybe a little bit more accuracy it may have actually created a plane on top of
(07:46) the the dog specifically rather than just including her as part of the floor as well so I find that quite interesting trying to find interesting shaped objects or things in the world to kind of scan as well okay so that was the first test hopefully you've now got this is your first time trying it you've just had your very first AR application up and running on your own device which should be pretty cool I'm going to take a look at one more because it's slightly different and I find this one quite interesting as well but what I would
(08:13) recommend is after this video just go ahead and go through all of the scenes really if you can if they support your devices have a look through the the code system here see what what's happening behind the scenes if any of that's going to make sense to you try and get a general idea of what prefabs need to be in the scenes and we can do that by looking at the next one I want to take a look at is image tracking 


## Image Tracking
so I'm going to go to the image tracking scene and again the first thing we can see is they both have the AR session origin so we
(08:37) already know that this is going to be quite an important object and this is going to be a prefab we'll see in most of the things that we're making and that goes for the same thing as with the the AR session as well so this is another thing that was in both now this one has a tracked image manager so again this is part of the standard library that you get and then we've got the tracked image info manager which is the custom one which has got some information about what to display on the images if and when the tracked in the by the device so
(09:03) again if you want to kind of break this apart you can come over here find out what the image info prefab is take a look at this and see what it's doing so this is purely a plane with some images and you can get an array different images for this to track which we're gonna have a look at in a moment when we built this and then the tracked image info manager is going to handle displaying at that information you have available depending on which of those items of the array it's found 


## Detailed explanation of components involved in Image Tracking scenes

so again for this I'm just going to go ahead go
(09:27) to file build and run plug the device in and get this built as well and give a quick look at how the image tracking works okay so back over on the device this is quite an interesting one now of course you can print out and use physical copies of the images I've just chosen to do this on the desktop I've put the images up here for the front to track perfectly well now the first one we can see is the barcode this one's a little bit hard to work out what's going on because it basically just provides some white text on top of the image so you
(09:57) can't really see that and it's also quite hard to tell but it does overlay a virtual image onto the tracked image that it's found so this is a lot more evident and visible on flower because you can see how she gets a lot darker and kind of pops in as soon as it's tracked the flower and of course the text is a lot easier to see and this is just the information about the image that's found and the other thing I'm trying to highlight in the recording as well as you can move them around it actually tracks quite well overlays
(10:23) things based on which order it's find the objects but it attracts their movement around the screen as well and one thing I forgot to shows similar with the cube if you completely move the tracking off screen and then move it back it will remember the object that you had tracked where it was and immediately overlay that picture again also does some scaling and stuff so just saw there so it will account for the scale of the image is tracking and change the virtual version of that which can be really handy in some quite co-op
(10:51) Lakai shion's okay so they were just two of the many different packages you can get in here though so like I said if you want to do things like face tracking although it says it is an AR kit specific feature I've had that building and working with no alterations at all perfectly fine on my Android device so you can just go into pretty much any of these scenes quickly to build to your device see if it works see how it's working play about some of the interesting features and if there's anything which really catches
(11:19) your interest then that's when you can come back in and have a look at the sessions origin these scripts and see what's going on behind the scenes to try and get a better idea of how these things are working and again that's what we're gonna be doing step-by-step in the next videos anyway but I just wanted to have a little bit fun to become with and get some stuff built to the devices and show you how to actually use the package and play about things to start with okay with that done though I will leave that
