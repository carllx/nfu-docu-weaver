On the other hand, a variety of new visual sensing technologies, homologous to traditional lens -based photography, are expanding new realms of application.
另一方面，与传统的基于镜头的摄影同源的各种新的视觉[[sensor]]技术正在拓展新的应用领域。[sketchfab BARACK OBAMA](https://sketchfab.com/3d-models/barack-obama-3010d6b0fdd843b397fa9e98437bc22a "BARACK OBAMA")

Perhaps one of the best known of these applications in popular culture includes the fact that in 2016, former US President Barack Obama became the first president to have an official 3D portrait created by a team led by the Smithsonian Institution, through a process that involved capturing
流行文化中最著名的应用之一可能是这样一个事实，即 2016 年，美国前总统巴拉克奥巴马成为第一位拥有由史密森学会领导的团队创​​建的官方 3D 肖像的总统，该过程涉及捕捉

with data of the rest of the head and shoulders captured by a structured light 3D scanner, the Smithsonian team was able to recreate a complete and accurate 3D representation with which to produce the physical bust using 3D printing [15] (Figure 5a).
借助结构光 3D 扫描仪捕获的头部和肩部其余部分的数据，史密森尼团队能够重新创建完整且准确的 3D 表示，并使用 3D 打印生成物理半身像 [15]（图 5a）。

In many ways, 3D scanning shares or utilises some of the same techniques as photography, capturing traditional visual information with a camera while using enhanced assistive means, such as structured light pattern or photogrametry, to capture additional spatial distance information to not only record colour and
在许多方面，3D 扫描共享或利用一些与摄影相同的技术，使用相机捕捉传统视觉信息，同时使用增强的辅助手段（例如结构光模式或摄影测量）来捕捉额外的空间距离信息，不仅可以记录颜色和

light, but also the three-dimensional forms [127] [24].
光，还有三维形式[127] [24]。

In this post-photographic era, 3D scanning can be seen as a form of photography in the broadest sense, or Augmented Photography.
在这个后摄影时代，3D扫描可以看作是最广义的摄影形式，即增强摄影。

This technique has in recent years been extensively studied in the museum field and is being applied to cultural heritage preservation, with the hope that this new augmented photography will not only provide a 2D record as traditional photography does, but also a complete record of the three
这项技术近年来在博物馆领域得到广泛研究，并正在应用于[[Cultural Heritage]]保护，希望这种新的增强摄影不仅能像传统摄影一样提供二维记录，而且可以完整记录3D

-dimensional morphological details of the artefacts with surface material and colour properties, thus enabling reconstruction in the three-dimensional space [174] [204].
具有表面材料和颜色特性的人工制品的三维形态细节，从而能够在[[Digital Space]]中进行重建 [174] [204]。
