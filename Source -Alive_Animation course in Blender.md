## 01-01 Course introduction

Hi everyone, this is Pierrick from P2 Design. I'm so happy to welcome you to Alive!, the animation course in Blender. In this training course, we will learn the tools, the fundamentals, and principle while manipulating and animating. As any other art form, you won't get good at animation by watching video tutorials. You do need to practice as much as possible. I'm here to teach you my best practices to help to learning and improving your animation skills. Videos are shot to offer the best learning experience. I advise you to watch each video once and then rewatch them and follow along. Each chapter will focus on a specific theme, principle, or level of animation. Whatever your skill level, I advise you to take this course from the beginning, because they are big chances you will learn something, or at least it will refresh your animator mind. In the next video, I will go through the current content of the course, but the course will be also updated and I will add the more content through free updates. The course come with a ball rig, a little police squirrel character rig, a Battle mech rig, and the character Trident. You are free to use those rig for your non-commercial projects. You can post any of the animation you will do with those characters on your social media or for your portfolio, but you can't use these rigs or any content of the course for commercial project. And you must not re-distribute or share any of the content of the course, whether it's Blende file or video files. The course come with the documentation where you will find the list of all the videos included. The difficulty level of each chapter will be defined, my freestyle level. One star is beginner, two star intermediate, and three star is advanced. You will also find links to the different external resources use in this course. And they will be labeled in a yellow color. The video labeled in blue are theoretical and tools focused video. So I advise you to watch them all and come back to them often so that you don't miss any detail. Let's jump into the next video and see what's the content of the course.

## 01-02 Course content and how to use it

[Instructor] In this video, we will have a quick look at the course content and how to use it. At this stage, you should have downloaded all the content. You will find a read-me file that I invite you to read with some legal informations. And for each chapter, you will find a zipped file or multiple zipped files. I suggest you unzip those chapters in a specific folder. The zipped file will include all the videos but also all the English subtitles of those videos. One of the zip provided include all the course files. You must unzip those file in the dedicated folder. Simply right click on the zip file and choose Extract to course files folders. You will find a dedicated folder for each chapter of the course. And those dedicated folders includes all the Blender files, textures and whatever resource you will need during those chapters. It's important to keep the structure and hierarchy of those folders as it is in the zipped file because of the most files are linked or are sourcing textures with a relative path into those folder. You will find one Blender file or multiple Blender file per lecture or lesson. This way you can choose whether to start from the beginning with your own animation or to use one of the provided file at, or to use one of the provided file at a given point in time. You will also find video reference for the specific exercises, and any other resources used by the Blender file. Let's have a quick look through the course contents. Two is a must-watch because this is where you will learn how Blender deals with data. And since your job will be to animate those data, you'd better be aware of how it works. This is also the chapter where you will have your first experience with the animation tool and how to read and use them. The graph editor is often confusing for beginners animator, so it's very important that you watch those videos. This way you'll be prepared to jump into chapter three. It's the most extensive chapter of the course where you will learn how to use an armature rig to perform your first simple polished animation, to manipulate your first character, create a full set of animations, and then combine them to reproduce this short animation. If you're a beginner or have a bit of experience animating in Blender, then I advise you to follow this whole chapter and do the exercises multiple time until you get comfortable. I will repeat this a lot during the course but animation is an art form. Failing is totally normal, and only practice will make you progress. In chapter four, we will focus on learning other animation technique. We will create a new set of animation using this robot rig. And we will see how we can use constraints and space switching to generate additional motion onto our character, getting convincing result in a matter of minutes. We will apply this to a walk cycle, this artillery shot and also to shoot rockets from a moving robot. This way, you will be able to reproduce all the animation in this short movie. And for those of you eager to learn how to create the FXs and the environment, I've already published and will published additional tutorials for free on my YouTube channel regarding those specific subjects. In chapter five and six, you will be introduced to character locomotion and body mechanics through fully detailed lessons on how to build a run cycle and a walk cycle. We will go deeper into reference analysis, and I will try to teach you how to correctly study your reference and get the best from them. From there, I will guide you through the whole blocking stage, 'til the final polishing. In chapter seven, I will teach you all my techniques to get great poses from deep reference analysis to stylization technique to push your poses and the appeal of your character way further. Finally, in chapter eight, the most advanced chapter, you will apply all what you have learned during the course to create this combo animation. And I'll be there over eight hours of video to teach you everything from the base blocking to creating the breakdowns, the blocking plus, the first pass of spline to the final polishing stage, and adding some details and FXs so that you can create a great and polished animation that you'll be able to proudly feature in your demo reel or portfolio.

## 01-03 Advised ressources

[Instructor] Before we jump into animation, I'd like to show you my table. It's made of some exotic wood and it's very useful too. Nope, it's not a course about table but I'd like to show you some resources that could be useful. The first one is obviously "The Animator's Survival Kit" by Richard Williams. This is a classic. I guess all the animators have this book in their shelves, and to be perfectly honest, it doesn't get old. But you will find in there tons of lesson about the principles of animation and so many drawings that are still used to this date to teach animation. It also comes with a lot of stories about animation a few decades ago. But definitely, a must-have. The next book, which is one of my favorite is "Drawn to Life" by Walt Stanchfield. This is a book that was recommended to me by my animation mentor, Jeremy Collins, and while it's mostly focused on drawing, everything in there is appliable to animation, especially when it comes to staging and creating great poses. The last book I'd like to advise is a classic. It's "The Illusion of Life" from Frank Thomas and Ollie Johnston. Beyond the educational content, it's fascinating to learn stories about Disney, the studio that has almost created animation. While you don't need those book, I do believe that having them and reading them will really help you to dive into the art of animation. There are tons of quality book about animation and drawing, and it's always good to get a step back from the screen and take a good book and chill. I'd like to recommend you also a YouTube video by Alan Becker about the It has more than eight million of views, and this is definitely because it's one of the best video about the 12 principle of animation. It's short, super well illustrated and explained. A must-watch. And finally, I truly advise you to use SyncSketch. SyncSketch is an online media player that allows you to read almost every video format, and allows you to draw on screen, to leave notes and to create reviews and share them. Definitely one of the best platform to share your reviews or get feedback from other animators. This is the tool I use every day for all my reviews, and also in this course whenever I'm analyzing any reference. If you're looking for an offline solution, I advise you Keyframe Pro media player. You can get a free version of it. There is also a paid version of it with additional functionalities, but personally, I prefer to use SyncSketch.

## 02-01-Object transformation

In blender almost any input can be animated. Whether it's an object position, the armature or a character, or even the color of an object. Let's start simple with object transformation. In this chapter, we will focus on object animation. An understanding what an object is, is crucial. An object in blender is a simple container and depending on what kind of object you've added it contains different objects datas like mesh datas, camera datas or empty datas. These datas can be transferred from one object to the other. The important thing regarding object animation are not these object on mesh datas, but the object transform data. The position of the object in space reserved of its location transform. Its orientation is based on its rotation values and size is the result of its original size multiplied by its current scale. For example, acute mesh that is one meter tall and has a scale of 1.5 will be 1.5 meter tolls in the viewport. These coordinates and transform information are affecting the origin of the object. So while the mesh object might look offset, its position is not linked to its geometry, but only to its origin point. So basically when transforming an object you're just transforming its origin point. We can see that everything rotates or scale around or toward the origin point. We can see this doted line between my mouse cursor and the origin point of the object, showing the pivot to use for this transformation. The current location of the object is based on this origin point. And it's measured based on the origin of the blender scene or the origin of old space. So by default the origin of an object is it's transformation pivot and what we are going to animate. even if an object seems to be made of multiple object the only important thing for animation is its origin point. You can use the different gizmos available in the tool panel to transform your object. I generally prefer to use the shortcuts G to move, S to scale and R to rotate combined with XYZ and shift to constraint around specific axis. To summarize, any kind of object has an origin point. When animating an object, we are manipulating its origin coordinate. So manipulating an object, is manipulating a single point in space.

## 02-02-Object transform channel

[Man] The previous video, we have seen that object transform is based on its pivot point. Now let's see what we are currently transforming. As a Blender user and a 3D artist, you know that in space we are using the x-, y-, and z-axis to move our objects. We can find the representation of those axes on the grid with the x- and y-axes being those red and green lines. And also on the view widget on the top right corner, that allow us to switch to the different views. When an object is not transformed, its position is aligned with the world origin. As soon as we input some values into its x-coordinate, for example, it will slide, moving along the x-ward axis, and it will behave the same whether we are playing with the y or z value. There is no limitation to those value, they can be positive or negative, and our object will move left, right, up, and down, or front and back, depending on those. If I enter a value of one and one on x and z, we can see our object offset from the center of our scene. When it comes to rotation, we don't rotate along an axis, but around an axis. If I rotate around the x-axis, I can see my x rotation value changing, and my object is currently rotating around the red arrow. And as always, the origin of the object is used as the origin of the rotation. If you have difficulties understanding on which axis you are going to rotate, you can activate the rotation gizmo that make it more obvious. If I now perform a scanning pressing S and concentrate it on the x-axis pressing x, you can see that I'm scaling my object along the selected axis. The same on the y-axis here or on the z-axis. So, scaling is along the object axis. One last option that is available for object is delta transform. When I go into the object properties, I can see this delta transform panel that looks like the classic transform panel. Delta transforms behave the same way as transform, but they are added on top of your transformation. So you can see here, when I add the delta transform of one and one on top of my one and one classic transform, my object is offset to the position two on x and two on z. To be honest, I almost never use the delta transform, and I don't think we will be using it during this course. It can be useful whenever you want to offset an existing object animation, for example. Let's say you have animate an up and down motion and you want to easily offset it on the side. Using the delta transform will make your life easier. But there are other way to do it, and we will see that during the course. To summarize, we have seen that location, transformation, and scaling are done along the axis, while rotation is done around the axis, and we can offset an animation using delta transform.

## 02-03-First Keyframe

[Pierre] Now that we have a better understanding of object transformation, let's start animating. We will work on the classic bouncing ball. Since I'd like to be able to squash and stretch the ball during the animation, using its very center as a pivot point is not ideal. What I'd like to do instead is adding its origin point on the base of the ball as this is going to be the contacting point of the ball with our imaginary ground. So I will simply enter edit mode, select every vertices and press G, Z, and one to move everything off one meter on the Z axis. When they get back into object mode, I still have the same sphere, but its origin is now on its place. By default, the timeline in Blender is in the bottom of the screen. When you press space, you can see that we are playing an animation, meaning that blender is going through the different frame of the document. The play head in the timeline indicate which frame you are currently reading. We can change the length of the animation by setting the end frame and the beginning frame. I will set the beginning frame to zero and end frame to 24. When I press play, we can see the play head moving till frame 24 and getting back to frame zero. This value indicates you in the current frame that is also alight on top of the play head. Animation in Blender is basically recording a different transformation to an object in time, meaning that we can recall the location, rotation or scale of an object on different frames. To insert a key frame, we simply need to have our object selected in space and press the I key. A menu will pop up asking you which kind of key frame you want to write. Basically, do you want to recall the location, the rotation, the scale of the object or a combination of those? When I select location, we can see that in the transform channel of my object, the location input turn to yellow. And on the timeline, I get a little yellow indicator that tells me we have recorded a key frame. The key frame is a simple registered value in time. In our case, we have registered or recorded the location of our object on frame zero. I will place to play head on frame 10 and move my object higher and insert a location key frame. Now I can see a new key frame on my timeline, and as soon as I move the play head from left to right, I can see sphere moving from its previous position on frame zero, to the next position we have key framed on frame 10. We have recorded two position on two different frame and what we are seeing now is Blender interpolating or creating an interpolation between those two position in space. key frames can be manipulated in the timeline as objects, so you can move them using G, you can press Shift + D to duplicate them. You can box select them, press X to delete them. You can insert a new key frame by simply hovering over a transformed channel and pressing I or right-clicking and choose between insert key frame or insert single key frame if you just want to add a key frame on the X location, for example. Right clicking will also hollow you to delete all the key frames from the selected channel or choose delete only single key frame to delete a specific X, Y, or Z channel. So let's start our exercise on frame zero and insert a key frame. Let's moved the play head to frame 12 and then move our sphere or ball on the Z axis by eight meters. We can see that our transformed channels have changed color. The X and Y are still on green, meaning that they have been key framed previously and their values haven't changed. And the Z key frame as turned to orange, meaning that we have transformed the Z value, but it's not recorded yet. And this is a big warning, because as soon as I will move the play head, my ball will return to its first key frame position, meaning that I have lost the Z transformation I've performed on frame 12 because I haven't recorded it. So I will jump back to frame 12, move my sphere of eight meters and then press I to insert a key frame. If I now scrub through frame zero to frame 12, I can see the ball rising in the air. So transformed channels are colored in yellow whenever I'm hitting a key frame and they are green whenever I'm in between or during an interpolation. I can select the first key frame, press Shift + D and move it onto the very last frame so that I have a looping action. To create a loop you just have to make your first and last frames being the same. You can move from frame to frame by pressing the left and right arrow. Whenever you will press the up and down arrow, you will jump from the previous to the next key frame. Pressing Shift + right and Shift + left will bring you to the very last of the very first key frame. You can perform all those play head manipulation using the UI in the header of the timeline. As we have seen before, anytime while I'm moving our object somewhere, we need to insert a key frame or we will lose the manipulation we have done. While it might be okay to press I each time we perform a manual manipulation on the single bouncing ball, when you will start animating a full character with thousands of controls, that's gonna be very tedious. Fortunately, there is the record button here that allow us to auto key any transformation. As soon as I move the sphere, you can see that new keys are being recorded for every channel of this fear automatically. Not that whenever you are using this option and moving your object in space, you are warned that there is an auto keying going on on the top right corner of your (indistinct) As explained in the beginning, we can keep frame mostly every kind of value in Blender, and it can be a color. If I select the material preview of my sphere and I click this little rounded icon, it will add a key frame on the color value. And I can find this key frame on the timeline. If I go a little further now and change the color, since the auto keying is on, it will insert a new key frame of this new color. And whenever I scrub through the timeline, I can see the color interpolation of the sphere. To summarize, we have seen that we can use the timeline to navigate through the different frames. We have seen that we can create a key frame by recording any value, whether it's a transformed channel, a color or whatever we want onto a specific frame. Blender will automatically create an interpolation between two key frames. Key framed values appear in yellow, animated values appear in green unrecording value changes are shown in orange and gray value are just unanimated values.

## 02-04-More about the timeline

[Pierre] As any Blender editor, you can navigate in the timeline using your middle mouse. You can move selected items by pressing G, you can scale them using S, which will push them further from the play head. But pressing R won't rotate the key frame. What it will do instead, it will all you to change the key frame type. Changing the key frame type won't affect your animation. It's only a visual modification of your key frames that may allow you to better organize your animation. I personally never use it (drowned out by whooshing) Pressing the zero key on the numpad will center your timeline position around the play head. When you have some key selected, pressing the dot key on the numpad will frame or focus the selection. Pressing the home key will frame the whole animation from the very first to the very last key frame. You can preview a part of your animation by pressing P and dragging and hold on the section you want to repeat. Press Alt + P to clear the preview. You can activate the preview range by clicking the clock icon and then setting the starting and ending frame. You can set the beginning of your animation, pressing Control + Home. And you can set the end by pressing Control + Home. When you activate the preview range with the clock icon is using Control + Home and Control + Home, will set the beginning and the end of the preview range. My timeline here is just showing me the key frame of the selected items. If I go into view and uncheck only key frames from selected object, every key frame in the scene will be displayed. My character currently I've a subdivision modifier. If I go to the rendering properties, I can see that simplify has been activated. It allows you to disable every subdivision modifier in the scene, increasing the playback performances. When deactivated, we can see that my frame range in the top left corner turned to red meaning that Blender is not able to reach the frame rate I've set previously. While this scene is supposed to run at 30 frames per second, here I am below 14 frames per second. While it is not optimal, Blender allow us to drop frames so that we have a bit sort of timing of the animation, meaning that it will drop some of the frame to make sure that the action run at the same speed as if we were displaying the 30 frames per seconds. To allow this, just go to the playback option, to the no sync and choose whether frame drop or AV sync. We can see that the animation timing has changed and it's trying to catch up with its regular speed. Hopefully you won't need to use this option as I will try to provide pretty low poly characters to be animated, but it's important to note it. With Control + Shift, plus left click, you can select all the keys after or before the play head. You can press B click and drag or just left click and drag to make a box selection. The timeline is mainly here to give you an overview of your animation. I never use it to work on my current key frame. The summary line is just here to let me know if there are a key frame on the current frame. Here, we can see we have a key frame on every single frame from zero to 30. This key frame belongs to different controller of our character and are stored into an action that is torn into the armature. We will discuss about armature later on, here I just want to show you the IRO key of the timeline. If I add a cube to the scene and add key frames to this cube you can see that now these keys are also displayed in the timeline. Selecting a key on the summary will select all the corresponding keys of the armature and the cube. This can be great to offset a whole set of keys. But if we want, we can only move, for example, the X location key of the cube. Another great feature of the timeline is that we can add markers. While you can use them only for organization's sake, they can be very useful to switch camera. When you add two camera into your Blender scene and press zero to go into camera view, you can switch from one camera to the other into the scene options. But if you will, you can go in the timeline and add a couple of markers. You can add them pressing M or going to Marker, Add Marker. Now, with one of my camera selected and one of the marker selected, I will go to marker and bind camera to marker. Now I will select the second marker, select the second camera and repeat the process or press Control + B in the timeline. In the 3D viewport, pressing zero, I will jump into camera view. And when I will play the animation, each time I will hit those marker, Blender will automatically switch to the bound camera. This is way easier and cleaner than trying to animate the camera. To summarize, we have seen that navigating the timeline is close to navigating any Blender editors. We have seen a bunch of different shortcuts. And we have seen that we can create different markers in the timeline and bind the multiple cameras to them so that we can jump from one camera to the other directly through the animation.

## 02-05-Understanding interpolations

Before we start animating our bouncing ball, one of the most important thing you have to understand is interpolation, timing and spacing. Timing and spacing are two of the 12 principles of animation. Interpolation is quite new since it's the computer that is doing the interpolation between two key frame while in the past, they used to animate everything by and adding drawings and drawings. Timing is the pace. It's the moment when the ball leave the ground, is up in the sky and then hit back the ground. It is defined by the key moment of the animation or in the extreme, the extreme high position and the extreme low position in this case. We have a timing of 12 frame to get to the highest position and 12 frame to get back on the ground. Spacing is the different of position of our sphere from one frame to the other. We can easily display the spacing by going into the object option, motion path, set the frame from zero to 24 and click calculate. Then there we create a curve that go through different point that mark the position of the origin of our sphere on each key frame. The distance between those points is our spacing and this spacing is based on the timing of our animation and the interpolation between two key frames. By default, blender interpolation is set to bezier. What it does is that it creates an acceleration when the object is moving from a key frame and a deceleration when it's arriving on the next key frame. These are known as easing out and easing in meaning that you are easing out of the key frame leaving it for an acceleration and you are easing into the next key frame slowing down before reaching or hitting its position. So basically with that we've a very slow motion and it accelerate along the way. On frame 12, it will reach its maximum speed. So the spacing will be the biggest. And when it will come close to frame 24, it will slow down. This is what the bezier interpolation does by default. You can change the interpolation mode by selecting all the key frame with A and pressing the T key. It will open the interpolation panel where we can choose which interpolation our key frame will be using. There are a lot of different pre-made interpolation but we only need to focus on very first one. To be perfectly honest, I never used all the others, but they can be very useful if you want to build fast motion for motion design, for example. But in our case, we will be mostly working using those three during the course. Let's select the linear interpolation. As soon as I will select it, the behavior of the ball will change and we will get a more robotic movement. In the motion path tab, I will click the update path and now we can see that the spacing between the different frames is always the same. The spacing is even. If we know compare and linear and bezier interpolation, we can see that the timing is the same. They reach the lowest and highest point at the same time but on the bezier, we have a variation of the spacing. So we have a variation of the speed of the ball while in linear it's constant. The linear interpolation is very useful for robotic moves or for wall cycles for example when the foot is on the ground. Back to our motion, I will select all the key, press the T shortcut and set it to constant. I will update the path and now we can see that the ball is changing position only when it reaches the next key frame. So it's considered a constant interpolation or no interpolation and it's perfect to focus on the timing of your animation. This is the kind of interpolation we use when we are blocking the animation. In most animation, blocking is the first stage and it's very important. And we will start blocking our bouncing ball animation in the next video. Stepped interpolation can also be very useful whenever you want to give the stop motion style to your animation like on this example. To summarize, we have seen that interpolation occur between two key frames, that we can change the interpolation mode using the T key, that the bezier interpolation allow acceleration and deceleration or easing in an easing out, that the linear interpolation has a constant speed while the constant interpolation doesn't show any interpolation and is good to check out your timing.

## 02-06-Blocking the bouncing ball

Let's start blocking animation of the bouncing ball. Here, I still have my basic interpolation. So with all the key frames selected, I will press T and switch to constant interpolation. This way our ball will snap on the different position we have previously set. The idea is not to get disturbed by any interpolation and focus on the timing and shapes of our ball. Since our animation will be cycling upon 24 frame, the frames zero and the frame So my timing will be a bit off if I read both frame zero and the frame 24. So I will reduce the length of my animation from frame zero to frame 23, talking about Shape. We will here now look at the squash and stretch. If you're into animation, I'm sure you already have heard about it. If you look for squash and stretch ball on YouTube, you may find this video. I put the link in the documentation . When the ball gets thrown at high speed on the surface, and it touches it, it squashes. With the power of the impact, the ball get tighter, but it's volume has to be preserved. So it also gets larger. But in this case, squashing will bring to us two information. The power of the impact, and the softness of the material of the ball. Regarding our animation, if we consider our frame zero to be the frame, where our object will touch the ground, we can go like one or two frame forward and start squashing the ball by scaling it on the Z axis down, but also scaling it on the X and Y axis. This way we will have some all volume preservation. You can see here that the key frame, hasn't been written, as I need to enable the auto recording. Since I haven't written any scaling key frame previously, you can see that the ball remained flat. I will just press ALT + S to reset the scale on the first frame and on all the other frames. As we have just created the scaling key frames, they have just been added to our animation. And so by default Lendo will switch their interpolation to basic. So we can see that our location is still in step mode, but we have a scaling interpolation. So I will select all the key frame press T and set them to constant. From there, we can work on the stretching of our ball. Stretching is physically less obvious when we are watching the tennis ball bouncing, but it's yet still here. So we can use stretching to input physical information to our bouncing ball, but we can also use it to input speed information. If we look at the very beginning of the video, we can see that the ball is blurry and it immediately translate to us some speed information. So why the ball is probably currently perfectly round, the way the camera is capturing it forms some kind of elliptic shapes. And we have the same feeling whenever we are watching something that goes fast. And if we watched a right hand of the scientist, we can see that his fingers are also blurred because his hand was moving very fast. It makes his finger looks a little larger and longer due to speed. When an object is falling and hitting the ground, it is at its maximum speed just before it hit the ground. On the frame zero, we can input stretching information by scaling the ball up and reducing it's scale on X and Y to preserve its volume. When the ball will leave the ground, it will also be it's highest speed. So I can duplicate frame zero and move it on frame three or frame four. The ball stretch, hit the ground, squash, and stretch again when leaving the ground. Just by looking those few frames, we start to have the feeling of the animation of the ball. And this is a very important input whenever we will be using the blocking method is that you have to feel your animation just through those poses. As told before, frame zero and frame 24 are supposed to be the same. So I will select frame zero, press Shift + D to duplicate it and move it on frame 20. From frame zero to frame four the ball is on the ground and then it's leaving the ground from frame four to frame 24. Timing wise, the ball should travel upward and downward almost evenly. So I can offset the up position to frame 14. This way, we have 10 frame and moving upward and 10 frame moving downward. As a more subtle detailed pass, what we can do is slightly squash the ball whenever it reaches its top position. This slight modification will translate the inertia of the ball whenever it's slowing down to its stop position. Currently our blocking is bringing the minimum information we need to go to the next step. All the extreme poses of the ball are keyed and we have a rough timing. For this very specific exercise, it could be enough for me to go into spline to go into the next step of the animation process but we can also input some more details into the blocking stage by inputting some intermediate poses or in-between. The in-between will help us figuring out the spacing of our ball whenever it's in the air. Our ball is making a eight meter high jump, so I will move it in between two, four meter and I will clear the scaling. Now, depending on where I will move this key frame, it will change the spacing of the animation. If I move this key frame closer up to frame four where it takes off, our spacing will be larger in the beginning of the jump than it is whenever it's reaching the highest point meaning that on frame seven, the ball will go faster than on frame 10, which is what we want because the ball is leaving the ground at full speed. So it will reach its mid-air position before frame nine. And when falling down it will be at full speed on frame 24. So it should be mid-air, closer to frame 24, than frame 14. I know spacing can be a bit complicated when you are on the blocking stage and it will be way more obvious in the next video. To summarize, during the blocking stage, we key frame the extreme poses, we make a rough timing paths, we can use breakdowns and in-between to input more spacing and timing informations. We can use squash and stretch to input speed and physical information.

Animation curves is one of the beginners' nightmare. But I want them to become your best friends. To display the animation curve of our ball, let's go into the graph editor. Right now, our curve looks a bit boxy, not really curved, and this is because we are still in constant interpolation. But it will help us reading them. The curve are just a graphical representation of the value over time. The yellow controller point accurately the different key frame we have inserted before. If I select the yellow point on the blue curve at frame 7, it has a value of 4. such as the Z location of our ball. And if I now display all the object transform channel in the graph editor, we can see that the Z location is highlighted. So the control point I've selected in the graph editor is the key frame value of the Z location of our ball. If I double click on one of these channels, it will select all the control point of the current curve. You can hide and unhide curve as you would do with any object in the 3D view. If I press Shift + H, I will hide everything but the selected curve. Or you can click on the little eye icon to choose whether you want to see or not the curve. With G, I can move the curve. I can press G+Y to constrained the movement on the Y axis or G+X to constrained on the X axis. Before we start reading those curve, let's get rid of any of the curve we don't need. Since our ball is not rotating, we can get rid of all the Euler rotation curve by pressing X. And we can also get rid of the X and Y locations since our ball is just moving up and down. This is a good practice to get rid of any unwanted channel to keep your graph editor clean. We can find the Z corresponding value onto the control point of the curve, but also in the transform channel of the object. Pressing the N key will open the F-curve panel. This is a little (inexact) here to check the position value and interpolation mode of the key frame channel. Let's now select all the key frames, press T, and switch to Bayesian interpolation. If we now play the animation, we get way smoother motion of the ball. When you switch from step mode to Bayesian mode or curve mode, we call this the splining stage. If we have a quick look to our curve now, we can see that the Z location curve is getting higher value when the ball is getting higher. I will unhide the scale channel by clicking the eye icon. I will select the first controller point of those curve and press the dot key on the Num pad to zoom on it. You can easily identify the Z scale channel, which is in blue, allow us to control the height of the ball. And the X and Y that are one on top of the other that allow us to control the width of the ball. Let's check a couple of example to betterly understand the behavior of the curves. In this example, the curve is controlling the rotation of the arrow from a value of -90 degree to +90 degree. The curve is rising rapidly before easing into the frame number 24. And when we scrub through the animation, we can see that we have big spacing in the beginning of the animation, and it gets lower in the end. You seeing the motion we will have a preview on the spacing of this animation. And now, we can obviously see the difference of spacing during the animation. And the more vertical the curve is, the larger the spacing. The more horizontal it gets, the smaller the spacing is. In other word, the more vertical the curve, the faster the animation. The more horizontal, the slower. In the next example, let's consider the X location curve of the ball being the time. It goes forward in a linear fashion Now, if I activate the Z location curve, and I frame it properly, look at all the Z location curve and the motion path we on in the 3D view port align or are comparable. Again, when the curve is vertical, the sphere will rise rapidly. And as the curve gets more horizontal, the sphere rise slower. So if I now give an S shape to my curve, the ball will move slowly in the beginning, then in the middle of the animation, it will accelerate as the curve get more vertical, and in the end, it will slow down. We are creating an easing out from the frame zero into an easing in the frame 24. And since we still have the linear motion of the sphere on its X axis, we can see that the Z curve really looks like the motion path of the sphere. Since my sphere is moving on the X location in a linear fashion, any modification I will add to the Z curve will show in the 3D view as in the graph editor by updating the motion path. You can use the few example available in the file to play with the curve and recalculate the motion path and check out the spacing. Back to the rotation example, I've modeled the curve so that I have a fast acceleration in the beginning, then a plateau, and then an ease out and ease in. And it absolutely reflect on the motion path. The pretty vertical shape of the curve on the first two frame generate a big spacing. The plateau shape or flat shape of the curve indicate that the value is not changing over time, so the arrow will stop, while the final S shape of the curve show an acceleration then a deceleration into the final frame. To summarize, we have seen that a curve is just a representation of the evolution of a value over time. The more vertical the curve shape, the faster the value change. And it translates in bigger spacing. The more horizontal the curve, the slower the change. Motion wise, it translate in smaller spacing. A flat curve indicates that there is absolutely no change in the value and so no motion.

## 02-08-The graph editor

[Presenter] Let's have a deeper look to the graph editor. In the previous video, we have seen that those curve are just a value evolving over time, and those controller point are the keyframe values. Each of those controllers have two handles that can be used to change the way the interpolation is set. And they work exactly as handles will do whenever you are editing a 3D curve in the 3D view. Those vector handles has different pre-set behavior. We can access them by pressing the V key or going into the Key option of the editor of the graph editor. By default, all the keys are set to auto clamp. You can see the handle type of the selected keyframe in the F-curve panel. When the keyframe is set to auto clamp, Blender will try to interpolate from one key to the other in the smoothest fashion. But as soon as I try to move this key beyond the previews of the next frame, the handles will become flat. So, it's clamping the value of the curve to the current keyframe, avoiding any overshoot. If we swtich to automatic, we will have kind of the same behavior, Blender will try to keep as much interpolation between the previews and next frame, but in this case, it won't avoid the overshoot. Curve wise, an overshoot is a bump in the shape of the curve, making the value jumping up or jumping down. This is not a handle type I use that much because sometime I feel like it's behavior is a bit unexpected. As explained before, handle type are set to auto clamp by default, but as soon as I try to scale the handle or rotate them, you can see that it switched to aligned. The orientation in scale of the handle are no longer controlled by Blender, but by yourself, but Blender will keep the previews and next handle aligned one with the other. This allows you to keep a smoothest curve interpolation, but if I switch the handle type to free, then each handle can be manipulated freely without caring about the previews of next handle, allowing us to break the curve which in a lot of case can be very handy. The final handle type we have to see is the vector handle type. As soon as we select it, the curve will break into a odd angle. Each angle will point individually to the previews on next keyframe and as soon as I try to manipulate one of the handle, it will switch to free mode. It's a very useful type of handle whenever you want to rapidly create a linear interpolation. Setting to consecutive keyframe to vector will create a linear interpolation and then, the cool thing about vector handles is that whenever we are moving the keyframe, they will always be pointing one at the other. I use this type of handle a lot for impact frame. If we change the interpolation mode of our curve to constant or linear, we won't get any access to the handles, because the interpolation is pre-made. It's where there no interpolation or a linear one. Adding handles doesn't make sense in this case. In the previous video we have seen that we can double click onto a channel to select the curve, we can box select, press A, press control shift and click before on after a keyframe to select all the previews on next keyframe. If we click the little checkbox, it will deactivate the current channel. Now you can see that the Z location on the character is no longer animated and is not jumping anymore, which is kind of fun. The wrench icon allows us to activate or deactivate curve modifier. To add the modifier to a curve you just need to select one control point of the curve, then go into the end panel and switch to modifiers. There are a lot of different modifier, let's just add a noise modifier to understand what they do. As the modeling modifier, you can use them to procedurally generate new behavior for your item. The noise modifier is super cool to create camera shake or to bring texture to your animation. The lock icon will allow you to lock the current channel, making any further modification impossible until you disable it. The magnifying glass on the top left will allow you to search for specific channels. It's very handy whenever you want to isolate a channel like the location channel without having to hide everything else then un-hide everything. Just type what you want to work on, then everything else will disappear. All the previous navigation showed that we have seen when we have studied the timeline of the same, the home key will frame everything, the dot key on the notepad will zoom into the selection and you can use the P key to set a temporary preview range into your animation. Alt and P will clear. When working with curve, we are working with values, and fortunately those values can vary a lot. Some curve will have a small arrange of value, while other curve might have a big range of value. And in this case, you can see me struggling, going back and forth to select into different values. The normalize option allow us to convert to this big range of value to a range that goes from minus one to one. So it doesn't change the value of the curve, it changed the way the value is displayed. It makes it a bit handier to work on the higher range of values. If I disable the auto update, I can move any value beyond the threshold of minus one and plus one. Then I will add the vision of the modified curve, but if I enable it, as soon as I move beyond minus one, the curve is not canceling the move, but it's re-updating it's position into a minus one to plus one range. So as you can see, when I move the extreme position, it does quite change the shape of the curve in the inside. I don't use it that much, but it will make more sense if you manipulate it. By default you will see the curve of the transform channel of the displayed animated object, in this case, the controller of my character. If I hide everything but those few controllers, you can see that I only have those listed in my graph edit. When activated, the selection filter, only selected object will show their animation curve. When enabling to show hidden, it will show absolutely every control channels available, whether you hide those controller or not, the curves will still be displayed. The only show arrows options will show you curves or keyframes that are no longer assigned to anything. Can happen sometime during whenever you delete a bone in edit mode and you didn't clean the animation later on. It's very specific and we don't really need to know more about this right now. The ghost curve option will display you the previous unedited shape of the curve. This is something I never use, to be really honest, but it can be useful for you if you find any interest in it. Click back on the crossed button to get rid of it. I won't go through the whole effect of menus since there are a lot of options that are self explanatory. I believe this is cool if you are working on multiple object at once for motion design, for example, and you want to clean your selection. They are different ways you can snap your different keys on the grid. By default, it's set to nearest frame, meaning that whenever you're moving your key on the X axis, it will snap right onto a frame. This is the option I use 99% of the time. If I use the second step, it will snap on every second. So, in our case, every 30 frames. In the view option in the header, I can enable show seconds. Since my document is based to 30 frame per second, whenever I try to move the key, you can see that it's not to frame 30. You have seen previously that pressing M, we can add a marker on the timeline. You can add them also in the graph editor because the graph editor is just another version, in a way, of the timeline. And if I then switch to snapped to nearest marker as soon as I will move my key, it will snap on the nearest marker. Finally, you can get rid of the auto snap switching to no auto snap. It can be useful in certain case when you are, for example, scaling a wall animation and you don't want every keyframe to snap to the nearest frame, but don't forget that Blender will read the value on one frame, not reading between. Be cautious with it because the value read by Blender might not be the one on your key, this can be a bit confusing. As in the 3D veiwport, you can use different kind of pivot point to edit your curve. The bounding box center will take the most extreme keys you have selected and it will set the pivot point right in the middle. As in the 3D view, you can see this dotted line showing where is the pivot point compared to your mouse cursor. The 2D cursor, as act the 3D cursor, you can place it by shift right clicking on the grid and it's position is defined by those two blue lines, the play at and a given value. With my key selected, if I press S and Y to scale on the Y axis, you can see my keys are pointing toward the horizontal blue line. This is a good way to set the same value to several keyframes at once. The individual origin pivot point is the one I use the most. Each keyframe becomes independent and whenever your scaling or rotating, it's manipulating each keyframe handles separately, allowing you to scale them and manipulate them without moving them onto the timeline. Rotating the keys with the bonding box option also move them on the timeline. As in mesh edit mode, you can activate a proportional editing. As soon as I edit one of my keyframe I can see the aerial (indistinct) of the falloff and using the mouse wheel, I can increase or decrease the size of the area of the effect. I don't use it that much, but it can be very handy whenever you are dealing with high density keyframed curve like baked animation or motion capture. As the mesh editing falloff, it comes with different curves that will behave in a different manner whenever you are moving your point. You can access new display option in the view panel. Whether you want to show or not the sidebar you can access it by pressing N. You can enable the operator box that is available in the 3D veiwport too, but I don't think it's that useful on the graph edit. The show cursor option will hide or unhide the original line of the 2D cursor. You can activate the show sliders option if you want to access the value of the keyframe directly in the channels panel. I never use it, but it definitely is handy if you want to fine tweak your values. You will find other option to display or not the handles of the keyframe, but I do recommend you to keep them displayed and I also advise you to only display the selected keyframe in those or your graph editor will rapidly become a mess. To summarize, we have seen that we can change the handle type of our curve using the V key. We can use the normalize option to display a broad range of curved values into a minus one to one range curve value. We can see that through the graph editor we can hide or unhide curve, deactivate them, lock them or even add the modifiers. As in the 3D viewport, we can use different pivot point and constraint axis. We can use selection filter or quick search to make our selection easier. We can use proportional editing to edit multiple keys at once.

## 02-09-Polishing the bouncing ball

The time has come to give the final touch to our bouncing ball animation. To clearly understand what we need to modify, I will change the frame rate of the animation by going into the document option frame rate. Here, we can find a bunch of preset that will set the pace of our animation. We are currently using the classic 24 frames per second, but they generally use Here, I will select a custom frame rate and I will set it to five frames per second. Now, when I play my animation, it kind of play in slow motion. It's a good way to identify the different position of the bouncing ball, and it can be a method to spot spacing troubles. Switching back to 24 frames per second, I will select the object and go into the motion path panel. I will set the animation range from zero to 24 frames per second. And since this is a function I use a lot, I will right click on the calculate button and add it to my quick favorite. This way, when I press the cue key, I can access the calculate function anywhere in the 3D viewport. You can now see our spacing and try to see what's wrong with our animation. When an object is falling in space, it's accelerating until it touches the ground. The speed of an object might stabilize due to air friction. But unless there is a force pulling our ball up, it is simple to accelerate until it touches the ground. So the spacing should be increasing from one frame to the other while it's falling. And we can see this is what's happening on those frames. Each frames forward, the spacing is getting bigger. On the last frame, the spacing is getting smaller. It means that the ball is slowing down before hitting the ground and this is incorrect. And this is something that we can read on the curve. As explained previously, the curve should get more and more vertical as it get closer to the value zero, which is our ground value. While here we can see that it has this S shape that makes the ball slowing down before touching the ground. The curve is easing out toward the ground. But since we have made a good blocking of our animation, it doesn't look that bad. Those two breakdowns are currently helping us getting a better result. This is why blocking can be pretty important. To fix the ground key frames, we just need to switch the handle pressing V to vector. Now I no longer have this S shape on my curve. To make things even clearer, let's get rid of our two break down key frames by selecting them and pressing the X key. I've also switched back to basic ball handles. When I play the animation, you will better feel this ease in and ease out. You can see the ball accelerating when it's leaving the ground and before it hits the ground. While if I switch both handles to vector, now we can feel that the ball is bouncing. To get even a better feeling, I will also slightly raise the curve by moving both vector handles towards the outside. And by scaling the upper key, I will make the ball raising faster and holding a bit more in the air. I have bring more contrast into my animation by changing the shape of the curve, and now it's more stylized. A little touch we can add to make it even more appealing, is to slightly offset the upper key of one frame. This way we don't have the same timing when the ball is rising than when it's falling down. We can recalculate the motion path of our animation by clicking the update path button. And instead of the in range option, I've switched to around frame. From there I can choose how many frame I want to see on my motion path before and after the current position of the ball. Now, when I look at the spacing of my ball, we can see that when it's leaving the ground, it has the biggest spacing. And it's slowing down when reaching the highest position, which is correct. When the ball is falling down, we also get the proper spacing. It's getting bigger and bigger as we approach the contacting key frame. We now have a pretty cool bouncing rhythm, so let's work a bit on the scaling of our ball or more precisely on it's squashing and stretching. Pressing Alt+H in the graph editor will reveal all the curve. I can hide the Z location curve, so that we focus on the scale curve. Since our balls squashing is pretty brutal, we can switch those key frames to vector. If we have a very slow squashing, we will have kept them as it is, as the ball would be progressively absorbing the impact for its squash. Pardon for the animation, I'm trying to get a feeling of the motion of the ball. When the ball squash, we can imagine it's a continuity of its fall. And since we are working on the cycling animation, the latest frame is the same as the first. So if I check the frame before the latest, I can see that I have a big spacing between the base of my ball and the ground. So it will be better if I kept this thinner for the spacing of the squashing. Meaning that I will offset the squash pose of frame two on frame one. And we will have a very stretched pose on frame zero and a very squashed one on frame one. And so it will transition with the full better. We are now getting a more impactful squashing if we compare with previous version. But since we have offset one frame for the squashing, we should do the same for the stretching. As you can see my spacing between frame three and four is very small. So I want a faster animation. I will offset the keys one frame before, and I will also switch them to vector. Next is the air squashing. I offset the key frame where the ball recover its round shape and then it's getting squashed again with the inner star when it's reached the highest point. Since the highest point is on frame 15, I will make it squash on frame 15. I'd like to slightly delay the squashing, so what I will do is that I will duplicate all the keys on frame eight and offset them onto frame 10 or 11. It makes all the skate curve becoming flat, which means that from frame eight to frame 11, the ball is perfectly round. And as the ball will be accelerating to get back to the ground. I'd like to slightly offset the time it's starts to stretch by two frames because the ball is falling faster than it is raising. So making it stretching a little sooner does make sense. Animating is not a linear art, you will need to go back and forth a lot of time. And while the animation gets more appealing, I feel like there is something a little off and since we've been offsetting a lot of curve, the ball is starting to relax while it hasn't left the ground. Meaning that the ball should be in air on frame four. So I just need to re-edit the curve for the Z location and offset the stopping point by one frame. And now when they play again my animation, I feel like there is something a bit off on the air squashing. The ball slows and then it starts squashing. And if we double check the spacing of the base of the ball, we can see that as soon as it starts squashing, the easing gets stronger and that's better. The yellow arrows are getting smaller progressively, while there is a big difference between the two red arrows. So even if it's very subtle, it makes the animation a bit weird. So again I can fix this by simply offsetting the squashing key frames, the plateau we have created before just by one frame. Making it happening a little sooner, so that it will better blend while it's raising. I guess you may ask yourself how do I get rid of the grid of the motion path, et cetera my fried issue. It's by deactivating the overlay here. And since this is something I do all the time, what I did is that I set a shortcut onto the overlay. You can assign the shortcut to any tool or option in blender by simply right clicking on it and selecting assign shortcuts. I've personally used the shortcut power two which is just upon the tab key on my French keyboard. I'm pretty happy with this bouncing ball animation. And in summary we have seen that curve editing can dramatically change our animation. Good blocking makes your animation a little better when you switch to spline. It's important not to be afraid to break the curve using vector handles. Offsetting the key by one frame can really change your animation and make it look better on its troy. Don't forget that the devil is in the details.

## 02-10-Moving forward

[Instructor] We have left last video with our happy bouncing ball, bouncing and bouncing. But now, I'd like it to move forward a bit. So let's do that together. The first thing I will do is to press three on my num pad to switch to side view. Now, instead of making my animation loop over 24 frame, I'd like to make the animation a little bit longer. So I will re-open my timeline, and I'd like to repeat the animation four time. So I can tie in all time 24 frames to get to the right frame number. But the problem is that my bouncing ball animation is not repeating over those 96 frames. So the more logical method to make it repeat will be to select all my keyframe, duplicate them by pressing Shift + D, X to move them on the x-axis, and type in 24 so that they will be moved by 24 frame on the x-axis. Then, I can press Shift + R to repeat the operation. The problem with this method is that if we have any modification to be added to the animation, we will have to reduplicate everything or modify it on each bounce. While it's not super painful on such a simple animation duplicating only four time, this is not an efficient way to do it. So I will reset what I've done and with all my keys and curves selected, I will press Shift + E to open the keyframe extrapolation menu. By default our keyframe extrapolation is set to constant. It means that whenever I reach the very last keyframe in my animation, the value won't be changing anymore. That's why we get flat curve. But judging by this extrapolation menu, we can see that we can switch it to linear extrapolation or even make a cycle. You can also access the extrapolation operation through channel panel in the header of the graph editor. With all the curves selected, let's choose make cyclic. Boom, our animation is now cycling infinitely on the timeline. And the cool thing about using extrapolation is that modifying our animation will be repeating and updating the along the whole timeline. (graphic swooshes) With this problem fixed, I'd like my ball to move forward in space. So I'd like to animate the y-axis of the ball. So I will insert a single keyframe on the y-axis, go to frame 24, move the ball by about nine meters, go back onto the transform channel, right-click and insert a single keyframe. If I now play the animation, the ball will move forward only on the keyframe we have inserted, and since Blender is creating by default a new keyframe with the bezier mode, we have an acceleration and a deceleration of the ball so it doesn't look super unnatural. While this kind of locomotion could be a little more complex, we will consider that our ball is moving at a constant speed. So I will select both handle, press the V key and switch them to vector. You could have chosen to press the T key and switch to linear interpolation, but I prefer to use vector interpolation to keep the handles available. When I watch this motion, I feel like the ball should move a little further. So I can take my last control point and move it a bit up more or insert a new value in the transform channel and don't forget to insert the keyframe. Or we can directly change the value of the keyframe by going into the F-Curve properties and enter 10 meters in the value of the keyframe. This is a good method when you want to enter very precise values. Now, I'd like my ball to continue moving on on each bounce. So I could duplicate the last keyframe, offset it or insert a new a keyframe and set it to 20 meter. But again, if we want to modify the timing of our animation making the jump a bit a longer, I will have to modify those, too. And on a more complex animation, that would be very painful. So let's get rid of this and find another solution. If we go back to the extrapolation menu, we will find an option that allow us to create a linear extrapolation. Blender will take the last two keyframe of an animation, and it will do an extrapolation based on the value differences between those two. So that's a great step forward in our animation, but there is something that bother me. When our ball hit the ground, it stays on the ground for a few frame. The problem is that it's sliding currently, and it doesn't look good. I'd like the ball to stay where it is when it's on the ground and move forward whenever it's airborne. To fix it, I can simply duplicate the very first frame and move it on frame three, but I need this new motion to repeat along the full animation. So I will press Shift + E and choose constant extrapolation to get rid of the linear extrapolation. But now, my animation is no longer repeating, and whenever I'm re-adding a linear extrapolation, it will just continue on moving instead of stopping whenever the ball is contacting the ground. So I can try using a cyclic extrapolation, but the problem is that the ball will get back to its original position after each cycle. So I'd like it to cycle but with an offset. And what we can do is select one of the key of the curve an go to the modifier tabs here. And we can add a cycles modifier. So it works exactly as if we were adding the cyclic extrapolation, but we do now have option on the cycle behavior. I can change the way it act before and after the cycle. So if I go onto the after, I can ask Blender to use the repeat with offset. And what it does is that it takes the very last keyframe and use it as a new starting point. So offsetting the animation is currently adding it on top of the latest keyframe. (graphic swooshes) An extra motion is missing, though. If we watch this video, you'll find the link in the resources PDF, I'd like you to focus on the body shape and orientation of this lynx. During this gorgeous motion, we can see the squashing and stretching, but we can also see some rotation of the body. The body in the beginning is oriented toward the up point and then oriented toward the landing point. So we do need to input those information on our bouncing ball. To get a better preview of the motion of the ball, (graphic swooshes) I will calculate the motion path. As seen in the previous video, I will go into the object option, motion path and click calculate the path. I will change the path type to in range and change the end frame to 96. This will give us the motion path of our ball, and it's going to be easier for us to figure out how much we have to rotate it. The idea is to simply rotate the ball toward its next position or its next frame position. And once we have past the highest point, we will make the ball pointing toward the previous frame. Since our first frame is exactly the same (graphic swooshes) as the latest frame, or frame 24, I will jump to frame 24 and give the correct orientation to the ball. It seems that 11 degrees looks fine. Then, I will right-click and insert a single keyframe. A new channel has appeared in the graph editor. It's our X ruler rotation. So I will now go back to the frame where the ball is currently leaving the ground and rotate it by minus 12.5 degree toward its next position. So now as we have did before, I will duplicate the last frame, frame 24 of this ruler rotation, and move it onto frame zero, pressing Shift + D, X and moving it with the mouse. Now that the initial frame zero and final frame 24 are the same, I can select my curve and press Shift + E and make it cyclic, and it already looks pretty cool. So while the motion I'm seeing right now is pretty satisfying, you know that we need to check it frame-by-frame. As any craft, a perfect animation doesn't exist, and the level of quality you will reach depend on the time you can spend on your animation. In this case, I'd like to polish the animation a little more by making frame number one pretty flat, because I don't really like the fact that the ball is slightly leaning backward when it's getting in its flattest position. In the graph editor with the X ruler rotation curve selected, I will press I to insert a new keyframe and choose only selected. This way, Blender won't add any additional keyframes on the other curves and our graph editor will remain clean. Then, I can grab this key, move it on the y-axis, holding Shift to get a more precise movement. And I will call this first bouncing ball animation done. The technique we have used in this video, adding a rotation motion based on the location motion, the up and down motion of the ball, is called the layered approach. It means that you add layers and layers of motion during the polishing stage, not during the blocking stage. And we'll study this technique more in depth later on. To summarize, we have seen that we (graphic swooshes) can create cycles using the Shift + E shortcut and choose different extrapolation. We can access more advanced cycle option using modifiers. We can use current motion of the ball as the guide to add new motion to it in a layered approach.

## 02-11-Curve modifiers

In this video, we will have an overview of all the curve modified. In the graph-editor, whenever I select a curve, I can access the modifier in the end panel or properties panel. Why do we have already set a cycle modifier in the preview video? What you may haven't noticed is that we already using modifiers prior to this. As soon as we have used the extrapolation mode whenever we press the shift + E and make our curve cyclic, basically, we were adding a cycle modifier. Any modifier influence can be activated or deactivated by clicking the checkbox. The circle modifier repeat the animation from the first key to the last key. We can change the modifier behavior before the first key and after the first key, by default it's repeating the animation as it is. We can get rid of the cycle or use the cycle we've offset. If I use it right now, nothing will happen because it uses the position of the last key frame as the new starting point. But since my first and last key frame are same, it doesn't change. But as soon as I offset the value of the last key frame, you can see that I get some kind of ladder motion. The repeat mirror option will do what it says. It will repeat the curve but each time it will a mirror it based on the last frame. Changing the value will just set the number of repetition after or before your current animation. A value of zero will make the cycle repeat infinitely. The restrict frame range and use-influence properties are very useful but they are not the most abuse on the cycle modifier, so we will have a look to it later on. Let's have a look to the next modifier. I will get rid of the cycle modifier, and I add a built-in function. My animation curve as totally changed. And we now have a (indistinct) curve because the default function is seen. The first multiplayer will allow us to modify the frequency of the curve. While the amplitude will allow us to increase the value of the curve. The first offset will offset the curve on the X axis while the value offset will offset the curve on the Y axis. The restricted frame range option is a supercool additional tool as it is named, it will allow us to limit or restrict the influence of the modifier on the frame range. So we can set this frame range by tweaking the end value and the start value. The in and out value allow us to input easing, meaning that we can increase or decrease the influence of the modifier at the beginning and the end of the frame range. This way we can totally modify the behavior of the ball with a non-destructive workflow because I'm not currently working on any of the key frame, but only on the modifiers of that I can add or remove. By default The modifier is replacing our current animation but enabling the additive option will add the modifier behavior on top of our animation. So setting the amplitude of the modifier to zero is like removing it when it's in additive mode. And as soon as I increased its amplitude, you can see Oh, it's affecting the curve. While it works for the specific case, this is not the best way to play with the influence of the modifier. Fortunately, we have an influence factor that will increase or decrease the influence of the modifier on our curve. The dropdown menu upon the additive would enable us to change the type of functions. So if you remember your trigonometry classes you might recognize the tangent causing an (indistinct) curve This square root is a simple exponential function. So you can use it to make your ball rise like a balloon, with a constant easing, the natural logarithm does look like the square root but it has a slight offset and it ease more. Finally, the normalized scene looks like the scene function but it does ease very rapidly. So you can change this by moving the phase offset and the phase multiplier. So it can be hard to find a specific shoes for those modifiers, but you have to experiment with it. And when you do motion design, for example they are very useful. When adding the envelope modifier, We will see a couple of dotted lines appearing in our graph-editor lying with minus one and one value. These are scaling values or reference values, if you will. I will just a couple of points at the beginning and the end of my curve. Those control points will allow me to change the overall shape of my curve, also known as envelope. Those control points are defined by a minimum and maximum value that appears as little white dot on the graph-editor, they represent the current scale of the modifier. So, if I tweak the maximum value, I will see my curve scaling up and down, and we can clearly see the max point of the envelope modifier moving here. So it might look a bit abstract right now, so what I will do is that I will make the bonding box in a way of my envelop modifier as big as the curve. To do so I will set the minimum value to zero like the minimum value of my key frame and the maximum value around eight, like my key frame. I will add a couple of control points and I will give them the same value, zero and 8.4. Now you can think of your curve as being bound by your lattice modifier or being transformed as in Photoshop, we've an even transform. And by moving the value of the control point, it's like moving the corners of the bonding box. And as into a lattice we can add more than two control point. I can add a control point in the middle set its default value as the other. And when I move it, it will break the curve and deform it from its position. Very powerful modifier to modify the amplitude of the motion. The noise modifier is one of my favorite. And guess what? It noise to your curve. It's perfect to create camera shake Or if you are a shaky character you can use the noise modifier instead of Nkit. The scale will change the frequency of the noise, the phase we kind of change its shape or it seeds. The strength is the amplitude of the noise, the depth value is the smoothness of the noise. To see it properly, I will increase the scale and the strength. As I reduce the depth value, you can see the curves smoothing. The offset, allows you to offset the noise on the X axis or in time, if you prefer. So, using the noise modifier and the restrict frame range, I can create a slight shaking of the ball whenever it lands. The limits modifier works a bit as a limit constraint. Setting a minimum Y value and maximum Y value, will clump the value of the curve. Any value beneath the minimum value will be ignored, any value upon the maximum value will be ignored. It's like creating a roof and the ground that will bond your curve while the minimum X and maximum X value will currently ignore any values that is before the set frame or after the maximum set frame. So, what if I set the X maximum value to 10, any key frame value after the frame 10 will be ignored. This can be very useful if, for example, you don't want the ball to go under the ground. The next modifier is the stepped modifier, it's a very cool and intuitive modifier. The step size allow you to change the length in frame of the step in your animation. So, basically, this modifier is converting your curve as if we were blocking our animation with constant interpolation and it gives a fantastic stop motion style to your animation. So you can change the step size value, you can offset it in time. And this modifier comes with a built-in starting frame and ending frame. It's a bit like the frame restrict range but you can consider it as an additional restriction layer. On the full character, we will need to add this modifier on every single curve. What we can do instead is add the modifier on the NLA strip. Don't worry. We'll talk about the NLA editor later on, but just consider that we're applying the modifier to the wall animation instead of applying it to a simple curve. If we have a loop to this quick animation, I've made with one of my students, the step modify your really brings the stop motion feelings to the animation. As explained before those modifier act as object modifiers. It means that they can be layered, you can add multiple curve modifiers to get different results and the order in which you stack those modifier is important. If I add the limit modifier before the noise modifier, the noise will be applied after the limit and so I won't see any difference. I won't see the limits applied. At the time I'm recording this video on blender 2.91, I haven't find any way to move the position of those curve modifier. Hopefully this will be updated whenever you will be able to watch this video. We can copy a modifier by clicking on the little folder icon with the arrow getting inside. To paste the modifier on another curve just select two curve and click the second icon with the folder shape and the arrow, getting out. If you have multiple modifiers, they will be all copy and pasted onto the curve. To summarize, we have seen that we can use modifier to modify our curve behavior procedurally and in a non-destructive manner. Modifier can be stacked one on each other to get more advanced result. Modifiers can be copied and pasted from one curve to the other. We can add the modifiers on the whole action for the NLA editor.

## 02-12-Dope sheet

[Instructor] Before we go further and talk about the dope sheet, we need to talk a bit about Blender's data. If you're beginning with Blender, the most common data you are manipulating is the material of an object. You may have watched tutorial where you create a material and then you share it on multiple object. For example, we can see this blue material applied to the Suzanne head. If I select the cube, I can go into the library and apply to it the blue material too. Both object are now sharing the same material or sharing the same material data. With my cube selected, if I apply again the blue material, I will see the number two appearing next to the material name. This number indicate how many object or users are currently using this blue material and it's current two, the monkey head and the cube. It means that if I change the color of this material, it will be changing on both object because it's the same data that they are sharing. So as explained in the very first video of this chapter, objects are just containers and if I go to the mesh data, I will also find a data library that will allow me to source any other mesh data from any other object. With the cube selected, if I select the sphere mesh data, my cube will be transformed into a sphere and Blender indicates us that there are two objects using those mesh data. We have also seen that the object has changed color because the material is bound to the vertices. By loading new mesh data, we have also sourced the material data linked to it. If we now go back to our bouncing ball animation, with the graph editor open, I can see that I'm working on the ball but just under, we have the SphereAction.002 that we haven't talked about. And when we look at at our graph editor hierarchy, we can see our mesh object, the ball. The SphereAction.002 is bound to the ball and all the transformed channel keyframes are bound to this SphereAction. Instead of the graph editor, let's open the dope sheet. Let's consider the dope sheet as being like the timeline. All the shortcuts and features we have seen with the timeline works within the dope sheet. We can see our mesh object and the action in the hierarchy. If I now enable the collection cone, and I start animating the location of the cone by inserting a couple of keyframe, a new hierarchy appear in the dope sheet. We can find our cone object with a new action called coneAction. As soon as you insert a keyframe on an object that hasn't been animated yet, it will automatically create a new action. This action are the name of the container that contain animation data and the dope sheet is an overview of all the animation data that are being used in our scene. Here we can see which container is using the animation data and what action is being used but now what if I want to edit those animation data? We can access them through the action editor. With the action editor, we will be able to work on a specific action at a time. With the cone selected, I can see that I'm working on the cone action and as for any other kind of data, if I click the action icon, I will access our action library. So it means that as for material or any kind of data, I can share this animation to any other object. So I will select my SphereAction.002, rename it bouncing ball and when I play the animation, I can see that now my cone is moving as our bouncing ball. And near the action name, I can see that I have two users of the bouncing ball animation. So I can share this animation on as many object as I want. I can give it to Suzanne here and now we can see that we have three users and when I play the animation, our Suzanne monkey head will move as the bouncing ball too. Since I've given the bouncing ball animation to all my object, the point action, for example, has no more users. And if I brought my action library, I will see this little zero in front of the coneAction and you have to be very careful with that because whenever you have any kind of data that has a zero in front of its name, then they will get rid of this data as soon as you close the software. So if I revert my scene, now reopen it if you will, the coneAction marked with a zero has disappeared and I've lost this animation. To avoid losing an animation, you can click the little shield icon that will create a new fake user. Whether the data is used or not, then I won't flush it on restart. As we have seen before with the materials, as soon as a data or an action is shared, editing it on one of the object will affect any other container that is using the same action. If you want to duplicate the current action, you can click the number next to it's name. This become a new action or a new data that you can edit freely and you can see that there is not more multiple users on this one. And this new duplicated action has been added to the action library. To definitely get rid of an action, Shift + click the cross icon. When reverting the file or reloading Blender, the animation data or the action will be removed. If you're starting fresh and your object is not animating, you can press the New button to create a new action. I will insert a couple of keyframe to illustrate one thing. When you get this orange continuous line between two frames, it means that the value is not changing. As soon as I enter a value on one of the transform channel, we can see that now there is no more this orange line on the z location channel. Switching to constant or linear interpolation will create a green line between the different keyframes. So it basically tells you that you are not choosing Bezier interpolation. Changing the handle type of your keyframe will be also displayed in the action editor. You will see the shape of the key currently changing. The action editor will become our main editor when it comes to animation before we jump into the graph editor. To summarize, we have see that the dope sheet shows us all the current actions that are being used in our Blender scene, while the action editor allow us to edit one action at a time. Action is the name of the container for our motion or animation data and as any other data, an action can be shared by different object.

## 03-01-Chaper introduction

[Narrator] Welcome to chapter three. You are beginning in animation and this chapter is one of the most important chapter. You will learn everything you need to know to create all the squirrel animation used in the first course teaser. We will warm up through some bouncing ball exercises where you will be able to sharpen your motion technique and get familiar with the use of an armature or a rig to animate. I will mix those exercise video with some theoretical videos where we will explain the core concept between world space and local space, overlapping, follow through and overshoot in an animation. The different steps of animation creation, blocking, breakdowns, in between going to spline and polishing the animation, understanding ox, timing, and spacing. We will also have an in-depth look to the NLA editor. This is a very important chapter as you will learn all the fundamentals and as I would repeat it along the way it's very important that you make every exercises. If you want to get good at animation and be able to create all those animation you have to animate. Watching those video won't be enough. Make those animation, don't be afraid to fail. It's a part of the learning process but if you carefully follow the different steps and understand the core principle, you will rapidly get to a satisfying result, let's get started.

## 03-02-Local and World space

[Instructor] Before we start animating our query character we need to understand the difference between world space and local space. If we have a look at this world object, as soon as I will change its value on the x-axis, it will move on the x-axis. If I change the Y the Z, it will follow the global axis, also known as world axis. So our sphere is currently moving following world space. If I now rotate my planet on the X axis, we can see that it's Y axis is no longer aligned with our seen axis also known as world axis. But if I change it's Y value, it will still slide along the Y axis of our world space. And this is because on any object, transform channel are read in hierarchy. The first transformed channel read are location, then rotation, and finally scale. That's why the rotation doesn't affect the location transform of the planet. It will be such a pain to animate or to read curve. But since scaling is read or is performed after rotation, we can see that when I scale on the Y, X or Z, it does follow the local space of the planet. To better illustrate what is local space let's display the Bob collection. This is Bob, and as you can see, he's aligned with world space. His head is pointing upward along the Z axis. His origin point is slightly offset from the center of our scene. And we can see this in its location coordinates. So what I will do now is to place Bob on our planet earth. So we can see that Bob has no rotation and is slightly offset from the Z axis. I will now parent Bob to the planet. So I will first select Bob, then the planet and press control P objects. Now, Bob is a parent of our planet object. And as soon as our planet object move or rotate, Bob will follow. When rotating the planet on the Y axis, we can see the coordinates in the rotation channel. And if I display my planet axis, we can see that they're aligned with Bob axis. So Bob has been rotated in world space his Z axis is no longer pointing up. But if we have a look at his rotation coordinate, we can see that they are still to zero. Because while the word has been rotated, Bob, hasn't rotated, he hasn't moved off an inch. He has visually rotated in world space but in its local space, he hasn't rotated. It's like when you are driving a car, you are moving in world space because the car is moving, but you you're not moving, you're still sit in the car. You are a child of the car. So if I now edit the z location of Bob, we can see that he's moving along its own Z axis, also known as local space. So world space correspond to the axis in our scene while Bob local space correspond to the axis that are displayed on top of his head. So if we now have look to the graph editor, whenever I will move the X curve of my planet, it will follow the world space as our bouncing ball previously. But if I now do the same with Bob, I will see that will be offset on its own X location, on its local space. And this is a very important concept when we will start animating characters. Think of the hand parented to the arm, we will need to animate it in its local space. As the hand will be the child of the arm. On top of this, we still have our channel sequence, meaning that the rotation occur before the scale and after the location. So I can still rotate the character in its local space and then scale it afterward. And both rotation and scaling will follow its local axis. So, basically you are always animating in the local space of your character, object, whatever. But by default it's local axes are aligned with world space. But as soon as you have a parent and child relationship, there are great changes that they're no longer aligned with space. If you are using the gizmo from your transformation, you can switch it to local space. And a lot of animators uses the gizmo to animate and uses them with a local space. As I've rotated the planet and Bob is still a child of the planet, it's local space has been rotated, and we can see that the axis of the manipulator or gizmo are aligned. So when I use the manipulator to move Bob on its Z axis, I can see his Z coordinate changing. So the gizmo give us a great representation of the local space of our character. And it does also work well whenever I'm performing a rotation around the nexus. And we also have a rotation and scaling gizmo at our disposal. But you have to be cautious with those manipulator because they can be misleading. It's totally fine to use them to manipulate your character, but don't rely on them too much when it comes to figure out what is the local space of your character. Because if I do rotate my character and then try to perform a translation, the manipulator will be visually aligned with the local space of my character. But the location coordinates of my character wont be aligned anymore. Because the rotation is performed after the translation. So when I will be editing my curve, I will be editing the current Y movement I see on the screen right now. Because the curve's output has the value of the location, rotation and scale that we can see in the transform channel. And it's not the case of the manipulator. So if I really want to align the manipulator with the local space of my character, I need to reset any rotation on my character. And now they are aligned. If my character is rotating, moving it using the manipulator in local space, will currently edit different location values. I know it can be a bit confusing, but don't worry. It will make sense whenever we are animating. And you won't have to take all those things in consideration, but it's important for you to learn them to better understand animation in 3D space. When editing your curve with a bit of trial and error, their behavior will make sense, even in local space, don't worry. To summarize, we have seen that by default an object space is world space. In a parent to child relationship, the child will follow any transformation of his parent, but it's transform channel won't be modified. And this is because transform channels output the local space coordinate of an object. Transform channel are read in sequence with location first, then rotation, and finally scale. You can use the gizmo in local space to make your manipulation easier, but don't rely on them to figure out the orientation of your object.

## 03-03-Animating with an armature

[Instructor] From the time being, we've been animating only object. And we have seen that each time we try to animate a new object, the new animation or a new action data is created. And when it comes to animating an object, we are currently only animating at point, its origin point. But what if we want to animate a more complex object or a character, will we have to create an action for each finger, or do you bend an armor if it's not a separated object? There is one tool that allow us to do this, and you've probably already heard about it. It's a rig or an armature. So if you think of a human with character rig, it's generally a skeleton with a bunch of constraints and mechanism that allow the animator to manipulate the character in an intuitive fashion. And you can rig absolutely anything. Here is a new version of our bouncing ball. So there is a new object in my scene, I can find my ball object, but I also can find this ball armature object, and as an object, it has transformed channels. And as any other object, it's a container with specific data, we can't find armature data and bone data. Also as a specific object, it has a specific mode, an edition mode, that allow to bird the armature, and that is used by a riggers, so you won't need to enter edit mode at any time and a pose mode, that is the mode that will allow us to manipulate the armature and animate whatever character or object that is bound to this armature. We can change mode from object to pose by pressing Control + Tab. So let's have a closer look to this rig or armature. When in pose mode, you can select whatever controller you want, those are called bones, and you can consider them as being sub object of the armature. It means that each bone will have its own transformed channels and each bone have a specific behavior or a specific task such as being created by the rigor. On our bone domain controller is called the root and allow us to move the entire ball. Moving the green controllers allow us to use squash and stretch, the yellow controller allow us to rotate the ball. So instead of transforming the ball directly, here we are using those controllers to create those transformation. And it will allow us to create way more complex transformation on to a character than animating simple objects, because the armature can deform the object that is bound to it. The armature is actually a simple modifier that deform our object. So a versatile armature or rig will allow you to give the pose you want for your character and the good rig will give you the maximum of posing possibilities with intuitive fashion. So before we start animating this query character, I will give you some good practice when it comes to animating using an armature. (swooshing slide) With my ball rig file open, I will enable the Auto King and I will switch to pose mode by pressing Control + Tab. As soon as I transform one of the controller by selecting it pressing G, S or R as I will do for any object, I can see that my Auto King is recording what I'm doing and Blender is creating a keyframe for the transform channels of the controllers. The first awesome thing is that if I switch to the doc sheet in the action editor and switch to see all the keyed channel, I can see that all the different manipulator animation are stored into a single action because the action is associated to the armature object and we can consider each manipulator as being a sub object that can be animated. And as for any object, I can see that each of the manipulator has their location, rotation and scale key, but each of those controller has a specific desk, for example, this rotation controller, if I try to move it or scale it, I can't. And when I try to rotate it, it only rotates around its x-axis. So instead of having a keyframe for every transform channel, that couldn't be better if I add only a keyframe on its x rotation, since I won't be using any other of its transform channel. So I've selected all the transform channel I don't want, And I will simply press X to get rid of them. Now, I will go a little further in time and I will try to rotate the ball. As soon as I rotate to rotation controller, I can see Auto King is on and the x value being arranged, meaning that it's being transformed but not recorded. But as soon as I release the transform Blender, right again, a keyframe on all the transform channels, and I can go ahead for a long time like that, removing the keyframe I don't want and whenever I try to transform this manipulator, Blender writes a keyframe on everything. So to get rid of this issue, we need to create what we call a king set. To access the king option, we need to go into the timeline. So the first thing I do is renaming the action and call it zero zero so that it will be first in the alphabetic order, king set ball. Now I will check each controller and for each transform channel that is locked, I will get rid of the corresponding keyframe because these are the only keys that will really serve the animation of the ball. In the end I only have instead of the 36 initial I had. So my action editor and my graph editor will sure be way cleaner, I now need to open the timeline. So I will drag a new editor and switch to the timeline. In the timeline header I will go to the king set and in the active king, I can see that I have a lot of different options. So I will choose rotation and I will try rotating my manipulator then Blender is still recording all the keyframe, and this is because we need to tell Blender to use this king set by clicking the arrow near the auto recording button and choose only active king set. Now when I try transforming my manipulator, all the rotation channel will be keyframe. So we are getting close, I will get rid of the unwanted keyframe and if we go back into the king set, we can see that there is a lot of option and the one that is interesting for us is available. From there Blender will only auto record the keyframe that has already been written, meaning that to channel where we have inserted a keyframe file to use this king set. If you haven't set the first keyframe before applying the king set, then the Auto King won't write any keyframe and if I try inserting a new keyframe pressing I, I will get this error message. Basically, I can't write a keyframe with the actual setup. To fix that, we only need to insert a keyframe directly into the transform channel panel, then I can get rid of the two channels I don't want, the Y and Z channel. There is another way to set the Auto King on available by default, it's by going into the preferences, animation, only insert available. It's really a matter of personal preferences. I personally use the king filter, please note that I'm using Blender 2.92 Alpha, so the position of the different option might change. All right, now you are ready to animate using an armature. We have seen that we can use an armature to perform more complex transformation, that an armature can deform the object that is bound to it. So the armature object is made of super object and called bone, each of those controller bone can be king, but Blender will create a single action that will hold the different key of all the controller of a single armature. It is highly recommended to create a king set to keep your dopesheet and graph editor as clean as possible.

## 03-04-Advanced bouncing ball

[Instructor] Now that we understand the very basic of using an armature, let's do a new bouncing ball animation but with some more advanced mechanic. For this animation, we will be exclusively working from a side view. It's like working on a So I will create a new action by duplicating our keying set and I need bouncing ball. It means that this action will keep the keying set we have created before or the keyframe we have inserted before. And I've enabled the only active keying set option in the auto keying and enabled the filter available. On frame zero, I will position my bouncing ball at about nine meters on the z-axis, using the root controller. This controller will allow us to move the ball in space, while the other will be used for secondary motion like squash and stretch and rotation or revolution of the ball. We can plan our animation by directly drawing on the screen. I'm holding the D key while left clicking and dragging on my screen to use the grease pencil notes. Here I've made a beautiful drawing of the path of the ball that we are going to animate. The idea is to bring a bit of physics into it so that it looks more believable and input a bit of damping until the ball stop. You can access your annotation in the view panel under Annotation and click the minus button if you want to remove it. As soon as you make a new drawing, a new annotation will appear. You can change the color by clicking the little vignette next to its name. These annotation are in 3D, so you can rotate around them and you can create new annotation layers or new annotation slot by clicking the plus button. If you make multiple drawing on multiple keyframe, a new drawing will be created on each frame, allowing you to do awesome animation with the annotation or a crappy drawing like this one. All joke apart, it's very handy whenever you want to review your animation or plan the next move. Let's start animating our bouncing ball. I will select all the existing key, press T and set them to constant so that we can start our new animation as we did before by the blocking stage. We will be animating in pose to pose by first setting our main keyframe on golden keys. Then create some in between and then start polishing. So I'm currently trying to match the different extreme poses of the ball. The different poses when it hit the ground and the different poses when it is at its highest point in the air. Seeing that I don't have a green line between the keys on my action editor, I figured there was still busy interpolation. So I've pressed T and reset to constant all the keyframe. As I've erased my annotation, I have a hard time figuring out the position of my ball. But there is tools that could help me and that we have already used. It's the motion path. So while I'm trying to figure out the spacing of the ball from one frame to the other, it would be easier if I add an ID of the previous position of the ball. So instead of fighting with my animation and my brain, trying to figure out or remember where the ball was in the previous frame, I will simply add up to the armature properties, not the object properties. And here I will find exactly the same motion path menu that we have seen previously but this time, we are using it at the armature level, meaning that I'm currently tracking my root ball. And I can track any of the bounce of the ball or even multiple bounce at once. I've previously set a couple of quick favorite I can access pressing the Q key. You can create your quick favorite or assign your own shortcut to any tool in the window by right clicking on it. From there, it's way easier to position the ball from one key to the other. I'm creating a new keyframe every five frame. This is pretty arbitrary. You could use every 10 frame or whatever. I'm used to use every five frame. And when all my golden keys will be done, I will then go into a slight timing path where I will move all those keyframe left to right to revise the timing of the animation. Here I'm writing the ultimate pose and then I will play my animation or scrub through the timeline to fill the motion. See if the up and down and forward motion feels natural. And this is something you have to train about. You have to train your eye about this. And this require experience. And you will get experience only by animating, not watching videos. So even if you are a more advanced animator, I advise you to do this exercise. And if you are a beginner, embrace failure. Failing is an important step in the learning path. The sooner you accept failure, the faster you will learn. And being a good artist is not really about your success but the way you bounce back after a failure and the way you learn from it. All right, let's stop our philosophical discussion here and let's go with animation. In my action editor, I'm moving all the keyframe of the ball on the timeline. The smaller the bounce, the fewer the frame I will have between two keyframes. And then I'm moving the latest pose pretty further away because the ball will be slowing down before it stops. So it will take some time to get there. To quickly manipulate the key, you can box select them as we have seen before or click the summary so that you will get all the keyframe underneath. You can watch my timing on the timeline but don't feel wrong if your timing is not the same as mine because it depend on the height of your bounce. And we will certainly revise the timing during the animation. But try to make it feel as natural as possible as soon as possible. We will now start detailing this blocking path, meaning that we will add a few more keyframe and input a bit of squash and stretch, using the upper and lower green controllers. I will start by adding those stretching and squashing information on top of the existing keyframes. As explained in the previous chapter, when the ball is contacting the ground, it reaches it at full speed. So it is full stretched. And since the first pose is the one where our ball has the maximum speed, it is the pose where it will be the most stretched. You can use the stretching controller to orient the ball toward its previous frame. Just translate it a little backward. This controller only allow you to move it using its location, not its rotation. The ball will automatically stretch toward the green controllers. I will then scrub through the next frame and with my green controller still selected, I will press Alt + G to cancel any location transformed on it. I will take the lower squash controller and I will push it up just a little touch to make the ball squash when it slow down in the air. I can see that I have a little interpolation between my keyframe, so I will select them all, press T and reset them to constant. This happen sometime when you try to add the constant interpolation on a single keyframe. So I will go ahead and input a bit of stretching and orientation to the ball on each frame and as I go along, I will reduce the stretching strength on each consecutive bounce because the ball is losing energy. Each time, I slightly translate the upper green controller toward the previous frame and when it's up in the air, I'm slightly moving the lower controller up. I have forgotten to insert a keyframe on each channels. So in the action editor, I will go on each keyframe, press I and choose all channels. I can now add some breakdowns or in between to my animation. This will really help me reading the animation in the blocking stage. So what we are going to do now is add the squash just after landing of the ball. Be very cautious with the squash and stretch because it translate the softness of the ball. If you're going to extreme, your ball will look like a water balloon. As impact occur on frame eight, on frame nine, I will slightly squash the ball. Then on frame 10, before the ball is leaving the ground, I will stretch it a bit toward the next position. To do so, again select the upper controller and press G to move it towards the frame 13. See how after the bounce I'm stretching the ball less than before? Because as it touch the ground, it's losing energy, so I can't make it stretch as much as when it was going to touch the ground. Again, I did a little mistake along the way. If you check frame 18, we can see that our bouncing ball is not touching the ground and I'm offsetting its root controller to fix the problem but the issue doesn't come from the root controller position but from the second squash and stretch controller. The lower one. When I inserted the keyframe on all the controller previously, I've forgotten to reset its position when the ball was touching the ground. So currently, this controller is still in its squash position as when the ball is in the air position on frame 22 and 13. And this is why the blocking stage is so important because if I was already splining my animation, I would have a hard time to stop this and I will be fighting this deformation with my curves. So with the lower green controller selected, I will go over all the keyframe and press Alt + G and you can see the ball getting back into its original shape. And now I can fix the root position on each of those frames. Now, to make my action editor a bit cleaner and more readable, I will collapse all the panel because I don't need to see all the channels and starting with the root bounce controller, I will duplicate the frame 18 and move it on frame 20 and get rid of frame 19. Since the ball position doesn't change between those two frames, I don't need to have a keyframe in between. And duplicating frame 18 on frame 20 will ensure I have consistency into my animation or at least onto the position of my ball when it's on the ground. I will also duplicate frame 26 on frame 27 because the ball is still on the ground on this frame. Then I'm checking each frame and I see that I need to revise a bit the squashing with the lower controller because it's still very strong on frame 29. So I press Alt + G to cancel it and then press G and Alt + Shift to move it on the z-axis very subtly. From there, I will play my animation several time to fill the timing. So I can see that on the first bounce, there is something a bit off. Having the first upper position on frame 13 is a bit too soon and we configure this in the timeline, the upper pose is on frame 13 and the contact pose on frame 18. So I only have three frame to get up in the air and five to fall down. So I will offset all the keyframe from frame 13 by one frame and then I will move all the keyframe from frame 18 or 19 by one frame back so that I get an even spacing between the upper pose and the lower pose. The first bounce uses eight frame to complete. So I guess we can use six frame to complete the second bounce. So frame 20 will be the contact post. And the final bounce could use one frame less. So our bouncing ball timing is quite logical. I start with an eight-frame bounce, then a six-frame bounce and finally, a four-frame bounce. It's totally fine if your timing is different. The important thing is to get this logical pattern between the first bounce and the last bounce with a decreasing number of frame between each bounce. This logical approach of motion will help us solve some animation problem later on. It's not a rule of thumb though because animation is also a matter of randomness. Our ball could be bouncing on an uneven ground, for example, so it will make the timing a bit off at some point. But in your learning path, it's important to understand the logic of motion. In this specific case, the fact that the ball is losing energy on each bounce so the timing between each contact pose will be shorter, in the next video, we will polish the animation using the graph editor. To summarize, we have seen that we can use the grease pencil annotation to plan our animation. Using the motion path display is important even at the blocking stage as it really help us figuring out the motion of the ball. We have to be careful when using squash and stretch because it does communicate the softness or the material of our ball. So ask yourself what kind of ball am I animating? We can tackle our animation timing with a logical approach. Our bouncing ball will lose energy on each bounce so there will be smaller and smaller until.

## 03-05-Polishing the bouncing ball

[Instructor] Let's polish our bouncing ball. The first thing I will do is select all the key, press T and switch to Bezier. Now we have interpolation between our keyframes and the first thing we can see that we get some slowing down or easing before the ball touch the ground. You can switch to the graph editor through the header or pressing Control + tab when you are in the action editor. I have activated the display selected only and I will start polishing the route of my ball. When looking at the curve, I can see that only the z and y curves are currently animated. All the rotation, scaling and x location curve are flat. To make my editing easier, I will expand the root panel and I will just hide all the curves that I'm not using, only keeping the z and y location curve. Remember what we have seen in the previous chapter. When an object is falling, it is at its maximum speed just before hitting the ground, so I can select my z contacting keyframe, press V and switch it to three and then rotate the left handle to get a proper curve. It already feels way better. But I'm a bit disturbed by the y motion of the ball. The frame just before it contact the ground looks a bit weird. And this is because we have easing on our y curve. The y curve has an S shape between the IS point and it's contacting pull. But as seen in the previous chapter, when a ball is falling, it is accelerating until it touch the ground but its motion forward is pretty constant because even if there is air friction that will slow down the ball, on such a motion, it's barely noticeable. So I can switch both handles to free our vector and align them to get a more linear interpolation. So as a first polishing path or splining path, I will simply repeat this process on each bounce. To get a clean viewport, I'm activating and deactivating the overlay with a shortcut I've set previously. So I will break all the z-axis handle by switching them to vector on the contacting frame. I will remove the intermediate frame on the y-axis because it's useless since we will create a linear interpolation between the contacting and air pose, switching our handles to vector. I will use this method each time the ball is airborne but on the final stage of the animation, I will keep the easing toward the very last keyframe. So as you remember in the previous chapter, I like to keep the ball a bit longer in the air generally just for style sake. So on the z curve, I will take each key where the ball is in the air and I will slightly scale the handles. This way, the ball will rise a little faster in the air and it will be kind of thwarting a bit. Please consider that animation is not a linear workflow. And I will remove some keyframe, remove them, retime some part of the animation and tweak it a lot. So it's a lot of back and forth before you achieve a decent result. And you can tweak an animation forever but there is a moment where you have to stop. Before the second bounce, I feel like there is a slight glitch in the animation because the ball is staying too long on the ground. So I will shorten this hold on the ground by one key, offsetting all the keys after key number 20. As it does improve the animation, I will do the same between frame 25 and 26. There is a hold on the ground but I feel it's too much. So I will get rid of frame 26 by offsetting it onto frame 25 so that on the very last bounce, the ball is staying on the ground only for one frame instead of two. If we now have a closer look to our y curve, we can see that we have a pretty logical pattern. Each time the ball touch the ground, the y curve get flatter and flatter, meaning that the ball is losing speed on each impact but when airborne, it has a linear movement. And as soon as it stays on the ground, we will have a slight easing from frame 29 to frame 43 when the ball is slowing down. Watching the animation again and again, I feel like there are still some glitches and some bugs I have to fix and when having a closer look at my z curve, I can see that I have some easing after the impact, which is not correct. So I will fix this. After those modification, my animation should look better but I still have some glitches. And this is because all the transformation we have done with the squash and stretch haven't been polished and haven't be retimed. I've made a few modification on the timing of the route of my ball, so now the other animation that were in sync during the blocking stage are no longer in sync. So I will deactivate all the other transform channel just to see my root motion. And now I can see that it feels way better. So there is still this moment where the ball stops on the ground but this is because we will have motion through the squash and stretch. So without the squash and stretch, it looks a bit weird but as I renabled it and as I will be polishing it, I will be able to fix the problem here. If you want your animation to look a bit more realistic, just remove those holding frame and just make the contacting pose on one frame. Then reduce a bit the squash and stretch. This is just a matter of personal preferences. I like it a bit stylized, so I'll keep those holding poses. I will now work on the upper squash and stretch controller. This one is going to be pretty easy to polish. I select the first keyframe and press on the dot key on the num pad to frame them. I'm mainly watching the orientation of the ball created by the stretching effect. You can also calculate the motion path of this ball if this does help. Here what I want is to give back a bit of verticality to the ball. So I will slightly offset the beginning of the stretching on the y-axis. I will hide the z curve by clicking the I icon and then select the first keyframe, press Shift + D to duplicate it and move the duplicated key on frame three. As it looks a bit too delayed, I will move back this key on frame number two and then I will switch the handle type to three so that I can shape a bit the curve. This way, I have a better feeling that the ball is currently aiming or pointing toward its landing spot. Then I will work on the z curve that currently squash and stretch the ball the most. And I will just switch the impact point to vector because this is an impact frame where the ball switch from squashing to stretching again. Then I will go onto the next jump. I will reselect my root bone and I will recalculate the motion path because it does help me figuring where the ball is supposed to land and also where the top of the ball is supposed to be pointing at and this is why here, I will slightly push the top to the ball forward toward the previous keyframe position by pushing my z curve a bit up in the graph editor. I scrub a bit onto my animation to see how it does move. Then I will select the z-axis curve, switch it to vector on this middle frame and then move forward toward the next jump. First, I feel like it's offset in time. So I will select all the curves and move them by one keyframe prior to the current one. The ball is currently leaning too much backward on on these three and I can figure this by watching the F curve value. When selecting the keyframe, I can see that its value is set to -65 and if I select the previous one, it has -56. It means that this last keyframe is further away from its value zero so it means the controller is offset more and so it's more deforming the ball than the previous bounce, which doesn't make sense since this bounce is less powerful, losing energy compared to the previous bounce. So I will push this keyframe towards zero in the graph editor. For the very last bounce of the ball, I don't want any deformation. So I will just get rid of the next keyframes. From there, we can watch our animation several time and jump into polishing the next squashing controller. I will select the lower green controller and since the curve are pretty small, I will use the normalize option to be able to see my green channel. Since we have used the upper green controller to give an orientation to the bounces of the ball, I don't need to do the same with the lower controller. So I will just make my y curve flat by removing the keys that are offset because they won't bring anything good to our animation and they are currently almost useless as their value is very small. So just get rid of them. Now regarding the z-axis that will allow us to squash the ball in the air when it's reaching its highest point, I want it to be very subtle. So I will offset the starting and ending keyframe of those motion by two frames. And I will repeat this process along the whole animation. I will shorten the length of this motion and as I go forward, I will reduce the amplitude of the curve because again, with energy loss, I will get the less squash and stretch on this motion. This controller allow us to add very subtle deformation to the ball, so it's interesting to make it as good as possible. When I'm done with it, we can clearly see the energy loss during the motion of the ball. I will fix the timing of the last squash because it doesn't occur at the right time. It's supposed to happen when the ball is at its highest point. And then again I can watch my animation several time to see if it looks okay. So that's great. We have a bouncing ball but it's not rolling. This is because we haven't animated the rotation controller of the ball yet. In this case, it wouldn't make sense to block the spinning of the ball. Since it doesn't change its shape, we wouldn't be able to see any change during the blocking stage. So I will select all the keyframes but the first one and get rid of them. Just press X and confirm. Then select the first keyframe and move it on frame eight. This is the frame where the ball is contacting the ground. So I get a flat curve from frame zero to frame eight. It means that the ball won't be rolling while it's in the air. I want it to start spinning when it will touch the ground and when part of the energy of the impact will be transferred to its rotation. I will duplicate again the keyframe and move it to move frame 18. This is where I want the ball to be spinning already. Nothing happens because I have disabled the transform channel. I need to reenable it. Now when I move the curve, the ball should be rotating but it's barely noticeable and this is because I need to unzoom in my graph editor. Since the value of the rotation is in degree, I need to drastically modify the curve and move it onto way higher or lower values in this case. Pushing the value down to -360 degree will make the roll spin forward. So that's fine. On the impact, the ball will get full rotation speed, so I will switch this to vector. Due to the frequency of the rotation and the animation, I have a hard time figuring out if the ball is currently rotating or not because the ball pattern seems to get aligned on each frame so it's a bit weird. So I will get rid of the overlay to have a better vision of it. I will also switch the second handle to vector two because the rotation of the ball is not supposed to slow in the air and since I still have some difficulties to read the rotation, I will enable all the other controller keyframe and disable their influence on the animation so that I can clearly see if my ball is rotating or not. The initial air rotation speed of our bouncing ball is not that important. What will be important is the final rotation speed because it will have to match the speed of the ball traveling on the ground. So what we need to do is to duplicate the current keyframe and move it on the next contact post. And we need to make the ball spinning a little less faster than the previous pose because it's losing energy on each bounce, so it's also losing rotation speed. Then we will create a last keyframe on frame 43. It's the frame where the bouncing ball is currently stopping in space. And this time we will switch it's handle type to Bezier because we need some easing in the end. We don't need a linear interpolation. The ball is slowing down so its rotation is also slowing down. To make this stage readable, I need the grid because I will need a point of reference in space to see if the pattern of the ball is still aligned with it whenever it's rolling on the ground. So I will re-enable the overlay and I will zoom a lot onto my animation. Now I will try to find the point of reference using the pattern of the ball and the grid. When I find it, I will Shift and right click on it to place the 3D cursor. Now what I want is to make sure that the pattern of the ball is pointing toward the 3D cursor as the ball stop. To do so, just zoom a lot and then fine tweak the position of your last keyframe. You will also need to slightly tweak the rotation or orientation and scale of the last handle to make sure that we don't have this sliding effect on the ground. Just do it by little touch. If you see that your animation is completely off, it means that your whole curve is completely off and the difference between your final key and the previous key, the key from frame 30 is way too big. Rotation easing when you have a contact pose is pretty hard to get right on the first shot, so be patient, tweak your curve until you get this nice rotation on the ground and the feeling that the ball is really rolling onto it. And if you can't achieve this, don't panic. Open a new Blender file and just make the ball rolling and stopping. Work on the curve until you get this animation right and you will understand the relationship between your rotation curve and your translation curve. It's not a question of math or geometry or whatever. It's just a question of practice. It might be a bit complicated at first but with a bit of training, you will get comfortable with this kind of motion pretty soon. And if you really want to get good at animation, it's very important because you will use animation curves every day. So from there, I can call this animation done but there were a few glitches that I wanted to fix. Those are little things, so I won't be going in details into it. I've just added a very small additional bounce at the end and I've a bit revised the z amplitude of my route so that the ball get a more even bouncing. So there is not much you will learn from the next step. I'm just refining some of the poses. I'm doing what we've been doing just before, slightly revising the timing, the amplitude of the curve, et cetera. What you need to understand is that again, an animation is never finished until you say stop. And just work your animation until you get to a point of satisfaction. If you're struggling with the animation, start a new one. And this is the only way you will progress. I've said this before and I will say it a lot of time during this course, you need to animate to become a good animator. You need to make this bouncing ball exercise multiple time until you will get a good result. This is how it works. I am still struggling to get a good bouncing ball result after several years of animation. And to bring a character to life, to animate a character, you need to first be able to give it motion and then you will input personality, input emotion but before you input emotion, even into a bouncing ball, you need to learn motion. All right, enough of philosophical discussion. Let's go ahead with the next video.

## 03-06-01-More bouncing ball

[Instructor] This is video is an exercise video or assignment video. I invite you to create two new animation using the bouncing ball and this parkour object. The idea is to launch the bouncing ball onto the surface. I've made two version of the animation, one with a very heavy bouncing ball, like a bowling ball that will strike the surface and almost stop and then will be rolling. And the second animation with a more squashy and light bouncing ball that will just bounce until it stops. You can find those two animation in the action library. I will explain you right now the key component of those animation and the next video will be a time lapse of me creating those two animations. It's exactly the same workflow as on the previous animation. And I will just double the speed of the video so that you can use VLC Player, for example, to slow down the video by 50% and get it real time if you need. On the squashy bouncing ball animation, instead of moving the screen controller to give an orientation to the ball, you can also rotate its root controller and use the squash and stretch controller only to squash and stretch the ball currently. So only on their z-axis. The thing you will have to check out during your polishing is the amplitude of the squash and stretch curve. As you go down the parkour, the ball will lose energy and so the squash and stretch will get more subtle and more subtle as you reach the end of the animation. So your curve must lose amplitude. For the heavy ball animation, I haven't used squash and stretch at all. To make the ball feels heavy, I've used very subtle bouncing and very short bouncing. The key point here is to remove the squash and stretch or make it very subtle and make the bounce very small and you will get this feel of weight in the ball. The second very important thing to watch out on this animation is the spacing of the ball. It gets bigger and bigger as the ball is falling toward the first surface. Due to its weight, the ball almost stop when it hits the surface as we are close to 90-degree angle and then the ball is accelerating until it touch the ground and then it will slowly lose speed as soon as the animation go ahead until it stops. The longer time it takes to stop, the heavier it will feel. You now have all the instruction to create those animation. The next video is the time lapse of me creating those two animations and then we will start working on our first character animation.

## 03-07 Overlapping, Follow through and overshoot

[Instructor] Before we start animating the squirrel, we need to talk about overlapping, follow through and overshoot. We talk about overlapping motion when a part of a moving object is delayed compared to the rest of the object. So when we have a look at the current animation, we can see that the ball is leading the motion while the tail is trained to follow. If we track the tip of the tail, we can see that its position is offset compared to the position of the ball. This is something we will use a lot for tails, clothes, whatever is hanging on our character, but it can be used on any part of the body, a relaxed arm on a walk cycle or even on this crab character, the eyes and the crab claws are currently following the body motion with a slight delay so it's also an overlapping motion. We can also say that those parts are dragging behind the body motion. A very important thing is those overlapping motion will communicate weight and stiffness of the material or the character you are animating. The more overlapping motion you will have, the heavier it will feel. The more overlapping motion you have, the smoother it will feel also. So it can also communicate if your character is relaxed or stressed. Follow through is a bit like overlapping motion. It defines the fact that some parts of our character are still moving after the character stops, so their motion is offset compared to the character. So basically an overlapping motion generates a follow through. And as explained before, it will communicate the weight and stiffness of your character. We generally use overshoot when a motion has a dramatical change in its orientation or when it's stopping. It's accelerating until it reaches its destination and we can see that it's going a little beyond its final position and get back. And this is what we call an overshoot. Curve wise, it's pretty easy to identify in the graph editor. We have those two key frames that have the same value so they are aligned on the y-axis and we have an additional key frame that goes a little beyond this threshold and create the overshoot motion. This is something we are going to use a lot because it convey weight, but also speed, impact, balance, a lot of things. It can be very interesting for a punch, for example, or to give extra appeal to a fast motion. And when you combine overshoot with overlapping motion or follow through, you can get very interesting animations. In this case, there is an overshoot on the first punch and some overlapping motion as the claws jiggle. Here, I just want to show you a quick example on how you can build convincing overlapping motion very fast. When opening the blender file, you will be directly on the action to do this exercise. With the first bone of the tail selected, I will try to spot the frame where the ball is currently moving the fastest and it's frame 10. I will select the x rotation curve of the tail, duplicate the frame and switch them to auto cleanse so that it's clean, and move the key value up so that the tail is dragging back. Since the animation is looping on 40 frame, there are great chance that on frame 30 I get the fastest motion of the ball the other way. So I will duplicate my current frame and move it on the negative side so that the tail is dragging the other way. Then as we are walking on a cycle, the first and the last key frame must be the same, so I would press shift D it to duplicate and to make a proper blending, I need to rotate to those two key frame using individual origin to align the starting and ending point with the current shape of the curve. Now to make it a little more stylish and interesting, I will select those two extreme and scale them up a bit. Since the overlapping motion is an offset of the current motion, I can select all the point of the curve and press control C to copy them. Then I will select the next tailbone in the hierarchy, make sure I only have the x rotation curve selected and I will press control V to paste the curve. Then to slightly offset the motion, I will press shift D to duplicate the whole curve and move it before the frame zero. This way I have twice exactly the same motion. And if I now move the whole curve by one or two frames to the right so I'm delaying it, I will get a dragging motion for free. From there, I can copy this curve, select the next joint or the next bone in the tail hierarchy and repeat the process. Select the X curve, press control V to paste the curve, I will align it with its original shape and then offset it a bit by three frames. So the idea is to use the same curve for each joint but offset it in time by one or two additional frames. Then you can play with the shape of the tail by changing the shape of the curve. Since I have a symmetrical motion I can use the 2d cursor as a pivot point. Its position is represented by the crossing blue lines and as seen in the previous chapter, you can place it wherever you want by shift right clicking, or going into the view option and set its value, here zero. Now I can press S and Y with all my key frames selected to increase the amplitude of the curve because I'm scaling the curve only on the Y axis so we will have a broader motion of the tail making it look more relaxed or heavier. This is a fast, easy and cheap way to get this kind of overlapping motion done. It will sure be a little more complex on full characters but that's a good tip.

## 03-08 Squirrel rig presentation

[Instructor] Let's have a quick overview of the squirrel rig. When opening the Blender file, you will find two object, our squirrel Armature and the squirrel object that is using an Armature modifier. The object is called a squirrel. And it has as all material. By default, you should have the Text Editor opened with this squirrel rig UI text file opened. When my rig is selected and in pause mode if I press the play button, it will execute the script and generate a little UI that will allow us to hide or display the bones of our character. The script doesn't run automatically, you will have to run it each time you will open your blender file. What if your script is not open because you don't have the Text Editor opened? you just go to the editors panels, select the Text Editor and in the Library you will select the squirrel rig UI and then just press the Play button. You can then close this editor area. The rig is pretty straightforward. The root bone allow us to move the entire character, the dorsal roots allow us to move the whole body and give it its orientation. But the legs won't follow. You will find a chest and a hip controller that can be moved, rotated and scape. The neck and head can also be controlled by one single bone that will behave the same as the chest and hips bone. You can then find some tweaker bone that will allow us to only rotate the neck or only rotate the head. Smaller controller bones are also available to be able to squash and stretch the head. Move the ears at will, close the eyes or move the tip of the nose. All the bone transform channels are already locked when they are not to be used making our keying set step a little faster. (whoosh) The legs are using inverse kinematic controllers, meaning that we are controlling the whole arm or leg by simply moving the end of the foot of our character. While the motion should come from the shoulder, then the arm, then the forearm to the end it's inversed. The arm controller is just here to be able to give an orientation to the elbow. On the back leg, we will also find an inverse kinematic from the foot controller, but the heel and knee orientation will be using a pole target. It's a bone that can move freely in space and the knee or heel of our character will be pointing at it. The tail use a simple forward kinematic bone chain. So it basically rotates or is being controlled from its root to its tip. We will then find a lot of secondary controllers that will allow us to move each joint of the character. They will mainly be used to fix some deformation or to add subtle motion to the character. The rig also comes with some custom property that we can access by using these bones. When the bone is selected we can find those custom properties in the item panel. Those properties will allow us to hide the legs of the character or the tail of the character. This will be really useful to isolate the body and clearly read it's motion. The tail follow option allow us to whether isolate on not the rotation of the tail. By default, the tail of our character is following the rotation of the hips and is aligned with it. But if we select the property boon and set this tail follow to zero, the tail is not rotating with the hips anymore. This will make our life way easier when it comes to animating the tail. So before we jump into animation, I will just create the keying set for our character by inserting a key frame on the channels that are going to be used and remove those that are locked. Nothing really interesting here. So I will switch to a time-lapse till the end of this video. (whoosh) (slow piano music)

## 03-09-Squirrel-Blocking The run Cycle

[Instructor] The time has finally come to animate our squirrel character. The first thing to do is to play the Squirrel_Rig_UI.pi script. It will enable our rig layer and we will be able to hide bone groups easily. You can duplicate our keying set action and create a new action that we call 01 Run cycle. And then double check our preferences by going into the Edit menu in the top bar, Preferences, Animation and check that the Only Insert Available is on. It will override our usual automatic keying set, making sure that we don't have any key that will be written if there is not an existing keyframe. If I move this knee joint tweaker controller, you can see that the auto keying is on but Blender is only recording and writing location keyframe for this controller. This way, our action editor is clean in the keying but on top of this, we can still use a specific keying set. And I will enable the whole character keying set. This way, when I press the I key to insert a keyframe, Blender will key all the controllers of my character and this is done on top of the only available option we have set in the preferences. When we were blocking the bouncing ball animation, I advised you to key all the controllers. And here is the reason why. I will rapidly block out a turn with a change of foot position. Our little friend is rotating his body to look to the right and he's also moving his feet accordingly. During most of the animation, his right front foot stays on the ground and it switches position only on the very last frame. Here I've done the blocking of those three poses, only keying the controller I'm using. It looks great in step mode but as soon as I will switch to spline, the right front foot will be interpolating from the very first frame to the last. And it doesn't look good at all. And I will have to move the keyframe, insert new keyframe, et cetera. While if I insert a keyframe on the whole character on each main poses, I will get a better behavior and the right front foot will only move from frame 20 to frame 30. So you may think this is not a big deal but believe me, if you have this kind of problem on the whole character on every leg, this is going to be a pain. And if you have the same issue with all the controller, the head, the hips, that's gonna be a nightmare. So key all your controllers during the blocking stage. The second step is to study references. You will find a link to this one in the documentation. It's very important to watch as much reference as possible and honestly, nowadays, it's not that complicated with YouTube to find good references of animals. I guess you already know what I'm going to show here is that the body of the squirrel is like the bouncing ball. Squashed when it's on the ground and as soon as it's going in the air, it is stretching. Basically, the chest of the creature is arriving first and then the hips are catching up. So when preparing an animation, you have to make this work of seeing the character as a whole piece. Look at the curve that make the body, for example. Once you have the broad detail, you have to go for the smaller detail. Look how the front feet arrive at the separated time. It's just one or two frame of difference but it will make your animation way better than if both end arrive at the same time. In animation, when we get something symmetrical or something occurring at the same time, we call this twinning. And this is something you should always avoid unless it is done on purpose. If you do the Hulk smashing the ground with both his hands, you want both to hit the ground at the same time. It will communicate impact and strength. But in the case of our squirrel, look at how breaking the symmetry looks way more natural. On the left, the character looks stiff, on the right, it looks way better. So don't forget to avoid twinning both in timing and in shape and let's get started. I don't know how many frame I will need to block or how long will be the jump but I will start by aligning the feet with the ground. One cool feature is that once I've positioned one of the foot, I can select it and press Control + C to copy its pose and you will get a copied pose to buffer message in the footer of Blender. If I now press Control + Shift + V, I will paste the mirrored pose automatically on the other foot. This is a shortcut I'm going to use a lot. From there, I will start posing the pushing pose when our character is preparing to jump. So I have my reference image on a second screen. So I invite you to have it always open and try to find the frame where the squirrel is preparing to jump. His body should be very squashed and the root of the torso almost horizontal with the ground. Starting with the back legs, I'm slightly rotating the foot toward the outside of the body. This way, I'm breaking the symmetry both from the side view and the front view. Then I will move its front feet right in between the back feet. I'm also breaking the symmetry, having one of the front leg slightly more forward than the other, one slightly more raised than the other. Then we need to squash the whole body by rotating the chest controller and the hips controller. You can also slightly move them toward the center of gravity of the character. Just think of your character as a box and this box has to contain the heaviest part of the character, the chest and the hips. The head and the tail counterbalance each other and if we draw a straight line in the middle of this pose, we can see that our feet are more or less framing this contact point between the vertical line and the ground, offering a balanced pose to our character. When blocking a character, you should always start with the most extreme position. So I will now block the airborne position. I start by moving the root controller by half of the length of the jump. In this case, I move it by 30 centimeter forward and then I will use the torso controller to raise the character. In most cases, you will use the root controller only to move your character on the y and x-axis. When I do a run or walk cycle, I generally deal with it without moving the root bone as if the character was on a treadmill. But it's a bit harder to read the shape of the jump. So during the blocking stage, we will use what we call a root motion. And when the animation will be finished, we will get rid of this root motion so that our character will be jumping without moving forward. This way it's gonna be way easier to use it as a run cycle and we will just have to move the root bone wherever we want in our scene. Don't worry if you don't get it right now, we will do it together later on. Back to our air pose. You can see that I've slightly stretched the body. So I've canceled the rotation on the hips and the chest and then I'm resetting them by hand. So this is something I advise you to do when you don't have a major change in the pose. You select the hips and the chest controller and press Alt + R and Alt + G to get rid of any rotation that was recorded on the previous pose. And then you create the new pose yourself. Blocking a new pose from a neutral one will push you to correctly look at your reference and force you to work on the shape of the new one. The back legs are pointing toward their starting point while the front leg are pushing forward to pull the whole body in the air. Both the front and back feet are currently pointing inward. It preserve balance and aerodynamism to the character. You can use the pull target and the rotation controller to fix the elbow and the knees of your character. Don't forget to scrub between your first and second pose to kind of feel the motion, the movement. Then to improve the pose, I will stretch my character even more and realign a bit the hips and the tail. During the blocking stage, figuring the overlapping motion of the tail is pretty hard. That's why I'm just working with the very first controller of the tail. We can work on the follow-through of the tail while detailing the blocking or even during the polishing of the animation. To finish the blocking of those extreme pose, I will have to guess the landing position. On the air extreme pose, I will set the root bone position to -0.3 and I will duplicate all the keys on frame zero and move them on frame 10. Since the airborne root position on the y-axis was -0.3, I will set the landing at -0.6, two time further. Now I scrub through the keyframe to feel the motion and I feel should be a little further. So I just need to select the root bone and on frame five, I will try a -0.4 and now I feel like I need to tweak a bit this pose to make the character a little more horizontal. So this is something important. Don't hesitate to revise your blocking. The blocking stage is the most important stage. And if you don't do it properly, if you don't spend the time now, you will suffer even more during the polishing stage. I can now push my root bone to the position -0.8 on the landing frame and now it feels like the squirrel is jumping too far away for me. So I will try to find an in between with -0.35 and -0.7. Compared to the reference, our squirrel is making pretty large jump to move forward but animation is not necessarily about copying the reality. It's exaggeration. And this will lead us to a peel. It's a but like making a caricature of motion. When you do a caricature, you try to find the cool feature of the face and exaggerate them. We are doing the same here with motion. In the next video, we will start adding breakdowns to detail the blocking animation of our character.

## 03-10-breakdowns

[Pierre] One thing I'd like to do early on is to determine the tempo of the animation. I'm still using blender default frame rate, which is 24 frames per second. And my ultimate method to figure out the rhythm it's to do noise with my mouth. (mimics bouncing) So we can argue this is ridiculous or not, but if you've ever animated before, I'm sure you've done this also. And this is currently a very good method because animation is about rhythm. So don't hesitate to sing your animation or to make noise with your mouth because you will input natural tempo that fits you, that is appealing to you. And when I was doing those stupid bouncing noise, I was almost into a perfect two time per second. So don't hesitate to record yourself or do whatever you need to be able to make the sound and measure the tempo of it. So this scientific method pushed me to set my animation loop to 12 frames. So I've set the error extreme on frame six. As we are doing a cycle, our character will move forward at a constant speed. So to help us figuring the position of the root bone, I can select all its key frame, press T and switch them to linear. This is not something mandatory. If you prefer to go ahead and move the root bone by eye and figure out the spacing, that's perfectly fine, but it will help us figuring the foot position on this first breakdown that I will set on frame one and it will be the pushing pose. Going back and forth I'm trying to match the position of the back feet on frame zero and frame one. But again, don't worry if it's not perfect, because when we will be polishing the curve, there are methods to make it match. Here, the important thing is to focus on the silhouette of your character and the goal of this position. So I'm currently adjusting the edge rotation, but before I was adjusting the main torso controller. The idea is to make these torso controller pointing toward the target, the target being the highest point in the air. So most of the power of the jump is due to the pushing of the back legs. So the front legs will be dragging toward the initial point, the point where they come from. And they will drag or point toward this position, both in their location and rotation, that's why I'm rotating the hands backwards. I will try to shape a bit the tail, but again, I won't put that much in the energy into it right now. I will mainly work on the tail during the polishing stage. I will also try to break a bit the position of the back feet by rotating one of them a little bit. Again, the idea is to break the twinning. One of the foot is leaving the ground slightly after the other. So there will be a bit of back and forth with the back legs. Because even if I want to avoid twinning, I need to keep them tight timing wise because they are influencing the bounce. They are giving power. Now I'm comparing my new pose with the next one. And I see that I need to revise the orientation of the torso because my character was diving or pushing too much forward, not high enough. Then I will slightly lean the head forward because if you watch the reference, the head is pretty stable. So we will give it a bit of overlapping motion, but we will try to keep it stable, looking at its target point. While I've started stretching the hips, I keep the chest pretty squashed throughout the middle of the torso. And since the root interpolation is a bit annoying to me, I will switch back to constant interpolation. From there, I will scrub a lot into my animation. I will try to fix a bit the feet orientation, especially the front feet that need to be oriented a bit inward in the front view. So that's also a mistake to avoid when you are animating a character, especially cycles, you will tend to animate them from a side view because it's more natural for us to feel the motion this way. But don't forget to check your character from the front view, that's very important. You should turn around your character as often as possible. When animating a character, it's like sculpting, we are sculpting the pose. So you need to rotate around the model. When sculpting, you spend half of the time rotating around your character and watching how it behave. This is the same with animation. If you want to create good poses, you need to check them through every angles. At this stage, you can shape a bit the ears if you want, that's not a problem. It will help reading the silhouette of your character, but it's a secondary motion so you don't need to do it right now. It's a bit like the tail, this is something that will be easier to figure out when we are polishing the animation. So I'm still struggling a bit with the position of the back feet. I've kept one of them flat on the ground because I feel like it looks more grounded, which is the case, for sure. So (indistinct) let's jump into the next pose, the landing pose. To start to working on the landing pose, I will duplicate the last pose so that I have the position of the feet. This way I know where they will be landing. Then I will roughly give the orientation to the torso controller. So I will push it up and I will rotate it toward the landing point or toward where our character come from. Beware as I have made a little mistake that I will fix later on, but if you called avoid it, that will help. Don't forget to move the root bone a little backward. It will offset the whole character a bit backward, and then you can place the feet and the torso as you want. If you're like me and you forget to do it, don't worry, it's not a big deal. That won't be a pain to fix afterward. So the first thing I will do is to give the right orientation of the whole body. I will also pull it back so that I get a very stretched pose. The idea is that the front feet are just about to touch the ground. So our character is stretching between the target point and the previous position from where it comes from. As I did before, if I can't feel the pose, I will press Alt + R and Alt + G on the chest controller, for example, to cancel any rotation or move I did before. And I will just sculpt the pose of the character. As for the other poses, you have the reference on the target pose we want to match in the lower right corner. Since I don't have that much to comment on this part, I will see you at eight minute and 50 seconds. (serene music) One thing I've input into this pose and that we need to input into the other pose while polishing is this slight twist on the torso. So since the left front leg of the character is the first that will touch the ground, I slightly twist its chest toward this left hand. And a very common rule that we will see when we will work on humanoid character is that when the chest or the shoulders are twisting or leaning toward the point, the hips are twisting or leaning in the opposite direction, giving a nice curvature to your character's spine and balance. While working on the pose, I felt that the timing was a bit off because the change in pose between frame 11 and 12 was too dramatic. So I've offset the pose to the frame 10. This pose was the hardest to make right so far. So I'm going back and forth a lot, I'm modifying the position of the legs a lot, I want to avoid twinning. I'm reworking the torso orientation, a lot of different stuff. There are very little chance that you're able to match the perfect pose, which doesn't exist at the first time. So don't hesitate to come back on it, don't hesitate to even modify the previous poses. And since we are starting to feel the motion, it's a good moment to display the motion path of the torso controller. This give us a rough idea of the motion of the body and it makes me confident enough to shape a bit the tail. But don't worry, you don't need to do it right now. Again, we can do it during the polishing stage. Nothing special to comment during this stage, so I will leave you and see you at 11 minutes and 38 seconds. (serene music) As I told you a little early on, I forgotten to move the root bone. So I will move it backward in the position it should be. And then I just need to select the chest controller and all the foot controller and move them all together to fit my previous pose. Since all those controllers are child of the root, moving them together is like moving the root bone. And again, I will fight and fight refining this pose until I'm satisfied with it. And as soon as I am, I will add a last breakdown or in-between on frame 11 because we can figure the position of our character from frame to frame six. There will be specific error motion, but we can track the position of the feet, the position of the torso, and try to get a smooth motion. And this is a big strength of the graph editor and the fact that we are using a computer to do the animation. It's perfect to create a smooth interpolation between two poses. But since we have a big difference of pose between frame 10 and frame 12, you can't let the computer do the guesswork. We need to build this new breakdown or in-between ourself. So this time I won't do the same mistake of forgetting to move the root bone. And since it's supposed to have a linear interpolation, it's position between frame 10 and frame 11 should be right in the middle of those two poses. And there is a tool that we haven't used yet, because I didn't want you to use it and it's called the Breakdowner. You can select it with the tool panel and with any bone or group of bones selected, when you left click and drag, you will see a breakdown percentage appearing in the top left corner of your screen. It currently gives you the level of interpolation you are performing. So if I left click and drag or press Shift + E to activate it and set the interpolation value to 50%, I'm sure I will be right in the middle. You can constrain this tool to rotation, move and scale by pressing G-R-R-S. You can also concentrate it to specific axes, and there are two other tools under the Breakdowner's menu that we are going to see later on. With my root bone position, I can press I to insert a key frame for every controllers. From there, the first thing I will do is try to match the feet position so the feet are targeting the landing position. It's exactly the same workflow as before. Then I cancel the rotation and move on the torso controller and I rework the pose. So I did a bit of twist by pressing R, then Y twice to rotate on the local y-axis. And now I will push the root of the torso toward the ground. The right leg is the first to contact the ground as it is the first one to be raised when leaving the ground. So I can have the left arm slightly bent, and they wouldn't put a lot of squashing, both in the chest and hips, by moving them toward the ground. I also make sure that I rotate the foot so that the plant is facing the ground. It's like the food are dragging so the tip of the food will later than the base of the foot or the heel. That's also a form of follow through. If you animate a hand or a foot moving, you want the fingers of the toes to be dragging to have an overlapping motion. One important thing I've learned through my classes is that says is that you should track your motion as soon as possible. This is why I've calculated the motion path for the feet, so that they can see their trajectory and timing. And this will be the perfect tool to double-check ox. We will talk more in depth about the ox in the next video. I will also add a bit of squashing on the head by moving it a bit backward. And to counter this I will slightly rotate it up so that our character is watching towards its next step. I will also calculate the motion path of the head bone and while I'm posing it, I'm trying to create a smooth curve between the different position of the head. This is the arc of the head. So try your best here to get a smooth transition between the different poses. But if it's not perfect, again, don't worry, we will see that in-depth during the polishing stage and by reading the curve, it will be even easier. Once I'm done with that, I can check my animation. So we really start to have the feeling of the emotion, but the problem is that my character is jumping forward so I would like to see it looping. Just uncheck the route controller so that your character will be jumping and looping without moving forward. Now, as for the bouncing ball, since frame zero and frame 12 are the same I will just read the animation from frame zero to frame 11. It already looks very good. But one last thing I'd like to address is the squashing of the character on the very first frame. I think we can push the pose even more. So I will just push the test controller a bit backward, the hips a bit forward, and the root of the torso a bit lower, Since we are animating on once here, meaning that we are creating a key pose on each frame, there won't be any specific interpolation. This is why I use the motion path to make sure that I have a nice spacing. With this pose on frame 12 updated. I'd like to duplicate all the key frame on frame 12 and move them on frame zero. But I don't want to duplicate the root key frame. So I will lock the root, press Shift + D with all the key frames selected on frame 12 and moved them on frame zero. And that's it. You've just blocked your first character run cycle. It's not something easy so if you have failed, don't worry, just restart from the beginning. I'm here to give you the method, but it's only through practice that you will become a good animator. Don't stress out, watch the video again. And if you're ready, I'll see you in the next one to polish this animation.

## 03-11-Arcs

In this video, we will talk about another principle of animation. I haven't used the term before, but we have already used arcs in our animations when we have done our one single animation, and when we were tracking the motion of the ball, we did our best to create those beautiful curve in the motion, and those are arcs. And it does make sense, even for me, as an arc, in French, is a bow. But, I'm not sure it will help for this course. Let's go ahead. If you look around, most of the things that move move in arcs. They kind of have a rotation-based motion and you will barely meet situation where you want to animate straight lines like hydraulics or stuff like that. If I remove the arcs from our one single animation, you can see that we absolutely don't get the same results, the same feeling. It doesn't look natural at all. Let's have a look at a little more complex animation and let's point out few arcs in this animation. A common mistake for beginners is to forget to input an arc in the head rotation. But in most cases, it will bring a bit more personality if you do it this way. Next step, if I track the hand, you can clearly see there is a big arc on the left hand and the right hand. On this new head turn, look at how the arc support the feeling of fear of our character not understanding what happened and his back is pushing his head down between his shoulder while rotating. On the next move, too, arc is very important and well-defined. And whatever part of the character I am tracking, I will find those arcs, whether it's the motion of the pelvis, the motion of the hands, the motion of the head, the feet, whatever you want. So arcs are almost everywhere and it's very important to track them properly. That's why we really need to use the motion path tool of Blender as often as possible. To summarize, we have seen that most motion are done in arcs. You should avoid the straight interpolation unless it is intentional. You should use the motion path tool of Blender as often as possible. Track your arcs!

## 03-12-01-Polishing the run Cycle

Finally, the polishing stage of our run cycle or gem cycle animation, as you wish. With all of our keys selected, I will press T and switch to Bézier interpolation. This is what we call splining the animation, because we are just changing the curve from constant to spline. And I must say that from our blocking it already looks pretty cool. I will quickly clean up the ROOT bone. So I will select it and use the only selected option in the action editor. When doing a locomotion cycle it's better to have a constant speed. So I just need to keep the first and last key frame and switch them to linear interpolation. Linear interpolation means constant speed. And while we are polishing the animation we can enable or disable the ROOT motion to check the motion path of our character, while moving forward or in place. For the polishing stage, it can be interesting to use the properties I have created on the streak. You can access them selecting the property bone on top of the character. The hide properties are not supposed to be keyed. That's a mistake I have made. So I will just try click on it and choose to clear key frames. Hiding the legs and hiding the tail while we are polishing the torso, for example, will help a lot, because we won't be distracted by the legs motion nor the tail motion. And so we can approach the animation of the torso of our character as a bouncing ball. A very common rule in animation is that everything is a bouncing ball. That's why the bone simple exercise is so important. Whenever you are learning animation. Finally, as always it's very important to use the motion path as explained before I've added to my quick favorite so I can rapidly access them, pressing the Q key but you can also find it under the armature properties. Let's starts by polishing the torso controller or the root of the torso, if you will. I've hidden the tail but I advise you to also hide the legs because they are a bit distracting in the end. I've hidden them a little later on but it's better to hide them right at the beginning. I will first work on the Z location curve since it's the most influential curve in the motion of this controller, it's pretty straightforward because it does really looks like our bouncing ball curve. There are two main differences. I've slightly scaled the upper vector. So that my character is kind of floating when it's reached its highest point. So it brings a bit of style into my animation. And the second thing is that we have a slight easing on the contact frame because the legs of our character are absorbing the shock. So we don't have a broken vector on frame zero and frame 12. Remember that frame zero and frame 12 must be the same. So I will basically revise a bit the position of frame one and my key frame on frame six, when I'm editing the curve, especially this kind of broad curve. I often only press the cue key in the 3D view port to access my quick favorite. And I update the motion path. Don't forget to check the animation both with the ROOT enabled and disabled. Here the video is sped up twice but you have the curve in reference on the top right corner. And at this stage you should be able to polish the curve. Again as an art form, I can't teach you everything about animation because a lot of it is about feeling the motion. So you have to feel if you want to hold your character a little more in the air or make him jump a little higher, a little lower, that's about you. The thing I'm pretty convinced here is that the leg are really distracting. So don't forget to hide them right now. I'm now switching to the X rotation curve and the weird thing here is that we have our XYZ rotation but also W your rotation. And there is also this strange quaternion name. Don't worry about that for the time being we will be focusing on the X, Y, and Z rotation curve. We can kind of ignore the W quaternion rotation curve for the time being. And I will explain you Euler and quaternion rotation later in this course, the X rotation curve allows us to lean our character forward and backwards. We can see, we have an important change on the rotation or orientation of the torso of our character when it's contacting and leaving the ground. I've created a little plateau in the middle when our character is floating in the air the key on zero and 12 are identical and I've rotated the angles so that we have a continuous flow of the curve. When I'm editing this rotation curve, I'm thinking of how I want my character to behave. It's a very light animal with a lot of agility. So I want a very smooth motion. So I want to shape the body of my character so that it follows the flow of the jump. And I curve the body even more when the character is landing and pushing to jump again. When I got this feeling I fixed the first and last key frame aligning them using the individual origin. It allows you to rotate both key frame independently, and then I've created this little plateau. To have my character slightly flatter or horizontal while in the air. It will make it float a bit more. And here is the result after polishing the X rotation. The Y Location, motion of our character is barely noticeable because most of the forward and backward motion is generated by the ROOT bone. And I've used the Y location of the body control during the bulking only for very subtle adjustment of the pose. So I've zoomed on the curve because the value are very subtle. And what I will do is just to align the curve on frame zero and frame 12. This will remove any jitter during the cycle. We can enable later on the cycle modifier so that you will see the continuity of your curve, and it might be a little more intuitive to edit them to align them. I will apply the same process to the Y and Z rotation curve. They are here to slightly twist the torso of our character and slightly rotate it side to side. So they just communicate a bit, the fact that we haven't been using tweening when our character is landing meaning that his front legs don't land at the same time. So there will be a bit of twisting in the shoulders and in the torso because everything is connected on our character. And this is something super important when you are animating a character, remember that everything is connected. So if you move your hand, it will, at some point make your legs move. I know it's a bit extreme, but just keep this in mind so that you won't forget to kind of polish a bit everything or think about it whenever you are working on the extremity of your contractor. So what I will do for the Y and Z quaternion rotation, since those are very subtle motion, I will just create a subtle flow in the curve, making sure that when the curve is going from one extreme frame 12 to the other frame zero, it does flow properly. So I create a slight overshoot by pushing the key number two, a bit down. The idea's to get smoother changes in the curve instead of adding very brutal changes in the curve. So it's a bit the same with the Z curve. When I zoom on it, we can see that we have a peak at the end. I will smooth the curve down, rotate the very last key frame, duplicated it on frame one. Now my curve is diving between frame zero and one. So I will just push down a bit the key frame number one onto the front two to get a smoother curve on its whole shape. We haven't used scaling so those curves are perfectly flat. So the first pass of polishing is done for the body controller. Those curves will probably be adjusted when we have polished the chest, hips and head of our character.

## 03-12-02-Polishing the run Cycle - chest and hips

[Instructor] Let's continue polishing our run cycle, working on the hips, chest and head. Before I work on those curve, I like to be able to see the cycle repeating over time. To do so, in the graph editor, we will display all the curve using the see all filter. Then we can press A to select all the curve and press Shift + E and choose Make Cycle. This will add the cycle curve modifier on all our curves and the animation will repeat infinitely. This is something we have already done on our bouncing ball exercise. Now I don't want to do so for the root bone. So I will activate the show selected only filter so that it only displays my root bone curves whenever I select. I zoom on the curve, pressing the dot key and then press Shift + E, linear extrapolation. This way, I will have a continuous move forward off our character but it doesn't seem to work and this is because we have also a cyclic modifier on those curves. So we'll press Shift + E again and clear cyclic modifier. So now all my curve are cycling but the root bone curve that has linear extrapolation and if I now increase the frame value of my animation end, I will see my character bouncing and bouncing and going forward. This is just a little trick that will show us the animation moving forward as it should be. It will just give you a better feeling whenever you are reviewing your animation. So let's reset the N key to frame 11 and let's start polishing the chest control. As usual, I prefer to start with the most influential curve. This is going to be the x rotation curve that makes our character learning forward and backward. So this is something I've already said before and that I will repeat a lot during the course I believe is that it's better to work first on the biggest changes in your animation, so work on the curves that will influence the most the motion and then go ahead with the details. It's like any piece of art. You always start by blocking the main shapes when you are sculpting, for example, and then you go deeper and deeper into the details. But if the main shape or main motion for our animation doesn't work properly, then the whole animation, no matter how much detail you are inputting into it won't be working properly. I tried to keep the chest aligned with the motion of the whole body but I input a bit of anticipation or dragging before the character is landing, raising a bit the curve will currently raise a bit the chest just before he lands. And then when he's diving into the next jump, I try to curl the chest towards the next point. So when he's about to land, he's leaning backward to anticipate the impact and when he's pushing to the next jump, he's curving his body towards the target, the point in the air. The y curve is the twisting curve. It's super subtle. As we have seen before, I have just input a bit of twisting in the chest so it depends on the position of the legs, so I will redisplay the legs. To be honest, what I will mainly do here is try to match the pose by twisting a bit toward the leg that is the more forward and then I clean the curve to have a smooth transition between the different keyframes. What I mean here is that I don't want to have any glitches on this y curve or on this y rotation motion. This is why I pulled up the keyframe number one so that it better blend with the previous key. And I do the same with frame number 10 by pulling it down a bit. I will do the same with the z rotation and once I'm done, we will work a bit on the location. So the idea is to use the z and y location of this controller to add a bit of squashing and stretching to the torso. I will be working on those location curve at 5:07. (tranquil music) As usual, I will start to polish my animation from a side view. The first thing I will do is to move the curve a bit trend only to see how my character behaves. Because the chest controller is the child of the body and we have see in the parent-child relationship video that the child will inherit the orientation of its parent and so the y-axis of our character might not be aligned with world space. And this is clearly not the case, but what I've spotted is that the y-axis allows me to stretch the character along its spine and the z curve allows me to shift it a bit up and down. So I will be mainly working on the y curve and the idea is to stretch our character as much as possible when he's jumping and squash it as much as possible when he's impacting the ground, when he's absorbing his own weight. Don't be too shy and push those curve. It doesn't matter if it's a bit too much but it will look boring if it's not enough. With the experience, you will learn to balance those poses. And we will have a full chapter about pushing the pose. What I do with the z curve is just creating a bit of balance of my character. The z location curve support the x rotation curve. That makes the character leaning forward and backward. I keep this motion subtle because the character is light and he's agile. So there is not that much inertia in his chest. If it was a very heavy characters and pretty sloppy, we would have a lot of motion in the chest. Once I'm happy with my chest motion, I will start working on the hips. So as before, I will start with the x rotation. Again, I want to use squash and stretch. That's for sure. But I also want to communicate the agility of the character. So on the jumping stage, I will push the hips up. The hips are catapulting the character upward. Think of a horse kicking backward. The hips motion is something really hard to get right, especially on animals or humanoid character and if you have already watched tutorials about animation, you know that a lot of animation is led by the hips. So it's important to do your best to make it look right. And if it doesn't, just look at some reference and rework your animation. Don't be afraid to fail, don't be afraid to restart your animation. At the end of the motion, when the character is about to land, look how I've bent the hips forward in an anticipation to the landing contact. This is something we can clearly see on our reference if you follow the curvature of the body. It's straight during the pushing and when it's about to land, before the back legs touch the ground and since we are creating a more extreme motion, we have to make this pose contrast more extreme too. This is exactly the kind of thing you have to look for when you watch your reference. We will go deeper into this later in the course. As I did for the chest, I'm working on the twisting of the hips, the latest, because it's the most subtle rotation in the body. And then I will work on the location curve of the hips. It will be very close to what I have done with the chest, working with squash and stretch, stretching the character when it's jumping and when it's in the air and squashing it when it's absorbing the landing. So I will see you at the timestamp 11 minute and 12 second to polish the head. (tranquil music) Time to polish the head and guess what? We will start with the x rotation. Since the head is the extremity of the torso, it will have a bit more overlapping motion, dragging, et cetera because it's influenced by the rotation of the body and the rotation of the chest. So we have to input a bit this dragging motion, meaning that when the body is leaning forward, the head is leaning a bit upward. The tip of the nose is dragging but we can't go crazy with this end motion as we will do maybe with the tail. When you are in locomotion, whether it's running or walking, your head is rotating a bit, it's dragging a bit but you're trying to stabilize its position, especially its x-axis rotation. This way, you can stare forward and see where you are going. So we have to input a bit of dragging but try to keep also the head stable enough. Don't go crazy with it. When I'm looking at the loop, I feel there is a little glitch when my character is reaching its highest point. It's pretty subtle and it might be difficult to see it in the video but when I'm animating, I can clearly see it. When you get this kind of issue but you can't really get what's wrong with your animation, use the motion path. But use it on the point further away from the rotating joint. In this case, I will use the tip of the nose controller. It should draw a smooth arc as seen in the previous lessons. But here, it's not the case. On frame five, the nose is going down. Then on frame six, going up. While on frame four, it was going up too. And it generates some kind of popping in the animation that doesn't look right. So what I'm doing now is slightly polishing the curve so that I get a nice arc of the tip of the nose. We don't need to create a perfect elliptic arc but we do need to have a smooth transition between the different keyframes. So I'm really refining the curve, even adding a keyframe on each frame until I get a nice arc. I will then work on the other rotation curve and finally, on the location curve. So here what you have to focus on. The head is the part that will be moving the most because it's at the extremity of the body but we do need to try to keep it as stable as possible, making our character staring forward. When you will input a bit of squash and stretch, do it with a bit of delay compared to the chest. If the chest is fully squashing on frame one, for example, the head will be fully squashing on frame two. One frame of delay will be enough. Do it and keep it subtle and once you have finished polishing the location curve, recalculate the motion path. And check if the tip of the nose is making a good arc. And you will see at the end of the video, I will recalculate my motion path and make sure that the nose is doing this great arc. And I will get a nice controlled head movement. I will leave you there for this video. At the end of the video is a time lapse where I'm fixing the head rotation and the location as I've just explained. In the next video, we will start working on the legs and it will drastically change our animation and make it. (tranquil music)

## 03-12-03-Polishing the run Cycle - Legs

[Instructor] In this video, we are going to polish the legs of the character. It's pretty important because it will help defining the silhouette of our character. It will also communicate its weight and agility. Here you can see the final result of the whole character polished. Try to use the file provided as a reference. Since they are the biggest, I will start with the back legs of the character. Since we are using inverse kinematic mechanism for those leg, the location are the most influential transform channel for the animation of the legs. This is the first channel we are going to edit. Now the legs of our character are dragging a lot toward the ground, making them looks very heavy, and like our character has a hard time raising them. So we will need to rework the leg position while in the air. But we do need to keep a bit of delay on the leg motion since they are dragged by the body. And the first thing I will do is to offset by one frame all the keys on frame six, putting a bit of delay on the air extreme pose of the leg. From the side view, I will be working on the z location and y location curve of the leg. So I will hide all the other channel and focus on those curves. And while I'm polishing the motion of the foot, I'm watching every single frame. The further you get from the center of mass of your character, the biggest will be the arcs. So when you are animating legs or hands on a character, it's very important to track what you are doing and to polish it as much as possible 'cause a sudden gap in your curve will make the motion of those parts very broad or very large. You will get a big glitch into the arc. Another thing to remember is that a falling object will accelerate before it hits the ground. So make sure that your spacing is the biggest before hitting the ground and when leaving the ground. And you can convert the contacting frame with the ground to vector. It's the best way to avoid easing in the first step. Finally, to have a better readability of the first leg, what I will do is go in front view and press Alt + B and frame off of the character. It will enable the view clipping mode. It's like creating a tunnel and whatever is outside of this tunnel won't be shown in the 3D viewport. It's support handy to cut the visibility of your character in half. While it's very useful in modeling for sure, that's also very useful in animation. Just press Alt + B again to clear the clipping view. I'll advise you to calculate the motion path of the foot as soon as possible. You can see that I have a very decent arc right away but I will polish it using the motion path. The main thing I will focus on here is to make sure that the character is pulling his leg as high as possible when jumping. So it will drag in the beginning and then it will catch up and even get very close to its belly. So as my arcs looks very smooth and as I'm pretty satisfied with the motion of the leg, I will switch to the front view to work on the x location curve of the leg. Here the method is pretty simple. You want to avoid zigzagging motion. And when the foot is stuck on the ground, you may not have any left and right motion. So polishing the x curve is pretty straightforward. We apply the same rule as when we are working on the under curve. Whenever the leg is contacting the ground, I will switch the handle type to vector. The next channel that inputs the most motion into the foot then will be the x rotation. So this is the next curve I will be working on. While I was pretty satisfied on the arc of the leg here, I've made quite a big mistake. I've worked the foot animation only without root motion and that's a mistake. I advise you to check your animation with and without root motion as often as possible because in the end, what you will be animating or seeing into your animation will be your character moving with the root motion. It will be moving forward, not moving on place like that. And while the arc of the leg looks cool without root motion, when I've enabled the root motion, it didn't look that great. It's not going to be a major issue on the animation here but I will have to fix it later on. So that's an issue. And you will save time if you switch to root motion as soon as possible. Back to our foot x rotation. The main focus is to get a smooth transition while in the air and to get a pretty fast flopping motion when leaving the ground. The foot is pushing the body forward. This is why we have a pretty big change between frame two and frame four and I'm polishing the curve between frame one and frame two so that the foot doesn't clip with the ground, which is represented by the y-axis here. One of my main concern was to choose whether I would input foot roll or not. And I've decided to go ahead with it. That's why our character is landing on the ball of the foot and then it switches to a flat foot position. You can think of it as a foot roll from the heel to the toes but on digit grad, like cat, dogs or squirrel, the heel is currently not touching the ground. So I'm not here to give you an anatomic course but it's important to take this into consideration because you will intuitively translate human motion onto animal motion. While it can work or be a stylized choice, it's important again to watch reference of animal and understand the behavior of the different part of their body, depending on their function or purpose. Here I'm polishing the x and y rotation of the foot. The idea is to make the foot point a little inward when it's leaving the ground and point a little outward when it's going to contact the ground. One last thing, on the contact frame, I want the foot to contact with the ground slightly with its outer edge. This is a very subtle motion you will find in the foot motion of a human being during a walk cycle. The foot has a slight tilt from left to right, while pushing on the ground. So even if it's very subtle, it's better to input this information in the foot motion of our squirrel character. When I got onto polishing the other back leg, finally made the clearer move to check my animation with the root motion on as I told you in the beginning of this video. And this is where I spotted the weird curvature of my arc for the left leg. You can see some kind of vertical easing on the motion path. We had to get back onto the polishing of the left leg. Fix this issue. And that's perfectly normal that you have to refine every single controller each time you are polishing one of them. As I told before, since everything is connected, fixing a bug somewhere or a bad motion somewhere may modify the perception you have of the other part and you will have to polish it again. As every art form, an animation is never finished. It's up to you and your schedule to call it done. The second important point is to watch the silhouette of your character. I don't think there is a shortcut in Blender to do so but you can go to the shading option, switch to flat and then object. This way, your character will turn into a single solid color that will help reading its silhouette. The idea is to avoid some part of the body to overlap and make the silhouette harder to understand. For example, here if I overlay both feet, one one top of each other, the silhouette is harder to understand. While if I separate them, I can see there are two feet. So this is not something you will be able to manage all the time because sometimes, the point of view makes your body part overlapping but just keep it in mind. That's also why the position of the heel is slightly offset so that we can see both heels tip. On the final polishing stage, I have tweaked the position of the pull target to make sure that the legs were not pointing outward too much. This is not really about polishing any motion here. It's mostly about fixing bugs from the inverse kinematic. But I'm moving the controller in space whenever I feel the need, then playing with its curve. So I will lead you there with a little time lapse where I will be polishing both back legs and I'll see you a little later in this video to polish the front legs. (tranquil music) For the front leg, I didn't make the same mistake as for the back leg and mainly worked with root motion. The process is basically the same as for the back leg, so I will just give you the two key points that you have to figure out for this motion. The front legs are the first to get in contact with the ground when your character is landing. While it's important to make them drag in the beginning of the jump, when the character is then losing altitude, it's important to show that the squirrel is in control. So you may not swing the arms all the way around. Since we want to show that our character is in control of its run cycle, then he will aim at the target point he will land on with his arms. If we look at this reference where the character is shaking his arms and legs all the way around, we clearly understand that he's not in control of the situation. Again, you have ask yourself how to move the legs but also why you will move them in a certain way. Again, animation is like any other art form. If you want to make it believable, it has to make sense. From the timing, the behavior of our character is mainly based on its weight, its agility, et cetera but as we go along in this course, we will try to ask also ourself how does my character feel? And how can we translate those emotion through motion, through animation? So keep this in mind whenever you are animating something. The other thing here I want to avoid is to have the legs or front arm over extending. This current rig is stretchable but it doesn't look that good on this character. And also, even if the animation is a bit stylized, I'd like to keep it on the realistic side of things. I advise you to try to keep this animation grounded, at least for this chapter because later on, when we will be working on humanoid character, we will push the style a little further. Realistic animation is a very hard exercise because it's about very subtle motion. Here I have a couple of frame where the character has his front foot contacting with the ground. I've placed the 3D cursor as a guide by Shift + right clicking and tweaking the y location curve, I will make sure that the foot is on the same position on both contacting frame. Then I will duplicate the last frame on the first one so that both the first and last frame of the cycle are the same as usual. So here you have the key component to polish the front legs. Avoid overextending limb, avoid unnecessary and goofy motion of the limbs, aim at the landing point. Make sure that the feet stays in place whenever there are contacting with the ground and don't forget to check the silhouette whenever you are working on both front legs. I will leave you there with a little time lapse of me finishing this polish and I'll see you in the next video where we are going to polish the tail of our character. (tranquil music)

## 03-12-04-Polishing the run Cycle - tail

[Narrator] The tail motion is almost exclusively follow through. It is supporting the ax made by the body of the character when it's jumping and moving forward. On such a character, the tail is used to balance the motion. As explained in the previous video, if I want to show that my character is balanced and agile, I won't make the tail wobbling around. But I'd rather try to make it having a smooth movement. So as usual, I'm starting with the X rotation because it's the most influential transform channel on the motion of the tail. As the tail is using forward kinematic mechanism, it's better to start polishing the base of the tail or the root of the tail, and then go along until the tip of the tail. So I've been mainly smoothing the rotation curve, and we have a bigger gap whenever our character is hitting the ground. Protect pose occur on frame 11, and the rotation of the tail is offset by one or two frames. During the blocking, I've also input a slight location change in the tail to support the shape and the silhouette of the character. I'm just editing a bit the curve so that it transitions mostly from one key to the other. So I'm mostly doing this to avoid any glitches in the animation. The Z rotation curve allow us to swing the tail from left to right. And this is typically the kind of motion that will translate the lack of balance from your character. If you're walking on a thin line and you try to keep your balance, you will spread your arms on each side. So that you could use them as a counter weight. And the more your body will move left to right when you are moving forward, the more you will translate this lack of balance. When put a very subtle left to right motion just to support the line of the body. This will support the line of action, and the realism of our character. We will have a more in depth discussion about the line of action later on in this course. But you should understand that this slight tilt brings some kind of randomness or make the character a little more uneven and make it this way more realistic. Don't forget on your cycle to make sure that the first and last key frame are the same and that their vector are aligned with the curve to get a smooth transition. Now we can jump onto the second controller. And what I will do is that I will re input the root motion to my character and calculate the motion pass to see how it goes. I don't want to repeat the mistakes I've made in the previous video where I've checked the motion of my character with the root motion on a bit too late, and I had to fix a lot of things. As for the root of the tail around the impact frame, we will have some kind of big change in the curve. And then it will be mostly smoothing out the shape of the tail so that it follow the flow of the body or the motion of the body in space. Think of it as a train or as a ribbon. As the root of the ribbon is throwing shape in the air, the rest of it is following in the same motion. The same flow, the same arc, the same path. This way you are really supporting the motion of your character in space. And it give more freedity, more smoothness to the jumping motion. This kind of fall through animation is pretty easy to set up on such a cycle animation, and on such a smooth animation. But it's kind of more complicated as soon as you get a more snappy animation or a lot of big variation into the motion. On same note with this joint, I will jump on the last one. So this is all I have for this video, and I will see you in the next one. (soft music)

## 03-12-05-Polishing the run Cycle - ears and eyes

[Instructor] This is the last video of the run cycle for our squirrel character, and it's currently the shortest. I will just be slightly reworking the heels because we need to animate them. They are important even if they won't show that much they appear so so we need to give them some love. I'm doing it in two step. I'm mostly posing the heels directly in the 3D view port. I'm not really considering the curves, I just want a very slight shaking or wabble just after the impact frame. This is why I have a big change between frame zero and frame two. And then I'm just dragging them a bit while our character is moving forward. I will just have a quick cleanup on the curve to make sure that I don't get any jittering motion, just something smooth But with pretty critical change in the beginning. The second thing to consider is the silhouette of our character. As we did for the legs I will try it from a side view as much as possible to separate the heels. This way I'm breaking the tangent in the shape of their heels. And we can clearly see that there are two peaks on the head of our character. So that they will make sure that frame 12 and frame one are the same and then I will have a quick polishing pass onto those curves. I'm just revising a bit the flow of the curve, I'm not even really focusing on what's happening in the freely huge. Is just to add the smooth motion avoid any jitter or stuff like that. This is not a critical step and I could have left the curve as they were. As usual it's a matter of time and energy you want to spend onto an animation. The last thing I will do is to animate the eyes. So I won't make the eyes blinking and you should avoid that on the cycle because since the cycle is very shot your character eyes will blinking a lot and it will really looks weird than CG. What I've done here is just to slightly lower the eye controller on impact. It's super subtle, but it's just about having the whole body connected. So when the body is impacting the ground even the eyes or the eyebrow are reacting. It might not show that much in the end but you can definitely tell yourself now that you've been working this animation from a to Z. Though you are happy with the result or not, proud of it and do another animation and this is all you will get, good finish animation and start another one.

## 03-13-Squirrel idle - Blocking

In this video, we will start blocking a new animation. This is going to be an idle animation of the squirrel. But we need our character to transition from the run cycle into a stop, do the idle, and then get back into the run cycle. At least to make our character checking the surrounding environment. And then as it hears some noise maybe it will go back into the run cycle to flee the danger. It is going to be a very fun idle to animate and the first step is always to check out references. Looking for some specific information. First one is the rhythm of the character. You can see how we jumped from a pose to another in a very fast motion and sometimes just stop. And then it almost stay still. Those various snappy motion really brings the fact that our character is lightweight. Squirrels use their tails also to communicate their feelings and to communicate between them. So we can use the tail to communicate surprise or fear, to our character. The last thing that really shines through those reference is the briefing pattern of the character. It is really fast paced and he does show a lot when the character is not moving that much. We'll be blocking five poses. The first one where our characters stop and look at the side. Then it will raise on its back leg and maybe smell the air. We will then pull his attention to the other side. Then he will turn his head in a more grounding pose because he heard something, transition into a pose where he will start running to flee the danger. Since we are going to transition from the run cycle the first thing I will do is clean the run cycle. So I will select older curve and press the Shift+E and clear the cyclic modifier. Then I will select the root bone and I will press Shift+E and get clear of the linear extrapolation by choosing constant extrapolation. Make sure you have all your keys selected when removing your modifiers or your character will be kind of behaving weirdly. At least it looks pretty fun but it will be hard to work with that. So once I'm done, I will duplicate my run cycle. So that I have a new action to work with that I will call idle. And I will keep the run cycle animation at the beginning of this new animation. This will help us creating the transition between the idle animation and the run cycle. We'll have to animate our character transitioning from the run cycle to the idle. But as we did for any of our animation so far, I will go on frame 15 and I will stop blocking the first pose of our idle. The first thing I do is to flatten the feet of the character because they're on the ground and since you will have some kind of still pose we need him to be grounded. And to make our life a little easier I will keep the back feet on the ground. In the same position they had when he land at the end of the run cycle. You can do the pose you want, but, I believe it will be better for you to follow what I'm doing so that you won't be lost if you're not use to animate that much. As I block the character pose I will give you the key component I'm looking for when doing so. I don't want my character to stay on his four leg in the straight pose. If you raise the one of your leg you will automatically shift your weight towards the other one. This way you will keep balance. And we can clearly see that on the reference poses. Our character has turned to its right side. His whole chest is slightly shifting to be right under his front leg. This way his center of mass is aligned with the front leg is aligned with these contact points. If we were to see our character from beneath, we can see that the three contact points the three legs contacting the ground are shaping a triangle. And the center of mass of our character is more or less centered with this triangle. This way our characters looks balanced. And this is a very important thing when you are doing these kind of idle poses. Since there is no more inertia like motion forward as in the run cycle, you need to make your character look in balance on each pose. The other very important thing to do is to twist the character to while the contact point. Looking at the reference again we can see that the shoulder are pointing down towards the contact point. And as in most cases you want to create an opposite twist with the hips. The cool trick to remember is to create a V shape, with the line of the shoulder and the line of the hips. We then try to give a nice curved shape to the tail. And when I feel like the pose is looking all right, I will use the tweak controllers to fix the shape of the front leg. On the current pose, the front leg contacting the ground is bending forward and it looks a bit weird. So I'm using this tweaker controller to fix it. Checking the rotation first and then just moving the joint a bit backward. As we did before, during this blocking stage I'm absolutely not considering the timing of the animation. I'm just setting the key poses or golden poses every five frame. I've seen people setting those key poses, every one frame and then moving them when they knew their first timing path. For the next two poses, I want my character to kind of relax and sit. On the first pose our character is transitioning from the previous pose watching to his right. And then I want him to watch to his left so that we have a cool rotation and the change in the pose. So, as usual, try to avoid the twinning in your poses. Think of the silhouette of your character. Does it read well? And think of the balance of your character and his emotional state. Is he relaxed, curious, in danger, stressed? As I'm building the very first sitting pose, I will kind of squash a bit the character backward. So I'm watching references from the video I've linked in the documentation, to check the curvature of the body of the character, for example. So I'm using both rotation and location of the different controller. Don't hesitate to move the controllers. A lot of people, especially beginners, tend to use only rotation, especially for the spine bone or the arm bone when using forward kinematic. And a lot of rig doesn't allow to move the joint, using the location channels. While this behavior can be physically correct because you can't really move your bone you can only rotate them, animation wise it's not necessarily relevant. Because unless you have a rig that perfectly simulate the physical behavior of your character, with the bones, the fat and everything, you may not get an interesting shape or a believable shape of the body of your character by only rotating the controllers. Especially with this kind of fluffy character. Because you're not currently animating it's skeleton you're animating everything from the skeleton, the muscles and the bones and the fur. So as usual, think of the shape of your character, think of its silhouette, and think of what you want to communicate. Here, I want him to be chilling on its back leg. So I'm compressing him a bit. A reminder, don't forget to set your keys to constant interpolation, and don't forget to key your whole character to avoid foot sliding and all this kind of shenanigans. For the third pose, I want my character to be kind of curious to what's happening in his environment. So I will turn him the other side so that we have contrast between the previous pose and the current one. One of the key component of this next pose is curiosity. I want the character to be smelling the air around him, as if something was catching his attention. This is why I will give to his body a more extended pose. He's pulling his head apart to smell the air. His body is kind of stretched or pulled by his curiosity. And since the pose is slightly bending forward, I've laid the tail backward so that the character is balanced. There is more weight of his head forward and the tail is counterbalancing the weight of the head backward. From my experience an unbalanced pose doesn't look right at all. So, before being appealing, I feel like a pose must be balanced. Like, we can feel that the character is well grounded and it won't be falling down. So when creating your pose, think first of the goal of your character, the purpose of the pose, his feeling. Then, think of the appeal of the pose, the silhouette, et cetera. And for any still pose or pose with very slight motion where there is not that much inertia, always think to balance your character. As I'm getting close to the pose I want, I can't think to fix the secondary shape like the elbow orientation, the knee orientation and all this kind of stuff. From there I've made a personal choice. I'm not sure that squirrel can really rotate their ears. Watching the reference, it seems that there is a slight rotation of the ears. And watching other video I can see a bit of rotation, but I'm not sure how much they can rotate their ears. But the ears are a fantastic feature to communicate emotion, to communicate curiosity. Think of the motion of a cat's ears when they've heard a noise their ear rotates almost 180 degrees. They can show also fear, aggressivity, et cetera. So I'm perfectly fine if this motion is wrong because I'm not here to reproduce a realistic motion. I'm here to give life to this character through emotions. I feel like, the pose look believable enough. Here I'm starting to work on the next pose and at first I also made a pose where the character was staying on his back legs. But it was way too similar to the current pose, so in the end, I've modified this pose. I wanted the character to feel surprised by some kind of noise or whatever, and scared at the same time. We will jump directly to the next pose and then we will see how I reworked the current one. Since the next pose is the last one before our character run again, I have duplicated all the key frame of the run cycle and them onto frame 35. I will also duplicate the last route motion key and put it on the first one of the second cycle. This way I don't get root motion on the second cycle. We will get rid of the root motion in the end, but it's important to have it, for the transition between the run cycle and the first pose of the idle. Here, I'm creating the anticipation pose. The next video will be a more in depth explanation of anticipation, but basically it's the moment where the character is compressing himself to gather energy before jumping forward into the run cycle. So I flatten the foot on the ground so that he's very stable. I'm pushing the chest backward and the hips forward to compress the torso as much as possible. And I'm also pushing the head inward. It's like squashing a spring before releasing to make it jump. I'm shaping the tail into a knock because I know that when he will be jumping he will whip the tail downward. So I'm kind of shaping the body the opposite way it will react on the next pose. I'm compressing it a lot while it will be stretched When the character is jumping. As explained before I'm revising the previous pose before the anticipation because I wasn't happy with him staying on his back legs while I wanted him to be kind of scared by some noise, or something, just before he decide to run away. So I want the squirrel to be well-grounded on his four legs. Slightly closer to the ground ready to jump and with the ears, head and torso pointing toward the noise. The tail is counterbalancing the pose creating a nice curve of the whole body. Again, I'm making sure that the character is well-balanced that's why I moving the right front leg a bit on the side. As explained before, as any art form don't hesitate to try to improve your animation. Revise them, change your mind, et cetera. If you are not convinced about what you are doing, then change it. If you don't feel like you're communicating anything, change it. If it's boring, change it. But if you can't figure why, don't hesitate to ask anybody around you. One of the cool thing about animation is that most of the people connect with animation. And while your mother might not be able to tell you what you have to do to improve your animation, she might point out things that looks weird to her. Or what she doesn't like about your animation. And then you can make the choice to modify it, or it can put you on the way to improve the animation. And if you know any professional animator that can give you feedback, don't hesitate. Or put your animation on forums, that's very important.

## 03-14-Anticipation

[Narrator] Anticipation is a very common rule or principle of animation. If we have a look to the throw animation, the current pose will be the key pose. A moment where the character is releasing whatever he is throwing. In the previous video, we've seen that anticipation was a motion built to gather energy to prepare for the next motion. On these pose we can clearly read the anticipation. The whole body of the character is leaning backward with his arm extended backward before he swings forward. Anticipation of two proposes, the first one is gathering energy or preparing for the next motion, but it's also a matter of readability and strength in the motion. This example I've removed the anticipation, the character is switching from idle directly to withdraw motion. And compared to the animation with the anticipation it clearly looks less powerful and also less readable. So the anticipation as two proposes prepares the audience to what is coming and it adds strength to any motion. Anticipation is oftenly called antic and it can append any time in a motion. On this double a kick, the anticipation occur at this point. Character jumps from idle into this pose, raise whole body is quashed before the release. When we think of our bond symbol, whenever it's quashing when it hits the ground we could think of it as being some sort of anticipation. Anticipation can be used for any kind of motion. It's not necessarily connected to a strong movement. On this animation when the character is turning around to check what is stuck in his back he has a slight surprise move and there is a little anticipation in his head motion. His whole body and head goes down before going up to communicate surprise. When an anticipation is very fast we can call it a micro anticipation or micro antic. On this combo sequence there are multiple anticipation on the character. I'd like to focus on two of them, when she's moving forward to give the first punch she's slightly leaning and crouching this way she will have more power into her punch. So this certain anticipation fit the jab punch. When the character is about to dodge the mannequin falling she slightly raises her body on two frames before diving into this curvy motion. Those two frame where she's blinking with her eyes are the micro anticipation before she dodges the falling mannequin. To summarize we have seen that anticipation can be used to gather energy before any motion. It generally make the current animation look stronger. It improves the readability of the animation by preparing the audience to the next move. Anticipation can also be used to emphasize subtle motion. We can use very short anticipation called micro anticipation or micro antic.

## 03-15-01-Squirrel detail Blocking

It's time to detail our idol blocking and also give it a timing path. Character is entering the shot after a run cycle. Have a look around smell the air, held something and flee into a neuron cycle. The first thing I will do is to offset the second jump. So I will select the root bone and I will change the last key by increasing its value by minus 0.7 meter. This is the distance our character is traveling per bounce. Enter the stage the route is at zero, travel by minus 0.7 during the first jump then stop and stays at minus it will travel to minus 1.4 meters. From there I will be working on the first pose. So I will just give me some space, moving the key frame a bit forward in time. Whenever we build the breakdowns as we did during the cycle, we mean to address any specific changes or big changes between each key poses also called golden poses. So the run cycle our characters stops on three legs and is having a look around. I will create two breakdowns to absorb the impact of the landing and define the steps made by the front legs. It lands on both front leg and then I will make him switch from left leg to right leg. So there is a little shuffle. The most of use was to flatten the feet as our character is stopping the feet are well-grounded. As I want my character to raise one of the front leg to make a step leaning the character toward the foot in contact with the ground. If you remember in the previous video we were talking about balance. So whenever my character is raising one leg is shifting his weight toward the one in contact with the ground. So you need to input a bit of location offset in each controller and a bit of rotation in each controller. A bit of twisting too remember to use the body controller as the main controller while the hips and chest controller are here to shape our character. I oftenly reset the rotation and location of the chest and hips controller by pressing Alt+R and Alt+G. And then re-transform them when I'm creating a breakdown. When I'm happy with the pose I will slightly offset it on frame 15 and insert a key frame on every controller. Now I will refine a bit the pose by scrubbing back and forth onto the current pose and the previous one. I'm trying to figure this transition motion between the new pose and the landing pose. But I will make the tail drag a bit by rotating it a little down. And since the chest and head of our character are also weighted or heavy I will make them drag a bit too. So I will slightly push the head inward the bodys quash a bit and rotate it a bit downward. As the tip of the nose is dragging into the next pose. Don't hesitate to check out the provided file to have a better reference of the current pose. For the next breakdown I will select my key pose on frame 20 and duplicate it. To build a nice transition between frame 15 and 17. I will calculate the motion path of the body controller. I've already explained you before that arcs in animation are very important. This is why I'm using motion path is to see those arcs. Here we can see that the frame So I will push frame 17 up and frame 15 down. Make sure that you check your arcs as soon as possible. This is really something I wish I knew before. Because as soon as I've learned this technique and I've embraced it my animation quality and speed to produce it have leveled up very fast. So even if you're blocking will take a little more time it will be way more accurate and way more appealing. Hence the polishing stage will be way easier and way faster. Don't forget to check your arcs from every position, the top the side et cetera. As the body controller arcs looks quite right, just drag a bit the chest the head and the front leg between frame 15 and frame 20. On this frame 17 I'm creating and easing toward the frame 20. From there I will mainly be tweaking the poses on frame 15, 17 and 20, and 17 our breakdowns. So I'm double checking the arcs of the body controller from the top view, And then I will mostly be refining the tail of the character. I want to have quite of a contrast between the different poses. We watch the reference the squirrel has very snappy motion of the tail. And it wipes it quite a lot even if it's a subtle motion, each time it changes pose the tail has rapid wipe motion. That's why I'm trying to bring some contrast in the tail pose during the blocking. Those poses will give the rhythm to the idol. I will offset a big chunk of the animation. The next step I want the character to hold the pose for a second or so and then jump into the one. So here it's out to give you a tip of whatever to say, hey you have to input maybe 10, 15, I'm just playing the animation and thinking, okay will jump he will stop have a look around and then switch to a more relaxed pose. And you won't find any footage of this but I'm almost acting the scene I am figuring out that I am the squirrel I stopped, I'm curious about what's around me and then I relax and sit. So I figured that 10 frames was okay for the time being but holding the pose for So I will just build a new pose upon the frame 20 and frame 23 and bring some sort of variation especially in the tail I want to change the shape of the tail. Change a bit the orientation of the head stuff like that. I can imagine the character smelling the air for example. As usual when I feel like the pose is okay I will keep frame all the controllers to avoid foot sliding and stuff like that. From there we can transition into the next pose. The pose where our character is sitting on his back legs. We will first create an anticipation where our character is crouching, then we will have a transition pose where the head and the chest will be dragging while our character is moving backward to sit. So I've started by creating the crouching pose, the anticipation if you prefer, and I'm building it from the current pose. But since I'm still using the motion path for the body controller I know where the character body is going to be. So I'm just pushing him down to create a new arc. And as I build or pre-build this new pose, I can create the intermediate pose with ease. So this will be really a transition pose where I start to rotate the body and the chest, neck and head will drag behind. Just imagine that your character is being pulled by the hips. The danger here is to overdo the anticipation in a way. This is a pretty lightweight character. So the anticipation should be very settled. The heavier a character the more energy he will have to gather before moving into the next pose so the bigger will be the anticipation. So honestly while I'm recording this specific video I haven't started the polishing of this animation. It made this anticipation more subtle when I will switch to spline and start polishing this animation. Getting the right sense of weight is I believe the most complicated thing in animation. And also one of the most important thing if you want your animation to be believable. Even if it's stylized. So I'm pretty confident I will get a nice animation at least something appealing but nailing the motion of the squirrel even in a stylized animation this is not something I will promise but we will try our best for sure. We will now detail the turn animation. There are two very important things to look after, as usual the motion arcs and then the body transfer. The sitting pose our character will transition into the standing up pose. I will then add a couple of details by making the character raising even a bit more and smelling the air. As I'm transitioning between those two key poses, Look at the arcs drawn by the body and the nose of the character. I've exaggerated them a bit for the sake of this tutorial but I'm sure it will look pretty decent and way better than if I was doing a straight rotation between those two poses. The second very important thing here is the weight shifting. As the character is turning to his left, I'm also translating his body controller and I'm opening the left leg toward this new position. The wider the legs are opened, the more balanced will be our character. Last detail on this pose is the right end dropping down. When the character is raising into the left turn position he drops his right hand to counter balance the weight that has been shifting on the left side. And as he's rising he straighten his tail horizontally to get some better balance. To better understand what I'm showing you here, stand up and try to raise your nose as high as possible. You will intuitively and naturally push your hands towards the ground. You will pull every part of your body down to be able to raise as much as possible the tip of your nose. Your arm will be spreading and pointing downward in order to lower your center of gravity and be balanced. So the more you spread any body part closer to the ground, the lower is your center of gravity, the more balanced you are. For the transition into the last pose our character is hearing a node in his back. So his attention is dragged behind him. So beyond curiosity our character might be scared or feel in danger. So what I want to show you here is that the head is leading the animation. Parting from the previous pose, we can see that on the next pose, It's the head that has the broader motion. And beyond this head rotation the heels are also already pointing at the final destination. When doing a head turn you generally first rotate the eyes towards the target and then the head follow. If you have watched cats or dogs I'm sure you have already spotted how mobile their ears are. So in those breakdowns I want to show that the ears are currently leading the animation. I've created a second step where the character hear the noise again and the ears are pointing toward the noise and he rotates his head more precisely. And as he's getting scared I straighten the tail. Again think of it and act it when you are getting scared you instantly get straight as a stick. So from there there is no more doubt. Our character is scared so I will transition into the anticipation before the jump. Here the hips are pulling the characters back into the most squashed position as possible. The ears are still pointing back towards the source of the noise. To want to put in short pre-data on whatever, lets build last pose that is almost the same where the character is squashed a little more. Animation wise this pose will last maybe for one or two frame maximum before the character jumps forward. The last thing I've done to finish this blocking is to duplicate the keys where I want my character to hold the pose. So that when I will switch to spline, my character won't be moving because I will have two identical pose. So I wont have any interpolation between them. And he will hold the pose. Next video will be a time lapse where I build all the breakdowns we have been talking.

## 03-16-01-Polishing idle

[Instructor] It's time to finally start polishing our squirrel idle animation. It will be kind of similar as when we have been polishing the run cycle. We will start with the most influential controller of our character like the torso or the body controller, then polish the contact paws, the feet and then all secondary motion and follow through like the tail and the face. You can choose whether to polish fully each controller one by one but when I work on long sequences like that I prefer to work by chunk, like working on the first two paws and polish them and then go to the paws three and four and polish them, et cetera. I think it's a little more motivating when you do this by chunk because doing a long shot like that and polishing only one controller will show results only on the long-term and sometime it can be hard to stay motivated. But this is really a matter of personal choice so you can work the whole animation at once focusing first on the torso and then the legs, and then all the secondary motion or do as I will polishing each segment of the animation. (air whooshing) Just a big warning in here I selected all the key frame and switch them to busy. And this is a mistake since my root motion is supposed to use a linear interpolation. This is not a big deal, but it leads to some mistakes into my transition between the run cycle and the idle pose, so make sure you select your root controller and press T and switch it back to linear before going further. When I play the animation it doesn't look that bad when we switch to spline mode. And this is because we have detailed a lot our blocking. But there is definitely something weird happening about the head rotation. The head of our character is twisting or flipping the wrong way. This is a super classic bug whenever you switch to spline and we will see how to fix this. I will explain our rotation behavior in a more detailed video in the next chapter. So before we even start polishing class we'll go into the graph editor and we will fix it when you get this kind of bug, it's 100% because of the curves as we are using quaternion rotation for the neck and head, we have four rotation channels. And when I frame my curve pressing the dot key on the num pad, we can see this huge drop on the W channel. And basically what's happening is Blender using the shortest path to turn the head. So instead of rotating with the nose facing the front part of the character it's going back because the turn is short term this way and this is the common problem with quaternions. To fix this I didn't really fix the curve first and then try to match the previous pose. So I will simply push this W curve up so that it has a better continuity. And then I will slightly tweak the other curve so that the head is getting back to its original position. When you get this kind of curve dropped, you generally have a whole chunk of your animations that is slightly offsetting. So I will select the Z rotation curve and push it a little up. So I'm guessing it's the Z rotation curve because I have a huge drop on the Z rotation curve too. And I can see that between frame 72 and 95, the head was offset compared to what I have done before. So the trick here is to test each curve and see which one is bugging and then offset it. So that it's betterly aligned with the previous key frame of this curve. So I'm just tweaking the position of the curve. And I just focus on the pose of my character on the current key frames. I am fixing the pose. I'm not thinking about the animation, the interpolation of the curve or whatever. I'm just kind of reshaping the poses of my character. And so if you're happy with the current poses I have meaning that they are close to what I have during the blocking stage. I can move on and start polishing. (air whooshing) So this is something that is becoming very common into this course is that the first thing I do is work on the torso root of my character. Because as I've explained before, this is one of the controller that will add the most influence onto the character and to get a good visualization of the spacing and the arcs I've calculated the motion path. The first thing I'm working on is the follow through animation after the landing. This is why I've pushed my curve down in an overshoot just after the contact pose our character has a huge speed going down. So we need to absorb the impact and then it recovered and we have our Z location getting stabilized. So we have just created some kind of overshoot and now I will switch on to the Y curve and I will do exactly the same as our character is contacting the ground while we're moving forward he's absorbing the inertia. So I do create a slight overshoot here, so whatever the trend form channel you are using you will see this kind of shape in my curves very often. This is really the archetype shape of a curve for a follow through or an overshoot. So it doesn't apply for impacts where the curve will stop right on the contact pose. But as soon as you have a lot of verticality in a curve that means that the motion is very fast or very important. So as soon as it stop, you will have a bit of overshoot or follow through animation, meaning that there is a bit of inertia and you can apply it to scaling rotation and location. The more you will input and the longer there will be, the more weight and lack of control, you will get, the tighter and smaller those overshoots, the lighter or controlled the motion will look like. As the main body controller arc start to look decent, I can now switch to the rotation of this controller. I always apply the same rule. I start with the X rotation curve because it's the most influential into this motion. So I'm kind of tracking the head, when I'm rotating the whole body because this is what will give you the curvature of the whole body. And as I polish, the X rotation, which shows the most from a profile view, I also rework the Y location. So when I'm polishing my curve, it happened that I offset a lot of them. This way I'm retiming the animation. If I feel like the landing animation is too long, I can offset a bunch of key frame by one frame back and it will happen a little faster. In front view, I'm working on the Y rotation which is the twisting of my character. When he lands, I twist toward the left hand which is the first contacting the ground and where the character will put his weight and when he's raising on the right hand I'm twisting toward this point too. With the Z rotation curve, I'm creating the side-to-side rotation and what I will do here as I have a drastic change in the orientation of my character is input a very slight overshoot. So creating those overshoot, or follow through in the curve is not an automatism, but when you see this kind of shape in your curve, meaning that it's going down or high very fast and then it stopped creating a plateau. Just try to add a bit of an overshoot and see if it does fit your animation. Again, I can't tell you this is the way to go because animation, as any form of art, is about experimentation and what we work for this specific squirrel animation, won't work for all the squirrel animation you're going to be doing. This might not fit the type of style you are looking for into your animation whether it's super realistic or it's super stylized. But what I want to say here, is that it's a matter of experience. I'm giving you the foundation to create this kind of animation, and then you have to train your eyes by animating and animating again. But this is a cool tip you should keep in mind and when you get more experience you will know when you have to dial the intensity of your overshoot, get rid of them or add even more of them. On the specific pose I'm rotating the body controller and lowering it and also rotating the chest controller to avoid the right leg contacting the ground to be overextended. This is something you can also fix in the second time using the little tweaker controller the small sphere on the elbow of the character. Unless this is something you are looking for if you're doing on purpose having a stretch, lean on your character, very straight, will look stiffened, won't look that natural. So here I'm not saying that you can't have this leg fully stretch as I am here but I will not all the pose with the lean totally stretched. So I've done whatever I could to fix the shape of the arm. But if I can, then I'm totally fine using the tweaker bone pushing it back a little to have a slight bend in the arm. Even if in the end, it's a little longer than it should be, we won't see it and the silhouette will look better. (air whooshing) When polishing the head, the first thing I do is to track the nose. So here I have a controller for the nose, so that perfect. I will calculate the motion path onto it. As usual, I start with the X rotation because it's the most influential controller on this part of the character. And the idea here is to make the head dragging compared to the rest of the body. So since the head is further away from the center of gravity of our character, that is represented by the main body controller, it will kind of drag, it will be delayed in its motion but I want to make this subtle again. We are working on the very light character so I don't want its head to wobble all the way around. It will drag, but just a touch. The overshoot must be as short as possible. If we were animating a baby, for example, it would lack of control in its head. So that will be a great moment to make it drag a lot more, build stronger overshoot, and even made the head wobble. But this is not the case for our character is currently very agile. And I want to show that he's controlling his landing and his head is more driven by curiosity than its own weight. As soon as the rotation are fixed and I've done it also on the chest controller previously, I work on the location curve of the head. The idea is to squash the head inside the body whenever he is raising very fast. And then when he get curious or when he hit its final poses, I push the head forward. One very important thing is that squash and stretch is not only about scaling something or really squashing it. It can be represented by the distance between two controllers in this case, the head getting more into the body but the head doesn't get squashed. The neck does get squashed a bit but we currently don't really see a deformation but the silhouette of our character overall get shortened. So it gets squashed a bit. So here you can see that I'm playing in the plane and throbbing through my timeline, playing with the Y and Z location curve, just to get this slight head bop when it comes to its extreme pose, creating the slight shake of the head using the location instead of the rotation, as we explained before, won't translate a lack of control because our character eyes are stable. He's looking at a point in space. While if we were doing this overshoot with the rotation the eye will be kind of jiggling in the space, in the screen space, on what we are seeing in our animation. And it will then look like our character is controlling what he's doing. As I'm getting close to having the head polished, look at how I slightly move this point on the curve. So I don't want to get a perfect plateau of the curve. I want to keep very subtle movement that we call moving holds. (air whooshing) As I'm pretty happy with my head motion, I will now be working on the nose of the character. The idea here is to create a secondary motion. So the nose will simply be dragging a bit while our character is raising the head. If we watch the motion path from frame 14 to frame 17 we can see that we have a lot spacing meaning that the head is moving fast. So this is where the nose of our character will be dragging the most. And it does show onto the curve here. So I'm not using the graphing tool to control the nose. I am moving it directly into space. And then I may use the graph editor just to slightly polish the position of the nose. On frame 19, I've created a little bump in the curve so that we have some kind of bouncing motion of the nose as our character reaches its highest point with the head all those little element give texture to our animation, small details and I will be doing the same with the eyes. I won't be animating the night blink but then we'll very slightly close the eyes, our character is raising his head. All of these little details are like squash and stretch. They are supporting the animation. So I haven't been using the squash and stretch controller on top of the head of the character because it doesn't really fit what I wanted for this animation, but using the eyes and the tip of the nose and slightly dragging them backward kind of input this squash and stretch feeling of the motion. I will proceed the same with the ears. I will make them drag whenever there is a fast motion and I will create a slight overshoot or jiggling of the heels. Very subtle whenever there is a stop into the motion. So I've been animating the nose, the ears and the eyes using the straight-ahead method. And it's ideal for this kind of secondary motion where you can't really predict where the heels are going to be rotating, where the nose is going to be, while you have all the other controllers to polish first. This is the kind of motion that is really hard to block or to predict. This is a technique that I use a lot whenever I'm animating fingers, for example, I will shape the end ring, the blocking stage but I won't necessarily put a lot of detail during the breakdowns and stuff like that. Since a lot of things can happen in the animation of the eyes, the fingers, the ears, the ponytail, whatever, all those secondary elements of a character, I oftenly animate them using the straight ahead method meaning that I've blocked my character, or least most of it. And then on top of this, I will add those additional motion or additional animation that are currently following the broad and main animation of your character. And you've probably, haven't seen me working on each curve of those controllers and that's perfectly fine. At some point you don't need to polish each curve. You can simply watch the animation and watch the spacing in the 3D viewport and see if it does work. Curved editing is super important but it's not mandatory for every controllers. So I rapidly polish the hips because it was mainly compensating the motion of the character or the movement of the character. And I can now switch my attention to the feet of the character. (air whooshing) I tend to be kind of lazy whenever I'm working on the feet of character. And that's a very big mistake. So this is one of the thing I'm trying to improve in my animation. Feet tend to have a lot of motion and a lot of beginner tend to keep them still on the ground. So you should avoid it. Whenever you feel like your character is losing balance maybe offset a bit the foot and create some kind of very small step. One of the very important thing regarding walks and whatever kind of steps you are doing, is that any character, whether it's an animal or a human being will try to put as less energy into it as possible, meaning that you will raise your leg as less as possible. When we see the original motion path shown on the screen right now, we can see that I had the very eye position of the foot on frame 14. This is why I edited the Z curve of the location of the foot. And when I update, you can see that now the curve is looking a bit better. The forward spacing is a little weird because I have a big acceleration on the Y curve and then it slowed down. So I'm kind of flattening them with the Y curve and also lowering the foot just before the contact pose. When the foot was moving forward, I edited the rotation of the curve so that it just drags a bit backward. And then when it's contacting on the ground, I will slightly raise it to have this kind of slap motion only on one frame. That's perfectly fine, but we will feel this is a very important tip that will make your animation looks a little better. Whenever you are doing a step whether for a whole cycle or an animation like that, you should avoid flat curve on the rotation channels during the contact pose on frame 16. Having it flat on the next frame is totally fine. There is always a bit of control of foot slapping on one or two frame, and then the curve get flat. So as this first step is polished, I can work on the elbow joint of my character as the front leg get over extended. It seems to be bending the wrong way, so I will just frame by frame, push a bit back this tweaker your controller, just to get a slight bending. I don't need to care about the curve here, I'm just caring about the shape of my character. (air whooshing) All right, let's move on the left front leg or left hand if you will. The first thing I will do as usual is calculate the path of this hand and it has really become an automatism for me to use the motion path in production. With it, I can see right away that the motion of the foot is not correct. The arc as in it's shape where I'd like it to have more of a C-shape forward. I'd like to create a foot roll motion on the next frame from the tip of the foot. So from the side view, I shift right click on to the tip of the foot. Then I will switch the pivot point to be using the 3D cursor. And I will rotate the foot forward. Since this is a pose I would spend time to get right, using the graph editor. It's better to pose it directly in the 3D view. So is that Blender will write the curves for me. And then I just need to polish using this in-between curve we've just created. From there, I have enough information to start polishing the curve working first on the Z and Y location, here I'm building a slight overshoot on the Y axis so that the character will push his hand forward. And then the back as it reaches the highest point and they will update my motion path to see if my arch is looking good. And then I will slightly tweak the plateau shape of the Y and Z curve to avoid having a pure holding here. I want to add a slight moving hold so that the hand feels connected to the body that is still moving. The left-to-right motion of the front foot is pretty subtle. So I will just smooth out the curve and input a bit of an overshoot on frame 20 and a bit up jiggle on frame 25. So when I polish to location channel, for example, I always double check my animation through different angles. I also play the hold section. I'm polishing to make sure that everything looks connected and relevant. From there, I can work on the rotation. So why the rotation is the main motion of this front leg on this part on the animation, polishing the rotation of the front foot or the hand of the character will really improve the motion. So I'm just mainly working on the X but only on rotation first, adding a bit of dragging. Then I work on the Y and Z pattern on rotation just to add a bit of twisting and a bit of dragging on the left and right motion of the hand. And the here again, I will bend a slight overshoot on the curve. So you can see that curve wise in the graph editor you will often get the same kind of shape the same curve behavior. So don't be afraid by the graph editor this is something you will get used to very fast, if you practice. (air whooshing) Polishing the tail was pretty straightforward as it is mostly a follow through animation. So I do believe you now understand that I always work with the channel that input the most motion. This is why I stopped with the X rotation curve. So this is a pretty different behavior compared with the run cycle or the gym cycle we've made before. Here, I want faster whipping motion, meaning that the motion of the tail is not supporting the movement of the character. It's not drawing the shape and the path of the character through space. I'm using the tail here with fast and snapping motion to show the attitude of the character. When we watched the reference, we can see that the tail move very quickly and then just stop. So I want those the little wavey motion to happen very fast. On the first contact, the motion of the tail is here to balance the character. But as soon as he stop, the tail motion will be mostly used to show the character the emotion of our character whether he's happy, curious, or whatever. And having those rapid change in the shape of the tail really translate the fast pace of the metabolism of small mammals, like the squirrel, the mouse, et cetera. If you think of the tail of a cow or an elephant it can move quickly, but it won't stop instantly. There will be inertia. There will be follow through animation. While on this character, the follow through might be like on two or three frame maximum and you just freezing the hair. So I'm repeating the same concept again and again but all of those follow through animation can translate the weight of your character or the stiffness. Here, for example, while the tail is very flexible at some point it's full of muscle and our character can kind of hold it in place. Like whip it's tail and it stop it. And I think this is a very specific motion of the squirrel tail that will make it more believable or at least that will input this squirrel-like motion to our digital character. On those fast-paced motion, It's pretty hard to get a nice tail shape. And this is why on this specific part I'm almost animating on the ones. It means that I have a key frame on almost each frame. This is what animating on ones means, is that you will have a different pose or different key frame on each frame of your animation. When animating digitally, we kind of always animate on ones meaning that our character has a different pose on each frame but when animating traditionally or making 2D drawings it happened sometime that you will keep the same drawing on one, two or three frames. In this case, you will be animating on two or on three. So it's not correct to say that I'm animating on ones because I'm putting a key frame on each frame but that's kind of a way of talking or saying that at some point, you might need to detail your animation on ones and insert a key frame on every frame. And for each of those poses, especially on action motion or on very fast motion like the tail motion of your character. In the end of polishing the segment of the animation I've been working with the tweaker bone of the back leg to keep the back leg slightly bent the right way, slightly bent forward. That was kind of a long video with a lot of information. I will keep the next one as short as possible.

## 03-16-02-Polishing idle part2

[Instructor] Let's continue polishing the idle animation of our character. We will be focusing on the next portion of this animation where our character is switching to a sitting pose. Let's have a quick look to the body motion first. I will make a little draw-over using SyncSketch here. When transitioning on frame 28. We can see that the body of our character is moving a little up in micro-anticipation. This is an anticipation, very subtle, that occur on only one frame. The idea here is not to input that much of energy into the movement but to give a little contrast to the next move, and let the audience know that our character will be sitting. Thanks to the locally style of our character, it's pretty easy to track its motion. I just want to show you the design of the arc when our character is sitting. But also the spacing. Our character is contacting with the ground but he will slow down. There will be an ease into the sitting pose so that he doesn't hurt his butt. This arc and spacing does read on the curve. On frame 28, I'm creating the little micro-anticipation by just pushing the curve a little up. Then I've created the arc motion, using the motion path as usual. And I'm creating the easing out with our curve flattening in the end of the motion on frame 36 here. Once I'm happy with the main body controller, I always work on the chest. So if we track the shoulder that is directly influenced by the chest motion, I've created a dragging motion, mainly working on the rotation curve of the chest. If you compare the tracking of the blue line with the red line, we can see that we get a nice C shape with the blue line, and a nice S shape with the dragging chest. As we use the tip of the nose to track the head motion, you can use the neck controller to track the chest motion. Note that I've hidden the limbs. It makes the readability of the torso way better. (screen whooshing) When working on the head before I track my arc, the first thing I've done was to remove this bump on the z rotation. It didn't fit the current motion of the head, just adding extra noise to the movement. And it doesn't make sense that our character shake his head left to right when switching to the sitting pose. Motion wise, the head is slightly dragging compared to the torso, but I haven't input that much rotation because I want my character to be in control. If you input too much up and down rotation to the head, it will feel a bit weird as if the head was very heavy. So we can see that the arc of the head is very close to the arc made by the torso controller. Here we can see the result with the body controller, chest and head polished. I did work on the ears and the nose as in the previous video, working with the straighter head method, meaning that I'm animating quite on the fly as the animation goes, inputting a very, very subtle follow-through animation to the ears. And then I did the same with the tip of the nose. Since the sitting motion is pretty slow, pretty subtle, pretty light, whatever, your follow-through animation should be very subtle too. So it's just an extra motion that will give a bit more life to your character. If you're not comfortable with this, it's better not to do it than overdoing it. Before the head turn, I like to add an eye blink. I oftenly use eye blink whenever the character is changing his head stance, like a big head turn in our case, but also if our character is surprised and push his head up very quickly, I like to use the eyes to support this animation. I'm doing the same eye motion on both eyes, and the idea is to have a slight ease in and a slight ease out. Shape wise, the eye is fully open. Then it's closing a bit on the next frame. On the third frame, it's totally closed. And then when reopening, it will open just a bit and then on the next frame, it's fully opened. (screen whooshing) Next step was to animate the tail. In this case, the tail is not used to balance or in reaction to the motion of the character's body. The idea was to create a wiping motion before our character sit. As if he was relaxing his tail before sitting. Think a bit as if you were going on the beach, on the sand, and you were just wiping your towel before laying onto it. That's exactly what I wanted to communicate here. The final stage was to polish the hands animation or front legs animation. As always, the arcs are the most important thing you have to watch for, so make sure that you draw nice arcs with the motion path. And using the rotation, make the tip of the fingers or the tip of the foot slightly dragging in the motion. You can add a slight overshoot when you reach the top position. Beyond those classics, there are two things you have to watch for. First, avoid the twinning. So we have broken the twinning in the pose during the blocking, making the left hand going higher than the right hand, but it's better also to break the twinning in the timing, meaning that here my right hand hit its highest point one or two frame prior than the left hand. Also, the right hand is moving slightly faster than the left hand because the character is pushing with it. So there is an impulsion on the right hand, while the left hand that doesn't contact the ground. It's just continuing the previous motion. So beware of the spacing between the right hand and the left hand. The next video will be a time lapse of me polishing this whole section of the animation. Just double check the notes that I have highlighted in this video into the next one, and I'll see you in the video after.

## 03-16-04-Polishing idle part 3

[Instructor] In this video, we will polish the moment our character is making his head turn and smell the air. He's sniffing the air. For this one, the body controller motion is quite subtle, because in the end our character is not really changing stance. He's rotating a bit and raising a bit. So as usual, I'm trying to make a nice arc when I'm doing this kind of motion. This time, the arc is more subtle than usual because the motion is subtle. As the character is shifting to its left and rotating to its left, I'm first slightly lowering the whole body and then raising it. It will create this arc. This lower stance can be used as some kind of anticipation. One thing I should have done and you should do is that just before the character smells the air as he push his body a little upper you could add a micro anticipation on frame 60 for example, just lowering the body attached before raising it even more. This is something I've explained before when we have done the walk cycle something I like to update early on or polish early on are the contacting controllers. So as our character's shifting his weight onto his left I want to move his foot controller too. As the body was polished, I have reworked the spacing of the footstep making it a little faster and then I've changed it's timing so that it starts just after the body start rotating but it lands before the body hit it's extreme pose. Motion-wise it's pretty simple for the location. The X and Y axis are using vector handles so is that I have a linear interpolation. As for the other foot contact animation we have done before for the Z location, the contacting frame 49 and 53 are using vector handles and on frame 51 I've created a slight bump on the curve. Keep it subtle, don't forget that we are lazy and we won't be raising the foot that much. What will really improve this footstep is the rotation in the foot, this is very important. It's a very subtle motion I don't say that I'm doing it perfectly but what I'm sure is that animators will look at these kind of details. When the foot raise it's dragging so the outer part of the foot is pointing down. Then it's raising so that the ball of the foot is facing the ground. On the contact frame the foot is still rotated and on the next frame, I will make the foot flat so that I have this slap motion on the ground. From the side view, it's even more obvious the foot's raised, the tip of the foot is dragging. Then just before the contact frame the tip of the foot is raising on the contact post the tip of the foot is still raised and on the next post it's flattened to get the snap effect on the ground. The chest motion is here to support the head rotation. The head is leading the animation meaning that the chest will be slightly delayed compared to the head. In the end they arrived almost at the same time on their extreme pose. The little extra information regarding the chest controller is that I've been using the location to emphasize the smelling motion. I've used it to pull the character up and then I've added a slight bump on the curve to create the smelling motion. It adds an extra up and down motion to the chest which is connected to the head and the head will be rotating or moving this up-and-down motion that translate our character smelling the air. As usual, when I'm polishing the head rotation I'm tracking the motion path of the nose. To create the smelling motion I've just added a couple of bump on the X rotation curve of the head controller. Keep it subtle, you don't need the head to nod that much and test different spacing. In my case, having the first bump on frame 66 and the second on frame After I finished polishing the head rotation, I've added a bit of extra motion on the nose playing with its Y curve. The idea wasn't to make the nose dragging but instead moving forward and inward so that we can feel the breathing of our character while he's smelling the air. This is why the Y curve was working great for this one. You can pause the nose by hand if you're not comfortable with the curve and try different timing. Another detail I wanted to add on top of this are the eyes slightly closing while our character is smelling the air. That's a pretty common thing when you are focusing on when you are smelling something good, you tend to close your eyes to focus on the sense that is used to focus on your smell. There's only the Z curve that controlled the eyeopening so editing this curve is very simple. The ears are also pretty important to support this specific animation. If you watch the spacing between the head rotation tracking the eyes and the ear rotation, we can see that the spacing is more important on the left ear and this is because I wanted the ear to lead the animation. The character rotate the ears towards his next move because the ears communicate his center of attention and as he's going to smell the air, the ears, the eyes, everything is pointing in the same direction because he's focusing on smelling the air in this very direction. For this part of the animation I've also softened the hips rotation. So they are still there. There is still a little twisting as the character is pulling his left leg toward the contact point. This is why I spent a lot of time on the Z quaternions rotation curve. Between frame 52 and 56 the leg is getting pulled and on frame 58, the pose settle. So we can see the curve changing direction. It's getting down between frame 52 and 55, and after that it's getting up ever so slightly. The next thing I have polished on this segment of the animation were the arms. Since they are not contacting with anything try to draw nice arcs with your arm motion. The second thing we have pointed out during the blocking stage was using the arm as a counterweight to keep our character balanced. So as the body is raising for the smelling segment of the animation, the right arm is dropping. It lowers the center of gravity of our character and it's also a nice contrast with the left arm that is raised. In the time-lapse you will also see me a bit fighting with the right tail board character because there was a bit of intersection and wobbling in the right arm. This is the kind of problem and limitation you can get when using inverse kinematic without a pole target as we are for the legs. There is a little technique to fix it using constraint but this is something that we will see in the next chapter where I will introduce you to space switching. On the time being I'm a bit fighting with the curve, that's not a big deal, honestly. And if you have the same kind of problem just try to fix it but don't waste too much time on to it. Regarding the time motion, there are two things to consider. The little wiping animation a bit nervous, again, to translate the character of the squirrel, the root of the tail doesn't move that much, there is just the middle and mostly the tip of the tail that are moving. Again, this is not a big motion as during the run cycle or to recover from the jump. It's just a little something to give personality to our character and to transition into the next pose, which is very important. If we watch the silhouette of our character we can clearly see that he seems to be slightly bending or leaning forward. This is the pose where he's smelling the air surrounding him. So he's trying to reach as high and as far as possible. And it seems that he's going to fall forward. So in this case, the final pose of the time is very important because it serves as a counterweight. So those are all the details you need to look for when you are going to polish the segment of the animation.

## 03-16-06-Polishing idle part 4

[Instructor] For this new segment of the animation instead of polishing the body controller first, I re-timed the feet steps. The idea is to avoid the twinning as explained before and having all the feet contacting with the ground at the same time. You can see here that each feet is contacting the ground with an offset of one frame. The goal here is not to polish the feet step but just to refine the timing. So I'm using the action in the tone or the graffiti tone because it's easier to read. I can easily find whenever the foot controller is changing position and change the timing by offsetting those key frames. As usual, I haven't found the right timing. We've made first trail so I'm just playing the animation lot moving the key frame until I feel like I have a good rhythm. As soon as I was happy with this base rhythm I started working on the body controller as I have done in the previous videos. As usual I'm trying to get a nice arc working first with the location curve. Since our character is moving on the side, the X location and Z location curve are the most influential. To make the character a bit more lively, I will input the slight overshoot on frame 82. Since the motion is driven by the fear and awareness of our character, the head is leading the animation because he has heard something. So as we have seen before it's even the heels of that are leading the animation. This is why I take a particular care to have a nice head rotation and the head pointing toward the next point. So as usual, I'm tracking the nose of the character. So it might not be the best move to start polishing the head before the chest. But in this case, the chest motion is not that important meaning that there is not that much influence. And most of the emotion comes from the main body controller I have already polished and the head rotation controller. And as usual once I'm happy with the head rotation and I'm polishing the chest I can get back onto the head rotation to fix any bumps on the arcs of the head. And here we can see all the nose motion path draw a nice arc. And as I move on polishing the chest I'm calculating the motion path of the head. In the previous video, I was using the neck controller. You can use weather the head or the neck. That's not the problem. And since I've already polished the main body controller you can see that the arc of the root of the head is pretty clean already. So I'm just very slightly refining the rotation, the twisting of the chest to make it drag a bit. There is a second step in this head turn animation where our character is looking backward even more because he has probably heard another noise. So to input a bit of this fear I pushed down the Z location curve to create a micro anticipation toward the next turn. So as usual for the second step, I'm working first on the chest controller or working on the location curves and then the bit on the rotation curve and then I will go ahead with the chest and head rotation. As I've made this micro anticipation to emphasize this new movement and as it is very fast, I'm creating a slight bump on frame 93 to create a nice overshoot. Those little bounces on the curve tend to bring a bit of texture into the animation and make our character less robotic. Later on, I've worked on the head location curve to slightly extend the neck of the character. So I (mumbles) the head up. It's really changed the silhouette of the character and we can better even read the tension, the fear, the alert of the character. I've also added a slight bump on the Z curve on frame 93, creating a subtle head bounce. Working on the feet was very close to what we have already seen before. Since those are very short steps, X and Y location curve are almost linear or there is a very short easing in the beginning of the motion, making the foot accelerating toward the next position. While making the next step make sure that you don't trace the foot that much because every motion uses energy and we are all lazy. So it's the same for this character. We need to make those steps very subtle and then we can make the foot drag through rotation. So it's exactly as in the previous videos we raise the foot as less as possible. We set the end-all to vector whenever the foot is taking off and contacting with the ground, because in those case the foot should be accelerating before contacting the ground. We then use the rotation of the foot to create a nice dragging motion. And as the foot is contacting the ground I keep it rotated on frame 80 for example and then it gets flat one frame later on frame 81 so that we get this nice slapping of the foot on the ground. As I was happy with the back leg motion, I then focus on the pole controllers that will allow us to change the orientation of the knee and the ankle of the back feet. The idea here is just to input a bit of delay in the knee motion so that we have a bit of dragging. The knees pointing toward the next point. And then it settles just after the contacting frame so that we will have a little shaking in the legs that will look more natural. I did the same with the left back leg but with away most subtle motion since the foot doesn't move that much. I haven't polished those pole target controller that much on this animation and the gain it's a matter of time. If you want to spend time to add those subtle detail to your animation, it will sure look better. As any craft the more time you will input into your animation the better it should look. For the front leg, it's the same story as usual try to make good ox, avoid twinning. So we have offset the footstep in the beginning of the video in putting one frame between the contact in the pose of the right front leg and the left front leg. And then I use rotation to input some dragging into the motion of the feet. Then I've tried reworking the main body controller and the chest rotation to avoid the front right leg to be over extended. It makes the character looking unbalanced which I don't like, but after a few trial, I've decided to add a new step to the front right leg. So that's perfectly fine to add new poses to your cat while you are polishing. I've created these new foot pose on frame 95 and I've duplicated the curve until frame 99. Then I'm scrubbing through the animation to check the timing and spacing of this new step. And from there I will polish it as we usually do working first on the location curve and then on the rotation curve. Those little additional footstep are very relevant for this kind of small mammals. It communicate the thrust and tension of our character hearing some noise, but also their fast paced metabolism. If you watch mouse or cat references you will see that they moved their feet all the time. I've policed the heaps last and I've slightly changed the pose of the heaps by raising the back of the character. I felt like when I raised a bit of my character help you looks more aware and more ready to flee if any danger is coming then the second polish stage is mostly working on those rotation curve. Make sure that I have smooth rotation and make sure that the silhouette of my character and the shape of your spine looks natural. As usual, the final stage is to work on the tail rotation. So I always start working with the root of the tail, working with its rotation axis and then I go along onto the chain. As usual, you can study the full time lapse of this polishing stage in the next video. I will see you in the video afterwards, that is going to be the very last video of this idle animation.

## 03-16-08-Polishing idle part 5

This is the final part of the polishing stage of the idle. It's gonna be a quick one because there is not that much of an action. In the end, our character is getting into its anticipation before jumping into the run cycle to flee the danger. You now should know that we are going to track all the arts especially the head motion. For this segment of the animation, the body controller will lead the animation. Then the chest is dragging, then the head is dragging. We can really feel that the head is getting (indistinct) by the hips motion of the character. And since after the idle, we have a pretty extreme motion with our run cycle. The idea was to eat the extreme pose on frame 104. And on the next pose, we will push that extreme compressing our character to a maximum before it goes into the jumping action. Since most of the last pose were duplicated from the run cycle, the handle of the curve might be rotated. So, I will select them, press V and switch to auto clump. Then polishing the body controller was pretty fast. I, (indistinct) a bit on to the rotation curves so that I get a bit of easing before reaching the frame 104 which is our extreme pose that we are going to push on frame 105. Then I've worked on the chest rotation, the idea was to make the chest dragging. So, I've slightly delayed the rotation by pulling a bit the curves down toward their previous value. And as I reach frame 103, I slightly rotate the curve so that I get a natural overshoot. 'Cause I'm getting a nice arc with a nice spacing, you will see me pushing the X rotation curve down on frame 105. This is where I'm really pushing the pose to have a very strong anticipation before the jump forward. Polishing the head rotation was pretty simple. I've made the head dragging and I got rid of any twisting or unwanted rotation. The idea is to get a very clean rotation toward the extreme pose as our character is going to flee. There is no secondary motion in the head because it's a very fast transition to the anticipation before the run. Then I've quickly reworked the heels animation to make sure that their timing was a bit offset compared to the head timing and the whole body timing. The idea is to change the pose of the head within one or two frames to get to very snappy rotation, very snappy motion of the heels. Then I spent some time trying to create an eye blink as the character while he's rotating his head but I didn't kept this additional motion. Because as the eyes are blinking it creates a slight glitch into the animation. And we already have a very fast motion of the head rotating but the silhouette of our character get a drastic change and it creates a lot of visual information. Adding the eye blink on top of this, make this portion of the animation very noisy in the end. The other thing is that, this black dot that is the eye of our character, really help tracking the head motion. So, it really helps the audience following the head rotation in this particular case. So, if you make the eye disappear while the character is rotating very fast, it's like, he blinks and then he's in another pose. That really doesn't read well. So in end, I've just slightly squashed the eyes so that we get a different head shape but I've kept the eyes opened. So, adding secondary motion will sure bring more appeal to your animation, but sometime it will make sure animation worst by destroying its readability. So, be careful with this and if adding this kind of secondary motion then looks weird and you can't identify the problem on your animation just get rid of it. Secondary motion like an eye blink is here to support the animation. To make it more readable or more interesting. When polishing the hips, I've just make it drag a bit compared to the main body controller, and I've made sure that I add some kind of big drop between frame 104 and 105 to again push the pause on frame 105. This is going to be our micro anticipation before the jump so every controller that defines the silhouette of our character should be pushed a bit. The feet steps were very fast. There is nothing new compared to the previous polishing stage. Just make sure that you have different timing for the different feet. And make sure that your spacing is correct, avoiding easing whenever the foot is going to contact with the ground. This is why I almost always switch my contacting location channels to vector. And then as usual, I will polish a bit more the foot motion by inputting a bit of rotation to make the tip of the feet drag compared to their location. One super important secondary motion I wanted to add was the breathing motion. To create it, you have to use the chest controller, and use the X and Z scale channels. Because the Y scale channel will push in a way the head forward while the X and Z scale will make the chest slightly bigger. To figure this out, I've just been moving the curve up and down and see how my character behaves. And once I was happy with it, I've tried to find the right spacing for this animation. After a couple of tests, I found that using six frame to make a full breathing cycle, kind of marched what I wanted to have for this character. When you watch the reference, you can see that the belly of the character is moving very fast. And this is very common, the smaller an animal the faster we'll be it's breathing. I haven't created any breathing variation on this animation because again, that will take time and the benefit was pretty low, but adding the secondary motion of the breathing was very important and it really brings something new to the table. So, in the end on frame 20 and 26, I've slightly scaled down the X and Z and on frame Then I will get rid of all the next key frame, select those three key frame press Shift to duplicate X constraint on the X axis and move by six frame on the right. And then, I've pressed a Shift+R several time to repeat the operation. Just press Shift+R until you have filled your timeline until a frame 105. These little secondary action, the breathing motion really adds to the animation and I feel like it betterly define the kind of character we are currently animating. Adding these fast paced secondary action really makes our character feeling more alive. As I finished polishing this idle animation, I want to isolate it from the run cycle. So I will insert a keyframe on all the channels on the last frame, 105, and on the first frame of this idle, the frame 12. Then I will select all the keys on the frame 105, press the V key and switch the handle type to free. I will do the same on frame 20. This way we can remove the previous frame and the last frame without any influence on frame 12 and frame 105. From there, we can duplicate our action, make sure it does a fake user by clicking the shield icon. And then we can remove frame 0 to frame 11 and all the key frame after frame 105. Then select all the keys and offset them so that the first key frame starts on frame zero. And now we have our cleaned up idle animation ready to be used later on.

## 03-17 Squirrel climbing analysis

[Instructor] The last animation we need to complete our squirrel sequence is the climbing animation. I've already explain you that studying reference was very important and I found two nice references for this animation. And to be honest while studying them, I was really surprised on how the squirrel move while its climbing. If I was to do it without reference I would have not done it right for sure. When studying reference, it's better to study each part separately. I will start with the silhouette of our character. And I will try to draw the hips, chest and head. Whether it's the squirrel character or a human character. It's very important to check out the position between the hips and chest and chest and head. Look at how during the motion, the hips, chest and head gets aligned and how the space or the distance between each features is growing. The whole body of the character is stretching toward the next part. (wind howling) The next thing you can do to help you read the shape of the character, is draw what we call the line of action. We will have a deeper look to what line of action is in the mastering pose chapter, but for the time being, just think of a curve that connects the head, the chest and the hips and that define simplified version of the curvature of the body of your character. This is the most simplified version of the shape of the body. That we're going to create. It's really fascinating to see how we start with an s-shape and how it gets stretched and get back to this s-shape. (wind howling) The next step is to track the hands and the feet of the character. While the shape is not that surprising, the thing is that I don't know when the feet are contacting, compared to the hands, and this is why I'm tracking those elements. I'm trying to figure when they take off the trunk and when they contact again with it. And we can see that the ends of the character take off very early on, while the feet stays in contact. There is a moment where our character is totally our bones. So it means that he's jumping and then the hand and the feet have like one frame offset or the contact. If I quickly do the same with the second reference you will find a link to the YouTube video in the documentation. The behavior of the character is pretty close to what we had on the first reference, the front legs or hands, are taking off very early on while the feet are still in contact with the trunk. The main difference compared to the previous reference is the timing of the contact pose. On this reference, both the ends and the feet seems to contact at the same time. (wind howling) The next thing I wanted to check was the spacing of the hips and the spacing of the head. So I've tried to pound a point on the hips that allow me to track them. There was a different of color in the fur of the character and to track the head, I've simply tracked the eyes of the character and we can really see that the head is going very fast in the beginning and stops, and then the hips catch up. So there will be quite of a difference between the hazing of the hips and the hazing of the head position. (wind howling) The last thing I've checked was the distance between the chest of the character and the tree trunk. And it's pretty surprising, as the character is pushing forward, his chest is getting closer to the tree trunk. This isn't something I would have guessed because when you are used to make run cycle, you tend to push your character away from the ground, while he's pushing on his leg to move forward. While here as the character is pushing on his legs is getting closer and closer to the tree trunk. And as you get in contact with the tree trunk is slightly get away from it. And that's a major difference compared to a run cycle. Let's block this animation.

## 03-18-Squirrel climb blocking

Let's gets starting with the blocking of the climbing cycle of our squirrel character. For the previous animation, we will start fresh. I will duplicate the keying action rename it off free climbing blocking and make sure that it does affect chooser by clicking the little shield icon. I will select the rig and instead of protecting the character vertically in pose mode, I will rotate it in object mode so that we can have a vertical representation of the character but it will still be moving forward whenever we are animating it. It's also better to create a tree trunk dummy. So in object mode, I will press Shift + A and add a cylinder and I will scale it in edit mode vertically. I will make sure that its silhouette is aligned with the z-axis so that it's aligned with the origin of the document. The initial pose I will use the squashed pose of the character in the video reference. Can use the corresponding then their file as a reference, all the picture in this video. First in object mode, I'm make sure that my character is properly aligned with the tree trunk. I always start the blocking off of pose by moving the main controller of the body and trying to find the contact pose for the feet. One important thing when you watch a reference is to see the position of the different body feature compared one to the other. If we have a look to the back feet, they're more forward than the hips. The hips are currently hanging in the void and the back legs are pulling the body up. The tail motion on this animation will be pretty subtle. So I just place it so that it's smoothly hanging and not clipping with the tree truck. Then I'm working on the feet and hand position so that they are contacting with the tree trunk, why? You generally aligned the feet with the running direction. In the case of this animation, I've opened the feet and the hands in a V-shape. This way, our character will have a better grab on the tree trunk. When they look at my reference, I would slightly push the hands up. Imagine you are hanging on to a wall or a tree, your arm will mainly be stretched. The main difference here is that the character is very light so he won't be stretching his arm or his arm won't be as extended as if he was very heavy. But this is something I will have to consider whenever I'm starting to polish my character animation is make sure that we have the feeling, he's pulling himself up. Finally as I felt that the character was a bit too squashed, I've just pulled a bit the hips and the chest controller. And we are done with this first pose. When it comes to block the second pose, I advise you to go for one of the most extreme pose. Don't try to block the next pose in the emotion of the character. The second advice is that you can choose whether you move the root bone or not. I've decided to move the root bone and try to compensate the position of the feet, and it was some kind of extra work. You can animate your character on place and then during the polishing stage or during the splaining stage, we will input some linear motion of the root bone to fix that. Important thing here is not to answer any technical issue, but really to match the references. As the second extreme pose, I've selected the one where our character is about to lose contact with the tree trunk. The front legs are already not contacting the tree trunk anymore, but the front leg are still in contact with it. The key feature we have seen that during the reference analysis, is that the body is getting closer to the tree trunk as the character is pushing the hips, chest and head get really extended, the head and chest extend first and those three body features gets more or less aligned into a straight pose. So one important thing too is that we have to push the pose. So here I feel like the pose is okay but not pushed as much as I liked it to. It's better to push it a little too much as it's going to be a very fast-paced animation. So we need quite of a striking silhouette change of our character so that the animation will read well. Only to the mistake I've made and I will need to fix later on, is that I've used the main body controller and pushed the character up a lot. So you can use the body controller for the left to right up and down motion, but avoid moving it too much forward and back because this is a motion that will be mostly generated by the root motion and the locomotion of the character. Slightly adjust the hands of my character and I think we are good to go for the next pose. As explained before, I haven't made my life easier by choosing to move the root bone. So what I'm doing here is that I'm trying to figure out how much of a distance the character is moving during one jump. So I'm trying to figure out a point on the tree trunk or the back of the tree and the head and hips position of the character. In the end, I figured that the character was moving his whole body and the hips were getting further away by one head. So the character is jumping off it's full body length plus one head. Since we are building a cycle, the first and last pose should be the same. So I will duplicate the first pose and move it on frame 20. And holding the D key and left clicking, I will draw some reference point to measure the position of the head and then the position of the hips of the character. So I move the base of the hips, one head further than the position of the head on the previous pose. This is not rocket science, you can push it a little further if you want it will make your jumping motion a little more dynamic. The next pose I want to work on is when our character is airborne. So I just push a bit the root bone up because our character is traveling through space. And then we can start reworking the silhouette of our character. This is the point where the front legs are fully extended forward, the body shape of the character is pretty straightened but the head and the chest are slowly catching up meaning that the distance between those two is getting a little smaller while the hips are really dragging. When you are posing the legs, make sure that you look at it from every angles and realign the knees with the body. I also make sure that both the feet and the ends of the character are not symmetrical, It will look a bit boring. For this motion, I haven't set any left to right motion into the spine nor any twisting. I guess there should be some but it's pretty hard to figure out right now, while in the polishing, based on the contacting pose we might be able to input a bit of it. As our main key poses or golden poses are now down, we can go ahead and add some in-betweens or breakdowns.

## 03-19-Climb inbetween

[Instructor] Since it's a pretty complex animation, we do need more poses in the blocking stage so let's add some in-betweens. The first pose I've been working on was the pushing pose, the character is getting almost fully extended the front legs or hands are just about to leave the trunk, the back legs are not extended yet, pressing Shift S I've snapped the cursor to the leg of my character, now I can push the foot backward and then move to root bone forward or upward since our character is rotated to match the previous position of the foot so that we don't have this sliding contact effect. The trick here is that I input the value of the movement with the keyboard pressing G then Z to move along the global Z axis and press 0.08 to move by eight centimeters, this way, I do know how much I have moved the foot and I will offset the root bone, but also the hands of the character by the same value this way I'm sure that I will have corresponding motion for all the parts of the characters. It's a good way to do this because it's very accurate but it's also a bad way because it's a very constraint way to do this thing, this is why I advised you not to use any root motion for the blocking of this animation in the previous video but to show doing so that's not bad because this is something we will have to do later on, so it gives us a base to work on, doing it the hard way here might not be the most intuitive way to do it that's what I'm meaning but I will have a solid base to go into polishing them. Dispose is the one where the head has the biggest spacing compared to the previous pose, it's one of the first pose where the character is pushing forward, so I will extend the neck of the character quite a bit, it feels like the front legs are a bit too extended and on the reference we can see that the front legs are not touching the trunk anymore so I will put them into a pose where they just took off the tree trunk. Since this in-between is starting to define the emotion of the character because we have the extreme poses and this is an in-between so it makes the transition between those two poses, this is why I'm playing the animation of curbing through the frames a lot beyond matching the reference pose I'm trying to feel the emotion of the character. Try to fix the orientation of the arms I'm facing some kind of issues with the rings, some limitations, this is pretty usual with this kind of inverse kinematic controllers so I reset the rotation and instead I'm using those tweaker controllers to give a better shape to the arms, so I advise you to deal with the shape of the arms using those controller for this specific animation. The next critical pose for me is the one whenever the character is contacting with the surface of the tree trunk, this contact frame is occurring between frame 15 and 20 so I will set it up from 18 for example, it really doesn't matter from the time being we are just breeding the different poses and then at the end of the video we will do a rapid timing paths. The first thing I do to switch to this new pose is to move the root bone so I've been trying to move it using the same technique as for the previous pose meaning that I'm moving the root bone entering a proper value with the keyboard, but since my character has no contact with the tree trunk it doesn't really matter if shall not really accurate with the position of the root bone right now, there won't be that much of the problem we will be able to offset a bit the position of the root bone during the polishing stage. What's important here is that since there is no contacting frame, no part of the character contacting with the tree trunk or with the ground for example, the fact that the root bone motion is not perfect, doesn't matter, we won't have any sliding foot effect here because there is no contact with the ground. So in the end, because of this foot motion and the squeal to have everything perfectly aligned and to try, I spent most of the time trying to figure out a way to position the hands properly while it wasn't important, the only thing important is to make sure that the position of the hands are correct compared to frame 20 and even if there is a bit of a challenge a bit of a difference this is something we'll be able to fix when we are polishing by moving the curve or duplicating the curves, what's matter here is really the pose of the character, so the front legs are almost fully extended, the back legs are catching up pointing toward their landing pose. And finally, we have still the hip sat down dragging a bit, but they are slowly catching up, while the chest and head are getting very close to their final pose or to the pose we have on frame 20, so you can see on the reference that the curvature of the body of our character is slowly getting back into it's S shape. The next pose is more of a breakdown that in in-between onto this breakdown between frame zero and five, because on frame five our character ends a normal angle contacting the tree trunk with all my read controller selected, I'm pressing a Shift E, then when I moved the mouse left to right I changed the value of the breakdown, I will set it to 50%, then they will left click to confirm this way blender has automatically interpolated all the controller of my character by 50% between frame zero and frame five, now I don't want to move the hand controllers, so I go back on frame zero select one of the hand controller press Shift S snap the cursor to it, then I go back onto frame two my break down pose and press Shift S selection to cursor the hand will be snapped on to the same position as on frame zero, I will repeat the process for the other hand and this way my whole character body and root has moved by 50%, and I can work on this pose and the feet position is fixed, thanks to this little manipulation. So now I can work on the torso controller to refine the pose and offset the different element because if everything is interpolated by 50% I will have a very robotic motion of my character. So here, as we have explained before during the reference analysis I'm pushing a lot the neck and chest of my character while the hips are dragging a bit back, from there what I did is that I have taken all the key frame of each pose and I have set them every two frames, so one on frame zero one on frame two, four, six, eight, 10, and 12. I feel like this cycle should be 12 frame long so I'm just kind of distributing the different posts evenly for the time being because I'm not working on the timing of the animation right now but it does help reading the animation. The last pose I wanted to create is the one where the back legs are contacting with the tree trunk as explained why we were locking the idle animation you should create a bring down pose each time there is a drastic change in the pose of your character meaning that here the back feet are abohm and then they are contacting with the surface in this regard, their mechanical function and the way they move is changing a lot because when they are floating in the air you should be looking for arcs while when they are impacting with the tree trunk, you're not looking anymore for arcs but mostly for a linear interpolation as the foot is sliding along the surface. So it's better to add a breakdown to this pose than trying to figure this out during the polishing stage, this pose was pretty quick to achieve because we have already depends on the front legs already contacting the tree trunks and the only thing we had to do is to make sure that the back legs are contacting and the hips catch, I've made a quick timing paths here, but I will show you how to get a better timing paths in the next video. Lastly, I couldn't help polishing a bit to tail motion but honestly, at this stage it's mostly a waste of time, don't work the tail for the time being since it's ending and following the body, we will work on it during the polishing stage once we have finished the whole motion of the body. What was a little more important here is to rotate around your character, check out all the poses and then fix a bit the pole target to give a better orientation to the knees and also check out the elbow tweaker bones, you can see that my elbows are pointing in word and it doesn't look super natural, so double check each poses and check that the silhouette show character, the shape of the arms of the legs et cetera, looks good from every point of view. In the next video, we will revise the timing of this animation is still in step mode before jumping into spline.

## 03-20-Climb Timing

I will show you a quick method to double-check your timing. First we will check with root motion and then without root motion. I've already made a quick timing pass in the previous video without explaining it, because it wasn't very good. The idea was just to check the follow of the different poses but you don't need to work on timing for this. Now is the timing path before I switch to spline. So to check it, since I have root motion I've kept my root activated, and I will now simply use my quick favorite menu to calculate the motion path of the root bone setting it from frame zero to frame 12. This way I will be able to see the spacing of my root bone between the different poses we have created. And since the root bone is supposed to have a linear motion since we are doing a cycle, I can try to make the spacing match the timing. If we have a loop to the spacing between frame three and frame five, we can see that the position of the root bone hasn't changed that much. It means that since we have a linear interpolation, those two keyframes should be very close, one to the other. So I will offset the frame five onto frame four. Now if I keep this mindset to analyze my spacing I can see that from frame zero to frame one, I have a pretty large spacing and I have the same spacing between frame one and frame three. So I have the same spacing between those two poses or almost the same spacing but the timing is different. The first one is on one frame, the second one on two frames. So I will offset my keyframes from frame three to frame two. So in the end I am animating in those first four poses onwards. And during the polishing stage I will be able to revise a bit the spacing between the different part of the body. From there I can evaluate the distance between the frame seven and the frame 10, and the frame three and the frame seven. And the spacing is quite the same as between frame zero and frame two, so timing-wise I think that I should have two frames between my airborne pose and the contacting poses. So I will move my airborne pose from frame seven to frame five, and then I should be moving frame 10, 11, and 12 on frame seven or frame eight. Again the timing and spacing of the animation will be refined during the polishing stage in spline modes, but this is a good way if you can't feel your timing to check it out. Try to make it logical. And it does show case again that having a detailed blocking can really help the animation process. If you have animated your character without moving the root bone then use the features of your character that are contacting the tree trunk to guess the spacing. When I check the back-right foot of my character, I have the same spacing between frame zero and one and between frame one and three. So I can choose to move the pose number three onto frame number two. And when I see the different of spacing between the current pose and the next one, it's even smaller so this change of position should happen within one frame, even less than one frame so I will move it onto frame three. Then I want my character to float a bit so I will keep in airborne for two frames, for example, I can track the front hands to see the different of spacing between those two frames, and I believe that this airborne position will be the extreme so it will be quite of right in the middle of the jump, so I can move frame 10 and all the next poses onto frame seven. So in the end, during our blocking stage we have created almost a pose for each frame, and this is because we are working on the fast motion animation. And this will happen when you work on combat animation for example, where your character change poses very fast. You can't keep an empty frame if there is a lot movement that happen in this frame, you will have to detail your blocking. The good news here is that it's going to be way easier to polish this animation.

## 03-21-01 Climb cycle - body polish

[Instructor] It's now time to switch to spline and polish our climbing cycle animation and then will be to remove the linear feeling of the cycle and get this hopping motion. So as usual the first thing we will do is select all of our controllers. Then in the action editor, select all the keys. Press the T key and switch to busiest so that we are now in spline mode. You can then press control tab to switch to the graph editor, enable the display all filter, press alt+H to make sure that there is no curve hidden and press shift E to apply the make cycle modifier. Now the animation will be cycling forever. As we have seen in the previous cycle, we need to clean the root spoon, meaning that we want a linear interpolation of the root ball. The first thing to do is to select all the key frames of the root bone and remove all of them but the first and last. Then you can either press the T key and switch to linear interpolation or select all the key frame press the V key, and switch to vector handles. This way we will also have a linear interpolation. To enable the linear extrapolation, we first need to get rid of the cyclic modifier. Select all the keys of the root bone press shift E clear cyclic modifier. Then press shift E again, and choose linear extrapolation. Now our character will be moving forward in a linear fashion. At this stage, you probably have some foot sliding and that's perfectly normal. We will fix and place the feet later on. As explained in the beginning of this video, the big deal here will be to get rid of the linear feeling of the motion. All contacting frames for the feet will still be linear. Also the root motion will be linear. So we need to play with the body, the chest of our character, to input some hopping and contrast into this climbing animation. As usual, I'm working with the main controller of the body. I will start with the location channels first. And while I generally start with the Z location channel, the up and down, here I will start with the Y location channel because since our character is rotated upward, the Y rotation channel kind of become the up and down channel. And this is the one where we must input as much contrast as possible. So the first thing I had done was to push the pause. Push the Y value higher so that the character is pushing backward more. Since we are working on the cycle, I make sure that I always duplicate the first key frame and move it onto the last key frame. To bring contrast to the motion, the thing to avoid is to create a perfect sinusoidal shape. This is why I have almost a plateau between frame zero and one. And I will also push from eight to slightly higher. This way I'm pulling my character back upon eight frame. And then I transition forward on the other frames. I can even increase the contrast by lowering the value of the curve on frame three. In the end, we get the fast variation from frame two to frame four, then some kind of lower plateau and then it transitions smoothly to frame nine. And these back and forth motion will be amplified by the back and forth motion of the chest, head, and hips. Regarding the Z location curve, the amplitude of the motion is more subtle. I'm mainly cleaning the shape of the curve so that it's a little smoother. And don't forget that when your character is pushing forward his body is getting closer to the tree trunk. So he's losing altitude. And when he's grabbing back the tree trunk then he's getting more altitude. At some point, I flattened the curve to make sure that the belly of the character wasn't clipping with the surface of the tree trunk. For the X location channel, I just got rid off any variation by flattening the curve. I will input a little bit of twisting on the chest of the character in the final stage of the polishing. The rotation motion is also pretty subtle. As usual, I'll start with the X rotation because it's the most influential. And I've mainly been polishing the curve, making it smoother, and making sure that the character is diving down into the jump. As you go along again don't forget to duplicate your frames in row on your last frame. And don't forget that when you're ready to curve you might be going back onto it whenever you are polishing other controllers, because everything is connected. So modifying the torse now might quite have changed the behavior of the chest, of the head, et cetera. And when you're polishing a specific part of the character don't forget to isolate it to check the motion this way you will get rid of all the visual noise and will get something more readable. The animation now looks less linear than before, and I'm slowly getting the "oomph" of the pushing of the character. Another way to see it is obviously to calculate the motion path of the main controller of the body. And from there, we can clearly see that the spacing is getting bigger whenever our character is pushing forward on this straight line. And then I have a tighter spacing. The character body is kind of slowing down in space. Whenever it's catching up. I can now switch to the chest controller. I'm first clearing the motion path from the main controller to have a cleaner workspace. And as I oftenly do with the chest controller, I will work first on the X quaternion rotation channel. I won't be polishing the Y and Z quaternion on rotation yet. This is something I will do at the very end of the polishing stage, based on the contact pose of the feet. To get a better readability of what I'm doing, I will select the neck bone and calculate the motion path. The neck controller is directly attached to the chest. It makes this motion path relevant. The idea here is to emphasize the previous motion we have created with the main body controller, making sure that our character is kind of sliding along the tree trunk. And making sure we emphasize the pushing motion. If we watch the final cycle again, just check the distance between the hips connection and the shoulder connection. This way we can clearly see how I stretched the body of the character to show that he's curling his whole body using his shoulders and his chest. And this is something I've achieved by reworking the Y and Z location curve. I advise you to work on both curves at the same time time because we are working on the chest controller which is a child of the main controller. So we are working on local space so you will need to play on both curves to get a straight motion. The Y location curve will have the main influence on this animation. I have, I can trust that frame zero to three, this is the pushing motion or pulling motion as you wish, where the body is stretching. Then as the character is airborne the main body is slowly catching up with the chest. So I'm reducing the stretching by lowering slightly the curve. And finally, we have a more radical squishing or compression of the chest when our character is contacting with the tree trunk. And I get a fast modification of the curve value. The Z curve is mainly here to correct the orientation of the chest. Finally, I flattened the X location curve because I don't want the chest to move left to right yet. Next I've placed the head controller. So it's a pretty classic workflow again. And the curve editing from the head will be very close to what I just did for the chest. As I always do whenever I'm tracking head, I will use the nose controller to calculate the motion path. The idea, as usual, is to keep our arc as smooth as possible. Again, I'm starting by working on the X, what's our normal rotation of the character. The idea is to make the head slightly diving or dragging into the jump forward. But as explained during the run cycle I try to avoid too much rotation because I don't want the head to wobble up and down. This will communicate a lack of control from our character. And since he's very light and agile, we don't want this. I play on the Y and Z location curve early on because I do want to get this compression and stretching of the head as soon as possible. And I'm using the X quaternion rotation to fix the arc of the nose. In the end, I get almost the same curve as for the chest but with one frame of offset. In the end, I was going back and forth onto the head and the chest controller to get rid of this little glitch on the motion path of the nose. Since I have a bit of physics lag on the last frame of the motion path, I spend some time on the three last frames to try to smooth this out. Then I add the loop to my animation in front view. And I saw that I got a slight rotation left to right on the motion path of the nose. So I've made a first pass of polishing onto the chest and the head rotation on the left and right axis, the Z quaternion rotation. Those are very subtle modification. I've kept the curve pretty smooth. And the idea is to rotate the torso toward the contacting point. And when the character is pushing, for example, with his right hand, you push the chest in the other direction, in the opposite direction. So when he's contacting with the right hand, you push the chest toward the right hand. And when the hand this pushing, or pulling in this case, to get up there, the chest is getting moved away from the hand, just make it super subtle and keep the curve as smooth as possible. On this specific animation, the hips are very important. Hips controller is generally something you have to spend time on because it really defines the way a character is contacting with the ground. The way he's gathering energy, pushing and pulling his body off the contact surface. Think of the hips as a catapult for the legs. Starting with the X rotation curve I will make sure that when the character is projecting his leg backward, I have a very aggressive motion of the hips. And I tried to push the curve as much as possible sometime it kinds of look weird so I will tune it down a bit. But I want really to push the paws as far as possible because we do need to see this rotation of the hips backward whenever the character is pushing. And then when our character is contacting with the ground, the hips are really rotating inward toward the contacting frame. And these very contrasted motion does translate on the curve. You can see that the curve goes down and up pretty quickly. The next channel will obviously be the Y and Z location curves. We have already seen our squash and stretch was important into this animation. So I will just emphasize this. And then we do need an offset between the stretching and squashing of the hips compared to the chest. The hips are dragging backwards. So on the first two to three frames the hips are kind of squashed. And as our character is jumping, they get stretched a lot and they will slowly catch up during the airborne position but mostly on the contact frame. The hips curves shape are slightly smoother than the chest and the head because since the head and chest are leading the animation this is where we need to bring the most contrast. And as the hips are kind of following, are dragging and catching up, we can give them a slightly smooth curve. They are kind of following the main body controller chest and head motion. With have the whole body of how our character polished the animation does look way better already. So in the next video you will have a full time lapse of this polishing stage and then we'll start polishing the legs in the next video.

## 03-21-03 Climb cycle - Feet polish

As the body is now polished, I can work on the feet of the character. Will start with the back legs since they move the most. First thing is to fix the Y location curve on the contact pose. Now I have a proper linear root motion switch all the angles of the contact frame of the feet to vector, get rid of any intermediate frame, and tweak the value before the foot take off to make sure that I don't have any sliding effect. Since the leg looks too overextended on frame three, I've decided it will be the take off frame. From the side view I worked mainly on the Y location and then the Z location. As for a run cycle, I don't push too much the foot away from the tree trunk. And forget that our character is pushing toward the sky is not pushing against the tree trunk. If he does, he would fall. So from the current point of view, it's better to push the pose of the foot downward, than pushing it on the left side. And when you reach the end of the cycle, make sure that again the contact pose are in vector, then I'm fixing any sliding issue by moving the frame eight. Because if I was moving the value of frame nine, then I would have to duplicate this value of frame zero since this is the latest frame, it would break the fix I did in the beginning of the video between frame zero and frame two. Because the value difference between frame two and frame zero will change. Regarding the X location axis, what I've done is that as the leg is taking off, it will be pushing slightly inward and then as it comes forward, it will move on this side, as if the character was going to embrace the tree trunk. This is something I will try to do on both the hands and the feet of the character. Because as you climb the tree trunk you're trying to bind the trunk to your body in a way But we do need to feel that there is a side to side force being applied onto the tree trunk. And the larger the tree trunk, the wider our character will open his arms. As usual when I'm done with the location curve, I can work with my rotation curve. When the foot is taking off, I make sure that I have a fast rotation back one, so that we can feel that the foot has just pushed, and is kind of wiping in the air And then as it catch up, I will just make the tip of the foot dragging So I will use the rotation to do this. Then I have my impact frame where I want to open the foot just before it lands on the surface , on the reference, we can barely see, that the character is currently grabbing the tree trunk with his toes. But our rig definition doesn't allow us to do this. So what I did is I just created a slight foot slap as we did for the run cycle, landing on the foot bone and then flapping the toes against the tree trunk. I have used exactly the same process for the left foot. First make sure that you don't have any sliding effect Fixing the Y location on frame zero until the frame where the foot take off and repeat the process on the frame, where the foot is contacting the tree trunk until the end of the cycle If you want to push the pause favorize the Y location because the Z location will take the foot thunder away from the tree trunk, and it won't match a climbing locomotion. Then don't forget to work on the X location curve Spreading the leg on the side as the character is pulling it up before the contact pose, so that we feel that the character is catching the tree trunk, not simply contacting with it, but really grabbing the tree trunk. And the final important detail here, is to avoid twinning. I've made both feet contacting the tree trunk at the same time and that's fine, because we have very few frames on the cycle. But whether you're looking from the side view or from the front view, you can see that my feet are never aligned. Once the feet are polished, you can rip onto the pole controllers. They will allow us to fix the orientation of the knees. I won't be using the graffiti for this I will just check frame by frame and move the pole target if needed. The idea is to push the knees inward while our character is pushing, And then reopen the legs as he's pulling his feet apart. For example here I add a bit of a glitch in the motion of the knee where I have a big modification of the shape of the leg. I'm just looking at the shape of the legs, and moving the pole target, so that I get a smoother motion of the knee I will apply exactly the same process for the left leg. When you are done with the pole targets, use the tweaker controller. To avoid any reversed bending like this one. Just scrub frame by frame, and fix any weird the shape of the knees. In the end, I think I just needed to fix a couple of poses. Once I was done with the back leg, I've worked with the ends of front leg of the character, I've used exactly the same process. First fixed the Y location to avoid any sliding avoid to make too big change on the Z location, and made the hands getting too far away from the tree trunk. You will see in the next video in the full time lapse that I've initially really widely open the arms using the X location, and then I've tightened them because it was looking a bit too weird. Just remember that it's perfectly fine to revise your poses during the polishing stage. I've initially posed the four arms to be very tight to the body and in the end using the x axis, I've spread them on the sides Forget to break the twinning also on the arms. And when you are done polishing the arms controller, you can use the joint controller to fix the position of the elbows. Again for this process, it's better to do it frame by frame. Just make sure that your elbow is bending in the right way. So don't forget to rotate around your character and you will be done. The next video will be a time lapse of all the points we've just seen. And in the video after, I will change the timing of the animation, because I wasn't satisfied of what I add here. Don't worry, it's not a big deal. It will take only few minutes but it will really improve the animation

## 03-21-05 Climb cycle - re-timing

[Instructor] And you work on an animation and get back to it with fresh eyes, it's pretty common to have a less satisfying feeling about what you are seeing. And I was feeling that the animation was too fast. I wanted to show more the effort made by the character to climb the tree. Bring more contrast, I need to make the cycle a bit less linear, and add some Hold on one pose. And I wanted to add one frame into the elbow and pose. Why I got back to the action in it all, I can select the frame of five to nine and offset them by one frame. Then it instantly feels better, because we have this moment where the character is clearly squashing together energy and then is holding a beat in the air with its stretched pose. And this little contrast in the timing and the shape of the character make it feels better. And since our animation was very detailed, meaning that we almost have a key frame on each frame, the offset looks almost okay. So the first step is to revise in sliding issue since we have increased the animation by one frame, and we still have a linear interpolation of the bone. To fix the speed at which the feet of our character are sliding on the tree trunk, we just need to slightly adjust the value of the Y location of each feet of the character using the same method as before, just make sure that the first key frame and the last key frame are the same. And you can use the 3D cursor as a marker to know where the foot is during the motion. Most of the work is just about going through every controller you have already polished and kind of slightly fixed the curve. Honestly, that's very fast. It took me like 20 minutes to fix the whole character, because the pose we have chosen to be extended a bit in time is kind of a hold in the air where the motion of the character, the pose of the character doesn't change that much. So I'm slightly rotating the curve and the angles just to get a nice and smooth curve. In the end, adding this little frame really helps also polishing the foot and getting a better motion path. The previous version of the animation was good, but this time adding this little detail, this little more range to work on really helped smoothing out the whole animation and contrasting the strength put into it by our character. You can watch the whole process in the next time lapse video. I will see you in the video after, where we will add all the secondary motion like the ears the nose and also polish the tail.

## 03-21-07 Climb cycle - Tail and details

[Instructor] This is the final video of this climbing animation. It is now time to polish our tail motion, so I will start with the root of the tail. There are a couple things you have to think of. First of all, our character is climbing vertically. It's the tail has weight, it should be hanging a bit downward. Plus, since our character has a vertical momentum. The tail should also drag in the opposite direction. As usual, I'm starting to work on the X rotation curve. The idea is to avoid any big flapping motion because of the twin formation we have seen before. The root of the tail is moving in reaction of the hips motion. As the hips are raising from frame zero to frame five to tail is going the opposite direction with one frame of delay. From there I just need to polish the curve, make sure that the frame and that I get a smooth transition between frame eight to frame 10. This nice change in the curve shape from frame one to frame three, supports the drastic change in the hips pose while the character is pushing. From there I will work on the next joint in reaction from the first joint. So you can see that my curve is pretty noisy because I've tried to make this animation during the blocking stage. So don't be afraid to destroy everything and reshape the motion. In the end the curve of the second joint will look like the curve of the first joint. But with a bit of delay maybe one frame and a smoother shape. Cause the further we get from the roots of the tail, the more absorption of the heaps motion we will add. Since we are rebuilding the whole tail motion, I can get treated off any of the next joint motion because they are currently disturbing. I can get treated of the intermediate key frame for the two controllers or the tip of the tail. So that it stays straight and I have less difficulties reading the motion of the tail. As soon as I get a satisfying motion, I make sure that the cycle is transitioning properly and I can jump on the next joint. Can now rework the motion of the next joint by simply duplicating the first key frame and reshaping the curve at will based on the motion of the previous joint. It's pretty straightforward. The idea is to create a slight waviness in the tail motion. So if you want to create a nice tail motion for this animation, make sure that the root of the tail is moving properly. And then you just create this animation fall off along the way. From there we can start working on this Z axis for the left to right motion of the tail. It's the same process as for the previous motion but we'll keep it a little more subtle this time. Since I'm rebuilding this motion, I will get rid of all the existing key frames and will start by duplicating the first key Based on the hips motion of the character I will create the follow-through when the hips are going right I will decide to rotate the tail to the left to create the dragging motion of follow through. Usually I make sure that frame zero and frame 10 are the same and that they are align are transitioning smoothly with the next key frames. I will then repeat the process on the other joints. As usual, you can see the full process in the time-lapse video. So the finer parts of this animation is to work on all the secondary details like the ears, eyes and nose tip. I will use the straightforward method meaning that I will be animating along the way. With both ears controllers selected, I will get rid all the key frames between frame zero and frame 10 Two thing we have to think of. The first one is to avoid twinning. That's why I pulled the bit back the right ear from the side view, so that when we read the silhouette our character. We can see both ears. And the second thing is to keep the ears a little back since our character is coming verticality the ears of a bit of weight. So they are pointing downward and the momentum make them also drag a bit backwards. So when you enter the follow-through path whenever the car car is contacting with the ground and the ears are moving forward. Don't push them too far forward. On some with those base poses, I can slightly polish the curve. Don't forget that you are working on the cycle. So you need the curve to transition properly from one cycle to the other. This is why I was missing the keys. I will also offset the motion of the ears by one key frame by duplicating the first key frame onto frame one. And then I rework my transition, rotate my keys, duplicate them. So that frame zero one frame 10 are the same. Do the same on the Z rotation and Y rotation even if the interference is very subtle. I want to avoid any glitches in the motion. We need smooth transition from one cycle to the other. Then I worked on the eyes. The idea is not to create an eye blink as explained before. You should not make your characters blink during a cycle, because it will look super repetitive. It is to add subtle follow through animation by slightly closing the eyes while the head is going up. Here I don't care about twinning since both eye I will barely be seen at the same time. So I can work on both curve at the same time. To tackle the nose motion as I did for the ears. Animating with with the straightforward method. Making it drag based on the head motion, then make sure that the curve transition properly during the cycle. And this is the final touch to this climbing cycle animation. To make sure that our cycle is properly made. I will display all the controllers curve with the show hidden filter enabled. Don't forget to press Alt+H on top of this to make sure that you unhide every curves. Then I make sure that the root channels are disabled because they are not using a cycle modifier, but linear extrapolation. Then they will select all the keys on frame zero, press V and switch the Handle Type to free. As explained before with this Handle Type the current key frames are no longer influenced by the next or previous key frame. So from there I can duplicate them and move them on Frame 10 and I'm sure that the handle orientation won't be changed. This is a guarantee that your animation will cycle perfectly. This is the last animation we have to create of this character. Congratulation if you got so far, if not don't give up and rework your animation. The next video will be a time-lapse of what we have just seen. And then I will show you all we can combine all the action we have created with our character into the NLA editor.

## 03-22 The NLA editor

[Instructor] Before we start working with the NLA editor, we need to clean up our character animations. First get back to object mode, get rid of the cylinder, select our character rig in object mode and press Alt+G Alt+R Alt+S. On the current claiming action, reactivate the roots motion. And for all our animation we need to get rid of any animation of the root boom. So I will switch to show only selected and then with my root boom selected I will get rid of the last key frame. I will press CTRLl+Tab to switch back to the action editor, open the temporary action I created for the idle animation, hold shift and click on the cross icon to close the action. Holding Shift will remove the action from the file. Now the closed action as zero users. And when I will rebuild the file it will be removed from our action library. I will also make sure that I have no root motion on my idle animation and Alt+G Alt+R and Alt+S to reset the position of the roots. Then I get rid of all the other key frames of the root. I will do the same for the run cycle making sure that my character is cycling on position without any root motion and remove all the temporary actions. In the end I only kept the keying, the run cycle, the idle and the climbing cycle. All the other action have no users. Hence the zero in front of their name. Now I can go to file, click revert, it will reload the current file and the zero users action have disappeared. From there, I can double check each actions and if you want to make it even cleaner, you can duplicate the first key of the route and move it onto the very last key of the animation. This is not necessary. So don't do it if you don't want. So let's get started with the NLA editor. So, I will push a bit my action eight window, expand the timeline and switch to the NLA editor. By default, you will find out an NLA track for each of the object you have in your scene. So we can see a track for our squirrel mesh object that also include a track for the shape key used to animate the eyes and a track for our squirrel rig, including a track called keying because we have our keying action opened in the keying editor. Most of the shortcuts and filters are the same as in the graph editor and the action editor, so I won't go over them again. Since I'm working only on the rig, I will click the show selected only. If I open the different actions in the action editor, I will see them appearing onto the track of the NLA editor. But I can't use them in the NLA editor this way. To use them in the NLA editor track, I need to convert them to strip by clicking this icon or click the same icon in the action editor and push down the action into the track, converting it to a strip. Think now of your action as an audio or video strip that you can move in time using the G key as you will do in a DVD auditor. In the action editor near the push down, there is another button called stash. This is something I never use but I will show you what it's made for. If I click it, it will create a new NLA track with a new strip idle finished. The NLA track is locked and disabled, so it does no influence on our character rig. It is basically here to replace the fake user we create when we click on the shield icon in the action editor. If I remove the fake user from my idle finish and close the action or open another one and save the file. When they will revert or reload my document, the idle action is still there because the NLA track is considered being a user. That's why we have two users whenever we are opening the action in the action editor. But I think it makes the NLA editor messy having all those additional tracks. So I prefer to protect my animation using the fake chooser and getting rid of the track by simply selecting it and pressing the X key. If I select the run cycle strip and press the Tab key, the trip will turn to green meaning that the current action is in edit mode and I can see the action loaded in the action editor. I will close the idle action in the action editor so that we only have our current NLA track available. If I press shift+D, I can duplicate the strip. And if I press Alt+D, I can make a link to duplicate as we will do with any object in the 3D viewport. So as for an object, you can consider this strip as a container. So if I press N or I click the arrow icon to expand the properties panel, going into the strip tab, I can see where the current trip starts and ends among a lot of different options that we will be covering in a few minutes. But also the action used, the same way will add with a mesh object, the object is a container and we have meshed data. So we can see that the third strip is using a new run cycle action with the suffix tag 002. The second one, another action and the first one, our original action. When I press Tab to enter edit mode and modifying the current action, we can see that the third strip that we have created using the linked duplicate action is colored in red. I will make a quick modification to the action. I will then go back into the NLA editor and press the Tab key and I can see that I am playing the modified animation. But if I scrub over the second strip, we can see that he's playing another animation the ones that hasn't been modified. But if I scrub over the third strip, we can see that it's playing the same action. as for the first one. Since the action are linked, modifying one will modify the other. You can add a new strip to an NLA track by pressing Shift+A and choosing the action. But at least on this version of them they are all at the time I'm recording this video, you have to make sure that your NLA track is active by simply clicking it to select it. I guess it will be cool if blender automatically add a new track if you don't have any tracks selected. In the meantime, just remember this little tip. Let's have a look to the different option available in the NLA editor. When I duplicate NLA strip, by default blender will create another NLA track. Double-clicking on the track will allow you to rename the track. You can reorder the track position by right clicking on it and choosing whatever you want to do or using Page up and Page down or Shift+Page up and Shift Page down. With the idle track selected, I can press Shift+A and select the idle action, it will create a new strip using the idle action. The numerous strip will be created where the play head is positioned. To create a new track, I have to create a new action in the properties panel. By default, the action is empty. So I need to create a key frame on the bone to be able to push it down and add this new track. Or I can simply browse through my action library, choose one and push it down. The huge power of the NLA editor is to allow to combine different actions. As I told you before, I asked you to think of it as video clips. So as my first run cycles comes to an end I should be able to see my idols strip. But nothing happened. And this is because of the extrapolation mode of our first run cycles strip. As it is set to old forward when this strip it's N, it will keep our character in the latest pose or in the latest read key frame of the action containing the strip. This extrapolation is displayed as low Pacitti yellowish background or grayish background when the strip is not selected. Setting the extrapolation mode to nothing will get rid of the old forward and idle animation with play. Sitting the extrapolation mode to hold will work as the hold forward. It will extrapolate the latest pose and it won't allow us to read the idle animation. The subtle difference is that if I choose old forward you can see that the influence of the strip doesn't occur before it but while it will override any strip that comes after and is not on the same NLA track. It wants to override any strip that is available prior to heat. So in the end, it is useful only if you don't have any strip before. You can see that my character is in the run cycle pose while if I choose old forward, it is in the rest pose if it has nothing to read prior to this NLA trip. By default, our blending mode is set to replace. It means that any strip that has these landing mode and is super in the NLA track stack, will replace any other strip on other analytic tracks, exactly as a video editor will work. If I set the blending mode to add, we will get a totally crazy results. And this is because, in the NLA editor the blending mode applies to the keyed value. So in this case, all of our controller that are all keyed in each action are added one on top of the other. So currently, the scaling of one from the first action, is added by the scaling of one on the second action. And it's the same for the location and rotation. This is why we get this crazy Frankenstein transformation of our squirrel character. If I switched to substructure, it will mostly set all the scale to zero. So our characters will disappear. And if I use the multiply blending mode, we won't have any problem with the scaling but the rotation and location is pretty hard to predict. So those blending modes are generally used in very specific cases, but there is one mode that is super useful is to combine mode. If I try to combine the run and the idle it will still look weird but let me prepare something for you. I will push the idle animation away regroup my boyfriend cycle. Then unselect the track, click on the new action and I will simply move my route boom. So I will key its location on frame zero and unframed 24. I will move it by 1.4 meters on the y-axis as we did, when we were doing the run cycle. I will then select those keys make sure that they are into linear interpolation. And now when I play the animation, we can see that the motion of the root is combined with our run cycle. And if I now put the idle at the end of this strip, since I will root locomotion strip is on hold, our squirrel character will stay in place and we will have a perfect blending between the run cycle and the idle animation. So now, just imagine what we could do if I was to edit the locomotion, add a bit of rotation, switch left to right, and then add also a bit of rotation on the root of the body of our character. This way, from a base run cycle, I can input variation into my characters locomotion into his behavior and this can be perfect to rapidly prototype a shot for example or to iterate on different variation of the same animation. You don't really know where your characters are supposed to go, you want to test different poses different animation. That's a good way to do it without reanimating everything. This is why NLA editor is often the compounded to the layers tool in Maya. And they was able to create these variation of our animation in three minutes. So it's not perfect but that's a good pace. To make our life easier, there are also blend in and out options. I will create a new action for our character. It will be a simple rotation of the ed controller that will hold for the whole animation. I will suggest extrapolation to nothing and the blending mode to combine. Now when my character is executing its run cycle he has his head turn towards us. The blend in and out option are pretty straightforward. If I add the 10 frame on the blend in, it will take 10 frames before our character as his head turned. And the blend out will work the same whatever the value I will put in the blend out it will these number of frame to reset to his initial posts. It's like playing with the influence of the head rotation track. And since the influence is a value, we can animate this influence. So I will set it to zero on the first frame and to zero on frame 24. Open the graph editor and now I can access to curve of the influence of this layer and create the blending by myself. Within the values that goes from zero to one, I can tell blender how much influence I want this NLA track to have on top of my run cycle. So here it doesn't look like something really beautiful, but that's very handy. Enabling the auto blending will automatically create the blend in and blend out based on the position of the strips on the top track and the bottom track. We can see the influence curve appearing on the blending strip. Here it's blending in, but if I move the ed terms strip before the other strips, it will blend out. Another fantastic feature of the NLA editor is to be able to manipulate time. If I select my run cycles strip and press S to scale, the strip will be currently scaled from the play head and it will basically affect the frame start and frame end. Doubling the size of this strip will play the action twice slower. If I increase it to 44 frames for example, I will almost be playing it in a slow motion four times slower than the original animation. So that's a fantastic tool if you want to create slow motion effects. If I make this three plank shorter then the animation will be accelerated. The reversed option will simply play the current animation in reverse. I've made some research and some experience with the cyclic strips time and I absolutely don't know what it's made for. If I change the length of the action clip, it will automatically change the length of the active strip. And since we have a cycle modifier on our curve, our animation is repeating even beyond the frame 12 but we can make the animation repeating by simply increasing the repeat value. Even if I go into the graffiti task select all my key and clear the cyclic modifier, the animation will be repeating, so it will be cycling. If I shorten the action clip not the strip the action clip, then the action won't be played entirely. Pressing the Y key will split the active strip where the play ed is positioned. The thing cyclic option will automatically reset the wrench of the action clip based on the first and last key frame within the action. If you modify the action length within the action and edit all through the tweaking, then clicking this button or enabling cyclic, will automatically reset the wrench of the action clip. One of the super cool feature of the NLA editor is to be able to animate the strip time. I have made my actions clip longer, I will enable the animated strips time and insert a key frame. Now in my graffiti tall, I have a new curve available. I will duplicate the created key frame and move it on frame 12 and it's value I will input 12 and switch everything to vector. It basically means that I have created a curve that treated 12 frame over So my animation is playing at real time. Now, if I offset value, it will play at a slower time. I think a curve that allow us to modify the speed at which we are reading an action into a strip, will allow us to create incredible slow motion. So instead of scaling the whole strip, I can choose whenever I want my action to be played at real time or to dance slow down. And if I reduce the value of the curve, I can even play the action in reverse. You can create tracer overwatch effects, super easily with this kind of thing. This is why the NLA editor should we not be overlooked. Because even if you want to use those everyday, it can owe you to do tons of thing with a lot of ease and with incredible results. There's a last couple of things I'd like to show you in this video. Pressing Shift+T will all you to add a transition strip, but you need to have two active strip selected. It will create a strip that will automatically blend one action to the other creating a linear interpolation. You can add those strip through the ad menu. If you are using speakers in your 3D scene to play sound, then you can add sound strip, pressing the Shift+K shortcut, or going to the ad menu. You can group multiple actions strip pressing CTRL+G allowing you to manipulate them all at ons and you can ungroup them pressing Ctrl+Alt+G. To summarize, we have seen that the NLA editors allows us to combine multiple strips as if we where working on the video editor. We need to push an action to make it an NLA strip. The stash option can be used to replace the fake user. We can duplicate, clone or add an action as a strip into the track. We can use extrapolation and blending options to combine different strip on different tracks. Action in the NLA tracks affect only the keyed channels. You can blend multiples strips from different tracks together. Scaling this trip will accelerate or slow down the bound action. You can split a strip pressing the Y key. You can edit the timing of an animation using the curve. You can create transition strips with shift+T and finally you can group or ungroup strips with Ctrl+G and Ctrl+Alt+G.

## 03-23 Preproduction and staging

[Instructor] Before we learn all the technique to create the different shots from the first course teaser, I would like to talk a bit about how to plan this kind of production. Gives you a couple of tricks that are important regarding staging. You generally start this kind of production with a script, a story to tell. The script will include the story and description of the character and what happens or you tell this story. And while a part of the team will work on the concept art to define the art style of the film, you as an animator will generally be provided with a storyboard. I'll teach you how create a storyboard because this isn't something I usually do. But depending on the scale of the studio you're working in whether you're working alone or in the big team you will find the storyboard artists or you'll be in charge of doing the storyboard yourself. The storyboard shows how the picture has to be framed. The key moment or beats of the animation, and information about the character movement and the camera movement. Just imagine it as being a comic, all the different picture of the same size that chooses the size of the camera and that explain what will happen in your movie or in your shot. By reading the script and seeing the storyboard anyone should be able to figure what's going to happen and what the movie will look like. The storyboard is validated. You can switch to creating an animatic it's a shot with music and sound. That will include the drawing from the storyboard but with the right timing though you can consider this as being an animated storyboard. Depending on your projection level and style there might be other steps like pre visualization but with those element you are generally good to go into animating your shots. A good shot or a good animation depends on the staging. Staging is one of the 12 principles of animation. Staging is the presentation of any idea in your shot. It includes a lot of different concept but to keep it simple, think of it as making the action clear and understandable. So it includes everything about your animation whether it's the character movement, what he's saying if it's a character speaking but also the way you move the camera, you frame everything. If we take the example of our shot, we can immediately understand that we are in the forest. To guide the viewer that something will happen in this specific bush, I've made it shaking a bit. We have also animated our character turning his head in here, and then there is this anticipation before it goes away. The other example is this trailer for the game Nora I've made in 2018. The first thing we want to say is that we are underwater and we wanna make it a bit mystical with those luminous and seaweed. As we go through the surface, we can see those quality of drops on the camera lens selling that we were into the water. While we could have used the crab for appeal only this character is used for scaling purpose. This way we can understand that he's on a pretty big rock and what will appear beyond it is even bigger. Staging is also about composition. Every shapes tend to drive the eye toward the center sphere and on top of this, this is also the element with the brightest color and the strongest contrast. So basically when you are building a shot ask yourself all those questions. Does the composition read well? Do the audience know where the animation takes place and if it matters?, Do we understand the character motion and feeling? And do we understand what is going to happen? One last example here, this character have a very slow breathing motion and very slow motion in general, that tells that he is very big. Also the composition with this pyramid double shape shows that he's an important character. He's currently the King, and we can see that the light is also supporting this. Now look at the anticipation on the next move. His whole body is moving to raise his fist, again supporting the fact that the character is very big and probably very strong. And it also give a visual anticipation on the transition toward the next shot. The fingers are shaking communicating anger and strength and the shuttering rocks just to confirm this. It's now over loop two hours quilt or shot. I want to give you some tips and some pitfall you should avoid. First try to keep your camera move as realistic as possible as if it was a physical camera in the real world and we will talk about camera in the next video. The second thing about camera motion is to avoid anticipation. Here the bush moved first, and then I rotate the camera. So you have to think that the camera is catching up with the action. It's not predicting the action. So when our character is jumping out of the bush it's like the offset is not centered in the shot and then the camera catch up and center it as being the focus point. Another very important thing regarding the readability of your animation is to make sure that when you switch from one shot to the other there is a continuity in the motion of your character. If we have a look to the transition between the first and second shot, the character is disappearing behind the bush, he's into a lending motion. So we can think that during this transition where he's hidden behind the bush he's bouncing or jumping another time, and when he finally reappear to the camera is currently how ball making the transition between the two shots seamless. On the next one I used a fading between the two shots. We generally use these to tell the audience that we are changing off environments where the animation takes place or that sometime has elapsed. And this is what I wanted to communicate here. And you can see that there is a slight difference of lightning between the previews and current composition as if we were getting closer to a sunset. The color are slightly more orangy. Another thing about this shot is that I make the birds appearing once our character has got through the shot. As he's in the background if the bird were appearing first, that will create a lot of visual noise and we would lose the focus on our character. But they've added those birds on purpose. Once our character is disappearing, it tells me to bring some appeal and keep this shot for a little while. So is that when I transition to the last shot we have the feeling that the character had the time to climb the tree and go on the current branch. Finally here, both the composition and the direction the birds are flying focus our attention toward the sun and the logo cross this line. So while this course will focus on the animation of our character, the anticipation in the way our character move also serve the staging. And if your goal is to create your own shots films for example, staging is very important. It's like any form of art. It's about composition, rhythm, mood, sound why I put something here and not there. Staging is here to support the idea to make it as clear as possible. To summarize, we have seen that staging is about clarity of your shot. Your character behavior is part of the staging whether it's through anticipation, his mood or whatever he has to communicate the idea behind the shot. Composition, camera movement, and lighting are very important to make things clear both your thought to guide the eyes of your audience. Unless it's done on purpose, try to think of your camera shot as if it was enrolled by a real human being or using real world constraints. If you are working on multiple shot make sure that your transition makes sense. Blend the motion from one shot to the other or use transition whenever you are switching space or switching time. Don't forget it's a creative process so don't be afraid to experiment. And when you are working on big project don't forget to write a script, create a storyboard or even create an animatic. In the next video, we will talk about the camera so that you can create your first shot.

## 03-24-The camera

[Pierre] In this video, we will see how Blender's camera work and how to use it. I've created a little scene including a camera that we can find also in the outliner. To switch back into camera view, you just have to press zero on the numpad. We can find our camera object, named the camera, and the camera properties in the properties editor. You can place the camera by moving it and rotating it as you will do with any other object. Or you can frame the view in the 3D viewport and press Control + Alt + zero so that the camera view will match your current custom view. The camera format is on the output size of your document. Basically the ratio of the output image. between its width and it's height, the resolution doesn't matter, only the ratio matter. There are different camera type. By default, the camera type will be set to perspective and the output is the same as in the perspective view. If we switch to autographic, the autographic scale will allow you to zoom in and out. You can't zoom by moving the camera. Using cycle, you can also switch to panoramic. It won't be supported in Evi, because you need ray tracing. It allows you to do a free ideal for VR experiences or to create your own HDRi. With the prospective camera, playing with the focal length will allow you to zoom in and out. The longer the focal length, the more zoomed will be your picture. And the more compressed will be the perspective, meaning that you will get closer and closer to an autographic view. The smaller the focal length, the wider will be your angle of view, or less zoomed, and you will create a lot of distortion in the perspective. You can shift the camera frame on the X and Y axis. It doesn't exactly behave as a rotation. It's currently of setting the position of the camera on the left of the right, but we keep the same perspective as when we are framing the center of the view. I personally never used this option. To better understand clipping, I will go into the viewport display and enable limits. A line appear in our 3D viewport, showing these limits. This limit line show us the clipping distance. If I increase the clipping start, it will move away the first polygon that is rendered by the camera and we can see the limit line updating in our 3D view. On the other end, changing the end value will change how far a can be from the camera and being rendered. As you may know, computers, don't like infinity and we can't render an image with an infinite depth. The calculation would never end. Real camera have a physical sensor that allow them to capture the image. But with our virtual camera, the only thing we have to know is that the zoom or angle view is a ratio between the focal length and the sensor size. So basically you may never change this value and only play with the focal length. You may not need to use the safe area that much. When enabled, you will see frame appearing in your camera view. They were origin only here to fit different screen sizes. All TV may not have the same image ratio and sometime the image was clipped. So you could use this to set the limit between what could be cut and what is currently in frame. But now most of our screen do compensate the screen differences. But they are still great if you want to set a title, for example, in your frame or if you want to add subtitle, knowing that a part of the picture will be occluded by the subtitle and making sure that you keep all the focal points inside the inner frames. You can add the background image as you will do in the 3D viewport. And under viewpoint display, you can display a lot of information regarding your camera. We can already see our creeping range, but we will also be able to enable the limit of the mist. It's currently overlaid upon the limit, so it's a bit hard to see, but we'll see it better just after. The mist pass is to be used in the compositing. So to be able to access it, you have to go to the render layers and enable it. Then we need to render our picture. It will generate a black and white picture, the black being the closer to the camera and the white the further away. Any rendered value closer to camera and the start limit will be black, any rendered value beyond the end value of the limit will be white. This is a path very useful to give depth to your render, creating atmospherical perspective, like fog for example. To change its limit, you have to have it enabled in the layer and then go to the world properties and go in the mist path tab. Here, you will Find the option to change the limits and also the falloff behavior. The sensor will display the focal point of the camera, so we'll see that a little later. The name option will display the name of the camera just under the camera view. The passepartout option will allow you to increase the opacity of the passepartout to currently occlude what's outside of the camera. When working on the shot, I advise you to double check it with the passepartout alpha set to one. Because the fact that you see beyond the boundaries of the camera is misleading. It seems that the composition is wider or more open and you can anticipate what's outside of what you're framing. And so you are mentally anticipating the motion of your character or where he's going and what is going to be in the camera shot, which in the end, won't be displayed in the current shots you are filming. In the previous video, I've explained you how composition was important, how you have to try to give sense to everything you're doing. In this regard, composition guides are super useful. You would find several of them are related to different composition theory, like the golden ratio. So if you have studied composition through hub, for example, you won't be lost. If you're not that used to it, just use the third, it's the most important thing. Make sure that the important part of your shot are inside the third or aligned with them. For example, I'm aligning the head of my character with the top right third, and he's looking toward deep open third. If I move him on the other side, we still have a focus on him but that fact that he's looking at the closed side of the camera leads your audience to watch outside of the frame. And unless this is an artistic choice it doesn't look great that much. So what we can do is just rotate the character and keep him aligned on those third, but it will look at the other side of the screen on the open side, and then offset this fear on the foreground because it's occluding the first third. And so it becomes a point of interest while it might not be something very interesting, unless your character is watching it for example. But simply moving it on the side make the competition a little better. Composition in itself is a big topic and will deserve a whole course. But you can start with those simple rules to make opening compositions. Let's now have a look to depth of field. When activated, you might not see the different away. What you have to know first is that Blender is currently focusing on this target and we can move it directly in the 3D viewport by left clicking and dragging or changing the focus distance here. Using the eyedropper, you can also select an object, asking lender to keep it in focus. To make it clearer, let's reduce the f-stop to 0.1. This will make our picture way more blurry and we can see that even if I move the camera or I move the sphere, Blender will keep the sphere in focus meaning that it won't be blurred while everything else around it gets blurry. If I want to select another object to focus on I can select it through the menu. If I select the ground, you can see that the focus point is aligned with the origin of the ground object. Not the whole object is in focus. This is a pretty important information. Blender will use the origin of any object that is used as a focus object. Finally, you can copy the name of the object you want to focus on and hovering over the focus object slot, press Control + V. Let's talk a bit about the f-stop. Here I'm focusing on the first sphere so we can see the cube on the left is perfectly in focus. If I now move away the focus point we can see that the next cube is in focus. I will get back to the previous and we can see it's back in focus. Increasing the f-stop will visually reduce the noise, but it's not about this. The f-stop value is the range of what is in focus. The higher f-stop value, the higher the range from the focus point will be in focus. Plus the further away is the focal point from the camera, the larger will be the focus area. To give you an example, if I use the same f-stop value and I focus on the very first cube, I might add two cube in focus. While if I focus on a cube that is further away I might have four or five or six cube in focus. So the focus range gets bigger, the further away the focus point is. The other concern is that the depth of field is based on a distance. So depending on the scale of your scene, the blur effect behavior might look different and you may have to play with a bigger range of f-stop value to see a difference in the blur. It's pretty common to rig cameras with simple objects. Adding an empty, parenting the camera to the empty and make the empty rotate to create a turntable, for example. Another common technique is to use an empty and make the camera through constraint, tracking this empty. This way you can move the camera in space and it will keep focus on whatever you are looking at. It makes the camera easier to handle and also animating the camera a bit easier. But there is an issue. As we are using multiple objects, if I insert a key frame on those both empty to create some kind of fancy camera motion, I will have two different action, one per empty. And if I start animating the properties of the camera like the focal length, it will create even another animation or action just for those properties. Then modifying the camera animation will be a pain because I will have to update different actions. Fortunately, Blender comes with a built-in add on that will greatly help you. If you go to edit preferences and go to the add on tab, search for camera and activate the add camera rigs. From there, when you press Shift + A to add the camera, you will have the choice through different camera rigs. The classic camera, the Dolly camera rig and the Crane camera rig. There is also a 2D camera rig that we won't be using in this course. While the Crane camera rig simulates a crane, the Dolly camera rig is very close but there is a little more freedom to it, so we will use this one. The camera rig is very close to our character rig. There is a root bone that allow us to move the whole camera. The aim controller allow us to orientate the camera to this controller. The camera controller allow us to move the camera in space and it will still follow the aim, while the offset will allow us to move the camera in space but it won't rotate toward the aim. And in addition to this, we have all the option of the camera properties that are exposed directly in the rig. So we can animate those properties directly using the rig and it will create only one action that will gather all the emotions of the bone controllers but also all the properties of the camera. So I do advise you to use this rig all the time so that you will get used to it, even for simple project. This way you will get familiar with its mechanism and also some of the feature it has, like this focus point creation. It will bind an empty 2D aim target and the aim target will allow you to rotate the camera but also set the focus distance. To summarize, we have seen that the camera format is based on the output resolution. There on different camera type with perspective and orthographic and even panoramic that allow you to do a You can control the zoom and angle of view with the focal length. You can use the composition guides and the passepartout to better frame your shots. You can control the depth of field using the camera focus distance and the f-stop value. It's highly advised to use a camera rig to animate your camera.

## 03-25-Appending and linking

[Pierre] In this video, we'll see how to append or link our character into a new Blender scene. At the time I'm recording this video, the linking system is still under development. So I will just give you the very basic to be able to input your character in a new scene to create whatever shots you want. You can use two different methods. The first one will be to append our assets. I have a new Blender scene open. I will get rid of everything, go to File, Append. From there, I can search into the file folder for the final squirrel file. Blender files are containers, and as soon as I will select it, a bunch of folders will appear. You can contender the blend file as zipped file. You will find a hierarchy of folders containing all the assets you have in your original Blender file. Wherever it's your mesh data, the scene options, the materials, the world, et cetera. And it also includes the collection. So if I click my collection and import my squirrel collection, Blender will append the squirrel collection including the squeal object and the armature. And it will also append everything used by this collection whether it's the material of our squirrel or the widget object I've used to create the rig. So I can select all of those objects in the collection and in the 3D viewport, press X to delete them. From there I can use the rig and the squirrel character, as we will do, in the original file. If I open the action editor now, Blender has imported the run cycle only animation because it was the one that was used in the file. Since all the action were not assigned to the armature on the origin file, they were not used and hence not imported. So I can go to File and Append again and browse for the action in our squirrel file. And I can choose whatever action I want to import. Now I can find them in my action library but they have no users. So remember, if you want to keep them while saving and closing your file, you need to add a fake user. So basically, appending an asset is like copy and pasting it from another file. Let's now have a look to linking. In an empty Blender file, I will go to File, Link and browse for my original file. Go into the collection and link the collection. I get something pretty close to what we had when I've appended the collection. I can see my squirrel, I can see the rig, when I go into preview mode to material seems to work. In the action editor, there seems to be the animation in the library. The main difference we can here is that our characters seems to be attached to an empty and it's currently an empty object. And this empty object is currently instancing the collection of our squirrel. So it's not an independent copy of the collection but currently some kind of a clone where I can't edit in, I only have access to object mode. And it's the same for the action. If I unfold it, you can see that the key frame are not exposed and I can't modify them. To be able to access our rig, we need to go into the collection and find our collection under the collection instance. This little chain icon is here to tell us this is a linked data. Right click on it and under ID data, go to add library override hierarchy. It has created a new collection called Squirrel with a new icon showing a chain across by an arrow. Those are still a linked asset, but we can now access our squirrel object and also our squirrel armature. So I can get rid of my squirrel instance. The cool thing is that I can now go into pause mode onto my armature and they can manipulate my character as we will do in your original file. But if I want to edit my character, I can't. Blender will output an error message because I can't did the data of my object nor the data of the mesh. We can see that the data are grayed out. So basically, they don't belong to this Blender file but to another Blender file. So we can use those data, but we can't modify them. And it's the same with the armature, I can't go into edit mode. And it's also the same with animation data, we can't edit the current animation. But since we can access our rig we can create new animation if we want. And the cool thing is that we can make the current animation local so I can import all the link an animation we have made previously, make it local So is that it's currently a copy of the animation and we can modify it at will. To make it local, just select the action and click on the chain. It will become a local action, or you can simply duplicate the action and it will create a local action that is exactly the same as the linked one. The big benefit of used linked assets is that if the asset gets modified in the original file, it will be updated in our scene. To do so, I just need to go in your original file, modify the color of the character for example, or its shape, save it. Then in the Blender file where we are using those linked data, We can save this file for example, and just revert it or reload it so that it will update all the linked data. So while, as animators, we want to be able to create a new animation, which we can, we may not want to mess up with the rig all with the object. And if in the meantime, the character artist is updating our character, Whenever we go back to the scene to continue on animating it will update automatically. So using linked asset is super powerful in production. To summarize, we have seen that when we append data from one Blender file to another, it creates an original copy, it's like using copy and paste. When we link asset it will currently create an empty object with an instance of the asset. To be able to use those assets we need to create a library override. The big benefit of library override is that we can use the data from those assets but we can't edit them, so they are kind of protected. And whenever the source file is getting updated our current file will be updated too, making it perfect for team work. So using a linked asset library is perfect for teamwork or large-scale projects.

## 03-26 First scene

[Instructor] In this video, we will work on the first shot. I've already added a camera rig and I've already created a keying set for the different controllers but also the camera properties you can access, pressing the N key. I have keyed the focal length and the focus distance. I will now move my mouse cursor onto the 3D view we have on the right with the camera view. Press Z and switch to rendered view mode. I'm using the Eevee render engine and the scene is pretty light. Is it should render properly on almost every graphic cards. Let's now have a look to the organization of the scene. All the assets are organized into the scene collection and there are sub-collections. All the collections tagged in green includes all the assets for the environment so that you can deactivate them whenever your computer is slowing down, for example. The set collection includes all the lights, the lights effect and the camera. The particle emit collection includes all the particle emitters that generates the falling leaves but also the birds flying that we can see in the beginning of the teaser. I won't show you how to create all those assets because this is not the purpose of this course. All the bushes and trees are currently instanced. As when we link an asset from another scene, you can instance an asset into the scene. So you can see, those are empty object instancing a collection. Those collect are under the asset main collection. So if you want to modify the tree model, you have to do it in those assets but I advise you not to do it. But if, for example, I scale down one of the trees, you can see that now the trees are very small in my main scene. So you can easily duplicate and change the orientation or scale of the objects that are available in the scene to create your own environment or tweak this one if you will. Let's now import our character. I will make sure I have my main scene selected. Go to File, Link, insert for the squirrel finished file. I will go into the collection and link our squirrel collection. I can move it on the y-axis so that we can see it. From there in the outliner, I will expand the squirrel library, search for the collection, right click. ID Data, Add Library Override Hierarchy. It has created a new collection, including our rig and our character centered in our scene. So we can now select the source and get rid of it. I can now select the armature of my character and place it wherever I want in the set. From there, let's check if we have all our animation available. Select the character armature. I advise you to use the outliner to select it because on complex scenes, selection can be a bit messy. From there, in the 3D view, press Control + Tab to switch to pose mode and in the action editor, have a look at the different linked animation. Logging set can be useful, so I will duplicate it, so now I have a new copy of the keying set. I remember I have named my final run cycle animation Runcycle. So as I find it, I will duplicate it and since I'm missing the idle animation we have created in the previous videos, I will go to File, choose Link, but you can append the animation, browse into my Blender file and go to the Action folder and choose the idle. If you have append it, it will be added as a new animation. If you have linked it, just browse in your library, select it and click on the icon to make it a new action. To create this shot, we will combine the run cycle and the idle and we will layer some root motion using the NLA editor. We can now switch back to object mode and we will position our character more or less where he has to land where he jump out of the bush. Don't worry, we will be able to fine tweak its position later on. Since we have a pretty noisy ground, you don't really care if your character is perfectly contacting the ground. Just raise him a bit so that we can distinguish its feet. To make my life easier, since I will be mainly working on the character, I will make sure that I will make all the other collection unselectable by clicking this icon. If it's not available for you, just go in the filter and activate it. Now I will go back in pose mode on my character. I will load its keying animation, duplicate it and rename it to create a locomotion action. This is the action we will layer on top of our run cycle and idle to move our character in space. Now we can open the NLA editor where we will combine those different actions. I will enable the show only selected option and I will get rid of all those NLA tracks that are not used. We have a first NLA track that is available called run, so as seen in the NLA video, if I close my action, then the NLA track will be rigged. And we can see one cycle of the run cycle. I can press Shift + A and add an idle action so that our character will make one run cycle, then jump into the idle and then I can add a more run cycle action after the idle or you can duplicate the current one. I will duplicate it three times so that our character will make three cycle. Or you can simply change the strip length. Since there is a cycle modifier on the curve, the character will repeat the run cycle. But this might not work since we have linked the animation. And it might create conflict, so the NLA editor won't allow you to do so. But we will see that later as it's a bit complex and we don't need to dive into this topic. Now I will select the first NLA track and press Shift + A and add our locomotion animation to it. The strip is almost empty because the action is only one frame for the time being, so let's open it in the action editor. The idea is to key our first move. If you remember well, our run cycle was performed within 12 frames and our character was moving by 0.7 meter in the negative direction. My root bone selected in post mode. I will type in -0.7 meter in the y location channel and insert a keyframe. Remember to enable the autokeying in the timeline and the keying set to available only. I can add a keyframe by simply pressing I in my action editor. Then I will select my root keys and press V to switch them to vector. Since I already have a track with the locomotion action onto it, I can close the locomotion action in the action editor and my character is still moving, reading the locomotion track. If I disable it, the character will read the next track with the idle in the run. To combine them, we need to change the strip blending mode. And this is where it's a bit tricky. At the time I'm recording this video, I've tested it on Blender 2.91 and 92 and we can't edit the strip behavior used by a linked data, which is a bit weird since we can modify the action but we can't modify the way the action are used with the NLA editor. To fix this, and I believe this is a temporary fix, and the behavior will change with newer Blender versions, we need to make our rig fully local, breaking the link between the scene and the original file. Simply left click on the override icon near the name of your object. From there, the strip option are available and we can change them, making this run cycle action, for example, longer and repeating over time. Or more important in our case, selecting the locomotion action and switching its blending mode to combine. This way we get both the locomotion action and the running cycle action combined together. And since we are using Alt + forward, our character keep the last position of the root bone we have keyed, exactly as shown in the NLA editor video. So now that we are able to move our character in space, let's position hin properly based on the camera position. I will also clean up a bit my file by renaming the locomotion track, locomotion. From there, select the armature of the character and make sure that you are in object mode. The goal is not to animate the position of our character but just properly frame where he'll be standing while performing his idle animation. So by moving the armature object in object mode, I'm kind of setting where the animation starts and the idea here is to do it in top view and double check in my camera view how it looks. The character goes through the bush and kind of land in the middle of the screen. So it looks great to me but you are free to move the bush a little bit and then we will edit the camera position. So now I'd like to make my character move once he's escaping. So we need to edit our locomotion action and we can press the Tab key to enter tweak mode and automatically access our action in the action editor. We can duplicate frame 12 and move it on frame 104. This way, the root of our character doesn't move. Now for the next 12 frames, I'd like to move my character by 0.7 meters. So I will input a value of -1.4 meter on my y-axis. And Blender should automatically write the key. But it doesn't and when I try to force it, pressing the I key, I get an error message. Blender tells me that this action is used in the NLA editor but the NLA editor has no influence to using this action. But when I check the NLA strip and I check the action influence, it's set to one but what's happening here is that our locomotion strip on the locomotion track is too short. So it has no influence beyond the frame 12. Hence Blender doesn't allow to insert the keyframe. To fix this problem, we can ask Blender to automatically update the length of the strip. We just need to go to the action clip option and enable synchronize length. Now if I change the value of the y-axis of the root bone, Blender will automatically insert a keyframe as usual. I will select the newly created key, press the V key and switch its handle type to vector. So that we have now fixed this problem and we can move our character in space, I like to give some variation to the animation. Instead of making our character moving in a straight line, I like him to rotate a bit on the second jump. So I will go into top view and I will disable the bush collection so that we have a better overview of our character. I will rotate it a bit and offset it a bit on the side, only using the root bone and being on frame 160. Then I will move the playhead 12 frames later on frame 128 where our character will land for the next time and I will offset its position. It doesn't have to be super accurate. I'm just trying to offset my character by 0.7 meter in the same direction. Since our character is jumping out of the frame, it doesn't matter if it's not perfectly accurate. The motion might look a bit robotic from the top view but from the side view or the camera view, it does look pretty cool. That's another thing we haven't tackled yet is that you generally animate to camera view, meaning that it doesn't matter how it looks from other angles. The thing is that it has to look straight from what will be outputted in the movie. So now if you want, you can add some extra motion to your character. To keep things simple for this animation, we will only add a bit of rotation in the main torso controller. Add a keyframe on all channels on frame 104. From there, I will try to have a better angle on my character and select the main root torso controller. We will go on frame 109, more or less in the middle of the jump and the idea is to slightly twist our character toward the direction he's jumping to. So the idea is to slightly rotate the main controller on the local y-axis. So I will switch the pivot point to local, press R and then Y to constraint on the local y and slightly lean our character. Then on the frame where he's landing, I will press Alt + R to cancel the rotation. This will just add a little twist to the character body while he's changing rotation, making it look more natural. What I want to show you there is that you can fine tweak your animation at will using this method. If you want, you can lay a bit of head rotation or tail rotation and this is a very good method to get high-quality results without spending too much time on the animation. So it's a perfect method for beginners or if you are tight on the time budget. Now is the perfect time to work on our camera animation. If you press Tab or select another action strip, Blender will automatically exit the tweak mode. And the length of our locomotion strip has been updated thanks to the synchronize length option. From there, I can press Control + Tab to get out of pose mode on our squirrel armature. Make sure that I make my collection selectable and I will select the camera rig and press Control + Tab. The dolly rig action should already be assigned to this armature. The first thing to do is to frame our main shot. I think it's easier to keyframe first where you want to go than where you come from. So I will go on a frame where I can see my character and I will lower the aim controller of the camera to better listen to the character. Then I will increase the focal length of the camera so that we are a bit more zoomed onto the main subject of our animation. This is going to be my default pose, so I will move the keyframe on frame zero. I will then select all those keyframe and move them away in time. It doesn't matter where I put them. So let's now create our first framing by moving the aim controller of the camera towards the sky. I will also slightly move up the camera controller. It will just add a bit more texture to the camera animation. Just imagine you have the camera on your shoulder and you're raising and looking at the sky at the same time. So there is a bit of translation and rotation. For the time being, this shot is pretty blurry, so I will search for the focal distance and I will increase it's value until I get a sharper result. So now we have our camera going back to the ground. It will stop here for a few frames, then have a look to the bush where our character is hidden and then follow the character. So we can select the keys on frame 60 and duplicate them on frame 78 or 80. So there, I will go on frame 94 or 95 and I will move my end controller toward the main bush. Then I will go into the action editor, press I and insert a keyframe on every controllers. The base animation of our camera is now what we need to do is to synchronize the movement of our squirrel character with the current set we have created. And with the NLA editor, it's gonna be very easy. Let's press Control + tab to get out of pose mode, select our squirrel character rig and in the NLA editor, I just need to select all the strips, press G to offset them onto frame 100. If we uncheck the show only selected option, we can see also our camera action. And if we play our animation, we can see our camera getting low and our character jumping out of the bush. So now let's select back our camera rig and press Control + Tab to get back into pose mode. I will move the last keys for our camera whenever the camera is framing the bush by two keys so that I have a slightly smoother motion and then I will duplicate those keys and move them on frame 109. This is the moment our camera will start to rotate to follow the character. So I make sure there is a slight delay between the time our character jump out of the bush and the time our camera is starting to rotate. It will look more natural. Do not make your camera anticipate the motion of your character. That will look fake or CG. Now we can duplicate our keys from frame 60, which are the frames that are focused on the character and move them around frame 125. From there, we need to increase the length of our animation. So I will set the end on frame 250. To do so, position the playhead on frame 250 and press Control + End. Now I can duplicate the keys from frame 125 to the frame 203. This is when our character is preparing to flee. And since I want a bit of delay for the camera reaction, I will duplicate or offset those keys on 209. Now I can move on frame 227 and offset the aim controller toward the bush on the right where our character is disappearing. Now if we check the animation, we can see that our camera is trying to follow the character but we have a bit of delay, which looks pretty natural. Now the final touch on the camera animation to make it look less robotic is to add a very slight overshoot through the graph editor. I'm not really good at animating cameras but what I can tell you is that try to keep your camera motion as simple as possible. With that being said, just switch to the graph editor and with the aim controller selected, I will expose all the different channels and hide the rotation channels since they are not used. And now what I will do, whenever a curve hit a keyframe before a hold, where the camera is not moving anymore, I will slightly rotate the handles. That will create a very subtle overshoot that will make our camera motion way more believable and interesting. From there, we will just add the final touch to our animation, making the bush move and adding some particles. So I will make myself a bit of room in the different editor. Get back to pose mode and select the bush our character is jumping from. I will position the playhead more or less just before the camera is rotating toward the bush. And with the bush selected, I will insert a keyframe on its rotations. From there, I can switch to the action editor. We don't need to use the graph editor for this. And to make the bush shake, I will go just two frame later, slightly rotate it on the left. Go two or three frame later, slightly rotate it on the right. Repeat it two or three time and finished with its original keyframe by simply duplicating the first keyframe we have set. I will then offset those keys, create a hold by duplicating the last key and move it whenever the character is jumping out of the bush. And I will repeat the process, making a slight shake whenever he's getting through the bush. From there, I will just offset the first group of keys just before the camera is rotating toward the bush. The bush shakes, the camera turn. Now we need to adjust the particles. In object mode, go into the particle collection, select the bush emitter. Our character is jumping out of the bush on frame 104. Knowing that, let's go into the properties editor, select the particles property and under the Emission tab, change the start and end value to 102, two frames prior our character is jumping out of the bush. It's basically a simply plane emitting leaves particles. So you can adjust its position if you want and I've just shown you how to modify when it emits the particles. I won't go further because this is not a course about particles and particle system could require a full course. When you're happy with your particles, if you want to make sure that they will render properly, go to the Cache tab, check the Disk Cache option, and whether click the Bake button or Bake All Dynamics, it will bake all the particle system in the scene. If you need to tweak the particle setting, just delete the bake and bake again after you have tweaked your settings. If you want to adjust the birds in the sky, it's the same system. Just unzoom a bit and you will find a particle emitter for the birds or you can select it directly into the collections. Then you can offset the start and end values, even before frame zero so that those birds will be emitted before the animation start and they will be in frame on frame zero. So for this current shot, a value of -64 and 0 is currently good. And when you're done, don't forget to bake the dynamics.

## 03-27-Editing the sequences

In this video, we will have a quick overview of the different sequences and how to render and edit them in the Video Sequence editor. The second scene or second shot of our short animation is super simple. The camera is simply moving in a linear fashion, using linear interpolation on the x-axis following our character until it disappear into a bush. The character itself is simply using it's run cycle animation that is looping. And on top of this I have layered simple locomotion action in the NLA editor that move by 0.7 meters every 12 frames. And then choose an extrapolation filter set to linear extrapolation. (wind woosh effect) For the next shot, when our character start climbing the tree, the root of the camera is still moving left to right, but this time I have a bit of easing in the camera motion, and then the camera stop. In the meantime, I'm using the Aim controller to create down to up motion. Particularly the camera is following the squirrel and there is a slight easing until the end of the shot that the camera looks a little more alive. Also the character is not full frame. He appear on a third of the camera and is facing the closed side of the shot so that we do feel like he's escaping. For the character motion it's as usual. I've combined this time, the climbing cycle with locomotion action using the NLA editor. For the locomotion animation I've only animated the root bone of the character. Since his motion is not as linear as before, meaning that it's likely changing direction on each bounce but still as a constant speed, I've made sure that I add linear interpolation between each frame switching every handle to vector. And then on each contact pose of the character I will slightly change its orientation and moving following the tree trunk. You can see that from a side view it might not look perfect, but it does work very well from the camera angle. So that's perfectly fine. (wind woosh effect) On the next shot there is no camera motion so it's just about placing the camera. Again, our character is framed so that it follows a third of the camera view. I am still using the climbing cycle animation we have created, but this time you can see there is no locomotion action. Instead, I'm using a path constraint on the root bone of our character. We will see how to create it and use it in the next video. But particularly our character is simply following a curve and we can animate the speed at which the character is following this curve. While we should use a linear speed I slightly edited the speed of the character using the Graph editor, inputting a bit of variation. so that it looks a little more dynamic from the camera angle. And that was it. (wind woosh effect) For the very last sequence of our character animation the camera doesn't move until our character settle in the shot. Then the root of the camera is slightly moving up and forward and I've animated the focal length and the focus distance so that we are progressively focusing onto the horizon. For the character animation. I've used one cycle of the run cycle combined with the locomotion, which is a simple forward animation on 0.7 meter. And then I've used our idle animation. And I've cut the idle animation on frame 68. What I did do on the very final version of the trailer was to add a couple of additional animation on the very end so that the character is still moving while it's getting out of focus. I haven't recorded the the animation process because that will be redundant. And you will still have a lot of animation content to watch in this course. But the process was exactly the same as when we have made our idle animation. So it's also time for you to try to do it on your own. (wind woosh effect) As you are done with animation we need to render those shots. If you are using the provided file, I've already set up the render. You just need to go to Render and click Render animation or press Control + F12. As you do, Blender will render the animation scene with the camera view. It will start from the start frame till the end frame and using the resolution set into the dimensions. We don't care about frame rate, unless we are exporting a movie like an MPEG sequence. But I do advise you to render PNG files. If you run in movie file, there is big chances it will be compressed. Plus, if Blender crashes before the end of the rendering, you will have to re-render the whole sequence. While if you are using image sequence, you will just have to re-render from the frame it has crashed. I've set up my render output so that Blender will create the folder, "RENDERS", and the subfolder, "SCENE-05", 4, 3, 2 or 1. And the image sequence will be called, "Scene-05", in this case. And Blender will automatically add a suffix number corresponding to the frame number. (wind woosh effect) Since I generally use After Effects to create my sequences and work on my compositing, I won't do an in-depth video about the Video Sequence editor in Blender, but they will give you the foundation that will allow you to use it without problem. So let's convert both our 3D view and timeline to the Video Sequence editor. It's pretty straightforward. We have different tracks and pressing Shift + A I can add different items. It can be text, sound, whatever. Let's choose image sequence, browse our render folder, and press A to select all the PNG file of the first sequence. And press, Add image sequence. Blender has automatically added all our image as a sequence on the first track. If I want to extend the end of the animation to a further frame, I just need to position the play head and press Control + End as we do in the timeline. The image sequence is read at the speed of our general frame rate. To be able to preview our animated sequence we can switch to Sequence Preview. It will display our sequence track so we can collapse them and also the current frames that is being read. If I press the Space bar to preview my video, we can see that the frame rate is not very good, but this is because Blender is currently caching the video, meaning that is kind pre-calculating it. The cached sequence is shown into a brighter red beneath the tracks. Once the images are cached if we play it again, it will play real time. So what I will quickly do now is repeat the process and import the five image sequences I have created for this shot. Since there is no blending between sequence one and two, I can left click and drag sequence two on the first track. I can do the same with sequence three, moving it on the first track, but I will need to cut it a bit because there are some repeating frame between the previous sequence and the current one. To cut it I simply need to place the play head wherever I want to cut and press K. Then I will scrub through the timeline to watch out for any repetition and remove any content from the selected strip by cutting it and then pressing X to delete it. Now I'd like to blend the next sequence onto the other, creating a fading. The first important thing is to find out the right timing between the moment our character is getting out of the frame and when he's getting back into the frame. Here I feel that the time we wait is too long before we see the character back into frame. So I will remove a part of the sequence. Then I will move it on top above the other, so that we have overlapping sequences. Pressing the N key I will be able to open the Properties panel. And in this Strip tab, in the Adjust panel, I have an Opacity option. I will click on the little dot icon near the opacity level, and it will automatically insert the key frames. It means that on this frame our strip will be fully opaque. I can scrub back to the beginning of the strip and then set the opacity to zero and click this icon to insert a new key frame. And we've just animated the opacity of the strip, creating a natural fade. From there, I can select our last sequence strip. Left click and drag, or press G, to move it just after the current sequence. From there, I advise you to cache the animation and double check it to see if it looks natural. To cache the animation just play it once. The final touch will be to boost a bit the contrast of our shots. So we press Shift + A and add an adjustment layer. I will move it on top of everything and then I will left click and drag onto one of the side to extend it till the end of the movie. Just think of it as an empty strip. But whatever adjustment modifier I will add on top of it will be applied to any strip beneath this adjustment layer. So if I go to the Modifier tab, I can add a new modifier and I will choose the Curve modifier. If I now left click on the top right corner of the curve and move this value up, this will make the bright color of our picture even brighter. So just push it ever so slightly. And I will then click somewhere in the bottom left corner of the curve and just drag it down a little bit so that the darker tone will be a little darker. So in the end, we have kind of boosted a bit the contrast of our picture. If you click back and forth onto the eye icon, you can see your picture with and without this curve modifier. From there, you can add another modifier if you want. For example, a tone mapping or a color balance, and change a bit the colors of your shot. To make it warmer, for example. I won't go any further on this topic because I'm not a specialist of compositing. Just experiment a bit with those modifier and see how they behave. From there to render your movie, simply choose a file path and output. Then I advise you to select a movie file format like ffmpeg. I generally choose mp4 and then switch to h264 and use a loss-less quality. Then go into the Sequence editor, View, Sequence Render Animation. Wait, and enjoy your movie.

## 03-28-Animated curve path

[Instructor] In this video, we will see how to use a curve as a path as in the tree climbing sequence. In the corresponding file, I have two collections, one including a simple arrow and the other one including our squirrel character and the tree. Getting back to the arrow collection, I will press Shift + A to add a curve, Bezier curve. As any other object added to your scene, it is spawned onto the 3D cursor. It has an origin point and if I press Tab to enter edit mode, I can access the handles of the curve. It's pretty close to the handles we have in the graph editor. Curves have an orientation, meaning that they have a starting point and an ending point. To see it, we can go into the overlay and display the normals of the curve. Arrows will be displayed along the curve, showing you the orientation of flow of the curve, also called normals of the curve. In edit mode, you can manipulate the handles, as I explained before, using G, R and S. You can change the handle type as you will do in the graph editor, pressing the V key. Then you will get the same behavior as the one we have in the graph editor but this time for a 3D object. And with any curve point selected, you can press E to extrude a new point. As any object, we can access the curve that are in the properties panel. You can give a bit of thickness or geometry to your curve going into the geometry panel. The simple extrude will generate a rebound-like shape, while the bevel will allow you to create some kind of pipe. While we don't need geometry for animation, it makes the curve more readable in the 3D space. In object mode, I can select my arrow object, then select the curve to make it active. Press Control + P and choose Follow Path. Now if I scrub into the timeline, I can see the arrow following the curve. In the path animation option of the curve, we can see the value frames. And it is set to 100 frames. It means that the object that is parented to the curve with the follow path option will take 100 frames to get from the beginning of the curve 'til the end of the curve. Switching to 50 frame value, you can see that now my arrow get to the end of the curve on frame 50. As our arrow object is currently a child of the curve, we can move it at will. It will still follow the path. And we can see that by default, our arrow object will rotate to follow the curvature of the path. If I go into the option of the curve to the path animation and uncheck Follow, the object is no longer rotating to follow the orientation of the curve. The curve path only affect the location of the object. Let's restart from scratch. I have removed any influence from the curve. I will reselect the arrow, then the curve, press Control + P and this time, choose Path Constraint. This will add a path constraint to the arrow that we can see in the Constraint tab of the properties editor. From there, if I scrub into the timeline, nothing happened. Our object gets stuck on the initial point of the curve. If I click the Animate Path button, now our object is traveling along the curve and you can see that it takes it 100 frames to follow the curve, as before. It still use the frame's value from the curve properties. Let's go back onto our arrow object and check out the constraint. We can see the forward axis and up axis option. To better understand it, I will display the axis on my object. So we can see that our arrow is pointing in its y direction and the up axis is the z-axis, exactly as set into the constraint. So if I now click the Follow Curve option, the orientation of the arrow will change. It will follow the curve. Its y-axis will be aligned with the curve path and the z-axis will still be pointing up as set in the constraint. If I switch the orientation to -y, it will flip the arrow but it will still follow the curve and so if I choose the x-axis, for example, logically you can't use the same channel as a forward and up axis. It will deactivate the constraint and it will no longer work. The offset value have two different behavior. Let's move to frame 20 and in the offset value, set the value to 10. Our arrow is moved back on the curve. Its current position is frame 20, -10 frames. The offset value is how we delay the position of the arrow in time. Basically, we are subtracting the offset value to the frame's value of the curve. So if I set it to -10, it will currently move the arrow forward, Exactly as if I was on frame 30 without any offset. If I now enable the fixed position, our arrow object will be stuck to the beginning of the curve. Now the offset value is no longer a value in frame but a value that goes from zero to one and indicate the position between the beginning and the end of the curve. Finally, if I enable the curve radius option, our constraint object scale will depend on the curve radius. So if I now go into edit mode onto the curve and press Alt + S with one of the control points selected, I will be able to change the radius of the curve and this will influence the scale of our arrow objects. Finally, in edit mode, when working on the curve, with a control point selected, I can change the tilt value and I will see my curve twisting or tilting. And so will the object that is constrained by the curve, creating very nice animations. We can tilt the curve with the Control + T shortcut. Let's now see how we can use this trick to animate our squirrel character. I will display the squirrel collection. I will move the current curve into the arrow collection and I will press the Shift + A in object mode to add a new curve. This is going to be our squirrel path. This time, instead of constraining the squirrel object, I will constrain the root bone of our character. In pose mode, I can go to the bone constraint, not the object constraint and add a follow path constraint and source our curve. Now the root bone of our character gets stuck at the beginning of the curve. If I click the Follow Curve option, I can see my character getting align with the curve and if I now scrub, I can't see it moving because we need to click the Animate Path button. And by default, our character will follow the curve and reach the end on frame 100. To give a proper orientation to our character, we need to switch to -y as being the forward axis. Now our character is properly following the path. A big warning here. Whenever you are using a curve modifier, make sure that the constraint object has its origin aligned with world space, meaning that its origin is reset because if you offset the object, the constraint will behave weirdly. You can move the curve as you want. The constraint object will follow but make sure that the constraint object has all its transform channels reset. Now that you understand the curve constraint, you can go into edit mode and start building your motion path for your character. I'm doing it into a little time lapse because I'm using a simple rotation scale and extrude functions. My main advice is use as less point as possible and try to have your curve as smooth as possible. Also, you can use the bevel option to give a bit of thickness to your curve so that it's easier to read along the tree trunk. The less control point you set onto your curve, the easier it will be to keep it smooth and so the animation of your character will also be smooth. If you create hard angles or too curvy path, then the animation of your character will look weird unless you heavily edit the animation on top of the cycle. When you're satisfied with the path, you can zoom in and tweak the tilt and position of the control point so that your character feet stick to the trunk and you avoid the clipping. Don't forget to double check from camera view because sometimes, even if your character is a bit floating, that's perfectly fine, 'til it looks good from the camera point of view as usual. Back to object mode, we need to set the correct speed for our character to climb the tree and we can do it by modifying the frame's value into the curve's option. As the feet are moving backward, it means that our character animation is faster than the locomotion. So I need to reduce the frame's value. With a value of 70, it seems that now the feet are sliding forward. So our character locomotion is too fast. So it's just a matter of trial and error to find the correct value. A value of 85 seems to work well for me. And it depends on the curve length. So you may not have the same value. Another way to control the speed at which our character is moving is to use the offset. We can enable the fixed position. Now our character is no longer moving and insert a keyframe on the offset factor. I'm setting a value of zero on frame zero and on frame 85, a value of one. If I now go into the graph editor, I will be able to see the curve of this animated value and we can see that there is easing in and easing out, so our character is slowing down and accelerating. What I do need to do is whether change the interpolation of the curve to linear or select all the handles, press V, and switch to vector. The cool thing about choosing this method is that I can insert a keyframe whenever my character is about to jump. Then another keyframe when he's just landing and then I can offset a bit the landing keyframe if I want my character to make a larger jump. The only thing not to forget is to also offset the latest keyframe so that the interpolation between those two keyframe doesn't change, and so our character speed remain the same. But between frame 22 and frame 29 here, the speed of my character is no longer the same and it seems he's doing a bigger jump. This is a little trick that will allow you to break the rhythm of your animation and make it more appealing. At least, less linear. This is the end of this chapter. You now know everything to be able to create the same shot as I did. Don't forget that failing is a part of the process but giving up is not a part of the process. Stay strong, repeat and I will see you in the next chapter where we will learn new animation techniques. To summarize, we have seen that we can use a 3D curve as an animated path for an object to follow. We can use parenting or path constraint. The frames' value determines the time to travel along the whole curve. We can use the offset value to delay the path animation. We can use the curve to scale and tilt the constrained object. We can use the constraint on a bone. Make sure the origin of the constrained object is reset to world origin before applying the curve constraint.

## 04-01-Introduction

[Instructor] Welcome to chapter four. In this chapter, we will be using another technique to animate the robot character we can see in the second teaser of the course. While in the previous chapter, we have been blocking, detailing the animation, then going to spline and polish it, in this chapter, we are going to use the layered approach. The idea is to pose the robot and then directly work into spline or using the graph editor onto different part of the body. We will start with the torso root motion, creating the up and down and then we will work onto the feet of the character. The idea is to animate the other part of the character in reaction of the previous part we will animate. So I will animate the torso, then the arms, reacting to the motion of the torso. In this chapter, we will also learn the fundamentals of space switching and using constraint when animating. With this method, we will be able to use the base motion of the torso and the legs to drive the other parts of the robot, creating very realistic animation very easily. We will use all those methods to create this walk cycle, an artillery shot with a cool recoil and finally, combining the walk cycle with a rocket shot. This is a super exciting chapter with a lot of technique that we are going to use later on in the course. Let's get started.

## 04-02-Robot rig presentation

[Instructor] Before we get started, let's have a look to the rig. By default, the character is presented with a MatCap and the preview of the texture. You can enter material preview mode to see the robot at its best but you should stay in showing mode for animation performances. (whoosh) By default, you should have access to the different rig layers. If it's not the case, open the text editor. You should have the script open, if it's not the case, select it in the list and press the play button. Then select the rig and go into pose mode. The first thing to check is this eye icon. It's a bone that holds some custom properties. The Bevel option allows us to re-enable the Bevel modifier that is on the robot. It will make it look a little better but it will also increase the number of polygon, hence reducing the performances. Activating the Bevel modifier tend to triple the number of polygons. Enabling the subdiv option, will enabled the subdivision modifier on the robot, increasing the number of faces to almost a million. So it will largely slow down your computer performances. If I press the space bar and try to play the animation, even if our robot is not animated, you can see the number of frame per second dropping. Note that those option only effect the viewport display. You don't need to re-enable them if you want to render your animation. Getting back onto this view property bone, you can see that there are options to mask the artillery piece, the legs, and both the mini gun, and the rocket launcher. Just, as we add on the squirrel character allows us to focus on specific parts of the character. Next to these bones, we have another one that is our properties bone. It includes a lot of different properties but they almost all do the same thing. The first ones allow us to switch between the forward kinematic and inverse kinematics for the right leg or the left leg. By default, they are set to inverse kinematics. Moving the inverse kinematic controller would allow us to animate the whole leg exactly as we did with our squirrel characters. If we change the value to zero, now the leg is moving in another position. It will now follow the forward kinematic controllers that we can access by activating the forward kinematic layer. Now the leg is moving using forward kinematic and we can control each segment separately. We will be mostly animating using inverse kinematic so you can switch it back. The next properties allows up to enable or disable the rotation follow of the different parts of the robot. By default, the arms are following the orientation of the body. But if I disable this flow rotation, you can see that now they stay or (indistinct). They don't follow the rotation of the body anymore. You will find the same option for the artillery piece and the head of the robot. By default, the follow rotation is disabled but if I re-enable the follow head rotation, you can see that now the head is leaning forward and is aligned with the body. The follow leg rotation will only affect the leg behavior whenever you are using forward kinematic. This is pretty common when using forward kinematic for the arms or the leg to isolate their rotation from the hips rotation, or the shoulder rotation. The next option, mini gun speed, will allow us to set the speed of rotation of the mini gun cannon so that we don't need to animate the rotation of the barrels. The mini gun follow and the sensor follow, allow us to isolate the targets from both those items. The mini gun and the sensor will follow their own target. And by default, those targets are parented to the body of the robot. If we disable or set to zero the value of the follow option, the target are no longer following the motion of the body. And so you can see the mini gun adjusting its orientation toward the aiming point. And so does the sensor on top of the robot. (whoosh) The controllers of the robot are pretty straightforward. The root bone allows us to move the whole robot the torso root allows us to move the whole body. Then you will find controllers for the different parts. All targets for the legs, IK controllers, allowing to move and rotate the feet. On the back of the foot, you will find a very useful controller that allow us to perform steps or rotation around the ball and the heel of the foot. When you rotate it from the front view or on its Z axis, you will get a nice contacting left to right motion. Both arms of controller, the rocket launcher as a door opening controller, each body part as a separate controller as on the body of this squirrel character. Each rocket as its own controller that allows us to move them in space at will. And they also have a secondary controller that alow us by a simple one axis rotation to deploy the wings of those rockets. The antennas have a simple one axis rotation control. The artillery as a first controller that allows us to create the recoil motion. And we also have a nigary controller that allow us a bit of up and down motion and also to slightly rotate the artillery back and forth. So it's a pretty simple yet versatile rig. Let's animate this beast.

## 04-03-base motion

With the layered approach, we focus on building the motion channel by channel The idea is not to go through a blocking stage then detailed blocking, spinning, and polishing. We will directly work in the graph editor on specific parts of the character. We will start from the root of the character and in reaction, we will animate the legs. This is the whole concept about the layered approach. We will first work on the up and down motion of the root of the torso and in reaction the legs and then the left to right motion of the torso. With the file opened and the King set selected, I've duplicated the action and then will rename it: walk. Will activate the fix user to make sure we don't lose what we are doing and activate the auto key framing. First controller will walk with is the tussle route. As for this scleral character, it's the main controller of the torso. So we start with selecting the property's bone and set to zero, the follow arm properties. This might be something we will change along the way, reset it to one or to zero, depending on our needs. First motion we will work on is the up and down motion of the torso. And we will work on the Z location channel. The goal is to focus on one channel at a time. So selecting the visibility bone, I will hide everything but the torso so that we can really focus on the motion of the torso. For this animation I will work with a frame rate of 30 frame per seconds. You can stick to the 24 frame per second rhythm, if you want. It's a matter of personal preferences. So normally like to work at 30 frames per second because I'm used to animate for games. And a lot of movies are now set to 25 to 30 frame per seconds. But we will cycle range of 30 frame, in the end I've used a 36 frame cycle for the up and down motion, but you can choose to do it faster or slower. Here I want to create a very slow pace and heavy walk cycle. But you could do a run cycle with the same method. With my roots torso selected, I will directly jump into the graph editor. The controller is aligned with world space so we can work directly on the Z location. I have an up and down motion for both the left step and the right step. So on the one whole work cycle, the up and down motion will repeat twice. I will arbitrary go to frame five and raise about here. The idea here is just to get an extra key frame on our torso. The motion will be pretty simple. If we want to make our character heavy, we need to make it raise pretty slowly because it has to push a lot of weight and whenever the torso is getting down it will kind of fall pretty fast. And we can build a pretty strong overshoot to communicate this weight. And as I said, tall I've inputted a very slight up-and-down motion on the few frame to create some kind of vibration or bones of the whole torso as if the body was bouncing as it touched its lowest position. This will bring a pretty clunky or robotic motion. I will keep on showing the Z location curve so that you have a reference. As any animation process, it's a creative process, so I wasn't planning on doing this on 36 frame at first. To be perfectly honest, I wasn't knowing all mini frame would take an up-and-down motion. It's just about playing the animation, making sounds with my mouse to feel the weight of the character. And in the end, a little more than one second per step looks slow enough to communicate the weight of the robot character. A couples of details regarding the curve shape. At first, the character is raising pretty fast and when it's reaching its top position it's slightly slowing down. Then we have some kind of plateau shape on the curve. This will make the robot hold a bit in the up position for a few frames, and it will kind of serve as an anticipation before the fall. Note that the curve is not perfectly flat here. I've slightly rotated the handle, so that even if you took still, it's still moving a bit. This is a moving hold. If you have a perfectly flat curve here it won't look natural. As your character will stop moving. Here is my up and down motion of the torso root. In the next video, we will add the foot motion.

## 04-04-01 Leg motion

[Pierre] In this video, we will start animating the feet based on the root of the torso motion. The first thing to do is to double the length of the motion we just created. And we need to repeat this up and down cycle. With all my curve controllers selected, I will duplicate them. But first, make sure that the very first controller and the very last are exactly the same. Then press Shift + D to duplicate and offset by the length of your animation. In my case, 36 frames. So that my whole cycle run through 72 frames. Again, this is the rhythm I have chosen for this animation. Your animation can be faster or slower. From there, I will press Alt + H to un-hide my controller, select the visibility property bone and they will re-enable the legs. Since the legs are using an inverse kinematic mechanism, we will just have to animate the foot controller. The cool thing with this animation method is that it's easy to tweak the position of any controller by slightly offsetting the curves. If I want to raise the up and down motion of the character, I just need to select the root controller and offset the whole curve on the y-axis in the graph editor. The up and down motion will occur higher, giving more space for the foot motion. But it doesn't matter, even if it doesn't look good I will be able to get back onto this curve and offset it at will. The first thing to do from there is to position our feet based on the motion of the torso. Generally, the up pose, the moment where the torso is at its highest point is close to the passing pose. It is generally slightly delayed. When the foot contacts the ground, the torso goes down. And when the foot is pulling back, the torso is raising. Since the torso is almost at its highest point on frame 20, I will slightly move the foot back on this frame. And on frame zero, whenever the torso is at its lowest point, I will push the foot forward. The idea is not to get 100% accurate but just create a few landmark before we use the curve and adjust the rhythm. Finally, the foot will be third or away on the back whenever we have just hit the down pose. And then when the character is pushing on the other leg, the current foot will be raising. The idea here is to work only on one axis as we did for the torso, setting the position of the foot just before it leaves the ground. Finally, I need to find the moment where this foot will get back forward, and this should have happen just before the body is falling. The foot contact the ground and then we have the down pose of the torso. Our animation doesn't look pretty at all but at least we have the main landmarks. Since the forward motion of the foot will be mostly linear, I will select all the key frames of the foot, press V and change the handle type to vector. As we did before with our squirrel character, we will consider the cycle to be linear, meaning that the character is moving at a constant speed. Hence, I can remove the key frame prior to key 33, because we just need to key frame, one starting point and one and point to create this linear motion. Let's switch to the graph editor. To get the right pace of the foot when on the ground, I need to interpolate from frame 60 back to frame 33 through the whole cycle. Because frame 59 or 60 mark the moment our character is contacting with the ground, while frame 33 is the moment the foot is leaving the ground. So this plateau is not correct nor the interpolation between frame zero and frame 33. But what I can do or what I should do, because I've made a slight mistake, is to duplicate the key from frame 34 on frame 105, which stand for frame plus frame 33. This way, between frame 60 and frame 105, I have the whole motion of the foot sticking to the ground with the right interpolation. From there, I can go on frame and insert a key frame on this channel. I can now duplicate to this key frame and move it on frame zero and set both to free or to vector. Now, both the first and last key frame are the same and they have the right interpolation and the foot is moving at the right speed on the ground. Now I just need to work on the up and down motion between frame 33 and frame 60. We can also adjust the moment the foot is leaving the ground, I think it could happen a little later. Now that we know how to fix the interpolation between the beginning and the end of the motion, that's perfectly fine. The other thing to consider is that while the foot has linear or motion on the ground, it won't have linear motion in the air. By rotating this handle, I will create a slight overshoot backward as if the foot was projected the backward because of its inertia when leaving the ground. With this row editing done, I will switch to the Z location curve and they will simply add a new key frame between the landing pose, between the contacting pose and the pose where the foot is leaving the ground. As usual, you can see here the final curve for both the Y and Z axis. As I did for the torso, to get a satisfying sense of weight, I will make a slight plateau or moving halt just before the foot hit the ground, so that it will have some kind of a hard time to raise. It will stay up before landing very quickly because it's very heavy and the robot is kind of releasing the foot. So it creates some kind of nice contrast on the curve that currently translates on the animation. The tricky thing about this method is to focus on one motion at a time. And here, you may find out the motion looks a bit weird because there is no rotation in the foot. But we will input some rotation in the foot slightly later on. Just focus on one channel at a time, one controller at a time. And even focus on the motion of the controller itself. Not necessarily the motion of the whole robot. As any other animation technique, it will take you a bit of time to get used to it but it's very handy for this kind of animation. Before we call the base motion of the foot down, I want to slightly push forward the foot just before it lands. To do so, I've slightly rotated the handle just before the contacting pose, so that the foot gets a little more forward before it hits the ground. From there, I can adjust the up motion of the foot. Don't hesitate to track the arcs of your animation using the motion path we have seen in the previous chapter. In the next video, we will use the foot roll controller to add a bit of rotation on the ankle and on the whole foot.

## 04-04-02 Foot Roll

In this video, we will quickly create the foot roll. Meaning that we will input a bit of rotation in the foot and slightly adjust the whole motion. This is going to be pretty straightforward. I will select the foot roll controllers that is in the back of the foot. I will first select the correct controller the one I'm working on, and I will rotate it a bit forward. As the foot is kind of under the torso. It's tough to raise during the passing pose. From there, I can go a few frame before, and I will cancel the rotation by pressing Alt + R in the 3D view. From there, I will go forward into the animation to the contacting pose. I will cancel the rotation of the controller and then I will rotate it backward so that the heel is currently touching the ground, first. As you can see those rotation from the side view only affect the X rotation channel of this controller. I will flatten the foot, couple of frame after the contact pose by pressing Alt + R in the 3D view. When the heel touch the ground the foot get flat pretty fast. It's now refined a bit to curve. I will slightly offset the beginning of the raising of the heel to frame 16, and I will make it lean forward a little more on frame 43 so that we have some dragging of the front toes while the foot is moving forward. This will serve as our base motion. And from there, I will just adjust the amplitude of the curve, making the contacting pose a bit wider. Then, I will adjust the roll of the foot forward. So, I will slightly increase frame 43 amplitude. So that the food is bending backward a little more. I am basically slightly pushing the poles by pushing those curves up by contrasting the curve, as we have seen just before. Now, I'd like a bit of a kicking motion whenever the foot is reaching its forward position by simply duplicating the extreme key down and offsetting it back by a couple of frame. It's a bit like when we are holding the foot up in the air before it touches the ground. It brings a bit of contrast. It make it a little more mechanical. From there, it's just a matter of tweaking the curve Can spend your whole lifetime adjusting those curve without getting a perfect motion. But with a couple of adjustment and a bit of dragging, we can get a satisfying motion. Here, I feel like the foot is too close to torso, so I will select my torso controller and offset the whole D curve on the y-axis in the graphic (indistinct). This is one of the cool thing about this method is that we can play with the different channels to adjust the animation. I have a slight clipping between the torso and the thigh that I will probably fix later on. If needed, you can also adjust the foot position and the timing whenever it's falling compared to the body motion. Here, I'm slightly offsetting the timing of the foot so that it cleanse slightly sooner. And so that then the torso is falling. So this is the kind of thing I will continue on tweaking during the animation. The idea is to get the torso route right, and the feet right before going on. In the next video, we will animate the toes.

## 04-04-03 Toes

It's now time to bring some details to our feet by moving the toes. Again, it's gonna be pretty straightforward since we already have the base motion of our foot. We'll first work on the front toe controller, and I will try to find the movement the foot is leaving the ground and duplicate the key Frame. Dissuade the toe will remain flat on the ground, from Frame zero to Frame 30 foot. I will set the end-all type two vector for this new key frame. Go a little further in the animation, and simply rotate the toes backward so that they will drag during this motion. I will then adjust the end (indistinct) of the first key frame, so that it doesn't clip with the ground whenever the foot is going backward. Then I will adjust to dragging motion as the foot is moving forward. I want the toes to point downward because of its weight, but also because of the forward motion of the foot. She's the kind of motion we have practiced with this key role. Whenever we were moving the limps, we were making the hands and the feet dragging. As we are done with this, we can go forward to the compacting frame, where we will make the toe raising. As the foot fall down, the toes are still dragging or there is a full of full motion. So there are pointing up (indistinct) emphasis the flap of the foot. So as the foot is getting flat on the ground, I will make sure that the toes are almost at their highest position. And then two frame letters, I will make the toes flat on the ground. Here, I will slightly offset the foot roll controller by one frame at back. I will then re-adjust the toe extreme position just before it hits the ground to frame 60. I will go to frame letter and press Alt+ R in the 3D view, to flatten the toe on the ground. Whenever I create a contacting post, I generally set the end-all type two vector. As the current motion, is kind of stop brutally as it hits the ground. So there is no easing before the curve gets flat. (indistinct) tell that will make the difference is to create a slight bounce of the toe, when it hits the ground. To do so, I will duplicate the current key frame, and move it two to four frame later. And we then duplicate the post key frame, lower rate and put it in between. This way, we have a more clunky motion, and we finally get something that looks like an animation for the foot. It's indeed a robot, but we are kind of briefing life into it if you will. From there, we can repeat the process with the back toe. Beware because these toe has two joint. One at the base of the foot on the heel, and one for the current back toe. I will create a motion for the first joint, that really looks like the front toe but in reverse. And I will keep the motion pretty slight. Whenever you are working on a chain of bone, we've Arrow Key, the more you move the roots to more the deep tip, and the other controller we move and it might look a bit too extreme. So keep it subtle. It's easier then to amplify the motion if needed. Remember that you have to make the toe drugging, so whenever the foot is moving forward, each will point backward a little down. And whenever the foot is falling down, this will drag so it will raise. I didn't input any bones on the contact bones, because it was a bit too much since I will input a bit of bouncing, on to the tip of the toe. So on the curve, the back to root is kind of phrasing just before the contact pose, and whenever to contact pose occur, it will flatten on the ground. So I have canceled in your rotation. I've used a Vector and (indistinct) because I don't want anything, but I didn't input any bounds. I did input the bones in motion on the tip, the toes. So on the next joint into the animation. So I did animate the tip of the back toe, as I did for the front toe, making it drug, so that we feel like there is a bit of delay in its motion, and then adding some bounds, as it contacts the ground. Be careful not to make it clip through the ground. When that was done, I repeat the process with the outer side toe. And since the foot is not tilting in space, I could then simply copy the curve of this outer side toe, onto the inner side toe. Again, nothing crazy here. It's pretty simple. So you will be able to watch me kind of animating those toes in the next video, that will be a short time lapse of this process. As all the toes were animated, the foot animation was done, and we now need to copy it onto the other foot. To do so, it's very simple. You just select all the controllers from the left foot we just animated. Open the graph editor, and press Alt+H to make sure that all the curve are available. Press A again to select them all, Press Ctrl+C to copy those curves. Then Select all the right foot controllers. Go on frame zero and press Ctrl+Shift+V. Since our rig is symmetrical, Blender will Paste the curve taking care of the symmetry for us. Now, both foot are moving in the same fashion with the same rhythm. We now just need to offset the motion of the right foot in time so that we get an alternate motion. To do so, simply select all the curve, Press Shift+D and offset them by the whole cycle. In my case, 72 frames. Then I will select again all the curve, and I will offset them back in time by half of the motion, 36 frames. We now have both our feet motion. Since I have now a better vision of the motion, I feel like the foot are two forward. So what I will do is that I will select both foot main controller, isolate the Y Location axis by inputting its name in the Search bar, Select all the available keys for both to (indistinct) location channels. And then I will slightly offset them up on the Y-Axis in the graph editor. This will push both feet backward, and it will look a little more natural. From there, you can adjust the eighth of the up-and-down motion by simply offsetting dizzy curve. You can also scale it on this Y-axis, so that we'll have more up and down motion if needed, or if you scale it down you will reduce the bounciness of the motion. From there, it's really a matter of personal taste and experience to make it look good but you have the whole method. Now we just need to get rid of the unused key frame on the right foot. To do so, we simply need to Select all the controller of the right foots. Go onto the Frame Zero, Press I to insert a key frame on all the channels then Press V and set those new key frame to Free. From there we can get rid off any previous key frame and then, Select all those key frame on Frame Zero. Press Shift+D to duplicate them, and move them on the very last frame of our cycle. Frame 72 for me. Then I can get rid off all the key frame, after this frame 72. Our foot animation is done, the next step, will be to input some left to right motion to the toss or root, and animate a bit the feet.

## 04-05 Side and hips motion

[Instructor] This is the last video to create the base motion of our robot where we will add some side to side motion to the torso and the beat of hips rotation. So I'm starting with the root top. So controller selected and the X location curve available. The motion is pretty simple. When the character is raising one of its leg and putting its weight onto the other, its whole body will shift to towards the foots that is in contact with the ground. So basically if we have a look to the curve the weight will shift to what the robot left side until frame 14 and which is the passing pose where the right leg is in the middle of the robot. On frame 14 to frame 22, the body will slightly move back to the right by the weight of the right foot. And we have an acceleration of the right foot contact the ground and the whole body is falling down. It's also shifting rapidly to wild the new contacting foot transferring it's weight onto it's right leg. Since we have a symmetrical cycle we can then reproduce this motion in the other way. Again, there is not that much more to say and to get this concept about rhythm and weight shifting. It's just a matter of playing with the curve to get the right momentum, to get the right motion. Then with this method, the layer and method, just try to keep your curves as clean as possible. Not adding too much key frames especially if they are useless, is that you can easily tweak and adjust those values later on. When you're happy with the result, don't forget to align the very first key and the very last so that you get a proper cycle. To create the rotation motion of the hips, I've used the same method. I've started from the front view working on the Y axis of the hips. It's the left to right twisting motion. When you are putting your weight onto one leg as you straighten this leg, your hips will raise. So the hips doesn't only react to the weight of the body but also to the contact of the foot on the ground. So we could think that they are following the motion. But they also lead the animation since they are used to pull the foot up. When the robot would be on one foot the hips will tilt towards this foot. And as the opposite foot will leave the ground, the hips will start rotating towards the raising foot. But still farther raising the foot on the ground. And as our robot character hit the ground with the opposite foot, then the hips will rapidly shift to one, the foot that just enter in contact with the ground. And what I did is that I had a little bounce in the curve to create an hip shake that make our robot who came more clunky and robotic. As we did before with the toes. When they was done with that, I worked on the rotation curve. I kept it very simple, just imaging the hips, pulling the foot. So when the right foot is forward and hit the ground into its contact pose, the hips controller is rotating towards the other foot. And has reach it's extreme pose a couple of frame before because it's leading the animation, pulling the feet. So the hips rotate toward the left to pull the right leg and as the right foot contact the ground, the hips has already started rotating the other way a little bit. The next video will be a short time-lapse showing you those steps. I've just explained if needed. And then we will see different techniques on all to use the base motion. We have created to add it to the different parts of the robot.

## 04-06-Constraints

[Pierre] So far, using the layer method we have been able to create the space motion for our robot. But how do we get to this, where every part of the robot are moving in reaction to the body motion? We could use the same method and start with the main body working first on the Z location curve and then on the rotation, and then go ahead with the hips, the head, and everything that is attached to it. But what if we had a solution that would allow us to source the base motion we have created to generate those additional motion, finding method that will allow us to iterate or modify the animation on the fly with ease? We can do it by using a technique I will show you in the next video. But to do so, we need to learn a bit about the base constraints in Blender. I've created a blend file with a couple of objects, including arrows, that will help us identifying the orientation they have. In Blender, We can find the Object Constraint under the Constraint tab. We will find the same constraint for the rig or bones, but we will see that in the next video. The list of constraints is pretty big, but in the end we will just use a few of them. Mostly, the Copy Transform constraint and some tracking constraints. Constraints will allow us to modify the behavior of an object or a bone using another object or another bone. To add the constraint, we can simply select the object, go to the Constraint tab and select, for example, the Copy Location. As I've just added it, we can see that the icon is red. It means that the constraint is currently not working because the owner is not constraint to anything. So we need to choose a target, and I will choose the arrow number one. As soon as I do, we can see our small arrow snapping onto the large arrow. The small rural object is now copying the location or position in the world space of the large arrow. Remember, that as an object, the position or any transform are performed on the origin of the object. And by default, a newly created constraint is using world space for both the target and the owner. This way, whatever we do, the owner will be on top of the target in our scene. If on the single object, we switch to local space to local space, we won't see that much of a difference. Because by default, the local space of a single object is aligned with world space, as we have seen in the local space and world space video. So the only way to see the difference is currently to create a parent to this object. Now, if I switch back the constraint from local space to local space and move the parent, we can see that the object is moving, but it only follow the location of the target. Whenever I rotate it, nothing's happened. If I now switch back from world space to world space, it will override the parenting and the constraint arrow will be snapped onto the target arrow. Let's get rid of the parent, switch back to local space to local space, and use the offset. It will allow us to still be able to move the constraint object, and any transformation generated by the constraint will be added on top of the local space of the object. The Copy Location constraint will only affect location, rotating or scaling the object won't do anything. While if we were parenting the object to the other, then it will follow any transformation the first object does. The other copy constraint behave the same. If I add a Copy Rotation constraint and rotate the object, the other one will follow. But moving it or scaling it won't change anything. And if we had a Copy Scale, I think you've guessed it, moving it or rotate it won't change anything, while scaling will scale both objects. The Copy Transform constraint will currently perform a Copy Location, Copy Rotation, and Copy Scale at the same time. We can no longer move the target unless we switch the Mix mode to Before Original or After Original. But I won't go further into this because we won't need all those options. Some very useful constraints are the tracking constraints. You're already using one which is the Inverse Kinematic constraint, which is a tracking constraint too. But here, we will use other constraints. So I have my arrow object, I have created a target object, let's add a dump truck constraint to our arrow and choose as a target the target object. You can use the eyedropper in the constraint and then source the object directly in the 3D viewport. As soon as we select it, we can see our arrow slightly rotating to point towards it. And as we move the target, our constraint object will follow it. It's a super useful constraint to rig eyes, for example. It's a pretty easy constraint to be used. By default, it will track along the positive y-axis. If we switch to the positive z-axis, we can see our object rotating so that it's positive z-axis point toward the target. If we do the same with the x-axis, the object will shift again. Choosing the minus y-axis will flip our arrow orientation but it will still the pointing at the target using its y-axis. The locked track constraint will kind of behave the same, but this time the object will be all to rotate only on one axis. We still have to define the track axis and the locked axis will be the one we are allowed to rotate around. So in this case, I can see the green arrow pointing toward the target, but the object only rotate around the blue arrows, the z-axis arrows. If I switch the track access to use the positive x-axis, we will see our object shifting and still rotating along its z-axis. This is the constraint I've used to rig the sensor of the robot so that it follows the target. The ring with the sensor and the sphere each have a separated locked track constraint allowing us to animate the sensor by just moving the target. It's the same for the mini gun arm. To summarize, we have seen that we can use constraints to move or transform an object using another one. Constraints will override the parent-child relationship. We can constraint multiple objects using only one object.

## 04-07-Space switching fundamentals

In this video, we are going to use the constraint We've just seen before to animate to different parts of the robot character using the base motion we have created before. To do so we will use a method called space switching. This is an often overlooked technique but it is so powerful. I've been introduced to this technique and learned a lot of things through the Animation Sherpa course by Richard Lico. He's one of the coolest person I know. And beyond that, he's one of the best animators in the game industry. I will just show you the very basic of space switching but if you enjoy it and get comfortable with this animation course, I truly advise you to take his animation course afterward. So let's start with a simple up and down animation. What I'd like to do is make bone B react to bone A having a bit of overlapping animation. And instead of doing it by hand as we did for the bouncing ball or our scleral character we will use constraints. DID is to source the motion of bone B in the work space and slightly offset it in time. Don't worry. This will make sense in a few seconds. Let's select a bone B press shift S and snap the cursor to it. Let's switch to object mode and add an MT. We wanted the MT to behave exactly as bone B to do so I will select the MT, go to the constraint panel add a copy location panel and source the armature. Then I will select the bone B. Now our MT is following the bone B in space. It is coping it's location in ward space and I can no longer move it, but we don't have any animation information we can play with, the graph editor is empty. So what we need to do is to comfort the current motion of the MT that is due to the constraint in an actual animation. And we can do this through baking. To do so let's just have our MT selected press F3 and search for bake. We will choose the first one object animation, bake action. The bake action panel will open. Here we can set the length of the action we want to bake from frame zero to frame 25. I always used visual keying, so that I'm sure that all constraints are applied when writing the action, and we want to get rid of the constraints. So I will enable clear constraints. I won't choose override current action since our MT don't have any action yet. As I press okay Blender will get free of the constraint and I do now have an action input into my graph editor. If I played the animation, I can see that the MT is kind of following bone B but it's no longer constrained to it. It's animation is just similar as bone B. I will clean up the channel I don't need, and keep this delocation on. Now we have data. We can edit. We can offset the key frame or edit them. And since those animation data are assigned to a single object, they are using world space. While bone B has no motion in its local space, it is not animated. It's just following bone A, our MT does have an animation but it is visually doing exactly the same thing as bone B. Now to see the power of space switching let's select our MT. In the curve, press shift E add a cyclic modifier. You find now select all the keys press G and X and offset them a bit in time. You can see that now the MT seems to have a formal through animation compared to bone A. So if I now select my armature going to pose modes like bone B. We can access the bone constraint. So be very careful. We are not constraining the armature object, but the bone. So we need to go into the bone constraint not the object constraint. From there, we can add a copy location constraint and then source the MT. Now bone B will follow the motion or the location of the MT. From there, we can press F3 and search for bake or in my case, I've added the bake action functionality to my quick favorite so I can press the Q key to access it. I will use the same option visual keying and clear constraint and I will add overwrite current action. Now bone B is no longer a constraint but it's following the same motion as the MT. We can now get rid of MT and shape the curves of bone B. All channels have been written but only the Z axis channel is interesting for us. You have just performed your first space switching exercise. Let's now see what we can do with copy rotation. In the example file, you will find a second collection with the copier rotation example. It's a simple chain of three bones. With bone A being animated. It's a simple backend for rotation on its X axis. Bone B and C are simple children without any animation. Let's go back into object mode and add two MTs. For the sake of presentation, I will add on the first MT a copy, transform from bone B. Go to the constraint, add the copy transform. Source the second armature and bone B. Now our MT is snapped onto bone B for the second MT. I will add a simple copy rotation and so it's the same armature and bone C. The first MT is now coping both the location and the rotation of bone B. But in the end, what is interesting for us is only the rotation. If I was to isolate the motion of the first MTs that is also copying the location, he will be rotating as the one above, but it can be a bit confusing to see only the rotation of the MT whenever the bones are currently childs of another one and their location is also changing. But in this case, we will only affect their rotation. So I will switch to a simple copier rotation and so it's bone B. And I will select both MT, press my Q shortcut and bake the action. Now both the MTs have lost their constraint but we have animation that. So we can now use those two MTs to constraint bone B and bone C. But first let's make sure that we have all the curves selected for both MTs, press shift E and make cycle. Now let's select the armature go into pose mode, select bone B, go to the constraint panel, add a copy rotation constraint and source the first MT. Big mistake here. We've added the constraint on to the object as explained before we need to use bone constraints. So let's add the copy rotation source the first MT select bone C add the new constraint and solves the second then from there, when we played the animation nothing changed since those two bones copying the rotation of something that was coping their rotation previously. But if I now offset to curve of the first empty by one or two frames, you can see the chain of bones changing. And if I now also offset the second MT by three or four frame, I will get an overlapping motion of my whole chain. So the idea is to offset by one or two frame, the first MT, then the next one by one or two additional frame. So three to four frames and we'd get our overlapping motion for free. From there, we can select the armature go back into pause mode, select both constraint bone, and bake the action and choose overwrite current action. And we can get rid of MTs. And then we have our animation done. Let's see a first example. We've aimed space. I have the sweeping motion, but I don't want B and C to get through this plane to create the trucking constraint. We need first to add a couple of MTs. And then to those MTs we will add a copy transform so that they follow each bone. So I will source bone B for the first one and bone C for the second one this way both MTs are perfectly aligned with each of their targets now to be able to get rid of the constraint, but keep those transform. We can press control A and choose visual transform. I will do this for both MT and get rid of their constraints. But the cool thing is that now they are transformed channel as the same transformation as bone B and bone C, but in ward space. So if I go into my MTs properties editor and switch to arrows as a way to display them, you will see that there are now aligned with bone B and bone C. They are sharing both the same orientation and position in ward space. We now need to offset them. So I will switch the pivot point to local with both of them selected press G and moved them on the Y axis so that they are still align with bone B and C, but they are further away on their local Y axis. Now for them to follow the motion of bone B and C I need to make them become child of those boards. And we can use a new constraint such as the child of constraint. It's a very handy constraint that will make the owner behave as if it was a child of the target, as a target let's source the armature. And then bone B, we can see that the MT got offset just click set, inverse to reset its position. And let's repeat the process with bone C and the second MT, solve the armature. Choose bone C and click set inverse. Now, if we play our animation, we can see both those MTs. Following both bones, let's select both MTs and bake the action or bake the animation. As before, whenever we are baking the action, we can choose to remove the constraint and we can see our MTs still following the motion but now they do have an emission data. We don't need any rotation or scale here so we can get treated of the rotation and scale curve. You don't need to do it. It's just to keep the graffiti top cleaner. Now, go back on the armature in post mode go to the bone's constraint select dumped truck constraint and source the first MT. Then repeat the process with bone C, add dump truck constraint and source the second MT. When we played the animation as usual nothing special happened, but if I select the first MT press shift E to make all the curve cyclic and then offset them by one or two frame, we can see our bone chain offset. And if I repeat the process with the second MT, but offset it by two frame. Now you can see the chain animated with a bit of overlap. It seems that the make cycle function didn't work on this curve. So I will fix this. Now, if I want my chain to avoid getting through or clipping with the plane we have created, I can simply work on the curves or the animation of the different MTs. So I will select the first MT, and work on it's Z location curve. I will try to spot the key where it goes under the ground and I will select the key and offset it a bit on the Y axis in the graffiti. It also is that it gets a little we then go further whenever it's leaving the ground and I will duplicate the frame I've just adjust on top of this one. Those two keys represent our ground level and I can get rid of any keys that goes under these labels. I can now repeat the process with the second MT isolate to see location curve spot, the moment where it goes on the ground then align its position with the ground. Go even further duplicate the key frame and get rid of any keys that are under this label. And when I played the animation now, it seems that this whipping motion is stuck to the ground. Then as usual, we can go back onto our bone chain and bake the action. And if there are any glitches in the animation, you can remove a couple of frames to get a smooth transition. Using aim space is a super powerful workflow. Don't worry if you get to be close to at first we will repeat this process a lot of time on the robot and you will get very familiar with it. Now, in the last example, we will see all we can combine a both the copy location or location switch with this in space. To do so I've created another armature with another animation. It's a simple up and down motion, with have a little bounce, so it's pretty close to what we have between the body and the cannon of our robot. We will start with the location offset with my bone B selected. I will press shift S to snap the cursor to it and add an MT. To this MT I will add a copy location constraint sourcing the armature and the bone B. Now the MT is following the motion of the bone B in ward space. I can press my Q key to get to my quick favorite and bake the action. I can get rid of all the curve, but the Z location curve. Press shift E and add a cyclic modifier. From there I can slightly offset the curve in time by one or two frames to get a nice overlap in motion. I will then select back my armature, go into pose mode go into the bone constraint, add a copy location, so it's the MT and now bone B, get this overlapping motion. I can press Q and bake the action. I won't delete the MT because we will need it to currently create the aim space constraint. So the first thing to do is to align the MT on the bone. So let's add a copy transform concentrate to the MT and source as a target to bone B. Let's press control A and apply the visual transform. We can get rid of the copy, transform constraint. And if we want, we can go to the MT option and switch to arrows to see that it is oriented the same way as the bone. I will offset it along its local Y axis. And now we need to add a child of constraint to it, sourcing the bone B. Click set inverse to reset its position. And it's now following the motion of bone B as if it was a child of it. Let's bake this animation. We can cleave the curve if we want, getting rid of the curve that doesn't have any animation. Then press shift E and make the current curve cycle. Then we can use E to constraint the bone B, using a dump truck constraint. If we now select back the MT, an offset it's curved in time we will have a bit of follow through animation in the rotation. So we have offset the motion of the bone B using a location offset and now also using a dump truck constraint. The cool thing about the dump truck constraint is that it's very easy to smooth a curve. If, for example, I don't want that much bounce onto my bone B and I want a smooth transition as if it was very heavy. I can get rid of some key frames offset to beat the lower key and it will still follow the original motion of the bone B location wise. So the base of the bone is still have pretty crispy and sharp bones while it's steep, that is pointing to what the target or the MT get a smooth sort of motion. The last thing we haven't seen regarding any constraint is that we can reduce the interference of the constraint. If I want to reduce the amplitude of the rotation of the bone B. It would have worked the same with any other influence, such as the location constraint the bounce would be the same but with a lower amplitude. From there, we can bake the current action on to the bone B. Don't worry if you're a bit lost at first just try to redo the exercise you've just seen. We will repeat this a lot through this chapter. So you will get familiar with this technique very fast Learning those techniques will become a huge time saver for you later in the course. To summarize, we have seen that we can use constraint and animation baking to source data from a specific motion and transferred them on to another bone or another object. We can use copy location and copy rotation to create nice follow through animation with ease. We can have even more control upon rotation of the target using tracking constraint such as dumped truck constraint. We can use multiple constraint to create complex mechanism in a few clicks. And finally, we can use the influence of the different constraint to add more or less amplitude to the motion we are creating.

## 04-08-01-Mech space switching - Body

[Instructor] In this video, we are going to work on the body secondary motion using space switching. We will work where we have left before with our base body motion done. The hips are slightly rotating. We will start by working on the body part of the character. To help yourself, you can go into the armature option, viewport display and display the names and axes. Screen controller axis will help us kind of guessing which axis we need to use when working with aim space. Let's press Control + Tab to switch back to object mode and I will press then Shift + A to add an empty. To make sure that we see the empty whatsoever, we will go into the object option of the empty and we will activate in the viewport display the in front option. Finally, to be sure that we are not selecting the different parts of the robot, we can disable the selectability by clicking the mouse cursor icon. If you can't find it, make sure that it's enabled in the filter menu. We will start by working on the up and down motion of the body. So with my empty selected, I've added a copy location to it. The target will be our MECH Armature and the bone will be the body controller. We can set the baking frame range directly during the baking. But to make our life easier, I will set the end of the animation to frame 72 since our cycle goes from frame zero to frame 72. Then pressing Q to access my quick favorite, I will choose bake action. You can access it by pressing F3 and searching for bake and I advise you to create a quick favorite since we will use this command all the time. Enable visual keying, clear constraint and press OK. Now we do have animation that are for our empty following the motion of the body. With all its curves selected, I will press Shift + E and make it cycle. From there, we need to use this empty to constraint the body controller of our robot. Select the armature, go back into pose mode, select the bone, go into the bone constraint, add a copy location and source the empty. Now I can get out of pose mode, select the empty and when I move it, the body follow. In the graph editor, I will offset the animation by two frames. That should be enough. So now we get our follow-through animation of the body. While I like the timing, I feel that the motion is a bit extreme. So I can go back onto the armature, go into pose mode, tweak the influence of the copy location constraint and cut it in half. This way we keep our follow-through animation but with less influence, meaning that we have less amplitude in the motion. So it's a matter of tweaking and testing whatever value fits your animation. When I'm happy with the motion, I will bake it. With my bone selected, I've pressed the Q key to access my quick favorite and choose bake action and I will check the Override Current Action. The body controller is no longer a constraint but it has written all the keyframes needed to have the same animation. We will now use aim space to add a bit of rotation to the body. First, we need to align the empty to the body controller. To do so, you can get rid of the current animation curve but it's not mandatory. What we need to so is to add a copy transform, source the armature and source our body controller. Then in the 3D view, we will press Control + A and apply the visual transform. From there, we can get rid of the constraint. We now need to offset the empty. So I will use the local space axis and as you can see, I need to move forward onto the y-axis. The further you will move the empty, the less influence it will have because we are using location to drive a rotation. So for a given up and down motion, the further I am, the less rotation I will get. So this is something you will have to play with to get used to. In our specific case, we don't really care since we can move the empty after we have baked its motion. But to bake it, we need to make it a child of the body. So I will add to it a child of constraint, source the armature, then source the body bone, click the set inverse option to reset its position. It now follows the body and I can press Q to bake the action. From there, I can select all the curve, press Shift + E and make cycle. For the time being, I will only display the Z location curve and I will jump onto the controller of my body, go to the bone constraint and add a dump truck constraint. As a target, we will source the empty and we can see the body flipped and that's perfectly normal since the y-axis is pointing backward in its positive direction. To fix this, we simply need to choose the minus y-axis as the track. I can now press Control + Tab to get back into object mode, select the empty and play with the z curve, so I will frame the curve and I will offset it by two to three frame. And we now get a bit of rotation in our follow-through motion and that's very cool. What will be nice too is to add a bit of side-to-side motion. So I will head up to the x location curve and I will offset it by only one frame to keep it very subtle. Again, it's a creative process. If you want more left-to-right motion, it's up to you to increase the offset of the curve. But since the weapon are attached to the body, I feel like we may not input too much left to right motion. So from there, I can bake the action on the body. For the time being, then I will always create keyframes on all the transformed channels, including the scale that we don't use. So we can get rid of those. I'm pretty happy with the body motion results, so I will now work on the hips. We have already animated it a bit previously but now I'd like to add a bit of follow-through in its location and also in its up and down rotation. Let's repeat the process. With the empty selected, I will go to the constraint and add the copy location. I will source as the target the armature and as the bone, the hips bone. If you can't find it, it's just further down in the list. From there, we can press Q to access our quick favorite and bake the action of the empty. Then select back the armature, go into pose mode and with the hips bone selected, go to the bone constraint and add a copy location constraint and source the empty. From there, let's exit pose mode by pressing Control + Tab, select DMT, select all its curve, press Shift + E to make it cycle and now I can select the Z location curve by isolating the other ones. And just offset it by a couple of frames. Now again it's a matter of taste and choice. I feel like the amplitude of the up and down motion is a bit too extreme, so I will get back onto the hips bone by selecting the armature, going back into pose mode and in the constraint panel, I will reduce the influence to 0.5 and double check how it looks. I will test at 0.5 and then increase it a bit around 0.6 and since I'm quite happy with the result, I will bake the action by pressing Q, bake action and overwrite current action. We can now refine the rotation of the hips. So I will go back to the empty and hide all the curve and get rid of them. Add onto it a copy transform constraint and then in the 3D view, I will press Control + A and apply the visual transform. We can see that the hips are pointing forward on their local y-axis. So I will move the empty on the y-axis but first, we need to remove the constraint. If you want, you can also enable the axis display of the empty. That should help you to figure on which axis you have to offset it but again, it's the y-axis. We now need to make it a child of the hips, so we will go to the constraint, add a child of constraint, source the armature, source the hips bone and don't forget to click the set inverse button to reset its position. Then we can bake its action and with all the curves selected, press Shift + E and choose make cycle. I will now use a tracking constraint to make the hips rotating but since we have already animated them, rotating from side to side, instead of a dump truck constraint, we will use a locked try constraint and rotate around the x-axis of the hips. With the rig selected, I will get back into pose mode, select the hips, go to the bone constraint and add a locked track constraint. I will source as a target the empty and we want to point on the -y-axis and rotate around the x-axis. With this constraint, we will only have the rotation around the local x-axis of the hips, the up and down rotation. We can go back to object mode and select the empty and offset the Z location curve of the empty. This will create a slight follow-through animation of the hips. I've used a 223 frame of offset. As usual, you can choose the offset you want. You can choose the influence you want and then just press Q and bake the action onto the hips. As I'm done, I will get rid of the scale keyframe because we don't need them. From there, let's move onto the head. We will repeat exactly the same workflow. First, select the empty, get rid of all the curves. Then add to it a copy location constraint, source the armature, then source the head controller. Then press Q and bake the action on the empty. Then go back onto the armature. Select the head controller. Go to the bone constraint, add a copy location, source the empty, go back onto the empty, make all the curves cycling by pressing Shift + E, make cycle and then you can offset the curve to get the follow-through motion. So in the case of the head, I prefer to offset the z-axis only because I don't want to create too much left to right swivel of the head. So I will reset the offset of the curve, then select only the Z curve and offset it by two or three frame later in time. Then I will select the x location curve and I will offset it by only one frame to get a bit of delay or follow-through motion on the left to right axis but not as important as the up and down. Try not to overdo all those follow-through motion or your robot will really look very clanky. So it might be a look you are aiming for but if you want to make it robust, don't overdo all those follow-through motion. When I'm happy with the timing of this follow-through, I can play with the influence of the constraint to reduce the amplitude of the motion. So it seems I was happy with an influence of 0.6 for the head motion. So from there, I will get into pose mode and press Q to bake the action of the copy location constraint onto the head bone. Now, we will switch to aim space to add a bit of rotation. So I will select the empty, get rid of all the curves, add a copy transform constraint. As a target, I will choose the armature and the head bone. Then in the 3D view, I will press Control + A and choose visual transform. Get rid of the constraint. Offset the empty on the y-axis. Then we need to add to it a child of constraint. So I will select it, go to the constraint, add the child of, source again our rig, the head bone controller. Set inverse to reset its position and bake the action of the empty. Now the empty's following the motion of the head. Now we can select the head, add a dump truck constraint, source the empty and then flip the bone constraint to the -y-axis. I will select back the empty, make all the curve cycle and isolate the Z location curve. I will offset it by four frame to get enough amplitude of motion but now what I'd like to do is to smooth the curve. We will have a smoother rotation of the head that will looks way heavier but will also make the robot look more robust. If you want to have more amplitude in the motion, what you can do is switch the curve editing pivot point to bounding box and scale it on the y-axis. This will slightly increase the up and down motion of the empty and the rotation of the head. Now I will try to spot these little bounds in the curve. You can then duplicate one of the keys or add a key manually and to get a smooth result, I will select all the keys, press V to set them to auto clamped. From there, it will be pretty easy to smooth the curve. We just need to get rid of some of the keys. Just keep the keys that are on the extreme. Since our handle are all set to auto clamped, whenever we get rid of a keyframe, Blender will automatically try to keep the curve as smooth as possible without changing the extreme values. So from there, you can try to simplify the curve. You can edit it, moving the keys a little lower or a little higher if you want a bit more motion. Just make sure that the curve cycle on 72 frame, meaning that the very first and very last keys must be the same and don't be afraid to fail. If you fail, you just need to rebake the curve. So with this process, you can be very creative for free. So from there, what I wanted is just to add a very subtle left to right motion. So I've slightly offset the X location curve of the empty so that the head is dragging a bit left to right. I used like one or two frame offset. When you're happy with the result, as usual, select back the armature, go back into pose mode and with the head bone selected, just bake the action and then clean any keyframes that is unwanted, like on the scale channel, for example. I hope you're getting more familiar with the space switching process. In the next video, we will do all the remaining pieces of the robot the same way.

## 04-08-02-Mech space switching - secoundary

[Instructor] In this video, we will continue on using space switching to finish the animation of our character. I will slightly speed up the video since it's going to be very repetitive based on what we have done just before. We will start with the antenna. They can only rotate on one axis and they can't move. So we will directly use a tracking constraint. First, we need to align our empty, so we add a copy transform. We source one of the antenna, apply the visual transform, get rid of the constraint and then offset the empty on the y-axis. Then add to it a child of constraint, source the rig and source one of the antenna, click the set inverse and bake the animation. From there, select the first antenna, add a locked track constraint, source the empty. The track axis is positive y and we want to rotate around the x-axis. From there, we can get rid of all the undesired channels. Make the Z location curve cycling and offset it by a couple of frames. Then you can play on the influence of the constraint if you want to reduce the amplitude of the motion. Remember that offsetting the curve will change the timing and changing the influence of the constraint will change the spacing or the amplitude of the motion. From there, we can bake the action onto the bone, get rid of the useless transform channels and since both antennas were originally aligned, we can directly constraint the big antenna with the empty. Just go back into pose mode on to the armature, select the antenna, go into the bone constraint, add a locked track constraint, source the empty, track with y, rotate along x and check the animation. Since this antenna is slightly bigger, it will have a bit more motion and I've also decided to offset the empty curve by one additional frame. This way, the big antenna will be slightly delayed compared to the motion of the small antenna. And we will have a more interesting motion. Then I've baked the action and cleaned my curve. Now that the antennas are done, I will unhide all the controllers, select my visibility property bone and display the arms and we will work on both arms. The idea is to input a slight rotation delay on the shoulders of the robot. To do so, we will again use aim space and a locked track constraint. I will first align my empty by adding to it a copy transform constraint. To work a little faster, I've just copied the name of the arm controller. This way, when I'm adding the copy transform constraint to the empty, I can source the rig and then just paste the name in the bone field. As the empty is now aligned with the arm controller, I will apply the visual transform, then get rid of its constraint and offset it on the x-axis on the side. Then as usual, I will add a child of constraint, source the armature, then the arm.r, click the set inverse to reset the position and bake the action. I will get rid of the useless curve and then for the remaining one, I will make them cycle, pressing Shift + E, click make cyclic. Then we will get back to our controller, go to the bone constraint and we need to add a locked track constraint pointing toward the negative x-axis and rotating around the y-axis. So in the constraint, I will source the empty, choose the track axis minus X and choose the locked axis y-axis. Now I believe that you do know the process. Whenever I move the empty, the arm will follow. So I can offset the animation curve of the empty and then bake back the motion. Don't hesitate to play a bit with the animation curve of the empty. If you scale it on the y-axis using the bounding box, you will increase the amplitude of the motion. Don't hesitate to experiment again. If you fail, you just need to rebake the motion. So as I'm happy with the result, I will bake the action onto the arm right controller, get rid of the transform channels that are useless and I will repeat the process on the left arm and also the connection between the rocket launcher and the left arm. So I will leave you there with a little time lapse and we'll go ahead at 7:54. (tranquil music) Now we can work on the mini gun. It has already a track mechanism. So we can go ahead with a simple copy location of the empty, source the mini gun target and bake the motion. As the action is baked on the empty, I will select the mini gun controller, add a copy location constraint and source the empty. As we did for the head, I'd like to remove a bit of the bounce we have on the Z location axis for the mini gun because it looked like it's not very controlled by the robot. So having a bit of follow-through motion is okay but too much make it looks like it's very clanky and not a very reliable weapon. So what I'm doing, I'm first smoothing the Z location curve of the empty. Getting rid of the bumps. And since we have two up and down motion over the 72 frame, I can work on half of this curve and then remove the second half. The cyclic modifier will take care of repeating the curve seamlessly. So what you need to understand is the time you will save using this method for this kind of motion. We will use space switching later in the course to smooth some animation but for this kind of robotic motion, that's so handy. I will repeat the process on the X location curve to kind of remove a bit of the noise we have in the motion. So this time, I will have to work on the whole curve because the left to left motion uses the 72 frame of the whole cycle to be performed. The idea is just to get rid of the few glitches we have on the curve. What is so powerful about aim space and this technique is that even if the root of the mini gun, the point where it is attached is very shaky because we add a lot of noise and secondary motion, if we have a smooth motion of the target, then the tip of the gun will have a very smooth motion and so you can create very complex animation with ease while that will be almost impossible to counter animate in a classic fashion. For the rocket launcher cap motion, I will simply use a locked track constraint. It's gonna be the usual process, so I will repeat it for you. First, we need to add a copy transform to the empty, apply the visual transform, get rid of the constraint, offset it, in this case, on the y-axis, add a child of constraint. As a target, choose the armature and the cap controller, set inverse and then bake the action. Get rid of the useless curve. Again, you don't need to do it. I prefer to do it for demonstration purpose. Then onto the controller, add a locked track constraint. From there, I get back onto the empty and make the Z curve cycling. Offset it in time and see happened. The only little difference here is that our controller has already a constraint that belong to the rig. So this time when I will bake the action, I will uncheck the clear constraint box. It will bake the action as usual but now I can manually get rid of the locked track constraint without losing the original constraint that has been put there by your lovely rigger. The last step is to work on our artillery piece, so using the visibility bone, I will enable the visibility of the artillery. It can move up and down and rotate a bit. So what we will do is that we will first use our copy location constraint to create the up and down follow-through motion and then a tracking constraint to get the rotation. With my empty selected, I've added a copy location constraint. I've sourced the armature, then sourced the artillery pivot controller and baked the action. We can then reverse the constraint, meaning that I will select the controller, add a copy location constraint and source the empty. Now I feel like I've repeated this enough but I will go ahead either way. I will slightly offset the Z location curve just after I've made it cycling. I like the result, so I will bake this action onto the controller. So I need to select my armature, select the controller, click bake action and this time, I can get rid of the constraint by checking the clear constraint option. Let's now work in aim space. So I will select back the empty, add to it a copy transform constraint to align it with the controller of the artillery piece. Then as usual, I will apply the visual transform, get rid of the constraint and offset it on the y-axis. Then we need to add a child of constraint, source the armature, source the artillery pivot controller, click the set inverse to rest the position and bake the action. Then I need to use a locked track constraint onto the artillery since it can only rotate around its x-axis and the forward axis will be -y and the rotation axis will be x. From there, I will repeat the process I did on the mini gun. I want to show that this piece of artillery is very heavy. So I don't want too much glitches and too much bounces onto its animation. Since we are using the up and down motion, we can work on half of the curve and then what I will do is that I will remove as much keys as needed to smooth the curve and get a very smooth motion of the tip of the artillery cannon. Again and again don't hesitate to remove keys. Don't hesitate to fail because you can just rebake the action and start over again. That's very fast. It's a very iterative process until you get to the results you want and that's a very easy process. So in a way, that's very creative. What is super interesting about this piece is again the root or the pace of the artillery is shaking a lot while the tip of the artillery will be moving in a smoother fashion. This bring a lot of texture to your animation. And while it can be very subtle, all those little variation in the motion of your character will make this robot believable. And while it's a piece of machinery, it's also a way to put life into this character. What makes it alive is that this robot is communicating something. Weight, strength, power, that's some kind of dreadful character we have here. So as we are almost done with this animation, take the time to watch it entirely. I feel like the head motion is a bit too strong. So what I can do now is simply take the head controller and reduce the amplitude of the curve I want. In this case, I feel like the up and down motion is a bit too strong. So I will head up to the Z location curve and I can see that my 2D cursor is currently aligned with the value zero, which means no motion. So I can switch to the 2D cursor pivot and scale the curve down on the y-axis and it will reduce the amplitude of the up and down motion of the head. And since we've baked all the motion of all the other parts in their local space and they are kind of attached one to the other, whenever we modify one piece in this way, the other follow. So if I want, I can select the cap of the rocket launcher and increase the amplitude of the rotation and get more motion. I can also offset the whole curve on the y-axis and change the whole orientation of the cap. And here we are, in a very short time, we were able to animate this full character with a lot of variety, texture and interesting motions.

## 04-09 Rocket Shot

In this video, we are going to animate the rocket shot. The main difficulty is to isolate the motion of the rocket from the walk cycle. Let's get started. First thing I'm going to do is to make sure that our walk cycle is currently cycling. So I will display all the bones. I will go into the Graph Editor. Click the Show Hidden option. Press Alt+H to make sure that all the curves are displayed and then I will press Shift+E and Make Cycle. I will then set the end of my animation to an arbitrary value of 400 frames because I don't know yet how long it will take to the rocket to touch or hit the cube further away. Now we have a looping walk cycle. So let's go ahead and work on the rocket shot. (rockets whooshing) The first thing we can do is to display our rocket layer in the rig. We will have a controller for our rocket. I will select the very first one on the top left corner. And I will get rid of all the key frames but the very first. Then I will go on frame This is again, pretty arbitrary. The idea is to set this key frame as being the beginning of the shooting animation. It's a lot better to have a few frames in the beginning so that our brain can analyze what's happening. Like, the robot is walking and then shooting. It is if we were creating some staging for this shooting animation. Add a key frame on frame 40. Now, using Local Space, I will go on frame 50 and I will get the first rocket out, moving it along it's Y-axis. If we now frame our curve or zoom on it we can see there is a repetition because of the cyclic modifier we added in the beginning of the video. So I will select all my rocket curves, press Shift+E and choose Clear Cyclic. We can see that all the curves are straight and flat while the Y-curve is slightly bending downward. We can hide all the curve, but the Y-curve so that we can work on the forward motion of the rocket while it's getting out with ease. We just scale up the initial key frame handle so that we get more easing whenever the rockets start to get out of the rocket launcher. And then I will just go to a further key frame again, arbitrary and move the rocket further away. The idea here is not to build the motion but to show you the current issue we have. The rocket is a child of the rocket launcher. Hence it inherits any motion from the rocket launcher. So we will need to find a way to isolate the rocket from the rocket launcher. We'll delete the last key frame I have created so that we just stick with the two key frames where the rocket is getting out of the rocket launcher and stop. I will rotate the tip of the curve handle so that we don't have any easing out of the rocket. From there, we will need to use space switching to be able to animate the rocket. So I will go back into Object Mode and add an Empty. In the Object Display option I will make sure that it shows In Front. (rockets whooshing) The idea is to bake the motion of the rocket while it's getting out of the rocket launcher, on the Empty. So on our Empty let's add a Copy Transform Constraint. Source the armature, and then source the ROCKET-1 bone. And when the Empty is constrained we can bake the action, choosing the Initial Frame as being frame 0 and ending on the current frame of frame 50. We'll press Q to get to my Quick Favorites. Choose "Bake Action." As usual, enable Visual Keying and Clear Constraint and set. You can check the Override Current Action, even if there is no action for the Empty. Blender will create one. Set the Start Frame to 0 and the End Frame to 50. We can get rid of the Scale Transform Channels since we won't be using them. And if we now play the animation, we can see the Empty following the rocket. Now, the idea is to reverse the constraint so that the rocket is constrained by the Empty. So I will select my rocket controller, go to the Bone Constraint add a Copy Transform Constraint and solve the Empty. And now the rocket is following the Empty motion. Since the Empty motion has the same motion as the rocket initially it will fall, but since the Empty is not the child of the robot, we can move the rocket freely or we can move the Empty freely. So now it's just a matter of creating the animation using the Empty. What I want to do for this rocket launch is to have it in two-time. First, they get out of the rocket launcher as if they were pushed away and then they will fall. The little wings will open and then the rockets will fly away. So what I've done is that I've set a first key frame where I want the rocket to kind of fall. And then the next key frame is where the rocket will hit our cube shape. Since it's a pretty simple motion just work with pose extremes as if you were animating a regular character. We just set the first extreme which is the "down" pose of the rocket and the next one which is when it hits the target. From there we will just tweak the curve to get the right motion. Again, now, it's a matter of creative process. If you want the rocket to go straight forward to the target, you can do it. I do like the idea that the rocket gets shot in two-time. First, it gets out. Then the wing opens and then it goes toward the target. I think it adds a more interesting rhythm to the animation. And while I'm recording this video I'm planning to use them to create the teaser for the course. And I want to launch three rockets so that it will bring us even more rhythm. I have the shot going in three parts. The rockets gets out, then it falls, and then it flies away. And I will kind of multiply that three-times, using three rockets. Animation-wise, what I did is that there is a slight slowing down on the Y-axis of the rocket, so that it kind of floats before the reactor of the rocket ignites. And then it accelerates on the Y-axis until the impact. This is why I'm using vector handles on the very last key frame so that we are sure we don't get any easing in the last position. In the end, I spent most of the time tweaking the rotation curve to get the rocket pointing at the target. While we could use Aim Space, with a Tracking Constraint, you could add an Empty object onto the cube and use it to add a Don't Track Constraint on the Empty that is used to manipulate the rocket. That could save you a bit of time. But in the end, this is not a very complex animation. We are manipulating only one rotational axis. So it's a good exercise to do it by hand, too. So I will let you there until the end of the video. You can double check the curves on the example file, but at this stage you should be able to animate this on your own. Don't forget to then get back to the rocket and deploy the little wings using the Rotation Controller. I will see you in the next video where we will shoot with the artillery cannon. (somber electronic music with rising piano progression) (music fades)

## 04-10 ARtillery shot

[Pierre] In this video, we are going to create the artillery shot animation. Again, we will rely a lot on the space switching to achieve it. We can start from our cling action and duplicate it. The idea is to have our robot standing with its two feet planted in the ground. I've renamed the action and I will click the little shield icon to make sure that I won't lose the animation. Since the rotation range of the cannon is a bit limited, I will also select the head of the character and slightly rotate it back. The process is the same as for the walk cycle. I will first create a base motion and then we will propagate each using space switching. The shot is a very fast action, so I will jump on frame four and I will pull back the recoil control. What I noticed while playing the animation is that it was repeating, there is probably a cycling quantifier. So I will select all the keys of all the controllers and press shift E and clear cyclic. From there. I will directly jump into the graph editor and I we'll work on the curve of the record controller. Since it's kind of an instant motion I will select the first key frame of the recalling controller and convert it to vector. The idea is that the controller is pushed back at full speed right at the beginning, the moment where we shoot With the artillery, it gets Very fast to its extreme on frame four. And then I will duplicate the very first frame onto frame 10 so that the controller gets back into its position. Then I played the animation a couple of time and tweaked the curve. In the end, I set the extreme on frame two and reset the position of the controller on frame seven Played the animation a couple of more time, and then decided it was better to sit in final position on frame nine. So we have the base motion of the Canon. Now we need to move the root of the torso of the robot to keep the exercise simple. I will just walk on the Y axis. We've my torso root controller selected. I will directly jump into the graph editor and hide everything but the Y location axis, since the recall controller, or Canon controller reach it's extreme on frame two I will take the very first frame of the route controller and duplicate it on frame two. The ideas that the record motion start when the Canon is pushing the whole body back. Now we can add a key frame on frame 10 and move the curve up so that our character torso is moving back. Then I will reset the pose of The character around frame 23. Again, this is a creative process. If you want, you can use other values. I'm here to teach you in the method, not all to make this specific animation. I will create a more easing on the back position by scaling the curve. And I will make the first angle to be vector because again I don't want any easing into the recoil, the recoil start at full speed. Then it eases into frame with easing onto frame 23. As I watch the motion, I feel like the robot is a bit out of balance, so I will select the whole curve and slightly offset it down. But the character is positioned more forward onto his feet. When he's going to shoot, it's important to watch out for the center of gravity of your character, so that it looks balanced when shooting. And so the shot looks more believable (Wooshing Noises) Before we start animating the head of the character, I will just add a very slight rotation to the Canon. In the end, we will use also space switching to add more emotion to the Canon but the idea is just to have some kind of passive motion or rate. I don't think it's necessary though, but it's very fast. It's just one key frame on frame four or five, to get a bit of rotation back and switch the first handle to vector. Then I will dial the angle by reducing the amplitude of the curve and we are done and we can jump onto the head controller. In this video, we are going to repeat a lot of thing we have done during the walk cycle meaning that we will use a lot of copy location and a lot of end space. The only things that will change is all we offset the curve in time. Instead of creating a delay we will make the curve move back in time so that the head motion occurs before the bud in motion, this way we will fake the fact that the motion is led by the head. First let's work with the location of yet. I've added an empty, I will make sure that it's displayed in front and on the armature in the armature viewpoint display, I will enable names and axis it will just help us identifying the bone with ease Back on my empty, I will add a copy location as usual source our armature, and then the head controller. I will bake the action For this specific animation, I've used 30 frames on it. Then get rid of the user's curve, If you want a gain. It doesn't matter. DMT is following the add motion. Let's now reverse the constraint go to the head bone inputs mode add to it a copy location, constraint and source the empty. We can now get back to the empty and instead of offsetting the curve to the right filtering time we'll offset to the left back in time. And now the head moves before the torso. I will offset it back by one key frame. So is that there is a bit of delay between the shot and the head motion, but the head motions still occur before the torso root motion, as I'm happy with the result I will bake the action onto the head, boom. And now we can work on the head rotation since the Canon is a child of the head whenever the head will rotate, the cannon will rotate too. And I don't really want that because the Canon was supposed to lead the animation. So what I will do is that I will create an aim constraint or tracking constraint for the gun and we will keep this constraint to the end of the animation so that the gun will always be pointing at the same target while we are working on the different part of the robot. So you should know the process now but I will repeat it either way first, add a copy, transform to the empty, then press control-A and apply the visual transform. From there, We can get treated of the copy transform constraint and move the empty on its local Y axis. Then we need to make it a child of the artillery pivot so that it will follow its current motion. So I will select it. Use a child of constraint, source the armature and then the Archer re-pivot controller. We will click setting verse to reset it's position and bake it's action. Now I will select the artillery pivot controller and I will add to it a locked truck constraint targeting the empty. The gun is pointing On it's minus Y axis and rotating around its X axis. As soon as I saw the empty, the gun We'll always aim an empty and whatever the motion of the head cannon will point a DMT. We've the limitation of the hydraulics and the rotation angle of its controller. So we can keep this constraint and now work on the rotation of the head. Since this is something we have done a lot of time I will slightly speed up the video. I've created a new empty I will add to it, a copy transform. Source the armature then source the head controller apply its visual transform and get treated of the constraint. But the trick here is that I won't be upsetting it forward on the y-axis since we don't have any upended motion but I will offset to down. As the body moves back and forth, it's better to get to this pendulum motion based on the Z axis from there the process will be exactly the same as what we did before. During the walk cycle. First, I will add a child of constraint to DMT target the armature. Then you hit controller set inverse. They take the action, then select the head controller add a dumped truck, constraint and target the empty. But this time I will use the minus Z axis of the head controller instead of the minus Y axis. And now I can offset the curve in time. So as usual, you have to experiment, try offsetting to the left so that the rotation will occur before the translation of the head or try the other way, offset the curves to the right so that the head rotation is based on its translation. Plus the position of the target, our empty with variants under or, upon the head will kind of change the behavior sometimes, delaying the curve. We'll make the head kind of moving before it's current translation. Why if DMT was upon the head and we were targeting toward the positive Z axis in the constraint offsetting the curve the same way we'll kind of reversed the head rotation. So you have to experiment the reason, no like golden method try offsetting the curve left to right check out the behavior of the controller. And then just guess all you want to work the final touch here was to edit the empty curve to get a slight overshoot of the head rotation and this loose motion of the rotation. So I've used the baked curve as a guide. And then I reworked the curve by removing most of the key frame and smoothing the curve shape as we did during the walk cycle. So as usual, it's a matter of spending time on to your animation but the location motion of the head is the snap here. And then since the rotation is kind of reacting to this I've made it quite smooth. Now you also want to show that this robot is made to shoot with the artillery. So I bring a bit of smoothness to the motion showing more control than If it was wobbling all around. From there, I've repeated the process for the body controller, the arms, the hips, et cetera this way I've slowly propagated the recoil motion from the gunshot on to the whole body of the character. The final touch was to add a very subtle up and down motion to one of the feet as if the robot was pushed back by the recoil and kind of losing a bit of balance. I've made this motion only on one foot to break the twinning in the animation. and make it look more natural more random in a way to do so. I've just walked a beat on the Hill controller and then animated the front two in reaction. This is very simple. So I will let you there with this animation. And in the next video you will find a slow paced time-lapse of the whole process. This is something we have repeated a lot in the previous videos. So if you don't feel comfortable do not hesitate to rewatch the work cycle process as we are using exactly the same process. And don't forget to check out the axis I'm using depending on the controller, I'm moving for these specific animation regarding the body controllers. I was mostly using in space, downward and space downward on the minus Z axis so that I can source the back and forth motion of the body.

## 04-11-Wiggle-bones

[Instructor] In this video, we will have a quick look to the Wiggle bone add-on. Activated, the add-on gives you access to the wiggle option that has to be activated pair bones. To get the add-on, you can simply check the link into the documentation of the course. A latest version of the Wiggle bone add-on by Steve. Then in blender, simply install it by going into Edit preferences. Add-on, click the install button. Browse and find the .pi file of the wiggle bone add-on. Click the install button and then make sure that the Wiggle bone add-on is activated. There is another add-on called the Spring Bone add-ons by Artel, creator of Auto Rick Pro. But the add-on is still experimental and it only works on chains of parented bones. For this demonstration, I provided one file with two different animation. The sliding and rotating animation called whipping action and a second action with some jumpy bones. Only the lower bone in the chain is currently animated. Let's select the free bones in the chain that are the children of this one and activate the Wiggle bone add-on on this and press the play button. By default, the reset on loop option is activated. To enable or disable this option, you do it for all the bones at once. When using the add-on on the cycle, it's better to disable the option so that the simulation continue at runtime and we don't get the popping frame at the beginning of the motion. Wiggle bone add-on simulate physical behavior on your bone. We can access different properties of those physical behavior through the panel whose properties are editable. Pair bone, let's see in detail the different properties. The amplitude rotation option will increase or decrease the rotation angle of your bones. With my three bone selected, I will enter the value one, hold Alt and press enter. This way, all the selected bones values are set to one. With the value of one, we can see that we almost have no rotation on the bones while if I set it to 180 degrees, you can see that the rotation gets pretty wild. The stiffness value will kind of change the reaction speed of the bone. The higher the stiffness, the more rigidity you are breaking making the bones reacting as if it was a metal spring while with a very low stiffness, it looks more organic like hairs or cloth. So damping value greatly changed the behavior of the bones. The higher the damping value, the more absorption you will have in the motion of the bones. If you drastically decrease the value of the damping, you will have a very jittery bones that will react to any of the motion in the chain. You should keep the damping value between zero and one. If you enter a value beyond one, it will likely creates bugs. And one of the big issues of this add-on is that once the simulation is bugging, you kind of have to revert your file or reload it. So be cautious with this. It's the same for the Stiffness. Don't go over one. You won't have any change of behavior. And at some point, it might bug. In this specific case, changing the translation value won't do anything. And we will see why later in this video. For the time being, let's increase the stretching value. As expected, the bones are now stretching. While it won't generate bugs, I advise you to keep the value pretty low and play in the range of zero to one. The gravity value, as expected, will kind of change the weight of your bones. If you get to a pretty high value, like five or 10, you will see your bones like falling. While using the gravity value in a pretty broad range, I didn't meet any bugs. So as you have understand, you have to be kind of creative and experiment a lot with the different values for the different bones until you get the simulation you want. Convert those simulation into an action or an animation, we need to bake. To be able to bake the action of the bones, you have to make sure that they are selected. By clicking the select wiggle bones button, you will select all the bones that have the wiggle bone option enabled. You've seen in the previous video, baking an animation is done through the NLA editor. When opening the NLA editor, I can see my current weeping action being used. By now, click the bake wiggle button in the wiggle bone panel. It will bake the wiggle simulation on all the selected bones. And we can see that it does create a new NLA track including the weeping action. And on top of this, we can see our new baked action. Let's push it down into the NLA editor. And if we deactivate it, we can see that our bones are no longer rotating. Thus, when we click the bake wiggle, it will remove the wiggle option onto those bone. So what we see are currently the animation of those bones. Additive bake option simply create an NLA track including the original action so that the bake action can be layered on top of it. If we deactivate the additive bake and then bake the wiggle action, we will only see the result of the wiggle. Since the root bone wasn't choosing the wiggle add-on, it's not moving anymore. This, we then need to manually add those action into the NLA editor. When both the weeping action and the baked action are enabled, we can see the whole animation we have generated. So particularly, I advise you to keep the additive bake enabled. I will reset everything and I will select the second animation. The jumping one. As you can see, we have some amplitude on the translation but the bones are not offsetting and this is because they are connected in the rig. So I need to go into edit mode, select those bone and press Alt + P to unparent them or keep them parented but disconnect them. And now we can see that they are getting offsetted based on the translation value. If we increase this value, there will be more jittery and they will move in space a lot more. I advise you to keep this value between zero and one. It's a very powerful tool that can allow you to get very nice results fast but you may need to edit to beat the rig. So let's now try the add-on on our Mac. I've just reloaded the base motion file. We have the work cycle enable in the action editor. I will select the Bodhi controller and I will enable then we go add-on. As soon as I activate the add-on on the Bodhi controller, we can see our character shaking on each step which is kind of cool. I have a drop in performances which is kind of expecting since it's running a simulation in real time but it's definitely okay for me to work on this increasing the Stiffness and the dumping to get a more natural motion or something I like more. But there is a little issue or at least limitation compared to the previous method. Here, I can't choose what part of the body is currently leading. And as you can see, whenever the character is dropping down, the front part is dropping down also. So it's the back part of the body that is currently dragging in the motion. So Blender kind of assumed that the back part of the body is currently heavier than the front part which is not what I did in my animation previously. And this is not something I can change. I have no option to deal with this. It depends on the base orientation of the bone in the rig. But as an animator, you may not want to edit the rig. Whenever you want to use this, you will break everything for sure. And another big limitation is that we can't constraint one rotation angle. Here, you can see that the antenna is currently rotating along all its axis even if the axis are locked. So this is a fantastic add-on but if you want to create precise animation or precise motion along a specific axis, it might not be the best choice but for any organic propose, it can be a huge time saver.

## 05-01-Introduction

[Narrator] Welcome to chapter five. This is the first chapter where we are going to animate a humanoid character. We will use some of the techniques you've learned in the previous chapter to make a first run cycle. You may think it's weird to start with a run cycle, while we haven't learned to walk, but runs are easier to animate than a walk cycle. In this chapter, I will also introduce you to a new character rig we are going to use until the end of this animation course. Even if you want to jump into the further chapter, I advise you to at least watch this video. We will go over some reference analysis, as well as some zero recall video about rotation and how they work in (indistinct). Welcome to this new chapter and let's get started.

## 05-02-Rig presentation

Let me present to you the new character we will be using called Tridents. You will find in the chapter five file folder, the file called Trident rig final. It's a new character rig that is quite more complex that one we add before. Fortunately, the UI has been properly organized by my friend, Fin. If you don't get this specific UI, just open the text editor, open the TRIDENT_riggy.py search for the file in the library and press the play button. The register option under text should be enabled. You will find a UI that is very close to what we add from the squirrel character and the Mac, allowing us to show our ID, the different controllers of the character. Starting with the root bone as usual. But before, let's have a look at the outliner. We have a master collection called Trident character, including two secondary collection. One including the rig and the other including the different parts of the character. The character himself, but also the weapons he has. By default, the character is shaded in solid mode, showing its diffuse texture. You can switch to previous mode to see the full rendered character. If at some point you see a bright pink color, it means that one of the texture is lost. All the character's textures can be find in the textures folder of chapter five folder. The texture path is set to relative, so if you keep your blend file close to the texture folder, you will never lose them. Let's have a look to the rig. For this rig, I've created two different roots. One master and a secondary root. It can be useful in certain cases. Let's have a look to the torso. We have a master controller as for our squirrel character and then the controller for the hips and a controller for the chest. You will also find a controller for the neck and the head. All those controllers can be freely rotated, scaled, or translated. When activating the torso tweak layer, you will be able to access those yellow round controllers. These are tweaker bone that will allow you to modify the shape of each joint of the character. It's perfect to fix some poses or create squash and stretch effects. All the yellow controllers on the character are tweaker bones. This torso tweak layer also give you access to secondary controller of the torso that uses a forward kinematic for each joint. Splitting the hips controller into two parts, the chest controller into three parts, the neck and head in one part each. The face layer will give you access to the main face controllers, including the jaw, the nose, the mouth, the cheek that can be moved individually to shape the face of the character at will. The eyes and eyebrow of the character have automated shapes. They can be moved up and down or on the local y-axis to get to different shape, like a happy face a frown, a surprise, following you to rapidly create different stereotyped expressions for your character. The face secondary, will give you access to all the face tweaker bone. Allowing you to shape the eyes at will, rework the brow shape to draw whatever you want. By default, the legs of the character use inverse kinematic mechanism, meaning that if you move the foot, the knee will automatically bend. It's the same behavior we had with the squirrel character controllers. The poles controller will allow you to orientate the knee at will. There is also a forward kinematic layer and we will see or we can switch from inverse to forward kinematic a little later on. You will also find our yellow tweaker bones. The biggest one on the main joint, like the ankles, knee and hips will allow you to reshape the whole leg based on its natural joint. While the secondary controllers will allow you to completely modify the shape of the leg to create rubber limbs. Very nice for cartoony animations. There are also a couple of controllers to reshape the butt of the character. And we will find the same kind of arrow key on the arm of the character. We will find the shoulder bones as being the root of the arms and then forward kinematic controllers, tweaker bones, etc. It's also possible there to switch between the forward kinematic and inverse kinematic. We will check that in a few second when looking at the rig properties. The finger controller are pretty straightforward. Near the pinkie, you will find this master pan bone that will allow you to curve the whole palm of each hands. the same root will allow you to orientate the thumb and each finger as its own master bone. On each finger, rotating the second joint bone will allow you to bend both the second and third joint. Finally, each joint can be rotated, scaled, and moved at will. The different weapons, are all both the same way. You will find a master bone that more or less have the shape of the current weapon. Allowing you to orientate Eaton's space and move it. Then, you will find a forward kinematic chain that is ideal to curve the weapons and give them nice shape whenever you are doing stylized animation. And as usual, the yellow bones will be our tweaker bones. Moving them with allow you to modify the shape of each joint of the different weapons. You can hide or unhide all the tweaker controllers and layers using the eye icon on the top right corner. Let's have a look to the rig property. The head follow and neck follow sliders allows you to enable or disable the fact that the neck is following the orientation of the chest or not. It's the same principle regarding the head and the neck. If I disable the head follow and I rotate the neck, the head stay in the same orientation. This is super useful for dance animations or run cycles, for example. And then we will find the same option for the arm and the legs. When enabling arm follow, we can see that now the arms are following the rotation of the shoulders. While when disabled, they will keep their own orientation, making it easier to stabilize their orientation. By default, the legs are set to inverse kinematic. This is perfect for any contacting controller. In this case, the legs contacting with the ground. But we can switch to forward kinematic by switching this value to zero. We can see the leg snapping into another position following the orientation of the forward kinematic controller, so it can be enabled in the layer system. This can be useful to draw nice arcs whenever your character is making big jumps or kicking something for example. We will find exactly the same mechanism for the other leg, but also for the arms. Setting the values to zero, will switch to forward kinematic. To one, will switch to inverse kinematic. By default the arm are using forward kinematic mechanism, but you can switch to inverse kinematic. Again, this is super useful whenever your character is contacting with something. When doing push ups, for example, or interacting with another character. You will find the parent option for the legs and the arms. By default the leg inverse kinematic controller are parented to the root, so they don't move whenever the torso is moved. And the pose target is independent. When switching the parenting value to one, the pole will be parented to the foot controller. Meaning that rotating the foot will also rotate the knee. This is the method I generally use. Switching the value to two will also parent the foot to the torso controller, but not to the hips. That can be useful whenever you make your character jump for example. You will find the same option regarding the inverse kinematic arms controller, but only when one value that allow you to parent the inverse kinematic controllers to the torso root. Again, they won't follow the chest, but they will follow the torso root. I've heard the same kind of mechanism for the weapons. Allowing you to whether snap them to the left hand, right hand or not snap them at all so that they can move freely in space. This can be useful whenever you want to throw the weapon for example. The weapon emit option will allow you to play with the strength of the emission shader on the weapons. If you press play, you can see that the shader is currently animated. Bringing a magical touch to those weapons. On top of this, you will find a weapon spawn option that will allow you to make the weapons progressively disappear or appear with a nice dissolve effect. As for the squirrel character, you will find visibility properties that allows you do hide different part of the character, making its silhouette easier to read or allowing you to focus on specific part when animating. Last but not least you will find a snap utilities. This will allow you to change from inverse kinematic to forward kinematic and also align the controllers together. Allowing a seamless switch between the two mechanisms. A disclaimer here. Due to the complexity of the rig mechanism and the rubber limbs system, it can be sometimes not 100% accurate but the pose can be fixed in one second. And this is way faster than trying to align the controller by hand. I'm not used to have this in production so this is really a bonus.

## 05-03-Rotations

[Instructor] Before we start animating our character, I'd like to talk a bit about rotations and how Blender and 3D application in general, and all them. One key component to understand is that orientation and rotation are two different things. Rotation is the action or the motion of rotating around an axis or multiple axes while orientation is the result of those rotation at a specific moment in time. In this example, the orientation is where the arrow is pointing at. It's currently oriented straight up because it has no rotation values. So what we see per frames are just orientation. And when we have different orientation in sequence, we can simulate a rotation. In this example, I have a bunch of different arrow object with different colors, and they all have different orientation and they will appear only on one frame at a time. But if I played the animation and I displayed those different arrows with different orientation in sequence, we feel like there is a rotating arrow. Don't worry, you don't need to think about this whenever you're animating. What I'm just pointing out here is that you can bring the feeling of rotation or rotating motion in different ways. And sometime your graph editor might not exactly reflect the sensation of rotation you have playing in your animation. In this next example, I have two arrows with exactly the same orientation, but one is rotated by a while the other one has no rotation. And if I insert a keyframe for the rotation channels of those two arrows, we can see that for the same orientation, we have two different values. So the rotation motion would be a variation of those values over time. But if in this case I do a 360 degree turn over only one frame, I don't see any rotation on screen. So it's kind of a stupid example, but my goal here is to show you that even if the graph editor is outputting a rotation motion, the feeling on screen or in your output might be different. And so it's very important to check your motion path, your arcs, and your spacing whenever you are animating a rotation. In the end, when we are manipulating rotation curve, make sense and it's logical but sometime, especially with quaternions, it won't be logical at all and it's better to focus on the output than how you got there. Let's have a quick look to the different rotation types and when to use them. You can change the rotation type of most item in the transform panel by clicking in the rotation menu. We will find quaternions rotation mode, different Euler rotation, and finally the axis angle mode that we won't be talking about because I never ever use it. Eulers are very cool because they are very easy to understand especially when manipulating only one axis. You can input the value you want on the rotation axis of your choice and the object will rotate around this axis. For example here, around the X axis. And the cool thing about Euler rotation on one axis is that it's very easy and logical to read in the graph editor. To illustrate it, I will create a full revolution animation around the X axis. A revolution around one axis is a 360 degree rotation. In this case, around the X axis. I will then add an empty that I will parent to the arrow, placing it on the tip of the arrow and calculate its motion path so that we can see the spacing of our revolution motion. When we now watch the result, we can clearly see the difference of spacing around frame 15 where the curve has the most value variation while around frame 0 and frame 30, we have some easing. So single axis Euler rotation curve are super easy to read and they are the perfect choice whenever you are using a controller that need to rotate only on one axis like elbows, finger joints, foot roll, or knees. Since Eulers are awesome, why don't we use them all the time? Let's input a bit of Y rotation into our arrow. With this 30 degree rotation on the Y axis, I changed the orientation of the arrow. So how will be its motion now? Will it still rotate around its X axis? Well, not exactly. It's still doing a revolution, but the axis has changed. It's like we have given it a new orientation before we start the revolution motion. When we input a Y value, it's like we are changing the initial orientation of our arrow and while the arrow, it's still doing a revolution motion, it's not doing it anymore around the same visual axis. So why is that and how can we handle this? Basically, to define the orientation of the arrow. Blender is reading the Euler rotation value in sequence and this is why we can change different type of Euler rotation. It will simply change the order of the sequence. When I say in sequence, I mean that, Blender will first read in this case, the Z rotation axis, then the Y rotation axis, and finally the X rotation axis. So basically, it start by the end. For the XYZ Euler rotation, it will first read Z, then Y and finally X. For a ZYX Euler rotation, it will first read X then Y and finally Z, and this is why, in a way, we feel like the Z axis and the Y axis are giving a different orientation while we are executing the revolution around the X axis. But this is not exactly true. And what happen if we input some motion onto those two axes? If I get rid of the rotation on the Z axis and I'll input some rotation motion onto the Y axis while maintaining the rotation motion onto the Y axis, we can see we get a very weird motion. And if I track now the tip of my arrow, it's super strange. I will get rid of the interpolation of my curve, so that we have a linear motion, and now if I mute the Y axis, I see my classical rotation but as I mute the X axis and have only the Y rotation, we can see that the rotation or revolution on the Y depends on the value on the X and it totally changed the behavior of the arrow. So this is one of the main issue regarding Euler rotation and it's linked to the gimbal lock. To illustrate the gimbal lock, we will use this Suzanne head. I have three different rotation object. Each object can rotate only on one single axis. Red is X, green is Y, and blue is Z. And I will parent the monkey head to the red one, the red one to the green one, and the green one to the blue one, so that we can rotate them in sequence as with Eulers. So rotating the X object will make the head rotate. If I rotate the Y object, both the head and the red one will rotate, and finally, rotating Z will rotate everything. I can easily create revolution animation or any rotation animation around the X axis. If I rotate a bit Y, it will change the initial orientation of X, thus, the revolution axis of the head. The problem is with this evaluation of orientation through sequence, if I rotate Y by 90 degrees, then X and Z will be aligned and from there, rotating whether Z or X, won't change the behavior of our head and this is what we call a gimbal lock. We have isolated one rotation axis in this case, the original X axis. So to keep things simple, whenever you are using Euler, just forget about the middle axis in the sequence and use Eulers only for one or two axis rotation controllers. If your controller is supposed to rotate freely around the three axes, we will favorize quaternions. When I need to choose which type of Euler sequence I'm going to use, I make sure that the first in the sequence is the most important axis the one that will rotate the most. The one in the middle is the one I want to isolate, the one I don't want to use, and the third one is kind of a secondary axis. On the foot roll controller, for example, I will favorize the X axis, and the Z axis will come in second position, and I don't want to rotate around the Y axis. For the shoulder, it's a bit the same. The X axis will be the main rotation axis, the Z the secondary. I keep the Y axis available because I know we can do find the tweaking, but those are going to be very low angle adjustments. Let's have a look to quaternions. With my arrow selected, I will choose in the Rotation Menu, Quaternions. We now have four channels. When I changed the value on X, Y, or Z, the arrow rotate around the X, Y, or Z axis. So it seems to behave as it did before, but that's not exactly the case. We generally use quaternions from a value of 1 to minus 1. If I set the value on the Y axis to 1, I will see my arrow rotated by and minus Y will be minus 90 degree. But if I want to do a 180 degree rotation on the Y axis, I will get stuck. As I go beyond a value of 1 which I can do, the arrow will go beyond the 90 degree angle but there is a lot of easing and the closer I get to 180 degree, the more and more I need to increase the value and I won't be able to get to this 180 degree angle even if I push the value to the infinite. If I now try to reach this orientation manually instead of using the value inputs, we can see our Y value changing as expected, but also the W value. These values that was 1 got to 0 and is now getting to minus 1, while the Y value is also changing at the same time. And this is because those are not rotation values, but each channels equal an orientation. And the values we are manipulating are the quantity or the weight of each of those orientation we are giving to set the final orientation of our object. This is something that was super well explained on the sociamix YouTube channel, and I will put the link in the documentation. Here, I have four different object, each one has a value of 1 on one of the quaternions input. If I set a value of 0.5 on W and on X, you can see our object pointing down. It's half way the orientation on W, and half way the orientation on X. I can repeat the process with W and Z, and now the object will be facing us. So I believe it can be a little bit abstract, and it is also for me. The benefit of quaternions is that it will take the shortest path from one orientation to another. So if I use my initial arrow, and I will key different orientation in space, and I will then set my curve to linear interpolation and calculate the motion path, you can see those clean arcs going from one position to the other. While if I switch to Euler rotation and key exactly the same orientation at the same time, you will see that my curve change, and it is kind of zigzagging in a smooth manner. So the big strength of quaternion is to not have any gimbal lock and being able to go to one orientation to the other flawlessly. It's perfect for any tracking motion like the head, the arm, the wrist, or even the spine, but it has some limitation. You can't do a proper revolution with quaternions, it's very complicated to read the curve interpolation since it's generally a mixture of all the channels at the same time. So the best way to deal with quaternions is to track your arcs whenever you are polishing your animation. A classic bug with quaternions is when you're trying to do a revolution and see the orientation flipping. This can happen often especially if you don't go into a very detailed blocking, and the simplest way to fix it is to animate on once whenever you are transitioning from one orientation to the other and you have these flipping problem. We will probably face these issues in the incoming chapters. Don't worry if it's a bit confusing, you don't need to know all these theory to become a good animator. To summarize, we have seen that the orientation is the result of any rotation at a specific moment in time. A sequence of different orientation can give the impression of rotation motion. You should use Euler rotation whenever you are rotating around one or two axis maximum. Eulers are awesome because they are very easy to read and edit in the graph editor, and you can do a full revolution with them. But they can have confusing behavior whenever you are trying to manipulate multiple axes at the same time, and you may also encounter gimbal lock trouble. Quaternions won't have any gimbal lock. They have a consistent behavior no matter the orientation you are trying to reach, but the graph editor can be a bit confusing. You can't, or it's very hard to execute in your revolution using quaternions.

## 05-04-Reference analysis

[Instructor] Before we start creating our run cycle animation. We need to study a bit some references. You can easily find some breakdowns of run cycle animation online but it's always a good thing to study some references to train your eyes, to learn what to look for and to avoid mistakes. While I will make a slightly stylized run cycle, the physicality and principle of a realistic run cycles still apply. Only the rhythm and the amplitude or the exaggeration will make the difference. You will find the link to different reference videos, I've picked on YouTube in the documentation. I will use since sketch to currently study the ones I'm showing you right now. When working on the run cycle, we will mainly focus on for poses. So down or passing pose, the push, the up pose and finally, the straight leg just before the contact and the end of the cycle. when working on the cycle analogies, I advise you to focus on one feature at a time. The first thing I will check here is the shape of the spine and the overall line of action between the contact pose and the down pose, we can see how the whole characters spine and line of action from the foot form some kind of S shape. So from the front view, if we isolate the spine from the hips and the shoulder, it creates a C shape. And from the side view, it does create a C shape for what too, during the down pose or passing pose, the shape is almost the same, but it's getting slightly straighter. I think the pushing pose is one of the most iconic pose during a run because the line of action is super easy to read, creating both from the side view and the front view, a nice elongated arc. During the up pose, our character's spine from the front view is almost straight and from the side view while the character is slightly leaning forward, the spine is also looking a bit straight. This is the time where we will be mirroring the cycle in a way and shifting the shape of the torso onto the other side. One of the most important thing to get right when animating a character is the relation between the shoulders and the hips. The thing you must keep in mind, whenever you are posing the torso of your character is counter posing or contra posto. The human spine is a bull of a very little compression sense to the discs we have between our bones. And when aging those discs get a little stiffer and a little smaller, this is why when getting old you often lose like one centimeter. In this case, you don't really need to think about the relationship between your shoulder position and the hips. But when you are leaning on a side, you will generally compensate this rotation by pushing onto your leg to support the weight that has shifted. As you trying to keep balance, your hips will be raising upon the tool of the lean shoulder. So when you're posing your character, always think of a V-shape formed by the plane of the shoulders and the plane of the hips. From the side view, we will have exactly the same behavior. If you lean forward to pick something on the ground for example, your hips will naturally rotate the opposite way so that you keep balance. Just make a test, try bending forward and rotate your hips backwards, you will have a very hard time keeping balance and you will tend to move your whole body back so that your feet are aligned with your neck. So the relation between your shoulders, your hips and your feet is always about keeping balance. And counter posing also helps here during a twist. If you twist your upper body right, there are big chances that you will slightly compensate with your hips. So if we now get back to our references, it will be kind of obvious. When the left side of the hips of Usain Bolt are twisted forward his right shoulder is twisting forward to compensate. And you can observe exactly the same thing on the front view. If we get a little further in the video, we can clearly see this twisting with the left shoulder forward while the hips are twisting the opposite way. If we have a look at some of the key poses of our characters, we will easily find our V-shapes during the passing or down pose all the weight is on one foot, pushing the hips upward. If you have a hard time distinguishing the hips you can use the silhouette of the character. So we can see the hips raising from left to right and the shoulder leaning down from left to right. During the up pose where both feet are no longer on the ground, we generally have almost a straight hips and straight shoulders. Some kind of parallel hips and shoulders, since the body is no longer supporting any weight, but prepare to transition into bending the other way. But as we transitioned to the contact pose, we can see the hips and shoulder counter posing again into a V-shape. And from there, we'll be transitioning into a new passing pose where the leg is pushing the hips upward and the shoulders are compensating. In the run cycle, one of the most important thing is up and down of the center of gravity. But the most common mistake I see on beginners run cycle are the left to right motion. The first very important thing to think about is that the faster you run, the less left to right motion you will have. And this is why run cycles are easier than walk cycle is that you don't have to think that much about the weight shifting from left to right, but there is still a bit of it. The side to side motion will reach its extreme a bit after the contact pose. When the athlete is pushing on his leg to jump, his leg is pushing on the opposite direction. So when pushing on the right leg, his body is translating to the left and it will take a couple of frame after the contact pose for the body to absorb this translation and then go back into a pushing pose that will push the body the opposite way. And it's gonna be a bit of the same regarding the up and down. While it's pretty easy to spot the up pose when the character is air bound the down pose doesn't occur whenever the character is contacting with the ground but a few frame after, because again that the body needs some time to compensate the weight and the momentum. The relationship between the hands and the legs is not that complicated. As for the hips and the shoulder, they behave the opposite way, when the right leg is moving forward, the left hand is moving forward. When the right hand is back, the left foot is back and we will find the same kind of behavior during a walk cycle. But there is a subtle but very important difference. In the run cycle hands are not reacting to the motion, but they are leading the motion. If we track the left hand of Usain Bolt we can see that it reaches its extreme forward pose or upward pose before the right foot. And as the foot reaches its extreme forward pose, the left fist has already started swinging backward. So during the forward motion, the fist arrives first and pulls the body up and forward. And then it swings backward so that the left hand can arrive first compared that to the left hand. And when we hit the passing pose, we can see that the left hand is already a bit backward compared to the right foot. And this is why sprint athletes tend to have a very muscular upper body. It allows them to generate a lot of momentum and energy using their arms to pull their whole body. Again here, we can see the left fist moving forward while the right leg is still dragging back and now the leg is catching up. So you need to remember that to get a believable run cycle, whether it's stylized or not. Arms are leading the motion, shoulder and hands are leading the motion. To wrap up this video, we will have a quick look to the arc made by the legs. Here, I've traced the left leg motion, which using a sprint athlete as a reference can be a little misleading depending on what kind of front cycle you want to do. If you're an average person like me, there is very little chance that when you run, you hit this kind of pose. So never forget that when you are studying references, put them in their context. What are you looking at? So in the context of the more classic run cycle, even if it is a bit athletic, your motion path will mostly looks like that. We can also see that those athletes are very light on their feet, mostly running on the tip of their feet while we may furtherize a rolling foot from the heel to the tip when we will do our own cycle. It will be also important to study the shape of the arm. Look at when it reaches the back, it's mostly angled and then it gets straight during the passing pose. And then it gets very angled when reaching its higher pose. We've the elbow leading the motion, meaning that the elbow will reach its extreme pose a little before the hand, maybe one frame. Since we will be using forward kinematics to animate the arms, we don't really need to track the arc on the reference. You can do it, but I believe that the pose is more important. A final thought is the position of the foot when landing on the ground. You can see on the right reference that the foot will be slightly shifting to the inside when hitting the ground. These are little details that can make your run cycle way more believable or interesting. Also you should avoid to make a straight line with the foot motion. You should make a slight left to right arch during the passing pose, where the foot we get to the side during the passing and get a little centered during the contact frame. We could analyze those reference forever. So what we will do is that we will jump into the blocking of our run cycle and for each pose, we will try to think about all those details.

## 05-05-Run-Cycle-Blocking

[Instructor] In this video, we will start the blocking stage of our run cycle. To create this run cycle, we will mix the layered approach with the blocking approach. In this video, we will create the main poses before jumping into spline and polish each part of the body one by one. Note that nothing is carved into stone and those poses might evolve during the polishing stage. It's important to use the video reference you will gather on the internet and to guide you during this blocking stage, I'm providing a picture with the different main poses. The last thing I'd like to address before we jump into it is that most of the time, I'm using global coordinates with individual origin for my manipulators but I often use local space, especially for the forearms that can rotate only along one axis. Though I generally press R to rotate and then Z twice to switch to local space. This is why you will often see me press Z, Y or X twice to switch from global to local. If you are used to work with widget manipulators, then I advise you to directly switch to local space. This way you will get more familiar with the controller alignment. I personally exclusively use a shortcut. This is why I often stay in global space. The idea is to create a slightly stylized run cycle but the fundamentals of a realistic venular run cycle will be there. Making it stylized will be mostly about contrasting the timing and exaggerating a bit the poses but making it looks cool will require us to have a good physicality and realistic fundamentals, so let's get started. The first thing we are going to do is to link our character into the scene. So let's get rid of all the default object in our scene and then go to File, Link and in the chapter five file, you will find the TRIDENT-CHARACTER RIG_final file. Go to Collection and choose the first collection, TRIDENT-CHARACTER. Double click the collection and it will appear in the outliner. Now, to be able to expose the rig of our character, unfold the imported collection and right click on the sub-collection, go to ID Data and choose Add Library Override Hierarchy. This will give us access to the current rig and the different object of the character and if any update were made on the original linked file, it will automatically update in your scene. We have now a new character collection with two sub-collection, including the rig and the different models. We can get rid of the file we've imported just before, the one with the orange collection icon. From there, we can select the rig, switch into pose mode by pressing Control + Tab. Then when animating, I personally like to switch the shading to flat with texture object and enable the cavity and shadows. In the 3D view properties panel, you will find the rig properties panel. Here, in the visibility tab, you can disable the weapon's visibility. Set the length of our cycle, 24 frames. So I will go on frame zero and press Control + Home and then go on frame 23 and press Control + End. Since from 24 on frame 0 will be the same, I don't want to read from frame 0 to frame 24 but jump from frame 23 to frame 0. There with the dope sheet opened, I will switch to the Action Editor and I will duplicate the current animation called Keying Set to create our run blocking animation. Don't forget to click the shield icon to make sure you set a fake user to the animation and won't lose it. Another thing I advise you to do before we start blocking the animation is to create a second 3D viewport in perspective, showing your character. While we generally animate in autographic view, that's always a good thing to have a perspective view, just to preview the animation. So let's now create our first pose, the straight leg pose. This is the one where the front leg is getting straightened just before contacting with the ground. The back leg is pointing backward and as seen in the video reference, the front arm has already started swinging backward. So from a side view, you should be able to see both elbows. Left shoulder is twisting forward and the hips are twisted in the opposite direction. For the animation of this character, we will be using 30 frame per seconds. This is the usual frame rate used in video games production. And the one I'm used to animate with. It's only to work on cinematic animation, then you can stick to In the end, whatever the frame rate, the goal is to make your animation feels good. It's not that important during the blocking stage. So we can now start positioning the feet from a side view. When it comes to rotating the foot backward and forward, I advise you to use the foot roll controller, rotating it on its x local axis. It will make your life way easier since it's built to create this kind of rotation and mechanism. Since we won't be animating the root bones, you can hide them through the rig UI. Now pose the second foot, again using the foot roll to rotate the foot forward and then rotating the toes backward. As usual, I will probably go back and forth onto this pose while building the other poses. In your case, just use the reference provided or build your own poses. It's very important to pose your character from different angles. Don't stay in side view. That will be a big mistake. When it comes to twisting the hips on the global z-axis, it's pretty straight forward. Just follow the position of the legs. Since the right leg is forward, just twist the right side of the hips forward. Then the torso the opposite direction, the left side forward. A very important thing here is that the torso root controller will be your main controller to position the torso of your character. This is the controller you have to move the most to get your character into position. Then the chest and hips controller are here to tweak the pose of your character. And this is why here I prefer to console the rotation of hips and chest by pressing Alt + R, the main shape using the torso root controller and then fine tweak the pose using the chest controller and the hips controller. It can be very hard to get a correct pose. In my case, I won't be able to reach it right away. So try your best to match the reference and then go on the next pose. You will naturally get back to this pose to adjust it compared to the other poses. Posing the arms will definitely help to get a better silhouette. I will slightly rotate the front shoulder upward and forward and then I will work with the arm controller that can rotate on all axes to match the reference. When rotating the forearm, don't forget to favorize its local z-axis, since elbows and knees can normally rotate only on one axis. To make our life easier, we will pull the hand with a closed fist. Watch your own hand as a reference and make sure that the fist is slightly curling. Don't make a box shape with the hand. Look it from every angle and you will notice that the joint always form a curve. Take the time to properly pose one of the hand and then we will mirror it on the other side. My favorite controller for the hands is the master palm controller. It allows you to move all the palm bones at once with a nice falloff and build nice base and shapes. There I will curve each finger, rotating them on their local x-axis. The first joint is supposed to be rotated almost at 90 degrees. Then I will pose the thumb and then adjust the finger accordingly. As I explained in the very beginning of the video, it's better to enable cavity and shadows onto your flat shading so that you can see the geometry a little better and betterly read the pose. Again, take the time to create a nice pose, adjust each joint. Don't forget to slightly compress the palms inwards and then adjust the thumb position. There are different poses for closed fist, depending on the people and the reference you are watching. The best reference still being your own fist because you can see it from every angle and you can also feel the pose in your own hand. Once we have reached a satisfying pose, we can select all the hand bones controller, press Control + C to copy the pose and then Control + Shift + V. This will automatically mirror the pose on the other side. With my finger posed, I can now readjust the position of the arms. Don't forget, you can both rotate and move the shoulder controller and that the arm controller can be rotated in all direction while the forearm controller should be rotated only along its z local axis. You can slightly rotate the hand inward to break a bit the wrist and get a more opening shape for the arm. Don't go too extreme because your wrist motion is pretty limited. Take a few seconds and try rotating your fist forward and backward and then try to rotate it from left to right. You will see that its motion is currently very limiting. Posing the right arm is pretty straightforward. Don't forget to check your pose from the front view and realign the knees and the feet if needed. Don't forget to double check the reference I have provided and rewatch the previous video where we have breaked down the run cycle poses, using real-life references. In the neck, it's important to switch to NECK-FOLLOW, instead of HEAD-FOLLOW where the base of the neck gets aligned with the torso, which is more natural and then we can tweak its position and tweak the head position. From there, don't forget to slightly tweak the position and orientation of your foot of your knees and we finally have our first pose done. As explained in the beginning of this video, this might not be the final straight leg pose but that's a good start to work onto the next one.

## 05-06-Run-Cycle-Blocking-02

Let's go ahead with the blocking stage of our run cycle. We will now work on the down pose also called passing pose where the contacting foot is more or less aligned with the center of gravity of our character and the opposite foot is passing, almost passing the center of gravity depending on the kind of run you're doing. Note that the torsal route has a bit of left to right motion, where the weight is shifting toward the contacting foot. But this left to right motion need to be more subtle than on the work cycle or your character will feel very heavy. Next pose, I'm not thinking about the timing. We have four poses on 12 frames, I will key every free frames. So I will jump on frame free and key all the controllers. As in the action editor and choose all channels. During the blocking stage, it's important to key the whole character on each main poses to avoid any foot sliding or weird interpolation of the different controllers or the right foot to the ground level, cancel the rotation on the foot role and place it under the root of the character. You, what I told you in the previous video, in this case, I need to slightly raise my character on the first poofs because on the down pose, I feel like he's too low compared to the previous one. So I will push the character up, selecting both the feet and the torso root controller. As he is pushing on his right leg, his hips will raise on the right side and the hips should not be twisted that much since we are in the passing pose and the shoulders and hips will be kind of aligned with the feet. Here is one of the most important tip of this video, whenever I'm building a new pose if I can't get a good result right away, I will cancel the rotation of the torso root and repose it. Press Alt + R to cancel rotation on the hips and the torso routes and then rebuild the pose. It's better to do so than trying to match the pose from the previous one. If we have made some transformation that doesn't fit. You will be fighting with your ring and at the end of the blocking, you will have lots of weird pose in your different controller while it may look kind of, okay, your rig will be kind of broken. So trust me, you may take a little more time blocking your poses this way, but whenever you feel like the character is not responding, or the rig is not responding properly, just cancel the rotation and rebuild the pose from scratch. You will save them a lot of time during the polishing. Back to our pose, don't forget that the feet have a slight right to left movement while in air. Position of the foot depend on the people and on the speed at which you are running. Some people will have their feet going on the outside during the passing pose other on the inside. Since we are blocking the pose don't forget to select all your keys and set them to constant interpolation. Regarding the global arm position. You will generally keep your arms close to your body, the faster you run. So basically what you have to think about when working on your poses is the faster, the straighter. since you've matched your video reference or the reference provided, don't hesitate to fine tweak the first pose. Then the second pose, maybe lean a bit more forward the character to make him look like a little more dynamical that will surely refine those poses when we will be working on the curves. Let's now jump on to the push pose. This is one of the most beautiful and iconic extreme of a run cycle it's where the contacting leg is straight back and the leading arm is at its maximum speed. As the arm and the shoulder up pulling the body upward in the first video, the leading arm and shoulder will hit their extremes before the feet. The fist generally don't have a big side to side motion. It can be tempting to cross the right hand toward the left shoulder, but that's kind of a mistake. You will get a cool pose, but less realistic run cycle. In the case of this exercise, even if we do a slightly stylized run cycle, try to match something pretty realistic. You can make then some badass run cycle, once you master the run cycle principles. So I will go on frame six. I will raise the heel of the contacting leg and cancel any rotation on the toes. Then I will move the leg backward and slightly raise the torso. I gain advise you to use the foot roll controller, to orientate the foot and make the toes slightly dragging backwards. As usual for this kind of cycle, the hips will be twisting toward the forward leg and the torso root and chest controller will be twisting the opposite direction. The left shoulder need to be raised back and the left elbow is almost at its highest point. I've slightly the left forearm and left hand forward to make them drag a bit. I will then raise the right shoulder and push it forward and I will raise the right right arm, twisted it so that I keep the face clear from the right hand. The final touch is to make the legs feet and knees a little straighten, so that we get a good aerodynamics and the pose that tells you, hey, I'm going forward. This relies a lot on lines of action, but we will deal with this animation principle a little later in this course. For the time being, just look at all the silhouette tells us that the character is pushing up and forward. The last pose we will have two bird is the up pose. This is going to be pretty straight forward since this is when most of our controllers hits their extreme poses. Make sure you're twisting the chest and the hips to the maximum, the left shoulder and left elbow are at their highest point. So does the right shoulder and the right hand and then pose the feet according to the reference, making sure that the right leg is dragging back with the toes also dragging to get a nice arrow shape of the leg that points toward the previous position of the foot in space. And then as usual don't hesitate to rework each controller to get a better pose. Don't forget to double check the video reference. As you may get some more details like the left elbow. is getting higher and the left forearm is slightly bending inward. Don't target to slightly twist the arm to keep the head clear and finally you should scrub through your animation as often as possible. So that you can fine tweak the previous poses so that the flow looks great. Once I'm done with that, I will make sure I add a key frame on all the channel of this key. And then I will, then I will go back on frame zero in the 3d viewport. Select all the controllers, press Ctrl + C to copy the pose and then go to frame 12 and in the 3d viewport press control Shift + V to mirror the pause. Then I just have to repeat the process, go on frame free copy the pause then go 12 frames later on frame 15 and paste the mirrored pause and repeat the process. Finally, I will just have to duplicate all the keys from frame zero onto frame 24. Once I'm done and it seems that the cycles work, I will insert a key frame on every single keys I have created so that all my controllers are keyed and we have our linear, our cycle. As we can finally see our whole cycle. We can finally check what's working and what's not. In my case, I feel like the animation lack of dynamism to get more dynamic run cycle, you can push the torso route forward and lean your character forward too a little more. When birding a run cycle, the more horizontal you get the more dynamism you will have. If you think about the stereotypical anime ninja run cycle like in our route. So legs are generally pushed to back while the torso is pushed forward and is almost horizontal. Once you've tweaked all your pose. Don't forget to again to again mirror them on each keys. Here is the result I got from our blocking stitch. The run cycle looks pretty cool, pretty natural not too dynamic, not too stylized which is perfect to learn our fundamental. Since we've been keying every free frame in some kind of thinning our fashion, the run cycle works. What we can do now, is offset some of the key poses to slightly stylized our run cycle. For a light skilled and agile character. We want to favorize the airborne pause. The idea is to hold the up pose a little longer and switch from the straight pose down pose and pushing pose a little faster, the process in itself is not super complicated and not super interesting. I'm just moving some keys until I get to the right timing. So in the end I've set the down or passing pose on frame free and 15. The pushing pose on frame five and 17, so that we have only two frame between the down and pushing pose. So that the foot is rapidly sliding on the ground before we get back into the air with the up pose on frame eight and 20.

## 05-07-Polishing the feet

In this video, we will start planning our animation. Starting by polishing the up and down of the torso root. And then the feet motion. The first obvious step is to go into pause mode into our rig. Select all our keys, press the T key and switch to busy interpolation. You can switch between the action editor and the graph editor by pressing control tab and we to make sure all the curves are exposed by clicking on the show hidden option. You may also press Alt + H to make sure that there is no curves that is manually hidden. From there, I will press eight to select all the curve and then press Shift + E and choose make cyclic. Now all of our curve get this modifier and our whole animation will be cycling in time infinitely. I often start polishing my animation with the feet and go back and forth with the torso. In this case, we will start by polishing the Z location of the torsal roots. This is the most important channel during a run cycle. The up and down motion. If we know playing our animation, we are no longer in step mode and while there are some glitches, it doesn't look that bad. Here is our current Z curve and here is what we are going to do with it. The idea is to bring contrast to our up and down or a heavy character you will, favorize the down pose for a light energized character like ours, You will favorize the up pose meaning that we will hold our character in the air little bit. The idea is to bring contrast to the motion. So we will, I have a slight plateau in the top position and then a fast down pose with a fast bounce, meaning that the curve will rapidly get back to its up position. You really have to focus on the up and down motion of your character and if needed you can hide the legs and the arms. Since our character is bouncing twice during the 24 frame of its cycle, I have refined the keys from zero to 12 and then duplicated those keys from zero to 12 onto 12 to 24. Then I can trade off any keys that were remaining previously. This way the base up and down motion of my root is done and I can switch to the feet motion as explained many times animation is not a linear workflow. So we will probably have to get back to the root motion and switch between route and feet, root and torso, et cetera. This up and down motion is mostly put upon a feeling, but I've shaped it so that my character is holding a bit in here. And the speed at which he's going down and going up is not exactly the same. When you are doing a jump or an eye blink, it's always good to have contrast between the up motion and the down motion, even if it's just about one frame. When I polish the feet whether it's for a cycle. or for another animation, I always start with the location, or I often polish the feet pretty early on because a lot of the torso motion, the hips motion is based on the feet motion. The first thing I want to define is the contacting in position of the feet. To get a nice looking and dynamic whole run cycle it's good to have a straight leg during the contact. So as mentioned produced in this case my character is a bit too far from the ground to get a good pose so I can switch back to the root control and offset to the whole as Z curve down. As I define my contact pose, it's important to also define the moment the feet will leave the ground. And as you may remember, in the previous cycle we have created the interpolation of the foot while it's on the ground should be linear because the ones on the ground, the feet will travel at a constant speed. I can convert the keys on frame two and frame five by selecting them and pressing the V key and switching to vector. Then we can delete any key between frame two and frame five. We'll have to do these for all the location curves Z Y and X . For the time being we are focusing on Z and Y . Once done both curve between frame two and five are linear making a straight line. This is the kind of obvious moment While the polishing feet. From there I will then focus on getting a good feeling for the rest of the motion. As the foot leaves the ground it still have momentum from the moment it was traveling on the ground. This is why I like to push it back. I want to favorise the backward and forward position and have a quick motion during the passing pose. The passing pose doesn't read as well as the up pose and the pushing pose. Covering the airborne poses of our character, his run will feel more agile and light. While in the end, I have a tight spacing around frame 12 and frame zero, as the feet ease or slow down into the extreme pose. And then I will accelerate during the passing poses. Another thing I like to do is to have a great acceleration just before the contact pose. So that we can feel that the foot is smashing on the ground and then pushing backward. And we can see this acceleration between frame zero and frame two, where our curve gets more and more vertical. As usual, here you can see the final polished curve of the Y and Z location of the feet. Try to match the motion path you can see on this one screen you can pause the video there. Next step is polishing the forward rotation of the foot. To do so As explained during debulking, I always have arrived using the foot roll controller. I will make sure that I have a nice heel contact on frame two and that I have at least one frame with a flat foot. Rotation of this controller must be set to zero around frame foot. Might not be the case if you should use printer references, where on there are mostly contacting with the bowl of their foot. As they are constantly accelerating forward. But for a constant speed run cycle, it's better to contact with the heel. It will look better, you will have more contrast into to your motion and the idea is to transition smoothly from the heel to the toe. So that the character keeps momentum. As I'm reworking the heel position, the leg is less straight during the pushing pose. So I can slightly offset the wheel location curve of the foot and then get back onto my heel controller. Again, we are not into a linear work workflow, and we need to go back and forth to the different controllers who hit better poses. Now, I will get back to to the torso route controller and select all the keys of the wide location and move them down to push the whole body of my character forward and get a more dynamic pose. From there I will select again my foot controller and move it's Y curves slightly down on the contact pose and on the pushing pose. So we are always refining the position of our character. Now I can get back to work onto the heel and make sure I have a nice roll of foot. Here you can see again, the curve has a reference and use it to Polish your own curve, but you may focus on your own run cycle because this specific curve match my specific animation and if you have differences regarding your feet position or the eighth of the torso controller, you will have variation. They are used to make the tip of the foot slightly pointing backward and down during the passing pose to get this nice dragging motion and transition into having the heel down while the foot is about to hit the ground. Next, we will polish the toe controllers. This animation, I've only used the main toe controller since the big toe controller move along with it that's perfectly fine. This part of the animation is pretty straight forward. First of all, we will only be animating using the X Euler rotation curve is to create a nice follow through animation of the toes, dragging something similar to what we did with the tail of the squirrel character. It's important to console the rotation while the foot is on the ground so that the toes won't click with the ground. This is why the keys on frame four and five are switched to vector. One interesting subtlety I've done, delay by one frame the moment the toes get flat on the ground. The foot gets flattened on frame three and the toes follow through on frame four. When the foot leaves the ground, the toes are pointing toward the previous pose, when the foot is moving forward to toes are slightly pointing backward. One thing you can use to help yourself is the motion path of the foot we have on screen. The toes should be pointing to what the previous frame during the cycle. These in most cases, will bend them way too much, but then you just have to adjust their curvature so that the foot have a nice and natural pose. Here is the final curve of the X rotation of the toe controller. As usual, you can pause the video there to compare this curve with your and again, this is the curve of my animation. Yours might be a bit different. We've been mostly working on the foot from the side view. Its time to revise it from the front view with the X location curve by selecting back the foot controller, hidden all the keys, but the X location. And we will mark on the side to side motion. Remember what I told you regarding the location of the foot when hitting the ground. Linear interpolation, and regarding the side to side motion, we need a flat curve, meaning that the foot will move on to a straight line. To do so, I will convert keys on frame two and five to vector and get rid of any keys in between. While I was originally planning to make the foot push inward when leaving the ground and then during the passing pose getting on the outside, decided during this polishing stage to do the inverse, as I told you before this motion can vary from people to people depending on anatomic attribute, but also the skill to run from this person. Since my character is agile and skilled, it might be better to kind of follow the motion of an athlete. In this case, the foot is getting outside while getting off the ground inside during the passing pose, a bit outside during the up pose and finally hit it's contacting pose. You should keep the side to side motion pretty subtle. If the motion is too contrasted, the run will look a bit sloppy as if your character was lacking of control. So beyond the motion here, we are defining the character, we are defining the finding who he is and how skilled he is. And this is what makes the difference between motion and animation. As you roll, here is the final X location curve on the foot controller. Once you're done with this, you can call the foot splining and polishing done or you can stay with me for a couple of extra minutes where we will add some extra super subtle rotation to the foot to bring its motion to the next level. To do so I will use first the Y quaternion rotation of foot. I don't want it to rotate while on the ground. So as usual, I will create a flat curve bound by two vector handles. We will use the Y rotation curve to slightly twist the foot toward another target. Check the orientation of the center, while I'm rotating the foot during this polition state, I am pushing it inward while the foot is leaving the ground and during the passing pose, and then I'm slightly pushing it on the outside while the foot is about to contact the ground. Since the foot is using quaternions, we need to play on both the Y and Z rotation curve to properly orientate the foot. Just scrub through this reference video, focusing on the orientation of the foot, we'll find a link to the YouTube video in the documentation as usual. You have the final shape of the Z and Y quaternion rotation curve of the foot controller. From there, there is another thing we need to fix. It's the pull target of the knee. Here again, we could work a lot on the left to right motion of the knee, which is super subtle during the run cycle but still exists. Since our character is pretty light on his feet, I will just try to keep the knees align with the run. So I'm just going frame to frame and adjusting the X location of the pull controller, so that it looks a little cleaner. Having the knees almost align with the feet and the hips will look better and more dynamical. The intimate detail before we mirror on the motion on to the other foot, is the bank or side to side rotation of the foot. From a front view when the foot hit the ground, it's not perfectly flat. When the foot hit the ground, it's generally slightly rotated toward its outer edge, and it will roll onto the thumb while pushing backwards, this is not a big deal, but this is the kind of detail that will make your run cycle look a little better. From there, we can mirror the animation onto the other legs controller. First, we need to select all the right click controller. we've just polished. Then in the graph editor press Alt + H to make sure you don't have any hidden curve. From there press eight to select all the curve and then Ctrl + C to copy those curve. Then we can select all the controllers on the left leg. And from there in the graph editor, press Alt + H to make sure you don't have any hidden curve. Now select all the keys but the one on frame zero from there, make sure that the play head is on frame zero and press Ctrl + Shift + V to paste the mirrored curves. Now we have this fun animation, where both leg do the same motion and we need to offset it. To do so, in the graph, editor press Shift + D to duplicate all the frames. Don't press enter, then press the X and 24. This will move those newly created frame by 24 frame on the right. If we now move those keys in time left to right while playing the animation, we can see that we are currently offsetting the motion. So if I press G X minus 12, now the left leg motion is offset by 12 frames. So of the length of the cycle with the right leg and our cycle is done. To make this clean, I will go on frame zero, press I an insert, and key frame on all channels, select all the keys on frames zero, press V and switch them to free. Then they will duplicate them with Shift and D and move them on frame 24. We can now delete any keys after frame 24 and before frame zero and both our leg now cycling and are polished.

## 05-08-Polishing the Torso

[Instructor] In this video, we are going to polish the torso of the character. Since it's pretty subtle on the run cycle, especially for a light character, I like to start with the left to right location motion. So basically whenever your character is contacting with the crown, the contacting leg will first absorb the impact and then push the character up, but also a bit on the opposite side. Your character should be moving to what the contacting foot one or two frame after the contact, so that he has time to compensate the momentum of the previous move. Then there will be an acceleration during the pushing toward the other side. And when the character is airborne, my go-to is to use a linear curve. But there won't be any noticeable dumping while your character is in the air. There is no opposite force to absorb the momentum of the side to side motion. So in our case, the contacting frame is frame two and frame 14, then takes two frame to get to the extreme. And then as the character is pushing, his body is moving on the other side. Once you are done with the side to side motion, we can work on the forward and backward motion. People, and myself included, often forget to add forward and backward motion to the torso root. It's not a big deal if you forget to, as it's gonna be pretty subtle, But this slight variation will bring a bit of texture to your run cycle. The rule is pretty simple. As your character is falling forward, as the torso is getting down, his torso root will slightly shift forward. During the pushing pose and while he's airborne, torso root will slightly travel backward. So if you have a look to the Y curve, you can see that the values we are working with are very, very subtle. So whenever you are checking the curve as a reference, don't forget to check out the values on the left side. To make the X rotation motion a little more obvious. I've parented this stretched tube to our torso controller. If you focus on the tip of this tube, you will be able to clearly see the rotation motion. The X rotation drives the leaning forward and backward of our character torso root. What I want to emphasize here is that whenever the character is pushing on his leg, his torso is leaning forward. Think of a lion jumping, pushing on his root with his shoulder inward. Then he will reach his highest point, and as he fall down, the shoulder or the upper torso will kind of drag behind the root, and so, the X rotation will go the other way. While this rotation motion should be noticeable, don't over-commit and input too high rotation values, because on top of this, we will also add rotation into the chest controller. And as the chest controller is inside of the torso root, it will rotate even more. A quick tip, whenever you are working on a chain like this, I will deactivate the chest controller, this way, the upper body rotation of my character is only driven by our torso root. And it makes it easier to read the motion. The second tip regarding this motion is that since our character is taking two step during the whole cycle, we just need to work on all of the cycle, and then we can duplicate the curve onto frame 12 to 24. Another good practice I should have shown you at the very beginning of this video is to hide the arms of the character. Since we are not working on the arms at the moment, they can be a bit distracting and training-wise, it is good for you to only see the torso, so that you will get used to its motion. As usual, we are not into a linear close, so I will jump onto the hips before I finished to polish the rotation of the torso root. The first thing I check is which channel I will need to twist the hips, and it's the Z quaternion channel. The twisting is the simplest motion regarding the hips motion since it follows the legs. So when the left foot is forward or left leg is forward, the Z curve is pushed down, so that the hips are twisting forward on their left side. And during the passing pose, the hips will twist the other way. So we have a pretty smooth curve with a slight plateau, as we are favorizing the airborne pose of the character. So it's a moment where the hips are not twisting that much. And then we transition from one side to the other during the passing. The next hips motion we will work on is the left to right tilting, and it's one of the most important motion of the hips. It's not the easiest one to get right, because too much tilting will look very feminine, while not enough will look very stiff. This motion is mainly driven by the Y rotation channel. And what we do want to emphasize is the pushing of the legs on the hips. So I'm slightly reducing the amplitude of the curve so that I can then re-increase it during the pushing on frame four. So we have our contact pose on frame two and frame 14, and on frame four and frame 16, we need a quick rotation change or shifting, this way we can fill the impact of the contacting frame and the fact that the hips will react with a slight delay. In between those two impact motion, the hips are smoothly tilting the other way. As always, for all our cycle, just make sure that your frame zero and your frame 24 are the same by duplicating them. Now our hips motion start to look pretty good. We can now polish the body, X rotation axis, which will be the tilt forward and backward. This one is pretty easy to get right. As the leg reach the contact pose and switch to the passing pose, the hips will tilt forward. And then during the pushing and the airborne, they will tilt backward. Just imagine that the hips are currently pulling the front foot, so when contacting the ground, the hips will surge forward for the foot, and then when pushing and going up, they will pull the foot back. This motion is linked to the extradition of the top, so we have already polished it, so you can keep it very subtle. Again, don't forget to double check the graph editor values. While the X rotation curve looks pretty contrasted, the range of value we are working on is very small, so in the end, the X rotation is not that big. As we have slightly modified the orientation of the hips during the motion, we can see that on the contacting pose, the leg are not full straight. While it may look a little more natural, as explained in the beginning of this chapter, it's better to have an exaggerated pose for the contact. So I'm just getting back to both foot controllers, and I'm slightly offsetting the Y location curve on the contact frame for both feet. As our hips are now polished, we can jump back onto the torso controller, work on the zero rotation channels, that is the twisting of the body, but will be very close to what we have on the zero rotation of the hips. They will be just out of frame of delay compared to the hips twisting. But the torso twist and the hips twist are kind of the same behavior. The fast twisting during the passing, where I switch from one side to the other, and then some kind of plateau where we have a slight overshoot when our character is airborne. Once you are done with the twisting motion, there is a bit of tilting left to right also. So we have to play on the Y quaternion rotation. I do advise you to keep it super subtle, because if you push the tilt left to right too far, your character will look out of balance or its run cycle will look a bit sloppy. That could be a good call for a Hulk-ish kind of run cycle or a knock or a big barbarian, but for our character, that would be too much. So in the end, you can see that the range of motion is pretty limited, and I'm just smoothing the curve. The W rotation has almost no influence, so I haven't worked on this curve. And in the next video, we will work on the chest controller, the neck and the head.

## 05-09-Polishing the torso 02

In this video, we are going to polish the chest controller, the neck, and the head. Regarding the chest, I will start with the X Quaternion rotation. In this case, it controls the tilt forward and backward of the chest. And the method here is to emphasize the motion we add in the root of the torso. So when the character is pushing up, the chest will be pushing down. And when the character is falling, the chest will rise a bit. So it's very close to the motion we add on the torso root, but we've a one frame delay. Contact frame is on frame two, and between frame four and frame six, we have the fastest move downward as the chest is reacting to the impact on the ground. Then the chest is raising in a smoother fashion. Regarding the twisting of the torso using the Z Quaternion rotation seen in the beginning of the chapter, during a fast run, arms and shoulders are leading the motion because they are pulling the body up. And their motion is directly linked to the torso twisting. So you can see here, I'm highlighting the current chest Z Quaternion rotation, and in slight transparency, we can see the Z Quaternion rotation of the torso root controller. And we can see that the torso root is slightly delayed compared to the chest because the chest twist is leading the torso twist. Then you will find our usual mechanism. The twist is going fast during the passing pose and kind of hold during the air pose. With our chest polished, we can now jump onto the neck and head. The head and neck should not be something that complicated to animate during a run cycle, but I did a mistake, and I don't want you to get into this pitfall. When you're running, your head is pretty stable, meaning that it doesn't move that much up and down, left to right, etc. So that you can focus on your target, where you're going. So your neck is currently compensating the movement of the chest and torso. The mistake I did was trying to animate the neck and head with the neck folder still enabled. And see that right now, my head is moving a lot and our character looks more like a chicken than a human being. Probably in the same case. To fix this easily select the X key bone, which is the properties bone, and hide every channel, but the neck follow channel. On there on frame zero set the value of the neck follow property to zero. And now duplicate the key on frame 24. So now our property value is zero all the way, and the neck is no longer following the torso. It means that the neck is no longer aligned with the torso either, which looks pretty painful. The neck controller selected in the graph editor, I've hidden all the channels, but the X Quaternion rotation, which is the tilting forward and backward. And what I will do is that I will offset the whole curve on the y-axis in the graph editor until the neck is aligned. Due to the master neck controller behavior, we can see that the neck is slightly bending forward, which doesn't looks pretty good, but we can easily fix it by selecting the first tweaker bone of the neck, or forward kinematic bone, and reposition it in the 3D view. Once you're done with this controller, you can select the second tweaker bone of the neck, and rotate it the opposite way, so that we get a more natural shape for the neck. From there, we can select both controllers, get rid of all the other keys, but the one we've just created. So basically all the keys, but keys on frame zero, and duplicate the keys on frame zero to frame 24. With our neck shapes corrected, we can now get back to the neck controller and work on its motion. Since the neck rotation is now isolated from the rest of the chain, the torso root, and the chest, the head wobbles way less than before. And we can now animate the head X rotation, a bit as we did for the chest X rotation. As the character falls, the head is dragging a bit. So it's raising. After the impact of the contact frame, the neck bends forward as the head is falling. Do need to bring a bit of up and down motion to the neck with the X rotation because the head has weight, but not too much. Then I've used the Y Quaternion rotation and Z Quaternion rotation to stabilize the head in space. Since my Y curve was messy, I've decided to remove all the keys between frame zero and frame 24. Then I reset the value to zero by moving the whole curve and switch back the end goals to auto clap. Now we have a clean curve we can work with. Go on to animate the head position and stabilize a bit the head in space. When I feel that the head is moving to the right, I move it to the left using the Y Quaternion rotation curve of the neck. We don't want the head to have no left to right motion, but we do want to reduce it so that the run looks more controlled by the character. As usual, you can double check the curve as a reference, but don't forget that if you don't have the same timing in your run cycle, my curve may not fit. You need to understand the principles. Then worked on the Z Quaternion curve with the same goal in mind, kind of stabilized a bit the head. I didn't work the Z curve that much. I've kept the values very subtle. It was just to fix a bit the head position frame by frame. So I don't have that much to add to this since it's pretty close to the process I was applying to the Y rotation curve. Just looking at the head, trying to stabilize its position in space, but I keep a bit of side to side motion. In the lee, I didn't pose the head that much during the blocking, so all my rotation curves are flat, and I will only work on the X Quaternion rotation curve. As usual, we want to bring motion, but as explained before, I don't want to feel like the head is wobbling in all directions and my character can't support the weight of his head, but we want to make the drag a bit, but not that much. To do so, the tip is to track whether the chin or the nose of your character. When the head is raising, the chin will drag a bit down, and when the head is going down, the chin will slightly rise. And we are finally done with polishing the whole torso of our character.

## 05-10-Polishing the arms

[Instructor] This video, we are going to finish the polish stage of our run cycle animation by polishing the arms. Whenever you are walking with forward kinematic chains like our arms, we need to start from the root of the chain and then go down to the tip of the chin. So in this case, we will start with the shoulders, then work on the arms, Then forearms, and finally hands. To polish the shoulder animation. I will work first on the rotation, but this time I won't be isolating each rotation channel one by one, but I will work on the free channel at the same time. The idea is to smooth out the shoulder rotation, make sure that we don't have any weird movement into the shoulder or glitches. And the second thing is to make sure that the extreme will reads well and that we pushed the pose. So that we get a nice and contrasted animation. The thing to remember is that the shoulder lead the motion of the torso, the shoulder pulled the whole chest up. So rotation wise, we should avoid making the shoulder drag too much. So Kev, why is it so a little more complex to explain that what we did with the spine? But my method is to move the keys channel by channel and see all of the character behaves per channel and then work on the pose. So in this case, this is the moment where are the shoulder should be hitting it's extreme pose a little before the chest, so I'm trying to push the shoulder up and then polish the curve, make it a little smoother so that I don't have weird left to right motion during the transition. If we have a look to the final curve here, we can see that it has a pretty classic shape in the end. We get a plateau on the X rotation and the Z rotation whenever we are reaching the extreme. So it means that the shoulder is not rotating that much once it hit its highest pose whether it's forward or backward. And then we have the fast transition during the passing pose. The work on the wire rotation curve is less sensitive. We do have to work on it because it could cause a gimbal lock, but the twisting motion is that is driven by the Y eular rotation is not quite natural, but once combined with the X and Z rotation curves, it blends pretty smoothly. So the idea is just to kind of fix the orientation of the shoulder on those specific poses. I know it can sound a bit abstract here, but what I'm trying to avoid is any distortions in the shoulder shape while the X and Z curves are here to drive the motion. Don forget to use the motion path to double-check your arcs and spacing. And that you can use to tail off the bone or tip of the bone to calculate this motion path. In this case, it result in showing you the tip of the shoulder, not the root of the clavicles. At this stage, you can call the shoulder polishing done, or you can push it a little further using location. Using the Y and Z location curve, I will make the shoulder drag a bit just before it hits it's extreme, but I don't want to delay the shoulder. So I reset the pose by moving the keys that has a zero value on frame six. And then I will slightly push the shoulder down during the passing pose so that when you put weight into the shoulder, as if just after the impact, it was getting pulled down by its own weight, then I will do the same in the pose just after it reaches it's highest point. I will push it a little higher as if there was momentum into the shoulder that make it go a little further up. So I keep it very subtle. The idea is just to emphasize what we did before. Whenever the shoulder is in it's down pose, I make it drag a little bit just to touch and I push it down a little more. And when it has reach its highest point, one or two frame later, I will just raise it a little more to bring a bit of momentum into the shoulder motion. The heavy lifting was done with the rotation, and this is what will brings you nice arcs. And then you can bring some texture to your animation using location. Again, it must be subtle because if you push too far, you will break the shape of the shoulder and it will look pointy or out of place. Unleashing the arm is pretty straightforward. One of the first thing you may do is track the position of the elbow tweak controller so that you can easily track your arcs from the elbow. I also often use the end position using the wrist tweaker controller, but at this stage it will be better to focus on the elbow position. While on the reference, we have seen that there was a slight slowing down during the passing pose, and then reaccelerating whether forward or backward, this is really noticeable when using extreme slow motion. And when I've tried, it felt a bit weird. So in my case, I prefer to have a fast motion during the passing and ease into the extreme and old pose, which clearly shows when we look at the spacing on those arcs, we have a large spacing during the passing and it gets tighter on up pose. Shape wise from a side view, the arc is very smooth. From the front view, my main concern was not to make the elbow going too far on the outside because the faster you run, the closer to the body your elbow will be. And then I make sure it goes slightly on the inside on both extremes. Third wise, we have a smooth sensory dull shape regarding the X rotation, which mainly influence the distance between the chest and the elbow from the front view. And then the Z and Y rotation curve mainly drive the swing of the arm. So we can spot on them our usual plateaus shape when we reach the extreme, weave the fast transition during the passing. I've also slightly worked the W curve just to remove any glitches. The W curve is generally involved whenever you are trying to reach an extreme with the other curve and the quaternions can't solve it. So unless you are doing a full revolution, the W curve is generally not that much involved. But it does need some attention on such a moving part, since it's a long forward kinematic chain, it's in everything, the movement of the torso, then the movement of the shoulder, et cetera. So we do need to double check the motion path of the elbow and eye my Y, Z and X rotation curve are kind of smooth in the graph editor. I'm just double checking that the W curve is not bringing any glitches. In the end, as for every cycle we've been working on, make sure that your first and last keys are the same and they are aligned.

## 05-11-Polishing forearms and Hands

So this is the final stage of this animation, where we will polish the forearms and the hands. As we did before with the arm, I advise you to use the wrist tweaker controller to track the arcs. If we have a look to the final version of this run cycle, we can see that the forearm eats it's extreme at frame three when moving back. This is the moment where the elbow is the most open. Then when we're studying the reference, we have seen that as the elbow is reaching its extreme on frame eight, the four arm is bending inward to compensate. After frame eight, the elbow or arm start to rotate forward and the forearm is still closing until frame 11 and from frame 12 to frame 15, the forearm is slightly open before closing again, while it reaches its highest point. So as we watch the references, we understand that it's a little more complex than a simple follow-through animation. Forearm polished, we can now jump to the hands. Only play with the rotation channels of the hands. There is not that much to track regarding the hands. We could track one of the knuckle joints, if we do want to track the arcs of the tip of the hands. In my case, I jumped back to the reference and I'm really focusing on using both hands. You can see how it dives inward as if he was swimming. So my goal is not to have this level of exaggeration, in this kind of swimming motion, where he's really trying to pull himself forward. Again, it does show us that the hand is not only dragging back during the motion. So instead of showing you all, I've pushed each controller in the rough editor. We'll have a look to the final results on the right. When the hand is moving forward, as it reaches the passing pose, it's relaxed as it is dragging a bit. This is the time where the Z value is at its maximum. Then as the arm reaches its extreme pose forward, the hand curves toward the head and as the arm comes down, the hand drags a bit. So on frame zero 24, the hand is reaching its opposite extreme where the thumb is getting closer to the forearm by rotating the wrist. Then the Z curve makes a quick bump on frame three. This is where the hand is trying to reach backward to get this kind of swimming pose, as if the character was trying to pull himself forward. The wrist and forearm are almost aligned. And then as the arm reaches its extreme on the back, the hand is curving forward as if it was compensating the movement of the elbow and get ready to dive forward. So from the side view, mostly working on the Z turn and rotation, we can see that it's a little more complex than a simple drag again. If we now have a close look to the Y and X rotation curves, we can see they have a sinusoidal shape because they will mainly influence the twisting of the wrist and its left to right motion. So they are mainly used to keep a nice shape of the wrist that doesn't look too broken. The hand is slightly more rotated inward around frame 14 during the passing as if it was pointing toward the place it wants to be. So, that's not super complicated when it comes to work from the front view, just try not to have two broken wrists. And if you have something to remember about this polishing it's that the hand is not necessarily dragging during the run cycle animation, which is a common mistake. From there, we will be able to mirror the motion of the left arm onto the right arm. So I've pressed Alt + H to unhide all the curves. And then I will select all the controllers of the left arm, the shoulder, arm, forearm, and the hand controller we have polished. In the graph editor press eight, to select all the curves, press Control + C to copy the curves. And then I will jump onto the other arm, select the shoulder, arm, forearm, and hand controller. Select all the keys but the one on frame zero and delete them and then select all the keys on frame zero and press Control + Shift + V to paste the mirrored animation. Then, as we did for the previous cycles, I will duplicate over the curve by pressing Shift + D, X and 24 to offset them by 24 frames on the x-axis. Then I will press eight to select everything, press G X minus 12, to offset them back by 12 frames. This way we have a 12 frames offset between the right arm and the left arm. Finally, I will move the play head on frame zero. Press I to insert the key frame on all controllers, then select all the keys I just returned on frame zero. Press V and set the angles to three. I will then select them again, press Shift + D and 24 to duplicate them on frame 24. And now I can get rid of any key frames before and after frame zero and frame 24 and our run cycle is finally done. In the next video I will just share with you a few tips on how you can change a bit your run cycle with ease. As always when it comes to art, you will have to make multiple run cycles until you get them right.

## 05-12-Changing attitude with curve offset

[Instructor] I'd like to finish this chapter with a little tip video. We have seen in the previous chapters that we can use the NLA editor to layer different animations and modify the current one. To create an ad term, for example, or to transition between two different animations. But what you can do to rapidly modify your run cycle and create iterations is to simply offset different curves on your main controllers. For example, here, I've offset the X quaternion rotation of the torso. Now, I'm doing the same with the neck controller. I will do the same with the hips, with the chest, and this is very easy to push those curves to get a totally new attitude for our character. On a locomotion cycle, you will generally favorize the rotation around the x-axis of the different torso controller. But you can also move the Y location of the torso root, and get a more cartoony, afraid-like run cycle. Or in the other end, push everything forward so that you get a way more accelerated, dynamical run cycle. This is a very good and fast technique to explore different versions of your cycle. And that can be very useful in a studio environment to explore different moods for your run cycle. You can play with all the different controllers. You can offset the Y location of the foot, for example, so that they will be offset forward or backward during the run cycle. You may want to fix the neck orientation using the secondary controllers. In one word, have fun with your animation! And make additional use of the work you did on this run cycle. It will sure need a pass of polish once you've totally changed the pose of your character, but it's a very fast and painless way to explore new poses, new attitude, and bring life to your character.

## 06-01 Introduction

[Tutor] Welcome to chapter six. In this chapter, we are going to build another cycle and it's going to be vanilla walk cycle. As explained before, we are doing this walk cycle after the run cycle, because it's a little bit harder, since it's more subtle to get an appealing result. As usual, we'll go through a reference analysis and we'll try to identify the main mechanism involved into a good walk cycle. Starting from scratch, we'll build the main key poses of the walk cycle, and then we'll mix our post to pose and layered approach to polish the walk. I will guide you through the whole process from polishing the feet to the fingers of the character. Let's get started.

## 06-02-Reference analysis

[Instructor] Before we jump into animating our character, we will go through a little reference analysis. Here are a couple of references you can use and that we are going to analyze. As usual, you will find a link in the documentation. As for the run cycle, we can identify specific key poses that we are going to block. The first one is the contact pose, where the front foot heel is contacting the ground and the body starts to get lower. Then, a few frames later, we have the down pose. This is the time where the back foot is about to leave the ground, and where the center of gravity is at its lowest point. This is also the moment where the weight is totally shifted onto the side of the foot touching the ground. Next is the passing pose. Generally, the arms are almost aligned with the body and the center of gravity is aligned with the supporting foot. The back foot is catching up just before the up pose, or pushing pose. This is the time where the COG is at its highest point. The contacting foot heel is starting to raise, while the opposite foot is swinging forward pretty fast. And the center of gravity is starting to move toward the next contact pose. And so the cycle repeat on the other side. So as for our run cycle, a classic walk cycle can be mirrored. As for the run cycle, we will have to nail the center of gravity up-and-down motion, and also left-to-right motion. Let's have a look to the shoulder and hips of those walking characters. Let's start with the twisting motion on the rotation around the vertical axis. As for the run cycle, it's pretty straightforward. The hips will twist toward the leading foot. So on this contact pose, the hips are twisting toward the left foot and the shoulders are twisting the opposite way. So we will find here a lot of common mechanism that we add during the run cycle, and those mechanism will also apply whenever we are animating other body mechanic. The other classic motion is the leaning of the shoulder versus the leaning of the hips. If we have a look to the down pose, which is one of the most contrasted pose, the hips are raising toward the contacting foot because the leg is pushing to support the weight. And as seen during the run cycle, we have a contrapose here also, where the shoulder are leaning the opposite way. When we were walking on the run cycle animation, we have seen that the shoulder were kind of leading the animation, pulling the body forward and upward. Think of the walk cycle as a controlled falling forward. We push our body forward, and as we fall, our foot catch up. The arms are swinging in reaction; they are not leading the animation. And so we get a pendulum, or swinging motion, back and forth, with an easing on both extreme and a subtle drag of the hands. We will also have a bit of a swinging motion in the feet, and as the feet contact the ground, it then move at constant speed. There is also a bit of left-to-right motion on the feet where, during the passing pose, they get on the outside, and during the contacting pose, they are a bit on the centered line beneath the character. These are some of the basics that we do need to nail when we are going to (indistinct) our walk cycle. We could analyze those references for a long time, but let's get into blocking our walk cycle and we'll get into detail whenever we are polishing each part of the character.

## 06-03-Walk Blocking 01

Let's start the blocking of our walk cycle. I will start where I've left in the last chapter and I will create a new action. So, I will go into Pose mode, select my character, and press this icon to duplicate the run cycle. From there, I can rename it and click the shield icon to make sure I won't lose this data whenever I restart Blender. Now I will select all the key frames but the one on frame zero and I will press X to delete them. Now we need to make sure that we have clean channels. Since we have worked in the graph editor on many curves, I need to make sure that I reset those curves. In my action editor, I will press Control+Tab to switch to the graph editor, and enable "show hidden." I will then press Alt+H to make sure that I reveal all the curves. And from there, I will press A to select them all, press the T key and switch everything to Bezier. Then I will press the V key and switch everything to Autoclamp. Now, everything is reset. If you have a look to the key frames, we can see that they have a round shape, meaning that they are all set to Autoclamp. If I switched to Vector, for example, they become square. If I switch to Align, they will have this kind of diamond shape. Now, we need to reset the pose of our character before we start working. So, I will make sure that I have all my controllers available. And as you can see here, my UI didn't load, So what I will do is open the text editor and with trident rig script selected, I will press the play button. Now to make sure that it automatically play whenever I reload the file, I will go to Text, and enable Registered. From there, in the rig UI, I will enable all the layers and press A in the 3D view to select all my controllers. And I will press Alt+R, Alt+G and Alt+S to reset the rotation scale and location of all the controllers. Once I'm done with that, I can hide the controller we won't be using. So we can hide the root, the torso tweak from the time being, all the face controller, keep the leg I-case, keep the arm eighth-case. While we will be using them, we can hide the hands. And we will hide every weapons controllers. I will just rotate a bit the arm of the characters so that he looks a bit more relaxed and we can get started. The first pose we are going to build is the contact pose. Let's have a quick look to the references to spot the key features of this pose. This is the moment where both feet are contacting the ground and are further away, one from the other. Both are on the extreme. One on the heel, one on the toes. The hips are slightly tilted up from the back leg that is pushing. The chest is slightly tilting the same way as it is transitioning into the next pose where we will have the contrapposto. But it's twisted the opposite way compared to the hips toward the front arm. Toward the front arm, the center of gravity is almost centered, but it's a bit favorizing the back foot. Note that the reference on the right is showing someone with an athletic walk, so the arm swing motion is a bit extreme. We will keep our walk cycle a little more relaxed, with less amplitude. We will start our first pose by posing the feet. You may choose to push whether the left or right foot forward and the other one backward. Then we can use the role controller to raise the toes for the front leg and raise the heel for the back leg. I will lower a bit the center of gravity to make sure that the legs are not stretching. Don't forget to pose the toes on the front foot as they are dragging a bit before they contact the ground. On this walk cycle animation, I will try not to rotate on the side or twist the torso root controller. I will slightly rotate it forward to give a more dynamic pose to our character. But we will mainly use this root torso controller for the up-and-down and side-to-side motion. I have twisted the hips toward the front foot and I'm twisting the chest toward the front arm. Remember to pose the arms the opposite way as the foot. When the left foot is forward, the right arm is forward. Also remember that your elbow is supposed to rotate only on its local Z axis. You can't rotate your elbow around multiple axes. So when it comes to posing the arm, I mainly use the arm controller to orientate the arm. Another thing to double check so that we don't get the same problem as during the run cycle is to make sure that both the neck and head have their rotation fully disabled. As usual, I'm showing the final pose we are supposed to reach. Don't forget to slightly shift the weight of the character on its back leg by selecting the torso root controller and slightly move it on the X axis. Left to right motion will be more pronounced on the walk cycle than on the run cycle. Here you can see me fighting a bit with the pose of the hips and the chest because I wasn't looking at the reference. So I was trying to set a contrapposto while the chest should be almost horizontal. The only contrapposto that occur is the twisting. I'm tweaking the pose to make sure that my character look balanced. Take the time to properly refine this pose, because this is the one we are going to use to build the other ones. And it will communicate a lot about your character. From there, I will re-enable the hand layer and I will slightly pose the hands. So I will build a default pose on one of the hand, by slightly curving the palm controller and each finger to make the hand pose a bit more relaxed. Then I will select all the left hand controllers. Press Control+C to copy the pose and Control+Shift+V to paste it, mirrored on the other side. So as I explained before, after watching my references I've decided to slightly realign the chest, to have my shoulders more into an horizontal line as on the reference. Don't forget to double check the arm position, the hands position, using the reference, as this is the extreme pose for both arms. Then you can push a little bit the feet toward the inside. It will look a little more natural and less robotic. The more you push the feet toward the inside on a central line, the more feminine. So if you were to animate a stereotyped sexy woman, you would push the feet toward a central line. This is the kind of pose you will see in a fashion show. But it doesn't really fit our character so let's cancel this and jump into the next video.

## 06-04-Walk Blocking 02

[Instructor] Let's go ahead with our walk cycle blocking. Before we go ahead, we need to check our frame rate. Since I'm using the same file as the run cycle, my frame rate is still As explained in the previous video, it's pretty common for feature film to use a 24 frame per second frame rate. And since I'm used to animate for video game, I tend to use 30 frame per seconds. I will stick to 30 frame per second, but it doesn't really matter if you want to switch to 24 frame per seconds. A walk cycle can be on 18, 24, 26, 30, whatever number of frame you want, depending on the style of walk cycle you are doing. For vanilla walk cycle, we generally use 24 frames, based at 24 frame per second. Basically, a cycle of one second. So I will stick to those but I will keep my 30 frame per second frame rate. So it will be a little less than one second cycle. And if I feel like I need to change the length of the walk cycle to have a good feedback, I will do it later on. So don't get stuck with numbers. You can change the number of frame at reel depending on the visual feedback. So to mark the end of the cycle, I will duplicate all the keys from frame zero and move them on frame 24. I will place the playhead on frame 23, and I will press Control + End, so that our animation plays from frame zero to frame 23. So the first thing I will do is re-enable all my controllers, I will select them all and I will press Control + C to copy the current pose, go to frame 12 and press Control + Shift + V to mirror the pose. Since our character is symmetrical, we can mirror it halfway through the cycle on frame 12, and since we are at the blocking stage, I will select all my keys, press T, and switch to constant so that I don't have any interpolation on my controllers. The next pose we are going to build is the down pose. Looking at the reference, it's the moment where the torso root is at its lowest point. The front foot has already starting moving backward, but it's not centered beneath the center of gravity. The back foot just left or is leaving the ground. This depends on your work cycle style or the reference you are using. The front arm start swinging backward while the back arm is starting swinging forward. The hips are pushed by the contacting legs, while the shoulder are tilting the opposite way. Let's start posing our character. I will move to frame three and insert a keyframe on all controllers. We will basically build the key pose every three frames. As for the first pose, I will start with the feet, so I will cancel the rotation on the toes and the heel controller on the front foot, and I will move it backward. Since it's contacting the ground, I'm moving it straight on the y-axis. I will lower the center of gravity using the torso controller and as I'm putting weight onto the left leg, I will shift the center of gravity toward the left leg. I will push the back leg further away backward, and I will rotate the heel controller. This way, the heel will reach its highest point before the foot leave the ground, keeping the leg slightly bent. Finally, I will slightly push the center of gravity forward. I will tilt and rotate the hips toward the supporting leg and I will also slightly twisted them. We can now build our contact pose with the chest controller by making it leaning a bit toward the supporting foot. I will also slightly twist the chest to follow the arm motion. I will slightly rotate the shoulder backward and then rotate the arm backward, and I will slightly rotate the forearm and hand forward to build a follow through motion or dragging motion. I will do the same on the other arm. I will slightly move the shoulder forward, and then I will rotate the arm forward a bit and the forearm and hand backward, so the arm is a bit extended. My character pose feels a bit out of balance, so I will tweak the position of the center of gravity and I will also tweak the arm position on the very first pose we built because I felt that the arm was a bit too, on the outside. Since I've refined the pose, I need to re-mirror it on frame 12 and reduplicate it on frame 24 or at least paste the new pose. From there, I will jump between frames zero and frame three using the up and down arrow, and see, or merge, the center of gravity of the character is moving. It will reach its extreme side to side pose onto the next one. So I need to find a good in between here. The second thing I've been watching was the position of the front hand. In the front view, when I was comparing the poses, it seems that the hand wasn't moving in space. So I've slightly rotated the forearm backward. And we can now work on the next pose. Next pose is the passing pose. It's the moment where the supporting foot is right under the center of gravity. The opposite leg is catching up, both arm are almost aligned with the torso, the hips are no longer twisted, but this is the time where the leg pushed the most on them and they are raising the most. The chest is no longer twisting neither and depending on your reference, it might be almost horizontal or slightly tilting toward the supporting leg too. Building a soft contour posing. Note that we will have to slightly move the person leg, the one that not contacting the ground to the side. Let's now work on our character so I will jump onto frame six, I will move the left foot backward, along the y-axis, under the center of gravity of my character and then on frame six in the action editor, I will key all the controllers. This is the time where the center of gravity reach it's extreme on the side, toward the supporting leg and also moment where the character starts pushing on the supporting leg so we can raise the center of gravity. Now I will position the right leg just before the left leg and raise it a bit. We also need to rotate the heel upward and as explained before, from the front view, I will slightly move it to the left and rotate it to the left. One super important thing to mention whenever you are building a walk cycle. Humans and mammals, in general, are lazy. So we are raising our foot as less as possible, meaning, that during the passing pose where the foot reach its highest point, keep it close to the ground. A beginner mistake is to raise the foot, way to high. Now, jumping onto the hips controller, this is the moment where the leg pushed the most onto the hip, so we need to raise it to the side and regarding the twisting, we can almost cancel it. I will do the same with the chest. I will almost cancel any twisting and I will, very slightly, make it tilt toward the pushing leg so I'm canceling its rotation and slightly tilting it. Regarding the arms, it's pretty straightforward. You can slightly move the shoulder backward or forward depending on the motion of the arm, mainly move the arm controller and slightly catch-up with the forearm, and make the hand drag a bit. You can use the reference provided to, to refine your pose. I'm not yet posing the fingers, and as you have may noticed, I haven't posed neither the neck or the head. This is because we will work on this animation a bit, as we did regarding the run cycle. We are blocking the main pose, trying to make them as accurate as possible, and during the polishing stage, we will bring a bit of up and down on the chest and the head and a bit of rotation in the head and the fingers. The raised foot need a little more work, we need to raise the heel away more and also, slightly rotate the toes toward the ground as they are dragging. After reviewing my poses and the references, I've decided to rotate more the foots on the outside. On some reference and depending on the character you are animating, the foots can be slightly rotated to the side even when hitting the ground. Rotating the foot on the outside or the inside will define your character profile. It could be extremely open for a cowboy, for example, or tilting toward the inside for a shy kid or a shy girl, for example. For the sake of this course, I will keep it straight. And we can jump on the final pose. Let's have a look to the latest pose we need to block. It's the up pose or pushing pose. The supporting leg is slightly on the back, and it's heel starts to raise. The other foot is slightly forward, and it has starting rotating so that the heel can get in contact in the next pose. The arms are swinging the opposite direction compared to the legs and almost reach their extreme poses that they will reach in the next pose. The hands are moving the faster in space between the passing and the pushing pose. The hips are still pushed by the supporting leg, but they have start shifting toward the other one. They are as usual, slightly twisting toward the different feet. The chest is twisting in the opposite way and is slightly raised toward the front arm. As the leg push, the center of gravity is moving toward the opposite foot. Let's build this final pose and see how it look. I will jump on from nine and insert a key frame on all controller. We can push the center of gravity up, and start moving it on the opposite side of the pushing leg. I will move the pushing leg backward along the y-axis and then I will raise the heel using the heel controller. I'm raising the heels so that I have a subtle bending in the leg. I will then select the other foot and move it forward. I will then rotate it backward using the heel controller and relax a bit, the toes, by rotating them a bit forward. I will keep them slightly rotated toward the ground so that we can feel that they are dragging the feet. I will slightly rotate the foot controller toward the outside and from the front view, I will slightly push it on the inside toward the contacting pose. Since I rotated a bit the foot, I need to align the knee by moving the pole targets slightly to the outside. I will slightly reduce the tilting of the hips and then I will slightly twist them so that they are align with the feet. I will slightly tilt the chest so that it's slightly upward toward the front arm, the left one, and twist it toward the front arm too, then I would rotate the front arm forward and slightly twist it so that it almost match the pose on frame 12. This is why I'm comparing both poses. As explained previously, the arms almost reach their extreme pose during the pushing and reach their extreme during the contact pose. So the shoulder and elbow are easing into frame 12. The forearm is catching up and the hand is likely dragging backward. As usual, you can use the image reference to guide you. As seen during the run cycle chapter, a good blocking is important, but it doesn't mean that we won't be able to modify the animation during the polishing stage. It can be harder to spot the problem during the blocking, and it's sometimes pop to the eye whenever switching to spline or playing the whole animation. So just make the best looking you can and then copy each pose by selecting all the controller, press Control + C to copy the pose, jump 12 frame later and press Control + Shift + V and repeat the process for each poses. Once you are done with this, you can finally play your animation and see your walk cycle blocked. I advise you to watch it for a moment, rotate around the character and also switch between autographic and perspective view. In my case, I feel like there's something a little off. My character is pushed too much forward. So instead of reworking each poses one by one, I will select the torso controller and I will switch to the graph editor and isolate the y location curve. Remember what we have seen in the very last lesson of the run cycle chapter? We can offset a whole curve from a transform channel to modify the animation. I've hidden all the curve, but the y curve and I will press G and Y to constraint it on the y-axis in the graph editor and move it up so that it will push the torso controller off my character slightly backward. And now he looks way more balanced. In the next video, we will be able to jump into splining and polishing the different features of our character.

## 06-05-Polishing the feet

[Instructor] In this video, we will start polishing our walk cycle. As following cycle, we will apply some kind of layered method, meaning that we will start by polishing the feet, then the root of the torso, and then the different features of the body. As explained in the previous video, we may have to change the timing of this animation. Vanillia cycle is generally around one second, maybe a little more, since I'm animating a 30 frame per second. A current animation is about 0.8 seconds. To get a better feeling about this, I will select all my keys and I will switch to Bezier by pressing the T key. Oh when I played the animation, it definitely feels a bit too fast. What I want to do is push the length of this animation a little over 30 frame. Let's try 32 frame. So I will set the end of the animation on frame 31. Now, with all my keys selected, I will put to play head on frame 0 and press S scale til the latest keys are aligned with frame 32. This way, all the keys have been offset by one frame. I now have a key pose every four frames. My walk cycle rhythm looks way more natural. With my amateur in pose mode, I will select the foot and I will press control tab over the action editor to switch to the graph editor. I will then click to show selected only icon. We will start by idling all the curve but the location curves. Whether you're working on the run or a walk cycle, the first thing you want is to fix whenever the feet is in contact with the ground. This the contacting foot is supposed to move at a constant speed. You need a linear interpolation between the first contacting frame and the last contacting frame. In our case, between frame 0 and frame 20. You can easily get to this result by converting the key frames on those contacting pose to vector using the V key, and then we can get rid of all the key frame in between. The same then apply to the Z and X key, won't be any up and down or side to side motion while the foot is on the ground. Select the Z and X curve keys and I will press the dot key to zoom in. There should be no variation between frame 0 and frame 20 so I will simply duplicate frame 12, which is the same as frame 20, and move it by pressing G and X on the x-axis toward frame 20. Pressing the V key, I can transform the end-alls on frame 0 and frame 20 to vector and get rid of all the keys in between. And here we have fixed our curve whenever the foot is in contact with the ground, a little detail here. Since I have created this animation by duplicating our run cycle, we can see that we have a loop modifier or cycling modifier onto our curve and they do repeat over time. I select all the curve, I can press shift E and use a clear cyclic modifier to get rid of it. But since we are walking on a cycle, it does make sense to keep the modifier. So I will press shift E and select make cyclic again. Before I start polishing the curve, I will calculate the motion path. Use the foot controller as a reference point or you can choose the toe controllers. As explained before, I will press Q to calculate the motion path since I've made it one of my quick favorite, and I'm calculating it over frame 0 to 32. Before I jump into polishing, I've tracked the motion of the foot on the reference. And before whenever the foot is contacting the ground, it's moving with a linear fashion. Then we can see an ease in and ease out whenever it's starting to raise. It's accelerating until the passing pose but also losing altitude. And then, it raise again, go a little beyond the contact pose and fall. On the run cycle, we will polish one foot and then we will mirror the animation onto the other one. To help myself, I will go in front of you and press Alt B and frame off of the character so that I see only the left foot, the one I'm going to work on. From there, let's start polishing the location of the foot. I will start with the Y location. As usual, I will display the polish curve as a reference. In studying the reference, we've seen that the foot was traveling a bit backward when leaving the ground. So I'm pushing a bit the curve on frame 22 as if it was some kind of overshoot. We get a smooth arc in the curve and then an acceleration toward the next contacting pose. And as shown in the reference, the foot travels a bit further than the contacting pose before contacting on frame 32. So the value of the curve on frame 31 is lower, so further forward than on frame 32. We'll go back in the front of view, press Q to access my quick favorite and update the motion path. We now need to work on the up and down of the foot. As you can see, it's very linear for the time being. As seen in the reference, the highest point for the foot is going to be just after leaving the ground and just before hitting the ground. I'm raising the control point on frame 24 and then I will lower it next to the passing pose. We want the toes to almost touch the ground. I will move the previous extreme up from from 24 to frame 23 to have a smoother motion. I will also move the next extreme on frame 30 so that the foot gets high and then slap onto the ground. And now we can see that we have a motion path that is very close to what we had on the reference. Note that the keys on the contacting frames all have their end-alls set to vectors so that we don't have any easing when the foot is leaving the ground or when it's contacting the ground. We can now switch to front view, editing the left to right motion is going to be pretty straightforward. I will frame the curve and I will give it a little parabolic shape, making sure that the foot is at its extreme on the side that whenever we are hitting the passing pose. We are starting to get decent results regarding the location of this foot controller. Let's work on the foot roll. I prefer to start walking on the rotation using the heel controller because it's the main rotation controller of the foot, at least on the walk cycle. And then, I will get back on the foot to tweak and input some subtle rotation to the foot. To touch the ground, the foot should be slapping. Though, I want a fast motion between the contacting pose and the flat foot position. So I will offset the key with a value of zero on the frame 1 and I will switch the end-all to vector. This way, the foot is getting flat on the ground over one frame with a clean curve. After the passing pose when the heel is raising, I want a slight acceleration. So I want my curve to look more like a parabolic one. Also, I need to offset a bit the moment the heels start to raise. It's just after the passing pose, around frame 10, not frame 8. I will fix this a little later. Right now, I'm just pushing the pose to make sure that the foot has a smoother motion. I want to hold a bit the pose where the foot is pointing down. So I will duplicate the key on frame 24 to frame 25 and create a slight plateau. Then I want to create the flapping or whipping motion, meaning that the toes will get higher just before they hit the ground. So I need to push the curve down just before the contacting pose. From there, I will kind of fine tune each pose. It's more about motion feeling, that's something I can't really explain. And I will fix the moment the heel raise by delaying it by two frames. Next, we are going to work on the X rotation of the main toe controller. We're going to have the same behavior as the tale of this hero character. It will have a subtle overlapping or full of emotion. In this case, we will be only animating the axialer rotation of the toes. It's very simple. We want the toes to slightly drag. So basically, you want them to point toward their previous position. As the foot flap on the ground and is getting flat, I will slightly raise the toes. Then later, I will make them flat and then switch their end-alls to vector. Then working on the moment the foot leave the ground, I will switch the end-all on frame 20 to vector to make sure that the rotation of the toes is accelerating as they are pulled backward. And I will make sure I have some dragging of the toes until frame 30, not bending them too much or the motion too stylized and the foot will look very loose. And as I a hard time getting the right position for the toes on frame 30, it's simply add another key frame here and animate on ones. Animating on ones means that you add a key frame or drawing on each single frames. It's perfect when you have a complex motion on very few frame to key each frame and work each poses, one by one. With our toes now polished, we can switch back to the foot and work a bit on its rotation. We will keep it simple and only work on the Z quadrillion rotation. Foot motion when going into details can be very complex. We want to push the level of realism further. You need to study your reference frame by frame. Check out which part of the foot is contacting first, whether the weight is more on the edge, on the middle of the foot, on the ball of the foot, et cetera, is there any squashing or slight shaking motion of the ankle? All those subtle movement brings what we call texture to the animation and we'll make your animation looks less CG and more subtle. So in the end, I'm just slightly pushing the rotation we have already input during the blocking. And I will just input a bit of rotation toward the inside when the foot is leaving the ground and toward the outside when the foot is getting to the next contact pose. This will translate the fact that there is more pressure under the big toe when the foot is leaving the ground. While we favorize weight over the outer edge of the foot when contacting. It's a subtle weight transfer from the outside of the foot to the inside of the foot, between the contacting pose and the pushing pose. So we can translate this by inputting a bit of rotation when the foot is leaving the ground toward the inside. This is not a golden rule because it will vary from people to people based on your weight, the size of your hips, your orientation of your knees, even a subtle foot rotation will bring personality to your character. Before we mirror the animation, we need to slightly rework the knee. So basically, we just need to rework the left to right motion of the pole targets. I will just input a bit of delay based on the rotation of the foot. Most of the time, your foot and your knee are aligned. So when the toe is pointing inward, I will push the knee in between inward. And when the toe is pointing on the outside, guess what? I will push a bit, the pole target, on the outside. The X and Y curve don't have that much inference, I prefer to remove any key frames that are not set to zero. Once my keys were more or less defined, I've moved them away one from the other to get a smoother and slower motion. With this to avoid any noisy motion of the knee. There can be a bit of noise on the knee motion during the impact, especially on the heavy character, you will use the knee tweaker and input a bit of up and down motion whenever the feet are contacting the ground. But since our character is pretty lightweight, I prefer to keep a smooth motion of the knee following the foot. With the whole leg finally polished, we can now mirror the motion onto the other leg. This is something we have already done several time in this course so I guess you know all to do it, but I will repeat the process. I first selected all the controller of the left leg. Press Alt H to reveal all the curve and press A to select them all, then press control C to copy those curve. Then I will select all the controller of the opposite leg. I will also press Alt H to make sure that there is no curve hiding. I will select all the keys but the one on frame 0 and delete them. Then I will select all the keys and press control shift to V. Now, both my legs are moving the same way. I will press shift to D to duplicate X and 32 to offset by 32 frame. That way, I have two cycle for the right leg and now I can offset it back by half the length of the motion by pressing G, X, and minus 16. I have an alternate motion of both legs. I will go on frame 0 and insert a key frame on all the channels. Then select those key frame, press V and switch them to three. This way their end-all curvature won't change if I remove the previous keys. Then press Shift to D to duplicate those frame and move them on frame 30 to sway the first and last keys of the cycle of the same and we can remove any keys after frame 32 and before frame 0. And we now have both our legs polished and we can jump into the next video where we will be polishing the torso.

## 06-06-Walk Polish Torso

Start polishing the torso of our character. As usual, I will start with the torso route controller. This is something we have been doing on all the previous lessons, whether it was the robot or the squirrel character or the run cycle on this character. What I want to point out here is that the motion of the torso root is one of the most important parts of your character. Define the center of gravity motion of your character. Hence it will define the weight and rhythm of your walk cycle, which is the most important notion in body mechanic. Start with the up and down motion, or Z location curve, which is the most important on the walk cycle. Right now, the curve looks very (indistinct) and very smooth but it seems that the extreme are pretty well positioned in time. Goal will be to bring contrast to the motion by holding a bit the down pose and the up pose. We will have a slight plateau on the highest and the lowest values of the curve. On the extreme up, I'm trying to have the leg almost fully extended. Here I'm comparing the previous pose with the new one. During the pushing or up pose, I'm trying to get an almost straight leg. This give a better shape to the leg and a better line of action to it. We will talk about line or action in detail in the next chapter. To make it simple here, it makes the silhouette of our character more readable. As the straight leg supports the idea of verticality, of pushing up. So I've polished the first half of the motion, I will first duplicate the extreme down on frame four and move it by 16 frame of the length of the cycle, get rid of all the key frame after frame 20. And they will duplicate the polished portion of the curve from frame four to frame 20 and move it by 16 frames. There I can select the key on frame 32, if you don't have one and you can insert a key frame there and move it on frame zero. You treat of any keys that goes beyond our 32 frame rail. If needed, don't forget to rotate to beat the keys on frame zero and 32 to align the curve from one cycle to the other. Where you are polishing a specific feature or area of your character, don't hesitate to hide the other part. So I will add that to the visibility properties panel and I will hide arms and hide the arms (indistinct) controllers. I do so I remove visual noise and I feel like the up and down motion while it's properly timed is a bit too strong. To make sure I'm using the bounding box as a pivot point so that I can scale the whole curve on an average. I will simply scale the whole curve on the Y axis by pressing S and then Y. You can also move the whole curve along the Y axis in the (indistinct) to either raise or lower the center of gravity of your character. I want my character to almost have a straight leg whenever he is pushing so that it feels lightweight. With the up and down motion now polished, I will jump to the side to side motion, working on the explication. We'll add the Z location and display the X location curve. It currently looks a bit messy. We are going to fix it pretty quickly. First thing we need to do is identify the extremes. Weight mainly shift between the contact pose and the passing pose. Then the body is to decide during the pushing pose, before the body starts falling on the other side and accelerate, shifting the weight onto the other leg. To the polished curve, when zero we have the contact pose, and we are almost reached the extreme on frame six in the curve is until frame 11, where we start pushing. Frame 11 to frame 15, we slowly shift the weight onto the other side until the contact pose where we will have a fast change in direction. So you really want to shift the weight from side to side during the fall, whenever the leg is about to contact the ground and contact the ground. And as the character recover with this contacting leg and start pushing on it, it will first absorb the momentum and then start pushing on the other side. As usual, you can refer to the current curve on this plane, but if you want to properly learn, mostly focus on what we've just explained first motion during the fall, and then easing from the transition. I was getting close to a convincing result I want to be able to properly symmetrize the motion. Note that this is not mandatory. If you have a difference between the left to right motion, it can be interesting as a real life walk cycle is never perfect, but I just want to show you how to mirror the curve over time. I will get rid of any curves that goes beyond half of the cycle. After frame 16, we select all the other keys, duplicate them and move them by 16 frame on the X axis. Now, my side to side motion repeat over 16 frame, but always go onto the same side. You need to symmetrize the value of our curve along the Y axis and around the value zero, we can easily do this by using the 2D cursor. It is defined by the play at position for the X value and this horizontal blue line for the Y value. Since we want to symmetrize our curve around the value zero, we need to reposition our 2D cursor horizontal value to zero. Precisely set this value by adding to the view tab where we can see the play at position named cursor X value and the Y value. So I would replace the current Y value by zero. Now, I just have to make sure that I'm using the 2D cursor as a pivot point, scale on the Y axis by minus one, the keys from frame 16 to frame 32. This way, we make sure that our cycle is currently cycling. And then I will clean a bit the curve, removing the keys that talk too close one to the other, and doesn't bring any information. From there, we can work on the Y location axis of our torso. Polishing the Y curve is going to be pretty simple because it has a very subtle influence onto our walk cycle. If you don't want to play with this curve, that's fine, but you should always input a bit of motion. By that is that since we are animating our walk cycle on the spot, the torso route forward and backward wise should it be on the spot too. There is always a bit of variation of our time while your whole body is moving in a linear fashion, the are variation for every single point in the body of your character. Thing to know is that as the character is falling forward, just before the contact pose, the body is accelerating forward. And as soon as the foot is hitting the ground, the body will slow down and move backward. Double check the values of my curve. You can see that the range of motion is very, very subtle. It just brings some extra texture to the motion. Our torso root is now polished. And in the next video, we are going to polish the other features of the torso.

## 06-07 Walk polishing torso 02

[Instructor] We will start polishing the torso with the hips controller. As mentioned in the previous video, you should always start polishing the controllers that have the most influence or that move the most. In the case of the hips controller, it's gonna be the tilting motion and twisting motion. And those are driven by the rotation, I've hidden all the other key. Now I'm testing each curve to check what channel does what. The Z curve twist, the Y curve tilt. So I will start with the Y curve. I can now hide all the other curves. The hips motion is pretty critical on the walk cycle. If it's off, it won't be convincing. If you add too much motion, it will look too feminine. If you don't add enough motion, it won't look realistic or convincing. But there are some common rules whatever the weight or whether your character is a male or a female. The hips will rapidly tilt as soon as the leg is supporting the weight. So basically, one frame after the contact pose, you will have a drastic change in your curve shape. And as soon as you get over the passing pose, it will slightly rotate the other way. A bit like the side to side motion we add with the center of gravity. So this is what I'm working on, onto the curve right now. I'm getting a fast change in the motion over a couple of frame before transitioning into a slight plateau. So I'm done with the first half of the cycle. I will remove all the keys after frame 16. I will then select all the keys from frame 0 to 16 and duplicate them and offset them between frame 16 and 32. My 2D cursor is already aligned with the zero value. I can switch the pivot point to 2D cursor and then scale the keys from 16 to 32 by minus 1 onto the Y axis. Then I will duplicate frame 0 onto frame 32, and I will clean my curve. This way I have a perfectly mirror motion of the hips. Then you can scale this curve on the Y axis to whether increase or decrease the tilting motion. Don't forget this is something we will be able to edit later on as we also work on the twisting of the hips. So I'm considering this as a decent polish of the Y curve and I will jump on the Z curve. As a switch to the Z quaternion rotation curve of my hips, we must admit that this is quite a surprise that the curve already looks pretty cool. I think I've nailed the twisting motion of the hips during the blocking stage. Since I don't really know what to do, I've doubled check the reference. If we have a closer look, we can see that the hips twist has a slight delay compared to the foot contact. As the character on the left reach its contact pose, we can see the hips twisting forward for a couple of frames. So what I will do is simply offset the whole curve for a couple of frame and insert a keyframe on frame 32 and then set it to 3 and duplicate it on frame 0. I will then get rid of the keyframe on frame 34, and I will call the Z quaternion rotation polishing done. The X rotation is super subtle. I will just push the key on frame 8 a little downward, back foot is pushing, it pushes a bit the hips forward and then it goes the other way. The X rotation motion is super subtle. Just duplicate this revised frame 8, and I will call the X rotation curve done. We can now jump onto the chest controller and work on its rotation. I will start by working on both Y and Z quaternion rotation at the same time. The Y rotation will drive the tilt while the Z will drive the twist. My goal is to build a bit of contrast on the motion and slightly delay the motion of the chest compared to what we have done during the blocking. It's about one frame or half the frame. Meaning that will push up a bit the key where the curve is starting to get down like on frame 8. And I will push a bit down the keys where the curve is starting to raise like on frame 24. Have a look to both polished curve, we can see that they are pretty smooth, meaning that they are going from one extreme to the other in a smooth fashion, without big changes in their shape. But we still recognize our usual pattern when we try to bring contrast between two extremes, with a slight plateau between those two extreme, and then the value of the curve changing a little faster during the passing or during the transitions. The fact that we get this plateau make the shoulder easing into the extreme as if there was some kind of momentum during the swinging of the shoulders. And the result is pretty close to what we have blocked. Just trying to get linear curve with a bit more contrast. Swing a bit with the timing, whenever the shoulder should raise or twist forward. Just double check the reference frame by frame, and you should find the right timing. Then regarding the shape of the curve, been following all the lessons so far, you should be a little more comfortable with editing those curve and those S shape with a slight plateau will be read as for the Z quaternion rotation and hold forward and backward during the twisting, and for the Y quaternion rotation and hold upward or downward during those extremes. Once I was done with the Z and Y quaternion rotation, I switched to the X quaternion rotation to be super subtle, because if you go extreme on this, your character will look drunk or unbalanced. And we will input more up and down using the Z location of this controller. In the end, I'm just taking the whole curve and offsetting it by two frame. But the character bend a bit forward just after the impact. And as it's pushing, then it will start bending backward after the up pose. And the bend backward will be pushed as it fall down as his body is getting lower and lower. So, there is not that much editing on that curve but just offsetting it in time on the X axis by two or three frame. Then I will duplicate frame 32, set it to 3, move it on frame 0 and then get rid of any keys that goes beyond the frame 0 and the frame 32. Explain before, one extra detail I'd like to add is the up and down motion of the chest controller. It is currently driven by the Z location curve of the chest controller. The curve is currently flat because I haven't posed any location during the blocking stage. The idea is to animate the Z location curve based on the motion of the torso root. So I'm tracking the motion path of the torso root to double check whenever it's accelerating down, but you don't really need to do it. By simply going frame by frame, you will feel the moment the body's accelerating down, and the moment the body is accelerating up. The idea is to create an overlapping motion of the chest whenever the body hits its lower pose, we will then, one frame later, or two frame later, push the chest down. We will hold a bit this pose for a couple of frame as the body is raising. And then just after the up pose, when the body is falling down, we will raise the chest. As the chest is dragging, it's falling, but with a bit of delay. I've mainly work the curve between frame 14 and frame 22, because this is the time where we have a big change in the cock position. And this is your to work on this segment and then duplicate the keys around frame 0 and 32 then working the transition from frame 32 to 0. In the end, this bouncing motion will occur twice during our walk cycle. So once I've polished the one between frame 14 and frame 22, I can duplicate my keys so that it repeats 16 frame later. It's a very subtle bounce but it brings a bit of texture to our motion. While we need to bring a bit of motion in the neck and head, we will keep it as subtle as possible unless you want to build a goofy walk cycle that could fit a drunk guy or even the babies that has a lot of trouble to hold his head in position. You don't want to move the head and the neck too much during your walk cycle or your character will look like a chicken. So for the neck, I will only work on the X quaternion rotation. When the character is moving up, clean a bit forward to make the head dragging. And when the body will be falling forward, the neck will move backward. And I will apply the same principle for the head. Right now I'm just making sure that my cycle is repeating over my whole curve. Though each time I find a spot where I feel like my animation is right, I can duplicate the keys and move them by 16 frame. This way I'm sure I get a consistent cycle that look right. Then I will do exactly the same thing, but this time with the head controller. Just track the tip of the nose or the chin of your character as a point of reference. And again, keep this motion as subtle as possible. You may not see it, just feel it, like the head is a bit wobbling but very subtly so that we feel like the character is in control. If you feel comfortable enough, you can add a bit of Z quaternion rotation to create a bit of side to side delay in the rotation of the head but it has to be super subtle. Even more subtle than this X rotation curve. So in the end, if you don't animate the other channel, that's perfectly fine. The torso polishing done. I'd like to add extra bit of details and to add a bit of bouncing on the pectoral muscle of the character. If you display the torso tweak layer of bones, you will find a controller for pectoral muscle. The idea is that we will be only animating one of them on its Z location, and then we will copy and paste its curve onto the other one. I will only animate direction of the pectoral muscle on the impact. If it was a female character, there will be a lot of motion, whether up and down, side to side, because women breast is mainly made of fat. In the case of our character, I only want to create motion whenever we are reaching the impact frame. So as the torso travels fast down before the contact frame, I will slightly raise the Z curve to push the pectoral muscle up, hold for a couple of frame, and then I will push it down super fast. We create a slight S curves that goes up and down with a smaller and smaller amplitude will create a slight bouncing effect that is losing strength over time. I was happy with this first bounce, as usual, I've duplicated all the keys and moved them back by 16 frame. From there, I can copy the curve, select the other controller, then double-click its Z location channel, get rid of all the key but the first and the last, and just press Control + V to paste the motion. Now both pectoral muscle move with the same bounce. If you want to push a bit your walk cycle, you can apply the same effect on the butt of the character. But I will call the torso polishing done, and now we need to polish the shoulders and the arms.

## 06-08-Walk Polishing the Arms

[Instructor] We are slowly but surely getting close to the end of this chapter, as we just need to polish the arm of our character. It's gonna be very easy because we will deal with the arms as a simple, overlapping motion, animating the shoulders in reaction to the torso the arms in reaction to the shoulders, and the forearm, hands and fingers in reaction of their parents in the chain. To polish the shoulder, I prefer to hide the arms. They bring a lot of motion to the screen, and that could be distracting. As usual, for most of our forward kinematic controllers, I will start with the rotation. The X rotation channel drives the rotation that goes up and down on the shoulders, while the Z rotation drive the forward and backward motion of the shoulder. We will then slightly adjust to Y rotation curve, but without that much amplitude, because if you remember in the rotation video, I explained that if we go too far with this third axis, we may encounter gimble lock. Here, I'm starting with the X rotation curve that drives the up and down motion of the shoulder. Editing this curve will be pretty straight forward, as we are animating the shoulders in reaction to the torso motion. Whenever the torso is raising, I will lower the shoulder, and whenever the torso is falling, I will raise the shoulder, and we need to bring extra contrast on the extremes. (mumbles) polishing the chest for the open-and-down motion, we generally mirror or repeat the cycle over 16 frames, as the chest is aligned with the center of gravity, whether we were stepping with the left foot or right foot, we had the same up-and-down behavior, but in the case of the shoulder, there will be a difference whenever we are hitting with the right foot or the left foot, since the chest is leaning left or right in those cases. This is why I'm polishing the whole X curve, not only the frame from zero to 16. Goal is to add a bit of overlapping motion to have a relaxed shoulder behavior. We'll add extra bounce using the Z location curve a little later on. The Z rotation curve on the shoulder (indistinct) drive the forward-to-backward motion is way easier to understand. It looks like curve that we have already edited before. The fast transition motion, before we ease, whether in the forward position or the backward position. Boom, there is a slight plateau to hold the pose. (indistincT) bell-shaped curve will give you a very smooth motion, while a more stepped curve will you give you more contrast in motion. My preference goes generally toward a more contrasting motion, which is more interesting. The curve is just about the twisting of the shoulder, which on a human being, is super subtle. Bend is like a few degrees. In this regard, I'm mainly smoothing the curve so that this wide rotation curve doesn't show that much on the animation and we don't get any popping issues. While I would like to add extra motion to the shoulder, using its Z location to bring a bit of up-and-down bounce, I've decided to mirror the motion onto the other shoulder right away. The idea is just to check if the current polishing of the shoulder is satisfying before I bring extra details. I've done this a lot of time. You can complete the curve from one shoulder, then go on to the other. Press control shift to V to paste them with the mirror option, and then duplicate them on the whole length by 32 frame and offset them back by minus 16 frame. As explained before, I want to bring a bit of extra motion with the shoulder bounce. This might not be a good idea on a very slim character, but since our character is pretty muscular, it will bring extra weight to the shoulders and they will look very relaxed. So I have isolated the Z location curve by IDing all the other ones. Try to focus on the chest motion. As the chest go down, we will make the shoulder drag up. There is a lot of compression, or impact, on the chest on frame four. So I'm hitting the lowest position for the shoulder two frames later on frame six. Then the character hit its highest point around frame 10. So again, I'm pulling the shoulder up at its highest point around the frame 12, two frames later. There is no impact on the up pose. This is why I have a hold on the pose, or a slight plateau. The shoulder hits its extreme high pose around the frame 12, and then it drags as the body is going down. So it's keeping its up pose a bit while the lowest (indistinct) changing the curve on frame six and 22, mark the impact after the contacting frame. Again, our curve doesn't perfectly repeat along 16 frame, since the torso is leaning left or right during those 32 frames. So as the torso is leaning to the right of the character, I'm (indistinct) the up pose of the left shoulder. I feel like I've reached a satisfying motion for the shoulder. I've run a strength test. So basically, I will increase or decrease the scale of the current curve and see how it looks. It will increase or decrease the up-and-down motion of the shoulder and make it more or less noticeable. To do so, we will need to use the 2D cursor as a pivot point. So I will first position it properly by going into the view tab and setting its Y value to zero. Then in the pivot point selection, I will select the 2D cursor as being the pivot point. With all the control points selected, I can press S to scale and Y to constrain the scaling along the Y axis of the curve. Increasing the Y scale will increase the amplitude of the motion and make it more noticeable. Decreasing it will make it more subtle. What I advise you is to scale the curve while playing the animation. This way, you can have a real-time feedback, that generally feels better than modifying the curve and then playing the motion. Once I'm happy with the result, I will mirror the curve onto the other shoulder. Don't forget to check your motion from every angle. For the up-and-down motion, we can clearly see it from the back view of the character. It's great to make this up-and-down motion noticeable; don't overdo it, though. In the next video, we are going to polish the arm for arms and hands.

## 06-09-Walk Polishing the Arms 02

[Instructor] This video, we are going to finish our walk cycle animation, polishing the arms. If you want to track your arcs on the arm, I suggest you track the tweaker controller of the elbow. Then we can select our arm controller and we can isolate the rotation channels. For the whole chain down to the fingers, we will only be playing with rotation channels from now on. The most influential channel for the rotation of the arm in our swinging motion is the z quaternion rotation. Again, polishing this curve is gonna be pretty straightforward. It is mostly about cleaning the curve than really reworking the animation or the motion of the arm. From view, I will press Alt + B and frame half of my character so that I won't be distracted by the right arm in the back when walking from the side view. The idea is to make sure that we hold a bit the arm forward and backward when it reaches its extreme. While the arms were leading the animation during the run cycle, in the case of a walk cycle, especially this relaxed walk cycle, the arm are swinging in reaction to the fall. So they will be delayed compared to the motion of the foot. Just make sure that your arms hit their extreme a bit after the contact post. In our case, we have our contact pose on frame zero and the extreme is on frame two. Once you get a decent result using the z-quaternion curve, you should switch to the y-quaternion curve. My case, it add almost the same behavior as the z-quaternion curve and its motion was added upon the z-quaternion curve. Polishing this curve allows us to refine the swing motion, especially on the easing toward both extreme. That animation is not a linear workflow. Based on your blocking, you may not have the same result as what I have on screen. This is why it can be hard sometime to follow an animation course where you may not have exactly the same behavior curve wise. So your goal is not to focus on the curve but on the motion itself. In my case, when I reached the extreme, especially when the arm was swinging back, it feels like it was hitting a wall. It was reaching its extreme back and then kind of bouncing forward. Polishing the y-curve did fix the problem. This rotation curve allows us to move the elbow away from the chest of our character. So basically, when the elbow is passing by the chest, you would move it away and when it's in the back of the chest or forward in both extreme, we will move it a bit inward. With the arm polished, we can jump onto the forearm. As advised before, if you want to track your arcs on the forearm, I advise you to track the arcs of the wrist controller. The cool thing about the forearm is that generally speaking, it can only rotate around one axis. So we will only have to polish one curve, the z rotation curve. That might not be the case for a very stylized animation where you want to break the limbs or stuff like that to create stylized motion. Basically, we want the hand to drag compared to the elbow. So as the arm is swinging forward, I will bend the forearm a big backward. We will reach the extreme as the arm is almost passing on frame number eight. As the elbow hits its forward position, the hand will catch up and the elbow will bend the other way. The forearm will reach the other extreme on frame 21 as the arm starts to swing backward. It's pretty easy to polish this curve and you should have something quite similar to mine. It might be offset in time, depending on the timing of your walk cycle and also depending on the amount of rotation you are inputting, the amount of dragging you're inputting to. The more the hand is dragging, the more the forearm will look loose and the more your walk cycle will feel relaxed. From there, we can jump into polishing the hand. It's gonna be exactly the same process but this time on multiple axis. Polishing the hand rotation won't be a difficult task. I'm first trying to figure out which channel does what and I will start by polishing the z channel. Orientate the hand forward or backward. So from our side view, this is the first most influential channel. The goal is to make the hand rotate with a bit of delay compared to the forearm. One major mistake you should avoid is to bend the hand too much backward. Try it yourself and rotate your own hand along this axis. You will see that when it comes to rotating the hand backward, you are pretty limited in the range of rotation you can reach. And it's even worth the other way. So don't overdo this backward and forward rotation. Regarding the x-quaternion rotation, the inward and outward rotation or orientation of the hand, the motion range is not really a problem. From the front view, whenever the arm is swinging outward, I make sure to make the hand drag a bit by rotating it inward and as the arm swing inward, I make sure to rotate the hand a bit backward toward the outside. Note that I have a bit of clipping on my model. During the passing pose, the sum is crossing the psi and cut the mesh. So I will have to slightly open the arms during the passing pose by pushing the x curve. So while the motion may feel good, I need to fix a bit this kind of problem. So I will increase the x rotation amplitude of the arms so that it move a bit more away from the thigh and I will also slightly offset my x curve for the hand so that I also move the hand away from the side. Don't forget to check your animation from every angle. So animate from the side view, front view and back view and often turn around your character. You should also check your animation in perspective mode. Not only in autographic mode. After that, I worked a bit on the y-rotation curve, which makes the hand twist. There is not much twisting in this walk animation but still, it's important to polish it so that we have a smooth movement. I've also worked on the W-quaternion rotation curve. The idea is not that it will influence that much the pose of our character or the motion of the hand but I just want to make sure that it flows perfectly and that it blends from one cycle to the other. So the idea is mostly to clean the curve than to improve the current motion or modify it. I often don't work on the w-quaternion rotation, especially for such subtle motion but especially on cycles, it can sometime input some glitches if you don't have a good flow between your very first and very last keys. As soon as I add the satisfying hand motion, so basically our whole arm moving in space, I decided to mirror the motion onto the other arm to have a better overview of our current walk cycle. I won't show you again how to copy and paste mirrored a curve or several curves onto the other side of your character since we've been doing this several time already. And both the arms in action makes the walk cycle looks really cool. The final touch will be to work a bit on the palm deformation and the fingers. We can input a bit more details into our motion by slightly animating the palm and the fingers. Regarding the palm, I will only be playing with the z rotation, compressing a bit the bones and simply inputting a bit of delay in the rotation of this pastor palm controller. So I'm only using the z Euler rotation. Whenever the hand is swinging forward, I will slightly open the palm. Whenever the hand is swinging backward, I will slightly close the palm. Then I will just make sure that my curve cycle properly and I'm done. To add on with the palm bone can be interesting to add a bit of rotation in the fingers and in the thumb. Again, it's just about making the thumb and the fingers drag a bit. So whenever the hand is moving forward, I make the fingers rotate backward and vice versa. The only thing you have to check and figure out is on which axis your fingers can rotate. And the best way to do it is just to check your own hand. Your thumb can rotate along every axis but the y-axis, you can't really twist your thumb. You can easily curl your finger but when it comes to twisting, it's almost impossible and they have a very small range of side-to-side motion, so you can input a bit of side-to-side motion into your finger as a dragging motion but it has to be every subtle. I will favorize the hand close/open motion of the fingers. Since there is not that much to explain about animating the fingers for this walk cycle, I will let you with a bit of music to finish this little time lapse and have our whole walk cycle done. See you in the next chapter where we will learn how to create appealing and convincing poses. (tranquil music)

## 07-01 Chapter introduction

Welcome to Chapter Seven, where we are going to learn how to create good poses for our character. I will try to teach you all the fundamental rules to build poses from a reference. We will talk about the most common mistakes we do whenever we're posing a character and how to avoid them. I will also try to explain you how to study your references. What do you have to look for in first place? And we will talk about the little details that can improve your pose and some tips to help you pose faster. Once we are comfortable with basic posing, we will see how we can improve our pose by pushing them so that they better communicate the will of our character and its personality. So open Blender and let's get started.

## 07-02 Line of action and exageration

[Instructor] There are a couple of animation principle we haven't talked about yet. Line of action and exaggeration. The cool thing about both those principle is that they both apply to animation but also drawing as they define the quality of a pose not the quality of the motion. But since motion and good animation is about a sequence of poses then it does relate also to animation. So let's first have a look to what a line of action is into a pose. In the words of Preston Blair, former veteran animator at the Walt Disney studio and also Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, "The line of action is an imaginary line "extending through the main action of the figure." Basically it's a line or a curve that does support the silhouette of your character and give direction to its motion or to its current pose. It's here to guide the eyes and build to the whole dynamism of a pose. Whether it's dynamic or not. The shape of your line of action may turn your pose in something more static. So it's not about drawing dynamism, it's about drawing directionality to make the pose clearer. Let's see a couple of example. Line of action is about simplifying how a silhouette or a character reads. On the character it often starts from a contracting point or a pushing point to the opposite extremity. Because the line of action is not always but often driven by the force applied into a pose. So good line of action will translate momentum or directionality to your motion. So whenever you are building a pose for your character, the whole pose should support the line of action. All the line of action should support the whole pose. In this case I've posed the back but also the tip of the finger of the end of my character to support the line of action. Same thing here. The way the character is posed make the line of action super obvious. So the line of action helps to read the pose and helps to read the motion. If we see the evolution of the line of action through those poses, we can see it extending as our character is jumping. There absolutely no doubt about the orientation of the jump so it simplified the readability of the lecture of this jumping moment or action. The line of action is not necessarily a straight line or a simple curve. It can have an S shape clearly translating the fact that our character is gathering energy to extend on the next pose. So beyond simplifying the readability, the line of action will also define the flow of your animation. So the line of action is the best friend of the animator because it will help you to see and simplify the poses of your character through time. So when you build your animation and when you build your poses, you need to first think of the line of action. And then while posing make sure that your pose is currently supporting this line of action. So it's always about going back and forth between what drives the pose and what the pose defines. Let's now about a bit one of the 12 principles of animation, which is exaggeration. For me, this is one of the most important principle of animation especially regarding my own style of animation, which tend to be pretty cartoonish or stylized let's say. And this whole chapter will be about exaggeration in a way. I have very few interests to super realistic animation where there is no exaggeration. Though exaggerating in animation doesn't mean it won't look realistic. Great animator will clean motion capture the data and know the spots where they can push the pose or exaggerate the animation to make it more appealing and better sell the animation or the idea. Exaggeration is not about building extreme poses but better sell an idea. Here I've just built a pose where a character is punching. I've used the reference and tried to match it. So I'm not here to tell you if this pose is good or not but I feel like it does work and sell that the character is punching. But now what if I take this pose and I push it or I exaggerate it. Don't worry, I will explain the whole process in the next videos and we are going to build a bunch of different poses. What we need to understand here is that I'm taking the same idea, my character is throwing a punch and I'm exaggerating it, meaning that I will push the pose further both in its directionality but also in the intention of the character. No longer punching his target but he's trying to punch through his target. If we now compare both poses we have similarities. On both poses our character is punching and while the line of action on the first character is clear by pushing the line of action forward toward the punch we are making the idea that our character is punching way more obvious. We are exaggerating it. While it may makes the pose a little less realistic in this case it makes it way more appealing and way more readable. A good test is to show those two poses to a child. He will certainly point out the right pose as its favorite one because it better shows the intention of the character. The big disclaimer here, no children were harmed or involved in the recording of this course. While exaggeration can be used to communicate intention it can be also used to communicate emotions. Whether it's joy, anger or in this case some kind of shininess and sadness by pushing the character pose and calling him more I am closing the line of action. The head is leaning more. The fingers also looked more tortured. So in the end the emotion on the right pose are more convincing and our character will look more alive. Finally we can also use exaggeration to improve the readability of the motion. When the character is jumping I'm pulling his body or elongating it though I'm exaggerating his shape to make the jump read better. Especially at full speed. So we can use exaggeration to build what we call smears that in a way simulate the motion blur of a camera. And allow us to better feel the motion. To summarize we have seen that the line of action can be applied to animation, drawing or even photography. The line of action simplifies the readability of the pose. It conveys the directionality, momentum and or stability of the pose. It helps to read the flow of the animation. The animator should use the line of action to build his poses and use his poses to clearly define the line of action. Exaggeration improves the appeal and dynamism. It better communicates the ideas and the character feelings and it can improve fast action readability. (silence)

## 07-03-Rules of good posing

Since animation is a sequence of poses. Creating good poses is a must have skill. So let's study the different features that make a oppose a good pose. In the previous video, we have seen the line of action. So clearly it's super important that your line of action are clearly defined on all your poses. It will help to read your poses. It will help to read the flow of your animation. So this is definitely the first thing you have to look after when building your pose. Senior, or the evolution of the line of action clearly communicates the flow of the motion and the emotion. Second thing you have to look for, is balance. Characters that look off balance will look weird even to a non-animator. You as an animator should know how to fix enough balance pose or enough balance character or a static pose. A good technique is to draw a box around the main feature of the body. The ones that wait the more. Since the main goal of balance is to fight gravity, draw a straight vertical line in the middle of this box. This line should basically come across your center of gravity. If you don't have at least one contact point or better two or three contact point under this line, your character will look off balance. In the case of three contact point or more, the center of gravity, just has to be bind to the triangle shape formed by those contact points. When you have only two points of contact with the ground, the center of gravity should come across the line drawn by those two contact points. Finally, when you have only one contact point with the ground, your center of gravity must be vertically aligned with this contact point. Note that your center of gravity is not always centered around your hips. You have to take in account the weight of your legs, of your arms whenever you're trying to balance yourself by spreading your arms on the side or whatever piece of equipment you are wearing. The next important thing whenever you are building a strong pose is silhouette. It's the main feature that's gonna be identifiable on your character pose. While the inner shapes of your character might need other to notice or to identify like the head of the character on this pose. Reading inner shapes will greatly depend on the quality of the character design and its contrast. A good practice is to have a dedicated window in blender with a 3D view set to flat shading. If you're animating to camera, these should be the camera view. This way you will always have a sneak peek to the silhouette of your character. Now that we know how to display our silhouette, what makes a good silhouette? The most important thing is readability. The trident is currently a good example, showing the three teeth or three points of the tridents, make it clear on the silhouette view. While if I rotate it by a few degrees and show its profile, it doesn't read well anymore. We no longer identify a trident, but simple spear. If we scrub through the animation, most of the poses are clear on this one, the legs, the arms and the sword are clearly identifiable. The same will apply to this pose where we can clearly see that the character is handling this weapon with two hands or even this pose where through camera, I slightly offset the position of the sword so that it appear in the back of the character. While I did the mistake on the specific pose to not have a clear silhouette. And I received this as a critique a lot of time. And that's a bummer because this is one of the strongest moment in the animation. This could have been improved by slightly rotating the whole character so that we can see more of a profile of the character distinguishing both feet and a bit of the arms. Another principle that will help you build a solid silhouette is simplicity versus complexity. If we have a look to those different poses, we can clearly see that one side of the character has almost a straight line or a smooth curve. While the opposite side of the character is generally more detailed. This will improve the appeal of your poses. It will also improve their readability by giving them an orientation or at least giving them contrast. We did talk a lot about contrast in our motion whenever we have an odd and a fast transition That's the same regarding posing, simplicity versus complexity brings contrast. And so it brings more interest into the pose. Another important point regarding silhouette is negative space. Negative spaces are the holes in the silhouette of the character. When you have overlapping features like the arm crossing the body of the character in this case, make sure that you use those negative space to show the different features that will help the viewer to identify the different parts of the character. Like the same here of the silhouette of the biceps that allow us to clearly identify the hand or the arm of the character. You should also try to avoid tangent on your character or on your silhouette. On this specific pose, the leg get tangent with the end of the spear and why it's not the end of the world that could be improved if the character was moved a bit to one side or the other so that we have no tangent between the leg and the spear and we can clearly identify both features. There is another pose that look decent, but that will read better and it will be more appealing if we were to separate a bit the silhouette of the legs and break the tangent in the arms by showing the wrist or an elbow, for example. Avoid twinning in your poses. Twinning occurs whenever you have two features of the body, like the hands or the feet that have exactly the same pose. While it can be something you voluntarily create to bring strengths to a pose or to bring control into a pose like on the beginning of this jump, where everything about the body of our character is symmetrical. This is something you should live out. For example on this pose, both feet have a slight different of pose. If I make them having the same pose, it won't look as appealing as the previous one. Twinning will bring a lot of stability and so it will kind of break the momentum or the contrast in the pose. Twinning can also occur in timing. For example here, my character is catching both sword at the same time, and this is a personal choice because I want to show that he's perfectly knowing what he's doing and mastering his art. So twinning both in timing and in the pose can show strength and stability. But in the case of this jump for example, if I was to make both feet arrive at the same time, that will make the animation a bit less appealing and interesting. In the end twinning bring a sense of perfection. And whenever you're achieving art, what you want to avoid is perfection. There is a lot of randomness in life, and she's what we want to represent. We want to make it alive, not to make something perfect, something CG. Another thing you should avoid are perpendicular lines. If I take these pose that is decent and I now make the arm perpendicular to the spear by straightening the elbow, making this pure vertical, that will look super stiff. And if I even exaggerate despite straightening the whole torso, the neck, the head, or even the other arm that will look really bad. And my last advice, try not to hide any part of your character. There will be many times where it's gonna be impossible, but when you have the choice like on this pose, make sure that we see a bit of the fingers. Don't hide them into the silhouette. Or on this other pose, the pose looks great. But if I twist a little more the hand, I won't be seeing the thumb anymore. So the end will be harder to identify. That's a little detail, but it will make the difference. So whenever you are pausing your character, make sure you hit all the notes in this video. Watch full line of action that we have explained in the previous video. Watch for balance, make sure that your character is not falling, especially if he's turning. Be very aware of the importance of the silhouette. Watch for readability of the silhouette. Watch for simplicity versus complexity in your silhouette. Use negative space, avoid the tangent. Break twinning by angling a bit your character. Break perpendicular lines, avoid hiding part of your character. In the next video, we will start building our first poses.

## 07-04-First pose

[Pierrick] In this video, we are going to learn our first pose and I will teach you some tips about good posing workflow. You will find in the documentation a link to my Pinterest collection. It includes a lot of different poses from sports, martial arts, that you can use to repeat this exercise. The more you will do, the better you will get. It's perfectly fine to use drawing references whenever you are creating your poses or searching for references for your animation. But for this exercise, I advise you to use a photo because if you are using drawing references or illustration, there is big chance that the artist has already pushed the pose, like on this one, for example. So again, I truly encourage you to watch as much illustration and drawing as possible, even try to reproduce those poses. But for the sake of learning, I think it's better to use photo references. Here is the first pose we are going to work on. you will find the link in the documentation. Here is what we have to look for whenever we start working on a new pose. First of all, the line of action. In this case, it's super obvious. It goes from the right foot to the head. So, we definitely need to define this line of action in our posing. Then I'm looking for secondary shapes. Look at the flow in the arms. It creates a nice S shape with shoulders aligned. Then I'm looking at the leg flow, creating a nice angle with the body. And finally, the torso creates this nice and smooth curve. So, those lines are the one we need to identify and clearly define in our posing. Third thing I like to do on my references is try to define the orientation of the main features of the body, especially the torso. I will quickly draw some lines that defines the orientation of the torso and its main shape, as if I was sketching the current pose. The simple thing of doing this is writing in my brain what I will have to look for. So, whenever you are using a reference, just draw some line on top of it, trying to identify the shoulder orientation, the eye orientation and the torso orientation. Let's get started and prepare our file. I'm starting where we left with our run cycle finished and then will search for the keying action in the action editor. I will duplicate this action with our character in a rest pose and rename it 04-post-01. Don't forget to click the shield icon, I've just forgotten to do it. Then on my second 3D view, I will rework the shading and set it to flat, object color, get rid of cavity and shadows so that I get a raw silhouette of my character. I will go back to my main 3D view and in object mode, I will press Shift + A to add a camera. Now, the camera should appear in outliner on the root of the scene collection. With my 3D viewport view aligned with the front of the character I will press Control + Alt + zero on the numpad to set this as being the camera view. I really clean the camera transform channels so that there is no offset on the X-axis location and no rotation but on the X-axis. I will hover over my second 3D view and press zero to switch to camera view. And then instead of the outliner, I will open the image editor and load the reference. You will find it in the files, or you can download it from Pinterest or download any other reference if you want to work on another reference. Now what I'm doing is positioning the camera. I'm having a look to the reference and it seems that the person taking the picture is slightly higher than the character, as we can see the top of the shoulders and the top of the head of the character. So from a side view, I will slightly raise the camera to 1.4 meters. I will push it to the character and reduce a bit the focal length to 40 millimeters to get a wider angle. We will revise the camera a bit later on if needed. The last thing I will do is go back to my rig, press Control + Tab to switch to pose mode, I will go to the rig properties panel, search for HEAD-FOLLOW and NECK-FOLLOW, set the NECK-FOLLOW to one and the HEAD-FOLLOW to zero. That's a personal preference. But they feel like my characters generally have a better behavior with the neck following the chest and the head being free of any rotation hierarchy. For me, the most important controllers whenever you are posting a character that is on the ground are the torso controller and the feet. And the torso controller or center of gravity controller is the main and most important controller, whatever the pose you are doing. So the first thing you have to do is pose the torso controller. I'm lowering it and I'm rotating it to the side on its local Z-axis by pressing R and Z twice, so that I can manipulate the controller in its local space since by default my pivot point is set to global. Then the most important controllers are the feet controllers. I am using inverse kinematic as usual, and I'm manipulating those controllers on the Y and X-axis so that they stick to the ground. Before even watching the whole shapes of the leg, I'm watching the orientation of the feet. One of the big benefit of 3D animation is that we can focus on each feature of the character one by one. So I first make sure that my feet are properly oriented and properly matching the reference. Then, as we need to adjust to torso shape, just make sure that you use at 90%, the center of gravity or the torso root controller, and then slightly tweak the chest and hips by rotating them. As I'm still at working on the chest, hips, and torso controller, just look at the knees. I've also posed the pole target so that the right leg knee point a bit inward toward the camera while the left leg knee point a bit on the outside. At the end of the posting, almost every single controller of the character will be posed. As any form of art, there is a lot of back and forth. You need to watch your character from every angle to make sure that it looks good. Since the legs and the torso of my character are more or less posed, I can now rework a bit the camera position. I press Control + Tab to get out of pose mode. And then I can click the outer edges of the camera view to select it. Then from this view, you can press G and Z twice to zoom in and out. Or press R and the axis of your choice to rotate the camera. I've slightly lowered the camera as it was too high and rotated it so that I can nicely frame the character. Here you can see the actual transform values of the camera. From the camera view, I can slightly adjust the center of gravity position and also work a bit on the hips controller. Note that the hips controller will have a lot of impact on your legs shape. Watch for the groin alignment and the chest alignment of the reference. You can see it's leaning a bit forward, so I'm adjusting it accordingly. As for life drawing, watch your reference as often as possible. Don't over-focus on your character and forget that you have to check the reference. Once I feel like I have a good pose, I will check my center of gravity by checking my character from the bottom and checking the feet alignment compared to the center of gravity, or from a side view. And it feels like my character is a bit out of balance. His center of gravity is a bit too far on his back. So I feel like the character will fall on this bottom. To fix this, I simply need to push the center of gravity a bit forward. This is why it's very important to check your pose from every angle, because this is something I wouldn't be able to see through the camera view only. and you won't be sculpting a character without turning around it most of the time. And this is also why sculpting and drawing, while they are not mandatory, will make you a better animator because you will learn to better pose your characters. One thing I've noticed is that I've rotated the neck too much forward. As being a continuity of the spine that goes through the chest, try to keep your neck slightly aligned with the chest for a better flow. And then I can rotate the head to try too match the final pole. I didn't work on the shoulder or the arm on purpose so that we can focus on legs and torso. Don't hesitate to hide the arms to rig the pose. Your brain will do the job of figuring out where the arms should be and you can have a clear view of your current pose. So I can now pose the arm, I will display them again, and I will start with the shoulders. The shoulders are clearly raised on the character, so I would rotate them, and then I would start posing the left arm. When posing the forearm, do remember that your elbow can rotate only on one axis, the local Z-axis. Whenever I need to change the orientation of the arm, I will twist the arm controller, not the forearm controller. And then I pose my character following the chain of hierarchy. First the shoulder, then the arm, and finally the forearm. Then I will work on the other arm. And when I've run the reference analysis, I've tried to figure where the elbow was beneath those clothes so that they can then select the arm controller and twist it accordingly so that the elbow is pointing down. Then as usual, I will go down the chain and pose the hand so that it's slightly open towards the sky. From there, I can turn around my character and spot that the arm is not aligned with the shoulder, and it generates a weird angle that doesn't look good and that is not anatomically correct. If you hold your shoulder and try to rotate your arm backward with your elbow pointing down, you won't be able to reach this angle. So I will fix a bit the pose, and now look at the flow between the two arms. But most of the time you want your arms to flow in a nice curve. You may think of your arms building a second line of action in a way. We are almost done. Now I'm just double checking the different features. You can see that my head orientation doesn't match the reference. So rotating a bit the neck and the head, I can adjust it. It's also a good idea to pose a bit the eyes. Just check both controller on top of the eyebrows. By simply moving them, you will be able to set pre-made shapes for the eyebrows that will all you to reach appealing pose pretty quickly. As I'm almost done with the pose, I'm double checking the different features. Slightly repositioning the foot and reorienting them. And I will just put another problem regarding the relationship between the left shoulder and the left arm. This angle here is impossible to reach between the shoulder and the arm. Basically, with your shoulder at rest you can't have your elbow getting upper than the shoulder. As soon as you want to rotate the arm beyond the T pose, the rotation is done by the shoulder, creating a nice straight line between the shoulder and the arm. So this is really something you have to remember. Don't forget that the arm rotation has a lot of limitation and you need to compensate with the shorter. That's a beginner mistake I see a lot. So I can fix this issue and now pose the hands. One of the most important controller regarding the hand is the palm controller. This is this little controller on the side of the hand. When rotating it, it will curl the hand with a nice fall off between the different pan bones. First beginner mistake to absolutely avoid, hands are never flat, unless you are pushing on a wall. So please always input a bit of rotation in this palm controller. As for the elbow and the arms, the fingers have limitation in their rotation. Remember that your finger root can tilt a bit or rotate side to side. They can curl, but they can't really twist. When it comes to next joint into your fingers, which are manipulated using the second controller here, they should only be able to curl. So while everything is possible in animation, try to match those anatomical constraints whenever you are posing your character. Then while moving, we may need to bend the limbs of our character in a weird way, just to follow the flow of the animation. But currently, just try to respect anatomical constraints. Now regarding the finger pose, look at how they are grouped. The index and the middle finger are linked together, while the ring finger is slightly getting away, and the pinky is the one that is the most on the outside and opening the hand. Finally, don't hesitate to change the location of the controller too. You can move them by grabbing them if you feel like the rig is breaking or you can't reach the pose you are currently looking at. There is no rule of thumb (chuckles) whenever you are opposing the hands. Also, you see, while I'm pushing you to follow the constraint of the body whenever you're opposing your character, what's matter is the shape. So if you can't reach the correct shape for the fingers using an anatomically correct behavior with the controllers, just cheat and move them a bit. Even if those controllers are called bones, they don't behave like a real life skeleton. Plus you have to take into account the flesh, the muscle, the fat on top of the body that will currently shape your character. So just move them as you want so that you can reach the nice pose. While I do advise you to follow anatomical constraint, if you can't reach the pose you want, just cheat a bit. So my advice is to always follow an anatomical constraint, especially if the rig is built on them. Which is more or less the case with this rigging. But the most important thing is the result, this is what your customer, the viewer, will see. So if you need, cheat with the rig to get to the right result. An example here, I'm using this ankle tweaker just to break a bit the odd angle I have on the ankle that doesn't look right. This is not anatomically correct, that will be pretty painful, but in the end it looks a bit better. So some with small adjustment, we can call this posing done. In the next video, we are going to see how we can push this pose to make it even more appealing.

## 07-05-Pushing the pose

Now that we have our base pose, it's time for us to push this pose to make it more dynamic and appealing. We have learned before the fundamentals by identifying the line of action and studying the basics of creating a nice silhouette. Now it's time to apply those fundamental and exaggerate them. The first thing I'm going to do is duplicate our current key frames onto frame two. This way we can compare both poses by hitting the up and down arrows. The first thing we can do is to push the directionality of the line of action. While on our basic pose our line affection create a nice curve, I will straighten the line of action to give it more directionality. The first thing to do is to lower the center of gravity of our character and push it to the side on the supporting leg. Then we need to increase the contrast between the right leg and the left leg, meaning that I will try to make the right leg as straight as possible. First, with the different controller in this case I will slightly move the pole target and I will also use the tweaker controller to align the knee with the ankle and the hips. Then I will slightly open the stance of our character, pushing the left foot a bit backwards so that it's not out of balance and indirectly, contrasting the open stance of our character. As usual, this is not a linear work, so I may make the character leaning forward too much, then leaning backward, then trying different poses that looks more dynamical. In the end, I've chosen to rotate the center of gravity more forward so that that it reduces a bit the profile of the torso and makes it more aligned with the line of action. Then we need to tweak the position of the hips, of the torso, of the head also, tilting it a bit forward, more into the pose. And then we can start shaping the arms. As for the line of action, where I have a smooth curve. I've decided to increase the tension in the arms, making the right arm straight and supporting the line with the left arm by opening it a bit. But I was really hesitating and still hesitating to pose it more into an angled way. I think this pose works too and is also very strong. I've straightened what was straight and I've created another angle where it was angled. But they feel like there is more readability in the hand of my initial pose, so we will stick to it. So I will raise the shoulders, I will open the hand, I will slightly rotate it toward the sky and make sure that the palm is more open too, more to the side. To keep the directionality, when we open the forearm, we need to raise the arm and raise the shoulder. I will do the same with the left arm, I will make sure that it's in the continuity of the current line of action and I will slightly open the hand so that we can clearly see the fingers on the silhouette of the character which wasn't the case previously. While it might not look super natural, I like to curl the fingers forwards. It brings a lot of tension as if our character was pushing the air. During the whole process, I will repeat the same steps again and again. Because it's very odd to push a controller to its maximum without comparing it to the other one. Because the pose is to be read as a whole, it's a relationship between the legs, the torso, the arms, etc. So whenever you're pushing the torso, then you are rebalancing your character by moving the feet and it changes the pose. But then maybe you want to push this pose even further. What I'm trying to explain here is that you may need to repeat the process several time before you hit the right pose or you hit the most extreme pose or exaggerated pose that still feels right. As explained before in the previous videos, we are sculpting the pose. And when you are sculpting, you don't sculpt the details of one hand or of the face without looking at the whole body of your character. You generally already start looking and then you refine each part one by one and you refine them depending on the other one. You refine the proportion of the head based on the chest or the proportion of the legs based on the arm, etc. And don't fool yourself, animation as an art form is really comparable to drawing or sculpting. Because we are shaping our whole character, working on the relationship between the shoulder, the arms, the forearms, the hands, the chest, the hips, etc. So if you have fundamentals into sculpting or drawing, make sure you also apply them whenever you are posing your character for animation. And if you don't have any fundamentals in sculpting of drawing, don't be afraid to study drawing and sculpting techniques. I'm not meaning that you need to draw every day or sculpt every day, but at least read some book about figure drawing because you will see that a lot of the vocabulary we are using in this course, or a lot of the fundamentals we are using in this course are applied in drawing and sculpting also. So let's jump into the next video and work on more poses.

## 07-06-Motion pose

[Instructor] The first pose we've been working on was a static pose or a balanced pose. In this new video I like to tackle motion poses and we will try to push it to an extreme using smears and rebel limbs. So the first thing you need to do and I truly advise you to do it whatever your animation level is to identify the line of action on the pose. Even if it seems very obvious on this picture, drawing this line will help you whenever you are going to build your pose because it will be written in your subconscious. I know it is I'm the first to rush into posing my character whenever I'm starting a new animation and this is not the right way to do it. But what I'm sure is that whenever I do this work prior to start posing my character, I generally get a better result. Second thing I do is to define the lines of interests. In this case, we have a nice angle with the right leg, the left arm, and the overall shape made by the connection between the two arms and the baseball bat. Then as in the previous video, I will define the orientation of the face, the torso, and the hips of the character by drawing lines on top of the character. Again, this will really improve my posing process helping me reading the current pose and the orientation of the different features of the body. So I will open my previous file, I will duplicate the current action and I will rename it, pose number two, I will get rid of all the key frame on frame number two, and then I will go on frame zero, enter pose mode, select all my controllers and press Alt+R, Alt+G, Alt+S to reset the rotation scale and location of all the controllers. From there in the 2D editor, I will open the new reference picture. Since this new picture is not framed as the other, we need to rework our camera, the current camera as an horizontal format while the new one needs to be into a vertical format. To change the format ratio of the camera we need to go into our output properties, scroll up till you reach the dimension tab and replace the resolution X by 1080 and Y by 1920. From there, I will make sure that I'm in object mode and I will click on the outer edge of the camera frame, this will select the camera and I can roughly reposition it using our two rotating G to move. Since the reference picture has probably been taken from afar, I will increase the focal length to 60, I guess a focal length of but for the time being we will stick to these. While our character has no baseball bat, he's equipped with some weapons. We can go towards the visibility properties and enable the two ended sword or long sword. We can continue these as these are some bad-ass baseball bat and we now need to enable it's rig layer. By default these two ended sword is parented to the right hand, meaning that it will follow any motion or movement of the right hand. If we head over the weapons properties tab, we can change the parenting of the sword or of any of the weapons of the character. Changing the parent will whether parent it to the right hand, left hand, or give it no parent so that we can move it freely inward space where we can definitely pose our character using forward kinematics for the arms. Whenever we are manipulating an object, we've both and in contact with it, it's easier to have at least one or both end set to inverse kinematic. So in the arm properties panel, I will set the arm fkik.l and .r to one so that we switch to arm inverse kinematic controllers. From there, we can enable the arm inverse kinematic controllers layer and hide the arm forward kinematically. From there we can pose the arm of our character by simply selecting the end controller and moving it and adjust the elbow orientation using the pole target exactly as we did with the feet. There are a lot of animators that prefer to use inverse kinematic all the way from their arms. I personally prefer forward kinematic to build nice arcs, but whenever I have contacting pose with the hands on the wall, on the ground, or on an object like that, I generally switch to inverse kinematic. The first thing I will do is press control tab to jump back into object mode and I will select the camera and hide it, this way I can start working in front orthographical view without having the camera object in the middle of the screen. As usual, I can always start posing my character with the center of gravity or torso root controller. As we have looped to the reference picture, our goal is to figure out where the torso is pointing at. Once I get a very basic ID of my torso pose we can pose the feet, they are very important since they are supporting the weight of our character, they will define its balance and the orientation of the hips. When posing the feet, if you have to rotate them forward or backward, I advise you to favorize the foot roll controller, it has a pretty natural behavior regarding the posing of the character and when animating it it's easier than rotating the feet and compensating any contact. Don't forget to pose the toes of the character. And before you focus on the whole leg, just focus on the feet orientation of the reference. For the time being I'm just roughly posing each controller as seen in the previous video you can hardly get to the right pose or the right position of each controller in one shot, you need to refine the pose of each controller by going back and forth on each of them one by one. With the feet controllers and the leg I can pose, roughly post, I can go ahead and work a bit more onto the torso of the character. I need to twist the torso even more, twist a bit the chest controller, make it lean to the side, basically push the pose a little more. Then I'm watching the head orientation of the reference picture and I'm trying too match, rotating the neck controller will offset the head and then I can change the orientation on the head using the head controller. As usual the shoulder are very important because they will shape the chest and the overall silhouette of the character, but they will also change the behavior of the arms especially when using inverse kinematic. But before I even try to refine the shoulders I will position the hands of the character. You watch carefully the reference, the right hand palm is pointing up while the left hand home is pointing down. So I need to rotate the right hand accordingly, then I will position it in front of the character and roughly both in space. Once I have a rough pose for the right hand, I will pose the left hand and position it on the handle of the sword. Here you can see we have a lot of tension into our arm, and this is because we haven't posed the shoulder yet. We need to rotate the shoulder inward to loosen the arm and get a nice angle with the elbow. Watch out for this nice and smooth C-shape boat by the shoulder line. Whenever you are posing the elbow, double check their position in space, be aware whenever you are posing, don't try to guess, just watch the reference. The left elbow is pointing to the sky making a nice angle with the shoulder while the right elbow is pushed toward the chest of the character. A common mistake you need to absolutely avoid is trying to reach any weapon pose using only the hand controller, your hand have a pretty limited range of rotation. So you can't break the wrist to orientate the plate, but whenever you are manipulating and object in your hand, the way you move your finger you open your palm or not will change the orientation of the object. So please move the object using the object controller. Getting back on to our pose we can see that both end are very close one to the other, so I fix that and now I'm rotating the shoulder so that I can reach the same range of motion or range of pose as on the reference. When I pose the hand, again I try not to break the wrist too much and if I need to compensate the rotation of the sword I will do it using the sword controller. Now that I have a roughly posed both hand and I want to move both of them or change the orientation of the sword at hands, I'm using the active controller as the rotation point or pivot points. This way I can select both hand controller, make sure that I select last or make active the right hand controller, this way both end rotating around the right hand pivot point. And since we are using inverse kinematic, both end get posed pretty natural, and I can do the same process by selecting both hands and then selecting the torso controller for example. As I'm turning around my pose to make sure it works from every angle, I will first select both end and finally the torso controller. And now whenever I move or rotate the torso controller, the ends follow, good practice is to test the different pivot points so that you get familiar with them and can switch whenever you think it's more relevant to pose faster or with ease. So as seen for the previous pose, don't forget to turn around your character and make sure that the pose works from any angle. Now that I have a better pose or at least a base pose, I will go back to object mode and they will unhide the camera by pressing Alt+H. With the camera selected, I will go back onto the camera properties and I will set the focal length to 90 and now we have a way better focal length that better match the current reference picture. With the focal length corrected I will jump back into pose mode, select both end and finally select the torso root controller and I will tweak the pose of my character to better match or try to better match the reference pose. When you're watching your reference, take one feature like the elbow and try to clearly identify its orientation. My left elbow is currently pointing up while on the reference it's pointing down, so I will simply fix that by rotating a bit the shoulder controller and lowering the pole targets, then I will control the other elbow and make sure that it doesn't clip too much inside my character. Another good practice whenever you are watching the reference is to draw straight lines, to see the position for example, of the head compared to the foot or the left elbow compared to the left foot, I can see that I need to push my left foot a little on the outside. So there are a lot of moment where you won't be able to perfectly match the reference because the range of posing of your character depend on his proportions. Our current character is more elongated than the female character on the reference for example, so his arms are a little longer and I have a lot of time trying to perfectly match the position of his harm compared to the female character. So your goal is trying to match but not trying to match at all costs, at some point you need to figure out whether the pose you have, but please you are not. Again, animation is enough form, so I can't teach you the perfect way to pose your character or tell you this is or this kind of pose must be bad. You are here to learn all to bad a good pose, not this specific pose. And then you need to bring your style to the pose, again I'm comparing the reference pose with my character trying to find the right balance or at least the right momentum. Here we don't need to get our character perfectly balanced since he's in motion, so its center of gravity is moving in space. I could tweak this pose forever, but for the time being we are going to rapidly pose the finger around the handle of the weapon. So I will pose each finger one by one trying to match a convincing pose, but this is not the main focus of this video, so I will just let you with a time-lapse where I'm posing those fingers. Don't forget that you can also find tweaking the position of the feet and the position of the toes, but we will work on and posing in a dedicating the video, for the time being I'll see you in the next one where we will push the current pose. (upbeat music)

## 07-07-Smears

[Instructor] In the beginning of this chapter, we've been talking about exaggeration and line of action. Exaggeration can be used to amplify feeling. If you want to communicate anger, just make your character mad, for example. But we have also seen that we can use exaggeration to give whether more impact or more freely to the motion. Look at all, the Trident here is completely bent, helping to read the arc of motion. Next frame, all the limbs are reshaped to exaggerate this pinning motion of the character or on this landing pose. The character is stretched toward the ground clearly supporting the line of action and the directionality of the jump. And if you did your homework, this should remind you, this should remind you something, right there. Whenever we are stretching the ball, we create some kind of smear and we are exaggerating its motion and the same occur whenever we are squashing the ball on the ground. It's another exaggeration that better sell the impact. So how can we apply those principles to our character? When we are first in the light the reference pose output the different line of action of the pose using the red and orange line. So now what if we push those lines? What if we exaggerate them? The goal is to build our shape or silhouette based on the motion of the character as if he was pulled by the inertia of the movement. As our line of faction is curving, just push the curve. And as our character is twisting, just support the twists, creating a rotation motion within the hum and the sword. We can also build a strong smear upon the sword to simulate motion blur. To do it, let's go back into pose mode. I will duplicate the initial pose and I will start by pushing the center of gravity of our character to the right, in the direction of the motion or in the direction of the force is applying to strike the ball or maybe cut is opponent in half to be able to shape the silhouette of our character at will we will need to enable the tweaker bones. All the yellow controllers, I'll use to reshape each part of the arms, the legs, torso, or even the whip. So as we need in the previous video, I'm slightly pushing the pose. And then I will start using those tweaker controllers, starting with the left leg. My goal will be to shape the whole left side of my character as a single curve. Note that I will mainly build the shape to camera. It's all down to create smears that can read from all the angles and focusing on the camera point of view will alow you to push the pose even further. The bigger knee tweaker controller allows you to push the knee with the thigh and shin following. While the smallest one will allow you to shape each joint of this thigh and the shin. So, as we did so far, just repeat the process several time. Push should be the pose. Shape the arm and the leg into a curvy shape. And whenever you reach a satisfying shape, just try to push it by repeating the process. As you get more experience, you will be able to reach your extreme or exaggeration faster. Another important thing is not to over-focus on one part of the character, and this is why you should often add a loop to the silhouette of short character. The first step to give a better shape to the sword is to first bend it. To do so, you can use the sword master rotational controller available on the root of the blade by pressing R and D twice, I can rotate it along its local Z axis. Then you can use each individual controllers to whether tweak the rotation or location or to scale them. Here, I'm currently scaling them along their local X axis. Starting from the tip of the sword And then going up until the root of the sword. Look, all, we already improve the character's silhouette. And we do feel like the sword is currently swinging. From this point, my goal would only be to push the pose. So I need to accentuate the curvature of the body on the left side so that I have better continuity between the left leg and the torso. This will support the line of action of our character. I will also slightly tweak the shape of the blade, so that it is smoother. I just need to re walk a bit the X local scale of the different tweaker bones to avoid those jacket profiles. So don't forget to test each controller. I've also used the tweaker bone within the torso to give it a more curved shape. Progressively push the pose, and don't be afraid to fail. If you can't nail a good pose at once that's perfectly fine. While I do believe I ended up with a satisfying pose, I am convinced it can be improved a lot and a more experienced animator will probably get a better pose than mine faster. As any other art form becoming good at animation is just a matter of practicing. And someone practicing every day for four hours will be better than someone practicing once a week for one hour, while it may sound abused, this is something I'd like to remind you, And I will probably remind you often during this whole course. And if you lack of confidence, just stop telling yourself that you lack of talent. I personally don't believe in talent and whenever you meet any artist that is very good as it's art and you make the effort to dig a bit into his career. You understand that they don't land there because they were talented, but just because they were working a lot. So I will let you there. Don't hesitate to experiment with the body shape, stretch the EDD to give it speed. Just try to affirm. And don't forget that it's okay to fail. So if this pose doesn't look right to you just restart from scratch. (relaxing music)

## 07-08-Hand posing

[Instructor] In this video, we are going to talk about one of my favorite part on any character. Hands are super important and too often overlooked. And you can often identify a big inner work just by watching the hand posing. The first main issue is to keep the rest pose of most rigs. Most of the time for technical purpose, most character rigs have flat hand whenever they are in rest pose. And to get such a flat hand pose, you need tension, meaning that you need to straighten your fingers so that you're not relaxed. So the first thing I would suggest you to do whenever you are posing your character, but whatever the rig you are using, is to slightly curve the end using the palm controller, and then to slightly bend the tip of the finger. Here, you can see a reference picture of a relaxed hand and there is no flat shape. Another thing that is very interesting is finger grouping. Most of the time, fingers tend to group themself by two or by three. The current pose is the one I use the most with the index and the pinky being separated, and the middle finger and the ring finger being grouped. If you watch some of my animation, you can see that I use it a lot. Whenever I'm posing hand, this is my go to shape, but you can group the middle, ring, and pinky together or you can not leave the pinky alone, but you should avoid creating two groups, one with the index and the middle finger, the other with the ring finger and the pinky. While it may fit for a ninja turtle, this is not a very natural hand pose. Whenever you are building a fist pose, don't just rotate the root of the fingers, and then curve them inward. If you do so, you will end up with a very squared fist. We have flat surface on top of the hand on the front of the hand, and on the inward. This will look very low poly like or old game fashioned. While if you look to a closed fist reference, you can see that there is a lot of curvaturing. So a good practice whenever you're posing a fist is to do the same thing as when you're posing a rest hand. First of all, think of using the palm controller to slightly bend or curve the whole fist. Then watch your own fist. Watch the relationship between each finger and the overall shape. Don't hesitate to play with the location of the bone. It's very odd to get a convincing fist with all the compression by using only the rotation. Again, remember that we are currently sculpting the pose, shaping our character. This is not about getting logical, about all the bones should behave in the body of our character. We are not manipulating bones, we are manipulating controllers. So again, watch reference, use your own fist, and try to match it. Here is the result whenever I'm using my own fist. Note that the fist position might vary a lot from people to people and that you will meet limitation due to the current rig. I personally believe that hands are so expressive that they can be considered as being a separated character within the character. When you are posing a hand, just act it. Why we have been focusing on motion, line affection, and all this kind of thing, this course is about animation. So bringing your character to life. And I do believe that even in an action pose or an action animation, hands can communicate a lot about your character, about his personality. So whenever you are walking on hands, treat yourself as a child and play with them. Just remember whatever you were doing whenever you were mimicking a monster when you were a child. Hand poses are written into our subconscious because it's a strong point of attraction on a character. They can be very feminine for example or they can show anger or the envy of an evil character. So whatever the tension, the shape you build with the hands, they will communicate something. Finally, whenever you are posing your hand, you have to think about the limitation. While we can break those boundaries whenever we are playing with exaggeration, it's always better to build your poses on the current limitation of the body. Remember that the side to side motion of the wrist is pretty limited, just a few degrees of rotation. Again, use your own hand to test it. If you hold your arms straight forward, you can almost twist your hand by 180 degrees with your palm pointing to the sky. While if you twist your hand inward, you will hardly get over 90 degrees. Regarding the back and forth tilting of the hand, you should be able to reach a 90 degrees angle whether you are bending your hand inward or outward. So whenever you are building those pose, try them yourself. If it's become painful, then you have to compensate whether with the shoulder or the elbow. Fingers also have their limitation. While the thumb is pretty flexible, you will reach a limitation whenever you're trying to spread it as far as possible til it creates an L shape with the index finger. The index and the pinky can process free rotation with a lot of limitation. So you can rotate a bit with them to create a circular shape, but they are mainly able to curl. The middle finger and the ring finger are more limited. Finally, when it comes to the next joint on your finger, they can only curve and rotating them along any other access will look very weird. Again, it doesn't mean you can't rotate them this way. And I do it a lot whenever I'm building smears, but if you hold a pose this way, the finger will look broken. Finally, depending on the people, the finger might be more or less flexible and you can totally bend them backward a bit, especially if they are applying any pressure. This will mark the end of this video, but I do advise you to have a look to the talk of Hjalti Hjalmarsson at the Blender Conference. It's one of the best talk about hand posing I've ever seen and it's really eye opening. You will find the link in the documentation as usual.

## 07-09 Fighting weight

[Pierrick] There is one art pose I'd like to talk about and work on before we go into more dynamic and spectacular poses. It's weight lifting poses. The weightlifting exercise is a classic Funimation because it's very hard and you learn a lot. We'll do the animation in the chapter I will publish later on. I've called this video of Fighting Weight because there is a lot of forces involved whenever you are trying to lift any weight or even your own body, and we are here to fight gravity. And in a good fight, you need to know your enemy, gravity. So the first thing I will do as usual is to find the line of action. It's not that hard to find, I just have to follow the spine of the character. One interesting detail here is the position of the head. It seems that he's trying to lift the weight with his head, so this is something we will have to translate in our pose. Beyond the line of action, there is a very important point to be identified here, and it's the center of gravity. And as soon as the weight are leaving the ground, we have to consider them as being a part of the center of gravity of the character. And they think we can place the center of gravity in the middle of the weight, as they are way heavier than the character. Now, our character purpose will be to pull the center of gravity in the straight line vertically. And everything in his pose is meant to do this. Look how the arms and the legs create a triangular shape that goes straight up. So we will have to make sure that we have this tension in the arms and the compression in the legs. As usual, I've drawn some guidelines on top of the character to get a better vision of the orientation of the different features of his body. In Blender, I will do as we did in the previous video, I will switch to object mode and hide the camera. Then I will select the weight accessories I have created and I will place it in space. You will find the initial file with the object already placed in space. Since we will be only posing the character, I won't be creating any interaction between our character rig and the current object. We will see those mechanism later in the course. In the meantime, as usual, I can replace one of the 3D view on the top right corner by the image editor and open the reference picture. Then I will prepare on the character rig. I will enter pose mode, and I will make sure that I add the sword. Then in the action editor, I will create a new action. You don't need to do so since I'm providing you the file with the already created action. And before we start posing the character, I will switch the end mechanism to inverse kinematics, since our character will be in contact with the object. Exactly as did when we were working on the baseball pose. This way, we will be able to position the hands on the weight and then work the pose around the hand position. So let's start posing our character. I will try to position the hands properly. But first, I will lower the center of gravity of the character, not of the whole pose, so that the arms don't get stretched. But one important detail on the hand pose here is that they are slightly bending toward the outside. So this is a little detail we will have to take into account whenever we are going to polish a bit our pose. And I will slightly rotate the hand controller toward the outside right away. From there, I can press Control + C and then Control + Shift + V to mirror the pose on the other hand. You may remember that in the previous videos, I've told you that we try to break symmetry into a pose to avoid twinning. But one thing we have seen regarding twinning is that it can communicate stability and strength to a pose. And this is exactly what we need here. So this is a pose where we will be able to use symmetry. As we did for the previous poses, I will first try to give the right orientation to the center of gravity of my character. One key component of this pose is to have the sternum align with the center of the weight. Then I will go back and forth with the bending of the chest controller, the hips controller, the head and the neck. Whenever you're pulling a heavy weight, your shoulders are pulled down, so you need to rotate them toward the ground. Don't make the mistake of raising the shoulders because the character is trying to raise the weight. Don't think about what your character is willing to do, think about what forces are involved against your character and it's fighting against those forces. The feet will be aligned with the metal bars that is holding the weights. Remember what we have seen when we have built our first pose, we try to get the center of gravity to be aligned within the shape made by the contacting point. So if you have only two contacting points, then the center of gravity must be aligned between the two feet. Based on the knee position on the reference picture, as I'm posing the character, I feel like the weights are too high. So, I will go back into object mode, I will select the weight object and moving along the Z-axis. From there, I can rework the hand position, the torso position and the shoulder position. As usual, I will progressively shape my pose by moving each controller one by one. But one of the most important skill you need to develop whenever you opposing your character is observation. Look at the position of the feet, they need to be under the bar. Look at the hips, the butt is slightly bending backward. The sternum has to be aligned with the center of gravity or the middle of the metal bar. The head is pulling the weight up as if it was leading the whole body. So whenever you are building your pose, sometime just stop, watch the feet, watch the hand, watch the shoulder, watch the head, and watch their relationship in space, their position. Observation, whether it's a pose right now or everything in your everyday life, will allow you to catch the very truth in any motion. But most importantly, the behavior or the purpose. Behavior, whether you're working on a humanoid character, a creature, an animal, or even an object, will bring personality to your character and personality will bring life to it. And this is the whole purpose of this course, breathing life into our character. And to build a personality, you first need to get believability. This is why you need to observe and translate what you see into a believable pose. And then you can push it to input personality, to make it more appealing. And if people can connect to something they know or something they feel they know into your character, it will become real to them. And so, you will be breathing life into your character. Back to the posing, don't forget to look at your elbows and the overall arm orientation. And as I feel the left arm is okay, I will just copy and paste the pose on the other pole targets. Then I will go back into object mode and I will set up the camera. So I will give it back a horizontal format by changing the size. On the reference picture, there is almost no perspective. So we can keep a long focal length. And since we can barely see the top part of the feet, it means that the camera is just above the feet level, maybe the middle of the shin level. So, I'm moving and rotating the camera from the camera view. Choosing its local axis, as we have seen in the previous videos. Having this new point of view does help me to see some of the mistakes I've made. I need to raise a bit my character and slightly rotate the hips inward. One of the issue I have with my character is the shape of the butt. Fortunately, if you enable the leg tweaker, you should be able to find some controller that allow you to reshape a bit the butt. So I will lower them a bit and rotate them a bit inward to reshape the back. Another thing I did have some difficulties to get right is the shape of the head and the neck. As my character is the bit skinnier compared to the reference, and don't forget that the rig has also its limitation, I will be able to get a better shape by simply pushing the head inward. I feel like it makes a huge different in the pose. We do feel like the neck is pushed with blood pressure. Finally, I will use some of the tweaker inside the foot to flatten the foot, as if there was a lot of weight on top of them and it flattened them. One interesting thing on the reference, it's the shape of the shoes. It seems that there is something to raise a bit the heel. It's probably to keep balance, avoiding the foot to get absolutely flat and falling backward. Regarding the hand pose, I start with the pinky because he does a very special shape whenever I'm looking at the reference. It feels like it's not totally closed, that the first joint is not rotated that much. Another thing that I'm doing is that I will slightly scale each finger using the first joint and scaling them on their local X-axis. And they will also do this on some of the pan builds. With the weight and the pressure applied upon the hands and the fingers, they are squashed against the metal and it makes them looking larger. So whenever you are posing the hands, while you should favorize rotation, don't forget that you can scale the bone, you can move them also in space. The important thing as usual is what we see. So use the whole range of transformation you have to get where you want to be. Once you're happy with your end pose, select all the bones in the hand and mirror the pose onto the other hand. While posing, I did feel like the weight were a bit too big, so I've scaled them down. From there, I did some minor tweaking on the pose of the character. But I just wanted to straighten a bit the legs since they are a bit angling backward. While I wasn't able to perfectly match the pose, it feels a little better with the legs slightly bent forward. But as a final touch, you can enable the face controller and create a slightly angry face. And I feel like we can call this pose done. It's time to push the pose. And it was a little harder than usual because we generally amplify the line of action. We often elongate the arcs to amplify the motion or the sense of motion. And the first thing I was thinking of was to raise the character. But in the end, what we want to communicate here is weight, the fact that our character is pulled toward the ground. So what I did instead was to compress the line of action. I've shortened the torso, I've made arm as straight as possible using the tweaker bones. And since I wanted my character to be squashed, I've scaled up most of the parts of the character, but only to make them larger, not longer. So I'm inflating the torso. I will do the same with the thigh, with the chest, using the tweaker controllers available upon the whole rig. Increasing the thigh volume better sells the effort, and we feel like the character is going to explode. But I've also slightly inflated the neck. And since I've built a bit of a face pose on the previous pose, I've decided to push it. So I will enable the tweaker bone of the face and I will raise a bit a lower lids and raise a bit the cheeks. This way, the whole body of our character, from the tip of the toes to the eyes, will communicate the fact that he's pulling on this weight as hard as he can. Again, as an animator, you have to communicate something. I've built this rig so that we don't have too many facial stuff that are going to be distracting. But with those Spider-Man's like eyes, that will be a shame if we don't try to shape them. And beyond that, this is another tool to sell the pose we are currently building. From there, since I've slightly moved the weight, I will go back into object mode, select the weight, add a keyframe on its position and reposition it on the previous pose so that I can jump between the two poses and compare them. And I feel like I can call this posing done. While the difference between the two poses are pretty subtle I feel like the new pose better communicates the fact that our character is trying to lift this weight. So I'm pretty happy with the results.

## 07-10-More poses

Before we jump into the next chapter, there is a couple of more poses I'd like to show you. The first one is a katana pose and we are going to use the double-handed sword to do it. The second pose is going to be a flying knee. For those two poses, I will go through the analysis of the reference, and then I will give you some hints on how to improve them. As usual, the first thing you need to do is to identify the line of action in your character. Since the character has been swinging to his left, there is big probabilities that he was pushing with his right leg. We will also be able to identify another line of action going through the left leg. It's interesting to see all those two lines form a triangular shape. So this is something we will have to try to match in our pose. From there as usual, I'm drawing some lines on the character to see the orientation of the face, the orientation of the torso, check the hips position and outline some of the interesting shapes. Going to use anatomical part as point of reference, like the clavicles and the pecs to figure out the chest orientation or the eyes to figure out the head orientation. For this pose, I advise you to switch to inverse kinematics for the arm controllers, powering the weapon to the left hand. From there, offset, a bit, the weapon so that there is enough room for the right hand on the handle. Then, as usual, try to first match the right position for the torso root. In this case, it is slightly twisted toward the left arm of the character. It is slightly leaning forward and it is tilting toward the right arm of the character. Once your torso root is roughly posed, you should pose the feet. First, check out the orientation of the feet, and then double check that your center of gravity is currently aligned with those feet, so that your character is balanced. Finally, carefully watch the knees orientation and don't forget to use the pole targets to rectify the leg's shape. You will be able to see the whole posing process in a slow-paced time-lapse in the next video. When posing the arms, double check the position of the elbows and the position of the hands. Watch for the angles made by the elbows and carefully watch for hands orientation. Then, use the shoulder controller to reach those poses. When working on the hands, don't forget to use the pan bone controller and try to draw a nice curling shape of the finger. Make sure that your hand doesn't look like a box. Finally, don't forget that you can use the sword controller to tweak the sword orientation and position. To push this pose, you have to increase its directionality. Since the center of gravity is pushed to the right, I will just push it even more. And as the character is slightly leaning to the left, I will make him lean even more. And since there is quite a lot of spine twisting engaged into this pose, I will make the body twist even more. The final touch was to fix some issues regarding the initial pose. On the initial pose, the sword doesn't tread well because it's overlapping with the body. So while my first concern was to make the character look more dynamic, I've also made sure that the sword better reads on the pushed pose. For this new pose, as usual, I'm looking for the line of action, and since the character just jumped, it's pretty easy to find it. While the line of action is currently supporting the motion of the character, remember that we are here to translate the motivation of the character. And his purpose is currently to hit his opponent as hard as possible with his knee. So when we are going to push this pose, instead of focusing on the line of action, I will focus on the directionality of the knee and make sure that the whole pose of the character supports this idea. Once I was able to match the reference pose, I've pushed the pose of my character so that we do feel the directionality of the knee. And it's to make your whole character becoming a hero pointing at the target. I've shortened the angle of the left knee so that it looks more pointy, but I rotated the torso backward so that it's more aligned with the directionality of the knee. And finally, I make sure that both arms are supporting the current pose and don't forget to support the pose, even in the finger. Make sure that the hands read well and make the fingers track toward their previous position in the movement. But you should also pose the toes of the character. Double check the orientation of the feet. Basically check each part of your character, rotate around the pose and make sure that each features of the body are supporting the current pose and make sure that the current pose does translate or communicate the will of the character. This is the mindset you need to have whenever you are creating a pose, whether it's an action pose like this one or an acting pose. If your character is feeling fear, for example, how should his hand be posed to translate the fear? What kind of shape should his body make? How do I pose the shoulder, how do I pose the head? What kind of shape do I do with the eyes? So again, whenever you are building the pose, ask yourself what it communicates and if it does it well. And if each part of the character currently communicates the same idea. Use reference to get a good quality of pose and a good believability, push the pose to better communicate the idea and connect with your audience, whether it's for gameplay animation or film animation. This is the end of this video. The next video will be the time-lapses of the two different poses we've just studied. And I will see you in the next chapter.

## 08-01 Intro

[Instructor] Welcome to chapter eight. In this chapter, we will apply everything we have learned so far to create this 4 Hit Combo animation. I will give you my best advice to find good references whenever you're starting this animation process. And I will also teach you some tricks on how to use those reference to plan your animation. Then as we did in the previous chapter, we'll go into the analysis of the different poses we are going to build. From there, I will guide you through the whole process of creating this kind of animation from the base blocking, breakdown to creation, and first pass of timing, blocking plus adding even more poses so that our animation is perfectly readable in steady mode to polishing our animation and take it to the next level. But this is a big chapter and you should expect 10 to 20 hours of animation to get to this result. So stay strong, don't be afraid to fail and let's get started. (bag punching)

## 08-02 References

[Instructor] If you've watched the previous chapter, it's no surprise for you that the first thing we need to do is search for references. This video, I will show you what I'm looking for in my references and how I use them to plan my animation. I'm convinced that we are in the golden era of learning, or there is a bunch of stupid things on the internet, and you can waste your whole life watching funny cats and stuff like that. Nowadays, you can find tutorials for almost everything in life. You won't necessarily get good references from tutorials, but you can learn a lot about the purpose of a stance, the purpose of a footwork, how the body's supposed to be moved to land an accurate switch kick, for example. Watching this kind of video would bring your attention to small details, whether they are cultural or technical. And those little details will bring believability and authenticity to your animation. So it's always a good move to mix your references with watching tutorials. And you should not limit you references to real life videos. You can use drawings, you can use video games, you can use movies. One of the most important thing is that you enjoy the reference you've taken because whatever is appealing to you in this video, it will stimulate you to put them into your own animation. Finally, when it comes to real life references, try to find the references from the master on their art. Since I want to do a Muay Thai combo, I'm watching for references featuring the masters at this art, like Saenchai, Jacquot, Liam Harrison, or Jonathan Haggerty. Then you need to plan your own animation. If you are working in the movie industry, you will probably have a storyboard or an animatic. If you're working for games, you will probably have a list of moves provided by the game designers. And if you are working for yourself, then you can choose whatever kind of move you want to do. But I advise you to do a minimum of planning ahead and then edit your references accordingly. In my case, I want to do a left jab, a cross, followed by a powerful hook, and then going into a switch kick. It's a pretty common combo in kickboxing and Muay Thai and, animation wise, it's interesting because the first two punches are straight, then the second draw a nice curve, and the last move draw an even bigger curve. So we will have a nice contrast in shapes. I've gathered multiple references from different people doing the same move. And then using a video editing software, you can use a Blender, for example, I make sure I'm syncing all the videos together. And I use the extreme to do it. In this case, the different hits of the punches and the kick. Finally, don't hesitate to rework the timing of your references until you get a nice rhythm. You can slow some parts, accelerate other, or just cut in. No, listen to the hits on the reference. (men yell) Now, what I will do is that I will cut the sound and only keep the impact. (punches thwap) (men yell) And it goes like, pum-pum, pum, pum. So while I was looking for contrast in the motion of the reference, there is also contrast in the rhythm. And if at some point you have some linear reason into your reference, use video editing to get to a mock contrasted rhythm. And the best way to do it is to do it with your mouth. Make the sound and the rhythm with your mouth, tum, tum, tum, tum, and change it to ta-tum, tum, tum. Once you find a good rhythm, just edit your references and go to the next step. With my reference exported, the first thing I do is that I load it into SimSketch or Keyframe Pro. From there, I will scrub through the video. And I need to identify the golden poses or the extreme. I'm looking at the poses where the character are the most impactful. So it's generally the moment where they hit the bag or just one frame after, as the punch goes a bit through the bag. For those first punches, this is the moment where the body is fully in extension. And I will then do the same with the hook and the kick. Then I will try to spot the contrasting poses. In this case, the anticipation for the hook and the anticipation for the kicks. Once I spot them, we can analyze those poses. So, as we did in the previous chapter, the first thing I'm looking at are the line of action. On the idle stance, the weight is generally on the rear foot so that they can block incoming kicks with the front leg or the front shin. Which means the line of action will generally go through the punching fist and the real leg that is pushing. On the hook, the energy generally come from the front leg and the hips. And finally, on the kick, it's quite easier to identify by just watching the silhouette of the character. One goes from the pushing foot and the other on the swinging leg. From there, I will be looking at the secondary shape exactly as we did during the previous chapter. They generally help to define the silhouette of the character once we have defined the line of action. From there, I will go more into detail and I will try to define the orientation of the chest using the shoulder line, the orientation of the hips, and the orientation of the head using the eyes. I'm also drawing lines on the tip of the feet so is that I can remember that I need to double check the orientation of the feet. It's super important. It's super important to pay extra attention to the feet because they will directly influence the hips' orientation. And we need an extra attention for this specific animation because footwork in combat sport is super important, as it delivers power and balance and so it will bring believability to your animation. So once you've done this for your golden poses, you will have to do it for the breakdowns, et cetera. So now that know my reference workflow, let's jump into the next video where we will start blocking our animation, using the key poses we have defined here.

## 08-03 File setup

[Instructor] It's time to prepare our Blender file. First, let's get rid of everything by pressing A to select all the object and X to delete them. From there, we need to link our first rig. So while you go to File, Link, go into the folder of chapter eight and select the, "Punching Bag" file. Choose the, "Collection" folder and here you will find only one collection. Just double click it. Click the arrow next to the orange collection to unfold it and right click on the sub-collection, go to ID data, and choose make library override hierarchy. Now both the punching bag object and armature are available. In the viewport changing option, I will enable textures. Now I will select the armature and press control tab to enter, "Poles Mode." The main rotation controller will allow you to swing the punching bag. The blue controllers are a forward kinematic chain. You are free to rotate, scale or move them. The yellow controller on the tree curve bone. They are perfect to create the impact frames. There is also a controller to move the chains, but I don't think we are going to move this one. Finally, you will find a root controller to move the whole rig in space. We need to link our character so we can go to file link. I will go in the folder of chapter five and click the, "Trident Rig" final file. From there going to collection and choose, "Trident Character Collection", no click the arrow next to, "Trident Character Collection" and right cheek on the sub collection, go to ID data and choose, "Make library override hierarchy." We now need to load our rig script to do so. Open the text editor instead of the timeline. Then in the middle of the top bar of the detail. Click the folder to open the punching bag rig UI. Once the script is open, go to text and click the register option. From there, you can press the play button in the top bar of the text editor. This will enable the UI of the punching bag, which is very busy with a few layers. From there. Repeat the process and go to folder number five and search for the Trident rig script. Again, go to text register and then press the play button. From there. Let's open the action detail where we will be able to access the king set of our different rigs. I will start with the character. I will switch from dope sheet to action editor, and I will simply duplicate decaying action, but I will rename the action combo blocking on there in the field of view, I will press control tab to get back into, "Object Mode," select the rig off our punching bag and do the same process. Duplicate the current action and rename it, "Combo blocking back." Then I will go back onto the Trident rig and in the rig properties, I will disable the visibility of all the weapons. Then I will hide the controllers of the weapons. And in the head and neck properties I will make sure that the, "Head follow," is disabled and the, "Neck follow," is enabled. This animation we are going to use arm forward kinematic with the, "Arm follow," disabled on both arms. From there let's position, the heavy bag or punching bag. I will switch to object mode, select it and press control tab to switch to, "Post Mode." Let's select the root bone and set it's Z position to 0.2 meters and Y position to minus 1.5 meters. (swoosh) Now I like to change the model preview, so I will go to the viewport shading option, switch to flat and enable cavity and shadows. I think it offers a better readability of the models. A little tip here, select a both armature in object mode, then press control tab, and you will be in pause mode on both amateur at the same time. This way, no need to jump back and forth into object mode to be able to select one or the other armature. As soon as you are selecting one or the other armature, the, "Action editor" will update. As for our previous exercises, I will open a new window on the right side of the screen and create a new 3D view to preview our poses from another angle. One last thing I'd like to add before we get started is a ground object. This will help us to define the contact pose of the feet. So I will press control tab to go back into, "Object Mode." Press shift A and add the plane. I will scale it up and press control A to apply all the transformations. From there, I will create a new material for this ground object that I will call, "The Ground." I will give it a dark gray color, and I will reduce the specularity to 0.1. This way we won't have any visual noise. Whenever we are previewing our render with fancy reflections and stuff like that. From there, I will add up to the viewport display option and set it to a dark gray color so that it's not too distract-ive and not too aggressive to the eyes. I will rename this flat object ground and I will move it in the scene collection in the, "Filter Menu," I will enable the selection restriction and they will make the ground unselectable so that we won't be selecting it by accident. Now, the final tip to be able to pose our character from the bottom view is to head up to the shading option and enable, "Back face culling," This way, whenever we are facing the back face of the plane, it becomes transparent. From there, you can reorganize your collection, get treated of any useless collection so that we just have our character collection, heavy bag collection and our ground object. And we can get started.

## 08-04 Blocking

[Teacher] In this video, we will start to blocking our animation using the extreme poses. We have a spot and define on the reference. As we did when we were animating the squirrel character, I will create those key poses every five frames. So for the time being, we don't care about timing at all. And to make sure that I have no sliding controllers, I will insert the key frame on all controllers for both the character and the punching bag. Since our character will be doing a lot of footwork, and that generally the knees align with the foot in the rig properties, I will make sure that the leg parent is set to one. Meaning that the pole target is now following the foot. And as we rotate the feet, the knee will follow. So let's now build our first pose; the idle pose. The right leg or back leg is open to the outside, meaning that the foot is rotated to the right. The weight of the character is supporting mostly by this leg. So I'm pushing the center of gravity backward and onto the right leg. If we watch the reference and look at the line affection, we can see that the whole body is slightly leaning forward, creating a nice C curve forward from the supporting foot to the head. Generally the front leg or left leg is not supporting that much weight. and the character is supposed to be on the tip of his toes. You will often see muay Thai fighter making slight bounce with the front leg. It's a way to input rhythm into the fight and they keep their front leg ready to block any kick using their left shin. When posing the arms, don't forget that you can't rotate your elbow in any other axis then the Z-axis and that the arm bone can't rotate upward than the line made by the shoulders. So it's super important to currently pose the shoulders. I see too many beginners not playing with the shoulder controller while they are very important and critically influence the silhouette of your character. Now ask yourself, why on the reference, the character have the shoulders so high? We are not here to only answers mechanical properties of the body, but also the purpose of the pose. Again, as explained in the previous chapter, if you give a clear goal to the current pose, it will communicate the will of the character. And as soon as you do that, you're giving life to your character. In muay Thai and in boxing in general, shoulder are raised a lot to protect the head of the character, especially the chin, because a shot in the chin can knock you out instantly. If you were to animate some beginner in boxing, maybe you should drop the shoulders so that you communicate a big mistake boxing wise. Here I want my character to show mastery in the art of boxing. So I will try to mimic the reference pose and even push it more; pushing the head deep into the shoulders. As usual, the step between a good pose and a great pose is pretty long and it's about a lot of tweaking. But why it might be more natural to have open hands whenever you're not wearing gloves? Especially in muay Thai, where you can catch your opponent and go into the clinch, I've decided to close the left hand because both my hand were posed a bit the same way, and I had some twinning in the post and it didn't look that interesting. So I will close the fist and I will slide the scale, the palm fingers on the local X axis to make them slightly larger as if the fist was a bit squashed by the pressure of the closing hand. Don't forget that you can refer back to the video about posing the hands. Don't forget to pose the neck and the head, but don't over-rotate those controllers. And as a final touch, you can use the face controller to shape a bit the eyes. Now our character is ready to kick some ass. So don't forget to rotate a lot around your character to check if the center of gravity is properly aligned and your character, balanced. And don't forget to check the overall silhouette of the character of from different angles. Again, remember that you can refer to the previous chapter to double-check the method to get a good pose. Before you start posing the jab pose, double check the video reference. You can see that both feet are moving forward during this punch. Beyond rotating the feet, don't forget to change their rotation while posing the jab. So the first thing I will do is to move the feet forward. Now, as we watch carefully the reference, we can see that the weight is shifting onto the front feet and the whole chest is twisting to the right. And so does the feet. So, since we have weight on the front foot, I will flatten it a bit, and then I will raise the back foot using the heel controller. And then we would rotate both feet to the right. But when you punch left, your feet turns to the right. When you punch with the right, your feet turn to the left. But I haven't pushed this pose too much because the next punch will also be a straight punch forward. And if we go too much forward and too much into a horizontal pose for this initial punch, we will lose the contrast with the next one. And so our pose may look good, but the animation won't because it will lack of contrast between the first pose and the second pose. Another thing I'm doing though, is that I'm slightly spreading the arms of the character. While it might not be a super good idea whenever you are boxing, because you are exposing your chin, this improve a bit, the readability of the pose and it slightly extend the overall silhouette of the character when we follow the shoulders. Finally, don't forget that you also have to pose the punching bag. Don't push it too far and don't use that much controller. Moving all the controllers won't necessarily give you better result. While we do agree that everything is connected so everything should be moving; keep it simple. Your audience will mainly focus on the character. So you want to avoid any glitches on the bag by moving too much controller at the same time. Once done, don't forget to key all your controllers and don't forget to add subtle rotation details to the feet. When we watch the reference, we can see that there is a subtle tilting during the punch. Don't forget to add it during the blocking state.

## 08-04-01 Blocking part 02

Let's go ahead with the next pose, the right cross. While I have chosen not to push the pose too far for their job. For this specific pose, if you compare my current pose to the reference, I've pushed my character way further. While the left jab is settle punch, to get closer to the target and mask the next punch. This right cross is made to destroy the target. So to bury this pose, I'm applying the principle we've learned in the previous chapter. I'm looking for the specific features of this pose, like the foot orientation, the distance between them, the orientation of the torso, and the position of the center of gravity based on the feet position. On the right cross, the center of gravity is shifting towards the left leg. So the front foot get flattened on the ground, while the right foot twist towards the left foot and its heel get traced. The torso is twisting toward the left foot and the shoulders are aligned to create a straight line toward the target. But since we have already identified the marker of this pose I am already pushing the character. I've built a wider stance with the feet. I've lowered the center of gravity and the line of action is pushed forward. It's more oriented toward the impact, but instead of keeping the left elbow against the rib cage I've raised it backward, so that both arms from the profile view creates a straight line. This way even the back arm or left arm is supporting the directionality of the punch. Once I'm done with this, I will slightly twist and tilt the neck toward the right shoulder. I'm exaggerating the previous concept we have seen where the character is protecting his face and his chin using his shoulder. One little detail I like to point out is the way I slightly twist the punching fist so that the thumb is pointing down. This is the way you have to throw a straight punch, whether it's across or a jab to avoid overextension of the elbow that can lead to injuries, but it's also a way to get through the guard of your opponent. But once you're done with your character pose don't forget to also pose the punching back. So I've rotated the main controller so that we can start swinging the bag. And then I'm using the tweaker bone to shape it so that we feel like the fist is getting through it. Don't worry if you have a hard time following everything I'm doing here. I will then provide a slow paced time-lapse showing the whole process so that you can follow along. Here I am trying to give you a guidance to what you have to look for and what is your goal whenever you are creating those different poses. The next pose is the anticipation of the hook. Since the punching bag just received a heavy blow and is no longer in contact with the character, I've decided to pose it first. I'm simply canceling all the transformation, and then I'm gonna rotate it away using the main controller. But one super important tip whenever you are building a new pose with your character, is to cancel the rotation of the chest, the hips, and even the torso root controller. First of all, it pushes you to rethink about the current pose instead of building it based on the previous pose. You will better watch your reference and try to match it, so it will improve your focus, and secondly, it will avoid you to source mistakes from the previous pose. Especially when it comes to hips and chest twisting. Now as usual, I've repositioned the feet first, and then I'm working on the torso. Both the reference and the pushed pose shows that the character has both of his feet flat. The character is gathering energy. So he's twisting toward the left. Since he will twist to right to deliver the hook, his weight and center of gravity is shifted toward the left foot. Both arms are bent, the right arm is bent in front of the character to protect his face, while the left arm is slightly more open and slightly lower, preparing to fire a big punch into the next pose. As usual, I work the shoulder lines and the arms so that I get a nice curve. The arm and the shoulder flow into an elliptic shape. It supports the twisting of the character and it communicates the fact that our character is going to swing the other way. Once you are done, don't hesitate to play the animation even if there is no timing. It's just a good way to see if the flow between the different poses is okay for you. And you will get more familiar with your animation. When jumping into the next pose, again, it's interesting to have a quick look to the video reference. As usual, my goal is to spot if the feet are changing of location, and the right feet is currently moving forward. I will work exactly as I did for the previous pose. I will first work on the foot supporting the weight. Rotating each a bit inward. I will move the center of gravity toward the supporting leg. Move forward the right leg, as we have seen on the video. And then I will cancel the rotation on the hips, on the torso controller, and on the chest, and build the whole torso pose from scratch. I decided to make the hook to the head, because the previous punch is pretty low, this way by changing the level we are hitting, we bring contrast to our animation and so it will be more appealing. From there make sure that you're applying the rules we have seen in the previous chapter. Make sure you properly define the line of action. Make sure that the secondary shape properly communicate the wheel of your character. In the punching pose for example, make sure that the flow of the arms really shows what your character is hitting, how he's hitting, and as for the previous pose, I make sure that the character lower is at between his shoulders to protect his chin, because he's an experienced fighter. A little reminder here, whenever you are posing the shoulder you can rotate them, but I also encourage you to change their location. As for the finger, you will have a hard time reaching the right pose by only using rotation. Avoid over-twisting the chest and hips controller and for the rise using the torso root, the chest and hips can't really twist that much. Doesn't mean they can't, but if you over rotate the hips and rotate the chest the other way, it will look a bit weird, even for our stylized character. Again, don't forget to turn around your pose. We are not animating to camera because I want your poses to work from any angle. This is how you will make the best progress. Later on, we will add the camera so that we can push the appeal of our animation, but for the time being, let's create a nice animation without a specific camera angle. I spend a lot of time on each pose to make sure that everything flows properly, that the character is looking at what he's hitting, that I don't have any broken joint, unless this is a personal choice to push the pose, for example. And finally that my character is balanced. The more time you spend during the blocking stage, the easier will be the position later on. And as for the previous poses, don't forget to pose the punching bag.

## 08-04-02 Blocking part 03

Before I start working on the next pose, the anticipation for the kick, I will pose the bag. Since our character is pretty close to the bag just after the hook, and as you will need a bit of room to execute the anticipation of the switch key, we can rotate the bag farther away as the hook was a very powerful punch. Just make sure that you push the bag away in the right direction. While the jab and the cross were pushing the bag along the y-axis, the hook tend to push it along the x-axis. The second thing I'd like to note is that the left foot is now back on the stance of the character. So it will be able to throw the kick directly. As the benefit of the foot shuffle, is to get the kicking leg back and before you throw the kick. But if our character was to throw the kick from this position, it will be pretty weak because all his weight is supported by the left leg. So can you throw a kick with your left leg if most of your weight is on this leg? When you throw a hook, it's a classic to pivot around your left leg. It's where you can reposition your right leg back and return to what we call the orthodox stance, where the left foot is the leading foot so it's in front, and the right leg is the rear foot and is in the back. With this in mind, we can start working on our anticipation pose for the kick. And that's not a problem if our feet position is not perfect. We will be able to reposition our whole character later on if needed. But as repeated many time, animation is not a linear workflow, and you will need to go back and forth onto your different poses. Now focusing on the pose, as usual, I first moved the feet. And once I have my contact define, I can work on the toes or root orientation. Here, fully have a look the orientation of the feet. Look how the right foot is opened. By opening the right foot to the outside at this way, it's gonna be way easier to rotate the hips, to pull the left leg and kick with full power. Now, I've looked to the twisting of the whole torso. The chest is twisting to the right to its maximum and the left arm and left shoulder are also orientated this way. This allow to load energy before the kick and during the kick release, the arm will swing the opposite way. By swinging left, the arm will input energy into the hips and push them to swing right, and pull the left leg forward. The weight of our character is shifting to the right leg. Right foot is flat while the left foot heel is slightly raised. The whole shape of our character, it's silhouette and line affection, clearly finds that he's going to kick forward and trying to raise his whole body. We now need to work on what I believe will be the strongest pose of our whole animation, the kicking pose. As usual, I've look to the video reference. Look at how the right food rotates during the heat. Also, the right heel is raised. It helps rotating around the right foot, but it also allows to bring more power to the kick because you are both pushing forward by the twist of the whole body and pushing hip with the supporting leg. I've immediately decided to push the pose and kick higher. This will give a better and more dynamical shape to our character. Also, it's a pretty classic move from the Thai. Instead of trying to hit the rib cage, they often kick into the arm so that will drop your guard because of the pain. If you watch more reference of roundhouse kicking, the first mistake to avoid is to think that the leg is kicking upward. Powerful kick should be thrown as horizontal as possible, or even by getting down during the heat pose. So you need to give the proper orientation to the kicking foot. The top of the kicking foot should be whether horizontal or even pointing a little downward, and so should be the knee of your character. Also, we are not kicking with the foot, but we are kicking with the shin because it's way harder. Think of the leg as a saw that need to cut through the bag. Here's another concept that is very important into our kicking pose is that we are not snapping onto the surface of the bag, but we are trying to kick through the bag. So the whole body is leaning into the kick. And so, the leg is not fully extended, giving a bit of additional range to push the bag even further. As usual, don't forget to rotate around your character to make sure that the pose work from every angle, that the line affection is clearly defined, and that you push the pose as much as you can to sell the impact and to communicate, as well as possible, the will of your character. This is also the pose where the bag will be the most deformed, as it was a swinging back towards the character. And we are now applying a very brutal force the opposite way. While I'd like the animation to be at least semi-realistical because this is a better way to learn than going fully stylized directly. That's perfectly fine to exaggerate what's happening with the punching bag. So while the character will be recovering from the kick, I think that will be great to sell power of the kick. That instead of just swinging the punching bag, we throw it away. I will swing it a lot. I will even create a nice curve to it. And then, I will simply move the root controller of the bag. After the kick, we can see that the free fighters are taking a step back, and then transition into their idle pose. First, they pivot back from the kick into the contact pose, with the weight mostly on the right leg. And this is the pose we are going to build. We could consider this as some kind of down pose, if it was a work cycle. The character is pretty relaxed and slowly shifting his weight back onto the left leg, the one that has just kicked. But the weight is still mostly upon the right leg while the right foot has been rotated, it doesn't move. I haven't changed its location. Once I've roughly posed my feet, I will pose the torso. And as I did for most of the previous poses, I will first console any transformation on the chest and hips controller. As usual, take the time to look at the line of action on the reference pose. It's more subtle than usual because it's a slow paced movement, but it is still there. Watch the position of the center of gravity compared to the feet. It's slightly more on top of the right foot. And finally, watch for extra details like the hips and chest orientation, the line of the shoulder, the position of the hands, their orientation. Every detail that will help you to identify the pose and reproduce it at your side. The final pose will be the idle pose, and it's gonna be pretty close to what we have on frame five. But before I pose the character, I'm working on the punching bag. I'm just trying to guess where it would land after the kick. Walking from the front view and scrubbing through the different poses of the bag will help me figure out its orientation when it's flying away. That's not super important if the current pose is not perfect, as we will use later on motion path to better track the position of the bag. Regarding the character pose, I won't dive that much into detail because it a pose that is very similar to the very first pose we have build. The only specific tip you have to check here is that I've only pulled the right leg back because the left leg is not supposed to change location. Because while it's getting back into idle pose, his shifting his whole weight on the left leg to pull the right leg back. And once the right leg will be settled back, the weight will shift onto the right leg. And so the weight is removed from the left foot, so we can slightly raise the heel into the idle pose, with the left leg ready to block any incoming kick. The incoming video will be a slow paced time-lapse of the whole blocking process we've done so far. And in the further video, we are going to continue on blocking our animation.

## 08-05-01 Blocking breakdowns part01

With our golden poses done, it's time to add some breakdowns. The goal of those additional poses is to have a better grasp on the flow of the animation. We will build the first step into the jab, which is the anticipation of the jab. Then the transition into the right cross and the right cross overshoot really help to communicate the power into dispatch. Then we will add a couple of poses after the hook to show the steps taken by the character to get back into idle before performing the switch kick. We'll create the transition jump into the anticipation of the switch kick that is already blocked. After the kicking pose we will add an overshoot of the leg that will sell the power of the kick. And finally, we will add a transition pose before the two steps we have already blocked back into idle. Before building those poses, I've watched the reference and I've spot the frame that were interesting to me. Like this pose in between the idle and the first jab character is lowering his center of gravity and also pushing forward. So it will be a great anticipation. I've also noticed that the character is slightly dropping his hands during this anticipation. As a person pose for a walk cycle, I'm trying to find a good break down and the time where the character is pulling his left hand and pushing with the right hand seems to be pretty nice. Also adding notes as a reminder, that the torso is twisting a lot on this pose, Then I will spot the overshoot. If your reference doesn't show the next move, just put note on top of this and make sure that you look for new reference later on. So this is something I've been doing for every poses I wanted to add into the blocking stage. As in the previous videos our goal is not necessarily to copy But to check the body mechanisms that are involved and then push them to make our animation more exaggerated and more appealing. So let's work the step forward into the jab. As usual, I will try to define the line of action. The simple C shape the front foot is currently raising while the back foot is pushing. So as before I generally scrub around the current frame to check out the motion of the different parts of the body, the hands, the head, the feet, so that I don't forget to put them. And also I could choose whether I favorite the front foot to move further away or to be closer, to drop more the feet, to lean more the character forward, make any choice to exaggerate the current pose. Now in blender I will insert a key frame for all the controllers of both the character and the bag on the frame seven. Again, at this stage, we don't care about timing. We can do it on frame seven or eight doesn't matter. Then I want to get rid of the rest pose we have on frame zero. So I will duplicate frame five on frame zero. When working on an animation, if it's not a gameplay animation, I you advise you to keep five frames also in the beginning in the still pose so that you can get prepared to what is coming next. If you start your animation from frame zero, sometime it's a bit hard to read. The difference between this new pose and the previous one won't be that big. First I want to lower the center of gravity as our character is gathering energy to throw the punch. Then I pushed the center of gravity forward. As our character is already moving forward. The left foot is raised a little bit and slightly rotated towards the inside because it's going to leave the ground on the next frame. And so the center of gravity will shift a bit to the left. The character is pushing toward his left foot with his right foot. So you have to move the cog a bit to the left. Then I do a few adjustment with the arm, making them dragging it. So I raised the shoulder as the center of gravity is getting lower. I open the hand as the whole body's moving forward as if there was wind blowing into the palm of the character and I do the same with the neck and the head. As it drop into the step I slightly raise his chin. (swishing noise) When we watch the reference for the next pose, we can see that the character is currently pulling the left arm and bring it close to his chin to protect it. In the meantime, the right arm is traveling towards the target. The hips are twisting a lot. The center of gravity too and the chest is twisting, but dragging a little bit. Finally, the right foot is rotating a lot. So those are the main point we are going to address into our breakdown pose. As for the previous pose I will add a key frame on all the controllers of the bag and the character on frame 12. Again, at this stage, we don't care about timing. Since the location of the feet doesn't change between the previous and the next pose we can directly work on the center of gravity of the character. As the character is twisting to his left, his center of gravity is also shifting to the left foot. So we need to twist the center of gravity but we also need to move it to the left. Just imagine that the character is diving into the next punch with his left shoulder. As seen in the reference the right foot is rotating a lot. So I rotate it even more and I will raise it with the heel. Don't forget to adjust the position of the hips accordingly. Now we can twist a bit the chest, but don't forget that the hips are leading. So the chest may not twist as much as the hips for the time being. Once the punch is thrown, the chest will catch up with the hips. And as the weight is getting on the front left foot, I'm slightly tilting it to the left and I'm slightly pushing it down. This will mimic the compression of the foot on the ground. For this breakdown I decided to not go too into the orthodox boxing pose with the left fist very close to the chin. I've kept the left arm slightly more opened. This way we have a nice circular flow between the two arms. As I explained before, remember to move the arms with the anatomical constraint, rotating the elbow on neuron one axis, and don't forget to pose the bag. That's not the most important thing, but it will help you read your animation. To do so I reset all the controller of the bag, and then I slightly rotated it backward just after the little jab as if the jab has pushed it a bit and the bag is swinging.

## 08-05-02 Blocking breakdowns part02

[Instructor] As I'm starting a new pose, as usual, I will insert a key frame on all the controllers for both the bag and the character. The pose I'm going to create, is the overshoot after the right cross. Since it is performed just after the right cross, we can start by posing the bag. I've just swing the bag, using the main controller. I'm resetting the pose of all the other controller. Then I will select the wall forward kinematic chain, the blue controller, and slightly bend the bag. The idea is to swing the bag in reaction to the punch, so try to align its orientation with the previous pose of the punch. The process to create the overshoot is pretty straightforward. You just have to push further any pose you've picked. The chest was twisting, I twisted more. I've pushed the center of gravity forward and move it a bit to the left onto the supporting leg. I'm spreading the left arm that was swinging back. So basically I'm pushing the whole line of action. Guarding the right arm, I'm slightly bending it inward. The fun fact about this pose is that I haven't kept it in the end, but because it looks like the character is losing balance, and I was having a hard time to transition into the next pose. So it doesn't mean that this pose doesn't work, but it doesn't sell what I want to do with the character. And as explained many time before, as being a creative process, animation is not a linear workflow, so you may change your mind along the way. That's perfectly fine. Now comes the time where we are going to build the pose just after the hook. It is the moment where I need the character to rotate around his left foot and put his right foot behind, as being his real leg, before performing the switch kick. Before I start working on the character, I'm posing the bag exactly as I did for the previous pose. And then comes the painful moment where we don't have any reference for the next poses into the rest pose of God pose. And this is the time where you have to leave your chair, in the best case, shoot your own reference and, or at least try to the mimic the move in front of a big mirror or in front of nothing, and try to feel how your body's moving. Super important, as an animator, to try to act what you are animating. When doing crazy combat move, we do know that we can't do exactly the same, but just do it at a very slow pace. Just take the pose and transition into the other pose and your body will do the rest. I'm certainly not as impressive as the guy on the reference, but I do get enough information, at least some information, in order to perform the next move and to pose my character. I'm swinging back with my left arm after the hook. My feet are rotating, but they are not changing location. There is then a weight transfer upon my left leg while I'm rotating the right shoulder, so my whole chest toward the next contact pose. The right foot will contact first, and then the center of gravity will catch up. While rotating, my weight is mostly on the left leg, and then, I can go into the switch kick. So from there, I can go back into Blender and start working on my pose. We need to mostly shift the weight upon the left leg. As I did many time before I will console any transform on both the hips and the chest. As explained before learning wise, it's better to start your new pose from scratch, and it's also a good way to avoid to inherit mistakes from the previous pose. Adding a quick look to the reference pose I've attached, we can clearly see the line of action has a S shape. The supporting leg is pushing the hips up, and the hips are leading the rotation. So the hips are twisted more than the shoulders or the chest. Now, I like to focus on some artistic choice. On the reference, we can see that I'm lifting my right foot pretty high. While on the reference pose, I've decided to make tip of the toes sliding on the ground, as if my character was ice skating. So I've straightened a bit the leg, and I make the toes drag on the ground. This is creating a nice flow to the silhouette of the character, but also to the move. I will be able to create a nice arc using the foot. Instead of pulling the arm back in guard, I've decided to make them drag more. This will create a larger arc whenever I will be pulling the arm, and they will form an elliptic shape, so the whole pose is supporting or drawing the rotation of the character. And this is all I generally build my pose to get very smooth motion. I try to respect the physicality of the motion, placing the center of gravity upon the supporting foot. I respect the chest and hips shape, but as soon as I can, I try to create some kind of choreographing motion, meaning that I will pose the arms and the legs as if the character was totally mastering what he's doing and trying to input a bit of beauty in his movement. From the previous pose, we can settle into the next pose. The right foot has reach its final position and is flatten on the ground. Now the center of gravity is on the right foot. It's no longer on the left foot. The chest is twisted backward, so the right shoulder is in the back while it was dragging in the previous pose. The left fist is forward while the right fist is a little backward. If we compare the previous pose and the current pose from the top view, we can clearly see the twisting or rotation of the upper body, leading into a big contrast regarding the arm poses. The current pose is pretty close to the ideal pose of the character, but the center of gravity is slightly lower, so the character looks a little heavier on his feet. Both feet are flattened on the ground, and the character makes a nice C shape from a profile. This is a good anticipation pose for the next move. To jump into the switch kick, the character is gathering energy. This is why we have lowered its center of gravity. And it does a bit of a squat stance with his legs. Think of the spine as a spring. If you bend it in a way, when you will release the force, it will bend the other way. From there, I just need to tweak the position of the arms to match the reference I've attached. Don't worry if you weren't able to follow along with this video. The idea is to highlight the important point you have to look after, and then I will provide you a slow-paced time lapse, so that you can see the whole process.

## 08-05-03 Blocking breakdowns part03

[Instructor] We still have a couple of breakdowns to add to our current animation, but before we do so I'd like to give myself some space on the action editor. As explained before, for the time being, I'm not working on the timing of my animation, only the poses. So I want to move all the poses of my character and the punching bag every five frames. So instead of working on the action of the character and the action of the bag separately, I will switch to the dope sheet. The dope sheet will expose me all the keys frame available in the actual blender scene. If I collapse the action details in the dope sheet, we can see that both the Trident and punching bag armature are listed in the dope sheet, along with their own actions. And since we were posing those two in sync, their key frame are aligned. So by clicking the summary key, I can select all the keys for both the action and offset them in time. From there, back onto my current animation, I will select the summary keys and position them every five frames. This is a good moment to review the different poses and see how they flow one with the other. And this is generally the time where I find tweak some of the poses. I may push them a little more. You may spot weird poses of the shoulder or the shape of the arms or the position of the center of gravity compared to the previous or next pose. Since it's a creative process, it's sometimes hard to clearly explain what I'm doing because it's a lot about feeling. And when you scrub through your different poses, you may feel that something is wrong or that something could be improving the flow of your poses, and the blocking stage is the moment to do it. The next breakdown I'm going to do is the jump during the switch for the switch kick. I'm going to do a pose where are both feet are in the air. Depending on the reference and watching distance might be more or less opened. Liam Narissan on the left side has a crazy open stance because he's going to throw a very powerful kick. There a very quick and subtle moment during the switch where the body is making a C shape toward the left shoulder. And then as a spring, the body bent the opposite way, and this is what I want to achieve with this breakdown pose. I'm not sure if it's super accurate, but it does seem to work. And if it doesn't work in the end, I can change it to later on. One super important detail that I want you to spot before posing your character is the position of the right foot. Look, how much it is open to the outside whenever it hits the ground. With this position, as soon as the left foot will leave the ground, the hips will naturally twist towards the right foot, increasing the power of the kick. So when I'm posing the right foot I make sure that, even in the air, it starts to open a bit. The foot doesn't rotate when it hits the ground, but just before, when it is in the air. Keeping the right foot pretty flat while the left foot will land on its tip. So I make sure that the tip of the left foot is pointing toward its landing zone. The left arm is raising, the right arm is dropping. So I make a bit the forearm dragging, meaning that the left arm will be slightly straighter while the right arm will be slightly bent. Finally, I've exaggerated the C shape of the torso, maybe a bit too much. I will see that later on. For the next pose. I wanted to create the overshoot just after the leg hit the bag. At this point, the leg is almost straight as the kicker is trying to get through the bag or through the pose. What's interesting is that at this very stage, the hips already start to twist backwards and then the shoulders will follow. And if you watch the right heel, it seems it's hitting a wall. This is also a moment where I am going to build a little smear on the left leg. Using the tweaker bone, I slightly the break the joint to bend it into a knock that is the opposite direction a leg normally bend. While the body of our character is not supposed to move that much, this recreate a nice contrast in the shapes of the leg and will better communicate the strength of the impact. As it is an overshoot, I want to push for one beat and then we need to twist it back a little bit in reaction to the impact with the bag. We need to do the same with the hips and the chest controller. This is the time where the right foot hit its extreme toward the target, so I rotate it a bit to the left. Since the left arm was swinging back, I will rotate it a bit backward. And since the right arm was rotating forward, I will rotate eat a little more forward. Regarding the left leg, I want to exaggerate its pose, so I will push the left foot controller further away from the hips. I've also repositioned the pull target to make sure that the knee's not flipping. It's totally fine to have some stretching in the leg, because whenever we are building a smear frame, it won't last more than one or two frames. If you were supposed to feel this beyond, not see it. You want to the knock that will wrap around the punching bag, so I'm even rotating the toes in this direction. I've enabled the trochlear of the leg in the read UI. And from there, I will move them one by one to shape the leg into a knock. Start with the new controller, as it allows you to bend the knee backward and then use the smaller tweaker bone to create a the arc with the sheen of the character. As I was building the pose and rotating a lot around my character, I've noticed that the punching bag was not reacting in the right direction. Eventually, I fixed this by reworking all the pose after the kick. Slowly but surely, and even without working on the timing, our animation flow is getting better and better. The very last pose I've created for this breakdown stage is the transition into idle. It's the moment where the left leg is dropping, almost straight, into a nice arc. All the weight is on the right foot and counter balancing the left leg. So the body is creating a nice C shape to the right. This is not a very difficult pose to build since it's really flowing between the kicking pose and the next pose. Don't forget to also rework the bag and move some of these poses. It doesn't matter if you have a hard time with the bag. The most important pose are the contact pose with the character. If at this stage, you have a hard time figuring out all the poses of the bag, that's not a problem. For the time being, keep the poses of the bag and the character synchronized. When we will on the timing of the character, it will be easier to figure out the timing for the bag too. Regarding the current pose, to be honest, I don't really know what to say since it's a pretty simple pose. You have the reference, just try your best to fit what you are seeing. In the next video we are going to give a first pass to the timing of our blocking.

## 08-05-04 Timing pass

[Instructor] So let's add quick timing pass to our blocking. so is that we convert all those poses into something that will look like an actual animation. If you are doing the same animation as I do, here is a screen capture of my timing. You may have noticed that my key frame have colors. In the dope sheet or the action editor you can select keys and press R to give them a color. Those different colors have a different label. But those are just references. They absolutely not affect the way the keys will behave. And they are just here to give you a point of reference in your timeline. I personally never use them, but for the course it's a good tool for you to have a point in reference in time whenever you are watching my content. Regarding the timing pass in itself, I advise you to work by chunks. For example, I'm working on the timing of the anticipation of the right cross, the impact, and the overshoot. And when this feels right, I will try to time it with the previous pose. Remember that you can use the video reference to time your blocking. I want the first two punches to flow pretty quickly. Since I'm animating at two to four frames between the two punches should be enough. This way I should get the bam, bam I wanted initially. With this first chunk done, I can then work on the second half of the animation. But I want a pretty big anticipation on the hook to break the rhythm of the animation and also give it more strength. Though some poses are easier to time, like the overshoot of the kick generally. And overshoot is one or two frame after the current hit on the current extreme. There, it's a lot of back and forth. You have to play the animation a lot, then move some of the keys and see if the flow is getting better. I would also recommend you to share your work at this stage if you can. It's always very valuable to have fresh eyes upon your work, even if it's not a professional animator. When you're animating all day long, you easily get over focused and you have a hard time spotting what's wrong or right into your animation. So as you can see, I played the animation several time, and then I decided to whether increase or decrease the length of a pose. Here for example, I will make the anticipation from the hook a little longer. It will bring more power to the hook. One last advice I'd like to remind you, give yourself some space at the end of the animation. This way you will clearly identify when the animation is finishing and when it's restarting. It will remove the visual noise of your character jumping from one position to the other.

## 08-06 Breakdowner tool

[Instructor] Before we start detailing our blocking, I'd like to introduce a new tool that will help us accelerating the process. It's the Breakdowner tool. To show it to you, I've created this simple action with the bouncing ball rig, with the main controller only animated on the Z location access. The Breakdowner tool is accessible in the tool panel on the left whenever you are in Pose Mode. You can also access the Breakdowner option going into the editor, Pose, In-Betweens, and the different Breakdowner option will be available here. If I now go on frame two, where the ball stopped to raised the air and I will select the Breakdowner tool on the left. If I now left click and drag in the 3D view port, You will see the ball going up and down, whether going toward the pose on frame number five or the pose on frame zero. And as I'm doing it, you can see that we have a percentage of breakdown shown in the top left corner. Currently 40%, this percentage correspond to whether we are favorizing frame zero or frame five. If I create a breakdown this way, we have a value of zero, it will be exactly in the same pose as pose zero. With a value of 100%, exactly the same pose as frame five. If I use a value of 50% for the breakdown, the pose that will be created using the breakdown now will be exactly in the middle between the pose on frame five and the pose on frame zero. As most Blender tool, we can isolate the channel we want whenever we are using the Breakdowner. Here I input a rotation pose on frame five so the ball is interpolating both its location and its rotation from frame zero to frame five. I now go to the Breakdowner menu, choose the Breakdowner. Or, you can use the shortcut shift+E to activate it. If I then press R, it will only work with the rotation of the ball. If I press shift+E and then G, it will only work with the location of the ball. And you can absolutely combine those with the X, Y, and Z key. If I go on frame two, press shift+E to activate the Breakdowner, then G, then X, the ball will only slide along the X axis. It behaves exactly the same way as any transform tool. Two other tools are available to us. The Relax tool, that we can access with alt+E, and the Push tool that we can access with ctrl+E. If my player is on the frame with a key, and then I press alt+E to Relax the current pose, the resulting pose will be closer to pose zero as I get to 100%. If instead, I press ctrl+E, it will Push the current pose. So basically, it will check the interpolation between frame zero and five. The ball is raising, and it will Push it higher. The Relax pose tools that you can call using alt+E will create an intermediate key pose, or breakdown of arranging the pose, between the previous key frame and the next key frame. So using alt+E and Push it over 100% is exactly the same that using shift+E the classic Breakdowner, and set it to 50%. So this tool is very useful when you start to detailing your blocking. For example, here I have two poses that are pretty extreme, meaning that there is a big contrast between those two poses. With the torso root controller selected, I can press shift+E, and Blender will start interpolating between those two keys. From there, I can choose to lower this controller to create a better arc instead of having a straight line. And then, I can choose to use the Breakdowner on the chest controller, and whether keep a low percentage so that I'm favorizing the previous pose, or I can go beyond 50% if I want to rotate more the chest as if it was leading the animation. So it's a very cool tool to quickly block your breakdowns. But I do advise you to use it very cautiously and as less as possible. I generally use it only for the root of my character, and sometime to position the feet. It's a fantastic tool to keep track of your arcs, but certainly not a good tool to pose your character. To summarize, we have seen that the breakdowners allow us to create a key between the two poses by choosing the level of interpolation we want between those two keys. As any transform channels, we can enter the value we want the interpolation to be processed with. We can isolate the location, rotation, or scale of the transformed channels, and we can choose the axis we want to use the tool on. There is also a Push tool and the Relax tool, but I don't think they are very useful since we can achieve the same result with the Relax tool using the Breakdowner. And I don't advise you to Push your poses using a tool like that. I would do this by hand to get a more accurate result. The Breakdowner is a super cool tool to keep track of your arcs, and get a base for your pose and break downs, but I would never use it to create the final pose of one of my character.

## 08-07-01 Detailed blocking part 01

In this video, we will start to Detailing our Blocking. It currently looked like that and our goal is to add as many poses as possible to avoid any interpretation of the Blocking. Here you can see the result of this Detailed Blocking or Blocking plus. Your objective when you're doing the Blocking plus or Detailed Blocking is to spot any big changes in the silhouette or pose of your character and create an intermediate pose or a transition pose. This is also the moment where you will lock the anticipation and your overshoot. So, that when you will switch into Spline, you will have as less floating and timing issue compared to the Blocking as possible. The first pose I'm going to work on is the overshoot of the right cross. The current post we are seeing is the extreme we have built during the Blocking stage and here is you overshoot. I'm extending the whole body on one frame. I'm creating this pose one frame after the extreme. It'll create a visual pop that will better sell the speed of the punch. It's a pretty easy pose to achieve. Just twist a bit more the chest, align the hips, move the torso controller forward and then extend the arm. But we can lean a bit more the head into the shot and spread the left arm backward as it was swinging in the previous post. From there it's all about exaggeration. Take the chest controller and move it on the y-axis. Don't rotate it but currently change its location and do the same with the arm. I'm taking each controller and I'm moving them forward on their local Y-axis. When you're pushing the pose or you are pushing the rig, it might generate some visual artifact, especially regarding the deformation of the chest. This is the time where you can use the torso three controller, move them and scale them a bit to fix the shape of the torso and its silhouette. As explained in the previous chapter, I was not really satisfied with the frame 21. Because it feels like the character is falling forward. So, I've decided to remove this pose and we will create a better pose later on. Before I delete the key frame, I will simply move them away at the end of the animation so, that I can watch the animation without this pose and then put it back in if needed. Or if I want I can switch the poses by simply moving the key frame in and out and play the animation and choose the one I prefer. Once my choice is made, I can get rid of the pose I don't need anymore. The next pose I need to build is the Transition into the hook anticipation. So, basically at the end of the right cross, the right foot is catching up and our characters need to pull its right arm back into it's guard. The center of gravity is still mainly supported by the left foot but it's shifting towards the right foot. As I often do whenever I am building a pose that is very different from the previous one, I will cancel the rotation on the chest hips and even on the center of gravity or torso root controller. I've also canceled the old transform on the neck, on the head, on the shoulders and the arms. But if we have a look at the reference pose, we can see that the center of gravity is mostly upon the left leg. While the hips are mostly pointing forward, the chest is slightly dragging and so does the right arm. So, it's a bit extended Transitioning into the hook anticipation. We will sure need additional poses to Detail this Transition, but it already improve a lot the readability of the animation. Make sure that the top of the body's delayed compared to the hips so, that the chest and the arms are dragging a bit. Since we have a foot position change between the current pose and the hook anticipation, I you advise you to create the pose where the foot is currently contacting with its new location. During the Blocking stage, you should create a pose each time a foot is contacting the ground. So, what I will do is that on the anticipation pose with the foot controller selected, I will press Ctrl+C to copy its pose. Since this is the moment where the foot is contacting the ground, I will make sure that it touches it with its inner edge, and they will slightly raise the tip of the toes and rotate the toes backwards. But whenever you're trying to raise a leg, your center of gravity will shift toward the supporting leg. So, I've pushed the center of gravity on to the right foot. Finally, our character was still pulling his right arm back and his left arm in front. So, the chest will be slightly rotating backward and the left arm is raised near the temples of the character in guard. Whenever you think you're done with a pose, don't forget to scrub through your animation and see how it flows between the previous and the next one. You will most likely feel the need to whether fix the pose you're working on or rework the previous or next pose. The pose you will have the clearer will be the flow of your animation. So, you will not surely retract the arcs of the ends of the head of the chest of your character and maybe fine tune the different poses so, that those arc currently looks good. As you can see, I have a big gap between the current anticipation of the hook and the hook itself. To better sell the power of the hook, I want this long anticipation. So, we need to hold the current pose and so, we will create a moving hold. So, basically it's a pose that is very close to what we have on the frame 35, but I'm just pushing it a little more. Animation wise, it will look as if we were holding the pose 35 for five frames, but our character will still be moving. This why we called this a moving hold. Also, they really help to lock your anticipation. So, that whenever we will switch to spline our character won't be transitioning from the anticipation directly into the hook in a slow motion, but he will hold the current anticipation and rapidly transition into the hook. Note that there is a difference between this and an overshoot. Here I am not making the arms dragging instead I'm contracting them. So, I'm slightly closing the shape on the arms. It's not a reaction to the momentum of the previous pose. At some point, don't forget to also pose the bag. The most important poses are the poses where the bag is in contact with your character. If the other poses are not right, that's not a big deal. We will be able to almost animate them in straightforward once we have polished our character animation. It will be way easier to play with the curve to get our pendulum right than trying to block it. But if you are motivated, I advise you to try to block the motion of the back. At least that's a good training because you will have to try to figure out the position of the bag in space, based on the pose of your character and the timing between one punch and the next, for example. Also it will improve your Blocking readability. But again, this is not mandatory if you're not comfortable with this.

## 08-07-02 Detailed blocking part 02

[Narrator] Here we go again. Let's add even more details to our blocking. On the video reference, there is the killer- (cut off) Whenever Liam Arison is throwing his hook, I'm kind of shaking in his left shoulder in his chest, and in his head. it looks like the recoil of a shotgun or something like that. To build this effect I will need two poses, one overshoot of the whole torso we have the left arm will stay still and then a second pose where the whole body will be pushed backward by the force applied to the bag by the left arm. So basically what we need to do is create an overshoot for the whole torso, push it further forward twist model chest controller, rotate the head and the neck to the right open the right arm, and then contrapose the left shoulder and hold left arm controller as if there were some kind of recoil. And try to keep the fist in the same position World-space-wise as the previous pose. Even if it's hidden by the bag, you can squash a bit the fist too. Maybe we will be able to try some little tricks to better sell the impact during the polishing stage. From there when I'm looking at the motion of the bag, it seems that its trajectory is not really good. And since this is an impact frame, I will give it some love and spend a bit of time to reshape the bag and better align it with the punch. As usual, after we have reviewed all the poses, I will provide you a slow paced timelapse so that you can follow along all the manipulation I'm doing. Just to note, don't forget to slightly change the position of the feet. The next pose we are going to build is the actual recoil after the punch. As seen on the reference in the beginning of this video, just after the impact, the chest, the center of gravity and the hips are twisting to the left. It's a pretty subtle change compared to the previous pose. All the location and rotation of the torso is going the opposite way compared with the previous pose. So, it's very important to add another pose, like the bounce in your bouncing ball while the location of the ball doesn't change, its shape and the momentum of the ball is completely changing. So you need to block this. If you will whenever the momentum or the energy of the current motion is brutally changing direction, you should always block those poses. Getting this pose right is a lot about the amount of twisting you input into the chest and the center of gravity. Then you can find tweaks, the shoulders position, the angle made by the arms, et cetera. I've decided to keep the armor pretty angular into a closed stance So that it really sells the fact that our character is fully contracted. If our character was more relaxed, I will loosen a bit the arms and I will open them a bit more. Since this pose occurs after the hit, don't hesitate to push the heavy bag away from the character. The further it is, the more powerful will the hook feel. If you can bend, a bit, the bag towards the point it came from. This will bring a bit of overlapping motions that will make it look a little more organic. (wind wooshing) I previously explain you that you should always lock the poses when the feet are getting in contact with the ground. Well, I also advise you to block the poses whenever the feet are leaving the ground. For the switch of the switch kick, we have the previous pose with both feet on the ground, and then we have the pose where both feet have left the ground. So we currently need to block the pose where the character is pushing into the jump and still has one foot on the ground. As we watch the reference, we can see it's a pretty quick jump. And the right foot is the last to leave the ground. The goal of this jump is not to get as high as possible or to cover distance. It's all about repositioning the feet so that the kicking leg is in the back and have more range to move towards the targets. So don't push the center of gravity too high. You can push it a bit to the front and a bit to the left since the whole weight was on top of the right foot and now the right foot is pushing. So the center of gravity will slightly shift towards the front, but also so toward the left. Then as the character is rising, you can drop a bit the arms. (wind wooshing) Same concept comes for the next pose. After the jump, our character doesn't contact the ground with both feet at the same time. So we do need to build the pose where the first feet is contacting the ground. And as I double check the reference, we can see that the left foot is the first to land. So this is what I'm going to build. But pose wise and motion wise, I feel like the kick and the switch from Liam Arison on the left look way more badass. As he lands almost into his anticipation position and throw the kick right away. I may not be super objective since I love his style. To get the left foot in the correct position, I will simply select it. Then go to the pose where it's in contact with the ground, copy the pose and paste it on the previous frame. Since this is the contact pose, I will raise the toes so that on the next frame, they will slap on the ground creating a nice overlapping motion. To find the pose of the torso controller, I will use the breakdowner so I will press shift-E and I will use a value around 60% and I will repeat the process with the foot, the hips, and the chest. The value of the breakdowner is not the important point. Plus this will change depending on the timing of animation, if you have the same pose as I have, or not, and from one controller to the other, the timing won't be the same. So the use of the breakdowner and the value of the breakdowner will change. Your job is to watch the reference and understand which part of the body is arriving first in the next pose and use the breakdowner accordingly, the transition between the landing pose and the kick and the moment the kick is being released is very short. So I've dealt with the next pose exactly as I will do with a bouncing ball. As I am finishing to build the pose before the anticipation of the kick, I will consider the next frame as the contact pose with both feet contacting the ground. Then we can consider the next pose as the ball squashing on the ground before jumping back. So I will squash the body of my character by slightly lowering its' center of gravity, before he rise again into the kick. The difference between the two pose will be very subtle. My goal here is to create some kind of moving hold as we did for the anticipation of the hook. But this time the transition will be very short, like one or two frames! So I won't be building a moving hold with a lot of amplitudes. I will simply slightly lower the center of gravity slightly twist the character, maybe push a bit the arms inward before the release. A bit, as if I was creating an overshoot of the previous pose. The goal is not truly to guide my posing, but mostly to lock my timing. And when I will switch to spline, there won't be any surprises regarding the timing of this part of the animation, since I'm animating "on ones". So I have a key frame on every single frame here, but it doesn't mean that I won't have to rework those poses during the polishing stage with the graph editor.

## 08-07-03 Detailed blocking part 03

The next pose I'd like to add to my animation is the subtle, just after the other shoot of the cross punch. To our right cross default pose, we have created a pose where everything is extended forward so that it better communicate impact and speed. As a smear frame, this kind of pose can't last too long, or it will really looks weird. So we need to burn a subtle pose, where we get rid of all the exaggeration, the chest we'll get back in place. The hips will catch up and the right arm will recover it's normal size. Not that the left arm is doing an overshoot and finishing it's ark by getting a little straighter. So building this pose is going to be pretty straight forward. I will pull the beat to the center of gravity back and I will reset the location on all the bones on the arm so that it's not stretched anymore. I will do the same with the IEPs and the chest. And then, I will reset or transform on the tweaker bone, along the chain of the spine. We have used those bones to fix the shape of the torso when it was extended, but we don't need them anymore. It's in the chest to the right. And as the left arm was a swinging back during the previous frames, I will spread a bit more the whole arm chain as it is finishing its motion back. So compared to the previous pose I have built during the blocking stage, I've kept the character way straighter this time. I was initially planning to make him dive into the anticipation for the hook, but the character look way out of balance. I prefer that he pulled back his right arm so that the right leg can catch up and then dive into the anticipation for the hook. So we do need to build the pose where the right foot is catching up. If we watch the previous pose, we have built and the next one in the animation that we can see that as the right foot is going forward, the chest is going backwards into a more neutral pose. We are going to break the position between where the right foot is still traveling, and so our characters center of gravity is more to while that the left leg. He's still lightweight on his right foot and pulling it. This is why I raised the heel as the hips are leading the animation because they are dragging the character backward the chest is dragging. So does the right arm chain, but they have already started to move backward. Particularly the lower part of our character is visualizing the next pose, while the upper part is visualizing the previous pose. On this lead there is not that much to say about the posing process whenever I'm building these specific in-between. So I will jump to the next pose. As usual, you will find a slow paced time-lapse of the whole processes that you can follow along. (wind rushing) The next area of our animation is, that really lacks information, is the step- back after the kick. We have already built the pose where our character is pulling his left leg back after the kick, then going into the contact pose, and then it's idle pose, right leg goes back and supports to weight of the character. But we do need to create the poses where our character will be pulling his right leg. Then when the right leg is going to contact, then you can even create a down pose. Before you settle into the idle pose. To start positioning the torso controller, you can press shift E to activate the break down there. And then you can slightly offset the torso controller to the left, on top of the left leg that is going to support the weight of the character as the left leg is supporting the weight of the character, I'm concealing the rotation of the heels is that it's in contact with the ground and they've slightly pushed the left foot into the ground, to fake body pressure. Then you can slightly lean your character to the left as he's pulling his right leg up. Normally I will slightly clench or pose the chest by twisting it to the right. Since the hips are twisting the other way to pull the right leg. Finally, you can relax a bit the arms by spreading them. In this case, the right leg looks a little bit too over extended, so I will slightly raise the foot as it starts traveling backwards. We know of the pose where the foot is taking off, we need to create the post where the foot is just contacting the ground. As usual, you need to first think of the position of the center of gravity. The feet are traveling faster. So the center of gravity will still be more onto the left foot, which is supporting the weight, but also more forward. It will catch up the right leg later on. It's a common beginner mistake to see the center of gravity traveling as fast as the feet. But generally your center of gravity, starting to move backward The front foot is taking off, then it will land, and then the center of gravity will catch-up. From there, since our character is more relaxed than during the punches, I'm trying to make the arm strike a bit. So if the body is moving backward, I will slightly rotate the arm forward. If the body's going down, I will slightly rotate the arm up and I will do the same with the neck and the head of the character. You can track the chin of your character. For example, if the body is going down, or the center of gravity is going down, slightly rotate the head backwards so that the chin is raising it. (wind rushing) While our character is moving back. You can take this opportunity to pose the punching bag as it lands on the ground. So, instead of making each landing flat, I will slightly raise the tip of the bag. And then on the next pose, I will push it further away so that it seems to slide on the ground. Just push it a touch, don't move it too far away or it will looks weird. (wind rushing) Another area of the animation, where the feet are changing location and we haven't created the contacting pose, is the jab. As usual to get the right location for the left foot I will go on to the jab pose. I will press control C to copy the pose of the left foot, go to a previous frame and press control V. From there I can tweak the foot rotation and the heel rotation. Remember what we have said before, the feet move faster than the center of gravity. So using the break downer, I will create the pose for the center of gravity, favoring the previous pose. So if we compare the pose of our character on the previous frame and on the jab frame, and now we watch the transition frame we are currently building. Foot is moving faster than the center of gravity. As the character is pushing with his right leg, the center of gravity is likely shifting toward the left foot. Don't forget to also twist the center of gravity towards the left foot, increasing the range and the strength of the punch. Another detail regarding this pose is that I've opened, a bit, the fingers so that it feels like they are dragging back as the character is moving fast forward. The finger of the right hand are relaxed, are bending backward as they are dragging back. This is the kind of detail that could have been added during the polishing stage. But if you think of something during the looking stage, you should the block it because you may forget it afterwards.

## 08-07-04 Detailed blocking part 04

[Instructor] We are almost done with our detailed blocking. At this stage, I am still searching for big changes in the character pose momentum. I check the poses I have to see if they all communicate the changes or forces or momentum in the character body. After the right cross, there are two motions - The one where the character is pulling his right arm back, and then where it is anticipating the hook, pulling his left arm back. This is also the moment where the character is transferring his weight onto the left leg. As he does through those two poses, the motion is pretty linear. And every part of the chest are moving at the same speed. So the pose I'd like to add is the entering V8 pose. Where the chest will drag compared to the hips and the arms will drag too. Toward the lower part of the body twisting toward the left leg. The upper part of the body is dragging a bit and so does the arms before diving into the next pose. So in the end, this is not a very complicated pose. We will favorize the next pose with the root of the character as the weight is shifting pretty quickly onto the left leg, but then you will rotate the chest toward the previous pose. And since the arms are dragging, you will rotate them even more toward the previous pose. The trick is to track the path of your elbows, make sure that you twist the chest a little backward as it is dragging. And from there, track the left arm joints and make sure that they are dragging into the hook anticipation. As our character's recovering from the hook and step back before the switch kick, there is no anticipation between this settle pose and the start of the jumping into the switch kick. Since it's a very fast transition into the switch kick, we just need a micro anticipation. So it will be a down pose that will occur over a couple of frames only and that will have a very small amplitude. It will just create an extra little motion that will make the jumping to read better. When you create an anticipation, it's both for your character to gather energy, but also for your audience to have the time to prepare for the next move. This is a pose that will be relatively easy to create. We just need to pull back a bit to center of gravity, lower it, and also move it a bit toward the right leg. And since the center of gravity is moving down, we will slightly raise the arms. Raise the head. Make every features of the body that are further away from the center of gravity to drag a bit. The almost last pose we are going to create is the smear pose during the hook. As explained during the posing chapter, this is an exaggeration pose that will fake the motion blur whenever we have a very fast motion. The shape of the arms are here to support the flow of the hook. This is why from top view it becomes an elliptic shape so that it better communicates the twisting of the body during the hook. To pose the center of gravity and the chest, I'm using the breakdowner and I am favorizing the next pose. The Impact Pose. Because the center of gravity in the chest are currently leading the motion compared to the arms. They are pulling the shoulders and pulling the arms. So we need to favorize the center of gravity in the chest toward the next pose, while the arms will be dragging. So the method to create those mills is to first create a natural pose, the pose that your character would have in real life whenever he is throwing the punch. And once you have the right angle for the arm, you can start pulling the tweaker controller to create a nice C curve toward the target. The most important thing when you are doing this kind of a smear pose is to make sure that you foresee the path of the elbow and the wrist, and you make sure that you align the arm along this path. So it's very important to rotate around your character and jump between the previous and next pose. Once you've done the left arm, work on the right arm and don't forget that why we are creating an exaggerated pose, you should still pose the shoulders to better position the arms and also keep a believable pose, a believable flow into your pose. Finally, don't forget to check the feet movement. Whenever you are birding a strong pose for a part of the body, like the arms in this case, we often forget to move the head, move the feet, move the knees, or move the hips. So it's important not to over-focus on one part on the character. But since the kick is also a very fast circular movement, we will create a smear for this motion too. As for the hook, I am first posing the center of gravity, using the breakdowner, and then tweaking its position. The center of gravity and the hips are leading the motion and the foot is supposed to drag a lot. Spacing-wise, when you're making a striking motion, you want to ease out of the anticipation. So have a close spacing in the beginning of the motion, and then it accelerates before the impact. The spacing between the impact and the previous frame should be the biggest. I'm using the same principle as for the previous pose. I first bird a believable pose or realistic pose, let's say. Be extra careful with the center of gravity, hips, and chest position. While during the first punch, the momentum of our character was out of balance as he was punching forward. In this case, he's spinning around his right foot. So your character must feel balanced during this kick. Plus, the hips and the chest are leading the motion. So if you don't get them right, it will be harder then to get the arms and the legs right. Remember that this kind of pose is made to support the flow of the motion. So try to bird your arc around the path that the knee and the ankle or the knee and the foot would take to get to the target. So make sure you refine your smear frame so that you don't get any weird angle on the leg. Try to smooth it as possible based on the rate possibilities. Then since this part of the animation is very fast, I advise you to bird the previous pose. The one where the foot is just taking off. Use the breakdowner and align the foot with the motion path or the path you think it will take to get to its target. During this pose, the feet and the torso are easing out from the previous pose. Remember that you should favorize the previous pose as the feet is accelerating. So it starts slow and then go faster and faster and travel more and more further away from its starting point. With all the poses we have created, we should have enough information to go into sparring. But before, we should fine tweak the timing of our animation. So we'll do this in the next video.

## 08-07-05 Timing pass

[Instructor] Here is the final timing pass for our blocking of the animation. As explained before, there is no motion between frame zero and frame five. Those first frames are just here so that we can have a look through the whole scene, see our character in the fighting stance, and start to think of what's going to happen. From there, our character is easing into the first bench. So, we first have three frames later, the anticipation, with this moving forward and a bit downward. A couple of frames later, we have our contact pose and a couple of frames later, the current jab, with another extended left arm and a frame later, the same pose, but with the arm back into position. This little trick creates a more snappy impact. Then we have a fast transition into the right cross. On only two frames, our character starts to swing it's right arm. Two frames later, we have the impact with the bag. And one frame later, we get the overshoot. So this time we create the overextension of the arm, a frame after the impact. so that there is more the sense of penetration than just little snappy punch. And it takes three more frames for our character to recover its normal body shape, let's say. Then over five frames, the right food is catching up and then pushing, in a way, the left foot over two frames. From there, our character is ready to go into the anticipation of the hook. So he will ease out into the anticipation. So it will take five frames to get into the anticipation and five additional frames of moving all the weaving overshoot. Or an exaggerated anticipation so that the hook will look even more powerful. From there over a couple of frames, we have the fast swing, one from later, the impact, two frame later the overshoot, and on frame forty seven, the recoil. On frame fifty, we have the down pose after the hook, then it takes six frame for the right foot to reach its contact pose. And from there five additional frames to get into the down pose that will serve as the anticipation before the switch kick. From our micro-anticipation on frame sixty one, our character will be pushing on two frames and will be airborne on frame sixty six. On there we are animating on once the contacting of the left foot, then the right foot, then a slight down pose. From there, I want to build a strong easing of the foot. So we have two frames for the foot to leave the ground. And then it's animating on once until the impact on the bag. The impact is put over all four frames, so that our character is holding the pose for a long time and need to look more impactful. from there, the left foot is easing into a drop to what it's contact pose ten frames later on frame eight eight. Six frame later on the right foot, is contacting back, before easing five frames later into the new idol pose.

## 08-08 Camera

[Instructor] In this video, we are going to set up our camera. Initial goal of this combo animation is not to teach you how to frame your character. I think the camera now will help us take some decision during the position stage. Since I don't have a clear direction regarding the framing of this animation, it wasn't planned ahead, what I'm doing is that I'm just positioning my 3D view and see how I can frame my character. Play a few frame of the animation and see if it works. By default Blender 3D view is set to a 50 millimeter focal length. So this is something we have to take in account whenever we are trying to frame our character, pretty freely for the time being. On the initial pose when I'm facing the character, it looks pretty cool. His base pose reads pretty well and we do understand that his objective is the punching bag. But when I play the animation, the punches don't look that powerful and the character is often hidden by the bag. When we have build those first poses, we have intentionally created straight shapes for our character. So there are big chances that those shapes will read well from side view. In this regard, we will probably favorize a side view for those two initial punches. Whether we are facing the inside of the character or the outside or back of the character, when he's punching. While I'm pretty convinced of the framing for the beginning of the combo, when the hook happened, I don't feel like it reads well. While if I rotate the 3D view to face the character, I better see the anticipation and I also better see the arc built by the fists. So I know that I will have to transition from a side view to a more frontal view of the character. Also I think like it looks a little better when we get closer to the ground to frame the hook. The characters look more impressive and he's dominating the view. Now regarding the kick, the anticipation looks very good from there but the character get hidden by the bag during the kicking pose. And there is a lot of verticality into the pose so I feel like we lose a bit the orientation of the kick. While if we continue rotating a bit the camera, we get a very interesting framing because we can see the eyes of our character in the negative space drawn by the leg and the arm. We still I've have a very strong orientation of the kicking pose, so it doesn't ruin all the work we have done before. One thing we can do to improve those close range action shot is to increase the angle of view by reducing the focal length of our 3D view. I will switch from 50 to 30 millimeters and while it doesn't really improve the side view, when it comes to spinning strikes, like the hook or the kick, it does look way better for sure. The characters look stronger and the arcs reads way better. Finally, that will be cool if in the end, the punching bag was still framed and projected away from the camera. Because it communicates the fact that our character has extra human power and he kicked so hard that he has broken the chains of the punching bag. So it does improve the understanding of the current shot, so it does improve staging. Now regarding the camera initial position, here is a cool trick I've learned from Daniel Dettol while I was working on this specific animation. He explained me that it's better to set the camera so that it rotates the opposite way as the character. Our character is pivoting around this side of the bag. So if we place the camera to the side and we follow the motion of the character, we will mostly be looking at his back. Plus in the end, we will probably have to revise the camera position a little backward to be sure that we properly frame the kicking pose. But why if we place the camera on the other side? We will have a continuous rotation of the camera, with an easing at the end into the kick, and it will move the opposite way of the character. So it will increase the rotation feeling. When you are following a car on the highway, you feel like the car is pretty static. While when the car is running the opposite direction as you're, both speed are added on top of each other, and it feels like it goes super fast. So let's add our camera. If it's not already the case go to your preferences, add on, and search for camera, and activate the camera, add camera rigs. This is the same add on we've been using for our squirrel character scene. From there make sure you are in object mode, press Shift, A, go to camera, and add a dolly camera rig. With the dolly camera rig object selected press Control, Tab to switch to pose mode. But we need to create an action to control the camera. So I will switch to the action editor, create a new action, give it a relevant name, and click the shield icon so that I'm sure I won't lose the section. With all the camera controllers selected I will press I to insert the key frame on all transformed. Or you can choose to use only rotation and location since there is no scaling influencing the camera frame. From there, I'm testing each controller and see what range of motion I can have with them. For example, this one, I can just move it. I can't rotate it nor scale it. So I will just get rid of all the transform channel but the location transform channels. The camera offset controller can be moved and rotated, but not scaled. So I will get rid of the scaling transform channels. I know that the aim controller can only be moved in space, it can't be rotated nor scaled, and the root controller can be moved and rotated, but the scaling has no (indistinct) so I can get rid of them. You can basically key frame any of the properties of the camera but in the end the only one we are going to use is the focal length. So I'm going to add another key frame onto the focal length. From there I will switch my secondary 3D view to the camera view by pressing zero. From there I will use the main camera controller to move the camera, and the aim controller to target whatever I want to be framed. I advise you to only use those two controllers, that's way enough. And the less controller you will use, the smoother will be your camera motion. But my next advice is to push the passepartout opacity to 100%. This way you won't see what's out of frame and it won't distract you. And what you will have on screen will be what will be outputted whenever you are going to render your animation. From there, animate your camera using the less key frame as possible. First find the right position for the first frame while the camera stays still, then find the position of the camera whenever it's facing the character for the hook motion. From there reach the kicking pose and set the camera and the aim target so that you frame it as you have planned And whenever you are moving the 3D view. Then everything is about smoothing the motion using the graph editor. I must say that I'm not a specialist of camera framing or camera shooting as a gameplay animator so I will keep it as simple as possible. But if you're up to, watch as much anime reference, movie reference, whatever style of animation you like, and try to understand how the camera move. This is the best way to learn. Just watch other animation and try to mimic their camera style. So as explained before, I'm just setting a key frame on those two controllers on the golden poses. I'm slightly traveling toward the bag until frame 25. Then on frame 41, I'm lowering the camera, I'm reducing the focal length to 30 millimeters, and then I make sure that I'm facing the character. Just focus on your current composition, on the current pose, on the current frame. Tweak the target and tweak the camera position until you are happy with what you are framing during the punch and during the anticipation, and then go directly to the kicking pose. In my case, it's going to be frame 74 and from there, I don't care about the camera motion or what it has been doing before. I'm just focusing on framing the character so that I check all the details I wanted to have. I want to read the directionality of the kick. But since my character is watching left, I want to frame him on the right third of my camera. And finally, I want to make sure that I read well his head in the negative space drawn by his leg and arm. From there I will jump on the frame where the bag hit the ground, and I will make sure that I'm framing everything. From there, load the camera in the beginning of your animation. So duplicate the keys on frame zero until frame five or seven. What we don't want is the camera to stop moving as the character hasn't stopped moving. Once you are done make sure that you are easing into the different camera position. Think of the camera as a very heavy object so you can move it fast, but it won't settle into the next pose very quickly. As an example, let's take the X location channel off the camera controller. There is a very fast motion between frame 25 and frame 38, but the camera reaches its final position only on frame 48. So it's easing until frame 48. So basically your graph editor will look like that. You will have a pose, then you will have a next extreme pose. So it could be the motion between the straight punch and the hook. And what I do to make the camera ease is that I will duplicate the extreme movement by 10 frame for example, and then I will move the value of the curve where the camera was supposed to stop towards the previous frame a little bit. This way the camera will continue on moving, but it will slow down until it reaches its final position. This is pretty easy to use illustrate with this cube. When it does only two keys, it slows until its final pose pretty rapidly. But if we modify its curve as we did previously, we do feel like the cube is slowing down as if it was heavier so it looks way more natural. So now that you have your extreme poses for your camera controller, you should do this on each channels. The thing is that once you have created this easing on all your channel, you can perfectly switch back to the action editor and offset the keys if you're not happy with the timing of your motion. But at least you have created this natural feeling. But now to add some extra detail to your camera. Spot the frame where your character is hitting the bag, then select the aim controller of the camera and select the Z location curve. What we'll do is that on each impact on the bag, we will add a slight noise modifier to create a camera shape. To get access to the modifier stack, make sure you have at least one key active, one key you have clicked. From there in the modifiers panel, click add modifier and choose noise. Your whole curve will become a mess. So we need to restrict the frame range of the noise modifier by clicking the checkbox. From there start your noise on that impact frame, the frame 43, and end it five or six frame later. And then make sure that you blend out of the noise over five frame for example. From there, make sure you reduce the strength of the noise modifier or the camera will shake as if a T Rex was entering the stage. The value of 0.1 should be enough. And this is exactly the same setup I've created off camera. Then you can copy the current modifier by clicking this icon. Then you can paste it a couple of time, clicking the icon next to it. Put the next impact on the bag and then set the second noise modifier accordingly. In this case, the kick occur on frame 74 and the noise stop on frame 80. And I have increased the strength to 0.2 since the kick is a more powerful strike. So it makes the camera shake a little more. And then for the third noise modifier, I've set the range around the frame 95, when it hits the ground.

## 08-09-01 Polishing part 01

[Instructor] The time has finally come to start polishing our animation and jump into spline. To make the 3D space as clear as possible, I will just hide the camera rig. From there, we need to switch our interpolation mode from step to bezier. So what I will do is that in the action editor, I will press Control + Tab to switch to the graph editor. Then I will make sure that I display all the curves by enabling the Show Hidden option. And on top of this, I will press Alt + H to make sure that I have no curve or transform channel hidden. From there, we can press Control + Tab again and switch to the action editor. Press A to select all the keys, and then T, and choose Bezier. Then select the punching bag and do the same. Now if we play our animation, it's no longer in step mode. We have interpolation between the keys. And since we've built a very detailed blocking, our animation already looks pretty good. This is why I've been very insistent whenever I was telling you not to jump into spline too early on, because now our work will mostly to improve the animation, rather than fix issues. Before I jump into the graph editor, I will rework a bit of the timing of the animation by moving some of the keys here and there. Since we have the bag that is supposed to be synchronized with the character, it would be better to use the Dope Sheet so that we can move all the keys from the bag and the character at the same time. Again, I will make sure that the Show Hidden option is enabled. And as I want to make sure I won't be moving the keys from our camera rig, I will lock all the channels. And from there, I will make some artistical choices. So it's harder to justify that pure mechanical choice, but I felt like the impact of the hook wasn't that impressive. So maybe I should hold for a couple of additional frames the overshoot of the hook. So from there what we can do is select all the key frames after frame 45, and we can offset to beat those keys whether toward the end of the animation to hold the pose longer. Or if you want to shorten it, get it closer to the beginning of your animation. The other moment in the animation I spot wasn't looking that good at this stage, so it's very rough, it's very floaty, but still, you can feel the animation, is the switch kick. It's the moment where the character stepped back into the switch. I was hesitating whether to make the character jump as soon as he reaches the extreme back, or make him hold the beat down before he make the jump to the switch kick. In the end, I've chosen to make him jump into the switch kick as soon as he hit the down pose. So what I did is that I've selected all the keys. As you can see, I've made a test where I've made his down pose longer, but then I've moved it backward so that he instantly jump into the switch. It's now time to jump into the graph editor. So I've pressed Control + Tab to switch to the graph editor. And as always, I will start by polishing the root of my character. And I always start with its location. You know it's like the bouncing ball, we are not playing with squash and stretch unless we have figured out the position of the ball in space. Now I will press Q to access my quick favorite and calculate the motion path of the current torso controller. And I will be only calculating the motion path from a frame of five to 30 or 25. Because I will stop polishing my animation by chunk, I won't be polishing the root on the whole animation. That will be a nightmare to handle and very odd to track. So what I do is that I select a part of the animation that I feel is clearly defined, in this case, the jab cross motion. And I will work on this part until I feel it's satisfying, and then move to the next one. It doesn't mean that I won't come back to this part later on. But at least I feel like it's more satisfying to polish a part, feel like it looks good, and then jump to the other part, than trying to polish the whole animation at once. Now let's talk about the curve. What I want to do is to bring as much contrast and impact into this animation as possible. I want it to be super snappy. So the idea is to hold a bit longer your character back when he's back. And when he's moving forward, move it in faster and jump into the other shoot. So if we have a look at the edited curve, the Y channel is the back and forth channel of our character, so, basically, the motion that helps him to punch into the bag. As you can see, that from four to eight, the character is slowly moving forward as he's taking his step forward. And then, from eight to 12, he's moving really faster while he's punching, while it was way more linear previously. Then we have a plateau shape between frame 12 and 16. But this is the transition into the cross. So the character is still moving forward, but at a very slow speed. And then there is a big drop forward so that the character move very fast from from 16 to 18 when he's punching with the right cross. Regarding the Z curve, I'm just wanting my character to squat before he pushes. So I further rised the first poses and lowered the Z curve at the beginning. Then as he push, he's raising a bit, but he's not jumping, he's pushing forward. So don't create a too big overshoot. Then he's diving into the right cross. And as he punch, he's going straight. There is a quick dive, then a plateau, then he's recovering. From there, I've been working on the rotation of the root. And I did approach the rotation a bit as I did for the forward momentum, meaning that I've tried to contrast it. I'm starting with the X rotation curve, which allow us to make our character lean forward and backward. So what I did is that I've just made him slightly bend backward, when he was dropping in the beginning, as his torso is dragging. And then, I will make him lean into the punch. So I haven't moved this curve that much, because it wasn't needed from the rocking we have done. The curve I did put more work on was the Z rotation curve, because at this stage, it's allows the character to twist and the power of a punch is all about twisting. In the beginning when the character is moving forward, I've input the new information we didn't have during the blocking, is that I've slightly pushed up the curve so that the torso of the character is opening a bit, and it creates a little anticipation for the left jab that will twist the opposite way a couple of frames later. Then to bring contrast to the animation, what I did is that I created a slight plot. And then we are rapidly transitioning into the opposite twisting during the right cross and there is a very slight overshoot. Instead of our initial stimulus with our curve we have here, I have something that is more contrasted. On there, I'm taking my character from all angle and I work on the other curve just to eliminate any pops or any weird changing the direction. For example, here, the X location of the character is going right, then left, then right. So I'm just stabilizing the character while he's punching with his right cross, his weight is going over the left leg, and that's it. He's no longer bouncing right and left. But once I'm done with my root, I generally work on the feet. That's because the contacting point has a lot of influence on the rest of the body, so I like to time them as soon as possible. I want to make the foot accelerating forward, so easing forward, by scaling the first pose. And I want to get rid of this straight leg pose that doesn't look natural at all, so I will offset the curve by one frame. Then I've converted it to vector because I want the foot to plant on the ground so it does a hard stop. And from there, I will duplicate a couple of key of the Z curve and slightly push it up at the time the foot is traveling. This will create a subtle step, instead of having the foot sliding on the ground. And we can quickly work on the heel controller using the X rotation. As the character move forward, his weight is more on to the left leg. So we can lower a bit the heel, slightly raise it mid-air, and then set it to zero and to vector and just half turn the foot contact with the ground, so that the heel will slam on the ground. Now you can work on the bit of overlapping motion for the toes. Select the main toe controller. Once the leg has left the ground, rotate a bit the toes down as they are dragging toward the previous pose. And as the leg touch the ground, rotate them up a bit. And then, one or two frame later, flatten them on the ground. From there we can work on the right foot. And it doesn't feel natural at all to have the right foot moving at the same time as the front foot as if our character was floating. So we need to offset the motion by at least one frame. This will straighten a bit the back leg so it feels way more natural that the back leg is getting pulled and no longer pushing. It's pushing while throwing the left jab, but then it's getting dragged by the body. Since it's sliding on the ground, we don't have to work on the Z location curve. But one thing that is bothering me is the orientation of the knee. It's a lot pointing on the outside. So I will rework rapidly the position of the knee by changing the position of the pole target and offsetting it mainly using the X location curve. For this specific case, don't focus on the graph editor. Just focus on the shape of the leg and remember that your knee is more or less aligned with your foot. So having the knee pointing to the outside is very weird. I'm just fixing this.

## 08-09-02 Polishing part 02

[Instructor] As our torso controller is now polished or at least improved, we can work on the chest. There is a bit of location variation in the motion of the chest, but the main motion are led by the rotation. So we will work on the rotation, our goal is again, to bring as much contrast as possible to the animation of the character, to better communicate the impact of the punches. As the center of gravity is dropping down, I'm raising a bit the chest, with the X quaternion rotation curve. Pushing the curve a bit down, we'll make the chest to drag while the character is falling. Then as the character push forward, I will make him lean a bit down, pushing the X curve up. Now working on the Z curve, I'm removing a bit of the noise, and I'm twisting the character so that he opens a bit before the jab and then twist his body toward his left arm to input more power into the jab. Then, as we did with the torso root controller, I will open him a bit more when he start twisting to throw the right cross, and as he throw hit, I will accelerate the twisting motion by shortening the spacing on the Z rotation curve meaning that the changes of value on the Z rotation curve will be faster or more brutal. And then we get a slight overshoot as our character has put a lot of energy to the punch so his body continued twisting a bit over a couple of frames. Now, I'm chasing any pops into the rotation curve and see what they are doing, see if they make sense. And as you can see, I'm trying to smooth out a bit the curve. What I mean by that is that I first input the deep contrast into my curve then I watch frame by frame and I check if my character is zigzagging or doing some, weird left to right motion at some point, and I try to get rid of those. But I won't be breaking the main contrast that we have in the Z curve for example. With those few improvement on the curve, we have already changed a lot about the animation and the impact of the punching. From there, I will make a quick pass on the rotation curves of the hips. When it comes to polishing the hips, I generally fix issues more than I'm trying to create posies or push the motion of the hips. For example, here the character is getting down, so his hips should be tilting a bit forward. I'm fixing this, now he's getting more weight onto the right leg here, so using the Y rotation curve, I will slightly make the hips tilting towards the right leg. Then we'll tilt up to the right. Governing the Y rotation curves that drives the tilt to the left and the right. Think of which leg is currently pushing the more onto the hips and favorize the curve toward the current leg. Remember that the hips should not be dragging compared to the feet, because the hips are used to currently drive the legs. The Z rotation curve will allow us to twist the hips. Your key is to keep them aligned with the feet position, and whenever we are punching, we will drag for example, here the right foot using the hips, so there will be a lot of Z rotation, toward the right to pull the right leg. But what we can do now, to input a bit of dragging into the hips and create a more impactful animation, is to use the location curve and slightly delay the position of the hips by pulling them backward in the beginning of the punch, and a couple of frames after the hit, pull them forward so that they will compress with the chest, and it feels like the hips of the character, have a lot of momentum and have a lot of weight, and so they are projected forward during the punch. This is something we've been doing with the head of the squirrel character in chapter three. And once I'm done with the hips, I will do the same with the chest, as the body of the character is moving forward, the chest is slightly pulled backward, compressed toward the hips, and just after the hit, the chest is projected forward, so you can see on frame 17, the curve is pulling down the compression, then it's projected for a couple of frame forward on frame 18 and 19, and then the chest will recover with a slight overshoot, and then the curve will slowly, he's to zero in the rest pose of the chest. This means that the chest has absorbed it's momentum. Remember that your audience is going to see your animation, through the camera view, while we are trying to make our animation looks good from every angle as an exercise, you need to often check your animation for the camera view. And we may input more details into the animation later on, to favorize this camera view. What I wanted to show you here is that you can use the tweaker bone of the chest on the base of the neck and the base of the hips, and calculate their motion path, to see how it looks in the camera view. And here we can see we have two nice arcs, we've an ease in and ease out during the step, and the punch. Another useful trick you can use is to create trackers, so I will add the simple sphere and I will scale it down. Then in the properties panel, we can create a new material. We will call this tracker and we don't need to play with the material properties, but only the viewport visibility setting. And I will give it a yellowish color. Then I will create another bone, I will duplicate the material, give it another color and repeat the process a third time. From there, what we can do is add a constraint to the sphere so that they will copy the location of the chosen bone. With the yellow sphere selected, I will add up to the constraint panel, add it a copy location, then I will source the trident armature, and in the bone section, I will start typing chest, and then search for the chest to tweaker. Now, the sphere has snapped onto the tweaker controller, but we can't see it because it clips with the character. So we can go into the object properties, and in the viewport displays, set it to infant, so that it will be shown over our character. So from there, you can duplicate the sphere, as many times as you want, and change its constraints so that it will snap to the head, for example, and the hips. I will then do the same with the blue and red sphere, and I will snap them onto the elbows, the fist, the feet, and the knees. Whenever you are searching for a bone to target, just search for knee, elbow, and choose wherever you want the .L or .R bone, that mean left or right bone. I advise you to wherever snap to the DEF bone, that means deformation, those are the bones that are currently making our character move, or the tweaker bone, that are pretty low into the hierarchy, so whatever kind of mechanism you are using, like forward kinematic or inverse kinematic, they will always move and follow your character. From there, you can freely scale those trackers that it better fits the shape of your character. Then you can select them all, and in the 3D view, press M, to move them into a new collection. I've created a collection called tracker, and so from there, I can easily hide my character if I want to, and only see those bone moving. This will help you to spot any glitches in your motion, or to have a different view over your animation. I'm not saying this is necessary, but the fact that you have a different view of all your animation, will help you to spot the problem or to focus on the important part, like the arcs of the end on the cross, for example. So let's now get back to our actual characters. Since we are going to unmake the neck and the head, we don't need to see the hops. So I will simply hide them. Our goal is going to add some overlapping motion and dragging to the head, by first playing with the rotation of the neck, and then work with the rotation and location of the head. I've isolated the rotation channel of the neck, and we will start the X rotation, which is the up and down rotation. As the body is going down, the neck is raising a bit. I will hold for a couple of frame, and then as our character is pushing forward, we will transition and make the neck dive a bit forward. Those overlapping motion are going to support the current animation. But since they are further away from the initial rotation point, which is the center of gravity of our character, the curve will be slightly smoother than the center of gravity or the chest. The further away from your region of the rotation you are, the smoother will be your curve, and the smoother will be the overlapping motion. When working on the neck, first work on the X curve as I did so when the character is going down, the neck goes up a bit, and when the character change direction and goes up, the neck drops. But don't exaggerate too much those dragging, or it will feel like your character is unable to hold his own head, and it will look weird. I will now repeat the process with the head. I will start with the X rotational curve, and as the character goes down, I will slightly raise the head, raise the chin of the character. And then when he start to come forward, I will slightly make the head dive into the punch. When pushing the curve down, the head is racing, when pushing the curve up, the head is leaning forward. So when the chest of the character is diving into the punch, I'm raising the head a bit. And once he's coming back, I'm pushing the head forward, rotating toward the ground. Then to tweak the head, tilt and twist, I will switch to the front view. And I will play with the Z rotation curve, and the Y rotation curve. Between frame 10 and 12, you can see I have a big head pop. And since my current head curve are pretty smooth, it means that the problem comes from a controller previous in the chain. So it's currently the torso controller. When you have this kind of problem, just to double check the previous controllers in the chain until you find the ones that is big. So here we can see that on the Z quaternion curve of the torso controller, we have a big change. I will just smooth it a bit, and now it looks better. So from there, I can go back onto the head and make sure that the heads drags a bit whenever it's rotating to the left, to the right up and down. The idea is not to make the head wobbling around, but just give it a slight dragging motion. From there, we can play a bit with the head location. I will only be using the head Y location, and when the body of the character will be moving very rapidly forward, I will slightly push the head inward toward the shoulders. And as the second punch is done, I will pull the head toward the back. The head is projected forward and backward based on its weight and its momentum. And as a micro detail, you can play with the head tweaker bone on the top of the head, and stretch a bit the head when it's pulling back just a touch, and as it stopped, you can squash it a little bit. Those are super subtle smiles, but they will improve a bit your animation. From there, I will double check the animation from the camera view. And then I will fine tweak the rotation of the head. I'm trying to spot the moments where I could be showing both eyes of the character. This will help your audience to connect with the character. So whenever he's throwing or preparing to throw the jab hold the right cross. You can see that by simply pushing a bit down the the Z quartanion curve, I can slightly twist the head toward the camera and you'll see both eyes. That's subtle, that's just a detail, but it may or might do the difference between the good and a great animation.

## 08-09-03 Polishing part 03

[Narrator] So now let's polish the arms and the little details for the first chunk of this animation. But one thing I'd done before publishing the arm is that I've input a bit of details into the toes of the right foot. So I'm not using the graph editor here, I'm just directly posing to camera. When the foot is moving forward, I'm making the toes dragging a bit as if they were sliding on the ground. I will later in the video, revise the rotation, timing of the foot as it rotates toward the pinch a bit too soon. I will offset it by a couple of frames at the very end of the video. I will start by polishing the left arm and I won't be showing you my curves because it's not necessary. What's important is the process. First I've tracked the elbow by calculating the motion path of the elbow tweaker. And now think of what's happening, the character is dropping down, so I want the shoulder to drag a bit. I want the shoulder to raise a bit when the character is fully. So I'm just spotting which channel I can use, which is the extradition channel, and I just raise a bit the curve, so that it raise a bit the shoulder. Then I will do the same with the arm. I want the elbow to raise a bit while the character is going down. And then for the next two frames, I will fix the pose of the arm so that it doesn't cover that much the face anymore. I will push a bit the forearm forward and check out my camera view to make sure that I see the eyes of the character. So while we may rely a lot on the graph editor, for the root motion of the character, because it's super important and it reads well, whenever I'm polishing the arms or the knees or stuff like that, I'm just tracking the arcs on screen. The graph editor does make sense to me, but you don't need to perfectly understand everything about it, to be clever about your choices. So now that I've fixed the few initial pose, I will track the rest of my character, and it feels like it's popping too much. To double check that I will simply select the wrist tweaker and calculate its motion path. So what I will do by working on the different controllers of the arm and not really caring about the graph editor, is to reduce the gap between those two frame, especially the ups and down because it's breaking the flow of the punch. So if we focus on the shoulder of the character between frame 12 and frame 13, there is a big gap of shape. On frame 12 the arm is overextended, and so does the shoulder while it's compressing on frame 13. So I can find some kind of in-between shape on frame 13 by moving a bit the shoulder, moving a bit the arm, moving a bit the forearm and try to flatten a bit the motion path of the fist. Again, I'm not relying on the graph editor to do so. I tweak the pose through graph editor, but also directly in the 3D view. Next, if we follow along the tracking of the wrist, we can see that there is a arch angle here and the fist of the character disappear on the next frame. All of these from the camera view, not in our space. So what we can do to fix this is that we can make the elbow diving little more down. So I will slightly twist the arm so that I get more of an angle with the hand. This way, I will be able later on to create a smear into a C-shape from the camera view. Now in the next pose, I will try to show as much elbow as possible so that the arms read well, and it will also extend the current pose of the character. I'm sure checking my character from all angle, I'm tweaking the pose, but as you can see, I don't work that much directing to the graph editor. I work a lot directly on my character a little later on in the animation, same issue, same solution. Here you can see from frame 19 to frame 22, I have a flat motion path. So it will be better if we add a nice arc. So the point here is not to know what all the curves are doing into this motion, but choose the right curves that will help me to fix this issue. And if I take the arm controller and then just check each rotation channel, I will find one of the curve that I'll need to raise a bit the arm. They found the couple of curve that will all meet to rotate the arm the way I want from the camera view, I can tweak them to create the arcs. I will just regularly update the motion path and you can see in a few seconds, I have fixed my issue, and this is why having a super detailed booking before we switch to spline was really helpful because now we can focus on improving the animation in putting detail and fixing the little arcs. (sound whooshing) As I fix the arcs, I have now a motion path I can full to bard my smears. I will enable the tweaker bone in the UI, and then they will jump to the action editor. And I will make sure that I have a key frame on all those controller on the previous and next frame. Around the current frame, I want to build my smear frame on this way, those tweaker bone won't interpolate, since they are locked before and after the current frame. Again, here, there is no magical trick, I'm just shaping the pose. So I am pushing, pulling the different controllers until it creates a nice arc with the arm. I'm also breaking the wrist and rotating the hand so that it's pointing toward its previous position. Try to keep the current arch in the arm as smooth as possible and focus on what will be seen from the camera view. On the next frame, I will also try to cheat and show a part of the left hand of the character in the camera view. Even if it's only on one frame, the fact that we don't lose track of the hand will help reading the animation. Again here, there is no graph editor involved. From there even if I don't see it from the camera view, I am bulging the smear on the left arm. Maybe I will have to present this specific animation from many angles. Maybe I will have to tweak the position of the camera, both learning wise, and to prevent any rework later on, you should do this also. (sound whooshing) I will speed up a bit the video for the right arm, because in the beginning I'm doing exactly the same thing. As the character drop, I'm raising the shoulder, then from the camera view, I will be tracking first the elbow of the character, and I will try to create a nice arc. Also from camera view, I will try to show as much of the right arm as possible. So I'm slightly offsetting the elbow so that it shows it's not cut or overlapping with the chest of the character. From there, I will calculate the motion path of the hand, and I feel like it's jiggling a bit here. You can see that the path is not clean. I have both a problem of spacing, and my arc is not clearly defined. I will manipulate the shoulder, the arm and the forearm controller until I get it right. And at some point I will also recalculate the arcs of the elbow. Since I'm modifying the position of the arm, I may mess with the position of the elbow, the arc of the elbow, the spacing of the elbow. Once I was done, you can see that I have a clean arc, that is easing into frame 15 before he's throw the punch. From there, I was able to work on the current spline. so when we have switched to spline, the right opened a lot around frame 16, because of the forward kinematic mechanism and both pose wise animation wise and boxing wise, this is not super efficient. And there, instead of using the interpolation of the curve, I've decided to revert the current pose and I've boxing wise exaggerated it using the tweaker bone. They're used to create like a narrow with the arm that will bench into the bag. From there, I reworked each frames of the punch, working on all the controllers of the arm to make sure that the motion path of the punch was as straight as possible, and that the whole shape of the arm was following this motion path. So even the small orientation of the wrist is important at this time. And then when the character is pulling back his arm, the fist is currently falling down and it feels like the arm is heavy for our character. While he's supposed to be super bad bad-ass so it doesn't fit. Instead of having the wrist falling down forward, I reworked the shape of the arm, so that the elbow is leading. So I've made the elbow pointing down, So is that I can raise the wrist as if it was following through or overlapping instead of leading the arm down. Those little details will make the difference because they communicate a different idea. The initial pose of our character make him lose control. He feels weak and I don't like that. We don't want that. He's a bad-ass character, so everything he does, he does it with control. Why the previous animation might be mechanically correct, communication wise it's wrong, because it doesn't communicate what our character is about. And asking yourself this kind of question is not a matter of skill level. You might be struggling with your mechanism or body mechanism, but you should beginner or not always ask yourself those questions. Your animation might not be perfect, but if he does communicate the right information to your audience, then you're doing a better work than having a bad-ass motion, but nothing to say about your character. As explained in the beginning of the video, the right foot was rotating a bit too early, so I just offset its rotation by a couple of frames. But once I was happy with the result, I've made a final pass of details onto this chunk of the animation. (sound whooshing) I did a little pass on the fingers. I was originally planning to have my character with open hands most of the time during this animation, because in Muay Thai, it's more natural to have the hands open, to be able to catch our upend. But I've chosen to close the fists because it will take forever to spline in polish those fingers. But while the educational content would be super imitated, the fingers are some hold the limbs of the hand. So they need to move with pupils. They will help you to define the shape of the hand, and they can also communicate something about your character as seen in the posing hand chapter. What I've done here is that as the hand is going down, I will the finger drug by bending them a bit backward. And just before the fist closed, I have made the ultimate joint to bend backwards so that it feels like the fingers are snapping into a punch more than they are crawling into a punch. It will make the punching even snap here to have the opposite hand to also have a snappy motion.

## 08-09-05 Fixing knee pop

[Instructor] A very common issue when animating with a 3D character rig is what we call knee pop and elbow pop. I won't try to explain why this happened but whenever you are extending the arm or the leg using inverse kinematic, it can happen that the knee accelerate to one full extension. It creates a visual glitch that we will need to fix. The first thing to do is to select the knee tweaker and calculate its motion path. As usual, I'm using my quick favorite, pressing the Q key. Once that we see the trajectory of the knee over time, it's pretty obvious where this pop or this break happens. My technique to fix this is simply to reposition the knee using the knee tweaker along the few frames where it's currently popping. What I advise you is not trying to fix this issue on one frame only, but instead try to smooth the motion path of the knee over several frames. Because if you try to fix it over one frame only, you may push the controller into a weird pose and you will generate a new problem while trying to fix an existing one. As you may have understood already, the method is simply to rebuild the position of the knee using the knee tweaker controller. I first do it from the camera view, but then don't forget to turn around your character and check that the motion path look clean from every angle. We do favourise camera view, but for this exercise, I'd like our animation to be clean from any angle.

## 08-10-01 Polishing hook part 01

We will now start to polish the hook. And, as usual, I will start with the center of gravity of my character using the torso root controller. Our goal during the punching stage is to better sell or communicate what we have blocked out before. We need to bring as much impact into the hook as possible and make sure that all our body mechanics are correct. As our character is recovering from the right cross, there is a weight transfer onto the right foot. I need to move the center of gravity of the character toward the right leg. His weight will be supported onto the right foot, and he will be able to move the left foot toward the next step. So I've lowered the value of the X location curve until frame 31 as the character is making a step with the left foot. And once the left foot is in contact, I can transfer the weight onto the left foot. Now, working with the Z curve, my goal is to create a nice arch that will go down as the weight shifts toward the left leg. And then the character will raise a bit. When we watch the curve, we can clearly see the weight shifting toward the right foot between frame 28 and 13, and then transitioning onto the left foot until frame 38. While the character is traveling to the left, the value of the X location is raising, he's lowering his center of gravity, so the value of the Z curve is going down and stabilize just before this little drop here. This drop in the Z curve over two frames is micro-anticipation. On the timing, my character is easing into the anticipation on frame 42. And then, from frame 42 to frame 45, is releasing the hook. Using this kind of moving hold from frame 32 to frame 42, we have created a long and slow anticipation into the hook. To break this anticipation and bring even more contrast to the hook, I will insert a key frame on frame 40, and then I will push the anticipation pause on frame 42, meaning that I will lower the center of gravity. And I will also rework a bit the Y location curve so that the character is pushing a bit backward. Basically, I am pushing the curves the opposite direction than during the hook motion. This little extra anticipation over one or two frame is called a micro-anticipation and it's used a lot in cartoonish animation or game animation. From there, I will be working on the Y location curve of the center of gravity. Here, I'm slightly pushing the character back so that the left foot is not supporting too much weight and can be raised and pushed forward into the next step. Once it hits its contact point, I can shift the weight onto this current foot. Then I will ease backwards for the moving hold of the anticipation until frame 40. And from frame 40 to 42, I will push the character backward a little faster so that we do create the micro-anticipation we were talking about just before. During the hook motion, I will tweak the curves frame by frame. Whenever we have a very fast motion, we have a lot of changes into the pose of the character. That's pretty common to animate on ones, meaning that you will add a key frame or insert a key frame, every frame, every one frame. In this case, I'm just watching the arcs made by the motion path of the center of gravity of my character and I'm just pushing the different curve so that it creates a nicer arc. I have the pretty squared angle. Here, I'm just curving it into a C shape. From there, I will slightly rework the X location curve so that the character transition into the other shoot a little faster between frame 46 and frame 48. Since we are the very detailed blocking of this parts of the animation, the polishing stage in this case is really about refining the arcs and the speed of the motion over a couple of frames. I will repeat myself again, but the more detailed is your blocking, the easier and faster will be your splining and polishing stage. As usual, once I'm done with the location curve, I switch to the rotation curves. My goal as usual is to bring contrast to the motion so, generally, when you switch to splining, your curve will be smoothed out, which is normal. Your job from there is to favorize whether the previous pose or the next one. Prior to the hook, I will make the body drag. So when the character is going down, I will raise the upper part of the body by pushing the X rotation curve down. And then as you dive into the anticipation for the hook, I will push the curve up. So, basically, I've created a drag and then a slight over shoot, and they will do the same with the twisting motion. As he goes toward the anticipation, I will make the upper body dragging by pushing the Z quaternion curve down. And then, as his weight is shifting upon his left foot and easing through anticipation for the hook, I will push the Z quaternion curve up and they will do the same with the Y quaternion curve. Again, your job is not to know by heart which curve does what, but what the body should do. In this case, I want to drag while I'm switching stance. And once I've reached the new stance, I want to push the anticipation. So I need to figure out which curve does what by just clicking them and watching my character. When I moved the Z quaternion curve, I can see that the torso of my character is twisting, so I will work on that curve for this specific part on the animation. And since I want to put the micro-anticipation as before, between frame 14 and 42, I will slightly erase the Z quaternion curve, which make the character twisting his body. Then we have this huge drop into the curves that generate the twist the opposite direction to perform the hook. What I will do from there is create a slight over shoot by rotating the Z quaternion curve angle down. This way, the torso will continue rotating a bit just after the character hit the bag. This will bring more weight to the motion, while if we were to rotate the body the opposite way, just after the hit, it will make a bounce motion that will be perfect for a light punch or a bouncing ball. Again, since we had a very detailed blocking, pushing those curve is pretty easy and I'm not really modifying their shape, but just choosing whether to push them down or push them up a bit to favorize the previews our next pose. For example, on the X rotation curve here, I'm pushing it down a bit so I'm favorizing the previous pose where the character is leaning into the punch. And then, as he will be walking backward, I will push the curve a little up so that the body is dragging forward.

## 08-10-02 Polishing hook part 02

[Instructor] As in the previous videos, after I polished the torso on the center of gravity of my character, I like to work on the feet. This will help us to figure out how to polish the hips and, later on, the upper chest. As our character is pulling his right leg, I want to slightly raise the foot from the ground. So I will duplicate one of the keys of the Z curve and then slightly push it up. From there, I will move the newly created keys around frame 21 when the foot gets pulled from the ground. Then I will convert the contacting frame. The key to vectors is that we have a hard hit of the foot on the ground. This is generally my go-to when it comes to the Z location curve of the foot when it hits the ground. This will ensure that the food is accelerating before it touch the ground. I'm not saying that you should do this every time your foot is going down, but most of the time, this is true so I generally just switch to vector and then if I have to revise, I revise later on. From there, I will revise a bit the rotation of the foot so that the ankle gets more aligned with the knee and the foot does drag a bit while it is pulled. Basically, I want the foot to lean toward its next pose. From there, I will just slightly tweak the heel motion so that it hits the ground a little harder when the character is shifting his weight on top of the right foot. I will raise it, touch the heel before the hit, and on the hit frame, I will convert the curve to vector. Finally, as an extra detail, I will work a bit on the toes of the right foot. I will simply make them drag by rotating them down while the foot is getting up and rotating them a bit up while the foot is getting down. And then I will slap them on the ground a couple of frames later by switching the handle to vector. From there, remember what I've said during the blocking stage that the feet are always moving while on the ground? As the leg is pulling onto the right foot, I will slightly rotate it toward the hips. As I'm reviewing the leg motion, I can see that there is a little glitch or pop on the knee. Since the leg doesn't get fully extended, this is not a problem due to the rig or to the inverse kinematic mechanisms. So I will just double check my pull target as there must be a very quick change in its position. And this is the case. I have a couple of keys close one to the other, with different position for the pull target. To fix the issue, I will simply get rid of the in-between keys so that Brendan will automatically interpolate from frame 32 to frame 36. And this will smooth the knee motion for free. During the hook, the right foot get pulled but it feels like it's hitting the wall whenever it's getting to its final pose. Has a hard stop and I'd like to smooth this a bit so that I get a bit of feeling as if the foot was sliding on the ground. To do so, I will simply offset the keys from frame 45 to 47 and then I will push the values of the keys on frame 44. This way, the value of the curves on frame 44 and 47 are almost the same, but not the same. This way it will a feel like the foot is stopping, but it will still move a little bit as if it was sliding a bit on the ground. Then I revised the rotation curve to make the food drag toward its previous position. So basically I'm rotating the foot toward its previous position based on the speed. The faster it moves forward, the more it's rotating backwards. And as the leg is pulling the foot, I'm slightly raising the hip. As explained when we were polishing the torso root of our character, we need his weight to be supporting on one leg to be able to easily raise the other leg. And on frame 26, it feels like the weight of the character is centered between the two feet. So I will offset the movement of the left foot by one frame so that the foot start leaving its current position once the weight is more on the right foot. Then I want the foot to move fast in the beginning and then ease into its final position, so I will scale the curve. And then, as we did for the right foot, I will input a new Q frame in between the two position and push a bit the Z location up, so that it feels like the foot is raising before it hits the ground. Then, using the heel controller and the foot rotation controller, I will make sure that the foot opens toward the next position, meaning that I will make it slide onto its inner edge. And after it hits its contact pose, I will make it tilt to the outside so that it flatten on the ground. From there, as we did for the right foot, I will work a bit on the toes to make them drag so whenever the character is moving his leg to his left, the toes will slightly drag to the right. If you are beginning in animation, and this is the first time you do this kind of exercise, note that those details are not that important. They will sure bring some interesting information to your animation, but you should always focus on the broad motion on the center of gravity, the chest, the position of the foot, the position of the hands. Works on those little details only at the very last moment. Basically always work from the root of the motion, in this case, the center gravity, to the tip of the chain, the tip of the feet, the tip of the hands.

## 08-10-03 Polishing hook part 03

[Instructor] With our center of gravity and our feet polished, it's gonna be way he's yours to now polish the hips of the character. To get rid of any visual noise, I will ID arms of the character using the rig UI. So let's expose the hips rotation curve. And keep in mind that the hips can either be pushed by the supporting leg or lead the leg, pulling it. For example, on the section of the animation, as the weight is totally shifting toward the right leg, the hips will raise toward the right leg, because they are pushed by the right leg. And our goal is not to know which curve to use, but to figure it out based on the character motion. The weight is on the right leg, so I need to slightly raise the hips toward the right. I'm testing different curve. The Y rotation curve seems to be the one that will do what I need. And I tweak this curve rig-wise. Most of the motion of the torso of our character is generated by the torso root or center of gravity. So most of the time, once the center of gravity is polished, polishing the hips is mostly smoothing out the curve, so that we don't get harsh angles or distorted torso shape. And then I tend to rotate a little more to chest controller than the hips controller As you can see, I'm pushing and pulling along the way of the curve, so that I get smoother transition from one extreme to the other. On frame 47, I will push down a bit the Z quaternion curve, because it will make the hips to twist a little further into the punch. Since the hips are leading the punch, it's where the energy come from. We do need just after the impact them to slightly overshoot. And then I'm realigning the hips with the rest of the body, so that I don't get a too distorted trunk. This little push on frame 47 will create a slight overshoot, and that will better sell the impact, because we will have a slight glitch into the hips rotation just after he hit the bag. And since the hips are pulling the leg, I will propagate a bit the slight overshoot into the left knee, by playing with the pull target. We can see the pull target shifting after frame 47 to the left, but I will just pull a bit the curve on frame 50 and 52 to create a slight overshoot toward the inside. As the hips rotate, the knee is pulled inside, overshoot a bit, and then get back into its position on frame 58. (air whooshes) Polishing the chest will be mostly about making it drag. A lot of the force in boxing comes from way you deal with your center of gravity, so basically how you move your feet and your hips. Having a strong upper body is really a secondary factor to the power of your punch. This is why we can make it drag it, because this is not the primary force into the punching motion. The twisting of our character chest is led by the Z quaternion curve. So that our character torso root is twisting toward the left, I will make the chest drag by inputting a bit of delay into the Z quaternion curve, meaning that I will offset any extreme pose, and I will push the curve toward its previous value. This is a very easy method that you can use whenever you're trying to achieve a dragging motion, whether it's the finger, a pony tail, or whatever. You just delay the keys of the controller based on their position in the chain. The closer they get to the tip of the chain, the further you will offset the keys, and I will apply this concept to different degrees for the chest. The more strength the character will put into his punch, meaning that he will contract all the muscle of his torso, the tighter will be the dragging. So I may not offset by your key, every pose of the chest, but rather have a rise to previous pose, and then overshoot. For example, here, I will push up the Z quaternion curve on frame 44 and 45, but then I will push it down to create the overshoot. Pushing up the curve create the drags into the twist. Pushing it down create the overshoot and sell more power to the hook. Now you have to be careful not to smooth out the motion too much. A good way to input a bit of texture and impact to the hook is to use the location of the chest. As the character is moving up very fast, I will pull the chest down. I will squash it onto the hips, but then as the character hit the bag, I will slightly pull the chest the back. So I will make it drag a bit. And just after the impact, I will push it forward. So basically you move the chest opposite to the punch, and then you move it toward the punch. It will feels like the chest of the character is bouncing due to the impact of the hook. Don't hesitate to push this pose further away, pushing forward over one frame, and recovering over two or three frames. (air whooshes) From there, polishing the neck and the head is pretty straightforward. I'm using the tweaker bone at the base of the head to calculate the motion path. And from there, I will walk as we did in the previous segment of this animation. We are going to make the neck dragging compound to the chest. Since the neck is following the rotation of the chest controller-wise, the element of work to polish those curve won't be that big, but just for our eyes, it will beat the previous pose by pushing the value of the curve toward its previous value or offsetting in in time by one frame. Then track your arcs. You can see here, I have a very clean arc made by the pace of the head. And since the head comes from the left, I'm tweaking the value of the curve, so that the head move a bit more to the left during this transition move. And then as it hits the next pose, I will make it overshoot a bit, one or two frame, after it hits the extreme pose. Technically, I don't have that much tricks to teach you here, but to watch the motion path and make sure you create as smooth arc as possible. It's exactly the same method as what we did before for the arms. We were tracking the elbows, and then playing with the rotation curve of the upper arm. We were modifying the shape of the motion path. At no point was I focusing on the graph (indistinct), but mostly on the arcs made by the elbow. At this stage, it's tweaking each pose frame by frame, whether you're doing these for the rough editorial or directly in the 3D view port doesn't matter, but your arcs must be super clean. For example, here, as the torso is rotating toward the right, I will rotate the neck to the left, so that it is dragging. And then after the impact, I've pushed the neck to the right, so that I get a nice overshoot and we feel like the head has a lot of weight and momentum. And as I feel up here with the result here, I will do exactly the same thing with the head. Instead of tracking the base of the neck, I may track with the top of the head or the tip of the nose. From there, you will see that it's very, very straightforward. When the head is raising, I will lower the chin a bit. When the head is getting down, I will raise the chin a bit. When the head is turning to the right, I will make the nose drag to the left. So we are repeating the same method over and over along the whole animation. There is just a moment with the specific controller where we are going to break the rules in the way to create more impact. If you remember, when we were watching the reference of Liam Harrison throwing a big hook, there is a lot of rotation in his head during the impact, and this is what I want to reproduce here. And they want to get that into my animation too. But instead of having a recoil in the head, I want to hold during the drag, and then move it away as fast as possible. To do so, I will create a little plateau with the Z quaternion rotation. This way the head is looking at the punch, so it dragging. And on the next frame, I will push the curve way down, so that it rotate the opposite way. And it creates a very impactful rotation of the head just after the punch. From there, I will smooth the curve, so that the character is out of this pose. From there, it was all about adding some extra detail to the animation of the torso. First I've checked the pose of the head from the camera angle. And then using its location, so moving the head in space, I've exaggerated a bit the impact. Then I've used the tweaker controller to add a very slight stretching to the head whenever it's moving super fast in screen on this specific frame,. As for the arm, this will fake the motion blur. Then I will play with the tweaker controller of the torso. I will select them all, and they will insert a key frame on every single frame during the hook This way, I'm sure that those controller won't interpolate from one frame to the other. And from there, I will use those controller for two main reason. First, I want to slightly reshape my character, so that there is not that much breaks in his silhouette, and this way, I offer better support to his line of action, but I will also use them to create a bit of a shaking his body whenever he hit with the hook. On frame 48, I will select the tweaker bone in the middle of the spine between the hips and the chest, and I will push it forward. This is subtle details that will bring a little more impact to the current animation as if the body of the character was projected forward, because of the momentum of the strike.

## 08-10-04 Polishing hook part 04

[Instructor] Time to move on to the arms to finish the polishing of the hook portion of this animation. As explained in the previous video, when it comes to the arm, I don't rely that much on the graph editor, but more on the motion path drawn by the elbow and the wrist of the character. But I will repeat myself here, when it come to the torso routes or the torso in general, using the graph editor is super important because the position curved for the torso route or even defeat absence. But when it comes to the quaternion rotation of the arm, it becomes a little more abstract. I'm not saying here that it doesn't make sense, but since we are mixing orientation and no longer rotation as when using eulers, quaternions behavior is not linear and might change depending on the space you are animating your character. For example, in our case, the arms are not following the rotation of the torso based on the orientation of the character and ward space, the behavior of the quaternion curves of the arm may change. Again, we don't need to know all the technical details of all quaternion behaves. The curve will make sense on portion of your animation and your goal is to get nice arc and nice spacing, so just focus on this. In time I started polishing the right shoulder. Everything here is about tweaking the X and Z rotation curves, avoiding to touch the Y rotation curve that much, even if you can touch it. And make sure that the shoulder are droppings, so whenever the torso is twisting back, the shoulder will be delayed forward. When the torso is going down, the shoulder will raise a bit. And when the torso is going up, the shoulder will lower a bit. Here, I'm working on the rotation of the arm from the camera point of view. Before I do so, I've calculated the motion paths of the wrist. And as you can see, it makes a jagged stroke instead of having a nice C shape curve. I will mix the use of the graph editor, but also directly posing the arm in the 3D view, until I get the smooth arc in the 3D view. I'm mixing the rotation of the arm controller with the forearm controller whenever I need to open a little more the forearm. Regarding the forearm, since it's using euler rotation, the graph editor does make a little more sense. So whenever the elbow is going back, I will bend the arm inward. And as the elbow stop and go back, I will open the arm. The idea is to make the hand drag compared to the elbow. And after a few additional tweak, even if I don't get a perfect result, I get a way better arc, and it will drastically improve my animation. Another thing that I have taken care of and we might not see in this recalled, is that the right arm is no longer crossing the eyes of the character when getting back in front of the head. It's still crossing the head, but they've kept the arm from being awkwardly did by the right arm. Regarding the arm tweaking, you can see that here, I'm executing exactly the same thing as before. I'm polishing the arc so that it looks a little better. So I'm tweaking the position of the arm until I get a smoother arc. From there, I will switch back to the camera view and work a bit on the forearm during the stroke of the hook. The idea is to make sure that the current pose is blending as well as possible with the next pose. So, I need to lead a bit the motion of the arm with the elbow by raising it. And from there, I will start to use the tweaker bone of the arms to slightly curve the arm into the next shape. It's like I'm starting to blurred the smear, but just to touch. The arm is starting to work, but it's still have some kind of natural shape. From there, I've been tweaking all the controllers one by one to create the recoil of the right arm just after the hook hit the bag. Just after the hook hits the back, the right shoulder is projected back. And then, when we've one frame of delay, so does the elbow. All these secondary movement will happen upon four to five frame. To keep it as clean as possible, I will do as usual. I will start with the base of the chain and then go further along. So, I will start with the shoulder and a couple of frame after the punch contact with the bag, I will push the shoulder backward. And then two or three frames later, the shoulder will get back to some kind of normal position. From there, I can work on the right arm controller. And to other point of reference, I will track the right elbow. For the time being, the right elbow draws a pretty nice arc, but what I want to try to do, is to reduce the spacing between those different key frames. If from the camera view I'm able to group those different point in space into a single point or making them very close one to the other, it will feel like the elbow is pin in place. And it will increase the sensation of popping of the elbow. This is typically the kind of thing we want to avoid whenever we are animating, to a have bunch of keys gather one on top of the other, but in this case, I want to have this pop on screen so that it brings more impact. Another little detail we can't see here, is that both arm are overlapping one on the other, so it will make the silhouette of the character a little odder to rip. So upon the one frame, I will just spread a bit the arms, so that they separate better. At least on one frame. It's now time to work on the left arm, and on the first frame until the hook, I didn't do that much. I did find two examples, is I did move a bit the curve here and there are to try different timing, but in the end, I stick to what I add already from the broken stage. So, let's jump a little further to the current hook. To be able to track the alchemy by the shoulder, I've used the tweaker bones that is attached on the route of the arm. Note that the camera shake can be a bit disturbing to be able to properly follow the arc of the shoulder. A little reminder, you can temporarily disable a modifier by simply selecting the bones at all the modifier, and click on the little wrench icon. This will mute all the modifier assign to the current transformed channel, and make the current frame a little easier to read. Click the wrench icon again to re-enable all the modifiers. So back into my 3D scene, I will select the tweaker bone and calculate its arc. So, I really want it to push the shoulder as fast possible just after the fist hit the bag. And I'm working the pose from camera view. This is some things that will really need to be read from the camera angle. Then you can turn around your character to make sure that it doesn't goes too crazy. And right after this overshoot, I'm pulling the shoulder back so that we do feel that the bag is resisting. This will create super odd angle in the motion path, just up to a frame 47, then it will bounce back on frame 49 before recovering on frame 52. So, I have an overshoot over one frame, then a bounce over two frame, and then a recover over three frames. This will create a nice shoulder bounce that will better sell the impact again of the hook. From there, we can start working on the arm controller. So as usual, we need to track the elbow and see if we get clean arcs. One thing that struck me here is that the elbow is traveling faster than the shoulder on this specific part of the animation. So, I do need to make the elbow or the arm controller to drag. In the graph editor, it means that I will push my curve toward the previous value. And if I feel like I can't reach the pose I want using the curve, I can simply pose by hand. From there, I will be tracking the hand controller. You can also track the elbow as same before. And here, what I want to do is try to avoid the hand to overlap on the eyes of my character. This is something to consider exclusively from the camera view, since this is what your audience is going to see. Once I fixed this little issue, everything will be about getting a nice arc and respecting the hierarchy. So in this case, making the hand drag a bit compared to the elbow. At some point, creating this dragging effect became pretty subtle. It's just about rotating a bit the hand toward its previous position. Then I'm checking the arcs made around frame 40. The keys are grouping a bit in the camera view and that's okay, but I will see if I can refine a bit the arc using the forearm controller. That's okay to have grouped points here in space, but if you can make a smoother arc, that's always a little improvement of your animation. The keys here are bunched up because we are into moving hold and we don't want the forearm to overshoot because our character is getting very contracted. So it's controlling its arm. Its arm is not lose, be very cautious we've overshoot. When I was a younger animator, I tend to put them everywhere. So it looks fun and cool, but at some point it doesn't really translate everything in your animation correctly. In certain case, you want hard stop in your emotion or sharp angled arcs as we did for the shoulder overshoot, just after the impact. Here, on this mirror frame, I'm scaling a bit the tweaker bones to get a better silhouette of the arm. On the next frame, I will elongate a bit the forearm using the tweaker bones. I will also stretch the hand. This has a couple of benefits. First, we better see the left eye of the character. Second, it increased speed feeling. So, I'm stretching the fast moving part exactly as we did with the bouncing ball in the very first chapters. Now, from there, let's get to be creative. Instead of simply punching the bag, we will squash the arm against the bag. And I want to create some kind of shockwave effect within the forearm. If you watch carefully these frame by frame, you can see the elbow getting bigger. And then this big shape traveling through the forearm until it reaches the fist. A bit as in the old school cartoon, when a character was swallowing something, or when someone was shooting with a big cannon. Again, here, there is no magical trick. I'm just sculpting the arm of the character frame by frame. There is no magical graph editor shenanigans to get to this kind of result. So as we did before, I will select all the tweaker bone and I will insert the key frame on all the frame of the specific section of the animation. This way we are sure that there won't be any interpolation of those controller if we forget to reset their transformed channels. From there, frame by frame, I will start by scaling the elbow area, then the middle of the forearm. And finally, the fist. Another thing I will do during this stage, is to make sure that the wrist doesn't move that much in space, as if the fist was hitting a wall. And we will be able to see this on the motion path of the wrist controller. As keys will be bunched toward the area of the punch. In this section, the camera shake is a bit distracting. So what I will do is that I will exit pose mode with our character. I will end eyed to dolly camera rig, I will select the aim controller that hold the noise modifier, and I will click the wrench icon to disable the modifier. This way it's a little more comfortable to double check my animation from the camera view. From there, I can use the wrist tweaker bone and stabilize the position of the fist in the camera view space. If needed, we can also tweak a bit the position of the arm. The idea is to influence the tip of the chain, which is our fist, actually. From there, I spent most of the time trying to clean the arm and fist trajectory so that I have no glitches into my arcs or into the motion path. Especially when the character was pulling his fist back because we have been sculpting the poses during the punch frame by frame so there is no surprise. But we haven't checked the next step in this animation, which is when the character is pulling his arm back. So here, I'm making sure that the elbow leads the motion backwards. So the elbow drops first and then the fist follow. I will recalculate the motion paths from the wrist tweaker controller. And here, I want to get rid of the zigzag in the motion path. It will create a little visual glitch while the fist of our character is slowing down as he's pulling it. It's not a fast action. So as explain before, when we have a very fast action, it's okay to have harsh angles into our arcs, but here, it doesn't look really good. Exit, I will be manipulating both the forearm controller and the arm controller to make sure that I don't mess with the elbow. I have calculated the motion path of the elbow, but also of the wrist. And look at the arcs, all I'm slowly smoothing them. As soon as I will be done with polishing those arcs, I will be able to jump in the very last segment of the animation, which is the switch and the kick. For the time being, I will let you with a time-lapse of the full process for the hook polishing. And I will see you in the next video.

## 08-11-01 Polishing kick part 01

[Instructor] We are hitting the final part of our polishing stage, where we are going to polish the kick. At this stage, you should already have guessed that we are going to start with the torso route controller of our character. The first thing that might be a bit disturbing is that since our character has rotated in space during the hook, the side to side motion of his center of gravity is no longer driven by the X location, but the Y location curve. This is because our torso controller is aligned with world space. So as our character is rotated by more or less 90 degrees, its local left to right motion is now aligned with the world space forward and backward motion. As usual, you don't need to think about all of this. The important thing is just to test the curve, see how your character behave and start from there. As we did before, I'm moving the center of gravity of the character based on the steps it's taking. I'm pushing the center of gravity on the left leg, whenever the character is freeing his right foot to be able to pull it back. And then we have this micro anticipation before the jump into the switch. The weight of the character is shifting upon the right leg. And we are holding don't pose for a couple of frames. Then as our character is jumping, the value of the Z curve is raising pretty fast. And since our character has no more contact with the ground, I'm making the Y curve almost linear because our character is not able to apply any forces to accelerate on its X or Y axis while in the air. When your character is airborn, The only axis that gets a lot of variation is the Z axis, the up and down. As the lens, the reason micro anticipation, so a little down pose over fret 74. From there, I will give a quick polish to the X location curve of our character. Remember that the feet travels faster than the center of gravity. So when the character is stepping back, I will hold his center of gravity upon the left foot until the right foot reaches its contact pose. And then the center of gravity travels toward the right foot and as I did before with the Y location curve, during the jump, I will make the curve more linear by simply removing the unnecessary keys. Once I got the satisfying arc for the jump of the character, I will try to push him back and down as far as possible to contrast with the position whenever it's kicking. From there, I didn't have that much work regarding the kick itself because it was already polished a lot during the blocking stage, since we have animate it on once. So from there, I will be mainly working on the step back of the character. And as usual, I will make sure that the center of gravity of my character is aligned with the contacting foot and that the weight shifts upon the new contacting foot as soon as the current foot contact the ground. So first the foot contact the ground then the center of gravity shift toward the foot and to be able to move the food, the character need to raise his center of gravity. So the center of gravity will both shift to what the supporting leg and raise while the opposite foot is moving to its next contact pose. And as it reaches its next contact pose, the center of gravity start to get down and toward this new contact pose. Very common mistake is to move the center of gravity in sync with the foot. As explained before, the center of gravity and the feet don't move at the same speed because at some point the center of gravity needs to be supported by the foot and at some point the center of gravity needs to free the foot so that it can move. So just try to keep this in mind, this mechanism where the center of gravity will shift towards the available foot, the ones that doesn't move anymore. When it comes to rotation, as soon as the character is pulling back, I am making the torso drag in a bit so that I will rotate it toward its previous position. When the character is moving back, I will make him slightly leaning forward. Compared to what has been outputted from the detailed blocking, I'm not touching the curve that much. It's mostly about revising a bit, the timing of the rotation of the character, then reworking his current poses. And you can notice that I generally have a very smooth curve with some plateau whenever the character is moving his foot. And then the little acceleration of twist as soon as the foot has reached its contact pose as for the X and Y location, whenever the character is jumping, he will have a hard time to create any variation in its rotation speed while airborn. To be able to accelerate or decelerate, you need to apply forces. And if your body is not in contact with a surface, you can't push to create this force. This is why my curves get small linear on during the jump. From there, I will walk on the rotation as I did on the location. I will try to push the extreme of the anticipation as far as possible so that I get a very strong contrast compared to the kick release. So I'm leaning the character back and twisting toward its left leg and then I will twist the body toward the right leg and lean the character into the kick. Then when the character is coming back into idle, I'm mainly tweaking and smoothing the existing curve, making sure that the body is dragging as the foot reaches its contact pose, and then the body catch up. Exactly as we did for the location. As usual, I will provide you a slow paced time-lapse so that you can watch it almost real time. Note that entire of the animation, I've given me like five or six additional frame, just to ease into the idle, instead of having art stop, I will deal with almost all the controller this way, creating some kind of moving old until the last frame. He will be easing into his final post and that should look right.

## 08-11-02 Polishing kick part 02

[Instructor] As usual, once I'm done with polishing the torso or the center of gravity, I work on the contact points of the character. So I will work on the feet as always. I will start with the right leg as it's going to be pretty fast. First of all, I want to make sure that the leg gets fully extended before the foot leave the ground. So I will simply delay by a couple of frame the moment the foot leave the ground. From there, I will make sure that the foot is drawing a nice arc in space, and then I will slightly push the z location curve to create the up pose of the foot right in the middle. I will then switch the handles to vector for the starting point and ending point of the z location and x location. This way I make sure that the foot is accelerating when leaving the ground and when it's about to contact the ground. Then I can revise the heel orientation or heel rotation using the heel controller, raising the heel just before the foot leave the ground and flattening the foot a couple of frame after the contact pose. Then I'm also working on the toes of the character. So as usual, I will make them drag, meaning that they will be pointing toward their previous position. On the contact pose, I will raise the toes and then I will slap them on the ground one frame later. And I will convert the contacting key of the toes to vector so that I'm sure that they are accelerating before they hit the ground, even if it's over only one frame. Then I will work on the jumping motion. So I will make sure that the foot leave the ground late enough so that I get an extended leg. And as I move the foot, I will also work on its quaternion rotation to make it drag. So the ball of the foot will be pointing toward its previous position, and then while in the air, I will make it transition toward its next position, toward the contacting pose. I will slightly open the foot just before the impact so that the character land on the edge of the foot, and it slightly pivot while the weight is shifting onto the foot. Then I will work on the kicking motion of this current foot, the foot that is contacting the ground. It has a specific rotation, as we have see in the reference. It twist to follow the hips and then just after the impact, it twist backward very fast. So we have this very fast back and forth motion of the heel toward the target. In this case, it's driven by the W quaternion rotation for my foot, and I'm creating this V shape with the curve where when it's going down, it rotates toward the target, and after frame 81, it rotates back. To make this motion less linear, I will hold the pose for a couple of frames by adding a new key on frame 80 and 81. And then I will make the foot ease into its rest pose, just before the left foot enter contact with the ground. Once I'm done with this, I will work on the last step backward with the same checkpoint in mind as before. I want to make sure that the leg extend a bit before the foot leave the ground. And that the foot contact the ground before the weight of the character starts to shift toward the current foot. So as usual, I'm often delaying the moment where the foot is leaving the ground. In this case, by two frames. And then I switch the contacting pose to vector so that I get a hard contact. And I input a bit of up pose in between using the z location to make the foot raise in space. From there, as usual, I will refine a bit the heel controller to make sure that the heel is raising whenever the foot is getting pulled, and that it's at it highest point just before the contact frame. Then I will switch to the foot rotation and see if I can make it drag a little bit. And as I did before, I want the foot to rotate a bit after the contact as the weight of the character is shifting upon this foot. And also, contact first with the inner edge of the foot, and then the foot will tilt to become flat. This create a slight roll on the ground of the foot that looks more natural than the foot getting flattened directly on the ground as it contacts. As the final detail, as usual, I will work on the toes. Whenever the foot is leaving the ground, I will make the toes drag and eventually, when it contacts the ground, I will raise them a bit so that they slap the frame after the contact. Another detail I wanted to add is the friction of the toes on the ground when the character is twisting to throw the kick. If you flatten your hand on the table and you push on the hand and try to twist it, you will see your fingers dragging in the opposite direction as the twist because of the friction and the resistance on the ground, or on the table. So this is what I'm doing here using the z Euler rotation. I rotate them toward their previous position. It's the same principle as when we lift the foot but in this case, the motion is side to side instead of being up and down. From there, I've worked on the left foot. At this point, the workflow is pretty linear. I hope you understand what I've been doing before and if not, you should rewatch the videos. I know how confusing it can be to read the graph editor, especially for beginners where you are not comfortable with the tools. So talking about poses, rhythm and spacing might not translate for you watching those curve. If it's the case, jump back to the squirrel chapter and make sure that you practice with this character. During the switch, I'm mainly reworking the up pose so that it's smallest in the middle of the motion of the foot toward its new position. And as you can see, I deal with the z curve a bit like with the bouncing ball with vector handles when the foot is leaving the ground and hitting the ground and a scale key in between. Now, as you have guessed, most of the work was during the kicking, first, make sure that you calculate your motion path. The first choice I did was to make the foot to stay on the ground as long as possible. This way we do get the feeling that the hips is pulling the leg as strong as possible. But also, it will all need to get less frames to throw the kick so that it will be very fast, and very snappy. So as the foot is leaving the ground, I make sure that it's very close to its initial pose so that I will have a big spacing between the starting frame and the contacting frame. We will have a big acceleration, so for the in between, I'm favorizing the first position, so that the spacing get bigger and bigger and we do feel the acceleration of the foot before the contact pose. Once I feel good with this, I will make sure that my arcs are clean, especially on the impact frame. I will slightly tweak the position of the foot from the camera view so that it perfectly wrap around the punching bag, creating a nice arc. Since the punching bag is an accessory, I will pose the bag later on, paste on the foot motion. But it's not hard for me to create a nice arc from the camera view, considering that the punching bag will be more or less there since we have blocked everything before. Then when the leg is pulled back, I will make sure that I get a very clean arc and that the foot is accelerating toward the ground. Beyond being bound to your graph editor, you should be more watching and analyzing your motion path. This is the tool that perfectly translate to you the arcs and the spacing of your animation. Then with experience, you will be able to read this also into your graph editor. As usual, from there, I will work on the heel controller. That's pretty straightforward. As the foot is leaving the ground, I'm raising the heel. The only tricky thing is that our character just jumped into the anticipation for the kick. So the heel is going down and then he's pushing to throw the kick. So the heel is raising. There is this slight plateau at some point. From there it's all about building the smear frames. Don't hesitate to work with all the controllers, like the toe controller, for example, to make the foot longer as it's getting pulled from the ground. The trajectory of the knee will also be crucial, so it's very important to track the arc of the knee and from there, build the shape of the leg. Just think of the leg as a whip. You want to create a nice curly shape with the whole leg that is going toward the kicking position. Make sure that the foot orientation, make it drags toward its previous position. And take advantage again of all the controllers. There are tweaker on the top of the toes, so do not hesitate to make those toes dragging. At this stage, it's not about animating but really sculpting your pose. There are only three frames of your character. They must be perfect. One tip to get this muscle shape is to hide the heel of the character from the camera point of view. You can easily do this by using the ankle tweaker instead of trying to rotate the foot. I'm trying my best to get a smooth shape for the leg. There are limitation due to the anatomy of the character but also the resolution of his mesh and the number of controllers in the rig. On the frame, just after the contact with the bag, I will scale on one axis the sheen and the foot so that it feels like they are squashing on the bag. It's like creating an explosion. You start with a thin shape and then you make it very big. And this visual pop will bring more impact to your animation. And this is exactly what we want for the kick. When it's done over one frame like that, it's barely viewable or noticeable but it will feel for sure. For this kind of shape, I don't really have any rules to tell you or to explain you. What I do advise you is to search for references, like in anime, for example, where they do deform a lot the character to get crazy perspective or crazy impactful shapes like that. You will also find this kind of crazy shape in kids cartoon. I think that's a very, very interesting source of inspiration whenever it comes to stylized animation because I guess that as the target are kids, we consider that they are more fantasy or more imagination than adults. And so they would react positively to crazy shapes. But in the end, if you input it in your animation and it's subtle enough, it will work for any public or any audience. For the last step of this polishing stage on the left leg, there is nothing we haven't seen already or we haven't talked about while working on the other foot. So now we need to polish the hips, the chest, neck, head and then the arms of the character.

## 08-11-03 Polishing kick part 03

[Instructor] Now that the torso root of our character and the feet are polished, we can start polishing the whole chain of the torso, the hips, the chest, neck and head. As usual, I will start with the hips rotation. And as explained in the previous animation chunk, I'm mainly following the motion of the feet to figure out the rotation of the hips. Also since we add a very detailed blocking, generally the stage is pretty fast as we mostly have to smooth out the motion of the hips based on what is already blocked. For example, here I'm slightly reducing the tilting of the hips so that they are more facing the character and facing the orientation of the center of gravity, because this is the transition motion and our character is settling just after the hook. Then I'm reworking the step back. So I make sure that the character hips don't tilt too much and it looks too feminine. I'm also making sure that the hips twist follow the right leg. But remember that the hips are pulling the legs that are not in contact with the ground while the supporting leg are pushing on the hips. This should gives you a broad idea on how to tilt the hips. The character is pushing for the jump, I make sure that the bit is oriented backward. The hips are oriented forward towards the groin during the anticipation and oriented backward toward the bit during the pushing pose. Then I will fix the overall orientation of the hips during the jump as they look delayed here. Whenever I'm working on the hips, it's often a matter of feeling whether the pose looks right or not, that's pretty hard to explain. Hopefully when you're watching this video, you can see the improvement whenever I'm moving a key over the different rotation axis. One part that definitely needed some refinement is the kicking part. As I have initially blocked a very odd recoil of the hips and it generates a very odd visual glitch. You can see the difference of rotation between frame 79 and frame 80. There is a big jump in the value of the Z quaternion curve. And so what I've decided is to average the value over frame 80 and switch on frame 81. Having this big change of value over two frames instead of one really improved the animation in the end. From there, here you can see the hips are really twisted backward, pulling the left leg. And then it was just about tweaking the existing curve as we had no extreme motion, making sure that the hips tilt up upon the supporting leg, making sure that the twisting follows the foot that was in error whenever the character is stepping back. The chest was a little more interesting to work on. Not that it is more important than the hips, but visually it creates more variation in the shape of the character. And during this polishing stage, I will be able to push even more the pose of the anticipation of the kick and the kick itself. On the initial part of this chunk, just after the hook, I'm tracking the axis from the base of the neck, and I will mainly make the chest drag based on the center of gravity motion. So whenever the center of gravity is moving up, I will slightly lean the character forward. Whenever the center of gravity is twisting to the right, I will slightly twist the chest to the left so that there is a bit of delay in the chest motion compared to the center of gravity and the leading hips. Even when the character is initiating the jump, we keep the same mechanism. If the body is going up, I will slightly lean the character forward. But then when the character is airborne and about to land just before throwing the kick, the character starts to use his chest for the anticipation to load energy. So I will make sure that it twists as far as possible, the opposite direction than the kick release, as if the shoulder were going to pull the hips forward. So from the camera view, I just make sure that I push the line of faction as far as possible, tilting the chest to the right and bending the character backward as far as possible. Then the whole chest will be moving toward the kick as if the character was trying to give a headbutt to another bag that is side to side with the current bag. So in the end, if you watch my current curve, it's pretty noisy. There is a lot of ups and downs. And at the end of the polishing stage of this very part, you will see that I have a way smoother curve. And it does show in the arc of the base of the neck, which is pretty nice. Then I will break a bit the smoothness of the X rotation curve around frame 82 to create the recoil effect after the kick. But while the character was really leaning into the kick now that he has lost momentum, he needed to get straighter to find balance. And once I've recovered this balance during these short transitions between frame 82 and 85, it's just about making the chest drag a bit while the character is taking a few step backwards. Then to improve the animation, what I did is that I've modified the location of the chest during the kick. The idea was to create some chest shake while the character was hitting the bag. So I will be pushing the chest forward just after the impact on frame 79 and a couple of frame later, I will pull the chest backward until it recovers around frame 85. This will create a quick back and forth motion as if the torso was shaking because of the impact of the kick. This is pretty similar to what we did to the shoulders and the head of the character during the hook motion. (swooshing) Once I'm done with the chest, I always go further in the chain. So I will be working on the neck as we did for the previous animation chunk. As usual, I will be mostly making the head drag. Since the neck is a tride of the chest, quaternion rotation behavior is pretty close to euler rotation behavior. So from the side view, I will be working on the X rotation channel. I will make sure to track my axis using the base of the neck. And then when the character is going down, I will slightly raise the neck. And when the character is pushing up, I will make sure that the neck is going down. This is something we have already done during the blocking stage. So here I'm just revising some of the poses that may not be clean. Like this little drop on the y-axis that doesn't make sense since the character is moving pretty linearly to the side. Polishing the neck is mostly about the X and Y rotation curve as they drive the tilting and leaning of the head. While my wheel is to make the head drag, the polishing stage is also the opportunity to fix some of the poses. And my go-to for this is to watch my character and make sure that the head doesn't feel too uncomfortable. I'm just watching the relationship between the chest and the neck. And whenever the pose feels uncomfortable, I fix it. (swooshing) Regarding the head, I haven't anything to add that we haven't covered already. For all the transition between the punches, the steps or any motion that is not that fast, I will make the head slightly dragging as we did before. I will jump directly to the kicking moment. And at this stage of the animation, my goal is not to make the head drag that much because the character is focusing on the target, and it might not be as relaxed as in between the different punches. Your goal here is to make sure that the character is watching the target from the camera angle, or at least that we feel like he's watching the target. So, I'm orientating the head so that it's looking at the same point during the whole kick. Once I'm done with the rotation, I will play with the location of the head to improve the impact of the kick. First, I track the head tweaker on the top of the head. And my goal is to clean the arc from the camera view, for example, on frame 78, you can see that the arc is going a bit down and then going up. So I will raise the head so that I get a cleaner arc, and then after impact I will push the head forward. And after I've pushed the head forward, because of the momentum of the kicks that just stop so the head is continuing to travel forward. I will try to bunch a bit the different keys here, this way just after the kick contact, the head will stabilize a bit from the camera view and we will be able to see it clearly. And it will improve the recoil feeling of the kick. Finally, I will add a bit of stretching in the head when it's moving down super fast using the top head tweaker, only working on the Z location axis of the head tweaker. And just after the stretch, I will squash it a little bit a couple of frames later before it settles again two frames later.

## 08-11-04 Polishing kick part 04

[Instructor] We are slowly but surely making it to the end of the polishing stage of our character with the arm polishing. At this stage of the course, what I'm doing should not have any secret for you. As usual, I will whether track the hand of the character or the elbow of the character. And as it's a forward kinematic chain, I will start by polishing the shoulder, the root of the forward kinematic chain. And as we did before several time now, I will make the shoulder drag, especially on those movement where the character is pretty relaxed. What I mean here is that you have to spot whether the shoulder are used to drive the motion or not. Whenever our character is walking or taking a few step back and forward, he's not choosing the moment of his arms to pull himself forward or back. Generally speaking, the shoulder will always drag compared to the chest. But if you remember well, during the run cycle, the shoulder were used to pull the character up and forward. So they were reaching their extreme before the center of gravity of the character. What I want to point out here is that the shoulder will most of the time be dragging but don't be too systematic with the way you deal with the dragging because there are some case, like the kicking of our character where you want the shoulder to reach their extreme a little earlier as they will participate in the momentum of the center of gravity, and the current kick. They are not leading for say, but they are participating to the leading force. In the meantime, as you can see, I've been tracking the elbow of my character and I'm doing my best to get rid of any harsh angle drawn by the elbow of the character whether by using the graph editor or by directly posing the character in the 3D viewport. My workflow hasn't changed since the beginning of this animation. I'm focusing on the motion path, rather than the graph editor. My goal when the character is pulling the arm back is to make the forearm and the hand move a bit like a serpent, while the elbow of the character is the head of the serpent and the fist is the tip of the tail. This is the kind of motion that I love, and I generally push them very far. In this case, I've kept it pretty simple and not too smooth as our character is contracted. Once I got this chunk of the animation polished, I've worked on the kicking move. I've started by adding a little more bounce into the shoulder by dropping it whenever the character was jumping, and then pushing it further up whenever the character was going down. And then during the kicking motion and the hit, I've pushed the contrast of the curve. Whenever the curve is going up, I will push it a little further, and whenever it's going down, I will lower it a little more. This will increase the swinging range of the whole arm, and better communicates the power of the kick. So you can clearly see me processing the z Euler rotation on the shoulder that drives its swinging motion. Then when the character was falling back and stepping back into idle, it was just a matter of making the shoulder drag. So going a little up when the center of gravity's going down and when the center of gravity is going up, lower a bit the shoulder. And once I'm done with the shoulder, as usual, I will work with the arm controller. As usual, I will start by calculating the motion path of the elbow and then tweak the arm controller during the swinging motion. Generally speaking, on this part of the animation, the motion of the elbow was a bit messy and popping all around. So my goal was pretty clear. I wanted the elbow to rapidly reach its back position, ease into the extreme, and then go back. Once I have this space, I jump into camera view and I make sure that the arm is getting out of the silhouette of the character. It's not overlapping with the chest of the character. So I can achieve this result by slightly pushing the x rotation curve up. From there, the fist is the part that is going to show the most from the camera view. So I will calculate the motion path from the tip of the fist using the end tweak controller. From there, we can see that from frame 80 to 82, the arm is going forward way too fast. I wanted it to ease backward and now it's going forward as if it was bouncing against a wall. And on top of this, the motion path is drawing some kind of V shape that doesn't look like a nice arc. So by repositioning a bit the arm controller and working a bit on the z rotation curve on the forearm, I will be able to fix this. So whenever I'm working on such a tight animation or motion, meaning that it occurs upon a very few frame, I adjusted the curve and often update the motion path. And I'm not focusing on the character but mostly on the arcs drawn by the tip of his fist. In the end, I get a nice arc with an ease-out forward. So with experience, you will be better at creating nice poses, and then sculpting those animation arcs. And this is fundamental to create a nice animation fast. From there, I've been reworking the whole arm during the steps back of the character. But since this is something we have seen multiple time before, I won't be commenting it anymore. Once the motion of the arm is polished, you can work on your smears. At this stage, what mostly matter is what we are going to see in the camera view. Even if I'm rotating around my character to get a better angle to pose those tweak, I always come back to the camera view to double check the pose. Your goal in this case is to make sure that the current silhouette of your character support the arcs. When building those smears, don't think of the arm as a current arm but rather think of it as a whip or a rubber limb. Here I'm adding a little detail by breaking the elbow joint and slightly bending the arm backward whenever it reaches its extreme back during the swing. While having fun building those smears, don't forget to track your arcs because since you're modifying your tweaker bones, their motion path will change. So make sure that your spacing is still relevant. Regarding the right arm polish, there is not that much to say. As usual, I will make the shoulder drag. Then I will work on the arm controller, making sure I have nice arcs from the elbows. Then work on the forearm, making sure that I have nice arcs to the wrist. While you are mainly focusing on those arcs in the spacing, don't forget that if you can clear the silhouette of your character, that's always better. Like for example, avoiding the end to overlap with the thigh or make sure that your negative space allows you to perfectly read the arm. With all these little details taken care of, I will call this animation done. As any form of art, animation is never done but you have to call your work finished and move on. I personally do think that it's better to get not too far into polishing and finish your piece than spending hundred of hours trying to polish your animation, getting disgusted or bored about it and not publish it. The best animation will sure bring attention on your work, and in our world, it's better to get noticeable, than the best. So always try to push your animation as far possible but make sure that you finish what you have started. And hopefully you will never be 100% satisfied of what you have done. So that there is always room for improvement and that you will do better on the next animation. So I would advise to set yourself some milestone or deadlines, and this is exactly what I did for this animation where I need to publish the course and I can't work forever on it. So it's not as good as I would like but I do believe it's good enough to show my workflow, and I'm really proud of this animation. Even if I see some part that could be improved. Finally, I'd like to add that animation is fun and you should keep it fun. Sometime it's painful because it's a lot of work but if you take pleasure doing what you do, you will progress very fast. And if you have the chance to make it your job, you will be among the few that enjoy their jobs. And this is sure a life changer and the key to success. So I wish you a lot of success and I will see you in the next video.

## 08-12-01-Polishing the bag

[Instructor] Regarding the bag, more than polishing stage, it's going to be an animation stage. While the blocking did help to get an idea of what we were going to do and what would be the behavior of the bag during the animation, since the main controller animation or motion is pretty simple, it's almost easier to work directly in the graph editor for this kind of motion. And then we will rework the different tweaker bones or even erase all the key frames and rebuild their motion. Since the bag has a pendulum motion with an extreme low and an extreme high, it's useless to have more than three key frames. One for the beginning, one for the extreme, and one for the return. So at this stage, I'm getting rid of any useless key frames I did during the blocking stage. From there, I can start working on the X rotation axis, which is the main rotation axis of our bag in the beginning. In the beginning, it's pretty close to what we were doing with the character. I have two contact frames with the fist. After the first punch, the bag starts to move a bit. Then, during the second punch, I'm keeping the bag a bit backward to make sure that the fist penetrates the bag. Don't over-focus on this part though because this is something I'm going to change later on. But this gives me the starting point for the first pendulum motion of the bag. And once you have that, you just need your starting point and where the bag will end before the next punch. And we just need one key in between, so I will get rid of everything but those two keys. Then, we just need to convert the start and end key to vector, and then work on the scaling of the handles of the extreme key exactly as we will do with the up and down motion of a bouncing ball. From there, you need to watch several times your motion. See if it feels right, and then edit any of your keys. Maybe scale a bit up or down some of the handles to accelerate or decelerate the bag whenever it's going down or up. Here, you can see the final shape of my X rotation curve on the first bounce. Regarding the X and Y rotation curve, during the first swing, there is not that too much to do than getting rid of any keys that could be in between. And set the handles of the starting and ending keys to vector so that we have no interpolation. I haven't done it on the Y rotation. That's a mistake, but it's not even noticeable in the animation. On there, I need to redefine the moment where the bag will start to move. It's currently one frame earlier that what I have right now, and since I want to hold the pose for the first impact of the hook, I will simply duplicate the keys from 45 onto frame 47. This will create a plateau where the bag is no longer moving, and I can get rid of the keys after this one. Here, we've just defined the starting point of the pendulum motion of the bag after the hook. Now, I will go on the next contact frame on frame 78, and I will refine the position of the bag so that it perfectly matches the shin of the character. I've now defined the starting point and the end point of this next pendulum motion. So, I can get rid of all the key frames in between and rework its motion. From there, I will rebuild some kind of the same curve we had with the bouncing ball or the previous pendulum motion. I will select the Z rotation rotation curve that is going to be the main rotation channel for this specific bounce. I will duplicate the key. I put it right in the middle and switch it to auto clamp. Then, I will make sure that the starting and ending keys are set to vector. From there, I have my base motion for the second bounce. From there, I definitely need some more love. I will refine the position of the hitting frame. From there, I will bring a little more contrast into the shape of the Z curve as you can see on the reference. This way, the bag will be pushed faster and will come back faster, which will look more impactful. And from there, I've worked a bit on the X rotation curve so that the motion of the bag was currently physically correct because in its current state, the bag has a weird motion from frame 60, where it starts to rotate to the left while there is absolutely no force that would generate this rotation. So just after the punch, I will put a bit of a right rotation, and then the bag will swing back to the left. Polishing the motion of the bag just after the kick was a bit closer to what we did during the polishing of the character. As I'm making the bag holding a bit onto the character's shin, and then it starts to swing very fast. Once the bag is projected after frame 80 'til frame 85 where it gets out of the camera range, its motion is pretty close to what we already had with initial keys set to vector and then a big acceleration. From there, since I want the bag to land flat on the ground, I just got rid of all the keys on the X and Y rotation axis. Then, start working on the root controller of the punching bag. And again, here it is gonna be super simple compared to what we have done before. So, the first thing is that I can get rid of all the key frames before the root starts to move. Then, I will get rid of any key frames between the starting and landing pose. Then, I will have refine the location of the bag once it hits the ground based on the camera frame. And from there, I will convert all the keys to vector because why? Well, one, there won't be any change in the speed of the bag on your recent channel. So on the X and Y location channels exactly as for the bouncing ball. A few frames after the hit, I will slightly offset the value of the Y location curve so that it feels like the bag is sliding a bit on the ground. I've done the same with the X location curve, and I will convert both keys to auto clamped. Then, I just need to scale those two keys to create a heavy feeling as the friction of the bag on the ground slowing down. Now, the only curve that needs to be worked on is the Z location curve, and as you can see, it's going to be super simple. Now, the only thing I'd like to improve is as for the character, the silhouette of the bag. As it currently lands on the ground, we just see the top part of the bag. And if we were only keeping this still frame, we wouldn't be able to identify a punching bag. So, basically this is a bad pose. First thing I will do is use the master rotation controller to make sure that the bag is flat on the ground. From there, we get back onto the root controller of the bag, and I will use its Z rotation axis to rotate it a bit to the side. Since the bag is airborne, its rotation will be linear. And then just after the impact, I've pushed a little bit the rotation further, and I've made it ease. This is to simulate the friction of the bag on the ground and the fact that it's slowing down. The bag is rapidly stabilizing on the ground, and I haven't added any bounce so that it feels very heavy.

## 08-12-02 Bag Final details-1

Once the bag rotation master controller and the root were done, I've locked their transformed channels so that I was sure I would not edit them by mistake. From there, I will select all the other controller and get rid of all the keys but the very first one. Since the bag deformations are very fast, it's easier for me to rework them from scratch then trying to work from what we have blocked before. Whenever I want to create a pose, I will make sure that the previous key frame is currently keyed. This way, I'm sure to avoid any undesired interpolations, On frame 12, I will kind of sculpt the bag as it receive the first jab by pushing the tweaker controller. And then a couple of frames later, I will just console all the transforms so that the bag recovers its shape. Then a frame later, I will pull a bit the controller that was hit by the punch so that we get a very subtle shake feeling. Then I will repeat the process for the next punch. I will key the controller on frame 16, the frame prior to the hit or impact. Then on frame 17, I will sculpt the bag by pushing the tweaker bone, but also scaling them on one axis and then scaling them down on the opposite taxis. I'm trying to preserve the volume of the bag. From there, four frames later, I will console all the transform, and then I will refine the shape of the bag frame-by-frame. Since the the hitting frames are pretty short, it's a very fast process. Rebuilding the whole animation for the whole bag took me about half an hour. Then, I started over again with the hook, Sculpting the pose from scratch using the tweaker bones. As soon as I was done with the hook, guess what I did. Exactly the same thing with the kick. I've exclusively started working on those deformation frames using the tweaker bones. That's pretty important because they are very easy to use, and to sculpt those specific impacts. Then I start working using the blue controllers. Those are the forward kinematic controls that will also us to slightly bend the bag. We could spend hours in the graffiti tool polishing those controllers, but instead I've kept the process as simple as possible, keying as less frames as possible and letting blender interpolate between those frames. So I'm selecting all the controllers from the one, just upon the impact frame, toward the tip of the bag. Then make sure that you are using individual origin, so is that we will be able to bend all the controller at once. And just bend the bag toward its previous position, as if it was dragging as less as possible. If you bend it too much, it won't look realistic because it will look too smooth. From there, if you don't jump into the graffiti tool, that's gonna be hard to make it look good. As soon as I reached the next impact frame, I'm keying the frame before the impact, and then I'm slightly increasing the curvature of the bag on the impact. Then, when the hook is about to happen, this is the time where the bag is traveling the fastest, so I will slightly bend it toward, again, it's previous position. And this is all you create this subtle dragging, almost for free. The trick is to make sure that you manipulate all the bone in the chain at the same time. Since they have a parent and child relationship, you rotate the parent, that makes the child rotating too, and then you apply on top of this a bit of rotation on the child, et cetera, et cetera. It generates a slight bend in the bags that looks very natural. The only moment where I had to be a little more creative was on the kick, where I posed the bones frame by frame. On the frame prior to the kick, I've just made the whole bag dragging. And then, on the impact, I first made the top part of the bag to rotate the right, behind the leg of the character while the lower part of the bag will be dragging. So I will invert it's rotation and rotate it a bit backwards. Since the bag is arriving very fast and we kicking it the opposite direction, there is a lot of deformation in the bag. Then, as it is projected by the kick, I will slightly bend it backward toward its previous position to make it drag a bit. Finally, as as it hits the ground, I bend it toward its previous direction so is that it is dragging again. And then I will console the rotation a couple of frame after and convert all the landing keys and the keys after to vectors so that I have a hard slap on the ground. One final touch I've added is that I've used the tweaker control root to squash the bag on the ground. In the end, it's barely noticeable, because I've kept it very subtle. I selected all the tweaker bone, inserted a key frame on the key prior to squash the bag so that I don't get any weird interpolation, then I've scaled them up a bit on the X and Y axis, and flatten it, scaling it down on the Z axis. Then two or three frame later, I've consoled any scale by pressing alt+S. One final detail I have revised, but I'm not sure I've captured it, is the rotation of the bag just after the right cross. I've slightly lowered the level of rotation of the bag so that it stays on screen while we are rotating around the character. This is typically the kind of detail I wouldn't have taken care of a year ago, for example, but it's very important because it does improve the readability of your animation. This is typically the kind of detail that will bring you to a professional level of animation, because it shows that you care for your audience, and make sure that they will get everything about your animation.

## 08-13Using shapekeys for stylised animation

[Instructor] In this video, I will show you how we can use shapekey to be creative with our animation and generate additional effect on top of it. I will publish a free tutorial on YouTube on how to create the effects of the current final animation, but you will find the link in the documentation. Shapekeys allow you to deform an object into another shape. They are also known as morph target or blendshapes in Maya or ZBrush, for example. Shapekeys are often used to create facial expression for your character that can be triggered later on. It's great to create advanced facial expression or quick test for your character. Then the rigger can create controllers so that you can trigger those shapekeys at will in your animation. (air whooshing) shapekeys are a modification or a transformation of the mesh, so you will be able to find the shapekeys panel into the mesh data of your object. To create a shapekey, we simply need to click the plus icon on the right of the panel. The first shapekey to be created will be automatically named basis. It's some kind of snapshot of the current position of each vertices in your mesh. Whenever we jump into edit mode with a vertex selected, in the properties panel we can see the current location of this vertex. The basis shapekey will record the position of each vertex for our mesh, and this specific basis shapekey is going to be the point of reference for the next shapekey. It's a bit like the rest pose for a character rig. From there, we can create another shapekey by clicking the plus button. And now render is no longer naming the shapekey basis, but key number one. Now, to be able to animate this shapekey, we need to create a first deformation. You need to be in edit mode, and the most important thing is to make sure that the key is currently selected. To select it, you just need to left click it and it will be highlighted. From there, I can move one of the vertices of my mesh. You can move as many vertices as you want. And as soon as I will press tap to exit edit mode, my mesh will return to the shape it had on the basis shapekey. From there, I can activate my shapekey by simply increasing the value of key number one from zero to one. Blender will automatically interpolate the shapekey; one being the shapekey we have currently built, zero being the basis. To understand how shapekeys work, I will create a new shapekey, then I will enter edit mode, and I will rotate my whole character. Note that you can rename your shapekeys as any other data in Blender by simply double-clicking its name. As we have rotated our object in edit mode by triggering the shapekey, I'm expecting it to rotate in space, exactly as I'm doing here in object mode. I'm going back onto my model, and I will trigger the shapekey. What's going on here is that it seems that my object is getting scaled while I'm triggering the shapekey, but this is not the case. This is currently how shapekeys work, and to better understand it, I've tracked one of the vertices, parenting a small sphere to this vertex. If you carefully focus on this vertex, you will see that it moves in a straight line in space, and this is because a vertex only have location coordinates, and Blender will simply move each vertices in a straight line from their original basis position toward the key frame position over the key frame values that goes from zero to one, so you can't perform a proper rotation using shapekey. You can only perform translation of individual vertices. So even if the final output looks a bit like a rotation, this is not a rotation. Each vertex is moving in a linear fashion from its current basis position to the shapekey position. (air whooshing) Now, to better understand shapekeys extrapolation and their behavior, I have created this arrow shape, and I will create the basis shapekey and a first key. From there, I will jump into edit mode, and, with my shapekey number one selected, I will move by one Blender unit the top vertices of the arrow. Now, when I trigger my shapekey, those vertices will move in a linear fashion by one Blender unit on the Z-axis. But since the shapekey occurs at the mesh data level, I can rotate my data container, my object, and trigger the shapekey. and the shapekey will behave as expected. Now, if we have a closer look to our shapekey's information, we have a minimum range and a maximum range. This will allow us to either clamp or increase the interpolation range of the shapekey. If I count the maximum value to 0.5, I won't be able to go further. If I now allow a maximum value of two, the vertices of the arrow's head will move two times further away in a linear fashion. If I allow a negative minimum range, I will be able to extrapolate the current shapekey backward or negatively, and the vertices will just move the opposite direction. You can combine as many shapekeys as you want, and this is how we generally create complex facial expression. I have created a couple of additional shapekeys, and now I can trigger all the shapekeys at the same time or combine different values. The coordinate modification of each vertices will be added one on top of each other, based on the factor of each shapekey. If you need to edit your mesh, make sure that you have selected the basis shapekey, or you will be editing the current shapekey, not the basis. We can use vertex group to limit the influence of a shapekey. In the vertex group panel, I will create a new group, and I will assign at 100% the tip of the arrow, and with a value of 50%, the base of the arrow. Now, if I assign this vertex group to the first shapekey by selecting it in the vertex group slot, and I now trigger the shapekey, you can see that the tip of the arrow is moving at its full range, while the other vertices only move by 50% of their range. If I now select one of the vertex and I exclude it by removing it from the vertex group, it will no longer move. The vertex group value directly influence the amount of the shapekey motions that will be applied to each vertex. Finally, you can use other shapekeys as a basis. This way you can create complex transformation by changing the point of reference. (air whooshing) So let's now have a look on what we could do with those shapekeys onto our current animation. I will hide the background and effects collection, so that we have a clearer viewport, and I will directly select my character object. But since the character was linked into this scene, I can't modify any of the mesh data. To be able to edit those data, I need to make the mesh local, and also the object of the character local. With both the container and its data local, I can now add a new shapekey. Since we will directly be editing our character model, I can hide the rig, and I will scrub through the animation, and I will try to spot the moment where the character is moving very fast, like this hook motion, for example, I've already created smears using the rig, but now I can add extra details using shapekeys. Clicking the plus button, I will add a new shapekey. I will call it hook zero one, and I will jump into edit mode, pressing the tab key. To be able to see your character posed in edit mode, make sure to enable all the display option in the armature modifier. From there, with my shapekey selected, I can start editing my character. The process is simply to pull some of the vertices of the character toward its previous position, as if part of his mesh was dragging during this quick motion. I need to disable the X symmetry while in edit mode, and now I can pull some of the vertices back, and start to create my effect. The important thing is that those effect will be seen from the camera view, so it's important to make them work from the camera view. You can sure edit your mesh from any point of view you want, but make sure that it does look good from your camera point of view as it is what is going to be rendered. If you want to create broader shapes or move multiple vertices at once, you can enable the editing fall off. Once you are done with your first shapekey, you can exit edit mode, and trigger it by changing its value. As seen in chapter two, shapekeys, as most Blender data, can be keyed by pressing I over the keyframe value. Then I can edit this value whenever I want over my animation. This will activate or deactivate the current shapekey, or, if you change the value over multiple frames, Blender will interpolate the value of the shapekeys. For example, in the previous frame, I can add a bit of the shapekey to initiate this transformation and set it to zero on the previous key. Once you're happy with your first effect, you can add more of them. When working on a shot like that, that this is going to be the final touch, the final effect. So I advise you to create multiple shapekeys. For example, here, I want to add few details on the arm too. I will create a dedicated shapekey instead of adding it on the same shapekey as before. This way, it's gonna be easier for me to edit whether the shapekey of the arm or the head delay one compared to the other, or simply remove it without destroying what I've done for the head. Or you will also be able to show different version to your art director, for example. In my case, I've also created a shapekey during the kick impact to try to blend with the previous shape. This kind of effect on top of the smear effect will fake motion blur, and will help your audience to better read your animation. And, as explained in the previous video, whatever you do to improve the readability of your animation will take it to the next level. (bag slamming) (man grunting)

## Realt time sword trail in blender

Hi, everyone. In this video, I will show you how to create a real time animated sword trail in blender. Creating this effect is a very simple process that we will learn through two main steps. First, the creation of the texture and shader, and then the rigging and animation of the trail. Only the sword motion needs to be animated and we'll generate the trail affixed based on this motion. Let's get started. Creating the trail mesh will be super easy. I already have my sword object, and I will simply add a plane. I will rotate it towards front view and apply the rotation and scale pressing control A. I will then move it in object mode so that it matches more or less my sword shape. Then in edit mode, I will make it slightly taller so that it covers the blade. I advise you to make it slightly taller than the blade because a part of it will be masked. The cool thing is that by default, when you add the plane in blender, it's already unwrapped. So we are done creating our UVs. In edit mode, I will press control R to create two loop kits. I think going above is a bit overkill, so two loop cut is way enough to get a small trail. And the cool thing is that the UVs are updated. Then we need to create a new material, and since I wanted to be transparent in the material setting, I will switch it to alpha blend. I don't want it to emit any shadow, so then I will switch the shadow mode to none, and we will keep the back face cooling disabled, because if you enable it, then the shader will show only on one side. We can go to the next step and create our first mask. I'm working with blender 292, but I guess 2.9 will walk the same. In my 3D view port I've pressed control tab, and I will switch to texture paint mode. In the texture slot I will add a new base color texture and set it to black. I will keep it at 1 K resolution. I will then go into the image editor and switch to paint. In the lowest part of the painting tool panels, I will open the tiling option and enable X and Y. Then I can open my texture library and select the sword train based color. With the tiling option, I can now paint seamless textures. You may have to experiment a bit, but the method to paint the flame is very simple. I start by painting random, broad shapes with the standard brush, using pressure sensitivity for both the radius and the strength. Don't try to paint any flame shape yet, just paint slightly curved or reasonable lines. Then using the finger tool, just push a bit the black into the white and the white into the black. So the trick here to get a good result is just to change the size of your brush often pressing the F key. This is a pretty simple process, but if you fail at first, just restart again. This is the first time I'm using this method, and it took me two trials to get to a good result. Keep it loose, you don't need to add a lot of detail because this is going to be moving so we won't see it clearly. I will save it sword trail mask zero one. From there, let's open the shader editor. We can get rid of the principle BSDF. And with my texture selected, I will press control T to create a texture setup using the node wrangler addon. As explained in the beginning, we will create a transparent material, so we need a mixed shader to mix a transparent shader and an emission shader. We will plug the transparent shader in the first slot and the emission shader in the second slot. Make sure you are using the UV as coordinate, and control shift to click the texture. We can see our fire mask texture. If you don't see it, make sure you are in loop dev shading mode. Let's plug our texture into the mixed shader as a factor and control shift to click the mixed shader. Now, I like to add a bit of distortion into my flame texture. You can revise the tiling and size of the pattern using the scale input. Don't choose the Z scale because the UVs are two dimensional. To create the distortion, we will simply add a noise texture. If we control shift to clique the mapping node, you will be able to see the UV coordinates. It's a simple gradient mixing red and green color. The green is the y-axis, the red is the x-axis. Since our plane is rotated, they might not be aligned with word space, but we don't care. The only thing we have to care is that our noise texture is also made of color, so if we mix those two together, the red and green color of our noise will influence the coordinates of the flame. So here, the distortion is kind of overkill, but as I reduced the factor, I will get less distortion. The scale of the noise is also pretty important. We want to have a broad noise, so a scale of two is way enough. And if we now play with the X location of our flame texture, it will kind of flow on the plane. So you have the base principle on all. We will create the effect. I can now regroup my notes and move on to the second texture. And don't worry if you don't get every single node we are creating, at the end of the video, I will show you the full node setup. You can make a screenshot and reproduce it at your site. I will use the same process to create the second mask. In the 3D view, press control tab, to switch to texture paint mode, go into the texture slot, press the plus icon, and create a new texture, same size as before and still with a black background. The idea is to mask the edges of our plane. We don't need to input as much detail as on the first mask, we just need a big, round gradient that will influence the opacity of our flame. Just make sure that the outer edges are pure black. When you are done use a very large brush with a very low strength to paint the tip of the flame. It will lower it's opacity and we will have nice and smooth gradients. I will create exactly the same note setup as for the first texture. The only difference is that I will keep the scale at one, because we don't want this mask to tile. Then I've used a couple of layout to reroute items to make my shader editor a little cleaner. Then we can use a colored mix, RGB node to mix both of our mask and set the blend mode to multiply. I will push the mixing value to one, and we don't care if you plug the first texture in the first slot or the second. After that, we will add a couple of new nodes, the convertor color ramp to be able to play with the contrast of our texture. We will use it to drive the color of our emission shader, and I will push the emission shader to 10, then in the render option, I will enable the bloom option. Then I will add the convertor map range before the color ramp, this will allow us to fine tweak our gradient if needed. Then we can edit the gradient of our color ramp from black and white to a cool looking fire tone. So now instead of animating both location of both mapping node, I like to use only one value. So I will use a converter combined XYZ, and then I will add an input value node. If I plugged this input value node in the X value of the combined XYZ, then it's like moving the X value directly into the mapping node. But then I can duplicate this combined XYZ, add math node in between, set this math node to multiply so that when I move my first value, it will modify both X location of both mapping node, but not with the same rate, this way we will have a difference of speed for both noises tiling, and it will look a little more random and natural than if we add both noise running at the same speed. Now to animate our fire texture, we just need to add a key frame on our tiling value. Hovering upon the value I will press the I key. With our key frame created and our tiling node selected, I will open the graph editor, move the key frame created on frame zero by pressing GNX, and I will duplicate this frame by pressing shift D and move it on frame 10, this way I have two key frames for the tagging value. I will switch the handle to vector by pressing the V key, and now I have a linear interpolation between those two keys. When I move the second key down, I can see my tiling texture moving the right way. So I will push it down a bit, then select both key and press shift E and select linear extrapolation. Now our curve will be extrapolated and we can play our animation infinitely. Our animated fire shader is now done. In the UV editor, you can push and pull a bit the middle loop cuts from left to right, to get a bit more distortion or acceleration and deceleration of the flames. You can also improve the distortion pattern, switching the noise texture from 3D to 4D. It will add a new input to the noise texture node called W which is an evolution over time. So you can then use the distortion value node that we have animated. Use the Mac node to change its value and plug it in between. Let's now create our rig. It will be super simple. I will snap the cursor to my sword, I will press shift A and add an armature. I will give everything a relevant name, and then I will switch the object to display, to be wireframe so that it will be easier to manipulate. Then they will go back into object mode, select our plane, select the first vertex and snap the cursor to it. I will go back into edit mode on my armature and add a new bone. I will scale it up just for visual purpose, it doesn't matter if you scale the bone, you don't need to scale it. We will then duplicate this bone free time and snap it to each loop cut we have created on the mesh, so you can enable the snapping mode and switch to vertices. When I'm done as usual, I will give each bone a proper name. The first bone on the line will be the trail route. Back in object mode, I've selected the sword, then the armature, I will switch to pause mode and press control P to parent the sword to the sword bone, this way no need to do any vertex painting, the sword is parented to this bone, then in edit mode on the armature, I will parent the trailer route to the sword bone. Then I will switch back to object mode, select my trailer mesh, then the armature, press control P and use with empty groups. It does created a bone group for each bone on our trail mesh and going into edit mode, we can assign each vertex group row of each loop cut to the corresponding bone. Once done, each bone will be moving one edge of our plane, and you have just finished the rig, so it's very simple. Now to make it easier to read, what I will do is that I will reduce the size of each bone. Reducing the size of each bone in edit mode won't affect any of the deformation we just created, and it will make them easier to identify. We can then add a subdivision modifier to our mesh and move it upon the armature modifier. And instead of using the cat wheel clock interpolation for the subdivision modifier, we will use the simple subdivision method so that you can then apply the subdivision modifier and export your mesh if you want to in any game engine. By placing the subdivision modify first, we will get a smooth deformation, and if you want, you can apply the subdivision modifier, and your mesh is ready to be exported to a game engine, but I advise you to keep the subdivision modifier without applying it, because there are option to apply it during the export. For the demonstration, I will switch the bone display to be bone, and that will scale them so that it's easier to select them and identify them. Again, this has no influence on the deformation or on the rig functionalities. So now we are done for this step of the rigging, we just need to animate the sword. So I've hidden the trail effects, I've hidden all the bone but the sword bone, and I've made a rapid animation of the sword. Time to see our little trick that will generate the trail effect. The process is super simple, once you've finished your animation, select the trail route bone, then trade one, press control shift to see and add a copy transformation, and do it for each bone. It will collapse the trail since every bone will be one on top of each other, so the vertices of our trail will be one on top of each other. So nothing will happen when we play the animation. But the trick is to bake the animation and offset it in time. So we'll select the free constraint bone, press F3, search for bake and choose bake action. We will select only selected visual king clear constraint and overwrite current action. Boom! All the bones have lost their constraint, but now we can move them. But now I will select all the key frames of the bone, but the first key frame, and I will offset them by one frame. G ID is two offset trail one by one frame, trail two by two frame and trail three by three frame. And we keep the first frame to avoid any popping. Now, each bone is playing the same animation, but with a bit of delay compared to the blade motion. And voila, we got our effect. But when the blade is rotating backward, we get a strange distortion. To fix this issue, we just need to select our trail mesh and under the armature modifier, use preserve volume. Then if you want to fine tweak the trail size, you can switch from auto snap to no auto snap in the key frames snapping menu. Now you can move your key frame as smooth as you want, or with the interval you want and make the trail shorter, bigger, whatever you want. And if you need to create another effect, just create a new animation, create the copy transformed, constraint, peg the animation, and offset it, and you're done. There other ways to create this kind of effect in unity, but this method is totally relevant and reliable, and you can preview it or use it directly in blender. So that's very cool to have your preview in blender and the same thing in your game engine. This is the end of the video, but before we wrap up, a bit of self promotion.

## StYlised smears with shapekeys in Blender 3D

(character grunting) (bag banging) Hi, everyone. Pierrick from P2design. In this video, I will show you how you can use shape shape keys to create stylized effect on your animated character in Blender. (logo whooshing) (lively music) This video is a free sample of one of the 150 videos that are going to be included in my new course, Alive! This Blender animation course is gonna be available on next week, the 13th of August. Stay tuned and check the link in the description below. In this video, I will show you in detail how to create shape keys and how to apply them to your animated character. Let's get started. Shape keys allows you to deform an object into another shape. They are also known as morph target or Blendshapes in Maya or ZBrush, for example. Shape keys are often used to create facial expression for your character that can be triggered later on. It's great to create advanced facial expression or quick test for your character. Then the rigger can create controllers so that you can trigger those shape keys at will in your animation. (screen whooshing) Shape keys are a modification or a transformation of the mesh. So you will be able to find the Shape Keys panel into the mesh data of your object. To create a shape key, we simply need to click the plus icon on the right of the panel. The first shape key to be created will be automatically named basis. It's some kind of snapshot of the current position of each vertices in your mesh. Whenever we jump into edit mode with a vertex selected, in the properties panel, we can see the current location of this vertex. The basis shape key will record the position of each vertex for our mesh. And this specific basis shape key is going to be the point of reference for the next shape key. It's a bit like the rest pose for a character rig. From there, we can create another shape key by clicking the plus button, and now render is no longer naming the shape key basis but key number one. Now, to be able to animate this shape key, we need to create a first deformation. You need to be in edit mode and the most important thing is to make sure that the key is currently selected. To select it, you just need to left click it and it will be highlighted. From there, I can move one of the vertices of my mesh. You can move as many vertices as you want. And as soon as I will press Tab to exit edit mode, my mesh will return to the shape it had on the basis shape key. From there, I can activate my shape key by simply increasing the value of key number one from zero to one. Blender will automatically interpolate the shape key. One being the shape key we have currently built, zero being the basis. To understand how shape keys work, I will create a new shape key. Then I will enter edit mode and I will rotate my whole character. Note that you can rename your shape keys as any other data in Blender by simply double clicking its name. As we have rotated our object in edit mode by triggering the shape key, I'm expecting it to rotate in space, exactly as I'm doing here in object mode. I'm going back onto my model, and I will trigger the shape key. What we learn here is that it seems that my object is getting scaled while I'm triggering the shape key. But this is not the case. This is currently how shape keys work. And to better understand it, I've tracked one of the vertices, parenting a small sphere to this vertex. If you carefully focus on this vertex, you will see that it moves in a straight line in space. And this is because a vertex only have location coordinates, and Blender will simply move each vertices in a straight line from their original basis position toward the keyframe position over the keyframe value that goes from zero to one. So you can't perform a proper rotation using shape key. You can only perform translation of individual vertices. So even if the final output looks a bit like a rotation, this is not a rotation. Each vertex is moving in a linear fashion from its current basis position to the shape key position. Now, to better understand shape keys extrapolation and their behavior, I have created this arrow shape and I will create the basis shape key, and a first key. From there, I will jump into edit mode, and with my shape key number one selected, I will move by one Blender unit the top vertices of the arrow. Now, when I trigger my shape key, those vertices will move in a linear fashion by one Blender unit on the z-axis. But since the shape key occurs at the mesh data level, I can rotate my data container, my object and trigger the shape key, and the shape key will behave as expected. Now, if we have a closer look to our shape key's information, we have a minimum range and a maximum range. This will allow us to whether clamp or increase the interpolation range of the shape key. If I clomp the maximum value to 0.5, I won't be able to go further. If I now allow a maximum value of two, the vertices of the arrow's head will move two time further away in a linear fashion. If I allow a negative minimum range, I will be able to extrapolate the current shape key backward or negatively, and the vertices will just move the opposite direction. You can combine as many shape keys as you want, and this is how we generally create complex facial expression. I have created a couple of additional shape keys, and now I can trigger all the shape keys at the same time or combine different values. The coordinate modification of each vertices will be added one on top of each other based on the factor of each shape key. If you need to edit your mesh, make sure that you have selected the basis shape key or you will be editing the current shape key, not the basis. We can use vertex group to limit the influence of a shape key. In the vertex group panel, I will create a new group, and I will assign at 100% the tip of the arrow, and with a value of 50%, the pace of the arrow. Now, if I assign this vertex group to the first shape key by selecting it in the vertex group slot, and I now trigger the shape key, you can see that the tip of the arrow is moving at its full range, while the other vertices only move by 50% of their range. If I now select one of the vertex and I exclude it by removing it from the vertex group, it will no longer move. The vertex group value directly influence the almond of the shape key motion that will be applied to each vertex. Finally, you can use other shape keys as a basis. This way, you can create complex transformation by changing the point of reference. So let's now have a look on what we could do with those shape keys onto our current animation. I will hide the background and affixes collection so that we have a clearer viewport. And I will directly select my character object. But since the character was linked into this scene, I can't modify any of the mesh data. To be able to edit those data, I need to make the mesh local and also the object of the character local. With both the container and its data local, I can now add a new shape key. Since we will directly be editing our character model, I can hide the rig, and I will scrub through the animation, and I will try to spot the moment where the character is moving very fast, like this hook motion, for example. I've already created smears using the rig but now I can add extra details using shape keys. Clicking the plus button, I will add a new shape key. I will call it Hook01 and I will jump into edit mode, pressing the Tab key. To be able to see your character posed in edit mode, make sure to enable all the display option in the armature modifier. From there, with my shape key selected, I can start editing my character. The process is simply to pull some of the vertices of the character towards its previous position as if part of his mesh was dragging during this quick motion. I need to disable the x symmetry while in edit mode, and now I can pull some of the vertices back, and start to create my effect. The important thing is that those effects will be seen from the camera view. So it's important to make them work from the camera view. You can sure edit your mesh from any point of view you want, but make sure that it does look good from your camera point of view as it is what is going to be rendered. If you want to create broader shapes or move multiple vertices at once, you can enable the editing falloff. Once you are done with your first shape key, you can exit edit mode and trigger it by changing its value. As seen in chapter two, shape keys, as most Blender data, can be keyed by pressing i over the keyframe value. Then I can edit this value whenever I want over my animation. This will activate or deactivate the current shape key or if you change the value over multiple frames, Blender will interpolate the value of the shape keys. For example, in the previous frame, I can add a bit of the shape key to initiate this transformation and set it to zero on the previous key. Once you're happy with your first effect, you can add more of them. When working on a shot like that, this is going to be the final touch, the final effect. So I advise you to create multiple shape keys. For example, here I want to add a few details on the arm too. I will create a dedicated shape key instead of adding it on the same shape key as before. This way, it's gonna be easier for me to edit whether the shape key of the arm or the head delay one compared to the other or simply remove it without destroying what I've done for the head. Or you will also be able to show a different version to your art director, for example. In my case, I've also created the shape key during the kick impact to try to blend with the previous shape. This kind of effect, on top of the smear effect, will fake motion blur and will help your audience to better read your animation. And as explained in the previous video, whatever you do to improve the readability of your animation will take it to the next level. (character grunting) (bag banging)
