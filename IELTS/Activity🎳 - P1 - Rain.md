## Rain

```
Do you like rainy days? Why?
```
```
Rain can calm the city down. 
Encounter traffic jams. 
Umbrella is heavy.
```

```
Does it rain much in your city?
```
```
My city always gets a timely rain, I can only say that it always rains in my city when it is most needed. 
There are lot of beautiful sunny days. 
The temperature is about minus15-20 degree centigrade. 
```
```
spring.. / summer.. / autumn.. / winter.. 
Guangzhou has a humid subtropical climate with hot, wet summers and mild, dry winters. 
Florence has a Mediterranean climate with hot, humid summers and mild, wet winters. 
```
- I live in south of China...
- It rains a lot in this area.. 
- The summer is hot and dry. 
- The spring  is cold and hot wet.

```
Would you like to live in a dry or wet place? 
```
```
I would like to live in a place with a moderate climate, where the weather is not too hot or too cold, and where there is a good balance of rain and sunshine.
```
```
I also think that a moderate climate is good for the environment. 
It allows for a wider variety of plants and animals to thrive. 
```

```
Would you change your plan if it rained?
```
```
I like out door activities... 
.. cancel my plan... 
```
```
Rainy weather does not affect my decision to go out much, but often, I consider my friends' preferences. 
For example, if I invited my parents, I would cancel the plan, since they are not comfortable in the rain.
