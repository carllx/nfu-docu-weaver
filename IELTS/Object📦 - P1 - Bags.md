## Bags
```
Do you usually carry a bag?
```

I enjoy traveling with a backpack because it gives me a sense of security. I can access my camera and computer anytime and anywhere I need to.
```

```
Do you change your bags often?
```
```
I stick to the same bag, I knew some women like to match their clothes and bags with their mood.
```

```
What kinds of bags would you use when traveling?
```
```
I choose the bag I need depending on the length of my trip. 
For a long trip, I prefer the biggest one, but for a city tour, I tend to go without a bag.
```

```
Is a bag an ideal gift?
```
```
A bag may not be the best gift idea. After all, I don't want to add more weight to my friends' shoulders.

As a primary school student, I need a big bag to carry a lot of books for the class and bring a lot of homework back home.
