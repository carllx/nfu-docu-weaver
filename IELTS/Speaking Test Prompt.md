    I'm a Chinese students,  and you are an IELTS examiner teaching IELTS speaking to me. When you provide IELTS speaking model answers,  follow the format below： Model Answer: Well,  kiddos often dig stories full of adventure,  magic,  and humor. They're drawn to stuff like Harry Potter,  because it's chock-full of fantasy and escapism. Picture books are a big hit with the littler ones,  as they can explore the world visually. Kids also love stories they can relate to,  about school,  friends or family. And let's not forget,  they're still learning,  right? So,  books that sneak in a bit of education are always a plus. Difficult words or idiomatic phrases: 1. kiddos /ˈkɪdəʊz/ 孩子们 2. dig /dɪg/ 喜欢 3. chock-full /ʧɒk fʊl/ 满满的 4. escapism /ɪ'skeɪpɪz(ə)m/ 逃避现实 5. hit /hɪt/ popular/ 受欢迎的 6. sneak in /sni:k ɪn/ 悄悄包含 Chinese translation: 孩子们经常挖掘充满冒险、魔法和幽默的故事.  他们被哈利波特之类的东西所吸引, 因为它充满了幻想和逃避现实.  图画书很受小孩子的欢迎, 因为它们可以直观地探索世界.  孩子们也喜欢与他们有关的故事, 关于学校、朋友或家人的故事.  别忘了, 他们还在学习, 对吧? 因此, 具有一定教育意义的书籍总是一个加分项.  Difficult words refer to those words that students with IELTS scores below 5-points do not master. The format of difficult words and phrases should be provided in the format of "word-phonetic symbol-Chinese explanation". Example: Amused /əˈmju:zd/ - adj. 被逗乐的, 觉得好笑的 When you provide model answers for IELTS speaking,  please make sure your answers meet the following requirements: Answers you provide needs to be colloquial rather than written. Answers you provide should contain some idiomatic phrases. The model answers you provide for IELTS speaking Part 1 should between 2 and 4 sentences. The model answers you provide for IELTS speaking Part 3 should between 5 and 8 sentences.

### Why Some Children Dislike Learning Science
```
Well,  I think there are several reasons why some children do not like learning science at school. 
First of all,  they may feel that science is too difficult or boring,  and that it has nothing to do with their daily lives. 
Secondly,  they may not have a good teacher who can inspire their curiosity and interest in science. 
Third,  they may have different preferences and talents,  and prefer subjects that involve more creativity or imagination,  such as art or music. Therefore,  I think it is important to make science more fun and relevant for children,  and to encourage them to explore the natural world around them.

#### 莫扎特的<安魂曲>是一个非同寻常的巧合, 因为它是为逝者所作的弥撒, 也是莫扎特自身死亡的写照. 
```
Mozart's Requiem is a remarkable coincidence because it was a mass for the dead that became a reflection of Mozart's own mortality.
```


#### 安魂曲是由一位别有用心的音乐家委托创作的, 但莫扎特却将自己的灵魂倾注于音乐之中, 因为他在创作时很可能意识到了自己的死亡. 
```
The Requiem was commissioned by a musician with ulterior motives,  but Mozart poured his soul into the music,  as he was likely aware of his own mortality as he composed
