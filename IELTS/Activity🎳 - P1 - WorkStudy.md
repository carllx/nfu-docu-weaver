```
Is this something you wanted to study for a long time?
```
```
Yes, I love my job. 
It is what I used to dream of. 
When I was a child, I used to dream that I could be an engineer who created robots as new lifeforms in nature. 
```
```
Today, as an artist and teacher, I work to develop public ecosystems that nurture the natural world - the very same dream I had as a child, but even more meaningful now.
```
- work to  // aim at sth  // 致力于

What is your subject / major?
```
```
While in university, I learned sculpting techniques that replicate reality, and after graduating, I furthered my studies in Italy, where I learned about contemporary art and computer technology.
Now, I am an artist and teacher who works to create virtual environments for the public.
