### Describe a historical period

**You should say:**

- What period do you want to know about?
- Why do you want to know about it?
- How do you think you can know about it?


**Why do you want to know about it?**



**How do you think you can know about it?**

I can read books and articles, go to museums, and talk to people who know about it.

**Abstract art is about making pictures with lines and shapes. It is not about real things. Classical art is about making pictures that tell stories.**

**Many people do not understand abstract art at first. But it can help us to see the world in new ways. It can also help us to appreciate nature and life more.**


**Abstract art is like a puzzle. You have to use your imagination to see what the artist is trying to show you. Classical art is like a story. The artist tells you what they want you to see.**

**Some people don't like abstract art because they don't understand it. But even if you don't understand it, abstract art can help you see the world in new ways. It can make you think about nature and life in different ways.**

Here is a simpler version:

**Abstract art is about shapes and colors. Classical art is about stories.**

**Not everyone likes abstract art, but it can help you see the world in new ways.**


Abstract art pays more attention to the randomness of the work.
Classical art pays more attention to the narrative nature of works.
