I'm happy today because I can use GPT as my language assistant. It can translate for me, and it can also teach me how to rephrase language. Secondly, I often go to YouTube, which is a school available for everyone. It has rich resources and does not require any payment.

How are languages taught and learned in your school?
```
```
When I learned language in primary school and middle school, they mainly taught skills on how to pass the examination, but they did not help us apply language in daily life. 
Also, the teachers have to take care of all students, not just address the problems of individual ones. 
```
- pass the examination // [[Phrases/Verb🏃]] 
- taught skills on how to pass the examination // [[Phrases/Verb🏃]]  // The university often teaches the skills needed to work at a company.
- apply language in daily life // [[Phrases/Verb🏃]] 
- address the problem of a single student // [[Phrases/Verb🏃]] 
- the problems of individual ones // [[Phrases/Noun📦]] 

```
On the other hand, today I prefer to learn on the internet with a GPT assistant, which is a virtual school that can more efficiently solve my individual problems in learning. The only thing I regret is that I do not have any classmates.
