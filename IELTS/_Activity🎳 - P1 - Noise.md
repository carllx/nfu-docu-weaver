I enjoy being in crowded places. 
When I feel tired, I like to go to the square in front of the Cathedral to people-watch and imagine their lives. 
It's a great way to relax and pass the time.

When I lived in Italy, traffic noise often bothered me because the houses have very low floors. 
Conversely, when I come to China, the most bothersome noise is construction noise as neighbors renovate the interiors of their homes, especially when I’m trying to study.
