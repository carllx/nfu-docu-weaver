## Week
```
What's your favorite day of the week? 
```

```
I love Fridays because they mark the end of the workweek and the beginning of the weekend.

```
What's your least favorite day? 
```

```
I dislike Mondays because they mean I have to switch from the leisurely weekend to a busy rhythm, and it takes me some time to adapt to it.
```

- leisurely weekend // 强调过得休闲的度过方式. (周末可能涉及一些工作)
- leisure weekend // 强调重于周末作为leisure 时间的目的.

```
What's the busiest day of the week for you? 
```

```
Every day is my busiest, because my daily routine is almost the same.

```
Is there anything that you do every day?
```

```
Every morning I have to get up early. 
I must switch buses to go to the school, which is one hour away from my home. 
I must deal well with the class for four hours to make sure my students can understand what I say. 
```
```
In the evening, I must stay online to respond to questions from the students. 
Also, I must prepare the content for tomorrow's class. 
```

```
Are weekdays and weekends the same for you?
```

```
The weekend is very different from weekdays to me. 
It is a time to switch up my routine and do things that I enjoy, like spending time with loved ones, pursuing hobbies, or simply relaxing.
