## Park (Cascine florence)
%% where %%
```
I want to talk about a park with a garden in the city. which is near my home. 
I like to go there Whenever I have free time.
```

```
After dinner, my girlfriend and I often go there. 
Actually I go there at least two or three times a week. And I think that it is a great place to relax.
```

%% What- Appearance %%
```
I remember the park as a grassland with a path that extends for miles along the Arno River.
It stretched for about 1 km, and from there I could see the ancient city of Florence on the other side of the river. 
```

%% poeple %%
```
In the afternoon, the young people from the nearby universities or middle schools would gather on the grass after school. 
They chatted or played guitar, enjoying the sunset over Florence.
Some nearby residents would walk by here with their dogs, and some parents would bring their kids there. 
The kids played football in the grass.
```


```
Since that river runs along a road, I enjoy walking with my girlfriend on the road after dinner. 
As I mentioned before, I think it is good for my health, and we usually walk for about thirty minutes.
```

```
At weekends, you know, I will go running in the morning in that park. Because the air is fresh and the environment of the park is perfect.
```

```
Sometimes I bring my drone to capture the ancient city of Florence along the river.

## reference
I want to talk about a park with a garden in the city. which is near my home. I like to go there Whenever I have free time.

After dinner, my girlfriend and I often go there. 
Actually I go there at least two or three times a week. And I think that it is a great place to relax.

Talking about what it is like, let me think. I remember that in the center of the park, there is a square. In the afternoon, a lot of people play badminton there. 

Especially some parents. They will bring their kids there. You know, there are also some young children who play football in the square. Sometimes I will join them.

Since that square is surrounded by a road, I enjoy walking with my girlfriend on the road after dinner. 
As I mentioned before. I think it is good for my health, and we usually walk for about thirty minutes.

At weekends, you know, I will go running in the morning in that park. Because the air is fresh and the environment of the park is perfect.

Near the square, there is a basketball court. You know, on holidays or at weekends, a lot of teenagers like to play basketball there. Sometimes my girlfriend enjoys playing it with them, and at that time, I will just sit nearby and watch them. Right.
