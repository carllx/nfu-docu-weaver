Have you ever watched a movie about robots?
```
```
When I was a kid, I watched some science fiction movies about robots. 
They showed me that robots could be either our powerful allies or our dangerous enemies. 
Today I realized that these movies made me think about the importance of ethical issues of robots.

Should we let a robot drive for us for long journeys?
```
```
In the future, it will be good for robots to drive us on long journeys. We can see today that human nature causes many traffic issues, while robots are good at following any rules strictly. 
But we still need to improve the capacity of determination of robots, because today there are still many obstacles that the robot cannot determine successfully in many extreme environments. Today, it is dangerous to let robots drive us for long journeys.
