## Shoping Center

```
I want to talk about the shopping center called TeeMall, which is near my company. Every weekend, my friends and I will have dinner there. So we'll go there at least once or twice a week. And I think that place is very crowded.
```

```
Speaking of why there are so many people, I guess the main reason is the location of that shopping center. It is really close to a subway station, so the transport is pretty convenient. A lot of people go there on weekends. Besides, compared with other shopping centers, the price of the products is not that high.
```

```
Most people can afford the products there, so that place attracts a lot of young people.
```

```
In terms of what people were doing there, there are a lot of shops on the first floor. Right? Like clothes stores, bag stores, cafes, etc. Many people go there to buy things. 
```

```
Besides, there are a lot of activities almost every weekend. So many young people and children will go there. It is really crowded on weekends. Sometimes we even cannot join the activities or take photos.
