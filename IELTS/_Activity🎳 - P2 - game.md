8  years old, ~~sblings~~ cousin

One of my happiest childhood memories is playing hide-and-seek with my cousin at my grandma's house. It was a beautiful summer day, and we ran outside to play. I went first, and I counted to 100 while he hid. When I was finished, I started looking for him. It took me a while, but I finally found him hiding behind the tree. We chased each other around the yard until I finally tagged him out.â†³

We played several more rounds of hide-and-seek that day, and we both had so much fun. I remember feeling so happy and carefree. It was one of the best days of my childhood.

I remember this experience so well because it was a reminder of how much I loved spending time with my cousin. We always had so much fun together.

hide and seek
```
The game I enjoyed playing when I was younger was hide and seek. I played it with my friends in the park near my house. We would take turns to be the seeker and the hider. 

The seeker had to count to ten and then look for the hiders. The hider had to find a good hiding spot and stay there until the seeker found them or gave up. 

The last hider to be found was the winner. I enjoyed playing this game because it was exciting, challenging, and creative. We had to use our imagination and observation skills to find the best hiding places.
