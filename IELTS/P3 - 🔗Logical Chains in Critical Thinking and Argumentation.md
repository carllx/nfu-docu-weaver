## Summarize

|Logical Chain|Explanation|When to Use|Example|
|---|---|---|---|
|Balance|Agree first, explain benefits, then give counterpoint that too much is bad, give example of downside, conclude balance is optimal.|Assessing something that has both benefits and potential downsides if taken too far. Finding a middle ground.|"Exercise is good for your health, but too much exercise can lead to injuries. It's important to find a balance that works for you."|
|Contrast|Agree first, explain benefits, then contrast the negatives of the opposite scenario, give example of downside of not having the original premise.|Highlighting the negatives or downsides of not doing something. Addressing an oppositional view.|"Social media can be a great way to stay connected with friends and family, but it can also be a major distraction. It's important to be aware of the potential downsides of social media and use it in moderation."|
|Progression|Give examples of how the premise leads to certain benefits, explain how those benefits lead to more fundamental outcomes. Good for forward-looking topics.|Discussing steps leading to a long-term outcome. Goal-oriented or developmental topics.|"Education is important because it leads to better job opportunities, which in turn lead to higher earnings and a better standard of living."|
|Parallel|Provide multiple independent reasons/examples that support the main point. The examples stand alone but together reinforce the overall argument when structured in parallel.|Providing multiple distinct supporting reasons/examples. Exploring several angles of the same theme.|"There are many reasons why we should protect the environment. First, it's our home and we have a responsibility to take care of it. Second, a healthy environment is essential for our own health and well-being. Third, a clean environment is vital for the survival of future generations."|

### Balance

  - **Steps:**
        1. Agree with the opposing viewpoint.
        2. Explain the benefits of the opposing viewpoint.
        3. Present a counterpoint that too much of the opposing viewpoint can be harmful.
        4. Provide an example of the downside of too much of the opposing viewpoint.
        5. Conclude that a balance between the two viewpoints is optimal.
  - **Example:**
    - **Opposing viewpoint:** Free speech should be unrestricted.
    - **Benefits of free speech:** Free speech allows for the exchange of ideas, promotes critical thinking, and prevents the suppression of dissent.
    - **Counterpoint:** Too much free speech can lead to the spread of misinformation, hate speech, and incitement to violence.
    - **Example of downside of too much free speech:** The rise of hate groups and online harassment.
    - **Conclusion:** A balance between free speech and the need to protect individuals from harm is necessary.
### Contrast

  - **Steps:**
        1. Agree with the opposing viewpoint.
        2. Explain the benefits of the opposing viewpoint.
        3. Contrast the negatives of the opposite scenario.
        4. Provide an example of the downside of not having the original premise.
        5. Conclude that the original premise is preferable.
  - **Example:**
    - **Opposing viewpoint:** We should not raise taxes.
    - **Benefits of not raising taxes:** Lower taxes can stimulate economic growth and reduce the burden on taxpayers.
    - **Negatives of not raising taxes:** Not raising taxes can lead to cuts in essential services, such as education and healthcare.
    - **Example of downside of not raising taxes:** The decline of infrastructure in the United States.
    - **Conclusion:** Raising taxes is necessary to fund essential services and maintain a strong economy.
### Progression

  - **Steps:**
        1. Provide examples of how the premise leads to certain benefits.
        2. Explain how those benefits lead to more fundamental outcomes.
  - **Example:**
    - **Premise:** Investing in education is beneficial.
    - **Benefits of education:** Increased job opportunities, higher earnings, and a more informed citizenry.
    - **Fundamental outcomes of education:** A stronger economy, a more just society, and a more prosperous future.
### Parallel
  - **Steps:**
        1. Provide multiple independent reasons/examples that support the main point.
  - **Example:**
    - **Main point:** Gun control is necessary to reduce gun violence.
    - **Supporting reasons:** Gun control can reduce the number of mass shootings, make it more difficult for criminals to obtain guns, and reduce the number of accidental shootings.

**Tips for Choosing the Appropriate Logical Chain**

### Balance: Use when assessing something that has both benefits and potential downsides if taken too far.
### Contrast: Use when you want to highlight the negatives or downsides of not doing something.
### Progression: Use when the topic relates to steps leading to a long-term outcome.
### Parallel: Use when you want to provide multiple distinct supporting reasons/examples.

**Additional Tips**

- Vary the chains to avoid sounding formulaic.
- Maintain logical flow and transition smoothly between points.
- Choose the chains fitting for the specific prompt or subject matter.
- Expand on key ideas meaningfully while staying on topic.
- Give concrete examples and evidence to support the main claims.

Tips answering IELTS Part3 questions:

1. Balance - Start by agreeing with the premise, explain why it's good, then give a counterpoint saying too much is not good, give an example of the downside, and conclude that balance is needed.
2. progression - Give examples of how the premise leads to certain benefits/outcomes, then explain how those ultimately promote something more fundamental. Use for more forward-looking topics.
3. Contrast - Agree with the premise, give examples of its benefits, then contrast what would happen without it and give a downside example.

### What do you think of the people who waste water?

```
What do you think of the people who waste water?
It would be acceptable to use water for our needs, because by doing this, we maintain our standard of living, but it becomes too much when the usage is wasteful. I mean if we do this without considering the scarcity, then we lose sight of conservation, you know, if people spend several minutes leaving the tap running, they won't be able to sustain our resources. So we need to have a balance.
```

Because the food in the restaurant is better than that cooked at home. For example, there are powerful chefs, high-quality ingredients and superb cooking techniques in the restaurant. Furthermore, these superior conditions can make people run to the restaurant to order food as soon as they get off work. In essence, this will promote the competition of restaurants and make the dishes more delicious to retain customers.

- Give examples of how the premise leads to certain benefits/outcomes,
- then explain how those ultimately promote something more fundamental.
- Use for more forward-looking topics.

因为餐馆的菜比在家做的菜好吃。
比如说餐馆里有厉害的大厨，优质的食材，还有高超的烹饪手法。
**更进一步，** 这些优越的条件能让大家一下班就跑着去餐馆点菜。
**本质上来说，** 这会促进餐馆的竞争，让餐厅的菜更美味来留住客户。

**Because** restaurant food tastes better than food cooked at home.
**For example,** the restaurant has a great chef, high-quality ingredients, and superb cooking techniques.

**Furthermore,** these superior conditions allow people to often choose eating out over cooking at home after work.
**Essentially,** this creates more competition among restaurants to make their food taste even better to retain customers.

### Why are more and more people drawn to restaurants?

**Because** restaurants serve food that tastes better than home-cooked meals. **For example,** restaurants have skilled chefs, high-quality ingredients, and advanced cooking techniques. **As a result, Most people** enjoy eating delicious food at restaurants .

**However, if** people don't go to restaurants, it's difficult to make delicious dishes. **For instance,** many young people cook at home now and they are independent. But without experience, the rice is overcooked and food tastes awful, making everyone feel awkward.

因为好吃。
我觉得有三个原因。
首先因为餐馆里这些优越的条件，有厉害的大厨，优质的食材，还有高超的烹饪手法。
其次上班族没有做菜经验，工作很忙饭做得很难吃，大家都想吐。
最后社会的趋势是变得更追求效率，这意味着越来越多的人越重视自己

Why do more and more people like to eat in restaurants?
Because the food tastes delicious.
I think there are three main reasons.
**First of all,**  restaurants have skilled chefs, high-quality ingredients, and excellent cooking techniques.
**Secondly,**  office workers often lack cooking experience and are very busy with work. The food they make at home can be unappetizing.
**Finally,**  society is becoming more efficient. This means more people are focusing on themselves and their needs, including not wanting to cook after a long day.

今天我们有三个逻辑来回答无数的P3问题第一个逻辑是我们在这个视频裡有讲过的叫做一个Balance这样的一个回答逻辑你觉得浪费水的人你怎么看如果你现在让你想 你可以想半天但是有这个逻辑你会非常的快首先先顺著题目说这个事情是OK的浪费水因为这样子做的话才能够维护我们的standard of living可以让我们维持基本的生存但是如果用的太浪费的话就太不好了比如说如果我们没有考虑它的吸血性就会忽视它的保护你知道举例如果人们花很多时间让水龙头开著他就不可能会保护我们的资源所以我们需要有一个平衡这样就讲完了这个逻辑的意思就是说先顺著题目说啊这个是太棒了太好了太好了然后就说啊这个实在是太过分了如果反正太过度的话那就不太好怎么一个过度法举个例子啊加一个这个if重句再说出来然后最后加一个结尾就这样子下面我们就用这个逻辑的回答50多个题你觉得去一个地方做一些准备是好的吗那肯定是好的顺著题目说我觉得这是不错的去plan ahead提前做一些准备因为这样子做可以干嘛因为这样子做我们可以享受这个旅程嘛这些英文啊享受旅程啊或者怎么样的你直接用这个百度翻译或者是O6字典翻译就可以了这个P3在考察的时候其实英文不重要相对来说不重要他考察的是思维所以说你把这个思维学会了你翻译成用这个视学会了你翻译成用这个视频的方法翻译成英文就可以了这样子是不错的因为这样子我们可以去enjoy our journey可以让我们享受这个过程但是呢我觉得如果说太细节的话呢可能就有点不太好了太细节的话呢可能就有点不太好了太细节too detail那这样子的话呢我的意思就是说什么呢如果我们没有考虑实际的自己的一个自发性那自发性这种单词你不知道怎么说你复制翻译一下就可以了呀spontaneity就是自发性那么这样子的话就会这样子的话就没有意思了就不好玩了如果旅游者每个细节都搞得很细緻If travelersPlan every single detail那么这样子他们会怎么样子他们就没有能力去干嘛就没有能力去surprise你什么都计划好了那就没有那就不可能去体验experience surprises对吧你就不能够体验这个快乐了所以说我们需要有一个平衡来你看顺著题目说再加一个R可能有点太过分的话就不好那怎么又不好加这一句话搞定下一题很多人排队超过一个小时在餐馆你怎么看?我觉得OK先顺著听不管题目怎么样我们都顺著题目说我觉得这是不错的去欣赏这个食物appreciate food因为这样子做的话我们可以enjoy our meals可以让我们吃得更爽一点啊但是呢我觉得如果等的太久Waited too long那么我就觉得会就会没有意义就会失去它这个本身的价值怎么样解释呢你知道啊就是说如果人们花很长时间排队排队就queuing那就是这个词 queuingfor a long time那么他会怎么样呢那他就不能够成为一个时间管理大师吗排队就queuing就这个词queuingfor a long time那么他会怎么样呢那他就不能够成为一个时间管理大师吗对吧 他就没有能力去use that time efficiently所以呢 我们需要找一个平衡那这样子就不是说完了这个逻辑的好处就是你输了一大堆又能展开然后好像输了但是好像又输了很多好像没输 但是好像又说了很多好像没说但是好像又说了很多他就有这个好处你觉得父母帮助孩子选朋友好吗还是用这样的一个逻辑首先我们顺著题目来说啊我觉得这个是好的是好的去guide children因为这样子做的话我们可以让他们成长neutral their girls但是呢如果是管的太多too strong那可能就不太好了没有考虑到他们的一个独立性考虑到他们的一个自发性自主性autonomy考虑他们的自主性那么这样子的话呢就不太好那么举什么意思呢你看如果父母一直选择他们的孩子的朋友那么他们就不能干嘛了他们就不能学会social skills他们就没有社会学不会社会技能跟谁玩都是你规定的对不对所以我们为你的family balance好这样子下一题你觉得明星代言广告怎么样明星的背书怎么样顺著题目说太棒了啊我觉得用明星来说是非常好的因为这样子的话呢我们可以怎么样attract customers可以吸引用户但是呢如果太依赖这个就不太好了我的意思就是说如果没有考虑实际的意义就会失去它的一个真实性那你知道如果公司他只专注在名人代言上面那么他们就不可能去干嘛就不可能去改变他们的产品注重用户体验创新出新的这个功能对不对所以呢We need to have balance要搞定一体注重用户体验创新出新的这个功能feature 对不对所以呢 we need to have a balance要搞定一起你觉得好的食物和饮料很重要吗对于这个庆祝我觉得酒肉麴铃是非常棒的酒肉麴铃的话你可以用那个indulging就是i-n-d-u-l-g-i-nindulgingindulgeindulge我觉得酒肉齿龄是非常不错的因为这样子做的话呢我们可以去怎么样去让我们过得很爽很放鬆但是如果成本太夸张的话呢也不太好如果不考虑这个预算budget你看你知道如果大家花几个小时准备一些食物啊或者饮料或者一直吃那么相反这样子你就不能够去感受这个Enjoy the celebrations你就不能够体验更好的去享受这个Celebrations因为你一直在吃是不是所以We need to have balance是不是下一个因为你一直在吃是不是所以我们要有平衡是不是下一个媒体是不是太关注名人了那我们还是顺著这个题目说我觉得确实是如此这个名人确实被媒体关注的太多了而忽视了一些重要的新闻和问题出示了一些价值但是我觉得呢OK媒体去关注这个名人我觉得是OK的因为他们可以干什么呢可以帮助我们传播信息可以让我们传播信息但是呢如果过度专注的话呢这可能是不太好的啊你知道啊如果媒体花很大量的报告一直报告美国名人的某一个方面全面啊那么这样子的话呢就会让我们丧失一些对基本信息的一些了解比如说气候问题环境问题或者是大家的一个生活的质量的问题一些常见的这些新闻就看不到了所以说我们需要有一个平衡嗯 保定啊你觉得shopping对一个国家的经济有好处吗?我们还是顺著这个题目来说我觉得这个是有好处的可以去promote shopping因为这样子做的话可以提高经济boost our economy但是呢如果说这个消费太多的话是不太好的你知道啊如果大家花很多的精力去shopping那么这样子能干嘛呢他们就不能够存钱给未来对未来他们就不能够save for the future所以呢,when you have balance又搞定了下一题你觉得应该有一个课程教年轻人小孩子去放鬆吗我们还是顺著题目来讲我觉得教小孩子去放鬆来说是不错的因为这样子的话可以让他们充电然后让他们知道比如说一些压力管理还有情绪的管理emotional regulation但是如果太夸张了就不太好了如果没有重视什么呢如果没有重视就是说小孩子的他们的一个独立性每个人的特点那就不太好比如说他们的年纪他们的这个发展阶段stage还有他们的一些一些喜欢的这个发展阶段还有他们的一些一些喜欢的一些科目之类的后面的话呢我就举个例子你看比如说这个幼儿园的小朋友或者稍微小一点的刚上小学中学的这样的一群同学一群朋友那么他们来说的话呢他们不应该学习放鬆啊他们应该去动起来他们去搞一些physical activity对不对而不是说去学放鬆因为这个年纪需要的是一种在运动之中在打闹之中去学会社交技能而不是说去玩去放鬆什么也不动对不对所以We need to have a balance搞定了下一题你觉得小孩子可以去发出噪音的吗我们还是顺著来说我觉得发出噪音来说是不错的啊因为这样子的话呢我们可以让他怎么样他们可以去表达自己的独立性可以表达自己的个性这样子会导致一个什么呢nurture creativity会有创新力但是如果他一直吵这样子肯定是不太好的比如说如果一个小孩子一直弄噪音那么他就会失去一个什么东西呢他就不能够去干嘛呢他就不能够去学习一个好的习惯啊习惯的话我们用一个词代表行为的那一个manners他就不能够learn good manners他就不是一个好孩子所以我们需要有平衡又搞定了你觉得展示比述说要好吗?我觉得顺著题目来说应该是不错的因为这样子来做的话我们可以让小孩子乐在其中就是学在其中但如果是完全强调这个又不太好我们举一个例子比如说如果教育者他只是说他只是教他只是行为上有展示但是他不说那么小孩子就they have no idea what you're doing他完全不知道你在干嘛他们就无法理解所以we need to have a balance你就搞定了下一题他完全不知道你在干嘛他们就无法理解所以We need to have a balance又搞定了下一题你觉得小孩子有的时候需要去做重要的决定吗我觉得有时候呢授权小孩子empower小孩子是不错的因为这样子做的话呢我们可以去锻鍊他们的独立性他们的独立性但是呢如果这个决定太複杂的话没有考虑他们的一个成熟度那么这样子可能是不太好的然后你知道啊如果小孩子他们去做决定超越了他们所能承担的一个力量超越他们他们所能承担的一个力量超越他们的一个实际的一个水平他们就不可能够怎么样Grow healthily他们就不能够很健康的成长所以We need to have a balance下一个你觉得广告的影响是好的吗我觉得按照这个顺的题目来说我觉得这是ok的因为这样子的话可以让用户更好地Understand product但是如果一直依照这个东西的话可能会失去一些最核心的价值你看我的意思就是说什么如果人们花几个小时的时间都是做什么决定都是被广告所影响那么他就很难去做出一个恰如其分的这样一个决定那么这样子可能会影响他的一个整体的生活的质量啊等等的对吧所以So we need to have a balance下一题你觉得中学小学你觉得这个交易点这个职业课程ok吗还是顺著题目来讲我觉得这是不错的如果能够在这个小学啊给他们教一点这种经验因为这样子来说的话呢这个阶段是一个比较啊比较一个crucial developmental stage这是一个比较重要的一个阶段对稍微点一下这个题它比较重要的一个阶段但是呢如果这个东西太多也不太好什么意思呢如果他们老师花时间去告诉他们要学什么技能他们别的一些科目上关于一些个人成长Personal growth那你就会欠缺所以We need to have balance下一题你觉得政府应该制定规则给大家去使用公共交通吗我觉得这是不错的鼓舞大家去使用公共交通因为这样子搞的话呢我们就能够更好的去保护我们这个环境因为私家车排尾气太严重对不对但是如果一直这样子的话可能也不是特别好因为你知道啊如果没有考虑大家的这个transport needs of the public那么我们可能会失去它的这个意义你知道如果大家都被逼著去放弃他们的私家车他们就不能够怎么样不能够满足他们的出行需求meet the travel needs所以呢we need to have a balance下一题你觉得地点很重要吗吸引用户我觉得是很重要的吸引用户因为这样子做的话我们就可以去吸引用户但是如果一直强调这个地点肯定是不太好的我的意思就是说如果你没有考虑这个比如说服务质量quality 还有这个service那么你就会丧失他的这个价值的意义你看 如果公司他只聚焦在地点那么他就不可能说 培养这个用户的忠诚度所以呢 我们需要一个平衡下一题孩子应该有很多样的礼物吗玩具吗我觉得是ok的可以像孩子礼物因为这样子搞的话呢他们可以干什么呢可以stimulate their creativity可以刺激他们的创造性但是呢 如果给太多也不是特别好如果没有考虑他们的实际需求或者他们的这个年年纪特徵的话很有可能会丧失他的意义你知道如果小孩子被很多的这个overwhelmed with too many toys他们就怎么样呢他们会觉得take for grantedand not appreciate it他们会觉得理所应当然后不会去珍惜它所以呢我们需要有一个平衡下一题你觉得父母应该教小孩子如何去和别人合作吗我觉得这是不错的因为这样子做的话可以学会一些社会技巧但是如果这个太强势太夸张的话可能也不太好这样子会失去他的这个意义你知道啊如果小孩子要让他们去完全的服从一个集体conform to the group那么他们就会怎么样他们就没有能力去发展自己的这个personal strength他们个性化的一些力量个性化的一些优点所以呢我们需要一个平衡讲到这裡已经讲完了18道题目了你看这个效率是不是非常的夸张下面我们讲第二个逻辑是progression这个progression逻辑是之前这个视频里面有讲到过就是餐馆为什么比在家做的好因为餐馆好在什么地方因为餐馆好 好什么地方因为餐馆好好在什么地方呢你看这裡就举例举完例子之后呢加一个地劲那么地劲之后呢再加一个地影啊餐馆有很多厨师有这个美味的食材那美味的食材的话又让大家会去跑那这个事情就会导致这个餐馆之间的竞争会让这个用户越来越多这就是一个地劲地劲的这样的一个关係我们来看怎么样去弄他针对progression来讲的一般来说针对那种比较有未来的事情我们可以用progression的逻辑比如说小孩子小孩子他不是要长大成人吗所以说用progression逻辑不错啊你看小孩子需要有零花钱吗应不应该呢我觉得这是应该的啊因为有零花钱吗应不应该呢我觉得这是应该的啊因为有零花钱比没有要强他可以学到什么东西呢比如说budget比如说budget一些预算他可以知道这个钱的价值然后还知道这个怎么使用钱的independence独立性这样子的话呢他会怎么样呢他会让孩子当他们变成书以后变成一个有财务管理的人more financially responsible adult更加去对自己的财务负责这样的人本质上的话呢这样会促进一个什么呢他们对财务上的认知的一个理解让他们变得知道怎么样去handle their finances in the future会让他们在未来怎么去管理他们的钱为什么小孩子喜欢穿这个特别特殊的服装呢因为穿这个特殊的服装比不穿 比穿普通的服装要更有意思怎么有意思比如说他有不同的cultures然后他有这个不同的然后呢他会有怎么样呢他可以有这个role playing可以角色扮演还可以表达这个creativity创造性还可以探索不同的characters不同的角色更进一步说这些有趣的事情的话就会让他们有机会去穿这些东西那本质上的话这就会导致一个什么现象呢会让他们的这个creativity还有这个imagination都有一个开发会让他们觉得enjoyable所以这是一个好事对吧22这是22级的应该是为什么人要去城市呢222222为什么人要去城市呢我们还是用这个逻辑来回答因为因为这个城市的体验来说呢它是比在hometown要更加多一些城市裡面有不同的这个culture有不同的这个美味还有很多一些独特的视角那么这些东西的话呢会让人去城市去有不同的cultures有不同的美味还有很多独特的视角那么这些东西会让大家想去别的城市只要他们有机会的时候本质上的话,这会怎么样呢?这会促进文化的交流Exchange of cultures还有就是说让旅游者本身变得更加的包容或者是变得更加的这个knowledgeable那这样子呢去一个回答当然你也可以说当然这道题本身来讲的话呢如果说是问的是关于旅游啊一个陌生人到一个新地方可以按这个逻辑来啊如果说是问了一个人到一个城市裡偏向找工作这个逻辑呢也是可以用这个逻辑来回如果说是问了一个人到一个城市裡偏向找工作这个逻辑呢也是可以用这个逻辑来回答的都是一个样子的啊一个意思啊下一个是为什么现在大公司要引入新的产品这么的频繁啊因为新产品的诱惑力比这个老产品要大很多比如说有很多Latest Technology高科技的科技最新的科技创新的feature的特点功能还有这些用户的需求是更加多那么这样子的话就会让这个市场让大家去开发新的产品本质上会导致一个什么创新精神的一个爆发然后的产品本质上会导致一个什么呢创新精神的一个爆发然后让产品让这个公司更加的competitive变得更加有竞争性下一题为什么大家买了还要买iphone即使没有什么变化啊那我们可以说因为买这个iphone的话他的这个信誉是不错的啊就是prestige就是他的这个产品的这个形象是非常深入人心的比起别的一些品牌怎么深入人心呢他有这个brand value产品价值品牌价值design很好的设计然后呢还有这个reliable user experiencereliable user experience又很好的用户体验那么这样子的优势的话就会让大家去买这个最新的苹果手机一旦他发布的时候这样子的话就会促进这个品牌的忠诚度然后让他们保持自己的一个市场地位 儘管儘管只有一点很小的这个更新一些很小的变化 minimal changes下一题 演员非常感兴趣他们的这个演员 下一题啊 演员非常感兴趣他们的工作吗为什么 因为呢这个满意度是非常的高的比起一些别的职业 凭什么说演员这个职业比别的要高呢我们举例啊 你看演员他有这个非常吸引你的脚本然后呢 他有这个不一样的character 有这个角色然后还有一些 然后在扮演的时候呢会有这个不一样的角色有这个角色然后还有一些然后在扮演的时候呢会有这种很爽的刺激的感觉那么这些东西加杂在一起就会让他们immerse themselves他们会沉浸在角色裡面然后就出不来了所以大家看很多演员演了一部戏或者演部电视剧他就陷进去了真的就变成那个电视电视剧里面那个人或者是变成那个情景啊这个不知道是是角色塑造的这个人呢还是说他本来就是这样的人只是说刚好有个体现所以这种东西说不清啊那么这样子的话呢他就会完全的变成这个非常喜欢这个角色啊喜欢这个领域这样子的话呢一直的坚持持续下去所以他很喜欢啊就这样展开一下就可以了非常喜欢这个角色啊 喜欢这个领域这样子的话呢一直的坚持持续下去 所以他很喜欢啊 就这样展开一下就可以了那么下一个我记得是Contrast Contrast的话呢重点呢 刚才前面部分都是一样的啊观点 然后举例 然后大部分的干嘛Contrast重点是这裡 不这样会怎样啊如果不这样子餐馆的食物好吃因为有很多大厨大部分想去满足他们的舌头如果不去这样子他就很难去做美味的食物比如说很多人很独立但是不会做饭做出来就很难吃大家都想吐啊重点就是说不这样子做有什么一个坏处这叫Contrast那么我们来看一看怎么去回答用这个来回答这道题 为什么公司要很引进这个新的这个产品呢 一直要去搞这些新产品呢如果用这个Contrast的这个逻辑来回答 我们可以这样说啊 因为呢这个竞争在现在来讲是比以前要激烈很多对吧 有这个不同的用户的这个需求然后呢 科技的发展还有这个很多出创公司的这个出来对吧 那么这些东西的话呢大部分的公司呢都想去弄一个新的产品这样子去佔据一席之地如果啊 关键点来了如果他们不去这样子弄那么就很难再佔据市场的份额这些词你不用害怕你直接百度翻译欧陆字典翻译你就有了啊比如说啊你看一些传统的公司他们就按照自己的以前的流水线来制造非常的保守但是呢没有持续性的创新市场份额是在decline是在下降的所以这个非常危险这就是我们用这个Contrast再看下一题Contrast为什么现代人喜欢比以前喜欢去购物因为这个现在的选项比以前要去更多了对吧有全球品牌有online platform在线平台还有这个instant delivery就是快速送达大部分人都想去尝试一下这个各种各样的方式来满足自己的一个购物需求对不对然后呢如果不采用这些购物方法的话呢就会买不到那么多的产品举个例子你看比如说现在很多人喜欢去线些购物方法的话就会买不到那么多的产品举个例子你看比如说现在很多人喜欢去线下购物对吧他比较的传统他也不会去买太多的线上的东西但是呢如果不拥抱互联网的话你的选择面是非常窄的对不对不是很方便有的东西根本就买不到对不对下一个大公司比小公司要好吗大公司比小公司要好吗大公司比小公司要好吗是的因为呢大公司有很多的资源resources要多一些多在哪裡呢我们就可以讲比如说他的networks就是他人脉比较广然后呢他的资金比较大还有一个呢他市场的延伸是比较广的大部分人呢 都想去工作在大公司去满足他们的这个职业规划对吧 那么我们举个例子 如果不去大公司的话呢 你会发现怎么样呢很难的去实现他们的这个职业抱负 我举个例子啊比如说现在很多年轻人他们去开一个公司开一个公司一般都是小公司嘛所以刚好可以扣一下小公司但是呢很有雄心壮志ambitious但是呢就是说没有很多资源的话你这个增长就非常的慢对不对然后这样子会非常的很难经营下去反正我们就顺著这个逻辑说怎么样合适就怎么说就可以了下一题为什么现在大家会会请到呢因为现在的这个distraction是比以前要更多的比如说现在有很多的这个各种样的通知手机上的这个notification还有这个email对吧还有这个interactions就是我们日常生活之中的但大部分人都发现很难去怎么样呢就是去管理他们的时间啊就不能够很难的 很容易的去管理好自己的时间所以举个例子啊 比如说现在有很多人他嗯 会有很多的 他会多线操作他做同一时间做很多很多的事情他们感觉他们很忙很厉害但是呢没有一个合理的时间规划他们的这个appointment经常就会啊get delayed就是被推演然后这样子非常的尴尬对不对下一个为什么大家现在很难去放鬆啊啊因为现在的压力呢比起以前要要这个要怎么样呢要大很多以前要大很多对吧大很多比如说现在有很多的工作然后呢有很多的责任还有呢就是说你的期望来自于朋友亲戚的这是非常之大的那么大部分人的话呢你都想找到一个大部分的想找到一个地方去休息一下这是一个比较难的事情对不对那么如果说他们过度的去休息他会发现怎么办呢他就过不了日子了对不对你看比如说现在很多养家糊口的人他需要不间断的工作他们非常的努力但是如果他们稍微去休息一下稍微休息一下下他们就会发现工作效率就降下来了然后就发现不履为贱了就很难满足一个Family needs 满足家庭的需求所以说从一个Financial stability 这样的角度来出发的话呢 他就只能一直持续不断的干下去根本就没有时间去relax对不对好再来看这一题为什么现在大家不能存钱我们还是从这个逻辑来说啊因为呢现在这个即时满足的这个诱惑是要大很多的比起涨钱即时满足怎么说immediate gratification比如说呢 现在有很多吸引人的货物然后呢 有很多诱人的广告还有就是衝动性购买的这样的一个很爽的感觉大部分人这样去买东西然后满足他们当下去满足他们的这个当下那么这样子的话呢如果说tryant去满足他们的这个当下 那么这样子的话呢如果说 但后面我们要反过来说啊 如果说他他不这样去搞之后的话呢 他相反还过得不舒服 什么意思呢 你看啊举个例子 比如说现在很多人他非常的节约啊 他什么都不愿意去多买一点他非常的节俭但是这样子很讽刺的一点就是说这样他很有可能会错失一些自我成长提高生活质量提高工作效率的一些机会因为你花钱了你得到了新的这些方法知识或者工具你才能变得更强 而不是去斩他对吧 你看我这样子反著说正著说 这样子Contrast就出来了讲到这裡在不知不觉之中已经讲了30道题了所以这个效率是非常之高的
