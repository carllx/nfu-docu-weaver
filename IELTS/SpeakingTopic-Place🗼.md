### Library
```
I fear for the future of physical libraries. When I'm in the library, I can't always find the book I need: either it's too popular and checked out, or it's too niche and not in the library's collection. With the increasing number of books and the decline of physical books, the library's functions seem increasingly limited.

I prefer to go to the store alone. If I bring my friends, I'll spend a lot of time helping them select items; if I bring my girlfriend, I'll spend more money on various snacks.
