%% 因为这些问题是关于保持注意力集中的活动, 尤其是在学校和嘈杂的环境中. 
The questions you have given belong to the topic of **Activity**. They are all related to the activity of staying focused, which is the ability to concentrate on a task or goal without being distracted. Staying focused is an important skill for learning, working, and achieving personal or professional objectives. Some people may find it easier or harder to stay focused depending on their personality, motivation, environment, and other factors.

## Concentration
```
Did you stay focused in class when you were a child? 
```
```
no, I often struggled to keeping up with my peers or understanding what my teachers are saying. 
```
- 我经常很难跟上同龄人的步伐或理解老师所说的内容.
- struggled to // 挣扎, 很难
- keeping up with // 跟上
- my peers // 同龄人

```
Are you a focused person?
```
```
I have a keen interest in coding, and I often lose track of time when I am working on a project. 
Sometimes, I code all night and only realize it is daytime when I look up from my screen.
```

```
How do you stay focused?
```
```
I am fascinated by the things that interest me, and they always motivate me with a clear goal.
```


```
Is it easy to stay focused in a noisy environment?
```
```
The only factor that distracts me from my work is the noise around me. 
```

 
In general, I can't stay in environments that are too noisy. Noise tends to distract me and make it difficult for me to concentrate. However, some background noise can help me focus on my work. [[_IELTS⭐]]
