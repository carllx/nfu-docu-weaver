For thousands of years,  we have consistently developed technologies to address the problem of agriculture that arises from the chaotic environment.
```

- For thousands of years // ~~thousands of years~~
- consistently developed // ~~consistent~~ ~~develop~~
- address the problem // ~~again  the problem~~ 
- arises // the problem of agriculture that problem ~~bring~~  from // 产生

Today we have succeeded in applying machines,  drones,  and even robots to handle the crops.
```

- succeeded // ~~susseced~~
- have succeeded in // ~~made susseced~~ in

It seems we would no longer worry about the shortage caused by farming.
```

- It seems // ~~It seem~~
- caused by // ~~cause~~ by

#### 3
```
But,  the people who live in extreme environments such as places that are not suitable for cultivation still get hungry.
```

- places that are not // that are not // where I live in

#### 4
```
The possibility of transport may be the key factor to solve the problem of hunger.
```

- hunger // get hungry // problem of hunger

#### 5
```
Since today we can generate considerable quantities of food via a variety of technical approaches in some high-tech areas,  we can deliver the food via transport.
```

- variety // ~~varetry~~
- considerable quantities  //  相当数量
- food // ~~foods~~

#### 6
```
Someone may debate that,  the natives may be too poor to pay for the cost,  even only the prices of the food itself.
```

- debate // ~~debbet~~
- may be too // ~~may too~~

#### 7
```
Accessibility is still a key point to solve that.
```

- Accessibility // ~~Reachable~~

#### 9
```
Some of them often got sick or hungry because of the area they lived in was inaccessible.
```

This is a typical example to highlight the importance of accessibility as China was the most advanced country in farming at that time.
```

- highlight // ~~highline~~

#### 11
```
Additionally,  accessibility will provide opportunities for spreading new cultivation technologies to specific shortage areas. 
```

```
It can also encourage migration which is another possible solution for people who lived in inappropriate places.
```

Finally,  I realize that,  transport development is the key way to solve the problem of hunger.

When all is said and done,  we are still not advanced enough to understand our chaotic nature today.

`Thousand of years,  we consistent develop the tecnologies to again the problem of argriculture which bring from the chaotic enviroment. Today we have made susseced in appling machine,  drone,  even robat to handle the crop. It seem we would not longer worry about the shortage cause by farming. But,  the poeple who lives in the extreminal environment such as some where is not suitable for cultivation still gets hungry.

The possibility of transport may be the key factor to solve the problem of hungry. 
Since today we would generate considerable quantities of food via a varetry of approaches tecnical in some high-tech area,  we would deliver the foods via trasport. Someone may debbet that,  the natives may too poor to pay for the cost,  even only the prices of the food itself. Reachable is still a keypoint for solve that. In acient period,  the tribes of  mongolia which live around the border of china,  have alway been relied on exchange rice  and tea with chiese comerciant  via sheep coats rather than money. Some of them often got sick or hungry beacuse of the area they lives in is unreachable.  this is a typical  example  to highline the importance of Reachable as China is the most advance country in farming in that time.
Additionaly,  reachable will provide ocasion for spread new cultivative  technologies to specific shortage area,  Also it can encourage mirgration which is another possibile solution for people who was lived in a innaproppriate place.

Finelly,  I realize that,  the transport develpment is the key way to solve the problem of hungry,  when all is said and done,  we still not advance enough to understand our chaotic of nature today. `
