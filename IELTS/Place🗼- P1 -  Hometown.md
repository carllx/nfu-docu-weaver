I will stay here to take care of my parents since they are old and I am their only child.

6. Did you like living there? 
5. Do you like your hometown? 
8. Is there anything you disliked about it? 
```
```
Honestly, I don't like to live in my hometown so much. It is very crowded nowadays. The young people in our country have become accustomed to ordering food on the internet. This increases the traffic issue in my city. 
```
```
We can see the road is full of vehicles for delivering food, even on the sidewalk. The city is chaotic, which is not friendly to the old people who live here.

12. Did you learn about the history of your hometown at school? 
```
```
When we were at school, we learned less about the history of our city. I mainly learned from my parents when they took me outside and went around the city. They would tell me some history about the city.
