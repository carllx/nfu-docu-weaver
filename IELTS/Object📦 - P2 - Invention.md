## Invention
##### What it is  %% laptop apple mac %%
```
Let's talk about my Apple MacBook that I bought a while ago. Before using it, I used many other laptops running Windows, like Lenovo and Dell.
```
##### What you use it for  %% prepare class; make tool; art project; %%
```
I use it for my daily work. 
For example, I can use it to prepare the class as I am a teacher. 
and I can make some interesting tools for art projects as I am also a digital artist. 
```
##### Is it easy to use  %% compare window %%
```
I think it is much easier to use than a Windows laptop because its user interface is more user-friendly.
```
##### And explain why it is very useful in your daily life. %% no heavy, small ; %% 
```
I've found it to be even better suited for my needs. 
```
```
It is light and small enough that I can carry it in my bag or even in my hand. So I can work anywhere, such as at the coffee bar, on the bed, or even in the bus. 
It save my a lot of time, when I go home by bus, which is one hour away from my school, I can continue my job on the road.
