```
Are there wild animals in your country?
```
```
I believe that there are many white animals in our country because there are a lot of mountain areas, rivers, and grasslands of forests. 
As I know, the most famous white animals are the tiger and the panda.

```
Have you ever been to a zoo or a safari park?
```
```
I know that many children love to go to the zoo, but not me. 
My parents took me to the zoo when I was a kid. 
I didn't have many memories of that place. 
I just felt that the safari smell was not very good and that many animals looked lazy. 
They didn't look much like they did on TV, even the tigers.

```
What is the animal you would like to see in the wild?
```
```
In fact, I'm a little afraid of pets or animals. Today, maybe it's caused by many years ago when I was a child. I used to be chased by a dog that looked like it wanted to steal my breakfast from my hand. So every time when I see a dog in front of me, I just can't help but run away.

```
Are there TV programs about wild animals in your country?
```
```
Yes, as I know, there is a TV program called Animal World. 
I didn't watch it much, but recently I realized that the programs about wild animals help us to know more about the nature that surrounds us and care about every living being.
