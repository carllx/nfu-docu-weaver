#### City - Florence

The city I'm now talking about is Florence. Which is a historic tourist city in central Italy.

It should be  ten years ago,  
I went to Florence to further my master's study in sculpture. 
I went there mainly because there are many famous artists,  such as Michelangelo and da Vinci,  who are artists we are still studying today.

Talking about what buildings the city has. Just like most of the old cities in Italy,  there are a lot of ancient buildings,  historic landmarks,  in this city. 

Speaking of what Florence is famous for?   Florence is an art paradise,   It is famous for Renaissance art and architecture. If you really love art,  I strongly recommend you.

In terms of why I think the city is beautiful,  I think Florence has lovely narrow streets and alleys. 
Also it is a shopping paradise. People can buy leather goods,  gold jewelry,  art reproductions - anything they want. Besides,  the nightlife in Florence is pretty lively. 
At night we can go to the city center. There are a lot of small bars and cafes. 
So we can go to the bars,  enjoy the nightlife over a glass of Chianti wine.
