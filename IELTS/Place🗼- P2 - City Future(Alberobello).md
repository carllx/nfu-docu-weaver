## Alberobello
```
The city I'm going to talk about is Alberobello, which is a small tourist city in the south of Italy. 
It was several months ago that I traveled to Alberobello with my girlfriend because we wanted to visit one of my best friends. 
```

```
We stayed there for a few weeks and had a good trip. That is the reason why I know this city pretty well. 
```

```
Talking about the buildings the city has, just like most of the medieval cities in Italy, there are a lot of whitewashed stone buildings with cone-shaped roofs in this city. Speaking of what the city is famous for, let me think about it. 
```

```
As we know, Alberobello is a UNESCO World Heritage site, right? It is famous for its unique trulli buildings. 
If you really love to see these beautiful cone-shaped houses, I strongly recommend you to visit there. 
There are entire neighborhoods made up of these trulli.
```

```
In terms of why I think the city is beautiful, I think Alberobello is set amongst olive groves and vineyards. Also, it is a shopping paradise. 
People can go there and buy locally-made souvenirs and handicrafts. 
Besides, the nightlife in Alberobello is pretty charming. 
```

```
At night, we can go to the city center, where there are a lot of small wine bars and trattorias. 
We can go to these cozy spots and enjoy the charming nightlife.

## Example-Chongqing
Let's get started. The city I'm going to talk about is Chongqing, which is a small tourist city in the south of China, right? It was several months ago that I traveled to Chongqing with my girlfriend because we wanted to visit one of my best friends. We stayed there for a few weeks and had a good trip. That is the reason why I know this city pretty well.

Talking about the buildings the city has, just like most of the urban cities in China, there are a lot of tall and modern buildings in this city. Speaking of what the city is famous for, let me think about it. As we know, Chongqing is a food paradise, right? It is famous for its spicy food. If you really love to eat spicy food, I strongly recommend you to visit there. There is a local food called hot pot, which is my favorite food. People just boil the vegetables and meat together, and they put a lot of spice in it. It is really delicious.

In terms of why I think the city is beautiful, I think Chongqing is a mountainous city. Also, it is a shopping paradise. People can go there and buy anything they want. Besides, the nightlife in Chongqing is pretty colorful. At night, we can go to the city center, where there are a lot of bar streets. We can go to the bars and enjoy the colorful nightlife.
