## Teachers
```
Do you want to be a teacher in the future?
```
```
I would rather be a teacher who is passionate about knowledge than an employee who is just working for a company.
```

```
Do your remember one of your teachers?
```
```
I just remembered a professor who taught me in Italy. He was a very kind and patient man. For example, when foreign students had language issues, he was willing to take the time to draw graphs to explain problems and solutions. I received a lot of helpful guidance from him.

What were your primary school teachers like?
```
```
My primary school teacher was very strict. 
I remember one time when I missed a perfect score by just one point. 
I actually felt happy about it, but my teacher got very angry with me. 
As punishment, she made me stand for a whole lesson.

Do you have a favourite teacher?
```
```
It is difficult to choose my favorite teacher. If I have to choose, I would say my parents are my favorite teachers because they were the ones who always supported me and encouraged me. More importantly, they guided me to have a personality of my own.
