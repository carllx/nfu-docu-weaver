Yes, I used to play a musical instrument, the accordion, which was my father's favorite. He loved the sound of the accordion and he wanted me to be a musician who played it well. But I gave it up eventually, because my father was strict with my accordion practice, and I had trouble concentrating as a kid.

Do you think music education is important for children?

I don't know if it is important for children to learn a musical instrument. I think there are many other choices in different fields. For example, some children might learn visual arts and how to draw, which can also develop their abstract thinking.
