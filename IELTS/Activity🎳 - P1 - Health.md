## Health


```
How do you keep healthy?
```
```
I maintain my health in two main ways - sleeping and eating well. 
I do less sports these days because I've been busy. 
I go to sleep earlier to ensure I get enough rest. 
I also consume plenty of vegetables to maintain a balanced diet and provide my body with essential nutrients.

What are your favorite sports?
```
```
I prefer swimming as my favorite sport because it is a low-impact exercise that is gentle on the joints and skeleton, making it more beneficial for my physical body.

What sports help people stay healthy?
```
```
Yoga. 
Dancing. 
Running. 
Swimming. 
Other sports rely heavily on equipment.
Walking is the best sport for our health, as we have entered a sedentary era.

Is it easy for people to exercise in your country?
```
```
I think this question depends on the people's age. 
Young people tend to make money for survival and they often have no time to exercise themselves. 
However, some of them force themselves to make time and prefer to go to the fitness room.

On the other hand, old people have a lot of time and they prefer outdoor fitness. 
Tai chi and dancing are very common exercises in their daily lives.
