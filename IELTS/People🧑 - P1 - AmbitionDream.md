## Ambition
```
What was your childhood dream?
```
```
When I was a child, I dreamed of becoming an engineer who could create robots. 
I remember that I often tried to draw the structure of the robot at home when I was a kid. 
However, I ultimately became a digital artist, which allows me more creative freedom and focuses more on human nature. 
```

```
Are you the kind of person who sticks to dreams?
```
```
I don't think I am a person who can persist in doing something. 
I know that I am easily affected by the environment. 
I think I can stick to my dream thanks to my parents, who always support me in doing what I am interested in. 
I don't need to care about the problems or the environment, and I never change my mind. 
```

```
What is your dream job?
```
```
The best job I want to do is what I am doing today. I used to be an engineer who created robots as new lifeforms. 
Similarly, now I am an artist who uses art to explore the human nature and develop a more vibrant ecosystem of nature. 
```
```
I am also a teacher who guides students to be artists who focus on human nature, which I believe is more powerful than to be artist alone.
```

```
Do you think you are an ambitious person?
```
```
I am not sure if I am ambitious, but I am trying to balance ambition and family.
