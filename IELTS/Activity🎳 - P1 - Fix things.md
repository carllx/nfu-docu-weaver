### Fixing things
```
Can you fix things?
```

```
Yes, as a man, I should say that I am good at repairing some facilities in my home, such as broken chairs or lamps. 
However, I am not good at mending clothes; my girlfriend is better at that.
```


```
Did anybody teach you to fix things when you were a child? 
```

```
I apologize for not being able to find a suitable example to answer your question. 
Perhaps this is because my parents fixed everything during my childhood.
```

```
Do you think it is necessary for people to learn to fix things? 
```

```
Yes, I think people should learn basic knowledge to fix things around them. However, if the problem is too complicated, it is better to ask for help from an expert to avoid making things worse. 
```

```
What do you do when a thing is broken and cannot be fixed? 
```

```
If the thing is broken and cannot be repaired, I will just throw it away. 
However, if the thing is meaningful, I will either take a picture and store it in the album or find a space to keep it. 
```
