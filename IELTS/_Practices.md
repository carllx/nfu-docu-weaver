```
My family name is Lin and my given name is Xin. 
```

P1. do you like your name [[IELTS-People🧑]] 
```
In my native language,  Xin means "before the sun rises." I think my parents gave me this name because they hoped I would be a person who could paint color to the sky and give hope to everyone every morning. Perhaps that is why I finally became an artist.

```
That night,  My parents cooked for me,   I hadn't eaten food made by them in a long time.  
It reminded me of many years ago when we used to eat as a family. 
We also talked a lot about our daily lives,  and I realized that they had aged since I left home and they needed me to take care of them,  as I am their only child. 
So,  that night,  I made a big decision: to return to my home country and be with them.

Talking about my first try of melon and prosciutto,  which is a food from southern Italy,  I got to try it when I went to the city of Carrara and visited my friends. My friend treated me to go to a restaurant. Of course,  we ordered a lot of seafood. One of the dishes shocked me when it was put on the table. It looked like a joke and I didn't dare try it for a long time. But I eventually did. I was surprised again - it was delicious! The sweetness of the melon balanced the saltiness of the prosciutto,  and the taste just like you are watching a movie that combines war and fairy tales. It also made me think of the name of a film 'Beauty and the Beast'. I reall
y loved the tasty combination and will try it again when I have a chance to go back to Italy.
