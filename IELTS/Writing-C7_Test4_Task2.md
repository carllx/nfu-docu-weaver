In the modern world,   there exist two distinct categories of educational institutions: one primarily focuses on imparting practical skills to the students,   whereas the other argue for teaching knowledge per se.
```
- there exist  // === there are
- distinct // different // 明显的；独特的；清楚的；有区别的
- argue for // 主张
- primarily // mainly
- classifications of // === types of // === categories of
- per se // === itself //  === for its own sake //  -- `There is value in having knowledge for its own sake` [quora](https://www.quora.com/Is-there-value-in-having-knowledge-for-its-own-sake)
- imparting // impart 传授

`Interestingly,   both types of colleges are located in wealthy countries and developing countries respectively.`
```
- Interestingly
- respectively //  `are located in ... and ... respectively` 分别 `位于`

#### 2
```
China,   as a representative developing country,   has a great number of colleges that mainly focus on teaching skills,   and the course content is closely related to companies.
```
- as a representative developing country
- is closely related to
- mainly focus on

```
Universities are becoming increasingly like the factories that produce parts for the other factories,   rather than educational institutions that produce well-rounded individuals. 

```

- like factories // ==need rephase  `like the factories`.==
- for other factories // ==need rephase  `for the other factories`.==
- well-rounded individuals // 全面发展的个人
- are becoming increasingly like // 越来越像

#### 4
```
Students are trained to become cogs in the machine,   rather than critical thinkers who can contribute to society in meaningful ways.
```

- critical thinkers // 批判性的思想者
- machine // a part of the machinery
- cogs // 齿轮
- task of the students is // ~~the student is task for~~
- in meaningful ways // 以有意义的方式


#### 5
```
Although it may appear amusing,   this methodology of education functions effectively in China.
```

- it may appear amusing // 这可能看起来很有趣 // ~~it may seem funny~~,   口语化
- this methodology of education functions effectively in China // this method of education works fine in China 


#### 6
```
The students start working immediately after they graduate.
```
- immediately // ~~at once~~ 过于口语; 副词修饰 start
- graduate


#### 7
```
Otherwise,   in wealthy countries,   we would find many universities that avoid teaching skills directly. 
```
- Otherwise // Otherwi~~d~~se
- directly // d==aɪˈ==rektli
- 

#### 8
```
The courses frequently center around abstract notions,   with a primary emphasis on their significance and origins.
```
- center around // revolve around // 围绕…转动；以…为中心
- abstract notions
- emphasis // ˈemfəsɪs // 重点
- emphasis on // 强调
- significance // 意义
- 这些课程通常以抽象概念为中心,  主要强调它们的意义和起源.

```
But they explain less about how these concepts apply to specific jobs or how they transform into tangible value directly.
```
- transform into // 转化为
- tangible value // 有形价值
- apply to // ~~apply in~~
- specific // specif~~y~~ic // s==pəˈ==sɪfɪk
- directly // dəˈrektli // daɪˈrektli


#### 10
```
Hence,   an interesting phenomenon is that we often find it difficult to establish relations between the jobs of graduates and what they learned in college.
```

- establish relations between // ... 之间建立联系 // **establish relations** between // **establish connections** between. // **find the relationship** between. 
- interesting phenomenon is // 有趣的现象是
- difficult // diffic~~a~~ult




#### 11
```
This is because college provides broad,   theoretical knowledge that enables graduates to comprehend concepts and acquire skills independently,   rather than imparting specific vocational skills. 
```

- knowledge // ˈn==ɒ==lɪdʒ,   (习惯了读 ==no==)
- autonomy // 自主权; // === freedom // _more formal than **freedom**_ 
- choosing their paths // choosing their ~~way~~ paths
- independently // 独立地
- comprehend // intellectual comprehension // 智力理解 // 尽管 `understand` 这个词本身有很多哲学含义( _philosophical implications_),  但 **_Intellectual Comprehension_** 是在经过某种思考后形成一个想法或形成一种洞察力 (_insight_) .  ---- [quora](https://www.quora.com/Is-there-a-deeper-form-of-comprehension-than-intellectual-comprehension) 
- vocational skills // 职业技能
- theoretical // theo==re==tical 理论的 ~vs~ theological 神学的 // Theory ~vs~ Theology //  
- acquire // require(要求) ~vs.~ acquire(获得)



#### 12
```
Even more,   we are often surprised that graduates devise innovative approaches to achieve their goals,   rather than being limited to the existing methods they were directly taught.
```
- devise innovative approaches
- achieve their goals
- rather than // rather than **doing** x
- innovative // ˈɪnəveɪtɪv

#### 13
```
Naturally,   they require additional time to adapt to a job,   but companies in affluent countries demonstrate patience.
```
- Naturally // === Of course
- require // === need
- adapt to a job // === to fit a job
- a job // === a new role; 
- affluent // ˈæfluənt // 富裕的
- demonstrate patience // 表现出了耐心

#### 14
```
As mentioned above,   in my opinion,   the main function of an education system,   whether it leans towards knowledge and skills needed in the workplace,   depends on the developmental state of the country.
```
- and // ==need rephase using `or` rather than `and`.==
- above // `[əˈbʌv]`
- As mentioned above // 正如刚才提到的
- As I previously mentioned, … // previous vs. preview [[ErrorsPron🙊]] [[Done✅]] 
- leans // liːnz
- leans towards // === tend to // 偏向于
- developmental state // 发展状况
- occupations // occupancy 占用;居住 // occupation 占有,   占有期,   占领,   占领军
- unemployment rate // 失业率

#### 15
```
But in the digital period,   especially as AI technologies are widely applied in different areas,   more occupations appear to be replaced by machines due to the superior and reliable proficiency of artificial intelligence compared to that of humans. 
```
- are widely applied in // __ be  widely applied in __ areas
- occupations // 职业
- due to // 由于
- superior // suːˈpɪə.ri.ər // 卓越
- reliable // 可靠
- proficiency // 熟练程度
-  cn: 但在数字化时代,  特别是随着人工智能技术在各个领域的广泛应用,  由于人工智能相对于人类的优越性和可靠性,  更多的职业似乎被机器取代. 
- humans // human**s**

#### 16
```
This demonstrates a shift away from relying on human skills for production activities.
```
-  This demonstrates // === This indicates that 这表明
- a shift away from // no longer
- relying on // rely on // be based on


#### 17
```
 If an education system values knowledge intrinsically,   graduates will be better equipped for creative occupations and more effective in shaping the future.
```

- values // value vt.重视
- values knowledge intrinsically  
- If an education system values knowledge intrinsically // 如果教育体系本质上重视知识 //  ~~The graduates in wealthy countries~~. (这里用间接语言取代敏感并含偏见的描述)  
- equipped for // 准备好,   对...有准备 // be fully equipped for 整装待发 // === be more** suited for creative jobs
- occupations // === jobs
- shaping the future
- equip // vt. 装备,   配备

#### 存档
```
they have more autonomy in choosing their paths,   since the theoretical knowledge imparted enables intellectual comprehension of how to independently acquire skills even more find out a new path to achieve a goal,   eliminating dependence on the existed way that collage imparted.
```

- eliminating // === no longer,   but _more formal 
- comprehension // === understand
- dependence on //  `noun.` dependence  on  对 x 的依赖 // `verb.` depend on 依赖于
- intellectual comprehension // 智力理解 // 尽管 `understand` 这个词本身有很多哲学含义( _philosophical implications_),  但 **_Intellectual Comprehension_** 是在经过某种思考后形成一个想法或形成一种洞察力 (_insight_) .  ---- [quora](https://www.quora.com/Is-there-a-deeper-form-of-comprehension-than-intellectual-comprehension)
