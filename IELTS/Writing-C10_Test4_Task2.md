`Visiting a museum is a good path for how we learn from our ancestors. But,  today we may find that,  there are less young people would go to museum spend their weekend,  since they don't feel the exhibit in museum have any relations to their life. Additionally,  much of them have limited ability pay for the ticket,  even some of exhibition cost a lot to them. 

Hence,  someone attempt to establish relations between the young and museum via eliminating the payment of entry. But It opposed by many people. Mainly reason is resolve around the respect of heritages. First,  ticket is a effetely way to limit the flow of visitor for entrance of who with great need. Second,  we have responsibility to pay for the operation of a museum,  for example the charge of administers to handle order internal or maintenance of heritage etc. 

I'm a totally agree with that,  the heritage need a consist income for maintenance,  but charging is not the only way for a museum acquire fund for that. For example in 2014,  the Ministry of Culture Italy had issued a band to encourage Italy museum to create more restaurant,  gif shop and other visitors services in institutes. This is a good idea for supporting a possibility to open museum for free to public in future. More importantly,  it will make museum begin to focus on the collection inside the museum,  make profit increate the creation from heritage and people in today breve the value of  heritages.

In conclusion,  I suppose there are variety  of benefits if museum cut down the ticket or be free for public. no matter for the development of museum,  from education of young people,  even for the values of heritages.   `
