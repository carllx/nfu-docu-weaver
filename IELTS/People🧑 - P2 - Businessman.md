## Part 3

### 1-What factors lead to success ?

```markdown
The most important factor for a company's success is visionary and courageous leadership. 
```

```markdown
A good leader sets the company's direction and develops a strategy to achieve it. 
```

```markdown
They must be courageous and adventurous, willing to take risks and explore new paths.
```

```markdown
Also, I think they need to be well-versed in nature, human, and business ecosystems.
```

```markdown
To ensure the well-being of the natural ecosystem, effective leaders must possess the expertise to acquire and manage natural assets in a sustainable manner. 
```

```markdown
This involves understanding the interdependence of various resources and implementing policies that promote their responsible use.
```

```markdown
In terms of human ecosystem, Effective leaders must discern the deepest human needs and desires through relationships, and cultivate the best of human nature in all business activities.
```

```markdown
For the enterprise ecosystem, good leaders must be skilled in creating a company culture that enables employees to work together to achieve common goals.
```

### 2-What do people need to sacrifice for success ?

```markdown
To be successful, I don't think they will sacrifice just anything. 
```

```markdown
I think successful people acquire more resources than others. 
```

```markdown
One thing they may sacrifice though is close family ties and personal time to relax, which can be unhealthy.
```

- 人们为了成功需要牺牲什么 ?
- sacrifice
- close family ties // 亲密的家庭关系
- if I had to point out // if we must say so
- Entertainmen // 娱乐
- I lack time to spend with family. [[IELTS🎙️]] 
- lack //  /læk/ [[_IELTS⭐]]    




### 3-Which is more likely to be successful, family businesses or large corporations ?

```markdown
I think big companies will probably be more successful than family-owned businesses. 
```

```markdown
Family companies mainly care about their family's values, not what's best for the company. 
```

```markdown
The employees at a family company are more like workers for that family. 
```

```markdown
It's kind of like in imperialist countries, where regular people don't get much chance to contribute creative ideas or strategy. 
```

```markdown
But in a large corporation, employees can play a more important role, like in a democracy. 
```

```markdown
The values of a big company are more aligned with what's good for the employees in general.
```

- 家族企业和大型企业哪个更有可能成功公司 ?
- family businesses
- large corporations

### 4-Is it easy for a business to be successful without affecting the environment  ?
%% 1 %%
```markdown
Companies can't succeed without impacting the environment. 
```

```markdown
For example, they need to take natural resources to produce products that people need. 
```

```markdown
Even companies that don't use tangible resources can have a big impact on society. 
```

```markdown
For example, food delivery apps in China are so popular that sidewalks are now filled with delivery vehicles, making it difficult for pedestrians to walk.
```

```markdown
Our environment is increasingly becoming a factory, and it's not designed for the elderly.
```

### 6-What qualities should be considered when recruiting employees ?

```markdown
When recruiting candidates, there are several factors we should pay attention to:
```

```markdown
First, we must ensure the candidate's personality and values align with the company's culture.
```

```markdown
Second, we must ensure the reliability and accountability of the candidates - that they are responsible candidates who will be committed to their work.
```

```markdown
Third, candidates must have problem solving skills.
```

```markdown
We can assess candidates' thinking abilities in two areas - decision-making and task execution.
```

```markdown
For example, good decision-makers have critical thinking and innovative approaches to solve problems.
```

```markdown
And good task executors leverage vocational skills and experience to solve problems.
```

### 7-The Hidden Cost of Excessive Consumer Behavior

```markdown
In the past two decades, people have been hesitant to buy clothes online without knowing if they will fit.
```

```markdown
However, in recent years, e-commerce platforms have offered unconditional returns to stimulate consumption, which has led people to become accustomed to not considering fit.
```

```markdown
As a result, some people even buy multiple pieces of clothing at a time, only to return most of them.
```

```markdown
This excessive consumer behavior, which is an act of increasing human desire, is leading people to more disregard for others and the environment.
```

```markdown
While it may not cause a big loss to the individual consumer, it constitutes a waste of societal resources due to the frequent transportation required.
```
