## Plato

在[[Plato]]的视角里，"Shapeless"（无形）指的是一种存在于物理世界的容器或空间的本质，这种本质能够包容各种形态和外观。这种容器并非具体的物质实体，而是一种与空间相关的概念，它始终处于生成与消亡的循环之中，因而并不具有真正的实在性。理解这个容器的本质，并不是通过逻辑或理性，而是依赖于感官和想象力的普通推理。这是物理世界中物质多样性和复杂性的基础，因为容器为形态的合并与分离提供了可能。

The content refers to several concepts :
**"Shapeless" Concept**: “形而上”这个词指的是存在于物理世界中的一种基本本质，被描述为一种容器或空间，能够包含多种形态和外貌。

#### 我们视自然为容器（"Nature of the Container"）将塑造我们与之互动的方式：将其视为单纯的去处、资源来源、拟人化的存在或自我的一部分，决定了我们保护或开发它的态度。
(-- `Nature: container, object, person, self? - CC Foundation` [commoncausefoundation](https://commoncausefoundation.org/nature-container-object-person-self/))
**Nature of the Container**:  Nadine 认为，我们看自然的方式会影响我们对它怎么做。比如，如果你觉得自然是一个地方（"Nature of the Container"），可以进去呼吸新鲜空气，那你可能就会去旅行, 我们就认为是一个提供资源的地方；如果我们把大自然看成一个有生命的人([[Anthropomorphism]])，我们可能会更加珍惜和爱护它，不会轻易去伤害它，就像对待我们的朋友一样, 我们会更自然地和它相处。

最后，关于自然是一个“容器”的看法，实际上说明了我们把自然想象成一个生活空间，这个空间并非是实实在在的箱子，而是一个我们脑海中的抽象想法。随着我们思考方式的改变，这个空间也会变化，这意味着大自然在我们的心目中是有生命的，并且能够随着我们的时间及想法发生变化。

**Understanding through Sensory and Imagination**: 通过感官和想象力理解：把握这个容器的本质不是通过逻辑或理性手段实现的，而是通过依赖感官和想象力的普通推理来实现的。
**Foundation for Diversity and Complexity**: 这一概念被呈现为物质世界中多样性和复杂性的根基，为形态的融合和分离提供了可能性。




The shapeless is therefore the opposite of the form of shape, which is the perfect and eternal idea of shape that is intelligible and unchanging⁶. The shapeless is also different from the form of the shapeless, which is the idea of the absence of shape that is intelligible and unchanging⁶. The shapeless is the quality of the receptacle that makes it possible for the physical things to have shape or not, depending on the influence of the forms²⁵⁶.

所谓无形的，恰恰是形状形式的反面。形状形式是一种完美且永恒的形状理念，它是可以理解且不变的。而无形的，也不同于无形的形式，无形的形式是指缺乏形状这一概念，同样是可以理解和不变的。无形的是一种容器的特质，这使得物理事物能否有形状取决于形式的影响。

### Does Platonic solids have any significance for the theory of shape and shapeless?
[[Platonic solids]] have some significance for the theory of shape and shapeless, which is part of Plato's theory of forms⁶. According to this theory, the physical world is not as real or true as timeless, absolute, unchangeable ideas, or forms, that are the essences of all things⁴⁶. The physical world is only a shadow, or image, of the true reality of the realm of forms⁴.

Plato's theory of forms implies that there is a form of shape, which is the perfect and eternal idea of shape, and that all physical shapes are imperfect and changing imitations of this form⁶. Similarly, there is a form of shapeless, which is the idea of the absence of shape, and that all physical things that lack shape are imitations of this form⁶. Platonic solids, as regular and symmetrical polyhedra, are closer to the form of shape than other irregular and asymmetrical shapes, and therefore more real and true in Plato's view²⁶.

### The form of the shapeless for Plato
The form of the shapeless for Plato is the idea of the absence of shape, or the indeterminate⁶. Plato mentions this form in his dialogue Parmenides, where he argues that there must be a form of the shapeless, as well as a form of the one and a form of the many, in order to account for the possibility of change and difference in the physical world. Plato also suggests that the form of the shapeless is related to the concept of the receptacle, or the space, in which the physical things are shaped by the forms.

The form of the shapeless is one of the most difficult and controversial forms in Plato's theory, as it seems to contradict his view that the forms are perfect and unchanging⁶. Some scholars have interpreted the form of the shapeless as a negative or privative form, that is, a form that denotes the lack of something, rather than a positive or affirmative form, that is, a form that denotes the presence of something. Others have argued that the form of the shapeless is not a real form at all, but a logical or linguistic device that Plato uses to explain the diversity and multiplicity of the physical world.

## Aristotle
For Aristotle, emotions are not shapeless, but have a definite form and structure. Emotions are not mere sensations or impulses, but cognitive and evaluative responses to what we perceive as good or bad, noble or base, pleasant or painful, etc. Emotions involve some kind of mental image or impression of the object or situation that causes them, and they are directed at some object or situation by intention¹²³. Emotions also have specific causes and effects, and they can be classified into different types, such as anger, fear, pity, etc., according to their distinctive features and functions¹².

The concept of shapeless is more relevant to Aristotle's theory of change, which deals with the question of how things can come into being or cease to be, and how they can change their qualities or quantities⁴. Aristotle argues that change is possible because there is a potentiality or a capacity for change in things, and that this potentiality is actualized or realized by some agent or cause⁴. For example, a statue can be melted down into a shapeless pool of bronze, because the bronze has the potentiality to change its shape, and the heat is the cause that actualizes this potentiality⁴.

The concept of shapeless is also related to Aristotle's aesthetics, which is his theory of art and beauty. Aristotle argues that art is a form of imitation or representation, and that the aim of art is to produce pleasure and understanding in the audience⁶. Aristotle also distinguishes between different modes of imitation, such as tragedy, comedy, epic, etc., according to their different means, objects, and manners of representation⁶. Aristotle also analyzes the elements and principles of each mode of imitation, such as plot, character, diction, thought, spectacle, etc., and how they contribute to the artistic effect and value of the work⁶.
