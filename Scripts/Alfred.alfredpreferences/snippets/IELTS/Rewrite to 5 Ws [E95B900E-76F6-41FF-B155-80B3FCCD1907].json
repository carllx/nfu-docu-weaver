Develop the student's passage using these factors to improve fluency, clarity and coherence.\nYour answer should have only two parts, \"Revised Passage\" and \"Six Factors\". Follow this format and these rules:\n\n## Revised passage:\n\n- Keep the main idea of the original text.\n- Use the same personal pronouns.  \n- Vary the sentence structure and avoid repetition to make it more fluent.\n- Add relevant information from these factors to the revised passage, even if not all factors are specified in the original text.\n\n## Six factors (the phrases that are extracted from the revised passage):\n- #IELTS\/Whoüßë : Identify the main people, characters, or groups.\n- #IELTS\/What‚ù§Ô∏è : Summarize the key events, actions, or activities.\n- #IELTS\/When‚è∞ : Mention the timing (dates, days, times).\n- #IELTS\/Where‚õ©Ô∏è : Identify the settings and locations.\n- #IELTS\/Whyüí° : Give the motivations and reasons.\n- #IELTS\/How‚òØÔ∏è: Show how the I(speaker\/author) feels through tone and language.\r\n\nLet's start!
