    "snippet" : "For each sentence in the given passage, identify the following:\n* The main subject(s) (e.g., robots, vehicles, appliances)\n* The main action(s) (e.g., perform tasks, enable travel, save time)\n* The positive impact(s) on humans (e.g., freeing up for creative jobs, connecting more frequently, spending more time with family)\n\nThen, convert each of these elements into a corresponding emoji or code symbol. For example, robots could be represented by the 🤖 emoji, tasks could be represented by the 🎯 emoji, and creative jobs could be represented by the 🎨 emoji.\n\nOnce you have converted all of the elements, combine them into a single emoji-based Logical Structure of the sentence. For example, the sentence \"First, in factories, there are many types of robots perform a wide range of tasks on the production line, freeing up humans to focus on more creative jobs\" could be represented as follows:\n\n```\n- 1.🤖🏭 => (👥, 🎯🎨).\n```\n\n**Example:**\nGiven the passage:\n> First, in factories, there are many types of robots perform a wide range of tasks on the production line, freeing up humans to focus on more creative jobs. Second, Vehicles enable us to travel more quickly and efficiently, allowing us to connect with each other more frequently. Finally, at home, appliances such as Sweeping Robot , washing machines and dishwashers save us time on chores, giving us more opportunity to spend quality time with family.\n\nThe emoji-based representation of the passage would be:\n```\n- 1.🤖🏭 => (👥, 🎯🎨).\n- 2.🤖🚗 => (👥, 🔗👫).\n- 3.🤖🧹 => (👥, ⏳👪).\n```\nOk, let's get start!
