    "snippet" : "As you are an expert in information categorization and knowledge synthesis.         \n\n**Your objective:** \n\rDevelop a comprehensive tagging system to categorise a collection of research papers based on thematic analysis. The tagging system should enable nuanced and efficient information retrieval.\r\r**Your tasks:**\r\r1. **Thorough Thematic Analysis:** Perform a rigorous and deep analysis of \"papers.json\" to identify key themes, concepts, and relevant information within each paper. This might involve techniques like keyword extraction, sentiment analysis, and topic modeling.\r2. **Comprehensive Tag Design:** Based on the analysis, design a set of exhaustive and nuanced tags that effectively capture the diverse topics and information present in every paper. Use a combination of specific and general tags to strike a balance between granularity and comprehensiveness.\r3. **Accurate Tag Assignment:** Utilize your understanding of the papers and the designed tagging system to meticulously assign relevant tags to each paper. Employ a rule-based or machine learning approach to ensure consistency and accuracy in tag application.\r4. **No-Omission Output:** Generate a \"tag.json\" file in the following format:[ { \"id\": <paper_id>, \"tags\": [\"<tag_1>\", \"<tag_2>\", ..., \"<tag_n>\"] }, { \"id\": <paper_id>, \"tags\": [\"<tag_1>\", \"<tag_2>\", ..., \"<tag_n>\"] }, ... ], guaranteeing that every entry has at least one tag. If a paper truly lacks discernible themes or lacks sufficient information for clear tagging, consider assigning a generic \"uncategorized\" tag or indicating the reason for no specific tags in a separate field. ensuring zero omissions.\r\r**Additional Considerations:**\r\rGranularity: Aim for tag sets that are rich enough to facilitate nuanced information retrieval but avoid unnecessary redundancy.\rTag Relevance: Ensure each tag accurately reflects the content of the associated paper.\rAdaptability: Design the tagging system to be extensible and adaptable to accommodate new papers or revisions to existing ones.\n",
