    "snippet" : "Provide a comprehensive and structured summary of the given paper, encompassing the following elements:\nMain Point (M): Identify the central message or argument that the author is trying to convey. This should be a concise and clear statement that encapsulates the essence of the paper's thesis.\nSub-points (SP): Identify the supporting arguments or ideas that help to explain or elaborate on the main point. Each sub-point should be a specific and well-defined concept that contributes to the overall understanding of the paper's main message.\nSupporting Details (SD): For each Main Point or Sub-point, provide specific pieces of evidence or information that are used to support the Point and further solidify its connection to the main point. These details can include data, evidence, actual content, examples, and arguments to support their thesis. Each Supporting Detail should be accompanied by a proper MLA-style citation.\nOrganize the summary in a clear and concise format, using bullet points or numbered lists as appropriate. Aim for a succinct and informative presentation that effectively captures the essence of the paper.\n\nHere is an example of a summary of a paper using the requested format:\n\n**Main Point (M):** The concept of art as imitation of nature, or mimesis, has been a central theme in art theory and practice throughout history, influencing artists' approaches to representation and creativity.\n\n**Sub-points (SP):**\n\n1. **Origins of Mimesis in Ancient Greece:**\n    \n    - **Supporting Detail 1 (SD1):** The concept of mimesis emerged in ancient Greece, with Plato's theory of Forms, which posited that the physical world is an imperfect reflection of ideal Forms (Plato, Republic, Book X).\n        \n    - **Supporting Detail 2 (SD2):** Aristotle further developed the concept of mimesis, emphasizing the importance of imitating nature to produce art that is both truthful and aesthetically pleasing, and that conveys universal emotions and experiences (Aristotle, Poetics).\n        \n2. **Mimesis in the Renaissance:**\n    \n    - **Supporting Detail 1 (SD1):** During the Renaissance, artists such as Leonardo da Vinci and Michelangelo embraced mimesis as a fundamental principle of art, striving to achieve realism and create art that reflected the beauty and harmony of the natural world (Vasari, Lives of the Most Excellent Painters, Sculptors, and Architects).\n        \n    - **Supporting Detail 2 (SD2):** The development of the perspective technique during the Renaissance enabled artists to create more accurate representations of three-dimensional space, further enhancing the mimetic qualities of their work (Alberti, Leon Battista. On Painting).\n        \n3. **Mimesis in Contemporary Art:**\n    \n    - **Supporting Detail 1 (SD1):** While mimesis remains an influential concept in contemporary art, many artists have challenged and expanded its boundaries (Krauss, Rosalind E. \"The Origin of the Museum.\" October, vol. 5, no. 1, 1977, pp. 81-96).\n        \n    - **Supporting Detail 2 (SD2):** Some contemporary artists have explored the limits of mimesis, questioning the ability of art to truly represent reality, and highlighting the subjective and constructed nature of representation (Duchamp, Marcel. The Box in a Suitcase. 1941-1968).\n        \n    - **Supporting Detail 3 (SD3):** Other contemporary artists have employed mimetic techniques in innovative ways, creating works that are both realistic and conceptually challenging, inviting viewers to reconsider their perceptions of the world around them (Richter, Gerhard. Photo Paintings. 1962-present).",
