It's made of some exotic wood and it's very useful too. Nope, it's not a course about table but I'd like to show you some resources that could be useful. The first one is obviously \"The Animator's Survival Kit\" by Richard Williams. This is a classic. I guess all the animators have this book in their shelves, and to be perfectly honest, it doesn't get old. But you will find in there tons of lesson about the principles of animation and so many drawings that are still used to this date to teach animation. It also comes with a lot of stories about animation a few decades ago. But definitely, a must-have. The next book, which is one of my favorite is \"Drawn to Life\" by Walt Stanchfield. This is a book that was recommended to me by my animation mentor, Jeremy Collins, and while it's mostly focused on drawing, everything in there is appliable to animation, especially when it comes to staging and creating great poses. The last book I'd like to advise is a classic. It's \"The Illusion of Life\" from Frank Thomas and Ollie Johnston. Beyond the educational content, it's fascinating to learn stories about Disney, the studio that has almost created animation. While you don't need those book, I do believe that having them and reading them will really help you to dive into the art of animation.\n```\n\n在“01-03 Advised ressources”章节中，提到了三本关于动画原则的重要书籍，其中“Drawn to Life” by Walt Stanchfield 和 “The Illusion of Life” from Frank Thomas and Ollie Johnston 包含了关于动画12原则的讨论和图表。这些书籍被推荐为学习动画艺术的重要资源。",
