This study is the culmination of ideas, questions and observations that have been growing on me in the course of the last decade, and it would be contrary to the participatory ethos to claim them as entirely my own, although no one other than myself can be held responsible for their limitations.

I am grateful to the International Research Centre 'Interweaving Performance Cultures' at the Freie Universität in Berlin for a fellowship in 2014--15, which permitted me to write the bulk of this study. I thank all the colleagues and scholars at the Centre as well as the 'Aesthetics of Applied Theatre' Research Programme team for stimulating discussions and for their encouragement. I acknowledge the sabbatical leave periods and infrastructural support provided by the Amsterdam School of Cultural Analysis, the Amsterdam Centre for Globalisation Studies, the Netherlands Institute for Cultural Analysis and the Faculty of Humanities of the University of Amsterdam during various stages of research. I am grateful for the sustained support from colleagues at the University of Amsterdam, particularly in the Theatre Studies Department. My very special gratitude to Veronika Zangl for her patient reading and helpful feedback.

I would like to express my sincere appreciation to friends and colleagues from around the world who have helped me with comments, literature and suggestions on various aspects of the study, as well as inviting me to present work in progress: Aristita Albacan, B.

This study would not have been possible without the generosity and critical support of a number of artists and practitioners, whose work I deeply respect and hold in admiration. I thank Laia America Ribera Cañénguez and other members of Teatro Siluetas, Lina Issa, Aitana Cordero, Rebekka Reich, Oliver Gather, Radha Ramaswamy, Pilvi Takala, Walid Al-Alphy, Annette Krauss and Emily Schaeffer Omer-Man for help with sourcing documents and for their readiness to converse with me. Thanks also to all workshop participants and audience members who shared their personal experiences with me. Arjan Reinders' image of the small fish chasing the big fish aptly captures a participatory ethos for our times.

I am grateful to the peer reviewers at Manchester University Press, whose feedback on my first submission made me rewrite half the study, taking two more years in the process, pushing me to think through its core arguments with greater care.

I thank my parents Shri Devi and S. D. Bala, my aunt Lakshmi, my uncle, the late T. V. Subramanian, Ranganayaki (Paappakka), and my siblings Anand and Sharadha Smrithi for their unconditional affection and humour.

The mode of being of the new intellectual can no longer consist in eloquence, which is an exterior and momentary mover of feelings and passions, but in active participation in practical life, as constructor, organizer, 'permanent persuader' and not just a simple orator. (Gramsci, [1996](#bibliography.xhtml#ref85), p. 10)

**The paradox of participation**

What does it mean to participate in art beyond the pre-determined roles and options allocated to us? This is the question that the following study grapples with. The issue is at once current and a matter of long-standing debate. Following decades of critical discussion in the field of participatory art, it is not entirely unfair to say that the concept has been found to have reached a point of exhaustion. Yet we are living in times when it is necessary to work towards new concepts, with nothing else to hand but hopelessly inadequate and worn-out ones. Such concepts, seemingly self-evident and clearly defined, strangely become unwieldy when described, confusing when experienced, contradictory when subject to analysis. Their inadequacy may be a consequence of their being co-opted, misused, unmoored or simply unresponsive to the world they are meant to speak to. Yet they cannot be conveniently discarded and replaced with other terms, for the problem is of course neither a matter of terminology alone, nor one of mere inconvenience. There are concepts that insist on being rethought and reconstructed in as much as the discontent with them seems inseparable from the attachment and possibility they offer. Participation is one such concept, at once a source of artistic, social []{#introduction.xhtml#pg_2}and political hope and simultaneously the vulgar distortion of this hope into a form of profit-oriented governance and subjugation. The study joins the debate around participation at the stage of asking what next: what happens after or beyond the critique of the managerial absorption of participation, when neither grand theory nor the resort to particularism, neither the celebration of its utopian promises nor the criticism of its neoliberal disembowelment, seem to suffice. For even a critique of participation is predicated upon some form of participation, and even non-participation or any other category posited in its place remain equally fallible to the very same charges of critique.

Core to this investigation is the way in which the political premises underlying the call for participation are reimagined aesthetically. The questions that interest me most can be posed in different interconnected ways: first, how do artists and audiences respond to or take part in participatory art in unexpected, unscripted ways; how do the addressees of art take part in and partake of its making beyond the roles and options allocated to them? Second, in what ways does participatory art participate in civic, public life? These questions are interconnected by the vectors of participation. All attempts to answer one inevitably have to deal with the problems of the other. The question of an artwork's participation in public life is partly an expansion of the question of audience participation in art from the micro to the macro scale, since performance practices might, at one level, be viewed as microcosms of a broader social reality. They are not located outside of social reality, in a safely cordoned area marked as an aesthetic space, wherein they may reflect or represent the world outside, undisturbed or untouched by it; rather, these two dimensions are porous, connected by a vector shuttling back and forth between them, not merely transporting ideas from one dimension to the other, but affecting and transforming each of them in the process.

The present study undertakes an examination of participatory practices in contemporary theatre, performance and the visual arts, setting these against the broader social and political horizons of civic participation. It does not attempt to define the field as apparently given, but rather reconsiders the status of participation. My particular stake is in reflecting on participatory art both beyond a judgement of its social []{#introduction.xhtml#pg_3}qualities as well as beyond the confines of format and devising. I am specifically interested in how participatory art might contribute to delicately altering the terms and conditions of participation, as well as those moments in which the withdrawal or refusal of participation might function as a critical form of participation. I am concerned with the ways in which artistic or cultural thought-practices participate in the social bases they emerge from or respond to, in the unorthodox reformulation of participation.

There is growing interest in the field of participatory art, attested by a vast range of experimental practices in cultural, art, educational and developmental contexts, accompanied by a surge of recent publications on the subject, as well as by its expanding place in university curricula and in the agendas of professional organizations. There is an equally vehement rejection of participatory practices, particularly in relation to their disregard for respected conventions and modes of experience in the arts, but more broadly, in terms of their appropriation and dilution into contemporary models of neoliberal, entrepreneurial governance. The real or attempted transformations in the relations and conventions of interaction between artwork and viewer, between spectators and performers, between authorship and reception, are met with responses ranging from enthusiasm to dismissal. Such responses cannot be explained away as differences in taste or aesthetic judgement, or liberally mediated through mid-way positions, as if it were only a matter of the right dosages of participation; they need to be contextualized and examined across diverse domains. I attempt a cross-disciplinary discussion of participation, bringing together examples from the field of applied and community theatre, performance art and participatory visual arts, investigating points of intersection with existing discussions in the social sciences on participation. Being a contextual question, the appraisal of the category of participatory art, in this wide sense, is accompanied by dangers even in modest generalization. Different disciplines have distinct institutional, epistemological and political stakes in their various conceptions of participation. I use the term participatory art as an umbrella term, yet I do so, not in order to insist on the stability of the category as a genre or defined form, but rather in order to problematize it and dwell on its antinomies, contingencies and []{#introduction.xhtml#pg_4}contradictory features. I contend with the loaded term 'art', although the disciplinary formations and perspectives guiding my own journey are undeniably located in theatre and performance studies. Despite my repeated desire to expand the field, there are many kinds of participatory practices that I do not discuss at all, from participatory rituals in cultural performances to participation in the virtual electronic sphere. It is easy to offer the disclaimer that these are left out for the sake of providing an achievable framework for the study, but more difficult to retain a peripheral awareness of the ways their inclusion might have complicated its findings and constitutive frames.

The theorization of participation in the arts faces the challenge of transposing a concept with roots in the economic-political arena on to imaginative terrains. The Oxford English Dictionary cites the earliest usages of the term 'participation' in terms of two closely interlocked regimes: commerce and theology. Participation refers to 'commercial involvement in a company enterprise' on the one hand, as well as 'sharing in, or partnership or communion' on the other. 'Taking', 'giving' and 'having' seem to be the crucial connecting verbs here. Participation in the commercial sense became common in the late seventeenth century with reference to a financial involvement in a commercial enterprise. The much older Latin-derived theological use of participation dates back to the twelfth century, referring to being a recipient of or partaking in an act of divinity. In English the term flows between the connotations of taking part in or contributing to something, having a part or a share, in the form of ownership or territorial demarcation, or being (given) a part of or in something larger than what is one's own, staking a claim, pledging alliance. Many languages employ a nominalized form of the verb 'to take part' and distinguish between participation in the sense of 'taking part', which is usually the mere statement or assertion of participation, and 'having a part' or 'acquiring a part', suggesting a more active claim.^[1](#introduction.xhtml#fn1){#introduction.xhtml#ft1}^ The term can thus be used descriptively as well as in the form of a demand of an entitlement, or indeed as an assertion of belonging to a greater common social entity. Participation could be a means towards a defined end, or an end in itself. It speaks to the forms and modalities of interaction between individuals and social entities, religious institutions or public goods, sometimes acting as []{#introduction.xhtml#pg_5}a descriptor of these modalities and at other times placing demands on them.

Translated broadly to the arts, the notion of participation primarily indicates a realignment of the relationship between the makers and the recipients of the arts, whereby the 'recipients', however defined, stake a claim to or assume a share in the enterprise of the arts. It is further underwritten by a general assumption that this realignment is beneficial or desirable for the arts and for the wider contexts in which they are located. These points of departure already demonstrate that ideas about participation in the arts remain indebted to its origin in the powerful discourses of shareholding participation in commerce and the provenances of participation in community formation. Just as the idea of shareholder participation marked the transition in ownership from feudalism to a bourgeoisie or a state-led economy, so participatory artistic practices might be regarded as reflecting a transition from the primacy of the artist as creator genius and sole proprietor of an artwork to an economy of redistributing authorship and creative functions in the arts. Just as the idea of participation in a societal sense indicates affiliation to a community or a shared idea, so participation in art might be indicative of a model of shared, dialogical and empathetic artistic practice. Yet the grafting of these discourses on to the artistic terrain is not without its difficulties and contradictions. If participation makes art more democratic, more social, more useful and relational, what remains then of the Kantian 'purposiveness without a purpose', so often regarded as the defining characteristic of the aesthetic realm? If participation in art is benign *a priori*, what remains to be interpreted or critically appreciated? If the terms of participation are already set by such authoritative forces, then doesn't participation in the arts require the greatest vigilance?

Artistic practices seem to have responded to these quandaries with an explosively wide range of different interpretations of participation: devised works involving scripted and stylized audience participation, as in immersive performances^[2](#introduction.xhtml#fn2){#introduction.xhtml#ft2}^ or live art;^[3](#introduction.xhtml#fn3){#introduction.xhtml#ft3}^ those that manipulate or steer the public or intervene in a situation without the public necessarily realizing that they are participants, as in invisible theatre;^[4](#introduction.xhtml#fn4){#introduction.xhtml#ft4}^ delegated performance,^[5](#introduction.xhtml#fn5){#introduction.xhtml#ft5}^ where members of the public are specially selected or invited to take part in the artwork or performance; []{#introduction.xhtml#pg_6}socially engaged community-based artistic practices; and projects that highlight the collaborative process of interaction and dialogue between artists and the public during various stages of the work, not necessarily only at the stage of its final presentation.^[6](#introduction.xhtml#fn6){#introduction.xhtml#ft6}^ They may be short- or long-term, with spectators contributing spontaneously to an ephemeral event, or involve people from neighbourhoods or local communities, as hosts, interview partners, contributors of material, or in playing roles. Live and virtual events involving question-and-answer sessions, direct conversations between artists and audience members, interactive installation-based presentations, performances that involve following instructions on headphones and making dance moves in the street, a museum exhibition inviting visitors to donate items of their own, collective readings, video games that generate scenarios based on images uploaded by players, intermedial storytelling events, do-it-yourself or, for that matter, don't-do-it-yourself artworks, citizen journalism, peoples' juries, crowd-sourced works, community kitchens, flash mobs, audio-tours, bus trips, assemblies, marketplaces, speed-dates, lottery draws, reality shows, visits to the homes of strangers: the list of means of invoking and inviting participation in and through artworks can hardly be exhaustively categorized, as this risks becoming outdated, with new formats emerging in response to distinct circumstances. The category of participatory art is thus by no means confined to the literal fact of audiences taking part in an artwork. It remains pliable and is, as has often been pointed out, invoked for very different ends and in very contradictory ways (Nicholson, [2013](#bibliography.xhtml#ref140), p. 114). 'Participation' can refer to many types of experiences; it is a historical rather than a static concept, implying that participatory art is not unified by formal characteristics, and can be traced to vastly divergent art-historical traditions (Kraynak, [2007](#bibliography.xhtml#ref121), p. 231). It can be a manner of doing, a manner of perceiving, and a manner of perceiving doing.

I do not attempt a systematic or historical analysis of participatory art as a genre, since I am less invested in outlining the possible terms or criteria of genre formation, and more intrigued by the questions that participatory art, when posed as genre, is seen as being able to ask or address: problems related to its institutional affiliations and entanglements, the question of its societal impact, the hierarchies []{#introduction.xhtml#pg_7}of participation, the relationship between embodied and discursive articulations of participation, the relationship between participation and non-participation. By emphasizing the operations that participatory art practices are used to carry out, I follow the insight of the cultural theorist Raymond Williams, who argued that certain concepts are not understood by way of a genre or terminological discussion, i.e. by analysing and comparing different definitions according to the presence or absence of certain formal traits, but that the meanings of a given concept are 'inextricably bound up with the problems it was being used to discuss' ([1983](#bibliography.xhtml#ref207), p. 15). Williams thus questions the assumption that concepts such as culture are expressions of, or indeed determined by, broader economic, social and political forces; instead he proposes culture as a form of material production. In the following I mobilize Williams's proposition as a way of understanding how the operations and vocabularies of participation in the arts are intermeshed with participation in the social and political sense. To do this, it is necessary to closely examine how artistic practices interpret and give life to the concept of participation in historically and contextually specific ways. These might be at the level of formal experimentation, or in the ways in which the artistic practice interacts with or intervenes in a given social environment, or in the mode of navigating the boundaries between the aesthetic and the non-aesthetic, the artistic and the quotidian. In this regard, I do not make a distinction between an active, oppositional, antagonistic participation and a passive, receptive, cohesive (non)-participation, nor do I try to monitor what is or is not a properly participatory form of art (Harpin and Nicholson, [2017](#bibliography.xhtml#ref93)). Applause, audience laughter, silence, passing interactions between performers and spectators may all be part of any form of audience participation in the broadest sense. I am interested in moments when such phenomena become foundational to a certain artistic practice, when such seemingly ordinary participatory gestures carry an unexpected potential for realigning the terms of participation.

The question of this study arises from a paradox. The demand for participation intensifies when participation is denied to us. Yet we are inclined to refuse participation when it is demanded of us. If we are only able to participate in ways that are already deemed acceptable []{#introduction.xhtml#pg_8}or proper, then, sooner or later, our participation becomes an instrument of our own subjugation and pacification rather than a means of freedom. Participation, even in the guise of non-participation, becomes necessary to resist the imperative of participation. The visual cultural philosopher Eyal Weizman elegantly describes the paradox of participation as 'the problem of equally practicing it and avoiding it' ([2011](#bibliography.xhtml#ref201), p. 10). Participatory art is by no means exempt from this paradox. In some senses one might claim that the field of participatory art emerges historically from artistic relations to the paradox of equally seeking out and disavowing participation.

**Divergent legacies of participatory art**

The examples analysed in this study are drawn from three main domains of participatory art: applied or community-based performance, immersive performance and contemporary visual art. These domains each evoke distinct genealogies and modes of conceptualizing participation, and they each have their own milestones as reference points. The question of the histories of participatory artistic practices becomes complicated for several reasons: the diversity of practices, different understandings of concepts, their vastly different disciplinary routes, national and regional differences, as well as distinctive processes of institutionalization. To summarily and ahistorically leave aside these differences and gather any and every artistic or cultural practice in which participation plays a role under the rubric of 'participatory art' can be misleading, risking that the term disintegrates rather than expands as a result of its diversity and ubiquity. Yet the diversity of genealogies of participatory art itself demonstrates that participation in relation to theatre and performance has meant many different things in different historical moments, and that it is a polyvalent category. Participatory practices may be found in all regions and across all historical periods or artistic domains, but this does not mean that participatory art becomes a universal category. The qualities and characteristics associated with participatory art are nevertheless historically bound. This history might be usefully approached not in terms of points of origin but in terms of how participatory practices have been regarded as offering possibilities for []{#introduction.xhtml#pg_9}realigning the relationship of art to society. This too needs qualification, as the very idea of art being separate from the societal has its own history and geography. What are the specific disciplinary concerns around participation in each of the domains of community-based art, immersive performance and contemporary visual arts? What are the recurring questions to which participatory practices have appeared as offering responses?

Reading across these domains, it is remarkable that scholarship on participation in one sub-field does not necessarily take notice of developments in other sub-fields. Participatory forms of educational theatre tend to be assumed to belong to a different discursive universe from one-to-one experiential performance practices or the participation of visitors in a museum installation. Yet in the process of researching this study, I became aware of a significant number of common concerns between these domains. In terms of their histories, what stands out most are the zigzag currents that run between artistic experimentation and processes of social-political transformation, or, as political philosopher Gerald Raunig has argued, of 'practices emerging in neighbouring zones, in which transitions, overlaps and concatenations of art and revolution become possible for a limited time, but without synthesis and identification' ([2007](#bibliography.xhtml#ref153), pp. 17--18). The idea that participatory practices emerge from 'neighbouring zones' or from the thresholds between artistic and social-political concerns is fitting. Their objectives may vary, from a more pragmatic search for alternatives to frontal narrative staging devices to an explicitly political search for ways to alter the grammar of people's relations to issues of significance to the broader society (Katsiaficas, [2004](#bibliography.xhtml#ref114)). In some cases, the need for participatory work is motivated by a striking selfconsciousness and desire to reflect on artists' positionality and privileges, to call attention to the assumptions underlying certain forms of presentation and representation, possibly through an awareness of feminist, postcolonial and anti-racist critiques and demands for a selfconscious avowal of art's interdependence and inseparability from its external conditions (Jackson, [2008](#bibliography.xhtml#ref110), pp. 143--144). In other cases, the choice of participatory forms may be a trendy mirroring of modes of participation in economic life, characterized by a feverish quest for the new, the innovative, the risky (Raunig, Ray and Wuggenig, []{#introduction.xhtml#pg_10}[2011](#bibliography.xhtml#ref154)). The intersections between historical and artistic periods are uneven but not accidental. They make it evident that the meaning of participatory art, or what is defined as participatory, radically changes under different historical circumstances, and that these meanings are usually part of a larger narrative of how art engages with society and politics (Bishop in Barok, [2009](#bibliography.xhtml#ref14)).

The grand question of the relationship between art and society and politics can be framed in slightly more modest terms as the relationship between artists or artistic practices and audiences. In the field of applied or community-based theatre and performance, the concern with questions of popular participation and theatrical citizenship in the twentieth century is often traced to Bertolt Brecht. For Brecht, the realignment of the relationship between performers and spectators was simultaneously a reimagining of the relationship of art to society. He envisaged the critical participation of audiences in theatre as a means of transforming the merely entertaining or 'culinary' functions of art. For Brecht, it was less a matter of making audiences get up from their seats and 'do' something and more a question of altering the dramaturgy of theatre in order for audiences to adopt a different attitude (*Haltung*). Similarly, political theatre cultures around the world in the second part of the twentieth century looked for a theatrical language and an aesthetic that could be adequate to the realities of nation formation following the end of colonial rule. Participatory practices often formed the zone of concatenation or overlap between the quest for modernity and the quest to recover lost traditions. The antecedents of participatory performance in the domain of community-based and applied arts can be traced to what Eugene van Erven calls the 'counter-cultural, radical, anti- and post-colonial, educational and liberational theatres of the 1960s and 1970s' ([2001](#bibliography.xhtml#ref197), p. 1). This might pertain to both the post-independence political theatres in the Global South as well as to the surge of performance art, happenings and artistic activism in European and North American contexts. They each have their own distinct legacies, but can all be termed participatory in terms of their quest for artistic forms that could accommodate a variety of modes of participation that were not necessarily pre-determined by the makers of the artworks alone.

[]{#introduction.xhtml#pg_11}Similar modes of expanding participation can be found in the transactions between theatre, therapy, education, labour, civil rights or ecological struggles. In the field of educational theatre, for instance, theatrical histories and educational histories converge in specific ways, demonstrating how educational theatre movements in different parts of the world placed audience participation at the centre of theatrical practices, developing 'innovative methodologies that blurred the boundaries between audiences and performers' (Nicholson, [2011](#bibliography.xhtml#ref139), p. 199). In many instances this involved forging long-term alliances with counter-cultural movements, to be able to pursue educational goals even in times of authoritarian rule, travelling and performing widely, conducting workshops, inviting writers in local languages to contribute plays or co-creating works on socially relevant topics (Fernandez, [1996](#bibliography.xhtml#ref74); Roces and Edwards, [2010](#bibliography.xhtml#ref164), p. 45). Participation here is as much about taking theatre to rural or urban-peripheral community life as about inviting young adults to participate in and be exposed to art workshops.

In the terrain of immersive performance, the threshold between artistic and social-political concerns is often to be found in the highlighting of the individual spectator and of the stylized and intimate one-to-one encounter with its visceral, multi-sensorial dimensions (Machon, [2013](#bibliography.xhtml#ref128); White, [2012](#bibliography.xhtml#ref202)). In a broader disciplinary genealogy, branching out to cultural anthropology, an immersive experience can be said to refer to a range of cultural practices, involving an intense, engrossed physical and emotional presence of all concerned, often taking place outside of art institutions and spaces (Singer, [1959](#bibliography.xhtml#ref177); Turner, [1975](#bibliography.xhtml#ref195)). Each of these understandings of immersive performance points to important distinctions and separate histories. Their contours and their terminology have evolved differently according to region or art-historical tradition. The emphasis on the individual experience of the spectator might, on the one hand, be derived from the post-dramatic and performative turns in the arts, i.e. a shift away from textual, dramatic sources towards embodied performance, to the extent that the turn away from the text is also always a turn towards the audience (Lehmann, [2005](#bibliography.xhtml#ref125), p. 5). In doing away with the authority of the dramatic text and with narrative devices, post-dramatic forms such as immersive performance elicit an alternative dramaturgy of []{#introduction.xhtml#pg_12}addressing the audience, often deliberately involving spectators in the action on stage, bringing them into close physical contact with the staged environment, or directly evoking 'the real' in the framework of theatrical action. There is no longer any security of the performance being a fictional event in the mode of the 'as-if' (Lehmann, [2005](#bibliography.xhtml#ref125), p. 103). This might be accompanied by a disregard for the solemnity of theatrical conventions, with the spectatorial distance being substituted by a staged environment suggesting a party, rehearsal atmosphere, an intimate setting, or a shared or quasi-ritualistic space into which audiences can enter, as if entering a space of leisure and relaxation (Lehmann, [2005](#bibliography.xhtml#ref125), pp. 122--123).

In what has come to be known as performance art since the 1960s, participation assumes the specific sense of a multi-directional, multi-sensorial and visceral communication between performers and spectators in a highly stylized setting that troubles the boundary between the artistic and the quotidian spheres. In the anthropological genealogies of immersive cultural performances, on the other hand, this boundary crossing has been expressed through the concept of the liminal. Victor Turner ([1975](#bibliography.xhtml#ref195)) used the architectural notion of the limen, the threshold or sill linking one space to another, as a concept for thinking the process and site of creating a sense of 'communitas' between people, especially in rituals marking rites of passage such as initiation rites or sacred ceremonies and performances. Such liminal events demand a participatory immersion of all concerned for a specific period of time within a dedicated space, allowing for a transition or transformation from one life stage to another.^[7](#introduction.xhtml#fn7){#introduction.xhtml#ft7}^

The border between the space demarcated as aesthetic space and the world it is surrounded by can move in ways that affect the registers of participation. Modes and conventions of performance can, for instance, be brought to bear upon legal and political settings, as a medium for staging political transformations and events of public participation. Examples of this are the profoundly theatrical frames of historical events such as the Truth and Reconciliation Commission in South Africa (Cole, [2009](#bibliography.xhtml#ref54)), or the public gatherings and participatory actions in the 1990s of groups such as H.I.J.O.S in Argentina following the years of military dictatorship (Holmes, [2009](#bibliography.xhtml#ref99); Taylor, [2003](#bibliography.xhtml#ref182)). Not only is the border between theatrical action and legal-political []{#introduction.xhtml#pg_13}action called into question in such phenomena, but also the distinct separation of the spheres of production and reception or of performance and spectatorship are troubled.

The legacy of participation in the visual arts reveals yet another kind of entanglement between artistic and social-political spheres. The demand for a radical break with elitist art institutions at the beginning of the twentieth century brought with it a wide range of experiments and programmatic shifts, often deploying participatory practices and attempting to reach out to people in their everyday lives. Tom Finkelpearl argues that the prominence of participatory forms in what he terms public art emerged from a confluence of local political struggles and international influences ([2013](#bibliography.xhtml#ref75), p. 49). In the case of the Futurists and Paris Dada, the invocation of the participatory generated what was then a radical break with traditional formats of spectatorship, through performances on the streets or the adoption of popular entertainment forms (Bishop, [2012](#bibliography.xhtml#ref25), p. 47). In Central and South America in the 1960s and 1970s, participatory artistic practices called for an engagement with marginalized social groups and people without a voice in public life. Similarly, in Asian and African contexts, it implied close ties between artists and civil rights and nation-building movements, as well as with feminist and indigenous movements. In Eastern Europe in the 1970s and 1980s, under the conditions of the Cold War, an engagement with participation was a matter of establishing trustworthy publics, who were not allied with the ruling powers (Bishop, [2012](#bibliography.xhtml#ref25), p. 130). In the post-1989 context, under expanding privatization and economic liberalization, the valorization of participatory technologies and formats in the art world can be regarded as complementary to a governmental biopolitics, where participation may not be a staking of a people's claim to ownership or control but a form of government through self-regulation (Lorey, [2012](#bibliography.xhtml#ref126), pp. 52--53). In this context, participation becomes not what people demand from the ruling powers but what is demanded of the people by the ruling powers.

This sketch of the different routes through which the notion of participation is summoned, spanning across the visual arts and theatre and performance, is by no means sufficient to make any comparative historical claims. Yet this much is immediately evident: the []{#introduction.xhtml#pg_14}antecedents of participatory art in the twentieth century can be read as accounts of how art positions itself in response to societal questions around participation. Instead of looking for overarching commonalities in form and expression in all these instances, one could turn the tables and ask what participatory art sets itself apart from, or to what questions it proposes itself as having answers. To what can the emergence of a participatory aesthetic be seen as responding? Viewed from this angle, the legacies of participatory art do not reflect or mirror their social environments but rather diffract them, at best attempting to offer a critique, intervene in shifting the underlying tenets of the field, and at worst, making the neoliberal socio-economic underpinnings blatantly apparent (Haraway, [2004](#bibliography.xhtml#ref92), p. 70).

The metaphor of diffraction is applicable to a genealogical appraisal of participatory art in so far as the claim to and justification of a certain conception of participation simultaneously marked a distancing or differentiation from existing conventions or understandings. Brecht's participatory learning plays (*Lehrstücke*) were propounded as a move away from what was perceived as the bourgeois convention of segregating spectators and performers, or directors and actors. Similarly, Augusto Boal's concept of the 'spect-actor' -- the spectator who intervenes on stage as an actor -- was proposed as a system of dissociation from the Aristotelian conception of the theatre. The performative turn that strongly influenced participatory performance art represented a turn away from the primary emphasis on texts and language in humanities scholarship and a turn towards embodied knowledge and practice, thus a reconception of the boundary between the sphere of artistic production and reception, as well as an expansion of the scope of performance outside of institutionalized artistic realms. The happenings and activist performance art of the 1960s marked a significant departure from conventional assumptions of what constitutes an artwork, foregrounding process and ephemeral experience in place of a finished work. A call for non-hierarchical and collective artistic working processes was often born out of the impulse to critically counter institutional frameworks that positioned the artist as creative genius and unique author. An antagonistic, dissenting form of artistic participation often grew out of a rejection of the cynicism of a top-down promotion of participatory citizenship. []{#introduction.xhtml#pg_15}Philosophical or political questions thus become diffracted on to the register of the aesthetic. This partly explains why it is difficult to pinpoint the characteristics of participatory art as a genre or in formal terms, for even when issues such as engagement with audiences or spectatorship might appear as a common feature of all participatory artforms, the form of this engagement with spectatorship can vary from the affirmative to the adversarial, or from an assertion of artistic autonomy to a complete rejection of any autonomy.

**The gestures of participation**

In the process of working on the concept of participation in, through and away from its exhaustion, other concepts unexpectedly emerge as helpful friends. In this study, the notion of the gesture has proven most valuable in comprehending the paradoxes of participation, whereby the demand for it is almost always accompanied by its refusal. I argue that participatory practices are best appreciated in the register of the gestural. As a unit of theatrical or performative action, the gesture is simultaneously an expression of an inner attitude as well as a social habitude. It extends beyond the stage of theatre or performance into the sphere of civic life. It therefore offers a possibility for critically linking the legacies and aesthetic debates on participatory art to larger issues of citizenship, democratic praxis, collective action and social justice. I also propose that the concept of the gesture not only speaks to the contemporary problems and critiques of participation, but also situates these practices in disciplinary terms at the juncture between the visual and performing arts. I envisage this possibility by a reading of the concept of gesture as situated in between image, speech and action, no longer image but not yet act, not strictly within the coordinates of language but also not wholly external to it. I suggest that the concept of gesture might be a rewarding way of theorizing participatory practices at the crossroads of the visual and performing arts. Such a conceptualization can, I hope, avoid two common pitfalls in scholarship on participatory art, namely the problem of explaining participation through assessing and measuring impact on the one hand, or, conversely, the problem of restricting the discussion to formal, aestheticized, medium-specific lines on the other.

[]{#introduction.xhtml#pg_16}The concept of the gesture has proven productive in engaging with the unsolicited, unruly and counter-intuitive aspects of participation that continually intrigue me in this study. As a unit of theatrical or performative action, usually defined as a stance or movement of the body as a whole or a specific body part, it is simultaneously an expression of an emotional condition or an inner attitude, as well as a social habitude. It thus extends beyond the stage of theatre or performance into the sphere of public, civic life. It is a concept derived from aesthetic theory, referring to a central component of the body, language and cultural communication, and simultaneously a concept with social and political ramifications (Mauss, [1973](#bibliography.xhtml#ref132); Wulf and Fischer-Lichte, [2010](#bibliography.xhtml#ref208)). A wide array of philosophical reflections on gesture, both in continental European philosophy as well as in several non-Western traditions, support such a multi-layered understanding of the concept as simultaneously embodied and abstract, physical and social, provisional and indicative in its enactment and embodiment, but never fully determined by it. While it would be impossible to offer anything close to a comprehensive review within the framework of this study, I have drawn inspiration from different sources to suggest how participatory art is characterized by gestural qualities. The Brechtian notion of the *Gestus* is one such source, understood as a physical manner of carrying or bearing the body that is equally a social attitude, theorized and sharpened in Walter Benjamin's indispensable companion essay on Brecht's gestures (Benjamin, [1966](#bibliography.xhtml#ref20); Willett, [1974](#bibliography.xhtml#ref206)). My mobilization of the concept of gesture is also close to recent approaches to cultural activism, especially scholarship on civic protest. To give one example: in a special issue of *Contemporary Theatre Review* entitled 'Theatre, Performance and Activism: Gestures towards an Equitable World', a number of contributions employ gesture 'as a pivot for examinations of the body in protest' (Hughes and Parry, [2015](#bibliography.xhtml#ref102), p. 302). The editors categorize these into a range of 'gestural repertoires', namely gestures intersecting the public and the private realms, gestures of labour and care work, gestures of mobility and migration, and collective gestures (2015, p. 309). While I do not directly employ such gestural repertoires, they resonate with my reading of participatory art to the extent that they indicate a constant shuttling between art's aesthetic and []{#introduction.xhtml#pg_17}sociopolitical dimensions, and the intersections between individual and collective forms of embodiment.

While the concept of the gesture speaks to the contemporary problems and critiques of participation, it also crucially situates these practices in disciplinary terms at the juncture between the visual and performing arts. Shannon Jackson keenly observes in her study *Social Works* ([2011](#bibliography.xhtml#ref111)) that the experiments of crossing the deemed limits of the aesthetic and the social have very different expressions across various domains of the arts. Whereas participatory art in the visual art context seeks out tropes, figures and methods from the performing arts, it can be conversely observed that participatory theatre and performance practices, especially in the institutionalized circuits, increasingly look for inspiration in installation, film, architectural and conceptual art. Jackson rhetorically describes this phenomenon as

an experimental chiasmus across the arts: a movement toward painting and sculpture underpins post-dramatic theatre, but a movement toward theatre also underpins post-studio art. In such a chiasmus, breaking the traditions of one medium means welcoming the traditions of another. ([2011](#bibliography.xhtml#ref111), p. 6)

The rhetorical figure of the chiasmus (literally, 'crosswise arrangement') is characterized by two distinct clauses balanced against each other by a structural reversal. The reference to a chiasmus suggests that the aesthetics of participatory art might be located somewhere at the juncture between the visual arts and the performing arts; or in other words, if one would simplify these domains to their very basic units, at the intersection between the *image* and the *act*. Theatre and performance theory as well as art history have a concept for this intersection: the concept of the gesture. In comparison to the static image or the tableau, the gesture is a dynamic concept: it indicates a transition, often involving a bodily movement, literally a gesticulation, which bears or suggests meaning (from the Latin *gestare*, to carry or bear, German *Gebärde*), and marks a socially recognizable form of conduct (from the Latin *gerere*, to conduct oneself). On the other hand, in comparison to the theatrical unit of the act, gesture can be read as a static concept: it is a condensation or decomposition of an act, close to the term 'gist', i.e. essence. It is no longer an image, but not yet quite an act; it is an act that is condensed into a hint, a suggestion.

[]{#introduction.xhtml#pg_18}By framing participatory art as gestural, as more than an image or a representation, yet not quite an act or action -- rather as an indicative, decomposed, interrupted move that extends beyond itself -- I suggest that the concept of gesture might be a rewarding way of theorizing participation. Perhaps the force of the participatory lies not in a causal relationship between audience participation in the theatre and people's participation in civic life, but in a relationship of simultaneity, one gesturing (to) the other. The sociologist Marcel Mauss proposed in his [1935](#bibliography.xhtml#ref132) essay entitled 'The Techniques of the Body' that the relationship of physical gestures to the social is not successive but simultaneous ([1973](#bibliography.xhtml#ref132), pp. 85--86). An individual bodily technique of walking or making a fist is, he argues, a gesture that is simultaneously corporeal and social-cultural. As I move in this study from broader discussions of institution or social impact to observing concrete moments of delicate participation or categorical refusals of participation, I am interested in how representation and movement, a given form and an imagined form, are interconnected through gesture, how the interdependence between formal and informal gestures of participation is performed and made observable.

The word gesture is also etymologically related to the Latin word *jacēre*, 'to lie', in the sense of ordering or arranging parts of the body, in support of and giving shape to a thought or attitude. In this sense, gestures often have the role of supporting thoughts through bodily movements rather than representing actions on their own. This is most often claimed in relation to the hand or facial gestures that accompany speech. In Giorgio Agamben's reading, gesture has no relationship to causality or utility; it is a means without ends and because it is removed from any use or representational function, it can allow us to see what otherwise becomes invisible when attached to referentiality (Agamben, [1993](#bibliography.xhtml#ref2)). Gesture thus involves the disruption or interruption of an action, its breaking down into repeatable and quotable units that conceal as much as they reveal (Benjamin, [1966](#bibliography.xhtml#ref20); Weber, [2008](#bibliography.xhtml#ref198), p. 98). They can range from being codified, ritualized and culturally specific to being expressive, free, emotive and non-formalizable. This oscillation between the formal, codified characteristics of the gesture and its informal, interstitial articulations is repeatedly found in artistic practices that pursue participatory methods []{#introduction.xhtml#pg_19}or aims. Rather than claiming any absolute subversive potential of participatory practices, I argue for interpreting participation in performance as a provisional and suggestive, but never fully determined element. These gestures of participation in performance, however, indicate possibilities for reconfiguring civic participation in public spaces in unexpected ways, putting less emphasis on direct opposition and instead seeking a variety of modes of resisting co-optation, through unsolicited, vicarious or delicate gestures of participation. Sometimes the performance of a gesture is merely symbolic, at other times gesture may become event (Butler, [2014b](#bibliography.xhtml#ref44)).

**Outline of this study**

How, then, does one study the gestures of participatory art? Where are they to be found and traced? The cases examined in this book are drawn from my own horizon of exposure in the last decade, which can in no way claim to be comprehensive in scope or international outreach, but which nevertheless reflects the privilege of living in and moving between different countries and cultures, from which I have benefited in countless ways. The choice of these cases is most pertinently related to the possibilities available to me, allowing me to become familiar with the projects in some depth, and to gain the trust, support and intellectual camaraderie of those involved, which has proven indispensable to the study.

[Chapter 1](#chapter01.xhtml) begins with the question of institutional critique in relation to participatory art. What is the place of institutional critique in relation to participatory performance? Where might institutional critique be located and how is it practised? I reflect on the challenges and conundrums of institutional critique, exploring the formation of participatory art forms, specifically community-based, applied art, as emergent from the critique of mainstream art institutions. I inquire into modalities of institutional critique which foreground questions of participation or non-participation, and examine their disciplinary configurations within the arts. I compare a number of approaches to institutional critique: the institutional affiliations of a community-based theatre project from Darfur, Sudan, a flash mob performance by an Israeli activist group protesting a Cape Town Opera production []{#introduction.xhtml#pg_20}in Tel Aviv Opera House, and a breaching experiment by visual artist Pilvi Takala of trying to enter Disneyland dressed as Snow White, among others. Sometimes institutions can be usefully manoeuvred and hijacked to serve progressive causes. At other times they need to be challenged and boycotted. Sometimes the gesture of critique consists in building counter-institutions, and sometimes in fleeing them. Institutional critique, understood as the explicit use of an artistic practice to interrogate, oppose or break out of art institutional frameworks, has very asymmetrical trajectories and conditions across the world and across domains. I argue that they alert us to the changing institutional conditions that allow or restrict participation, exposing not just the rules or norms of a certain institution, but also, or equally, the rules of its specific traditions of institutional critique.

[Chapter 2](#chapter02.xhtml) addresses the relationship between participatory art and the concept of 'impact'. I investigate the assumptions around impact in relation to participatory art, as well as the critical and methodological challenges of thinking the impact of a work of art. Using the 2012 Spanish-language production *Afuera: lesbianas en escena* (*Outside: Lesbians on Stage*) by the theatre collective Teatro Siluetas from Guatemala and El Salvador as a point of departure, the chapter reflects on a number of debates in theatre and performance scholarship pertaining to assessing and evaluating impact in relation to the question of participation. I critically engage with the field of evidence-led impact studies in the arts, particularly those that seek to prove and rationalize the benefits of the arts and demonstrate them as worthy of receiving structural or financial support. I situate the debate on the usefulness or non-utility of participatory art in relation to social science scholarship relating to the ascendancy of 'participation' in the context of international development. I propose that the internal dynamics and modalities of participation cannot be entirely viewed at a remove from their external modes of circulation. I suggest that it is worthwhile to extend the kinds of activities considered as relevant to a participatory aesthetic, to not only analyse performances as distinct works, but to place them in a longer-term aesthetic continuum with workshops, rehearsals, after-talks, meetings with artists, and other para-theatrical events. The chapter grapples with the question of how to discuss impact in []{#introduction.xhtml#pg_21}relation to participatory art without it being mortgaged into a matter of quantifiable impact alone.

In [Chapter 3](#chapter03.xhtml), I closely examine one workshop setting using the methodological framework of the 'theatre of the oppressed' in the context of a political party-led initiative to run a women's empowerment programme in rural south India, launched in 2013. My analysis focuses on identifying instances and moments of unsolicited participation in a theatrical format explicitly defined as participatory. I question the status of participatory art in the developmental context as forging cohesion and understanding among participants, and instead turn to its ambiguities. The analysis of participation thus seeks to link the macro-dimension of participation in social development with the micro-dimension of community theatre practice. Of particular interest is how participation occurs by way of a nuanced range of reactions, with functions ranging from the disruptive to the ameliorative. The case study calls for methodological attention to ancillary activities that take place at the margins of the theatre event. These phenomena indicate that community participation often assumes unsolicited forms, at times defiant, at times cooperative, at times evasive; it is no straightforward task to classify them as either subversive or subsidiary to the established formats of participation. They are neither interested in offering scholars legible evidence in order to be able to produce a neat account of a certain genre, nor in reassuring theatre practitioners of the efficacy of their methods. I plead for attention to those gestures of participation that may not find their way into discursive iteration, because they may arise out of the very impossibility of such an iteration in language or in formal conventions.

[Chapter 4](#chapter04.xhtml) follows two conceptually inspired performance projects by the Amsterdam-based Lebanese artist Lina Issa, *Where We Are Not* ([2009](#bibliography.xhtml#ref105)) and *If I Could Take Your Place?* ([2010](#bibliography.xhtml#ref106) -- ongoing). These works explore the question of what it means to take someone else's place, to participate in someone's life by doing something on their behalf, in their name and in the mode of 'as if'. The commonly held rule of participatory art, which involves audience participation in an already devised or open performance setting, is reversed in Issa's work, either because it is the artist who seeks to participate in a situation that relates to someone else's daily life, or conversely because others are []{#introduction.xhtml#pg_22}invited to take her place, with audiences witnessing and imagining this process and participating by proxy. By analysing how this vicarious participation unfolds, I foreground the spectatorial parameters of participation, which refer not only to the modes of activating participation, but also deem it the task of participation to make a given situation worthy and deserving of spectators. Here again, the critical theorization of participation calls for an interweaving of the aesthetic with the social or political. Issa's playful performances of standing in for others point to larger questions of what it means to participate in collective processes of imagining and transforming selfhood. I suggest that the solidarity in the gesture of vicarious participation lies not so much in recognizing and finding the so-called 'other' or in respecting and celebrating differences, but rather in being prepared and willing to dispossess oneself of the fixity of one's ideas of the self, a potentially transformative gesture.

[Chapter 5](#chapter05.xhtml) dwells on an installation-based project titled *Nomad City Passage* (2005--09) by the German scenographic and visual artists Rebekka Reich and Oliver Gather, in which visitors are invited to spend one night in a tent in one of several unconventional urban sites, such as the top floor of a high-rise building, a public square in a commercial district or inside a shopping mall. My analysis focuses on how common-sense assumptions around audience participation in theatre and performance theory are called into question by the artwork's foregrounding of sleep as a mode of participation. The delicacy of this is evidenced in the ambivalence of sleep in a scenically prepared setting, oscillating between being an intense, active, dynamic experience on the one hand, and a non-performance, an absence of activity on the other. I suggest that audience participation in the artwork and the artwork's participation in urban spaces differ in significant ways from sociological and political concepts of participation. Where social theory conceives of civic participation in terms of being a part of some larger entity or social unit, the aesthetics of *Nomad City Passage* emphasizes participation in a counter-intuitive way: it becomes possible to participate precisely because of its fleeting and ephemeral conditions, because of its *not* being a part of some shared community ideal.

A feminist impulse is important in one way or another to the []{#introduction.xhtml#pg_23}selection and analysis of all the artistic practices in this study. Many of the cases discussed prominently involve women, whose choice of participatory methods and approaches to artistic and social engagement is guided by a firm belief in its emancipatory potentials, an emancipation that necessarily and inevitably intersects with questions of gender and gendered power relations. My insistence on the need for the genre of participatory art to remain conceptually open and unfixed is motivated by a feminist critique of genres being not only 'genus' (origin, repository, affiliation), but also 'generative', what Jacques Derrida and Avital Ronell describe as 'a sort of participation without belonging -- a taking part in without being part of' (Derrida and Ronell, [1980](#bibliography.xhtml#ref69), p. 59). Affiliation to a given type of participatory practice is thus never far from exceeding those same terms of affiliation: a fundamentally emancipatory gesture, I hope.

Participatory practices pose a number of challenges to existing modes of inquiry in the arts. How should the relation between researcher and researched be realigned, if the researcher is required to participate in an event, obliged to step outside any assumed possible safe outsider position and relate a performance or a certain practice to her own horizon of experience? How can artistic practices from the past be accessed, where there was no possibility of involvement of the researcher as participant observer? Given that participatory works often recalibrate the relationship between process and outcome, the question arises as to what should be included or regarded as relevant to the practice; what is the status of a workshop in comparison to a performance in front of an audience, or as opposed to an unexpected intervention in the streets; how should attendant issues such as documentation be taken into account? How should the perlocutionary after-effects of participation be traced, not just on individual participants but also in terms of appraising an artistic practice as social or political praxis? In each of the cases I examine, these questions repeatedly arise, in ways that are inseparable from the central concerns of the study. Methodology is thus not a technical, ancillary task to the main problem of rethinking the concept of participation, but profoundly tied to its theoretical assumptions and axiological visions.

I was involved in several, but not all, of the cases discussed in the study as a participant observer in the workshop or rehearsal process, []{#introduction.xhtml#pg_24}as a casual passer-by or as a 'regular' audience member with a ticket. In other cases I had to reconstruct a performance and interpret its participatory aesthetics on the basis of documentary evidence, conversations and interviews with other participants, and extensive discussions with the artists. The choice of appropriate methods for collecting and evaluating material was often largely influenced and altered by suggestions and feedback from the artists or other participants. Yet despite the fact that the relations between researcher and researched, or between subject and object of study, had to be repeatedly and necessarily questioned, this is not a practice-led study or a model for participatory action research. A critical and heterodox reflection on the concept of participation and its paradoxes in the arts remains the core objective of this investigation. In the spirit of Antonio Gramsci's quest for intellectual rigour, cited in the epigraph to this introduction, I am in search of ways, however small, to reimagine and reclaim participation at this particular moment of time, not for the sake of eloquence but as a means of collective organizing, constructing, persuading and moving. It is my conviction that participation challenges us to think through this impasse of enabling its potentials beyond the limitations of its administration.

**Notes**

[1](#introduction.xhtml#ft1){#introduction.xhtml#fn1}  This distinction holds, for instance, for the German terms *Teilnahme* ('taking part in') and *Teilhabe* ('having a part/partaking of'). In my mother tongue Tamil, there are further valences emphasizing a willed action such as *panku peṟukka* ('to acquire a part') or *panṅkēṟka* ('to take on a part').

[2](#introduction.xhtml#ft2){#introduction.xhtml#fn2}  The term is used mostly in northern Europe: examples of recent scholarship using the concept of immersive performance are Josephine Machon's *Immersive Theatres* ([2013](#bibliography.xhtml#ref128)), Gareth White's *Audience Participation in the Theatre* ([2013](#bibliography.xhtml#ref203)) and Adam Alston's *Beyond Immersive Theatre* ([2016](#bibliography.xhtml#ref6)), which deal with performances in the UK; Liesbeth Groot-Nibbelink's dissertation 'Nomadic Theatre' ([2015](#bibliography.xhtml#ref88)), which deals with experiential and immersive performance, though it is not primarily interested in questions of participation, drawing on examples from the Netherlands, Belgium and Germany. In the German-speaking world, no equivalent term exists, with 'Mitmach-Theater' having pejorative connotations of the audience being forced to be interactive, and much recent scholarship being influenced by the term 'everyday experts' introduced by the collective Rimini Protokoll, whose []{#introduction.xhtml#pg_25}work sometimes involves audience immersion (Dreysse and Malzacher, [2008](#bibliography.xhtml#ref71)).

[7](#introduction.xhtml#ft7){#introduction.xhtml#fn7}  Turner made a problematic distinction between *liminal* events in so-called 'primitive' societies and *liminoid* events in 'technologically advanced', i.e. industrialized, societies, counting the arts and entertainment as belonging to the latter, as they are voluntary and involve a cultural conception of leisure (Turner, [1969](#bibliography.xhtml#ref194)). As such a distinction has no purchase in a critical decolonial understanding of the arts and cultures, I use the terms synonymously.

We must know what mistake to make with a specific text and must also know how to defend that mistake as the one that will allow us to live. (Spivak, [2012](#bibliography.xhtml#ref178), p. 28)

In the context of contemporary art, the concept of 'institutional critique' refers to the scrutiny of the power of (art) institutions through artistic means. This might include a range of artistic practices: artworks that examine the modus operandi and hidden mechanisms of the institutions they are affiliated to or implicated in, artworks that problematize which persons, subjects and aesthetic modes are allowed to enter the art world and be counted as art. Institutional critique might also refer to the curatorial attempts of art institutions to be self-critical and transparent, for instance by laying bare the motives behind their programming choices. It attempts to account for how institutions ideologically and materially influence the way the history of art is written, determining how its standards must be upheld and when they may be appropriately breached. For a variety of reasons, which have to do with their political economies and the specific relations of artistic domains to institutions, the practice of institutional critique has been far more influential in the visual arts than in theatre and performance. It has a legacy that is often traced to two waves or phases, first in the 1970s and later in the 1990s, both seen as originating in European and North American visual art history (Ray and Raunig, [2009](#bibliography.xhtml#ref155)). The first wave of institutional critique can be ascribed to artworks that sought a critique of the authority or authoritarianism of art institutions, thus self-reflexively juxtaposing the ideals to which art institutions normatively pledged allegiance []{#chapter01.xhtml#pg_27}with the material realities and ideological contradictions within which they operate. The aim thereby was to shift viewer perspectives on the claims of art, to reveal the underlying mechanisms at work, to make the structures visible and thus ultimately alterable. A belief in the power to reform, transform and rehabilitate the faults of institutions through artistic practice is prominent in these attempts. The second wave added to this fundamental critique of institutional authority the problem of representation, drawing attention to the classed, gendered and raced dimensions of institutional power and seeking to reassess the relationships between the centre and the periphery and to dismantle the divisions and models of classification that effectively maintained a status quo and allowed privileges to be kept intact. This aspect foregrounds the formation of social, political or cultural subjects and subjectivities through the practices of institutional critique. Institutional critique is therefore not an established form or genre of art with fixed rules and characteristics, but changes continually across different sites and historical circumstances. It combines social critique and self-critique in reflecting on the relationship between institutions and art, and therefore on the relationship between institutions and critique.

What is the place of institutional critique in relation to participatory performance? Where might institutional critique be located here and how is it practised? In the following, I reflect on the challenges and conundrums of institutional critique from the vantage point of participatory practices. As a first step I examine the formation of participatory art as a genre, specifically community-based, applied art, as emergent from the critique of mainstream art institutions. In a second step, I inquire into some modalities of institutional critique which foreground questions of participation or non-participation, and examine their disciplinary configurations within the arts.

**Participatory art as the critique of institutionalized art**

The category of participatory art might be seen to imply that it is a specific kind of art, a genre in its own right. It might suggest that a certain artistic practice is recognizable and classifiable according to whether and how it enables the participation of audiences or the []{#chapter01.xhtml#pg_28}public, usually conceived as non-professionals or non-artists. In an extended sense, it could also refer to the degree and nature of participation of the artistic practice itself in public life. If we use participatory art as an umbrella concept, encompassing what is variously referred to as community arts, arts in development, art in education, art in therapeutic, rehabilitative or restorative processes, it becomes clear that these are by no means neutral, descriptive categories but indicate inheritances of specific operations of demarcation, with their own implicit ideological assumptions. To that extent, viewing participatory art as a genre in its own right primarily has the purpose of setting up the conditions to be able to ask different kinds of questions of the practices: questions that are not necessarily asked when studying proscenium theatre productions or installation-based performance art or any other interactive forms; questions that lead to different kinds of analyses, in terms of how they frame and bring to life the subjects of study vis-à-vis the existing frameworks of the discipline. When posited as a genre, participatory art therefore does not merely register or serve as a repository for a homogeneous community of practices, in the sense of 'genus', but also 'generates' and makes these practices visible in 'general' terms (Derrida and Ronell, [1980](#bibliography.xhtml#ref69), pp. 56--57).

Yet genre also entails problems of exclusion and stratification. Participatory art, especially in theatre and performance studies, is sometimes perceived as synonymous with the applied arts or community arts, and research on this area is rarely discussed on the same platform as studies on, say, scenography or multimedia interactive art, even if the latter may be deeply concerned with issues of participation.^[1](#chapter01.xhtml#fn1){#chapter01.xhtml#ft1}^ The participation of rural women in a so-called theatre for development project in India would thus be deemed as belonging to a different order, when placed alongside the participation of visitors in an interactive performance art installation in a European or US contemporary art museum. The immersive participation of the public in ritual or religious performances is rarely considered on a par with so-called immersive or experiential performance productions, the former largely deemed the metier of cultural anthropologists and the latter that of art historians or theatre and performance scholars. Yet on what assumptions is this difference in aesthetic or medial order based? There seems to be a Bourdieusian 'fine distinction' at work []{#chapter01.xhtml#pg_29}in the scholarly literature on participatory art, where the quest for a taxonomy based on formal criteria is simultaneously accompanied by implicit classificatory schemes that merely serve to keep certain things together and other things apart (Bourdieu, [1984](#bibliography.xhtml#ref29), p. 472). We know from Bourdieu that 'the mode of expression characteristic of a cultural production always depends on the laws of the market in which it is offered' ([1984](#bibliography.xhtml#ref29), p. xiii). While this sociological argument may suggest some reasons why a participatory theatre or music workshop with slum-dwellers is rarely (deliberately or otherwise) discussed together with contemporary art projects using a participatory pedagogy in a gallery or exhibition context, it also implicitly demands that this legitimization of differences between these domains through institutions and academic scholarship be questioned and recalibrated from time to time. It cautions against taking the logics governing their separations and divisions for granted, and emphasizes the need to formulate alternative schemes of appraisal and critique, however inconvenient and unwieldy such a task might be (Bourdieu, [1984](#bibliography.xhtml#ref29), p. 7).

If this could be read as a criticism of a problematic segregation of participatory art from broader disciplinary platforms, it is equally a result of the insistence in the scholarship on participatory art on its being distinct from 'conventional' theatre or visual art settings. The relationship of participatory art to institution and institutionalization may be charted in terms of three interrelated moves: a move away from conventional art institutions, a move towards alternative institutions and settings, and a transformative movement within existing institutions (Ray and Raunig, [2009](#bibliography.xhtml#ref155)).^[2](#chapter01.xhtml#fn2){#chapter01.xhtml#ft2}^ It is frequently argued, for instance, that the emergence and recognition of participatory theatre as a distinct genre in theatre and performance partly derives from its critique of the canons and regulatory restrictions of high art institutions and its preference for counter-institutions and non-institutionalized spaces of theatrical activity. The critique of the inadequacies of one domain could lead to the formation of another domain, which comes with its own set of institutional entanglements. Participatory theatre is thus viewed as a move away from theatrical forms because of its emphasis on 'ordinary people' and their stories, rather than on professional actors and pre-written scripts, its sustained embeddedness []{#chapter01.xhtml#pg_30}in local contexts, as well as its explicit commitment to combining social and artistic goals (van Erven, [2001](#bibliography.xhtml#ref197)). It is seen as emerging from a critical response to the absence of these features in the established national, bourgeois or commercial theatre circuits.

A move away from these institutions implies a search for other institutions, which is characterized by a quest for alternative institutional spaces in cooperation with the people who dwell or work in these spaces on a daily basis, which could take the form of civic institutions such as schools, old age homes, youth clubs, prisons or clinics, or could involve the temporary occupation of common or private spaces such as the street, public squares, rooftops, homes and gardens, inviting the participation of passers-by. The Indian theatre director Safdar Hashmi, founder of *Janam*, or *Jana Natya Manch* \[People's Theatre Association\], powerfully argued that 'since mainstream theatre is by and large out of tune and touch with the majority of our people, the need remains for a fully developed people's theatre' (1998, p. 32). For Hashmi and his workers' theatre group in the 1980s, the streets were incorporated into the performances of *Janam*, not simply as a backdrop, but as an active and vibrant feature of social life. The move away from the spaces of established theatre institutions is accompanied by a move towards institutions such as labour unions and political parties, whose rallies and public activities often take place in the streets. At the same time, the rejection of established institutions and the embrace of alternative institutions tend also to be accompanied by attempts to transform existing institutions and institutional practices. This could take the form of a call to alter processes of working within the theatre and a questioning of the hierarchical relations between theatre director, actors/actresses, dramaturges, translators, production assistants, stage, lighting and costume designers, such as in the radical experiments of the *creación colectiva* and new theatre movement from Latin America in the 1950s and 1960s. The history of participatory theatre practices across the world testifies to an institutional critique in a combination of gestures of fleeing from, forging new and transforming existing relationships to institutions.

Carefully differentiated critical yardsticks and historical routes are thus required to distinguish different legacies of institutional critique []{#chapter01.xhtml#pg_31}from each other, not in order to retreat into a safe particularism, but rather in order to theorize them from their very finite locales and social and disciplinary bases. What exactly is deemed a 'critical' practice thus differs hugely from one context to another. The following two examples instantiate how a public denunciation of institutional power may be a powerful critical mode in one context, whereas it may be entirely counter-productive in another.

When a support group of the Palestinian Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions movement protested the Tel Aviv staging of Cape Town Opera's performance of George Gershwin's *Porgy and Bess* in 2010 by staging a flash mob in front of the Tel Aviv Opera House on the night of the premiere, the event acutely drew the political context and historical legacy of the performance into the spotlight, and at the same time called attention to what was at stake for audience members who chose to attend it (Dana, 2010). Popular tunes from the musical were deployed by the protesters with altered lyrics: 'Summertime, and the living is easy' became 'Palestine, and the living ain't easy', and 'It Ain't Necessarily So' was rendered with references to the comparability of apartheid in South Africa and the Israeli occupation of Palestine. The flash mob becomes an interesting case for discussing institutional critique only when seen in relation to the specificities of this context. This unsolicited event at the fringe of a performance places the responsibility of art institutions under scrutiny, i.e. how audience participation in such a performance may be a conscious or unconscious endorsement of Israeli government policies and actions, or how the decision of Cape Town Opera to perform in Tel Aviv Opera House may be a manifestation of complicity with a political regime they may not necessarily perceive themselves as having anything to do with. This context is undoubtedly connected to the complex performance history of *Porgy and Bess*, from its emergence in the racially segregated US, to its widespread rejection by the American civil rights movement, to its renewed politicization during the apartheid era in South Africa, with failed attempts to stage performances featuring an all-white cast, to its resurgence and commercially popular reworking in the twenty-first century (Noonan, [2012](#bibliography.xhtml#ref142)). The use of a performative flash mob by a group of protestors sought to draw attention to the clout of institutions such as Cape Town Opera in influencing public []{#chapter01.xhtml#pg_32}opinion and taking a stance in support of the Palestinian Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions movement, which is modelled on the South African anti-apartheid boycott movement, by not cooperating with Israeli government-funded institutions.

The very same question of the order of cooperation with hegemonic institutions can take on an entirely different valence in another context. Consider the case of a Sudanese independent theatre production featured at an international theatre festival in Rotterdam in the Netherlands in 2009, with a grant from the Sudanese national government. Given the anti-democratic track record of the Sudanese government, the theatre group might be accused of being co-opted by nationalist agendas in accepting travel grants from a regime it criticizes. Walid Al-Alphy, the theatre director of an independent ensemble from Darfur, Sudan, addressed this point during an after-talk following a performance of *The People of the Cave*. When a member of the audience asked how it was possible to be critical of the ruling powers while simultaneously accepting an award from them in order to present their work abroad, Al-Alphy's response was revealing.^[3](#chapter01.xhtml#fn3){#chapter01.xhtml#ft3}^ Given that Sudanese (not to speak of Darfurian) independent theatre is hardly taken notice of in the rest of the world, and that Sudan is a country often negatively represented in the press, the task of retaining artistic independence inevitably needs to be done from within, and not in an imaginary bubble presumably untouched by the country's messy political environment. Under these circumstances, Al-Alphy pointed out, he perceived it as the responsibility of his theatre group to accept the privilege of showcasing their work abroad, adding that it was not only by authoritarian regimes but also and equally by art circuits and self-appointed guardians of free expression that dissident artists might be co-opted. Refraining from these matters and 'staying in the cave' was not an option, he said, using a metaphor derived from the play. *The People of the Cave*, adapted from an episode in the Quran known as the *Sūrat al-Kahf*, is set in a cave, where five men have fled from a tyrant and fall into a miraculous 300-year-long sleep.^[4](#chapter01.xhtml#fn4){#chapter01.xhtml#ft4}^ When they wake up, they hear radio reports of bombardments, chronic illnesses and attacks on villages. The men fight among themselves about who ought to be the king, and the battle for power results in the new king leaving the cave promising to help the others, though []{#chapter01.xhtml#pg_33}he never returns. One by one, the people of the cave desert each other and look to their survival in the midst of war. The play enunciates a critique of structures of governance that instil fear in people, stultify them and turn them against each other. As a production, it exemplifies theatre as an institution that participates in public debates and takes a stance on current issues. The cave and the world outside were metaphors for the theatre and the world outside. To avoid stepping out of the cave would have been to avoid the possibility of participating in the world. In an interview, Walid Al-Alphy remarked:

In Sudan, everyone is part of the war. There are perpetrators and victims, but beneath that there is shared responsibility. The new sultans in *People of the Cave* threaten their followers, but the followers themselves are afraid to leave the cave to see the world with their own eyes. They remain in their dormant state. (Heemstra, [2009](#bibliography.xhtml#ref95))

For Al-Alphy's theatre ensemble, the choice to travel abroad with Sudanese government funding, knowing that their work might be misperceived or misrepresented, was an ethical and political choice, explicitly shifting the question of institutional critique from the limited issue of how a theatre company relates to state funding to the broader issue of safeguarding interventionist and activist potentials in terms of theatre's societal responsibility. Institutional critique is thus not a matter that can be resolved once and for all, but needs to be a persistent effort. The very critique of institutional participation is thus predicated upon participation, and the refusal to participate is only one of the ways in which this critique is articulated.

**Institutional affiliations and entanglements**

I have been arguing thus far that participatory practices have imagined the relationship between 'institution' and 'critique' in terms of their own critical relation to conventional, established theatre institutions. However, this does not resolve the question of how to locate institutional critique within its own terrain. It is worthwhile to examine the institutional affiliations and entanglements of participatory projects, how they operate within or against their supporting institutions in different ways, as well as how institutions invoke or []{#chapter01.xhtml#pg_34}invest in the participatory for various purposes. One could start by distinguishing between at least four kinds of institutional support for participatory applied theatre projects: local or national governments; national or international non-governmental organizations (NGOs); civic institutions such as schools, universities, youth clubs, political parties, hospitals, prisons or community centres; and corporate bodies. Each of these institutional frameworks places its own set of conditions on theatrical or other artistic activities in their environments. At times these conditions become 'conditionalities', i.e. they carry consequences or sanctions for non-compliance (Anderson, [1999](#bibliography.xhtml#ref8)). Participatory practices may seek to enter these institutions in order to artfully transform and critique their underlying premises, or because the institutions facilitate their contact with the disenfranchised or marginalized sections of the population who may be perceived as ideal target audiences or participants in their activities. Either way, the involvement with state or non-state apparatuses of power leads to abundant contradictions in artistic practices. The most obvious example of this is prison theatre, which remains bound to the rules of prison institutions, even as it may seek to symbolically or otherwise critique the system of incarceration (Balfour, [2004](#bibliography.xhtml#ref12); Thompson, [1998](#bibliography.xhtml#ref186)). Theatre-based workshops for the employees of multinational corporations domesticate and de-politicize methods developed by Brecht or Boal, even as they invoke their anti-capitalist theatrical concepts in pursuit of the goals of increased productivity, improving motivation in the workplace or resolving conflicts that impede efficiency levels (Heinicke et al., [2015](#bibliography.xhtml#ref96)).

Another case of the institutional entanglement of participatory art is to be found in the domain known as theatre for development. The deployment of theatre as a tool in developmental initiatives, particularly in participatory rural appraisals, capacity building and mobilization activities, has led to participatory popular theatre forms being adopted by governmental and non-governmental development agencies in many countries of the Global South. While this may be regarded by some as offering new avenues for bridging artistic practices to social transformation, it has also been severely critiqued by others for allowing the instrumentalization of theatre as a tool of soft power over impoverished rural communities. A number of []{#chapter01.xhtml#pg_35}macro-institutional factors have significantly influenced how theatrical practices engage with and critique institutions: the withering of post-independence anti-colonial hopes into authoritarian, corrupt, militarized and incompetent regimes; the 'structural adjustment programmes' imposed on many poor, 'developing' countries by heavyweight institutions such as the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund; the subsequent withdrawal of autonomy and financial support from universities and autonomous cultural institutions; as well as a political climate that instrumentalized culture and art while simultaneously censoring dissident expressions.^[5](#chapter01.xhtml#fn5){#chapter01.xhtml#ft5}^ Concepts that grew out of the heady utopian ideals of popular theatre movements, such as grassroots participation and conscientization, mutated into a rhetorical tool of social engineering, promoting the agendas of Western-dominated organizations and maintaining the power bases of local elites (Cohen and Uphoff, [2011](#bibliography.xhtml#ref53)).

According to the Bangladeshi theatre scholar Syed Jamil Ahmed, theatre for development, in the way it is practised by some Bangladeshi NGOs, 'identified the central problem not as oppression but as poverty, by converting "dialogue" into "opinion sharing", which is a neutral technique devoid of "politics"' ([2002](#bibliography.xhtml#ref4), p. 214). In sub-Saharan Africa, for instance, the area of health education, especially related to HIV/AIDS, is one of the main sources of funding for any theatre work, resulting in a vast number of applied theatre projects in school workshops, teacher training, and in developmental activities. Not only national but also international non-governmental organizational policies thus often indirectly determine what topics ought to be addressed by artists, towards which ends, and even which forms are most appropriate. A politically expedient imperative of utility thus shapes the relation of such institutions to theatre work. At worst they take the form of top-down, information-providing edu-tainment, or corporate image repair campaigns camouflaged as developmental programmes (Plastow, [2014](#bibliography.xhtml#ref148), p. 111). If huge breweries promote theatre programmes on sensible drinking, or multinational oil companies support artistic initiatives for participatory citizenship in Nigeria while clamping down on ecological activists elsewhere, the notion of institutional support, as Jane Plastow rightly argues, assumes a downright cynical and dangerous connotation. Plastow's []{#chapter01.xhtml#pg_36}critique could be extended to many other parts of the world, including Europe, where, increasingly, it is 'creativity' or 'social cohesion' that serves as the dispositive, rather than 'development' (Ahmed and Hughes, [2015](#bibliography.xhtml#ref5)).

Institutional critique, understood as the explicit use of an artistic practice to interrogate, oppose or break out of institutional frameworks, has very asymmetrical trajectories and conditions across the world and across domains, but these differences have difficulty in finding their way into scholarly assessments. Institutional critique means something else to those operating in established art institutions such as museums, galleries, biennials or theatre festivals in Europe or North America, than it does to those working in countries where such institutions barely exist and where artists are struggling to set them up in the first place (Araeen, [2003](#bibliography.xhtml#ref9)). Of contemporary theatre practices in Europe, for instance, it is most commonly expected that they will express some form of institutional critique or self-critique, which demonstrates that they are conscious of how they are both enabled as well as limited by the structures or institutions that host them. The absence of such a self-critical stance is often mistrusted or regarded as an absence of credibility and criticality. While I agree with this in principle, participatory practices, particularly in poorer countries and in precarious sociopolitical environments, do not articulate institutional critiques in terms of anti-institutionality. The absence of an explicit critique of institutions need not always be equated with the absence of a critical attitude.

Shannon Jackson's study *Social Works* invokes the idea that performance cannot take place without an infrastructure, including institutional and intersubjective support systems, and thus calls for an understanding of the artwork as including and extending to social and affective dimensions. She highlights performance concepts such as 'props' ([2011](#bibliography.xhtml#ref111), pp. 42ff.), 'supportive roles' and institutional defamiliarization ([2011](#bibliography.xhtml#ref111), p. 62) not as mere technical terms, but as bearing important dimensions of sociability and sociality. Jackson further argues that support for institutions and institutionalization need not be at odds with suspicion towards institutions in radical political theory. She questions the assumption that artistic radicalism and progressiveness must be gauged by their degree of anti-institutionality, []{#chapter01.xhtml#pg_37}investigating instances of artworks that sustain, care for and imagine alternative institutions, within the art world as well as outside (Jackson, [2011](#bibliography.xhtml#ref111), pp. 14--15). The question is thus one of expanding the field of institutional critique to be able to take seriously very different ways of relating critique to institutions, including those that may contest the dogmatisms of institutional critique as established by the Western art world.

The institutional operations of participation are not simply restricted to how audience members are integrated into artworks, but also concern the labour and input of experts commissioned to contribute their specialized skills in order to realize the artwork. Jen Harvie examines the participation of technicians, architects, engineers, craftspeople and manual workers or hired extras in the creation of complex installations; for instance, the commissioning of thousands of artisans by Ai Weiwei in China to produce more than one million hand-painted porcelain sunflower seeds, or Anish Kapoor's close collaboration with engineers and architects to realize the large-scale installation *Marsyas* (Harvie, [2013](#bibliography.xhtml#ref94), pp. 33--35). Harvie argues that when assessed on the grounds of labour, these participatory practices may at best cultivate a sense of collective responsibility and pursuit of a shared goal, or at worst replicate or exploit labour trends to the artist's own benefit ([2013](#bibliography.xhtml#ref94), p. 41). These differences carry very distinct implications in terms of who are deemed to be the beneficiaries or authors of the participatory process, and who are its invisible domestic hands.

Commercialization and corporate ownership are common conditions of dissemination in the domain of visual art, whereas in many countries, theatre remains either self-funded or directly or indirectly state-supported, and cannot be sold or even circulated as a commodity in a market. In parts of the world, where powerful art institutions are either non-existent or inaccessible to artists, participatory art is found in the frameworks of NGOs and educational institutions. Veronica Baxter identifies a 'tension between the role of the arts as education and social commentary, and their perceived position as part of a "knowledge and creative economy"' (Baxter, [2013](#bibliography.xhtml#ref16), p. 210). At the same time, the restrictions and requirements that result from being institutionally tied to an NGO or to school-based theatre work need []{#chapter01.xhtml#pg_38}not necessarily always mean compromising artistic integrity, but can rather serve as a trigger for fruitful artistic experiments and explorations (Chinyowa, [2015](#bibliography.xhtml#ref50); Dinesh, [2015](#bibliography.xhtml#ref70)). It must also be recognized that, in many contexts, international NGO support may be the only avenue available for pursuing artistic work, so any institutional critique tends to take place in tactical and implicit ways (Thompson, Hughes and Balfour, [2009](#bibliography.xhtml#ref191)).

In many countries around the world, especially in the initial decades of independence following the end of colonialism, the structure of national sovereignty was established through national institutional frameworks, which were inherited from colonial administrations as well as being attempts at cultural modernization on their own terms (Chatterjee, [1998](#bibliography.xhtml#ref49); Thiong'o, [1998](#bibliography.xhtml#ref184)). Historically, it was artists, public intellectuals, educationists, writers and cultural activists who supported the initiation of the institutions of state building, and invested their life energies in shaping these as serious proponents of democratic principles, from cultural and religious associations, libraries, voluntary associations and educational-cultural institutions, to journals and magazines, publishing houses, art venues and public debates. So in the context of post-colonial societies, it was often artists and public intellectuals, the cultural elites, who provided support to the state in various ways to help set up civic cultural institutions, rather than the state supporting artists through institutional means.^[6](#chapter01.xhtml#fn6){#chapter01.xhtml#ft6}^ The very possibility of fostering independent civic cultural institutions was thus in some sense essential to a notion of selfdetermination and sovereignty. The betrayal of those hopes in the decades of the Cold War and the transition into neoliberal capitalism, what historian David Scott has called the disenchantment of becoming 'conscripts of modernity' ([2004](#bibliography.xhtml#ref174)), is well known. The relationship to institutional critique in the artistic contexts of formerly colonized countries is thus neither one of romantic progression nor of a nostalgic return to a condition that was, but rather one of living with and working within inadequacies, thwarted hopes and disillusionment. Where nation states have failed to uphold democratic principles, international NGOs or even corporate institutions may offer the only avenue available for pursuing artistic work, so a boycott or outright rejection of their involvement in the arts is often not a constructive []{#chapter01.xhtml#pg_39}option. This does not mean that there is no consciousness of institutional hegemony, but rather that critique might assume indirect forms and dwell in grey areas, it might be expressed beside and at the margins of the institutions rather than within them. I specifically refer to institutions to which participatory projects tend to be attached: on the one hand, the providers of funding, i.e. the charity arms of big corporations, the humanitarian and development aid wings of transnational NGOs and national developmental agencies, educational and cultural foundations; and on the other hand, the so-called beneficiary institutions, community initiatives, schools and small-scale civic organizations. Being institutionally tied need not necessarily mean compromising artistic integrity, for institutions can be politely hijacked for fruitful artistic experiments, or in Gayatri Spivak's felicitous formulation, 'affirmatively sabotaged' (Spivak, [2012](#bibliography.xhtml#ref178), p. 510, n. 3).

Consider, for instance, the situation of a theatre for development presentation in a typical rural setting in the Global South, where villagers are invited to gather in a public square to watch performances on topics such as safe sex, personal hygiene, planned parenthood or electoral rights performed by urban facilitators and actors. Public participation is sought through interactivity on stage, or post-performance discussions with the audience. The resistance of the population to these top-down, heavily didactic performances is commonly expressed by indirect means, as in feigned compliance through offering expected, stock answers to the questions posed by the facilitators. An actor playing a man who insists on sex without a condom turns to the audience to ask if what he did was correct, at which the audience collectively shouts back with an insincere but resounding 'No!' Members of the audience step into roles in forum theatre interventions, but do not follow the instructions of the facilitators, instead using the platform to perform an improvised song and dance on their own. The performance itself sometimes becomes an excuse for an improvised bazaar, with vendors appearing with their stalls to sell food and other items at the margins of the event, and people gathering for conversations, often with complete disregard for what is going on in the theatrical performance (Chinyowa, [2015](#bibliography.xhtml#ref50)).

[]{#chapter01.xhtml#pg_40}Another intriguing example is the hugely commercially successful prison dance project at the Cebu Provincial Detention and Rehabilitation Centre in the Philippines (Peterson, [2012](#bibliography.xhtml#ref147)). With amateur videos that have had millions of views on YouTube, and monthly public shows that have unexpectedly turned the prison into a major attraction for visitors and tourists, the spectacular dance routines involving up to 1500 inmates present at best an ambivalent and oblique critique of the institution, affirmative of incarceration in high-security prisons, even while staging outrage and defiance by dancing to Michael Jackson's hit 'They Don't Really Care about Us'. Yet the Cebu dancing inmates, as they are known, call into question common assumptions about participatory art initiatives with inmates in prison. Their dances are commercial super-hits, very large in scale; they spend absolutely no time on staging confessional, personal narratives and are in no way concerned with the 'us vs. them' problem in much of prison theatre work, confronting the privileges of facilitators with the restrictive circumstances of inmates.

In the Western European context of the visual arts, institutional critique sometimes assumes a conceptual mode. In 2009 the visual artist Pilvi Takala visited Disneyland in France, dressed up as Snow White from the Disney animation film, and documented her failed attempt to gain access in a short video entitled *The Real Snow White*.^[7](#chapter01.xhtml#fn7){#chapter01.xhtml#ft7}^ Takala was certainly aware that seeking entry into Disneyland as Snow White would not be a straightforward enterprise. Many of her works employ breaching experiments as a way of highlighting uncontested social norms.^[8](#chapter01.xhtml#fn8){#chapter01.xhtml#ft8}^ Her intended naivety is met with a heavyhanded response from Disney's gatekeepers, who first refuse her entry on the grounds that she is not allowed to dress up in the costume, since there is a 'real' Snow White inside Disneyland, and later insist that she has to change her clothes in order not to mislead other visitors into believing she is the 'real' Snow White. Yet the seriousness lies in the absurd recourse to law enforcement in order to guard a fiction. It is absurd because 'fiction turns degenerate', in the words of Önder Özengi, its commodity power taking over its fictional power (Özengi, [2010](#bibliography.xhtml#ref145)). The 'real' Snow White is the one who has been contracted and employed by Disney, a Snow White sanctioned by corporate law and not by fanciful wit. To mess with []{#chapter01.xhtml#pg_41}that copyrighted fiction is, of course, to be penalized for not being the kind of productive consumer participant for whom the gates of Disneyland are opened. Takala's attempt to be a part of or to take part in the fantasies of Empire puts her at risk -- not only the risk of exclusion from Empire, but moreover the risk of being punished for not participating in the right way.

Takala's point was not to protest against Disney or to show her oppositional stance as an artist. Rather, the experiment was about seeing how far it is possible to claim ownership of a fantasy, how far the citation of that fantasy works as its disruption. The video itself follows a fairly conventional format, consciously using a hand-held camera and rough, largely unedited footage, giving the impression of a spontaneous amateur recording. It is the artist who participates or intervenes in a given social setting. She does not follow a script but rather maintains a way of bearing herself, a gesture that makes the terms of her participation as well as the unquestioned rules of that specific social setting noticeable, a kind of invisible theatre if you like, documented and later presented in art gallery contexts. *The Real Snow White* is neither an act of protest against the consumerism of Disneyland, nor an act of opposition to the art world, for that would assume some safe outside from which such an opposition could be launched. It is an act of critical participation through what Slavoj Žižek called, in psychoanalytical terms, 'over-identification', 'an act of taking the system more seriously than it wants you to take it' (BAVO, [2007](#bibliography.xhtml#ref15), p. 29). Yet the work might also be read as a form of institutional critique, if one regards Takala's attempt to enter Disneyland as an allegory of her critique of the commodified art world, with the art world being represented as a kind of Disneyland and the artist over-identifying with its conventions.

Such phenomena are, I would argue, important expressions of critique towards the institutions that turn theatre and performance into a tool of governance, but they crucially adopt a form of critique that is not necessarily oppositional or outwardly showing resistance, and in fact they often do not even bother to directly address the institutions. Rather, they assume informal, para-theatrical modes that ironically seem to resist the very category of institutional critique. What I find most noteworthy is that the critique often comes from the []{#chapter01.xhtml#pg_42}participants and not from the artists or facilitators of the art projects.^[9](#chapter01.xhtml#fn9){#chapter01.xhtml#ft9}^ This makes it difficult to assess them in conventional aesthetic terms. They may not be considered 'artistic', but they are 'artful' acts of criticality, in that they reveal the mechanisms of institutional power that so forcefully shape theatrical practices and the academic discourses that accompany them. Terms such as the 'artwork', the 'production' or 'the artist' prove inadequate when considering that process, experience and encounter, rather than finished, authored works are central to most participatory art forms.

**Disciplinary configurations**

Institutional affiliations shape and are shaped by the sites of practice. For instance, prison arts programmes, art-in-education and interactive installations in museums may all be driven by participatory pedagogical concepts, but these take on an entirely different significance according to the setting in which they are implemented. Correspondingly, there are many different theoretical positions, which often simply do not take notice of each other or seem incompatible because of their location in disparate settings. Their epistemological routes draw inspiration from very different traditions of theorizing and analysis, which throws open as many questions and contradictions as it provides fruitful points of connection. What would, for instance, Rancière's notion of 'emancipated spectatorship' mean in a prison arts context, where inequality and asymmetry dominate the relations between those who conduct the participatory art projects and those who are meant to be the beneficiaries? How should the 'educational turn' in museum curation practices be compared to or brought to bear upon the 'social turn' of arts in education programmes (Nicholson, [2011](#bibliography.xhtml#ref139); Rogoff, [2008](#bibliography.xhtml#ref167))? Institutional critique, understood as the explicit use of an artistic practice to interrogate, oppose or break out of art institutional frameworks, has very asymmetrical trajectories and conditions across the world and across domains, but these differences have difficulty finding their way into scholarly assessments (Ray and Raunig, [2009](#bibliography.xhtml#ref155), p. xv). Such problems of cross-disciplinary discussion of participatory practices become interesting because they point to the changing institutional conditions that allow or restrict []{#chapter01.xhtml#pg_43}participation. Taken seriously as instances of institutional critique, they expose not just the rules or norms of a certain institution, but also or equally the rules of its specific traditions of institutional critique, thus presenting the possibility of a meta-critical commentary.

Current debates on participation in theatre and performance as well as in installation-based visual art shift between two main and contrasting claims. For the purposes of simplification, these claims may be called the sweet dream and the nightmare of participation.^[10](#chapter01.xhtml#fn10){#chapter01.xhtml#ft10}^ The proponents of participatory art as a sweet dream or a utopian ideal see in participatory methods the potential to overcome what is often regarded as a stultifying barrier between audiences and performers, overcoming the fourth wall, creating real-life, vivid, embodied encounters rather than mere staged representations. It is regarded as being socially progressive, having a relevance beyond the sphere of art alone because of being an experience of relationality and a process rather than a finished product. It is also regarded as a critical response to neoliberal conditions that do not just affect the economy, but financialize all spheres of life. In contrast, the insistence on the participatory, or the involvement of marginalized sections of the population, has been critiqued as concealing inequalities or differences through an apparently inclusive false gesture, an ideal turned into the tyranny of an imperative and absorbed into the mechanisms of neoliberal governance, a form of placation and coercion rather than a means of democratic citizenship, where the responsibility of the artist is outsourced to the audience or to others invited to participate.

On the one hand, it is possible to observe several correspondences between the critique of the neoliberal absorption of participation in social policy, and the deployment of participatory theatre and performance under the aegis of social cohesion or development. Several scholars have argued that it is necessary to be circumspect about celebrating an artwork for its supposed inclusivity and participatory approach. In her study of performance under neoliberal economic conditions in the UK, Jen Harvie notes that 'labour deregulation in art and performance corresponds to the broader deregulation of markets -- particularly labour markets -- under neoliberal capitalism' ([2013](#bibliography.xhtml#ref94), p. 29). This is not only true of large-scale commercial stage productions, but also in the experimental, independent and educational sectors, []{#chapter01.xhtml#pg_44}where volunteers, interns and members of the audience are used in performance settings, a participation that might be rehabilitating in some cases and exploitative in others. Anthony Jackson similarly notes that 'facile assumptions about being able to "make a difference" in people's lives by the very act of engaging them in a participatory drama experience can all too easily lead to patronization, even to a certain kind of oppression' ([2007](#bibliography.xhtml#ref109), p. 8). The vocabulary often used to speak about participatory art, terms such as empowerment, collaboration, inclusion, dialogue, creativity, are oftentimes drawn from the public policy discourse that overshadows and hounds NGOs and independent artists and companies in their daily interactions with funding bodies and supporting institutions. This is specifically true of applied or community theatre practices. At one point in theatre and cultural history, especially since the 1970s, these concepts were uttered by anti-establishment thinkers and stood for radical alternatives to authoritarian models of governance, alternatives that were imagined in and through artistic practices. Today they neatly dovetail with the logic of neoliberal thinking (Ahmed and Hughes, [2015](#bibliography.xhtml#ref5)).

On the other hand, the ascendancy of participatory forms and approaches in both the visual arts as well as theatre and performance can be interpreted precisely as a critical response to the ever-expanding neoliberal rationality, which frames all spheres of life in market, if not directly monetary, terms. Thus sociality, care, interpersonal communication and affectively grounded interactions become increasingly important as aesthetic values of this 'social turn'. Most often cited in this context are Nicolas Bourriaud's curatorial conceptions of participatory works in the museum context, documented in his study *Relational Aesthetics* (2002). It must be noted that the aesthetics of the relational responds specifically to debates in the visual arts primarily in Europe, and does not address notions of relationality from a theatre and performance perspective. Using scattered references to Marx, Althusser and Debord, Bourriaud propounds the idea of art as a social interstice rather than as a material product (Bourriaud, [2002](#bibliography.xhtml#ref30), p. 14); he suggests using the word 'work' in artwork as a verb rather than as a noun, thus as process and convivial encounter rather than as a finished, unchangeable good (p. 22); and he celebrates social encounters in and through art as proposals of micro-utopias (p. 31).

[]{#chapter01.xhtml#pg_45}Tom Finkelpearl's study of what he calls art and social cooperation analyses the history of participatory art in the visual art domain in the USA through the lens of social justice and counter-cultural movements, with the 1960s as the historical point of departure. Finkelpearl delineates the history of participatory practices from the close ties between artists and the civil rights movement, racial justice struggles as well as the feminist movement ([2013](#bibliography.xhtml#ref75), pp. 16--19). The theoretical influences that Finkelpearl identifies as crucial to the field are Guy Debord and Paolo Freire. He mentions groups such as the Diggers in San Francisco and the Yippies in New York, who experimented with street happenings, set up counter-institutions and combined artistic and social activities, as well as more institutionally established artists such as Allan Kaprow and Joseph Beuys, or groups such as Fluxus, who initiated forms of institutional critique through participatory practices within and beyond the spaces of art institutions (Finkelpearl, [2013](#bibliography.xhtml#ref75), pp. 13--16). Moving to the late 1970s and 1980s, Finkelpearl charts the rise of socially collaborative public art projects in relation to urban development and public advocacy, with prominent figures such as Mierle Laderman Ukeles's 'maintenance art' in cooperation with municipal sanitation workers, and Suzanne Lacy's large-scale cooperative performances.

The terminologies of participation operate by way of their disciplinary relationship to other terms. For instance, Bourriaud proposed the 'relational aesthetic' as a category in distinction from an objectoriented art ([2002](#bibliography.xhtml#ref30)). From a theatre studies perspective, such a differentiation may appear irrelevant to a certain extent, as relationality -- the corporeal energy and interaction between human and nonhuman presence on and off stage -- is always already indispensable to the medium of theatre and performance, a given prerequisite and not a special genre. On the other hand, terms such as immersive, invitational or experiential performance indicate foremost their difference from conventional proscenium stage and arena settings, emphasizing scenography, the architectural dimension of participation, one-to-one encounters and the use of installations and stylized environments (White, [2012](#bibliography.xhtml#ref202)). From a contemporary visual art perspective, this distinction may seem outdated or trivial, as spatial considerations and the institutional circumstances of experiencing, i.e. participating in, []{#chapter01.xhtml#pg_46}an artwork are perceived as already integral to its aesthetic. Shannon Jackson rhetorically describes these contrasting approaches as an 'experimental chiasmus across the arts: a movement toward painting and sculpture underpins post-dramatic theatre, but a movement toward theatre also underpins post-studio art. In such a chiasmus, breaking the traditions of one medium means welcoming the traditions of another' (Jackson, [2011](#bibliography.xhtml#ref111), p. 6). Jackson's remark that the location of participatory practices is at the crossroads of the visual and performing arts is of critical importance.

Even disciplinary variations of the same term may signal very different practices informed by a distinct set of values. Thus it is arguable that community music, community theatre, community dance and community media have distinct trajectories of scholarship and practice, and need therefore to be referenced with different terms, such that using a broad term such as 'community art' may in fact erase these specific characteristics by lumping them together. A comparability across media is neither self-evident nor necessarily desirable, as questions pertaining to participation in community music, for example, might address musicological issues (Turino, [2008](#bibliography.xhtml#ref193)), which are possibly of limited interest to researchers of community theatre, even if both might explicitly deal with how given communities participate in making music or theatre collectively, and even if theatre and music are interrelated performing art forms. Apart from this, competing notions of what 'community' means or how communities are best served obviously shape whether certain participatory artistic practices are nostalgic or confronting, whether they are oriented towards preserving the structures that keep a community together, or towards calling these structures into question. Concepts such as 'play', 'game' or 'playfulness' recur in both the visual arts as well as performance studies in configuring conditions of participation, though referring to very different theoretical frameworks.^[11](#chapter01.xhtml#fn11){#chapter01.xhtml#ft11}^

Conversely, some terms may carry distinct regional and cultural nuances. The concept of applied theatre, widely used in Englishspeaking contexts, has commonalities with, but also crucial differences from the German understandings of *angewandtes Theater*. Participation in the former is usually associated with members of an often disadvantaged social grouping who are regarded as beneficiaries, []{#chapter01.xhtml#pg_47}such as homeless people, children, asylum seekers or villagers, whereas the German concept of *angewandtes Theater* is more concerned with delimiting the traditional drama-based conventions of theatre (the root *wenden* indicates a shift or a turn rather than an application), thus extending the term beyond the focus on audience participation or outreach to experimental applications (Matzke, Weiler and Wortelkamp, [2012](#bibliography.xhtml#ref131)). Given that such medium-specific criteria variously influence how a certain kind of participatory art is discursively operated, it is less relevant to establish the definition of 'collaborative art' as distinct from 'dialogical art' or 'community art', and more intriguing to explore why a certain term is preferred, to which tradition it is affiliated, in what way it is problematized, and how this choice of terminology tells us something about the underlying or assumed politics of participation.

The disciplinary variations of participatory art demonstrate how nomenclature is a contextual practice. The categorical separation of the aesthetic and the social or political sphere and their institutions risks becoming a form of gatekeeping rather than encouraging an investigation that steps outside of the shelter of canon and discipline. Further, it is important to recognize the turn towards the social as a valid form of critique, a turning away from what might be perceived as the restrictive modes and conditions of the aesthetic sphere, thus an institutional critique (Ray and Raunig, [2009](#bibliography.xhtml#ref155), p. 54). To demand that such a critique must make itself legible to the institutions and existing nomenclatures of art can, under certain circumstances, equally function as a form of confinement and a failure to comprehend the critique. This is particularly so in contexts located outside what belongs to the art world, with reference to the artistic pursuits of peoples far removed from the circuit of the global art market, or unnoticed by interpellating artistic and academic institutions that lend them leverage and legitimacy (Sangari, [2002](#bibliography.xhtml#ref171), pp. 23--24).

Discerning readers may wonder how the above examples might be regarded as 'participatory' if there is no obvious element of audience participation, interactivity and collaboration within the performances or in the process leading up to them. Because of the way that many instances of participatory art exist at the threshold of art and civic []{#chapter01.xhtml#pg_48}institutions or realms, there have been many discussions on how to value and speak about participatory art *as art*, a concern prominently raised by Claire Bishop in her critical appraisal of participatory art ([2012](#bibliography.xhtml#ref25), p. 18). I share Bishop's concern to find a suitable vocabulary and frame of analysis that will do justice to the complexity of participatory practices, rather than assessing them with unfitting standards. She proposes a 'transversal aesthetic' in the spirit of Félix Guattari, an agonistic approach inspired by Chantal Mouffe, and 'an aesthetic regime that is constitutively contradictory' in the spirit of Jacques Rancière (Bishop, [2012](#bibliography.xhtml#ref25), p. 278; Rancière, [2002](#bibliography.xhtml#ref150)). It is no doubt possible to find convincing examples of artworks where tension, friction, opposition and resistance may well be appropriate markers of critical participation in and through art. Yet I cannot dismiss the concern to intervene in and engage with the social in an ameliorative way as something external to or incompatible with the aesthetic. An agonistic approach, understood in Mouffe's sense of the term (Mouffe, [2013](#bibliography.xhtml#ref136)), may well characterize some critical modes of participation. Yet to turn this into an imperative, into the necessary and/or sufficient criterion for deciding the aesthetic autonomy of artistic practices, is to disavow the privileges of a certain class or social position and simultaneously to universalize that position. Artists and activists often have to work out of compromising situations and find ways to break out of the conundrums of oppositional refusal vs. tactical embrace, as the Sudanese example above cautiously demonstrates. To refuse to participate in institutions is, as Eyal Weizman compellingly argues, 'an option only for those who can and otherwise will act' (Weizman, [2011](#bibliography.xhtml#ref201), p. 11).

The category of participatory art can therefore be both generative as well as restrictive. Its position across disciplines and institutions allows for new terms and references to emerge, yet this proliferation of terms is accompanied by the quest to mark participatory art as a distinct class of practices with common, recognizable, exemplary characteristics, as a genre. This suggests a certain unresolvable tension in the political economy of such genre formation, a law of genre that Jacques Derrida and Avital Ronell describe as 'a sort of participation without belonging -- a taking part in without being part of' (Derrida and Ronell, [1980](#bibliography.xhtml#ref69), p. 59). Affiliation to a given type of participatory []{#chapter01.xhtml#pg_49}practice is thus never far from exceeding those same terms of affiliation. This becomes evident not only in the process of charting the terminologies and typologies of participation, but also crucially in the way institutions embrace participatory art forms, or conversely in the way participatory art can turn into a gesture of institutional critique.

**Participation and impact**

'Art is not a mirror held up to reality, but a hammer with which to shape it': this well-known adage captures the complex relationship between theatre and performance practices, the societies from which they emerge and to which they respond. It suggests that art can, indeed ought to, impact upon and transform reality, rather than seeking simply to depict and represent reality in a verifiable manner. It seems to contest the possibility of any simple, mimetic portrayal of reality altogether. For not only are there as many realities as there are ways of perceiving them, but something can only become a reality if we are able to first imagine its possibility. The adage invites us to reflect on who wields this hammer, and how it might be used to impact upon reality. The foundational question of theatre's social, cultural, political or ecological impact continues to productively preoccupy artists, scholars and critics. What are the ways in which we can think through participatory art's impact on the world? The notion of impact in conjunction with the arts remains an imprecise and unwieldy one, yet it seems to command significant power in the way it is repeatedly summoned to justify the necessity of the arts. This []{#chapter02.xhtml#pg_52}can be explained by the way in which the idea of impact has become a core feature in determining the cultural value of the arts by policy makers and public and corporate funding bodies. This chapter investigates the assumptions around impact in relation to participatory art, as well as the critical and methodological challenges of thinking them together. Using the 2012 Spanish-language production *Afuera: lesbianas en escena* (*Outside: Lesbians on Stage*) by the theatre collective Teatro Siluetas from Guatemala and El Salvador as a point of departure, the chapter reflects on a number of debates in theatre and performance scholarship pertaining to assessing and evaluating impact in relation to the question of participation.^[1](#chapter02.xhtml#fn1){#chapter02.xhtml#ft1}^ In closing, the chapter offers a number of points of orientation and aspects to take into consideration when undertaking a study of theatre's impact.

The notion of impact (from the Latin verb *impingere*, i.e. to 'press closely', 'fix firmly' or 'forcibly thrust') suggests that something leaves a perceptible mark or trace on its environment or surroundings. When used in relation to theatre and performance, impact seems to imply that they remain and resonate in some way with the world, that they have a palpable effect on those who partook of their making and presentation, especially after they are over. This is hardly surprising, given the ephemerality of theatre, and the medium-specific difficulty of preserving or reproducing theatrical works. Precisely because theatre seemingly vanishes the moment it is performed in the here and now (unlike a book that can be re-read and stored, or a film that can be copied and distributed, or a piece of music that can be preserved in the form of a recording), it seems to repeatedly prompt the question of impact in manifold ways. In conjunction with the field of participatory art, especially those forms with an explicit social objective, where either specific communities are involved in the performance creation process or audiences are integrated through interactive formats into the concept of the performance, the question of impact recurs with a heightened urgency. Funders are often the first to ask what impact a certain artistic intervention will make or has made on its target audiences. What is usually implied is not impact in a personal, affective sense: lasting (positive or negative) impressions, images, movements, scenes, moments that leave a mark on one's memory, resonating with one's emotions, or triggering visceral responses that []{#chapter02.xhtml#pg_53}may extend well beyond the duration of the performance itself. In relation to participatory art, impact tends not to refer to the cathartic effects of art on the spectator by way of a process of inner cleansing or clarification. Instead, it might refer to what a certain production has achieved by way of contributing to public opinion, or in shaping the discourse around a certain, possibly controversial, topic. What discussions has it triggered, how has it thrown open new ways of addressing or perceiving a certain problem? Impact might further suggest that a performance has a specific target audience who might be treated as beneficiaries, i.e. they will benefit in certain ways from the performance, it will have ripple effects on their lives, attitudes or social relations. To ask the question of impact is thus to inquire into the consequences of an artwork in other spheres of life: how has it contributed to or influenced any level of societal transformation? Impact could equally relate to those who are involved in the creative process, thus implying that the very act of participating in a theatrical production, regardless of the outcome, might serve an educational or other purpose.

The idea of impact is largely, but not necessarily always, positively connoted. This distinguishes it from related concepts such as efficacy, which is regarded as a socially productive function, complementary to the entertainment function of art (Schechner, [2002](#bibliography.xhtml#ref173), pp. 76--77). One might, for instance, speak of the negative impact of a certain performance in its propagation of an aggressive masculinity or its misogynist representations of women. In situations of crisis and violent conflict, theatre may play a part in fortifying cultural stereotypes and thus have a negative impact, serving to polarize rather than de-escalate a latent conflict.^[2](#chapter02.xhtml#fn2){#chapter02.xhtml#ft2}^ However, when we speak of theatre's impact, we tend to assume that there will be (or ought to be) one, and that it will be efficacious, hopefully bringing about some desirable change in our lives. This assumption is fraught with its own contradictions. By emphasizing impact, theatrical practices tend to be valued only in terms of their so-called 'usefulness' in other spheres, and not in their own right. Does it promote social cohesion? Does it raise awareness about problems?

Such a reduction of theatrical art to its benefits for society is a false estimation of its potentials. First, it is extremely difficult to trace any []{#chapter02.xhtml#pg_54}direct or causal link between a certain theatrical practice or event and its positive or negative social outcomes. Indeed, it would be more accurate to claim that no peace accords have been signed or ecological disasters been prevented due to the direct influence of participatory performance. Secondly, and more importantly, the potentials of theatre, like all art forms, are not calculable according to the logic of a benefit analysis. Rather than judging theatre and performance by the same standards of assessment that apply to, say, the impact of drinking water supply on public health, it is the very model of impact which needs to be attuned and realigned to the specific qualities of participatory theatre and performance. We therefore need to think of the impact of art in less quantitative or effect-based and more qualitative and affective terms. As James Thompson points out, in concentrating on output or function, 'we are in danger of losing sight of the art practice. We are becoming target not process orientated' ([2000](#bibliography.xhtml#ref187), p. 101). We need to rethink the assessment of impact in order to be able to pay attention to subtle, ambiguous and delicate indicators, which may not make sense in cost--benefit or utilitarian terms. The tools of gauging impact available to theatre and performance scholars ought not to be governed by a narrowly economic or technocratic, evidence-based rationale. Thirdly, and following from this, we can observe that even within the field, different traditions of performance practice entail different understandings of impact, which vary historically and regionally. Classical opera productions and participatory theatre workshops with children with autism operate in vastly different environments and reveal distinct interdependences between artistic and sociopolitical domains. Thus when the question of the impact of a certain theatre practice is asked, it is important to examine the assumptions implicit in the question and its possible claims around usefulness, applicability, causality and measurability, in order to determine a working understanding of impact that is befitting to the practice.

Notwithstanding the various assumptions surrounding the notion of impact in relation to the arts, it continues to be an idea that holds the heady promise of transformation and affective force in the world. The artistic and cultural life of a society is often regarded as the 'barometer' of its well-being, maturity and, indeed, degree of civilization. []{#chapter02.xhtml#pg_55}This widely held orthodoxy tends to assume that the study of impact is therefore about measuring and finding evidence for its existence, rather than interrogating its claims (Belfiore and Bennett, [2008](#bibliography.xhtml#ref19), p. 7). How can we speak about the impact of theatre and performance in the interpretive humanities, without falling prey to the tyranny of evidence and numbers? This is all the more relevant given the growing necessity for artists to demonstrate and quantify the impact of their artistic ideas in order to gain funding. A critical approach to impact could thus serve as a means to respond to funding policies from the grassroots level as well as expanding and shaping the conception of impact in a manner that is adequate to the diversity of the arts.

**Outsiders on stage: Teatro Siluetas**

The independent performance collective Teatro Siluetas (Spanish: 'silhouettes') was founded in 2011 by four women from Guatemala and El Salvador, self-identified as lesbian feminist activists, with the aim of using theatre as a means to reflect on the experiences of lesbian subjectivities in Central America. The members of the group are affiliated to and involved in various ways with autonomous feminist social justice movements on the continent. Following their participation in the activist initiative 'The Lesbian Feminist School' in Guatemala, they came together with the idea of continuing their activism using the modalities of theatre, with which all four were familiar or in which they were formally trained. To that extent, the formation of the theatre collective itself may be regarded as one indicator of the productive impact of their involvement in the feminist movement. Which is to say that the notion of impact is multi-directional; it is not only about theatre's impact on society but also about the way in which theatre is impacted upon by social developments. Two characteristics of Teatro Siluetas are pertinent in relation to the question of impact and participation: the choice of the organizational form of a collective and the foregrounding of a lesbian subjectivity in the artistic practice. In the following, I examine these aspects in detail in relation to their 2012 production *Afuera: lesbianas en escena* (*Outside: Lesbians on Stage*).

[]{#chapter02.xhtml#pg_56}For the members of Siluetas, it was important to organize the day-to-day practices of theatre in a way that questioned and changed the ways in which creative processes tended to be hierarchically organized, with predominantly male directors and playwrights having the voice of authority and actresses merely executing and embodying their ideas. Siluetas therefore collectively wrote and directed and produced a play through a process of experimentation and dialogical interaction, which not only included a horizontal communication between the four members of the collective, but also involved training with renowned artists, including dancers, choreographers and theatre directors such as Jesusa Rodríguez and her singer-songwriter partner Liliana Felipe from Mexico City, with whose input they completed the final version of the play *Afuera* (Cañénguez, [2015](#bibliography.xhtml#ref47)). Rodríguez and Felipe are known both for their lesbian-feminist performance activism and for their long-standing engagement with current political themes pertaining to the Latin American continent.

The choice of working as a collective has a well-known heritage in Latin American experimental theatre and performance history. The tradition of autonomous theatre collectives (*creación colectiva*) is often traced to the influence of the new theatre movement in Latin America, some of whose key representatives include Julio Castillo from Mexico, Enrique Buenaventura and Jacqueline Vidal from the Teatro Experimental de Cali in Colombia, founded in 1955, as well as Santiago García and Patricia Ariza from the group La Candelaria, founded in 1966 (Cortés and Barrea-Marlys, [2003](#bibliography.xhtml#ref59); Röttger, [1992](#bibliography.xhtml#ref169)). La Candelaria's approach to democratization revolved not only around the selection of appropriate themes for plays and around aesthetic questions, but crucially invoked a form of institutional critique. They called for theatrical institutions and groups to adopt participatory methods not only in their relations to audiences but also in their working processes.^[3](#chapter02.xhtml#fn3){#chapter02.xhtml#ft3}^ La Candelaria's members collectively shared responsibility for all aspects of theatre practice, from artistic direction to staging, lighting, costumes and production work, thus experimenting with alternatives to a playwright- or director-led theatre practice (Weiss, [1980](#bibliography.xhtml#ref200), p. 24). The performances of Teatro Experimental de Cali sought to actively pay attention to audience responses as a means of developing the complexity of a play over time (Taylor and []{#chapter02.xhtml#pg_57}Townsend, [2008](#bibliography.xhtml#ref183), p. 19). Influential figures such as theatre director Enrique Buenaventura highlighted the importance of theatre practitioners performing in both urban and rural settings, to a wide range of audiences: 'We are looking for communication basically in the relationship between play and audience. That is why our work and style are not directed solely to workers or peasants, but also to the bourgeoisie and students: colonial deformation concerns us all in different ways' (Buenaventura, [1970](#bibliography.xhtml#ref38), p. 155). Such an approach, envisioning the play and audience as communicating with each other, employs a broader conception of participation than merely the formal element of audience participation during a performance. It seeks a politicization of theatre practice through modalities of establishing dialogues with audiences, feedback loops in the dramaturgical process and what is today sometimes referred to as the 'outreach activities' of the arts.

The relationship between participation and impact can be further examined through the foregrounding of lesbian subjectivity in the work of Teatro Siluetas. One might regard the launching of a theatre group that specifically addresses the needs and lives of subjects regarded as marginalized and under-represented in the mainstream as an identitarian or minoritarian formation, with the purpose of gaining more visibility and acknowledgement in the public sphere. For Siluetas members, however, the motivation in founding a lesbian collective extends beyond an identity-based politics. Rather, the category of 'lesbian' presents for the theatre collective an intersectional lens through which all systems of oppression and inequality can be approached (Cañénguez, [2015](#bibliography.xhtml#ref47)). Thus it is possible to sharpen one's understanding of racism, ableism, or other forms of social discrimination through paying attention to the mechanisms by which women who are attracted to women are oppressed, for not only are different forms of oppression intertwined, but, conversely, the unique experience of identifying with the figurations of 'lesbian' in a Central American context offers a different perspective on mainstream society, politics and public culture, and sheds light on the construction of categories such as 'homosexual' or 'heterosexual'. The theatrical representation of lesbian lives in *Afuera* can thus be read not as a direct correlate to some authentic reality or indigenous []{#chapter02.xhtml#pg_58}identity, but as a means of unsettling and reimagining the terms of this reality.

The play *Afuera* addresses a range of issues, from lesbophobia, sexual violence and the role of religious institutions in the governance of sexual mores, to the prominent presence of religious conservatism in public affairs, in tandem with the strengthening of neoliberal economic policies put in place after the end of the civil wars in El Salvador and Guatemala in the 1990s. It also examines the lives of lesbians who challenge or try to escape from the binary gender construction with humour and lightness. It speaks of questions of loneliness, the absence of role models and popular cultural points of reference. In dramaturgical terms, it consists of a sequence of short scenes that combine a range of formats, from fragments of daily life experiences, monologues, dialogues, choreographed interludes, to humorous episodes, or elaborate *tableaux vivants*. The scenes sometimes involve conventional role-play, with four actresses playing characters such as a nun or a couple in love, shifting between *femme* and *butch* roles, well-wishers or people who ridicule lesbians. But there are also moments when they step out of their roles and address the audience directly in their own voices as members of the theatre collective and citizens of the society. This makes it difficult to view 'the lesbian' as merely a fictional character on stage, but urges audiences in a non-didactic and non-confessional manner to acknowledge a personally experienced reality on and offstage. Layers of prejudice and unquestioned assumptions about what the idea of sexual orientation implies are gradually peeled off, revealing the vulnerabilities and ambiguities of human existence.

The production *Afuera* toured across Guatemala and was performed not only in theatre venues, but also in schools, universities, community centres and female prisons, covering both urban as well as rural sites. These performances were accompanied by question-and-answer sessions with audiences, and workshops with young adults. The combination of theatre practice with educational, activist and outreach activities is widely found in many women's theatre initiatives in the continent (Underiner, [2004](#bibliography.xhtml#ref196)). A documentary film was made in 2013 about the performance *Afuera* with the financial support of the Dutch international development agency HIVOS and in collaboration with []{#chapter02.xhtml#pg_59}the network of Latin American artists Trasbastidores (Backstage). All these aspects of a performance's (after)-life are also pertinent to the assessment of its impact. What counts as impact, under which conditions? How can impact be evaluated and what are the methods available to theatre and performance scholars in this quest?

**On impact studies**

In thinking through the question of impact in the arts, a brief note on the prominent influence of the domain of social and economic impact studies is in order. This domain of research gained currency in the 1980s, at a time when urban regeneration programmes in Europe, the USA and other industrially developed regions of the world increasingly looked to arts and culture to fill the gaps that were emerging from the decline of industries in cities. Artistic and cultural activities gradually came to be regarded as an 'expanding economic sector' (Reeves, [2002](#bibliography.xhtml#ref159)). This led to the commissioning of studies that demonstrated how investment in the arts effectively led to greater economic growth or job creation in other sectors. Such advocacyoriented studies started from the premise that the arts are economically beneficial to cities, and looked for evidence of this in order to advocate public investment in the arts and in cultural activities and institutions. As Belfiore and Bennett point out, impact studies is motivated by an evidence-based approach to policy making, whereby pragmatism and an orientation towards 'whatever brings about the best results' serves as a guide to policy making, rather than ideals or principles derived from constitutional or long-standing culturally rooted grounds ([2008](#bibliography.xhtml#ref19), p. 5). The problems of such an evidence-led, economistic approach to studying impact have been widely criticized in cultural policy studies. All kinds of claims can be made about the benefits of the arts, and the search for impact can end up being based on indicators that are likely to produce the desired findings. In the logic of viewing the arts as an economic sector, the study of impact often becomes a matter of arguing that the arts generate employment, enhance social cohesion, or reduce crime, which in turn indirectly supports economic growth. Thus, despite a rationale of searching for evidence for art's social or economic benefits, deep-seated, []{#chapter02.xhtml#pg_60}unquestioned cultural norms and values pertaining to what counts as beneficial or has a positive transformative potential inform the way that impact is quantified. Conventional impact studies tend to be commissioned by organizations that support or fund the arts, which means that the findings of these studies tend to advocate various benefits and economically viable qualities of the arts, thus serving as advocacy reports rather than as research.

A further problematic aspect of the domain of impact studies is that it tends to predominantly value the arts along instrumental lines. The problem is not, as Belfiore convincingly argues, that a certain instrumentality is applied to the arts. Rather, the problem 'lies in the way in which the attribution of value to the outcome of aesthetic encounters has become part of the technocratic machinery of cultural policy-making' (Belfiore, [2015](#bibliography.xhtml#ref18), p. 96). Mostly quantitative understandings of value tend to determine whether or not a certain artistic practice is worth investing in. Thus, even within the economic logic, a very narrow understanding of 'more is better', underwritten by governmental policies of austerity and privatization, remains largely unquestioned (Fotiadi, [2017](#bibliography.xhtml#ref80)). Economic understandings of impact thus assume far more policy-related influence and importance than other, less utilitarian and more interpretive, subjective approaches. The political philosopher Wendy Brown argues that neoliberalism is 'an order of rationality', i.e. not only a set of economic policies or an ideology, but also a political imaginary, an order of reason that seeps into all human domains in the most unexpected ways and in manifold forms of articulation ([2015](#bibliography.xhtml#ref18), pp. 10--11). Every human need and desire becomes valued in economized terms, which doesn't necessarily just mean monetary terms, but a logic of profit, benefit, growth and expansion. This also extends to those spheres that were historically governed by different values, such as the arts, interpersonal relationships, children's upbringing, education, health and well-being, ecology, or spirituality. Impact studies in the arts, particularly those that seek to prove and rationalize the benefits of the arts and demonstrate them as worthy of receiving structural or financial support, face the risk of succumbing to a neoliberal logic, even while they may claim to be championing the arts.

I would like to move away from such an evidence-based, economically []{#chapter02.xhtml#pg_61}rationalized understanding of impact towards a more ambivalent, open-ended notion, encompassing diverse dimensions and modes of interrelations between artworks and the societies they emerge from and respond to. The study of impact cannot be separated from the conditionalities and agendas of who is interested in theatre's impact and to what ends. The evaluation of impact is not an end in itself (Isar and Anheier, [2007](#bibliography.xhtml#ref104), p. 4). What form a study takes largely depends on who commissions the research, to whom the results are presented, and how these results are used in policy making or structural decision making. Further, impact need not only be perceived as the effect of the big on the small, the powerful on the weak, or of institutions on individuals, but can also be meaningfully addressed from a multi-directional, systemic perspective, i.e. how non-institutionalizable acts and collective bodies in turn transform the structures into which they are placed, by which they may be restricted or empowered, but which never entirely constitute or define them. Impact need not be only positive and beneficial, and it is also the critical task of scholars to pay attention to negative aspects. This does not necessarily imply that it is a rejection of an artistic practice or its efforts altogether. There are many forceful arguments suggesting that participation need not have the same function in the arts as it does in other areas of public life, given that aesthetic criteria need not always tally with the criteria of democratic citizenship. To have the feeling of being excluded or invisible within the safe space of the theatre may be a powerfully disturbing aesthetic experience, enabling and triggering reflection precisely because it is set at a distance from exclusion and invisibility in society, however notional that distance might be. The socially critical participatory potential of an artwork may indeed lie in its not being 'useful' or 'applicable' in any empirically verifiable sense.

A number of scholars have made a case for such a critique of participatory art by suggesting that, instead of insisting on its being inclusive, cohesive and socially relevant, performance could counter-intuitively combat the ideology at work behind these commodified norms and not attempt to be a model consummation of macro-political causes. This critique has at least two variations. First, it is argued that meaningful impact through participation need not equal cohesiveness and consensus among participants, for dissent, []{#chapter02.xhtml#pg_62}disagreement, conflict and respect for alterity are as important to democratic political life as inclusivity, usefulness and cohesion, and the careful education that nurtures these is provided in the spaces and textures of the aesthetic. This strand of critique is most prominently developed by Claire Bishop, building on Chantal Mouffe's distinction between the *politics* and the *political* and a mobilization of Rancière's notion of dissensus (Bishop, [2012](#bibliography.xhtml#ref25); Mouffe, [2013](#bibliography.xhtml#ref136); Rancière, [2010](#bibliography.xhtml#ref152)). With a different emphasis, Irit Rogoff notes her suspicion towards so-called accessible artworks, or more specifically towards the demand for art to be accessible, which results in what she views as the instrumentalization of the question of *access* towards a client-oriented *accessibility* (Butt and Rogoff, [2013](#bibliography.xhtml#ref46), pp. 71--73).

Secondly, it is argued that the appearance of categories such as (inter)activity, cohesion, personal encounter and conviviality within the framework of art projects may well be a signal of their absence or disappearance in civic life in general and must therefore be regarded with caution. In *Artist at Work: Proximity of Art and Capitalism* ([2015](#bibliography.xhtml#ref122)) the dance scholar Bojana Kunst maintains that 'the production of sociality signals that art is actually closely intertwined with the processes of the disappearance of the sociality and political articulations of the public' (Kunst, [2015](#bibliography.xhtml#ref122), p. 52). Qualities such as communication, sociability or creativity have now become financialized in their logic and integrated into neoliberal economic roles in such a way that their radical function as artistic concepts has been altered. Hito Steyerl notes in a similar vein that 'what used to be work has increasingly been turned into occupation' (Steyerl, [2011](#bibliography.xhtml#ref180), p. 48), thus having no end, product or concrete instrumental relation, and this shift from work to occupation has also included the work of art becoming the occupation of art, so that instead of an end product, art consists of activity, which is deemed to be its own reward.

Curiously, just as 'uselessness' is invoked as a means of expanding what counts as impact, so also 'usefulness' as an aesthetic category can be invoked as a means of critiquing art's commodification. In her 'Introduction on Useful Art' ([2011](#bibliography.xhtml#ref36)) the Cuban-American artist and curator Tania Bruguera proclaims that it is time 'to put Duchamp's urinal back in the restroom'. Bruguera's statement is neither a conservative dismissal of Marcel Duchamp's work, nor of the conceptual []{#chapter02.xhtml#pg_63}shift in modern art that this canonical work of 1917, titled *Fountain/La Fontaine*, came to be representative of. She is not claiming that a urinal is not an art object in any given tradition of art criticism and must therefore be kept out of the sanctified exhibition spaces of art institutions. Rather, her statement is a reversal and expropriation of Duchamp's gesture, a call to take art and its institutions to places where it may be endowed with a lived purpose, where it does not remain a commodity or utilitarian item, but has the capacity to shift perspectives and sensibilities. Bruguera's statement may be interpreted as a call to rethink the task of the art world, not by turning the work of Duchamp into a formula and bringing more and more ready-made or day-to-day objects into formal art spaces, but rather by honouring the critical logic of its appearance. Duchamp's urinal, in its own moment, was a provocation to art institutions and their taken-for-granted modes of production and consumption of art. By installing an object of everyday life in an art gallery, he sought to draw attention to the interdependent relationship between what becomes an artwork, the contexts of its reception, and its institutional affiliations. Its status as art consists in its revelation of the *logic* of the artwork in a particular system of art (Meireles, [2007](#bibliography.xhtml#ref134), p. 183). It is thus no coincidence that Bruguera referred precisely to Duchamp in order to make a point that seems, at first glance, to be at odds with Duchamp. Art objects such as *The Fountain* followed the Dadaist impulse of making the distinction between art and life useless, by bringing into focus the logic by which objects come to be regarded as art or not. Bruguera's call for a return of the urinal from the art gallery to the toilet seeks to both employ and undo this conceptual impulse provided by Duchamp, in order to pursue a project of what she terms 'useful art' (*arte útil*).

This is not a simple repetition of the debate between engaged art in opposition to art for art's sake. Even when taken literally, Bruguera's proposition poses intriguing questions. For what would it mean to return the use value to the urinal that is now elevated to the status of a canonical artwork, with its attendant art-historical debates and processes of commodification? What would it mean to allow it to become the thing it stood for, and simultaneously retain its exchange value in terms of its history as a provocative artwork? The gesture suggested []{#chapter02.xhtml#pg_64}by Bruguera calls for closer attention to the forms of participation that the artwork might generate when 'put to use', and thus claims the recognition of these operations as art. It invites a recognition of the paradigm shift that occurs when the aesthetic judgement of art is linked to its use or application, particularly to the participatory experiences it accesses.

Sometimes the radical potential of an artistic practice lies in its usefulness, and at other times in its refusal to be useful. If both usefulness and its inverse can be regarded as modes of critical practice in relation to participatory art, how then to make sense of a category that can mean so many, sometimes contradictory, things at different moments, and is nevertheless claimed as a distinctive aesthetic mode? Teatro Siluetas is acutely conscious of this dialectic. The play *Afuera* repeatedly references the systemic violence towards women in Central America. 'Are you lesbians in real life?' asks a school pupil during an after-performance discussion in rural Ciudad Quetzal, Guatemala, and when Teatro Siluetas members say 'Yes', the classroom bursts into a round of applause, a mix of embarrassment and admiration. The 'lesbian' comes to life by stepping out of the fictive construction of the performance, she is given the possibility of existing, not as a victim of abuse or as a potential threat but as an embodied subject, recognizable, reachable. Such moments reveal how restrictive it is to draw a neat line dividing the seemingly symbolic space of the theatre and the presumably real space of social and political coexistence, as if the former were a mere service provider or pet animal offering solace and entertainment to the latter, or as if the latter by definition could safely exclude the unruly realms of imagination and the impractical dimensions of the aesthetic. The participation of audiences in the life of a performance and the impact of performance on their lives are questions that need to be answered in ways other than the purely functional, or in terms of costs and benefits. The relevant issue is not a definition of participatory art and its formats, but rather an elaboration of the problems highlighted through participation in its multiple expressions and histories.

The history of the term 'participation' in the field of public policy and international development has no doubt influenced its trajectory in the arts, particularly in terms of the strong preference []{#chapter02.xhtml#pg_65}for participatory art forms in programmes funded through developmental schemes. Perhaps both the quest for the positive social impact of the arts as well as scepticism towards the imperative of 'usefulness' can be traced to the ascendancy of 'participation' in the context of international development.^[4](#chapter02.xhtml#fn4){#chapter02.xhtml#ft4}^ The political economist and development theorist Pablo Alejandro Leal explains the rise of the term 'participation' as 'a new battle horse for official development' as coinciding with the so-called structural adjustment programmes imposed on most countries of the Global South by the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund beginning in the 1980s ([2011](#bibliography.xhtml#ref124), p. 71). Using the debt of poor countries as leverage, a sweeping array of privatization, austerity and trade liberalization policy measures were imposed on countries in Africa, Latin America and South and Southeast Asia, most of which were euphemistically labelled as people-friendly, bottom-up approaches, in which terms such as participation, empowerment and civil society were rediscovered as blueprints of governance (Cornwall and Eade, [2010](#bibliography.xhtml#ref58)). Leal reads the concept of 'participation' as having been particularly co-opted and sanitized, because it is drawn from a paradigm in which the principal objective is not institutional development or stability, but social justice and structural change ([2011](#bibliography.xhtml#ref124), pp. 71--72). From its historical association with radical pedagogy (Freire, [1968](#bibliography.xhtml#ref81)), social movements and direct action (Fals-Borda and Rahman, [1991](#bibliography.xhtml#ref73)), and citizenship rights (Chandhoke, [2003](#bibliography.xhtml#ref48)), the notion of 'participation' can be observed as mutating its way into the status-quo-ist vocabulary of 'maintaining relations of rule, neutralizing political opposition and ... taxing the poorest' (Cornwall and Brock, [2005](#bibliography.xhtml#ref57), p. 1046).

The problem is, of course, not simply a matter of a concept being disembowelled into hollow jargon. As Wendy Brown has argued, the matter of real concern is the absorption of a concept into the neoliberal political imaginary, into an all-pervasive order of rationality (Brown, [2015](#bibliography.xhtml#ref35), pp. 10--11). The concept of participation is thus mobilized in the maintenance of the interests of the powerful, an insidious shift from being a collective, autonomous demand to becoming a managerial imperative, which allows the state to devolve its responsibilities on to citizens, financializing citizenship into a form of entrepreneurialism and re-centralizing in the guise of decentralization (Brown, [2015](#bibliography.xhtml#ref35); []{#chapter02.xhtml#pg_66}Pearce, [2010](#bibliography.xhtml#ref146), p. 15). On a smaller scale, the 'tyranny of participation' could imply that participatory processes are dealt with as a matter of technical administration, overriding legitimate concerns through a focus on methodological revisionism (Cooke and Kothari, [2001](#bibliography.xhtml#ref56)). The call for wider and deeper participation in public affairs, where even the most disadvantaged citizens have a say in matters that affect their lives, is reduced to questions of format or procedure: crowd-sourcing takes the place of collective action, user-generated content management systems mimic equitable access, do-it-yourself and self-service become attractive as consumer mandates rather than as political tools. Critics of neoliberalism repeatedly point out the dangers of focusing exclusively on participation as a developmental tool or a method in project work, at the cost of ignoring the broader ideological or political canvas or the underlying processes of active citizenship. The received wisdom of the overwhelming benefits of participation need to be weighed against the experiences in the field (Hickey and Mohan, [2004](#bibliography.xhtml#ref98), p. 1). The methods of audience participation may be well intentioned and based on progressive democratic principles; however, if they are deployed in ways that undermine these principles, they become coercive or 'tyrannical' (Cooke and Kothari, [2001](#bibliography.xhtml#ref56)). Conversely, even under clearly repressive conditions, collective participation may prove to be effective in contesting pervasive norms. The mere performance of a play on lesbian relationships in the parish hall of a small town in Guatemala may be impactful in ways that neither the play nor its audiences may fathom or have been able to foresee. No regularities can be projected on to participatory practices, nor should the concept be underpinned by a linear or evolutionary idea of impact (Cleaver, [1999](#bibliography.xhtml#ref51)).

The debate between the utopian ideal and the watering down of participation seems to have moved on with what seems to me a significant conclusion, namely that the critical recognition of the dangers of co-optation should not imply that the concept be discarded altogether. The task of revaluing participation, whether in social development theory or in the arts, lies in the extent to which practices are firmly committed to societal and structural transformation rather than to the objectives of statecraft or mere formal innovation (Hickey and Mohan, [2004](#bibliography.xhtml#ref98)). Reading political and social discussions of participation []{#chapter02.xhtml#pg_67}covering four decades of transnational development policy turbulence, it becomes evident that there is sufficient commitment by scholars and activists to the ideals of the concept for them not be satisfied with a critique of the ways in which participation is contorted into a neoliberal rationality, however necessary and indispensable such a consistent critique might be. How therefore to critique participation and its attendant quest for impact in a constructive way, as something one cannot do without? How might this stance be understood in the realm of the arts, given that the notion of participation circulates in aesthetic, cultural, social-political and economic realms in very different ways?

**The problem of aggregation**

One of the critical challenges in studying participatory theatre's impact lies in determining its scale, scope and intensity by paying attention to the particularities of every specific instance. We could start by asking what exactly we refer to when we speak of participatory theatre: a single performance, the work of a theatre group, a tour or festival, a play script, the acting skills of one actress, or a certain formal characteristic? When we speak of impact, what are the time and geographical ranges we seek to or are able to address? Are we interested in individuals or communities, in the short or long term, in the local or regional or transnational, and why? Being explicit and specific about the grids of our frameworks is crucial, simply because different understandings of the arts, of communities and of the scope of impact will lead to different outcomes (Guetzkow, [2002](#bibliography.xhtml#ref90)). In the case of Teatro Siluetas' show *Afuera*, the framework of analysis might be restricted to a single performance, or its entire production history, i.e. all the performances in different locations, or additionally include the documentary film that can be viewed online. If one is interested in addressing the impact of the process of performance making on the actresses and their social environments, the framework might be extended to the entire process of conceptualizing, rehearsing and producing the performance. It can be further expanded to include the ways in which the performance circulated to other parts of the world, through donor agency reports, or by way of invitations to the theatre []{#chapter02.xhtml#pg_68}group members to LGBTQI events, and academic scholarship. This selection depends on what we can access in depth and what we are interested in finding out. If we ask the question of the impact of Latin American lesbian feminism on the practice of collective, collaborative dramaturgy, we obviously need to attend to the rehearsal and conceptual processes as well as to the specificities of lesbian feminism in Guatemala and El Salvador far more than to audience responses. If we are interested in the impact of the performance on attitudes towards sexuality among young adults, we must look for ways to access and communicate with young adults who have seen the performance, independently from or in addition to what may be available to us via documentation or reports by the theatre group.

The broader question here is that of aggregation, namely how to interconnect the micro with the macro levels. How can we claim with any certainty that there is a connection between the ticket sales for the show and a growing acceptance and liberal attitude towards homosexuality in society? Causality is a tricky principle when it comes to studying the arts. It is a fallacy to claim, for instance, that urban audiences in Guatemala were more receptive to the topic of lesbianism than rural audiences, *because* there was more laughter and applause in the former than in the latter. There is no direct causal link between applause for a show and the social openness towards a taboo topic that is the subject of the show. On the contrary, it is well known that what is widely accepted and appreciated by audiences within the imaginative space of performance may equally meet with hostility and violence on the streets (Butler, [1988](#bibliography.xhtml#ref42)). Audience laughter during a scene when two women kiss on stage may well be an expression of embarrassment, ridicule or even of a sense of disgust, just as the laughter of teenage school pupils at a performance in a high school may be an indicator of a healthy emotional receptiveness and curiosity towards sexuality and love, or indeed a mix of emotions. It requires heightened caution and sensitivity as a viewer and researcher to distinguish between appreciative and disapproving responses and draw conclusions based on them.

Taken together, the specificities of the performance and its interaction with its contexts or situational settings form a conceptually open arrangement rather than a fixed observational perspective of []{#chapter02.xhtml#pg_69}participation (Cohen and Uphoff, [2011](#bibliography.xhtml#ref53), p. 43). As a methodological guideline, it suggests that the internal dynamics and modalities of participation cannot be entirely viewed at a remove from its external modes of circulation. The crucial implication from this for analysis is that, unlike many debates in the arts on autonomy vs. heteronomy, this model envisions an artwork's self-contained, aesthetic features (its 'autonomy') being thought in continuum with, rather than in opposition to, its interconnectedness to the world and the context it is situated in (its 'heteronomy'). It can be observed that the interest in understanding participatory modalities and conceptualizing them in relation to the problems of society is a shared problem that is pursued in different ways in the social sciences and in the arts. Finding ways to study and interconnect audience participation in performance with performance participation in its immediate and broader social, cultural, political or economic environment seems to be one of the most pressing tasks of scholarship on participatory art. This partly involves being attentive to the fluctuating boundaries between the aesthetic and the non-aesthetic rather than seeking a disciplinary cartography that can supposedly contain and settle them. It might be achieved through an investigation of how the political or social premises underlying the call for participation are reimagined through an aesthetic register, such as modes of representation or theatrical devices such as allegorization, de-familiarization or distancing. Conversely, it could pertain to how artistic strategies of shaping audience participation render visible the failures and possibilities of people's participation in the public sphere, as in works that problematize exploitative labour conditions or political repression by mimicking them, over-identifying with them or making them evident through a process of exaggeration (BAVO, [2007](#bibliography.xhtml#ref15); Holmes, [2009](#bibliography.xhtml#ref99)).

Gareth White's *Applied Theatre: Aesthetics* ([2015](#bibliography.xhtml#ref204)) proposes expanding the kinds of activities considered relevant to a participatory aesthetic, suggesting that we should look not only at performances as distinct works, but place them in a longer-term aesthetic continuum with workshops, rehearsals, after-talks, meetings with the artists, try-out sessions, installations and other para-theatrical events ([2015](#bibliography.xhtml#ref204), p. 61). The research group *'*Assemblies and Participation' based in Hamburg, Germany, similarly seeks to connect dimensions and contexts []{#chapter02.xhtml#pg_70}of participation, by asking which new forms of assembly and participation can be imagined today, and how they might be honed within the realm of theatre and performance to be adequate to the needs and demands of democracy and social action (Burry et al., 2014). Formats such as lecture-performances, school classroom activities or assemblies in public spaces are explored in this study through participatory artistic means. The now defunct Indonesian journal of performing arts, *Lebur*, offers another instance of a multidisciplinary and unorthodox approach to cultural politics and questions of participation outside of formal academic platforms, thus including actions taking place in the streets, in market squares and on university campuses.^[5](#chapter02.xhtml#fn5){#chapter02.xhtml#ft5}^ Such analyses attest to the myriad ways in which participatory performance and civic participation intersect.

*Institutional impact*

One of the possible ways to resolve the problem of aggregating the relation between the performance and society at large is to define and delimit the analysis to specific societal institutions, and examine the points of contact between the performance and these institutions. These could include artistic and cultural venues but also community centres, schools, universities, prisons or church-run institutions. Such institutions can be regarded, in the sense of Louis Althusser, as ideological state apparatuses, which reinforce the dominant ideology without using repressive force or violence (Althusser, [2014](#bibliography.xhtml#ref7)).^[6](#chapter02.xhtml#fn6){#chapter02.xhtml#ft6}^ The performance *Afuera* premiered on 26 January 2012 in the Teatro de Bellas Artes of Guatemala City, a cultural institution under the aegis of the Guatemalan Ministry of Culture and Sports. Laia Ribera Cañénguez, a member of Teatro Siluetas, describes in an interview the difficulties in finding a venue that was willing to host this particular performance, because theatres did not want to risk their reputations by hosting a group that openly talked about lesbianism ([2015](#bibliography.xhtml#ref47), p. 246). The fact that Teatro de Bellas Artes hosted the event might be interpreted as a mark of the critical capacity of the institution. In showing its support to an independent lesbian feminist production in the face of widespread institutional caution and conservatism, it effectively took a public stance in support of reflecting on the social issues that the performance addressed. Who made the decision to []{#chapter02.xhtml#pg_71}include the performance in the programme? Were there prior connections to members of the theatre collective? Perhaps it lost some of its regular audience members in the process, perhaps it accessed a different public, or perhaps it led to new international connections. All these aspects could form the focus of an investigation. Similarly, we could inquire into the impact on those institutions that hesitated or categorically refused to host the performance. Was there an internal discussion prior to the decision, how were the hesitations regarding the play formulated, how did the institutions perceive their own social responsibility? Since the performance toured to various other countries and was shown in venues such as universities, schools and church centres, the institutional responses and afterlife of the performance offer possibilities for analysing its social impact on institutions with which it came into contact. Since these institutions made it possible for people who would presumably never buy a ticket to go and see the show in Guatemala City, to view the performance in a familiar environment, it is no exaggeration to claim that the outreach of the performance expanded greatly by virtue of being shown under the purview of these rural institutions.

The performance also triggered some discriminatory responses from institutions. In Costa Rica, the performers were asked to leave a café where they had gathered after a show, since the owners felt that the presence of lesbians would be a bad influence on children (Cañénguez, [2015](#bibliography.xhtml#ref47), p. 247). In anticipation of protests or objections to the play, the theatre group took security measures at the performance venues, to prevent damage to property or personal injury. One of the performers was asked by her family to leave Guatemala, in order not to blemish the family's reputation. This indicates that performances (or public perceptions and projections of what a performance is about) can trigger very real social repercussions, which are enacted by institutions. These can come from strangers as well as from families and close networks. These impacts can consist of a motley of negative and positive responses, ranging from sentiments of moral outrage and offence on the one hand to accolades and praise from the press on the other.

In all this, the performance realistically constitutes but one of several factors that impact on institutional attitudes, policies or practices. []{#chapter02.xhtml#pg_72}There is thus at best an indirect correlation between the level of participatory involvement of an institution and the extent of public impact it may have. The models of institutional participation can thus range from contributory or collaborative, to co-created and hosted projects, without one necessarily being better than others (Simon, [2010](#bibliography.xhtml#ref176), p. 187).

*Impact on individuals*

Yet, while it might be possible to gather statistics on the demographics of the audiences, and make qualified observations about the ways in which a performance influences, critiques or interacts with institutions, this still leaves open the question as to how to qualitatively assess a performance's impact on individuals. Audience responses have served as the primary route for assessing the individual dimensions of impact (Bennett, [1990](#bibliography.xhtml#ref23)). While this study does not have the scope to address the methodological and theoretical complexities of audience and reception research, I would like to underline one point, at the risk of overstating the obvious, namely: every utterance about a performance and the impact it has on an audience member needs to be carefully contextualized. It cannot be taken at face value or viewed as a validation for an external, objective reality. Precisely because our access to these contexts is likely to be limited, great caution is called for in deriving generalizations. In the case of *Afuera*, the overwhelmingly positive and supportive responses of audience members towards the performance stand in contrast to a social and political climate that is extremely hostile to those who do not conform to the norms of heterosexuality. How to make sense of this disjunction? To find an answer to this question, it is worthwhile examining some of the individual responses more closely.

Interaction with audiences, specifically with young people and women from working-class and indigenous backgrounds, was an important motivating factor for Teatro Siluetas. The performances thus regularly featured after-talks with the public. They also offered the opportunity for audience members to write down their questions anonymously on a piece of paper, in case they did not feel comfortable asking something directly. One such note they received asked the unassuming question: 'Es bonito ser lesbiana?' (Is it nice to be []{#chapter02.xhtml#pg_73}lesbian?). Cañénguez cautions against reading this remark as an innocent response from a simple, good-hearted, rural woman ([2015](#bibliography.xhtml#ref47), p. 249). Rather, she suggests contextualizing such positive responses against the backdrop of a society recovering from a protracted civil war, in which self-pride and respect for a community's identity had become important means of recovering from violent conflict. The play's choice of deliberately not depicting lesbians as victims, and not speaking with tones of self-pity and resentment, allowed for diverse forms of audience empathy and identification. This also explains responses such as the following: 'I thought I was coming to see a lesbian play and I wanted to show my solidarity, but through the play I ended up thinking about my own relations, my construction of gender and I felt that it spoke to me very personally' (Cañénguez, [2015](#bibliography.xhtml#ref47), p. 245). Instead of serving an identity politics, i.e. speaking primarily to those (few) who might self-identify with the protagonists of the performance, and thus treating lesbian subjectivity as a state of exception, *Afuera* looks for grounds of commonality with audiences. The specific loneliness that the figures in the play experience might thus be accessed as a universal, human emotion. One struggle for human dignity and recognition is not equivalent to, but also not separable from, another. When audience members say they are *touched* or *moved* by witnessing the vulnerability of another body or by the life story of another person, we are compelled to widen our understanding of impact to include not only social, political or economic *effects*, but equally psycho-physical *affects*: those forces other than or complementary to rationality, linearity, causality and cognition, which propel us in various directions in our lives and worlds (Gregg and Seigworth, [2010](#bibliography.xhtml#ref86)). These cannot be measured or valued in any empirical manner, but require an interpretive register that can encompass subjective, visceral, emotional, experiential and sensorial traces.

**Gradations of participation**

The problem of aggregation, i.e. the relationship between participatory art and its social impact, can be further described in terms of a spectrum of various levels of intensity of participation. Pablo Helguera proposes such a multi-layered typology based on formal []{#chapter02.xhtml#pg_74}criteria, distinguishing between so-called single-encounter events and those artworks that involve participation over a longer period of time (Helguera, [2011](#bibliography.xhtml#ref97), pp. 14--15). *Afuera* combines both these levels, employing a longer term collaborative process between lesbian activists in creating a performance and touring to several places, as well as single-encounter events, eliciting audience participation in after-performance discussions. To this quantitative distinction Helguera also adds qualitative components. In the case of single-encounter events, he distinguishes between nominal and directed participation, i.e. where the public participates via contemplation and detached reflection, as 'regular' spectators, or where audiences are asked to follow certain pre-scripted instructions. In those practices involving a lengthier process of interaction, Helguera further distinguishes between a creative participation on the one hand, i.e. where audiences provide ideas or inputs within a structure pre-determined or devised by the artist or given in the method, and a collaborative participation on the other, i.e. where responsibility for the artwork's structure and content is shared between the artist and audiences, who become collaborators or co-creators (Helguera, [2011](#bibliography.xhtml#ref97), pp. 15--16). A further threefold distinction proposed by Helguera is based on the conditions of participation, namely that between voluntary (i.e. active and willing), non-voluntary (i.e. mandated, prescribed) and involuntary (i.e. unknowing or coincidental) modes of participation, a categorization derived from a study on social work by John Poulin ([2011](#bibliography.xhtml#ref97), p. 15; [2000](#bibliography.xhtml#ref149)). By framing participation in terms of being voluntary, involuntary or non-voluntary, Helguera makes a useful technical distinction, for instance between a performance in which one is given certain tasks to perform without having the option not to perform them (non-voluntary), and an art installation that involves stepping on objects in a public space, without being aware of an intended interactivity with those objects (involuntary).

Jen Harvie reads these gradations of conditions with reference to the efforts of participants in terms of labour and leisure, terms belonging to a political economy of participatory art ([2013](#bibliography.xhtml#ref94)). Harvie asks what kinds of labour are immanent to different forms of participation, under what conditions they serve as a form of outsourcing or crowd-sourcing, potentially dumbing down audiences, and when []{#chapter02.xhtml#pg_75}they might lead to a heightened awareness of the conditions of work in socially committed art (Harvie, [2013](#bibliography.xhtml#ref94), p. 60). Regarding the performance by Teatro Siluetas, these questions can only be answered with reference to the specific circumstances of its staging and its reception. To some extent such gradations of participation, from low to high intensity, from short- to long-term, correspond to the categories proposed by Sherry Arnstein in her often-cited essay 'A Ladder of Citizen Participation' ([1969](#bibliography.xhtml#ref10)). Arnstein was a member of a Washington-based research institute on community development and advisor to the city administration on issues such as citizen participation, following the student protests of 1968 across the world and the growing civil rights movement in the United States. Her typology of participation follows a hierarchical, juridical scheme, with the rungs of the ladder gradually moving from a less desirable manipulative concept of (non)-participation to the most desirable models of participation involving full citizen control.^[7](#chapter02.xhtml#fn7){#chapter02.xhtml#ft7}^ To what extent is this applicable to artistic practices, and how would it reflect the relationship between participatory art and the societal settings in which they take place?

The play *Afuera* attempts to highlight the otherwise marginalized perspective of lesbians in Central America, thus locating the voices of a minority centre-stage and demanding of the majority that they be quiet, listen and pay attention. The idea that the participation of as many as possible is the ultimate aim of participatory art is called into question, instead proposing a scenario that privileges a minoritarian perspective. This remains the case even when the performance is staged for an audience consisting largely of children or young adults. It would thus be inappropriate to claim that a fully collaborative, citizen-controlled or child-centred art project is better or more desirable than one involving minor gestures of participation, to the extent that the former may be dull and one-dimensional, whereas the latter may offer valuable provocations or imaginative moments (Fletcher-Watson, [2015](#bibliography.xhtml#ref77), pp. 29--30). The distinction between benign and undesirable forms of participation not only depends on the conceptual set-up of a performance practice, but is equally subject to the energetic unpredictability of a live moment. It may thus be necessary for theatre practitioners to move up and down the rungs of Arnstein's ladder of participation, as it were, shifting from a relatively []{#chapter02.xhtml#pg_76}authoritative position, which allows them to gain the trust of adolescent participants, to a collaborative position that leaves certain decisions and questions open to them (Fleishman, [2016](#bibliography.xhtml#ref76)).

Critics such as Bishop and Rogoff have pointed out that the aesthetic criteria of judgement regarding participatory art cannot be identical to the juridical, sociopolitical criteria of citizen participation in public life. Rather, this judgement demands the recognition and valuing of the act of participation in all its facets with a critical distance, from placatory involvement to co-ownership, from critical intervention to collaborative creation. Yet conversely, social justice movements and community-led organizational formations have often served as inspirational models and spaces of learning for artists (Finkelpearl, [2013](#bibliography.xhtml#ref75), p. 12), and have in turn catalysed and stimulated the concatenation of artworks and projects into such movements (Cohen-Cruz, [2010](#bibliography.xhtml#ref52); Raunig, [2007](#bibliography.xhtml#ref153)). Seen together, these two positions span from detachment to involvement, and from participation in the artistic encounter being either a means or an end in itself. The cultural sociologist Pascal Gielen maps these poles of the debate in terms of the gradation between what he terms as 1) the subversive and the digestive, i.e. ameliorative functions of art on a vertical axis, and 2) the auto-relational vs. the allo-relational practices on a horizontal axis ([2011](#bibliography.xhtml#ref84), p. 22). He argues that community art projects are located across various points of this grid, thus combining aesthetic or professional artistic standards and functions (i.e. the auto-relational, which emphasizes individual artistic goals and the subversive/critical function of art in the modernist sense), as well as criteria of sociability and embeddedness in the commons (i.e. the allo-relational, drawing upon art in its social context and the digestive or integrative functions of art). The difficulty of artistic interrogation lies not (only) in identifying the Weberian ideal-types from which certain practices depart, or in contrast to which they can be seen as hybrid practices, but rather in conceptualizing the possible, imaginative horizons they are seeking out. In that sense, the old problem of categories is worth revising in order to find new interstices and rifts, in which emergent practices locate their scope (Bharucha, [2007](#bibliography.xhtml#ref24), p. 400). The formal typologies presented here may certainly be useful as introductory tools of schematization. []{#chapter02.xhtml#pg_77}However, they ought to be employed as helpful points of departure and not as the main means of analysing and interpreting participatory art, as they remain schematic and tend to simplify complex, at times illegible and locally embedded, practices to a standardized, abridged grid.

In thinking through the challenges of what the impact of participatory theatre and performance might be, and how to critically approach it, I thus argue against a purely policy-oriented notion of impact that is underwritten by a rationale of utility and profitability. Instead I propose studying impact in its varied dimensions and inconvenient registers as well as in its unique contexts, while making as transparent as possible the objectives that inform us as researchers, and specifying the scope and scale of the areas in which one can realistically make claims of impact. Such an interpretive approach also requires methodological experimentation and a stretching of disciplinary horizons. To speak of the impact of a performance such as *Afuera* in Guatemala and El Salvador requires a heightened sensitivity towards and awareness of the sociopolitical context, and an openness to discuss issues and events that take place outside of the theatre in the strict sense. This involves a combination of performance analysis, supplemented by ethnographic research, audience research, social development as well as a close contextualization of the events that happen around and beyond the performance itself: from after-talks to press criticism to public interventions to everyday events. Arts scholarship offers us several typologies and ways of categorizing various formats of participation. The challenge of making use of this nomenclature in analysis lies in tracing and bringing to life the situatedness, the contradictions and the historicity of such participatory moments.

Participation continues to retain a discursive ambiguity; it oscillates between being a buzzword and a fuzzword (Cornwall and Brock, [2005](#bibliography.xhtml#ref57)), between offering the promise of emancipation and serving as a mechanism of maintaining the status quo (Burzynska, [2016](#bibliography.xhtml#ref41)), both in the realm of social development as well as in the arts. Critical readers might well wonder whether that ambiguity is only being further reinforced rather than resolved by thinking participation together with impact, thus insisting on a contextual appraisal. Indeed, it is true that the tension surrounding the concept is sustained throughout this []{#chapter02.xhtml#pg_78}study. The tension is not resolved by the fact that I am less interested in a formal definition of participatory art and more in an investigation of the problems it poses -- not which version of participation is the right one, but how participation occurs in ways that do not close down its potentials. In the case of *Afuera*, which is, strictly speaking, not a participatory theatre work, since it does not involve any audience participation on stage, I am interested in the larger parameters of how a theatre collective engages participatory forms of devising and collaboration, as well as the ways in which the performance seeks out different audiences and attempts a conversation between the performers in the collective and members of the public. Participation may sometimes be an end in itself, worth aspiring to because a collaborative, non-hierarchical communication in artistic processes is deemed worthwhile, no matter the outcome. At other times participatory formats may serve as a tool, a means to achieve a desired end, namely the articulation and acceptance of lesbian subjectivities in a broader social climate of violence and discrimination. Yet participation is also, or ought to be, more than a means and not only an end in itself.

**Notes**

[1](#chapter02.xhtml#ft1){#chapter02.xhtml#fn1}  The presentation of the case study *Afuera* in this chapter is based on an interview I conducted with Laia América Ribera Cañénguez from Teatro Siluetas, as well as documentary material. See Cañénguez ([2015](#bibliography.xhtml#ref47)).

[2](#chapter02.xhtml#ft2){#chapter02.xhtml#fn2}  Consider, for instance, the role of radio plays in inciting violence during the Rwandan genocide (Thompson, [2007](#bibliography.xhtml#ref185)). More recently, the use of blackface on stage has been heavily criticized in Germany and the Netherlands, pointing to the negative effects of caricaturing blackness, making its racist and discriminatory gestures invisible (Hoving and Essed, [2014](#bibliography.xhtml#ref101)).

[3](#chapter02.xhtml#ft3){#chapter02.xhtml#fn3}  Another way of explaining the emergence of *creación colectiva* practices is that they were a response to the absence of a national canon or of local contemporary playwrights who would supply texts for performance.

[4](#chapter02.xhtml#ft4){#chapter02.xhtml#fn4}  Participatory artistic practices appear in social science literature in three interconnected ways: first, from an anthropological or sociological perspective as cultural articulations and practices, studied in terms of the ways in which they forge a sense of identity or social cohesion or mark cultural difference (García Canclini, [2005](#bibliography.xhtml#ref82); Turner, [1975](#bibliography.xhtml#ref195)); second, as a therapeutic []{#chapter02.xhtml#pg_79}and pedagogical tool, thus in terms of the transformative potential of the arts at an individual or collective level (Da Costa, [2010](#bibliography.xhtml#ref63); Osnes, [2014](#bibliography.xhtml#ref144)); and third, as a tool or methodology for inquiry, data gathering and for generating insights that would not have been accessible through conventional methods such as interviews, focus group discussions or participatory observation (Guhathakurtha, [2008](#bibliography.xhtml#ref91); Kaptani and Yuval-Davis, [2008](#bibliography.xhtml#ref113)).

[6](#chapter02.xhtml#ft6){#chapter02.xhtml#fn6}  In an influential essay originally published in 1970, the philosopher Louis Althusser argued that the state and its subjects share not only a legal or territorial relationship, but also a psychological one, marked by ideology. A state controls its subjects not only through law-enforcement institutions and agents such as the police or the courts, but equally, and in a far more heterogeneous and decentralized manner, through cultural apparatuses such as schools, religious bodies, the social institution of the family, and the media. These so-called 'ideological state apparatuses' ensure that citizens comply with and subjugate themselves to state control by willingly and unquestioningly believing that their position within the state and its structures is a natural one. Althusser argued that through these ideological state apparatuses, subjects are hailed into being, they learn to recognize themselves and others and acquiesce to the place allocated to them, a process he termed 'interpellation' ([2014](#bibliography.xhtml#ref7)).

[7](#chapter02.xhtml#ft7){#chapter02.xhtml#fn7}  Arnstein's ladder of citizen participation begins with manipulation and therapy on the lowest rungs, which she characterizes as non-participation, moving further up to informing, consultation and placation (degrees of tokenism) and ultimately to partnership, delegated power and citizen control (degrees of citizen power) ([1969](#bibliography.xhtml#ref10), p. 217).

**The theatre of the oppressed for women's empowerment in India**

In May 2013 I spent two days as a participant-observer of a community theatre workshop for rural women leaders in the small town of Karur in Tamil Nadu, south India. The workshop was part of a year-long train-the-trainer programme using the methodology of the 'theatre of the oppressed', which ended shortly before the national parliamentary elections in India in May--June 2014. I took part in one out of nine workshops, so my observations are not intended to offer a comprehensive study of this particular case or of the style of facilitation of one specific practitioner; rather, the workshop offered an opportunity to reflect on the minor gestures that challenge and trouble widespread conceptions of participation, both in the arts, as well as in the sociopolitical realm. Making use of an inductive analysis, I draw broader conclusions from this specific instance. What caught my attention in the workshop were the various instances of what I would like to call unsolicited participation, moments wherein participants responded to the theatre exercises and workshop framework in ways that went beyond the roles and options offered to them. What do these uninvited forms of participation tell us about the relationship between participatory methods in theatre and the communities they seek to serve? What place do they occupy in existing conceptualizations of participatory art? A close examination of one workshop setting, identifying instances and gestures of unsolicited participation, []{#chapter03.xhtml#pg_81}reveals that these are at times defiant, at times cooperative, and at times evasive; it is no straightforward task to classify them as either subversive or subsidiary to established formats of participation. They may be perceived as reassuring to theatre practitioners regarding the efficacy of their participatory methods, or conversely as an indication of the methods not being adhered to, or, indeed, as participation without method or pattern. I will suggest that the concept of the 'gesture' is more accurate than the 'act', as the concerned moments are not legible in terms of intentional, full-fledged signifying acts, but as minor, small movements in the larger frame of theatrical action.

The workshop in question was initiated by S. Jothimani, a local Congress Party official and former general secretary of the Indian Youth Congress. Jothimani received a pilot grant from a Congress Party-led scheme called the Rajiv Gandhi National Women's Progress Scheme (*Rajiv Gandhi Rashtriya Mahila Vikas Pariyojana*), to kick off a grassroots participatory movement of women from her own district of Karur, which could then potentially serve as a model to be copied and implemented in other districts and states. She was given one year to demonstrate to the national party leadership that she could 'mobilize' a large number of rural women leaders, an extraordinarily absurd suggestion, as if a rural women's movement could be spreadsheeted into an administrative timetable. Nevertheless this was a challenge that Jothimani chose consciously to face, with and despite its contradictions. During a personal conversation on 28 April 2013, she mentioned that she stumbled upon the idea of using the theatre of the oppressed via a colleague, who had heard of this methodology during a visit to the USA.

The one-year framework was no doubt related to the election schedule, and in hindsight, following the massive losses of the Congress Party across India, including in Karur, one might speculate that the impossibly contradictory idea of a top-down 'grassroots' rural women's movement was a desperate bid to drum up last-minute political support for the Congress. The workshop was open to members or affiliates of any political party, though there was a preponderance of Congress Party members.^[1](#chapter03.xhtml#fn1){#chapter03.xhtml#ft1}^ Given the abrupt end of the training shortly before the elections in 2014, the absence of any follow-up activity despite strong interest and willingness among the participants, []{#chapter03.xhtml#pg_82}and the programme's disowning by the Congress Party candidate, it is not unjustified to conclude that the workshop series served as a cover for campaigning and recruitment activities. Participants whom I interviewed in 2015 expressed their deep disappointment at the discontinuation of the training, though they were all too keenly aware that it was an attempt to tap into the significant rural female voter population prior to the elections.^[2](#chapter03.xhtml#fn2){#chapter03.xhtml#ft2}^ Why they took part in the workshops, despite being cognizant of what was widely perceived as 'the empty promises of political parties, who appear right before and disappear right after the elections',^[3](#chapter03.xhtml#fn3){#chapter03.xhtml#ft3}^ is a crucial and pertinent question that strikes at the crux of the problem of participation.

The choice of Karur for such an initiative was not coincidental. The town of Karur is the capital of the eponymous district, located in the southern state of Tamil Nadu in India. With a population of approximately 1 million and counting approximately 200 villages stretched across nearly 3,000 square km, this district has a significant agricultural economy, and is increasingly becoming an important hub of the export-focused textile industry, as well as the construction industry. The invited participants of the workshop were about 15 women (and a few men) from the broader network of the Congress Party and allied organizations in the district of Karur. Some were seasoned party workers. In India they are sometimes referred to as 'barefoot party members' who are involved in party activities at a village and district level. Others were schoolteachers or community centre volunteers. Most of the women were from agrarian communities in Karur district. They do not work on their own land but toil as seasonal labourers on land owned by others during the agricultural season. For the rest of the year they engage in different types of informal labour, from selling flowers or street food to working in the textile and construction industries. They were invited to the workshop by word of mouth and with the offer of food and the reimbursement of travel expenses, and some of the women nurtured the hope of securing further employment in the National Women's Scheme.^[4](#chapter03.xhtml#fn4){#chapter03.xhtml#ft4}^ As is common in such settings, most of the participants did not know about the methodology of the theatre of the oppressed and had differing ideas of what the workshop would be about. It was more than evident that coming to the workshop for even three days required []{#chapter03.xhtml#pg_83}significant commitment in time, arranging child care and acquiring 'permission' from husbands or extended family members, and their motivation cannot simply be reduced to their receiving a minor monetary compensation. They are not subalterns in Gramsci's sense of having no access to social mobility, but belong to a liquid working class heralded by globalization in the 'threshold regions' of the Global South, with all its markings of precarity, caste and gender discrimination, as well as a flexibility in labour conditions that is post-Fordist without ever having been properly Fordist. The participants could not be easily lumped together as belonging to the same 'community', for the differences in caste, religious, economic and educational background, not to speak of political affiliations, were enormous, despite their sharing certain common features as rural or semi-rural women from the same region.

The workshop was conceptualized and conducted by Radha Ramaswamy, a community theatre facilitator and founder of the Bangalore-based NGO Centre for Community Dialogue and Change (CCDC). As an educationist who quit the formal education system after she came across the theatre of the oppressed in a workshop setting in the US in 2010, Ramaswamy has been using this methodology as a facilitator in various community and educational projects in India ever since. Like the participants in the series, she too was acutely aware of the problematic assumptions and premises of the women's mobilization programme in Karur, and yet, rather than declining on political or principled grounds, she opted consciously to work with the challenges of the given conditions, thus demonstrating a grounding in praxis and a commitment to developing a theory out of the concrete event and situation, rather than approaching it with a ready-made formula or template, or waiting for the ideal conditions to arrive.^[5](#chapter03.xhtml#fn5){#chapter03.xhtml#ft5}^

All the people involved in the Karur workshop series, whether the facilitator, the participants or the local Congress Party leader, clearly recognized the contradictions and problems inherent to the proposed aims of the theatre training and yet chose to work together and move on, notwithstanding the benevolent dangers of top-down calls for participation. Clearly a grassroots mass women's movement cannot be willed into existence, especially not by a political party []{#chapter03.xhtml#pg_84}with a history of poor governance, corruption and inefficiency, and a track record of offering little support to existing civil rights and social justice movements. And yet the theatre workshops offered the possibility of instrumentalizing to the best possible extent the terms and conditions of participatory governance, to steer belief in the power of the state towards the realm of play and experiment.

**Towards a critique of the critique of participation**

I went to the workshop with a hypothesis about participation in theatre. This hypothesis was not entirely proven wrong, but it was complicated by the observations I gathered during my brief presence in Karur. The hypothesis may be summarized as follows: when citizen participation comes as a requirement from the ruling powers, the people who are meant to be its beneficiaries either refuse to participate or do so by making a bad job of it.

This hypothesis is supported by critical literature from different disciplines, both in the humanities and social sciences. Sherry Arnstein's ladder of participation attempts to distinguish between the political implications of different modes of citizen participation, from a manipulative or placative participation to full citizen control ([1969](#bibliography.xhtml#ref10)). Arnstein argues that purely tokenistic forms of citizen participation can at worst lead to non-participation or at best to a form of therapy or consultation. Similarly in the anthology entitled *Participation: The New Tyranny?* (2001), the development sociologists and geographers Uma Kothari and Bill Cooke offer a fierce critique of the field of development cooperation and its tyrannical imperative of participation. They argue that participatory development can serve to both conceal daily oppression and simultaneously ensure that participants remain subjects of development, obscuring larger structural injustices by emphasizing micro-level modes of participation (Cooke and Kothari, [2001](#bibliography.xhtml#ref56), pp. 11--14).

In the arts and humanities, the critique of participation is routed through an examination of the relationship of artists and artworks to audiences, against the backdrop of the neoliberalization of the arts, with attendant restrictions on the political conditions of the arts, and questions of precarity and contingency. The critique of participation []{#chapter03.xhtml#pg_85}in the arts pursues four core arguments. Here I include various domains of the arts, wherein participation has become a debated topic, such as community-based or applied theatre and performance, immersive performance and the visual arts. The first line of critique refers to the contexts of participatory art, and claims that in a political climate that instrumentalizes culture and art for the aims of governance while simultaneously censoring dissident expression, audience participation in the arts can become a rhetorical tool of social engineering.^[6](#chapter03.xhtml#fn6){#chapter03.xhtml#ft6}^ The second argument, following from and closely related to the first, maintains that such practices tend to prioritize their potential for social cohesion and relationality at a micro-level at the cost of the possibility of a critical, ambivalent or antagonistic stance, thereby both overstating their claim to be social practices as well as raising the question of their very status as art.^[7](#chapter03.xhtml#fn7){#chapter03.xhtml#ft7}^ The third strand of critique of participatory art observes that methodological revisionism alone is insufficient to bring about a participatory citizenship or a radical aesthetic. Such practices may expand the genre of participatory art and add formal varieties, but they do not specifically offer new ways of conceptualizing participation through the arts.^[8](#chapter03.xhtml#fn8){#chapter03.xhtml#ft8}^ The fourth strand argues that artistic practices involving audience participation raise questions around labour, exploitation and custodianship, all of which affect the social and material relations of power in the arts.^[9](#chapter03.xhtml#fn9){#chapter03.xhtml#ft9}^

My own previous experiences as a facilitator showed that in such participatory theatre, where the terms on which people should participate are decided in advance, people end up regurgitating what they think they are supposed to do, rather than articulating their own voices or opinions. People may well take part in the theatre practice, but the result is aesthetically uninteresting and therefore undermines the idea that participatory theatre instils social or epistemic transformation (Bala and Albacan, [2013](#bibliography.xhtml#ref11)). I was quite convinced that this was because they did not ask for it themselves, but rather it was dished out to them as recipients of some seemingly benevolent ideal. One may well have ample participation, but that does not necessarily translate into an interesting aesthetic process or outcome: 'In other words, participation is easy. The creation of a new energy is the challenge' (Ziemilski, [2016](#bibliography.xhtml#ref209), p. 178).

All these points of criticism may seem to indicate an outright rejection []{#chapter03.xhtml#pg_86}of participatory community art forms, yet this was not the case. A certain caution towards the larger promises of participation did not offset the need for a renewed critical engagement with the concept and its performative practices. I initially assumed that the workshop participants would simply resist or refuse participation, if they did not have a stake in its objectives. However, I left the workshop in Karur realizing that the participants did not resist participation in the way we understand resistance to be oppositional, but instead took part in all kinds of unsolicited, unscripted and unexpected ways. True, the results of many of the exercises and games could be perceived as dull and uninspired; the participants seemed at times to be copying instructions mechanically, representations tended to be stereotypical, narratives tended to be stock and repetitive. Yet there was more to it; it could not be written off so easily as an instance of the rigidity of participatory community theatre interventions mirroring the rigidity of a heavily NGO-ized and bureaucratic public sphere (Kerr, [1991](#bibliography.xhtml#ref117); Plastow, [2014](#bibliography.xhtml#ref148)). These were extremely charismatic and intelligent women and men, all of them -- facilitator, organizer and target group. The parameters of their participation could not be properly recognized because they did not have a place in my existing grammar of participatory art, with notions such as 'empowerment', 'antagonism', 'transformation', 'the breaking of the fourth wall' or the 'do-it-yourself artwork', which suggested that participation in art was willed and guided by larger sociopolitical goals, seeking either cohesion or a transformation of the status quo through agency, opposition and resistance. However, several moments during the workshop made me reconsider this simplistic assumption. This seems pertinent not only to the specific developmental context of the theatre of the oppressed, but also in terms of a broader theorization of participation in the arts. In the following, I will elaborate on three such instances of unsolicited gestures of participation.

*The Colombian hypnosis -- variation high-/low-status exercise*

One of the workshop exercises was a variation of the exercise known in Boal's *Games for Actors and Non-Actors* as the 'Colombian hypnosis' (Boal, [2002](#bibliography.xhtml#ref27), p. 51). It explores status relations between so-called high vs. low positions. One person from the group volunteers to play the []{#chapter03.xhtml#pg_87}role of a high-status person, i.e. someone in a powerful position, or an 'oppressor' in theatre of the oppressed terminology. The task of this person is to ensure that their status is not impinged upon. The others in the group belong to the low-status category. Their task, in the course of the exercise, is to try to win over the high-status person, to make the oppressor capitulate, as it were. The rule of the exercise was that only the technique of hypnosis could be used as a means of communication, guiding a person's movement by holding a hand to their face, which is imagined as being hypnotically led by the hand, thus guiding the partner around the space in the desired direction without speech or the use of direct physical force.

One volunteer, who took on the role of the high-status person, came across as having difficulties with this exercise. Instead of using her high-status position to 'hypnotize' others, she seemed to be defending herself and viewed herself as under threat. My initial reaction was that she did not understand how to use the hypnosis technique, or did not grasp the difference between the low- and high-status positions. The group sitting around her in the circle joined the facilitator in shouting instructions out to her. Some tried to intervene to catch her attention. At one point, the high-status volunteer closed her eyes, yet still attempted to manoeuvre the low-status opponent away. Generally speaking, one cannot use the hypnosis technique with the eyes of the hypnotizer closed, so it seemed that she did not comprehend the rules. At another moment, two other participants in the group approached the high-status volunteer with two different tactics: one threw a scarf over her head, also a slight transgression of the rule of no physical touch; and the other tried to ridicule and make faces at the high-status volunteer, who remained seemingly adamant about holding her hand out to hypnotize the other, though she could not see whom she was manoeuvring, since her head was covered.

During the debriefing after the exercise, the high-status volunteer repeatedly stated that she was 'proud that she survived', or that 'she did not allow the attacks to lessen her determination', or that 'she stood it out on her own' and 'overcame all barriers'. Though she was supposed to be playing the high-status position, her actions and reactions indicated that she in fact felt that she was the oppressed, that the entire group was against her, and that it was she who had to []{#chapter03.xhtml#pg_88}fight them. Was this a case of her performing the task of participation badly, or was it an intelligent deconstructive twist of the exercise, an undermining of the binary between high and low or between oppressor and oppressed, a refusal of the victim or perpetrator role, even for the sake of an exercise? The manner in which the volunteer playing the high-status role improvised her role, gesturing towards what was not written in the role at all, indicated to me that she was seeking to set her own terms of participation.

*Blindfolded walk with objects*

This sensory and cooperation exercise is known by different names. It involves creating a path of obstacles made out of everyday objects, after which one person has to walk along the path blindfolded, without touching or stepping on any of the objects. The aim of the exercise is that everyone collectively helps the blindfolded person across by giving signals such as clapping, making sounds to indicate where they are and warning them about approaching barriers, all without using words. The instruction was that everyone had to be very quiet, so that the blindfolded person could clearly hear the guiding signals. Yet there was a lot of noise and chatter during this exercise at the beginning. Listening to the conversations while I stood at the side, I realized that some of the women were genuinely concerned about the safety of their objects, which they had placed on the floor in the centre of the room. I heard, for instance, someone commenting: 'I hope she doesn't step on and damage my water bottle, otherwise I will need to buy another one.' Another person hesitated to place their plastic sandal as an object in the space, removing it with a remark to another participant that it 'looked so cheap compared to other leather sandals', and replacing it with a handkerchief. Obviously, the placing of everyday objects would not have been an issue at all if done in a middle-class setting, yet in this context the everyday object was not an ordinary and thus dispensable one, but precious and acutely indicative of class and social differences.

When the group did become quiet, they appeared to circumvent the fun of the exercise by simply guiding the blindfolded person around the objects, rather than through them. This was clearly not a violation of the rules of the exercise, nor was it a demonstrative act []{#chapter03.xhtml#pg_89}of disregard, nor an explicit resistance to the terms of the exercise through a refusal to participate. What appeared at first glance to be a misunderstanding and simplified application of the exercise was perhaps a more complex attempt at participation by way of a reimagination of the exercise, with special care for the everyday objects used. Participation in the exercise was indeed solicited; however, the manner in which participants interpreted the rules of the exercise was unexpectedly non-compliant with the proposed terms of participation. The gesture of participation can thus be interpreted as one of simultaneous omission and commission, on the one hand not following the rules of walking through the maze of objects, though without any confrontation or oppositional stance, while on the other hand adjusting the aim of the exercise to protect the objects used as mere props. It would be futile to judge an omission in a theatrical context using juridical criteria, such as the breach of expectations, non-compliance or intentionality. Rather the omission itself becomes a form of commission through its processual, embodied effects. Non-participation can thus cover a range of expressive forms of leaving out or non-doing (Gronau, [2008](#bibliography.xhtml#ref87)).

*The uninvited guest*

A third instance of unsolicited participation took place during the last part of the workshop, when four sub-groups were formed, and each sub-group was asked to devise a two-minute improvised scene, wherein they were meant to show some situation of oppression from their own lives, using image theatre and other theatre of the oppressed techniques taught in the earlier parts of the workshop. One of the sub-groups presented a short scene with an actor who had not previously been part of the workshop. This new participant was the watchman of the building where the workshop was held, which happened to be a local engineering college. He was not an official participant in the workshop, and nobody knew his name. Rather he was a curious onlooker, who occasionally passed by to watch the exercises. When it came to staging the group scenes, it turned out that this watchman was in the role of the main character in a scene. The plot of this rough improvisation was that a woman could not pay the fees for her son to study in the school, and the school administrative []{#chapter03.xhtml#pg_90}official, played by the watchman, was rude and insensitive to her, humiliating her in public because she did not have the money to pay for her son's education. From my conversations with others in the group, it was not clear how the watchman managed to join the final performance. Some thought that he had asked if he could also act, saying that he enjoyed acting very much. Others thought that it would be good to include him in the role since they felt it should be played by a man, and there were not many men available. His involvement was certainly not perceived as an intrusion by any of the other participants. The facilitator expressed her surprise at the participation of someone who had so far been an almost invisible onlooker, but did not make an issue of it. The uninvited participant turned out to be enthusiastic about his role as an administrator and gave a rather long speech, much longer than the two-minute time frame allocated to the group, and had to be stopped by the facilitator when he started changing the plot.

These glimpses from the workshop pose the question as to how to make sense of these kinds of unsolicited participation or misinterpellation, which are partly para-theatrical, partly social-behavioural phenomena and in any case closely interlinked to the aesthetics of the participatory theatre practice.

**Between oversight and overestimation**

There are two common responses offered by current scholarship and thinking in the field, both of which carry their own dangers: I refer to these responses as 'oversight' at one end of the spectrum, and 'overestimation' at the other end. By oversight I mean that this kind of participation is not taken seriously or is totally ignored. It is not difficult to read this workshop as an example of community theatre work that is chaotic and of a low artistic quality, because the participants are not professionals, they seem to misunderstand the exercise and its execution is artistically unpolished. The workshop is not a concentrated and focused space, as compared to a professional theatre environment. These occurrences tend to not be mentioned in the reports of developmental agencies or in theatre scholarship.

The other kind of response, overestimation, carries the danger of []{#chapter03.xhtml#pg_91}reading too much into these acts of participation. I believe that it is crucial not to over-confidently conclude that these acts are oppositional, counter-hegemonic, subversive, examples of resistance and so on. Overestimation is thus the flipside of oversight in some senses, to the extent that it also stems from an insistence on searching for the efficacy of community theatre. The examples of unsolicited participation could lay bare an antagonistic or oppositional dimension, but they could also serve to reassert the status quo. They could be just as much mollifying as disruptive. One could not therefore conclude that these were implicit acts of criticism of the Congress Party or of the idea of a state-run women's movement. Not every act of unruly participation is transgressive. It would be incorrect to claim that the participants belonged to one homogeneous group that was subject to state negligence or control in the same way, just because they seemed homogeneous from afar. It would be oversimplifying to read subversion or resistance into these acts of misinterpellated participation.^[10](#chapter03.xhtml#fn10){#chapter03.xhtml#ft10}^ It would also be incorrect to see those on the formal, planning side of the workshop as a homogeneous group with the same interests. The local politician, the theatre facilitator and myself as theatre researcher each had very different investments and positions towards or within the scenario. Each approach to participation is marked by contingencies and ambivalences of varying degrees.

I came to the workshop with a hypothesis about participation in the arts, which argued that when citizen participation comes as a requirement, the people who are meant to be its beneficiaries either refuse to participate or sabotage it in other ways. At the end of the workshop I was beginning to realize the shortcomings of this hypothesis. During the short span of my participant observation in Karur, I noticed that the women and men in the workshop did not so much refuse to participate, but rather offered a rearrangement of the terms of participation, which could at times be very sophisticated. So where there is a formalized conception of participation, there seemed to emerge corresponding organic, non-formalized, non-conforming and unsolicited acts of participation.

Current conceptions and literature about participatory art tend to make a distinction between 'good' and 'bad' kinds of participation. There is an assumption that 'good' participation is bottom-up, horizontally []{#chapter03.xhtml#pg_92}organized, aesthetically autonomous and opening or paving the road to some kind of broader institutional, social or political transformation. The theatre of the oppressed is often considered or considers itself as belonging to this category. On the other hand, it is assumed that there is also a 'bad' kind of participation, which is top-down, inherently reflecting the model of neoliberal, entrepreneurial governance, whereby participation becomes a means of placation, minimizing friction or the devolution of public responsibility. Even where it may be innovative, it is ultimately more aligned to the creative industries or to regimes of governmentality, to sustaining the funding possibilities for NGOs, and not to critical practice (Bishop, [2012](#bibliography.xhtml#ref25)).

Observing the unsolicited acts of participation in the workshop, this division between a benevolent and a malevolent approach to participation seems unsatisfactory. Perhaps it is more accurate to say that there are two dimensions of participation, which can be found together: the formalized dimension, for example the description of the rules and games in Augusto Boal's handbook *Games for Actors and Non-Actors* or the concept that every trainer designs and uses in their facilitation of the workshops, as well as the non-formalized, unsolicited dimensions of participation. The workshop facilitator, Radha Ramaswamy, with whom I discussed this hypothesis, argues that the methodology of the theatre of the oppressed does in fact have a formal place for such uninvited interventions, and thus they cannot be viewed as outside of or opposed to the formalized concept, but are very much a part of and an outcome of it.^[11](#chapter03.xhtml#fn11){#chapter03.xhtml#ft11}^ While this may be valid to some extent, I believe it is important to acknowledge the possibility of a kind of participation that one may never be able to anticipate, as qualitatively different from what is instructed or exacted from participants, as external to the methodological framework. To attribute the inventive inputs of the participants solely to the genius of the workshop method would not do justice to the fact that it is not just the workshop participants who benefit from the method, but conversely also the repertoire of theatre practice itself and the mindsets of the facilitators, researchers and organizers, which are enriched by their contributions. Without this possibility of suspending the assumption of the benevolence of the theatre practice and the good impact it will necessarily have, participation in the arts will remain []{#chapter03.xhtml#pg_93}conceived as something offered to those who do not have its possibilities, as filling a gap, and therefore as something that justifies constant supervision, facilitation and intervention.

**Gesture as the other side of language**

So how then to make sense of the coexistence and intertwining of both formalized, scripted modes of participation and those volatile, unexpected practices that emerge from the minute cracks of particular situations? Their oscillating relationship can be conceptualized in different ways. It can be compared, for instance, to the difference between *langue* and *parole* in the structuralism of Saussure, with *langue* being the formal, diachronically accumulated grammar and vocabulary of a language, and *parole* being the informal, synchronic diversifications and variations of a language in its constant usage (Saussure, [1986](#bibliography.xhtml#ref66)). However, in this distinction, *parole* is generated from the *langue* and *langue* regularly adapts itself to *parole*, whereas in the case of the two dimensions of participation, I believe there is more tension and power dynamics in their relationship; they are not simply two sides of the same coin that complement each other. The gestures of unsolicited participation in the workshop seek to remain illegible to the established discursive procedures of participatory theatre, they resist formalization without necessarily opposing it, and can thus often not even be recognized as resistant.

It could also be compared to de Certeau's distinction between strategy and tactics, in the sense that tactics, like unsolicited gestures of participation, are makeshift by nature, they belong to the quotidian, they are very specific to the local and disperse and proliferate within technocratic structures (de Certeau, [1984](#bibliography.xhtml#ref65)). Yet for de Certeau, tactics are like rhetorical tropes, which manipulate the rules of grammar but are nevertheless themselves grounded in very clear rules. Also the fact that in participatory art we are dealing with physical, embodied moments and not text or speech alone makes it difficult to speak of a strategic participation and a tactical participation along the lines of a linguistic distinction. Possibly the opposition between grammar and slang is more applicable, as the colloquial quality of slang captures a range of registers, from body language, sounds and intonations, to []{#chapter03.xhtml#pg_94}regional nuances and differences between social classes, as opposed to the rule-dominated logic of grammar. The gestures of participation in the workshop can be regarded as both internal and external to the rules of spoken language; they supplement language and yet are indispensable to speech.

Another comparison is that between 'politics' and 'the political' as elaborated by Chantal Mouffe. In Mouffe's conception, 'politics refers to the ensemble of practices, discourses and institutions that seeks to establish a certain order and to organize coexistence in conditions which are always potentially conflicting. The political refers to the dimension of antagonism which can take many forms and can emerge in diverse social relations' (Mouffe, [2013](#bibliography.xhtml#ref136), pp. 2--3). I find this attractive because it acknowledges and gives place to conflicts and heterogeneous positions, yet its application to the arts is not straightforward, as aesthetic processes are not political in the same way as the political processes that Mouffe discusses.

Diana Taylor's notion of scenarios offers a further useful point of comparison in the discipline of theatre and performance studies. Scenarios are frameworks or broad outlines of practices, 'meaning-making paradigms that structure social environments, behaviours, and potential outcomes ... \[featuring\] milieux and corporeal behaviours such as gestures, attitudes, and tones not reducible to language' (Taylor, [2003](#bibliography.xhtml#ref182), p. 28). Scenarios thus importantly include more elements than text, narrative or plot, and reflect the diverse layers and systems at work in order for practices to enter or exit the repertoires and archives of cultural imaginings. In relation to the workshop I describe above, it is productive to view the uninvited interventions of the participants as parts of a scenario, at least as a minor scenario, although it is more difficult to identify them as meaning-making paradigms in the sense suggested by Taylor. The observation that a scenario cannot be reduced to language and consists of an entire range of embodied articulations is pertinent here.

In all these conceptions, the non-formal articulations maintain a tense and ambivalent relation to language; not language as in a particular spoken or written utterance or statement, but the very way in which language takes (its) place. They seem to be enabled by language, even as they hint at its inadequacy. 'Gesture is always []{#chapter03.xhtml#pg_95}the gesture of being at a loss in language,' remarked Agamben, 'it is always a "gag" in the literal sense of the word, which indicates first of all something put in someone's mouth to keep him from speaking and, then, the actor's improvisation to make up for an impossibility of speaking' ([1999](#bibliography.xhtml#ref3), p. 78). This remarkable interpretive association between the two meanings of 'gag' is worth some reflection. In his essay on Max Kommerell's literary criticism, Agamben departs from an understanding of gesture as an element that is closely tied to language even as it does not exhaust itself in the linguistic. Gesture is thus 'the other side of language' (Agamben, [1999](#bibliography.xhtml#ref3), p. 78), the hint within or at the edge of language at what is unspeakable. Agamben's witty remark around the 'gag' suggests that there is something put to silence behind the spontaneous, light-hearted improvisation of an actor on stage, namely 'the muteness inherent in humankind's very capacity for language, its speechless dwelling in language' ([1999](#bibliography.xhtml#ref3), p. 78). Or, read differently, it is the impossibility of language that produces gestures.

Could it thus be that, as far as the Karur workshop participants were concerned, the entire theatre of the oppressed programme and the political party set-up that brought it about belonged to the realm of top-down measures, of benevolent structural blocks, to the place that language takes? Gagged by these frames of participation, within which it is impossible for them to be truly heard or to articulate themselves, did they consciously or unwittingly resort to spontaneous improvisatory gags that unsettled or rearranged the rules of the game? Could it be that the more the demand for loud, visible acts of participation, the more it led to their scattered gestures of unsolicited participation?

In his study *Performance Affects: Applied Theatre and the End of Affect* ([2009](#bibliography.xhtml#ref189)) James Thompson argues, among other things, for the importance of silence not only as a narrative element and essential component of storytelling, but also as a form of participation, which does not easily translate into the coda of *effect* but nonetheless has a strong *affective* force ([2009](#bibliography.xhtml#ref189), pp. 56--77). Documenting his own experiences as a theatre facilitator in a camp for internally displaced persons in Sri Lanka, Thompson traces a fine web of interrelations and links between the involvement of external agencies in a seemingly local []{#chapter03.xhtml#pg_96}theatre project and the public ramifications and discourses of the war. He questions the assumption that theatre must be expected to give voice to people's experiences, or that telling stories is a necessary precondition for 'healing' or 'relief', common tropes in the arena of humanitarian aid. Thompson argues not only that such assumptions are blatantly insensitive to culturally specific modes of coping with painful experiences, but also that the insistence on telling stories and sharing the experience of war and displacement, even in the 'safe' space of the theatre, can even cause harm. Thompson's reflections on the possibility that contesting versions of a real event might result in a breach of trust between participants in a workshop, and his observations on the need to respect the desire to find cohesion and reconciliation rather than insisting on depicting all sides of a conflict, demonstrate the difficulties of embracing an agonistic or oppositional approach to participation, particularly in an already conflict-laden environment. In *Humanitarian Performance* ([2014](#bibliography.xhtml#ref190)) Thompson traces how narratives of suffering and saving form contentious political strategies in places of war, which often serve the agendas of humanitarian agencies rather than those who have suffered (Thompson, [2014](#bibliography.xhtml#ref190), p. 25).^[12](#chapter03.xhtml#fn12){#chapter03.xhtml#ft12}^ In the case of the theatre of the oppressed workshop that I attended, the affective force of participation lay not so much in the formal theatre exercises, but in the way in which the rules of the exercises were quietly altered. What I hope to suggest is that we need to think these two dimensions together in their plurality and ambivalence, the gestures of participation as the other side of the formal conditions of participation. The unexpected gestures of participation are attempts at reimagining and reformulating in aesthetic and theatrical terms the larger, sometimes deafening call for citizen participation. They are thus neither a rejection of nor a co-option into a pre-determined regime of participation, but an embodied engagement with it.

**Invitations to in-between places**

The idea for the performance project *Where We Are Not* ([2009](#bibliography.xhtml#ref105)) by the Amsterdam-based Lebanese artist Lina Issa emerged out of the artist's own legal situation at the time. Issa's application for an extension of her Dutch residence permit had been rejected, and she was awaiting the outcome of her appeal. She thus found herself in a situation where it was difficult to leave the Netherlands, for if she did so, she might have been refused re-entry. These circumstances created a peculiar situation where she was not yet fully legalized in her place of residence and simultaneously was unable to travel to her home country without potentially negatively affecting her chances of legalization. As an artistic response to this predicament, she collaborated with the performance artist, choreographer and dancer Aitana Cordero, who travelled to the Lebanon for ten days in [2008](#bibliography.xhtml#ref107) as Issa's stand-in, messenger and recording device. Prior to this, Cordero had conducted an artistic research project in 2005 entitled *Do You Want to Use Me?*, in which she invited artists to use her body as material for their own solos.^[1](#chapter04.xhtml#fn1){#chapter04.xhtml#ft1}^ Issa's invitation to be replaced by someone on a journey home thus fitted well with Cordero's invitation to make her body available to another artistic imagination.

Cordero stayed with Issa's parents and visited different people and places, in an attempt to trace what constituted the idea of 'homecoming' for Issa. She performed several tasks that Issa assigned to her, all []{#chapter04.xhtml#pg_100}relating to intimate and individual ways of inhabiting a place as one's home. These tasks were outlined in an elaborate diary that Issa gave to Cordero just before she boarded the flight to the Lebanon. They included instructions such as: 'Kiss my aunt as you cup her head with your hands and give her my greetings, say: "*Lina betsalem ậlay kteer*"', or 'Go with Nagham to the spot called "Balayet" where we used to play as kids, smell the soil there, take a look at the texture of the rocks, the people, the houses. \[...\] Find a moment to give the lemon, salt and knife to Nagham and ask her to peel it.' Cordero herself also kept a diary of her visit to the Lebanon in her mother tongue, Spanish, noting her own experiences as a stand-in, including notes on how the tasks assigned to her were carried out, but also the frustrations and misunderstandings that arose from the performative experiment, from being a receptor on behalf of someone else, from the poetic attempt to embody another person's desires and expectations, from the inability to transmit a sense of homecoming, or from inhabiting the transformations that a body experiences in migration.

The results and experiences of this experiment of taking someone else's place were shared by Cordero and Issa in the form of a staged performance/reading entitled *Where We Are Not*, which I attended in [2009](#bibliography.xhtml#ref105) at de Brakke Grond, an experimental arts centre in Amsterdam. During this event, which was restricted to a maximum of six audience members at a time, visitors were first asked to wait in a room, which was bare but for a few chairs and a video screen showing the heads of two women next to each other, lying on a rooftop, with the sound and image of wind blowing in their hair and faces. The only instruction given to participants was to select four people from the group to go to the next room at the point when everyone instinctively felt that eight minutes were over. This time passed awkwardly, not unlike in a waiting room in a railway station or airport or immigration office, with time being allocated in a seemingly exact manner, but the perceived waiting period inevitably feeling extremely long and heavy. Those who stayed behind obviously waited even longer until they were called to the next room. The second room had a table with Issa's handwritten diary lying on it, which participants were invited to read through at leisure, together or individually. It served as the first direct source of information about the journey: a book with personal impressions []{#chapter04.xhtml#pg_101}about her family members and places of emotional attachment and personal history, as well as elaborate day-by-day instructions and general profiles of the country, the language and the food, a personalized *Lonely Planet* travel guide of sorts. It later transpired that one of the audience members was in fact a stand-in, who discreetly offered bits and pieces of contextual and background information to the others. One by one, visitors were then personally welcomed by Issa and Cordero to join them at a table in the third room. The visitor was asked to select one page from the diary of Cordero's visit to the Lebanon placed on the table. Cordero then read out in Spanish what was written on this page and subsequently translated her own text into English. In my case, the page I chose pertained to a particular day on which she was meant to visit a friend of Issa and take a walk with him. The diary notes commented on the difficulties and challenges encountered by Cordero in executing this task, as well as a number of personal impressions and thoughts. In the course of the conversation, which was the first time that Issa and Cordero had spoken to each other after the substitute journey about this incident, the tensions inherent to the concept of this performance artwork became apparent. For the artist Lina Issa, *Where We Are Not* 'is not about anywhere, but about those places we carry with us in our bodies' (Issa, [2009](#bibliography.xhtml#ref105)). Indeed, one might conclude that it is about the way that places only ever exist in the way we carry them in our bodies and memories.

In the follow-up project entitled *If I Could Take Your Place*, initiated in [2010](#bibliography.xhtml#ref106) within the framework of an artist residency in Sweden, Issa reversed the idea of the 'stand-in'. Here she placed an advertisement in newspapers in Sweden and the Netherlands, offering to replace people in specific situations for a given period of time:

Did you ever want to be in two places at the same time? Did you ever have a desire or need that 'someone else' -- takes your place in a certain situation? -- does or says something, that you never dared to say or do yourself? -- visits something from your past or future, bringing a memory or a message? -- goes in your place to work, or fulfils your daily rituals in your place? Can I take your place? For an hour, a day, or a week ... (Issa, [2010](#bibliography.xhtml#ref106))

She received 33 responses and eventually 'replaced' nine people.^[2](#chapter04.xhtml#fn2){#chapter04.xhtml#ft2}^ The occasions for the temporary substitutions varied in terms of the []{#chapter04.xhtml#pg_102}nature of the activity, but all the requests had a strongly affective dimension: one person asked Issa to take over her personal sadness and suffering for one weekend, so she could go away on a trip. Another person, himself a photographer, requested that she replace him for a day in his job of collecting garbage near a highway, and take pictures of the trash, since he wanted to see how someone else would view the same objects he dealt with on a daily basis. Other requests included meeting with a sorely missed friend, or having dinner with a former husband. These are occasions on which a person's physical presence is commonly regarded as indispensable, on which one cannot be substituted by anyone else. Possibly, the poetic audacity of the idea evoked in the advertisement could only beckon equally audacious counter-requests. In both projects, the artist creates an overlap between the artistic sphere and the sphere of social life through the figuration of the stand-in. In *Where We Are Not*, it is the life of the artist into which another artist figuratively and physically steps, whereas in *If I Could Take Your Place* it is the artist who steps into other people's lives and homes.

**The theatricality of participation**

Issa's 'replacement' projects might seem somewhat odd and unlikely choices for a discussion about participatory art. In the public presentation of *Where We Are Not*, the thrust of the performance installation was neither on activating spectators and transforming them into performers, nor was it devised as an immersive experience. Audience participation consists at the simplest level in being or becoming aware that one is invited to be a witness to or a part of a conversation and an intimately shared experience between Issa and Cordero. The conversation takes on a quality of heightened perceptibility, a theatricality that is inherent to any situation of encounter between the seer and the seen. I use the concept of theatricality here in the sense of Elizabeth Burns to refer to certain historically and culturally determined 'modes of perception' common to both theatre as well as social life, where the condition of being aware of being a spectator creates a theatrical frame (Balme, [2001](#bibliography.xhtml#ref13); Burns, [1972](#bibliography.xhtml#ref39), p. 13). Tracy Davis argues that the condition for theatricality as an artistic and []{#chapter04.xhtml#pg_103}social phenomenon is the audience's awareness and consciousness of being spectators. To take a walk and casually notice an animal grazing in a field does not create a theatrical situation, but to buy a ticket for a circus performance and watch the same animal on stage applauded by the circus audience creates theatricality by way of the heightened perceptibility of the situation through the self-awareness of being spectators (Davis, [2003](#bibliography.xhtml#ref64), pp. 129--30). This theatricality is potentially applicable to any act or event, both within and outside the artistic realm, where there is a self-aware presence of spectatorship. By being aware of taking on the position of spectator, the act or scene viewed is marked as perceptible. Participation here is not about activating spectatorship, which would in a sense imply that spectatorship is in itself passive and thereby in need of alteration, a critique prominently raised by Jacques Rancière ([2009](#bibliography.xhtml#ref105)). Rather, it is about a joint effort at making things worth paying attention to, in a way that foregrounds this effort as a central concern.

In the realm of the performance itself, different people jointly contribute to this work of spectatorship. Cordero does not employ a realistic approach to the task of feeling someone else's sense of home. Rather, she assumes her position as a spectator of someone who is not there, and attempts to embody this presence next to an absence. She recounts being taken by Issa's father on an early morning beach walk and feeling uncomfortable when he started singing a song, realizing that it was addressed not to her but to Issa (Issa and Cordero, [2008](#bibliography.xhtml#ref107)). At the same time she takes the idea of replacing Issa and following her instructions as literally as possible. She eats whatever she is offered by her hosts or asked by Issa to eat, even if it is much more than she would want to eat herself. She does not contact any of her own friends or family during the time she is there. In her diary she records her visceral and emotional responses to various situations and tasks she is asked to perform: a sense of awkwardness in conversations, loneliness, or a gut feeling of familiarity and shared circumstance. Issa's friends and family constitute another type of spectatorship, as they too are made aware of their own perceptions of the relationship to her, enhanced or irritated by Cordero's presence. Visitors to the performance/reading *Where We Are Not* perform another type of spectatorship, at times trying, through the diaries, to []{#chapter04.xhtml#pg_104}piece together what actually took place in the Lebanon, at other times asking questions that led to a conversation between everyone present.

Language plays a prominent role in heightening the sense of being a spectator. Not understanding what is being said or implied is a recurring experience for Cordero, a consistent reminder that she is not at home and is attempting to take someone's place. It points to the very way in which our notion of home has so much to do with the way in which we relate to language as our own or as foreign. The fact that English is a foreign language not only for herself but also for Issa's family creates a situation whereby language necessarily stands in the way of participating in someone else's sense of home, even as English makes basic communication possible. The use of English also offers a reassuring common ground -- at least everyone is attempting to step out of their own language to make the other feel at home. It also suggests a comforting, though entirely illusory hope that a shared mother tongue might possibly imply a shared sense of home. Writing a diary in Spanish becomes a way of returning home, releasing herself from the awkwardness of English and the fragments of Arabic that she might have learnt to grasp. For Issa too, the invitation to Cordero was extended in English, which is not her first language. Yet her diary notes and instructions to Cordero contain repeated references to Arabic words and their pronunciation. These serve more than the purpose of easing communication, in the manner that a travel guide might include simple phrases in the language of the place being visited. Rather they point to the centrality of language, not in conveying meaning, but as an affective register of home. To learn a new language or to take the trouble to speak and falter in a second or third language are ways of de-familiarizing one's sense of home, of undoing a stable sense of how language is owned and made into one's home.

In terms of its broader political implications, theatrical spectatorship as a mode of witnessing is what makes it possible for Issa's state of semi-legality to become visible, and for empathetic connections to be formed. It makes it possible to imagine being in a similar position, and also to imagine others in far more precarious situations. Here, instead of positing spectatorship as a passive position assumed by the audience, theatricality suggests that the participation of art []{#chapter04.xhtml#pg_105}in the public sphere has the capacity to make people realize that a seemingly simple act of witnessing, when consciously undertaken, can potentially help to generate public reflection and action on issues that may otherwise remain hidden. Cordero notes that in conveying a message to Issa's parents, she could become an observer of their pain in missing their daughter, who had migrated to Europe, and also witness the pain of being a daughter who misses her parents. Her body is both a conduit and a catalyst for a gush of emotions, memories and interactions (Covington-Ward, [2016](#bibliography.xhtml#ref60)).

Issa's projects bear similarities to the work of the Palestinian-American conceptual artist Emily Jacir, specifically the project *Where We Come From* (2001--03), in which she asked 30 Palestinians living in different places, 'If I could do anything for you, anywhere in Palestine, what would it be?', and then carried out their wishes by proxy, documenting the process (Jacir, [2003](#bibliography.xhtml#ref108)).^[3](#chapter04.xhtml#fn3){#chapter04.xhtml#ft3}^ The wishes ranged from sentimental and personal requests such as meeting long-lost relatives or drinking the water in an ancestral village, to simple, practical wishes, such as playing football with street children or paying a bill. Jacir's work highlighted the difficulties and restrictions in the mobility of Palestinians under occupation, difficulties that become apparent and visible precisely through the transposition of an unfulfilled wish on to a person with an American passport. As Edward Said eloquently remarks in a comment on Jacir's work, 'her compositions slip through the nets of bureaucracies and non-negotiable borders, time and space, in search not of grandiose dreams or clotted fantasies but rather of humdrum objects and simple gestures' ([2003](#bibliography.xhtml#ref108), p. 106). Similarly Issa's conceptually inspired replacements are deprived of utility and causality; they are not devised to serve the purpose of literal replacement, but rather they make it possible to pay attention more carefully to the predicament of one who is unable to go home, unable to pursue a desire for any number of reasons. Like Jacir's wish-fulfilments, Issa's acts of replacement too remain 'phantasmatic, vicarious, ghostly' (Demos, [2013](#bibliography.xhtml#ref68), p. 103). Whereas Jacir uses the art gallery to show her work, Issa deploys the live, interactive component of performance in the public presentations, while also including video installations, radio shows and visual objects such as the diaries as a part of the presentation.

[]{#chapter04.xhtml#pg_106}In *If I Could Take Your Place* the respondents are asked to participate by withdrawing from the scene in order to witness someone else enter and occupy their roles. Spectators are entirely absent; we only receive second-hand accounts through the narrations of Issa and a few of her collaborators, and given that it is work in progress, possible future formats of involving audiences might still evolve. Our access to these moments as spectators is indirect and heavily mediated through Issa's own narrative and framing. This implies that there is no primary audience for the artwork, and indeed the categories of performer, spectator or artwork are called into question, for is it not the artist who becomes the spectator of someone's life for a short period of time? It is impossible to find empirical evidence of how someone was replaced, or to measure its efficacy. In contrast to *Where We Are Not*, where the stand-in Cordero was explicitly asked not to take photographs, Issa prominently uses visual images as a means of giving form and visibility to her own process of being a stand-in in *If I Could Take Your Place.* An image of a living room sofa or a dining table set for two, pictures of garbage or of the key to a house -- these objects stand in for the relations people have to them. During a public presentation in Sweden in [2010](#bibliography.xhtml#ref106), some of the people who asked Issa to replace them spoke about what they did during this period, as well as about their motivation in responding to the advertisement (Issa, [2010](#bibliography.xhtml#ref106)). The collaborators themselves can be partly regarded as audiences; they alter their mode of perception of their own lives and attempt, albeit hypothetically and imaginatively, to step out of their own shoes by asking someone else to step into them for a moment. One of them shared her experience of saying goodbye for a weekend to Issa, handing over her mobile phone, computer passwords and keys and getting into a train.

**The sociality of self-making**

Issa's own account of taking someone's place has a confessional, personal, sentimental tone. She speaks of sitting on someone's couch and crying, feeling the sorrow they have asked her to feel, or feeling anxious about meeting someone to convey a personal message to them. Despite the overlaps between the artistic and the social realms []{#chapter04.xhtml#pg_107}in both projects, the discursive and physical gesture of standing in for someone else does not actually result in enacting or becoming that which it names, even temporarily. It is the artistic framing that makes it possible to imagine such a replacement. The gesture of offering to take someone's place is one of extending the scope of imagining how we are made. At the same time, to be moved by and towards the other, to attempt to share or expose oneself to others' wounds and sufferings, can profoundly alter one's own sense of being a stably determined, self-driven individual. Cordero views her participation in the project *Where We Are Not* in terms of a generosity to put aside her own wishes or inclinations, to be vulnerable and expose herself to whatever the situation brings, to be willing to submit to the instructions of another person and dispossess herself of her own visibility.^[4](#chapter04.xhtml#fn4){#chapter04.xhtml#ft4}^ Judith Butler and Athena Athanasiou reflect on this performative aspect of dispossession when they distinguish between its two valences: dispossession in a negative sense as a state of being stripped of rights, land and entitlements, and dispossession in a positive, performative sense as the capacity to show solidarity with the less privileged, including those one does not know or never could know (Butler and Athanasiou, [2013](#bibliography.xhtml#ref45), p. 3). What is important in the distinction is the search for ways of positively connoting dispossession without necessarily relating it to possession, identitarianism or ownership.

The playful idea of standing in for others evokes such larger questions of what it means to participate in collective processes of imagining and transforming selfhood. In listening to the account of how Issa slept in someone else's bed or performed an intimate ritual of familiarity on someone else's behalf, or of how Cordero visited the village where Issa was born together with her father, one is invited to reflect on how ideas of selfhood are both socially imagined as well as emergent from the struggle against social norms and regimes (Butler and Athanasiou, [2013](#bibliography.xhtml#ref45), p. 67). At the same time, the point of the artistic effort at vicarious participation is not to unveil some hidden core or arrive at an ultimate self-truth; as Butler argues, 'it is not to say that we do not require recognition; rather it is to say that recognition is always partial, and that our capacity to practice freedom critically depends on that very partiality' ([2013](#bibliography.xhtml#ref45), p. 68). In asking someone else to take her place, and offering to take others' places herself, Issa []{#chapter04.xhtml#pg_108}approaches participation in multi-directional way, where the self is dispossessed of its fixity as it seeks to enter other lives and realities in their very difference. A sense of distancing and detaching oneself from one's seemingly self-assured fantasies of the self becomes a necessary pre-condition for reaching out to and building a relation with another, a relation that is always precarious and partial. The solidarity in the gesture of vicarious participation lies not so much in recognizing and finding the so-called 'other' or in respecting and celebrating differences, but rather in being prepared and willing to deconstruct the fixity of one's ideas of oneself, a gesture that can be either potentially transformative or disorienting, depending on who is expected to perform this gesture and to what end.

The replacement projects place those involved in a peculiar relationship to time and space. In being required to dwell in a certain place with all the senses, to smell, touch and feel the things and people that remind Issa of her own subjective sense of home, Cordero is asked to approach this home without any self-assurance, in fact to imagine what it might mean to be uprooted from the specificity of site. She is asked to visit Issa's home, but to visit it as a home from which Issa is palpably absent, and thus to imagine what Issa feels in not being able to visit home herself, to observe that absence, to give it more priority than her own presence. In the act of travelling together with Issa's mother in a car, watching her drive and explain the lyrics of a favourite shared song, Cordero is invited to experience the moment in a way that brings past, present and future together all at once -- someone else's past, her own present, and an unclaimed anticipated future.

**Artistic gestures and social gestures**

I have thus far referred to the aesthetic principle of participation in Issa's projects in terms of offering a gesture of participation, rather than enacting or fulfilling the call for participation. The idea of selfhood, something seemingly natural and organically connected to oneself, is interrupted and made strange, it is broken down into distinct moments and gestures, each artificial or incomplete on its own, but together creating a scenario that lends itself to reflection and critically []{#chapter04.xhtml#pg_109}intimate appraisal. This has strong resonances with the Brechtian concept of *Gestus*, which has served as a rich resource in theatrical experimentation, obviously extending beyond the scope of participatory theatre and performance alone.^[5](#chapter04.xhtml#fn5){#chapter04.xhtml#ft5}^

Brecht's concept of *Gestus* differs in two important ways from what is commonly implied in the English term 'gesture'. First, whereas 'gesture' is widely used with reference to the outward expression or bearing of an inner feeling or attitude, Brechtian *Gestus* refers not to 'the fulfilment or realisation of an intention or of an expectation but rather its disruption and suspension. It entails not so much expression as interruption. And it is this that makes it eminently theatrical' (Weber, [2008](#bibliography.xhtml#ref198), p. 98). *Gestus* calls situations into being, brings their smooth movement to a halt, as it were, making a situation perceptible in its details and its contradictions by interrupting any assumed direct link between inner feeling and outer expression. It is thus an essential means of achieving the effect of de-familiarization, which Brecht theorized in his *Short Organum for the Theatre* (1949) as necessary in order to cultivate a critical and politically constructive spectatorship. *Gestus* is the purposive arresting of movement, and thus of self-identification with movement, a technique that seeks to lay bare inconsistencies at various levels: 'the coherence of the character \[*die Einheit der Figur*\] is in fact shown by the way in which its individual qualities contradict one another' (Brecht, [1964](#bibliography.xhtml#ref32), p. 196 no. 53).

While it is not uncommon to make use of a stand-in or replacement in certain sports or in the theatre, the interruption or de-familiarization in Issa's works is derived from the replacement taking place in the quotidian realm, outside of the conventional spaces of art, and most importantly, with no role-playing involved, while simultaneously being framed as an art project. Issa does not try to act like the person she is replacing, nor does Cordero claim to behave or feel like Issa. Instead the projects explore the Brechtian adage of bodily *Gestus* preceding feelings, ideas and thoughts. In his essays on amateur theatre, Brecht remarks, 'kneel down and you will begin to pray', or 'crying is caused by sadness, but sadness is also caused by crying', implying that it is possible to evoke certain psychological states and forms of self-identification by performing the gestures and actions that accompany them (cit. in Esslin, [1986](#bibliography.xhtml#ref72), p. 30). However, whereas []{#chapter04.xhtml#pg_110}Brechtian actor training revolves around exploring the relation of the actor or actress to the character and figure through the critically observant incorporation of the character's gestures and movements, Issa's participatory work deals with exploring how one person's feelings and relations to places and other people can be transmitted to another person by adopting the gestures and actions that accompany their feelings in a non-artistically framed situation, and observing this very process in the presence of spectators.

Second, *Gestus* specifically interconnects the embodied, somatic dimension with the social and historical dimension of a physical gesture.

The realm of attitudes \[*Haltungen*\] adopted by the characters towards one another is what we call the realm of gest \[*den gestischen Bereich*\]. Physical attitude, tone of voice and facial expression are all determined by a social gest \[*Gestus*\] \[...\] The attitudes \[*Haltungen*\] which people adopt towards one another include even those attitudes \[*Äußerungen*\] which would appear to be quite private, such as the utterance of physical pain in an illness, or of religious faith. These expressions of a gest \[*diese gestischen Äußerungen*\] are usually highly complicated and contradictory, so that they cannot be rendered by any single word and the actor must take care that in giving his image \[*Abbildung*\] the necessary emphasis he does not lose anything, but emphasizes the entire complex. (Brecht, [1964](#bibliography.xhtml#ref32))

The relation between *Haltung* and *Gestus* is significant here. In John Willett's translation of the *Short Organum for the Theatre*, the term 'attitude' is used both for *Haltung* as well as *Äußerung.* While 'attitude' reflects the way one faces or perceives something, it does not capture the physicality of *Haltung*, literally, 'bearing', nor the sense of 'articulation' or 'expression' in the term *Äußerung*. Brecht uses both the Latin form *Gestus* as well as the German term *Haltung*, which can both be translated in some contexts as 'gesture'. However, *Gestus* is both a manner of 'bearing' as well as of 'articulation'; it is the material from which seemingly individual utterances and expressions emerge. Brecht speaks of 'gestural material', which appears to be but never is fully private. This gestural realm shapes how individual figures bear themselves towards one another, in the old-fashioned sense of 'bearing' as both carrying and moving. In another often-cited example, Brecht comments that the gesture of 'warding off a fly is in itself not []{#chapter04.xhtml#pg_111}yet a social *Gestus*; warding off a dog can be one if it expresses the struggle of a poorly clad person against watchdogs' ([1967](#bibliography.xhtml#ref33), p. 609). *Gestus* thus combines physical, formal elements with social and political implications and configurations. Every singular theatrical event, Brecht continues, has a founding *Gestus*, the so-called *Grundgestus*: a moment, an arrested movement, that captures the gravity of an entire scene or social situation: 'Richard Gloster courts his victim's widow. The child's true mother is found by means of a chalk circle. God has a bet with the devil for Dr. Faust's soul' (Brecht, [1964](#bibliography.xhtml#ref32)). These physical gestures are never only individual expressions, they are always also the performative montage of a social habitude, of the inequalities and the violence inherent to them.

Walter Benjamin famously explained Brecht's concept of *Gestus* with reference to what he terms a family scene:

Epic theatre, then, does not reproduce conditions but rather, reveals them. This uncovering of conditions is brought about through processes being interrupted. A very crude example: a family row. The mother is just about to pick up a pillow to hurl at the daughter, the father is opening a window to call a policeman. At this moment a stranger appears at the door. \[...\] In other words, the stranger is suddenly confronted with certain conditions. \[...\] The more far-reaching the devastations of our social order (the more these devastations undermine ourselves and our capacity to remain aware of them), the more marked must be the distance between the stranger and the events portrayed. (Benjamin, [1973b](#bibliography.xhtml#ref22), p. 5)

For Benjamin, Brecht's epic theatre was radical in its use of the *Gestus* to both interrupt as well as dynamize and enrapture such moments. The interruption of action leaves the viewer or reader wondering as to what could happen next, and what happened earlier, what led to this moment, what is the larger condition it evokes. It is less the image and story evoked by the gesture than the moment of suspension and suggestiveness that intrigued Benjamin most. He understood the *Gestus* as rendering the possibility of understanding through 'rapture', a deep recognition of the history and larger purport of an event (Butler, [2014b](#bibliography.xhtml#ref44)).

In the course of researching Issa's replacement projects, I was repeatedly reminded of this scene from Benjamin's essay on Brecht. A stranger appears, a scene comes to a halt mid-way, a gesture is []{#chapter04.xhtml#pg_112}brought into being. The mother in Benjamin's *tableau vivant*, preparing to hurl a pillow at her daughter, is suddenly confronted by a stranger. In *Where We Are Not*, it is a stranger who bears herself as that daughter. If the stranger takes the place of the daughter, do we as spectators, listening to an account of that *Gestus*, then, hypothetically, become Benjamin's stranger? Does she become the stranger who perhaps brought a different scene to a halt? How do we participate in such a scene, witnessing someone hurl a pillow (in a later essay by Benjamin, the pillow is replaced by a bronze bust) at someone else? How do we adequately, appropriately bear ourselves (*Haltung*), articulate ourselves (*Äußerung*) faced with the prospect of possible violence? There is a specific kind of temporality to this gesture -- a stranger appears, something comes to a halt -- it compels us to think about what could have been, what will have occurred. What matters is not so much what actually took place, but what the interruption made it possible to imagine.

I do not wish to suggest that the performance projects *Where We Are Not* and *If I Could Take Your Place* are Brechtian; however, I propose that a Brechtian-influenced understanding of gesture as a physical movement that is simultaneously a social attitude is a useful category for understanding and thinking the participatory aspects of these works. To ask someone to take your place or to request to take their place is an imaginative question that is merely literalized by the gesture of replacement and casting. It is an invitation to think of the performer as well as the one being replaced, each in their historical, gendered specificity, and to ask what it means to adopt this specificity in an embodied way. To offer to replace someone is at best a gesture of participating in someone else's sense of home and self: it suggests the possibility but of course does not achieve or fulfil it. It is effective as a gesture precisely because it dwells in that twilight zone between speech, image and act; it belongs neither to the realm of authenticity nor to the realm of artificiality, it is both beyond linguistic expression as well as inseparable from it (Kolesch, [2010](#bibliography.xhtml#ref119), p. 228). The work of being a stand-in is different from role-play and different from voyeurism. It is a gesture, a hint at sharing an experience, pointing towards what must remain external to the gesture. Participation in such a performance thus does not consist in immersing oneself in []{#chapter04.xhtml#pg_113}the subjectivity of another person or situation, but in being repeatedly reminded of the situatedness of one's own subjectivity. These gestures don't flow into each other to create one unifying experience, but rather consist of a series of interruptions of that experience. So there is the pretence of stepping into someone else's position, by receiving the key to their apartment and the password to their email account -- mere gesture. There is the suggestion of transmitting an experience that cannot be narrated but must be embodied, and yet this experience is mediated to the audience as narration or as record. It is presented to the public using familiar formats of storytelling.

Issa's projects can be seen as gestural, physical and visceral in undertaking specific actions, yet evocative and suggestive in what these actions might mean. They envisage the participation of audiences and artists as constantly moving between the physical and the imaginative, the kinaesthetic and the symbolic, the instrumental and the signifying registers, in the way that the bodily gesture also constantly moves between these registers. The activities undertaken by Issa and Cordero in the gesture of replacing someone enable them in a peculiar way to access and revise routines, or, as Carrie Noland convincingly points out in her study of agency and embodiment, 'to sense the discrepancy between what gestures *mean* (the meaning bestowed by cultural convention on theme and therefore on the subjects performing them) and what gestures makes us *feel* (the sensations we experience while performing them)' ([2009](#bibliography.xhtml#ref105), p. 212). The gap between the cultural meaning of a gesture and the way gestures are sensed and experienced is widened when the experience is narrated or represented in a different format to an audience that was excluded or absent from the moment, always producing more and other than it intends in the process. This discrepancy or widened gap between physical movement and meaning implies that gestures performatively 'bring a body into being', just as bodies potentially bring new, different gestures into being (Noland, [2009](#bibliography.xhtml#ref141), p. 212). The word 'potentially' needs to be emphasized here, for it would be fallacious to hastily conclude that the participatory gesture is a radical performative per se. Its fragility and contingency make it extraordinarily difficult to translate and put to use as a political concept. Both *If I Could Take Your Place* and *Where We Are Not* allegorize displacement and []{#chapter04.xhtml#pg_114}consider its political implications: the privilege of mobility in some cases juxtaposed with the quandaries of forced migration in others, or the freedom, however hypothetical, to step outside of one's own skin and predicament, as opposed to the freedom to hide or reveal what one deems as one's own.

**An audience that sleeps?**

Going off to sleep during a performance is usually regarded as a sign of boredom, lack of attentiveness and lack of interest on the part of spectators. The sight (or sound!) of audience members falling asleep might be perceived as an indication of the performance's failure to engage, entertain or enthuse and thus a failure to fulfil what are widely considered to be the basic functions of the artist. The status and respect accorded to an attentive, alert and perceptive spectator is widespread in theatre and performance theory, even if the forms and expressions of this perceptiveness have been differently conceived in various historical moments and in diverse cultural paradigms. Since falling asleep, with its attendant gestures of yawning, dropping off, stretching out tired limbs or snoring, is a physiological phenomenon, it is rarely openly condemned or looked down upon when it happens within the frameworks or spaces of performance, for it is regarded as an uncontrollable and accidental 'natural' response, at best tolerated as an expression of a person's fatigue or exhaustion (Reiss, [2014](#bibliography.xhtml#ref163)). In most theatre and performance theory, a spectator who sleeps is an absent spectator, and certainly a non-participant spectator.

In the urban intervention *Nomad City Passage*, conceived by the visual artists Rebekka Reich and Oliver Gather, and performed in Düsseldorf, Linz and Cologne between 2005 and 2009, this premise is inverted. Participants were invited to spend a night camping at []{#chapter05.xhtml#pg_116}various everyday or representative urban locations, in public squares, in skyscrapers, in shopping malls and in school rooms. Upon arrival, they checked in by filling in a form, in which they were asked three questions about their relationship to the particular site.^[1](#chapter05.xhtml#fn1){#chapter05.xhtml#ft1}^ They were then provided with a tent, an air mattress, towels and a torch. Audience participation consists of the deceptively simple act of around twenty people pitching tents on the site, spending the night there and leaving the next morning after sharing breakfast together. The artists as well as the proprietors or caretakers of the site also joined the campers. The latter were invited to introduce the site to visitors in terms of its history, its infrastructure, its function and to share their personal experiences of inhabiting or working in that particular space. There was no other artistic or entertainment programme on offer, and visitors were free to discover and explore the spaces and interact with each other in whatever way and to whatever extent that they chose.

Social interaction between participants and the site is integral to the project. The encounter and interaction take place in a specific kind of urban space, highly determined in its daily usage, but rendered with a different potential of sociality when approached through the act of spending a night on a camp site as part of an art project. The spaces can also be seen as participants, interacting with the human visitors.^[2](#chapter05.xhtml#fn2){#chapter05.xhtml#ft2}^ In the video documentation of the project, Oliver Gather comments on this deliberate reduction of authorial design and foregrounding of the site, by arguing that the appropriation of the spaces by the participants can only take place when there is a minimized steering of the experience as event (Reich and Richter, [2011](#bibliography.xhtml#ref162)). Some participants experienced this minimal dramaturgy as an adventure, since it was not clear what might happen.^[3](#chapter05.xhtml#fn3){#chapter05.xhtml#ft3}^ Others, such as the following participant who camped on a golf course in Düsseldorf with his 10-year-old son and friends, remarked on being initially disappointed with its strong resemblance to a 'regular' camping experience:

Lying in the tent at night I thought to myself: was I disappointed by the ordinariness of the site? Was it me who did not recognize what was special about the situation? ... I wondered whether the shopping mall might have been a more interesting choice. ... In hindsight though, I see it differently. That one night has very gradually changed my sense of perception of places. I have since passed by many places and wondered []{#chapter05.xhtml#pg_117}what it might be like to spend a night here. I now tend to speculate more about the possibilities of a site and question its given definition.^[4](#chapter05.xhtml#fn4){#chapter05.xhtml#ft4}^

The project was launched in Düsseldorf, Germany, in 2005, with a follow-up in 2009 in Linz, Austria, and Cologne, Germany. In Düsseldorf, it was the prestige-laden image of the city centre as a prosperous, post-industrial hub of museums, media houses, expensive shopping streets, tennis and golf clubs that informed the choice of camping sites. In Cologne, the camping sites were located on the top floors of six prominent skyscrapers in the city, with the city skyline being the space that informed the choice of sites.^[5](#chapter05.xhtml#fn5){#chapter05.xhtml#ft5}^ In Linz, the project was conducted within the framework of the Austrian Festival of Regions, with the theme in 2009 being 'Normality' ('Normalzustand'). The camping sites were chosen from various locations on the city's periphery, with a focus on their 'normality' or ubiquity: an indoor rock climbing gym, a hardware supermarket, a hydroelectric power station, a shooting range, a school building and the lawns of a housing complex. Similar to most site-specific performance work, the sites in *Nomad City Passage* did not simply form backdrops or podiums for human interaction but were approached as active participants in their own way. Since they were not empty or directly public spaces, permission had to be sought from their regular occupants to temporarily inhabit the spaces in a manner that was alien to their day-to-day usage, and the ideas and responses of the proprietors played a role in the way the spaces were thrown open to the public. The artists attest to the difficulty of gaining permission and access to the spaces, with the preparatory work often involving long and tedious communications and bureaucratic procedures.^[6](#chapter05.xhtml#fn6){#chapter05.xhtml#ft6}^

**Participatory urban interventions in a project-based art world**

The fact that *Nomad City Passage* can be located across the domains of performance, scenography, urban design and installation art is evidenced by its funding sources, including the Municipal Urban Planning Department, a forum on contemporary architecture as well as various arts funding agencies and arts festivals. Participation is a central concept to *Nomad City Passage*, which explores lived []{#chapter05.xhtml#pg_118}experiences of urban spaces, asking how the sites of a city are experienced by its inhabitants, and how they relate to it in direct, palpable ways. It approaches city planning not as a given, static fact but through what the artists call 'the occupation of carefully chosen sites using the archaic principle of encampment' (Reich and Gather, [2005](#bibliography.xhtml#ref160), p. 2). In this sense, it can be called an immersive participatory artwork, in the way that it seeks to prepare the conditions for enabling the participants' own version of the space and leaves open the question of how the invitation is taken up by them. Yet precisely because of its minimal framework, it is difficult to place *Nomad City Passage* in terms of genre. It is not a performance, an installation or a workshop, and in the artists' view it belongs more to the domain of the visual arts than to the performing arts. The term 'urban intervention' seems appropriate from a performance studies perspective, since the focus is on a scenographic encounter with urban architecture and public spaces. The spatial dimension is approached not in geometric or geographical but in social, interstitial terms.^[7](#chapter05.xhtml#fn7){#chapter05.xhtml#ft7}^ This term conjures a history that has influenced both the trajectory of theatre and performance as well as that of the visual arts in a European and North American context in the twentieth century: from the *d*é*rives* of the Situationists in France in the 1920s, to the Fluxus movement and happenings and land art in the USA in the 1960s and 1970s, to the urban experiments of the 'independents' in Brazil in the 1970s and 1980s.

The documentation of *Nomad City Passage* uses the word 'project', which is not insignificant given the political economy underpinnings of this term in contemporary art. A 'project' may take any format, and can also be located outside of traditional genre boundaries, and this is most likely the intended usage of the term. However, the idea of the project as the unit of artistic activity came to prominence via the increasing influence of management discourses in the 1990s, similar to terms like 'network', and has come to stand for what Luc Boltanski and Eve Chiapello have famously called 'the new spirit of capitalism'. In their eponymously titled book, Boltanski and Chiapello argue through their critical appraisal of management books of the 1990s that the 'project' has become representative of the typical format of economic activity in Western societies: an activity of limited duration and with a high level of intensity, which serves as an occasion and []{#chapter05.xhtml#pg_119}a reason for connections between people in a network and requires a process in which several persons or institutions collaborate on a short-term basis (Boltanski and Chiapello, [1999](#bibliography.xhtml#ref28), pp. 104--105). They observe that as traditional jobs are on the decline, people become increasingly involved in a wide range of self-managed activities in the form of projects, all of which depend on and in turn generate encounters, leading to more activities. The project serves as a catalyst for people's involvement and active, enthusiastic participation, despite or precisely because it only lasts for a short period of time (Boltanski and Chiapello, [1999](#bibliography.xhtml#ref28), p. 110). They diagnose the phenomenon of the project as a term pertinent not only to activities within managerial capitalism, but also to those activities that are explicitly critical of the project's precariousness and its dynamics within neoliberal capitalism, thus claiming that its transience and flexibility and ability to absorb criticism make it into one of the pillars of the 'projective city' (Boltanski and Chiapello, [1999](#bibliography.xhtml#ref28), p. 111).

Boltanski and Chiapello's analysis of the cultural and political economy of the project and network further stresses its feature of 'being called on to participate' ([1999](#bibliography.xhtml#ref28), p. 126) and its requirement of participants to be constantly active and interactive, dissolving personal and professional life. The growing prominence of the project in critical, artistic contexts is therefore analysed as inseparable from this broader paradigm shift of the work ethic. At the same time, the growing popularity of the 'project' concept in the 1990s did not emerge from a vacuum, but can be traced back to early Romanticism in European art history and to the philosophical critique of the artwork as being unable to adequately depict or represent infinite reality. By referring to *Nomad City Passage* as a project, the artists thus ally it conceptually to the notion of a work of art as always necessarily fragmentary, work in progress, never comprehensive or all-encompassing.

**'The fall of sleep'**

*Nomad City Passage* is no doubt motivated by a critical view towards the spatial and regulatory frameworks of this 'new spirit' of capitalism, even as it does not claim any easy possibility of stepping outside them, or being unaffected by them. It playfully deploys []{#chapter05.xhtml#pg_120}spaces of consumer leisure, productivity and symbolic power, visiting these sites not during their usual periods of restlessness and buzz of activity, but rather during the times when they are not used and are generally inaccessible. Visitors are called upon to participate not by busying themselves with any curated or designed activities on the site, but by going to sleep. Sleep itself thus becomes valued as a conscious, corporeal, intimate activity, as non-passivity on the one hand, and simultaneously as an act of defiance towards the demands of what Jonathan Crary calls the 24/7 world, on the other. For Crary, non-stop activity and sleeplessness, specifically the idea of reducing the need to sleep, characterize the contemporary economic order, which makes sleep into 'a human need and interval of time that cannot be colonized and harnessed to a massive engine of profitability' ([2013](#bibliography.xhtml#ref61), pp. 10--11). The invitation for the project announces in a matter-of-factly worded subtitle: 'everybody is heading home. we're staying. to sleep.'^[8](#chapter05.xhtml#fn8){#chapter05.xhtml#ft8}^ Sleep is announced here in what could be read as a tone of defiance, not in the form of a loud slogan on a banner, but more reminiscent of a mobile phone text message, abbreviating punctuation rules for speed and convenience, typed into a gadget that never sleeps, or whose 'sleep mode' merely means that it can be readily activated at any given moment. The critical aesthetic qualities of *Nomad City Passage* are derived from the fact that sleep remains a profoundly ambivalent, evocative and delicate matter. Sleep is foregrounded as a mode of participation in the urban intervention, thus ironically questioning common-sense conventions and assumptions around audience participation in theatre and performance theory.

The various locations in which the tents were set up in three different cities assume a theatrical dimension when experienced through the minute details that become perceptible only when one is lying down, preparing and waiting for sleep to arrive, when conversations have come to an end, lights have been switched off and the body is ritually prepared to rest. The location's sounds and smells and nooks and corners begin to come to life. It is the camera that then remains awake and charged, recording some of these sounds and impressions: the curious sounds of the machinery of a water pumping station, the circumferential streaks of city lights from the top floor []{#chapter05.xhtml#pg_121}of a skyscraper. Participants whom I contacted in 2015, between six and ten years after their single night's camping experience, curiously and surprisingly remembered sensorial details such as the eerie creak of an empty school classroom at night, the mist drops on the golf course in the early morning, or the odours of the turf floor of a tennis club.^[9](#chapter05.xhtml#fn9){#chapter05.xhtml#ft9}^ One participant, who camped on a golf course, remembered that most members of the group woke up rather late in the morning, and had to hurry to break down their tents because of a horse racing event that was about to start at the same venue.^[10](#chapter05.xhtml#fn10){#chapter05.xhtml#ft10}^ Another participant, who camped at a hardware store in Linz in 2009, remarked in an interview:

My strongest memories are from the morning: for one thing, having breakfast together with the other participants. \[...\] And then, going to the staff rooms to brush my teeth. On the way I encountered the first customer who walked into the hardware store. This situation was very intriguing and also funny. I woke up feeling 'at home' in this huge hardware store and it was thus awkward that people were suddenly walking around the place shopping on the spot where I had only recently pitched my tent.^[11](#chapter05.xhtml#fn11){#chapter05.xhtml#ft11}^

Even the phrase 'waiting for sleep to arrive' renders sleep an actor or actress in the wings of the stage whose entry is awaited by the spectators. Yet the arrival of sleep can never be planned or foretold with certainty. Jacqueline Rose notes in her reading of Freud's *Interpretation of Dreams:* 'Sleep ... cannot be willed. It only comes inadvertently. \[...\] we never know what will happen -- or exactly where we are going -- when we go to sleep' (Rose, [2003](#bibliography.xhtml#ref168), p. 110). Simultaneously, when we say that we 'go to sleep', it is as if it is not sleep that comes to us, but we who must go to it. In *Nomad City Passage*, the collective performance of sleep oscillates between being an intense, active, dynamic experience on the one hand, and a non-performance, an absence of activity on the other. It raises the question of the relation between the omission and commission of acts and the concept of the performative. Whereas performativity is predominantly understood as a productive and generative concept, it might be asked what is the performativity of seemingly non-productive aspects of human action, such as silence, hesitation or sleep (Gronau and Lagaay, [2008](#bibliography.xhtml#ref87), p. 11; Lagaay and Lorber, [2012](#bibliography.xhtml#ref123)). Going to sleep need not be seen as a negation []{#chapter05.xhtml#pg_122}or refusal of participation but indeed as a form of participation that enables the emergence of a different sociality and inhabitation of space, somewhere between doing and non-doing.

One participant remarked in email correspondence:

In Germany, one doesn't just sleep in the middle of the city centre on a public terrain. Or if one does so, as a homeless person, a partygoer, or a protestor, it is always an act of transgression and always comes with a host of restrictions. I can remember exchanging glances with other participants as we pumped up our air mattresses in front of the Gehry buildings^[12](#chapter05.xhtml#fn12){#chapter05.xhtml#ft12}^ -- a feeling of trespassing over an invisible threshold and a feeling of reassurance in observing other participants doing the same.^[13](#chapter05.xhtml#fn13){#chapter05.xhtml#ft13}^

Although a sense of transgression and awkwardness was palpably felt, the event had a remarkably quiet and delicate dramaturgy. A highly pre-determined and charged site such as the Gehry commercial complex in Düsseldorf presents its own means of restricting even a temporary occupation and transformation of the space. At the same time, the transformation is not sudden but over the passage of time. This mixture is expressed in the word 'passage' in the title *Nomad City Passage*, conjuring the association of a transit or journey from one state to another, as well as a physical passage or route. Jean Luc Nancy's philosophical essay on sleep, entitled in French *Tombe de sommeil*, literally translates as the tomb or tombstone of sleep, as if a physical monument could stand for a passage of time, the unit with which sleep is measured. However, the word *tombe* also resonates with *tomber*, 'to fall', thus strikingly associating the act of 'falling asleep' with the passage from one state to another, with sleep as a liminal state between wakefulness and death (Nancy, [2009](#bibliography.xhtml#ref138)). The English translation of Nancy's essay is notably *The Fall of Sleep*, a phrase that imaginatively captures both the fall or decline of the value of sleep in a modernity marked by an economy of sleepless wakefulness, as well as the act of falling, dropping without control into the intoxicated stupor of consumerism, which is also associated with sleep. In German, *die Passage* is further used in compounded form in words such as *Einkaufspassage* (shopping mall) or *Filmpassage* (cinema centre), or with reference to a passage from a text, film, a musical piece and the like. The project evokes all these associations: in its choice of quotidian spaces with a predominantly commercial or entrepreneurial dimension; in the suggestion []{#chapter05.xhtml#pg_123}that these spaces, despite their overwhelming, monumental, symbolic power and architectural pre-determination, become vulnerable when used in unintended ways (*tombe* as monument/tombstone and *tomber* as falling); and in the association of the tent as equipment that accompanies a journey or transit, pitched along the way, a liminal space of shelter during the passage from night to morning or from one place to another.^[14](#chapter05.xhtml#fn14){#chapter05.xhtml#ft14}^

In the video documentation accompanying the project in Cologne, aptly titled 'Obere Etagen' \[Top Floors\], a term that colloquially refers to the top levels of a hierarchy as well as the top floors of a building, Reich remarks:

\[our\] notion of immortality or perpetuity is also linked to our skyscrapers. Symbols of power they certainly are, and simultaneously so delicate. How delicate they are, we came to realize in the course of researching the project \[...\] how difficult it can be to make these places accessible, especially to strangers. (Reich and Richter, [2011](#bibliography.xhtml#ref162))

The vulnerability and susceptibility of a commercial skyscraper becomes apparent when confronted by the delicacy of the act of 25 people setting up tents to sleep on its 41st storey for one single night. Its spectacularity is a reminder of Guy Debord's well-known lines from *The Society of the Spectacle*:

As long as necessity is socially dreamed, dreaming will remain a social necessity. The spectacle is the bad dream of a modern society in chains and ultimately expresses itself in nothing more than its wish for sleep. The spectacle is the guardian of that sleep. (Debord, [1967](#bibliography.xhtml#ref67), para. 21)

Debord's cry against consumer culture and commodification is dialectically contrasted in *Nomad City Passage* with the monumental buildings and sites of this consumerism literally, gently, unassumingly being called upon to guard the sleep and the dreams of their visitors, to be the stage on which society can recuperate itself from its maelstrom of endless activity, speed, vigilance, mobility and wakefulness, to reach higher levels in the very act of sleeping, as it were. The fragility of consumer spectacle is contrasted with the defenceless, exposed state that people are in when they are asleep. Reich points out in the video documentation that participants displayed a noticeable forthrightness and critical honesty when it came to choosing the spot on which their []{#chapter05.xhtml#pg_124}tent was to be set up, in their location preferences in the allotted site, in the way they sought to establish a familiarity and a sense of comfort in the space, as a way of protecting themselves for the experience of sleep (Reich and Richter, [2011](#bibliography.xhtml#ref162)). In Cologne, the familiarity and normality of sleep was sought in an unfamiliar environment, namely the top floor of a commercial skyscraper. In Linz, on the other hand, the sites themselves, which were quotidian, mostly public spaces, were de-familiarized through the acts of camping on them.

Crary introduces a social critique into this existential dimension, arguing that 'sleep cannot be eliminated, but it can be wrecked and despoiled \[...\] the injuring of sleep is inseparable from the ongoing dismantling of social protections in other spheres' (Crary, [2013](#bibliography.xhtml#ref61), pp. 17--18). To fall asleep is thus to become imperilled in a way that makes evident how a certain 'precariousness' is a shared condition, common to all (Lorey, [2015](#bibliography.xhtml#ref127)). In response to Crary, one could say that sleep is not simply a state of passive vulnerability, nor can it conversely be hailed as a radical form of resistance to commercialization. In artistic practices such as *Nomad City Passage*, sleep retains a certain delicate ambivalence that renders it a counter-intuitively potent gesture of participation.

**The poetic politics of camping**

*Nomad City Passage* does not explicitly draw connections between the personal and the biopolitical dimensions of sleep in the way Crary does; it is not foremost a commentary about how sleep is beleaguered by post-industrial capitalism or about camping as a political act. In its minimal artistic design there is no tokenistic reference to or representation of homelessness, to the tourism and leisure industry and its economy of providing comfort and relaxation, to the deterioration of housing for the poor, or to the larger, now ever more current political topics of refuge and asylum, although it does not require a great stretch of the imagination for a participant to make these connections. When camping is evoked as an archaic principle of temporarily inhabiting a site and moving on, the mobility of some immediately conjures the immobility of others (Budgen, [2000](#bibliography.xhtml#ref37), p. 155). The leisurely pleasure of camping summons the idea of the camp as a place of refuge from []{#chapter05.xhtml#pg_125}persecution or danger for others, or as a site of visible, collective occupation. The urban interventions in Linz, Düsseldorf and Cologne took place between 2005 and 2009, long before tents occupied the Maidan, Tahrir Square, Gezi Park, Zuccotti Park, Bahrain Central Square and the city centres in Barcelona, Lisbon and Athens. Yet they took place only shortly after the sleep-in blockades of anti-nuclear and anti-militarist activists in Germany, the UK and France in the late 1990s, the joyful celebrations of the *Reclaim the Streets* movement, the tent occupations of the alter-globalization activists in Seattle in 1999 or Genoa in 2001 (Notes from Nowhere, [2003](#bibliography.xhtml#ref143)) and the tent city of youth protesting the presence of the Syrian army that appeared in Martyrs' Square and Riad al-Solh Square in central Beirut in Lebanon in February 2005, following the assassination of the former prime minister Rafik Hariri (Bayoumi, [2005](#bibliography.xhtml#ref17)).

*Nomad City Passage* took place in an artistic context before camping in public spaces started to become a subject of interest to art museums and exhibition circuits as an act of artistic activism.^[15](#chapter05.xhtml#fn15){#chapter05.xhtml#ft15}^ At the same time, it evokes a rich legacy of artworks at the crossroads of performance, scenography, architecture and the visual arts. In interviews, the artists reference the conceptual art, land art and body art traditions emergent in the US in the 1960s and 1970s, particularly the work of Allan Kaprow, John Cage, Robert Smithson, Georges Brecht and Chris Burden, remarking that these historical connections may not have been apparent to them at the time but became evident later.^[16](#chapter05.xhtml#fn16){#chapter05.xhtml#ft16}^ However, unlike the avant-garde experiments of that time, which often sought to test the borders of participation and see how far they could allow themselves to go in stretching the limits of existing artistic conventions, *Nomad City Passage* seeks a subtle and non-spectacular exploration of urban space as lived and embodied.^[17](#chapter05.xhtml#fn17){#chapter05.xhtml#ft17}^ Rather than being challenged and provoked, audiences are welcomed with hospitality and carefully informed about what the artists' intentions are. It is the absence of planned events and activities that enables the spaces to be viewed with a different eye, distanced from their usual utilitarian inhabitation.

The tent becomes the space for an intimate quotidian act of wearing one's nightclothes and going to sleep, withdrawing from the presence of others. Whether in outdoor or indoor environments, []{#chapter05.xhtml#pg_126}the tents were not only a means of protecting and marking one's place of sleep, but also served to ensure that participants would have the right to be left in peace and not be pulled into the limelight.^[18](#chapter05.xhtml#fn18){#chapter05.xhtml#ft18}^ At the same time, the tent is one among several others, and the participants all huddle together, as it were, each in their own tent. In the choice of sites, in the choice of camping gear provided to participants and the documentation and framing of the events, *Nomad City Passage* carefully refrains from romanticizing sleep as a universal, ahistorical and uniformly pleasant phenomenon or from nostalgically conjuring a representation of what it once was and no longer is. Instead of overtly politicizing the event or introducing any narrative frames, the artists choose to configure it in terms of hospitality and interaction between site and visitors. Participants are personally introduced to the space and guided through it. The permission granted by the caretakers and proprietors and the invitation extended to outsiders are essential conditions of possibility for their participation. As Gareth White has argued with reference to the theatre, the invitation to participate is itself an authored process, 'making the audience participant more productive of signs and affects, more complex as a site of perception and action' (White, [2013](#bibliography.xhtml#ref203), p. 195). This implies that the way an invitation is made, the manner in which it is extended, is co-constitutive of the aesthetics of participation, similar to the way in which the invitation is accepted, taken up and enacted by its recipients. Reich points to the multiple layers of participation, remarking in an interview:

To us, the participants were conceived of not so much as participants but more as guests, to whom we, as hosts, extended an invitation. We had the role of mediating between the actual occupants of the spaces and the visitors, being responsible for the guests feeling safe and welcome. At the same time, we saw ourselves too as guests in the space.^[19](#chapter05.xhtml#fn19){#chapter05.xhtml#ft19}^

Such an affective dimension immediately renders audience participation in the artwork and the artwork's participation in urban spaces different in significant ways from sociological and political concepts of participation. Where social theory conceives of civic participation in terms of belonging, or of being a part of some larger entity or social unit, the aesthetics of *Nomad City Passage* emphasizes participation in a counter-intuitive way: it becomes possible to participate precisely []{#chapter05.xhtml#pg_127}because of *not* being a part of some shared community ideal. The invitation to spend a night in a hardware store together with 25 people is attractive simply because it makes possible the thrill of participation without belonging, commitment or affiliation. This does not mean that the paradoxes of social interaction are not recognized in social or political theory. As Reich points out, social theorists such as Richard Sennett in *The Fall of Public Man* (1977) recognized early on how the attempt to generate intimacy and closeness between white-collar workers in large, shared workspaces in fact led to a greater sense of perceived isolation and withdrawal from public affairs (Sennett, [1993](#bibliography.xhtml#ref175)).^[20](#chapter05.xhtml#fn20){#chapter05.xhtml#ft20}^ The tents in *Nomad City Passage* paradoxically gesture both towards the intimate social contact denied to people in commercial public spaces on the one hand, as well as towards the necessary distance required between people in order for them to be sociable and invested in participating in civic life, on the other. Participants can be sociable and communicative because of the possibility of having the tent as a space of withdrawal, and they can perceive the spaces as public only when their utilitarian or commercial function is put aside, however temporarily.

**On the archive of ephemeral experiences**

Not having personally attended any of the events and only accessing the project several years after its completion, the available documentation on *Nomad City Passage* became an important source for my exploration of its participatory aesthetics, in addition to personal communication with the artists and several former participants, and one employee who works at one of the sites. The documentation takes the form of two videos and a paper collage. The first video, entitled 'Normalzustand' ('Normality', 2009), relates to the six camping events in Linz, and the second film, entitled 'Obere Etagen' ('Top Floors', 2011), documents the six overnight stays in Cologne's skyscrapers.^[21](#chapter05.xhtml#fn21){#chapter05.xhtml#ft21}^ In all three locations, a photographer and/or a filmmaker was invited to attend the events and offer an audiovisual documentation and exploration of their own experience, rather than simply executing instructions from the artists. 'Normality' is a collage of images and ambient sounds from the six camping sites in Linz, with []{#chapter05.xhtml#pg_128}no narrative commentary or dialogue, played in fast-forward mode, thus compressing the passage of time and providing an atmospheric record of the sites in their transition from being quotidian spaces such as supermarkets or school buildings, to the arrival of the visitors, the gradual occupation of the spaces, the hours of quiet in the night and their departure in the morning. The curatorial concept of the documentation in 'Normality' emphasizes participation in spatial terms, i.e. how people approach and inhabit, take part in and contribute to the life of each space. Interestingly, space takes on more of an audio than a visual dimension, as the fast-forward mode allows for a cursory glance at the space, whereas the audio clips record minute details in real time. In contrast, the video documentation 'Top Floors' in Cologne emphasizes the social and communicative aspects of audience participation, featuring moments of encounter, astonishment, mundaneness and the very physical acts of setting up and breaking down the tents on the top floors of the skyscrapers, overlooking the cityscape from above. The voice-over narrative in the video features comments by the artists and the custodians of the sites.

What is the status of the documentation in relation to the event, in terms of the question of participation? For the analysis of works such as *Nomad City Passage*, the documentation is not a simple record of an event, but rather a transposition of various facets of the event into a different medium.^[22](#chapter05.xhtml#fn22){#chapter05.xhtml#ft22}^ The paper collage, for instance, entitled 'Album' (2014), pieces together various moments of the process of developing the idea and comprises various physical records, such as newspaper articles and images, official permission letters and technical clearances, notes from the registration forms of participants, offering a panorama of participant motivations and relations to the site, in itself a valuable pool of audience research data. In response to questions about the relationship of visitors to the site, in this case a skyscraper in Cologne, visitors explain how they view it as a landmark or orientation around the city, or remember it since its construction following the demolition of a previously existing building, or how they find it the most ugly building in the city and wish it could be removed from the landscape.^[23](#chapter05.xhtml#fn23){#chapter05.xhtml#ft23}^ Access to such documents, especially given the absence of an opportunity to participate directly in the event, provides a rich archive for analysing various aspects of []{#chapter05.xhtml#pg_129}people's participation in the artwork and the artwork's participation in public life.

The role of new (implying electronic) technologies in participatory works is a recurring topic in the scholarship on immersive performances, as their adaptation to the artistic context raises questions of liveness, simultaneity, presence and co-creation. Technological developments over the twentieth century have accorded a large-scale dimension to participation, giving importance to the question of the number of participants, the (technical) ease or access of participation, or the wide reach across regions and social groups, regardless of the objectives or quality of participation (Huybrechts, [2011](#bibliography.xhtml#ref103), p. 24). The reliance on user-led technology in theatre and performance as a tool to enhance audience participation has become commonplace: from audience members being asked to wear headphones, or follow instructions on mobile devices, to using interactive screens, communicating with other spectators or people outside of the performance space during the performance, to radio ballets, simulations and games. The application of electronic technology in performance to seek the active, physical or virtual participation of audiences in co-creating the performance has been variously read as heralding 'an unsettling and/or exhilarating process of becoming aware of the fusion of senses' (Machon, [2013](#bibliography.xhtml#ref128), p. 143), or dismissed as 'ornamental, illusionistic devices perpetrating a treachery on the audience' (Schechner, [1973](#bibliography.xhtml#ref172), p. 77).

Beyond these judgements of their moral value, with the resultant sifting of seemingly good or bad kinds of participation, the role of technologies in relation to the question of participation draws attention to its sites, modes and means (Magelsen, [2014](#bibliography.xhtml#ref129)). Where, how and through which forms or formats does participation 'occur' or fail to do so? How is the experience of participation in art grounded in and distributed across mind, body, space, objects, dialogical exchange or non-verbal social interaction? In what ways does technology influence this experience, where participation might mean 'playing a game' in some cases, and 'eavesdropping on a conversation' in other situations, where immersive participation can range from a sensory immersion (large screens, powerful sound environments, haptic experiences) to an imaginative immersion (identification, empathy, problem solving, []{#chapter05.xhtml#pg_130}cooperation and communication) (Susi, [2014](#bibliography.xhtml#ref181), pp. 192--193)? On the one hand, it is evident that the incorporation of different media into the staging and scenographic elements of theatre has been a part of theatre history for centuries and need not be regarded as unique to the twentieth century. On the other hand, it is undeniable that they are now being increasingly studied and appreciated in terms of how they reconfigure formal aesthetic dimensions and conventions of the theatre. In performance theory, they have led to revised conceptions of what liveness and co-presence mean (Giannachi and Kaye, [2011](#bibliography.xhtml#ref83)), how the strict boundary between production and reception is broken down (Harvie, [2013](#bibliography.xhtml#ref94)), questions about the authenticity or the spectacularity of participatory technologies (Huybrechts, [2011](#bibliography.xhtml#ref103)) and about the ensuing questions of authorship, collective bodies and collaboration (Cull and Gritzner, [2011](#bibliography.xhtml#ref62)).

Yet in conjunction with the question of documentation and archive, the issue is one of finding what Josephine Machon terms 'a lasting ephemerality'; thus fleeting, momentary experiences that lead to lasting embodied memories (Machon, [2013](#bibliography.xhtml#ref128)), and a mode of transmission that can be accessed by those who were absent. The video and printed documentation of *Nomad City Passage* attempts to retain a sense of the ephemerality of the experience, with fleeting images and sounds, the light gradually shifting from evening to night to morning, ending with the spaces returning to exactly the same situation that existed before the camping took place. The documentation, however, also invites the question of what is politically and culturally at work in the deployment of these forms at a given moment in time, in what ways the generation of technologically aided, shared experiences and encounters in the sphere of art is related to larger modes of government or emergent forms of subjectivity in complex, contradictory ways (Kunst, [2015](#bibliography.xhtml#ref122)).

What I am trying to say is that the problem of archiving and documentation is more than a methodological or technical concern, and touches on the status of participation in the context of the visual arts alongside the category of 'contemporary art'. Participation and collaborative creation are often considered as among the main characteristics of contemporary art; thus a genealogy of participatory practices is often inseparable from the genealogy of what has come []{#chapter05.xhtml#pg_131}to be known as contemporary art. Boris Groys offers a two-pronged explanation for this: first, the absence of a so-called 'inner value' of contemporary art, i.e. its merit being dependent not on internal, formal or verifiable aesthetic criteria, but on how it is valued or appreciated by its public (Groys, [2008](#bibliography.xhtml#ref89), p. 20). The physical involvement or engagement of museum or exhibition visitors could thus be either a direct affirmation of this absent 'inner value' of the artwork or, conversely, a critical response by the artists to it. A second explanation is to be found in the commercialization and commodification of the visual art market, which, according to Groys, leads to the devaluation of art and the separation of artists from the public, thereby compelling artists and audiences to search for 'the binding value of art ... in non-commercial -- if not directly anti-commercial and simultaneously collaborative -- practice' (Groys, [2008](#bibliography.xhtml#ref89), p. 21). In both arguments, participation is presented as the positively connoted response to two interconnected problems: to the absence of autonomous artistic value and to the commercialization of modern art.

Juliane Rebentisch similarly identifies the category of participation as central to contemporary art, but draws a different, more convincing conclusion in her analysis. Rebentisch connects the rise of an experiential, participatory approach to a paradigm shift in aesthetic theory, whereby the idea of a distinct, autonomous artwork is called into question. The phenomenon of audiences participating in the making of an artwork goes hand in hand with the crisis in modern art, with its loss of faith in aesthetic universalism or in a truth-led aesthetic (*Wahrheitsästhetik*). Aesthetic experience can no longer be presented in pure or abstract, universalizable terms. It is thus relayed to the level of the particular, and in the process becomes inseparable from the dimension of intersubjectivity, i.e. the dimension of human interaction. The question of participation in contemporary art is thus one of aesthetic experience and thereby becomes tied to the question of participation in social life, thus to the problem of intersubjectivity in art. This intertwining of aesthetic experience and intersubjectivity leads to vastly divergent results in terms of how this participation takes shape and what its aims are (Rebentisch, [2013](#bibliography.xhtml#ref157), pp. 59--60). Rebentisch argues that the increasingly active role assigned to viewers in contemporary art, specifically installation art, should not be []{#chapter05.xhtml#pg_132}mistaken for interactivity, but rather indicates 'the constitutive role of the viewer for the ontology of the work of art *in general*. \[...\] "the inclusion of the beholder" places installation art in direct relation to a central problem of modern philosophy: the problem of an ontology founded on the subject--object distinction' (Rebentisch, [2012](#bibliography.xhtml#ref156), p. 15). Participation thus becomes the concept with which the philosophical problem of the subject--object distinction is rethought, namely the distinction between artwork and experience, or between artist and viewer.

This view is shared, though differently framed, by Janet Kraynak. In her influential essay on Bruce Nauman's installations entitled 'Dependent Participation' ([2007](#bibliography.xhtml#ref121)), Kraynak argues that the shift towards audience participation in visual art was historically motivated by a combination of three reasons: first, it follows a Marxist model of realigning the relationship between subjects and objects and thus between viewers and artworks; second, it follows a post-structuralist model of critiquing authorship and thus leads to artworks that trouble the notion of authorship; and third, it follows a model of collective creation in opposition to a view of art that is of consumptive value to bourgeois elites (Kraynak, [2007](#bibliography.xhtml#ref121), pp. 228--229).

All these analyses of the historical emergence of participatory practices present them as being responses to a set of problems. These are not simply formal or aesthetic problems but are complementary to broader social concerns. The problem of the gap between artists and their audiences emerges as complementary to the problem of social inequalities and hierarchies; the question of ascertaining universal aesthetic standards or values is inseparable from the question of cultural or historical universalism. Participation becomes the category for registering ruptures in the social-political and the artistic spheres, even as it is deployed as an antidote to the quandaries that these ruptures pose.

Participation in *Nomad City Passage* touches precisely on this question of the relationship between aesthetic experience and intersubjectivity. This relationship is not conceived as staking a claim to rights, citizenship, privileges and public goods or community, nor as holding the promise of taking part in something universal and ahistorical. Rather it remains a fleeting, short-lived inhabitation of a space, taking care to leave as few traces as possible and not seeking any material []{#chapter05.xhtml#pg_133}alterations in the space. The urban intervention is intensely low-key and involves an inconspicuous though intimate presence, rather than a participation through 'productive' activity. In Rebentisch's words, 'the possibility of participation itself becomes the material to reflect upon, by which the visitor is enmeshed in a certain sense, and which can touch him or her much more intensely than the reduction of aesthetic experience to practical participation might have it' ([2015](#bibliography.xhtml#ref158), p. 38). It is thus not so much a matter of the practical effectiveness of participation or its absence, but rather the question of the potential or possibility of participation that *Nomad City Passage* delicately gestures towards. One participates by reflecting on the terms of one's participation. The visceral aspect of participation is complemented by the reflection and observation of one's own participation. The seemingly immediate relation to the site remains in tension with one's awareness of the artistic transformation of the site (Rebentisch, [2013](#bibliography.xhtml#ref157), p. 88). In *Nomad City Passage* this tension holds true for the participants, as well as for potential future audiences who can only access reflections of or reports and documents of the project. Not its clarity of message or pronounced allegiance to a cause, but its ambiguity and permeability between private and public, between individual and collective experience, characterize the participatory quality of the act of collectively pitching a tent in an urban space.

However, one could modify this to the extent that the assertion of an independent symbolic space in *Nomad City Passage* is not separate from or in opposition to the realm of human interactions, but rather emergent from it. It also has congruencies with Claire Bishop's definition of participation in art, wherein 'people constitute the central artistic medium and material' (Bishop, [2012](#bibliography.xhtml#ref25), p. 2).

I have argued throughout this study that participatory art practices need to be understood in conjunction with the anxieties and contradictions that accompany them. Whether or not this is a formally constitutive characteristic worthy of naming as a genre is, in my view, less important than finding ways to account for and be responsive to the questions it poses. This is the place that this study departed from, yet oddly, it also the place it finds itself arriving at. For if this study has inquired into some of the conditions for and articulations of participation in the arts, it has also turned out to be an investigation of the ways in which participation is already circumscribed by the questions we ask of it, such as the social impact of participatory art, or its specific aesthetic features. The frictions in this endeavour will have become apparent to the perceptive reader: on the one hand I attempt to identify commonalities and systematic coherences in a field named as participatory art, and on the other hand I seek to analyse it in terms of its deviations from, and incommensurability with, a systematic narrative, in the emphasis of unruly, subtle, non-formalizable modes of participation. I treat participatory art as an inherited category, looking at its diverse, specific operations, or disciplinary routes and historical legacies. At the same time, I try to alter the terms of received wisdom by extrapolating principles and observations from the confines of one disciplinary arena into another. I search for ways in which affiliation to a given type of participatory practice might be described, only to find that formal coherences are perforated by aspects that exceed those same terms of affiliation. The analysis of participatory art and the conceptualization of participation in and through art thereby become intertwined in complex ways.

[]{#conclusion.xhtml#pg_137}Finding ways to study and interconnect participation in performance with performance's participation in its immediate and broader social, cultural, political or economic environment seems in my view one of the urgent tasks of scholarship. I have suggested that this partly involves pulsing the fluctuating but ever-existent boundaries between the aesthetic and the non-aesthetic, rather than seeking a disciplinary cartography that can supposedly contain and settle them. It also involves taking into account strategies of participation in the realms of artistic practice in the ways they render visible the failures and possibilities of people's participation in the public sphere. Terms such as the 'artwork', the 'production' or 'the artist' prove inadequate when considering that process, experience and encounter, rather than finished, authored works, are central to most participatory art forms. The gestures of participation are to be found in the most unexpected places and take on various hues and shapes. I argue throughout this study that the concept of participation in the arts should neither be restricted to a purely formalized reading, nor be elevated to a normative status, but rather should be open and alert to those issues and truth claims that come to light through the specific contexts of performance, contexts that need not be deemed antithetical to or incongruous with formalized models of participation in and of performance. This does not imply a dilution of the category of participatory art, implying that everything can be participatory in some way or other, but is rather a plea to take into consideration the precise modes of intersection between the dimensions of participation in art and the contexts of art's participation in social processes in the theorization of the category. Participatory forms in the arts must not be construed as abstract models with a self-governing aesthetic; they are not at one with themselves, but are burdened by the wider conjuncture of our times, 'forms of living in the world' in which a coerced or obligatory participation repeatedly exhausts our capacity to live up to the utopian demand for participation (Sangari, [2002](#bibliography.xhtml#ref171)).

The interpretation of participatory practices through the register of the gestural is my attempt to rethink participation while accommodating its contradictions and disquietudes. The notion of the gesture is not a transcendental key with which to unlock some final, proper significance and truth about how to resolve the paradoxes of []{#conclusion.xhtml#pg_138}participation once and for all, but rather one that I believe allows for renewing and revisiting the questions and stakes in it. Its provisionality and counter-intuitive suggestiveness are its limitation as well as what remain its hopes.

Thinking about gesture has fascinated many disciplines and traditions, from the natural sciences to sociology to philosophy, linguistics and the arts. Often the study of gesture pursues the search for its underlying rules and patterns, tying it to language, human physiognomy, to the relation between the body and the soul, or between individuals and societies, and to value systems. I have found these extensive possibilities of the concept to be methodologically helpful, offering a way to reflect on the paradoxes of participation in the arts. In mapping out the concept, gesture recurs as a foil to four interconnected realms: language, the body, the image and the act. Gestures have been referred to by the social theorist Marcel Mauss as 'techniques of the body': they are enabled by social or cultural norms and customs and are acquired and naturalized through a process of learning or imitation. They in turn feed back into and transform the social or the cultural, which allows us to claim that each society has its own gestures. Through this structuralist intertwining of the individual body and the social body, gestures come to be understood as 'physio-psycho-sociological assemblages' (Mauss, [1973](#bibliography.xhtml#ref132), p. 85). Gestures are thus both the outward expression of the psychic as well as the physical internalization of the social. They can be both involuntary or given in the human body apparatus, as well as culturally imposed and acquired; they can be unskilled and skilled, routine or effortful (Noland, [2009](#bibliography.xhtml#ref141), p. 6). Gestures can constitute a language or aesthetic system of their own, as in the Indian conception of *abhinaya*, gestures that link body, breath, narrative and repositories of meaning in a highly codified and yet open form. They can equally be theorized as supplementing and supporting language, or taking its place when language becomes impossible (Agamben, [1993](#bibliography.xhtml#ref2)).

Here too, when it is said that gestures are a system of non-verbal communication, the contextual, social element is critical. Whether or not they bear meaning, gestures are inevitably hinged to the social framework from which they emerge. The gestures of language are inseparable from imagery, they bring forth images, hint at grasping []{#conclusion.xhtml#pg_139}language through a different, non-discursive dimension (McNeill, [2005](#bibliography.xhtml#ref133)). At the same time gestures are themselves dynamized images, they introduce observable movement into an image, with a beginning and an end. A gesture is an image on the way to becoming an act, or conversely, it is the halting of an act in its transition to image, the condensation of an act, interruptions that generate *tableaus* or frozen images. A gesture may bear the potential of an act, but is not yet an act. Similarly, participatory art possibly gestures towards a broader civic participation, but is not yet or not necessarily its accomplishment. Theatre theory, specifically Brecht's work on the *Gestus*, has widely employed the concept to refer to its capacities to generate highly charged moments (Brecht, [1964](#bibliography.xhtml#ref32)).

In the way that the gesture speaks to both the body and to language, to the image and to the act, to the individual and to the collective, I find it offers a fruitful path to reflect on the operations of participatory art. In their being situated between the image and the act, I regard the gestural aspects of participatory art as being situated at the juncture between the visual and the performing arts. Shannon Jackson has referred to this cross-pollination of vocabularies and modes of perception -- visual arts employing theatrical modes and theatre moving closer to scenographic or architectural modes -- as typically characterizing participatory works (Jackson, [2011](#bibliography.xhtml#ref111), p. 6). Participatory practices in the theatrical domain thus tend to generate moments of interrupted action, bringing the flow of acts to a temporary halt, giving rise to unexpected gestures. Participatory practices in the visual arts domain, on the other hand, appear to set still images into motion, putting their temporality to work, calling gestures into being.

In its mediation between the body and language, I find the notion of the gesture aptly captures the paradoxes of participatory art. Just as gesture is enabled by language and at the same time emerges in the place where language is muted or incapable, 'the other side of language', as it were (Agamben, [1999](#bibliography.xhtml#ref3), p. 78), so participation in art is both enabled by authoritative discourses as well as 'gagged' by them. One side of the paradox of participation is that there are rules of participation given to us, set by art institutions, genres, specific practices or cultural conventions. They invite and enable participation. The other side of the paradox is that the freedom or desire to participate []{#conclusion.xhtml#pg_140}can never be restricted only to these pre-determined modes of participation. With reference to the political sphere, Judith Butler argues that to participate only according to the rules would imply that sooner or later one becomes subject to the rules (Butler, [2014a](#bibliography.xhtml#ref43)). So the question of participation is: who sets the terms? The gestures of participation may remain illegible to the established discursive procedures of participatory theatre; they resist formalization without necessarily opposing it, and may thus not even be recognized as resistant. A thin line separates the two sides of potential and limitation, of enabling participation (giving it a bodily possibility) and regulating it (fixing it in rules), demarcating the contours of its genres.

In terms of the notion of the gesture as an assemblage of the physical, psychic and social (Mauss, [1973](#bibliography.xhtml#ref132)), moving between the individual and the collective body, I find this resonant with an understanding of participatory art that encompasses both people's participation in artworks and processes as well as the participation (or non-participation) of art in public life. Rather than speaking of its measurable, quantifiable impact, I have argued for an 'inconvenient' understanding of the means and ends of participatory art, in order not to limit the appreciation of these practices to which version of participation is the right or most impactful one, but to appreciate how participation occurs in ways that do not close down its potentials. Expressions of critique towards institutions may involve embracing institutions or setting up counter-institutions, a critique that is not necessarily oppositional, or may not be conventionally considered as 'artistic', but nevertheless involves 'artful' acts of criticality, in that they reveal the mechanisms of institutional power that so forcefully shape theatrical practices and the scholarly discourses that accompany them. To that extent, a gestural appraisal of participatory art is a plea not to reduce the understanding of participation to a matter of verifiability. In some cases, a work may be participatory in the way that it allows us to reflect on the (im)possibility of participation, more than in the implementation of this possibility (Rebentisch, [2015](#bibliography.xhtml#ref158), p. 38). It imaginatively gestures towards it without necessarily acting upon it.

I wish I could end with the confidence that participatory artistic practices will lead the way in revamping and injecting fresh life into a notion that is currently becoming a frenzied euphemism for voluntary []{#conclusion.xhtml#pg_141}subordination and a profit-oriented drive to self-enhancement. Can small hopes stand against big data, big capital, or even bigger planetary collapses? Gayatri Spivak writes: 'We must know what mistake to make with a specific text and must also know how to defend that mistake as the one that will allow us to live' ([2012](#bibliography.xhtml#ref178), p. 28). It is in this inconvenient sense that I regard the study of participatory art as an intended mistake -- no guarantees or certainties, only gestures of spiritedness.
