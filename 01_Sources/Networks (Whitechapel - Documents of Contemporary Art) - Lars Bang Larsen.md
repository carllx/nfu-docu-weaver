NETWoRKs The rise of electronic media has initiated a cultural shift from the modernist grid's determination of projection and representation to the fluid structures and circuits of the network, presenting art with new challenges and possibilities. Artists have used the‘space of flows' to set up countercultural or utopian scenarios,reveal hidden forms of subjugation or initiate new types of reciprocity, in works that address changed conditions of co-dependence and new sites of social negotiation.

# Documents of Contemporary Art  

In recent decades artists have progressively expanded the boundaries of art as they have sought to engage with an increasingly pluralistic environment. Teaching, curating and understanding of art and visual culture are likewise no longer grounded in traditional aesthetics but centred on significant ideas, topics and themes ranging from the everyday to the uncanny, the psychoanalytical to the political.  

The Documents of Contemporary Art series emerges from this context. Each volume focuses on a specific subject or body of writing that has been of key influence in contemporary art internationally. Edited and introduced by a scholar, artist, critic or curator, each of these source books provides access to a plurality of voices and perspectives defining a significant theme or tendency.  

For over a century the Whitechapel Gallery has offered a public platform for art and ideas. In the same spirit, each guesteditor represents a distinct yet diverse approach - rather than one institutional position or school of thought - and has conceived each volume to address not only a professional audience but all interested readers.  

Ours is a brand-new world of all-at-onceness.  

TIME has ceased,  

SPACE has vanished. We now live in a global village e ... a simultaneous happening

BACTERIA communicate with our cells, telling them about a world 'out there', a chatter of which we are very little aware, not to mention the resonances of all matter in the world, constantly humming to every part of our bodies, the boundaries of which thus dissolve, because we are also resonance, a cloud of microbes, ENERGY, SMELL AND LIGHT  

# Lars Bang Larsen Introduction//The Unimaginable Globality of Networks  

It is fair to assume that the reader of this text belongs to the percentage of the world's population with Internetaccess, as does their writer. Yet if being a member of the 'online community' is a privilege, it is not one that we enjoy only when we feel like it: to be a citizen, consumer and worker is to be hooked up. Connectivity is a compulsion that subtends social participation and cultural imagination.  

Maybe this is why networked life is often perceived in terms of givens and general conditions: the economy is ‘global'; friends and colleagues are all collapsed into one's ‘network'; connectivity gives rise to ‘complexity'. Our digital contemporaneity seems to beg such totalizations, which create opacity and silence by tending to put experience out of reach. In other words, as a theme, the network revolves inescapably around the Internet, today's network of networks, yet importantly it also stirs other fields, practices and materialities. For this reason, and wishing to counteract exclusive interpretations regarding media and periodization,this is not a book only about new media or the Internet era: instead, it takes its historical beginning before the Net and attempts to point beyond its domination in the present.  

In art, networks and webs cease to be instruments and infrastructure and can be acknowledged as phenomena that range across the infra, the macro and the inbetween. Thus the texts and works sampled in this book deal with topics as varied as cyborg traditions (Joasia Krysa); feminist activism (Pamela Allara); UK punk culture(Stephen Willats); communicative networks in fungal mould (Pia Lindman); and reflections on how historical trade routes inform the contemporary art biennial (Okwui Enwezor). Networks offer a unique perspective on structures and fault lines where the fact-based and the speculative, the historical and the non-human encroach on one another. Cosmologies are embedded in networks.  

Because networks tend to place themselves at the beginning and end of space, time and body, art is called for to go to the boundaries of experience. One can apply Sci-Fi writer William Gibson's paranoiac notion of cyberspace as a 'consensual hallucination' to ways in which networks usurp reality; the artist Mark Lombardi's drawings - ‘narrative structures' that map out webs of corruption between politics, big business and old boys' networks in the years around the turn of the millennium - is an example of work that targets such insidious consensus with a symptomatic kind of hyper-attention that quite literally connects the dots between seemingly unrelated entities. A perhaps more exotic example from this reader is the media event FAX ONLY - Send more information (1991), created by the Copenhagen collaborative Koncern° as a meditation on how an exponential growth in the exchange of information will eventually lead to communicative entropy.  

Before it became dominated by digital connotations, the network was a social concept. In the eighteenth century Adam Smith defined a supply chain as a network; Jurgen Habermas describes the public sphere as a network; and the media theorist Friedrich Kittler defined his concept of discourse network (Aufschreibesysteme) as 'The network of technologies and institutions that allow a given culture to select, store, and process relevant data'.! In this way, as the first section, Connectivity before and beyond the Net, suggests, network theories and practices existed before we went online; Sadie Plant, for instance, links the ageold, transcultural and gendered craft of weaving to writing and programming.  

Cited by management theory, the term network took on its cybernetic connotationsin the late 1950s.2 Concurrently,artists developed other approaches to technology's societal tendency. Joseph Beuys' notion of soziales Plastik - social sculpture - took the form of a reticular structure in his installation Honigpumpe am Arbeitsplatz (Honeypump in the Workplace, 1976), where honey flows in long transparent tubes that meander through the art institution. A kind of alchemical signifier for the integration of aesthetics and politics, individual and community, it is an artwork that materializes circulating social energies as well asspiritual processes.  

Where Beuys found a biological metaphor for the social sphere in the life of bees, Gego(Gertrud Goldschmidt) dealt - in a less holistic and symbolic manner - with the network as 'a structure underlying all vital elements in our universe'.3 Made with segments and small rods of metal wire, her environments are based on the graphic problem of the line. Thus the Reticulareas (1969-77） are multidimensional, more or less irregular and willowy nets or webs, marking and reorganizing space and webbing-in their spectators. No two installations of her works are exactly the same, as their loose-jointed metal bits will arrange themselves anew. Both visceral and abstract, the Reticulareas disregard the distinction between human and non-human reality and make differences fall away between inside and outside, new and old, built and grown, outlining new, fragile junctions and meetings. A premonition of physicist Fritjof Capra's later, holistic idea that ‘the network is the pattern common to all life, Gego's work embodies the insight that systems as well as organisms are webs, are something already there, as pre-forms or proto-geometries. For all their modesty Gego's cosmologies do make universal claims. But instead of a modernist technorationalist utopia, a structure that is fundamentally open to the possibility of new developments is proposed, on the basis of a non-human vitality.  

In her work Gego insisted on the multiplicity of connections, their interrelations and interstices, against the art object as the One. It is as a corrective, for example, to Minimalism's industrial sublimity and masculinecoded rigour. Other artists found ways to eschew the one-way communication of single-channel media.It was mail art of the late 1950s and early1960s that mostradically developed a model for distributed authorship based oninformal exchanges that played out between many participants. These were artists and non-artists alike, but all of them authors doubling as senders and receivers, in a gift economy that established a present of strange, communicational events; 'of things arriving and departing at unforeseen times and places', as art historian Ina Blom puts it. Thus mail art could be seen to ‘place itself squarely in the realm of social exchanges, that is the realm whose entire principle of circulation and reciprocity is kept in check by the system of gifts'.5 These idiosyncratically circulating missives questioned the public nature of official communication systems, as well as the framework of the art institution. Mail art seemed to do perfectly well without the latter, its history and canons.6  

Crucially, networks are not just something out there. Marshall McLuhan's famous statement that 'electronic circuitry is an extension of the central nervous system' was provocative in the 1960s, but the human body's physical integration with multimedia terminals makes this a mere observation today. If there is something quaint or inaccurate about McLuhan's evocation of a conjunction of human nerve endings and optic fibres, it is only because he suggested that this meeting occur at a determinate point in time and space, and that it augments the human nervous system. However, the machinic and the organic can hardly be thought of as distinct; nor does human existence precede that of the machine. They are already touching and formatting one another in new assemblages and somatic-technological economies. A brain is an organ that via haptic gestures connects the nervous system to electronic circuitry through a touch screen ... or is it the screens that touch us with the pseudopodes of capital?  

In this way social formations and systems of communication, discourses and technologies, neurological and biological modes of being, new economies and cognitive styles bleed into one another in the network, and it seems counterproductive to talk about one without mentioning the other. Gilles Deleuze and Félix Guattari's concept of the rhizome, borrowed from botany, owes its influence to its capacity for lateral articulation of structures and events. One can thus take a rhizomatic view of history that contests etymology,genealogy and the influence of root narratives. Instead of primal scenes and immaculate origins, this view would accept cross-pollinations and irregular developments at all levels of life and culture. When binary recapture of truth and essence is prevented, nonlinear energies and influences are set free. A world without a historical centre is a realm that can be created anew, because meetings and events occur in many  

I discovered the charm of the line in and of itself - the line in space as well as the line drawn on a surface, and the nothing between the lines and the sparkling when they cross ... I discovered that sometimes in-between the lines is as important as the line itself empowered places. With his idea of 'the eternal network', for instance, Robert Filliou countered the military avant-garde metaphor as a principle of straight historic progress. Instead, Filliou held, each individual artist is part of an eternal network in which his or her knowledge - necessarily particular and incomplete - may supplement art as an investigation.?  

Accepting these multifarious definitions and histories of the network, and the notion of it as a dynamic principle, was the starting point for this selection of texts. Such methodological promiscuity is comparable to how networks seem charged with the power to connect different realms of being. This doesn't imply that there is a universal paradigm of 'the network' that exists over and beyond the particulars of any given network; as Alexander Galloway and Eugene Thacker point out, this would suggest 'a metaphysics of networks'8 Rather, this selection of texts seeks to exacerbate differences by dealing with a variety of social, natural and technological phenomena and artistic practices, as much as with the methods available for analysing them.According to the sociologist Bruno Latour's definition, for instance, the event is a network - an assemblage of contributing factors and unruly effects -not a thing unto itself. Thus the event-as-network appears in thelanguage that describes it.  

Whether within or outside discourse, networks are integral to what it means to be a historical subject. The second section, The Network as a Mode of Being, exploresembodied modalities that concern active processes of political subjectivation, as well as subaltern existence, or subjection to the movements of capital in which networks serve exploitative purposes. This is also about living in the city: drawing on cross-cultural sources and influences of music, Tarek Atoui's project Within (2013) plays compositions and 'pulses' into the soundscape of the city of Sharjah, thus makingvarious sonic movements feed off and feed back into each other. On the more speculative and Sci-Fi side of things, the text from Ann Lislegaard's digital animation Time Machine (2011) is performed by a stuttering fox-like animal that recites a passage from H.G. Wells' novel The Time Machine (1895) in which the protagonist travels ‘unfathomable distances' and realizes - inawaythatiscomparabletothewaytimeissubordinatedtospaceina networked society - that time is a dimension of space; in this case, a space where strange beings meander along the curvature of time.  

To the educator Fernand Deligny, writing in the early 1980s about his work with autistic children, the network was an existential formation, part of a singular series of utterances and encounters that connect the individual with his or her social and political contexts; a properly human mode of being because it grows from the ground up as a particular kind of togetherness on the margins of institutional power. Today such a view would have to be supplemented with a perspective on the bio-political adjustment and fine-tuning that, indirectly and profoundly, affects human life. When power no longer has a place because it is transposed to networks,it goes viral.A stage for struggles for freedom and control,the Netvariously accommodates,on the one hand,individual trajectories and anti-authoritarian forces, and on the other, the potentialfor the centralization of information and surveillance on a hitherto unseen scale. The Net is a threat to political institutions as we know them, and a mass ornament of control.  

InManuel Castells'tersedefinition,thenetworkis astructurethatprocesses flows. One can add that structure and flow typically aren't neatly separated, and that there is also a feedback loop between the two in which the process affects the structure. Information highways, for instance, aren't inflexible like road systems but are prone to sprouting new connections, their bandwidth pulsating according to user demand. To sociologists Luc Boltanski and Eve Chiapello, the network is simultaneously a ‘crystallized form' and a‘chaotic non-form'; a paradox which implies that the digitally connected subject lives in a condition between doing and undoing, between being an actively communicating subject and a passive vehicle for information inside larger techno-linguistic sequences.9 Whether you are a mover or just a relay for flow processing in a feedback loop is never quite clear.  

It seems that when it comes to networks of any kind, ignorance and knowledge rub against each other in intimate ambiguity. A network is a dynamic order that you can't fathom or gauge, because of its double-bound nature and the fact that it might be coextensive with all that possibly exists. As Umberto Eco put it brilliantly, the rhizome is an 'unimaginable globality'.10 You can't negate it, depict it or stare it straight in the eye. In terms of a traditional aesthetic category to which the rhizomatic lends itself, every node that comprises it is a potential sublime because it is a site of multiple, perhaps infinite, connections and becomings. And so it must be speculated upon, conjured up, acted out.  

These factors contribute to the ineffable sovereignty of the Net as a highly adaptable, half-intelligent infrastructure for processes of economic abstraction particular to our time, as discussed in the third section, Exchange is the Oxygen of Capital. John Baldessari's work The Best Way to do Art (1971) - a text laconically accompanied by a photo of a jumbo jet in which one imagines the artist finding himself, or wishing to be - suggests, in this context, that networks carry mobility, and that mobility itself has become a producer of symbolic value; this type of mediation is what Toni Negri and Michael Hardt term 'network production'.  

Particularly germane to this discussion is how globalization's pervasive exchangeability produces de-differentiation. This can be described as an inflation in determinate qualities that nibbles away at characteristic differences; the difference between ideologies, between public and private space, citizen and consumer, government and economy, work and social life, human and nonhuman, being connected and being alone, individualism and dissipated being, and so on. Subjectivity is no longer perceived in terms of autonomy, as the result of a clear dialectic between self and world. We don't become somebody by choosing, as in existentialism, or through direct action, as in Marxism, or by balancing the ego and the unconscious, as in psychoanalysis; but - for better or worse, and in a sense more vulnerably - by being exposed to something outside of ourselves, by feeling out attractions and tensions, ceaselessly connecting and reconnecting, navigating flows and synching in with rhythms and intensities. It can be argued that the rise of the Net has been accompanied by - or provoked? - a paradigm shift from a dialectical understanding of history as struggles between incompatible forces, to a cybernetic understanding in which history plays out inside networks according to infra-systemic parameters.  

Such de-differentiation isn't totalitarian in the twentieth-century sense that phenomena are mechanically reduced through top-down domination by a political or symbolic power that forces its organization on all expression. To a disenchanted view, however, society has become no less total. Gilles Deleuze famously wrote in his essay ‘Postscript on the Societies of Control, about the mutational capacity of apparatuses of control, that '... controls are a modulation, like a self-deforming cast that will continuously change from one moment to the other, or like a sieve whose mesh will transmute from point to point.'1 That is, a kind of mercurial homogenization where differences are liquidated through theirmobilizationinformsofcircularcontrol.  

For Marx, to be alienated from one's labour is to be cut off from itsvalue and products, and ultimately one's very essence as a human being. In a networked world, however, one could argue that we are ambiguously estranged through a connectivity that separates us even further from society, nature, production and our humanity in their known forms. The means of production are at our fingertips and yet no direct action is possible, because agency is anticipated and mediated: our networked being is, as it were, ahead of our humanity. Following a Marxist line of thought, then, connectivity disconnects.  

This is a new figure of estrangement that works through separation and extreme proximity. How can you act, let alone hide, if your being is dissipated? It is probably the Lacanian concept of extimacy (extimité) that comes closest to articulating this predicament of being turned inside-out in networks. The extimate is an estrangement that exists in extreme proximity with yourself. It is that which is intimate to your Self, yet external to who you believe you are: illness, feelings of shame, powerlessness or impotence. Or, in the case of the network, that which surrounds and envelops us but whose alien circuitry is also deeply within our Selves.2 In networked economies you may meet yourself as your own limit: you are the weakest link because it is up to you to hold things together - not only in relation to the outside world, but also in your relation to your own capacity for exposing, performing and valorizing your Self. The idea of dissipated being not only concerns states of technological distraction in relation to one'senvironment, but also waysin which it is purposeful for one's professional and social life to entertain a splintered self-perception.  

Many discussions about networked life today revolve around discussions of the common good. To Negri and Hardt, the globalized Empire is networked by definition,yetthe Internetopens upthe possibility ofa'spontaneous communism', called into being by an increased commonality in the digitized multitude. Less lyrically, Boltanski and Chiapello state that in a networked world there is no reason to pose the question of justice:'..there is not even that co-presence in the same space which makes it possible, through simple comparison, to enquire into the relationship between the misery of some and the happiness of others'.13 In a crowd of scattered beings,it is not known between whom a scale of justice can be established. As Hannah Arendt had earlier pointed out, a common world can only survive to the extent that it appears in public, and the reality that the Internet re-wires is shot through with murkyconnections and dislocations.As a unique mediator through which everyone and everything relates to everything else,it is the One into which the many can be subsumed.14 According to Arendt, 'the end of the common world has come when it is seen only under one aspect and is permitted to present itself in only one perspective.?'5  

From underground resistance to corporate oligarchy, the organization of life in networks produces a space for the shady social formations that headline section four,Corruption, Intrigue and Covert Solidarity.This last section deals with the occult potential of connectivity. An occult connection is external, not intrinsic or ‘'necessary' - this is why it is exchangeable and transmissible, open to empiricism and chance. Consider the grid: the grid epitomized modernism, as the interior space of reason, planning and representation. The network, on the other hand, is grid-like but also a flexible and plastic space of conjecture and proliferating connections. In other words, historical examples of networked forms of organization typically escaped modernist schemata of representation. This recondite potential has prompted artists to look outside modernity's mainstream - to hermetic traditions (Lea Porsager, Arturas Raila) and antiauthoritarian experiments (Colectivo Situaciones, Hakim Bey, Critical Art Ensemble) - for forms which can critically mirror, or dramatize and re-employ, the shadowy sovereignty of networks and how history can be rewritten through them. In Suzanne Treister's semi-fictional text ‘Networks in Reverse', time implodes as the history of the Internet is rewound; the fact that Google deletes the entire known Web from its database has not a little to do with this.  

In one of his fragments, Theodor Adorno wrote with prophetic pessimism about 'all these nervous people' who instrumentalize their personal life until 'there is no relationship that is not seen as a“connection", and who censor their impulses according to what is acceptable in their networks. Astonishingly, Adorno wrote these lines in 1951. For good reasons he wasn't referring to social media - even though his remark that‘the savage spread of the social under the mask of universal nature' makes you think he had a premonition - but to the mimeograph, as‘the only fitting, the unobtrusive means of dissemination.'16 For those who don't remember, a mimeograph is a hand-operated stencil duplicator that was used to make copies before photocopiers were introduced. No doubt Adorno'sicyanalysisoverlooksthenetwork'spotentialforcounter-power.On the other hand his brilliant disillusion can serve as an antidote against the naiveté that tinges theories of the non-hierarchical nature of rhizomatic structures.  

Even if the reality described by networks is as global as ever, the Net is arguably a product of twentieth-century post-industrialism. Mechanistic and electrical, it sounds like something that humans have planned, built and turned on. No doubt our liquid modernity will soon begin to appeal to other notions of digital connectivity; concepts of fluidity that will more aptly accommodate the seamlessness of wireless communication, the plasmatic vitality of touchscreen technologies andaworld shapedbytheebb and flow of semi-autonomous modulations. As it turns into an ocean or a cloud, into magma, The Net will become as obsolete as the mimeograph is today.

[... I There is always a point at which, as Sigmund Freud admits, ‘our material - for some incomprehensible reason - becomes far more obscure and full of gaps'1 And, as it happens, Freud's weaving women² had made rather more than a small and debatable contribution to his great narrative of inventions and discoveries. Far more than a big and certain one as well. It is their micro-processes which underlie it all: the spindle and the wheel used in spinning yarn are the basis of all later axles, wheels and rotations; the interlaced threads of the loom compose the most abstract processes of fabrication. Textiles themselves are very literally the softwares linings of all technology.  

String, which has been dated to 20,ooo BCE, is thought to be the earliest manufactured thread and crucial to ‘taking the world to human will and ingenuity', not least because it is such multipurpose material. It can be used for carrying, holding, tying and trapping, and has even been described as 'the unseen weapon that allowed the human race to conquer the earth'. Textiles underlie the great canvases of Western art, and even the materials of writing. Paper now tends to be made from wood, but it too was woven in its early form, produced from the dense interlacing of natural fibres. The Chinese, with whom the production of paper is thought to have begun some 2,ooo years ago, used bamboo, rags and old fishing nets as their basic materials; papyrus, from which the word paper is itself derived, was used in ancient Egypt, and later Arab cultures used the same flax from which linen is produced. Wood pulp gradually took over from the rags which Europe used until the nineteenth century, and most paper is now produced from fibres which are pulped and bleached, washed and dried, and then filtered onto a mesh and compressed into a fine felt.  

Evidence of sophisticated textile production dates to 6,ooo BCE in the southeast regions of Europe, and in Hungary there is evidence that warpweighted looms were producing designs of extraordinary extravagance from at least 5,0oo BCE. Archaeological investigations suggest that from at least the fourth millennium BCE Egyptian women were weaving linen on horizontal looms, sometimes with some two hundred threads per inch, and capable of producing cloths as wide as nine feet and seventy-five feet long. Circular warps, facilitating the production of seamless tubes for clothing, and tapestry looms, able to weave the dense complications of images visiblein weft threads so closely woven to completely conceal the warps, were also in use in ancient Egypt where, long before individual artisans stamped their work with their own signatures, trademarks and logoswerewoven into indicate theworkshop in which cloths had been produced. Cloths were used as early currency, and fine linens were as valuable as precious metals and stones. In China, where the spinning wheel is thoughtto have first turned, sophisticated drawlooms had woven designs which used thousands of different warps at least two and a half thousand years before such machines were developed in the West.  

It may be a bare necessity of life, but textiles work always goes far beyond the clothing and shelter of the family. In terms of quality, sophistication and sheer quantity, the production of textiles always seems to put some kind of surplus in play. The production of ‘homespun' yarn and cloth was one of the first cottage industries, pin money was women's earliest source of independent cash, and womenweresellingsurplusyarnandclothandworkingassmall-scale entrepreneurs long before the emergence of factories, organized patterns of trade, and any of the mechanisms which now define the textiles industry. Even when cloths and clothes can be bought off the rack, women continue to absorb themselves in fibrous fabrications.  

There is an obsessive, addictive quality to the spinning of yarn and the weaving of cloth; a temptation to get fixated and locked in to processes which run away with themselves and those drawn into them. Even in cultures assumed to be subsistence economies, women who did only as much cooking, cleaning and childcare as was necessary tended to go into overdrive when it came to spinning and weaving cloth, producing far more than was required to clothe and furnish the family home. With time and raw materials on their hands, even 'Neolithic women were investing large amounts of extra time into their textile work, far beyond pure utility', suggesting that noteverything was hand to mouth. These prehistoric weavers seem to have produced cloths of extraordinary complexity,woven with ornate designs far in excess of the brute demand for simple cloth.And wherever this tendency toelaboration emerged,it fed into a continual exploration of new techniques of dyeing, colour combination, combing, spinning, and all the complications of weaving itself.  

Even in Europe there had been several early and sophisticated innovations. Drawlooms had been developed in the Middle Ages, and while manyof Leonardo da Vinci's 'machines for spinning, weaving, twisting hemp, trimming felt, and making needles' were never made, he certainly introduced the flyer and bobbin which brought tension control to the spinning wheel. Unlike 'the spinster using the older wheel', she now 'slackened her hold on the yarn to allow it to be wound ontothebobbin as itwasbeingtwisted'.  

It is often said that Leonardo's sixteenth-century work anticipated the industrial revolution 'in the sense that his “machines" (including tools, musical instruments and weapons) all aspired toward systemic automation'. But it was his intuition that textiles machines were 'more useful, profitable, and perfect than the printing press' which really placed him ahead of his time. If printing had spread across the modern world, textiles led the frantic industrialization of the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries.‘Like the most humble cultural assets, textiles incessantly moved about, took root in new regions ...' The first manufactory was a silk mill on an island in the Derwent near Derby built early in a century which also saw the introduction of the spinning jenny, the water frame, the spinning mule, the flying shuttle, the witches' loom, and the power loom. A spiral of “inventions in both spinning and weaving (interacting and mutually stimulating) had attracted capital, concentrated labour, increased output and swollen imports and exports'. This was cloth capitalism, a runaway process which quite literally changed the world. In the 1850s, it was said that if Providence had never planted the cotton shrub those majestic masses of men which stretch, like a living zone, through our central districts,would have felt no existence; and the magic pulse which has been felt ... in every department of national energy, our literature, our laws, our social condition, our political institutions, making us almost a new people, would never have been communicated'. Textiles had not merely changed the world: they seemed to have mutated its occupants well. 'Almost a new people ...''I was surprised at the place but more so at the people', wrote one commentator of Birmingham, the site of the first cotton-spinning mill. 'They were a species I had never seen'  

While the industrial revolution is supposed to have made the break between handheld tools and supervised machines, the handmade and the mass-produced, the introduction of technology to more primitive textiles techniques is both a break with the old ways and a continuation of the lines on which the women were already at work. Even before its mechanization, the loom was described as the‘most complex human engine of them all', not least because of the extent to which it 'reduced everything to simple actions: the alternate movement of the feet worked the pedals, raising half the threads of the warp and then the other, while the hands threw the shuttle carrying the thread of the woof. When John Heathcote, who patented a lacemaking machine just after Jacquard built his loom, first saw 'a woman working on a pillow, with so many bobbins that it seemed altogether a maze', his impression was that lace was a 'heap of chaotic material. In an attempt to unravel the mystery, he ‘drew a thread, which happened to draw for an inch or two longitudinally straight, then started off diagonally. The next drew out straight. Then others drew out in various directions. Out of four threads concurring to make a mesh, two passed one way, the third another and the fourth another still. But at length I found they were in fact used in an orderly manner ...' It was then a matter of producing 'a fabric which was an exact imitation of the thread movements of handmade lace'. This is both the ordering of chaos, and also how its networks replicate themselves.  

There were other spin-offs from textiles too. The weaving of complex designs demands far more than one pair of hands, and textiles production tends to be communal, sociable work allowing plenty of occasion for gossip and chat. Weaving was already multimedia: singing, chanting, telling stories, dancing and playing games as they work, spinsters, weavers and needle-workers were literally networkers as well. It seems that 'the women of prehistoric Europe gathered at one another's houses to spin, sew, weave and have fellowship'. Spinning yarns, fabricating fictions, fashioning fashions ... the textures of woven cloth functioned as means of communication and information storage long before anything was written down. ‘How do we know this? From the cloth itself' This is not only because, like writing and other visual arts, weaving is often ‘used to mark or announceinformation'and'a mnemonic deviceto record events and other data'. Textiles do communicate in terms of the images which appear on the right side of the cloth, but this is only the most superficial sense in which they process and store data. Because there is no difference between the process of weaving and the woven design, cloths persist as records of the processes which fed into their production: how many women worked on them, the techniques they used, the skills they employed. The visible pattern is integralto the process which produced it; the program and the pattern are continuous.  

Information can be stored in cloth by means of the meaningful messages and images which are later produced by the pen and the paintbrush, but data can also be woven in far more pragmatic and immediate ways. A piece of work so absorbing as cloth is saturated with the thoughts of the people who produced it, each of whom can flash straight back to whatever they were thinking as they worked. Like Proust's madeleine, it carries memories of an intensity which completely escapes the written word. Cloths were also woven'to “invoke magic" - to protect, to secure fertility and riches, to divine the future, perhaps even to curse', and in this sense the weaving of spells is far more than a metaphorical device. 'The weaver chose warp threads of red wool for her work, 24 spun one direction, 24 spun the other way. She divided the bunch spun one way into 3 sets of 8 and the other bunch into 4 sets of 6, and alternated them. All this is perhaps perfectly innocent, but ...'  

If the weaving of such magical spells gives priority to the process over the completion of a task, this tendency is implicit in the production of all textiles. Stripes and checks are among the most basic of coloured and textured designs which can be woven in. Both are implicit in the grids of the woven cloth itself. Slightly more complex, but equally integral to the basic web, are the lozenges, or diamonds, still common in weaves across the world. These open diamonds are said to indicate fertility and tend to decorate the aprons, skirts and belts which are themselves supposed to be the earliest forms of clothing. 'These lozenges, usually with little curly hooks around theedge,rather graphically, if schematically, represent a woman's vulva.'These images are quite unlike those which are later painted on the canvas or written on the page. The lozenge is emergent from the cloth, diagonal lines implicit in the grids of the weave. And even the most ornate and complex of woven designs retains this connection to the warps and wefts. When images are later painted, or written in the form of words on a page, patterns are imposed on the passive backdrop provided by the canvas or the page. But textile images are never imposed on the surface of the cloth: their patterns are always emergent from an active matrix, implicit in a web which makes them immanent to the processes from which they emerge.  

As the frantic activities of generations of spinsters and weaving women makes abundantly clear, nothing stops when a particular piece of work has been finished off. Even when magical connections are not explicitly invoked, the finished cloth, unlike the finished painting or the text, is almost incidental in relation to the processes of its production. The only incentive to cast off seems to be the chance completion provides to start again, throw another shuttle, cast another spell.  

As writing and other visual arts became the privileged bearers of memory and messages, weaving withdrew into its own screens. Both canvases and paper reduce the complexities of weaving to raw materials on which images and signs are imposed: the cloths from which woven patterns once emerged now become backcloths, passive matrices on which images are imposed and interpreted as if from on high. Images are no longer carried in the weave, but imprinted on its surface by the pens and brushes with which shuttles become superficial carriers of threads. Guided by the hand-eye coordinations of what are now their male creators, patterns become as individuated and unique as their artists and authors. And whereas the weave was once both the process and the product, the woven stuff, images are now separated out from matrices to which they had been immanent. The artist sees only the surface of a web which is covered as he works; the paper on which authors now look down has no say in the writing it supports.  

The processes themselves become dematerialized as myths, legends and metaphors.Ariadne's thread, and the famous contest in which the divine Athena tore mortal Arachne's weaving to shreds, are among the many mythical associations between women and webs, spinsters and spiders, spinning yarns and storylines. For the Greeks, the Fates, the Moirai, were three spinsters - Klotho, Lachesis and Atropos - who produced, allotted and broke the delicate contingency of the thread of life. In the folktales of Europe, spindles become magic wands, Fates become fairies, and women are abandoned or rescued from impossible spinning and weaving tasks by supernatural entities, godmothers and crones who transform piles of flax into fine linen by means more magical than weaving itself, as in Rumpelstiltskin', “The Three Spinsters', and 'The Sleeping Beauty'.  

European folktales are full of references to the making of magical garments, especially girdles, in which the magic seems to be inherent in the weaving, not merely in special decoration.'  

As for the fabrics which persist: evaluated in these visual terms, their checks and diagonals, diamonds and stripes become insignificant matters of repeating detail. This is why Freud had gazed at work which was so literally imperceptible to him. Struggling only to interpret the surface effects of [his daughter] Anna's work as though he was looking at a painting or a text, the process of weaving eluded him: out of sight, out of mind, out of his world.  

This was a process of disarmament which automation should have made complete. But if textiles appear to lose touch with their weaving spells and spans of time, they also continue to fabricate the very screens with which they are concealed. And because these are processes, they keep processing. ‘Behind the screen of representation', weaving wends its way through even the media which supplant it.While paper haslost its associations with the wovenfabrics with which it began, there are remnants of weaving in all writing: yarns continue to be spun, texts are still abbreviated textiles, and even grammar - glamour - and spelling retain an occult connectivity. Silkscreens, printing presses, stencils, photographic processes and typewriters: by the end of the nineteenth century images, texts and patterns of all kinds were being processed by machines which still used matrices as means to their ends, but also repeated the repeating patterns downgraded by the one-off work of art. And while all these modes of printing were taking technologies of representation to new heights, they were also moving on to the matrices of times in which these imprinting procedures would reconnect with the tactile depth of woven cloth.

# UmbertoEco The Encyclopaedia as Labyrinth//1984  

[...] There are three types of labyrinth. The first, the classical one, was linear. Theseus entering the labyrinth of Crete had no choices to make: he could not but reach the centre, and from the centre the way out. That is the reason by which at the centre there was the Minotaur, to make the whole thing a little more exciting. Such a labyrinth is ruled by a blind necessity. Structurally speaking, it is simpler than a tree: it is a skein, and, as one unwinds a skein, one obtains a continuous line. In this kind of labyrinth the Ariadne thread is useless, since one cannot get lost: the labyrinth itself is an Ariadne thread. This kind of labyrinth has nothing to do with an encyclopaedia, irrespective of its important and venerable symbolic meanings.  

The second type is called in German Irrgarten or Irrweg; a good English term for it is maze. The maze is a Manneristic invention; iconologically speaking, it does not appear before the late Renaissance. A maze displays choices between alternative paths, and some of the paths are dead ends. In a maze one can make mistakes. If one unwinds a maze, one gets a particular kind of tree in which certain choices are privileged in respect to others. Some alternatives end at a point where one is obliged to return backwards, whereas others generate new branches, and only one among them leads to the way out. In this kind of labyrinth, one does need an Ariadne thread; otherwise, one might spend one's life in turning around by repeating the same moves. [...] A maze does not need a Minotaur: it is its own Minotaur: in other words, the Minotaur is the visitor's trial-and-error process.  

In a labyrinth of the third type is a net ( maybe the word meander characterizes it as different from a maze and from a plain labyrinth). The main feature of a net is that every point can be connected with every other point, and, where the connections are not yet designed, they are, however, conceivable and designable. A net is an unlimited territory. A net is not a tree. The territory of the United States does not oblige anybody to reach Dallas from New York by passing through St Louis, Missouri; one can also pass through New Orleans. A net - as Pierre Rosenstiehl (Paris-Pékin par le transsiberien, 1980) suggests - is a tree plus corridors connecting its nodes so as to transform the tree into a polygon, or into a system of embedded polygons. But this comparison is still misleading: a polygon has some borderlines. On the contrary, the abstract model of a net has neither acentre nor an outside.  

The best image of a net is provided by the vegetable metaphor of the rhizome suggested by Deleuze and Guattari (Rhizome, 1976). A rhizome is a tangle of bulbs and tubers appearing like ‘rats squirming one on top of the other. The characteristics of a rhizomatic structure are the following: (a) Every point of the rhizome can and must be connected with every other point. (b) There are no points or positions in a rhizome; there are only lines (this feature is doubtful: intersecting lines make points). (c) A rhizome can be broken off at any point and reconnected following one of its own lines. (d) The rhizome is anti-genealogical (e) The rhizome has its own outside with which it makes another rhizome; therefore,arhizomaticwholehasneitheroutsidenorinside.(f)Arhizomeisnot a calque but an open chart which can be connected with something else in all of its dimensions; it is dismountable, reversible and susceptible to continual modifications. (g) A network of trees which open in every direction can create a rhizome (which seems to us equivalent to saying that a network of partial trees can be cut out artificially in every rhizome). (h) No one can provide a global description of the whole rhizome; not only because the rhizome is multidimensionally complicated, but also because its structure changes through time; moreover, in a structure in which every node can be connected with every other node, there is also the possibility of contradictory inferences: if $p$ then any possible consequence of $p$ is possible, including the one that, instead of leading to new consequences, leads again to $p$ , so that it is true at the same time both that if $p$ , then $q$ and that if $p$ , then non-q. (i) A structure that cannot be described globally can only be described as a potential sum of local descriptions. (j) In a structure without outside, the describers can look at it only by the inside; as Rosenstiehl suggests, a labyrinth of this kind is a myopic algorithm; at every node of it no one can have the global vision of all its possibilities but only the local vision of the closest ones: every local description of the net is a hypothesis, subject to falsification, about its further course; in a rhizome blindness is the only way of seeing (locally), and thinking means to grope one's way. This is the type of labyrinth we are interested in. This represents a model (a Model Q) for an encyclopaedia as a regulative semiotic hypothesis. [...]  

# Robert Musil The Man without Qualities//1930-43  

[..] The fact is, living permanently in a well-ordered State has an out-and-out spectral aspect: one cannot step into the street or drink a glass of water or get into a tram without touching the perfectly balanced levers of a gigantic apparatus of laws and relations, setting them in motion or letting them maintain one in the peace and quiet of one's existence. One knows hardly any of these levers, which extend deep into the inner workings and on the other side are lost in a network the entire constitution of which has never been disentangled by any living being. Hence one denies their existence, just as the common man denies the existence of the air, insisting that it is mere emptiness; but it seems that precisely this is what lends life a certain spectral quality - the fact that everything that is denied reality, everything that is colourless, odourless, tasteless, imponderable and nonmoral, like water, air, space, money and the passing of time, is in reality what is most important. Man is at times seized with panic as in the helplessness of dream, by a gale of movement, wildly lashing out like an animal that has got into the incomprehensible mechanism of a net. [...]

# Craig Saper Networked Art//2001  

[...] The Oxford English Dictionary's definitions and usage history of the term network suggest two contexts: mass-media networks and management terminology. The citations to business all suggest that the term took on its cybernetic connotations around 1957. The copious usage history of the term does not include artists' networks, and neither mail art nor correspondence art appear anywhere.[...]  

Joseph Beuys used the term soziales Plastik [social sculpture] to describe the process of addressing social issues using art strategies. This social art paradoxically advocates both an extreme individualism and a collective internationalism, employing both artisanal and mass-production techniques. This paradoxical motivation, production and distribution form the basis for an intimate bureaucracy: they create intimate aesthetic situations by using all the trappings of bureaucratic procedures. Often these situations produce networks of insiders who share idiosyncratic code systems. One usually thinks of intimacy as the opposite of objectification, procedural utility and bureaucratic manipulation. The poetic practices of assemblings inherently offer alternatives tothe preconceived opposition betweenthe artisanal village andthe mechanized global society. [...]  

A well-known work that captures the intimacy of an event is Daniel Spoerri's An Anecdoted Topography of Chance (1962/1995). This artist's book, originally in French, with revised versions later produced in English and German, presents photographs of the remains of a meal (which Spoerri glued to his table) accompanied by anecdotes about each object. The anecdotes appear in footnote form, and the book looks like an ethnographer's notebook on Spoerri's life. In the later English-language edition subtitled re-anecdoted version, Emmett Williams offers his own anecdotes for each of the photographs. He reads the images according to his reveries and intimate recollections while staying alone in Spoerri's apartment. Both books are linked to Spoerri's and Williams' networks, through their connections to Fluxus.  

Spoerri was also a member of the Nouveaux Réalistes [...]. Beginning in the mid 1950s, these artists became interested in systems, especially postal systems. Yves Klein's Timbre bleu (1957-59), a fake blue postage stamp, created a scandal among post office bureaucrats after it was successfully mailed and postmarked. Arman started using early twentieth-century rubber stamps in his work, and it was with the work of the Nouveaux Réalistes that artists began to play with the postal system and other forms of bureaucracy as parts of everyday life. They sought to project intimacy onto otherwise impersonal systems. They also used a graphic sculptural poetry rather than one closely connected to the voice, and by moving away from the voice they recast intimacy and opened the way for future artists to appropriate logos, corporate names, mailing lists and distribution systems.  

Intimate bureaucracies monitor the pulse of the society of the spectacle and the corporatized bureaucracies: economics, as in big business; culture, as in museumsand artmarkets; massmedia,as in studiosystems and telecommunication networks; and politics, as in ‘big government'. Rather than simply mounting a campaign against big conglomerations of business, government and culture, these artists' networks and their publications use theforms of corporate bureaucracies for intimate ends. Rather than reach the lowest common denominator, they seek to construct what those in the business world would call niche marketing to specific demographics. Ironically, the model these artists developed has now become the new mantra of businesses interested in utilizing the World Wide Web and the Internet, as these technologies allow for very specific niche marketing. It is the very system of the new business model used in Internet marketing that these artists' networks explored, emulated and resisted.  

The apparent oxymoron intimatebureaucraciessuggests not only astrategyof artists' networks and their published periodic compilations, but the very basis for the new productive mythology surrounding the Internet. Electronic networks combine a bureaucracy, with its codes, passwords, links and so on, with niche marketing, intimate personal contacts and the like, creating a hybrid situation, or performance. This is not merely business performance masquerading as performance art, not only performance art mocking business, but the emergence of an alternative politics. [...]  

Intimatebureaucracies,whoseworksarebetterunderstoodinterms of processes, procedures, systems and situations, stage a possibility - actualized rather than utopian - of combining two apparently opposite tendencies in Western culture. These artists' networks, and their conglomerated periodicals, stress the collective production process, playing with (rather than rejecting) the trappings and procedures of large institutional bureaucracies, corporate aliases and the centralized efficiency and money-saving process of collecting the pieces of the assemblage and then sending it out. It is the Federal Express process in miniature: all the packages are shipped to one central location and then are sent outtotheirvariousdestinations.  

The ‘finished' product of the periodical as an artwork is not merely a documentation of a closed collective art experiment; it is a provocation for further experimentation. The democratic spirit exists in the infinite potentialof distributing these periodicals to future audiences. For example, in the premiere issue of Running Dog One and Done (1976), a letter from the editor, Michael Crane, explains, “The attempt of this publication is to present the documents of the experiments and explorations artists are undertaking today on an international level: Crane goes on to justify the publication's unbound pages by explaining that ‘the readers can recycle the pages within their own information systems'. The title of this assembling also contains an ironic allusion to Mao's condemnation of capitalist entrepreneurs as ‘running dogs'. The premiere issue is packaged in a portfolio with a silhouette reproduction of Eadweard Muybridge's Greyhound Running (1879) on the cover. The introduction and cover art point to a desire among participants to encourage and facilitate sharing by creating a venue in which artists can experiment rather than showcase finished work. These publications have an ‘in-process' feel, and when art is understood as an experiment rather than the making of a masterpiece, the gallery system loses its competitive edge over faster distribution systems. The works on the artists' networks seek to challenge both the gallery system and the corporatized world in which art is now marketed and distributed. [...]

# Marta Minujin Simultaneity in Simultaneity (1966)//2004  

In April 1966, Marta Minujin of Argentina, Wolf Vostell of Germany and Allan Kaprow of the United States came up with the idea of creating three different events simultaneously in their three respective countries.  

Part of Vostell, Kaprow and Minujin's Happenings would take place at the same time, on the same day; in other words, in addition to creating his or her own Happening, each one would perform part of the activities of the Happenings of the other artists.  

Specifically, it was set for Monday 24 October at midnight, the signal of a change in the environment here in Buenos Aires. Part of the Happenings of Kaprow and Vostell plus the instantaneous invasion by Marta Minujin would be aired jointly on [Argentina's] Channel 13.  

Radio Municipal and Radio Libertad would broadcast ten minutes during whichyou couldhear thevoicesof KaprowandVostell listingthe alternatives of the simultaneous Happening, plus the text read by Marta Minujin, to some degree linked to the mute images of what could be seen on television.  

The Happening created by Marta Minujin, with the collaboration of Leopoldo Maler, which took place at the Instituto Oi Tella was called Simultaneity in Simultaneity.  

Two Happenings were created, simultaneously, of course:  

1) Instantaneous Invasion (radio, TV, telephone, telegram) consisting of a tenkm-minute broadcast on 'University on the Air' (Channel 13 TV), and another ten minutes on Radio Libertad, simultaneously with Radio Excelsior.  

This Happening, to be performed on Monday 24 October, would take place at the same time in Berlin and New York. Wolf Vostell in Berlin and Allan Kaprow in New York would receive instructions from Marta Minujin by radiophone at the same time that both would give instructions to Marta Minujin over the same medium for her to perform her Happening.  

Previously, one thousand people who live alone had been identified, and they would be in their respective houses at the time of the broadcast; they would be 'the invaded'. In addition, all of them had been photographed, filmed, and had their voices recorded to be included in the broadcast.  

Let us now see what would happen on day D at time T:  

'He' knows that something is going to happen, turns on the TV, and settles down to see the Happening; immediately Marta Minujin appears, talking to him and telling him that the radio must be tuned in for him to find the text related to each image. Each image has a number, and he has to change stations in accordance with the number (for example image 1 is Radio Libertad and image 2 Radio Excelsior). Meanwhile someone calls him on the phone and at the same time he receives a telegram, so that for ten minutes he is a prisoner of the media, with his radio in his hand and the TV turned on, answering the phone and receiving telegrams. And the Happening is over.  

2) Surrounded by Simultaneity (TVs and radios for each of the people participating in the Happening at the Instituto Torcuato Oi Tella, slides, movies, photographs,recorders).  

a) Preliminary phase on Thursday 13 October beginning at $7{:}00~\mathrm{pm}$ ：sixty invited participants enter the audiovisual room at the Institute,where there are sixty TVs and sixty portable radios ready for each one. While they are finding their places, their voices and sounds - as they give their impressions - are recorded, and they are filmed and photographed in various positions. Then they are instructed to leave, and once again they are filmed and photographed.  

b) Performance phase on Monday 24 October at midnight: the same people who attended the preliminary phase enter the Institute, wearing the same clothes they had on before. On the screen in front, they see themselves, finding their places as they did the time before, while slides are projected on the walls that show them from front and side views. On the stage screen they can see themselves entering and sitting down. Each participant is seated in front of a television and is given a radio. On the television, they can watch the instantaneous invasion. Meanwhile, they can tune in on their portable radios to the stations whose initials appear on the television screens. In this way, a double situation is created in which the participants will see themselves reflected in the hall and on the television receivers. The end of the Happening coincides with the conclusion of the special programme on the TV and on the radios. When they get up from their armchairs to leave, the action is repeated, projected on the stage screen. The End. [...]  

Twenty-four hours before the night of Thursday 13 October 1966, telephone calls were made to the sixty people who participated in Surrounded by Simultaneity, the first part of the Happening created by Marta Minujin.  

The sixty people chosen among journalists, reporters and press staff were in this case the ones to be photographed and reported on; every one of their steps, gestures and movements was detected by seventeen photographers located around the hall, and their voices were captured by several tape recorders. The remaining people came from television, radio, the movies, universities, workers and executives.  

These sixty people, occupying every other seat each, with a television in front of them and a radio in one of their hands, were filmed entering and finding their seats from in front and in profile, standing and exiting.  

To do this, they had to wait two and a half hours, which led to fatigue, dissatisfaction and boredom.  

Some of the participants who knew each other moved around in tight groups; others absorbed in the television were hoping that something would happen; there were meetings, psychiatric consultations, and the desire to leave.  

At $10{:}00~\mathrm{pm}$ , total impatience prevailed and they began to leave, for which reason it was necessary to cut the filming to half of what was planned and to pressure them to have photographs done one by one in profile, marking out six paces against the lateral walls of the hall.  

By 10:30, no one remained in the hall; the material obtained was very limited, the recorded sounds confused, and both slides and filming showed the rushed situation.  

Therefore, Surrounded by Simultaneity was transformed into something else, and sixty more people were allowed to enter the hall.  

[The work was accompanied by the following text (1966), first published as 'Simultaneidad in Simultaneidad', in Oscar Masotta, et al., Happenings (Buenos Aires: Editorial Jorge Alvarez, 1967); trans. Eileen Brockbank.]  

On October 24, 1966, from midnight to $12{:}10~\mathrm{am}$ ,these activities will be executed simultaneously in New York, Buenos Aires and Berlin.  

The activities may be acted out by anyone who wants to, at the same time in each city.

# Marshall McLuhan The Medium is the Massage//1967  

[... Ours is a brand-new world of all-at-onceness. Time' has ceased, 'space' has vanished. We now live in a global village ... a simultaneous happening. We are back in acoustic space. We have begun again to structure the primordial feeling, the tribal emotions from which a few centuries of literacy divorced us.  

We have had to shift our stress of attention from action to reaction.We must now know in advance the consequences of any policy or action, since the results are experienced without delay. Because of electric speed,we can no longer wait and see. [...]  

At the high speeds of electric communication, purely visual means of apprehending the world are no longer possible; they are just too slow to be relevantoreffective.  

Unhappily, we confront this new situation with an enormous backlog of outdated mental and psychological responses. We have been left d-a-n-g-l-i-n-g. Our most impressive words and thoughts betray us - they refer us only to the past, not to the present.  

Electric circuitry profoundly involves men with one another. Information pours upon us, instantaneously and continuously. As soon as information is acquired, it is very rapidly replaced by still newer information. Our electricallyconfigured world has forced us to move from the habit of data classification to the mode of pattern recognition. We can no longer build serially, block-by-block, step-by-step, because instant communication ensures that all factors of the environment and of experience coexist in a state of active interplay. [...]  

Despite its brilliant material accomplishments in many fields of human endeavour, technology has failed to bring harmony to humanity's collective consciousness. The result is a widespread sense of frustration - particularly painfulprecisely because today most human activity is geared tothe technological. Technology has all but wiped out many of our traditional points of reference without adequately providing new ones. On one hand, numerous efforts are being made in the visual arts to bridge the gap between old forms and new possibilities offered by technology. Artists in the United States and Europe are studying the new media, believing that rapprochement and competent utilization of technology's advances can help to stem frustration while providing fresh, virtually unlimited resources for creation and discovery. The results, however, have been only partly successful and usually limited to groups with access to the media plus financial backing for experimental work. Paradoxically, while the influence of technology spreads, the participation it offers to underdeveloped communities diminishes. In general, art-technology suffers from a lack of genuine integration, either because works remain superficial or because they are merely art applied to technology or viceversa. On the other hand,frustration has set off a violent rejection of the entire technological apparatus, its inroads into society and its subservience to political ambition. Generally speaking, the creative activity encouraged by artists who resent the yoke of technology is characterized at present by an absence of order. There is a conscientious rejection of structure as an aesthetic component. Moreover, aesthetics itself is dismissed in favour of a creative process conducted within the social scene, with obvious political overtones. There is, I believe, a third alternative to the crisis. It is a creative vein pursued by those artists who are neither lured by technology and its gadgets nor prepared to bury it. Theycontinue to believethat to accept an absence of structure - in art and in life - is to resign oneself to the view that destruction, after all, is anoverwhelmingforce,andthatthereforethosewhowooitnegatelife.  

Gego is such an artist. Her entire creative life has been dedicated to a search for essence, or to put it another way, for the structure underlying all vital elements in our universe. She remains faithful to familiar elements such as line and metal, assured that they are still valid in the discovery of untapped visual experiences. What's more, she relishes the simple pleasure of working with humble materials. Her insistence on line and its capacity to forge a clear language of fresh and unlimited dimensions is one of the most admirable commitments in current  

Venezuelan art. Line is the common denominator of all her work - prints, drawings and sculpture. The line is her compass to space. Tenor, modulation, length and character are varied accordingly, freely, as if applied in swift brushstrokes (in her small works, such as the wire sculptures of 1965 and 1967), or in rigorous disposition which strengthens the pure, geometric character of her larger pieces, in which the demands of scale impose calculation and design (as in the iron construction series of 1960, 1961 and 1965).  

From the outset of her sculptural work some ten years ago, Gego has posed, alternately, several problems which she now brings to a successful synthesis in her environmental work Reticularea: concern for structure and virtual volume as rendered by line, without formal obeisance to functional supporting elements; multiplicity of vision and weightlessness as provided by transparency; and the suggestion of subtle movement in space without resorting to moire effects.  

Walking into Reticularea as it was arranged in Caracas' Museo de Bellas Artes is like entering the domain of a friendly giant spider. A web-like wire structure extends over ceiling and walls, cascading down at some points into the space/ room or shrinking back into the corners.  

Primary units - something like the building blocks of organic reticula - play out a game of multiplication in space, as vital as cells in a living organism and as ephemeral as magic. Large in scale (limited only by the size of the room in which it is placed), Reticularea combines the grace of Gego's small works with the clarity and substance of her large pieces. Intimacy, nuance and expressive directness, so often dissipated when models are blown up to outdoor scale, remain. As an environmental work, moreover, it is equally successful, for it imparts to viewers the sensation that they are physically involved in what their eyes focus upon.  

Like most of her sculpture, Reticularea is an outgrowth of drawing, to which Gego returns after each foray in three dimensions. It is in the intimacy and directness of drawing that she replenishes ideas and finds new energy. And if Reticularea, more than her other sculpture, is closer to drawing, it is because the process of construction is similar to drawing, without the limitations of paper.  

Line in her drawings and sculpture had until now pursued parallel paths, either horizontal or vertical rhythms. Early this year, however, her line, on paper, took on an entirely different character: it became radial, it traced triangles, hexagons. The step into spaces was made with linear elements such as florist's and stainless steel wire - clipped to manageable lengths - with which she could draw freely in space, delineating volume without confining it.  

Reticularea's formal origins can be traced to Alexander Calder's early wire sculptures as well as to Buckminster Fuller's constructive design for the geodesic dome. Yet it is neither descriptive, though it evokes the real, nor systematic, though it adheres to a unif ying underlying system. Despite its irregularity and its contrast of pure,spaced-out forms of single lines with the intricacy of overlapping clusters, the sensation of free order prevails.  

An indoor work with an outdoor scale, Reticularea evokes the living, whether by a cellular or molecular suggestion. It works on the viewer, eliciting his attention. Visually, it defines space as indefinite, flowing, unlimited. It is both friendly and forbidding, related alike to man-made structures and to structures of nature and the universe. And though frankly open and direct, easily decipherable in formal terms, it still baffles like the distant stars, glimmering and elusive.  

[...] We are now in transition from an object-oriented to a systems-oriented culture. Here change emanates, not from things, but from the way things are done. The priorities of the present age revolve around the problems of organization. A systems viewpoint is focused on the creation of stable, ongoing relationships between organic and non-organic systems, be these neighbourhoods, industrial complexes, farms, transportation systems, information centres, recreation centres, or any of the other matrices of human activity. All living situations must be treated in the context of a systems hierarchy of values. Intuitively many artists have already grasped these relatively recent distinctions, and if their 'environments' are on the unsophisticated side, this will change with time and experience. [...]  

Situated between aggressive electronic media and two hundred years of industrial vandalism, the long held idea that a tiny output of art objects could somehow “beautify' or even significantly modify the environment was naive. A parallel illusion existed, in that artistic influence prevails by a psychic osmosis given off by such objects.Accordingly lip service to public beauty remains the province of well-guarded museums. Through the early stages of industrialism it remained possible for decorative media, including painting and sculpture, to embody the aesthetic impulse; but as technology progresses this impulse must identify itself with the means of research and production. Obviously nothing could be less true for the present situation. In a society thus estranged only the didactic function of art continues to have meaning. The artist operates as a quasi-political provocateur, though in no concrete sense is he an ideologist or a moralist. L'art pour I'art and a century's resistance to the vulgarities of moral uplift have ensured that.  

The specific function of modern didactic art has been to show that art does not reside in material entities, but in relations between people and between people and the components of their environment. This accounts for the radicality of Marcel Duchamp and his enduring influence. It throws light on Pablo Picasso's lesser position as a seminal force. As with all succeeding formalist art, Cubism followed the tradition of circumscribing art value wholly within finite objects.  

In an advanced technological culture the most important artist best succeeds by liquidating his position as artist vis-a-vis society. Artistic nihilism established itself through this condition. At the outset the artist refused to participate in idealism through craft. ‘Craft-fetishism', as termed by the critic Christopher Caudwell, remains the basis of modern formalism. Instead the significant artist strives to reduce thetechnicaland psychical distance between his artistic output and the productive means of society. Duchamp, Andy Warhol and Robert Morris are similarly directed in this respect. Gradually this strategy transforms artistic and technological decision-making into a single activity - at least it presents that alternative in inescapable terms. Scientists and technicians are not converted into‘artists', rather the artist becomes a symptom of the schism between art and technics.  

Progressively the need to make ultrasensitive judgements as to the uses of technology and scientific information becomes 'art' in the most literal sense. As yet the implication that art contains survival value is nearly as suspect as attaching any moral significance to it. Though with the demise of literary content, the theory that art is a form of psychic preparedness has gained articulate supporters.  

Art, as an adaptive mechanism, is reinforcement of the ability to be aware of the disparity between behavioural pattern and the demands consequent upon the interaction with the environment. Art is rehearsal for those real situations in which it is vital for our survival to endure cognitive tension, to refuse the comforts of validation by affective congruence when such validation is inappropriate because too vital interests are at stake ...  

The post-formalist sensibility naturally responds to stimuli both within and outside the proposed art format. To this extent some of it does begin to resemble 'theatre', as imputed by Michael Fried [in 'Art and Objecthood', 1967]. More likely though, the label of theatricality is a red herring disguising the real nature of the shift in priorities. In respect to Fried's argument, the theatre was never a purist medium, but a conglomerate of arts. In itself this never prevented the theatre from achieving ‘high art'. For clearer reading, rather than maintaining Mr Fried's adjectives, theatrical or literalist art, or the phrase used until now in this essay, post-formalist aesthetic, the term systems aesthetic seems to encompass the present situation more fully.  

The systems approach goes beyond a concern with staged environments and happenings; itdeals in a revolutionary fashion with the largerproblemof boundary concepts. In systems perspective there are no contrived confines such as the theatre proscenium or picture frame. Conceptual focus rather than material limits define the system. Thus any situation, either in or outside the context of art, may be designed and judged as a system. In as much as a system may contain people, ideas, messages, atmospheric conditions, power sources, and so on, a system is, to quote the systems biologist, Ludwig von Bertalanffy, a ‘complex of components in interaction, comprised of material, energy and information in various degrees of organization. In evaluating systems the artist is a perspectivist considering goals, boundaries, structure, input, output and related activity inside and outside the system. Where the object almost always has a fixed shape and boundaries, the consistency of a system may be altered in time and space, its behaviour determined both by external conditions and its mechanisms of control.  

In his book The New Vision (1938), Moholy-Nagy described fabricating a set of enamel-on-metal paintings. These were executed by telephoning precise instructions to a manufacturer. An elaboration of this was projected recently by the director of the Museum of Contemporary Art in Chicago, Jan van der Marck, in a tentative exhibition, ‘Art by Telephone. In this instance the recorded conversation between artist and manufacturer was to become part of the displayed work of art. For systems, information, in whatever form conveyed, becomes a viableaestheticconsideration.  

Fifteen years ago Victor Vasarely suggested mass art as a legitimate function of industrial society. For angry critics there existed the fear of undermining art's fetish aura, of shattering the mystique of craft and private creation. If some forays have been made into serially produced art, these remain on the periphery of the industrial system. Yet the entire phenomenon of reproducing an art object ad infinitum is absurd; rather than making quality available to a large number of people, it signals the end of concrete objects embodying visual metaphor. Such demythification is the Kantian Imperative applied aesthetically. On the other hand, a system aesthetic is literal, in that all phases of the life cycle of a system are relevant. There is no end product that is primarily visual, nor does such an aesthetic rely on a 'visual' syntax. It resists functioning as an applied aesthetic, but is revealed in the principles underlying the progressive reorganization of the natural environment. [...]  

Methodologically, Les Levine is possibly the most consistent exponent of a systems aesthetic. His environments of vacuum-formed, modular plastic units are never static; by means of experiencing ambulation through them, they consistently alter their own degree of space-surface penetrability. Levine's Clean Machine (1968) has no ideal vantage points, no ‘pieces' to recognize, as are implicit in formalist art. One is processed as in driving through the Holland Tunnel. Certainly this echoes Michael Fried's reference to Tony Smith's night time drive along the uncompleted New Jersey Turnpike. Yet if this is theatre, as Fried insists, it is not the stage concerned with focused-upon events. That has more to do with the boundary definitions that have traditionally circumscribed classical and post-classical art. In a recent environment by Levine rows of live electric wires emitted small shocks to passers-by. Here behaviour is controlled in an aesthetic situation with noprimaryreference to visualcircumstances.As Levine insists, 'What I am after here is physical reaction, not visual concern' [...]  

Formalist art embodies the idea of deterministic relations between a composition's visible elements. But since the early 1960s Hans Haacke has depended upon the invisible components of systems. In a systems context, invisibility, or invisible parts, share equal importance with things seen. Thus air, water, steam and ice have become major elements in his work. [...]  

Haacke's systems have a limited life as an art experience, though some are quite durable. He insists that the need for empathy does not make his work function as with older art. Systems exist as ongoing independent entities away from the viewer. In the systems hierarchy of control, interaction and autonomy become desirable values.In this respect Haacke's Photo-Electric Viewer Programmed Coordinate System (1968), is probably one of the most elegant, responsive environments made to date by an artist(certainly more sophisticated ones have been conceived for scientific and technical purposes). Boundary situations are central to his thinking.  

A ‘sculpture’ that physically reacts to its environment is no longer to be regarded as an object. The range of outside factors affecting it, as well as its own radius of action, reach beyond the space it materially occupies. It thus merges with the environment in a relationship that is better understood as a'system'of interdependent processes. These processes evolve without the viewer's empathy. He becomes a witness. A system is not imagined, it is real.  

Tangential to this systems approach is Allan Kaprow's unique concept of the Happening. In the past ten years Kaprow has moved the Happening from a rather self-conscious and stagy event to a strict and elegant procedure. The Happening now has a sense of internal logic which was lacking before. It seems to arise naturally from those same considerations that have crystallized the systems approach to environmental situations. As described by their chief inventor, the Happenings establish an indivisibility between themselves and everyday affairs; they consciously avoid materials and procedures identified with art; they allow for geographical expansiveness and mobility; they include experience and duration as part of their aesthetic format; and they emphasize practical activities as the most meaningful mode of procedure...As structured events the Happenings are usually reversible. Alterations in the environment may be 'erased' after the Happening, or as a part of the Happening's conclusion. While they may involve large areas of place, the format of the Happening is kept relatively simple, with the emphasis on establishing a participatory aesthetic.  

The emergence of a 'post-formalist aesthetic' may seem to some to embody a kind of absolute philosophy, something which, through the nature of concerns, cannot be transcended. Yet it is more likely that a ‘systems aesthetic' will become the dominant approach to a maze of socio-technical conditions rooted only in the present. [..]  

# LawrenceAlloway Network: The Art World Described as a System//1972  

The first exhibition ofa newly made work of art is in the studio. This first audience of the artist's friends views the art in the workplace in which it was created, in the artist's presence and associated with the rest of his life. The satisfactions of his contact are obvious, both to the privileged group and to the artist in touch with his peers. The second exhibition, as a rule, is in an art gallery where it is seen by a larger but still specialized section of the public. (The average attendance at an art gallery during a show is rarely more than a thousand people.) From the gallery the work may be purchased by a collector, travel to other galleries or museums, or be actually acquired by a museum. Each change of milieu will encourage different expectations and readings by a changing audience. A fourth context is literary, the catalogues and magazines in which the work of art is no longer substantially present as an object, but is the subject of information.  

By this point in a work of art's distribution a description in stages is no longer sufficient; it has acquired a record, not simply in terms of places shown and changing hands but of the aura of aesthetic interpretation as well. It belongs in the context of the art world, with its special opportunities for comparison and meditation for analysis and pleasure. The density that a work accrues as it is circulated means that it acquires meanings not expected by the artist and quite unlike those ofthework'sinitial showingin the studio.Although wide distribution is the modern equivalent for the classical frame, there is an inbuilt alienating factor. Wide distribution can separate the work from the man who produced it as the variables of other people's readings pile up and characterize the object.  

This alienation by distribution effect is not to be avoided except by withdrawal from the art world, for art is now part of a communications network of great efficiency. As its capacity has increased, a progressive role-blurring has taken place. Before World War Il, for example, museums worked at a fixed distance from the art they exhibited, which was either of some age or could be regarded as the latest form of tradition of acknowledged historicity. Most American museums have abolished the time lag that previously regulated their policies and now present not only new work but new artists. Though on a different scale and with different motives, such activity connects intimately with private galleries, whose profits can be affected by museum shows of their artists. The Alan Solomon/Leo Castelli collaboration at the Jewish museum in the early 1960s, the Rauschenberg and Johns retrospectives, at the ages 38 and 34 respectively, is a remarkable example of the convergence of intellectual interest and high profits. Art historians prepare catalogues raisonne of living artists, so that organization of data is more or less level with their occurrence. Critics serve as guest curators and curators write art criticism. The retrospectives of de Kooning and Newman at the Museum of Modern Art were both arranged by the editor of ARTnews, Thomas B. Hess. (A crossover in the opposite direction was made by John Coplans, former curator of Pasadena Art Museum and now editor of the magazine.) William Rubin, a curator at the same museum, wrote a monograph on Frank Stella; he is also a collector and lent a Newman to the retrospective. In ten years I have been a curator, a teacher and an art critic, usually two at a time. The roles within the system, therefore, do not restrict mobility; the participants can move functionally within a cooperative system. Collectors back galleries and influence museums by acting as trustees or by making donations; or a collector may act as a shop window for a gallery by accepting a package collection from one dealer or one adviser. All of us are looped together in a new and unsettling connectivity. [...]  

Not only has the group of artists expanded in number but art is distributed to a larger audience in new ways, by improved marketing techniques and by mass media. What does the vague term 'art world' cover? It includes original works of art and reproductions; critical, historical and informative writings; galleries, museums and private collections. It is a sum of persons, objects, resources, messages and ideas. It includes monuments and parties, aesthetics and openings, Avalanche and Art in America. I want to describe it as a system and consider what effects it has on art and on our understanding of art. Let me state at once that the system does not mean merely ‘establishment'; as Tomas Maldonado has pointed out, system is often used as a synonym for regime, which vulgarizes an exceedingly useful term.2  

Recognition of recent art, the art of the sixties, induces a sense of product proliferation. An example from industry is the big airplane, the DC-10, being followed by theshort haul DC-9 intwo differentversions.Artists use their own work and each other's in this way, rapidly and systematically following up new ideas. In addition, the written criticism of the period has supplied visual art with instant commentary. There has been therefore a considerable increase in the number of short term orderly projections and their improvised interpretation. The effect is, to quote Henri Lefebvre, of an 'enormous amount of signifiers liberated or  insufficiently attached to their corresponding signifieds'.3 In reaction to this has been widespread discontent with the existing system of information-handling in the arts. The problem of art for the educated has taken on acute significance with the emergence of an alienated audience, for instance, the youth market and the black community. Reassessment by the artists and their role in society parallels their audience's doubt about art's centrality. The market or exchange value of art has been discussed since 1960, not as a source of prestige but as the taint of corruption.Art is a commodity in a part of the system but not in all of it, and at this point I am more interested in differentiation than reduction.  

The art world can be viewed as 'a shifting multiple goal coalition'.4 It is, to continue regarding it as an organization, 'a 'negotiated environment'. That is, long contracts with suppliers and customers, adherence to industry-wide pricing, conventions and support of stable ‘good business practice'5 The contracts are usually less formal in art, and good business practice is pretty vague, but the parallel is there. Decisions in art galleries, museums, magazines and publishing houses are made close to the working base of each enterprise, as in decentralization. Thus we have a network, not a hierarchic structure. As H.J. Leavitt points out, apropos of the individual in a network: It is enough, in somecases,iftheyareeach touched bysome part ofa network of communication which also touches each of the others at some point:'6 Such a pattern of partial information fits the complex movement of messages and influences in the art world. Raymond D. Cottoll has referred to 'the principle of “simple structure", which assumes that in an experiment involving a broad and well sampled set of variables it is improbable that any single influence will effect all of them. In other words, it is more “simple" to expect that any one variable will be accounted for byless than the full complexity of allthe factors added together'.7 This should be borne in mind, for it is absolutely against my intention to reduce the art world to any single influence by describing it as an organization. On the contrary, it is only in this way that its complexity can be kept clear.  

'The organization as a system has an output, a product or an outcome, but this is not necessarily identical with the individual purposes of group members', observe D. Katz and R.L. Kahn.8 What is the output of the art world viewed as a system? It is not art, because that exists prior to distribution and without the technology of information. The output is the distribution of art, both literal and in mediated form as text and reproduction. The individual reasons for distribution vary; with dealers it can be assumed to be the profit motive at one remove. Art galleries, museums, universities, publishers, are all part of the knowledge industry, producing signifiers whose signifieds are works of art, artists, styles, periods.  

F.E. Emery and E.L. Trist have discussed systems in relation to the various forms of environment that they occupy. The art world would seem to be more animated than a‘placid clustered environment' but less momentous than a 'turbulent field'.Between these twofalls the‘disturbed-reactive environment'.  

This term refers to a situation in which there is more than one organization of the same kind; indeed, the existence of a number of similar organizations now becomes the dominant characteristic of the environmental field. Each organization does not simply have to take account of theothers whenthey meet at random, but has also to consider that what it knows can also be known by others. The part of the environment to which it wishes to move itself in the long run is also the part towhichtheothersseektomove.9  

Certainly the art world meets Emery and Trist's requirement of 'the presence of similar others' in a disturbed reactive environment.  

The principle of conflict of interest is fully applicable to the situation in the art world. There is, for example, the competition among artists to do a certain kind of work that is potential in the level of knowledge that a group of them shares. It applies also to the relationships among critics: these are rarely antagonistic, but it is noticeable that critics have not as a rule, reviewed one another's books, though in the past few years Max Kozloff, Nicolas Calas, Lucy Lippard and Michael Kirby have all published collections of their essays. The conflict of interest among museums is marked because topicality favours certain shows at certain times and theinstitutionsknowitandknoweachotherknows.Thusthereisconsiderable competition for a limited number of desirable properties.° [...]  

In connection with early Pop art the term ‘fine art/pop art continuum' was used to describe the interconnections of cultural levels, low' and “high', unique or mass-produced, in non-homogeneous groups. It included the aesthetic appreciation of mass-produced goods, the appropriation of popular materials by artists (Pop art), and the mass media's interest in art. In the sixties, however, it became clear that the art world itself had become subject to a similar nonhierarchic connectivity. The mass media covered prominent artists or museum shows; the occasions of high culture became the subject of publicity. Abstract paintings in the House and Garden features on collectors, or the Park Place Gallery photographed with fashion models amongst the sculpture, are two examples. Here the works of art become a part of the lively flow of signs and symbols that populate the environment. In the case of one movement, that of European-based Op art, it was welcomed in the general press earlier and more cordially than in the art magazines.12 Lichtenstein and Rauschenberg have both done covers for Time and Lichtenstein one for Newsweek as well. One of Robert Smithson's earliest texts appeared in Harper's Bazaar and the first article on earthworks, by Howard Junker, appeared in the Saturday Evening Post, years beforeCalvinTomkinsgot toit inTheNewYorker.3 Theliterature of artnow runs copiously beyond the reviewing of exhibitions by critics, as art is assimilated to the sphere of consumption. Thus there exists a general field of communication within which art has a place, not the privileged place assigned to it by humanism as time-binding symbol or moral exemplar, but as part of a spectrum of objects and messages.  

According to Roland Barthes, 'what makes writing the opposite of speech is that the former always appears symbolical, introverted, ostensibly turned towards an occult side of language, whereas the second is nothing but a flow of empty signs, the movement of which alone is significant.'4 Thus he maintains the traditional separation of closed high art and popular culture as an extension of Saussure's terms language and speech [langue and parole]. The proponents of visual art as a closed form, a type of classified information, also suppose irreconcilable levels. To use a statement of Rothko's, one that has become a cliché: A picture lives by companionship, expanding and quickening in the eyes of the sensitive observer. It dies by the same token. It is, therefore, a risky and unfeeling act to send it out into the world.?'5 This view of art, highly aestheticizing but also snobbish, rests on the assumption that a painting processes a deep singular meaning and that correct reception consists of identifying it. The history of taste and the study of human communication do not suggest such perfect matching as plausible occurrence. Though art may be a private act in its origins, this is not what we can be expected to see as art becomes part of a system of public information. Art is a public system to which we, as spectators or consumers, have random access. [...]

# Caroline Tisdall Joseph Beuys: Honey Pump//1977  

Honey Pump was in action throughout the 100 days of Documenta 6 (Kassel, June-October 1977). The materials and engines were installed in the stairwell of the Museum Fridericianum and linked this to the curved space in which discussions, seminars, lectures, flms and demonstrations for the Free International University took place throughout the 100 days. After this, since its function was a sculptural articulation of these living activities, it was dismantled and appears in the museum context in its static state.  

With Honey Pump I am expressing the principle of the Free International University working in the bloodstream of society.Flowing in and out of the heart organ - the steel honey container - are the main arteries through which the honey is pumped out of the engine room with a pulsing sound. The whole thing is only complete with people in the space round which the honey artery flows and where the bee's head is to be found in the coiled loops of tubing with its two iron feelers.  

Back in the engine room the three major principles of the Theory of Sculpture - thinking, feeling and will - are brought together:  

Will power in the chaotic energy of the double engine churning out the heap of fat. Feeling in the heat and bloodstream of honey flowing throughout the whole. Thinking powers in the Eurasian staff, the head of which rises from the engine room right up to the skylight of the museum and then points down again. - Joseph Beuys, statement on Honey Pump (1977)  

The union and balance of these essential parts of human creative drive are articulated in the three tiny bronze pots set into a corner of the engine room. By happy chance, a spider wove a web in the shape of a perfect triangle above these pots and stayed there throughout the 100 days - the fat attracted plenty of flies.  

The association of warmth and energy with honey stretches back over the years to the Queen Bees of 1952.Although the principles were already there in embryo in the presentation of a range of analogies to human and natural form, to warmth processes and to psychological expression, the means were still hermetic, subject contained within object. Greater possibilities for associative layers of meaning came in the 1960s with the freedom of actions and objects relatedtothem.  

The material honey was now directly used instead of referred to through the sculptural subject of bees. Hence the use of honey in the ritual anointment of  

How to Explain Pictures to a Dead Hare in 1965. The additional freedom offered by multiples and editions enabled Beuys, like many Fluxus artists, to send out cryptic messages. Two postcard editions, Give Me Honey (1973) and Honey is Flowing in All Directions (1974) would ring a bell to anyone who knew of the range of qualities attributed to the production of honey and its analogies to human organization by Mikhail Bakunin, Karl Marx and Rudolf Steiner, in their various ways. Those who did not know would be confronted with a mystery.  

Confrontation with “images of liberation' was a hallmark or aspiration of the art of the 1960s, as Herbert Marcuse suggests. Beuys' Honey Pump marks a significant addition to this, in keeping with the pragmatic mood of the 1970s: the work'is complete only with people'. It needed communication, coordination and cooperation to have any meaning when installed for the hundred days of the Free University. Here the silent intention of Hearth - permanent conference - really did take place. Placed in the context of Documenta 6, it suggested a criticism of the one-sided relationship between artist and public, and proposed an alternative to the painfully isolated and marginal position of culture in society. The principles of a Free University follow this and represent the third stage of Beuys' involvement with the organization of political alternatives, which, like his sculpture, has grown and developed, forerunners being the German Student Party, founded in 1967, and the Organization for Direct Democracy of 1970.

# PeterFend Brief History and Founding Documents of Ocean Earth//1980-85  

# Brief History of Ocean Earth Founded 1980  

The Ocean Earth Construction and Development Corporation arose from efforts of artists to develop projects larger than possible for any one artist and of public rather than art-world service.  

The company arose from the ferment of the 1960s and 70s, during which artists moved into video and film as display media, and into earthworks and ecosystems as sculptural and architectural material. Numerous concepts emerged then: that television had become like the cathedrals of prior centuries, and that artists should produce television news as they had produced sculpture and friezes for the cathedrals before; that earth art implied an entirely new way of dealing with terrain and regional planning: that artists should function chiefly to investigate and report visually apprehensible facts of public import, and not to produce decorative objects for adornment; that mass media and not art galleries or museums are the primary field of action.  

The company was founded through the efforts of an attorney, Richard Cole. Much of the intellectual foundation for the company, and its dedication to largescale earth monitoring and engineering, comes from lectures by Vincent Scully, architecture historian at Yale. Scully argues that recent earth art and conceptual art contain the germs of a radically new approach to gardens (or land), fortresses (or military defence systems) and, extendibly, regional planning. Herefrom, the companyproceedsinto thepublic arena.(1985)  

# Founding Documents  

The company is registered in the State of New York to (1) provide ‘media services' and (2) produce ‘architectural components' This gave a mandate, for example, to producemise-en-scene orfilm documentsof sites monitored orbuilt intowith our architectural components. These documents were filed with New York State as part of the registration process. [...]  

# Ocean Earth Construction and Development Corporation?  

# Ocean Earth  

Planet monitoring and management for stable nutrient circulation, high numbers of wild animals and plants, continuousexchange of gases $\mathrm{CH}_{4}{-}\mathrm{CO}_{2}{-}\mathrm{O}_{2}$ particularly within saltwater catchments, or ocean basins including lands supplying freshwaters, soil and possible pollutants.  

Sea rigs. For production of seaweeds and fish at artificially-high rates. Rigs are hydrodynamically-stabilized, semi-submersible and rotating. They may have artificial upwellings, furnishing them not only bottom nutrients but also possible thermal-gradient energy. Harvesting of seaweeds from below allows weekly yields; a tenfold increase over present harvesting methods, which could meet all present hydrocarbon needs with a non-polluting, replenishable fuel. Effects: end to most air pollution; return of outwashed soil nutrients to economic circulation; increased oceanyields.  

Waste conversion. Via pyrolysis and bioprotein production, yielding predominantly a lower-animal feed suitable for wild feeding and spawning grounds - notably marshes. Yielding from the small ash/metal-fraction certain extractable minerals. Effects:end to most water pollution; fertilization of ecological systems through existing animal networks, therefore with complete micronutrient dispersal; easier access torecyclable ash minerals.  

Marsh construction. Whether in deserts, as wadis, or along rivers, for animal increase and flood control, or among estuaries: functioning earthworks that build up groundwater supplies and increase mix of fresh and salt waters for high bioproductivity. Set along migratory pathways of animals, chiefly airborne ones, so that upgrading and fertilization there leads quickly to replenishment of the surrounding ecosystem. Nearby, traps and lures for wild animal harvests are constructed. Effects: end to agricultural poisons or artificial fertilizers, which damage environment; end to monoculture; end to destruction of varied habitat; commercial or paramilitary harvesting of wild animals and plants in superior overall yields and of superior nutrient quality.  

Video monitoring. In the mode of Futurist photodynamism, mobilize the many possible spectral readings of an environment - usually from aircraft or satellites - into algebraically-formulated video colour streams. Consciousness may not recognize all the information, but the eye-brain complex - given a carefully balanced sofware program - will accurately respond anyway. Apply program not only to specific sites, like marshes, but also to entire hydrological systems. Effects: televisable image of entire ecological (hydrological) systems, for all to see; proper timing of harvest and fertilizations.  

# City Bild  

Construction of human settlements with optimum exposure to sun, air and scenery, with an overall shelter from extreme winds, temperature or sunlight, and with minimum interference with the movements of wild animals. Locations tend to be scattered, often on sloping terrain, along conduits.  

Skeletons. Sloped frameworks; counterbalanced and cantilevered bridges; bascule bridges; counterbalanced discs: all these usually in combination and usually set in linear patterns along hillsides or across valleys. Principles of bridge construction have become predominant in skyscrapers: now the skyscraper is set on its side, and the city becomes a series of linear, sloping structures. Skeletons rest on floating caisson foundations; they are ready to hold containers, pipelines, transport aqueducts, hydroponic farms - all upon the extending beams. Plug-in elements are structurally fitted to be ferried about by overhead gantry cranes, and to add to the overall structural strength as they are inserted. Effects: relative safety from earthquakes; easy access to infrastructure for repairs; security of infrastructure from water damage; extreme ease of renovation and reconstruction, with no need for new foundations; each time, skylines gain fresh configuration.  

Containers. Intermodal freight containers serving as standard architectural space, as a standard bay, which can be continued indefinitely along a skeletal framework of a megastructure city. Usually of the $10\texttt{X8}\times~20$ footsize, sometimes half or a quarter of that for specific functions (such as bath). Basic unit has steel roof, floor and corner posts; each post has flanges and grooves to accommodate optional, variously cut-out wall pieces. Interior spaces could be horizontal multiples of such containers. Ducts and services could be channelled through 2 foot gaps between slot levels on the skeleton. Effects: translocatable fixtures for new or different lofts; metabolically-specific spaces to accelerate certain body processes (e.g. sleep).  

Windbreaks. Tensile canopies sustained by hot-air collectors (using chiefly exhaust heat of the city) and stabilized by airfoil assemblies that baffle and neutralize wind loads. Plants suspended amidst the rigging increase oxygen supply and diffuse sunlight. Running alongside or over city frameworks, these are sometimes strong enough to suspend walkways, giant signs, aerial retreats. Effects: reduce wind load, the main load and stress on buildings, allowing lighter weight and more temporary structures; less insulation for each building, and less air-conditioning; a moderate city climate.  

Aqueducts. Pumped arteries to support continuous freight and pedestrian pathways. The supported weights do not add to load on the structures bearing up the arteries, and noise is far less than that of highways or subways: lightweight, aerial tracery can result: all travellers can see their city. Effects: mass transit with no waiting; personal choice of speed. (1980)  

# Félix Guattari The Three Ecologies//1989  

There is an ecology of bad ideas, just as there is an ecology of weeds. - Gregory Bateson, Steps to an Ecology of Mind, 1972  

The Earth is undergoing a period of intense techno-scientific transformations. If no remedy is found, the ecological disequilibrium this has generated will ultimately threaten the continuation of life on the planet's surface. Alongside these upheavals, human modes of life, both individual and collective, are progressively deteriorating. Kinship networks tend to be reduced to a bare minimum; domestic life is being poisoned by the gangrene of mass-media consumption; family and married life are frequently'ossified'bya sortof standardizationof behaviour, and neighbourhood relations are generally reduced to their meanest expression ... It is the relationship between subjectivity and its exteriority - be it social, animal, vegetable or cosmic - that is compromised in this way, in a sort of general movement of implosion and regressive infantilization. Otherness [l'altérite] tends to lose all its asperity. Tourism, for example, usually amounts to no more than a journey on the spot, with the same redundancies of images and behaviour.  

Political groupings and executive authorities appear to be totally incapable of understanding the full implications of these issues. Despite having recently initiated a partial realization of the most obvious dangers that threaten the natural environment of our societies, they are generally content simply to tackle industrial pollution, and then from a purely technocratic perspective, whereas only an ethico-political articulation - which I call ecosophy - between the three ecological registers (the environment, social relations and human subjectivity) would be likely to clarify these questions.  

Henceforth it is the ways of living on this planet that are in question, in the contextoftheaccelerationoftechno-scientificmutationsandofconsiderable demographic growth. Through the continuous development of machinic labour, multiplied by the information revolution, productive forces can make available an increasing amount of time for potential human activity. But to what end? Unemployment, oppressive marginalization, loneliness, boredom, anxiety and neurosis? Or culture, creation, development, the reinvention of the environment and the enrichment of modes of life and sensibility? In both the Third World and the developed world, whole sections of the collective sub jectivity are floundering or simply huddle around archaisms; as is the case, for example, with the dreadful rise of religious fundamentalism.  

The only true response to the ecological crisis is on a global scale, provided thatit brings about anauthenticpolitical, social and cultural revolution,reshaping the objectives of the production of both material and immaterial assets. Therefore this revolution must not be exclusively concerned with visible relations offorce on a grand scale, but will also take into account molecular domains of sensibility, intelligence and desire. [..]

# Vaclovas Mikailionis Power of the Earth//2007  

Here is an attempt at determining the geo-energy structure of Allenheads [in Northumberland] and its surroundings. We have sought to reveal this structure through bio-location and observations of local plant life.  

Already the Druids knew that the Earth is‘breathing'. It radiates streams of energy from its nucleus into the universe, which at a certain distance are refracted back into the depths of the planet. Such points of active, heightened energy can be observed every 20 or 22 metres on the Earth's surface. Because these two streams of energy go in different directions and are differently marked, part of the energy streams that rise upwards is captured by the downward streams. Therefore energy “lines' of irregular rhomboid form appear on the Earth's surface, and these are called grids. The shorter-term impact of both “lines' and 'points' is practically impossible to sense. However, trees that grow in such places will eventually either grow much faster than other trees or, on the contrary, lag behind their neighbours or even die.  

If a linden or a similar tree (for instance a rowan) happens to be at a point where energy streams upwards from the Earth's core, it will grow particularly well, and sometimes even sprout several tall trunks. The tree not only absorbs part of the energy, it also reflects it onto the surrounding environment, so that children, for instance, grow faster and become healthier. This kind of energy effect is called “feminine' and the points themselves are called “linden points'. On the map they are marked with green.  

The colour red marks the ‘oak points'. Oaks and other similar trees are particularly susceptible to the energy streams returning to Earth from the universe. Oaks not only absorb part of this energy themselves, they also reflect it onto the surrounding environment. This energy effect is ‘masculine'; it strengthens will-power, endurance, stamina and other 'masculine' qualities.  

The ‘linden points' and the ‘oak points' are not equally powerful all over the Earth's surface. The power is particularly strong where water reservoirs,geological fault lines or other anomalies are hidden deep down. At Allenheads the impact of technology is also tangible, particularly the empty disused mines. These and other factors have probably encouraged the growing of particularly tall trees in some locations, which are marked with circles on the map.  

Allenheads is also characterized by the many 'wounds' inflicted on the landscape in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. When ore was extracted, large amounts of broken stone were discarded, containing traces of lead and other heavy metals that are particularly harmful to the living environment. There are plenty of crooked and sickly trees in such locations. Today almost all of these 'wounds' have been healed through the initiativesof clever people,and Allenheads is becoming an ever more harmonious and accommodating place.  

If we aspire to a fuller and healthier life, we should refrain from building houses on the energy 'walls' and particularly at the points where they intersect. We should particularly avoid sleeping or doing our daily work in such places. All these functions should be located inside the grids, in 'calm' places, so that we may avoid illness and otherdisturbances.  

Britain is famous for its particularly powerful ley lines, which form enormous grids, and it is no coincidence that the Druids erected astronomical observatories or temples at their intersections. One such line also cuts through Allenheads, and is marked with a thicker line on the map. It is especially noteworthy that the intersection of these lines is located on a hill, named Curricks on the map. This is a place that radiates a particularly strong ‘linden' energy and becomes a source of health and 'motherly' protection to the whole village and its surroundings.  

# Pia Lindman Learning from Mould//2013  

# Breathing mould drove me to investigate the processes of building houses  

Being poisoned by nerve toxins produced by mould means that a complex set of biochemical and biomechanical events are set in motion in the body. The personal experience of poisoning is an even more complex set in which symptoms and sensations travel in feedback loops between the brain and sensing organs and cells. Since the toxin affecting you is often quite invisible and indeed scientifically immeasurable, your symptoms appear - even to yourself - absurd and weird. This incongruence of your own bodily experience with the rationale to which your surroundings (other people and you yourself) adhere makes the condition of being poisoned always also a social and psychological event. It is a highly personal experience and you feel isolated from those who do not experience the same. Your friends suggest you are a hypochondriac. In this moment, Evelyn Fox Keller's criticism of scientific processes is a helpful reminder of the relativity of medical facts'. Some decades ago, Fox Keller proved that intuition plays a major part in the processes of scientific discovery and invention, beyond rational thinking. In‘Slime Mould', an essay from 2011, Fox Keller tells us how a small, amoeba-like protist, a mould called Dictyostelium, challenged the 1960s anthropomorphic views on nature - those which assumed that life forms were organized by some predetermined plan or conscious will: ^... the aggregation of a population of single-celled amoebae proceeds spontaneously, without ... founder cells; the population emerges as the product of decentralized and local interactions amongmolecules secreted by individual cells.'  

In other words, slime mould is a self-organizing dynamic system, and Fox Keller continues: There is no “intention" guiding the development ... no agent "doing"thework.'  

Instead there are local and individual parameters for action (or reaction) for changing circumstances on a cellular level: the slime mould transforms its lifeforms depending on food supply. Fox Keller's slime mould research proposed new ways of understanding the organization of life. Like the slime mould, moulds in general appear to be semi-conscious and confusingly animal-like, yet plants. Understanding the hybridity of moulds does require giving up strict scientific categories - something scientists often resist, and thus Fox Keller's research was not well understood until decades later.  

# Learning my lesson from mould  

Our relationship to our environment starts with our senses. The first field mediating this relationship to us is our skin; a connective tissue to the outside realm; a communicative and sensory organ. Indeed, it is not an impermeable border of an individual in regards to others. Mind, body and skin comprise a minute realm where everything existing in the world can appear and fold into the mix of passions, sensations and experiences. Thinking, practices of living and research are located both in our bodies and elsewhere in the universe, and are immediately interconnected through affect. In this sense, our bodies are the perfect sensory organs, ‘measuring' instruments, in regards to all potential knowledge and action in the world.  

Here it becomes relevant to introduce an expanded notion of senses and skin, one that includes taste, tactility, memory and genetics. For instance, my knee is hurting because I am no longer running barefoot on the sandy surfaces of a savannah. Yet the bone structure of my knee supports that kind of movement rather than sitting in a chair all day. In other words, my bones include information of former life forms tens of thousands of years back in time. The sensed world includes such elements as time and space.  

The sensed world can be seen as an intersection between materials, objects, human and non-human life forms. What are the dynamics between all these elements and how do they feel, obstruct or activate energy and the sensory world around them? I propose to view this dynamics in terms of both human social interaction and human and non-human interaction with space, materials and objects, as well as with animals, microbes and various kinds of resonances. This means to saythat I place no exceptional value on the human-to-other relationship but want to understand how other relationships (not including human parties) mayaffectthesensedworldaswell.  

# Approaches to Research  

Human rationality seems to be drawn to a teleological approach to research. A sensory organism is seen to offer known inputs, and research is conducted so that the effects of given inputs are observed and measured in the organism. Based on these findings we develop applications (services, products, inventions) to this known input-output relationship, which is isolated from other relationships. In this model the sensory organism is separate from the 'application' that has an effect on it. The body is also seen as separate from the input that gave rise to the invention of the application.  

I do not see the world functioning according to the model above. I suggest approaching ‘input' and ‘output' as mutually transforming in dialogue, and simultaneously intertwined with many other processes in the same time and space. A sensory organ is not a separate entity. Rather, its borders are fuzzy and porous.Many fuzzy and porous sensory organs together form fields of interaction and influences in which many inputs and outputs converge towards and away from each other in various patterns. These are fields and bodies of varying intensity of attention and action. To relate to and to invent and connect an 'application' to these fields requires a more complex and always partial understanding of the interconnectedness of a sensory organ with itself and the surroundings. Maybe the‘application' no longer can be thought of as such, but rather as yet another field of influence.  

In my research I try toidentify fields of influences and learn what elements make them energized. I experience this in my own body: impulses of various forms and origin traverse through me, in and out of my skin. Impulses of touch, temperature, bacteria, sounds, vibrations, even the resonances of various atoms, all cross through, in and out of my body. Many of these events pass me by without any interaction with my brain, and yet some may emerge to consciousness, even as infinitely small as just hints. These notions may be baked back into the traversing of impulses in my body, now folded in together with memories, further impulses from the nervous system, ethical and utilitarian judgements and emotions, emanating more or less from my conscious mind. Affect, baked in with these 'rudiments' of my mind, forms this field of potentialities, pathways comprising both direct signals of the nerves and conscious thoughts. Pathways that sometimes look like decisions. The rudimentary pathways, those that are never expressed (lost out in the final decision-making process), remain in the body as tendencies, suspended actions, impulses, a field of potential.  

# A laboratory in real life  

I am currently building my new home with straw-bales and clay in SolbackaFagervik. I collaborate with the Natural Building Company and architect Kati Juola. On the farm Solbacka, our community of five households is building an eco-village,which is at the same time a research laboratory for ecological living, community building, construction, and work - including energy production, waste management, heating, soil maintenance and production, andwatersystems.  

Building my house in Solbacka, I train myself for further interventions into and collaborations with current common processes of planning and constructing of buildings. Making the construction process my laboratory, I want to research the tuning of buildings: how is a building connected to the soil it is rooted in, with the air it breathes, the organisms that traverse through and dwell in it, the water that flows and fumes in it. Air, water, soil, heat(energy) harbour molecules, resonances and microbes facilitating various processes relevant to the tuning of a building. This tuning is also contingent upon human social energy, something that is ‘baked' into the processes of constructing and living in the building together with the microbes, resonances and molecules.  

# Building as a body of sensory organs  

I propose the perspective of a building as a body, with various sensory organs. This building is also connected to the field it is built upon. It has a relationship to the soil under itself, and to the water streams and air around it.  

To give a few examples, if we collect heat out of soil to heat our houses (a technology currently in use), what does that mean to the energy of the soil? If we harvestelectricity out of bodies of water (from the minute movements of microbes - also a feasible technology), what does that mean to the energy of the water?  

What happens to the quality of the space and air in a house, when it is heated by fire, or by electricity? Different application of energy, i.e. heating, ionizes the air differently. Do we sense it? Or do the microbes sense it, change their constellation, and then we sense the change in the constellation of microbes in the air? How do various techniques and materials influence the atmospheric, social and sensual realms of those who dwell in them? For instance, covering walls with mixtures of clay containing fibres, microbes and minerals influence the haptic quality of the walls and the air inside the building. Further, is it possible to diminish negative effects of electricity and electromagnetic radiation with clay-assomecurrentresearchsuggests?  

Indeed mould traverses our living bodies as if we were a bundle of inanimate proteins for them to burrow or eat, and bacteria communicate with our cells, telling them about a world 'out there', a chatter of which we are very little aware, not to mention the resonances of all matter in the world, constantly humming to every part of our bodies, the boundaries of which thus dissolve, because we are also resonance, a cloud of microbes, energy, smell and light.  

# Bringing back the social  

Can we democratize or do-cratize planning and building processes, and create event/ceremony/performance-based processes of building? How can we build working with social processes and community action? For instance, can we amass people to contribute with recyclable materials and help produce matters/objects for dwelling and for social and material nourishment, such as furniture and soil for gardening? Can we set up collective production and re-use -cycles, intended to sustain the health of the building and those who dwell in it? Can we touch and be touched by our buildings and can buildings help us touch each other?  

# Concrete functions with which to experiment  

- Transformation and application of energy: heating and cooling of space, bodies   
and food   
- Light: colour, artificial, sun and fire   
- Water, filtering, energizing (salts, stones, plants and light)   
- Soil, ground, objects: energizing with heating, cooling, microbes and light  

# Practices (social manifestations of the above)  

Sauna, bathing, sleeping, dancing, cooking, eating, drinking, dwelling, gardening  

This research suggests an aesthetics that manifests itself to humans only on a sensorial level, since it is mostly about life on a molecular scale, rather than something visible to the human eye. Most of these minute activities are not consciously sensed. Indeed, perhaps microbes sense them on some not-soconscious level. Therefore, we could talk about 'aesthetics of atmosphere' and 'sense-sphere'.  

In Finnish, we could use the words olon estetiikka, which translate into 'aesthetics of being on a rather notional level'.

# Koncern? FAX ONLY: Send more information//1991  

Let us begin by establishing - as can also be seen in most of the literature written on the subject over the last few years - that the more communication which occurs in any given system, the better. This is in a way true with regard to biological systems, such as the brain and nervous system, in addition to mechanical systems, such as automatic pilot and industrial robots, and furthermore for social systems, such as primitive tribes, trade on the stock exchange and business organization. It would be appropriate, however, to observe the following three factors, which make it clear that certain functions can only work when certain variable pairs are not allowed to communicate, or when communicationbetweenthesevariablesdoesnotexceedacertainlimit.  

1 If it takes ten seconds to receive a given message, it is obvious that revisions of the message should not be sent more frequently than with intervals of eleven seconds. Correspondingly, if it takes ten years to observe the effect of a reorganization of the structure in a business, then such reorganizations will only be appropriate with intervals of eleven years. In connection with such incremental functions the amount of communication can be harmful if exaggerated.  

2When observing an organism, we see how it can take advantage of the suppression of communication. In a given situation, in which an organism first has adapted to condition A and subsequently to condition B, only to be presented to condition A again, the organism in question will only under certain circumstances be directly capable of producing behaviour that corresponds to condition A.This can only be done if those parameters that applied to condition A have not been affected during the adaptation to condition B. The existence of such communication will then be harmful and mayentail functional isolation.  

3  If we take a multi-stable system (MsS) and consider its possibilities of becoming functional in a relatively short time, then this is connected to its approximation to a stable form. In this way, any linkage of several communication channels will remove it from a stable form and, no matter what else might happen, prolong the time used to achieve operationality.  

If we now attempt to introduce Koncern°, FAX ONLY: Send more information in this schema, many operational failures will appear in the form of situations of the types 1, 2 and 3. This has entailed a high degree of functional isolation and reduced operationality in relation to the overall objective of the Reflux system, resulting inexaggerated accumulation of incoming, not-decoded messages (circa 8 units). We must acknowledge that the structure of the variable behaviour has often failed, because the overheated organism has not been implicated as a stable form. For this reason it is now our programme to turn the communicative potential of the organism into an operative ‘support model in appropriate periodicity (see 1) on a par with other factors that the communication always takes into account: the positioning of the tribe, the influence on the nervous system, the brain rights, the primitive message, etc.  

The comprehensive pilot arrangement Reflux has gained the status of a cultural project with the aim of reorganizing the communicative economy within not so few biological systems (BS). A BS is not merely an MSS with reduced operationality consisting of a diffuse amount of genotypes. It is also a 'continent' within the architecture of the communicative population in the appropriate, functional sense of that term. Reflux has pointed out the important function that every economy is biological, every exaggeration is a tribe and every message is a brain, but chooses not to adjust this to the communicative system, as this may carry functional isolation (see 2). In terms of the communicative economy, the important thing is to establish a parameter, and moreover to introduce the various system-conditions to this parameter, if the aim of the economy is to integrate Mss in its structure.  

But let it be said: telecommunications are the work of the Devil. Different systems, primitive messages, harmful structures, exaggerated periodicity, etc. are either variably or stably isolating, when they are to structure messages to a responsive tribe.Andno one in a tribe endowed with a communicative cell would dream of risking dismissive or evasive messages thatthey are subsequently not allowed to reorganize, and what remains are nothing but so many vague and weaving embraces and repulsions. But with Koncern°, FAX ONLY: Send more information things are different. Steered by an economic failure in Bs, with a primitive communicative behaviour and a structural insight in social systems, a population of messages was developed, even if it mainly consisted of intervals, but in any case pursuing a reorganization of the communicative tribe, as this exhibitiondemonstrates.  

In our structuring of the accumulated incoming, the relevant behaviour has, as already suggested, coagulated in an apparent continentality. What do to, then, in a tribe of almost-MSs? (We are in this regard not interested in investigating whether we hereby have approached sexual schemata. We rate this phenomenon to a perhaps-not-quite-incidental overlap between two orders: the order of the economical-biological and the order in a given, hitherto always 'communicative' brain; these must now be kept separate.)  

In so far as one can talk of operationality one is given to understand that any interval-oid (local) ‘stupidification' is in fact a firm, possibly-transgressive vehiclevis- $\grave{a}$ -vis our all the more urgent reservations and considerations. Out of a lack of feeling for productionality one excludes - even if one would otherwise tend to emphasize the excessive function in a given non-isolatedness (reorganization?) - these apparently transitory‘quanta' that communicate a cellular sociality qua - adaptation! In such a tribe facticity is pervasive. In any case the crisis of the communicative 'sutures' does not consist in their capacity for specificity, but in their adapted structure. But such an all-too-event (as is the case here) is ultimately a counter-munication that exactly involves the nuance of decoding that contributes to attaching every adjacent reality, and in this sense mechanical, commercial and sexual systems can be experienced as transitory. We are now postulating that in most cases - and particularly what concerns Koncern°, FAX ONLY: Send more information - there is an incrementally insisting relation that ‘animates' a certain gradually accountsestablishing sensibility, attached to‘itself' as epiparameter.  

And then finally the exaggeration as a re-sight: a post-intervalness that is an impossible matter without an implicated understanding of those‘continents' that build the cells of a tribe. We really have stopped recording the transmissions of a cultural condition. Maybe we will succeed in proceeding by undertaking a surprising bringing to an end (see the above nuance); in this way we become intermodern apparatuses ourselves, and thus‘de-continentalized' by external movement of incremental transgressions; the end of our millennium connects with a certain Mss-ishness ...  

If we attempt to analyse this, a strangely evasive architecture arises. One notices that several possible brains exist for our behaviour; this is either an overlapping function (in relation to the above mentioned orders), or it isn't - at least there is a certain assumption, indeed even a prejudice, concerning the fact that 'construction'/architecture should be comprehended from the connection that may be established between nuance and apparatus. There are some models that make possible a more specific consideration of perhaps-transgressions. But it is doubtful whetheranybody haseverconsidered himself capable of productivizing even an apparent pointing out some such thing, or something like it.  

This is why the delay of such a blind-not-blind electronic osmosis, in relation to its potential for being described as Mss, should be considered as effect and analysed as such; we are not witnessing a 'communication of consciousnesses', but instead an effectuation of the brains as ideo-technical potency qua systematic stagings (Reflux, FAX ONLY, ArtCom, Showbim, UNIVAP, Kunihiko, ad lib.) whose modalities seem to develop beyond control. And yet we know that the absence of structure within a structure can be a carrier of information as real as the structure itself, which is why one with the proper measuring equipment should be capable of constituting a certain semi-permeable organization, whose communicative agreement, even if delayed, exposes an economy that can be mistaken for MsS and vice versa.  

In the present agreement, Koncern°, FAX ONLY: Send more information, information is invested via retroaction, that is, through a replicating feedback mechanism qua the Reflux environment. Here communication expands under the control of CET and ACTIVITY REPORTs, a kind of combinatory delay - the Greenwich Connection: frequency and success. As indicated, our programme has been to organize this communicative potential in seven MessageStructureSolids. In this way, Koncern°, FAX ONLY: Send more information has been brought from the local condition to the Reflux environment and back again. Whether the terminal condition corresponds to the initial condition depends on the degree to which the Reflux network has affected the system.

# Bruno Latour Network: A Concept, Not a Thing Out There//2005  

Let...] What is a good text? We are not concerned here by good style because, no matter how well we learn to write, we will always remain, alas, mere social scientists and we will never be able to do more than emulate from far away the skills of writers, poets, playwrights and novelists. For this reason, we need a less sophisticated shibboleth. Surprisingly, it's the search for just such a touchstone that will help us define the most confusing of the words used in our alternative social theory. I would define a good account as one that traces a network.  

I mean by this word a string of actions where each participant is treated as a full-blown mediator. To put it very simply: a good actor-network theory (ANT) account is a narrative or a description or a proposition where all the actors do something and don't just sit there. Instead of simplytransporting effects without transforming them, each of the points in the text may become a bifurcation, an event,or theoriginofanewtranslation.Assoonasactorsaretreatednot as intermediaries but as mediators,they render the movement of the social visible to the reader. Thus, through many textual inventions, the social may become again a circulating entity that is nolonger composed of the stale assemblage of what passed earlier as being part of society. A text, in our definition of social science,is thus a test on how many actors the writeris able to treat as mediators andhowfarheorsheis abletoachievethesocial.  

Th us the network does not designate a thing out there that would have roughly the shape of interconnected points, much like a telephone, a freeway or a sewage 'network'. It is nothing more than an indicator of the quality of a text about the topics at hand.2 It qualifies its objectivity, that is, the ability of each actor to make other actors do unexpected things. A good text elicits networks of actors when it allows the writer to trace a set of relations defined as so many translations.  

# A Terminological Precision about Network  

The word network is so ambiguous that we should have abandoned it long ago. And yet the tradition in which we use it remains distinct in spite of its possible confusion with two other lines. One is of course the technical networks - electricity, trains, sewerage, the Internet, and so on. The second one is used, in the sociology of organization, to introduce a difference between organizations, markets and states. In this case, network represents one informal way of associating together human agents.  

When Manuel Castells uses the term, the two meanings merge, since network becomes a privileged mode of organization thanks to the very extension of information technology. It's also in this sense that Luc Boltanski and Eve Chiapello take it to define a new trend in the capitalist mode of production.  

But the other tradition, to which we have always referred, is that of Diderot, especially in his Le reve de d"Alembert (1769), which includes twenty-seven instances of the word réseaux. This is where you can find a very special brand of active and distributed materialism of which Deleuze, through Bergson, is the most recent representative.3 Here is one example:  

This one should satisfy you for today. There was a woman who had just given birth to a child; as a result, she suffered a most alarming attack of the vapours - compulsive tears and laughter, a sense of suffocation, convulsions, swelling of the breasts, melancholy silence, piercing shrieks - all the most serious symptoms - and this went on for several years. Now this woman was passionately in love, and eventually she began to think she saw signs indicating that her lover had grown wary of her illness and complaints and was beginning to break off their affair. That was when she decided that she must either get well or make an end of herself. In this way there began a sort of civil war inside her own consciousness. Sometimes this war would turn to the advantage of the master; sometimes the subjects would get the upper hand. Whenever the two sides were equal, so that the force exerted bythefibresexactlycounterbalancedthatofthecentreofthebundle[Sil arrivait que l'action des filets du reseau fit égale a la reaction de leur origine], she would fall to the ground as though dead. Then, when carried to her bed, she would lie for hours on end, entirely motionless and almost lifeless. On other occasions the effect wouldbe only one of generallassitudeorexhaustion orloss of consciousness from which it often seemed she would never recover. For six months she kept up the struggle. Whenever the rebellion began in her fibres she was able to feel it coming on. She would stand up, run about, busy herself with the most vigorous forms of physical exercise, limb up and down stairs, saw wood or shovel dirt. She would make the centre of her network, the organ of will power, as rigid as possible by saying toherself: “You must conquer or die.'(Denis Diderot, Le reve de d'Alembert [1964 translation])  

It's clear from this quote that réseau has nothing to do with the social as normally construed, nor is it limited to human ties. But it's certainly close to Gabriel Tarde's definition of 'society' and ‘imitative rays'.  

So how can we define, by contrast, a bad textual account? In a bad text only a handful of actors will be designated as the causes of all the others, which will have no other function than to serve as a backdrop relay for the flows of causal efficacy. They may go through the gestures to keep busy as characters, but they will be without a part in the plot, meaning they will not act. Nothing is translated from one to the other, since action is simply carried through them. Remember that if an actor makes no difference, it's not an actor. The report has not been produced in an ad hoc fashion to be uniquely adequate to the description of specific actors and for the eyes of specific readers.4 It is standard, anonymous, across the board; nothing happens in it. There are just repeat cliches of what has been assembled before as the social past. It has watered down translations into mere displacements without transformation. It simply transports causalities through mere intermediaries.  

This is where the literary contrast between ANT and sociology of the social - and even more so with critical sociology - is the greatest. What is often called a powerful and convincing account, because it is made of a few global causes generating a mass of effects, ANT will take as a weak and powerless account that simply repeats and tries to transport an already composed social force without reopening what it is made of and without finding the extra vehicles necessary to extend it further. Masses of social agents might have been invoked in the text, but since the principle of their assembly remains unknown and the cost of their expansion has not been paid, it's as if nothing was happening. No matter what their figuration is, they don't do very much. Since the reassembling of new aggregates has not been rendered traceable through the text, it's as if the social world had not been made to exist. Although the common definition of the social seems to be everywhere in full view, our definition of what is social has failed to appear. Conversely, when our definition of the social is retraced, the common definition of the social has to vanish first. It's hard to see a more extreme contrast: it is either a society or a network.  

So, network is an expression to check how much energy, movement and specificity our own reports are able to capture. Network is a concept, not a thing out there. It is a tool to help describe something, not what is being described. It has the same relationship with the topic at hand as a perspective grid to a traditional single point perspective painting: drawn first, the lines might allow one to project a three-dimensional object onto a flat piece of linen; but they are not what is to be painted, only what has allowed the painter togive the impression of depth before they are erased. In the same way, a network is not what is represented in the text, but what readies the text to take the relay of actors as mediators. The consequence is thatyou can provide an actor-network account of topics which have in no way the shape of a network - a symphony, a piece of legislation, a rock from the moon, an engraving. Conversely, you may well write about technical networks -television,e-mails,satellites,salesforce -without at any point providing an actor-network account.  

But is it not somewhat disingenuous toretain the trickyword network to describe such a benchmark of literary quality? I agree that it does not resemble other words I have used up to now like actor, actant, fluid and non-human, which are chosen voluntarily because of their benighted meaninglessness. This one, on the contrary, has too many meanings! The confusion took place - but is our fault entirely-becausesome of theearlierobjectsdescribed byANTwerenetworks in the technical sense - metrology, subways, telephones - and also because when this term was introduced twenty-five years ago, the Internet had not struck - nor had al-Qaida for that matter. So network was a novelty that could help in eliciting a contrast with‘society',‘institution'‘culture',‘fields', etc.which were often conceived as surfaces, floods of causal transfers, and real matters of fact. But nowadays, networks have become the rule and surfaces the exception. It has lost its sharp edge.5 If I believed in jargon and if worknet or action net had any chance to hold, I would offer it as a substitute so as to make the contrast between technical networks and worknets, the latter remaining a way for social scientists to make sense of the former.6Work-nets could allow one to see the labour that goes on in laying down net-works: the first as an active mediator, the second as a stabilized set of intermediaries.  

Whatever the word, we need something to designate flows of translations. Why not use the word network, since it is now there and solidly attached by a little hyphen to the word actor that I redefined earlier? There exists no good word anyway, only sensible usage; in addition, the original material metaphor still retains the three important features I wish to induce with this expression:  

a) a point-to-point connection is being established which is physically traceable and thus can be recorded empirically; b) such a connection leaves empty most of what is not connected, as any fisherman knows when throwing his net in the sea;7  

c) this connection is not made for free, it requires effort as any fisherman knows when repairing it on the deck.  

To make it fit our purposes,we have to add a fourth feature that, Iagree, breaks down the original metaphor somewhat: a network is not made of nylon thread, words or any durable substance but is the trace left behind by some moving agent. You can hang your fish nets to dry, but you can't hang an actor-network: it has to be traced anew by the passage of another vehicle, another circulating entity.  

The weakness of the notion derives partly from the dissemination of rather simple-minded visual representations. At first, the graph representation of networks, seen as star-like embranchments out of which lines leave to connect other points that have nothing but new connections, provided a rough but faithful equivalent to those associations.8 It had the advantage of defining specificity not by any substantial content, but by a list of associations: the more connected, the more individualized a point was. But those visual graphs have the drawback of not capturing movements and of being visually poor. Yet even those limits have their advantage, since the very poverty of graphical representation allows the enquirer not to confuse his or her infra-language with the rich objects that are being depicted: the map is not the territory. At least there is no risk of believing that the world itself is made of points and lines, while social scientists too often seem to believe that the world is made of social groups, societies, cultures, rules, or whatever graphic displays they have devised to make sense of their data.  

In order to trace an actor-network, what we have to do is add to the many traces left by the social fluid through which the traces are rendered again present, provided something happens in it. In an actor-network account the relative proportion of mediators to intermediaries is increased. I will call such a description a risky account, meaning that it can easily fail - it does fail most of the time - since it can put aside neither the complete artificiality of the enterprise nor its claim to accuracy and truthfulness. As to its relevance for the actors themselves and the political impact it might have, this is even less automatic. The whole question is toseewhether the event of the social canbe extended all the way to the event of the reading through the medium of the text. This is the price to pay for objectivity, or rather 'objectfulness' to be achieved.  

4 [184] To say that it's an actor-network is to say that it's specific and that the principles of its expansion are rendered visible and the price for its deployment fully paid.   
5 [185] As Boltanski and Chiapello's The NewSpirit of Capitalism has shown,it can even be used to characterize what is worst in the recent metamorphosis of capitalist modes of production.   
6 [186] Action net, as proposed in Barbara Czarniawska, ‘On Time, Space and Action Nets, Organization, vol. 11, no.6 (2004).   
7 [187] This point will become even more essential when we deal with the notion of ‘plasma'. Emptinessisthekeyinfollowingtherareconduitsinwhichthesocialcirculates.   
8 [188] This was shown in the early Leximappe tools in Michel Callon, John Law and Arie Rip Mapping the Dynamics of Science and Technology (London, 1986). However, there are now many more graphic devices that have been developed. [..]

# Roy Ascott Is There Love in the Telematic Embrace?//1990  

The past decade has seen the two powerful technologies of computing and telecommunications converge into one field of operations that has drawn into its embrace other electronic media, including video, sound synthesis, remotesensing and a variety of cybernetic systems. These phenomena are exerting enormous influence upon society and on individual behaviour; they seem increasingly to be calling into question the very nature of what it is to be human, to be creative, to think and to perceive, and indeed our relationship to each other and to the planet as a whole. The ‘telematic culture' that accompanies the new developments consists of a set of behaviours, ideas, media, values and objectives that are significantly unlike those that have shaped society since the Enlightenment. New cultural and scientific metaphors and paradigms are being generated, new models and representations of reality are being invented, new expressive means are being manufactured.  

Telematics is a term used to designate computer-mediated communications networking involving telephone, cable and satellite links between geographically dispersed individuals and institutions that are interfaced to data-processing systems, remote sensing devices and capacious data storage banks. It involves the technology of interaction among human beings and between the human mind and artificial systems of intelligence and perception.The individual user of networks is always potentially involved in a global net, and the world is always potentially in a state of interaction with the individual. Thus, across the vast spread of telematics networks worldwide, the quantity of data processed and the density of information exchanged is incalculable. The ubiquitous efficacy of the telematic medium is not in doubt, but the question in human terms, from the point of view of culture and creativity, is: What is the content?  

This question, which seems to be at the heartof many critiques of art involving computers and telecommunications, suggests deep-seated fears of the machine coming to dominate the human will and of a technological formalism erasing human content and values. Apart from all the particulars of personal histories, of dreams, desires and anxieties that inform the content of art's rich repertoire, the question, in essence, is asking: Is there love in the telematic embrace?  

In the attempt to extricate human content from technological form, the question is made more complicated by our increasing tendency as artists to bring together imaging, sound and text systems into interactive environments that exploit state-of-the-art hypermedia and that engage the full sensorium, albeit by digital means. Out of this technological complexity, we can sense the emergence of a synthesis of the arts. The question of content must therefore be addressed to what might be called the Gesamtdatenwerk - the integrated data work - and to its capacity to engage the intellect, emotions and sensibility of the observer.2 Here, however, more problems arise, since the observer in an interactive telematic system is by definition a participator. In a telematic art, meaning is not created by the artist,distributed through the network and received by the observer. Meaning is the product of interaction between the observer and the system, the content of which is in a state of flux, of endless change and transformation. In this condition of uncertainty and instability, not simply because of the crisscrossing interactions of users of the network but because content is embodied in data that is itself immaterial, it is purely an electronic difference, until it has been reconstituted at the interface as image, text or sound. The sensory output may be differentiated further as existing on screen, as articulated structure or material, as architecture, as environment, or in virtual space.  

Such a view is in line with a more general approach to art as residing in a cultural communications system rather than in the art object as a fixed semantic configuration - a system in which the viewer actively negotiates for meaning.? In this sense, telematic networking makes explicit in its technology and protocols what is implicit in all aesthetic experience, where that experience is seen as being as creative as the act of the artist's production.4 Classical communications theory holds, however, that communication is a one-way dispatch, from sender to receiver,in which only contingent‘noise'in the channel can modify the message (often further confused as the meaning) initiated at the source of transmission.5 This is the model that has the artist as sender and therefore originator of meaning, the artist as creator and owner of images and ideas, the artist as controller of context and content. It is a model that requires, for its completion, the viewer as, at best, a skilled decoder or interpreter of the artist's 'meaning' or, at worst, simply a passive receptacle of such meaning. It gives rise to the industry of criticism and exegesisin which those who'understand' this or thatwork of artexplain it to thosewho are too stupid or uneducated toreceive its meaning unaided. In this scenario, the artwork and its maker are viewed in the same way as the world and its creator. The beauty and truth of both art and the world are 'out there' in the world and in the work of art. They are as fixed and immutable as the material universe appears to be. The canon of determinism decrees prefigured harmony and composition, regulated form and continuity of expression, with unity and clarity assured by a cultural consensus and a linguistic uniformity shared by artist and public alike.  

The problem of content and meaning within a telematic culture gives added poignancy to the rubric ‘Issues of Content' under which this present writing on computers and art is developed: Issue' is open to a plurality of meanings, no one of which is satisfactory. The metaphor of a semantic sea endlessly ebbing and flowing, of meaning constantly in flux, of all words, utterances, gestures and images in a state of undecidability, tossed to and fro into new collusions and conjunctions within a field of human interaction and negotiation, is found as much in new science - in quantum physics, second order cybernetics,6 or chaology.7 for example - as in art employing telematic concepts or the new literary criticism that has absorbed philosophy and social theory into its practice. This sunrise of uncertainty, of a joyous dance of meaning between layers of genre and metaphoric systems, this unfolding tissue woven of a multiplicity of visual codes and cultural imaginations was also the initial promise of the postmodern project before it disappeared into the domain of social theory, leaving only its frail corpus of pessimism and despair.  

In the case of the physicists, the radical shift in metaphors about the world and our participation in its creation and re-description mean that science's picture window onto reality has been shattered by the very process of trying to measure it. John Wheeler uses this analogy succinctly:  

Nothing is more important about the quantum principle than this, that it destroys the concept of the world‘sitting out there'with the observer safely separated from it by a 20 centimetre slab of plate glass. Even to observe so minuscule an object as an electron, he must shatter the glass. He must reach in. He must install his chosen measuring equipment. It is up to him whether he shall measure position or momentum ...the measurement changes the state of the electron. The universe will never afterwards be the same. To describe what has happened one has to cross out that old word 'observer' and put in its place 'participator'. In some strange sense the universe is a participatory universe.8  

In the context of telematic systems and the issue of content and meaning, the parallel shift in art of the status of‘observer' to that of‘participator’ is demonstrated clearly if in accounts of the quantum principle we substitute 'data' for‘quanta'. Indeed, finding such analogies between art and physics is more than just a pleasant game; the web of connections between new models of the theory and practice in the arts and the sciences, over a wide domain, is so pervasive as to suggest a paradigm shift in our world view, a redescription of reality and a recontextualization of ourselves. We begin to understand that chance and change, chaos and indeterminacy, transcendence and transformation, the immaterial and the numinous are terms at the centre of our self-understanding and our new visions of reality.How then,could there be a content - sets of meanings - contained within telematic art when every aspect of networking in dataspace is in a state of transformation and of becoming? The very technology of computer telecommunications extends the gaze, transcends the body, amplifies the mind into unpredictable configurations of thought and creativity.  

In the recent history of Western art, it was Marcel Duchamp who first took the metaphor of the glass, of the window onto the world, and turned it back on itself to reveal what is invisible. We see, in The Bride Stripped Bare By Her Bachelors, Even, or The Large Glass (1912-23), a field of vitreous reality in which energy and emotion are generated from the tension and interaction of male and female, natural and artificial, human and machine.9  

Its subject is attraction in Charles Fourier's senselo or, we might even say, love. The Large Glass, in its transparent essence, always includes both its environment and the reflection of the observer. Love is contained in this total embrace; all that escapes is reason and certainty. By participating in the embrace, the viewer comes to be a progenitor of the semantic issue. The glass as 'ground' has a function and status anticipating that of the computer monitor as a screen of operations - of transformations - and as the site of interaction and negotiation for meaning. But it is not only through the Glass that we can see Duchamp as prophetic of the telematic mode. The very metaphor of networking interaction in a field of uncertainty, in which the observer is creator and meaning is unstable, is implicit in all his work. Equally prophetic in the Glass is the horizontal bar that joins the upper and lower parts of the work and serves as a metaphor for the allaround viewing of Renaissance space, embodied in the Western pictorial tradition, where the metaphor of verticality is employed insistently in its monuments and architecture - emblems often as not of aggression, competition and dominance, always of a tunnel vision. The horizontal, on the other hand, is a metaphor for the bird's-eye view, the all-over, all-embracing, holistic systems view of structures, relationships and events - viewing that can include the ironic, the fuzzy and the ambiguous. This is precisely the condition of perception and insight to which telematic networking aspires.  

Perhaps the most powerful metaphor of interconnectedness and the horizontal embrace in art before the advent of telematic media is to be found in the work of Jackson Pollock.!1 Here the horizontal arena, a space marked out on the surface of the earth, is the ‘ground' for the action and transformation that become the painting itself. Pollock created his powerful metaphors of connectedness by generating fields of intertwining, interweaving, branching, joining, colliding, crossing, linking lines of energy. His space is inclusive and inviting, his imagery carries a sense of anonymity of authorship that embraces the viewer in the creation of meaning. Nothing in painting could be more emblematic or prophetic of the network consciousness emerging with the telematic culture. [...]  

The emerging new order of art is that of interactivity, of ‘dispersed authorship'12 The canon is one of contingency and uncertainty. Telematic art encompasses a wide array of media: hypermedia, videotex, telefacsimile, interactive video, computer animation and simulation, teleconferencing, text exchange, image transfer, sound synthesis, telemetry and remote sensing, virtual space, cybernetic structures and intelligent architecture. These are simply broad categories of technologies and methodologies that are constantly evolving - bifurcating, joining, hybridizing - at an accelerated rate.  

At the same time, the status of the art object changes. The culturally dominant objet d'art as the sole focus (the uncommon carrier of uncommon content) is replaced by the interface. Instead of the artwork as a window onto a composed, resolved and ordered reality, we have at the interface a doorway to undecidability, a dataspace of semantic and material potentiality. The focus of the aesthetic shifts from the observed object to participating subject, from the analysis of observed systems to the (second-order) cybernetics of observing systems: the canon of the immaterial and participatory. Thus, at the interface to telematic systems, content is created rather than received. By the same token, content is disposed of at the interface by reinserting it, transformed by the process of interaction, back into the network for storage, distribution and eventual transformation at the interface of other users, at other access nodes across the planet. [...]  

Telematic culture means, in short, that we do not think, see or feel in isolation. Creativity is shared, authorship is distributed, but not in a way that denies the individual her authenticity or power of self creation, as rather crude models of collectivity might have done in thepast. On the contrary, telematic culture amplifies the individual's capacity for creative thought and action,for more vivid and intense experience, for more informed perception, by enabling her to participate in the production of global vision through networked interaction with other minds, other sensibilities, other sensing and thinking systems across the planet - thought circulating in the medium of data through a multiplicity of different cultural, geographical, social and personal layers. Networking supports endless redescription and recontextualization such that no language or visual code is final and no reality is ultimate. In the telematic culture, pluralism and relativism shape the configurations of ideas - of image, music and text - that circulate in the system.  

It is the computer that is at the heart of this circulation system, and, like the heart, it works best when it becomes invisible. At present, the computer as a physical, material presence is too much with us; it dominates our inventory of tools, instruments, appliances and apparatus as the ultimate machine. In our artistic and educational environments it is all too solidly there, a computational block to poetry and imagination. It is not transparent, nor is it yetf ully understood as pure system, a universal transformative matrix. The computer is not primarily a thing,anobject,butasetofbehaviours,asystem,actuallyasystem ofsystems.  

Data constitute its lingua franca. It is the agent of the datafield, the constructor of dataspace. Where it is seen simply as a screen presenting the pages of an illuminated book, or as an internally lit painting, it is of no artistic value. Where its considerable speed of processing is used simply to simulate filmic or photographic representations, it becomes the agent of passive voyeurism. Where access to its transformative power is constrained by a typewriter keyboard, the user is forced into the posture of a clerk.The electronic palette, the light pen and even the mouse bind us to past practices. The power of the computer's presence, particularly the power of the interface to shape language and thought, cannot be overestimated. It may not be an exaggeration to say that the^content'of telematic art will depend in large measure on the nature of the interface; that is, the kind of configurations and assemblies of image, sound and text, the kind of restructuring and articulation of environment that telematic interactivity might yield, will be determined by the freedoms and fluidity available at the interface.  

The essence of the interface is its potential flexibility; it can accept and deliver images both fixed and in movement, sounds constructed, synthesized or sampled, texts written and spoken. It can be heat sensitive, body responsive, environmentally aware. It can respond to the tapping of feet, the dancer's arabesque, the direction of a viewer's gaze. It not only articulates a physical environment with movement, sound or light; it is an environment, an arena of dataspace in which a distributed art of the human/computer symbiosis can be acted out,theissue ofits cyberneticcontent. Eachindividual computer interface is an aspect of a telematic unity such that to be in or at any one interface is to be in the virtual presence of all the other interfaces throughout the network of which it is a part. This might be defined as the 'holomatic' principle in networking. It is so because all the data flowing through any access node of the network are equally and at the same time held in the memory of that network: they can be accessed, through cable or satellite links, from any part of the planet at any time of day or night, by users of the network (who, in order to communicate with each other, do not need to be in the same place at the same time).  

To the objection that such a global vision of an emerging planetary art is uncritically euphoric, or that the prospectus of a telematic culture with its Gesamtdatenwerk of hypermediated virtual realities is too grandiose, we should perhaps remind ourselves of the essentially political, economic and social sensibilities of those who laid the conceptual foundations of the field of interactive systems. This cultural prospectus implies a telematic politic, embodying the features of feedback, self-determination, interaction and collaborative creativity not unlike the ‘science of government' for which, over 150 years ago, André-Marie Ampere coined the term ‘cybernetics' - a term reinvigorated and humanized by Norbert Wiener in this century.3 Contrary to the rather rigid determinism and positivism that have shaped society since the Enlightenment, however,these features will have to accommodate notions of uncertainty, chaos, autopoiesis, contingency and the second-order cybernetics of the fuzzy - a systems view of a world in which the observer and observed, creator and viewer, are inextricably linked in the process of making reality - all our many separate realities interacting, colliding, reforming and resonating within the telematic noosphere of the planet.  

Our sensory experience becomes extrasensory, as our vision is enhanced by the extrasensory devices of telematicperception.The computer dealsinvisibly with the invisible. It processes those connections, collusions, systems, forces and fields, transformations and transferences, chaotic assemblies and higher orders of organization that lie outside our vision, outside the gross level of material perception afforded by our natural senses. Totally invisible to our everyday unaided perception, for example, is the underlying fluidity of matter, the indeterminate dance of electrons, the ‘snap, crackle and pop' of quanta, the tunnelling and transpositions, nonlocal and superluminal, that the new physics presents.4 It is these patterns of events, these new exhilarating metaphors of existence - nonlinear, uncertain, layered and discontinuous - that the computer can redescribe. With the computer, and brought together in the telematic embrace, we can hope to glimpse the unseeable, to grasp the ineffable chaos of becoming,the secret order of disorder. And as we come to see more, we shall see the computer less and less. It will become invisible in its immanence, but its presence will be palpable to the artist engaged telematically in the world process of autopoiesis, planetary self-creation.  

The technology of computerized media and telematic systems is no longer to be viewed simply as a set of rather complicated tools extending therange of painting and sculpture, performed music or published literature. It can now be seen to support a whole new field of creative endeavour that is as radically unlike each of those established artistic genres as they are unlike each other. A new vehicle of consciousness, of creativity and expression, has entered our repertoire of being. While it is concerned with both technology and poetry, the virtual and the immaterial, as well as the palpable and concrete, the telematic may be categorized as neither art nor science, while being allied in many ways to the discourses of both. The further development of this field will clearly mean an interdependence of artistic, scientific and technological competencies and aspirations and, urgently, the formulation of a transdisciplinary education.  

So, to link the ancient image-making process of Navajo sand painting'5 to the digital imaging of modern supercomputers through common silicon, which serves them both as pigment and processor chip, is more than ironic whimsy. The holistic ambition of Native American culture is paralleled by the holistic potentiality of telematic art. More than a technological expedient for the interchange of information, networking provides the very infrastructure for spiritual interchange that could lead to the harmonization and creative development of the whole planet. With this prospectus, however naively optimistic and transcendental it may appear in our current fin-de-siecle gloom, the metaphor of love in the telematic embrace may not be entirely misplaced.

# Jane Bennett What is an Assemblage?//2010  

[...] At the end of the twentieth century, the arena in which stuff happens - what the military calls the 'theatre of operations' - seemed to many people to have expanded dramatically. 'Globalization' had occurred and the earth itself had become a space of events. The parts of this giant whole were both intimately interconnected and highly conflictual. This fact - of the coexistence of mutual dependency with friction and violence between parts - called for new conceptualizations of the part-whole relation. Organicist models,in which each member obediently serves the whole,were clearly out.A host of new ways to name the kind of relation obtaining between the parts of a volatile but somehow functioning whole were offered: network, meshwork, Empire. My term of choice to describe this event-space and its style of structuration is, following Deleuze and Guattari, assemblage.  

Assemblages are ad hoc groupings of diverse elements, of vibrant materials of all sorts. Assemblages are living, throbbing confederations that are able to function despite the persistent presence of energies that confound them from within. They have uneven topographies, because some ofthe points at which the various affects and bodies cross paths are more heavily trafficked than others, and so power is not distributed equally across its surface. Assemblages are not governed by any central head: no one materiality or type of material has sufficient competence to determine consistently the trajectory or impact of the group. The effects generated by an assemblage are, rather, emergent properties, emergent in that their ability to make something happen (a newly inflected materialism, a blackout, a hurricane, a war on terror) is distinct from the sum of the vital force of each materiality considered alone. Each member and proto-member of the assemblage has a certain vital force, but there is also an effectivity proper to the grouping as such: an agency of the assemblage. And precisely because each member-actant maintains an energetic pulse slightly‘off' from that of the assemblage, an assemblage is never a stolid block but an open-ended collective, a 'non-totalizable sum.' An assemblage thus not only has a distinctive history of formation but a finite life span.  

The electrical power grid offers a good example of an assemblage. It is a material cluster of charged parts that have indeed affiliated, remaining in sufficient proximity and coordination to produce distinctive effects. The elements of the assemblage work together, although their coordination does not rise to the level of an organism. Rather, its gelling endures alongside energies and factions that fly out from it and disturb it from within. And, most important for my purposes, the elements of this assemblage, while they include humans and their (social,legal, linguistic) constructions, also include some very active and powerful non-humans: electrons, trees, wind, fire, electromagnetic fields.

# Aleksandra Mir HELLO: In Conversation with Lars Bang Larsen//2013  

Lars Bang Larsen With a crisp idea and a crystalline appearance, HELLO (2000-) is an artwork that lingers in one's mind. The first version was exhibited in the group show The Pyramids of Mars' (Fruitmarket Gallery, Edinburgh, 20o0) and until 2011 you created a dozen versions of the piece, specially created for each newvenue.WhatisHELLO?  

Aleksandra Mir HELLO is a photographic daisy chain linking people who have met in varying circumstances, spanning a wide geographic, historical and social spectrum. It involves the famous from all possible arenas - sports, politics and entertainment - but also their fans, family, friends, enemies, including my own family and friends and their further relations. Collectively, these images form an unbroken chain of human encounters, where new stories and subtexts emerge with each new image added to the chain. It is a simple idea, but with all its variables, the project's complexity expands enormously and easily becomes a lifetime commitment, theoretically encompassing the whole photographed population on Earth.  

Larsen There is an interesting tension between HELLO's linear format and what one could call its networked premise: it links people and reconnects events; it is open-ended, seeing that it has no obvious beginning and no logical endpoint; and like the network it upsets - or eclipses? - time, by bringing together different histories and events. The research process for HELLO was networked, too, seeing that each version of the work demanded that you be in touch with many people, and dive into numerous archives to piece it together. I remember how one critic got the piece entirely wrong and thought you had been ‘cutting and pasting' to bring about the work's many meetings. But there is no cheating, no collaging - HELLo is entirely based on existing and unmanipulated photos that you have copied and appropriated. You have credibly described the work as an immensely labour-intensive process, as a physical work of uncovering precisely that forgotten hard copy image required to link two others: “I thought of myself as a worm creating a small tunnel of oxygen in a world of otherwise dark compact soil.'2 Can you talk about your love for burrowing through archives, and the method or approach that you have applied in HELLo?  

Mir I started spending time in physical archives before the advent of the internet.  

It was simply the only way to do research. But today, Googling this or that every minute, I am even more assured by the uncontested value of the physical archive. The immediate access to the immensity of the internet fools us into believing that we can find ‘everything', when in fact we are merely able to scratch the surface in a really dull and predictable way. An internet search engine can in a split second generate an image of two celebrities or friends at a party, given that someone posted just that generic type of image, of course. But to find a rarity, an image that has been sitting in a folder, in a box, on a shelf, down a basement, in a library of an institution across the world from where I am physically located is something else. If I can get myself through all those layers and find an image which nobody has asked about for decades or even imagined could exist, as all human memory about it is lost; an image that has never been scanned and transferred to digits but that maintains its clarity, texture and the colours of its day - this comes from a completely different sort of desire, and if successful, becomes an extraordinary achievement, comparable to finding a treasure.  

Larsen It sounds like a meta-statement about photography when you say that HELLO encompasses the whole photographed population on Earth. What is the ethos, or perhaps better, the aesthetics of the meeting that HELLO creates, in its massage of the degrees of separation between people? And what role does photography play in this, as a medium and social practice?  

Mir When in 1989 I arrived at the School of Visual Arts in New York, one of the first people I met was a cheerful and slightly goofy student who would just hang out outside the main door to school on 23rd street and say 'Hello' to every random person who entered the building. When he greeted me, I asked his name, and he said, 'My name is Happy and my project is to meet everyone alive in this world.' It was funny, and I didn't take Happy very seriously at the time. Everyone I met was new and craving to connect and make friends so it didn't seem too strange what he was doing. The next two years in school were spent in intense learning. I had a world of art to experience and catch up with, I had to figure out how to survive in New York. I had a million things to do every day. I forgot all about Happy. I learned about photography and started to appreciate it as proof of its time, its making, the minutiae that it can carry and the biases of the photographer. By now I've travelled the world and built a career out of looking at and creating images. And nearly 25 years later, I think of Happy very often, imagining that he's still out there somewhere, consistently and economically, with Zen-like tranquility pursuing his project. A conscious influence or not, it would be hard not to give him some credit for my work with HELLO. His initial greeting at school was a blessing. [...]  

Larsen I don't know if you'll agree with me when I say that in the family of contemporary art, Alan Ruppersberg's work Where's $A l$ (1972)is a close relative to HELLo. Ruppersberg's piece consists of a number of Polaroids and index cards that relate the story of an artist who invents his own disappearance and the unexpected consequences for the friends who conspire to help him. It seems to me the two works share concerns about the nature of the memorial, the division between public and private, the parallelism of lives. But one can also ask: in HELLO, where is Al... eksandra? Do you appear in any of the versions of the work? And how do you seeyour role as an author in thiswork?  

Mir I've appeared in almost every installation of the work, as a cameo of sorts. I would credit this strategy to Alfred Hitchcock, always well known to me for appearing in films he directed, or even the mind-blowing “Where's Wally?' universe created by illustrator Martin Handford. But the most important reason for my cameo is that whenever I'd get desperate for a connection that would not present itself in images, no matter how much research I'd done, I would simply stage a photograph and use myself as a link in between people that could not have met otherwise. There's always the option to fall back on Happy's original proposal.  

# Tizianα Terranova Network Dynamics//2004  

# Of Grids and Networks  

The relation between the Internet and the production of space is, not by chance, crucial to all theoretical and analytical engagement with Internet culture. A feature of this engagement has been its insistence on such informational space as being somehow characterized by a dangerous distance from the world of the flesh and of physical spaces. If the early debate on information networks was dominated by the image of a Gibsonian cyberspace in which users would lose consciousness of the real world and lose themselves in a universe of abstract forms and disembodied perspectives, the contemporary debate has shifted onto the terrain of globalization. Where the most common image of cyberspace used to be that of a virtual reality environment characterized by direct interface and full immersion (data gloves, goggles, embedded microchips and electrodes), now the image is that of a common space of information flows in which the political and cultural stakes of globalization are played out. The debate on a transcendental cyberspace in opposition to the world of the flesh has developed its counterpart in a political discourse that opposed the homogeneous pull of the global to the heterogeneousworld of locality.  

For geographers such as Manuel Castells, for example, the network makes explicit the dynamics by which a globally connected elite is coming to dominate andcontrol thelives ofthosewhoremainbound totheworldof locality,thus reinforcing a‘structural domination of the space of flows over the space of places'.1 According to this perspective, in network societies the concrete time of places, bound to a specific mode of duration, is increasingly subsumed by the imperium of a single, electronic and global space accessible at the click of a mouse:‘the edge of forever or timeless time' Paul Virilio has argued for the opposite and specular case: information networks are annihilating space in favour of time (thus the Gulf Wars were global, not because they happened in a global space as did World War Il, but because they happened in global time, the single time or 'real time' of global television and the Internet). If world history is marked by a constant acceleration (from the age of horses and carriages to that of bullet trains and intercontinental missiles), the emergence of global information networks marks a limit point, as if with global communication we had hit a wall and started a detonation. Thus the simultaneity of actions has taken precedence over the succession of events and the world has been reduced to one unique time and space -‘an accident without precedent'.2 The time of the network is 'real time': everything happens simultaneously and thus fatalistically with a kind of after-the-event sense of inevitability.  

When we relate such allegations to the abstract technical diagrams that make anelectronic space suchas theInternet possible,wefind that theyseemto correspond to a specific aspect of its information architecture. To be locatable on the Internet,in fact,a machine/host/user needs tohave an address, and this addressneedstobeunequivocallysituatedwithinacommonaddressspace.This ecumenical function (the function of creating a single space) is performed by the Internet Protocol (IP) and the Domain Name System (DNS). This Internet Protocol has undergone a number of changes over the years but its main function has not really changed: it is the code that assigns to each machine an individual number. The Domain Name System associates each number with a cell in a table and also gives it a name. The DNS is thus an ideal single spatial map of the Internet, comprising a systemof unique addresses that makes eachIP-coded host and server locatable. Whenever we type an email address or a URL into the apposite program, we are to all effects referring to a specific address in this global,electronic map. This feature of the Internet design confirms the image of a distance between a world ofinformation and a world of embodied and bounded locality. Furthermore, this informational and electronic space, as it is constituted within this single map, appears as uncannily reminiscent of a modern dream for a completely homogeneous and controllable space. If we compare the Internet to a global city, with its addresses and neighbourhoods, its overall layout as expressed by the DNS database structure is hypermodernist. Its global electronic address space is structured like a grid of discrete locations - all of which from the point of view of the system have an equal probability of being accessed. In informational terms, that is, the Internet is in principle a highly entropic system (hence tendentially homogeneous) in as much as it can be entered at any point and each movement is in principle as likely as the next. In principle, that is, each Internet browser or file transfer protocol or email program is structurally free to jump to any street and house number whatsoever (to continue our urban analogy) In order to limit the demands posed on the technical system by such highentropiclevels of randomness and indetermination, the DNS protocol divides such single space through a limited number of top-level domains (.com, .org , .net, .edu, and the national domains, such as .uk, .au, etc) enclosing it, so to speak, at the top. Each domain is infinitely divisible: it is divided into a series of subdomains and each subdomain in its turn is potentially composed of an infinite number of smaller addresses, neatly branching out from its umbrella to identify individual users or machines, from servers to personal computers to all kinds of communication devices. (There is a movement to extend the IP protocol to Internet-connectable electric appliances and objects such as toasters, fridges and clothes.)  

At the same time, however, this abstract and homogeneous space of cells and grids is not completely devoid of any physical relation to locality. To this abstract space able to contain all possible addresses corresponds a concrete assemblage of technical machines, the DNS servers, which are arranged in a hierarchical structure. Thirteen root servers, ten of which are currently located in the UsA, two in Europe and one in Asia, for example, contain information about the next set of DNS machines, that is the authoritative name servers. There are as many authoritative name servers as there are domains and each one of them contains informationabout allthemachinesinthatdomain;thesameistruefor subdomains and so on. Thus, if the abstract Internet space is a grid in principle equally accessible from all points, in practice the speed and even, as we shall see, the trajectory by which we can actually get from A to B is determined by the relation and state of traffic between the servers, a relation that crucially includes the differential speeds of bandwidth and the‘weighting' of connections(where some nodes or cell-space assume centrality when compared to others). Finally, to the relatively centralized structure of the naming system corresponds a centralized governing body - a kind of global regulatory board. While the DNS was famously run for years and single-handedly by Internet pioneer Jon Postel, since his death it has been supervised by a non-profit organization, ICANN (Internet Corporation forAssigned Names and Numbers) - a corporation that has typically been the subject of heated controversies about accountability and democraticgovernance of theInternet.  

Anotherwayinwhichtheabstractspaceofthegridismodifiedand differentiated is through its relation to the semantic domain of the name (and specifically the semiotic economy of the brand name). The identification of IP addresses with names has introduced into Internet space the symbolic capital of brands- and hence has determined another differentiation at the heart of the universal information space, that of electronic real estate. Following the opening up of the Internet to commercial organizations,for example, the struggles around domain names have witnessed some spectacular lawsuits as corporations, speculators and activists looking for a fight rushed to get their hands on valuable names and addresses. Within the gridded space of the DNS, the brand re-emerges as a star, a centre of gravity, an identifiable name that guides the net surfer through the anonymous space of the IP number world. The tangled and heterogeneous meshwork that constitutes the Internet is thus not simply reconciled within the hieratic indifference of a universal information space, but also subjected to heated and controversial politicaldebates,expensive litigations and cultural struggles. The Domain Name System, then, is both single and universal, but also formed and deformed by locality. For Tim Berners-Lee, the legal disputes around names correspond to a friction between electronic space and local space, which is where the DNs, overall, can be said to exist.  

Trademark law assigns corporate names and trademarks within the scope of the physical location of businesses and the markets in which they sell. The trademark-law criterion of separation in location and market does not work for domain names, because the Internet crosses all geographic bounds and has no concept of market area, let alone one that matches the existing conventions in trademark laws.  

And yet, beyond the distortions introduced in the realm of Internet domains by the injection of symbolic capital, we cannot deny that at least in principle the Internet is organized through the figure of the grid and that this grid constitutes one of the most privileged references in theoretical understanding of electronic space. The grid is a fascinating figure and one with a particularly strong resonance within social and cultural theory, because of its strong association with the space of reason and modernity. The modernist grid, as defined by the intersection of two Cartesian axes, is a triumph of a mind able to extract a homogeneous and ordered space out of the ruggedness and heterogeneity of topological space. There is always something both utopian and dystopian about a grid. Whether it is a city plan, a prison layout or an accountant's spreadsheet, the grid is a principle of division and order, making possible the counting and location of things. If the Internet is ultimately reducible to a modernist form such as the grid, then the main movement that traverses it and organizes it is the vectorial movement of a tele-command. An electronic address does not simply indicate a location within cyberspace (I am $@$ anyplace) but also the possible movement of a direct line traced between two points. ( You can find me $@$ anytime. This document is at www.anyplace.org; you can find it there whenever). Information is divided and allocated a space, each node is assigned a unique number/name, and all information is instantly retrievable by way of a simple command line. Information is uploaded and downloaded as in a kind of electronic warehouse where new content is deposited and disposed of, deleted, updated, or simply left there to rot.  

The connection between different locales on the grid is activated by the telecommand - by the click of a link activating the server's call for a response by the corresponding machine. It is in this sense, as some have remarked, that the Internet might not be an immersive virtual reality, as the cyberpunks imagined it, but an alternative space existing 'at the edge of forever', as Manuel Castells put it. Cyberspace exists in the omni-equal distance that lies at the end of a mouse click. Regardless of the semantic differentiation of the IP address system, regardless of the geopolitical distribution of servers, within such a common informational plane a site in South Korea is ultimately within the same vectorial reach as a page in Rio.The whole planet feels as if it were compressed into the same virtual space just the other side of a computer screen, but it is as if such space was ultimately a static one, absorbing and neutralizing all differences on a single plane of communication.  

Within this understanding, the Internet is thus nothing more than an extended database, crossed by repeatable sequences of commands enabling the retrieval of documents located at different points in the planet. This chilling picture of a single information space, divided and distributed on a single grid containing all the possible addresses of all possible machines, underlines many of the more damning descriptions of the Internet and its relationship to the world of locality and embodiment. From this perspective, the single information space is an extension of a modern instrumental rationality driving towards the ultimate goal of the disappearance of the irreducible heterogeneous in the homogeneous space of the global network. The Internet thus appears to give form to a space of connections without transformations, where vectors of communication link up different electronic spaces outside of any real possibility for becoming. But does the database structure really exhaust all aspects of network communication? Or does an over-reliance on the database model blind us to the more dynamic aspects of the Internet diagram and its relation to networkcultureassuch?  

# The Paradox of Movement  

The debate about space and time in the age of communication is not necessarily limited to the Internet as such but is a variation on the larger theme of cultural globalization. A communication technology such as the Internet participates in the emergence of a globalized culture, following and expressing the fractal folds of a spatiality that twists and knots together different scales of interaction - the local and the global, but also the regional and the national. In as much as the Internet is an informational diagram, form here should not be understood in the sense of a mould, imprinting its stamp on a world of locality already weakened by decades of global popular culture. The Internet informs a globalized planet by reproducing some of its most individuated and stable forms as well as its potential to diverge, to pass over into new formations through the combined power of the fluctuation and the mutation.  

Physicists such as Duncan J. Watts and Albert Laszlo Barabasi, for example, have mapped ‘the small worlds' of networks in terms of a relation between 'structure'and'dynamics'3Within the samefield,SteveLawrence and Lee Giles at the NEC Research Institute in Princeton have produced a model of the Web, based on the data, brought back by a meta-search engine or robot, about its size and topology. In this way, they have reconstructed the virtual geography of the World Wide Web by mapping the number of links that connect different websites to each other. Replicating an action that search engines carry out all the time, algorithms have been let loose on the network to come back with a picture not only of how many pages and sites are actually out there on the Web, but also of the overall movement of information flowswithin the network.This approach downplays the links to locality (mapping the global distribution of Internet access) for an internal snapshot of the web world. The researchers thus looked not only for the number of pages and their location in the DNS grid (as a search engine bot would do), but also for the overall map drawn by the active movement of the link.  

The result is a kind of parallel global map of an informational planet, produced on the basis of outgoing and incoming links, mapping the directed movement linking sites to sites. One such map pictured the informational space of the webplanet through the topology of continents, archipelagos and islands.4 It mapped the gravitational pulls of portals and brands (at the heart of the core continents lie all the major websites - the likes of Yahoo, MSN, Google, the CNN and BBC - which collected the largest number of incoming links) and also the existence of peripheral information land masses, tied to a central core, but also independent from it. Beyond these massive continents signalling a centralization of Internet traffic, they pictured a sprinkling of small archipelagos made up of web sites that connect only to each other, and large info-islands which corresponded to Gibson's Black Ice - the firewalls hiding the high-security intranetworks of military and financial institutions. At the same time, the researchers admit that it was hard to claim that their map of web space is exhaustive - in as much as a great number of web sites appear to be off the radar. If the portals act as centripetal forces of attraction in an unstable and disorienting network space, producing the effect of an informational land mass,this does not exclude the existence of other movements of divergence and disconnection, which characterize, for example, the choice of some groups to communicate only with each other within a closed network of sites shielded from outside access by obscure addresses or corporate firewalls. In this sense, the global appears as a site of accumulation of resources that manifests itself as a mass, which distorts the homogeneous informational milieu by exercising a kind of gravitational pull that draws in other spatial scales (such as national or regional) to itself. Any interface with the medium, therefore, implies some kind of relation to such centripetal movement.  

On the other hand, however, this centripetal and homogenizing pull of the global mass is not the only movement active within the Internet as an informational milieu. In this sense, we can draw a useful parallel with the debate on globalization. If a structural domination of the space of flows(the global) over that of places (the local） exists, together with attendant forms of cultural imperialism, it is one that does not deny the fluidity of places as such, their constitution as local reservoirs endowed with a productive capacity for difference. The study of global popular culture in the 1990s has gone some way towards mapping some of the features of this 'virtual global. When seen spatially, a global culture has often appeared as split between the opposing pulls of homogenizing (global) and heterogenizing (local) forces. The relationship between the opposing poles of the global and the local has been shown to produce all kinds of mutant cultural forms - ranging from familiar patterns of pseudo-individuation (the French McDonald's as distinct from the American McDonald's, as depicted in the memorable dialogue between John Travolta and Samuel Jackson in Pulp Fiction), to more complex nonlinear dynamics of mutual feedback (as in the relationship between the cinemas of Hong Kong and Hollywood).  

If the local, in fact, were nothing but a reservoir of frozen differences; if the global were only the homogenizing pull of the likes of McDonald's, Microsoft and Coca-Cola; if the Internet were nothing but an electronic grid or database where all locations lie flat and movement is mainly that of vectors of fixed length but variable position linking distant locations to a few centres - where would the potential for struggle and change, becoming and transformation come from? In the case of the Internet, for example, where would its dynamism come from? How can we reconcile the grid-like structure of electronic space with the dynamic features of the Internet, with the movements of information? How do we explain chain mails and list serves, web logs and web rings, peer-to-peer networks and denial-ofservice attacks? What about the rising clutter of information, the scams and the spam, the endless petitions, the instantaneous diffusion of noise and gossip, the network as permanent instability? It is possible, that is, that by thinking of the Internet in terms of the grid we might have fallen into a classic metaphysical trap: that of reducing duration to movement, that is, of confusing time with space.

# Ned Rossiter Organized Networks: Transdisciplinarity and New InstitutionalForms//2006  

The social-technical dynamics of ICT [information communications technology]- based networks constitute organization in ways substantively different from networked organizations (unions, state, firms, universities). My interest in this paper is to say a few things about the process of scalar transformation and transdisciplinarity as they relate to the invention of new institutional forms. Having established these background conditions, processes and practices, I will then move on to the topic of autonomous education.  

Institutions function to organize social relations. It follows, then, that the social-technical dynamics peculiar to a range of digital media technologies (mailing lists, collaborative blogs, wilkis, content management systems) institute new modes of networked sociality. It is easy to dismiss this process of emergent institutionalization. Many would assert thatit simply results in abureaucratization and rigidity of social-technical communication systems whose default setting is one of flows, decentralization, horizontality, etc. I would suggest such knee-jerk, technically incorrect responses risk a disengagement from the political and thus from politics. There is a passivity that attends this kind of position. Moreover, it is a position that fails the politics of reappropriating the psychic, social and semiotic territory of institutions. The process of instituting networks involves a movement toward the strategic rather than tactical dimension of net politics. Another reason to turn towards the strategic dimension has to do with the shorttermism that accompanies many tactical projects. The logic of the tactic is one of situated intervention. And then it disappears. There are of course some notable exceptions - Indymedia, Makrolab and the Yes Men come to mind as quite longterm experiments in networks and tactical media; yet these exceptions are not, I would suggest, instances of transdisciplinarity.  

The practice of transdisciplinarity preconditions the invention of new institutional forms. As Gary Genosko notes of the meta-methodology of Félix Guattari, transdisciplinarity is predicated on experiments in institutional formation.! In the case of organized networks, transdisciplinarity is constituted by 'the political',by the tensions that underpin cross-sectoral, multi-institutional engagements that make possible new modes and new forms of research. Transdisciplinaritycanbedistinguishedfrom interdisciplinaryormultidisciplinary research. Despite all the claims in OECD reports and government and university policy rhetoric on research, interdisciplinarity is not about networks but rather clusters, and typically takes place in ‘private and public labs and research centres'2 Such settings, and the institutional and political-economic conditions which shape interdisciplinary research, also result in another key difference with trandisciplinarity. Interdisciplinarity rests within the regime of intellectual property, which operates as an architecture of control. As such, the knowledge produced is locked up and contained; it refuses the social relations that make possible the development of intellectual action, and it therefore refuses the potential for social transformation because of the way knowledge is enclosed within a property relation.  

This is not to dispense with tactics, since tactics are the source of renewal. Interestingly enough, tactics parallel the logic of capital. We see this operation historically time and again. Just consider core-periphery relations and the ways in which capital has to incorporate or appropriate the margins in order to replenish and reproduce itself. Such movements are similar to what Brian Holmes spoke of as the cooptation of the productive efforts of the artist, cultural critic, designer.3 It's therefore important to remember that autonomists are not somehow located outside the state but rather operating as disruptive potentiality, whose difference is defined by relations of negation, refusal, exodus, subtraction, etc. Certainly there areimportant qualitative differences in the relation individuals and peoples have with the state. Think, for instance, of the experience of migrants and so-called illegal movement of peoples across territories, or the precarious worker. Precarity, let's remember, is an experience that traverses a range of class scales, and may even be considered as a post-Fordist technique of border control that distinguishes ‘self-managed exploitation ... from those who must be exploited (or worse) by direct coercion'.4  

So while the organized network has a relative institutional autonomy, by necessityit mustengage otherinstitutional partners who may oftenbeopposed to the interests of networks. Organized networks share something with NGOs [nongovernmental organizations], CsOs [central statistics organizations] and even think-tanks. Yet there is a radical dissimilarity and qualitative difference between organized networks and these other institutional forms. Take NGOs and CsOs, for example, and the techniques of governance adopted throughout the Wsis [World Summit on the Information Society] process. Within any partnership there is of course a compromise. In order to obtain the necessary discursive legitimacy required to participate within the institutional settings of WSIS, NGOs and CSOs had to engage a model of organization that was antithetical to the self-organizing logic of networks. NGOs and CsOs were thus required to adopt the representational form known throughout WSIS as 'multistakeholderism' - the primary model of governance for managing, if not realizing,relations between business, government and civil society. Multistakeholderism is predicated on representative models of liberal democracy, and such abstraction always refers to itself and thus frequently conflicts with the grass-roots networks that characterize the constituent dimension of NGOs and CsOs. Representation does not correspond with the logic of networks, which are better understood as non-representational forms of politics.  

In saying this I do not wish to valorize the horizontality of networks. The tendency of networks to be described in terms of horizontality results in an occlusion of 'the political', which consists of antagonisms that underpin sociality. As I have discussed on other occasions, it is technically and socially incorrect to assume that hierarchical and centralizing architectures and practices are absent from net cultures. At the technical level, one only has to look at the debates surrounding the information society and internet governance: hierarchical and political-economic aspects of assigning domain names, location of root servers, politics of IPRs [international property rights], uneven geography of information flows, determination of standards, effects of trade agreements on content production and distribution, etc. The hierarchical dimension to networked sociality is easy to account for: just consider the cohort of alpha males scheming in the back rooms of so many organizational forms. Even in the case of wikis, which on the surface appear to be exemplary non-representational forms in so far as labour on content production is anonymous, again we need only to venture through the backdoor to see the ringleaders at work. Of course the technical and socialaspectsofICTnetworksarenotmutuallyexclusive,butratherinterpenetrate one another in a plethora of ways. A challenge for organized networks is thus to addressthesoftwareproblem and thesocial problem.  

The collaborative interest of organized networks is to consider what the scalar transformation of organized networks entails vis-a-vis the aggregation of educational resources distributed within and across networks. Networks have been fantastic at developing educational resources such as documentation of open source software, university course materials, health-care information, tips on political organization, etc. Obviously there's a lot to learn from NGOs and the revival of union organizing as seen in the Justice for Janitors movement. Certainly my position is not to dismiss these institutional forms outright. A focus on educational resources strikes me as a matter of tactics that feed strategic interests. Without the tactical, organized networks collapse into stasis. Here it is necessary to recognize the situation of informational politics. Paradoxically, perhaps, neoliberalism - with its logic of outsourcing, privatization and dissembling institutional frameworks - conditions the possibility of organized networks. Just as NGOs and CsOshavefilled thevoid created by theneoliberal state's evacuation from the social, so too must organized networks seize upon the institutional persona of the‘external provider'.  

What I am suggesting, then, is for networks to intervene in the market of higher education. The university is a vulnerable institution actually. It is quite uncertain, and indeed could becharacterizedas a place ofprecarity.As many have experienced, the labour force of universities is predominantly composed of casual workers whose seasonal pattern of employment resembles that of the strawberry picker. Unions typically fail to represent the interests of casual workers, since their interest is to protect the security of those with tenured positions.  

As far as I can determine, an intervention into the education market is one of the few ways in which organized networks may obtain economic autonomy, which depends upon securing an economic base. Without this, organized networks have little chance of sustainability and little possibility of scalar transformation. There is a capacity for networks to mobilize their resources in transversal ways in the form of master classes, summer schools and training programmes that operate both internally to and externally from universities. Universities are undergoing a process of losing their expertise, their ability to bring in new knowledge and to transform the disciplines, which have become incredibly rigid and dull. Universities can be characterized by their deficiency of thought. They don't know how to move themselves in ways that incorporate what Gregory Bateson called 'the difference that makes a difference'. The strange thing is that neoliberalism makes possible the difference that makes a difference. This is the perversity of neoliberalism. The structural logic of neoliberalism makes possible openings, and openings invite interventions that begin to enable the financing of autonomous, precarious, experimental research and teaching that shows no sign of being catered for in current OECD, government and universitypolicy directives.  

My proposal can be easily criticized for appropriating the outside - the experimental elements that so often energize networks on the frontline of invention - and closing it down again. This is the classiccritique of appropriation. We see this most obviously in the fashion industries. Remember punk? If you wanted,you could pay 2o0 bucks for a pair of jeans with a rip in them. Hilariously, there was no shortage of idiots who went out and purchased their damaged goods. The same can be said about knowledge. What functions against the closure of minds and resources is the fact that educational business projects undertaken by a network of networks is predicated on principles of open source software, society and culture. Obviously there will be fights over how best to redistribute funds within and across networks. But that's a matter that can be sorted out. Having said this, a problem remains. There is only so much free labour that can be done within the networks. Certainly it helps networks to have a parasitical relation with networked organizations (universities, for example). But eventually free labour exhausts itself.  

# Noortje Marres There is Drama in Networks//2007  

[...]Lately networks are increasingly being moved onto the front stages of public life. We live in a time in which partnership networks, collaborative networks, stakeholder networks, and so on, are officially launched and showcased at symposiums and exhibitions and on the Web. Especially since the social integration of the Internet, networks are increasingly documented, traced and presented in publicly accessible media. Thus, while many networks may still be obscure and informal, networks are increasingly being adopted as public forms of organization. It is in this context of the ‘front-staging' of networks that their ill-suitedness for hosting social and political dramas becomes particularly noticeable and problematic.After the coming out of networks as a public form of organization, the informality and relative amorphousness of what goes on there persists in some respects.  

Thus social and political networks can easily seem lacking in terms of ritual. Networks are obviously teeming with scripts, in terms of the shared formats and templates on which their formation and maintenance depends. But social interaction in networks tends to be lacking in ceremony. Actors enter a network as easily as they leave it, with a simple 'Hi' and an equally simple 'See you later' (or not). That social and political networks appear to be short on dramatic script also becomes noticeable in attempts to make networks readable. Network analysts as well as network analysis software have a habit of translating networks into ranking lists by counting links, hits and keyword occurrences. And so the major events of network life can seem to consist of little more than movements up and down, and on and off, these lists. Such events do not seem sufficient for generating dramatic plot, which requires, for instance, the possibility of role inversion, where the underdog may prove to be right after all, and the sweet old lady might turn out to be an assassin. Networks can thus appear to favour undramatic forms of interaction: links are either made or unmade; nodes are either part of the network or not, occupy either a central position or an isolated one, and participate actively in the dialogue or not. That can seem to be all there is to success or failure in a network universe.  

Second, the capacity of networks fcr hosting social and political dramas appears hampered by the fact that they promote a certain indifference with regard to setting. The problem is certainly not that they present completely delocalized forms of organization. As mentioned, networks regularly coalesce in particular settings, from conferences and dinners to festivals. Moreover, social and political networks often organize around specific entities residing at particular sites. By way of example, much of the attention of human-rights networks is focused on prisons and refugee camps. Networks descend on particular places all the time, and they are often dedicated to the staging of in situ events. However, they can be distinguished from other forms of organization in terms of their relatively opportunistic relation tolocation.Oneof the strongerideals of networkinteraction is that they can be accessed 'anywhere, anytime'. In this sense networks stand for the capacity of actors to relocate to any setting that is relevant to their purposes at a particular point in time. As such, they enable a mode of action that does not actually depend on any particular setting but merely adapts places to its purposes, whichever location is on offer. To the extent that dramatic performance depends on the commitment of actors, and of the action, to a specific setting, this does not exactly enhance the dramatic potential of networks.  

If we now view the rise of networks as forums for politics in light of Edmund Burke's proposition that modern politics is essentially a dramatic performance, we arrive at [a] troubling diagnosis [...]. As politics migrates into networks, some of the conditions for the successful enactment of politics may be effectively undermined. Importantly, such a performative critique of networks does not make the argument that the action of politics here withdraws onto the backstages of political life, into obscure and informal linkages that resist dramatization. Rather, the problem is that the dramatic organization of political life is undermined as a backstage form of organization is increasingly adopted for the performance of “frontstage' politics. However, it cannot go unnoticed that this diagnosis relies on particular assumptions about what a network is as well as about what the drama of politics consists of. In the argument that follows, I would like to show that these assumptions are at least as problematic as the organizational form of the networks seems to be. If we reconsider the features of social and political networks, and if we fine-tune the understanding of politics as dramatic performance on a number of points, we may reach a different diagnosis.  

# The Dramatic Effects of Networks  

Two reconsiderations - one relating to the role of media in the staging of politics and another to the nature of political networks - are able to change almost everything about the critical diagnosis of the merits of networks for the staging of political drama.  

The first reconsideration has to do with the idea that performative politics covers most aspects of social life. Erving Goffman's performative theory of social life grants strikingly little attention to publicity media, even if he was developing his theory in the late 1950s, a time of emerging media. Erving Goffman has always maintainedthat his characterizations of social life as dramaticperformance only work for interactions in confined settings. However, as the British sociologist John Thompson has suggested, the proliferation of recording and broadcasting technologies has played a crucial role in recent decades in extending the domain of political performance to include social practices. Not only is the range of sites of political performances radically extended as a consequence of proliferating media, but because of the ubiquitous presence of microphones, lenses, screens and speakers across social life, any place, from a supermarket to a shooting range can come to serve as a setting for public performance.  

It could also be argued that in this context political events increasingly take the form of the public staging of informal “backstage' occurrences. That is, in the context of proliferating media technologies, the displacements of behind-thescenes occurrences onto the stages of publicity seem to constitute a major ingredient of political events. A media-sensitive account of the extension of the settings of political performance to include social practices differs from the classic sociological thesis on one major point: a sociological approach like Goffman's grants central importance to setting and situated interaction as constitutive of dramatic performance. A media-oriented perspective, on the other hand, highlights the importance of technological networks for the transformation of social practices into performative events. From this standpoint, this transformation is principally enabled by the integration of networked media technologies into social life. This is what enables the recording and wide circulation of social events, and thus their articulation as (potentially) public performances.  

A second reconsideration has to do with the nature of the drama that is staged in political performances. Performative theories of social and political life tend to locate the sources of drama in the enactments themselves. It is to the extent that the setting works for the performance, the script provides effective constraints on action, and the actors know their roles that a dramatic performance is achieved. Such an account of dramatic enactment also makes sense considering what performative theories assume to be the point of performative politics. Simply put, the main point often seems to be a good show. The Burkean understanding of performative politics foregrounds the production of an aura of authority, and this is largely accomplished by the show itself. The same applies when performative politics is said to be about the establishment of identities, or the distribution of agency among actors.  

To these situationist understandings of performative politics, we can oppose political theories that locate the sources of the dramas staged in politics elsewhere, beyond the performative settings of politics strictly speaking. One such theory is the pragmatist theory of politics developed by the American philosopher John Dewey. His theory is particularly relevant for the problematics under discussion here, in so far as Dewey explicitly sought to take into account the constraints on politics in the age of networks. He developed a concept of politics for industrial societies, that is, those that include factories, trains, telephones and the radio. Crucially, Dewey proposed that in these societies, the entanglement of actors in sociotechnical networks constitutes a principal source of political drama.  

In Dewey's account, politics must be understood in light of a particular type of political affectivity that is generated in industrial societies: the type of affectivity that emerges when social actors are adversely affected by their entanglement in extensive networks of manufacture, trade, transport and communication. A distinctive characteristic of these networks is that they may intimately affect social actors, while at the same time extending beyond their control. They proliferate below the radar and/or beyond the action radius of these actors, as well as of political institutions. In this situation, the affects generated by 'network affectedness' may take on a political aspect. It becomes necessary for social actors to organize into political collectivities, as this is the onlyway to ensure thatnetwork effects are addressed.  

Like the social theory of media, the philosophy of John Dewey suggests that we can only make sense of politics in post-industrial societies if we attend to the sociotechnical networks that extend across social life. Dewey's political theory proposes to do this in two ways. First of all, it invites a shift in attention away from the scenes of political action towards distributed processes of the formation of political collectivities. If, as Dewey suggests, the entanglement of social actors in networks constitutes a prime source of political affectivity, then the configuration of these actors into political collectivities emerges as a crucial political event. This is where political affectivity starts flowing. Dewey proposes that political collectivities, which he calls publics, exist primarily as network phenomena. In his account, actors come to participate in political collectivities to the extent that they are jointly affected by the distributed effects of network entanglement. It means that the actors who make up a political assemblage, at least in the first instance, are connected to one another by little else but the entanglement effects in which they share.  

In this respect, Dewey's concept of the public has affinities with the one developed by the French social psychologist Gabriel Tarde. He coined the notion of the dispersed public. For Tarde, modern society had produced a new type of public: as opposed to the crowd, whose political excitement derives from physical proximity, the modern public consists of a dispersed set of readers whose political passions stem primarily from sharing in the same information flows, produced by daily media. In Tarde's account, however, these dispersed publics are principally held together by the spiritual bonds that are produced by symbolic communication. By contrast, Dewey's publics are held together by ontological connections: by the physical, material, economic and legal ties that sustain actors' livelihoods and that are adversely affected by their entanglement in wider networks. Here, the affects of politics are generated to the extent that actors' entanglement in extensive networks disrupts their ways of life physically, technically, materially, legally and economically.  

A second important suggestion that is implied in Dewey's political theory follows from this. This is the suggestion that the dramas of politics at least partly play themselves out in sociotechnical networks. In Dewey's account, after all, network entanglement is a principal source of political affectivity. As a consequence, the connections by means of which people are implicated in the extensive entanglements of post-industrial life here come to the fore as central ingredients of political drama. Unfortunately, Dewey does not make clear how exactly these connections participate in the production of political drama. But we could say that political affectivity is generated when people's attachments are demonstrated to intertwine in disturbing ways. People's concerns, their anger, enthusiasm, commitment and frustration, take on a political aspect when the connections that sustain their livelihoods are endangered in particular ways: when they are threatened by entanglement with the attachments of strangers.  

Thus, in the particularly complex tangle of connections that come together in the issue of climate change, attachments can be seen to intertwine in various antagonistic ways. In the context of this issue, attachments to the seasons and attachments to motorized transport endanger one another. Attachments to agricultural practices are threatened by attachments to global travel. And so on. These antagonisms among attachments cannot be contained within individuals or within social groupings. This is why the affects that arise with threats to attachments here take on a political aspect. Here, actors'livelihoods, in the broad sense of the word, are put at stake by their interconnections with those of strangers. Importantly, such an‘ontological' account of politics yields a different concept of political drama than the performative theories discussed above.  

We could say that a pragmatistically informed, ontologically oriented account of politics opens up a post-performative understanding of the drama of politics. This is because from this perspective, political drama can no longer be equated with political performance. The possibility of political performances must now be said to depend on their ability to draw on and mobilize the type of dramatic threats to attachments described above. A post-performative approach to politics, then, involves two shifts in the understanding of political drama.  

To begin with, whereas classic performative theories provide actor-oriented accounts of social and political life, a post-performative approach to politics favours an issue-oriented account. The equation of drama with performance made sense, we can now say, because of the actor orientation of classic performative theories. As mentioned, Goffman's performative theory explained social life in terms of the efforts social actors make to establish identities for themselves. Critical theories of performative politics are principally concerned with the distribution of agency among actors. The classic Burkean idea of politics as essentially a theatrical performance is heavily invested in the ideal of the demonstration of authority. This idea does not necessarily entail an actororiented understanding of politics: authority in the Burkean framework is first of all an attribute of regimes and orders. But leadership here does figure as the indispensable conduit of authority.  

A pragmatist approach to politics is not principally concerned with the question of whether actors succeed in performing a role they desire for themselves. From this perspective, the drama of politics does not revolve around the establishment of actors' authority, or with the articulation of their identities. Rather, we must focus on the matters at stake in politics, if we are to make sense of the drama of politics. Political performances are dramatic to the extent that they thematize the looming and unspecified threats that entanglement poses to people's attachments. Politics can then be understood in terms of the more or less successful dramatization of issues.  

This is also to say that a post-performative approach to politics does not mean political dramas no longer need to be staged. To get a sense of extensive entanglements with strangers obviously requires articulation. A distinguishing feature of these connections is that they extend beyond the familiar experiences of actors. And the mutual endangerment of attachments must be dramatized if it is to operate as a force of political organization. However, an ontologically inspired understanding of politics can still be called post-performative to the extent that action here no longer constitutes the central political category. Or at least the notion of action is radically transformed. 'Network entanglement' refers to a situation in which agency is radically distributed, to the point that it is not clear who or what is doing the acting.  

Thus, there is no end to the list of entities that can be evoked to explain the rush by companies, governments, NGOs and people all over the world to embrace renewable energy technologies. Is this about rising energy prices? Shrinking glaciers in the Himalayas disturbing water supplies in Northern India? A new geopolitics of energy dependency?A hype that makes everyone jump on the bandwagon? In situations of extensive entanglement, such as the one opened up by climate change, we do not quite know what or who is performing the action. The relations among entities are too weak to be describable in clear causal terms; there are too many of them for it to be possible to record, disentangle and weigh them all; but they are too strong to be ignored.  

A second way in which the category of action becomes problematic in conditions of extensive entanglement is that here affectedness does not, as a matter of course, translate into purposeful action. In this context, it is far from self-evident that the affects of fear,enthusiasm and frustration can be transformed into a performance of support for or resistance against specific political projects. The situation of network entanglement seems marked, in this respect, by a shortage of agency. The relations that entanglement in networks open up tend to be extensive, distributed and relatively obscure, and so it is far from obvious how intervention in such entanglements can come about. Rather than the performance of action, the main challenge here seems to be, at least in the first instance, the dramatization of affectedness.  

One crucial feature of such dramatizations is, it seems to me, that they may be capable of amplifying the affective charges of the social, material and technical attachments by means of which people are implicated in issues. One example is It's Not Too Late, a climate-change project by the French branch of Greenpeace. The face of a young woman appeared on various screens in the streets of central Paris, speaking of ecological disasters. As she talks about the heatwave of 2005, with a heavy flow of traffic in the street below, certain connections may click. The endless stream of cars may become heavy, with the threat of the weather becoming increasingly unbearable. Importantly, the talking head captures actors as entangled beings: people in the Parisian streets do not just constitute an audience; they are drivers caught up in the routine of commuting and pedestrians' breathing of fumes.This dramatization involves a disruption of‘impression management' at the level of the physical habits of everyday life: this is not just a traffic jam, but our persistent indifference to what cars do to the climate.  

If it works, the insertion in the urban traffic environment of a screen that speaks about the climate does not only activate antagonistic entanglements - the conflict between attachments to driving and attachments to bearable summers. If it works, these screens are also able to intensify the affects of issue affectedness and to multiply the connections, carrying these charges further. These effects are of an unknown extension: the range of connections that are, could and should be caught up in the issue entanglement of climate change is open-ended. But indefinite extension, as Gabriel Tarde pointed out, is precisely a distinguishing feature of the public. This is where publics derive much of their force: from the possible threat of mobilization that is held open by their open-endedness. [...]  

# Geert Lovink Orgnets in Practice//2011  

[...] One of the few yet unexplored models left for new media culture is that of networking itself. If networks are here to stay, we must take them more seriously and radicalize their shape. Networks are still seen as secondary, informal platforms for interpersonal expression. Instead of focusing on the 'network organization' - an instrumental view of networks as tools for organizations, social movements or business to exchange information and experiences - we should gain a better understanding of ‘organized networks', a concept which I have developed with Ned Rossiter since 2005. These emerging 'organized networks' aim to cooperate in order to realize projects, write software, and, in short, produce cultural artefacts. Whereas network organizations are more loosely connected and form slightly non-committal ties, aimed at ‘recharging the batteries' through information sharing and inspirational talks, the term'organized networks'is more transformative by moving the production of culture onto the Net, and so changing the very mode of organization itself. Active development of concepts like this responds to a lack of necessary terms. As Simon Critchley writes: Politics is always about nomination. It's about naming a political subjectivity and organizing politically around that name. According to Critchley, we should not pin our hopes on ontology but \*[try] to conceive forms of gathering, coalition and association in relation to a more wild and formless social being'. The nomination I discuss here comes from the world of network technologies. Why contemporary thinkers overlook this vital part of contemporary life is remarkable, but that's another matter.  

Organized networks, or'orgnets,' are new institutional forms of collaboration that arise after the process of digitization and informatization has reached completion. As an area of research it focuses on the potentially productive tension between decentralization and institutionalization. Much like the shifting relationship between social movements and NGOs ten to fifteen years ago, we see increasing tension between existing models of ‘cultural organizations' promoting new media, culture and arts, and informal networks of individual artists. Unlike a decade ago, the cultural new media sector can no longer claim to embody an 'avant-garde' position, because the avant-garde has been taken over by the market. This situation leaves a void: neither truly innovative nor particularly critical, new media organizations in the non-profit sector are confused. What direction should they take? If they are not conducting proper research considered useful by policymakers and academics, then what is their role? Now that the introductory phase of new media is coming to an end, should they simply do without public funding and disappear? The well-funded massive digitization of ‘cultural heritage' has proven useless for the new media sector and merely reproduces the existing, conservative cultural landscape dominated by museums,opera and concert halls. The same could be said of 'media wisdom' programmes in the educational sector, which are merely run to 'manage' (read: control) the already high computer literacy amongst youngsters as well as the ignorance and paranoia of parents and teachers.  

Instead of aligning with the'creative industries' agenda, current organizational models must transform into facilitating hubs that empower organized networks. Rather than further exploring (and exploiting) weak ties, organized networks seek stronger bonds within smaller units that emerge out of peer-to-peer encounters.Instead of complaining about the decline of commitment, we'd better start designing tighter structures that can facilitate and coordinate collaborative work on cultural, political and educational projects. In the same way, we should stop using volunteer labour and justify payment to (emerging) professionals by developing alternative revenue models and currency systems. What are the protocols that structure organized networks? What are the modalities of self-organization? How can organized networks scale up? And how sustainable are these networks, presuming that they will not, for the time being, have access to ordinary (financial) resources?  

The orgnet concept stems from an active, dynamic environment that generates more questions than can possibly be answered. Activists organize transnational campaigns online, and Web 2.0 companies profit from the free labour and attention provided by the networks of users. If we take these network technologies seriously,we have to ask ourselves: what's next after all the initial excitement? Will networking produce a dispersed, weak level of sociality or will relationships become more substantial? What long-term cultural transformations might emerge from networked interactions? How can networks maintain their critical edge, while aiming for professional status? Was the content produced in the context of free culture' really meant to be distributed for no cost,or was this done because 'free' was the only option? Will we return to our busy everyday life after the hype recedes or strive for an even deeper commitment to Social 2.o? As artists, researchers, activists, educators and cultural workers are drawn into the network paradigm, it is urgent to enquire collectively into what happens when networks become the driving force of both work and leisure. Even if networks do not replace real existing office culture, how will they transform cultural organizations?  

Instead, we propose to implement independent sources of income and types of organizations that reflect the ‘network condition' in which cultural workers find themselves. Living under the omen of neoliberal capitalism, messy everyday life already offers us prefab ideologies, but we can also be open to new strategic designs. Network architectures express a freedom of choice, and their layout of the social aspects are vague possibilities to (re-)connect. The freedom to move from one city or professional field to the next is both liberating and distressing, implying both the risks and the pleasures of roaming. How do we balance the desire to move on with the justified struggle to defend rights and resources? The pressure ruthlessly to self-promote while practising vulnerable ‘self-disclosure' on social networking sites is a similar dilemma. Subscribing to networks is no longer a choice. Many of the 'precarious' culture workers feel they must sign up and join groups, lists and professional networks, such as Linkedln, since online social networking turns out to become a vital part of the reproduction of work. In this McJob era, artists and culture workers must prepare a range of parallel projects that may or may not become realized as paid labour. This is why it is not morally wise to dismiss participation on corporate platforms such as Facebook and Twitter - though a better idea is actively to promote distributed alternative social networking software based on free software and open-source principles.  

One should recognize the actual force of the ideology of free and open as advocated by some in the free culture' movement as a potential trap. Embrace Creative Commons, open content, free software and open access, but only if they become part of a larger movement that experiments with (alternative) revenue models. In this respect we also need a new notion of the public domain, and public broadcasting in particular, in which new media have an equal status with film, public radio, television and print. Barcamps, unconferencing, booksprints, hackathons, contentfests and bricolabs are all manifestations of a thriving culture of temporary media labs. Rather than asking how these emergingpractices might contribute to 'policy', we should reverse this question: how can cultural policies strengthen networks? One of the steps we need to take is to understand networking as a cultural logic at odds with current democratic mechanisms. Networks start from a post-representational position. A network cannot claim to speak on anyone's behalf other than its own constituents. [...]  

# Hito Steyerl Digital Debris: Spam and Scam//2011  

There is hardly a more famous watercolour thanPaul Klee's Angelus Novus(1920) Walter Benjamin described its figure as a hapless creature, helplessly carried away by the storm of progress, while staring backwards at the ever-growing rubble heap of history.1 Benjamin's aphorism is well known and quite overquoted, but it has a surprising consequence if we take its spatial arrangement seriously.  

For there is no rubble depicted in the drawing. This doesn't mean, however, that there is no rubble at all. Since the angel faces us as spectators, and - according to Benjamin - also faces the rubble, the wreckage must be located in the hors-champ of the drawing. The rubble is in our place. Or, to take it one step further: we, the spectators, might actually be the rubble. We might be the debris of history, those who somehow made it intact but not unscathed through thetwentieth century.We have become discarded objects and useless commodities caught in the gaze of a shell-shocked angel who drags us along as it is blown into incertitude.  

Yet the debris caught in the angel's stare might take on a different form today. Are rubble and wreckage not outdated notions for an age in which information can be copied supposedly without loss and is infinitely retrievable and restorable? What would refuselooklike in a digitalage that prides itselfon theindestructibility and seamless reproducibility of its products, an age in which information presumably has become immune to the passing of time? Aren't the scars of history signs of an analogue age, one which is irrevocably over? Hasn't history itselfbeenwornout?  

No: history is not over. Its wreckage keeps on piling sky high, Moreover, digital technologies provide additional possibilities for the creative wrecking and degradation of almost anything. They multiply options for destruction, corruption and debasement. They are great new tools for producing, cloning and copying historical debris. Amplified by political and social violence, digital technologies have become not only midwives of history but also its (plastic) surgeons.  

Despite its apparently immaterial nature, digital wreckage remains firmly anchored within material reality. One of its contemporary manifestations is the toxic recycling city of Guiyu in China, where mainboards and hard disks are being scavenged and groundwater is poisoned. In the digital age, debris is composed not only of destroyed buildings, torn concrete and decaying steel, although digitalized warfare, the computerization of production, and real-estate speculation produce these items in abundance. Digital wreckage is both material and immaterial; it is data-based debris with a tangible physical component.  

There is hardly any better example of such digital debris than spam.2 Far from being the exception in online communication, spam is actually the rule. Around 80 per cent of today's email messages are spam. It forms the bulk of digital writing, its essence. And it, too, has a firm grasp on reality. Far from being secondary and accidental, spam is a substantial expression of a period that has elevated superfluity into one of its guiding principles.  

To complete Benjamin's spatial equation: if the angel looks at us, we must be rubble. And if at present rubble means spam, this is the label that the angel bestows on us today.  

# You Shall Be Spam  

Pharmacy 81 per cent Replica 5.4 per cent Enhancers 2.3 per cent Phishing 2.3 per cent Degrees 1.3 per cent Casino 1 per cent Weight Loss 0.4 per cent Other 6.3 per cent.3  

The contemporary use of ‘spam' for unwanted electronic bulk communication takes its cue from an appearance in a Monty Python's Flying Circus sketch from 1970. This act is set in a café, where two customers ask for the breakfast menu:  

All the customers are Vikings. Mr and Mrs Bun enter downwards (on wires).   
Man Morning.   
Waitress Morning.   
Man Well, what you got?   
Waitress  Well, there's egg and bacon; egg, sausage and bacon; egg and Spam; egg, bacon and Spam; egg, bacon, sausage and Spam; Spam, bacon, sausage and Spam; Spam, Spam, Spam, bacon, Spam, tomato and Spam; Spam, Spam, Spam, egg and Spam; (Vikings start singing in background) Spam, Spam, Spam, Spam, Spam, Spam, baked beans, Spam, Spam, Spam and Spam.   
Vikings Spam, Spam, Spam, Spam, lovely Spam, lovely Spam.   
Waitress (continuing) ... or lobster Thermidor aux crevettes with a Mornay sauce, garnished with truffle paté, brandy, and with a fried egg on top, and Spam.   
Wife Have you got anything without Spam?   
Waitress Well,there's Spam, egg, sausage and Spam. That's not got much Spam in it ...   
Wife I don't want any Spam!   
Man Shh, dear, don't cause a fuss. I'll have your Spam. I love it. I'm having Spam, Spam, Spam, Spam, Spam, Spam, Spam, baked beans, Spam.   
WaitressBaked beans are off.4  

The Monty Python sketch is the story of a conquest: Spam - the canned food - slowly but decisively invades every item on the menu as well as the whole dialogue, until there is nothing left but Spam, Spam and Spam. This process is celebrated by a band of Vikings and other incongruous participants. Spam inundates the plot and even the final credits at the end of the show. It's a triumph by repetition, as cheerful as it is overwhelming.  

In this act,'Spam'initially refers to the canned meat of the same name. But this meaning is stretched to emphasize verbal reiteration and the uncontrolled replication of the term itself. It is this second meaning that came to be prominent in the realm of newly emergent online practices. In the 1980s, the term 'spam' was literally used as a type of invasion within MUD (multi-user dungeon)environments: people would type the word repeatedly so as to scroll other people's text offscreen. Content didn't matter; bulk did. The word 'spam' turned into a tangible material, capable of physically blocking out unwanted inforrmation.  

Sending an irritating, large, meaningless block of text in this way was called spamming. This was used as a tactic by insiders of a group that wanted to drive newcomers out of the room so the usual conversation could continue. It was also used to prevent members of rival groups from chatting ... for instance, Star Wars fans often invaded Star Trek chat rooms, filling the space with blocks of text until the Star Trek fans left. This act, previously called flooding or trashing, cametobeknown asspamming.5  

Spamming thus emerged as an online activity bent on displacing someone or something through verbal repetition. Words were used as extensive objects, which had the potential to push away other words. Nowadays, spam has become more of a commercial calculus. Bulk email messages with commercial or fraudulentintent6flooddataconnectionsworldwideandcausesubstantial economic damage by wasting time and effort. Even though the number of customers acquired through this process is extremely small, it is still a viable business. Needless to say, effortless technological reproduction forms the economic framework of this venture. Spamming is the pointless repetition of something worthless and annoying, over and over again, to extract a tiny spark ofvalue lyingdormantwithin audiences.  

# Artificial Meat  

But apart from these very obvious observations, what other conclusions can we draw? What else does spam as a chunk of contemporary digital rubble tell us about thepresent? Let's have a closer look.  

Before 'spam' the word became spam the object, it was, of course, an object already, the item celebrated by the Monty Python's Flying Circus number: the famous brand of canned meat produced by Hormel Foods Corporation. Its dubious composition has earned it many nicknames, ranging from ‘Specially Processed American Meats’ to ‘Supply Pressed American Meat', ‘Something Posing As Meat','Stuff, Pork and Ham' and 'Spare Parts Animal Meat'. Its elements look extremely suspicious; its essence is ersatz. And its cheapness is why it was included in many dishes in the post-war period, perhaps even too many, as the MontyPython sketch seems to suggest.  

Spam was, and still is, a cheap lower-class and army-food staple. It presents an uncanny mix between the natural and synthetic. Both organic and deeply inauthentic, it is an industrial product with some remnants of nature. Meat that has been ground so rigorously that is has leaped perhaps into another type of existence: a deeply phony foodstuff nutritious enough to enable military invasions and sheer subsistence.  

Precisely its composite nature makes 'spam' an interesting term to consider in political theory,especially within the discussion of biopolitics.For AntonioNegri and Michael Hardt, flesh is a metaphor for a body not inhibited by social or any otherrestrictions. Hardt and Negrieuphoricallydescribe fleshas'pure potentiality' oriented toward fullness', inhabited by angels and demons,7 as well as bristling with a new barbarian counterpower.8 Seen as an incarnation of vitality, flesh is imbued with religious and even messianic discourse about redemption and liberation.9 It is a post-Nietzschean repository of pure positivity.  

In contrast to the heroic description of living flesh, Spam is just humble hybrid meat. It lacks the pompous attributes of flesh. It is modest and cheap, made of bits and pieces, which may be recycled and are staunchly inanimate. It is meat as commodity, and an affordable one at that. But this doesn't mean that it should be underestimated. For Spam addresses the hybridized commodity aspect of forms of existence that span humans and machines, subjects and objects alike. It refers to objectified lives as well as to biological objects. As such, it may speak more of actual conditions of contemporary existence than can purely biological terms.  

Spam has been through the meat grinder of industrial production. This is why its fabrication resonates with the industrial (or post-industrial) generation of populations worldwide, who also endured the mincer of repeated primordial accumulation, Cycles of debt bondage, subsequent exodus, draft into industrial labour and repeated rejection from it have forced people back into subsistence farming, only to reemerge from tiny fields as post-Fordist service workers. Like their electronic spam message counterparts, these crowds form the vast majority of their kind but are considered superfluous annoying and redundant. They are assumed to replicate uncontrollably. These populations are spam, not flesh; made of a material that has been ground for generations by a never-ending onslaught of capital and repackaged in ever new, increasingly hybrid and object-like forms.  

Electronic spam highlights the speculative dimension of these bodies. It is painfully obvious that most products marketed via e-spam are supposed to enhance bodily appearance, performance and/or health. Email spam is a format that attempts to act on bodies by cashing in on role models of uniformly drugged, enhanced, super-slim, super-active and super-horny peopleio wearing replica watches so as to be on time for their service jobs. More than 65 per cent of email spam pushes antidepressants and Viagra - or rather rip-off pills boasting the same effects - thus selling fantasies of perfectly exploitable bodies; coveted production tools for superfluous crowds. Both forms of spam are post-carnal: they deal with the production of enhanced, altered, artificial, processed, upgraded as well as degraded forms of flesh.  

But Spam is not without its own counterpower. In Ed Ruscha's 1962 painting Actual Size, a resplendent Spam can is caught flying in a downward trajectory. A glowing trail makes it look like a crossover between a comet and a Molotov cocktail Spam as a solid object, airborne, combustible and imbued with kinetic power. Spam tins can be hurled into bank windows. They are sturdy and resilient.  

In some cases, culinary applications of Spam also manage to overturn its relations with warfare and deprivation. One example is the Hawaian use of Spam as a delicacy. Spam became popular during World War II when Japanese were banned from fishing. Thus ‘Spam became an important source of protein for locals'! But far from remaining a hallmark of scarcity, it was redeployed as an ingredient for inventive dishes like Spamakopita, Spam Musubi, Spam Katsu, Spam loco moco, Spam fusion fajitas, Spam somen, Spam chutney, Spam Mahi Carbonara, and Spamaroni and Cheese. Similar interpretations of Spam exist in Korea, where Spam spread after being imported by the US military. The German version is called doner kebab,12 an extremely popular form of orientalist roast Spam impaled on supersized skewers. This dish was invented by downsized Turkish migrant workers in the 1970s. Since then it has become Germany's unofficial national dish. These uses of Spam highlight the composition of the constituency of its consumers and (sometimes) improve its appeal to the senses.  

But even electronic spam has unexpected affinities to social composition. Indeed, it was initially explicitly defined as a res publica, a public thing. One of the first spam filters developed was based on the quite unlikely finding that any email containing the word 'republic' would almost invariably end up being spam. (The other dubious keywords being, interestingly,'madam' and 'guarantee').!3  

Spam - in its different versions - is thus resolutely public. It is always made from several sources: things and bodies, letters, metals, colours and proteins alike. Its element is commonality; a mix of components animate and inanimate, as impure as one could possibly imagine.  

Spam transforms words into carnal objects, as in Ruscha's painting. This incarnation goes way beyond its religious precedents, though. Let's face it: the incarnation of words today mostly takes the form of spam, spam and spam.  

# History  

But spam is not only a passive substance, endowed with the power of blocking and crowding. It also brings about very different forms of social organization. It changes the ways in which a group of people is structured and organized in interaction. In the Monty Python sketch, Spam becomes a pivotal term that points not only at a change in the paradigm of labour but also, perhaps, in the form of history itself.  

An insert at the very end of the sketch shows a history teacher sitting in a classroom and detailing the invasions of the Vikings:  

Superimposed caption: \*A Historian'  

Another great Viking victory was at the Green Midget cafe at Bromley. Once again the Viking strategy was the same. They sailed from these fjords here (indicating a map with arrows on it), assembled at Trondheim, and waited for the strong northeasterly winds to blow their oaken galleys to England whence they sailed on May 23rd. Once in Bromley they assembled in the Green Midget café and Spam selecting a Spam particular Spam item from the Spam menu would Spam,Spam, Spam, Spam, Spam...(The backdrop behind him rises to reveal the café again, the Vikings start singingagain,and the historian conducts them.)  

This unassuming scene demonstrates how the representation of history itself is transformed by the invasion of Spam. Initially, the historian gives an authoritative classroom-style account of events from a slightly elevated position and with a backdrop of maps.  

But as Spam starts to flood the dialogue, the wall behind the historian is revealed to be a stage curtain. As the skit continues, the curtain is lifted, and the initial cafe setting reappears behind it.  

The historian then produces a conductor's baton and joins in the wild celebratory Spam chorus. First he appears to direct this cacophony, but he gives up on mastery and breaks the baton in two.  

Two different modes of address are presented in this short sketch: first, the historian addresses the spectators as if inside a classroom.After the change of scenery the frontal address is abandoned, and our point of view is transformed into a mixture of a customer's and an audience's perspective. While the first mode of address presents a slightly authoritarian educational model, the secondisclearlyadjustedto asituationofservice asperformance or performance as service.This shift is catalyzed by the renewed invasion of Spam into the dialogue. Spam expels the authoritative address and introduces a mode based on service and spectacle, sustained by customers suspended in mid-air.  

The form of temporality inherent in the scene shifts as well: whereas in the beginning there is a clear narrative of invasion and progress, after the curtain lifts there is just the pure spectacle of incongruous, unsynchronized, profoundly multicultural and salacious performative services. A joint celebration, which has no conductor, leader or avant-garde, emerges spontaneously.  

Spam's takeover transforms a pseudo-scientific account of history (and its 'progress') into a performative chaos, in which actors, consumers, Spam and service workers become indistinguishable. The linear and teleological progression of history, complete with its narration by academic administrators, is disrupted. The unity created by the frontal address of the classroom is gone. The mood shifts from education to celebration.  

But the public composition of Spam is not merely about fun and merriment; it penetrates the framework of the production of spectacle, as the final credits, which start rolling immediately after this scene, demonstrate. Spam infiltrates job titles and names of producers and technicians. Exclamations from the service sector are interspersed: 'not Sundays/Spam's off, dear'. It's not as if Spam has erased labour; rather Spam has erased class by penetrating and invading labour and labourers alike.  

Spam is thus given both as the description of labour and its performers. It is an activity, a subject and an object, as well as an uncontrollably multiplying word that describes all of the former. People clearly are being included into the world of Spam and turned into potentially edible matter. Words are incarnated as objects, and vice versa.And the only slogan that rallies the chaotic Spam and service work/ workers is given in the final titles of the sketch'Service Not Included'.  

# Service Not Included  

This slogan is the inherent promise of Spam. While Hardt and Negri rave about the angelic potential of flesh and its relentless release of desire, the promise of spam is much more prosaic: 'service not included' means simply that service should not be free. Even in the digital age, service cannot be reproduced indefinitely. At present, however,the line'service not included' is not a description but a claim that waits to be realized. In the world of service as performance (and performance as service), labour seems to be abundantly free; as if it too could be copy-pasted and duplicated digitally.  

Of course, little of this issue is reflected in the piles of repetitive spam matter that clogs mail accounts and data lines worldwide. But why not see its material excess as anticipation of a time when the spam incarnated in service and spectacle workers, as well as in everybody else considered superfluous and dispensable, starts to speak and utters the slogan: service not included?  

Contemporary electronic spam tries to extract an improbable spark of value from an inattentive crowd by means of inundation. But to become spam - that is, fully to identify with its unrealized promise - means to spark an improbable element of commonality between different forms of existence, to become a public thing. a cheerful incarnation of data-based wreckage.  

Thereis onequestionlefttoexplore:howdoestheMontyPythonsketch actualize a different form of history? At first glance the question might have been answered by the transformed behaviour of the historian who gives up his vantage point of authority to participate wholeheartedly in the creation of chaos. But there is another aspect, too.  

Let's return to Klee's painting. There is another mystery in this painting: the angel averts its gaze just slightly; it doesn't look at us straight on.  

Is it perhaps distracted by something happening behind it? Could it have been caught at the very moment when the uniform background behind it starts lifting upwards, revealing itself as a stage curtain? Is it about to tum around to join in with a new scene instead of being torn between mourning past demise and a violently displaced future? And what will it order from the breakfast menu?

# Joasia Krysa Kurator: A Proposal for an Experimental, Permutational Software Application Capable of Curating Exhibitions//2013  

In 1953, Gordon Pask, the English cybernetician and psychologist, created what is widely thought of as the first cybernetic art machine.Musicolour was essentially an interactive display that turned music into light, and comprised an input device for receiving sound, a computer, and an output device for lights. The computer part included an element of machine-learning that enabled it to interact with musicians. For instance, if the music was repetitious it could prompt the musicians to vary their performance.The element of learning,based on feedback and interaction,is what makes it possible to consider it a cybernetic machine and not simply a passive light show.  

Can curating be conceived in similar terms, like Pask's machine, characterized by participation, interactivity and feedback as necessary elements in performing the curatorial functions of selecting and organizing diverse materials (material objects, or data, or media, ideas, concepts) in particular ways to produce meaning? If curating (as a process), and/or a curator (as figure) can be imagined as a system in this way, what does this imply for curating today in the age of the networked commons?Oneproblem thatimmediatelyarises isthat althoughmachines can select and organize data well, they are not so good at producing meanings, as they don't understand the symbols they work with. So the proposal for an experimental, permutational software application capable of curating exhibitions is a speculation on how curatorial practice might be informed by ideas of self-organization, and how human and non-human agencies might work in combination to address this possibility? In other words, the idea is to conceive of curating processes that unfold through the logic of socio-technological systems, and to build an online softwaredriven platform that follows curatorial protocols. At the same time, this process is opened up to wider networked contingencies - in excess of a pre-defined curatorial or centralized plan as such. My hypothesis is that the curatorial process, already a collaborative activity involving multiple agents (artists, audiences, curator, etc.), can be even more widely distributed to programmers, networked users, technologicalnetworksandsoftwareitself-allofwhichcanconstitutethe curatorial. The process can be seen to be increasingly and more overtly collective and distributed in this way - even to the extreme of imagining a self-organizing system that curates itself - reconfiguring the traditional understanding of the term curating as caring for objects or collections - and extended to caring for wider social relations across humans and machines across complex networks.  

One of the significant aspects of this approach is the way the figure of the curator can now be described in terms of both the individual and collective, and as acombinationof human and non-human(or technical) processes. Furthermore, the dynamic relations of care and control reflected in the dynamics of networks open up possibilities of unpredictable and unexpected curatorial processes, and the possibility of an intervention or transformation of the curatorial system from outside (through feedback for instance). However, this approach is not free from problems, especially in relation to issues of control and degree of openness of the system, as informed by cybernetic and systems theory.1 Even the etymological roots of the term curating (to curate) in the Latin curare - to care (for something or someone) - point to some of the inherent paradoxes involved in curating - in that aspects of care co-exist with mechanisms of control. For Alexander Galloway and Eugene Thacker, the act of curating ‘enframes, contextualizes, bounds, manages, regulates and controls. In doing so it also opens up, unbridles, and undoes the very controlit seeks to establish.'2  

The proposal for kurator software calls for a practice of curating that is more caring perhaps, but also more adaptive, performative and distributed, taking its cue from socio-technological networks and computational dynamics. The prototype, an online software driven platform for collecting, storing, organizing and viewing art, or more specifically source code, directly links curating (often understood as an activity of artistic programming), computing (the activity of computer programming）and networked operations across these sociotechnicalfields.3  

The prototype was developed in stages between 2005 (version 0.1) and 2010 (version 1.0)4 and comprises an open, collaborative and un-moderated database of code and a display platform. Code is collected through an open-submission process and through the process of automatic 'scraping' of the Internet with the web crawler tool. Collected code is indexed and stored in the project repository, and then can be arranged into larger selections for public display. The displays are thematically-organized selections of code from the project repository created by users, or automatically generated by the software itself. In parallel to the activity of curating code into displays, and in keeping with free and open software development, users can make modifications to the kurator software itself. New versions can then be saved in the project repository for public display, commenting and further development.  

In a general sense, the system follows the protocols of the conventional curatorial process, including making selections and arranging works into exhibitions, describing and labelling works, providing contextual information about exhibitions, disseminating and archiving. However, it translates these into software protocols,breaking down the curatorial process into a series of commands and rules. As a result the system partly automates the curatorial function as well as the sense of agency involved in the execution of rules and the production of meanings.If the curatorial process can be broken down into a series of commands or rules in this way, then the custom written software underpinning the platform aims to extend these in a more unpredictable, unprescribed, and uncontrolled manner that accounts for the openness of the system, the vagaries of the users' input and any modifications they make to the system itself. Furthermore, the project implements a free libre open source (FLOss) model of curating articulated on two levels: firstly, on a technical level as a free software application licensed under GPL(GeneralPublicLicense)toensureitsfuture developmentunder the same conditions; and secondly, on a conceptual level as an open curatorial system.6 The software has an open API (Application Programming Interface) so that users can write to or adapt the programming interface that directly queries the data store. The source code of the kurator project is included in the system database and userscanaddfunctionality,makemodificationsandsavenewversionsofthe software in the 'Code Repository'. In this way, the project speculates upon the production of curatorial software, and the practice of curating in general, beyond a singular closed proprietry model to a collaborative open source model for future public development. What does this imply for curatorial practice more widely?  

At the time of the project launch in 2005, Marina Vishmidt described it thus:  

The kurator project draws on an affinity between code art and curatorial praxis, to redevelop curating as a generative experiment in social relations. [.] By displacing the curatorial function from abstract subjective potential to binary code, it reproduces the singular curator as a collective executive. In this way it preserves the curator byexceedingthe curator - the perfectly consistent paradox that any art practice grounding its critique in both art-immanence and social terms is structurally bound to enact.?  

This captures the potential of the project to reveal insights into the curatorial process as a complex system and the regulatory processes that take place within those systems, in particular the process of self-organization and emergent order. Somewhat like curators, computers in a network agree technical standards of action such that the protocols 'govern' usage at the level of code: ‘protocol is a technique for achieving voluntary regulation within a contingent environment', as Alexander Galloway puts it.8 Protocols thus operate as a distributed management system coding packets of information, documents and communication. This is not to say that computational or curatorial control is inherently bad but the problem lies in the fact that standards are set through rule-sets that are imposed centrally. If a better understanding of software and networks offers such an opportunity to develop strategies and techniques of organization, then curating might begin to be better organized too. As with Pask's machine, curators might be prompted by the system to vary their performance.

# Okwui Enwezor Travel Notes: Living, Working and Travelling in a Restless World//1997  

[..]‘Trade Routes: History and Geography' [the 2nd Johannesburg Biennale] is sited around the axial vector of economic globalization. It is an attempt to elaborate the full measure of its debates, particularly those that rise out of the analysis of modernity as a circulatory system of exchange and site of translation, as transnational/cultural transactions that do not always arrive in neatly tied packages - as the South African-born British critic Sarat Maharaj wonderfully put it. In this manner, all journeys are not only incomplete, they form part of the vast ways the world is encountered and translated. This project then comes at a time when the entire notion of history is being constantly questioned and revisited. Hence the elaboration of the debates in which the Biennale is necessarily enmeshed could be seen as a kind of open network of exchange, involving different levels of cultural significations, translations, transcriptions, phenomenological and social encounters, mobility of ideas, contestations of political methodologies, etc. My interest in globalization, and what the critic Saskia Sassen would term its strategic agents, is to respond to the evolving nature of contemporary culture today as transmitted from a very limited enclosure of Eurocentrism. This response further narrows in a strip of territory we all refer to as contemporary art in the age of hyper-consumerism, ethnographic travel, cultural tourism, the Hollywoodization of mass culture. This necessitates attention to exploring the emergent forms of practice and conditions in the evolving culture of the image within contemporary art today; from the real to the hyperreal, from various aspects of social portraiture to fugitive acts of aesthetic decomposition and transgression.  

Within the amalgam of interconnected perspectives claiming space in these articulations,where de-reified concepts of art and decommodified ideas of culture are explored, arise possible ways of reinventing questions of culture in the age of globalization. Rather than insert the works of invited artists into these discussions as illustrative mechanisms, I hope the astute meditations and explorations of the artists can serve as primers for mapping new incarnations of the world and synchronously organized futures. Such mappings provide the key impetus of this curatorial endeavour, where responsibilities are shared, while leaving room for individual curatorial maps to be drawn. [...]  

The general concept of 'Trade Routes: History and Geography' is to examine the history of globalization by exploring how economic imperatives of the last five hundred years have produced resilient cultural fusions and disjunctions. The Biennale directs its attention towards the production of meaning by looking to the social, political and cultural procedures in operation today, in a highly globalized and technologized period of the twentieth century. The purpose of the Biennale is to give critical significance to those modes of contestation, analysis, exploration and interpretation with which contemporary artists contend and to contemplate the shifts that have led to the redefinition of our senses of society. The sense of the world which the Biennale hopes to engage, perhaps even to inaugurate, emerges from the socio-political procedures of a world in conflict with itself. [...]  

In many areas of the world where such absolute notions as citizenship and nationality form the deadly methods of xenophobic exclusion, the idea of the post-national subject becomes the norm. This is particularly evident in those spaces in which immense aggregates of human communities circulate in the complex vectors of class, race, gender,ideology, religious beliefs, commodity and labour. Though these and many more experiences form part of the fragments of my own personal witnessing in the conveyor belt of global travel, there is in fact nothing unique about them. They are part of the legacies of a fraught modernity which many people actively live. They also define a period in history in which the entire world and its peoples live in a moment of transition.  

Stories intersect and intervene, opening emphatically into connected and disparate social realities.Today these transnational movements across territories and cultures, between identities and social formations, have come to shape that space we give names like 'nation', 'city, 'community', “home'. Or they unfold in how contemporary events of memory, the past, the bonds of language, family, honour, kinship and belonging are written. [..]  

Since contemporary art, especially in the West, has operated throughout this century on the same hegemonic principles as the traditional economic sector, it is my wish for this Biennale not to reduce the qualitative contributions of invited artists by privileging only those who come from affluent countries. It is a fact that major industrial countries of Europe and North America spend disproportionately large sums of money on circulating the products of their contemporary art markets. This has had the unfortunate effect of excluding a large number of valuable artistic practices outside the most important international forums for contemporary art. The 2nd Johannesburg Biennale stands on the principle of building new 'contact zones' for productive and lasting exchanges between artists and intellectuals, across cultures, economic positions and political affiliations. In light of these I have, while preparing this project, chosen to forego any attachment to the concept of nationality as a criterion for invitations extended to artists. As such there will be no national pavilions, nor have I proposed to the artists and curators involved in this Biennale any initiative that may be misconstrued as privileging ideas about national culture.  

In my proposition, belonging proceeds from a much broader frame, acknowledging individual situations. Often, it makes critical accommodation for various ways of being, thinking, working and dwelling in a world where the notion of borders has been soundly problematized. The artists we have invited are members of this broad affliation. They are part of that mobile, itinerant group whom Homi Bhabha has described as the ‘tribe of interpreters of such metaphors [as home and exile] - the translators of the dissemination of texts and discourses across cultures - who perform act[s] of secular interpretation' of our fascinating world. Moreover, the tangled routes these artists have travelled to arrive in South Africa speak not only of the daily practice of what a contemporary artist is today; they unpeel all those connotations we associate with diaspora, lucidly described, in the anthropologist James Clifford's remarkable book Routes: Travel and Translation in the Late Twentieth Century,as'thatexemplary community of the transnational moment, made up of ... domains of shared and discrepant meanings, adjacent maps and histories; a broad, complex fraternity that hinges on non-absolutist ways of practising citizenship'.  

Howeverincompletethe above descriptionsofthenewglobal citizen maybe, they propose the partial ways of encountering and articulating cultures in the late twentieth century. They are for me liminal figurations of the transitory space we all inhabit in today's globalized and technologized environment. But more importantly, they narrate a sense of openness in the ways we figure identity in the furious ebb and flow of global migration. Here identity no longer signals what we are or how we define, refine, reify and contest who we are and where we come from. It has become an ideological problem we struggle to solve. And despite its difficulties, it remains a fascinating object of the transcultural, transterritorial and transnational narrative of the human enterprise. I end here because there is no one way of embodying what this human enterprise is, except to say that it has become increasingly messy. Here, identity - stitched into the migratory patterns through which people have travelled, secured, conquered and settled - spreads outward into that narrative space of not just being, but also of becoming. Globalization thus ceases to be a reductive activity of economic consolidation and efficient distribution of labour and capital. These motifs describe a more fascinating modernity than has been properly allowed in broader cultural discussions. Far from being aberrations, they instead suggest partial ways of living, working and travelling in a restless world of social, political, economic and cultural transformation like no other in human history.  

# Saskia Sassen Locating Cities on Global Circuits//2002  

[...J National and global markets, as well as globally integrated organizations, require central places where the work of globalization gets done. Finance and advanced corporate services are industries producing the organizational commodities necessary for the implementation and management of global economic systems. Cities are preferred sites for the production of these services, particularly the most innovative, speculative, internationalized service sectors. Further, leading firms in information industries require a vast physical infrastructure containing strategic nodes with hyperconcentration of facilities; we need to distinguish between the capacity for global transmission/ communication and the material conditions that make this possible. Finally, even the most advanced information industries have a production process that is at least partly place-bound because of the combination of resources it requires even when the outputs are hypermobile.  

Theoretically this addresses two key issues in current debates and scholarship. One of these is the complex articulation between capital fixity and capital mobility, and the other, the position of cities in a global economy. I have developed the thesis that capital mobility cannot be reduced simply to that which moves, or to the technologies that facilitate movement. Rather, multiple components of what we keep thinking of as capital fixity are actually components of capital mobility. This conceptualization allows us to reposition the role of cities in an increasingly globalizing world, in thatthey contain the resources (including fixed capital) that enable firms and markets to have global operations. The mobility of capital,whetherin theform ofinvestments,trade or overseas affiliates,needs to be managed, serviced, coordinated. These tasks are often rather place-bound, yet are key components of capital mobility. Finally,states - place-bound institutional orders - have played an often crucial role in producing regulatory environments that facilitate the implementation of cross-border operations for national as well as foreign firms, investors and markets.  

In brief, a focus on cities makes it possible to recognize the anchoring of multiple cross-border dynamics in a network of places, prominent among which are cities, particularly global cities or those with global city functions. This in turn anchors various features of globalization in the speciflc conditions and histories of these cities and in theirvariableinsertions in their nationaleconomies and in various world economies across time and place. [...] This type of conceptualization about globalization contributes to identifying a complex organizational architecture thatcuts across borders and is both deterritorialized and concentrated in cities.Further,it creates an enormous research agenda in that every particular national or urban economy has its specific and inherited modes of absorbing change and linking up with current global circuits. [...J Once we have more information about variance across countries and cities we may also be able to establish whether position in the global hierarchy makes a difference, and the various ways in which it might do so.  

This type of analysis of globalization, which seeks to map the strategic sites with hyperconcentration of resources as well as the cross-border networks that link these sites and others, helps us understand to what extent there is a specific geography of globalization and the fact that it is not a planetary event encompassing all of the world. It is, furthermore, a changing geography, one that has undergone multiple, often specialized transformations over the last few centuries and over the last two decades, and most recently has come to include electronic space.

# Pamela Allara Geobodies: Feminist Activists Crossing Borders//2008  

In her anthology Power Politics (2001), Arundhati Roy describes globalization as the barbaric dispossession' of property, identity and human rights resulting from the concentration of wealth into the covetous grasp of multinational corporations. Because the exploitation of female labour is central to this process, contemporary women artist-activists have devised strategies to confront and subvert the invisible hand' of global capitalism. This text discusses works by two feminist artists who confront the system of gendered exploitation of labour and suppression of human rights: Ursula Biemann's video essays Performing the Border (1999), Writing Desire (2000) and Remote Sensing (2001); and Tanja Ostojic's multi-year performance work, the Crossing Borders series (2000-2004). By marking the parallels between national boundaries and the (permeable) boundaries of women's bodies, their work opens up spaces to rethink and resist global capital. Each artist employs multiple strategies of resistance involving collaborative research and targeted interventions, as well as a range of media, including web-based documentation and archiving.  

# 126//THENETWORKASA MODE OFBEING  

The defined boundary between the legitimate and illegitimate woman's body has been undergoing revision in the shifting landscape of the global economy, and thus this essay will compare the ways in which the so-called illegitimate body - the ‘illegal alien' or‘prostitute' - is performed in these works. The artists’ representations of these most disempowered of workers enlarge the spaces of global feminist communities: spaces that are postnational, translocal and multipositioned. A 'feminism without borders', according to the influential sociologist Chandra Mohanty, must acknowledge the fault lines that these arbitrary and changing borders represent, and 'envision change and social justice work across these lines of demarcation and division'.(Mohanty,Feminism without Borders,2003: 2)  

In another essay,‘Women Workers and the Politics of Solidarity', Mohanty has argued that in the global economy ‘issues of spatial economy - the manner by which capital utilizes particular spaces for differential production and the accumulation of capital, and in the process transforms theses spaces (and peoples) - gain fundamental importance for feminist analysis' (Feminism without Borders, 141). The increased feminization of poverty globally is the direct result of patriarchal, ideological constructions of women's work. In addition to policing territorial boundaries to control the flow of material goods and to ensure maximum profit, capital exploits women's employment by confining it within ideological constructions such as 'domestic work' or 'prostitution', which are associated with unpaid or illegal labour. As Ursula Biemann has commented, Prostitution is not just part ... of a tax-free consumer binge; it is a structural part of global capitalism. (Biemann, Been There and Back to Nowhere: Gender in Transnational Spaces. Postproduction Documents 1988-2000, 2000: 139)  

In her influential book, Borderlands/la frontera: The New Mestiza (1987), the feminist scholar Gloria Anzaldua argued that the ultimate act of colonizers is to create artificial boundaries that mark space as a site of contestation. These socalled ‘national’ borders become, in practice, regions of flux where different cultures, races and genders collide or interchange (Borderlands, 3). As women travel through these ‘in-between' spaces to seek work, their identities open up and their newly porous bodies incorporate obsolete but still powerful terms, such as 'migrant' or 'prostitute, which imply illegitimacy or bastardization. Both the borders of women's bodies and the ‘national' borders must be policed to prevent such potential invasions/infections. As one of her collaborators, Bertha Jottar, comments in the opening section of Biemann's video essay Performing the Border (1999), In a way the border is always represented as this wound that has to be healed ... to be protected from contamination.'  

Turning now to Biemann and Ostojic, I want to emphasize once again that in comparing segments from larger projects, I am summarizing one of a number of strategies each artist has adopted over time. After studying art in Mexico City and at the School of Visual Arts in New York City, the Swiss-born Biemann participated in the Whitney Museum's independent study programme from 1987- 88, during which time she returned to Mexico to produce a photo-based study, The Border Project. In 1999 she expanded her study of the political economy of the US/ Mexican border into her first video essay, Performing the Border. Abandoning the outmoded conventions of traditional documentary, with its linear narratives voiced by one or more ‘authorities', Biemann chose the term‘video essay’to describe her effort to write complex histories and to think through 'the different kinds of subjectivities produced on the border through representations, work conditions, the public sphere and the kinds of trajectories women trace in the move through these transnational spaces'. (Biemann, Been There, 8)  

Performing the Border is set in the Mexican/US border town of Ciudad Juarez, where two decades ago US multinational corporations established factories in order to take advantage of the cheap labour force opened up by the free trade agreement in 1985, which was further accelerated by the 1994 NAFTA agreement. Hiring women because they accept lower wages than men, the maquiladoras (golden mills) produce high-tech equipment generating large profits for the companies, but no benefits or improved working conditions for the female workers. The compartmentalization of labour via assembly lines in the maquiladoras parallels the fragmentation of home, leisure and work in these women'slives.InterviewswithfemaleMexicanfactoryworkers, sexworkers, artist-activists and journalists are layered with Biemann's voice-over analysis, screen text,maps and her own or archival footage toreveal thelinksbetween the gendered division of labour, prostitution and violence against women.  

Performing the Border begins with a travelling shot of the 'nowhere of the political battleground that is the US/Mexican border'. Simultaneously, the camera records the conversation of the women inside the car - Bertha Jottar, a cultural critic who participated in the Border Art Project founded by Guillermo GomezPenia and activist Angela Escajeda. As the featureless landscape passes by, Jottar comments that the border is an imaginary line given reality only through performance. How are you crossing ... with a US passport, jumping, as a tourist, as a migrant, as a middle-class woman, as a domestic ... the border gets rearticulated through the power relationships that the crossing produces.' As the visual narrative shifts from images of factory work to after-hours activities, we learn that 'the laboratory for deregulation' has temporarily reversed customary male-female power dynamics. The women are young, and when seeking entertainment can afford to pay for male company.  

Yet, as nightclubs bloom from the desert sands, so does the practice of prostitution, for the women need to supplement their meagre factory pay in order to survive. According to another interlocutor, Sonia, the choices of the women labourers are as narrow as the border zone itself: factory worker, maid orprostitute.  

In an extended interview the former sex-worker JuanaAzua,whom the middleclass viewer may consider to be atypical because she is middle-aged, explains her reasons - and these are typical - for prostituting herself: to support her family, in this case an incapacitated brother and his children. Unexpectedly, Juana introduces her baby and provides the following explanation: 'The baby is mine. I got it as a present. A girl in the sex-trade .. she is HIV positive ... gave it to me' Juana then adds, almost as an aside, 'Now I'm handing out 12,000 to 18,000 condoms per month. I distribute them among the prostitutes, the women and the hotels' A mental shift is required as the viewer revises/reassigns her identity from sex worker to activist, bridging that conceptual divide to include both at once.  

This poignant interview may arouse the viewer's sympathy, to be sure, but more to the point, its function is to localize the growth of prostitution along the US/Mexican border and to provide a specific example of what, over time, will expand into Biemann's World Sex Work Archive. Juana's condom initiative does not so much serve to exemplify the cliched prostitute with the big heart, as to map the total absence of a civil society in the Free Trade Zone. The corporations that rule there are states unto themselves and do not feel any obligation to provide civil services of any sort: housing, schooling or childcare. Factories are opened and closed according to profitability, without regard to the human consequences. To cite Arundhati Roy once again,'To the single theory of “Life is Profit", it is artists who can translate cash-flow charts ... into real stories about what it's like to lose your home, your land, your job, your dignity, your past and your future to an invisible force'(Power Politics, 32). Performing the Border depicts the newly emerging model of the post-national world of corporate governance, where politics and economics merge, and labour is not only feminized but sexualized. In the global economy,the flow of capital is inextricably linked to the purchase, policing, consumption and even the potential dismemberment of women's bodies.  

The global economy profits not only from the exploitation of labour, but of course also from the technological apparatus that these labourers assemble. Just as the Internet has facilitated a range of sexual exchanges, from dating to pornography, so has it increased the sale of 'mail-order brides', many from the Philippines or from the former Soviet Union. As images of 'desirable' women move across the Internet, they instigate the movement of the people who are their referents. In Biemann's subsequent video essays Writing Desire (20o0) and Remote Sensing (2002), she charts the vast expanse of global sex trafficking: contemporary female slavery disguised as tourism or domestic work. The denial of physical experience in these virtual online relationships contributes to fantasy, a merging of reality and fiction that poses a potential threat to both women and men, while implicating the viewer in the new sexual consumerism of the Web. By appropriating images from NASA satellites, both video essays investigate the extensive clandestine trade routes used to export women across continents, as well as the localgrowth of prostitution condoned by the US military near its bases in Southeast Asia. The white, middle-class American males at the Angeles US base in the Philippines are Johns, purchasers of women's bodies; consumers who are never required to explain their unspoken and assumed sexual privilege. 'Natascha', on the other hand, does voice her desire - or rather, her image on the ‘Russian Brides' website speaks to it. Natascha studies accounting and likes to travel; her generic desires will be electronically matched with a purchaser, whose desires are likely to remain unstated, unknown. As Biemann argues, In the sexual economy/ the body is eroticized/is made generic ... to signify the collective exotic/to engender desire/the desire to be conquered.' (Writing Desire, video script, 2000)  

Presumably, women move across borders to gain agency: to improve their lives through gainfulemployment. In 1994, the International Organization for Migration estimated that 120 million people had moved from one country to another, legally or illegally, and that half of all the world's migrants were women. One such migrant is Tanja Ostojic. Born in Belgrade in the former Yugoslavia, she studied at the University of Art in Belgrade and at the Regional Beaux-Arts School in Nantes, France. Currently living in Berlin, Ostojic is a performance artist whose public interventions reveal the increasingly conflicted status of the female migrant in EU countries. Beginning in 1999, Ostojic used her own body to 'perform the border'.  

In a lecture on her performance project, Crossing Borders (2004), Ostojic has stated that she has consciously decided to abandon the production of ‘one-off artworks in favour of developing a series of strategic projects that will span a period of several years. Ostojic is ‘European'but her place of birth prevents her from claiming a ‘legitimate' European identity by working in or travelling to what is currently defined as the ‘European Union'. Despite their vast, if largely unacknowledged, contributions to modern and postmodern culture, Eastern Europeans do not enjoy the status of citizens of the European Community. Ostojic's Crossing Borders series (2000-2005) consists of four actions/interventions that challenged the arbitrary, continually shifting boundaries of the EU, which permit some 'new' members a triumphal 'entry', while excluding others.  

After a futile attempt to obtain a hearing for an Austrian visa, documented in Waiting for a Visa (2000), Ostojic adopted the more radical performance practices of fellow Yugoslav artists Marina Abramovic and Milica Tomic, and curator-critic Marina Grzinic. The provocative opening salvo in Looking for a Husband with EU Passport (2000-2003) pilloried the s0-called 'side effects' of globalization - the bride market and sex trafficking, as well as the familiar 'marriage of convenience' used by immigrants to obtain legal residence. Posting her shaved, naked selfportrait on the Internet, she advertised her body as an item to be bartered for a ticket to mobility. 'Hot Tanja' is a real 'chick', but she is a pfucked one. She certifies her gender - female - and quite literally strips it of eroticism, opening her body to political references such as the unpaid labour of the housewife, the horrors of 'ethnic cleansing' and the dissolution of her national identity, which has stripped her of citizenship. As she has explained: 'Provocation is a speciality of mine ... Sometimes I radically sacrifice my intimacy to confront certain existential, social Or political subjects. Looking for a Husband with EU Passport, an interactive Web project addressing gender and capital, criticizes the politics of 1990s Yugoslavia, and describes the collision of isolation, poverty and the elitism of European Union politics' (2004 lecture, 63).  

Biemann's voice-over commentary in Writing Desire may provide a sort of extended label to Ostojic's riveting'self-portrait': ‘Bodies move through various spheres/passing through transnational spaces/shopping for another body/that representsdesire...bodiesturntoimages/bodiesturntowords/bodiestumto codes .. she is beautiful and feminine/she is loving and traditional/she is humble and devoted ... she is the copy of the First World's past'Whereas the Russian hopeful Natascha confirms Biemann's interpretation through her own selfadvertisement (I would like to share my future/with a man who would understand me completely/and help me in my life and in my work/good bye/so long'), Ostojic's ad negates those cultural and ideological codes, substituting for feminine acquiescence an active, political goal: not a happy marriage, but an EU passport. Nonetheless, the game of true love and marriage is so firmly ingrained in the masculine and feminine collective psyches that it should come as no surprise that Ostojic's ad received more than 500 responses. After an extended correspondence with the most promising of the respondents, Ostojic elected to meet one of them - Klemens Golf, an artist from Dusseldorf who agreed to participate in Ostojic's marriage of convenience. Appropriately enough, their meeting was recorded as a work of performance art, Crossing Over. In this parody of US reality TV shows like The Bachelor, subtitles are used to create a false stream-of-consciousness narrative illustrative of the fantasies that might surface on this “first date'. Only the museum setting and audience dispel the pseudoromantic aura of this enactment of a conventional boy-meets-girl ritual. Surely Natascha had this scenario in mind when she created her video ad; Ostojic gains agency by replaying it against the grain.  

Because the performance burst the bubble of romantic love that has successfully fuelled the backlash against second-wave feminism in the United States, Brandeis students were generally outraged by her actions, arguing that  

Ostojic had ‘used' that nice Herr Golf. Their privileged social positions blinded them to the implications of trafficking in women for their own sheltered lives. In contrast, an article in the anthology Global Woman recounts the story of a Dominican sex worker who'makes a distinction between marriage por amor (for love) and marriage por residencia (for visas). After all, why waste a marriage certificate on romantic love when it can be transformed into a visa to a new land and economic security?'(Denise Brennan,‘Selling Sex for Visas: Sex Tourism as Stepping Stone to International Migration for Dominican Women', in Global Woman: Nannies, Maids and Sex Workers in the New Economy, 2002: 154). It is for this reason thatOstojicprominentlydisplays digitalreproductions of her passport in the installation of the Crossing Borders series.  

Her  Strategies of Success performances  acknowledge  the  ongoing objectification of women within the capitalist art system. With respect to her Vacation with Curator (Tirana Biennale, 2003), which was documented by staged 'paparazzi' photographs of her erotic afternoon with a powerful young art curator, she wrote: ‘The bizarre topless paparazzi photographs ... surely hide the fact that small boats from some of these beaches daily carry beaten females from different Eastern European countries, who will be soon changed into slaves in the West ... I think you should know that young women from the region are actually still being sold by their brothers and fathers to their future husbands'(2004 lecture, 68).  

In her Interview with Jula and Nara in the Presence of Pimp $1+2,$ Trabzon, Turkish Black Sea, September 2003 (File 6 of the Black Sea Files), Ursula Biemann returns us to the reality of sex workers' lives, and, more specifically, to the barriers of access that prevent the representation of that reality. In the 1998 interview with Juana, cited earlier, the illusion of documentary transparency is maintained, despite the layers of discourse that surround her narrative. With Jula and Nara, on the other hand, the difficulties of the objective translation of life into image are foregrounded. The two Russian-born prostitutes can speak only because their (unseen, offscreen) pimps have granted the interview; thus the women's words are framed by the stereophonic edits of those who control their voices and their livelihoods. The subtitled dialogue makes it clear that Biemann's artistic mission 'does not translate' for these women; in order to calm the women's distrust of this foreign intruder, Biemann is ‘mis(re) presented' by the pimps as someone who makes home movies for a hobby. If Ostojic's anatomy signifies on one level the vulnerability of the woman's body in the global economy, the discomfort of Jula, who fears the consequences of exposure of her illegal status and occupation, is equally naked. When Biemann enquires at last if they like their work, Nara replies bluntly: ‘Of course we hate it. Nobody likes this job. But she, too, has desires that replicate codes of belonging and stability: she declares that she wants to earn enough 'to return to my home (in Azerbaijan), my child and my family'.  

Even if this goal proves to be a pipe dream that makes her work bearable, she has some nascent power over her situation granted by her abilities as a translator. The new feminism requires just such interlocutors, who can work across cultures and languages to subvert the system. The subtitles in Ostojic's and Biemann's work literally underscore the need for translation, from image to text, from document to desire, from reality to imagination. This ‘border writing' is the central work of the artist-activist. As Guillermo Gomez-Pena has argued: ‘The more globalized the world becomes, the more unable we are to communicate across borders. But at the same time performance artists have become extremely savvy linguistic alchemists and semioticians'(Gomez-Penia, Ethno-Techno, 2005: 268). Our task now is not to create the illusory community of'weare all women', but rather to articulate multilingual, cross-cultural realities. How will we work to make those re-cognitions, those re-definitions, conform more broadly to human rights? What, in revised terminology, is a 'prostitute'? The Mexican sex worker turned mother and activist? The Russian would-be bride? The code-shattering performance artist? Jula and Nara, confined to the spaces provided by those who have purchased and transported them?  

In these in-between worlds, the line between moral and immoral, legal and illegal, freedom and bondage, is blurred. It is not the term 'prostitute' that must be deconstructed, but the system that produces it.  

Avtar Brah has called for a 'theoretical creolization', a language that can communicate across radically  disjunctive speaking positions. Redirecting women's lives in the flow of global capital requires redefining the terms, as well as the conditions, under which we labour.  

Yuko Hasegawa Tarek Atoui: Within//2013  

Tarek Atoui conceived this programme as a composition of four interrelated movements that build up and feedback on each other. The unit of composition is the pulse. It is defined here as an action or event [performance, concert, workshop or research group] of a certain intensity [fortissimo, mezzo piano, piano, tacet) that periodically affects the activity and the soundscape of the city.  

Within will last for the duration of the Sharjah Biennial. The city and its ambient sounds are looked at as the metric system and timeline of this composition. Pulses are triggered according to the soundscape of the city and its activity [calls for prayer, traffic jams, the end of the work day]. Their duration is the distance between two sonic events.  

Within progresses spatially from the city to the Biennial. The programme begins with performers occupying roundabouts, alleys and parking lots in the city, then moves to the public squares of Sharjah's Heritage Area, onto the rooftops of the exhibition spaces and into the courtyards.  

There are no bigstages,no spectacular set-ups and no video. The performances andconcerts takeplacein outdoorlocationswherethe audienceis closeto the performers and their relationship is direct.  

Within is influenced by the project Tacet, an investigation into how deaf people understand and perceive sound. This research has inspired Atoui to write Within as a chain reaction of rhythmic and plucked pulses, silent and emic ones.! It has also led him to look into the philosophy of Qin music and the connections it makes between virtuosity, silence and sound. [...]  

# Natasha Ginwala and Vivian Ziherl Sensing Grounds: Mangroves, Unauthentic Belonging, Extra-Territoriality//2013  

[...] [In the mangrove] human traces cannot survive as a lasting form, for this tropical coastal ecology is a site of continual refiguration: neither sea nor land, neither river nor sea, bearing neither salty nor fresh water, in neither daylight nor darkness. [...]  

The mangrove has been prone to confused definitions, since it is a grouping of over eighty specialized plant species that survive as ‘botanical amphibians', but is also a complex coastal ecosystem in itself. With these hybrid conditions of 'belonging', the mangrove lends itself to helping us think through the presentday schematic of Euro-American crises amid larger constellations of political insurrections and migratory movements. Its polymorphous personality as a sediment-carrier, land-builder, defender of numerous life forms, and also an inadvertent protector of pirates, renders the mangrove a fascinating study in the biopolitics of selfhood. [...]  

In the intertidal and interpenetrating zone of the mangrove, the border between land and sea becomes a choreography of re-crossings. The mangrove line is, hence, one of sedimentary reclamation rather than clear political divisions of terra firma. In mangrove zones, human determinations become ghosts. The inability to form a mark is registered as a problem also of historicity. [...]  

# Regarding Place  

Drawing figures, is figured. Drawing pulls, pushes, tugs, drags. Drawing is friction, gravity. Earth draws, is drawn, draws maps. Sun draws, draws shadows, photos. Moon drawstides.  

- from Roberto Chabet's notes for his exhibition 'Lines on Drawing' (1999)  

The artist's shadow falls upon a patch of mangrove-dwelling mudflats. As Roberto Chabet photographs this ecology of aerial roots, there is a simultaneous charge of self-inscription and of capturing a 'nearby'. At once, through proximity and a shadow of impermanence, this photograph becomes a conceptual process-note in which the mangrove emerges as co-authoring an indexical self. It is a figure of locationality and an agent of absorption, such that the principle of locating remains immersive.  

The material form of the Bakawan, a local mangrove tree in the Philippines, has been a focal point across modalities of Chabet's artistic production. Knowing the root became an inexhaustible journey of constant figurations, through installation, through drawing, through photography, through living close to tidal riverbanks, and through the common market sale of Bakawan segments for firewood. By turns this is knowing also as commodity, as the aesthetic and as the 'natural'.  

Chabet's first Bakawan exhibition took place in 1974, two years into the period of martial law proclaimed by President Ferdinand Marcos. It was held at the Cultural Centre of the Philippines, a heightened locus within the cultural politics of the Marcos regime. The installation presented a grid of fifty-six mangrove segments suspended amidst the representational void of a white-walled gallery setting. This scenography of “looking' was heightened by being viewable only through a glass door, its handle removed, both sealing the room and the symmetry of the setting. As poet and critic Joy Dayrit remarked, this suspended installation thus insists upon being viewed frontally, and yet it portrays the accentuated violence of the vertical-the mangrove as a barricade, as a territorialization after all.  

Throughout 1974, mangroves were the centre of Chabet's attention. He made a series of 48 watercolour and pencil drawings of Bakawan. The series was enfolded within the daily act of drawing and re-drawing '10,0oo Things', which subtends both Chabet's work and his self-conception as an artist. These drawings often proceed serially by tracing over a previous drawing, in a movement of both reproduction and annihilation, recurrent yet without producing a rehearsal of the same. The pictures do not accumulate to form a monumental image, nor is their memory of a monumental time. Through this ongoing act of self-exposure in observation and of self-application in drawing, Chabet produces not repetition but a kind of vivid co-presence enacted within a durative present.2  

In his notes towards Regarding Place, No Place, Chabet outlines the multiple operations of'regarding'- of looking and seeing, of consideration and attention, of respect and esteem. The act of 'regarding place', then, is an act of making place through self-emplacement. The Bakawan works may perhaps also be seen as exercises in self-cartography amidst the estranged condition of martial law and parochial nationalism. Yet they also'act' beyond this realm of implicated belonging by structuring modes of a situatedness that is ‘between'. ‘Placement, location, is central in art', Chabet writes, 'This sense of place is the artist's sense of self.'3  

# Unauthentic Belonging  

[...]J In Between the Waves, Tejal Shah introduces us to improbable bodies that infiltrate the mangrove, its sediments, refuse and excesses - becoming animalplants and plants as animals. Suspended between states of dreaming and wakefulness, these ambiguous beings hold stimulatory appendages. And yet, in their sensing they remain beyond mutation and beyond forces of ownership. In the resistant flesh and dense fertility of the aerial root, we find the radical feedback of self-exposure.  

The impossibility of the mangrove is designated as an externality, but in forming the contours of limitation it defines the cultural entity itself. It is a problem that binds. From this perspective, it is perhaps in its exceptional selfexposure that the aerial root is the root of an identity formation that is, by contrast, aware of the problems that it constitutes. Indeed, it is one that perhaps must know, from having been marked as unauthentic - as ill-fitted to the regimes under which identity is summoned. It is thus that the good feelings of belonging' may give way to the bad faith of sovereign hypocrisies.  

By producing the unauthentic, the possibility of inauthentification is instantiated. In the positive action of making belonging beyond prescribed bounds, the edifice of authority may be breeched. As Aime Césaire wrote in his Cahier d'unretour au pays natal,  

my negritude is neither tower nor cathedral it takes root in the red flesh of the soil it takes root in the ardent flesh of the sky it breaks through opaque prostration with its upright patience.4  

The root that heads also skyward, the quality of belonging that refigures narratives of place by figuring itself as upright, does not bind itself only to earthbound histories rendered as inert and received through descent. There is a reaching out into contact, a porosity. As Césaire writes in his Discourse on Colonialism, “for civilizations, exchange is oxygen.'5

[.] It is only our Western societies that quite recently turned man into an economic animal. But we are not yet all animals of the same species. In both lower and upper classes pure irrational expenditure is in current practice: it is still characteristic of some French noble houses. Homo oeconomicus is not behind us, but before, like the moral man, the man of duty, the scientific man and the reasonable man. For a long time man was something quite different; and it is not so long now since he became a machine - a calculating machine.  

In other respects we are still far from frigid utilitarian calculation. Make a thorough statistical analysis, as Maurice Halbwachs did for the working classes, of the consumption and expenditure of our middle classes and how many needs are found satisfied? How many desires are fulfilled that have utility as their end? Does not the rich man's expenditure on luxury, art, servants and extravagances recall the expenditure of the nobleman of former times or the savage chiefs whose customs we[earlier] described?  

It is another question to ask if it is good that this should be so. It is a good thing possibly that there exist means of expenditure and exchange other than economic ones. However, we contend that the best economic procedure is not to be found in the calculation of individual needs. I believe that we must become, in proportion as we would develop our wealth, something more than better financiers, accountants and administrators. The mere pursuit of individual ends is harmful to the ends and peace of the whole, to the rhythm of its work and pleasures, and hence in the end to the individual.  

We have just seen how important sections and groups of our capital industries are seeking to attach groups of their employees to them. Again all the syndicalist groups, employers' as much as wage-earners', claim that they are defending and representing the general interest with a fervour equal to that of the particular interests of their members, or of the interests of the groups themselves. Their speeches are burnished with many fine metaphors. Nevertheless, one has to admit that not only ethics and philosophy but also economic opinion and practice are starting to rise to this‘social' level. The feeling is that there is no better way of making men work than by reassuring them of being paid loyally all their lives for labour which they give loyally not only for their own sakes but for that of others.The producer-exchanger feels now as he has always felt - but this time he feels it more acutely - that he is giving something of himself, his time and his life. Thus he wants recompense, however modest, for this gift. And to refuse him this recompense is to incite him to laziness and lower production.  

We draw now a conclusion both sociological and practical. The famous Sura LXIV, Mutual Deception', given at Mecca to Mohammed, says:  

XV. Your possessions and your children are only a trial and Allah it is with whom is a great reward.   
XVI. Therefore be careful [of your duty to] Allah as much as you can, and hear and obey and spend (sadaqa), it is better for your souls; and whoever is saved from the greediness of his soul, these it is that are the successful.   
XVIl. If you set apart from Allah a goodly portion, He will double it for you and forgive you; and Allah is the multiplier of rewards, forbearing.   
XVIll. The knower of the unseen and the seen, the mighty, the wise.  

Replace the name of Allah by that of the society or professional group, or unite all three; replace the concept of alms by that of cooperation, of a prestation altruistically made; you will have a fair idea of the practice which is now coming into being. It can be seen at work already in certain economic groups and in the hearts of the masses, who often enough know their own interest and the common interest better than their leaders do. [..]

# Theodor W. Adorno Fish in Water//1951  

[...] Since the all-embracing distributive machinery of highly-concentrated industry has superseded the sphere of circulation, the latter has begun a strange post-existence. As the professions of the middle-man lose their economic basis, the private lives of countless people are becoming those of agents and gobetweens; indeed the entire private domain is being engulfed by a mysterious activity that bears all the features of commercial life without there being actually any business to transact. All these nervous people, from the unemployed to the public figure liable at any moment to incur the wrath of those whose investment he represents, believe that only by empathy, assiduity, serviceability, arts and dodges, by tradesmen's qualities, can they ingratiate themselves with the executive they imagine omnipresent, and soon there is no relationship that is not seen as a 'connection', no impulse not first censored as to whether it deviates from the acceptable. The concept of connections, a category of mediation and circulation, never flourished best in the sphere of circulation proper, the market, but in closed and monopolistic hierarchies. Now that the whole of society is becoming hierarchical, these murky connections are proliferating wherever there used still to be an appearance of freedom. The irrationality of the system is expressed scarcely less clearly in the parasitic psychology of the individual than in his economic fate. Earlier, when something like the maligned bourgeois division between professional and private life still existed - a division whose passing one almost now regrets - anyone who pursued practical aims in the private sphere was eyed mistrustfully as an uncouth interloper. Today it is seen as arrogant, alien and improper to engage in private activity without any evident ulterior motive. Not to be 'after' something is almost suspect: no help to others in the rat-race is acknowledged unless legitimized by counterclaims. Countless people are making, from the aftermath of the liquidation of professions, their profession. They are the nice folk, the good mixers liked by all, the just, humanely excusing all meanness and scrupulously proscribing any non-standardized impulses as sentimental. Indispensable for their knowledge of all the channels and plug-holes of power, they divine its most secret judgements and live by adroitly propagating them. They are found in all political camps, even where the rejection of the system is taken for granted, and has thereby produced a slack and subtle conformism of its own. Often they win sympathy by a certain goodnaturedness, a kindly involvement in other people's lives: selflessness as speculation. They are clever, witty, full of sensitive reactions: they have refurbished the old tradesman's mentality with the day before yesterday's psychological discoveries. They are capable of everything, even love, yet always faithlessly. They deceive, not by instinct, but on principle, valuing even themselves as a profit begrudged to anyone else. To intellect they are bound both by affinity and hatred: they are a temptation for the thoughtful, but also their worst enemies. For it is they who insidiously attack and despoil the last retreats of resistance, the hours still exempt from the demands of machinery. Their belated individualism poisons what little is left of the individual. [...]  

# John Baldessari The Best Way to do Art//1971  

A young artist in art school used to worship the paintings of Cézanne. He looked at and studied all the books he could find on Cézanne and copied all of the reproductions of Cézanne's work he found in the books.  

He visited a museum and for the first time saw a real Cézanne painting. He hated it. It was nothing like the Cézannes he had studied in the books. From that time on, he made all of his paintings the sizes of paintings reproduced in books and he painted them in black and white.He also painted captions and explanations on the paintings as in books. Often he just used words.  

And one day he realized that very few people went to art galleries and museums but many people looked at books and magazines as he did and they got them through the mail as he did.  

Moral: It's diffcult to put a painting in a mailbox.

Networks of promotion/control slide imperceptibly into networks of surveillance/ disinformation. Formerly one only conspired against an established order. Today, conspiring in its favour is a new and flourishing profession. Under spectacular domination people conspire to maintain it, and to guarantee what it alone would call its well-being. This conspiracy is a part of its very functioning.  

Provisions for a kind of preventive civil war are already being made, adapted to variously calculated future projections. These are the ‘special squads' responsible for local interventions according to the needs of the integrated spectacle. Thus, for the worst scenarios, a tactic has been planned under the name 'Three Cultures', a witty reference to a square in Mexico City in October 1968 - though this time the gloves would be off and the tactic applied before the revolt occurred. Such extreme cases apart, to be a useful tool of government unexplained assassinations only need to be widely influential or relatively frequent: simply knowing that they are possible complicates calculations in many different fields. Nor is there any need to be intelligently selective,ad hominem. The entirely random application of the procedure may well be more productive.  

The composition of certain fragments of a social critique of rearing has also been arranged, something which is no longer entrusted to academics or media professionals,whom it is nowpreferableto keep apart fromexcessively traditional ties in this debate: a new critique is required, advanced and exploited in a new way, controlled by another, better trained sort of professional. In a relatively confidential manner, lucid texts are beginning to appear, anonymously or signed by unknown authors-a tactichelped by everyone's concentration on the clowns of the spectacle, which in turn makes unknowns justly seem the most admirable - texts not only on subjects never touched on in the spectacle but also containing arguments whose force is made more striking by a calculable originality deriving from the fact that however evident, they are never used. This practice may serve as at least a first stage in initiation to recruit more alert intellects, who will later be told more about the possible consequences, should they seem suitable. What for some will be the first step in a career will be for others - with lower grades - the first step into the trap prepared for them.  

In some cases, with issues that threaten to become controversial, another pseudo-critique can be created; and between the two opinions which will thus be put forward - both outside the impoverished conventions of the spectacle - unsophisticated judgement can oscillate indefinitely, while discussion around them can be renewed whenever necessary. Most often this concerns a general discussion of what is hidden by the media, and this discussion can be strongly critical, and on some points quite evidently intelligent, yet always curiously decentred. Topics and words have been artificially chosen, with the aid of computers programmed in critical thought. These texts always contain certain gaps, which are quite hard to spot but nonetheless remarkable: the vanishing point of perspective is always abnormally absent. They resemble those facsimiles of famous weapons which only lack the firing-pin. This is inevitably a lateral critique, which perceives many things with considerable candour and accuracy, but places itself to one side. Not because it affects some sort of impartiality, for on the contrary it must seem to find much fault, yet without ever apparently feeling the need to reveal its cause, to state, even implicitly, where it is coming from and where it wants to go.  

To this kind of counter-journalistic false critique can be added the organized practice of rumour which we know to be originally a sort of uncontrollable byproduct of spectacular information, since everyone, however vaguely, perceives something misleading about the latter and trusts it as little as it deserves. Rumour began as something superstitious, naive, self-deluding. More recently,however, surveillance has begun introducing into the population people capable of starting rumours which suit it at the very first signal. It has been decided here to apply in practice the observations of a theory formulated some thirty years ago, whose origins lie in American sociology of advertising - the theory of individuals known as ‘pacemakers', that is, those whom others in their milieu come to follow and imitate - but this time moving from spontaneity to control. Budgetary, or extrabudgetary means have also been released to fund numerous auxiliaries beside the former specialists of the recent past, academics and media professionals, sociologists and police. To believe in the continuing mechanical application of past models leads to just as many errors as the general ignorance of the past. 'Rome is no longer in Rome', and the Mafia are no longer thieves. And the surveillance and disinformation services are as far removed from the police and informers of former times - for example, from the roussins and mouchards of the Second Empire - as the present special services in all countries are from the officers of the armygeneralstaff'sDeuxiemeBureau in1914.  

Since art is dead, it has evidently become extremely easy to disguise police as artists. When the latest imitations of a recuperated neo-dadaism are allowed to pontificateproudlyinthemedia,and thus alsototinkerwith the decor of official palaces, like court jesters to the kings of junk, it is evident that by the same process a cultural cover is guaranteed for every agent or auxiliary of the state's networks of persuasion. Empty pseudo-museums, or pseudo-research centres on the work of non-existent personalities, can be opened just as fast as reputations are made for journalist-cops, historian-cops, or novelist-cops. No doubt Arthur Cravan foresaw this world when he wrote in Maintenant: 'Soon we will only see artists in the streets,and it will take no end of effort to find a single man.'This is indeed the sense of the revived form of an old quip of Parisian loafers: 'Hello there, artists! Too bad if I've got it wrong'  

Things having become what they are, we can now witness the use of collective authorship by the most modern publishing houses, that is to say, the ones with the best commercial distribution. Since their pseudonyms are only authenticated by the newspapers, they can swap them around, collaborate, replace each other, take on new artificial brains.Their task is to express the ideas and lifestyles of the epoch, not because of their personalities, but because they are ordered to. Those who believe that they are truly independent, individual literary entrepreneurs can knowingly vouch for the fact that Ducasse has had a row with the Comte de  

Lautréamont, that Dumas isn't Maquet, that we must never confuse Erckmann with Chatrian; that Censier and Daubenton are no longer on speaking terms. It might be best to say that this type of modern author was a follower of Rimbaud, atleastinsofar as'Iissomeoneelse.'  

The whole history of spectacular society called for the secret services to play the pivotalrole; for it is in them that the features and force of such a society are concentrated to the highest degree.Moreover they are always also the arbiters of that society's general interests, despite their modest title of 'services'. There is no corruption here, for they faithfully express the common morals of the spectacular century. Thus do watchers and watched sail forth on a boundless ocean. The spectacle has brought the secret to victory, and must be more and more controlled by specialists in secrecy who are certainly not only officials who have to different degrees managed to free themselves from state control; who are not only officials. [...]

# Gilles Deleuze Postscript on the Societies of Control//1990  

# 1. Historical  

Michel Foucault located the disciplinary societies in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries; they reach their height at the outset of the twentieth. They initiate the organization of vast spaces of enclosure. The individual never ceases passing from one closed environment to another, each having its own laws: first, the family; then the school ('you are no longer in your family'); then the barracks ('you are no longer at school'); then the factory; from time to time the hospital; possibly the prison, the preeminent instance of the enclosed environment. It's the prison that serves as the analogical model: at the sight of some labourers, the heroine of Rossellini's Europa '51 could exclaim, “I thought I was seeing convicts.'  

Foucault has brilliantly analysed the ideal project of these environments of enclosure, particularly visible within the factory: to concentrate; to distribute in space; to order in time; to compose a productive force within the dimension of space-time whose effect will be greater than the sum of its component forces. But what Foucault recognized as well was the transience of this model: it succeeded that of the societiesofsovereignty, the goal and functions of which were something quite different (to tax rather than to organize production, to rule on death rather than to administer life); the transition took place over time, and Napoleon seemed to effect the large-scale conversion from one society to the other. But in their turn the disciplines underwent a crisis to the benefit of new forces that were gradually instituted and which accelerated after World War Il: a disciplinary society was what we already no longer were, what we had ceased to be.  

We are in a generalized crisis in relation to all the environments of enclosure - prison, hospital, factory, school, family. The family is an ‘interior', in crisis like all other interiors - scholarly, professional, etc. The administrations in charge never cease announcing supposedly necessary reforms: to reform schools, to reform industries, hospitals, the armed forces, prisons. But everyone knows that these institutions are finished, whatever the length of their expiration periods. It's only a matter of administering their last rites and of keeping people employed until the installation of the new forces knocking at the door. These are the societies ofcontrol, which are in the process of replacing the disciplinary societies. 'Control is the name William Burroughs proposes as a term for the new monster, one that Foucault recognizes as our immediate future. Paul Virilio also is continually analysing the ultra-rapid forms of free-floating control that replaced the old disciplines operating in the time frame of a closed system. There is no need here to invoke the extraordinary pharmaceutical productions, the molecular engineering, the genetic manipulations, although these are slated to enter into the new process. There is no need to ask which is the toughest or most tolerable regime, for it's within each of them that liberating and enslavingforcesconfront one another. For example, in the crisis of the hospital as environment of enclosure, neighbourhood clinics, hospices and day care could at first express new freedom, but they could participate as well inmechanismsofcontrolthat areequaltotheharshestofconfinements.Thereis no need to fear or hope, but only to look for new weapons.  

# II. Logic  

The different internments or spaces of enclosure through which the individual passes are independent variables: each time one is supposed to start from zero, and although a common language for all these places exists, it is analogical. On the other hand, the different control mechanisms are inseparable variations, forming a system of variable geometry the language of which is numerical (which doesn't necessarily mean binary). Enclosures are moulds, distinct castings, but controls are a modulation, like a self-deforming cast that will continuously change from one moment to the other, or like a sieve whose mesh will transmute from point to point.  

This is obvious in the matter of salaries: the factory was a body that contained its internal forces at a level of equilibrium, the highest possible in terms of production, the lowest possible in terms of wages; but in a society of control, the corporation has replaced the factory, and the corporation is a spirit, a gas. Of course the factory was already familiar with the system of bonuses, but the corporation works more deeply to impose a modulation of each salary, in states of perpetual metastability that operate through challenges, contests and highly comic group sessions. If the most idiotic television game shows are so successful, it's because they express the corporate situation with great precision. The factory constituted individuals as a singlebody tothe double advantage of theboss who surveyed each element within the mass and the unions who mobilized a mass resistance; but the corporation constantly presents the brashest rivalry as a healthyform ofemulation, an excellent motivational force that opposes individuals against one another and runs through each, dividing each within. The modulating principle of 'salary according to merit' has not failed to tempt national education itself. Indeed, just as the corporation replaces the factory, perpetual training tends to replace the school, and continuous control to replace the examination. Which is the surest way of delivering the school over to the corporation.  

In the disciplinary societies one was always starting again (from school to the barracks, from the barracks to the factory), while in the societies of control one is never finished with anything - the corporation, the educational system, the armed services being metastable states coexisting in one and the same modulation, like a universal system of deformation. In The Trial, Kafka, who had already placed himself at the pivotal point between two types of social formation, described the most fearsome of juridical forms. The apparent acquittal of the disciplinary societies (between two incarcerations); and the limitless postponements of the societies of control (in continuous variation) are two very different modes of juridical life, and if our law is hesitant, itself in crisis, it's because we are leaving one in order to enter into the other. The disciplinary societies have two poles: the signature that designates the individual, and the number or administrative numeration that indicates his or her position within a mass. This is because the disciplines never saw any incompatibility between these two, and because at the same time power individualizes and masses together, thatis, constitutes those over whom itexercises power into a body and moulds the individuality of each member of that body. (Foucault saw the origin of this double charge in the pastoral power of the priest - the flock and each of its animals - but civil power moves in turn and by other means to make itself lay ‘priest'.) In the societies of control, on the other hand, what is important is no longer either a signature or a number, but a code: the code is a password, while on the other hand the disciplinary societies are regulated by watchwords (as much from the point of view of integration as from that of resistance). The numerical language of control is made of codes that mark access to information, or reject it. We no longer find ourselves dealing with the mass/ individual pair. Individuals have become'dividuals'; and the masses: samples, data, markets or \*banks'. Perhaps it is money that expresses the distinction between the two societies best, since discipline always referred back to minted money that locks gold in as numerical standard, while control relates to floating rates of exchange, modulated according to a rate established by a set of standard currencies. The old monetary mole is the animal of the spaces of enclosure, but the serpent is that of the societies of control. We have passed from one animal to the other, from the mole to the serpent, in the system under which we live, but also in our manner of living and in our relations with others. The disciplinary man was a discontinuous producer of energy, but the man of control is undulatory, in orbit, in a continuous network. Everywhere surfing has already replaced the older sports.  

Types of machines are easily matched with each type of society - not that machines are determining, but because they express those social forms capable of generating them and using them. The old societies of sovereignty made use of simple machines - levers, pulleys, clocks; but the recent disciplinary societies equipped themselves with machines involving energy, with the passive danger of entropy and the active danger of sabotage; the societies of control operate with machines of a third type, computers, whose passive danger is jamming and whose active one is piracy and the introduction of viruses. This technological evolution must be, even more profoundly, a mutation of capitalism, an already well-known or familiar mutation that can be summed up as follows: nineteenthcentury capitalism is a capitalism of concentration, for production and for property. It therefore erects the factory as a space of enclosure, the capitalist being the owner of the means of production but also, progressively, the owner of other spaces conceived through analogy (the worker's familial house, the school). As for markets, they are conquered sometimes by specialization, sometimes by colonization, sometimes by lowering the costs of production. But in the present situation, capitalism is no longer involved in production, which it often relegates to the Third World, even for the complex forms of textiles, metallurgy or oil production. It's a capitalism of higher-order production. It no longer buys raw materials and no longer sells the finished products: it buys the finished products or assembles parts. What it wants to sell is services and what it wants to buy is stocks. This is no longer a capitalism for production but for the product, which is to say, for being sold or marketed. Thus it is essentially dispersive, and the factory has given way to the corporation. The family, the school, the army, the factory are no longer the distinct analogical spaces that converge towards an owner - state or private power - but coded figures - deformable and transformable - of a single corporation that now has only stockholders. Even art has left the spaces of enclosure in order to enter into the open circuits of the bank. The conquests of the market are made by grabbing control and no longer by disciplinary training, by fixing the exchange rate much more than by lowering costs, by transformation of the product more than by specialization of production. Corruption thereby gains a new power.Marketing has become the centre or the‘soul′ of the corporation.We are taught that corporations have a soul, which is the most terrifying news in the world. The operation of markets is now the instrument of social control and forms the impudent breed of our masters. Control is shortterm and of rapid rates of turnover, but also continuous and without limit, while discipline was of long duration,infinite and discontinuous. Man is no longer man enclosed, but man in debt. It is true that capitalism has retained as a constant the extreme poverty of three quarters of humanity, too poor for debt, too numerous for confinement:control will not onlyhaveto deal with erosions of frontiers but with the explosions within shanty towns or ghettos.  

# Il. Programme  

The conception of a control mechanism, giving the position of any element within an open environment at any given instant (whether animal in a reserve or human in a corporation, as with an electronic collar), is not necessarily one of science fiction. Félix Guattari has imagined a city where one would be able to leave one's apartment, one's street, one's neighborhood, thanks to one's (dividual) electronic card that raises a given barrier; but the card could just as easily be rejected on a given day or between certain hours; what counts is not the barrier but the computer that tracks each person's position - licit or illicit - and effects a universal modulation.  

The socio-technological study of the mechanisms of control, grasped at their inception, would have to be categorical and to describe what is already in the process of substitution for the disciplinary sites of enclosure, whose crisis is everywhere proclaimed. It may be that older methods, borrowed from the former societies of sovereignty, will return to the fore, but with the necessary modifications. What counts is that we are at the beginning of something. In the prison system: the attempt to find penalties of 'substitution', at least for petty crimes, and the use of electronic collars that force the convicted person to stay at home during certain hours. For the school system: continuous forms of control, and the effect on the school of perpetual training, the corresponding abandonment of all university research, the introduction of the ‘corporation' at all levels of schooling. For the hospital system: the new medicine ‘without doctor or patient' that singles out potential sick people and subjects at risk, which in no way attests to individuation - as they say -but substitutes for the individual or numerical body the code of a 'dividual' material to be controlled. In the corporate system: new ways of handling money, profits and humans that no longer pass through the old factory form. These are very small examples, but ones that will allow for better understanding of what is meant by the crisis of the institutions, which is to say, the progressive and dispersed installation of a new system of domination. One of the most important questions will concern the ineptitude of the unions: tied to the whole of their history of struggle against the disciplines or within the spaces of enclosure, will they be able to adapt themselves or will they give way to new forms of resistance against the societies of control? Can we already grasp the rough outlines of these coming forms, capable of threatening the joys of marketing? Many young people strangely boast of being ‘motivated'; they re-request apprenticeships and permanent training. It's up to them to discover what they're being made to serve, just as their elders discovered, not without difficulty, the telos of the disciplines. The coils of a serpent are even more complex than the burrows of a molehill. [.]

# Pit Schultz The Origins of the Nettime Mailing List: In Conversation with Pauline van Mourik Broekman//l997  

Pauline van Mourik Broekman Could you tell me something about how nettime was started and how it has developed since then?  

Pit Schultz Nettime started as a three-day meeting in a small theatre in Venice during the 1995 Biennale. A meeting of media activists, theoreticians, artists, journalists from different European countries (Heath Bunting, nettime comoderator Geert Lovink, Diana McCarty, Vuk Cosic, David Garcia, Nils Roeller, Tomasso Tozzi, Paul Garrin and many more). We developed the main lines of a net critique along the topics of virtual urbanism, globalization/tribalization and the life metaphor. Also it became obvious that it was necessary to define a different cultural (net)politics than the one Wired magazine represented in Europe. It was a private and intensive event, and, in a way, it defined the 'style' in which we critique and discuss issues on nettime. Nettime is somehow modelled on the table of the meeting - it was covered with texts, magazines, books, whatever we had to offer the group. It was the start of our ‘gift economy' with exchanges of information. Today the list has nearly 300 subscribers, it's growing constantly with around ten subscribers a week. We do no PR and the list is semiclosed, which means new subscriptions must be approved. [... ]  

I have to emphasize here that nettime is a group project, it is not a 'piece of individual art', but a medium formed by a collective subjectivity, a sum of individuals. I'm moderating it and it has its aesthetic aspects. But you don't have to call me an artist because of that. [...] You can call it a continuation of my art practice, but it functions without naming it art. In 1994, I tried to begin with projects on the web, especially the Orgasmotron Project (a database of recorded brain waves of human orgasms), which reflected the early euphoric times of “first contact'. [...] During these projects, it became clear that I needed a deeper understanding of the collaborative, theoretical and discursive aspects of cyberspace to continue. At this time I also gave up doing installations in defined art spaces. My main interest remains what Andreas Broeckmann calls 'machinic aesthetics', a field between the social, political and cultural economy of the so called 'new media'. [..]  

van Mourik Broekman It seems that nettime has gravitated more towards netpolitical and philosophical discussion than that directly to do with‘art' What role do you and Geert Lovink, as moderators, have with regard to that?  

Schultz Art today, especially media art, is a problematic field. When I listen to music, it may happen that I don't like it, but it comes through the radio. That's how art appears to me. You can switch it off, but there is still a lot of music around. So much for art. With the moderation, it is also a contradictory role. The less the moderator appears, the better the channel flows. It is, of course, this power-through-absence thing, but we hope that we handle it carefully and in a responsible way, with the continuous group process in mind. Power flows through networks, and you cannot switch it off. From different sides, Geert and I have an interest in working with the dynamic of the aesthetic contra the political field. There are many faultlines and frontiers. One of them seems to become the art system which still has some kind of Alleinherrschaftsanspruch [claim to autocracy]in the symbolic cultural field.This changes through new media and, even if new mediawill not make the term'art'obsolete,thereis something about the paradox between media and art, or media art, that I find deeply problematic. Both have components of totalitarian systems of representation. There is the chance that new media creates channels to redirect the flow of power. That's what nettime is made for. An experimental place for (re)mixes; something I missed for a very long time. Never perfect and always ‘in becoming', but not explicit, not descriptive but performative and pragmatic.  

Both Geert and I have our own reasons for distancing ourselves from today's 'art discourse'. You can call nettime a political project in terms of the real effects we try to trigger, in terms of conflicting debates, reflecting and criticizing the economic and social implications of the 'digital revolution'. It is a philosophical channel in terms of describing a certain 'condition', while accessing and applying traditional knowledge, including the 'postmodern' stuff. It is an aesthetic process in many aspects, while developing a collaborative writing space, experimenting with modes and styles of 'computer mediated communication'. Finally, we have the luxury of silence and don't advertise, so we don't need big investments into labels and surface - it gets spread by word of mouth - and the footer ‘cultural politics of the nets' can mean many things. It's about clouds. There is this 'field of virtuality or potentiality', multiple contexts and personae, interests and intensities which, like the social aspect, the time aspect, the knowledge and news aspect, make nettime something which modulates a flow of heterogeneous subjective objects, something with an existential aesthetic of living with nettime, (including the group, events, projects which grow here) a collective and singular info-environment which exists without the need to be named art.  

van Mourik Broekman At the discussion at DEAF96, I think you described nettime as a 'dirty' AsCll [American standard code for information interchange] channel; how'dirty' or unmoderated is it?  

Schultz Dirtiness is a concept here, especially for the digital realm, which produces its own clean dirtiness. Take the sound of digital distortion on a CD compared to the analogue distortion of vinyl. Take all kinds of digital effects imitating analogue dirtiness, which means, in the end, a higher resolution, a recursive, deeper, infinite structure. I used the concept because of its many aspects. It means here to affirm the noise aspect, but only to generate a more complex pattern out of it. It doesn't mean 'anything goes', or a self-sufficient ethic of productivity. It is slacker-ish in a way: slows down, speeds up, doesn't care at certain places, just to come back to the ones which are tactically more effective ... there is a whole empirical science behind it, how to bring the nettime ship through dark waters ... how to compress and expand, how to follow the lines of noise/pattern instead of absence/ presence ... (In fact, I pushed the big red button of the moderator mode only once, after a period of technical errors and an ensuing unfocused dialogue.)  

The phenomenon is - and I think this is not such a rare thing - that a group of people, in a repetitive, communicative environment, begin to filter a field of possible'communication acts' in a certain way, quasi-machinically. You don't have to be professional or especially skilled in the beginning. The production of information' along the borderline of noise means constantly to refine a social context, maybe an artificial one, what some call immanent. I mean with rules which are self-evident and are interdependent in a dynamic way. The list-software sends a kind of basic netiquette to the new usersbut this affects only someformal factors. One is that we decided to avoid dialogues, without forbidding them. Nettime is not a list of dialogues of quote and re-quote, but more of a discursive flow of text, of different types, 'differentializing', contextualizing each other. On the net it is called 'collaborative filtering', or earlier, it was 'social filtering'.  

Dirtiness means many things here. First of all the absence of purity - you always have mixtures, agencements, but this becomes too trivially 'postmodern'. The constant commentary, forming a socially defined body of knowledge and, of course, a field where power is generated out of undifferentiated forces - which includes the position of the moderators or other very active participants - for defining where the scope of the flow tends to go. But, actually, anyone can post whatever she likes. This risk,which often leads to a situation of overflow and reorientation, is also the productive freedom of nettime.Another is the limited set of signs, like the Euro-English or net-pidgin, using English as a non-native speaker or the reduced character set of AsCll, or the minimal features of the perl-scripts which run the mailing list. Finally, for the authors, there is always a multiple aspect of why to write and, for the readers, why to read nettime. You definitely have to filter; I guess nobody, including me, reads every mail from start to finish. The sender has the chance to select actively the texts she finds on the net and forward them. The author can pre- or republish texts, send pre-versions, test certain ideas or sample others. On the material side, there are the printouts of ZKP [Zentrum fur Kunstprojekte] readers which come out in small numbers during conferences. The process of inscription, combined with a filtering process, functions a bit like a news-ticker, if you want to find a comparison in the publishing world. [...]  

van Mourik Broekman You've talked about the importance of editors being sensitive to the exchange economies of the nets; these many economies intertwine, they are not separate, are they? Highly commercial and competitive ones share technologies, content and 'participants' (for want of a better word) with ones that are more clearly like the potlatch economy. In practice, what has been your experience of keeping nettime independent within this situation?  

Schultz These economiesintertwine,but not without friction.From the view of the poor, there is the need to disrespect certain economic barriers, for example, licences and copyright. That's what is happening in many Eastern countries. The new markets are not functioning like they promised to, at least not for all. There are still manychances to use new technology as a tool, to reach more independence, but it also gets used in the other way for a huge Darwinist' shake-out. And, as one can see with Microsoft, it is not at all the best who survive. So I strongly resist any logic of pre-affirming the situation. Potlatch is only a circumscription of a kind of exchange economy, which is pretty common as soon as you have the privilege to do so.I am sure that we will face models which are based on certain local exclusions of the money economy. Any family, community or friendship is based on such models. Finally, you need the friction, the potential of mixed economies, for a vivid and creative market, at least from what I understand about markets.  

van Mourik Broekman This links with one of the ongoing discussions on nettime, the one to do with libertarianism or neoliberalism and social justice. It has, over time, involved posting extensive ‘dialogues' on the role of Wired and the demonization of the state, and has been presented as an attempt to start generating a productive, European contribution to the development of ideas on techno-cultural political organization for the future. Is this right, and how do you feelit isgoing?  

Schultz You can describe it likethat, but I don't like to make predictions here. One thing nettime does is critique. This means it reflects and constructs the present. Of course, there are strategies, and part of a strategy is that one should not talk too much about it. The important task is not to give up against the homogenizing, centralizing and alienating networks of a global integrated capitalism, to use these very ethical-political techniques as ‘cultural ones, to push against what is forced on us as 'economic factors' in favour of a necessary quality. [...]  

through the usual meritocratic mediations, thanks to favours (the Freemasons) and sometimes by resorting to patently illegal methods (the Mafia).  

The term has been rehabilitated owing to a particular historical conjunction, characterized by the development of computer networks opening up possibilities of long-distance work and collaboration in real time, and by the search in the social sciences for concepts with which to identify structures that are minimally hierarchical (if at all so), flexible, and not restricted by boundaries marked out a priori. As an existing concept, constructed around contemporary ideas, technologies and research, associated with a specific vocabulary, models of causality and mathematical models, and formed to offer an alternative to hierarchical algorithms, 'network' naturally enough finds itself mobilized by capitalism. Employed in academic works in economics and the sociology of work - disciplines that helped to provide management with its theoretical foundations - it was almost bound to invade the literature addressed to cadres that we have studied. This is how the forms of capitalist production accede to representation in each epoch, by mobilizing concepts and tools that were initially developed largely autonomously in the theoretical sphere or the domain of basic scientific research. This is the case with neurology and computer science today. In the past, it was true of such notions as system, structure, technostructure, energy, entropy, evolution, dynamics and exponential growth.  

Social life today is no longer presented in the form of a series of rights and duties towards an extended familial community, as in a domestic world; or in the form of the wage-earning class within a hierarchical body whose rungs one climbs, where one spends one's whole career, and where professional activity is clearly separated from the private sphere, as in an industrial world. In a reticular world social life is composed of a proliferation of encounters and temporary but reactivatable connections with various groups, operated at a potentially considerable social, professional, geographical and cultural distance. The project is the occasion and reason for the connection. It temporarily assembles a very disparate group of people, and presents itself as a highly activated section of network for a period of time that is relatively short, but allows for the construction of more enduring links that will be put on hold while remaining available. Projects make production and accumulation possible in a world which, were it to be purely connectionist, would simply contain flows, where nothing could be stabilized, accumulated or crystallized. Everything would be carried off in an endless stream of ephemeral associations which, given their capacity to put everything in communication, constantly distribute and dissolve whatever gels in them. The project is precisely a mass of active connections apt to create forms - that is to say, bring objects and subjects into existence - by stabilizing certain connections and making them irreversible.  

It is thus a temporary pocket of accumulation which, creating value, provides a base for the requirement of extending the network by furthering connections.  

New maxims for success accompany the establishment of such a world, and a new system of values is constructed on which people can rely to make judgements; to discriminate between behaviour that is satisfactory and behaviour that leads to exclusion; to put a value on qualities and attitudes that had not hitherto been identified as distinctive; to legitimate new positions of power; and to select those who are to enjoy them.  

We have endeavoured to bring out this new system of values by indentifying anything in the management literature that seemed to us specific and unprecedented, particularly compared with the dominantvalues of the 1960s. In order to put this in relief, and reveal its systematic character, we have codified it using the grammar of cities presented in De la justification [On Justification: The Economies of Worth, 1991]. This has led us to construct a seventh city - the projective city [...]. Obviously, the 1990s texts do not contain only the rhetoric of projects. In them, though to very different degrees, we find references to other logics of action - for example, commercial, industrial or reputational logics. In accordance with the methodology of ideal types, however, we have tried to extract from the most recent management texts whatever marked them out as singular, without stressing the more familiar features - for example, all those referring to an industrial logic - which are still present.  

For reasons it is advisable to explain, given that the term might seem unwieldy and rather unclear, we have chosen to call the new apparatus of justification that seems to us to be being formed the 'projective city'. It is in fact modelled on a term that frequently crops up in management literature: project organization. This refers to a firm whose structure comprises a multiplicity of projects associating a variety of people, some of whom participate in several projects. Since the very nature of this type of project is to have a beginning and an end, projects succeed and take over from one another, reconstructing work groups or teams in accordance with priorities or needs.By analogy, we shallrefer to a social structure in project form or a general organization of society in project form. [...]  

# Michael Hardt and Antonio Negri NetworkProduction//2000  

The first geographical consequence of the passage from an industrial to an informational economy is a dramatic decentralization of production. The processes of modernization and the passage to the industrial paradigm provoked the intense aggregation of productive forces and mass migrations of labour power towards centres that became factory cities, such as Manchester, Osaka and Detroit. Efficiency of mass industrial production depended on the concentration and proximity of elements in order to create the factory site and facilitate transportation and communication. The informatization of industry and the rising dominance of service production,however,have made such concentration of production no longer necessary. Size and efficiency are no longer linearly related; in fact, large scale has in many cases become a hindrance. Advances in telecommunications and information technologies have made possible a deterritorialization of production that has effectively dispensed the mass factories and evacuated the factory cities. Communication and control can be exercised efficiently at a distance, and in some cases immaterial products can be transported across the world with minimal delay and expense. Several different production facilities can be coordinated in the simultaneous production of a single commodity in such a way that factories can be dispersed to various locations. In some sectors even the factory site itself can be done away with as its workers communicate exclusively through new information technologies.  

In the passage to the informational economy, the assembly line has been replaced by the network as the organizational model of production, transforming the forms of cooperation and communication within each productive site and among productive sites. The mass industrial factory defined the circuits of labouring cooperation primarily through the physical deployments of workers on the shop floor. Individual workers communicated with their neighbouring workers, and communication was generally limited to physical proximity. Cooperation among production sites also required physical proximity, both to coordinate the productive cycles and to minimize the transportation costs and time of the commodities being produced. For example, the distance between the coal mine and the steel mill, and the efficiency of the lines of transportation and communication between them, are significant factors in the overall efficiency of steel production. Similarly, for automobile production the efficiency of communication and transportation among the series of subcontractors involved is crucial in the overall efficiency of the system. The passage towards informational production and the network structure of organization, in contrast, makes productive cooperation and efficiency no longer dependent to such a degree on proximity and centralization. Information technologies tend to make distances less relevant. Workers involved in a single process can effectively communicate and cooperate from remote locations without consideration to proximity. In effect, the network of labouring cooperation requires no territorial or physical centre.  

The tendency towards deterritorialization of production is even more pronounced in the processes of immaterial labour that involve the manipulation of knowledge and information. Labouring processes can be conducted in a form almost entirely compatible with communication networks, for which location and distance have very limited importance. Workers can even stay at home and log on to the network. The labour of informational production (of both services and durable goods) relies on what we can call abstract cooperation. Such labour dedicates an ever more central role to communication of knowledges and information among workers, but those cooperating workers need not be present and can even be relatively unknown to one another, or known only through the productive information exchanged. The circuit of cooperation is consolidated in the network and the commodity at an abstract level.Production sites can thus be deterritorialized and tend towards a virtual existence, as coordinates in the communication network. As opposed to the old vertical industrial and corporate model, production now tends to be organized in horizontal network enterprises.  

The information networks also release production from territorial constraints in so far as they tend to put the producer in direct contact with the consumer regardless of the distance between them. Bill Gates, the co-founder of the Microsoft Corporation, takes this tendency to an extreme when he predicts a future in which networks will overcome entirely the barriers to circulation and allow an ideal, \*friction-free' capitalism to emerge: 'The information highway will extend the electronic marketplace and make it the ultimate go-between, the universal middleman' If Gates' vision were to be realized, the networks would tend to reduce all distance and make transactions immediate. Sites of production and sites of consumption would then be present to one another, regardless ofgeographical location.  

Thesetendenciestowardsthedeterritorialization ofproductionandthe increased mobility of capital are not absolute, and there are significant countervailing tendencies, but to the extent that they do proceed, they place labour in a weakened bargaining position. In the era of the Fordist organization of industrial mass production capital was bound to a specific territory and thus to dealing contractually with a limited labouring population. The informatization of production and the increasing importance of immaterial production have tended to free capital from the constraints of territory and bargaining. Capital can withdraw from negotiation with a given local population by moving its site to another point in the global network - or merely by using the potential to move as a weapon in negotiations. Entire labouring populations, which had enjoyed a certain stability and contractual power, have thus found themselves in increasingly precarious employment situations. Once the bargaining position of labour has been weakened, network production can accommodate various old forms of non-guaranteed labour, such as freelance work, home work, part-time labour and piecework.  

The decentralization and global dispersal of productive processes and sites, which is characteristic of the postmodernization or informatization of the economy, provokes a corresponding centralization of the control over production. The centrifugal movement of production is balanced by the centripetal trend of command.From the local perspective, the computer networks and communications technologies internal to production systems allow for more extensive monitoring of workers from a central, remote location. Control of labouring activity can potentially be individualized and continuous in the virtual panopticon of network production. The centralization of control, however, is even more clear from a global perspective. The geographical dispersal of manufacturing has created a demand for increasingly centralized management and planning, and also for a new centralization of specialized producer services, especially financial services. Financial and trade-related services in a few key cities (such as New York, London and Tokyo) manage and direct the global networks of production. As a mass demographic shift, then, the decline and evacuation of industrial cities has corresponded to the rise of global cities, or really cities of control. [...]  

# Alexander Galloway Protocol: How Control Exists after Decentralization//2004  

[Protocol: How Control Exists after Decentralization] is about a diagram, a technology and a management style. The diagram is the distributed network, a structural form without centre that resembles a web or meshwork. The technology is the digital computer, an abstract machine able to perform the work of any other machine (provided it can be described logically). The management style is protocol, the principle of organization native to computers in distributed networks.All three come together to define a new apparatus of control that has achieved importance at the start of the new millennium.  

Much work has been done recently on theorizing the present historical moment and on offering periodizations to explain its historical trajectory. I am particularly inspired by five pages from Gilles Deleuze, ‘Postscript on Control Societies' (1990), which begin to define a chronological period after the modern age that is founded neither on the central control of the sovereign nor on the decentralized control of the prison or the factory. [Protocol] aims to flesh out the specificity of this third historical wave by focusing on the controlling computer technologies native to it.  

How would control exist after decentralization? In former times control was a little easier to explain. In what Michel Foucault called the sovereign societies of the classical era, characterized by centralized power and sovereign fiat, control existed as an extension of the word and deed of the master, assisted by violence and other coercive factors. Later, the disciplinary societies of the modern era took hold, replacing violence with more bureaucratic forms of command and control.  

Deleuze has extended this periodization into the present day by suggesting that after the disciplinary societies come the societiesof control. Deleuze believed that there exist wholly new technologies concurrent with the societies of control. ‘The old sovereign societies worked with simple machines, levers, pulleys, clocks', he writes, but recent disciplinary societies were equipped with thermodynamic machines1 .. control societies operate with a third generation of machines, with information technology and computers.2 Just as Marx rooted his economic theory in a strict analysis of the factory's productive machinery, Deleuze heralds the coming productive power of computers to explain the socio-political logics of our own age.  

According to Critical Art Ensemble (CAE), the shift from disciplinary societies to control societies goes something like this:  

Before computerized information management, the heart of institutional command and control was easy to locate. In fact, the conspicuous appearance of the halls of power was used by regimes to maintain their hegemony ... Even though the monuments of power still stand, visibly present in stable locations, the agency that maintains power is neither visible nor stable. Power no longer permanently resides in these monuments, and command and control now move about as desired.3  

The most extensive 'computerized information management' system existing today is the Internet. The Internet is a global distributed computer network. [...] At the core of networked computing is the concept of protocol. A computer protocol is a set of recommendations and rules that outline specific technical standards. [...]  

Protocol is not a new word. Prior to its usage in computing, protocol referred to any type of correct or proper behaviour within a specific system of conventions. It is an important concept in the area of social etiquette as well as in the fields of diplomacy and international relations. Etymologically it refers to a flyleaf glued to the beginning of a document, but in familiar usage the word came to mean any introductory paper summarizing the key points of a diplomatic agreement or treaty.  

However, with the advent of digital computing, the term has taken on a slightly different meaning. Now, protocols refer specifically to standards governing the implementation of specific technologies. Like their diplomatic predecessors, computer protocols establish the essential points necessary to enact an agreed upon standard of action. Like their diplomatic predecessors, computer protocols are vetted out between negotiating parties and then materialized in the real world by large populations of participants (in one case citizens, and in the other computer users). Yet instead of governing social or political practices as did their diplomatic predecessors, computer protocols govern how specific technologies are agreed to, adopted, implemented and ultimately used by people around the world.What was once a question of consideration and sense is now a question of logic and physics.  

To help understand the concept of computer protocols, consider the analogy of the highway system. Many different combinations of roads are available to a person driving from point A to point B. However, en route one is compelled to stop at red lights, stay between the white lines, follow a reasonably direct path, and so on. These conventional rules that govern the set of possible behaviour patterns within a heterogeneous system are what computer scientists call protocol. Thus, protocol is a technique for achieving voluntary regulation within a contingent environment.  

These regulations always operate at the level of coding - they encode packets of information so they may be transported; they code documents so they may be effectively parsed; they code communication so local devices may effectively communicate with foreign devices. Protocols are highly formal; that is, they encapsulate information inside a technically defined wrapper, while remaining relatively indifferent to the content of information contained within. Viewed as a whole, protocol is a distributed management system that allows control to exist within a heterogeneous material milieu.  

It is common for contemporary critics to describe the Internet as an unpredictable mass of data - rhizomatic and lacking central organization. This position states that since new communication technologies are based on the elimination of centralized command and hierarchical control, it follows that the world is witnessing a general disappearance of control as such.  

This could not be further from the truth. I argue that protocol is how technological control exists after decentralization. The 'after' in my title refers to both the historical moment after decentralization has come into existence, but also - and more important - the historical phase after decentralization, that is, after it is dead and gone, replaced as the supreme social management style by the diagram of distribution.  

What contributes to this misconception (that the Internet is chaotic rather than highly controlled), I suggest, is that protocol is based on a contradiction between two opposing machines: one machine radically distributes control into autonomous locales, the other machine focuses control into rigidly defined hierarchies.The tension between these two machines-a dialectical tensioncreates a hospitable climate for protocological control.  

Emblematic of the first machinic technology, the one that gives the Internet its common image as an uncontrollable network, is the family of protocols known as TCP/IP. TCP [Transmission Control Protocol] and IP [Internet Protocol] are the leading protocols for the actual transmission of data from one computer to another over the network. TCP and IP work together to establish connections between computers and move data packets effectively through those connections. Because of the way TCP/IP was designed, any computer on the network can talk to any other computer, resulting in a non-hierarchical, peer-to-peer relationship.  

As one technical manual puts it: IP uses an anarchic and highly distributed model, with every device being an equal peer to every other device on the global Internet.'4 (That a technical manual glowingly uses the term 'anarchic' is but one symptom of today's strange new world!)  

Emblematic of the second machinic technology, the one that focuses control into rigidly defined hierarchies, is the DNS [Domain Name System]. DNS is a large decentralized database that maps network addresses to network names. This mapping is required for nearly every network transaction. For example, in order to visit www.rhizome.org on the Internet one's computer must first translate the name www.rhizome.org, itself geographically vague, into a specific address on the physical network. These specific addresses are called IP addresses and are written as a series of four numbers, such as 206.252.131.211  

All DNs information is controlled in a hierarchical, inverted-tree structure. Ironically, then, nearly all Web traffic must submit to a hierarchical structure (DNS) to gain access to the anarchic and radically horizontal structure of the Internet. This contradictory logic is rampant throughout the apparatus of protocol.  

The process of converting domain names to IP addresses is called resolution. At the top of this inverted tree are a handful of so-called 'root' servers holding ultimate control and delegating lesser control to lower branches in the hierarchy. There are over a dozen root servers located around the world in places like Japan and Europe,aswell asinseveral Us locations.  

To follow the branches of control, one must parse the address in reverse, starting with the top-level domain, in this case'org'. First, the root server receives a request from the user and directs the user to another machine that has authority over the ‘org' domain, which in turn directs the user to another machine that has authority over the‘rhizome' subsection,which in turn returns the IP address for the specific machine known as'www'.  

Only the computer at the end of the branch knows about its immediate neighbourhood,and thus it is the only machine with authoritative DNS information. In other words, resolution happens like this: a new branch of the tree is followed at each successive segment, allowing the user to find the authoritative DNS source machine and thus to derive the IP address from the domain name. Once the IP address is known,the network transaction can proceednormally.  

Because the DNS system is structured like an inverted tree,each branch of the tree holds absolute control over everything below it. For example, in the winter of 1999, a lawsuit was brought against the Swiss art group Etoy. Even though the basis of the lawsuit was questionable and was later dropped, the courts would have been able to ‘turn off the artist's website during the course of the trial by simply removing DNS support for 'etoy.com'. ( Instead the artists were forced to pull the plug themselves until after the trial was over.)  

A similar incident happened at The Thing, an Internet service provider based in New York which was hosting some of Etoy's agitprop. After some of this material was deemed politically questionable by the FBl, the whole server was yanked off the Internet by the telecommunications company that happened to be immediately upstream from the provider. The Thing had no recourse but to complywiththis hierarchical systemof control.  

The inventor of the World Wide Web, Tim Berners-Lee, describes the DNS system as the ‘one centralized Achilles' heel by which [the Web] can all be brought down or controlled'.5  

If hypothetically some controlling authority wished to ban China from the Internet (e.g. during an outbreak of hostilities), it could do so very easily through a simple modification of the information contained in the root servers at the top of the inverted tree. Within 24 hours, China would vanish from the Internet.  

As DNS renegade and Name.Space founder Paul Garrin writes: “With the stroke of a delete key,whole countries can be blacked out from therest of the net. With the‘:[root file] centralized, this is easily done ... Control the‘' and you control access."6 Since the root servers are at the top, they have ultimate control over the existence (but not necessarily the content) of each lesser branch. Without the foundational support of the root servers, all lesser branches of the DNS network become unusable. Such a reality should shatter our image of the Internetasavast,uncontrollablemeshwork.  

Any networked relation will have multiple, nested protocols. To steal an insight from Marshall McLuhan,the content of every new protocol is always another protocol. Take, for example, a typical transaction on the World Wide Web. A Web page containing text and graphics (themselves protocological artefacts) is marked up in the HTML protocol. The protocol known as Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) encapsulates this HTML object and allows it to be served by an Internet host. However, both client and host must abide by the TCP protocol to ensure that the HTTP object arrives in one piece. Finally, TCP is itself nested within the Internet Protocol, a protocol that is in charge of actually moving data packets from one machine to another. Ultimately the entire bundle (the primary data object encapsulated within each successive protocol) is transported according to the rules of the only'privileged' protocol, that of the physical media themselves (fibre-optic cables, telephone lines, airwaves, etc.). The flexible networks and flows identified in the world economy by Manuel Castells and other anchormen of the Third Machine Age are not mere metaphors; they are in fact built directly into the technical specifications of network protocols. By design, protocols such as the Internet Protocol cannot be centralized.  

Protocol's native landscape is the distributed network. Following Deleuze, 1 consider the distributed network to be an important diagram for our current social formation. Deleuze defines the diagram as 'a map, a cartography that is coextensive with the whole social field'.7 The distributed network is such a map, for it extends deeply into the social field of the new millennium.  

A distributed network differs from other networks such as centralized and decentralized networks in the arrangement of its internal structure. A centralized network consists of a single central power point (a host), from which are attached radial nodes. The central point is connected to all of the satellite nodes, which are themselves connected only to the central host.A decentralized network,on the other hand,has multiple central hosts,each with its ownset of satellite nodes.A satellite node may have connectivity with one or more hosts, but not with other nodes. Communication generally travels unidirectionally within both centralized and decentralized networks: from the central trunks to the radial leaves.  

The distributed network is an entirely different matter. Distributed networks are native to Deleuze's control societies. Each point in a distributed network is neither acentral hubnor a satellite node-there areneither trunks nor leaves.The network contains nothing but ‘intelligent end-point systems that are selfdeterministic, allowing each end-point system to communicate with any host it chooses'8 Like the rhizome, each node in a distributed network may establish direct communication with another node, without having to appeal to a hierarchical intermediary. Yet in order to initiate communication, the two nodes must speak the same language. This is why protocol is important. Shared protocols are what defines the landscape of the network - who is connected to whom.  

As architect Branden Hookway writes: “[dlistributed systems require for their operation a homogenous standard of interconnectivity.'9 Compatible protocols lead to network articulation, while incompatible protocols lead to network disarticulation.For example, two computers running the DNS addressing protocol will be able to communicate effectively with each other about network addresses. Sharing the DNS protocol allows them to be networked. However, the same computers will not be able to communicate with foreign devices running, for example, the NIS addressing protocol or the WINS protocol.o Without a shared protocol,there isnonetwork.  

10 [17] WINS, or Windows Internet Name Service, is an addressing technology developed by Microsoft for distributed networks; NIs, or Network Information Service, is a similar technology developedbySunMicrosystems.

# Lane Relyea Your Art World, or The Limits of Connectivity//2006  

For starters,consider the lounge. What exhibition today is complete without one? A good example was provided by ‘Be Creative! Der Kreative Imperativ', a show that opened at Zurich's Design Museum in late 2002. Participants ranging from artists and designers to architects and theorists contributed projects, research data, software and commentary devoted to the themes of neoliberal economic policy, flexible business management and immaterial labour. To get a sense of the show's layout, think hip dotcom startup. Or, in the words of its curator, the Swiss artist Marion von Osten,'a modern space for living and working, ranging from the loft to the open-plan office, alternating production and regeneration, and using game tables, advisory literature and chillout zones'!  

Nowcompare this to themore recent‘MakeYour Own Life:Artists In& Out of Cologne' at the Philadelphia ICA, a show with a similar sounding title, also phrased in the imperative - only, rather than be creative',its command, following the marketing trend ignited by the popularity of websites such as MySpace and YouTube, was to customize and personalize, to be self-creative. ('Our', 'my' and 'your' are consumer empowerment I words', notes Manning Field, senior vice president for brand management at Chase Card Services.)2 Whereas the Zurich show openly worried over the post-Fordist production protocols it critically mimed - 'this idea of economics', according to Osten, ‘based on talent and initiative, [in which] cuts in social and cultural spending are legitimized under the paradigm of theself-sufficiencyof(cultural) entrepreneurs'- the Philadelphia show stressed more the liberating promise which the creative personality holds out to society. Rather than flexibility, it talked about autonomy; rather than fret over neoliberal appropriations of the artist as an idealization of entrepreneurial subjectivity, it pondered ‘the possibilities of artistic agency ... artists creating themselves.'3 It, too, featured a lounge.  

Who relaxes in these things? Who doesn't instead feel a strong ambivalence, if not irritation, when happening upon the lounge? Of course, the irritation is the best part. Contradictions bottleneck here. Whether lounge, reading room or 'chillout zone' (the one in Philadelphia came outfitted with turntable, CD player, library of choice recordings and couch), typically such a place is meant to signify a progressive artistic or curatorial approach to exhibitions, one that privileges context and process over discrete objects, that turns away from static commodity display in favour of a more dynamic environment of ongoing, interactive meaning production. The lounge demonstrates how 'meaning is fugitive ... beyond the object or image as such ... complexly wound up with social dynamics, to quote curator Bennett Simpson from the Make Your Own Life catalogue. Or, as phrased in the press release for the group show“When Artists Say We'at New York's Artists Space last spring, 'art - made individually or as a collective - is constituted from within such exchange.'  

But the lounge as organic social oasis sprouting in the middle of the staid institution answers other agendas as well. With the spread of instrumentalized and instrumentalizing communications technology, social exchange is increasingly ensnared within the logic of commodity exchange. The lounge descends from that hybrid architectural offspring of the New Economy, what Starbucks founder and chairman Howard Schultz famously calls 'the third place', a casual multi-use site mixing home and office, business and leisure, private and public, production and consumption, a space equally amenable to group brainstorming, websurfing and poetry readings.Businesses adopt it as workspace as do retailers for peddling goods. Ample La-Z-Boys, errant reading material, background tunes and palpable ambiance now come standard in not only the new project-oriented office configurations, but also in what's called 'community-centric retailing' - from the small lounge-ish satellites of big-box outlets like Best Buy to redesigned bank branches that serve espresso drinks and offer yoga classes.4  

This isn't just a matter of conjuring ‘parallels' between superstructure and base. As surplus value grows frothier around such intangible and instantly obsolete commodities as events, services, affective experiences and word-ofmouth buzz, and as business practice increasingly relies on networking, on the accumulating and maintaining of contacts and the ability to access and move nimbly between myriad social circles, art institutions as well scramble to find ways, in the words of Anthony Davies and Simon Ford, 'to formalize informality ... [to] provide what are essentially convergence zones for corporate and creative networks to interact, overlap with one another and form ‘weak' ties. The prominence that events such as charity auctions, exhibition openings, talk programmes and award dinners have attained demonstrates how central faceto-face social interaction is to the functional capacity of these new alliances'.5  

No question the lounge is part of a trend - but towards what? More creative social spontaneity or more chronically intermittent employment with longer 'immaterial' work hours and no benefits? Are we witnessing the fulfilment of that long-sought avant-garde dream of merging art and life, or is this merger more corporate than utopian, more the implementation of neoliberal strategic goals for a fully freelance economy, one staffed by highly motivated, underpaid, short-term and subcontracted creative types for whom, in Osten's words,'artists and designers are taken as the model?'6 Is the public sphere being refashioned in the image of intense and intimate artistic collaboration, or is it being further fragmented by the narcissisms and nepotisms of ego-casting and in-clubbing, paved over by the privatizations and exclusions of controlled-access cybersocializing. Given the business class's new mantra of'network or perish', is the lounge a glorious expansion of freedom or the new key to capitalist survival?  

As the Zurich and Philadelphia shows illustrate, discussion of this topic appears to have unfurled somewhat asymmetrically on the two sides of the Atlantic. Many artists and critics, especially in Europe, do in fact pay heed to the emerging characteristics of the New Economy, or what ex-Al Gore speechwriter Daniel Pink envisioned as ‘Free Agent Nation' and the Tony Blair government pithily calls ‘The Talent Economy', although little analysis has been devoted to how such macro-trends specifically interact with developments internal to art practice.7 On the other hand, when focus stays trained on such art innovations as service-oriented projects and relational aesthetics, or the re-emergence of collectives and multiple or fictive identities, these developments tend to get talked about as if they were transpiring under the Old Economy. Despite vague references to the ‘chaos of global culture in the information age', artists still garner applause for the sheer feat of avoiding categorization and not making objects.8 But given the contemporary art world's complex realities, with its vast institutionalization, its more diverse, 'collaborative' forms of patronage, its mixed public, private and corporate revenue streams, and its decisive influence on the global jockeying of municipal and even regional economies, critical reckoning has more on its hands than just finger-wagging at the cash purchase of stretched canvas. Mobility, fluidity, flux and unpredictability have been catechisms of corporate managers for at least the past decade. And yet these very same words were used repeatedly to not only pitch this year's Whitney Biennial but vouch for its‘criticality'. Curators Chrissie Iles and Philippe Vergne likened the show to a big ‘cabaret, as if to suggest a kind of mega-lounge, the ‘third place' writ spectacularly - but of course their intended point of reference was instead Cabaret Voltaire and the avant-garde interventions of nearly a hundred years ago. The other Biennial theme, about collectives and pseudo-identities, the curators described as 'a way of creating a space outside the market: a space where things can't be pinned down so easily and exchanged ... so that the artist isn't directly accessible'9 Tell that to John Kelsey, a critic for Artforum and, as cofounder of the Bernadette Corporation and director of Reena Spaulings, a Biennial participant twice over.‘In part because of "this mystique around the collective", the Wall Street Journal quotes Kelsey in an article on the Spaulings Gallery's part in the pseudonyms fad, 'at a recent show, works sold quickly'.10  

Staking a position outside and opposed to 'the system' is definitely no cinch thesedays-especiallywhenthesystemfeedsoffsegmentationand diversification (if not diversity), collapsing a sense of inside and outside, as attempts to participate result in isolation while renunciations and refusals are recouped as participation. Nor is mounting some purge of all forms of art world complicity a solution - if only because not much of interest would be left. What would help, though, is a thorough transvaluing of critical art discourse and its objects, starting with a reassessment and reproblematizing of the current situation and its determinants from a more up-to-date and relevant perspective. This at least would overcome the hypocrisy of basing claims for the superiority of relational and performative art forms on a static, reified caricature of their conditions. At the same time, analysis needs to go beyond general social processes, beyond even such art world infrastructure as kunsthallen and galleries and their mixed economic support; it needs to engage art practice itself, its material, structural and genealogical specificities, so as to avoid the kind of mechanistic account of cultural forms as predestined by causes firmly planted elsewhere. The point is to not reduce art but hopefully lay some necessary groundwork for elaborating whatever options it may still have available.  

Only the briefest attempt at such a genealogy is possible here. To wit: much art practice today can be seen as developing from an apparent reconciliation of two separate but related trends that dominated the 1980s. On the one hand, there was the prevalence of art rooted in the street cultures of hip-hop, punk and new wave, as well as in DIY and activist politics, all of which conformed to the sociologically grounded, Gramscian arguments about signifying practices and bricolage put forward by people like Stuart Hall, Dick Hebdige and Michel de Certeau. At the same time, much art production and reception was also framed within a more philosophically-minded, totalizing Frankfurt School portrayal of culture as monolithic, dictatorial and pacifying, according to which floating signifiers, usually in the form of glass-encased media images and isolated statuesque commodities, colonized and privatized social relations within an industrially-produced mass spectacle.  

By the end of the 1980s, this latter trend seemed to recede behind the Cultural Studies paradigm and its focus on everyday practice, as well as what Hal Foster has called ‘the return of the real’ - the re-emergence, that is, of the situated and material body, of Otherness and abjection. But interest in the body didn't so much reject as make more material the previous notion of media, thickening it and also making it more local. Media came to reference as much fanzines, protest flyers and other empowerments of the corner copy shop as it did multi-million-dollar Madison Avenue propaganda campaigns. Appropriation was folded into bricolage, or what Claude Lévi-Strauss called 'the science of the concrete'; it entailed handling, adapting and piecing together things. Heterogeneity, which signalled channelsurfing schizophrenia in David Salle's paintings, a decade later stood for a healthy and welcoming capaciousness in Laura Owens' canvases - as if she undertook painting the way one might collect records, as a (sub? )cultural practice. Or compare Richard Prince's early eighties media appropriations with Elizabeth Peyton's later renderings of celebrities, or Barbara Kruger's media scripts with the handwritten pedestrian communiques facilitated by Gillian Wearing. Or, more simply.juxtapose Peter Halley quoting Baudrillard in 1983 and publishing Index magazine in 1996. In the work of Mike Kelley and Jim Shaw, shopping segued into thrifting: with Wolfgang Tillmans, thrifting turned fashion into street fashion. What seemed at the beginning of the nineties as an opposition between the apparitions of spectacle and the opacities of embodiment and trauma soon disappeared as artists instead embraced a middle ground between the two - the realm of everyday life and common cultural exchange. Not superstar celebrities or abject flesh but people wearing clothes, eating food and hanging out with friends.  

Such a synopsis hews closely to several accounts already written of the nineties, especially the one canonized by Nicolas Bourriaud in his books Relational Aesthetics (1998) and Postproduction(2001). The notion of artistic practice that comes to theforehere hassupposedlylittle to dowith the stereotype of the lone genius who transmutes raw matter in the isolation of the studio. Rather, it's about intervening in everyday materials that are themselves continuous and interwoven with larger communities and cultures; and it's also about identity as an ongoing construction always inclusive of and open to larger systems of exchange. Under these terms, subjectivity is shown to be performed rather than accreted individually or adopted and reproduced passively. At the same time, 'artists who insert their work into that of others', as Bourriaud explains,^contribute to the eradication of the traditional distinction between production and consumption, creation and copy, readymade and original work'. The antithesis pitting creative hero against conformist consumer is thus transcended in the figure of the bricoleur - or, to list Bourriaud's favoured exemplars, the DJ, programmer and web surfer, all “"semionauts" who produce original pathways through signs'12 With the appearance of the programmer or semionaut, consumption is no longer seen as such an evil, or even much of a problem. Indeed, it suddenly becomes redemptive, not just a part of practice but a special labour in itself, a providential skill, a form of artistic know-how that encompasses the whole of daily activity, the cobbling together of the information bits that temporarily constitute one's 'self' and one's 'community'. Signature style gives way to signature code.  

As described by Bourriaud, signifyingpractices grow more general and abstract during the course of the nineties, less anchored to the specific politics of local semiotic skirmishes. Instead, 'the market become[s] the omnipresent referent for contemporary artistic practices'13 In Bourriaud's christening of the market as master paradigm,it's possible to recognize the return from exile of forces that had formerly gone under the names of spectacle and culture industry. Sign production now back-peddles awayfrom Levi-Strauss's bricolage to approximate more closely than ever Baudrillard's simulation. The ‘homologies' artists string together are less about the coherence of subcultural politics than about the aesthetics of integrated end-to-end product design - design as a ‘total way of life'. And while practice remains beholden to an additive rather than subtractive mode, it's less about reckoning with sculptural materiality than about sequencing articulated differences so as to manipulate and exploit signification. Artists today program forms more than they compose them', exclaims Bourriaud, 'they remix available forms and make use of data ... [they] surf on a network of signs'.14  

This is where activity in the arena of art begins to produce certain unquestioned analogies with developments in other spheres, to affirm and be affirmed by, say, official economic and political policy. During the eighties, Thatcher and Reagan provided art with plenty of handy tropes about the tyranny of the all-powerful image, while Evil Empire foreign policy and culture-wars domestic policy were met with what many worried was an over-politicization of culture. In the nineties, however, as much post-Cold War politics encouraged instead the economization of culture, an oppositional art becomes harder to discern. Or at least as portrayed by Bourriaud, nineties practices - in which resourceful DIY artists nurture myriad forms of convivial exchange - can be seen to complement the euphemisms of entrepreneurialinitiativeandindividualresponsibilityusedtosell theagendas of the Clinton and Blair regimes, namely their placating of business and financial markets by rolling back state assistance programmes and ‘ending welfare as we know it'. The recent 'social turn' in art has had as part of its context neoliberal policies that are at base anti-social.  

In terms of economics, another change in the surrounding context of art production is the revamping of business models in response to the impact of new information technologies on marketplace dynamics. That consumers have grown less passive with the replacement of television's few big networks by desktop interface and the web is certainly not headline news anymore. Marketers have long turned their gunsites on their own version of the bricoleur, what they call the‘prosumer'- customers who no longer feel hostage to standardized commodities, who instead customize the design specifications of online merchandise, who invent their own idiosyncratic flavours at DiY ice cream parlours like Cold Stone,who subscribe to cable rather than watch ad-based broadcast television, who even subscribe to ad-free satellite radio; customers who download and sort through MP3s and personalize TV programming using TiVo, who publish writing, photography and more on blogs and personal websites. “The market today', writes Douglas B. Holt, Professor of Marketing at Oxford's School of Business, ‘thrives on ... unruly bricoleurs who engage in nonconformist producerly consumption practices'15 Product differentiation is no longer purely a manufacturing and retail strategy, a staple of planned obsolescence and the staving off of overproduction - rather than forced on consumers, it's now demanded and implemented by them. Increasingly value is encoded in practices not objects, and it's consumer practices that take over much of the value-adding for the market. That this is very much still a matter of highly structured markets, not some romantic form of off-the-books subcultural barter, gets harder to deny every day. Rupert Murdoch's News Corporation, for example, has redrawn its entire corporate strategy around its recent acquisition of MySpace, while such music behemoths as EMI and Universal now debut CDs that include software encouraging customers to remix tracks (the recent Billy Joel \$60 box set comes encoded with a program called Umixlt).16 It's as if the pronouns Barbara Kruger assigned to authoritarian media images in the eighties had switched sides. Give credit, then, to Sony BMG Music Entertainment for 'challenging authorship'. Even Charles Saatchi has caught the wave,'subverting' the dealer system by launching the website YourGallery.com.  

Allof which istosay that, aswith everyother form oflabourundertheNew Economy, so too has value production in the consumer marketplace become relational, dialogical, networked. The commodity, like the postmodern artwork, has relaxed its former pretenses to autonomy. The bricoleur, or what Bourriaud fancies the ‘programmer, encounters a landscape of ever more responsive, yielding, programmable commodities. Fewer and fewer objects appear as if fully formed on supermarket shelves,where theylie inwait for a mass audience to which their mass-produced, prepackaged meaning can be dictated. Now the meeting between product and customer, entertainer and entertainee, creation and connoisseur happens as if directly and individually, one-to-one, with each side demanding immediate interface and feedback. Outright acceptance or rejection may have been options appropriate for the closed object, but what's required now is constant negotiation, vigilant involvement. In other words: consumption as a more dynamic environment of ongoing, interactive meaning production. In this way, contemporary market transactions find a quite suitable counterpart in those art-world forms that are said to supercede the studio and museum - namely, all those laboratory-like kunstverein, those project rooms and, yes, ubiquitous lounges, as well as all the prosumer art that appoints them.  

If the studio and museum stood for the lamentable division between the spheres of production and consumption, the lounge counters this with a space of fluid interchange between objects, activities and people, a connectivity to mend the split. What the lounge‘exhibits'is networking itself. And yet this too can be seen as a conciliation to the New Economy. The network is, after all, the exemplary figure of post-Fordism, compared to which all the former static, box-like arenas - the factories and unions, disciplines and vocations, parties and ideologies, all the bounded forms that had mediated the space between subjects and objects, securing the sense of stable interiority required for the projecting and investing of meaning from the one onto the other - have proven not nearly flexible enough. Such former 'moulds' of enclosure now give way to what Gilles Deleuze has called 'modulation, like a self-deforming cast that will continuously change from one moment to the other, or like a sieve whose mesh will transmute from point to point'.17 Ergo the network, with its one-to-one connections and additive, combinatory logic replacing the organization's former pyramidal hierarchy and hard external shell. The network privileges casual, weak ties over formal commitments so as to heighten the possibility of chanced-upon associational linkups that lead outward from any one communicational nexus or group. As dot-com start-ups were among the first to prove, this is the new formula for success, in business as in culture: namely, a loose collection of intimates whose cryptic projects attain global buzz, thus optimizing the structural capacities of constellated, overlapping networks, where production of authentic intensity is always already exteriorized as signification within the sprawling exchange system that motivates it. Or, put another way, practice as no longer isolated but always inclusive of and open to larger systems of exchange. Think of the YBAs and the 'Swinging London' phenomenon, or LA's fabled Chinatown art scene, or the Cologne milieu adored by Make Your Own Life', all examples of how the production of local-ness that such place-names  imply  is dependent upon  its exportation  for  international consumption, and thus upon the abolition of the local as such. The same with fictive identities or other alluring logos - all gain definition only as functions within a larger, comprehensive set, as values emanating from a system.18  

Here again the rage for conviviality in art gets expressed in the face of a larger crisis concerning social cohesion. As network connectivity obliges that objects lose their set boundaries to become more responsive, so too do subjects shed long term loyalties and identifications to become better operators who mesh transparently with the system's mobile operations. With the rise of the network, the labour market fills with its own version of responsive commodities, as acrossthe-board pay scales are replaced by more personalized jobs - that is, by differentiated contracts laden with incentive clauses and bonuses based on individual performance expectations (much like insurance contracts that set premiums by tabulating a spectrum of personal data-credit rating, driving record, family health history, etc.). One competes against oneself. To work at home and be your own boss means setting not only your own work hours and dress codes (like an artist!) but also performance criteria and production levels. The result is that the definition and value of labour become less social and more private, more abstract and intransitive. The goal of work is now to bulk-up one's resume and gather more contacts in anticipation of the inevitable layoff and the need once again tofind new employment.  

Given this context, it's hard to see how the networked forms of recent art, from relational aesthetics to multiple and fictive artist-identities, can be taken as inherently oppositional. On the contrary, at least on the level of form, they seem to not oppose the dominant system but ‘surf its leading edge, where they romanticize and idealize current conditions and thus serve as an ideological asset rather than a critique. Indeed, to claim the authenticity of a position ‘outside' no longer automatically translates into resistance. As with subjects and objects, so too does the distinction between inside and outside get voided by the network structure. To be “inside' the network already means being outside - or, as Harvard management guru John Kotter advises his students, it's now better 'to be on the outside rather than the inside' of organizations and institutions.19 It's better, that is, to be a business consultant, or perhaps an ‘infomediary' like Martha Stewart or Oprah Winfrey. Likewise, Anthony Davies and Simon Ford note the emergence of the‘culturepreneur' -‘a new“artist" ... that claims professional status as a “broker"; a mediator rather than producer.'20  

Is this what's become of the bricoleur? Has that‘jack of all trades'matured into a fragmented, manoeuvrable subject able to flit from one job or social circle to another, adopting whatever called-upon behaviour the situation requires, the self as diversified portfolio, as corporate enterprise? Is the bricoleur now merely a euphemism for today's ‘flexible personality, the name Brian Holmes has coined for the form of subjectivation mandated by the New Economy - 'a new form of social control ... a distorted form of the artistic revolt against authoritarianism and standardization'?21 Holmes quotes Paolo Virno on the cynicism and ‘unbounded opportunism' that characterize this new subject, ‘who confronts a flux of interchangeable possibilities, keeping open as many as possible'. An ornithologist among birds, the flexible personality is “into' many things, but refuses to say what exactly he or she 'is' or 'does'. Identity itself is approached opportunistically. Calculation becomes the practice of everyday life, and social life becomes yet one more object of practice, a constantly recoded network of potentially valuable contacts and associates, so many articulated differences to exploit for signification. One vigilantly works the scene.‘The true opportunist', Holmes concludes, ‘consents to a fresh advantage within any new language game, even if it is political. Politics collapses into the flexibility and rapid turnover times of market relations.'  

All of the above should not be taken as an argument against the need for artists to adapt to changes in their lived situation, for them to learn how to work the new terrain and expropriate its resources. In a recent interview, the New York-based artist Aleksandra Mir, who has tracked aspects of the New Economy in her own work, summed up many of the practical issues confronting artists today.'Only in the last two years of my fifteen years of practice', Mir says, “have I developed relationships with galleries, museums and the art market, but I still don't depend on it. I still use the basic entrepreneurial skills I had learned from earlier practices: how to do something from nothing, how to drum up resources on sheer enthusiasm, how to find exchange values in everything from favours, swaps to corporate sponsorships, how to execute a ton of various tasks single handedly ... There is no clear-cut formula ever of what will happen, but there is a steady continuum in this incoherence.'22 What I've tried to add to such a description is simply a vantage from which to problematize this terrain to a degree appropriate to the aims of art. That recent expressions of those aims - fluidity and indeterminacy, shared creativity, freedom within community, utopia - often get phrased in the transactional terms and figures of market relations proves just how boundless is the current reach of economic reasoning. Once we've completely disabused ourselves of the fiction of artistic autonomy, is the market really the only arena imaginable in which to enact ‘free' subjectivity? Does the entrepreneur only model subjects who ‘freely’ instrumentalize themselves? If so, which artistic acts are still able to ground themselves in a recognition of such conditions?  

Perhaps it's true that, as has been argued from different political corners of late, what most characterizes our historical moment is nothing less than the end of the social.23 If so, this itself could open certain opportunities - specifically, a chance to rethink the meanings and possibilities of community over society. In such a project the role of art, especially certain developments associated with relational aesthetics, could be incalculable. But given that such work has hardly got off the ground, and that, until it does, the grip of the market continues to tighten, many of the values currently promoted by the art world - spectacular but hollow identity, loose and numerous affiliations, hyper-mobility and circulation, opportunistic interventions as if in any situation or ensemble anywhere, the recombining of 'data' indefinitely - all these risk romanticizing the reigning logic of exchangeability and the very real dangers of our increasing vulnerability to the moment-to-moment fluctuations of global capital.

# Manuel Castells Communication Power//2009  

[... A networkis a setof interconnected nodes. Nodes may beofvarying relevance to the network, and so particularly important nodes are called 'centres' in some versions of network theory. Still, any componentof a network(including'centres') is a node and its function and meaning depend on the programs of the network and on its interaction with other nodes in the network. Nodes increase their importance for the network by absorbing more relevant information, and processing it more efficiently. The relative importance of a node does not stem from its specific features but from its ability to contribute to the network's effectiveness in achieving its goals, as defined by the values and interests programd into the networks. However, all nodes of a network are necessary for the network's performance, although networks allow for some redundancy as a safeguard for their proper functioning. When nodes become unnecessary for the fulflment of the networks' goals, networks tend to reconfigure themselves, deleting some nodes, and adding new ones. Nodes only exist and function as components of networks. The network is the unit, not the node.  

In social life, networks are communicative structures. ‘Communication networks are the patterns of contact that are created by the flow of messages among communicators through time and space' (Peter Monge and Noshir Contractor, Theories of Communication Networks, 2003: 3). So, networks, process flows. Flows are streams of information between nodes, circulating through the channels of connection between nodes. A network is defined by the program that assigns the network its goals and its rules of performance. This program is made of codes that include valuation of performance and criteria for success or failure. In social and organizational networks, social actors, fostering their values and interests, and in interaction with other social actors, are at the origin of the creation and programming of networks. Yet, once set and programd, networks follow the instructions inscribed in their operating system, and become capable of self-configuration within the parameters of their assigned goals and procedures. To alter the outcomes of the network, a new program (a set of goal-oriented, compatible codes) needs to be installed in the network - from outside the network.  

Networks (and the sets of interests and values they embody) cooperate or compete with each other. Cooperation is based on the ability to communicate between networks. This ability depends on the existence of codes of translation and inter-operability between the networks (protocols of communication) and on access to connecting points (switches). Competition depends on the ability to outperform other networks by superior efficiency in performance or in cooperation capacity. Competition may also take a destructive form by disrupting the switchers of competing networks and/or interfering with their communication protocols. Networks work on a binary logic: inclusion/exclusion. Within the network, distance between nodes tends toward zero when every node is directly connected to every other node. Between nodes in the network and outside the network, distance is infinite, since there is no access unless the program of the network is changed. When nodes in the network are clustered, networks follow the logic of small worlds' properties: nodes are able to connect with a limited number of steps to the entire network and related networks from any node in the network (Duncan Watts and Steven Strogatz, ‘Collective Dynamics of “Small World" Networks', Nature, June 1998). In the case of communication networks, I would add the condition of sharing protocols of communication.  

Thus networks are complex structures of communication constructed around a set of goals that simultaneously ensure unity of purpose and flexibility of execution by their adaptability to the operating environment. They are programmed and self-configurable at the same time. Their goals and operating procedures are programmed, in social and organizational networks, by social actors. Their structure evolves according to the capacity of the network to selfconfigure in an endless search for more efficient networking arrangements.  

Networks are not specific to twenty-first-century societies or, for that matter, tohumanorganization (Mark Buchanan,Nexus: Small Worlds and the Groundbreaking ScienceofNetworks, 2002). Networks constitute the fundamental pattern of life, of all kinds of life. As Fritjof Capra writes, 'the network is a pattern that is common to all life. Wherever we see life, we see networks' (The Hidden Connections, 2002: 9). In social life, social network analysts have long investigated the dynamic of social networks at the heart of social interaction and the production of meaning (Ronald Burt, Relational Contents in Multiple Network Systems,1980),leading to the formulation of a systematic theory of communication networks (Monge and Contractor, op. cit., 2003). Furthermore, in terms of social structure, archaeologists and historians of antiquity have forcefully reminded us that the historical record shows the pervasiveness and relevance of networks as the backbone of societies, thousands of years ago, in the most advanced ancient civilizations in several regions of the planet. Indeed, if we transfer the notion of globalization into the geography of the ancient world, as determined by available transportation technologies, there was networked globalization of a sort in antiquity, as societies depended on the connectivity of their main activities to networks transcending the limits of their locality for their livelihood, resources and power (G. LaBianca, Exploring the  

Social Ledger: Negative Relationships and. Negative Asymmetry in Social Networks in Organizations, 2006). Muslim culture has been historically based on global networks (Miriam Cooke and Bruce Lawrence, Muslim Networks from Haj to Hip Hop, 2005). And John McNeill and William McNeill (The Human Web: A Bird's Eye View of Human History, 2003) have demonstrated the critical role of networks in social organization throughout history.  

This observation ofthe actual historical record runs counter to the predominant vision of the evolution of society that has focused on a different type of organization: hierarchical bureaucracies based on the vertical integration of resources and subjects as the expression of the organized power of a social elite, legitimized by mythology and religion. This is to some extent a distorted vision, as historical and social analysis, more often than not, was built on ethnocentrism and ideology rather than on the scholarly investigation of the complexity of a multicultural world. But this relative indifference of our historical representation to the importance of networks in the structure and dynamics of society may also be linked to the actual subordination of these networks to the logic of vertical organizations, whose power was inscribed in the institutions of society and distributed in one-directional flows of command and control. My hypothesis to explain the historical superiority of vertical/hierarchical organizations over horizontal networks is that the non-centred networked form of social organization had material limits to overcome, limits that were fundamentally linked to available technologies. Indeed, networks have their strength in their flexibility, adaptability and capacity to self-reconfigure.Yet,beyond a certain threshold of size,complexity and volume of flows, they become less efficient than vertically organized command-and-control structures, under the conditions of pre-electronic communication technology (Joel Mokyr, Twenty-Five Centuries of Technological Change: An Historical Survey, 1990). Yes, wind-powered vessels could build seacrossing and even trans-oceanic networks of trade and conquest. And horseriding emissaries or fast-running messengers could maintain communication from the centre to the periphery of vast territorial empires. But the time-lag of the feedback loop in the communication process was such that the logic of the system amounted to a one-way flow of the transmission of information and instruction. Under such conditions, networks were an extension of power concentrated at the top of the vertical organizations that shaped the history of humankind: states, religious apparatuses, war lords, armies, bureaucracies and their subordinates in charge of production, trade, and culture.  

Theabilityofnetworks tointroducenewactors andnew contents inthe process of social organization, with relative autonomy vis-a-vis the power centres, increased over time with technological change and, more precisely, with the evolution of communication technologies. This was particularly the case with the possibility of relying on a distributed energy network that characterized the advent of the industrial revolution. Railways and the telegraph constituted the first infrastructure for a quasi-global network of communication with selfreconfiguring capacity. However, the industrial society (both in its capitalist and its statist versions) was predominantly structured around large-scale, vertical production organizations and extremely hierarchical state institutions, in some instances evolving into totalitarian systems.This is to say that early,electrically based communication technologies were not powerful enough to equip networks with autonomy in alltheir nodes,as this autonomy wouldhave required multidirectionality and a continuous flow of interactive information processing. But it also means that the availability of proper technology is a necessary, but not sufficient, condition for the transformation of the social structure. It was only under the conditions of a mature industrial society that autonomous projects of organizational networking could emerge. When they did, they could use the potential of microelectronics-based digital communication technologies.  

Thus, networks became the most efficient organizational forms as a result of three major features of networks which benefited from the new technological environment: flexibility, scalability and survivability. Flexibility is the ability to reconfigure according to changing environments and retain their goals while changing their components, sometimes bypassing blocking points of communication channels to find new connections. Scalability is the ability to expand or shrink in size with little disruption.Survivability is the ability of networks, because they have no single centre and can operate in a wide range of configurations, to withstand attacks to their nodes and codes because the codes of the network are contained in multiple nodes that can reproduce the instructions and find new ways to perform. So, only the material ability to destroy the connecting points can eliminate the network.  

At the core of this technological change that unleashed the power of networks was the transformation of information and communication technologies, based on the microelectronics revolution that took shape in the 1950s and 1960s. It constituted the foundation of a new technological paradigm, consolidated in the 1970s, first in the United States, and rapidly diffused around the world, ushering in what I have characterized as the Information Age. William Mitchell (The Cyborg Self and the Networked City, 2003) has conceptualized the evolving logic of information and communication technology throughout history as a process of expansion and augmentation of the human body and the human mind: a process that, in the early twenty-first century, is characterized by the explosion of portable devices that provide ubiquitous wireless communication and computing capacity. This enables social units (individuals or organizations) to interact anywhere, anytime, while relying on a support infrastructure that manages material resources in a distributed information power grid. With the advent of nanotechnology and the convergence of microelectronics and biological processes and materials, the boundaries between human life and machine life are blurred, so that networks extend their interaction from our inner self to the whole realm of human activity, transcending barriers of time and space. Neither Mitchell nor Iindulgein sciencefictionscenariosas asubstituteforanalysesofthetechnosocial transformation process. But it is essential, precisely for the sake of analysis, to emphasize the role of technology in the process of social transformation, particularly when we considerthe central technologyofour time - communication technology - that relates to the heart of the specificity of the human species: conscious, meaningful communication. It was because of available electronic information and communication technologies that the network society could deploy itself fully, transcending the historical limits of networks as forms of social organization and interaction.

# JodiDean Collective Desire and the Pathology of the Individual//2013  

An interesting strand of contemporary theory designates the specificity of capitalism with the qualifier ^cognitive'! I do not write under this term, although I am influenced by theorists who do, in so far as they also highlight communication. Franco ‘Bifo' Berardi, for example, observes that 'cognitive labour is essentially a labour communication, that is to say communication put to work.2 While communication encompasses a wide array of waged and non-waged activities expropriated for and exploited by contemporary capitalism, the term ‘cognitive capitalism' feels to me like an academic version of the hacker dream of leaving the meat. It gives away too much. The term accepts the neoliberal claim for a knowledge society wherein workers are primarily creative workers or a kind of 'cognitariat'. It's not surprising, then, to find those interested in contemporary knowledge management emphasizing the convergence between capitalist management gurus like Peter Drucker and Marxists Antonio Negri and Paolo Virno.3  

In a way, the term 'cognitive capitalism' makes the world appear smarter than it is, as if intelligence replaced manufacturing when in fact manufacturing was pushed out of some countries and onto others in the search for ever cheaper labour, when factory work was becoming all the more brutal and massified even if less visible.4 Further, the term cognitive capitalism implies that affective labour is something new. This obscures rather than acknowledges the long histories of women's affective labour and the struggles around attempts to enclose it in the home and harness it for capital.5 Finally, ‘cognitive capitalism' overplays immateriality even as it brings materiality, meat, bones and blood back in via the emphasis on brains. And here especially I am reluctant to embrace the term because of the ways its diagnoses, the pathologies it identifies, can be rendered functional for capital: they can tell capital what it needs to fix. Workers too depressed? Try Zoloft! Working so many hours that focus is impossible? Try Adderall! Or, in a more recent configuration, one that is sinister in its playfulness: bored by your screen of spreadsheets and memos? Watch some cute kitty videos - these improve worker efficiency!6  

Rather than viewing contemporary capitalism as cognitive, I view it as communicative.7 As Hardt and Negri write, Communication is the form of capitalist production in which capital has succeeded in submitting society entirely and globally to its regime, suppressing all alternative paths.' Whether of affects, images, anxieties or ideas, communication is the means of capitalist subsumption, the vehicle for its intensification and expansion. My focus here is on one pathology associated with the capture and instrumentalization of our communicative capacities, that it to say, on what happens when our basic sociality serves as a primary means of capitalist expropriation, which it has since capitalism began. This pathology is theindividual form of subjectivity,a form thatemerges historically and is today the site of opposing dynamics, of pressures that simultaneously disperse, concentrate and overburden individuality as personal singularity. [...]  

The commodity is a form for value. The individual is a form for subjectivity, indeed, a form endeavouring to abolish collective subjectivity by separating it into and containing it within individuated bodies and psyches. C.B. MacPherson locates a'possessiveindividual'at the heart oftheliberaltheory of the seventeenth century which conceived the individual ‘as essentially the proprietor of his own person or capacities, owing nothing to society for them'.9 For liberals like Thomas Hobbes and John Locke, MacPherson argues, 'The human essence is freedom from dependence on the wills of others, and freedom is a function of possession'.10 This individual is not understood as part of something larger, as fundamentally interconnected with others, as dependent on relations to others human and nonhuman. Rather, it is a proprietor of capacities engaging other proprietors. This necessarily and unavoidably capitalistic orientation, fundamental not only to liberal understandings of property but also to the market and to contracts, is crucialtoMacPherson'scritiqueofliberalism.Weshouldnoteitsfundamental reflexivity: proprietorship relies on a series of separations and enclosures. Capacities are separate from others as well as separate from the self or ego, which can thus enclose these capacities within its person. Training, whether moral or technical, is then work on and for the self rather than part of collective reproduction for the common good. Enclosed within the individual, capacities become so many objects available for exchange, and, as capitalism evolves and expands, for investment, stylization and self-branding.  

Even as I treat the individual as pathology, I also consider how we are moving beyond the pathology of the individual form. The last couple of years have been tremendously exciting. People have come together in opposition to capital and its demands for cuts, austerity and more and more money for the one per cent. Critical analyses of our setting and diagnoses of the pathologies plaguing it need to be supplemented by attention to the ways people are already overcoming them, moving beyond them, expressing new or formerly repressed capacities. My tag for this beyond is 'collective desire'. [...] The intuition I pursue here is that recognizing the pathological nature of the individual form lets us see possibilities for emerging senses of and desires for collectivity. More precisely, rather than looking at drugs and mental illness as pathologies, we should consider the likelihood that the individual form itself is the pathology; drugs attempt to maintain it, keep it going. The individual, then, is pathological in the sense that the setting in which it functioned is passing away. So the problem is not that the extremes of a contemporary capitalism that has merged with the most fundamental components of communicativity is making us depressed, anxious, autistic and distracted and so we need to find ways to preserve and protect our fragile individualities. Rather, depression, anxiety, autism and hyperactivity signal the breakdown of a form that was always itself a problem, a mobilization of reflexivity, a turning inward, to break connection and weaken collective strength.  

The setting that is passing away is bourgeois capitalism. I use “bourgeois capitalism' to indicate an economic form inclusive of industrial as well as postindustrial, communicative, capitalism; Keynesian as well as neoliberal approaches to the economy; and a vision of the subject as a free, rational, individual as well as the critique of the exclusivity of this vision. In bourgeois capitalism, the individual appears as a form of freedom even as it functions as that enclosure of the common that fragments, disperses and diminishes that collective power capable of guaranteeing freedom. As capitalism has intensified, so have the pressures for and on the individual. The individual is called on to express her opinion, speak for herself, get involved. She is told that she, all by herself, can make a difference - collective action, though, that's off the table, either impossible or too repressive to constitute a real alternative. It is no wonder that communicative capitalism enjoins us to uniqueness, to specialization and specificity: we have to distinguish ourselves to get hired or, for most of us, to maintain the fantasy of something like a fair competition (it would be horrible to think that we went into enormous debt for nothing, that we put all the work into a proposal, design or manuscript that had no chance). At the same time, this specialization supports marketers' interests in ever more granular access to customers, police efforts to locate and track, and capital's concern with preventing people from coalescing in common struggle. Once we acknowledge, however, that the individual form is not threatened but is the threat, not a form to be preserved but one whose dissolution points to emerging collectivity, then we can move beyond the diagnosis of the pathologies of what has already passed and amplify alternative tendencies in the present. [...]

# Lea Porsager Odd, Indexical Ideas on the Multi-Breasted Monstrosity//2012  

TheAnattaExperimentrevolvesaroundMonteVeritainAscona,Switzerland.In the early 1900s, this hill served as a lodestone for spiritual rebellion, attracting anarchists, free-love advocates, Dadaists, theosophists, psychoanalysts and occultists, all rejecting an increasingly materialistic society. Monte Verita, the ProgressiveUndergroundanditsRevoltAgainstCivilization,expressedinadanceof nonviolent action. The diversity of discourses and influences at Monte Verita has resulted in many, often conflicting voices within its historical documents. The only common denominator seemed tobe thefactthat MonteVerita attracted people whose ideas - anarchic and strange - found little nurturing in established society. This search for something different, something other, became the point of departure for the Anatta Experiment's far out' cosmic longing.  

In the late summer of 2011, seven friends were invited to Casa Anatta, Monte Verita's principal building, in its final moments before undergoing major restoration. Casa Anatta became the scene of a week-long 'vertical drop' into tantric laws and processes normally obscured by the noise of productivity, ultimately finding its crux within Harald Szeemann's archive and his puzzling Strukturmutter.In1978,Szeemannusedtheimageofthemulti-breastedGoddess Artemis of Ephesus to structure the cataloguefor his exhibition‘MonteVerita -Le Mammelle della Verita': one breast for Lebensreform, one breast for Dance and Art, one for Sexual Revolution, and so on. The ‘nippled woman' became the gateway to the mountain, anatta and to the lived aspect of the experiment.  

Anatta in Buddhism refers to the notion of 'not self, not I, not mine'. In early Buddhist texts, the Buddha commonly uses the word when teaching that all things perceived by the senses are not really 'I' or 'mine' and should therefore not be clung to.Casa Anatta became Strukturmutter's body.Not Szeemann's Strukturmutter, but a structure with Urmutterissues, enabling the seven anattaists to revolutionize their individual mythologies (to use Szeemann's term）and become electric impulses flickering along Mutter's neural pathways, seven currents with the mobility of the nervous system and the plasticity of the cerebral cortex - fluid and flame-like, elastic and magnetic.  

In its doings, the experiment passed through rays of fire - something in search of something beyond the grasp of judgement and criticism. Anatta, Not-I and Neo-Ego, a weird mixture of fact and fiction, and something about death, too. Spirituality and occultism often call for some sort of passage through one's own death, regarded as a profound inner experience. Death as a vertical concept, the hippie ego-death (the Mountain being a proto-hippie movement, barefooted, naked and open minded). In search of less ego, more cosmos!  

The Asconian notion of the art of the insane - the cult of mad art and extreme expression that allied itself with protest art such as Dada and later Surrealism - is very much present in the experiment's source material, but as it progressed, the theoretical references took a back seat to the experiment itself. Obscured and detached from its sources, the Anatta Experiment became something more autonomous.Aschizophrenic, mumbling echooftheosophicalconcepts,dadaistic speculations and lived experiences. In a space of non-violent madness, the experiment dealt with avant-garde spasms, transformation, anarchy of self, mothers and Mutters, psychotherapeutic processes and different manifestations of fire within seven blazing spheres that all happened to be friends. [...]  

The seven anattaists were not yogis or Monte Verita experts or certified researchers of the occult or members of secret societies or affiliates of spooky men-only lodges. So the leap to anatta was as an unruly and passionate process - a search for something more elemental like eggs, breasts, electric fires, solar logos, the Seven Star Sisters or a Hugo Ball hat - carried out under the banner: 'Love is the Law, Love under Will (Aleister Crowley). Specks of miniature flames, or burning problems, on the face of the earth (an un-sacred planet, according to Alice Bailey's cosmic law), caught between the severe reality of matter and the relentless flux of anatta. The shift from thinking to doing is one big, horrendous leap. But as potential future eggs, one can try.  

According to Theodor Reuss, Aleister Crowley's soul and/or fire was with them on the mountain in the shape of The Book of Law which Reuss had translated into German. In a correspondence with Crowley, Reuss wrote: Let this news encourage you! We live in your Work!!!'. The experiment's alternative title AnationalCongressoftheMulti-BreastedMonstrosityreferstoReuss'sO.T.O. initiative ‘Anational Congress for Organizing the Reconstruction of Society on Practical Cooperative Lines' which took place on Monte Verita in 1917. Even though the Anatta Experiment did not involve any direct reference to occult O.T.O. rituals or toAleisterCrowley/666/TheBeast himself, it would stillbe accurate to say that Crowley's wildness and focus on actualizing ideas - manifesting them as livings and doings - had a certain influence on how the experiment was planned and executed. Crowley re-entered the experiment in the editing-process of the film in a scene where one of the anattaists walk up the stairs into darkness, and suddenly, on her head, a LAM-like shape appears. LAM is a figure drawn by Aleister Crowley in 1917/18, the Egg of the Spirit represented by the Head - a portal to other dimensions (LAM the Little Grey Weirdo whose Numerical Value is 71 had been present during the week in Casa Anatta, everybody agreed!).  

Theosophy, with all its eccentricities, also found its ways into the Anatta Experiment,as Alice Bailey's Cosmic Physical Index became the new representation of Strukturmutter, replacing Harald Szeemann's Artemis-Goddess. The Geometrical Strukturmutter-TheMother Shipfromwhich smaller crafts are launched and maintained (you invoke the Anattaists into the Circle. You evoke Mutterinto the Triangle. Gosh!A Treatise on Cosmic Fire!). Although the Anatta Experiment's floor-index is nearly an exact copy of Bailey's index, small changes have been made. The Egoic Lotus became Mutter's Palmate Cunt-flower, which in turn received the numeric value of 71 petals (improving the experiment's probability of reaching space ugh LAM the Tantric Time-traveller!). What became the Geometrical Strukturmutter's triangular crowns were collapsed and folded while her cunt-flower, eggs, ovoids and iron dada-heads remained erected.  

O Mountainous LEBENSREFORM! O Countercultural revolutionary-ritualpsychosexual-utopian Ambition! O Monte Verita. The Anatta Experiment musters up a tiny fire of mixed material: Transfixed by the egglessness of their own flame, they tried' A burning transversal seven-voiced symphony of small dissolving egos, caving utopian triangles, sagging thought-forms and contorted truth-concepts. Eggs still leaping! [...]

# Barry Miles Notes from Underground//2006  

My first involvement with the underground press came in 1965 when Walter Bowart, founder and publisher of the East Village Other (EVO), asked me to write a London column for them. EVO started that year in New York to fill the gap when the Village Voice was on strike, and to fill the cultural gap between the increasingly staid old-left Greenwich Village, and the edgy, radical East Village. It was able to get away with much of its provocative language and headlines because its Chinatown printers did not speak English. It was the epitome of an underground paper: psychedelic graphics, anti-Vietnam war news, conspiracy theories, articles on drugs, including regular essays by the editor's friend Timothy Leary, articles on happenings, avant-garde events, rock'n'roll, and sex - in fact, it was the original sex'n'drugs'n'rock'n'roll newspaper. EVo was the first to print the work of underground cartoonists Robert Crumb (creator of Mr Natural, Fritz the Cat, and most of all, his own angst-ridden self as a character), Gilbert Shelton (creator of anti-heroes Wonder Warthog and the Furry Freak Brothers, whose collections are still in print), Spain Rodriguez, originator of Trashman, a Hell's Angel antihero. These pages of comics were widely reprinted around the world by the Underground Press Syndicate (UPS) and helped keep many of them in business. The EVO office, which was in a loft above Bill Graham's Fillmore East on 2nd Avenue, had a mural across the back wall, depicting all the main characters created by Robert Crumb, Spain Rodriguez and Gilbert Shelton; the way they pooled their talents on this one project symbolized the ethos of the movement: sharing and community came before individual ego. EVO realized that they could never distribute further than downtown Manhattan so they came up with the idea of the UPS to disseminate their articles and cartoons across the world. A genuine exercise in subversion. It was very simple: UPS members agreed to send their papers to all the other members and to allow them to reprint anything from them with no fee or even acknowledgment. All it took to join was a letter to the UPS saying you existed. EVo became the model for most of the new emerging papers: people liked its irreverence, its underground cartoons, its pro-drug stance, its humour and the way it explored the outer possibilities of what you can do with offset litho before it becomes illegible. They ran collages, handwritten headlines, typewritten copy, printed the thing sideways, superimposed and upside-down. You got the sense of immediacy and the energy of the news as it happened, quickly slapped down on the boards as if it was hot gossip. You got the sense that if they could do it, anybody could. And it was true.  

In 1966 myself, John Hopkins and various others co-founded the International Times (it), Europe's first underground paper, using EVO, the Los Angeles Free Press and the Village Voice as models. There was a large enough community interested in news about anti-Vietnam war activities, happenings and the latest developments in the avant garde, music and theatre, about LsD and marijuana for us to survive. We ran articles by William Burroughs, a good friend of the paper, and Allen Ginsberg. I interviewed members of the Beatles who were sometimes called upon for a cheque when things got tough. Articles from most of our issues were reprinted somewhere in the world. At it we originated our own cartoon strips, not wanting the paper to become too American, but after about three years, the work of Crumb, Shelton, Spain, S. Clay Wilson and the other American underground cartoonistshad become so good that we started to reprint it.  

Working at an underground paper was rather like being a starving artist in a garret; most people did it for love. It was several years before I was paid for anything I wrote for it, and that was only after it became a workers' co-operative after May 1968. It was wonderful to have my work reprinted across the world, to see something as mundane as a record review appear in a paper from Minneapolis or an essay translated into Dutch or Swedish. The UPS papers ran an ongoing weekly debate on how to live: dozens of models were proposed, discussed and attempted. Some worked, some didn't, and some were a big mistake. Charles Manson was, after all, also a product of the counterculture.it was housed in the basement of the Indica Bookshop, which I co-owned, which meant that it was more exposed than most underground papers and had a constant stream of visitors from Holland, Germany and the USA, all looking to score drugs and find a crash pad. But we were trying to run an underground paper, not an underground social services office, so we were not always able to help, though we were usually able to find someone to put up runaways. It worked both ways, of course. My most enduring memory of working in the underground press is the warmth and camaraderie of the people who published and wrote them. I remember arriving in Los Angeles in January 1969 and walking unannounced into the offices of OpenCity and saying I was from it. Immediately I was offered a place to stay and more invitations to events and meals than I could hope to use. Open City was a wonderful psychedelic broadsheet that ran Charles Bukowski's Notes of a Dirty Old Man' column, widely reprinted throughout the UPS. It was published from a storefront and had a huge psychedelic mural across the back wall. I thought there was something wrong with it and they explained that, in classic Hollywood manner, the building had previously been used as a film set for an exploitation movie about an underground paper. Reality was often hard to pin down in underground press circles. I received the same warm welcome when I went to the Los Angeles Free Press, the first of the underground papers. Editor/publisher Art Kunkin took the day off to drive me around town and show me all the countercultural sights. We tried our best to reciprocate but we were sometimes overwhelmed by the sheer numbers of visitors to Swinging London, all of whom wanted to meet the Beatles.  

The spirit of the underground press lives on: in the late seventies there were several hundred punk magazines with wonderful names like Sniffin' Glue and Apathy in Ilford, produced in Britain on office photocopy machines used out of hours. Then came the Internet. The area north of San Jose, where Ken Kesey and the Merry Pranksters once held their acid tests, became Silicon Valley. Many of the same people went on to found the cyber-revolution, and made sure the internet embodied the fundamental principle that ‘information should be free'. The Internet, with its great unsorted jumble of facts, lies and misreporting, is in many ways like the underground press, and the advent of personal blogs means that everyone can now publish their own paper.

# Stephen Willats Inside the Night//1982  

# Informal Networks  

Informal networks between people are usually spontaneous, transient and casual affairs that arise through exchanges among participants that are defined by some need they have for society.  

Almost by definition, informal networks are not designed as part of any 'plan', or predetermined as a consequence of a dictate given by a higher authority, but grow out of the associations and behaviours generated between participants themselves in relation to some priority or need. While most informal networks are entwined with the cultural fabric of normality and are virtually indistinguishable from the symbols of normality when viewed from outside the group concerned, other networks have formed specifically around an alienation from, or even opposition to that normality and want to express that separation to the extent that it becomes highly visible. Although this separation from normality is visibly expressed by participants in the network, the reality is that they are still dependent upon normality. Thus there is usually an ad hoc coexistence between values and beliefs held within a fabric of relationships selfcreated by an informal group, on one hand, and the deterministic, formal fabric of society, on the other. This effectively leads to these networks operating as a parallel 'counterculture', which transforms the language of the dominant society to give it new meanings that are specific to their own special groupings. This process of appropriation and transformation I consider to be fundamentally creative, and also a manifestation of the process of self-organization in the establishing of new culture. The act of transformation from one thing into another and its connection with an ideology of self-organization remains central to my practice, how it might operate in and what it might express about society. The act of self-organization is vital to evolving, adaptive, dynamic society between people. Accompanying the development of society is the stating within a group of agreed perceptual as well as physical transformations of the reality in which self-organization takes place. Here agreement is an active creative action between participants, a layering onto existing realities of new or different values and beliefs, so that perception and behaviour within the network are now changed. In this sense ‘reality' is constructed by the psychology of individuals in association with the groupings or networks of relationships towards which they are drawn or in which they find themselves.  

# Symbolic Worlds  

In contemporary society the generation of informal networks has become an important feature in the fashioning of the cultural landscape. The creation of encapsulated realms of meaning and attendant languages has led to a multiplicity of symbolic worlds existing in a kind of pluralistic jungle. The relevance of this phenomenon to the development of my practice is that such an encapsulated context is also created within the work: what I have termed a Symbolic World. This has the intention of actively engaging the audience in initiating their own acts of perceptual transformation; acts that parallel, through inferred perception, the world in which the viewer actually lives. Thus the work itself presents a Symbolic World that acts as an interface between the encoded representations of reality within it, and the personal cognitive reality brought to the work by the audience. So as to stimulate access and engagement from people coming to it from different positions and backgrounds, the Symbolic World created is not abstract, but is real, drawn and built from an actuality that can be recognised as in some way meaningful by the audience. Consequently the role of the Symbolic World has evolved in the work to involve myself in a relationship of mutual cooperation with another person or group of people in all kinds of settings, inviting them to encode elements of their world in the construction of a Symbolic World that can be accessed by an audience. Thus the Symbolic World, when presented in the work, is a real territory that the viewer can enter into and get involved with. The activity of this involvement is in response to a question posed by the work, concerning some aspect of a problem situation that is seen to exist within the Symbolic World. It is important to the activity of viewers entering the Symbolic World that both its territory of references and the questions, the problem situations represented, parallel their own frame of reference, that they can connect with it, find a meaning that correlates with their own experience: The relevance of this strategy is that the act of responding to a question in order to resolve a problem is an active state. The work can thus directly involve the psychological participation of viewers so that their frame of references can be brought to bear onto the situation represented in the Symbolic World, and become integral to the transformations they are stimulated to make, connecting inferences directly with their own lives. The active nature of the viewers' involvement makes any imaginative connections they might make - for instance in connecting disparate references located within the Symbolic World - more actual; the meaning then becomes heightened for them.  

The work seeks to increase the meaning and relevance of these acts of engagement by viewers with the Symbolic World by representing it as a model of society, showing a small network of relationships linked to a particular context that the viewer can psychologically become part of and feel personally connected to. This desire to engage viewers in an active Symbolic World that is akin to their own experience has led to a constant search for polemical issues that already exist in contemporary society and that are clearly linked to networks,both formal and informal, associated with specific environments or social situations. It is important that these polemical issues will be in some way already familiar to the audience, in so far as although they may not have actually experienced the issue directly themselves, it is nevertheless part of their general referential knowledge of external events, i.e. they may have read about it, seen something on television, had conversations with friends, etc.  

Another reason for the loading of the Symbolic World with actual polemics, actual realities that feature in all of our lives, is to represent within the abstracted inner realm of the art museum a confrontation with real problem situations in the world outside. I want to change the way the institutional realm of art operates within our culture, so that instead of it functioning as a container of abstracted, idealized icons that are separated from the world outside and are venerated and emulated, it is directly linked to the infrastructure of that surrounding world, as a vehicle for its transformation.  

My search for these‘polemical symbols', led me to make reconnaissance explorations into everyday situations that would increase the meaning of a Symbolic World that might be represented in a work and widen its availability to people in all contexts of contemporary society. Rather than academic or abstract situations that would severely limit meaning, I wanted to find situations that were in the wider fabric of people's consciousness and experience; moreover I wanted to use the languages that I found existing there to build the fabric of references held in a Symbolic World. [...]  

# Into the Night  

The night has always been seen as a cover for engaging in 'society', or activities that need to escape from the scrutinizing glare of the day. But in the early eighties, the Post-Punk generation created a 'night culture' in London of islands within islands that had a special significance as an expression of self organization and personal freedom. I felt that this phenomenon held an important message about how to approach the future of culture and consequently sought to embody the reality of its expression in the creation of a Symbolic World in my work. My discovery of this night culture was quite by chance, through my bumping into the painter Kevin Whitney one morning in the Earls Court Road, and him telling me that he was just on his way back from a club called the Cha Cha. Then followed an exciting description of this place and what happened there, and immediately I saw the scene described as fitting into my search for a context that was responsive to the changes in cultural languages and sensibilities that were occurring everywhere in the early 1980s, which seemed to be leading towards an outface that was more direct and confrontational. I saw this as a ‘polemical context', an experience of different realities that could potentially be encoded as a Symbolic World in my work and directly connect to a territory of self expression that was shaping the contemporary world. That meeting with Kevin Whitney opened up a particular door in the form of an introduction to Michael and Scarlet, who were the organizing force behind the Cha Cha Club. The Cha Cha, a small space situated under one of the Charing Cross railway arches and painted jet black inside, was adjacent to the gay night club Heaven. At that moment in 1982 it was the most well known 'private club' in the new world of the night that was opening up in and around London. [...]

# Robert Hobbs Mark Lombardi: Global Networks//2003  

On 16 September 1985, when the Commerce Department announced that the United States had become a debtor nation, the American Empire died. The empire was seventy-one years old and had been in ill health since 1968. Like most modern empires, ours rested not so much on military prowess as on economic primacy ... in 1914, New York [had] replaced London as the world's financial capital ... what had been a debtor nation became a creditor nation.  

- Gore Vidal, Requiem for the American Empire, 1986  

On17October2o01,fiveweeksaftertheterroristattacksontheWorldTrade Center that tragically demonstrated the permeability of the United States' borders, an FBI agent contacted the Whitney Museum of American Art. She wanted to obtain a reproduction of Mark Lombardi's large drawing BCCI-ICIC & FAB, 197-91 (4th Version) (1996-2000), or if that were not possible, to see the actual work at the museum. At about the same time, Lombardi's gallery, Pierogi, also received a telephone inquiry from a ‘lead investigator into the September 11 attacks'' Federal investigators, as part of their preliminary inquiry into the attacks, wanted to obtain information pertaining to wealthy Saudi Arabian terrorist Osama bin Laden  

198//CORRUPTION, INTRIGUE AND COVERT SOLIDARITY and his Al Qaeda network by tracing his many financial connections, including his dealings with his brother-in-law,Khalid bin Mahfouz, a Saudi banker and former BCCI director. Since the drawing was then on display as part of the Whitney's permanent collection show “Pollock to Today, and no reproduction of it was available, museum officials suggested that the agent come look at the work during the hours the museum was open to the public. Carefully studying the spidery web that Lombardi had delineated, she undoubtedly tried to decipher the connections linking international crime figures, arms dealers, money launderers, corrupt officials, intelligence agents, as well as drug smugglers who profited from the services of the infamous Bank of Credit and Commerce International, whose principals stole an estimated $\$12$ billion from their depositors. Time magazine called BCCI 'the largest criminal enterprise in history'?  

If government investigators had merely decided to include select members of the art world in their investigation into the $9/11$ attacks, that fact alone would have been newsworthy. But when an FBI agent consulted a work of art for clues pertaining to terrorist financing, she unwittingly made history.  

# History Painting and Corporate Crime  

History painting in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries was the pinnacle of achievement for academically trained European and American artists well versed in the classics, but its accepted purview was the distant past rather than current events. However, a few particularly adventurous painters, such as Benjamin West, made brief forays in this area. Known in France as grands machines, these frequently enormous pageants, representing a wealth of accumulated learning, safeguarded tradition at the same time that they upheld decorous and enlightened views of commonly accepted heroic events.Even though West prided himselfon the veracity ofthe accoutrements he incorporated into his battle scene and secular pieta, he, like his fellow academicians, aimed to make definitive pictures capable of inspiring awe and respect. Such artists intended to eradicate debate rather than encourage it.  

One might say that, beginning in the 1960s, some conceptual artists picked up where the history painters left off. Wanting art to represent important historical and political acts, German-expatriate artist Hans Haacke assumed the role of investigative reporter in 1971 when he created his Shapolsky et al. Manhattan Real Estate Holdings,a Real-Time System, as of May 1, 1971. The work consists of 142 photographs of New York apartment buildings, two maps of New York's Lower East Side and Harlem (with properties marked), and six charts outlining the business relationships from 1951 to 1971 of this real-estate group of slum landlords who were renowned for their graft and, in general, shady dealings. Two years later, New York artist Gordon Matta-Clark assembled Reality Position - Fake Estates: Block  

3398, Lot 716, 1973, consisting of aphotocollage, certificate and map, all pertaining to one of fifteen micro-parcels of land in Queens that Matta-Clark purchased at auction; unusable, irregularly shaped slivers of land that were considered inappropriate for development. Matta-Clark said, What I basically wanted to do was to designate spaces that wouldn't be seen and certainly not occupied. Buying them was my own take on the strangeness of existing property demarcation lines. Property is so all-pervasive. Everyone's notion of ownership is determined by the use factor'3 While Haacke and Matta-Clark both viewed art as a logical repository for substantiated data, neither one considered his art as an extension of history painting. Instead of focusing on august historic personages or literary models, these two artists hunted down representative examples of current real-estate deals. The works they created were far more concerned with ongoing practices than with unique situations, and their concept of history was more related to studies of popular culture than traditional history, with its emphasis on great individuals who rise above the din of the common crowd.  

Although Mark Lombardi (1951-2000) held the conceptually based art of Haacke and Matta-Clark in high esteem, his mature work - a series of drawings begun in 1994 and continuing until his death,which he called Narrative Structures-isbothmoreconservativeandmoreadvanced thantheirs,sincehe intended to update history painting in terms of theories of globalism and rhizomic schematizations of power. In these works, he replaces the tap-root theory crucial to history painting - that great individuals are the initiators of important events - with a new model based on less centralized, more serendipitous channels of power.  

He presents this new type of power as arising from ongoing and seemingly fortuitous constellations of often high-profile individuals, some of whom are perpetrators of crimes while others are simply contacts who may or may not be guilty of wrongdoing. Lombardi's works reveal this global community as consisting of small enclaves of individuals that circulate either knowingly or unknowinglyaroundsomeof the most corrupt supranationalfinancial transactions of the twentieth century.  

Lombardi accepted many of the basic rules governing history painting, but his own work was diametrically opposed to the closure to which such grand peintres as West aspired. In a self-interview dealing with his long-term interest in history, he wrote:  

Reading history has always been one of my main pursuits. History as navigation, reportage, journalism. I also see this work as an offshoot of a lineage that goes back first to history painting. It has all the sweep and expanse, the drama and monumentality one might ordinarily associate with battle paintings or depictions of other significant historical events. But it goes back much further than that. The first story tellers no doubt augmented their tales with diagrams and pictographs drawn in the sand.4  

Although Lombardi envisioned his drawings as corollaries of the vast screen of history painting, they diverge from the genre in significant ways. In these works, he reduced history painting's figurative element to written names, its interactions to connections that are not entirely clear, its exemplary acts to suspect ones, and its overwhelming reliance on painting to the act of drawing. Forgoing the absoluteness created by painting such illustrious subjects on canvas, his drawings are deliberately more open-ended than these traditional works, although they assume their own form of grandeur. Taking full advantage of the long-accepted theory that drawings represent an artist's initial thoughts about a subject, Lombardi's works pose tentative yet compelling portraits of twentieth-century corruption. Implicit in these drawings is the concept of extension, so that ideas are literally drawn out in space by the artist who recommends them as one of a number of possible ways to configure a given topic.  

He therefore viewed his work as both more contemporary and ancient than this essentially Euro-American genre, since its ultimate source is early storytellers' reliance on drawing to communicate their narratives. His analogy helps us to understand the abbreviated and at times oblique views of history represented by his graphs, which often confounded his critics.5 Instead of enumerating tightly woven conspiracies, he opted for a structuralist paradigm: dramatizing information in terms of sets of imbricated networks so that individual players would be defined by the overall governing structures in which their names appear. Then he made this clear-cut rationality deliberately ambiguous by overlapping these structures, so that networks impinge on each other. Rather than looking for distinct origins, his view of beginnings is consistent with Michel Foucault's theory of genealogy as a series of accidents, oppositions, fragments and dispersals rather than unified beginnings,6 and with Gilles Deleuze and Félix Guattari's concept of rhizomes as models for human interactions. In their book A Thousand Plateaux (the second volume of Capitalism and Schizophrenia), these two authors characterize the way rhizomes develop in terms of relays moving at different velocities and in many directions - similar to the way crabgrass branches out - obviating any traditional notions of boundaries that might isolate these networks as integral systems.7 According to Deleuze and Guattari, rhizomatic flows demonstrate that ‘there is no universal capitalism, there is no capitalism in itself; capitalism is at the crossroads of all kinds of formations; it is neocapitalism by nature.'8 Their view of capitalism proved crucial for Lombardi's Narrative Structures.

# Hakim Bey The Temporary Autonomous Zone//1991  

[. | The [following] factor contributing to the TAZ [Temporary Autonomous Zone] is so vast and ambiguous that it needs a section unto itself.  

We've spoken of the Net, which can be defined as the totality of all information and communication transfer. Some of these transfers are privileged and limited to various elites, which gives the Net a hierarchic aspect. Other transactions are open to all - so the Net has a horizontal or non-hierarchic aspect as well. Military and Intelligence data are restricted, as are banking and currency information and the like. But for the most part the telephone, the postal system,public data banks, etc. are accessible to everyone and anyone. Thus within the Net there has begun to emerge a shadowy sort of counter-Net,whichwe will call theWeb(as if the Net were a fishing-net and theWebwere spider-webs woven through the interstices and broken sections of the Net). Generally we'll use the term Web to refer to the alternate horizontal open structure of info-exchange, the nonhierarchic network, and reserve the term counter-Net to indicate clandestine illegal and rebellious use of the Web, including actual data-piracy and other forms of leeching off the Net itself. Net, Web and counter-Net are all parts of the same whole pattern-complex - they blur into each other at innumerable points. The terms are not meant to define areas but to suggest tendencies.  

(Digression: Before you condemn the Web or counter-Net for its‘parasitism', which can never be a truly revolutionary force, ask yourself what ‘production' consists of in the Age of Simulation. What is the 'productive class'? Perhaps you'll be forced to admit that these terms seem to have lost their meaning. In any case the answers to such questions are so complex that the TAZ tends to ignore them altogether and simply picks up what it can use.'Culture is our Nature' - and we are the thieving magpies, or the hunter/gatherers of the world of CommTech.)  

The present forms of the unofficial Web are, one must suppose, still rather primitive: the marginal zine network, the BBS networks, pirated software, hacking. phone-phreaking, some influence in print and radio, almost none in the other big media - no TV stations, no satellites, no fibre-optics, no cable, etc., etc. However the Net itself presents a pattern of changing/evolving relations between subjects ('users') and objects (\*data'). The nature of these relations has been exhaustively explored, from McLuhan to Virilio. It would take pages and pages to 'prove' what by now ^everyone knows'. Rather than rehash it all, I am interested in asking how these evolving relations suggest modes of implementation for the TAz.  

The TAz has a temporary but actual location in time and a temporary but actual location in space. But clearly it must also have “location' in the Web, and this location is of a different sort, not actual but virtual, not immediate but instantaneous. The Web not only provides logistical support for the TAz, it also helps to bring it into being; crudely speaking one might say that the TAZ 'exists' in information-space as well as in the 'real world. The Web can compact a great deal of time, as data, into an infinitesimal 'space'. We have noted that the TAZ, because it is temporary, must necessarily lack some of the advantages of a freedom which experiences duration and a more-or-less fixed locale. But the Web can provide a kind of substitute for some of this duration and locale - it can inform the TAz, from its inception, with vast amounts of compacted time and space whichhavebeen'subtilized'as data.  

At this moment in the evolution of theWeb, and considering our demands for the “face-to-face' and the sensual, we must consider the Web primarily as a support system,capable of carrying information from one TAz to another, of defending the TAZ, rendering it 'invisible' or giving it teeth, as the situation might demand. But more than that: if the TAZ is a nomad camp, then the Web helps provide the epics, songs, genealogies and legends of the tribe; it provides the secret caravan routes and raiding trails which make up the flowlines of tribal economy; it even contains some of the very roads they will follow, some of the very dreams they will experience as signs and portents.  

The Web does not depend for its existence on any computer technology. Wordof-mouth, mail, the marginal zine network, 'phone trees' and the like already suffice to construct an information webwork. The key is not the brand or level of tech involved, but the openness and horizontality of the structure. Nevertheless, the whole concept of the Net implies the use of computers. In the Sci-Fiimagination the Net is headed for the condition of Cyberspace (as in Tron or Neuromancer) and the pseudo-telepathy of 'virtual reality. As a Cyberpunk fan I can't help but envision 'reality hacking' playing a major role in the creation of TAZs. Like Gibson and Sterling I am assuming that the official Net will never succeed in shutting down the Web or the counter-Net - that data-piracy, unauthorized transmissions and the free flow of information can never be frozen. (In fact, as I understand it, chaos theory predicts that any universal Control-system is impossible.)  

However, leaving aside mere speculation about the future, we must face a very seriousquestionabouttheWebandthetechitinvolves.TheTAZdesiresaboveall to avoid mediation,to experience its existence as immediate.The very essence of the affair is breast-to-breast' as the Sufis say, or face-to-face. But, BUT: the very essence of the Web is mediation. Machines here are our ambassadors - the flesh is irrelevant except as a terminal, with all the sinister connotations of the term.  

The TAZ may perhaps find its own space by wrapping its head around two seemingly contradictory attitudes to Hi-Tech and its apotheosis the Net: (1) what we might call the Fifth Estate/Neo-Palaeolithic, Post-Situ Ultra-Green position, which construes itself as a luddite argument against mediation and against the Net; and (2) the Cyberpunk utopianists, futuro-libertarians, Reality Hackers and their allies who see the Net as a step forward in evolution, and who assume that any possible ill effects of mediation can be overcome - at least, once we've liberated the means of production.  

The TAZ agrees with the hackers because it wants to come into being - in part - through the Net, even through the mediation of the Net. But it also agrees with the greens because it retains intense awareness of itself as body and feels only revulsion forCyberGnosis,the attemptto transcend the body through instantaneity and simulation. The TAZ tends to view the Tech/anti-Tech dichotomy as misleading, like most dichotomies, in which apparent opposites turn out to be falsifications or even hallucinations caused by semantics. This is a way of saying that the TAZ wants to live in this world, not in the idea of another world, some visionary world born of false unification (all green OR all metal) which can only be more pie in the sky by&-by (or as Alice put it, Jam yesterday or jam tomorrow but never jam today').  

The TAZ is 'utopian' in the sense that it envisions an intensification of everyday life, or as the Surrealists might have said, life's penetration by the Marvellous. But it cannotbeutopian intheactual meaning oftheword,nowhere,or NoPlace Place. The TAz is somewhere. It lies at the intersection of many forces, like some pagan power-spot at the junction of mysterious ley-lines, visible to the adept in seemingly unrelated bits of terrain, landscape, flows of air, water, animals. But now the lines are not all etched in time and space. Some of them exist only 'within' the Web, even though they also intersect with real times and places. Perhaps some of the lines are 'non-originary' in the sense that no convention for quantifyingthemexists.Theselinesmightbetterbestudiedinthelightofchaos science than of sociology, statistics, economics, etc. The patterns of force which bring the TAZ into being have something in common with those chaotic ‘Strange Attractors' which exist, so to speak, between the dimensions.  

The TAz by its very nature seizes every available means to realize itself - it will come to life whether in a cave or an L-5 Space City - but above all it will live, now, or as soon as possible, in however suspect or ramshackle a form, spontaneously, without regard for ideology or even anti-ideology. It will use the computer because the computer exists, but it will also use powers which are so completely unrelated to alienation or simulation that they guarantee a certain psychic palaeolithism to the TAz, a primordial-shamanic spirit which will ‘infect' even the Net itself (the true meaning of Cyberpunk as I read it). Because the TAz is an intensification, a surplus, an excess, a potlatch, life spending itself in living rather than merely surviving (that snivelling shibboleth of the eighties), it cannot be defined either by Tech or anti-Tech. It contradicts itself like a true despiser of hobgoblins, because it wills itself to be, at any cost in damage to 'perfection', to the immobility of the final.  

In the Mandelbrot Set and its computer-graphic realization we watch - in a fractal universe - maps which are embedded and in fact hidden within maps within maps etc. to the limits of computational power. What is it for, this map which in a sense bears a 1:1 relation with a fractal dimension? What can one do with it, other than admire its psychedelic elegance?  

If we were to imagine an information map - a cartographic projection of the Net in its entirety - we would have to include in it the features of chaos, which have already begun to appear, for example, in the operations of complex parallel processing, telecommunications, transfers of electronic ‘money', viruses, guerrilla hacking, and so on.  

Each of these'areas' of chaos could be represented by topographs similar to the Mandelbrot Set, such that the ‘peninsulas' are embedded or hidden within the map - such that they seem to 'disappear'. This ‘writing' - parts of which vanish, parts of which efface themselves - represents the very process by which the Net is already compromised, incomplete to its own view, ultimately un-Controllable. In other words, the M Set, or something like it, might prove to be useful in 'plotting' (in all senses of the word) the emergence of the counterNet as a chaotic process, a 'creative evolution' in Prigogine's term. If nothing else the M Set serves as a metaphor for a 'mapping' of the TAZ's interface with the Net as a disappearance of information. Every 'catastrophe' in the Net is a node of power for the Web, the counter-Net. The Net will be damaged by chaos, while the Web may thrive on it. Whether through simple data-piracy, or else by a more complex development of actual rapport with chaos, the Web- hacker, the cybernetician of the TAz, will find ways to take advantage of perturbations, crashes and breakdowns in the Net ( ways to make information out of 'entropy'). As a bricoleur, a scavenger of information shards, smuggler, blackmailer, perhaps even cyberterrorist, the TAz-hacker will work for the evolution of clandestine fractal connections.These connections, and the different information that flows among and between them, will form 'power outlets' for the coming-into-being of the TAZ itself - as if one were to steal electricity from the energy-monopoly to light an abandoned house for squatters.  

Thus the Web, in order to produce situations conducive to the TAZ, will parasitize the Net - but we can also conceive of this strategy as an attempt to build towards the construction of an alternative and autonomous Net, free' and no longer parasitic, which will serve as the basis for a 'new society emerging from the shell of the old'. The counter-Net and the TAZ can be considered, practically speaking, as ends in themselves - but theoretically they can also be viewed as forms of struggle towards a different reality.  

Having said this, we must still admit to some qualms about computers, some still unanswered questions, especially about the Personal Computer.  

The story of computer networks, BBSs [Bulletin Board Systems] and various other experiments in electrodemocracy has so far been one of hobbyism for the most part. Many anarchists and libertarians have deep faith in the PC as a weapon of liberation and self-liberation - but no real gains to show, no palpable liberty.  

I have little interest in some hypothetical emergent entrepreneurial class of self-employed data/word processors who will soon be able to carry on a vast cottage industry or piecemeal shitwork forvarious corporations and bureaucracies. Moreover it takes no ESP to foresee that this 'class' will develop its underclass - a sort of lumpen yuppetariat: housewives, for example, who will provide their families with 'second incomes' by turning their own homes into electrosweatshops, littleWork-tyrannies where the‘boss'is a computer network.  

Also I am not impressed by the sort of information and services proffered by contemporary ‘radical' networks. Somewhere - one is told - there exists an 'information economy'. Maybe so; but the info being traded over the 'alternative' BBSs seems to consist entirely of chitchat and techie-talk. Is this an economy? or merely a pastime forenthusiasts?OK, PCs have created yet another 'print revolution' - OK, marginal webworks are evolving - OK, I can now carry on six phone conversations at once. But what difference has this made in my ordinary life?  

Frankly, I already had plenty of data to enrich my perceptions, what with books, movies, TV, theatre, telephones, the US Postal Service, altered states of consciousness, and so on. Do I really need a PC in order to obtain yet more such data? You offer me secret information? Well .. perhaps I'm tempted - but still I demand marvellous secrets, not just unlisted telephone numbers or the trivia of cops and politicians. Most of allI want computers to provide me with information linked to real goods - 'the good things in life', as the IWW [Industrial Workers of the World] Preamble puts it. And here, since I'm accusing the hackers and BBSers of irritating intellectual vagueness, I must myself descend from the baroque clouds of Theory & Critique and explain what I mean by 'real goods'.  

Let's say that for both political and personal reasons I desire good food, better than I can obtain from Capitalism - unpolluted food still blessed with strong and natural flavours. To complicate the game imagine that the food I crave is illegal - raw milk perhaps, or the exquisite Cuban fruit mamey, which cannot be imported fresh into the US because its seed is hallucinogenic (or so I'm told). I am not a farmer. Let's pretend I'm an importer of rare perfumes and aphrodisiacs, and sharpen the play by assuming most of my stock is also illegal. Or maybe I only want to trade word processing services for organic turnips, but refuse to report the transaction to the IRS [Internal Revenue Service] (as required by law, believe it or not). Or maybe I want to meet other humans for consensual but illegal acts of mutual pleasure (this has actually been tried, but all the hard-sex BBSs have been busted - and what use is an underground with lousy security?). In short, assume that I'm fed up with mere information, the ghost in the machine. According to you, computers should already be quite capable of facilitating my desires for food, drugs, sex, tax evasion. So what's the matter? Why isn't it happening?  

The TAZ has occurred, is occurring, and will occur with or without the computer.Butfor the TAZ to reach itsfull potential it must becomeless a matter of spontaneous combustion and more a matter of 'islands in the Net'. The Net, or rather the counter-Net, assumes the promise of an integral aspect of the TAz, an addition that will multiply its potential, a ‘quantum jump' (odd how this expressionhascometomeanabigleap)incomplexityandsignificance.TheTAZ must now exist within a world of pure space, the world of the senses. Liminal, even evanescent, the TAZ must combine information and desire in order to fulfil its adventure (its happening'), in order to fill itself to the borders of its destiny, to saturate itself with its own becoming.  

Perhaps the Neo-Palaeolithic School are correct when they assert that all forms of alienation and mediation must be destroyed or abandoned before our goals can be realized - or perhaps true anarchy will be realized only in Outer Space, as some futuro-libertarians assert. But the TAz does not concern itself very much with‘was' or ‘will be'. The TAZ is interested in results, successful raids on consensus reality, breakthroughs into more intense and more abundant life. If the computer cannot be used in this project, then the computer will have to be overcome. My intuition however suggests that the counter-Net is already coming into being, perhaps already exists but I cannot prove it. I've based the theory of the TAz in large part on this intuition. Of course the Web also involves noncomputerized networks of exchange such as samizdat, the black market, etc. - but the full potential of non-hierarchic information networking logically leads to the computer as the tool par excellence. Now I'm waiting for the hackers to prove I'm right, that my intuition is valid. Where are my turnips?

# Critical Art Ensemble Utopia//2012  

Forget utopian social systems for a moment - is a utopian statement even possible? ‘Stop rape!' Surely everyone can agree on this, but how do we stop it? Increased prison time? Expansion of the prison system? Compulsory self-defence courses? Burqas? Redistribution of wealth? Increased surveillance? Armed escorts? Selected castration? Accessible mental health care? To our dismay, utopia assumes a universal sameness in which all people want the same things from life and society. In the current global order, the division of labour is far too complex for a universal paradise. If Thomas More's Utopia is really a derivative of no-place-land, he saw the problem many years ago.  

Happily, Hakim Bey freed us from theidea that utopia had to be either heaven on earth or an ecstatic end of history. With his notion of the temporary autonomous zone (TAZ), we were able to value utopian tendencies as a prescription for microrevolutions and new arrangements of autonomous activity that could exist even in the most totalitarian environments. If the TAZ was discovered and destroyed or assimilated, that was simply part of an ongoing historical process in which capitalism abhors all alternatives to itself. No matter how long a TAZ may last (one minute or one century), the end of a TAZ is no time for mourning; rather, it is time to begin a new one. Utopians were freed from the burden of providing a permanent systemic solution for utopia, or creating new grist for the capitalist mill, and were invited to experiment in any way possible to create production and pleasure within consensus-based social nodes.  

CAE is interested in attempting such experiments, but not as a public practice. TAz can never be public for the reasons explained above, and if we were ever to create a long-term TAz,why would we bother with interventions? Why not just stay in the pleasure palace as a final statement of resistance? Clearly, the long-term TAz has eluded us. Given that we must continue with the best model of resistance we know - intervention - we can't resist packaging utopian hopes in ways that allow us to further other autonomous arrangements. A utopian grouping of people (so long as they don't appear hostile) acts as a magnetic curiosity to onlookers. Between the conjunction of the freakish difference utopians represent, and the wonderment of onlookers as they consider how the utopians find meaning in their activities, we produce a seduction machine capable of generating new arrangements of flow and conjunction. Whether as parody or as genuine desire, utopia is ultimately connected to delusion, but at times it is a magnificent delusion.

# StevenShaviro Connected, or What It Means to Live in the Network Society//2003  

# Space is the Place  

The space of flows is virtual space, or cyberspace, or what Fredric Jameson, in his discussion of the bewildering architecture of the Westin Bonaventure Hotel in Los Angeles, calls'hyperspace' ['Postmodernism', 1991]. This space can be exhilarating, disorienting, or oppressive, but in any case it is quite different from the space of places. The space of flows has been freed from the constraints of duration: in consequence, distance is abolished, and communication between any two points is instantaneous. Proximity is no longer determined by geographical location and by face-to-face meetings, but rather by global flows of money and information. The predominant form of human interaction in this space is networking. I mean this, first of all, in the narrow sense of institutional and professional connections among members of any elite or self-defined group. Samuel R. Delany lists some of the locations in which networking traditionally takes place: gyms, parties, twelvestep programmes, conferences, reading groups, singing groups, social gatherings, workshops, tourist groups and classes' [Times Square Red, Times Square Blue, 1999]. The development of electronic communications technology frees this sort of networking from its dependency upon specific locales and specific times; now networking can flourish on a global scale. In a broader sense, then, networkingjust means being connected: having an Internet account, or for that matter, a car. For it isn't just online that we encounter the space of flows; we also find it in the familiar American landscape of shopping centres and strip malls, islands of quasi-public (though actually privatized) space in a sea of asphalt, each with its own Starbucks. The logic of the space of flows also organizes the emerging 'mega-cities' of the twenty-first century: places like Guangzhou, Sao Paulo and Mexico City, where the economy of the First World overlays that of the Third. These places, Manuel Castells says, are 'globally connected and locally disconnected, physically and socially .. Mega-cities are discontinuous constellations of spatial fragments, functional pieces, and social segments' [The Rise of the Network Society, 1996/2000]. This is the situation in which, for instance, gated communities wall out the shanty towns that exist right next door. In contrast to all this stratification, the space of places is what we still think of as homogeneous, continuous physical space. Here, people are brought together by direct physical contiguity, by solidarities (and oppositions) of class, race, ethnicity and sexual orientation, and by common experiences in their workplaces and neighbourhoods. The space of places is often looked back upon nostalgically as a site of 'community, where everyone helped their neighbours, and nobody was reduced to the fate of bowling alone'. This is rather a dubious idealization: old-time, small-town communities were just as often characterized by bitterenmities, malicious gosip and the heavy-handed imposition of censorious, bigoted 'community standards'. What's crucial about the space of places is rather something other than 'community: the fact that, in large urban agglomerations, networking is less important than what Delany, elaborating on an idea from Jane Jacobs, calls contact: the serendipitous encounters between strangers - often across class, race, and gender lines - that can change everything [Times Square Red, Times Square Blue]. These sorts of encounters happen most easily in the pedestrianfriendly spaces of older large cities. Delany's main example is New York City's Times Square, before it was 'renovated' and gentrified. The space of places is less that of nostalgically idealized traditional communities than that of turbulent urban modernity. It is the space of the urban flaneur, memorably evoked by Walter Benjamin. And one of the big questions today, facing artists, thinkers and activists alike, is how to find a twenty-first-century equivalent, within the space of flows, for Beniaminian flaneurie and Delanvesque contact.

# What It Means to Live in the Network Society  

So this is what it means to live in the network society. We have moved out of time and into space. Anything you want is yours for the asking. You can get it right here and right now. All you have to do is pay the price. First of all, you must pay the monetary price, since money is the universal equivalent for all commodities. But you also have to pay the informational price, since information is also a universal equivalent. Information is the common measure and the medium of exchange for all knowledge, all perception, all passion, and all desire. The universal equivalent for experience, in short. In the network society, experience will be digital or not at all. But this also means that what you get is never quite what you paid for. It's always just a tiny bit less. The mystery of the extraction of surplus value, unveiled by Marx in the context of nineteenth-century capitalism, applies to the information economy as well. The one real innovation of the network society is this: now surplus extraction is at the centre of consumption as well as production. When you buy something from Microsoft, or DynaZauber, all the formal conditions of equal exchange are met. And yet there is always something extra, something left over, something that is missing from your side of the equation. A surplus has leaked out of the exchange process. What's missing is what is more than information: the qualitative dimension of experience or the continuum of analogue space in between all those ones and zeroes. From a certain point of view, of course, this surplus is nothing at all. It is empty and insubstantial, almost by definition. For if it did exist, it could easily be coded, quantified, and informatized, to any desired degree of accuracy. It is not that there is some hidden essence, basic to human existence, that somehow cannot be rendered by information machines. It is rather that information can all too well account for everything; there is literally nothing that it cannot capture and code. But this nothing is precisely the point. Because of this nothing, too much is never enough, and our desires are never satisfied. This nothing insinuates itself into our dreams. It is what always keeps us coming back for more. And that is 'the dirty little secret that corporations know'. [...]  

# PaoloVirno A Grammar of the Multitude//2003  

# Publicness without a Public Sphere  

We have said that the multitude is defined by the feeling of not-feeling-at-home, just as it was defined by the consequent familiarity with 'common places', with the abstract intellect. We need to add, now, that the dialectic dread-safe haven is rooted precisely in this familiarity with the abstract intellect. The public and shared character of the life of the mind' is coloured with ambivalence: it is also, in and of itself, the host to negative possibilities, to formidable figures. The public intellect is the unifying base from which there can spring forth either forms of ghastly protection or forms of protection capable of achieving a real sense of comfort (according to the degree in which, as we have said, they safeguard us from the former forms of protection). The public intellect which the multitude draws upon is the point of departure for opposing developments. When the fundamental abilities of the human being (thought, language, self-reflection, the capacity for learning) come to the forefront, the situation can take on a disquieting and oppressive appearance; or it can even give way to a non-public public sphere, to a non-governmental public sphere, far from the myths and rituals of sovereignty.  

My thesis, in extremely concise form, is this: if the publicness of the intellect does not yield to the realm of a public sphere, of a political space in which the many can tend to common affairs, then it produces terrifying effects. A publicness without a public sphere: here is the negative side - the evil, if you wish - of the experience of the multitude. Freud in the essay ‘The Uncanny' (1919) shows how the extrinsic power of thought can take on anguishing features. He says that people who are ill, for whom thoughts have an exterior, practical and immediately operative power, fear becoming conditioned and overwhelmed by others. It is the same situation, moreover, which is brought about in a spiritualist seance, in which the participants are bound together in a fused relationship which seems to nullify every trace of individual identity. So then, the belief in the ‘omnipotence of thought' studied by Freud and the extreme situation of the spiritualist seance exemplify clearly what publicness without a public sphere can become; what general intellect can become when it is not articulated within a political space.  

The general intellect, or public intellect, if it does not become a republic, a public sphere, a political community, drastically increases forms of submission. To make the point clear, let us think about contemporary production. The sharing of linguistic and cognitive habits is the constituent element of the post-Fordist process of labour. All the workers enter into production in as much as they are speaking-thinking. This has nothing to do, mind you, with 'professionality' or with the ancient concept of'skill' or'craftsmanship': to speak/to think are generic habits of the human animal, the opposite of any sort of specialization. This preliminary sharing in one way characterizes the 'many', seen as being 'many', the multitude; in another way, it is itself the base of today's production. Sharing, in so far as it is a technical requirement, is opposed to the division of labour - it contradicts that division and causes it to crumble. Of course this does not mean that work loads are no longer subdivided, parcelled out, etc.; rather,it means that the segmentation of duties no longer answers to objective 'technical' criteria, but is, instead, explicitly arbitrary,reversible,changeable.Asfar as capitalis concerned,what really counts is the original sharing of linguistic-cognitive talents, since it is this sharing which guarantees readiness, adaptability, etc., in reacting to innovation. So, it is evident that this sharing of generic cognitive and linguistic talents within the process of real production does not become a public sphere, does not become a political community or a constitutional principle. So then, what happens?  

The publicness of the intellect, that is to say the sharing of the intellect, in onesensecauses everyrigid division oflabour tofall flat on itsback;in another sense,however,it fosters personal dependence.General intellect,the end of the division of labour, personal dependency: the three facets are interrelated. The publicness of the intellect, when it does not take place in a public sphere, translatesinto an unchecked proliferation of hierarchies as groundless as they are thriving. The dependency is personal in two senses of the word: in the world of labour one depends on this person or on that person, not on rules endowed with anonymouscoercivepower;moreover,itis thewholepersonwhoissubdued, the person's basic communicative and cognitive habits.  

# Which One for the Many?  

The point of departure for our analysis was the opposition between the terms 'people' and 'multitude'. From what we have discussed up to this point, it remains clear that the multitude does not rid itself of the One,of the universal,of the common/shared; rather, it redefines the One. The One of the multitude no longer has anything to do with the One constituted by the State, with the One towards which the people converge.  

The people are the result of a centripetal movement: from atomized individuals to the unity of the body politic,' to sovereignty. The extreme outcome of this centripetal movement is the One. The multitude, on the other hand, is the outcome of a centrifugal movement: from the One to the Many. But which One is it that serves as the starting point from which the many differentiate themselves and remain so? Certainly it can not be the State; it must have to do with some completely different form of unity/universality. We can now consider once again a point to which we referred at the beginning of our analysis.  

The unity which the multitude has behind itself is constituted by the 'common places' of the mind, by the linguistic-cognitive faculties common to the species, by the general intellect. It has to do with a unity/universality which is visibly unlike that of the state. Let us be clear: the cognitive-linguistic habits of the species do not come to the forefront because someone decides to make them come to the forefront; they do so out of necessity, or because they constitute a form of protection in a society devoid of substantial communities (or of 'special places').  

The One of the multitude, then, is not the One of the people. The multitude does not converge into a volanté generale for one simple reason: because it already has access to a general intellect. The public intellect, however, which appears in the post-Ford world as a mere resource of production, can constitute a different 'constitutional principle'; it can overshadow a non-state public sphere. The many, in as much as they are many, use the publicness of the intellect as their base or pedestal: for better or for worse. [...]

# Reza Negarestani Hyperstitional Entities of Oil//2008  

[... I Narrative avatars of oil provide petroleum with the opportunity to take part in different terrestrial panoramas. A taxonomic diagram of petroleum avatars in different narrations gives a lucid grasp of oil as a component of contemporary war machines and the War on Terror. The major hyperstitional entities of the Ancient Enemy, or Oil, as traced by the ancient middle-eastern cult of the Blob or the People of Naft (oil) frequently referred to as Naphtanese (a cult reconvened after the execution or disappearance of the sorcerer Akht) are as follows:  

Oil as a lubricant or Tellurian Lube, upon which everything moves forward, spreading smoothly and inevitably. Events are configured by the superconductivity of oil and global petrodynamic currents to such an extent that the progression and emergence of events may be influenced more by petroleum than by time. If narrative development, the unfolding of events in a narration, implies the progression of chronological time, for contemporary planetary formations, history and its progression is determined by the influx and outflow of petroleum. The Hunter of the Dead Seas. Ghoul-e Naft or the Oil-fiend in old Arabic  

and Farsi fictions and folklore stalks over the deserted plains of Arabia.   
Terror of the oil-fiend is a cultural product of certain societies' folklore.  

The Nether Blob. An anorganically synthesized material seething up from the primal interstellar bacterial colonies existing in the bowels of the Earth (Thomas Gold's theory of the Deep Hot Biosphere). According to Gold, since oil is anorganically produced by existing bacteria inside the earth, oil reservoirs are to some extent renewable, perhaps even inexhaustible. And since the colonies of these oil-producing bacteria are moving, oil distribution is not permanent and will shift. Rejuvenation, inexhaustibility and change in the current patterns of petropolitical distribution have immense impacts on our planetary understanding of politics, economics and militarization. The continuation of oil wars or their final end imply huge revelations and their corresponding consequences on every level of planetary life. Through the myth of fossil fuels, according to which hydrocarbons constitute the origin of petroleum, the classic pacifist slogan ‘No Blood for Oil' can be connected to the petropolitics of porphyrin. According to Thomas Gold, the fact of the existence of porphyrin in both blood and oil has been manipulated to bolster the validity of fossil fuels theory. For advocates of the myth of fossil fuels, porphyrin is evidence of a common lineage, the hydrocarbon. And the equation of blood and oil - the assumption that blood is the price of oil - can only be grounded on the impoverishing theory of finite fossil fuels or the production of oil from organic matter. Oil pacifists support the totalitarian poverty of oil through the myth of porphyrin (fossil traditionalism) they accept.  

The BlackCorpse ofthe Sun. Hamid Parsani's lateroccultural,archaeological and theoretical notes elaborately follow the abstract diagram of petroleum as a broken star, a broken decagon with triangles arranged on its sides. Parsani insists that oil or the Tellurian pest worshipped by Akht (in the Avestan language of ancient Persia, the name means pest, or saturated by poison) and his cult, can be grasped numerically on the economic plane. Fragments from the shape of the pest can be discerned and extracted from stock markets, trade meshworks and economic anomalies. ‘The petropolitical traffic of the black corpse of the sun in the planetary sphere is creatively far more dangerous than the self-indulgent consuming hegemony of the Sun', Parsani speculates in his 1989 essay, 'The Rise and Fall of the Solar Empire'.  

An autonomous chemical weapon belonging to earth as both a sentient entity and an event. Petroleum poisons Capital with absolute madness, a planetary plague bleeding into economies mobilized by the technological singularities of advanced civilizations. In the wake of oil as an autonomous terrestrial conspirator, capitalism is not a human symptom but rather a planetary inevitability. In other words, Capitalism was here even before human existence, waiting for a host.  

Hydrocarbon Corpse Juice: a post-apocalyptic entity composed of organic corpses flattened, piled up and liquidated in sedimentary basins (mega-graveyards); geologists suggest that if a high sedimentation rate preserves organic material, a catastrophic sedimentation rate (The Flood) would uproot, kill and bury organic material so rapidly as to cut the porphyrin off from oxidizing agents which would destroy them in the ocean water. Oil as the post-mortem production of organisms is bound to death. Since its ethos - both origin and end - is purely teleological, whatever it inspires is founded on death and the logic of death and eventual conclusion. Oil as hydrocarbon corpse juice is itself a mortal entity which has been the source of ideology for petro-masonic orders and their policies -from OPEC to the agencies of War on Terror to pomo-leftists. It is a deity connected to what Thomas Gold calls ‘the myth of fossil fuels' or exhaustible oil fields. It is extracted through teleological instrumentalization of the socio-political body of the Earth. (OPEC is suspected of being associated with other entities of the Blob as well). Pathological symptoms effectuated by the myth of fossil fuels can be summarized as:  

The policy of underdevelopment and deliberate impoverishment bound to the exhaustibility of oil fields: since oil is dying we must use it wisely and calculatedly (the fallacy of prudent poverty).  

Inhibition of Excess and inherent suppression (connected to moralization of the earth aka the Green Judgement).  

The socio-political programming of planetary systems based on the depletion of petroleum. Everything oily has been manufactured with - and towards - death.  

Fuelling economic systems on monotheistic platforms through melding with their belief-dynamics and apocalyptic politics: the exhaustion of the Earth's aqua vitae is a prerequisite for the Rise of the Kingdom. God can only appear (reveal itself) when all possibilities of the Earth are depleted. The Myth of Fossil Fuels is connected to the institutionalization of religious expectation and anticipation through the oil industry: with every thing we produce with oil, we get a little closer to God. The enigma of oil consumption or the exhaustion of the earth's energy is consummated by a substitute energy source, the Divine's absolute power. Oil depletion scenarios can be connected to a chronological time for which anticipation is not only a premature conclusion but also a participation in attaining what is anticipated, either through the activity of hope or the passivity of despair.  

Devil's Excrement (I call petroleum the devil's excrement' - Juan Pablo Pérez Alfonso). Oil, a sado-conspiracist which (under)develops societies and economic systems through petropolitics to tear them apart slowly. Gaia's aromatic juice.  

The Pipeline-Crawler (Go-juice), a code name for an autonomous vehicle which smuggles Islamic war machines into Western Civilizations - but on the other side of the panorama, it is in fact the slow penetration of other narrative entities of petroleum into the rectal depths of all political orientations, whether formulated on religious platforms or not. Gas plays its role as an assistant culprit in making great distances accessible by applying pressure, pushing the flow to the furthest recesses of the globe. Petroleum is at the same time the desensitizer, the lubricant and the object of intrusion.  

Infernotron, or simply the US pyrodemonism with tentacles spreading through both thematic theism - the cleansing tide of the cathartic fire (the Graeco-Latin theme chained to Aryanistic purity) - and the messengineering process of incomplete burning associated with Zippo Jobs in the Vietnam War and the NAPALM-obsession of the US war machine: ‘I'll go to Hell with a can of gasoline in my hand' (Colonel West).  

XI The Holy Water (or sometimes, The Holy Gold): oil is not for production purposes; it is only used for Islamic purposes (esp. for export):  

Do not make oil an object of export. Export all commodities through oil. Selling them oil without its Jihad-ridden by-products is an unforgivable sin. In the wake of contemporary petropolitics the slogan, “We exported Islam with war carves out a new meaning. (Jay, The Codex of Yatu) [..]

# Colectivo Situaciones Promiscuity//2009  

The impasse has a particular consistency: that of a muddy terrain, a bog. Movements that pretend to be straight, progressive and planned, maroon themselves on this shapeless ground. Intentional action remains submitted to all kinds of deviations and detours.  

With this materiality of the impasse as our premise, we must rethink, in its interiority, the political activity that appears to become slowly and delicately interwoven with it, in a way that each knot in its fabric is realized as an experience of intimate proximity. Under the image of a fabric, the practice of contemporary collective construction urges us to assume that today it is this way of going point by point that enables the assembling of territories in the swamp, to construct practical and immediate orientations in it and counteract - even if only momentarily - the invasive exteriority of mediatized existence. Only in this way, by proximity, does it seem possible to conquer immanence.  

This motley ambience, constituted by combinations that are engendered in the muddy terrain, is what we call promiscuity. Here political fabrics, capable of constituting a force in real space for at least a brief moment, always turn out to be provisional. In this context the notion of promiscuity doesn't have moral connotations, but instead intends to express a hybridization of dynamics that coexist without any a priori meaning that may arrange the exchanges and the flows, or lend coherence and stability to the collective practices.  

In the impasse the political categories slide, don't mean much. Calls to order, to nostalgia or cynicism, are not constructive forms to assume promiscuity.  

The promiscuous is the territory of 'ands': everything fits, everything overlaps, nothing appears to exclude one thing or the other. No general criterion manages to organize a clear understanding of the world. In promiscuity a high degree of disorientation imposes itself: opportunistic practices accelerate, the calculation of survivalis the rule and fear organizes the everyday. These are the current conditions in which life at the same time folds up and explores new possibilities.  

A few years ago, at the edge of the city of Buenos Aires, a market established itself that some international organizations have characterized as ‘Latin America's biggest illegal market': La Salada. Here all types of logic are entangled and complex series of actors and negotiations coexist. The articulation is permanent, on its destructive as well as on its creative side. Mainly presented by Bolivian immigrants, one can find everything at the market: from clothes and footwear to food from every corner of  

Bolivia, music and films, electric appliances, etc. Contingents come from neighbouring countries and the interior of the country to shop at this gigantic marketplace that is only open twice a week during the entire night. Recently Alfonso Prat Gay - flamboyant legislator and former employee ofthe bank J.P. Morgan during the crisis in 2001 - defended La Salada with his vocabulary ofa young enlightened neoliberal, saying that those who workin the market should be considered‘entrepreneurs',and if they weren't there they would be potential criminals.For their part,different groups of ‘national traders showed their anger, arguing that it is impossible to competewith the circuit of production and commercialization of La Salada and that the government should defend them as representatives of national industry. The racism inherent in the two positions is obvious. However one must stress the way that neoliberal economistsvalorizethemobilization of resourcesthat themarket involves, and in some way acknowledge the reality of its productive dynamics that hasbecometransnational.  

Let us go back to the consistency of the impasse: promiscuity can't be confused with a chaos 'to be fixed'. Maybe it is more appropriate to talk about heterogeneous and proliferating assemblages in which meaning is never safe from partial reversions. An incessant production of mediatic codes and stereotypes is acting upon this promiscuity, returning - in real time, and separated - the signs that in the heterogeneous magma are rooted in the collective dynamic. Exposed to such mediatic effect the social signs acquire all kinds of mutations.  

As we said, promiscuity can be understood under the grammatical figure of the ‘and'. This is why the art of political interweaving requires a work of great delicacy. It tends to retract just when it is confronted with overly grandiloquent intentionality; conversely, it recovers its efficiency when it has established itself in the reading of the incessant micro-mutations of social relations; these variations can only be perceived and interpreted through the experience of proximity.  

The stereotype is, precisely, the mediatic conjugation of proximity that we consider necessary for the political fabric. When reality functions according to operators of connectivity that simulate or clone this proximity, the ambivalence that governs the promiscuous is immediately translated as new code, abducting its innovative potency and governing its becoming. The 'ands' that communicated heterogeneities give place to other 'ands', which serialize, according to the same mediatic code, differences that are cut and recombined in the terrain of the image and the prefabricated languages.

# Networks in Reverse: From the Interplanetary Internet via the ARPANET to the Last Pre-Internet Moment//2013  

Vinton G. Cerf, US Internet pioneer, Google's Chief Internet Evangelist and creator of the Interplanetary Internet, was pacing around his lab at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) in California. Concerned that the Interplanetary Internet had been incurring large delays and errors in communication due to the increasing distances involved, he scratched at his grey beard as he read the latest bulletin from The Daily Tech on the screen of his console.  

'NASA Plans Hack-proof "Interplanetary Internet" for Use in Mars, Moon Missions.Architectures should be cost effective,extensible and sustainablein a flat and/or decreasing budget environment'  

http://www.dailytech.com/NASA $_{\cdot^{+}}$ Plans+Hackproof+Interplanetary+Internet +for+Use+in+Mars+Moon+Missions/article30102.htm  

Over the following months signal degradation set in across the IPN network and as a result the US Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) held a conference to resolve the issue. The following day they released the news that they were pulling funding from the IPN project.  

Subsequently all space probes and satellites which had served as Net gateways,conveyingdata packetsto and fromEarth and among themselveswere retasked. Vint Cerf's dream of acollaborative,stable backbone of satellites serving asIPN'snucleuswaseradicated.  

With funding freed up from interplanetary communications, DARPA now had more than adequate finance for its DARWARS military simulation game training project. In their own words:  

Continuous online, mission-level training. Cognitive training systems that include elements of human-tutor interactions and the emotional involvement of computer games coupled with the feedback of Combat Training Center learning. Using the example of commercial, persistent, massive multiplayer online games, the program will link these new training approaches with existing Service and Joint training systems into a self-sustaining architecture, allowing continuous ondemand training anywhere, anytime, for everyone.  

DARWARS' primary architecture developer was the military subcontractor Bolt, Beranek and Newman (BBN) Technologies, who had led a wide range of research and development projects including the US military's ‘Boomerang’ mobile shooter detection system; quantum information processing; ‘Natural  

Communication with Avatars Through Speech and Gesture' technology; and the standardization effort for Internet security architecture (IPsec).  

Afterseveralyearsin operation and manyround table discussionsDARWARS was decommissioned by the Us Government. The decision had no tangible effect on the average person in the street. The territorial network for civilians was still the Intercloud, the interconnected global Cloud of Clouds, an extension of the Internet network of networks, one global interconnected database. Housed in multiple data warehouses across the globe the Intercloud facilitated access to all 'available' data, no matter which Cloud corporation you happened to subscribe to for your data storage, network communications and apps.  

Led by a broad coalition of industry practitioners, corporations, associations and other key stakeholders, including the US Department of Defense, eBay, Google, Amazon and assorted telephone companies, security analytics professionals and arms manufacturers, the concept of a Cloud Security Alliance (CSA) was born at the Information Systems Security Association (ISSA) CISO Forum in Las Vegas. The CSA was a non-profit organization formed to promote the use of best practices for providing security assurance within Cloud Computing, and provide education on the uses of Cloud Computing to help secure all other forms of computing.  

When, despite best efforts, secure transmission between individual data warehouses became increasingly problematic, the architectures of the Cloud and the Intercloud were gradually abandoned. For the time being, however, Internet governance bodies remained in place.  

Governance that shaped uses of the Internet had been overseen by several, for the most part, US controlled entities. United Nations World Summits on the Information Society were held where the Us Department of Commerce had made it clear that it intended to retain control of the Internet's root servers indefinitely.  

The Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN) was a US non-profit corporation founded by Jon Postel in California which controlled and managed the Internet's Infrastructure. Vinton Cerf was on board ICANN for thefirstdecade.  

The Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) was the body that oversaw global IP address allocation, autonomous system number allocation, root zone management in the Domain Name System (DNS), media types, and other Internet Protocol-related symbols and numbers. IANA was operated by ICANN. Prior to the establishment of ICANN for this purpose, IANA was administered primarily by Jon Postel at the Information Sciences Institute of the University of Southern California, under a contract USC/ISI had with the United States Department of Defense, until ICANN was created to assume the responsibility under a United States Department of Commerce contract.  

The Internet Society (IsoC) was an international, non-profit organization founded to provide direction in Internet related standards, education and policy. It stated that its mission was 'to assure the open development, evolution and use of the Internet for the benefit of all people throughout the world'. Vint Cerf, Bob Kahn and Lyman Chapin released a document, announcing ISoC, which explained the rationale for establishing the Internet Society. ISOC had offices near Washington, DC, UsA, and in Geneva, Switzerland. It had a membership base comprising more than 80 organizational and more than 28,000 individual members. Members also formed‘chapters' based on either common geographical location or special interests. There were more than 90 chapters around the world.  

ISOC conducted a great range of activities under three main categories, namely standards, public policy, and education. Under the standards category, ISOC supported and promoted the work of the standards settings bodies for which it was the organisational home: the Internet Engineering Task Force ( IETF), the Internet Architecture Board (IAB), the Internet Engineering Steering Group (IESG), and the Internet Research Task Force (IRTF). ISOC also sought to promote understanding and appreciation of the Internet model of open, transparent processes and consensus-based decision making.  

One of the most powerful commercial online players, Google Inc., the American multinational public corporation, was heavily invested in Internet search, cloud computing and advertising technologies. After many years of successful enterprise, a series of failed lawsuits caused Google to descend slowly into liquidation. One by one Google systematically scaled down its operations, closing its acquisitions, internal sectors and online applications formerly known as Google Earth, Google Chrome, Gmail, Google Street View, Google Books, its video-sharing site YouTube, Google files on worldwide Genetic data, and finally its algorithmic personally targeted advertising services for third party websites. All other online corporations and multinationals eventually followed suit. The satellite which had provided Google with high-resolution imagery for Google Earth was returned to Vandenberg Air Force Base on the same day as Google deleted the entire known Web from its database. The company's unofficial slogan, coined by Google engineer Paul Buchheit, Don't be evil' was relegated to history books, chipped mugs and T shirts.  

As a consequence of this cyber cataclysm, all corporate owned social and professional networking sites, e.g. Facebook, Bebo, Twitter, MySpace, Linkedln, Nexopia, Bebo, Hyves, StudiVZ, iWiW, Tuenti, Tagged, XING, Badoo, Skyrock, Orkut and Hi5, Friendster, Mixi, Multiply, Wretch, Cyworld, simultaneously shut down and millions of gigabytes of user data became dead code in abandoned datawarehouses.  

The Googleplex site at Mountain View, California, slowly fell into disrepair, developing the look of an ex World's Fair ground and inevitably becoming a tourist attraction which was soon served by a retro-hippy bus tour company from San Francisco. Nearby the National Science Foundation (NSF), together with DARPA and NASA, were winding up the Digital Library Initiative, refusing a grant application to Stanford University, with the result that two graduate students, Larry Page and Sergey Brin, abandoned developing a search engine using the links between Web pages as a ranking method.  

Due to closure of all web-based economies and loss of a cooperative backdoor entry for Governments and the CIA, the US National Security Agency's PRISM, TIA and other such data surveillance projects were abandoned, the Us Cyber Command program was decommissioned and funds were no longer available for the numerous Internet governance bodies.  

What had become known as Net War or Info War and its associated terrorist and anonymous networks, networked revolution, the activities of civil society activists and hacktivists gradually ceased to function. Likewise, swarming attacks, info leaking, attacks on financial, transport, power and food supply systems, spying on and subversion of industrial systems, awareness raising, evasion of government censors and monitors, collective action organizing and decentralized network structures began to dwindle to a halt in the digital realm.  

Online grassroots networks disappeared one after the other. Nettime, a discussion mailing list for networked cultures, politics and tactics, was abolished by Geert Lovink; The WELL was abandoned by Stewart Brand and LarryBrilliant,and the socalled‘newmedia'festivals and conferences which had sought, encouraged and represented the engagement of artists, writers and theorists in new technologies and the politics of the Net, became redundant. Evangelical Net communities living in disparate and often marginalized parts of the globe, who had come together through listservs and euphoric fantasies for the potential of an Internet based global change for the better, for empowermentandborderfreecommunicationforthepoliticallydisenfranchised and the war torn, became disillusioned.  

Pretty soonVint Cerf closed down theInternet Society,and the Us National Science Foundation closed the Internet to commercial use. Months later the text based virtual space Lambdamoo' finally went offline and The Advanced Research Projects Agency Network (ARPANET), a US Department of Defense funded project which had pioneered the early Internet, resumed its operations.  

At CERN in Geneva Tim Berners Lee disabled communications between all HTTPclients andserversvia theInternet anddismantledtheWorldWideWeb.  

At around the same time Jon Postel, Paul Mockapetris and Craig Partridge redesigned the Domain Name System (DNS), removing all domain names ending in .edu .gov .com .mil .org .net and .int.  

The DCA combined MILNET with ARPANET where at the time there were 68 nodes on ARPANET, and 45 on MILNET, the military network and Vint Cerf replaced Barry Leiner at DARPA managing the Internet.  

Leonard Kleinrock held the key mathematical background to packet switching and an ARPANET network was re-established between Kleinrock's lab at UCLA and Douglas Engelbart's lab at SRI andtheinitial4-node network was reconnected with UC Santa Barbara and the University of Utah.  

Vinton G. Cerf went on to work in Kleinrock's data packet networking group at UCLA that connected the first 2 nodes of ARPANET, then went back to work at IBM beforereturning toStanford.  

Robert Elliot Kahn, who had invented Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) and Internet Protocol (IP) with Vint Cerf and written, Host to IMP Spec. 1822' at BBN which detailed the interface between ARPANET host computers and the Interface Message Processors, returned via MIT to his position at the American Telephone and Telegraph Company, AT&T.  

Lawrence Roberts, the first Information Processing Technologies Office (IPTO) chief scientist, began design of ARPANET, upon becoming Director of IPTO.  

Robert W.Taylor,who had conceived of and directed funding for ARPANET and who with J.c.R. Licklider had written,'The Computer as a Communication Device', the paper which led to the creation of ARPANET, returned from his new role as Director of IPTO at ARPA to work for NASA. Taylor decided to leave ARPA after congress pushed for it to focus its work towards advancing military missions during the Vietnam War, because his mission was for the technology to be available to all.  

Ivan Sutherland took over as head of IPTO at ARPA and was shortly replaced by J.C.R. Licklider. Licklider, known for his work in Artificial Intelligence and cybernetics, dissuaded Sutherland, Taylor and Roberts from developing the Internet.
