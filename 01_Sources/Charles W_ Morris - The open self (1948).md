THE
Open Self  

# Man as
His Own Maker  

IT IS HALFWAY BETWEEN MIDNIGHT AND dawn. The last two lighted windows on the street have just been darkened. The last pair of laughing celebrants has passed by to silence. And I begin a book.  

Morning was to be the time of beginning. But the words started to say themselves, and they would not remain pillowed. So I write in a little room in this city where Whitman and Melville wrote of the colors and the shadows of this America, beginning a book halfway between midnight and dawn.  

New York City. Early autumn. 3 A.M. Musing three remarks. One from a man of wealth with a New York City home and a Long Island estate. He has played the praised and accepted game of power and has won its rewards. But he said a few days ago, "If I were God I would put my thumb down on this city and wipe it out!" And as he spoke he pressed his thumb on the mahogany table top and twisted it around as if annihilating an insect.  

The third remark completes the triangle. At his desk in a  

A smartly dressed girl, fresh from sailing on the Sound, spoke in a more current idiom: "I would like to ride in the plane that would atom-bomb Western culture."  

Fifth Avenue office the head of one of the many Foundations in this region ended the late afternoon with this question: "How can we keep America young?" And the intentness of his voice underlined the fact that his words, though in the form of a question, uttered a deep but anxious hope.  

Too much is not to be made of these three remarks. New Yorkers, like other people, seldom talk this way. A word count on the subway or Times Square or any beach would show that such extreme language is "statistically infrequent." And all persons at times overtalk, magnifying a personal dilemma into the Last Age of Man and the élan of a drink into the onset of an Utterly New World. Those who like semantic cleanliness believe in neither.  

Nevertheless, as symptoms, these three remarks are revealing. They match in a homely way the fear of H. G. Wells, expressed in his last work, Mind at the End of Its Tether, that there is no hope for modern man—an "Implacable Opponent" is stamping him out. They project on a small screen the strange mixture of midnight and dawn which constitutes contemporary men and women. They exaggerate for illustration the unspoken current of dissatisfaction which lies beneath the polite surfaces of many lives today. They disclose the unrecognized wish for annihilation which at times secretly welcomes current possibilities of destruction. They reveal an uneasy confession that modern man somehow must make of himself a new man fit for a new age—lest he in truth prove obsolete.  

It is such thoughts that chose this hour to begin this book. Thoughts about the night forces which work in everyone and in every society. Forces which unceasingly threaten each person and each society with frustration, closure, sterility, destruction. Forces which have made it possible today for one  

person out of ten to be in danger of serious personality derangements sometime in his or her life, and for many more than one person out of ten to be anxious, discontented, stale-mated, uncreative. Forces which have raised concern whether America is losing its vitality, becoming Old America in a new world. Forces which have made serious persons wonder whether Western civilization as a whole is not bent on its own self-destruction.  

It is good at night to recognize these black powers. It is good before dawn to recognize that they alone do not have complete dominion over man. For man is the being that continually remakes himself, the self-maker, the artisan that is himself the material for his own creation. This frontier of life-making is the one frontier at which man always stands: the human frontier, the frontier of man's next making of himself.  

To live is to stand before alternatives. Man now stands before large alternatives. He endures early stages of a new epoch. Never before has he had to act with the problems of the earth as a whole pressing so insistently upon him. Never before has he had such vast powers over man and nature under his control. Never before has he been confronted with so momentous a choice between massed slavery and unplumbed freedom. It is no wonder that he is hesitant, confused, afraid, awkward. It is no wonder that he seeks for ideas and ideals to direct him in his gropings on today's frontier.  

It is with such ideas and ideals that we are concerned. We are at a hazardous stage in our human career. We have uncovered power never dreamed of by the wildest wizard. We now must determine the human ends for which this power is to be used if we are not to destroy ourselves. We are in a bad way. What are we going to do about it?  

# New Selves for Old  

Our crisis is a strange one. We are as children playing with high explosives. And we know this. But since we know it we are unlike children. We are afraid of ourselves, afraid that we will be inadequate, afraid to assume the responsibilities that might give us back the joy of innocence. If an "implacable opponent" is destroying man, that opponent is man himself. We sense acutely the dark powers in ourselves.  

We are equally aware that we have great reserves of inner strength. The feeling that a new age is beginning is as insistent as the realization that an old one ends. We have already called it the atomic age. But we do not yet know how to unlock our human resources. We have not yet devised a psychological bomb more powerful than the atomic bomb. We can release gigantic physical power by atomic fission. How can we produce a fission within the locked forces of ourselves that will release correspondingly great human power?  

This is our problem. We have new engines, new fabrics, new buildings, new headaches. We need new selves. And new relationships between selves. We must bring ourselves up to date. We can subordinate impersonal forces to human ends only if we recover the standpoint of the personal. We must become person-centered in order to construct a person-centered society. Men and women must again become the focus of our attention and our concern. We have made over the material environment, and now we cannot evade remaking our selves. If the bogeyman gets us, it will be our own fault, for the bogeyman is in us. Our crisis is a human crisis.  

To shock ourselves into creativity we must know ourselves. We need to know the sources of our motivations and our frustrations. We need to know the techniques of self  

making, and its pitfalls. Contemporary students of man have much to tell us about ourselves. We shall endeavor to tap this knowledge for our purposes, even to add to it. But our purpose remains personal. Our task is to decide what we want to do with our lives while we still have them. Our hope is to unlock energies in ourselves sufficient to blast apart our stale-mates and our frustrations. "The experience of each new age requires a new confession." We must dare this new confession. "Safer the center of peril," Melville tells us, "than the circumference."  

What is man now to make of man? What are we going to make of ourselves? Such is our theme and our problem.  

But these are dawn words that set work for the day.  

# Stocktaking  

Fortunately the day is sober. A proper day to think about ourselves. It occasions neither the somber moodiness of rain nor the outgoing praisefulness of the sun. It is a sturdy day for honest thought. The night is too large and the dawn too expectant for the hard work that must be done. The most difficult task we face is to be honest about ourselves, honest with ourselves. It is easier for man to praise himself than to condemn himself, and easier for him to condemn himself than to know himself. A sober day makes for honest thought.  

In this mood we at once find ourselves in doubt concerning the night's delivery that man is the maker of himself.  

Man makes many things, to be sure, but does he really make himself? Did we not give the case away when we said that a sober day makes for honest thought? For this suggests that our thoughts are influenced even by the physical environment. And this doubt which our own words awaken is reinforced by doctrines widely current among us, doctrines  

that our physiques determine what we are, or that the society in which we live molds us into the personalities which we are. Environment, physique, society—are not these the clothes which make the man?  

They are indeed mighty agencies. And the doctrines which celebrate their might have almost become the major dogmas of our time. It is not dogma to recognize that the human personality has as its core a biological organism whose growth and fruition takes place only within a society inhabiting a physical environment. It is not dogma to recognize that the human personality carries with it into every future its entire past. The emerging science of man has established these matters beyond legitimate doubt. The recognition of the role of physical environment, physique, and society in the making of man becomes questionable only when their power is made all-inclusive, when they are used to deny that man is unique among all living beings in the degree to which he makes himself and his history.  

It is obvious enough that man has greatly modified his physical environment, controlling temperature and humidity in his homes, planting crops and raising cattle, closing and opening the access of the seas and rivers to chosen spots of land. It is less obvious but no less true that man has worked on his body and will in the future work much more. In his capacity as physician he doctors himself into something at least a little different from what he otherwise would have been; his choice of mates determines to some degree the kinds of bodies future men and women will have; he can, if he wishes, consciously select and breed the persons who are to inhabit the earth. And, finally, it is now recognized by some anthropologists that man himself has built through his own choices the various patterns of channeled activity which are  

the cultures. The cultures of the world are human creations, patterns for living together which persons have constructed, and will continue to construct in unforeseeable ways. Geography, heredity, society set the conditions for human creativity, supply it with the materials upon which it must work, hinder it or enhance it. But to admit that life-making works always within specific conditions cannot be twisted into a denial that man is a major agency in the making of himself.  

At this point sober reflection becomes uneasy at so much talk of man. Instead of discourse about man it suggests that we talk of individual men and women, and justly. For it is individual men and women, each unique, each different, who are making their lives. And the history of man is the history of their many specific and diverse careers. In this history different individuals play different roles of hero, villain, minor character, chorus. The richness of the human play resides in this multiplicity of different players. We are only now beginning to see how different various persons really are. To understand these differences will be one of our central tasks. Here merely the fact of difference is underscored, and its importance. For it allows us to recognize that self-making is a matter of degree. There are persons who flow along through life like a river in a meadow, following effortlessly the contours and the channels marked out by the things and people in the social countryside. There are other persons whose lives resemble a rushing waterfall which breaks barriers and carves into new forms the mountain of social history. It is only a few individuals who affect in a momentous manner the course of mankind. Most persons play a humbler role, adopting the ideas, the inventions, the manners of life which others have constructed. Yet the difference remains one of degree, for even to adopt as one's own something built by others is to  

choose to admit it into one's self; and such admission involves at least some minimum of scrutiny and appraisal, some element, in short, of the self determining what it is to be. Without such acceptance the innovations of those who have more largely made themselves remain only personal achievements. The history of mankind is a history of all men's self-makings, small and great.  

The day's sober thoughts impose a third caution. Is not "making" too strong a word and too strenuous a theme? Does it not suggest that all men and women are or should be athletic mountain-climbers, continually daring strenuous ascents of the self's Himalayas, extroverted and restless doers? If it does, this suggestion should immediately be erased. For a life with such emphasis is inappropriate for many persons, inapropriate and frustrating. The ways of self-making must be many to answer to human differences. We must champion the right to be different. The current stress in our culture on power has, for instance, devastating effects on many individuals; it destroys their confidence in themselves, and drives them in large numbers through the gates of our asylums. To the list of the many kinds of minorities which we must protect, we need to add a new item: the protection of psychological minorities.  

The ways of self-making must be many if human potentialities and human differences are to be respected. There are demands in the self for receptivity and enjoyment, for affection and support, for meditation and truth-seeking, for dependence and for detachment, as well as for power and domination. These demands differ in their strength in individuals, and all are legitimate. Our theme is the technique of self-making, to be sure, but the stress is on its varieties. In the matter of life-making each of us must remain faithful to our needs.  

and our resources. We wish, in the words of Louis MacNiece, a world of persons "equal in difference, interchangeably sovereign."  

With these daytime restrictions and amplifications, the doctrine that man is uniquely the maker of himself loses the grandiose character which the meditations of large night imposed. But not its grandeur. Men live in a physical world mightier than themselves and in societies that channel and transform in various ways their biological urgencies. The artisan must always work where he is and on the materials at hand. These materials are obdurate and set conditions which his work must respect. Not everything can be made with all materials, and what can be made takes skill and time. Creation is nowhere unconditioned. And it does not always reach fruition. The artisan may bungle, may turn in rage against the obdurate stuff on which he works.  

As makers of themselves men too are artisans, and often bunglers; they reach impasses, turn against themselves. Tragedy is real enough and common enough. But even in a tragic life man is one agent in the tragedy, and how to meet tragedies when they occur is still an alternative before which man always stands. There are even alternative modes of dying. To choose to die is still to choose how one will act now. To choose not to be is to choose to be—dead. Men even help make themselves insane, for the forms of insanity are the best achievements that harassed selves were able to attain under difficult circumstances. Men may conceivably destroy mankind by bungling or in efficient rage. An old historian defined history as man's progressive attempt to destroy himself, and he thought man might yet succeed. And so he may. But even that would be something that man did to himself.  

To be human is to work on oneself. In this working there  

is failure and fruition, pain and joy. Rarely do men choose to terminate this process. And as long as they do not make this final choice there is no limit that can be set to human creativity. To say this is not to speak rhetorically but to state a simple fact. The grandeur comes from the fact and not from its statement.  

# Evasion of Responsibility: Irrationalism  

Men make themselves by their thoughts—by their ideas and their ideals. Men choose their future insofar as they think. And in no other way.  

An idea is something signified. An ideal is something that when signified is found so attractive that one is lured to its attainment. Because men could talk about the earth and about round things, they could talk about the earth as round. When this idea of a round earth had appeared, and was believed, the possibility of sailing around the earth could be entertained. And when this possibility acted as a lure to the urgencies for wealth and power and adventure, the idea of circumnavigating the globe had become an ideal.  

The essential moments in the career of man-making are the moments when new ideas and new ideals appear. For these are the moments when the stream of human life takes a fresh direction. The construction of basic ideas marks the turning points of science and philosophy, and the framing of ideals around such ideas marks the creative heights of religion, art, and social organization.  

We talk ourselves into new ideas and ideals. The child walks before it talks. In choosing our future selves we must talk before we walk. But talk is cheap and walking in new directions is a hard responsibility. So we talk ourselves out of the burden which ideals impose. There are three Big Words by  

which modern men and women attempt to evade the responsibility for doing anything drastic about themselves: Irrationalism, Determinism, Sin. We are irrational creatures; we have no freedom; we are sinful—these are the favored masks of our irresponsibility. Half-true talk that needs unmasking, lest it cut the slender nerve of human resolution.  

The half-truth of irrationalism protects us against a distorted and sentimental view of rationality, and it is well that it has been stated so vigorously and so often in the last decades. One half of this half-truth is the affirmation of the existence and the importance of non-rational factors in the make-up of the human self—the menagerie of drives, passions, hates, joys, hopes, insights, and anxieties which we are.  

To be rational is simply to accept ideas and ideals after critical reflection, after a careful consideration of what would follow from the acceptance of a given idea or ideal. A rational person is a reasoning person, one who advances by pushing out before him the antennae of signs, exploring the terrain of self and surrounding world before committing himself on how to act or how henceforth to be. To renounce rationality in the sense of reasoning is to renounce the making of oneself, to reject one's humanness.  

It does not follow that a rational person is or should be always reasoning. For it is the urgency of life in some precarious situation that motivates thinking, controls it, terminates it. To attempt to think endlessly would be to end oneself and thinking. Thought is an agency in the construction of life, and life is lived in an insistent present. Ideas are teased into being in strange and devious ways, by relaxation and receptivity as often as by athletic inference. Once in being they may be elaborated, brought into relation with other ideas, their consequences traced, the evidence for their truth scrutinized.  

tinized. But the pressure of a present urgency always motivates and terminates this process. Even as thinker the self must continually accept or reject the ideas it entertains, favoring one to another, committing itself to belief on the basis of a given amount of evidence. It is the whole self that thinks, and the problems of the self are temporal and not timeless. Decisions must be made or thinking itself becomes vacuous, without eventuation, uneventful.  

Ideals differ from ideas precisely in the fact that we now prefer what is signified. This increment of preference stems from the urgencies of the self as it is at the moment. The act of acceptance of one ideal rather than another may be for a while delayed. The presumed consequences for oneself and for other selves may be considered. The self may stall, hesitate, vacillate. But its urgencies are insistent, and it must extend the hand of acceptance to one possible alternative rather than to others. Reasoning airs preferences, holds before the self alternative possibilities of liking and disliking, and in the process the self transforms itself and its allegiances. Even Aristotle admitted that the good is what is preferred after deliberation. The act of preference remains, and to prefer is more than to reason. To live is to be for some things and against others. Neutrality is a moment in which preferences are being formed. The only persistently neutral self is a dead self.  

The other half of the half-truth of irrationalism is the recognition that there are genuinely anti-rational forces in the self, forces which actively oppose the self's deliberate reconstruction of itself. It is to the interest of the self at certain stages of its development to protect what it has so far attained, and to hide from itself forces which it does not yet feel strong enough to handle. The person who has been able to build some  

fair picture of himself hugs this fair image. He is loathe to admit in himself desires and thoughts and actions which would jar with this bright vision. Evidence which attests these dark colors in himself is ignored, glossed over, minimized; to admit such evidence would be to jeopardize the self-esteem he has precariously attained, to awaken the anxieties he has appeased. Contrariwise, any evidence that confirms his high opinion of himself is eagerly accepted, exhibited, maximized. In this way he can attribute to himself the traits he wishes to have and believes himself to have. The traits in himself which he rejects he attributes to other persons, and the difficulties he encounters he blames on others, and on "the world." So does the self protect itself against the thrust of more truthful ideas, and against the unsettling challenge of the ideal's enlargement and reconstruction.  

This process is an intensely active process. And it occurs in everyone. In the insane we merely meet it in its extreme forms. It is wisdom to recognize the presence and power of the forces by which the self actively opposes its own further development. For then we are protected against both the facile optimism that it is easy to think straight and the despair which comes when to think straight is found to be difficult.  

Perspective is kept when it is realized that the anti-rational forces in the self are not opposed to reason as such, but to extensions of rationality which are felt to threaten the self and force its change. Reasoning is itself active in anti-rationalism, but it is reasoning directed to maintaining the status quo of the self, and so directed against any activity of the intellect which awakens fears and anxieties that this status quo cannot be maintained. Anti-rationalism reveals itself to be not a campaign against rationality as such, but a campaign of the fearsome self to keep from itself the flimsiness of its  

present achievement and the urgency of its need for reconstruction. Argued irrationalism is indeed the cry of alarm of such a frightened self, a reasoned argument against the possibility of its own advance, an intellectual defense of its irresponsibility which it cannot bear to name.  

In its recognition of non-rational factors in the self and the anti-rational factors which hinder the reformation of the self, irrationalism is on safe ground, and a friend. It is an error and a danger when it becomes the cult of irrationality. It is then no longer an ally against those specious forms of rationalism which assume that to be rational means to be only and forever rational, but an enemy in man's midst, sapping his confidence in himself as the slow creator of himself. The cult of irrationality with its campaign against rationality, and the cult of rationality with its campaign against the irrational, are clowns in the same ring of Man's Bedevilment. The discourse of Clown Pure Reason proves too high, too exacting, too dry, and those in the ringside seats turn with delight to Clown Pure Unreason to hear of their unredeemable wickedness. But as this discourse raises in them the intended sense of sin they are called back to salvation by Pure Reason. And the toss-back is repeated, and repeated. The team is old and successful. The spectators are excited—but demoralized.  

The mature self knows that this is only a show. Knows that this splitting of itself into two incompatible domains is a salesman's trick. Knows that the human self needs all its urges, its passions, its conflicts, its delights. Knows that it must work upon these by ideas and ideals, but not repudiate them. Knows that reasoning is the way it makes itself over, slowly, laboriously, in the face of internal recalcitrance and external obstacles. Knows that the only ultimate irrationality is not to make oneself rationally. Knows that it is not rational  

to make rationality the final and complete goal of the diversified, many-sided, complexly human self.  

# Evasion of Responsibility: Determinism  

The second Big Word by which the self attempts to evade responsibility is Determinism. The reasoning appropriate to our age goes by the name of science. It is an ironic commentary on the state of our confusion that science, the major instrument of human freedom, should so often be feared as an enemy of this very freedom. Science, the theme runs, is deterministic, and determinism means that man has no say as to what will occur. This is a comfortable half-truth, for it relieves us of the difficult task of choice. Such determinism is in fact a form of anti-rationalism, a device by which reason tries to prevent the extension of reasoning to the dusty corners of the self and society. It is a seductive hide-out of verbal uncleanness which at once allows us to glory in our dirtiness and to do nothing about it. It is fear that motivates the cult of determinism, not science.  

For science is simply a stubborn and resolute search for reliable knowledge. It is an instrument which men have built against great resistance and through incredible labor for the liberation of ideas and for their certification. It is a superb illustration of the extent to which man does make himself. For the scientist is the specialist in knowing, one kind of self that man has made of himself, not the only kind or the only good kind, but an important and unique achievement. For if ideals are ideas clothed with preference, then it is of the greatest importance to have a technique that favors the emergence of new ideas and is able to sort out the more reliable ideas from the less reliable ones. Science is this technique. To oppose science in the name of ideals is in fact to oppose the main  

human activity by which old ideals are inspected and the basis for new ideals is laid. Such opposition rests on the fear of science; it is supported by anxious selves unsure at heart of what they claim to uphold. The argument that science is hostile to human freedom and dignity because it is deterministic cannot stand up under inquiry. It is not supported by science nor by valid argument. It is a confusion nourished by fear.  

Science does not eventuate in determinism. The half-truth of the cult of determinism is that science is mechanistic in the harmless sense that it seeks for mechanisms. It is concerned with the conditions under which something is what it is. Its laws when carefully analyzed always state that if something is so, then something else will be so with such and such probability. If phosphorus exists in dry air, then it is highly likely that it will burst into flame; if a body is raised above the ground and support taken from under it, then it is highly likely that it will fall to the earth in a specifiable time. Science does not say that under these conditions the flame or the fall "must" occur, since its statements are qualified in terms of the evidence which supports them. And more important, science does not say that any given set of initial conditions must occur, but only if they do what else is likely to happen. Men may see to it that phosphorus is kept in water, and that the raised body is given wings and motor so that it will fly. Knowledge of the mechanisms of phosphorus and falling bodies were means by which men learned more about the control of fire and about what they must do if they wished to fly.  

It is true that scientists tell us that certain conditions are highly stable, and it is also true that men may not be able to effect any substantial change in these particular conditions. It may happen for instance that our sun will sometime flare up and destroy us. The statement that this is to occur, and  

when, might even become a scientifically attested statement. And it might well be that men could not prevent the sun's maneuver. But to admit this is merely to admit again that men live in a mighty world. The half-truth of determinism is sufficient to silence the chant of the Clown Free Will that a man can do anything he wants at any time. But it does not silence our just conviction that we are free in the sense that we are effective agents in our own advance, and remain so as long as we remain alive. Whether we like or dislike the mighty world is still an open alternative, and the attitude to take to a death we could not avoid would be still a problem. Our problems are the seat of our opportunities. What we cannot do, others yet may do. And when our own might lessens, our courage still may grow.  

Each scientific statement is simply one more factor entering into the process of self-making. But a very important factor. For a scientific statement is a reliable sign, a reliable idea. And without reliable signs we cannot predict, and if we cannot predict we cannot plan. In an utterly chaotic world we would have no leverage for the construction of our lives. We would simply be part of the chaos. Only if we can know what is likely to occur under what conditions are we in a position to attempt to control these conditions or control our attitudes to what will appear in case the conditions are beyond our control. It is the task of science—the sole task of science—to give us reliable knowledge. That is the contribution of science to our freedom. We are free only to the extent that we can find stabilities, and science is the instrument we have built to find such stabilities. The more it can succeed, the better it is for our freedom. We expect science to tell us the details of our purposive behavior, even the conditions of our freedom. For if we wish to enhance our freedom we must know how  

and when freedom appears, what favors its extension, what thwarts its increase.  

This is to say that even in the knowledge of ourselves the indefinite extension of science is not only to be welcomed but is necessary. The age of man needs a science of man. Such a science is under way. Studies of persons' physical constitutions, the dynamics of their goal-seeking, the role that societies play in molding their characters, the impact of other specific individuals on their development, the way signs operate in their lives:—these studies are not only under way but are converging toward a genuine science of man. And this knowledge is becoming a powerful instrument which persons can use in their own development. By knowing about themselves men and women will increase their freedom.  

The self can fly only if it knows the conditions of psychological gravitation under which it tends to fall. To fly well requires reliable instruments of navigation. The science of man must provide such instruments for flight in the celestial regions of modern selfhood.  

But as in the case of all scientific statements, the statements of a scientific psychology will be merely additional factors to be used in the construction of our lives. In this construction the focus must of necessity be personal, for it is one's own unique self that one is forming. One must of necessity listen to one's urges, probe the various possibilities of advance, mediate, choose, reject. We must and can use all the knowledge of the material upon which we work—our own selves—that we can get. Scientific knowledge is not determinism but a lever for freedom's grip. A science of man is not man, but one more tool for the making of men. As scientists our question is: "What am I entitled to believe?" As persons our problem is: "What do I choose to become?"

At this point, as the defenses of our irresponsibility threaten to collapse, we may succumb to the current temptation to fall back upon a far older defense: our sinfulness. We are evil. Irredeemably petty, inadequate, shortsighted, inconsiderate, cruel, corrupt, and selfish. We are nauseated at ourselves. We want to be saved somehow by somebody. But we cannot do the job ourselves. We are lost in sin. No exit. We are just too bad.  

This way of talking to ourselves has a hard core of truth. Sin is indeed a Big Word. On all of us some of the time, and on a lot of us a lot of the time, the list of adjectives from "petty" straight through to "selfish" fits like a glove. To recognize this is to penetrate the hard crust of our pretences, to admit our need of help, to become humble about our attainments, to gain the insight that we continually stand in the way of our own advance. In this there is sanity and wisdom. For life continually tends to stagnation, acquiescence, complacency. The pride in achievement blocks greater achievement. What we have produced in our activities may threaten even our continued existence. That is why we have sanitation systems and fire departments and wrecking crews. That is why we change the water in the goldfish bowl.  

But beyond this the doctrine of sinfulness becomes evasive strategy. Why do we take such delight in talking in its terms to ourselves about ourselves? When we luxuriate in the words of sinfulness are we not pretending to be bigger than we really are—to be big at least in evil? Most of our evils are so small they are not worth recording; few of us are as big in badness as we pretend to be. Is not this reiterative talk of our sinfulness itself a sin? For it allows us to indulge our vices on the  

ground that we are too sinful to correct them. Many a self has smacked its lips in professing nausea at its rottenness. The doctrine of the depravity of man is strategy for the evasion of responsibility.  

Nothing is good or bad in itself. To call something good or bad is to view it as satisfying or frustrating some unquestioned urgency or some accepted ideal. The swoop of the bird that catches a fish is good for the bird and bad for the fish. The sexual drive that is repudiated by the ascetic is the welcome agency by which lovers may know joy. The house that is just right for a small family becomes cramping as the family grows. Man is sinful only to the degree that what he does prevents him from becoming what he would like to be. Urgencies are not sinful in themselves but in relation to other urgencies.  

Since human lives are so interlocked, the satisfaction of the urgencies of others becomes part of one's own urgency; we want to be what others whom we respect or cherish want us to be, and we want to act in such ways as will allow those whom we respect or cherish to become what they want to be. Our own growth is dependent at crucial moments upon other selves, and even upon their growth. Other persons enter decisively, dramatically, even fatally, into the making of our selves, and how we choose to live may enter decisively, dramatically, even fatally, into the life history of other persons. To our other urgencies is added in this way the moral urgency, one urgency among others, one factor in our multiple selves. To call ourselves sinful is in part an acknowledgment of our failures to satisfy our desire to grow in such a way that others may grow in their own ways.  

But this is not the whole of our worries. For any urgency that has become an accepted ideal encounters obstacles, obstacles in the world and obstacles in the self. These obstacles  

are the dark powers, the forces of evil. Since they exist in relation to an ideal, they will always exist as long as there are ideals. The fight for the actualization of the ideal is a real fight, and with no final round.  

So when the gong of responsibility sounds we are tempted to stay in our corner of the ring. We are afraid to venture forth to the center of peril. But we do not like to admit it. So we say that we are too sinful to do anything else. And we pull the dressing gown of Sin around our shoulders, and take what comfort we can in its warmth.  

This possessiveness, this holding on to what we are and have, is a mighty power. It is what our theologians mean by primordial sin, or by absolutizing the relative, or by clinging to a created good instead of being transformed in a creative process. It is the main obstacle to the ongoing process of life-making. It will always be an obstacle. But instead of evading responsibility by glorying in our sinfulness, our greed, our selfishness, we must attack the psychological and social forces which generate and support possessiveness.  

We are selfish not because we are自我 but because we do not have enough of self. And significant selflessness is not found in absence of self, but in plenitude of self. We become non-possessive not by becoming smaller but by becoming larger. Our sinfulness is not in our limbs but in our not daring to walk forth. It is not the wind which is lacking, but the hoisting of our sails. We fear to set out on what Sidney Lanier called the deepest of the seas—our self.  

# Return to Responsibility  

Our masks are torn. The defenses of our irresponsibility are broken. We must return to our career of man-making.  

To choose what one is to become is to assume the burden  

of the ideal, to assume the responsibility for ideals. Ideas are no longer enough. For the question now is not merely to entertain possibilities but to give allegiance to some possibilities and to withdraw allegiance from others. The problem is not merely to signify accurately but to form preferences, to say that this shall be and this shall not be. The task is not to guess the future by ideas but to give futurity to a chosen ideal. In this task we go beyond the task of science, for even to choose to be a scientist is to commit oneself to an ideal. The scientist's "impersonality" is the choice of a certain personality. He is not detached from all ideals; he has merely limited his devotion to the ideal of knowledge, and in that quest he has the fervor of a bloodhound. If he opposes other fervors, other kinds of self-making, then it is he who has turned traitor, and perverted science into another haven for the evaders of responsibility. As choosers of our future we enter the domain of the formers of ideals, the domain of artists, statesmen, prophets. We do not negate scientific knowledge as we make this step, nor relinquish its method. For scientific knowledge is needed in the task, and the method of science is the method of our rationality at its best. It is merely that our full selves now drive us to decisions.  

It is seldom that we directly ask ourselves what we choose to become. Most of us take ourselves for granted. We like ourselves, or pretend to like ourselves, and we pat ourselves on the back as long as we can. We even fear the blunt question, and do what we can to avoid it. We smile reassuringly in the mirror of self-esteem as we put on our habitual clothes to bustle forth into our habitual day. Most of our choices are modest—which coat to buy, which candidate to vote for, whether to take up skiing, whether to serve ripe or stuffed olives at dinner. Our bite into the ideal is modest. Smallness is  

comfortable and comforting. We avoid letting big ideals bite into us—as long as we can.  

But sometimes we cannot. For we cannot escape crises. Every person in every society in every age faces crises of varying import. Periods of illness, choices between careers, stone walls of defeat, last farewells. These crises involve large areas of the self, sometimes the total self. The self's very future is then at stake. And there are times in history when many individuals face simultaneously such revolutionary moments, when war and calamity shake a whole society, when insecurity and anxiety become everyone's burden, when the remaking of society itself cannot be postponed. Then the making of the self's future and society's future become a single task.  

Most of us are aware that we live at one of the critical moments of human history. Many of us are now beginning to admit that we have made the crisis for ourselves. All of us must begin to assume the responsibility for doing better.  

In periods of pervasive crisis the problem of what we are to choose to become grows insistent. And this for a simple and compelling reason. When existing social institutions become insecure, the customary clothes of the self no longer keep warm its self-esteem. It can no longer look in the mirror of the habitual and say honestly that it is well dressed. The clothes which made the man are tattered and the man is forced to admit that he is unkempt. Some react by making funny faces; some by assuming death's grimaces. The cows of old wisdom are brought in from the fields and are milked for all they can give. Crowds begin to gather around the stalls of the prophets to hear that the last age of the world is at hand, or that the first hour of a new dawn has come. There are displays of temper, street fights, mounting anxieties. The  

customary roads of the socially habitual are blocked. Persons must of necessity turn to themselves. Men must perforce do what they wished to avoid: meet themselves, assume responsibility for their futures.  

In this distress of not knowing what is to become of it, the self must ask what it is to become. This is the ultimate problem which the responsibility of the ideal imposes, ultimate because on its answer depends the answer to every other human problem. For in the last analysis every social institution must be judged in terms of its effects upon persons. This is true whether the institution be a school system, or a church, or a business, or a whole society. To say that a given institution is good or is bad is ultimately to say that it produces a kind of person we accept as desirable or undesirable.  

But this means that we must have some well-founded ideal of what kinds of persons are desirable. Otherwise we are rudderless and adrift. That is why as human distress deepens we are forced to raise the ultimate question as to the form or forms of selfhood to which we will give our allegiance. As we answer this question we obtain a criterion to judge social institutions, and to reconstruct them. If we fail to answer it we fail as men, since we have failed in the essential human task of self-creation. The question is radical, since it goes to the root of the human matter. And an answer is revolutionary, since the shape of things social yet to come revolves around the decision as to what men choose to be.  

But though radical and revolutionary, the question as to the self's future is temporal and local. Man reconstructs himself at a given moment under given conditions, and his decision is directed to what he will be next. To believe that one decision will make unnecessary future decisions is to turn traitor to the ongoing process of human creation. Sufficient  

untto the day thereof should be the artisan's act; sufficient unto their own day should be the acts of future artisans. That is why the udders of ancient wisdom weaken in nourishment. Their milk was strong food to men at a given time and place, and it remains food to later men. But to rely solely on it in a radically new situation is a mark of distress and desperation, a failure of human husbandry. To legislate past wisdom into the present is a sign of impotence, to legislate such wisdom as we can obtain into the far future is arrogance. Our task is not to perpetuate the past or to detail the future of those who are yet to come. Our task is simply to make what we can of ourselves, out of the materials at hand. Now.  

# The New Integrity  

We are in the early stages of a new epoch. That epoch needs time to unfold. It will take forms we cannot envisage. New selves are needed, selves adequate to endure and to form this epoch. It is our responsibility to become such persons. For our own sake and for the sake of mankind.  

It is a time of peril. We are in danger of stalemate, in danger of failing to carry through what we have begun, in danger of selling out. We as individuals are the center of peril. The dark powers of the night are in ourselves. But also in ourselves are the powers that can carry us into the dawn.  

We will regain integrity. We will blast apart our stalemate. We will use our scientists. We will use our artists and our prophets. We will think in terms of the whole earth. We will reform our ideals. We will resume the responsibility for man-making. We will not sell out. We will carry through what we have begun.  

This is the new confession we dare to make.  

# Man's Knowledge
of Man  

MEN HAVE ALWAYS HAD IDEAS OF WHAT they are—many ideas, often conflicting and divergent. And these ideas, whether true or false, are always important, indeed, the most important ideas that men can have. Yet the pitfalls in man's knowing of man are more numerous than the number of men. We have already noted the active processes which prevent a person from knowing too much about himself lest this knowledge upset the equilibrium he has managed to obtain. The ideal which one holds for oneself distorts the ideas which one has of oneself. But this is only the beginning of the traps. For a person is much in his own company and tends to generalize his own uniqueness into a picture of other persons. A theory of human nature is often little more than disclosure of the theorist's particular nature. And when men and women in a given culture have attained a recognizable similarity, it is human—all-too-human—to generalize the description of that human nature into a doctrine of what all men are under all social conditions. Confusion of men's ideals with true ideas of man, the projection of one's unique self into other persons, the extension of man at a given time into eternal man—these are the traps into which man the hunter falls in his hunt for man.  

Such difficulties help to make intelligible the fact that although "Know thyself!" is an ancient injunction, it has been an exceedingly difficult injunction to follow. A science of man, in the modern sense of science, is still in its infancy. It is not a paradox that the science most important to man has had to await the development of the physical, biological, and social sciences. Men have had to hunt for themselves by making elaborate preparations and long detours. To know themselves men have had to supplement and correct their observations of themselves by learning about other persons and by listening to what other persons say about them. They have had to approach themselves to windward lest the quarry scent the hunter, and escape.  

The necessity for this outward circling in attaining a science of man must not be misinterpreted. The point is not that we should forego self-observation or turn our backs upon the words of former sages. In building our lives we are entitled to use whatever ideas and ideals awaken our assent, and since it is our own life we are building we must of necessity be attentive to ourselves. In this task where each is on his own, there is no obligation to listen only to the scientist. The artists, the literati, the men of religion, the philosophers, the social reformers of this and every age have drawn blueprints for the mansion of the self, or at least for rooms in this mansion, and to ignore their suggestions in the name of science would be naive. The point is simpler. It is merely that the modern science of man has been assigned the task of giving us carefully certified knowledge about men upon which trained investigators can agree. The knowledge it has obtained about man is still meager. To use it alone would be foolhardy. To fail to use it for what it is worth would be a signal instance of irresponsibility. For then we would have relinquished the  

instrument which we as men have laboriously built to avoid the pitfalls in the hunt for ourselves.  

The science of man as it is developing today has four main accents. One line of study is concerned with persons' bodies. Another is interested in the influence of the physical environment upon persons. A third investigates social institutions and cultural patterns. The fourth specializes in the signs which persons produce. These are the constitutional, ecological, cultural, and semantical facets of the science of man. They obviously involve each other. They are beats from the same drum. It is important that we listen to each of them, and hear them all at once. For these four approaches taken together give us insight into the dynamics of personality development. We need to add them to our knowledge of ourselves.  

# Accent on the Body  

A mighty conspiracy against the body is coming to an end. The Greeks did not know of it, and the new age will analyze it as an historical curio. We are still too much a part of this conspiracy against the body to be very wise about it. For almost two thousand years of our Western history we have depreciated, ignored, slandered our bodies. Our religions have been religions of bodiless souls and our psychologies have been psychologies of bodiless minds. We have tried to act as disembodied men, and we pay the penalty. Even patient bodies finally protest. It is true that we have confided in our doctors. And art has shown us naked. Bathing suits and fashion designers have learned the grammar of accentuation. The athletic physique is out in public, though other types of physique still wear protective clothing and feel ill at ease without it. Our bodies are always with us but not yet quite officially. The  

Greeks would not have understood us. We are beginning to find it difficult to understand ourselves.  

This conspiracy of which we are a part is perhaps understandable as a phase of Western man-making. We have wanted to make ourselves over into something more than animal bodies. Through the voice of Christ the ideal of sympathetic concern for others has pricked us. Through the voice of science we have felt the lure of clean ideas. In the words of Bertrand Russell, we have wanted a life inspired by love and guided by wisdom. And though we have wanted this strongly, we have been naive, and our naivete has betrayed us. We came to believe that we were what we wanted to be. Instead of engaging in the difficult task of transforming ourselves by our ideals, we transformed our ideals into costumes to hide our recalcitrant bodies, and to free them surreptitiously for untrained revelings. And since we felt ill at ease and without integrity we needed a scapegoat. So we blamed "the body," reviled it, conspired against it. But neither the luxury of grief nor high talk about high ideals is efficient tactics for becoming human. The body remains the core of the self and must be enlisted in its construction. That is why the science of man must start with the human organism.  

That different kinds of personality are related to different kinds of physiques is not a new insight. The Greeks had many names for these connections, and knew something of the relation of physiques to physical illnesses and to differences of temperament. Interest in these matters was continued in the Arabic world, and ran as a subterranean stream through the European post-medieval world. But it did not color the dominant psychologies or play a basic role in Western man's understanding of himself. Nor did any great growth of insight occur. Pavlov at the end of his life had nothing better than  

the Greek classification of temperaments to describe the differences between his dogs.  

The medical men have been the sages who saw the importance of the human physique, and it is Western medicine that is forcing us to break up the conspiracy against the body. Among us the medically trained psychologist, Dr. William H. Sheldon, has done most to bring our attention back to the body as an aid in understanding the differences between persons. The "constitutional psychology" presented in his books, The Varieties of Human Physique and The Varieties of Temperament, is young but alive and suggestive. The future may bring great changes in this field. But we do not live in the future. And we need to acknowledge our bodies now, for the sake of our selves. We are not only bodies, but we are not disembodied. We have never acted as if we were. We should stop pretending that we are.  

Human physiques, Sheldon tells us, differ in many ways. They differ greatly in the sheer fact of size. They divide not merely into male and female, but they differ also in the extent to which men's physiques have characteristics generally found in women's physiques, and the other way around. They differ markedly in the degree to which various parts of the body are harmonious or disharmonious. There are persons with very powerful upper portions of the body and very weak legs, persons with heavy thick legs and thin delicate faces and trunks, persons with large strong arms but small weak hands, and so on endlessly.  

Such differences are of great importance. They exert a continuous influence on the self in its development. Small persons and large persons in the same culture show the effects of their size—occupations easy for one may be difficult for another. The womanly man and the manly woman have their  

own unique problems. The powerful boy with curvy hips and developed breasts will know this fact if he attempts to box or to swim in public, and he will be continually affected by it. The girl with the strength which men like to claim for themselves cannot long miss the reaction of men to this strength—even if she tries to simulate weakness by wobbling on high heels. The strong-above and weak-below man will have his difficulties in football. The stocky-below and delicate-above woman will not find an easy outlet in the world of the ballet if the difference between below and above is extreme. The size of a hand may spell success or failure in forward-passing or in performance at the piano. The outlets of the self are profoundly, continually, inevitably affected by the self's body. The smallest differences between physiques may be momentous in their cumulative insistence. It is high wisdom to know our bodies. Their minutiae, and their overall styles.  

We are all dimly aware of three extreme styles of physique. The soft body, the husky body, the fragile body. Bodies which remind us of circles, or squares, or straight lines. Abdomen-centered bodies, chest-centered bodies, spine-centered bodies. Santa Claus, the Greek athletes, the Oriental ascetics. We are crudely familiar with these differences, and the artists and theatre folk know them well.  

What Sheldon has done in The Varieties of Human Physiology is to show that a precise description can be given of three sets of bodily traits, that every physique—even the extremes—manifests traits of all three sets in some particular combination, and that the strength of each trait, and so their form of combination, can be measured. The result is called a person's somatotype, or type of body. The term "somatotype" must not be misunderstood. Strictly speaking, there are no  

"types" of physique in the sense that there are three (or three hundred or three thousand) sharply distinguished molds into which bodies fit. Each physique is unique, and endless gradations between physiques occur. So it is best to talk of kinds of bodies, and not of types.  

Sheldon has called the three sets of traits whose combination partially describes the body endomorphy, mesomorphy, ectomorphy. These terms are becoming current on adult lips and they will soon be on the lips of babes. They are convenient pegs to talk about persons—almost too seductively convenient. So we must use them carefully and not too often.  

Endomorphy refers to soft roundedness in a physique. A physique extreme in endomorphy has a rounded head, soft protruding lips, a short large neck, arms large near the shoulders with the upper part of the arm longer than the lower, small pudgy hands, a large middle section of the body, thighs large and longer than the portion of the leg below the knee, little feet. In the extreme cases the endomorphic body reminds one of a soft ball that might roll well. But a body may be quite endomorphic without being fat, depending on what else it is.  

Mesomorphy refers to the amount of bone, muscle, and connective-tissue development. The extremely mesomorphic body has good posture, a cubical head with a strong lower jaw, a large muscular mouth, a neck wider across the front than from front to back, the upper and lower portions of the arms and legs of about equal length, strong hands and feet with bony joints, the chest predominant over the abdomen, firm elastic skin with visible blood vessels. The general impression is of a strong bony structure covered with modeled muscles. These bodies charge or stand firm. They are not likely to roll or to retreat.  

Ectomorphy names the linear fragility of the body. The extreme cases are slender reeds. A head tending to triangularity, small pressed lips, alert eyes, the chin the point of a triangle, a long thin neck, a humped back giving the body the shape of a question mark, small chest and abdomen, long thin legs and arms with the lower portions longer than the upper ones, slender feet and hands. Such bodies do not give us the sense of softness or of muscled bone, but the impression of alertness, sensitivity, brittleness, angularity.  

The selves that wear these different bodies have been to different tailors. But the extremes are rare—a few for each thousand persons. Most of us wear mixed assortments of bodily styles. To call someone an endomorph or mesomorph or ectomorph merely means that he or she is more of the one than the others. An adequate description would tell how much of each, the variations of each in different parts of the body, and much more. To follow out this lead you must go to Sheldon. For our purpose it is sufficient to know that while we differ greatly in emphasis, each of us is endomorphic, mesomorphic, and ectomorphic to some degree. If we forget that, and wave careless words about three "types" of bodies, the fault is ours. And not our body's. And not Sheldon's.  

Sheldon also tells us that persons' temperaments—their basic styles of behavior—follow in general the styles of their bodies.  

The endomorphic physique is said in general to move in a slow relaxed way, to sleep easily and deeply, to welcome orderly and ceremonies rituals, to delight in quantities of good food well prepared and served, to choose comfortable furniture, to be friendly and tolerant with many persons, to like social gatherings, to be equable in its moods, to seek people when in trouble.  

The temperament of the mesomorph, we are told, is turned  

more to action, to adventure, to the use and manipulation of persons and things, to power. These persons in general drive ahead without much sensitivity to their own motivations or to the motivations of others. Their posture is erect, their energy is high, their gaze is outward to the situation, they characteristically take the initiative in social groups. They work out of trouble by action.  

The ectomorph is said to be high-keyed, sensitive, wary, on the defensive, to have trouble in sleeping, to tire easily and continually, to be for ever probing himself and his motivations, to resist the loss of self-awareness which alcohol and anaesthetics threaten, to shy away from large open places and large social groupings, to turn to meditation and reflection when in trouble.  

# Dependence, Domination, and Detachment  

Sheldon calls the three temperaments which have been described visceraltonia, somatotonia, and cerebrotonia. These terms, however, name clusters of temperamental traits. For our purposes it is tempting (but risky) to try to probe deeper, to find if possible something common to the traits within each cluster. Is there any common need which is met by the traits in one of his clusters of traits? If there is, we would be in sight of basic human motivations—a tempting prize!  

The feeling that basic needs are present is hard to down. But to name them is harder. Any name we choose is applicable in various ways to each of them. The most we can expect are names that are appropriate in the emphasis they suggest. We choose the terms dependence, domination, and detachment as names for three corresponding basic human needs.  

The traits which comprise viscerotonia involve in various ways the dependence of the person upon a dependable en  

environment of persons and things—friendly people, available food, comfortable living quarters, sustaining ceremonies. The need is for easy compliance with the world and for a world that easily complies with the body by not demanding too much effort. The person depends, hangs on the physical and social world, is receptive to it, belongs to it, does not retreat from it or attempt to make it over, wishes sustenance, wishes a dependable world—that is, a world on which he can depend.  

The traits which comprise somatotonia exhibit in various ways the need to be dominant in a situation (which is not necessarily the need to be domineering). Not a dependable world but a controllable world, a world in which effort is efficacious, a world in which one can initiate changes and lead them to a desired eventuation. The need is for power over persons and things, the excitement of overcoming, the sense of domination.  

Detachment seems to characterize the traits of cerebrotonia. It is movement away from excessive external stimulation, away from a demanding pushing world. A movement toward the inner man. Not comfort is wanted, not power, but awareness of oneself. Not involvement in the world, but the world at a safe distance. That one may listen to the self, protect the self, savor the self, live with heightened consciousness.  

Such are the meanings of dependence, domination, detachment in our account. They differ from Sheldon's terms in attempting to name the motivation behind his three sets of traits. Seen as motivations, the relation of temperaments to kinds of bodies may perhaps appear more plausible. For dependence seems to express the need of the soft relaxed physique for a sustaining world in which it does not have to strive; domination, the need of the muscled bony physique to have material to manipulate; detachment, the need of the linearly  

fragile physique to enjoy its sensitivity and yet avoid the over-stimulation to which it is so liable. And as bodies show all kinds of variations of endomorphy, mesomorphy, and ectomorphy, so should persons differ widely in the relative strength of their needs for dependence, domination, and detachment. Which is what they seem to do.  

Evidence that different physiques do differ in this manner will be gained when we turn later to the various ways to live which various persons prefer. But it is worth noting at this point that a study of what paintings are preferred by persons of extreme physique confirms the suggested connection between bodies and motivations. Extreme endomorphs prefer paintings in which the persons portrayed are receptive, relaxed, meditative, neither on the offensive or defensive; the lines of the pictures are flowing, curvy, effortless; the colors are warm, sensuous, decorative. Kroll's Figure Outdoors, Modigliani's Woman With a Necklace, Rousseau's The Waterfall ranked high in their preferences.  

!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  

The paintings preferred by the extreme ectomorphs are characterized by reserve, stability, restraint; the figures portrayed are thoughtful, alert, restrained rather than receptive or active; the cool colors and the balanced vertical and horizontal lines give the compositions the sense of self-containedness rather than of sensuous fullness or explosive excitement.  

Picasso's Two Harlequins, Cezanne's Stockade, Bellini's The Doge are visible exemplifications of what the extreme ectomorph holds dear. The paintings liked by these three groups of persons are an objective exhibit of the close connection between body and basic motivation.  

To call dependence, domination, and detachment "needs" is merely to say that bodies do strive in varying degrees to attain a sustaining world, power, and protected self-awareness. These needs are fundamental in the sense that they are the persistent forms of striving. There are of course other bodily needs—need of air, need of food and water, need of sex, need of shelter. But these needs of special organs take characteristic forms within the over-all needs of organisms as a whole, and differ as organisms differ.  

The seat of our needs is our body. As our bodies differ our needs differ. That is why in understanding men and women we must understand their bodies. And why in building a life we must know our own body.  

# Accent on the Physical Environment  

But the body is not an embalmed mummy encased in glass against the interplay of change. It is a dynamic thing in a world of dynamic things, marvelously sensitive to what goes on about it, maintaining its identity within and in spite of and because of change. It is at each moment what it is because of what it was and what is happening to it, and its action at each moment casts its weight forward in determining what it and other things will be at succeeding moments. The body starts in a world, grows in a world, ends in a world. If the self is not disembodied, neither is it worldless. And its world is always made up of both lifeless and living things.  

Ellsworth Huntington is representative of those who are  

forcing us to pay attention to the effects of the physical environment upon man. He himself is aware that this environment acts always on persons of a given physique at a given time, and that this environment and its effects differ at different stages of cultural evolution. But he is insistent that we do not ever neglect this physical environment, and he is correct in this insistence.  

Huntington's Mainsprings of Civilization is crammed with data and suggestions as to how human beings are affected by geographical differences of various parts of the earth: the jungle presents different problems for life than do the mountains, the plains, or the sea; hot temperatures of the equator have different effects than do cold ones of the earth's far north and south; the food available in various regions poses various obstacles and opportunities; a constant climate does one thing to bodies and a sharply changing climate another; various altitudes leave their various marks, and the changes of the seasons interplay with the body's rhythms. The life that scampers on the earth is responsive to its parts and varies with its moods. No wonder that poets have divinized this being, blessed her, feared her, cursed her. For poets are persons of urgent speech. Taking a clue from Huntington, let us venture forth on our own.  

The geographical environment sets problems and opportunities for the body. And according to differences in various regions and at various times, it provides different problems and opportunities for different bodies. What is a problem for the mesomorphic physique may be an opportunity for the endomorphic or ectomorphic physique, and vice versa, and in a thousand different forms. A hot equatorial physically obdurate plot of the earth may sap the strength of the mesomorph but cause less trouble to the endomorph whose body does not demand such excessive action or to the ectomorph  

who can tolerate heat but not extremes of cold. In such a corner of the earth the power motivation may not have easy outlets for the control of nature. It may take the form of domination over multitudes of men who can be forced to do collectively the labor which in large amounts is exhausting to the individual. If at the same time the dependency motivation is fulfilled and an outlet provided for those in whom the detachment motivation is strong, there may arise a stable social structure appropriate to the equatorial region and its inhabitants. Is not this in fact about what we find in large parts of the Orient?  

Or take our colder north. Is it not illuminating to think of the power-inventive, power-accumulative, power-driven, and power-explosive West as a great northward thrust of mesomorphs lured by new worlds to conquer? Can we really imagine that extreme endomorphs or ectomorphs would engineer such thrusts? And is it not sensible that as the mesomorphic adventurers brought the environment under control, and devised appropriate clothing and shelter, the initially predominant mesomorphic stock would become less mesomorphic both by the infiltration of other kinds of physiques into a region in which they could now live, and by the birth and survival of kinds of physiques in the region other than those needed to first conquer it? It is Huntington's hypothesis that migrations and natural selection raise to dominance certain kinds of physiques in certain geographical regions, and so influence the culture of a given region. We are suggesting that hard northward migrations selectively favor the mesomorphic physique. Our culture may be in large part an expression of the mesomorph's reaction in an environment in which he has been numerically predominant. This is a theme to which we will return when we analyze our own society.  

Perhaps "Eastern" attitudes are mainly attitudes of the  

earth's middle, and "Western" attitudes mainly attitudes of the earth's north and south? The New World has little equator, the Orient has little else. Russia, Australia, New Zealand, South Africa, all far from the equator, go "Western." The Orient is largely an equatorial belt around the body of the earth. The Old South of the United States did its best to look like the Orient instead of the North. East vs. West is more nearly Equator vs. North-South. Perhaps the mesomorphs are more at home at the temperate zones of mother-earth, and the endomorphs and ectomorphs more at home at her center. Or at least have been. For if men change their environment sufficiently they can live anywhere.  

In the future perhaps all kinds of men will inhabit all kinds of earth. The East and the West will then have largely met and merged. But the physical environment will remain, and will differentially affect different kinds of persons. A controlled physical environment is still a physical environment. And control is a matter of degree. We will always live in a world bigger than ourselves. And react differently to its bigerness. The point for the moment is that we must bring together in our thoughts the body and the earth.  

# Accent on Society  

The world in which the body becomes a self is also and always a social world. Also and always for the good reason that a child left alone at birth cannot survive. The social world is a world which contains older persons—for the simple reason that a child has parents. These older persons have in one way or another learned to live together in a manner that satisfies certain of their needs—for the sufficient reason that they are still alive. And this way of living constitutes a culture. The body becomes a self within, and only within, a culture. This  

culture exerts a profound influence upon the self, supplies it with material for its own further making. The human self is irreducibly and inescapably both biological and social—it is bio-social.  

A culture is a scheme for living by which a number of interacting persons favor certain motivations more than others and favor certain ways rather than others for satisfying these motivations. The word to be underlined is "favor." For preference is an essential trait of living things. To live without preference would be to stop living. If all motivations were equally strong none would budge the self toward its satisfaction. If no manner of satisfying a need were more compelling than another, the feet of the self would be without traction for advance. To live at all is to act preferentially—to prefer some goals rather than others and some ways of reaching preferred goals rather than other ways. A culture is such a pattern of preferences held by a group of persons and transmitted in time.  

The making of a culture, like the making of anything else, is influenced by the conditions under which it occurs. Consider for example the bodies of its members and the region it inhabits. Imagine various groups of a hundred persons each, one group almost entirely endomorphic, another almost entirely mesomorphic, another almost entirely ectomorphic, living in very similar physical environments. It is hard to believe that these bodily differences would not show up in any social organizations that might be built. Hard to imagine, for instance, that the preferred mode of life of the endomorphic or the ectomorphic colony would be as physically energetic as that of the mesomorphic colony. But even here it is obvious that the result would be affected by the nature of the physical environment in which we carried out our imaginary  

experiment. And if we put our colonies in very different physical environments, we would expect even more different results—the endomorphic colony might then lead a more active life under certain circumstances than the mesomorphic colony. Add now new colonies in which the proportion of kinds of physiques is varied in all sorts of ways, and put these colonies in all sorts of physical environments; add also the variety of ideas men develop, and the variety of ways any given need may be satisfied; then we begin to see how an endless variety of cultures, and sub-cultures within cultures, would appear. We then understand why human history is as complicated and baffling and exciting as it in fact is. And why the science of man moves slowly.  

The anthropologists have described for us a great variety of the life-patterns which various groups of persons have made for themselves under various geographical and historical conditions. Ruth Benedict, in Patterns of Culture, details some of the differences in the American Indians. The Pueblo Indians, we are told, favored moderation, dignity, kindness, orderliness, mildness, social ceremony; while the Plains Indians favored excess, intensity, conflict, heroism, the breaking of routine, violence, individuality. The Pueblos restrained grief at death, the Plains Indians indulged in grief; the Pueblos shunned intoxicating drugs, the Plains Indians cultivated them; the Pueblos forbade suicide, the Plains Indians made provisions for it. In the one case compliant dependence was the favored motivation, in the other domination, individually attained power.  

Ruth Benedict tells us that the cause for this differentiation of cultural pattern is unknown. But she says that the Pueblos lived in "the inhospitable, almost waterless valley of the San Juan," a physical environment widely different from the  

plains. And if we knew something of the distributions of physiques in the two kinds of culture we might have a further clue. Strongly endomorphic individuals might find adjustment to the Pueblo world easier than to the world of the Plains Indians, and strongly mesomorphic individuals might find the reverse; the strongly ectomorphic individual might encounter difficulties in adjusting to either.  

A recent trip to the Hopi and Navaho Indian reservations in Arizona has convinced me of the plausibility of this type of hypothesis, and of the importance of including data on physiques in any study of cultural groups.  

The Hopi are a Pueblo people inhabiting a desert region. They are carefully described in The Hopi Way by Laura Thompson and Alice Joseph. We are told that the Hopi call themselves "the peaceful people," that they do not approve of any form of physical violence, that they stress inner tranquility and good will rather than emotional excitement, that they are trained to devotion to the group rather than loyalty to other individuals or to their own personal achievement, that the individual's life is minutely regulated in every sphere by a set of rules, that "each person's business is . . . the business of everybody else."  

In observing hundreds of Hopi in schools, hospitals, and ceremonies I was impressed by the fact that though the Hopi were dominantly mesomorphic, endomorphy was surprisingly strong and ectomorphy extremely low. This observation supports the hypothesis that endomorphy plays a prominent role in Pueblo personality and culture. I was also impressed by the great uniformity of Hopi physiques—much greater than among American whites or Negroes, and by the almost complete absence of disharmony between various parts of the body. Such uniformity and harmony match the social co  

hesiveness of Hopi culture, and the "balanced character" attributed to Hopi personalities. The Hopi Way stresses the interconnectedness of the Hopi environment, personality, and culture; it seems that Hopi bodies fit consistently into the total pattern.  

The Navaho, in contrast, while also predominantly mesomorphic, were decidedly lower in endomorphy and higher in ectomorphy. They were also much more variable in the variety of bodily differences, and more disharmonious in bodily structure. These observations appear to dovetail with the reports on personality and culture given by Clyde Kluckhohn and Dorothea Leighton in The Navaho. There we learn that Navaho social organization is much looser than among the Pueblo, and that individuality is much more highly esteemed. We are informed that witches are often killed brutally, that the penalties for murder, rape, and violence are relatively light, that the Navaho individual often feels uncertain and insecure.  

My observations, though careful, were in no sense a scientific study. They are introduced merely to buttress the point that bodies cannot be ignored even in the description of societies. Physique, environment, ideas, and culture form a dynamic field of mutually interacting and mutually conditioning factors.  

# Accent on Signs  

The culture into which a child is born consists of individuals who favor certain needs more than others, and favor certain ways of satisfying these needs rather than others. And such persons form and transform the child until it too more or less assumes this preference pattern, to pass it on in turn to its children.  

The basic needs of dependence, domination, and detach  

ment remain, for they seem to be anchored in physical differences which appear to some degree in every culture. Perhaps none of these needs is ever denied some expression. But they are weighted variously, helped or hindered, tolerated to various degrees, permitted or prohibited to some members of the society and not to others, prohibited in action but permitted in art, favored in certain combinations but not in others. The result is that certain kinds of personality are, in a given culture, approved of and other kinds of personality frowned upon. And since approval means reward and disapproval means deprivation, each individual tries to become a kind of person approved by his society, and to avoid becoming a kind of person disapproved by it. Some find it easy going and for some it is hard sledding; the body is plastic but not clay. Social clothes fit some persons better than others.  

The basic motivations are not merely weighted differently in various societies. The means by which they are permitted satisfaction differ widely. There are endless possible ways in which a hungry person might get food to his mouth, a countless variety of acts by which sexual desire can be satisfied, an un-specifiable number of forms of dependence, domination, and detachment. The body is less exacting as to how its needs are met than it is that they be met. The cultures determine permissible ways of satisfaction for the body's urgencies.  

Now this of course works back into the biological needs themselves, and gives them a determinate character. It is not just food that is wanted but food of a certain sort, prepared in a certain manner, eaten in the approved way. It is not just power that is wanted, but power of one kind and not another, and power exercised in one way and not another. What is desired is not merely the satisfaction of desire but socially approved desires satisfied in socially approved ways.  

When this stage is reached the body has become a human self. Its ideals are now not merely expressions of what it is but what it wishes to be. Its very ideas of itself are now colored by its ideals. Its urgencies are no longer merely animal needs but animal needs socially transformed and socially viewed. The body is still there, always there, but it has been dressed in social clothes. It looks at itself in a social mirror. It approves or disapproves of itself through social eyes.  

How this comes about has best been explained by George H. Mead in his book, Mind, Self, and Society. The answer he gives is language.  

For a person to look at himself through the eyes of others and to approve or disapprove of himself socially requires a very complex set of signs. He must be able to signify himself somehow as others would do, and respond to himself as others would respond. Only by taking the attitudes which other people take to him can he look at himself through social eyes. And according to Mead it is the development of language which makes possible such "taking the role of others." For with language one can say to oneself what others have said or might perhaps say, and so criticize oneself as though one were somebody else. One begins by conversing with others and ends by conversing with oneself. One signifies the rewards and deprivations which others will give even when the others are not present. And this signifying influences in turn how one will act. The individual has now begun to make himself by ideas and ideals.  

This is a momentous step. The language which an individual gains from society is at first one of the major ways by which society molds him to its pattern of preferences. But when he has acquired language he becomes a producer of signs and not merely a being responding to the signs furnished by his body, his physical environment, or his society. And as he  

talks, he gains a new instrument for advancing his purposes. He no longer merely moves forward by the blind press of his preferences. He is now able to anticipate, to take the roles of others, to frame new ideas and ideals. The sphere of his freedom is immensely widened. The symbols he can now produce enter into his ongoing life. By their aid he can effect modifications in his body, and in his physical environment. He can by language even undertake to reform the society which made possible his selfhood by the gift of talk.  

Signs are of such basic importance in the human enterprise that we will consider them at length in the following chapter. Here we need only note that the study of signs has become in our day a vital part of the study of man. If this study is not carried on in isolation, but as one phase of the study of man, intimately linked with the studies of human physiques, environments, and cultures, it will add greatly to our understanding and to our resources.  

# Pause for Refreshment  

Let us stop a moment on this threshold to catch our breath, and to hear together what has been said separately.  

We have seen that the scientific study of man is being carried out from many points of view: in terms of bodies, physical environments, cultural patterns, and the role of signs in the development of the self. For the most part these studies have gone on independently, and with sharp words for one another. It is now imperative that they come together, fuse, interpenetrate. For the kinds of bodies that exist at a given time depend on parents, physical environments, even on the customs, ideas, and ideals of social groups. And the effect of the physical environment on persons differs with the physiques of these persons and with the technology which has been attained in the society they inhabit. The cultural patterns them  

selves vary with the distribution of physiques of their members, with the region inhabited, with the ideas and inventions gained at a certain stage of social development. Language affects different individuals differently, and differences between individuals show themselves in the signs they produce. The science of man must study these matters in their inter-relationships, must think in terms of interacting variables and not isolated entities, must formulate its results in terms of what given persons tend to do under what circumstances.  

When we begin to look at the matter in this way laws of human behavior will be gained. If we are wise we will carry on the study of man with the liberal resources and the cooperative techniques which we have devoted to the releasing of atomic energy. The returns may well be greater. We sorely need knowledge of ourselves, both for the sake of science and for the sake of our freedom.  

If what we said in the preceding pages is substantially correct, it has a bearing on the perennial question of the constancy and changeability of "human nature." Its bearing is largely to dissipate the opposition between rival schools. For constancy and changeability are matters of degree. Something can be relatively constant in some respects and relatively changeable in other respects. "Human nature" is both constant and changeable. As far as we know in time and as widely as we know in space men and women are endomorphic, mesomorphic, and ectomorphic; seek food, sex, and shelter; are motivated by dependence, domination, and detachment. In this sense we are all brothers and sisters under the skin and over racial and social boundaries. But human nature is variable in the sense that individuals differ widely in their bodies and in the strength of their needs, and societies at various times and places differ markedly in the constitutions of their  

members. Human nature is also plastic in the sense that it can tolerate various degrees of frustration of its biological needs and can satisfy its needs in an almost endless variety of ways. There are strands of stubbornness in human nature and elasticities. Basic similarities and basic differences. Both, and without contradiction.  

It is wisdom to recognize this. To do so makes us aware of our kinship with all persons on the earth. It gives us grounds to cherish and protect our differences. It unites us in common problems and permits us to seek new answers. It protects us from those who resist change by saying that human nature is unchangeable. It protects us from those who resist change by saying that since human nature is absolutely plastic we must simply adjust ourselves to society as it is. It also protects us from those who are so eager for change that they ignore the stubborn differences between individuals in a society, and justify their programs on the ground that since the self is social it can be changed at will. It gives us confidence in making ourselves along our own lines. It gives us caution against trying to make everybody else like ourselves.  

Only if there are relatively enduring features of the self is there any basis by which societies can be approved or disapproved. But only if the self needs society for its development and sustenance are we nerved to action in order to improve the social conditions under which men and women can more effectively make themselves.  

The tenacity of individual differences means that societies must accommodate themselves to individuals. The plasticity of the human self means that we are free to devise new patterns of culture. If we wish a world of autonomous persons we must prepare the social conditions which nourish and sustain the creative individual.  

# A Primer of  

MAN IS UNIQUE AMONG LIVING BEINGS IN the extent to which he lives in a world of signs. This is the sea in which the human fish swims. This is its natural element. Other animals, to be sure, respond to some things as signs of other things; and kinship with the rest of life is never lost. But what to other animals is incidental and episodical is to man essential and continual. While other organisms steer themselves by the signs which the world provides, the human being changes himself and changes the world by the signs he himself produces. Individual men and women differ in this respect as in all others, but with respect to the production of signs for the regulation of their own lives human beings differ from all other living beings. In shaping himself by the signs he produces man is unique. The measure of his signs is the measure of his freedom.  

This is why the study of signs is of such crucial importance, and why it must assume a central place in the science of man. Some call this study "semantics," some "significs," some "semiotic." Some like it hot and some like it cold. But whatever it is called and whatever its temperature, it is pivotal for our task. So we must square accounts with it. In another book, Signs, Language, and Behavior, I have given the colder ac  

count appropriate to a science of signs. Here we need only the essentials, and warm enough to keep us on the hunt for ourselves. A primer to prime us.  

Never before in history has there been a greater interest in learning about signs. It is revealing that the periods of maximum interest in this study have been times of pervasive social change, such as the period of Confucius, or the Hellenistic period of declining Greece, or the centuries when the feudal structure of medieval Europe was falling away before the rising commercial and industrial middle class. In such periods the symbols under which men have lived together begin to lose their clarity and persuasiveness, and the new symbols appropriate to a changed society have not been found. Communication is no longer easy communion, for emerging meanings clash with older ones. Language becomes ineffectual and the cultural symbols a problem because they no longer can be taken for granted. Men pay conscious attention to their signs when they no longer serve them well, just as they pay attention to their food when their stomachs hurt. In this sense the current vogue of semantics is a crisis phenomenon, a sign that all is not well with our signs.  

But it is more than that. For the study of man has forced the scientist himself to scale this wall. And for a simple reason. Put a hungry animal before food it likes and it will in all but the rarest cases simply start to eat. But put a hungry man before food he likes, and he may simply start to eat, or if he is a Gandhi at a certain moment in his life he may not eat at all, or if he is a Balinese he will not eat unless he is permitted to eat with his right hand, or if he is a pious Christian or Jew he will not eat until a blessing has been said. There is no simple "law" of human behavior which states that a hungry person will eat food placed before him, no automatic  

"response" to a given "stimulus." Ordinarily we would explain this by saying that what a person does may depend on his ideas and ideals. The more cautious scientist, seeking for something that can be objectively observed, hits upon signs; he will say that how a person responds to something is in part dependent on how this something is signified. Signs intervene in almost everything men and women do. This means that the scientist has to gain knowledge of signs in order to build a science of man. For the sake of science itself it proves necessary to add a study of signs to the study of bodies, physical environments, and cultures.  

But this study is also needed by the individual trying to become what he really is. For not only must a person understand how signs work if he is to understand how he acts, but he needs this knowledge in order to work effectively upon himself. Since the unique thing about the human being is that how he will act toward something is largely dependent on how he signifies that something, signs are the tool of tools for man-making. For man works on himself by his ideas and ideals, and these require signs for their operation, perhaps for their very existence. That is another reason why the study of signs is not a fad. And a good ground for adding this instrument to our pack.  

# The Varieties of Signs  

The ring of an alarm-clock, Time to get up. A glance out the window to see what the day's weather will be. A look in the mirror for a report on how one is faring. A shave or a careful hair-do, and the right clothes, so that one will be judged as one wishes to be judged. Pressure on oranges to select a good one. The smell of an egg, just to be sure. A hasty note to the milkman. A choice of busses by the numbers they carry. Scrutiny of black-on-white newspaper marks. A day of  

# A Primer of Semantics  

talking and being talked to. Constant attention to the material upon which one is working in the office or factory—or to clouds and animals and grain if the work is away from the city. Flowers at dinner, or a pat on the face, or a scowl. Movies or the theatre. Or a book. Or more talk. Then talking to oneself in falling asleep. And dreams to finish the day's unfinished business. Then another morning. The alarm-clock again.  

Signs, signs, signs! From sounds, sights, tastes, feels, odors. From things, from persons, from oneself. Take them away and we would be more humanly naked than if we walked the streets without clothes.  

What do all these events have in common that causes us to lump them together as signs? One core similarity: they all influence the way we tend to react toward something other than themselves. The alarm tells us the time, the sight of our face in the mirror informs us about our appearance, the newspaper tells us what has happened in the world, the pressure from the oranges or the odor of eggs determines which one we will select, the note to the milkman tells him how we wish him to act. The appearances of the sky or the words of the weather report influence the way we will dress, the way we will behave outdoors. We do not put on our raincoats indoors nor raise an umbrella between us and the newspaper. We eat not the menu but rather what its printed words stand for. Signs denote something other than themselves, other things or other aspects of the thing of which they are a part. The marks on the newspaper stand for happenings in China; the rate of our pulse beat stands for the condition of our heart. Signs influence our beliefs, our preferences, our feelings, our actions with respect to what they signify. They dispose us to react to something other than themselves in one way rather than another.  

Just what happens to us when something is a sign is a com  

plex puzzle, but one we do not here have to unscramble. Some persons would say that the sign causes in us an idea or a thought of something else, makes us conscious of something else. Other persons distrust this manner of talking, and prefer to say that the sign sets up some physiological or neural process in us, and so changes us that we tend to react differently to something else than we would have done if the sign had not occurred. We do not have to decide which account is correct or whether both are correct. For both agree that the sign does influence our reactions, does dispose us to act differently than we would otherwise act, does make us different from what we would otherwise have been. No one denies that signs and ideas are closely connected. To concentrate on signs may not tell the whole story, but it is good science, and it cannot lead us far astray. And for our purposes it is sufficient to regard a sign as anything which disposes us to react in a certain way to something other than itself.  

It is obvious at once that there are different kinds of signs, since we are disposed by signs to react in very different ways. Some signs mainly report, tell us what to expect, prepare us to encounter one kind of thing rather than another. The weather report is an example, or the numbers on the bus which report the route and destination of the bus. Such signs may be called designative signs.  

Other signs, however, influence our reactions in another way: they dispose us to look with favor or disfavor upon something, to slant our preferences, to select or reject this rather than that. They do not report what we can observe by our senses and instruments, but chronicle the goodness or badness of things. A certain odor disposes us to reject the odoriferous egg—or to offer it to someone we dislike. If we are told that there are oranges in the next room we expect round orange-colored fruit of a certain size and taste. If we are told  

merely that there is something good in the next room we are not informed what kind of thing is there, but we are inclined to seek it out, to pay attention to it, to favor it. If we are told that the orange on the table in the next room is better than the orange on the window-sill we both expect oranges and are disposed to prefer the one to the other. Signs which influence our preferences in this way we shall call appraisive signs.  

There is still another main kind of sign, a sign which disposes us to react to something by a definite course of action. These signs have a command quality, an imperative tone. They tell us not what exists, or what to like or dislike, but what to do. Such signs we shall call prescriptive. The note to the milkman tells him what to do, disposes him to leave a definite assortment of milk and cream and butter. We command ourselves in the same way. When we tell ourselves that we must buy a refill for our pens that write in the stratosphere or under the shower we are setting in motion a course of action in ourselves, prescribing to ourselves what is to be done when we pass Penman's store.  

The first lesson with respect to signs is to distinguish their designative, appraisive, and prescriptive elements. Most signs have all these facets: they are pure as seldom as selves are pure. Pure or impure, the distinctions are important. It makes a great difference whether "all men are equal" designates that persons are identical, or whether it appraises all men as equal in dignity, or whether it prescribes that we extend equal opportunities to all persons. We must know our signs. That is a prescription, of course. But not pure.  

# The Levels of Signs  

The second lesson concerning signs is to distinguish their levels. And this in two senses. Originally signs are about what is not a sign. But then there arise signs about signs, and even  

signs about signs that are about signs. A picture of our friend is not our friend, and the words "picture of our friend" are not a picture of our friend, nor our friend. This seems simple enough to fool no one, but it does. We constantly confuse these levels, believe we are talking about things when we are talking about signs. To call the villain in a play a good villain means that the portrayal of a villain by the actor is good, not that villainy is good. If a philosopher tells us that only actualities are real we have to make sure whether he is disclosing to us how he uses words or making a statement about the world's furniture. The "determinism" attributed to science frequently harbors the same confusion: to say that something "must" happen is merely to say that the statement describing the happening is a logical consequence of our present knowledge; the "must" signifies primarily a relation between signs; as our knowledge (and skill) changes, the "musts" change. So it is easy to be tricked, easy to confuse words and things, easy to believe that wherever there is a word a thing is named. In the extreme cases we are victims of sign-magic; in the less extreme ones we are guilty of sign-confusion.  

Signs have levels in a second sense, levels of complexity. There are signs which occur independently of language, there are language signs, and there are signs which while not language signs depend on such signs for their meaning. Let us call these in order pre-language, language, and post-language signs. The alarm-clock will redeem itself by serving as an example. Dogs can be trained to seek food in a certain place when the alarm sounds; the alarm is then to them a sign—but a pre-language sign since it is not dependent on language. Our word "alarm-clock" is a sign in the English language, and so a language sign. But the alarm-clock itself may become a  

sign in a still more complicated sense. For we talk about it to its face and it then gains a new meaning even though it can't talk back. Suppose for example we tell an alarm clock that it is the great curse of our life, getting us up earlier than we wish, sending us off into a day's activity we did not like. Then the clock itself may become a sign with all such meanings. It is not now a word in the English language, but it has taken on meanings first carried by words. It is a post-language sign in that sense. One can imagine that hoboes might set up an Alarm Clock on a pedestal in each of their jungles as a Symbol of the Industrial Age of Work—designative, negatively ap-praisive, and negatively prescriptive post-language symbols. Dogs cannot do this, not even the easy-going hobo dogs.  

Language in this way gives to events in our world and in ourselves a meaning they would not otherwise have. The world and our bodies say different things to us because we have talked to them. And so we act differently to them. Language is a wondrous human work. How we talk is a momentous matter.  

A language is social and has a vocabulary and a grammar. As social, language signs affect all those who share the signs in a similar way, awaken in them similar expectations, similar preferences, similar types of conduct. In having a grammatical structure a language permits a great variety of sign combinations, and so makes it possible to form new ideas and new ideals from old ones. As signs producible by those who share the language, language to some degree frees individuals from the simpler pre-language signs which the world and the body provide, and floods the world and the body with new meanings. The more we determine by our signs how we shall behave to things, the freer we are from their brute domination.  

Language is not found among the animals, nor its products.  

It is the mark of man. It marks, as George Mead has shown, the transition from body to selfhood. We are talked into selfhood. It is in talk that we celebrate our selfhood. Through talk we advance our selfhood. Man, Ernst Cassirer tells us in his Essay on Man, is the animal symbolicum.  

# The Uses of Signs  

There is still a third lesson to be conned: the multiplicity of the ways signs can be used. The language of our daily life uses all kinds of signs for all kinds of purposes. It is a jack-of-all-trades tool, the tool of tools. We could get along without it as little as we could get along without our nervous systems. But special jobs need specialized tools, and specialized forms of language have been developed for better performance of specific tasks. Ways of Talking have appeared. The talk of scientists, the talk of artists, the talk of religious men. Many more, of course. But these are central, and sufficient to impress upon us the richness of the forms of symbolism which human living has engendered.  

The language of science is a specialization of ordinary language for the purpose of accurately designating what has happened, what is happening, what will happen. The task of the scientist is to inform us truly about such matters, to give us reliable information as to what occurs under what conditions. We need such knowledge to determine correctly our expectations. Because to believe is so easy, and because our wishes so easily compel our beliefs, we need persons with special training, special methods, special caution to examine the evidence for our beliefs, and to give us sound data upon which to build new beliefs. Science lends a note of intellectual asceticism to our beliefs; as scientists we rein our preferences and plan-making, and pause for a moment before evidence. We ask the scientist to give us warranted statements, not to tell  

# A Primer of Semantics  

us what to like to dislike, or what to do. We may be stirred by what he says but we do not ask him to say it stirringly. We expect him to prune his language, to adapt it to his unique task of giving us "the facts." We want his statements designatively precise, accurate, reliable, cold—just because life is so warm.  

Not so with art and the artist. The talk of paintings, novels, poetry, music, the dance, the theatre is slanted, biased, un-neutral. It may be warmly or coldly for something, or warmly or coldly against it, but in any case it is for or against. The language is highly appraisive, and plays on our likes and dislikes. Appraisive of anything whatsoever, from dimples to deeds to death. Filled with the likes and dislikes of the artist, filled with himself, filled with ourselves. The artist may and does make statements, may even include statements of science among his means. But we go to him not primarily for his statements but for his appraisals. Partly of course to find an expression of our individual likes and dislikes—the pessimists will linger longest among the poets of despair, and the optimists among the poets of affirmation. But partly to sample alien and strange likes and dislikes, to try out via the artist's signs new ways of being biased. For the high mission of the artist is to explore novel ways of being for and against, and to let us share his explorations through the specialized language which he has created. In this way we live vicariously, seeing things as others have seen them, standing as they stood before things, and falling as they fell. And in so living vicariously we enjoy our characteristic appraisals, test them, gain material for their transformation, perhaps repudiate them. That is why we honor the artist for his work as we honor the scientist for his. We do not choose between them because we need them both.  

But at times we must decide to do something—or do nothing.  

ing. Having learned what we may expect, made our commitments and chosen sides, we must play the game. And here too signs suggest the answers. There are specialized signs for prescribing what precisely we are to do, the language of the ought, the language of imperative tone. The most comprehensive form of this language occurs in the religions, most comprehensive because the religions prescribe an overall pattern for our lives, a path to follow to the end. Just as the artist informs as well as appraises, so the religious prophet appraises as well as prescribes. He sets before us in his words and in his life an ideal of selfhood. But he does more. He tells us by word and deed how to realize this ideal; he prescribes a technique for living. Become such and such a kind of person, and become it in such and such a way: this is the religious imperative.  

The religions speak in commandments, and their commands vary with the personality ideals they proclaim as good. But they all tell us how the burden of the complex self may be carried, and lost. The ways of salvation are ways of annihilation, ways of using up our lives. We turn to the prophets for hints of an appropriate ideal for our ultimate allegiance and for instructions as to how we may attain the self we finally choose to become. As we listen to them we try out symbolically possible costumes of selfhood. We may or may not find the one that fits us well. Our individual differences work here as they do in our reactions to art. But the prophets give us material for our widest orientation and our total integration. We select and reject; but we are grateful. Rejections are as basic to life as acceptances. They are the heads and the tails of the coin of choice. We honor the prophet even when we reject him. For we need him in the making of ourselves, need him as we need the scientist and the artist.  

# Pitfalls  

Signs are sign-posts, oases, and springboards. They point out what things are where, they allow us to delight in our achievements and aspirations, they fling us into the wide sea of endeavor. They come upon us from everywhere. From the words of other persons, from our non-human environment, from the monuments of our culture, from every nook and cranny of our bodies. We are in a sense always reading—reading persons, reading things, reading books, reading ourselves. Signs press upon every phase of ourselves, checking some motivations and releasing others, influencing our opinions, slanting our likes and dislikes, coloring our attitude to ourselves, inciting us to one course of action rather than another. They intervene between almost every human need and its satisfaction.  

Yet the process is not one-way, not alone from outward to inward. If we are pressed upon by signs we also press upon signs. If signs sometimes serve to drive us mad by their pressure they are also tools for relieving our anxieties, tools for a greater sanity. If they are ropes which bind us they are also knives to cut to freedom.  

The point is to master signs instead of being mastered by them. We do this by knowing about them. We ascend to higher levels of language and talk about talking itself. We stand at our own center, and demand of signs that they show their credentials. We avoid being taken in by giving out. In this way we work upon signs through other signs. We sharpen our tool of tools.  

Yet the pitfalls of signs are numerous, easy to discern but hard to avoid.  

There is the Pitfall of Over-Generalization. To generalize  

is to say something that applies more than once. It is easy to generalize, necessary in the economy of thought, but fraught with peril. Seductively simple to go from "this" to "some" to "most" to "all." Perilous if (but only if) we omit the qualifying conditions. "Men are more straightforward than women"—instead of "Men of such and such a sort under such and such cultural conditions are more straightforward than such and such women under such conditions." "Buddhism is the best religion"—instead of "Buddhism is for certain persons under certain historical and cultural conditions the best religious alternative." "Men of x inches in height should weigh y pounds"—instead of "Men of such and such bodily build in such and such a society average y pounds and should for most purposes keep their weight in the neighborhood of y pounds."  

It is hard to find, and to keep in mind, the qualifications required for sound generalization. The refinement of knowledge is in large part the finding of such qualifications, and accurate knowledge is as difficult as it is rare. That is why we have science. And why Whitehead's advice should be pinned on our walls: "Seek simplicity, but distrust it." But it is also hard to avoid Undue Generalization because we bludgeon others by our generalizations; we keep silent on the qualifications because to admit them would weaken our case. If we want to make all men Buddhists we shall hardly qualify our appraisal of Buddhism as "the best religion." The sins of our generalizations reflect our general sinfulness. It is well to remember this in our statements. And for the statements of others, this motto is good: "Listen to their generalizations—but qualify them." Unless you give out countersigns, you will be taken in by signs. Hypnotism supplies the evidence.  

Then there is the Pitfall of Perfect Communication. Be  

cause other persons make the same sounds or write the same words that we do we assume that what they signify to them is exactly what they signify to us. We fail to realize that communication is a matter of degree. It is true that most words in a language have a common core of meaning for those who share the language; if this is not true there is in fact no language. But a common core is compatible with different fringes. Not all blondes dress alike. Not all who use the words "democracy," "freedom," "liberalism," "communism," "fascism," mean exactly the same thing by these words; and in some cases the common core of meaning is very small indeed. If "democracy," for instance, stands for the sum total of ways Americans now behave, then to advocate any change in these ways of acting is to oppose democracy; but if "democracy" stands for a certain ideal that is partly realized and partly unrealized, then those who advocate certain changes are the friends of democracy while those who oppose any change are its enemies. If two persons used this term in these different ways, and each assumed Perfect Communication, they would be talking at cross purposes and without mutual understanding. Each would be for democracy in one sense of the term and against it in the other. A group of clergymen not long ago battled several days over whether the leaders of their meeting were or were not Communists. It took two days to find out they meant different things by the term. They never got to the problems that had provoked the meeting. Perhaps some of them did not want to. For we always use the good words for our friends and the bad words for our enemies.  

This pit is deep. It is sometimes said that education is at fault, that we must all be given identical meanings so that communication will be perfect. But this is too simple in theory and too hard in practice. Persons of different temperaments  

# A Primer of Semantics  

and different experiences inevitably develop different fringe meanings for their words. "Sociability" will become a positively appraisive term for the soft rounded endomorph and negatively appraisive for the lean fragile ectomorph; or if this does not occur, the forms of sociability approved by the one will be different from the forms of sociability approved by the other. Education cannot stop this growth and variation of meaning. What it could do is to develop techniques by which we can find out in a given discussion what someone does mean by the terms he uses, and techniques by which we can in a given discussion make clear what we ourselves mean. If we concentrate on how to improve each instance of communication we need not worry so much about the differences and changes of meaning. One device is to give concrete illustrations of what one is talking about—instances of a democratic society, instances of a free man, instances of a liberal society, instances of a Communist. And demand of one's opponent in the boxing-ring of discussion similar concrete instances. It would be even better in discussions to lay aside all Great Words. But that is perhaps asking too much of human nature—under present historical conditions.  

A third major pitfall is Gullibility. We are gullible before the signs of others, and gullible-plus before our own signs. Signs dispose us to act in certain ways, and if we are not on our guard they jerk us into puppet-action when they appear. We are told that war is inevitable because human nature is unchangeable; we nod in assent and prepare our youngsters for the cannon. We are told that we are queer; and we stick out a puppet-tongue at our own uniqueness. We are told that we ought to be fatter or slimmer or stronger; and we worry ourselves into the offered coat even if it is a plaster cast. But above all we are gullible to our own remarks. For most of our lives  

are spent in trying to keep a high opinion of ourselves. We do this in amazing ways. We almost break an arm to pat ourselves on the back. There is hardly a thing we say that is not aimed at signifying ourselves in a good light. Since we are often afraid to meet ourselves, afraid we will disturb our precariously attained equilibrium, we fall hard for every good thing we manage to say about ourselves. And so remain stalemated and unachieved.  

The antidote to the poison of Gullibility is evidence. We must inquire into the reliability of what is said, assess appraisals in terms of actual needs, demand that prescriptions fit the persons prescribed for. The comfortable security that will warm the endomorph will incline the mesomorph to manic outbursts; and the weights that the mesomorphs lift with delight will break the spirit—if not the back—of the extreme ectomorph. Openness to evidence requires, however, flexibility in ourselves, courage to delay commitments, knowledge of individual differences, active scrutiny of signs. The process is circular. Only as we lift the masks of signs can we lift the masks of ourselves. But only as we grow into what we deeply are, and cast off false images of ourself, can we become puppets and not puppets in the theatre of signs. Each step taken in one direction frees the other foot for its step forward. This is the way we move, and the only way.  

# The Dynamics of Ideas  

The human cousin of the apes talks a lot, and in talking lays monkey-traps for himself. But he can also talk himself into ways out of them. And into other things. Into cities like New York, or monasteries high in the Hindu Kush; into gigantic wars or consumers' cooperatives; into jet-planes or cameras which stop motion; into the rough togs of the mountain  

# A Primer of Semantics  

eer or the sleek perfumed slimness of night-club Eve; into Stravinsky's Rite of Spring or Bach's Mass in B-Minor; into the planned cruelty of sadistic torture or the deliberate construction of untried mathematical systems. The ways from the body's substructures to the superstructures of historical man are fantastically numerous and complex. But they all pass through the crossroads of talk.  

For the self's superstructure is built on the framework of ideas. And the large ideas come through talking, talking to others in the first place, talking then to oneself, until finally events in the self and objects in the world take on, as post-language signs, meanings which they otherwise would not have. There arise in this way thinking persons and patterns of culture, the inward and the outward man, each endlessly transforming the other.  

It is important to see the central role which ideas have in the development of the human self and society. If times before ours have overstressed the importance of ideas, recent emphasis upon irrationalism and determinism and sin too easily belittles them. The production of the atom bomb is a large enough event to correct the picture. For the production of atomic energy was impossible until men had thought in certain ways and verified their thoughts. Thought piled on thought, junk-piles of discarded thoughts, a few thoughts standing firm and suggesting new thoughts, a network of thoughts stretching over centuries of thinking men and women—surely this is more amazing than the energy output of the bomb itself. And without this thought no bomb. And with it the bomb and incredible energy sources. The tactics of war have changed and new social institutions become necessary. Every ideal must now feel the impact of these ideas. Men could blow the earth to bits if they wished. Or build a  

society such as never has appeared on the earth. All because of ideas. Ideas are the atom bombs of human culture. And ideas come from thinking-talking-writing persons.  

The idea of atomic energy is simply a dramatic instance of what has always occurred. Ideas of planting crops, of domesticating animals, of making fire were equally momentous. Men moved from one region of the earth partly because they had ideas that there were other regions; Columbus sailed west because of the idea that the earth was round; we take to the air because of ideas our ancestors gained about the flight of birds. No insight is possible into the ways of man that leaves out his ideas. And a science of man which is aware of the role of signs in human history must be cautious in its large predictions. For it cannot tell in advance what ideas men are yet to think. And so not what men are yet to be.  

Not much is known about the appearance of new ideas. As the science of signs develops we can expect growing insight into the process. A new idea involves the production of a new sign. The signs which a person produces are parts of his behavior. Because words about food have been trained into his food-seeking activity, he tends when seeking food to produce signs of food. The way we talk is bent according to our needs. We talk about food because of hunger; we talk about cancer because we wish to avoid it in ourself and in others. How we talk is largely limited by the signs available in our community; our talk is for the most part socially stereotyped; our ideas must utilize the ideas already available.  

But language leaves open the possibility of novel combination of signs, and because our urges are many and our tendencies to action complex, we occasionally produce a number of signs in a novel combination, and so a new idea. If this idea gets by the protective defenses of the self and society, and  

sustains itself in the face of evidence, it is then itself a factor which can enter into new combinations. And so on and on. In some such way ideas accumulate, fertilize, engender new offspring, much as parents make surprising children, or chemical elements compound with novel properties.  

Since ideas are so dependent on language and its products, and since all sorts of people can be trained to talk, ideas do not belong to any one kind of person. There are geniuses and nit-wits among endomorphs and mesomorphs and ectomorphs alike. The best advice to all of them is to try out novel combinations of such ideas as they have available—to become chemists experimenting with sign compounds. In this way they combine their tendencies to behavior in novel ways. In experimenting with signs they are experimenting with themselves. But here again we meet with circular processes. For the anxious and inflexible self fears new ideas because it fears itself. Only the self that is willing to dare change can think creatively. Once more we find ourselves forced to assume responsibility for ourselves. Knowledge of signs helps, but it is not enough. The burden of the ideal cannot be evaded.  

# The Dynamics of Ideals  

Ideas are hard to come by. But they do come, and they explode on our ideals. Sometimes with a greater impact than the bomb on Hiroshima. This bomb in fact exploded on mankind, and its long range effect on ourselves has hardly yet begun to be felt. Where is the corresponding atomic bomb of the new ideal? Our ideas are doing better than our ideals.  

An ideal has as its core an idea. That is why a change in ideas always involves some reconstruction of ideals. But an ideal differs from an idea in that something is not merely signified but is valued and sought for. An ideal is a lure: an idea  

of something which the person who has the idea seeks to realize, to attain, to hold in being, or to bring into being. The sign which signifies an ideal is usually a prescriptive sign and incitive to action; it does not merely designate what we shall encounter under certain conditions or merely appraise certain things as good. The language of the ideal is imperative; it commands that certain designated conditions which are appraised as good be brought about by endeavor. The ideal prescribed may be a physical condition or a kind of personality or a form of social organization. It may be humble or grandiose. But it is demanding.  

It is easy to see why a change in ideas affects ideals. A new idea that is believed becomes another nucleus for ideals. We now know that atomic energy is available in unlimited quantities. We then have to ask ourselves whether we want to liberate such energy and for what purposes. In doing this our former ideals are brought to court, for decisions affect each other. The old ideals may stand, but they are certain to feel the ordeal of the court. They are modified in subtle ways as they are worked for in terms of the new resources. The new idea affects old ideals in another way: by modifying our beliefs in the ideas which stood at the core of the old ideals. If the former ideas seem less or more reliable the ideals built around them become less or more compelling. The new idea affects old ideals in still another way: if we believe in an idea and act upon it we shall be changed somewhat, and ideals which were lures to the former state of the self may lose their attraction for the changed self.  

Ideals of course protect themselves as best they can—which means we protect our former self as best we can. We resist the ideas which might bear on our previous ideals, and we resist change in our ideals as long as we can. But new ideas seep in,  

and our former allegiances grow stronger or are weakened. Ideas warranted by evidence force us in time to become up to date—or to become relics. The idea of atomic energy shakes a big stick. The chemical metaphor of sign-compounds applies to ideals as well as to ideas, for ideas are the core of ideals, and both ideas and ideals are carried by signs. Novel combinations of ideals have novel results.  

Individual differences show themselves in the acceptance of ideals even more clearly than in the acceptance of ideas. Endomorphs, mesomorphs, and ectomorphs differ somewhat in their openness to a given idea, but they differ even more in their openness to a stated ideal. Evidence in time goes a long way to force belief; commitment is more recalcitrant. That men can tap energy by atomic fission will hardly now be doubted by anyone, whatever his physique, temperament, or character. But whether this is good or bad, or whether it is better to use this energy one way or another, is a different story. For as persons differ their needs differ, and a situation that lures one man leaves another woman indifferent. This is as it should be. Provided of course that there can be enough agreement on ideals to carry on.  

This brings us back to our central theme, ourselves. What is to be the master personality ideal which each of us, as an autonomous and unique individual, is to choose for the integration and orientation of our own life? What is to be the master social ideal for our epoch which will permit us to make our own lives and yet give integration and orientation to the American community into which we were born, and to the earth community which we must next bring to birth?  

We return to our career of man-making. How shall we talk to ourselves about ourselves and about society? What are the new life-symbols? What are to be our new Big Words?  

# Ways to Live  

B RISK EARLY DECEMBER. SNOW REPORTED ON the high peaks. Christmas carols are already heard on the radio's fanfare. It is good to recall that there are high peaks, and that men have lived by and died for high ideals. A good time for clarifying and planning our lives.  

Men have long pondered on the question of how to live. For ages they have asked themselves what they should become and how they might become what they choose to be. It is wisdom to listen to what they have said, as material for our own decisions in our own day.  

Let us begin by a confession to ourselves. We are in private and we can be honest. How, Reader, would you really like to live?  

You can tell yourself on the following document. It will involve some paper and pencil work for you but it is safe to predict that you have never revealed yourself this way before. The quarry you will be after will be much more than "aptitudes," and all that stands between you and an exciting chase after important self-knowledge is that common ailment which the humorist Robert Benchley called "persistent inertia."  

INSTRUCTIONS: Below are described thirteen ways to live which various persons at various times have advocated and followed.  

Indicate by numbers which you are to write in the margin  

how much you yourself like or dislike each of them. Do them in order.  

Remember that it is not a question of what kind of life you now lead, or the kind of life you think it prudent to live in our society, or the kind of life you think good for other persons, but simply the kind of life you personally would like to live.  

Use the following scale of numbers, placing one of them in the margin alongside each of the ways to live:  

7 I like it very much
6 I like it quite a lot
5 I like it slightly
4 I am indifferent to it
3 I dislike it slightly
2 I dislike it quite a lot
1 I dislike it very much  

PATH 1. In this "design for living" the individual actively participates in the social life of his community, not to change it primarily, but to understand, appreciate, and preserve the best that man has attained. Excessive desires should be avoided and moderation sought. One wants the good things of life but in an orderly way. Life is to have clarity, balance, refinement, control. Vulgarity, great enthusiasm, irrational behavior, impatience, indulgence are to be avoided. Friendship is to be esteemed but not easy intimacy with many people. Life is to have discipline, intelligibility, good manners, predictability. Social changes are to be made slowly and carefully, so that what has been achieved in human culture is not lost. The individual should be active physically and socially, but not in a hectic or radical way. Restraint and intelligence should give order to an active life.  

PATH 2. The individual should for the most part "go it alone," assuring himself of privacy in living quarters, having much time to himself, attempting to control his own life. One should stress self-sufficiency, reflection and meditation, knowledge of himself. The direction of interest should be away from intimate associations with social groups, and away from the physical manipulation of objects or attempts at control of the physical environment. One should aim to simplify one's external life, to moderate those desires whose satisfaction is dependent upon physical and social forces outside of oneself, and to concentrate attention upon the refinement, clarification, and self-direction of one's self. Not much can be done or is to be gained by "living outwardly." One must avoid dependence upon persons or things; the center of life should be found within oneself.  

PATH 3. This way of life makes central the sympathetic concern for other persons. Affection should be the main thing in life, affection that is free from all traces of the imposition of oneself upon others or of using others for one's own purposes. Greed in possessions, emphasis on sexual passion, the search for power over persons and things, excessive emphasis upon intellect, and undue concern for oneself are to be avoided. For these things hinder the sympathetic love among persons which alone gives significance to life. If we are aggressive we block our receptivity to the personal forces upon which we are dependent for genuine personal growth. One should accordingly purify oneself, restrain one's self-assertiveness, and become receptive, appreciative, and helpful with respect to other persons.  

PATH 4. Life is something to be enjoyed—sensuously enjoyed, enjoyed with relish and abandonment. The aim in life should not be to control the course of the world or society or the lives of others, but to be open and receptive to things and  

persons, and to delight in them. Life is more a festival than a workshop or a school for moral discipline. To let oneself go, to let things and persons affect oneself, is more important than to do—or to do good. Such enjoyment, however, requires that one be self-centered enough to be keenly aware of what is happening and free for new happenings. So one should avoid entanglements, should not be too dependent on particular people or things, should not be self-sacrificing; one should be alone a lot, should have time for meditation and awareness of oneself. Solitude and sociality together are both necessary in the good life.  

PATH 5. A person should not hold on to himself, withdraw from people, keep aloof and self-centered. Rather merge one-self with a social group, enjoy cooperation and companionship, join with others in resolute activity for the realization of common goals. Persons are social and persons are active; life should merge energetic group activity and cooperative group enjoyment. Meditation, restraint, concern for one's self-sufficiency, abstract intellectuality, solitude, stress on one's possessions all cut the roots which bind persons together. One should live outwardly with gusto, enjoying the good things of life, working with others to secure the things which make possible a pleasant and energetic social life. Those who oppose this ideal are not to be dealt with too tenderly. Life can't be too fastidious.  

PATH 6. Life continually tends to stagnate, to become "comfortable," to become "sicklied o'er with the pale cast of thought." Against these tendencies, a person must stress the need of constant activity—physical action, adventure, the realistic solution of specific problems as they appear, the improvement of techniques for controlling the world and society. Man's future depends primarily on what he does, not on  

what he feels or on his speculations. New problems constantly arise and always will arise. Improvements must always be made if man is to progress. We can't just follow the past or dream of what the future might be. We have to work resolutely and continually if control is to be gained over the forces which threaten us. Man should rely on technical advances made possible by scientific knowledge. He should find his goal in the solution of his problems. The good is the enemy of the better.  

PATH 7. We should at various times and in various ways accept something from all other paths of life, but give no one our exclusive allegiance. At one moment one of them is the more appropriate; at another moment another is the most appropriate. Life should contain enjoyment and action and contemplation in about equal amounts. When either is carried to extremes we lose something important for our life. So we must cultivate flexibility, admit diversity in ourselves, accept the tension which this diversity produces, find a place for detachment in the midst of enjoyment and activity. The goal of life is found in the dynamic integration of enjoyment, action, and contemplation, and so in the dynamic interaction of the various paths of life. One should use all of them in building a life, and no one alone.  

PATH 8. Enjoyment should be the keynote of life. Not the hectic search for intense and exciting pleasures, but the enjoyment of the simple and easily obtainable pleasures: the pleasures of just existing, of savory food, of comfortable surroundings, of talking with friends, of rest and relaxation. A home that is warm and comfortable, chairs and a bed that are soft, a kitchen well-stocked with food, a door open to the entrance of friends—this is the place to live. Body at ease, relaxed, calm in its movements, not hurried, breath slow, willing to nod and  

to rest, grateful to the world that is its food—so should the body be. Driving ambition and the fanaticism of ascetic ideals are the signs of discontented people who have lost the capacity to float in the stream of simple, carefree, wholesome enjoyment.  

PATH 9. Receptivity should be the keynote of life. The good things of life come of their own accord, and come unsought. They cannot be found by resolute action. They cannot be found in the indulgence of the sensuous desires of the body. They cannot be gathered by participation in the turmoil of social life. They cannot be given to others by attempts to be helpful. They cannot be garnered by hard thinking. Rather do they come unsought when the bars of the self are down. When the self has ceased to make demands and waits in quiet receptivity, it becomes open to the powers which nourish it and work through it; and sustained by these powers it knows joy and peace. To sit alone under the trees and the sky, open to nature's voices, calm and receptive, then can the wisdom from without come within.  

PATH 10. Self-control should be the keynote of life. Not the easy self-control which retreats from the world, but the vigilant, stern, manly control of a self which lives in the world, and knows the strength of the world and the limits of human power. The good life is rationally directed and holds firm to high ideals. It is not bent by the seductive voices of comfort and desire. It does not expect social utopias. It is distrustful of final victories. Too much cannot be expected. Yet one can with vigilance hold firm the reins to his self, control his unruly impulses, understand his place in the world, guide his actions by reason, maintain his self-reliant independence. And in this way, though he finally perish, man can keep his human dignity and respect, and die with cosmic good manners.  

PATH 11. The contemplative life is the good life. The external world is no fit habitat for man. It is too big, too cold, too pressing. Rather it is the life turned inward that is rewarding. The rich internal world of ideals, of sensitive feelings, of reverie, of self-knowledge is man's true home. By the cultivation of the self within, man alone becomes human. Only then does there arise deep sympathy with all that lives, an understanding of the suffering inherent in life, a realization of the futility of aggressive action, the attainment of contemplative joy. Conceit then falls away and austerity is dissolved. In giving up the world one finds the larger and finer sea of the inner self.  

PATH 12. The use of the body's energy is the secret of a rewarding life. The hands need material to make into something: lumber and stone for building, food to harvest, clay to mold. The muscles are alive to joy only in action, in climbing, running, skiing and the like. Life finds its zest in overcoming, dominating, conquering some obstacle. It is the active deed which is satisfying, the deed adequate to the present, the daring and adventuresome deed. Not in cautious foresight, not in relaxed ease does life attain completion. Outward energetic action, the excitement of power in the tangible present—this is the way to live.  

PATH 13. A person should let himself be used. Used by other persons in their growth, used by the great objective purposes in the universe which silently and irresistibly achieve their goal. For persons and the world's purposes are dependable at heart, and can be trusted. One should be humble, constant, faithful, uninsistent. Grateful for the affection and protection which one needs, but undemanding. Close to persons and to nature, and secure because close. Nourishing the good by devotion and sustained by the good because of devotion. One should be a serene, confident, quiet vessel and instrument of  

the great dependable powers which move to their fulfillment.  

INSTRUCTIONS FOR RANKING YOUR PREFER-ENCES: Rank the thirteen ways to live in the order you prefer them, putting first the number of the way to live you like the best, then the number of the way to live you like next best, and so on down to the number of the way to live you like the least.  

# Patterns of Value  

By this time you should be filled with questions. Especially if you have asked your friends to make their confessions, and compared their answers with your own. Why do some schemes for living appeal to you and others repel you? Are some choices right and some wrong? Do you actually live as you think you would like to live—and if not, why not? Have persons a right to live as they would like to live? If they have, can we avoid social anarchy?  

Before we move on to such disturbing questions, let us note a few points about the document we have just answered. It was not compiled at random. It includes the main ways which the historical religions and ethical systems have told us that we ought to live, and it contains less familiar alternatives. My book Paths of Life was a study of the first seven alternatives. The other six have been added so that we might cast a larger net. Some of the thirteen alternatives are more important than others. But between them they catch the main human preferences and commitments. They express the patterns of value in which men and women have argued, fought, lived, and died.  

Way 1, for instance, embodies the emphasis upon the preservation of what mankind has already attained that is found in the Greek religion of Apollo and in Chinese Confucianism. Way 2 records the emphasis of Buddhism upon the simplifica  

tion of the self and the overcoming of desires by self-knowledge. Way 3 stresses Christ's emphasis upon sympathetic and helpful love for other persons. Way 4 corresponds to the accent of the Greek Dionysian religion upon festive abandonment and rejuvenation of the self. Way 5 repeats Mohammed's call to the believers to band together against the unbelievers in the attainment of their corporate goal. Way 6 issues the call of Prometheus and the Persian Zoroaster for man to assume the initiative in the struggle against evil by enlisting scientific foresight supplemented by technological skill. Way 7, to be called the Maitreyan Way, we shall leave for separate discussion. Way 8 embodies certain features of the Epicurean preference for the simple unsophisticated pleasures. Way 9 expresses the Taoist counsel of non-aggressive receptivity before the cosmic powers. Way 10 reflects the Stoical attitude of doing what one can without expecting very much. Way 11 stresses meditation, Way 12 physical activity, Way 13 letting oneself be used as an instrument of forces other than oneself. The fact that it is not easy to find historical names for these last three attitudes suggests that they are more components of various ways of life than complete alternatives for living.  

These various patterns of value have found expression in the art and literature of the world. Many of them have found embodiment in social institutions—in churches, in educational systems, in forms of government. These institutions have in the course of time often modified the ideals they expressed, stretched them, even emphasized under old names ideals contrary to those which gave them birth. But our present quest is for our own ideal, not for the history of ideals. So we must consider the Ways on their own right, in terms not of institutions but of our selves. They demand of us to be various kinds of persons. In discovering which of them we and others  

favor we discover what kind of persons we want to be, and what kind of ideals are at work in our society.  

# A Testimony of American Youth  

Let us begin by seeing how other Americans would like to live. We shall consider the reactions of almost a thousand young people in colleges throughout the country—colleges in New York, Minnesota, Chicago, Alabama, and California. The number of them per hundred that gave first choices to each of the thirteen alternatives is as follows:  

Way 1 — 17 ("nothing in excess")
Way 2 — 1 ("independent of persons and things")
Way 3 — 4 ("sympathetic concern for others")
Way 4 — 3$\frac{1}{2}$ ("festivity and solitude in alternation")
Way 5 — 5 ("group activity, group enjoyment")
Way 6 — 7 ("man the eternal maker and re-maker")
Way 7 — 40 ("dynamic integration of diversity")
Way 8 — 10 ("carefree wholesome enjoyment")
Way 9 — 1 ("wait in quiet receptivity")
Way 10 — 4 ("vigilant manly self-control")
Way 11 — 1 ("meditation on the inner self")
Way 12 — 5 ("active, daring, adventuresome deeds")
Way 13 — 1$\frac{1}{2}$ ("let yourself be used")  

In considering these results we must be careful of the pitfall of overgeneralization. We cannot say too confidently that they give the exact value profile of America as a whole, or even of American youth. The subjects were primarily young people in the larger colleges, and so mainly selected from persons able to pay the price of such education in terms of time and money. And while some similar data on older persons do  

# Ways to Live  

not indicate any great differences in choice between them and younger persons, the data are not extensive enough to allow us to be sure of this. So what we have is a testimony from some thousand young people in larger colleges, no more, and no less.  

The results are partly such as any of us would guess, but they deal us some surprises. It is not news to hear that the students in our larger colleges generally turned thumbs down on all admonitions to renounce the world by retiring into themselves. Few first votes went to the cultivation of the inner man. And few to doctrines which call upon the individual to be receptive, to let things and persons work upon him and through him. Passivity and inwardness are not in favor. Ways 2, 9, 11, 13 between them gathered less than five first choices in a hundred. Most of our young people—but not all—wish very decidedly to be in and of the world.  

But they wish to be purposefully active in the world, and at their own center as fountainheads. Ways 3, 4, 5, 10, and 12 together are chosen only by 22 persons out of a hundred, and no one of them is given more than five first choices in a hundred. One of these alternatives enjoins sympathetic concern for others as the guiding motive in life; another advocates a somewhat Bohemian attitude of unentangling festivity; still another counsels the individual to whole-hearted mergence with the community for the resolute advancement of its purposes; a fourth advises the stocial attitude; the fifth celebrates the virtue of physical activity. These USA youth do not wish in great numbers merely to climb mountains, or to help others, or to advance society, or to eat from the tree of life cautiously or casually.  

Where then do the main yeas fall? Three familiar alternatives (Ways 1, 6, and 8, with thirty-three first choices out of  

a hundred) stand out at once, old friends that almost seem to be all of us. One is, in the best sense of the word, the conservative attitude: its motto is nothing in excess; its voice is that of the genteel tradition. This wisdom of Apollo is opposed by those Prometheus who believe in the continual transformation of individual and social life; their stress is upon inventiveness, problem-solving, construction. It is significant that this attitude of the innovator is stronger in the western part of the country than in the eastern part. The third familiar voice is that of the Epicureans who find in enjoyment the keynote of life, enjoyment of a comfortable home, savory food, talking with friends, rest and relaxation.  

Conserving, transforming, comfort-loving Americans—are these not ourselves, all of our selves? These are our selves, and they do express the kinds of extroverted active in-the-world-ness with which most of us live our lives. But they are not all of ourselves. At least not if we have kept in step with the younger college generation. For those we caught in our testing net favored Way 7 head and shoulders above the other alternatives. Forty out of every hundred of them gave it first choice, a higher number than those who chose Apollo, Prometheus, and Epicurus taken together. Who is this newcomer in our midst, in our selves?  

# Way 7: Maitreya's Way  

In Paths of Life Way 7 was called the Maitreyan Path (pronounced My-tráy-an). Maitreya was in India's history the name of an enlightened friendly sage who would one day appear on the earth. This name of one-yet-to-come was borrowed because it seemed a fitting symbol for a way of life still struggling for birth, a way of life friendly to personal diversity under which Orient and Occident might find kin  

ship. Our data suggest that Way 7 has the lure for modern man which Paths of Life predicted.  

To get the sense of this attitude to life before us more fully and more concretely, let us consider six sentences chosen out of eighty by our young people as expressing best the kind of person they would like to be. Taken together these constitute a confession of faith of American college youth.  

1. A person should have a sense of humor about himself, a sense of detachment about his fate, yet be able to live outwardly a life rich in enjoyment and activity.  

2. We must cultivate flexibility, many-sidedness, admit diversity in ourselves, and accept the tension which this diversity produces.  

3. Periods of solitude and periods of joyous celebration are both necessary to the good life.  

4. One should be friendly and considerate of other persons, and yet not sacrifice the development of his own unique self.  

5. No scheme for living proposed by the religions and moralities is entirely suitable for every person, yet each scheme can offer something to every one; one should use all of them, and no one alone.  

6. Life should contain enjoyment, action, and contemplation in about equal amounts; the satisfying life is found in their dynamic integration.  

One young American, voting for Way 7, added these words to his reply to our questions:  

The supreme way to live has neither local habitation nor a name. It is identical with every path, yet distinct and detached from all, for it includes, undercuts, transcends, and unifies the thousand and one specific ways. All paths aim at it and adumbrate it, yet it is its own reason for being and becoming. All paths participate in it, yet it is sufficient unto itself. . . . Nor  

is this path a balance, a compromise, between dialectical or conflicting forces. It is instead a dynamic eddy, an interplay, a transformation of the individualities that live within the universe. . . . The balance we seek is that of thoroughgoing unbalance, in which rivers of all speeds and temperaments flow into the sea. If we preserve we must also destroy. If we embrace solitude with one hand, we must likewise love society with the other. If we give we must also receive, and so we must be dealt unto as we in turn deal. If we celebrate, then we must also cerebrate. If we would own and use ourselves, so we must be owned and used by causes and conditions and persons outside us. If we welcome typologies, then we with equal fervor must forsake them for concretions. There are no monopolies in the universe of the Many.  

This strong desire for a flexible and multiple self unified in and through its diversity, suggests that a new personality ideal has formed itself in our midst.  

If this is so, something really important has happened. For it is around new conceptions of what men might be that new religions and new social organizations revolve. Perhaps we are really more interesting, more complex, more conflictful, more dramatic, even more tragic, than we have seemed to ourselves, or have dared to admit. Perhaps the ordinary clichés and stereotypes about America and Americans are faded and out of date. We begin to wonder why we continue to pass ourselves off for less than we are, and why we acquiesce in the monotony and uniformity and sterility which settle down upon us like a dark cloud. Perhaps we are afraid of our resources? Afraid of becoming in fact what we are in promise and in ideal? Or perhaps we have merely been unable so far to make clear to ourselves what we want to be, and that as we do this we shall shake ourselves free from lethargy, and give actuality to aspiration.  

# Who Likes to Live How?  

The question now arises whether a certain kind of person tends to prefer certain kinds of life to others. The various ways to live give outlets to the drives for dependence, domination, and detachment in various degrees and in various combinations. If these drives are, as we supposed, connected with different kinds of physiques, then preferences for the alternative ways to live should be to some extent connected with bodily differences. And this we find in fact to be the case.  

A number of the students participating in the test were somatotyped, most of them by Dr. William H. Sheldon. This means that they were described in terms of how strongly they were endomorphic, mesomorphic, and ectomorphic. From these persons we shall consider four groups—one group extreme in each of these components and low in the others, and one group of about equal strength in the three components. So the four groups are the extreme endomorphs, the extreme mesomorphs, the extreme ectomorphs, and the "center" physiques; together they total 133 persons.  

To see that persons in these groups tend to favor certain ways to live and to reject others, we may put the results in a crude and simple table. "++" shows where a way to live is most favored; "+" shows the second most favored place for an alternative; "—" indicates that the group in question gives no (or very few) first choices to the alternative.  

We can look at this chart in various ways. Read up and down it tells us how a given kind of person likes the various ways to live; read left to right it tells us how a given way of life is regarded by the four groups of persons.  

The extreme endomorph, for instance, likes the festive celebration of Dionysus and the receptivity of Taoism; he may  

<table><thead><tr><th></th><th>Extreme Endomorphs</th><th>Extreme Mesomorphs</th><th>Extreme Ectomorphs</th><th>Center Persons</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><th>Path 2 (Buddha)</th><td>$+$</td><td>$-$</td><td>$++$</td><td>$-$</td></tr><tr><th>Path 3 (Christ)</th><td>$+$</td><td>$-$</td><td>$++$</td><td></td></tr><tr><th>Path 4 (Dionysus)</th><td>$++$</td><td>$-$</td><td></td><td>$+.$</td></tr><tr><th>Path 5 (Mohammed)</th><td>$-$</td><td>$++$</td><td>$-$</td><td>$+$</td></tr><tr><th>Path 6 (Prometheus)</th><td></td><td>$++$</td><td></td><td>$+$</td></tr><tr><th>Path 8 (Epicurus)</th><td></td><td>$++$</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><th>Path 9 (Taoism)</th><td>$++$</td><td>$-$</td><td>$-$</td><td>$-$</td></tr><tr><th>Path 10 (Stoicism)</th><td>$-$</td><td>$-$</td><td>$+$</td><td>$++$</td></tr><tr><th>Path 11 (meditation)</th><td></td><td>$-$</td><td>$++$</td><td></td></tr><tr><th>Path 12 (action)</th><td></td><td>$++$</td><td></td><td></td></tr></tbody></table>  

accept the non-demanding life of Buddha or the sympathetic concern for others of Christ. But stoical aloofness or Mohammed's "holy war" find him unresponsive. He is receptive, dependent in our sense of the term, and not driven by the needs of domination or detachment.  

The extreme mesomorph on the contrary goes all out for the Ways which call for action, power, possessions, domination. He is in the world with a vengeance, and he rejects vigorously all the alternatives which tell him to withdraw into himself or to be receptive to persons and forces other than himself. His picture is startlingly clear.  

Nor can we miss the self-disclosure of the extreme ectomorphs. Thumbs down they say on dependence and mergence with society; but thumbs up for all that protects them and allows them detachment and inwardness. What is meat for the mesomorphs is their poison. They share with the endomorph a hostility to the muscled energy of the mesomorph. But unlike the endomorph they do not feel close to the world. They hold on to themselves. The outgoing Mohammedan or the receptive Taoist does not lure them. They prefer Buddha and Christ, and the sages of the life of meditation.  

The center people are pulled by endomorphy, mesomorphy, and ectomorphy alike. Simplification of the self is hard for them, and so are the extremes of receptivity. Dionysus, Prometheus, and Epicurus make more of an appeal, but the main advocates of these attitudes are found in other groups. It is not easy for the center people to keep themselves together. We are not surprised that they are tempted to be stoical. Perhaps Way 7 can lure them into abundance?  

A word of caution. The +'s in our chart merely indicate what groups most favor a given way of life; they do not indicate that the way of life is strongly favored by the persons in the group, nor even that it is favored more than alternatives that have no + assigned to them. Very few ectomorphs, for instance, choose meditative Way 11; many more of them in fact choose Prómethean Way 6. The ways of Apollo and Maitreya (Ways 1 and 7) make their appeal to all kinds of persons. So while our results show that there is a relation between bodies and choices of ways to live—and so are an independent confirmation of Sheldon's views as to the relation of physique and temperament—they do not negate human variability and plasticity. For we must remember that the physique is only one factor in the development of selfhood. The  

fact that choices of a particular way to live are made most often by persons of a given type of physique does not mean that such a person always makes that choice, or that only such persons choose that way to live. For what a person chooses to be depends not only on his body but on the physical environment, his culture, and on his ideas as well. Here too scientific knowledge does not enslave us but extends our freedom. Our bodies are the agency of our selfhood. They become tyrants only if we try to forget them.  

# Each Person Is Unique  

Individuals differ widely, stubbornly, and importantly. To drive in this point has been one major purpose of this chapter. The other has been to aid the reader in his knowledge of, and his work upon, himself.  

The extent of individual differences has been illustrated by the diversity of reactions to the main ways in which the sages have advised us to live. Every one of these Ways is given first place by some persons and last place by others. The same diversity is found when persons are asked to choose between paintings, or poems, or social organizations, or philosophies. The extent of this diversity comes as a surprise. Over and over again a person being tested has said "No one can really like that picture!" and is baffled when confronted by the evidence that other persons have given it first choice. Not uncommonly the dissipated incredulity is replaced by a low appraisal of such persons. It is hard to get outside the circle of ourselves. Only facts can impress upon us the fact that not all people are created in our own image.  

The stubborn persistence of individual differences is shown in a number of ways. The ratings given to various items by persons do change over an interval of time, but seldom drastically.  

cally. Those who vote at one time for the Buddha Way may later shift their allegiance to Apollo or to Stoicism; they will very rarely worship at the shrine of extroverted Mohammedan Way 5, or a devotee of that shrine change enough to seek admission to a Buddhist monastery. A great many of our traits are primarily due to the society in which we live—the language we speak, the clothes we wear, the possible occupations which we can follow, the social ideal which we accept. But even here our individual differences persist—in the style of our talking, or the way we wear the available clothes, or the energy with which we work, or the eagerness with which we endeavor to translate the socially approved ideal into actuality. The ideal of sympathetic concern for others is impressed upon very many persons in our culture, and this has its effect; yet few choose it as their dominant ideal. One can imagine a society which placed its approval upon running, upon running as much as possible, as far as possible, as fast as possible. In such a society everybody would undoubtedly run. But no one expects that the blue ribbons of social reward would appear equally on endomorphic and mesomorphic chests. The effects of social pressures differ with the individuals upon whom they press.  

Since differences between individuals are profound and persistent they are important. That is why the study of individual differences is becoming a central concern of the science of man. Science is expected to tell us what acts how under what conditions. A science of man must seek to tell us what persons act in what way under what conditions. But it can only do this with some precision if it turns from statements about man in general to the study of individual differences. Roger Williams, in The Human Frontier, has underlined this point effectively.  

We have used the grosser bodily differences between persons to illustrate the same point. Even in such crude terms it is evident that scientific knowledge is possible about persons, some predictability as to how given individuals will react to alternative modes of life. But these particular differences are only a small, though important, part of the story. Differences in size, sex, age, energy, bodily harmony or disharmony, medical history, aptitudes and disabilities, training, achievements and failures are also important; so are cultural differences and the status of the individual in his culture. Only as such differences are studied and taken into account can vague generalities about human behavior be replaced by the increasingly reliable knowledge which we demand of the science of man.  

With such knowledge of individual differences we shall be in a position to build a society adapted to the diversity of needs of diverse persons instead of trying to bake everybody in the same bread pan. Our social responsibilities will confront us head-on at a later stage of our analysis. For the moment we keep our eyes on our responsibilities to ourselves.  

# Insist on Yourself!  

We are each unique even though similar to others in certain respects. The reader, in working through this chapter, has undoubtedly classified himself, linked himself with certain kinds of persons and dissociated himself from others. And within limits, the data permit him to do this. If of the various alternatives he has favored Ways that stress detachment, it is likely that detachment is a strong need in himself, with ectomorphy a prominent trait physically. If he has favored alternatives which the mesomorphs in general go for, it is likely that domination is a powerful drive, with mesomorphy strong. If he has voted for receptive attitudes, it is likely that the need  

of dependence is pushing for satisfaction, and endomorphy reasonably high. We hope he has found some clues as to the relative strength of his three primary needs and the three primary components of his body.  

Indeed, there is no way of life that might not be chosen by any person under certain circumstances. An atomic war which would wipe out most of our people and our industry might make Buddhism or Stoicism much more acceptable to the survivors than it is now. A strong mesomorph forced to inactivity by serious heart trouble may attempt the ways of receptivity. A society in war or a society on the defensive or a minority group whose status is precarious almost inevitably takes on characteristics of the Mohammedan Way, and gains the allegiance of many persons whose bent in other circumstances would be in other directions. A person who is groping may at the moment of a questionnaire wish to try out a manner of living which later, after trial, he will reject.  

Decision occurs in a situation, usually a social situation, and a good decision takes account both of the uniqueness of the person making the decision and the uniqueness of the situation which presents the problem. We have learned in science to  

It is good to use such clues for what they are worth, since the primary task of self-analysis is to find our basic motivations. But they are only clues, and of limited worth—partly because it is so difficult to tell the truth about oneself, even to oneself; partly because we may through social pressures be off the beam of our own true flight; partly because our data show that the variability and plasticity of persons is as real a fact as the tendency of certain kinds of persons to move in certain directions. Many, but not all, mesomorphs choose Ways 5, 6 and 8; of the persons who choose Ways 5, 6 and 8 many are mesomorphs, but not all. And similarly in every other case.  

qualify our predictions by adding a statement of the conditions under which what is predicted will occur, and with what likelihood. We have not learned yet this important lesson with respect to appraisals and prescriptions. We thunder our goods and bads, our oughts and ought nots, as if they had no relation to particular persons in particular dilemmas. But the recognition of individual differences will force us to learn that appraisals and prescriptions, like scientific statements, need qualifications: Good for whom when? Ought to be done by whom for what end under what conditions? To omit qualifications giving the conditions under which statements are true is bad science; to omit the qualifications under which appraisals and prescriptions are advanced is human enough in origin but inhuman in its effects. Since each person is unique each realization of selfhood must be unique.  

The moral, Unique Reader, is that the sages are for your use, not you for theirs. Their words are sign-posts, oases, and springboards for you to follow or spurn. Your primary task in life-making is to satisfy your basic motivations in a way that will permit other persons to satisfy theirs. If your bent fits that of some Wise One you will take his words as yours, and shape your life under their direction. But even then only a direction is indicated, for the detailed working out of a life will still be your task. Your Way must be your own.  

It is the heart of wisdom to go along the lines of your own deepest inclination and strongest aptitudes, to remain true to your own human potential. Your body and your self and your society to date set directions and limitations, perhaps even blind-alleys. They provide material upon which you, the maker, must work. The sages give you hints, but not final resolutions.  

There is always some plasticity in your self and in your  

society: roads for temporary retreat and further advance, possible changes in ideas and ideals, improvements in techniques. Your unique potentialities you must discern as well as you can. You must frame an ideal in which these potentialities will be actualized. You must do what you can under present conditions to realize this ideal. You are still on your own, even though you turn to others for help. As you become what you are at heart you will be able to say with Gerard Manley Hopkins: "What I do is me: for that I came."  

# The Catacombs  

# of the Self  

FULL WINTER HAS FINALLY COME. COLD AND dark. The time of enduring, the time of death and seeming death. Under the snow-covered clumps of grass a few birds remain. An occasional berry keeps intact its flaunt of red. The trees are bare of leaf, and many of the dead among them will not rise. The buds which will become leaves in the new spring are already made. But their time is not yet. Frustration is now their burden, and the endurance of seeming death.  

The self too has its winters, its deaths and seeming deaths. The affirmation which we seek cannot be fatuous. We must deepen and confirm our resolves before the dark powers which challenge us.  

The obstacles to the self's fruition are numerous and persistent. Numerous because the self is interacting at each moment with a complex physical world of changing impact, and interacting at each moment with persons moving along various life-lines. Persistent because solutions appropriate to one stage of life may close the self to what its further growth demands. The good which is a conquest of evil engenders new evil. The warfare of the bright and the dark powers is unceasing. Stagnation is ever present. Winter is ever recurrent. Flexibility is always sought for, attained, lost, regained.  

In analyzing the obstacles to self-making, we shall emphasize in this chapter the interaction of persons. Our relations to persons are of course not the only sources of our dilemmas, since at every moment we live also in a physical environment. Climate presents problems, and the lay of the land, the variations in the food supply, the incidence of accidents and disease, the process of aging add their own. If the body is the primary source of motivations it is also an instrument for their satisfaction. A crippled limb or a weak heart precludes certain actions that the rest of the body may need, and imposes frustrations if alternative instruments of satisfaction cannot be devised. And without techniques for the control of nature the self cannot secure an environment in which it can securely walk to its goals. Health and technology, and so medicine and engineering in all their forms, are elemental requisites in the warfare with the dark powers. If we do not stress them here, it is not because of their unimportance, but because their importance is widely recognized, and their ministries increase.  

The relations between persons, on the contrary, are still a largely unexplored continent. Wisdom here is as meager as the need for it is great. The task is to talk in more concrete terms. We already know from the work of George H. Mead that the body does not become a self except through social interactions. It is only in society that the self acquires a language, and because of a language the ability to take the role of others, to become conscious of itself, to engage in complex thought and action. The psychiatrists are beginning to tell us that personality disturbances are due to difficulties in our personal relations. What we need is more insight into the effects upon specific persons of interactions with other specific persons. We must carry over our previous emphasis upon individual differences into the field of personal relations.  

It is the merit of Sigmund Freud to have brought human frustration into the forefront of our attention, and the ways in which persons react to meet such frustration. Freud was aware both of the biological roots of human motivation and the frequently frustrating impact of society upon man's biological needs. His study of human conflicts was thus bio-social in orientation, though neither the biological nor the social factor was adequately analyzed. Sexuality gave a dramatic and fertile field for the exploration of frustration. The focusing of study upon the family as the matrix for the patterns of frustration and reaction to frustration was brilliant tactics, for it lifted the curtain upon the first scene of the drama of the social career of a human organism. The result was to give the dynamics of human behavior the central place which it now rightly holds in the study of personality disturbance.  

In the development of Freud's insights the tendency, or at least the danger, has been to pull apart the biological and the social poles of his bio-social orientation. In this country the emphasis of many Freudians and post-Freudians has been centered almost exclusively upon difficulties in personal relations as the source of personality disturbances. Thus Karen Horney, in Our Inner Conflicts, makes a footnote bow to the constitutional factors in conflict, but keeps the actor's body off the boards by the remark that we do not have the necessary knowledge of these biological factors.  

This raises at once the question whether Sheldon's analysis of physical differences might not supply the missing element and restore the needed balance. A mergence of Sheldon's emphasis upon constitutional differences with the neo-Freudian emphasis upon interpersonal relations may in fact make possible rapid advance toward a genuine scientific psychiatry. For if the task of a science of man is to tell us what persons  

react in what manner under what circumstances, a scientific psychiatry must tell us what persons develop what personality disturbances under what circumstances. Psychiatry, as part of the science of man, cannot neglect either biological or cultural factors if it is to attain laws applicable to personality disturbances. Until it attains such laws it has not attained the status of a science. A union of the knowledge of constitutional differences with the knowledge which psychiatry has gained of interpersonal relations offers promise for attaining such laws.  

We shall try to look at ourselves in distress in terms both of the organism and its relations with other persons. What we shall say owes much to Dr. William H. Sheldon and Dr. Phyllis Wittman. In conformity with our general point of view, we shall maintain that a person is one agent in the production of his distress. Man as the maker of himself is also in part the maker of his distress. The "insanities" are in fact achievements, ways in which harassed persons have done the best they could to satisfy their needs. If we oppose these constructions it is because they are at best only partial satisfactions, catacombs of the living dead.  

# Family Constellations  

We begin with the family into which a child is born. Sheldon believes that the child's body-type can be "approximately predicted almost from birth," but since he admits that this hypothesis must be further tested, we shall not assume its truth. In any case the child at birth has already grown for nine months, and shows marked physical similarities with certain other infants and marked physical differences from other infants. Some infants are more endomorphic, some more mesomorphic, some more ectomorphic—regardless of how they get that way or whether they stay that way. From the moment of  

its birth the infant's environment includes other persons—persons with their own specific bodies and with their own diverse life histories. A child is not born into a family in general, but into a specific constellation of specific persons. And the resulting frustrations and satisfactions will vary with the infant and with the particular family constellation.  

Philosophers are not expected to know much about babies, and I have no illusions that what I have just said will evoke a revolution in the study of infants. I have had my own laugh at its generality. But the suggestion that individual differences be seriously considered in the study of family life does seem important. For the problems of an ectomorphic youngster in encounter with a mesomorphic father are very different from those that an ectomorphic or endomorphic father would present. And so with differences in the mother, and with differences in brothers and sisters, and uncles and aunts. Psychiatry has not yet taken into account these physical differences in the study of the interpersonal relations of the family group. Unless this is done we shall gain no insight, no laws, as to the different ways children are affected in the family arena. If the bio-social conception of personality is sound it should be applied at the very earliest stages of the self's career.  

The first personal relations of most infants occur within the family group. Here it is that the first frustrations and the first satisfactions occur. Here it is that its biological motivations first learn one form of strategy rather than another. Here it is that some kinds of objects and persons and skills first come to be preferred to others. Here it is that the first language signs are gained. Here it is that the child forms its first momentous appraisals of itself.  

The child responds to complex utterances before he can produce them. He cannot counter effectively the signs he re  

ceives by signs of his own production. He has not the range of experience to check the truth of the words he hears. He is largely at the mercy of the signs he receives. His dispositions are profoundly influenced by these signs—dispositions to believe, dispositions to prefer, dispositions for action. These influences may not be in accordance with his basic needs. What he hears may be merely the biases of a parent who is very unlike himself. But this he cannot yet know. His ideas and his appraisals of himself are first formed on the impact of his parents. How he regards his genitals, what he thinks of his physique, what he regards as success or failure, how he assesses himself, will vary with what he is told about himself, and this will vary with those who do the telling.  

A mother talked to me about her son. The boy had run away from a fashionable school of hale young fellows well met. The father was determined to bring him back, force him "to be a man" by finishing the year of school. After her first few words I hazarded a physical description of the boy and father, as extreme ectomorph in the ring with an extreme mesomorph. And I was right. The boy had always been somewhat solitary, delicate, unaggressive; the father had told him from his youth how weak and unmanly he was, how success demanded that one be "jugular." The father had his way about the return to his preferred school. The boy saw himself through his father's alien eyes. He was in the hands of a psychiatrist within a few months.  

The moral to parents is easy to draw. If they really love their children, they must respect their uniqueness. They can help to supply the conditions under which a child can move toward a life congenial to its own distinctive nature, but they cannot justly under the disguise of love attempt to mold each child into their own image. The tyranny of parenthood is the  

most insidious and the most widespread of the tyrannies. In the name of love it sows the seeds of hate and frustration.  

Those who have crossed the family threshold into the larger world need to remember that what they have learned about the world and themselves from their parents may need correction, that they must now talk in their own idiom about this world and themselves. This will in turn be a boon to the children they themselves may have, or the children of others that they teach in school or church. There is nothing more important than how one talks to a child, especially when one is telling the child about himself. Many a shroud is wound by such talk, or unwound.  

# The Strategies of Frustration  

As the child grows his contacts with persons extend ever more widely beyond the family groups. The bent he has acquired is less subject to drastic change. His particular combination of bodily components, the strategies he has acquired to satisfy his motivations, his pattern of preferences, his beliefs and appraisals of himself are carried over into an ever-widening series of encounters with other persons. Some of these persons are similar in many ways to himself, and some are strikingly different. Different in bodies, strategies, and appraisals. In contact with such persons he will walk on his many legs into a life mixedly full of frustration and satisfaction. He will have inevitably his troubles and his stalemates. And he will work his way out of these as best he can.  

His troubles and stalemates and strategies will vary with what he is and with whom he encounters. The strategies he employs will be successful in various degrees. Those which give a partial satisfaction that blocks the road to fuller satisfaction are called personality disturbances. The milder ones  

are called by the unfortunate name "neuroses"; the severe ones by the equally unfortunate name "psychoses"—unfortunate since neither is more "neural" or "psychological" than the other. So we shall speak mainly of minor and major personality disturbances.  

It is significant that Karen Horney has settled upon three characteristic strategies which occur in various combinations and strengths in the minor personality disturbances. In Our Inner Conflicts these were called "movement toward persons," "movement against persons," "movement away from persons"; in Are You Thinking of Psychoanalysis? they are called submission, aggression, and withdrawal. These terms immediately suggest that these three forms of neurotic behavior correspond to the motivations of dependence, domination, and detachment, and so to the basic bodily components. Submission might well be the neurotic form of dependence, and arise as a strategy for meeting frustrated endomorphic needs; aggression might well be the neurotic form of domination arising from mesomorphic frustration; withdrawal might well be the neurotic form of detachment and a strategy of frustrated ectomorphy. The situation may be similar with respect to what Erich Fromm, in Man For Himself, calls the negative aspects of the receptive, exploitative, and hoarding orientations.  

Might be—but how could we tell? Simply by letting Karen Horney, Erich Fromm, and William Sheldon (and of course those of other psychologic persuasion) each classify in his own terms a number of persons in minor distress, and see what relation, if any, there is between the various classifications. We do not know that the relation would turn out as we have suggested. We have seen, however, that there is a connection between dependence, domination, detachment and types of phy  

siques; we shall see later that there is a similar relation in major personality disturbances. These facts lend plausibility to the hypothesis that the same connection would hold in the lesser disturbances. If this should be true, then the results of the study of neurotic persons in terms of difficulties in their personal relations in a given culture would converge with the results of the study of their bodies. We would begin to know what persons get what neuroses under what conditions.  

Let us suppose a person high in endomorphy is frustrated in the need for a dependable, humanly warm world. Such frustration would be largely due to other persons who did not satisfy this need. It is understandable then that this endomorph in distress would accentuate the techniques of dependence, and seek reassurance and support by becoming humble, ingrating, pleading, "sticky." This strategy may of course work. Whether or not it works depends upon the person on whom it is tried. The strategy may seduce a mesomorph's heart but send an ectomorph scampering away.  

The same general interpretation would apply to cases where normal domination passes into neurotic aggression, or normal detachment passes into neurotic withdrawal. In each case the person in difficulty applies a heightened and extreme form of the strategies most congenial to his nature; in each case whether the strategy works in securing the satisfaction of the underlying motivation depends upon the persons on whom it is tried.  

Persons tend to choose strategies appropriate to themselves, and the success of the strategy depends upon the social situation in which it is applied. It is in this sense that personality disturbances are bio-social. Situations frustrating to one person in a society may not be frustrating to another in that society. Behavior neurotic for one individual in a given society  

may not be neurotic in another. For behavior is neurotic only when its performance prevents the fuller satisfaction of the motivations for whose service it is employed. To call submission, aggression, and withdrawal neurotic means merely that the individual in a given social context persists in an extreme yet relatively unrewarding course of action.  

Any personality disturbance involves a loss of flexibility of the self. The individual resists correction of his strategy because it is the means by which he has found partial satisfaction for his needs, even if this partial satisfaction is only the anticipation of future satisfaction. And since the strategies give some warmth, the self holds on to them, fears to relinquish them, resists an analysis of them by itself or by others. Harassed selves help wrap their own shrouds. They have been driven to such extremes in their encounters with other persons. They have done the best they could under the social circumstances. A science of man could help them to do better.  

# Forms of Conflict  

We have talked so far of the frustration of single needs—such as the need for dependence or domination or detachment. The situation is seldom so simple. Where an individual is fairly high in two or even three of these needs (and most persons are), complications multiply like fleas in the sun. For now the individual has conflicting needs within himself, and more chances to go wrong in his interactions with others.  

The reader cannot fail to have noted some of these tugs of war in his or her own life. Suppose, for instance, the needs of dependence and domination are both strong in you. Then you tend to assert yourself and dominate the roost, but you also wish to be liked, to be secure in affection and comfort. Your problem will depend in part on who else is in the roost.  

You are lucky if he or she gives to your assertive prancings the reply of a warm smile, as an endomorph may well do. But if a mesomorphic companion prefers to fight and withhold affection or an ectomorphic companion prefers to withdraw and so deny satisfaction of your needs for affection and power alike, then the situation calls for a strategy that may be hard for you to concoct. The wish for power is tangled with the wish for affection, and you may tie yourself in knots in your distress. And almost literally. Hysterical tantrums and paralyses are neurotic tactics for controlling others by becoming dependent upon them. They are ways out we would expect persons strong in mesomorphy and endomorphy to use.  

Or take the possible conflict of the need for dependence and the need for detachment. A bothersome problem if it is yours. For the "movement toward people" necessary to call out their affection is opposed by the endeavor to attain the privacy of one's own center, and the "movement away from people" which the need for detachment prompts may frustrate the need for responsive affection. To devise a strategy by which both needs can be met is of course the thing to do. But it may be difficult. And the form of the problem will vary with the other persons in the human equation. A parent or mate bent on domination may make it difficult to satisfy either need; a partner in the social drama motivated by the need for dependence may resent, and so frustrate, your need for detachment; a person with a strong need for being alone may prove a difficult source of nourishment for your need for sustained and dependable affection. If the water gets too deep you may employ the tactics of helplessness, weakness, chronic fatigue, so that others will protect you and comfort you. This is a lure, we suspect, to persons lower in mesomorphy than in endomorphy or ectomorphy.  

A peculiarly difficult stress in the self is that posed by the presence of strong needs for domination and detachment. If this is your nature, you are driven outward to gain control of other things and persons, and yet strong forces in you hold you back, send you inward to yourself, turn you away from the techniques by which power is gained. Each demand in satisfying itself tends to frustrate the other. Persons who wish sustained affection will resent your push and your privacy, persons motivated by power will fight back and your increment of detachment will not help you in the struggle, persons motivated by detachment will slip away from you and deny you the sense of mastery in which you delight. You may try the tricks of compulsive action, doing something over and over again that gives you a little sense of power without requiring you to venture forth—like washing your hands every few minutes, or walking only in some familiar space beyond which you fear to go. These, we suspect, are tricks of the person in whom mesomorphy and ectomorphy are at war.  

All three of these major forms of human conflict beset the person in whom the needs of dependence, domination, and detachment are all fairly strong. This is by no means rare. Most persons have good doses of the three bodily components. If you are such an individual you may well feel like a rider trying to ride three horses going in opposite directions. And indeed you are. For your problem is a compound of all three conflicts we have discussed, and you may resort to all the neurotic tactics in turn. Your danger is fragmentation, free-floating anxiety, dismemberment. You are plagued by three devils instead of one or two. As you appease one, the others sink their prongs into you. And your social partners add their sling of unappreciative darts. The endomorphs may not find you warm enough, the mesomorphs not bold enough, and the ectomorphs not re  

served enough. You may well be a puzzle to yourself. The cuddly kitten in you begins to use its claws, the big gruff bear tries to forget his gruffness in a bowl of porridge, the lone wolf becomes just a lonely wolf. Life for the center physiques is variable and full of tension.  

Such are the four main areas of human conflict. Main and persistent. For they reflect the struggle of underlying human motivations and the basic components in the human body. Most individuals are faced with the resolution of one or more of these conflicts. They provide the plots for the sequence of personal relations which constitute our careers. They give life its color and its earnestness, its occasions for integration and disintegration. There is no likelihood that they will vanish. Nor do we wish that they would.  

Though they present problems, they present no insuperable problems. There are many ways in which each of the conflicts may be resolved. As we come to study the relations between persons in these terms we shall get help as to how the conflicts may be met creatively. The paths of life we have considered are, in fact, answers largely to such conflicts, their suitability varying with the person and the persons with whom one lives. But since these conflicts go to the depth of the human self, they are easy occasions for bungling. The hysterias, the obsessions and compulsions, the neurasthenias are our more minor forms of bungling. The good in them is not good enough. The larger ones are our "psychoses," the major disorders of selfhood. From these the living dead less often rise.  

# Descent Into Hell.  

Trees go down before a great wind according to their constitutions: some break most easily at the top, in some the trunk snaps, others are uprooted and laid prostrate. We too go down  

in the great storms of selfhood according to our bents. Our bodies and our motivations differ, and our psychoses differ accordingly. We even descend into hell in our own ways.  

In some recent papers before the American Psychiatric Association Dr. William H. Sheldon and Dr. Phyllis Wittman have outlined a new approach to the major disorders of self-hood. They have suggested that there are three major forms of psychotic behavior which in varying strengths constitute a psychosis, and they have given evidence that these various combinations tend to go along with corresponding combinations of endomorphy, mesomorphy, and ectomorphy. Dr. Sheldon will discuss this theory in a forthcoming study, Varieties of Delinquent Youth. We shall here draw upon only the material presented in the preliminary reports.  

One type of major disorder of the self is called the manic-depressive (or the cycloid or affective) psychosis. It is characterized by an emphasis on, and at times an alternation between, two exaggerated emotional states: heightened vivacity, excitement, euphoria, or extreme lethargy, depression, self-depreciation. An exaggerated sense of power blows itself off in a futile and ineffective cyclone of action, or a vacuum of exhaustion is filled by an exaggerated sense of futility and unworthiness. These gestures of domination and surrender give only a partial and temporary satisfaction, and their recurrence becomes stereotyped and inflexible. They are overt, ineffective, and strongly symbolic exhibitions that secure neither power nor affection. The persons who adopt these strategies are mainly mesomorphic and endomorphic in varying combinations, but low in ectomorphy.  

Another major disorder goes by the name of paranoia. The paranoiac shows a strange mixture of arrogance and suspicion. The world is signified as more hostile than it is and the self  

as more able than it is. The individual acts the role of a very superior person whom other inferior persons are trying to trip. He is usually on his guard, hovering over situations in which he will not participate, but he may launch out in aggressive and hostile acts. The drives for domination and detachment block each other, and the individual palliates his lack of achievement by laying the blame on other persons than himself, and by signifying himself as a person of superior merit. Partial satisfaction of frustrated needs is gained by these actions and these symbolic devices, and for this reason they are maintained with an incredible tenacity. Confronted with evidence that would correct his statements and self-appraisals, the paranoid counters with new statements which aim to discredit the evidence. It is almost impossible to drive a wedge into his system of beliefs. An inflexible and frustrated self resists tampering with the partially satisfying and sign-sustained tactics it has evolved in its distress. The average physique of these persons is reported as predominantly mesomorphic, with ectomorphy somewhat higher than endomorphy.  

A third disorder is called schizophrenia. Its characteristic feature is reliance upon the strategy of withdrawal. The term schizophrenia covers a variety of phenomena. Since it is a vague term, we will restrict ourselves to one of its varieties, called hebephrenia. The hebephrenic self pulls away from the world, turns inward, drops an iron curtain in front of itself, and becomes inert, unaggressive, energyless, shy, self-conscious, often helpless. Here is detachment carried to its pathic extreme, but in a way which gives a partial satisfaction to the need of dependence. For such a person tends to be cared for either by friends or in the state institutions in which he is the common and the lifelong inhabitant. By his strategy he secures release from competitive struggle, untroubled privacy, de  

pendable care. It is no wonder that this is the major psychosis of our competitive mesomorphic culture. And it is without surprise that we hear that the hebephrenics are on the average very low in mesomorphy, slightly higher in endomorphy, quite high in ectomorphy.  

A fourth group of the living dead combine all of the above psychotic strategies, alternating in affective, paranoiac, and hebephrenic behavior, at times falling into a rigid and inflexible state in which the conflicting powers are helplessly locked. These people are often said to have a mixed-psychosis. The vague term catatonic in some usages seems to name this condition. And the data show that persons in this group tend to be near average strength in all three physical components. The mixed-psychosis is above all the catacomb of the center physiques. Since most of us are center people this particular corner of hell does not seem very far away. No farther away in fact than contemporary America.  

# That the Living Dead May Rise Again  

What are the causes of these various tragedies? That they are not simply inexorable consequences of having a certain kind of body is attested by the fact that many persons with the same kind of bodies do not fall into these catacombs. The hebephrenics are as a group low in mesomorphy, but not all persons low in mesomorphy become hebephrenic. Why do some? Further study may disclose more minute constitutional differences between those who do and those who don't. Diseases and accidents may certainly play a role. Ideas may influence the course of events. And since interactions with other persons is a continuous process, it is certain that what happens in such interactions may be a major factor in determining whether or not a breakdown occurs. Dr. Wittman believes  

that parental over-protection is common in hebephrenia. A person, like a tree, is more liable because of his body to one kind of breakdown rather than another, but whether this breakdown occurs or not is also dependent upon his personal relations, the impact of his physical environment, and upon his ideas of himself.  

It is therefore a basic task of a scientific psychiatry to investigate the various constitutional, environmental, cultural, and semantical conditions under which the minor and the major disturbances of the self occur. If these interrelated factors are studied in this way, general laws of pathic behavior will be obtained. It is not sufficient to isolate the constitution of persons in distress, for other persons with very similar constitutions avoid these catastrophes. It is not sufficient to consider infectious and toxic agents alone, for different bodies react diversely to these agents. It is not sufficient to turn semanticist, for the signs a person employs are symptoms of his distress and not its sole causes. It is not sufficient to consider interpersonal relations alone, for some persons will develop pathic behavior in a social setting which will leave others unaffected. Only by combining these points of view shall we be able to attain scientific laws which state with what probability which persons develop which disturbances under what conditions. And as we gain such knowledge we shall be able to prevent many of these tragedies of selfhood by controlling the conditions under which they would occur, and by warning different kinds of persons of the danger of the techniques they are disposed to use when such conditions appear. Here too the discovery of mechanisms will strengthen freedom's grip. A scientific psychiatry will be a prized instrument in the celestial navigation of the modern self.  

Prevention is a long-range business. Therapy is a demand  

of the day. And the demand is so great and the rewards so lucrative that the therapists of sick selves have little time or incentive to develop a scientific psychiatry. The most that can be said is that the best of them do the best they can. If more knowledge were available they could do better. It is hard to apply effectively a science that does not exist.  

The doctors of personality are themselves persons. Their doctoring is a personal relation, and an enormously important one for the patient. Individual differences operate in this personal relation as in all others. If the patient knew more about them he could pick his doctor more wisely—an extreme ectomorph would think carefully before putting himself in the hands of an extreme mesomorphic practitioner. But since few patients can be competent to make such choices, it is the doctor who must assume the responsibility for knowing individual differences, for recognizing that different selves need different strategies, for avoiding the assumption that his own pattern of life should be taken on by all his patients. What applies to parents and teachers and preachers applies to doctors. The tyranny of the physician's office is as unwelcome as the tyranny of a home or a school or a church.  

The stalemated person needs help. He is wise if he seeks help. Something has gone wrong in his life-making. The strategies he has devised do not work. He senses this, yet he clings to them because they are his own; he fears to relinquish them because he has nothing better to use. He needs to correct his ideas and his appraisals about himself, about other persons, about his strategies. If his shroud is not too tight he is still trying to break the grip of inflexibility and to regain the status of artisan in the making of himself. With fear and trembling he seeks clarification of his main drives and new strategies to give them satisfaction.  

The task of the physician of the self is to help in this process—with fear and trembling. And to use any and all aids he can summon. He can act directly upon the patient's body, or upon his social environment, or upon his designative, ap-praising, and prescriptive signs. Man-acting-to-a-physical-and-social-world-which-is-signified—this is the subject-matter of the science of man, and so the subject-matter of the science of stalemed men. Troubles can arise anywhere in this process, and a multiplicity of techniques may be needed for meeting them. The body is not the whole story, nor the physical environment, nor interpersonal relations, nor semantic failures to "abstract" properly. The healers of the sick need knowledge of constitutional differences, of the press of environments, of the effect of interactions between different kinds of persons, of the role of signs in the genesis and growth and failures of the self. It is the responsibility of a scientific psychiatry to furnish this knowledge. To apply this knowledge so that a particular person in distress can regain his or her self-creativity is the duty and the privilege of the physician of the self.  

# Open Roads and Dead-End Streets  

What is the relation of the major disturbances of selfhood and the major ways of life? An interesting thought looms up before us: Corresponding to the ways to live which offer satisfaction to the fundamental motivations of a given kind of person there are pathic ways to live toward which this person tends if he fails to find adequate satisfaction for these motivations.  

The healthy ways permit the continued growth of the self in a direction which offers it widening satisfaction; the pathetic ways block this ongoing growth since the partial satisfactions which they give are such as to prevent the movement of the self toward a fuller future.  

The healthy ways are open roads, the pathic ways are dead-end streets. The healthy self remains open, the sick self becomes closed. The forms of openness and closure vary with the types of selfhood. But each self at each moment struggles to remain open and tends to become closed. This is the primordial and never-ceasing conflict of good and evil from which no one is exempt.  

It is true that we cannot yet show in detail that each of the healthy ways of life has its pathic mirror-image. But the larger outlines are visible since we know something about the kinds of persons who tend toward each healthy and pathic alternative. The endomorphs who find satisfaction in the Taoist Way 9 are persons who can in distress become the more depressed manic-depressives. The endomorphic mesomorphs who can find relief in the extroverted life of affection and action in Mohammedan Way 5 may under frustration easily assume the more manic forms of manic-depression. The ectomorphic mesomorphs who might move along the Promethean Way 6 may become paranoiac in sickness. The ectomorphs who can find salvation along Buddha's Way 2 may fall into the hebe-phrenic pit which runs beside this road. The center people who are lured by Maitreya's climb to the mount of multiple abundance are in danger of being stranded on the treadmill of the mixed-psychosis. The major personality disturbances are in fact ways of life, pathic parallels to the open roads of open selfhood.  

The common feature in these catacombs of human aspiration is the partial or complete closure of the self. We have given this black power the name of possessiveness. The forms of possessiveness vary with the forms of selfhood. But in every case possessiveness is the tendency of the self to hold on to its present attainments, to remain what it is, to hug what it has. The need for affection becomes constricted to holding on to  

someone who has given affection. The need for domination is narrowed to protecting the power that has been achieved. The need for detachment is reduced to hoarding the grain of former harvests. In each case the self becomes constricted, self-protective, petty, and fearsome.  

The common element of the healthy ways of life is their recognition that possessiveness is their common enemy. The development of strategies to maintain the outward reaches of the self is the task which these ways share. Their tendency to dogmatize, to fossilize, to slip into their unhealthy correlates is their common danger.  

The forms of salvation, we repeat, are forms of annihilation —annihilation of some form of possessiveness by pointing to some open road which the self can henceforth traverse. The self is saved for its walk forward in time by loosening the cramped legs of its immediate actualities. The repudiation of the closed self is made possible by the affirmation of an open self. The narrow self is lost only as an open self is gained. The persistent barrier to this open self is fear. The ways of life are lures to the self to live on the other side of fear.  

To remain open is not to relinquish a direction. An open road still leads somewhere. A wilderness is only an occasion for road-building. The ways of life are ways to life, roads in the wilderness, achievements of daring persons who built themselves beyond possessiveness.  

The struggle of the self to remain open is intense and unceasing. Each new success becomes in turn a new obstacle. The forces of death and near-death are always at hand. Winter always recurs. The black powers are strong. Shrouds are hard to unwind. But the forces of life are enduring, courageous, resourceful. The trees have their buds ready for the spring. There are red berries under the winter snow.  

# The Universe of the Many  

SO FAR THE STRESS HAS BEEN ON DIVERSITY. And so it will remain. But this stress must now be justified, and the fears it awakens must be removed. Is diversity the name of chaos? Can it be shown that a philosophy championing diversity does not issue in a devastating "relativism" or "subjectivism" or "individualism" or "anarchism" which makes social unity impossible? Can it be shown that a coordinating social ideal is possible which will give direction to society in this new period of mankind? Can this be done without denying the many diverse kinds of personality ideals which different selves need because of their differences?  

We shall contend that the ground for a coordinating social ideal lies in the fact that similarity between persons is as genuine and as basic as their differences. To admit differences in some respects does not require us to deny similarities in other respects. A multiverse is still a universe. To stress either unity or difference alone is naive, unwarranted, and disastrous. Different persons can unite on the ideal of a society which protects and serves their differences.  

Whoever they be and wherever they are men and women require air, food, shelter, health, and each other to carry out their purposes. Just how these are required and in what degree  

differs to be sure, and under very special circumstances for very special purposes certain of these things may not be needed. But for the most part they are the large constants of desire. Furthermore, all persons are endomorphic, mesomorphic, and ectomorphic to some degree; all persons are motivated by dependence, domination, and detachment to some extent. Here the differences are greater, but the similarities no less real. Since we are similar in some respects, we can agree on a common social ideal provided this ideal makes a place for our differences. To agree on diversity as an ideal would already be an agreement—and an important one. But this agreement would seem a verbal trick if it were the only common social ideal. Actually we can go much further. The Maitreyan ideal is a personality ideal and not itself the common social ideal we now seek. But a consideration of its appeal and its limitations will serve to start us on our search. For it shows us how unity can embrace diversity.  

Way 1, Apollo's Way, contends with Way 7 for our main allegiance. Its temper is cautious, and its advice moderation. It offers a poised balance without conflict. Way 7, Maitreya's Way, advises us to risk a dynamic and tensioned integration of diversity.  

Way 7 makes a strong appeal to persons reasonably high in the three basic bodily components and the three corresponding motivational needs. And this explains in part the strength of its vote, for the "center people" make up a large proportion of the population—more than half of us are fairly strong in endomorphy, mesomorphy, and ectomorphy alike. The "periphery people"—the extreme endomorph, or mesomorph, or ectomorph, or even persons high in two of these components and low in the third—are in proportion rare. So a way of life appropriate for the center people naturally has a high vote,  

while the ways appropriate for the rarer and more diverse types of persons have each a considerably lower vote.  

Our puzzlement then goes into reverse. The problem is no longer why Way 7 stands so high, but why the ideal of a multiple self integrated in diversity has received no great historic expression. And here the answer seems to be that this ideal, appropriate to many persons in our epoch, has not in the past been feasible. Men had not the knowledge nor the skills nor the social resources to handle their full complexity. It was necessary to experiment first with the simpler, more manageable, more easily discernible forms of selfhood. When the environment is not under control, the environment exercises its own control, limiting in each geographical region the alternatives open to development. When social resources are not abundant, the community is niggardly in the variations it can permit to individuals, and the individual in turn must utilize to the maximum his most obvious aptitudes. The ideal of the abundant self can have a wide appeal only in an abundant society. Only now are the social conditions favorable to Way 7 beginning to appear. Only now can a large number of persons dare to assume the full burden of their complexity.  

The Maitreyan Way does not, however, appeal only to the center people. How is this to be understood? Largely because centeredness is a matter of degree. Everyone is endomorphic, mesomorphic, or ectomorphic to some extent. And this extent makes itself felt. Way 7 offers protection for whatever potentials a person has, and so evokes diversified allegiance.  

But there is more to it than that—plasticity is a distinguishing characteristic of man. The individual who is much more one thing than another encounters other persons who are much more something else—and voice the fact. The with  

drawing ectomorph is told by the outward-living endomorphs and mesomorphs to snap out of it, and he in turn talks back. Each to some extent is affected by the symbols of the others, and through these symbols takes their roles to some degree. The stubbornness of differences prevents individuals from often wanting to become each other. But ideas and ideals are slightly changed in the impact of different selves talking to each other. There is a movement toward the ways of the center. Way 7 is liked by all kinds of persons, but not with the same extravagance.  

This trek toward Peak 7 of the Himalayas of the self is of the utmost importance in showing that diverse persons can, and many today do, share a common personality ideal. Such agreement is one step toward social unity—but only one step.  

Even the lure of Maitreya conceals a danger if it causes us to lose sight of human diversity. For as the aptitudes and needs of persons differ, so should the accents of their ideals differ. The mesomorph is a magnificent instrument for surmounting obstacles, for driving through. Neither he nor society would profit if he tried to be as equally dependent and detached as he is dominant. The ectomorph is canny, cautious, critical, often rich in an elfish wit; he will not be taken in by the embrace of dependence or the strong grip of domination. And who really wishes him to be? The endomorph under all but the extremes of frustration remains amiable, hospitable, helpful, unperturbed, enjoyable and enjoying. Who would counsel him to sit on the flagpole of detachment or to exchange the butter of enjoyment for the cannonball of power? Enrichment by opposites to be sure, humor toward oneself, the tension of contraries, multiplicity—but in varying degrees for various persons. There are enough persons who by nature must bear the threefold tension of the center, and even they will do it in  

different manners. The periphery folk must not be coerced.  

No Maitreyan tyranny! Way 7 is only one alternative among others. To impose its personality ideal upon everyone would be as tyrannous as the imposition of any other personality ideal. Abundance can be as burdensome as constriction. Specializations of the self are as legitimate as its expansion.  

The appeal of the Maitreyan Way in our culture is nevertheless of great importance. It can provide direction and orientation to large numbers of persons for whom the historical alternatives have lost their lure. Its wide acceptance will in itself be a strong force for social unity. It will even strengthen the moral forces which make for considerateness of others. For a person pulled by all the main psychological needs, and sympathetic to them in himself, is prepared to understand and to sympathize with other persons driven more strongly by some of these needs than others. The individual who recognizes that each component of his own personality requires the challenge and support of other components for its growth is ready to recognize that the fullest development of any self needs the vivifying evocative impacts of other and different selves. In this manner the Maitreyan personality ideal points to the ideal of a society abundant in contrasting personalities, unified in its acceptance and support of diversity.  

We must now explore on its own right the conception of unity as patterned diversity. And this leads us next to philosophy.  

# What Is Philosophy?  

The word "philosophy" is one of the Big Words. It is not to be invoked carelessly or lightly. A philosophy of multiplicity must show its credentials.  

A philosophy is a person's attempt to pull himself, together  

intellectually, to see where he stands in the matter of basic beliefs. The search for a philosophy is the search for intellectual integration. Beliefs are no longer to be held uncritically and in isolation; they are to undergo critical examination, and be drawn together to form a consistent system. Comprehensiveness and systematization of fundamental beliefs are the marks of the philosophizing intellect.  

Beliefs about the nature of the cosmos, beliefs about what is good and how it is to be attained, beliefs about the methods to be used in gaining knowledge—these are the basic beliefs which a philosopher seeks. They mark off the main subdivisions of philosophy: cosmology, theory of value, theory of knowledge. The various proposals for a set of basic beliefs in these matters constitute the various systems of philosophy.  

To pull oneself together intellectually is part of the process of pulling oneself together as a person. It is not surprising therefore that the various philosophies are intimately related to the various ways of life we have considered. The connection is so close that it is hard to say which is the hen and which the egg—and equally unnecessary. In many a good staircase the way up is spiral. The kind of person one is makes one more open to some ideas rather than others, but as ideas gain entrance and grow, they in turn influence the future self of the person into whom they have entered. Philosophies have in many instances grown up around the historic ways of life, and remained close to them in a process of reciprocal growth. In Paths of Life I tried to show how Buddhism, Christianity, and other great value patterns, fashioned for themselves systems of philosophic belief to support and defend the life they advocated and exemplified. To the extent that this is so, a system of philosophy is close to a theology, that is, close to a defense of a way of life.  

But what keeps a philosophy from becoming, or merely continuing as, a theology is the comprehensiveness of its intellectual claims. Even where it defends a way of life it must do this critically in the light of available evidence, otherwise philosophy fails in intellectual comprehensiveness. But to consider all available evidence means that philosophy cannot ignore science—the best certified knowledge of a given time. A way of life is designed for living persons in an actual world. Science talks about persons and the world. So philosophy must listen to what science says about the world and man if it wishes to defend the claim that a given mode of life or of social organization is appropriate for persons in the world in which they live.  

For the most part scientific knowledge does little to change the basic structure of the various philosophies. Many of the beliefs that men live by are so general, and the area of scientific knowledge so limited, that the data of science do not decisively confirm or disprove these beliefs. But at times a revolution in science is so devastating to certain beliefs which men have held that it shakes their allegiance to the philosophies which have defended such beliefs. In doing this science may bring about fundamental changes in philosophy, and these changes in turn may favor the emergence of new schemes for living. This is what is to be expected if men do make themselves by their ideals, and if ideals are made by men on the basis both of their needs and their ideas.  

The dual allegiance of philosophy to ideas and to ideals (to beliefs as to what should be based upon beliefs as to what is) means that a philosophy adequate to a scientific age must forge its ideals of what men and society should be in the light of today's scientific knowledge of the world and man. Our argument is that the contemporary philosophy of diversity, in har  

mony with present scientific knowledge of man and nature and with the method of science, suggests how a society in which no type of person has a privileged place can still attain unity.  

# Philosophies and Persons  

No careful study has been made of the disposition of different kinds of persons to accept one system of philosophy rather than another. That there is some such tendency is to be expected. It is certainly no coincidence that the various proposals for living show marked differences in their supporting philosophies. It would be surprising if Apollonians should link themselves with philosophies which underline change or Prometheus with philosophies which see only stabilities. If the preference for alternative ways to live is linked to some degree with personality differences, the same relation would almost certainly hold for philosophies.  

We can get some evidence that linkages between philosophies and persons do exist by considering answers which we obtained to the following document. But try it first yourself!

The answers of about a hundred persons to a longer version of this document suggest that persons of various physiques tend to find some philosophies more acceptable than others. The differences however are seldom striking, and what we report must be regarded as a tentative generalization to be improved by further study.  

The predominantly endomorphic persons showed a marked tendency to believe that the stream of history is purposive, and not a play of chance or the working of a machine. They accepted more than other groups the view that the universe was due to God's love. They did not think of the world as a society of selves, and of all groups they were least concerned with their own personal immortality. They were most inclined to think of the universe as an intellectual system, and the truth about this universe as something to be tested by the logical consistency of their own thought. These views taken together suggest the familiar philosophic pattern called absolute idealism: the universe is conceived of in psychological terms, but as an organic, objective, somewhat impersonal  

spiritual whole. Such a universe is mightier than oneself. It gives and takes away, to be sure. But it is not alien, and it is dependable. We are not surprised that the endomorphs take to it most. Or that the American defender of absolute idealism, Josiah Royce, was strongly endomorphic.  

We shall divide the mesomorphs into two groups: those in whom endomorphy was stronger than ectomorphy, and those in whom ectomorphy was stronger than endomorphy.  

The doctrines which were most favored by the endomorphic mesomorphs suggest another philosophic pattern: that of personal idealism. This philosophy thinks of the world as made up solely of selves or things like selves. It is a world of novelty, chance, creativity, even caprice. It is not a world of mechanisms or a "bloodless ballet" of logical categories. The endomorphic mesomorphs feel at home in this world. They believe most that truth is tested by practice. They are the most optimistic of all the groups. And why not? They are vigorous persons, expansive, warm-hearted, confident of their power. Such a world gives them a suitable field of action. William James was such a person, and such was the world of his belief.  

The ectomorphy of the ectomorphic mesomorphs draws their philosophical lips tighter. They still admit caprice. They still trust their power to direct in some measure the course of events. But they are less optimistic, less expansive, more canny, more given to foresight. The world is not seen as a society of selves but as a material system, more an expression of will than of love or mind. To get the truth about it requires careful observation, requires the empirical temper. To mold it to our will requires hard thought and hard work. This is the philosophic pattern of naturalism. It is the pragmatism of John Dewey as contrasted to the pragmatism of William James.  

The more extreme ectomorphs feel most strongly the world as an alien pressure. Their replies give the greatest assent to the view that the course of history is mechanistic, and the least assent to the view of history as capricious. The cosmos is to most of them a world of matter, to some an intellectual system—but not often a society of selves. They can envisage the world as an expression of mind but not as an expression of love. The philosophy they accept is that of realism. They can know and acknowledge the might of the world but they need not bow down before it. They are perforce in the world, but they need not be of it. In our time Bertrand Russell—at least the early Russell—spoke to them in terms which compelled their assent.  

Such is the evidence—slight to be sure, and tentative—that there is a concordance between persons and the philosophies they choose and build. We favor in general those symbols which are supported by the press of our experience and are supports for our preferences. In philosophy, as elsewhere, we confess ourselves, and make the most of our own resources. And why not?  

# The Spectre of Relativism  

Since each past philosophy has offered itself as the truth (and each past religion as the Way), even the suggestion of a connection between personality and the acceptance of philosophies is certain to arouse violent opposition. Perhaps the reader is saying to himself: "Truth is being relativized!" "The objectivity of value is being destroyed!" "Disciplined thought is being replaced by individual caprice!"  

Such alarm is premature and groundless. Our results—tentative as they are—open up new philosophic possibilities, new opportunities for the better grounding of our basic beliefs. For  

only if we are aware of the way our inclinations influence our world outlook can we take into account our own biases and look with wider vision on the world. Every astronomer has learned to discount in his observations the idiosyncrasies of his own perception; as philosophers we must learn likewise that we tend to view the world in the image of our personal drives and personal fortunes. We are biased even in the selection and rejection of evidence. If we are mesomorphs we may easily welcome a capricious and malleable world, for in that world we can as free agents insert our fingers into its crevices and mold its future. If we are endomorphs we may find more comfort in a conception of the world as purposive, value-conserving, value-insuring. If we are ectomorphs we may be more impressed by the hard core of things that press so powerfully upon us, the external world appearing as a vast mechanism which we can do little to direct.  

To recognize our biases in these matters is not to repudiate ourselves, nor our philosophies. Thinking is by a self and for a self, and philosophic thinking is no exception. The key symbols of our philosophies serve for our own integration. They inevitably bear the signatures of their makers and the imprint of that aspect of the world to which their makers are most sensitive. A plurality of philosophies is humanly understandable and humanly acceptable.  

Why then is its admission so contested? Mainly because the philosophy we hold is the intellectual counterpart of the self we are; to admit philosophic alternatives threatens the self, suggests that we might be different, awakens fear that the foundations of our selfhood are not firm. We hug our philosophies because they are our verbal clothes.  

Nevertheless, other philosophies of other persons are encountered. And since philosophy is the issue of the critical in  

tellect, we are forced by this encounter to examine anew the grounds of our beliefs. We are forced to consider evidence our biases would like to neglect. And so we arrive at the ideal of a philosophy which would transcend personal idiosyncrasies and be based upon all available evidence.  

Such a philosophy is not an impossible ideal. But to move in its direction it is first necessary to be aware of the tendencies in ourselves which have given rise to the multiplicity of philosophies. And then it is necessary to recognize that the movement to objectivity requires the enlargement of our selves. The scientist overcomes his own biases by being forced to take account of evidence which other and differently biased scientists educe. In the same way our philosophic biases can be overcome only if we enlarge the conception of the world favored by our initial self through consideration of the conception of the world favored by other selves.  

The coming philosophy will embrace in a wider synthesis the philosophies answering to the more specialized selves. Its perspective will involve whatever truth is in theirs. It will not give the truth, or the whole truth, but truth on a wider canvas. It will not transcend perspectives but attain a more complex perspective. It will not obliterate multiplicity but embrace multiplicity. It will be as Oriental as it is Western. It will talk to endomorph, mesomorph, and ectomorph alike. Its objectivity will come not by abandoning our selves but by expanding them. The most objective philosophy can issue only from the most comprehensive self.  

# Objective Relativism  

A pluralistic philosophy of this temper is slowly becoming articulate. It is being forged in close relation to the results and the methods of science. It has as yet no official name. "Per  

"specivism" is one candidate. "Contextualism" is another. "Objective relativism" is a third, and the one we shall choose. This philosophy is at the center of American pragmatism; it is well developed in the writings of George H. Mead (especially in The Philosophy of the Present and The Philosophy of the Act). For Mead the unity of the self and society and nature lies in the organization of a multiplicity of perspectives. On this philosophy nothing exists except within a perspective, and there is no all-embracing absolute perspective within which everything exists. Substantiality lies not in isolation but in endurance through diverse interaction. We, societies, and the world are enduring patterns of diversity.  

Let us explicate this position of objective relativism by a simple example. What is coal? There will be little disagreement on what to examine—we shall ask the coal-miner for samples. Black stuff—to the eye or camera; stuff that cracks—before the pick-axe; stuff that weighs so much per unit volume—when put on a scale; stuff that burns—at times. Blackness, breakability, weight, inflammability—these are properties which are objective (belong to the object coal), and yet properties of coal only in various relations, contexts, perspectives. So objectively relative properties. As miners, or scientists, we know nothing about coal beyond its objectively relative properties. We may vary the conditions, as when we subject coal to immense pressures. Coal then has new properties, properties linked with what coal is in other circumstances, but still properties which appear in a given context, within a relational perspective. We never deal with things outside of, or beyond, or behind perspectives, but only in one or more interrelated contexts. We do find that what a thing is in some contexts is connected with what it is in others. Since this is all we find, it is natural to think of the “unity” or “substantiality”  

of things as residing in this connectedness of their objectively relative properties. And since we have no evidence of an absolute perspective, it is plausible to conceive whatever unity the cosmos has as residing in the organization of a multiplicity of perspectives. The unity of the self and the unity of a society are in turn patterns of diversity within the cosmos, linked with each other and with physical nature. Such in crude terms is the philosophy of objective relativism.  

This philosophy of perspectivism or contextualism is relativistic to be sure. But such relativism is not vicious. It gives us both unity and diversity. It saves us from absolutism and nihilism alike. It forces us to qualify our assertions by stating explicitly the conditions under which something is affirmed to be—or to be good. But this is merely what semantic healthiness demands of us if we are to avoid the pitfall of over-generalization. It does not follow that things are not objectively what they are under given conditions, or that under certain conditions one thing is not really better than another. Neither truth nor value is made "subjective." The philosophy of objective relativism is a movement toward greater objectivity, not its denial.  

This philosophy is a generalization grounded in the advance of science. Relativism in physics has forced us to pay attention to the circumstances under which a physical object has a given velocity or mass or movement; relativism in the social studies has forced us to relate a given characteristic of social life to the whole constellation of cultural traits in which it appears; psychological relativism is forcing us to link the action of an individual not only to his society and his physical environment but also to his own biological and temperamental traits. Relativism in all these cases is "relationism," "contextualism," "perspectivism." It is the direction in which scientific thought  

has attained greater concreteness, greater precision, greater objectivity. The philosophy of objective relativism merely generalizes this tendency. In doing this it gains the support of scientific doctrine and method.  

The effect of objective relativism on the quest for the good life is not devastating but saluatory. It gives us an alternative to both dogmatism and anarchic. The opponents of this philosophy maintain that it leaves us with no "standards." But to qualify a claim that something is good by stating for whom and under what conditions it is good is not to deny that good is objective or to repudiate the role of standards; it is merely to substitute responsibility in the quest for value for an arbitrary acceptance of existing standards or an arbitrary imposition of one's own standards on others. No one would maintain that a certain diet is not good for a certain individual merely because it is not good for every person. Why then the gesture of alarm unless all persons accept the same art, the same philosophy, the same way of life? If we are really concerned about other persons we must be responsive to their individual peculiarities and their individual needs. All else is tyranny, however sweet its name. Objective relativism protects us against this tyranny. It permits common goods answering to the similarities of persons; it permits individual goods answering to personal uniqueness. It justifies our search for a form of social unity which would embrace and sustain the multiplicity of our distinctive selves.  

Otto Neurath liked to compare scientific advance to the re-pairing of a ship at sea. When a leak is sprung, the crew stands on the portion of the ship still intact while it repairs the leaking part. These men may later stand on the repaired part while working on a new leak which has arisen in the part of the ship that was previously intact. The multiple self and the  

multiple society maintain their unity in the same manner. Life presents a problem in a concrete present. The self must repair itself around this problem. The unproblematic parts of the self and society provide the structure upon which the self stands, provide it standards. In terms of these standards it surveys alternatives and chooses between them. It thereby remakes part of itself and its society. What was unproblematic may at a later time become a problem. Then the previously remade portion of the self and the society becomes part of the framework within which the new problem, and the new remaking, proceed. John Dewey, above all others, has taught us this important lesson.  

We walk by standing on one foot and seeking a support for the other which will advance us in the direction we wish to go. As selves we move forward in the same manner. We use all facets of our multiple self as legs upon which in turn to stand and as legs with which to move. Each need of our self becomes in turn a standard which controls the development of each other need. Our unity lies in the interaction of our multiplicities. Our search for a way of life is our effort to pattern our diversities, to give them integrated direction. Our social task is to build a society whose unity will lie in the interaction of all of us.  

Objective relativism justifies us in this endeavor. It gives us tolerance to permit other selves to seek their ways under the press of their own needs and their own times. It gives us courage to move forward to the formulation of a social ideal adequate for the construction of a new human epoch.  

# Joyful Wisdom  

The world presented by modern science is large and complex. Large with time, great in space, inexhaustible in its com  

plexity. A world with stubborn mechanisms, revolutionary novelties, purposeful life. Burning suns, cold moons, moderate earth. An earth with a hot equator, temperate middle zones, and icy polar caps. Minute unseen particles of vast energy and velocity, millions of animal species, two billion men and women, a billion or so gigantic galaxies of countless stars. An earth many hundreds of millions of years old, and going strong. A human history hundreds of thousands of years in length, and with many more thousands ahead. A cosmos stable and changeful, filled with life and death, replete with tragedy and joy, a tissue of interlocked processes, a multiplicity of unities, a one in many. A Great Thing.  

As spectacle for enjoyment, as scene for action, as occasion for thought the cosmos is large enough for our largest selves. An abundant cosmos does not demand only abundant selves. But a large self needs a large world, and can stand it. An abundant self welcomes a diversified world that mirrors its abundance.  

The cosmos is large enough for all our needs. It is stable enough to satisfy our longings for dependability, open enough for us to direct certain of its eventuations, spacious enough to permit us islands for meditative privacy.  

The fault lies not in the stars but in ourselves. We have been too petty, too greedy, too cramped, too fearsome, too superficial, too complacent, too serious. We have been content with fragments of our selves. We have not dared our full selves. The universe of the Many encourages us to dare. The universe is built on daring.  

# The Open Society
of Open Selves  

SOCIETIES, LIKE INDIVIDUAL SELVES, ARE OPEN or closed in varying degrees and in various ways. We stand today before the alternatives of a society more open than men have ever dreamed or a society more closed than men have ever endured. The tension between social stability and freedom has never been greater, and the relation of each to social planning could not be more confused. We need all our resources before these blustering winds of March. We must formulate our social ideal. To this end we must explore more fully than we have yet done the social aspects of selfhood.  

Let us follow Erich Fromm by adding a new arrow to our sling of words—"character." Character is a more complicated level of personality than physique or temperament. Character comprises the relatively stable patterns of motivations and behavior which a person assumes in the course of his life-history in the physical and social world. Kindliness or cruelty, niggardliness or generosity, conceit or self-depreciation, anxiety or self-confidence, productiveness or neurosis—these are all traits of character. It is true that persons with certain kinds of physique more easily develop some types of character than others. But the connection is looser, more complex, more  

capricious. Temperament as the style of the body's reaction remains close to the body. Character as an affair of life-history is more variable. Temperament is a resource, character an eventuation. Character is what a person with a given physique has become through his efforts, his thoughts, his encounters with the physical environment, his interactions with other persons.  

While our individual characters are our own, it is evident that many of us have many traits of character in common, and that as members of a particular society we have a common core of character traits which distinguish us from members of other societies. We shall borrow from Erich Fromm the term "social character" to name those traits of character held in common by members of a given culture because of their participation in that culture. We must now try to understand how social character arises—for we seek our social ideal and a social ideal is a core element in a social character. In asking ourselves what kind of society we want we are asking ourselves what traits of character we want to hold in common.  

Abram Kardiner's book, The Psychological Frontiers of Society, serves as a convenient springboard. For this work not only represents the current stress of the social scientists upon how society makes the man, but it does this on the basis of a Freudian psychology which is attentive to the life-histories of specific individuals within a given society. It therefore marks a stage in the growing convergence of social science and the study of individuals.  

Kardiner presents his views by an analysis of the results of three anthropological investigations—our Comanche Indians made by Ralph Linton, the people of the island of Alor made by Cora du Bois, and the residents of "Plainville U.S.A." made by James West.  

What concerns us especially is Kardiner's notion of "basic  

personality type." He holds that the members of each of the cultures share certain common personality traits which constitute the basic personality type of the culture in question. The Comanches have the traits of "prowess, daring, enterprise, strength, and skill"; the Alorese are "anxious, suspicious, mistrustful, lacking in confidence, with no interest in the outer world"; in Plainville (and in general in Western culture) "the whole community is permeated with the struggle to achieve status-prestige, whether it be in the guise of respectability or of wealth," and yet the community has "a collective inferiority feeling."  

Kardiner seeks to explain these differences in social character through differences in the training of children in the three societies. The Comanche child is given affection, reassurance, and sexual freedom; the Alorese child is denied sustaining parental care by the fact that the mother leaves the child most of the day in order to work in the fields; the Plainville child is provided with affection and reassurance but is sexually repressed. These differences in the training of children are held to explain the different basic personality types in the three cultures. The differences between individuals in each culture are regarded as variations within the personality type distinctive of the culture, and so less "basic."  

One minor point before we proceed. That a society has a fundamental influence on the personality development of its members does not mean that biological differences are non-existent, or unimportant in comparison with cultural differences. Indeed, arguments as to which is more "basic" are in the end mainly terminological—"basic" is in such arguments more an appraisive than a designative sign. Suppose, for instance, different kinds of trees were planted under a wire ceiling. As the tree tops reached this impediment they would  

bend in various ways. What is then "basic"? The common bent and stunted character of all trees or the differences in the kinds of trees? Is a stunted oak "basically" stunted or "basically" oak? If this is still a problem for us our excursion into semantics has been in vain. For this reason we prefer Erich Fromm's term "social character" to Kardiner's phrase "basic personality type."  

This minor reservation does not of course affect the contention of Kardiner and the social scientists that a culture develops a common social character in its members, and that it does this primarily through the ways it trains the young. If all or most children in a culture are given assurance in childhood, then daring and enterprise may well become common adult traits. And if sustaining parental care is withheld by the work of mothers in the field, anxiety and lack of confidence may well permeate adult life. To connect the formation of social character with the details of child training—as Margaret Mead, L. K. Frank, Kardiner, and others have done—is to take an important step forward. For it shows us with growing concreteness how society can make us in important respects alike.  

Nevertheless, it does not answer the vexing question as to why different methods of child training arise in various cultures. It throws some light on how a culture perpetuates itself. It leaves us in the dark as to how different cultures arise.  

# Men Make Cultures  

Kardiner himself, however, makes certain incidental remarks concerning the Comanche Indians which suggest that specific individuals invent a culture and shape it to their image.  

The Comanches migrated from a Montana plateau to the  

plains of Texas and Oklahoma. The culture changed from a relatively non-warlike way of life dominated by the medicine man to an aggressive life of war and plunder dominated by the war chief. The acquisition of the gun and the horse from other groups gave new instruments of power. But as Kardiner admits, only a part of the old culture became Comanche, and the part that did "could not be started by timid and inhibited men." He tells us that "a bit of natural selection must have occurred," and that "the culture of Comanche was . . . the perpetuation of those most suited to withstand the risks involved in the new life."  

Now this immediately suggests that Comanche culture might be the result of the rise to power of strongly mesomorphic persons. Its appearance shows that such persons had not been obliterated by the former less warlike institutions. Equipped with the new instruments of horse and gun, they could rise in a time of crisis to leadership. Such persons would most likely lead the migration. Those of similar disposition would rally around them, those less daring would stay in the old home, or assume subordinate roles. In time a selection of mesomorphic physiques might occur so that this physique would become numerically more predominant than before. But even more important would be the shift of leadership to such persons. For the ideal of daring, resourceful, aggressive selfhood then becomes the favored personality ideal. The ways such persons behave become the favored ways of the culture, become in short the institutional agencies of the society. The young are trained in these ways and those who most easily respond to such training become in turn the new leaders. Those most recalcitrant to such training become the deviants of the culture, the "contrary ones" of the Comanche.  

In some such way various kinds of persons rise to leader  

ship in a society, and make the pattern of its culture. Their ways become its ways. What kind of person becomes dominant will depend on many circumstances. A crisis in the society will bring to prominence those who most adequately respond to the crisis. A new invention may increase power and favor those who can use this power most effectively. A too-great disaster may favor those who counsel resignation or magic or meditation or the relinquishment of aggressive action. A period of ease may bring into the social spotlight those to whom relaxation and pleasure come easily. Different societies presumably differ somewhat in the distribution of individual differences; they certainly differ widely in their ideal of the kind of person one should be. And this ideal is initially formed in terms of the personalities of specific individuals who have risen to leadership in a crisis and molded in turn the institutions of their culture.  

The fact of social character remains, and its transmission by specific methods of training the young. But our understanding of how members of a culture become alike in certain ways is deepened by shifting our attention to the question as to how under specific social conditions particular kinds of persons rise to dominance and impose their value pattern on young and old alike. This outlook makes intelligible the stubborn persistence of social character but also its slow modification and even its drastic mutation. It frees us from the fetish of an immutable "national character." The revolutions in Russia and Germany and China have in our own day been witnesses to the great shifts in social character which may occur when in periods of crisis leadership passes into new hands. We cannot even take it for granted that American social character will always be the same.  

The established techniques of child training in any culture act as brakes against drastic changes. But these techniques are  

only one social agency among others, and change as the culture changes. Perhaps even our pediatricians have more effect than they realize. It makes a great difference whether they tell us to feed our children by the clocks on the wall or by the clocks of infant hunger. We can train for inflexibility or for flexibility.  

# Society Can Maim Its Makers  

Cultures, then, are made by persons. They are modes of life achieved by given individuals and perpetuated by them as the ways in which other persons in the society are to live.  

This way of looking at culture— foreshadowed by Thorstein Veblen—is important both theoretically and practically. Theoretically it marks the complete transcendence in the science of man of the still-too-prominent opposition of biological and social categories. In exploring persons, if we start with their bodies we cannot stop until we have explored the ways in which their bodies find frustration or satisfaction in the given culture in which they live; if we start with the culture, we cannot stop until we have studied under what circumstances and in what kinds of bodies these approved ways of carrying on originated and are perpetuated. "Culture" no longer appears as a mysterious super-personal force, but as something made by specific persons to satisfy their motivations, and perpetuated or remade by other persons according to whether or not it satisfies their own motivations. We are thus in a position to do more than describe existing cultures. We might begin to search for laws of culture formation by studying the conditions under which specific kinds of persons gain social leadership and attempt to modify the habits of life of the group in a way expressive of, and congenial to, themselves.  

But this thoroughgoing bio-social orientation of the science  

of man is also of great practical importance. If cultures are so made, perpetuated, and remade by men and women, we are encouraged to take the reins of culture-making into our own hands. For we can now attempt to locate the social ceilings in our own culture which frustrate the growth of human trees, and attempt to devise by social inventiveness new techniques which will avoid these frustrations.  

This enlargement of our freedom to the sphere of society comes from the fact that we are now in sight of a criterion of cultural effectiveness. Our discussion of appraisals taught us to qualify our judgments of good and bad by stating the conditions under which they are intended to apply. This insight will make us within wide limits tolerant and appreciative of cultural diversity. It will prevent us from taking our own culture as the norm according to which every culture is to be praised or condemned. It will make it easier for us to learn something from the alternative ways of living which different people under different circumstances have devised.  

But by the same token the objective relativity of appraisals permits us a basis for the critical assessment of cultures, including our own. We do not have to say, as many anthropologists say, that all patterns of life are "equally valid." For a given social organization may be better or worse than another, provided always that our evaluation is made with respect to given individuals confronted by given problems at a specific stage of cultural development.  

A culture is effective to the extent that it enables the various individuals who comprise it to satisfy their various motivations. The motivations of an individual are defined by two termini: constitutional needs and the pattern of cultural value internalized in the individual. The social character which embodies the values of the culture may support the constitu  

tional needs of its members. But it is also possible for the social character to neglect or even oppose the needs of certain individuals in the society. Relative to such individuals the ideals and agencies of the society are false, inadequate, evil.  

Suppose for instance that a society is composed of predominantly mesomorphic persons but that leadership has been gained in some way by a few ectomorphic persons whose favored goals are peacefulness, lack of conflict, non-aggressiveness, and contemplation. To the extent that these ideals are trained into the young, the mesomorphs also tend to assume this social character stemming from persons low in mesomorphy. But to the extent that the mesomorphs' need for adventure and domination is thwarted in this process, the social organization is frustrating to them and ineffective.  

Something like this is frequently, and indeed usually, the case. For insofar as a society is molded by ideals most appropriate to one type of physique its approved ways of acting will be thwarting in various degrees to every other type of physique. And since in most societies there is a great diversity of types of physique, a culture usually favors certain persons and thwarts others. With respect then to the total membership of a society, existing social agencies are usually ineffective to some degree or other, and frequently grossly ineffective. This tension is generally, in time, relieved by a change in social leadership, often under some great social crisis. But such a change may merely shift the burden of frustration from certain persons to others.  

Reader, make the import of this analysis your own! You have as much right to realize your potentialities as has anybody else. No more, but as much. In some cases there may be little discrepancy between the approved social goals of your society and the way you would like to live. But where  

there is such a discrepancy your task is to lessen it, to devise a life in which the maximum use is made of your own resources. Your own combination of bodily traits and motivational needs is as precious as that of anyone else.  

It is disastrous for the ectomorphs or the endomorphs among us to take too seriously the objectives and the practices of our predominantly mesomorphic social character. And it is equally disastrous for the mesomorphs among us to deny their drive for domination, for this would force it underground into hatred and resentment or into the high air of disguised domineering. For the sake of creativity and for the sake of society the individual must remain faithful to himself. He must refuse to acquiesce in the frustration of his underlying motivations whether these be biologically or socially derived.  

# The Closed Society  

The invention of more effective cultures is not only resisted by those who are doing well as things are, but also by those who are too ill to dare.  

A society is closed to the extent that it opposes changes that would more effectively satisfy the motivations of its members, whether these be biological needs or whether they be needs which the society has implanted. The closed society is the inflexible society; it is the pattern of the staleated self writ large. Since a culture exists only in the institutions which order the relations of persons, the closed society is a set of institutions springing from, and perpetuating, closed selves. It is generated and sustained by the anxieties which close the self.  

The closed society is the possessive society, and the possessive society is largely the social phase of the strategy of the  

closed self. Anxious persons join hands with greedy persons to close society in a desperate endeavor to reduce their anxieties. The closed society is the social catacomb of anxious selves.  

Social closure takes on many forms, and expresses itself in many degrees. All the neuroses and the psychoses of the individual show analogues on the social map. The science of man will in time explore fully the diverse forms of social pathology. Our immediate task is limited to our own danger.  

We have recently lived through the rise and fall of one form of social closure in the totalitarian societies of Germany, Japan, and Italy. Have we forgotten how near their alliance came to domination of the world? How Britain's planes and Russia's army checked it long enough for America to mobilize her resources? Do we still realize that the outcome might have been different if German scientists had achieved the atom bomb? And that a great piece of luck helped prevent their doing just this? The German scientists had discovered atomic fission early enough to have had the bomb ready by the outbreak of the war, but they did not realize what they had done. We cannot indefinitely trust to such luck.  

The psychological conditions which gave rise to this juggernaut society are still in the world, still in Russia, still in China, still in us. The black powers of possessiveness work at the social as well as the individual level. And in our day they capture for their uses the instruments which men have made for their own liberation—atomic power, the agencies of mass-communication, patriotic devotion. It is essential to understand the sources in ourselves which make for the main modern form of the closed society—the totalitarian state.  

Social closure is social inflexibility. A highly organized, efficient, war-like, even totalitarian, society is usually, but not necessarily, a closed society in the restricted sense in which  

we are using the term. Not necessarily, for it is conceivable that a group of highly mesomorphic persons might to their individual satisfaction organize their drives for power into a society bent on domination, but remain flexible and realistic in the strategies by which it advances to its goal. Such a society, however, usually moves to closure—for most societies are composed of many kinds of persons, and most of these persons do not find satisfaction in a society geared to the power motive alone. It is only under very special conditions that widely diverse persons will accept such a society, namely, under conditions of widespread anxiety. A society threatened with war will mobilize of course its resources, but it will not choose to live continually in what Harold Lasswell has called the garrison state unless there are widespread anxieties in its members which seek relief in this manner.  

The sources of such extensive anxiety are varied. The social character of a culture formed in the image of the persons who have risen to leadership may become increasingly ill-adapted to other kinds of persons. Many fail in the struggle to gain the socially approved symbols of success, and are haunted by the sense of inadequacy, and by resentment. Those who do succeed in this competition fear to lose their privileged status, and the inventiveness which was their initial merit collapses into strategies to keep their status. In hugging their possessions the privileged lose their flexibility. Economic deprivations, a chronic source of tension, are intensified by the mounting possessiveness; persisting economic maladjustment is as much a symptom of widespread anxiety as its cause. Competing cultures, instead of being accepted as healthy challenges, are felt as threats to be removed; war is both welcomed as a way out and feared as a test. The society becomes frustrated, hysterical, jumpy. Anxiety unrelieved generates anxiety at compound interest.  

This network of anxiety sets the stage for the emergence of leaders, leaders of the underprivileged, leaders of the privileged. The power to dominate and control a whole society is a tempting prize. Widespread anxiety makes it possible to do so. In this struggle the men who rise to high power are necessarily men of determination, courage, fervor, and iron conviction. They are likely to be mesomorphic persons whose drive to dominance has been sharpened and toughened by earlier frustration. They draw around them similar men lured by the opening door of power. They promise to wrap around the endomorph the protective arms of society: They enlist the ectomorph as symbol-maker of the new order. To privileged and underprivileged alike they offer relief from anxiety. To those who oppose them they offer heightened anxiety. Before fear they show a fearless face.  

The results may vary in outcome. The leaders of the underprivileged may triumph, relax their control, and history record the episode as a successful and necessary revolution, a victory against threatened social stagnation. Or these same leaders may triumph and perpetuate the closed society which they created. Or the defenders of the privileged may triumph by closing the social door against the push of threatened change.  

The modern' totalitarian society, nourished on the food of anxiety, is temporarily effective through its promise to relieve anxiety. It is ultimately unsatisfactory because it lives only by the perpetuation of anxieties. The endomorph finds in the arms of the state a cold lover, the ectomorph sees his symbolism of the ideal discarded when his leaders take over, only a few of the power-hungry mesomorphs are rewarded with the degree of power for which they longed. The leaders of this society are forced to maintain themselves against an ever-growing discontent by an ever-increasing domination of the  

persons in their power. Neighboring societies must be presented as hostile. Moral sentiments, truth, art, and science must be narrowed to national boundaries. The state must be glorified, and individuality condemned. Power becomes corrupt.  

The closed society perpetuates itself by the deliberate closure of the selves of its members. The main agencies for this end are terrorism, the rationing of food, and the direction of ideas and ideals by the control of the press, the radio, the schools, the arts, the sciences, and the public platform. By the limitations of men's thoughts, by the restriction of their food, and by the exaggeration of their fears the contemporary closed society can enslave men more effectively than ever before. The furnaces and the torture-chambers of Belsen, Buchenwald, and Dachau were the fatal fruits of this modern horror.  

The forces which engender the closed society are present in each one of us. What has happened elsewhere can in its own way happen here in America. The closed society is not imposed on us; it is something we make in our distress, even if our only share in the making is to let it happen without protest. The closed society is, as Erich Fromm says, our attempt to escape from freedom.  

# The Social Ideal for a New Epoch  

The alternative to the closed society of closed selves is the counter-ideal of the open society of open selves. The ideal of the open society of open selves is the new social ideal to direct the emerging epoch. It is the lure to draw men beyond the catacomb of the closed society. Societies have in the past been open for certain patterns of selfhood. But modern man has glimpsed the extension of such openness. The new thing is the ideal of a society open to all forms of open selfhood.  

The open society of open selves will accept and dignify diversity. It will repudiate all attempts to pour its members into a common mold. It will be a society in which all varieties of persons can attain their own unique forms of integrity. It will glory in a multiplicity of arts and philosophies and ways of life. It will recognize that interactions between persons must be as diversified as interacting persons are diverse. It will constantly adapt its institutions to meet new needs and new problems. It will use its technology of abundant power to further human diversity and abundance. It will make available to all persons the knowledge, the security, the food, the medical care, the leisure, the mobility which they need for continuing growth. It will be a person-centered society in which no type of person can impose his pattern of selfhood upon other persons.  

To make a culture in which each person is effectively free to the limit of his capacity is the task which man must now set himself. It is a gigantic, difficult, awesome, and joyous task. In assuming it man has begun a new epoch in his career. The mark of this new epoch is man's deliberate assumption of the task of man-making. Man has begun to do deliberately and for all persons what he has so far done blindly and for a few persons like himself. He has become at last the conscious self-maker and culture-maker. The self he has set to make of himself is some form of open self. The culture he has set himself to build is the open society of open selves.  

It is this ideal alone which can furnish the necessary unity for a society built on diversity. Without a unifying ideal no culture is possible. For a culture, as we have seen, exists only when persons are similar in certain respects, when they share a common social character. The unique feature of the social character involved in the acceptance of the ideal of an open  

It is obvious that the ideal of an open society of open selves has not yet become an effective or dominant part of the social character of many persons. Nor, since openness is a matter of degree, is it to be expected that this social ideal will ever be completely realized. The point is rather that this ideal can give unity to a pluralistic society, can give direction and directives in the struggle against the closed society. It is supported in the modern world by strong psychological and technological forces which make possible its unlimited strengthening.  

The historical events of recent centuries attest the fact that the ideal of the open society has historic roots. The psychological data we surveyed earlier shows that it has taken root in the social character of modern men. That this ideal is so widespread is evidence that social forces are already at work in the production of this new social character. And as the ideal clarifies itself, and implements itself through concerted action, it will in turn work back on existing social institutions and remake them into more effective agencies. The open self will choose to build an open society, for only in such a society can it remain open. As selves grow strong in openness they  

society of open selves may be expressed in Horace Kallen's incisive phrase, "the equal right to be different." Diversity has in this ideal become a unifying principle. The common core of this ideal is what different men share in common: the movement toward the open self. The resulting social character is no longer something framed in terms of one type of temperament or physique, and imposed upon others as their standard. It is rather the acceptance by each person of the right of all persons to strive toward their self-fulfillment as he strives toward his own. And the willingness to cooperate in social action with others so that they as well as himself may attain fulfillment.  

become strong enough to permit other selves to grow strong in their own openness. Diverse open selves united on the common ideal of an open society of open selves can defend, celebrate, and enhance their own and each other's uniqueness.  

# Planning for Freedom  

An ideal imposes the responsibility for its progressive actualization. A culture attains unity only as it creates institutional agencies which implant its directing ideal into the social character of its members and which satisfy those aspirations which it has implanted.  

The open society will come only as it is worked for, planned for, trained for, fought for. There is no other way it will come. Man cannot now escape deliberate culture-making. Deliberate planning for the closed society is the danger of the day. Widespread anxieties throughout our society encourage this form of planning. Drift is no alternative. To drift is to renounce the human task of man-making. The only effective alternative is deliberate planning for the open society, planning which will remove the basic frustrations and anxieties which otherwise lead to social closure, planning to prevent the power to dominate society, planning to maintain and strengthen open selves, planning for freedom.  

It is of the utmost importance that this point be driven home. Planning is inherent in the making of our selves and our society. Social planning is now inescapable. To plan or not to plan is no longer the issue. The only relevant issue is whether to plan for the closed or the open society.  

The urgency of this decision is obscured by those who insist that all planning leads to the closed society. To label planning the road to serfdom is to fall victim to the most vicious semantic confusion of our time, if indeed it is not to deliberately  

nourish such confusion in order to retain one's own privileged status in society. For to evade the responsibility of planning for the open society is to accentuate the basic anxieties of today which if unrelieved lead inevitably to the closed society.  

There are two roads to serfdom. One is to plan serfdom. The other is not to plan to remove the conditions which lead to serfdom. Those who counsel us not to plan fail to distinguish between the kind of planning which leads to the closed society, and the kind of planning which issues in the open society. The difference between these kinds of planning is known to every parent and every child. There are parents who plan in detail the lives their children are to lead. There are other parents who attempt to secure for their children the conditions under which they can build effectively their own lives. The difference is as simple as that, and as important. If we do not grasp it, we are indeed in the gravest danger.  

The planning which is appropriate to the open society consists in creating those institutions, and permitting only those institutions, which support the open self. The ideal of the open society imposes on us the obligation to choose those means which advance the ideal, and to discard all others. The ideal gives us the standard by which every social institution is to be judged. Every social agency is good which makes the persons it affects more able to build continuously for themselves a creative life, and more willing and able to help others do the same. Every social agency is bad which closes the selves of the persons it affects and so makes possible the closing of society. The ideal of an open society of open selves gives direction to social action. It does not give specific solutions. It gives incentive and criterion, not ready-made answers.  

An analogy may help. Science is a miniature example of the open society, and an instructive model. The unity of the members of the scientific community lies in their acceptance  

of a common ideal—the ideal of reliable knowledge. Those methods which lead to such knowledge are acceptable procedures, indeed they constitute what is meant by scientific methods. As such methods are attained they are taught to young scientists and become part of their social character as members of the scientific community. But because the sole sanction of these methods lies in their status as means to secure reliable knowledge, the social character of the scientist remains relatively open—at least as scientist. He is trained so as to be able to follow truth in his own way, and to substitute new methods for old when such methods are better means to the guiding ideal of reliable knowledge.  

The open society of open selves is similar to the community of scientists. Its goal, however, is wider. Its goal is the fullest possible satisfaction of all human motivations, and not merely man's interest in reliable knowledge. Its methods are not limited to those which advance truth. But like science it will train its members in the techniques so far found to be effective in keeping persons creative, and train them to find new techniques which will be more effective than any yet tried.  

The open society can have no over-all blueprint for the future. Planning for freedom is diametrically opposed to planning for the closed society. Where the latter will plan to control the agencies of communication, the supply of food, and the sources of anxiety so as to produce fearsome, conforming, and constricted selves, the open society will plan to extend knowledge and skill and means of subsistence so that each member of society becomes to the limit of his or her ability a mobile, autonomous, spontaneous initiator. For the closed society persons are instruments to be used in order to gain power; for the open society persons are ends and social agencies are means to personal growth. The open society is a person-centered society. It aims to increase in each individual the  

ability to become a self-maker and a culture-maker. Its planning is the preparation of the social conditions which nourish and sustain the creative individual.  

The open society needs not merely the unity of its ideal but the unity of institutions which embody the methods so far found to be effective in actualizing its ideal. The essential feature of these agencies lies in the fact that they must be self-corrective, effective, flexible. In this respect the methods of the open society are like the methods of science. But science does more than provide an analogy. The methods of science will themselves be methods by which the open society improves and corrects its existing institutions. For if social institutions are means to open selfhood, we must choose them according to their effectiveness in reaching this personalized goal. It is by the methods of science that this effectiveness can be ascertained. Science provides a major method for controlling the agencies of the open society.  

The open society will courageously meet its problems as they appear. It will be constantly on the alert to remedy frustrations, blockages, anxieties in its members. It will prevent all attempts of individuals and groups to capture society for their own particular purposes. It will make available to ever more individuals ever more effective means for keeping themselves open selves and their society an open society. Its unity will lie in acceptance of scientifically certified institutions dedicated to its person-centered ideal.  

A society can remain open only by working to remain so. Persons can remain open only by joining with others to keep society open. "He that leadeth into captivity shall go into captivity." Ahead of us lies a freedom greater than men have ever dreamed or a slavery greater than men have ever endured. The choice is ours to make.  

# Freedom or Frustration?  

YES, THE BEST THINGS TOO TEND TO CLOSURE. American verve, for instance. Now as in the past. Abraham Lincoln warned in 1859 against "the miners and sappers of returning despotism." They are becoming strong again, so strong in fact that the very face of America's future is once more veiled. "The coming battle for America and for civilization" has already come. We now confront the same ordeal in our culture which has elsewhere led to various forms of the closed society. The recent war against the Axis was in a way easier than the struggle we now enter. For we ourselves are the combatants in the present psychological warfare of the Black and the White. The opposed forces of frustration and freedom, of closure and openness, draw their weapons from the arsenals of our own anxieties and our own aspirations. The enemy is in ourselves. And our strength is in ourselves.  

We have not used the term "democracy." The avoidance was deliberate. For all sweet words are soured by misuse. "Democracy" has become a strongly appraisive term, designatively unclear. To call oneself democratic is now as unrevealing, and as inevitable, as for politicians to be photographed with babies. We have been told by one who ought to know  

that when fascism conquers America it will do so in the name of democracy. In fact, whatever is now done in America—or elsewhere on the earth—will be done in the name of democracy. So we need to talk concretely. None of the grandiose labels we bandy about is of much value today. The actual problems of the contemporary world are not helped by invoking such overworked words as "individualism," "socialism," "capitalism," "liberalism," "communism," "fascism," "democracy." These terms are loaded appraisals. Each culture, and each group, will use them to its own advantage. If we were to use the term "democracy" designatively it would be synonymous with the phrase "open society of open selves." But since we have this more exact phrase, and since no labels are sacred or indispensable, we can dispense with the word "democracy."  

Nevertheless, what we have been talking about is in essence the dominant theme in the American tradition. For what was historically unique in the founding of this Nation was the conception of an open society of open selves. The new thing under the American social sun was the resolve that there was to be a community of open selves with the implements to remain open, and to keep society open. This has been the novel and germinal ideal of the American tradition, and each generation has fought victoriously in its name against the forces which tended to close American society at the stage it had so far reached.  

# The Root of Grandeur  

Our men of letters have held before us the belief that a new type of person was to appear among us. Whitman told us in Democratic Vistas that "we must entirely recast the types of highest personality from what the oriental, feudal, ecclesiastical worlds bequeath us"; "now there shall be a man  

cohered out of tumult and chaos." Melville complained in Mardi that "we have had vast developments of parts of men but not of any wholes," and in Pierre proclaimed a new man of "nimble center, circumference elastic." This is the Mai-treyan note in our historic ideal, the deep root which nourishes Path 7.  

And yet along with this vision has always gone the championing of plurality, the acceptance of what Whitman called "the modern composite nation, formed from all, with room for all." Emerson in the essay Nature counseled the reader, "Build . . . your own world." And Thoreau in Walden wrote: "I desire that there be as many different persons in the world as possible; but I would have each one be very careful to find out and pursue his own way . . . " No one type of personality ideal was to dominate the open society, not even the ideal of tensioned and multiple man toward which Emerson, Whitman, Melville, and Thoreau strode, each with his own distinctive gait.  

The political thought and institutional agencies of this country aimed to objectify the ideal of an open society of open selves. The recognition of the "natural rights" of the individual which society was to protect gave both the content of a common ideal and the recognition of the task which government must fulfil. Life—the right of each to be. Liberty—the right of each to the instruments of self-making. The pursuit of happiness—the right of each to seek his or her own pattern of life. We have given a scientific equivalent for such rights in uncovering stubborn biological and temperamental differences between individuals which persist in various cultures and which in any culture insist upon satisfaction. Only through recognition that a person is not completely the product of society can there be any ground for protecting persons  

against the arbitrariness of a given society. Those who talk as if the self is "social" only, consciously or unconsciously aid the closed society. The admission of deep-seated biological differences and similarities between persons can do for us in our day what the doctrine of natural rights did in its. It gives us—to use a phrase of Moholy-Nagy—a biological bill of rights.  

To protect the common rights of different persons, church was separated from state, so that no one personality ideal could be imposed on all as a condition for citizenship. A system of checks and balances between legislative, executive, and judicial institutions was designed to prevent governmental power from being captured by any one governmental agency. A bill of rights was established to protect the individual against arbitrary governmental action. By land grants to settlers, by a system of free education, by extension of the suffrage, by a war against slavery, by campaigns against monopolies, by guaranteeing free communication, by food and drug laws to protect health, by the regulation of the hours of labor, by an income tax to prevent unlimited concentration of wealth, by acts to strengthen economic security, the government of the people by the people for the people has worked at its task of protecting the individual from exploitation by other individuals and furnishing him with the instruments needed for his growth. These are great strides toward an open society of open selves. They are forms of American planning. Each has been bitterly contested. It is heartening that however hard the struggle no large issue has been lost! A multiple society has walked on multiple legs. Our federal society is the social analogue of our federal self. Each moves forward in the same way. Each seeks and finds its unity in the dynamic integration of its multiplicity.  

The philosophy we have defended is itself coined in the mint of American philosophic activity. Charles Peirce stood for the close linkage of philosophy and science, and for the central place of semantics in philosophical activity. William James insisted upon the importance of individual differences and the responsibility of men for the making of their individual and social lives. George Mead hammered home the crucial role of language in the development and advancement of the self, and he above all others wrote out the philosophy of objective relativism. John Dewey has resolutely championed scientific method as the key instrument now to be brought to bear upon the personal and social problems of modern man. Each of these points of view has entered upon our pages.  

Our literature, our social ideals, our political institutions, our philosophy voice a common aspiration: the ideal of an open society of open selves. The unity that they seek is a unity founded upon and inclusive of multiplicity: e pluribus unum! We have expressed and defended this same aspiration by an analysis of human nature. Even the view of man which we have sketched is largely a coordination of the insights of American psychologists, sociologists, and anthropologists. Our talk has been American straight-talk.  

# Something Is Radically Wrong with Us  

That all is not well with us is evidenced by the anxiety, the frustrations, the monotony, the indecision, the loss of resiliency which periodically threaten the American people, and which today threaten to become catastrophic. The Surgeon General has recently told us that 8,000,000 Americans have mental disorders "in some degree." And in the post-war years there has been an alarming lack of clarity and in  

ventiveness in the conduct of our domestic and foreign affairs. In the words of Charles Merriam, "we literally stand at the gates of an age of plenty, key in hand, fumbling at the lock." The leadership which large areas of the earth expect of us appears only in fits and starts. For every step forward we take a step backward. The forces of closure are becoming stronger. Something is radically wrong with us. What? A permanent decline of verve? Or a temporary failure of nerve?  

The psychological phase of the problem is to explain how we citizens of Plainville U.S.A. are dominated by a relentless struggle for wealth and prestige and yet disclose a deep sense of inadequacy even in our success. A clue lies in the recognition that wealth and social position are forms of power, or at least symbols of power. That wealth and social position are central American pursuits suggests at once that the quest for power has become the dominant motivation in the American social character. The fact that even those who attain such power often show profound dissatisfaction suggests that the socially sanctioned goal of power does not fit our full selves. The question then is how the goal of wealth and prestige came to be central in the American social character, and why it today proves more and more unsatisfactory and suspect.  

Power is dominance, and dominance is preeminently the motivation of the mesomorph. The social character of our culture has been largely formed by mesomorphs. That this occurred is due to the fact that the first difficult migrations to this country, and the physical labor needed in the conquest of the new environment, filled the land at the outset with mesomorphs. Domination, not dependence or detachment, was the trait necessary to explore and to develop a new and northern continent. We advanced the great mesomorphic thrust of Western man. The traits of mesomorphic leaders, given to  

domination, became the accepted personality ideal of the new country; in shaping its social agencies such leaders shaped the social character of its inhabitants. Courage, strength, resourcefulness, adventuresomeness, independence, confidence became the desirable personality traits, and wealth and prestige their rewards. Our country was built largely by the mesomorph, and his traits of character became the accepted social ideal of what a person should be.  

This still is true, but with important changes. For as time passed our population grew more diversified. Partly because mesomorphs do not have only mesomorphic children. Partly because as the environment was brought under control it could attract a more diversified array of settlers. An easier life exercised less rigorous selection towards mesomorphy upon the newcomers and upon the newly born. Endomorphs and ectomorphs became more numerous among us. And the mesomorphic social character into which they were trained, and toward which they strived, was not satisfying, though they did not know why. Success in competition for power did not come as easily to them. Anxieties and frustrations increased. Deviants became more common. A new and unrecognized kind of minority was beginning to appear among us—a psychological minority. That men low in mesomorphy have their difficulties in our society is clear: they make up a large proportion of the male population of our asylums.  

Even the mesomorph among us has his wounds, and is in need of salvage. The greater the number of persons who share a single personality ideal, the greater is competition—and frustration. As time passed power became concentrated in fewer hands and the access to power more limited. More and more mesomorphs became laborers for other persons, cogs of industry, tools of someone else's power. Fewer spent a  

muscled day of their own decision. The traits of courage and adventuresomeness and independence became harder to maintain even for mesomorphs, and the rewards of wealth and prestige harder to secure. But the ideals remained unchanged. So the struggle for their attainment became more intense. Less time for love and receptivity, less time for meditation and reflection, less direct satisfying use of the mesomorphic body. More sternness, more unrelenting push, more concern with the signs of power, more symbolic mesomorphy. Money becomes something to get, whatever the psychological price, because money buys the signs of power if not its actuality. So even the mesomorphs pay a price. For most of them the price is high. Compulsive domineering aggression is mesomorphy gone wrong, mesomorphy exaggerated, self-betrayed, and ill at ease. The manics and the paranoiacs in our midst exhibit the results for open inspection. Some of these find their way into asylums, but they are so much at home in our culture that it is hard to spot them or to keep them institutionalized very long. The mesomorphic man of wealth who would by a turn of his thumb wipe out New York City shows that dissatisfaction reaches even those who have won the coveted prizes of money and prestige. The average citizen of Plainville manifests his distress in subtler ways, in envy, in fear of innovation, in an exaggerated sense of righteousness, in refusal to talk about himself—even to himself.  

Mesomorphic women in our culture carry a double burden. For the mesomorphic male carries his will to power into love. A wife is to be among his possessions, something to protect, to reflect his glory, a visible symbol of his success. And Miss Plainville is tempted to play this part, for it too is a way to gain wealth and social position. The ideal of the aggressive man and the receptive woman, trained into the young boy and  

girl, has become part of the social character of both sexes. Yet it does fundamental violence to the fact that the differences between women run the whole gamut of bodily and temperamental types, and are much greater than the over-all differences between men and women. This stereotyping of the transactions between the sexes punishes the man low in mesomorphy, but especially the woman high in mesomorphy. It is one major cause of the sexual anxiety and distress in our culture to which psychiatrists continually testify.  

The mesomorphic woman is eagerly responsive to the socially approved power-success-prestige ideal and yet she is simultaneously indoctrinated with the ideal of passive femininity. In the resulting conflict she often launches out aggressively against the social role traditionally assigned to her. It is not surprising that it was a strongly mesomorphic girl that wanted to ride in a plane to atom-bomb this scene of her distress. Partly out of revenge, partly by temperament, the mesomorphic woman may want her "man" to play the feminine passive role she rejects. This drives the mesomorphic man away from her. At the same time the cultural picture of men as the "dominant" sex makes it difficult for even the less dominating men to accept a receptive attitude before her. No wonder she finds herself in a quandary. No wonder that women psychotics are as a group above average in mesomorphy.  

The mesomorphic woman is not the "lost sex," and it is ill service to her to tell her to be femininely receptive. She simply illustrates in a peculiarly vivid form the tension which comes when there is too great a divergence between individual and social character. The man low in mesomorphy is in just as tight a fix. Neither is lost. Both are victims. We—collectively—are to blame.  

# Diagnosis and Prescription  

We now know the answer to Thomas Wolfe's query: "Where did we go wrong?" Our error was not that we went mesomorphic and sought power. That was inevitable in a country of mesomorphic pioneers. Our error was that we went whole hog in this one direction, and so denied the endomorphy and ectomorphy in ourselves, and much of our mesomorphy as well. The needs for dependence and detachment were thwarted as the need for domination ran wild. In the resulting heightened competition for wealth and status the praiseworthy need for power—for the sense of conquest, adventure, mastery—has become corrupted, anxious, compulsive, possessive. Even the mesomorph's ring is roped in too narrowly, and his fight becomes mere shadow-boxing for the symbols of power. It has taken time for this result to work itself out historically. Now it stares us in the face. We are in danger of becoming little men fighting the shadows of our earlier robust selves.  

Our fault lay in allowing the personality ideal of a single type of person to become our national social character. In doing this we jeopardized our historic cultural ideal of a society open to all kinds of persons. An unsuspected tyranny over the mind of man slipped in past our Jeffersonian defences. And the frustrations imposed on all persons except a few mesomorphs have had social consequences disastrous even to most mesomorphs. In developing agencies to protect different religions and different social and economic minorities we failed to develop strategies to protect psychological minorities. We praised flexibility, diversity, and inventiveness but institutionalized monotony, uniformity, and sterility. Publicly we shout loudly our achievements. Secretly we are ashamed of ourselves.  

The way we train our children reflects and perpetuates our own anxieties. Every little Johnny—however endomorphic or ectomorphic—is to be a full-of-power "man." Every little Mary—however mesomorphic—is to be a receptive "woman." These stereotypes are drilled mercilessly into Johnny and Mary. Ruth Herschberger, in Adam's Rib, has shown incisively and in detail how this is done in the realm of sex, and its disastrous results when Johnny and Mary venture forth to try life together.  

The training for sexual inflexibility, compulsiveness, and sterility which we give to our young is repeated in later phases of their development. I happened to notice some drawings made by a slender ectomorphic young man in one of our state institutions for the insane. They aroused my curiosity. It turned out that he had been wheedled by an aggressive mesomorphic father to give up the "unmanly" life of an artist in order to work in his father's business—under his father's domination. A mesomorphic wife added her repeated demands that he earn more money, and still more money. The asylum was his answer. A dead-end street. But a place where he could draw unmolested, even if not well.  

In the same institution was a former All-American football player, big, powerful—and manic. He had found it hard to step from the spotlighted pedestal for national heroes to the routine of an undramatic but respectable career. His mania was his rebellion. It took six men to hold him in his times of fury.  

We cannot with impunity ignore our different individual needs. We must utilize individually and as a nation all human resources. The distinction between individual and social character, between a personality ideal and a social ideal, will help clear up one source of our confusion. We can with perfect consistency be very different as individuals and yet agree in  

aspiration and action on the kind of society we want to sustain and build. What we need to hold in common is not some single personality ideal but the ideal of a person-centered society strong and cooperative in its diversity.  

Nothing could be more boring or more sterile than a society in which all of us would have the same thoughts, the same ambitions, the same routines, the same rewards, and the same frustrations. Monotony is to Americans an unacceptable form of unity.  

# America in Mortal Danger  

The widespread chasm in many individuals between how they are trying to live and how they ought to live explains in part the stubborn crust of anxiety and hypocrisy and ineffectiveness in a country where seven percent of the earth's population has become the most powerful nation on earth. Power and anxiety are dangerous partners. They may seek protection and relief in social closure, and threaten the advance toward the open society of open selves which alone has given America its distinction and its direction. Power and anxiety teamed together generate the most virulent of all forms of possessiveness. It is this national possessiveness which is our mortal peril.  

The seriousness of this danger, under present world conditions, cannot be exaggerated. For the widespread anxiety among our endomorphs, mesomorphs, and ectomorphs alike means that all the conditions which generate the modern closed society are among us.  

Three large goals stand before us, large enough for anyone to see. We may simply become a staleated, sterile, possessive, ineffective people, locked in internal tensions—a "catatonic," "mixed-psychotic" America lost in its inability to focus its  

multiple resources. We may repeat in our own way recent versions of the totalitarian society, repressing our domestic problems instead of meeting them, throwing our power around the world to become a hated and feared modern Rome. We may by concerted endeavor break with Grecian joy the hardening crust to become the living image of the open society of open selves.  

The first of these goals is the least likely. We are too mesomorphic, nationally too powerful, and the world too interlocked, to permit us to stew indefinitely in our own juices.  

The second goal is much more probable. A closed America would save us from the difficult task of admitting that anything is wrong with us, and the even more difficult task of righting what is wrong. We have seen that it is hard for the closed self to admit its distress, to discard its defensive masks, to devise new techniques for its greater satisfaction. Its tendency is rather to cover up its problems, to clutch tighter its partial satisfactions, to turn in fury on those who propose the slightest change. It is this danger which now threatens the vitality of the American heritage, the danger of holding on to what we have attained instead of daring to actualize what we are by tradition and in aspiration.  

The temptation to closure might work itself out somewhat in this manner. Nothing would be done to reduce realistically the underlying frustrations and anxieties in our midst. Any attempt to reformulate existing ideals or to improve existing social techniques would be condemned as "un-American." By a control of the agencies of mass-communication the status quo would be glorified and identified with the American ideal. Any deviation from it would be resisted as treason to freedom and democracy. As time went on and unmet problems sharpened in intensity, those groups which demanded an improve  

ment of their situation would talk more pointedly of the need for drastic change. This would heighten anxiety, and more and more repressive measures would be invoked to preserve order. At this point a war with an outside power would be in the making, or at least the threat of war, to silence opposition and to capture the loyalties of the people. By invoking the symbols of nationalism, the individual would be forced to identify himself with the movement to the closed society or be branded as a traitor to his people. Under the threat of modern total war, total control of society would become inevitable.  

The seductive lure of this already discernible and far from impossible American version of the closed society lies in the fact that it would for the moment give satisfaction to a number of attitudes which compete for our allegiance. It would offer the endomorph social belongingness, the mesomorph social adventure, the ectomorph social idealism. It would satisfy the Apollo in us by giving the sense of social order and stability at home; it would give the Prometheus in us the excitement of extending his power abroad; it would give the Christ in us the sense of saving the Christian-Democratic heritage. But this closure of our society would actually close the selves of endomorph, mesomorph, and ectomorph alike. It would break the harp of Apollo, chain Prometheus once more to the rock, and crucify Christ again. Under the name of defending the American heritage we would have repudiated this heritage. We would have betrayed ourselves and the peoples of the earth who look to us for leadership to freedom.  

The alternative to a paralyzed stalemate America and to a Romanized imperialistic America is an America rededicated to its traditional ideal of an open society of open selves and resolutely at work to reduce the anxieties which if unrelieved tend to the closed society. That, and that alone, is our way out.  

# "For the Time Is at Hand"  

The danger of America is not senility but sterility. Our dilemma lies not in a paucity of human resources but in our failure to use courageously our variegated human abundance. It is not our tradition which has failed us but the betrayers and plunderers of our tradition. The issue we need to fear is that of leaving unachieved what we have so proudly and so greatly begun.  

It is not that the whole future of mankind depends on us. We are big—but so were the dinosaurs. Arnold Toynbee, in A Study of History, has filled his pages with examples of great cultures that have spent themselves in a creative act, failed to arise in a new crisis to new creation, and destroyed themselves through their inflexible possessiveness. It is of course possible that we, as the spearhead of Western man's mesomorphic adventure, have reached the limit of our thrust. Perhaps the West of which we are a part has so specialized itself on power that it will destroy itself by the power it has produced but cannot control. If so we will join the museum of cultural dinosaurs. This would not be the end of man. The Orient is again prophetic, and might well draw back into its diversified human basin the power techniques gained by a West that humanly failed. There are still many cards in mankind's deck, and we of the West do not hold all the aces.  

But it is premature to celebrate our own death. That is not an American custom. We are much more responsive to the warrior words: "We haven't begun to fight!" If we have reared a power technology, we have also sung the new songs of man with nimble center, circumference elastic, and of a society open to all selves. We have not talked power alone, and our anxiety in the face of wealth and social status is evidence that there is more to us than we have privately admitted. Per  

haps we have not yet had time to harness our physical power to our human ideal. Perhaps if we shake ourselves out of our coma we will find that we still command the nerve, the verve, the courage, and the inventiveness to carry through what we as a nation have begun.  

The new American frontier is human rather than geographical. It lies wherever an American meets another person, young or old, white or yellow or brown or black, inside our borders or beyond them. Pioneering on the domestic frontier and on the international frontier are now inextricably linked. To lose either campaign is to lose them both. We cannot stand before the world as the champion of freedom and slay it at home. We cannot renounce domestic social reconstruction without undermining our efforts to aid other cultures in their own forms of advance.  

The new American frontier marks our responsibility and our opportunity. We need our endomorphs to keep us humanly warm, our ectomorphs to keep us humanly sensitive, and our mesomorphs to keep us humanly bold and adventure-some. On this frontier we can advance together. Here we can use all of ourselves.  

On the domestic frontier our responsibility is to oppose every force which makes for the closed society and to create with fresh inventiveness the cultural conditions which sustain and extend the open self. Our most urgent necessity is to distinguish between the social agencies necessary to further the liberation of individuals and those which in the name of freedom lead to impoverishment of individuality. Both will invoke democratic slogans, but one will encourage and the other obstruct the growth of persons. To keep free the agencies of mass-communication so that free trade in ideas is possible, to control food so that hunger cannot be made a political weapon  

—regulations of this sort are agencies of a person-centered society just as their opposites are agencies of a person-exploitative society. Only foresight, inventiveness, action can keep our society open. Each of our major institutions—business, labor, the farmers, the schools, the churches, and the government—must assume responsibility for such foresight, inventiveness, and action. Those who today fail to see this point or refuse to see it, or label as un-American those who do see it, stab the American tradition in its heart—even though they punctuate every sentence they utter with the words “democracy” and “liberty.”  

On the international frontier problems of population, the world food supply, health, the development of backward areas of the earth demand, and are leading to, the invention of new international agencies. It is possible for different cultures to keep their uniqueness and yet to cooperate on their common problems. A diversified mankind can find unity in the integration and the celebration of its cultural differences. Men will yet live at home and be citizens of the earth.  

At the present threshold of the new epoch, the prevention of total war is the central problem. Modern scientific war has become too humanly destructive to be tolerated. For those who choose fighting for its own sake we might set aside annually a large region for an annual war—a real war, to the death! But for modern man in general, modern war is a cancerous growth which saps the blood of free men and free societies.  

Einstein and his fellow-scientists have banded together to warn us that modern warfare is fatal to modern culture, and the military men acknowledge this truth. General Dwight D. Eisenhower's words should be emphatic enough: "The governments of the world will find some way to substitute the council table for the battlefield or within the measurable future  

civilization as we know it will cease to exist.” Hysteria, self-righteousness, and calling names will not save us. Nor the atom-bomb. Nor the enjoyment of the bees and butterflies of our individual selves. Our social inventiveness must embrace and outpace our physical inventions. If it does not, the people of other continents may still have a chance to do better. Otherwise it is up from the apes again—if indeed we have left enough apes alive to begin again the arduous climb to man.  

# Summons to Create  

If we can with courage and inventiveness break the crust of our anxious stalemate by a bold reconstruction of our individual selves and by a bold attack on our national problems we can be to the world an example of the open society at work. If we support the forces which make for openness in other cultures, they will in their own ways rally to openness. If we overcome the fear of being our larger selves we shall have nothing to fear from others. Cold, hungry, anxious persons inevitably prefer economic security to psychological freedom. If we show men and women by our example and by our help that they need not make this choice, that they can have—increasingly—both security and freedom, and in their own ways, they will choose inevitably to have both. No nation will long be able to keep this double abundance from its people if they know that it can be theirs. Do we Americans mean what we have said we meant? Do we dare to be as forward-looking as we have said we are? Are we big in creativity—or only a dinosaur? Not human history, but the next decades of human history depend on our action's answer.  

An exciting unplumbed epoch opens before us. Our inventors and scientists and philosophers and prophets have not let us down. The technology which we have humanly mishandled  

can serve human ends. The science of man can give us the knowledge of ourselves which we need to build ourselves. We are equipped with the instruments to enter upon the epoch of deliberate man-making. We have individually our own personal ideal of open selfhood. We have in common the social ideal of an open society. Our task is not to predict the future of mankind but to join in making it.  

We alone stand in our own way. The danger is that we will sell out, lose our nerve, let possessiveness stifle our creativeness, refuse to assume our responsibility toward ourselves and toward our fellow-men, mutter ancient incantations, move to closure.  

The key with which we are fumbling at the lock of the future has two prongs—atomic energy and human verve. If our heart is light and our hand bold we can yet open the door.  

The Prometheus in man has again kindled the fire of untapped physical energy and unused human resources. If we betray and repudiate this heritage of fire, others will yet live in its warmth and its might. We are not mankind.  

Yet I have great faith in this America. I believe it will grow strong in crisis. I cherish its diversity, its gay surface, its long will, its play-the-game-well nonchalance. I believe Americans will keep it bold and young. Thousands of them dedicated to their task will turn the key.  

We must now separate to our separate ways. To hold you longer would be possessive! And even a book which opposes closure must be brought to some kind of termination!  

But before we go apart, let us dare again together our confession:  

We will regain integrity.  

We will blast apart our stalemate.  

We will use our scientists.  

We will use our artists and our prophets.  

We will think in terms of the whole earth.  

We will reform our ideals.  

We will resume the responsibility for man-making.  

We will not sell out.  

We will carry through what we have begun.  

On parting, a symbol—a "post-language symbol," if you can remember that far back in our book. I had written myself through the night into the dawn. This morning, in tired joy, I walked through the early sun to the Hudson river where Whitman rode the ferries and Melville endured in work. Down the street a little girl of six was playing in tireless joy with a discarded crate. She pulled it, climbed inside it, climbed over it, rolled it over, hit it, talked to it, tugged at its loose boards in a frenzy of adequacy and excitement.  

When I tried to tease her by saying that the crate would surely not hold together long under such pummeling, she came back strong. She tiptoed up to me with an elfish smile on her impish face, and cupping her hands around her mouth she whispered her joyful secret: "I have another one!"  

As I walked on I noticed that the first signs of spring had come. The first buds. The first returning birds. The wild for-everness of spring . . .

# A Note on The Author  

For the past several years, Charles Morris has been engaged in a psychological study, sponsored by the Rockefeller Foundation, of American character traits. Before this, he has also been a recipient of a Guggenheim award. Associate professor of philosophy at the University of Chicago and lecturer at the New School for Social Research, he is working toward a synthesis of psychology, religion, and philosophy of life.  

Dr. Morris is active in philosophical organizations (he is a former president of the Western Division of the American Philosophical Society), and is an associate editor of the International Encyclopedia of Unified Science. He has written two earlier books: Paths of Life and Signs, Language and Behavior, which The Philosophical Review called "one of the most stimulating discussions of topics in the philosophy of language to have appeared in many years."  

As this book is published, he is on an extended tour of the Far East — China and India — to undertake at first hand a comparative study of oriental religions.  

The theme of this book is that only a way of living which may be adjusted to a variety of temperaments can result in healthy souls and well-balanced minds. Such a path of life, developed through a man's background and education and influenced by his reading, will determine his judgment of the people he meets, his aims in life and his actions, and will thus exercise a decisive influence on his fate.  

Dr. Morris points out that our contemporary ideology favors the man of action at the expense of the contemplative man and the seeker for social and aesthetic harmony. The author sees in this situation, inherited from Colonial times, a serious danger both to the individual and to the American people as a whole.
