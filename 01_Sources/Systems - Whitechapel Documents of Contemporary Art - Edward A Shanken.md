# Documents of Contemporqry Art  

Irr recent decades artists have progressively expanded the boundaries o[ art as thcy have sought to engage with an increasingly pluralistic environment. li'.rching, curating and understanding of art and visual culture are likewise no longer grounded in traditional aesthetics but centred on significant ideas, topics .urcl themes ranging from the everyday to the uncanny, the psychoanalytical to tlrc political.  

The Documents of Contemporary Art series emerges from this context. Each volurre focuses on a specific subject or body of writing that has been of [<ey irr fluence in contemporary art internationally. Edited and introduced by a scholar, ,u tist, critic or curator, each of these source books provides access to a plurality ol voices and perspectives defining a significant theme or tendency.  

For over a century the Whitechapel Callery has offered a public platlorm for ,u t .lnd ideas. In the same spirit, each guest editor represents a distinctyet diverse ,rl)Proach - rather than one institutional position or school ofthought - and has ( once ived each volume to address not only a prolessional audience but all irrlt'rested readers.  

We are now in ransition from an object-oriented to systems-oriented culture. Here change emanates not from things but from the way things are done

# Edwqrd A. Shqnken Introduction//Systems Thinking/Systems Art  

A dream of technical control and of instant information conveyed at unthought-of velocities haunted Sixties culture. The wired, electronic outlines ofa cybernetic society became apparent to the visual imagination - an immediate future... drastically modernized by the impact of computer science. It was a technologically utopian structure of feeling, positivistic and 'scientistic'.r  

As the epigraph above suggests, systems theory and cybernetics were not limited to science and engineering but penetrated deeply into the arts and culture. The screaming electronic feedback of Jimi Hendrix's guitar at Woodstock (1966) appropriated the US National Anthem as a counter-cultural battle cry. Steina and Woody Vasull<a used all manner and combination of audio and video signals to generate electronic feedback, which they conceived of as a new artistic medium: 'We look at video feedback as electronic art material . .. It's the clay, it's the air, it's theenergy,it'sthestone...it'stherawmaterialthatyou...buildanimagewith...' (see section 2: Cybernetic Art, Architecture and Design)2 Les Levine described his interactive video installation Contact: ACyberneticSculpture(1969) as'... a system that synthesizes man with his technology... the people are the software.'The 'personality'of this'responsive mechanism', he continued,'reflects the attitudes of ' the viewers ... The circuit is open.'3 Art criticJack Burnham described how 'we are nowintransitionfrom anobject-oientedtoasystems-oientedculture. Herechange emanates, not from fhings, but from fhe way things are done' (section 3: Sysfems Aesthetics). Artist and theorist Roy Ascott echoed those sentiments: 'Today we ate concerned less with the essence of things than with their behaviour; not what they are but what they do. This [...] vision of our time is ultimately cybernetic' (section 2). These experiments and attitudes represent some early foundations of the artistic explorations of systems. But the cultural significance of cybernetics is not limited to the 1960s. Although by the late 1970s it had become so ingrained and ubiquitous as to be almost invisible, it has persisted and grown for over half a century and is still going strong. Artists and scholars continue to respond with remarkable creativity and vision to emerging fields of systems-oriented science. Lil<e their precursors, they are grappling with and deploying successive waves of technological media and corresponding social practices in ways that expand perception and cognition. In doing so tlrey offer far-reaching insights into the systemic interrelatedness of all things. They demonstrate, moreover, the importance of integrative thinl<ing and artistic forms of l<nowledge production  

, rrrt I r r ilicluc in a global economy fuelled by the algorithmic processing of big data, rrr wlrit h wcalth is generated by Google Adsense clicks, government surveillance is rr'.rr lrirrg Orwellian proportions, and global warming is creating extreme weather r orrrliliorrs that threaten cities and ecosystems.  

l)t'spile the current state of affairs, the impact of systems theory and rylrr,r rrt'tics on all aspects of human endeavour is difficult to estimate - or ovcrcstinr.rte. And one hopes that evolved forms of systems analysis will provide l)r ,lr'nl tools that can help correct some of the global perils resulting from an rrvlrly rr.rrrow conceptual frameworl< that cannot see the forest for the trees. Irrrlr'r'rl, since the mid 1990s, numerous factors (including advances in ronrprrt.r[ionaI science, networking and visualization that facilitated the ',rnrrrl.rtior.r of complex systems) led researchers to refocus attention explicitly on ',v',1('nrs theory and cybernetics, generating artistic and scholarly reappraisal and lrrrtlrcr elaboration. The growing number of art exhibitions and academic ;rrrlrlit.rtions on the topic since the mid 2000s demonstrates an ongoing fascination wrllr ils.resthetic, intellectual and scientific history, as well as its contemporary ,rrirrilit'.rrce in understanding current problems and modelling potential futures.  

llt'lirre returning to the importance of systems thinkinga for the arts, some lrr',tolic.rl background on systems theory and cybernetics will be helpful. Biologist lrrrlwig von Bertalanffu first proposed general systems theory in the 1930s as an ,rppro,rclr [o understanding open systems (ones that continuously interact with tlr,'ir t'nvironment or surroundings). Systenrs theory emphasizes holism over r,'rlrrr tionism, organism over mechanism and process over product. In contrast to t r , rr lit rorra I western scientific approaches to knowledge, it shifts attention from the .rlr,,olrrtc qualities of individual parts and addresses the organization of the whole r r n rorc r-elativistic terms, as a dynamic process of interaction among constituent .['nrt'nts. The broadly interdisciplinary field of cybernetics offered a rigorous t,,r lrrrit.rl foundation for systems theory, and became synonymous with it.  

I lrt' f irst wave of cybernetics focused on how systems could maintain a steady .t,rtr' (lromeostasis) through feedback loops, which enabled self-regulation. For ''-,,rnl)lc, self-regulating control mechanisms consisting of feedback loops rrr. rrrrl,rin hr-rman body temperature at 98.6 degrees Fahrenheit (37 degrees Celsius). ', rrrr rl.rr ly.r home thermostat measures and responds to fluctuations in temperature, trrlrit'r irrg the climate control system to either heat or cool interior air in order to rr,rrrl,rilr the desired temperature. Drawing on engineer Warren Weaver's l, rrrrrrrl.rtiorr of Information Theory, cybernetics established a science of control ,rrrrl t onrnrunication that applied to the apparent goal-seeking behaviour ofboth rrrrrn,rls.rnd machines. In this regard, cybernetics was vital to, and enriched by, ,',rr lV rt'se.rrcl.r on artificial intelligence and robotics. lt supplied a theoretical model r, rorrstr-Llc[ and to control mechanical systems that exhibit life-like behaviours, for example the McCulloch-Pitts' artificial neuron, Grey Walter's autonomous robotic'tortoises', and Ross Ashby's Homeostat, all of which were presented at the field's fertile breeding ground, the annual Macy Conferences held in New Yorl< between 1946 and 1953. Participants represented in this volume include Weaver and his colleague Claude Shannon, anthropologist Gregory Bateson, physicist Heinz von Foerster and mathematician Norbert Wiener. Wiener coined the term 'cybernetics' from the Greek root for 'governor' and played an important role in defining the field through his influential scientific and popular publications.  

The second wave of cybernetics, championed by von Foerster, insisted on including the observer as an inextricable part of the system - a second order phenomenon - thus introducing a radical sense of reflexivity. Scientists were recognized as active participants in their own scientific experiments and inextricable from them. This observation (of tlre recursive nature of observation) led to the constructivist position that'the world as we know it is our invention'. Cybernetics and systems theory fundamentally challenged conventional approaches to the production of knowledge, provoking a paradigm shift that rippled throughout all academic disciplines. These shifts in mindset seeped into popular culture through a broad range ofartistic practices and exhibitions and via publications such as Radicsl Sofnuare and the Whole Earth Catalog, the first issue of which (1968) included a section devoted to'Understanding Whole Systems'.  

Literary critic N. l(atherine Hayles identifies a third wave of cybernetics, associated with the emergent behaviour of complex systems, which focused on 'getting the system to evolve in new directions'(secfion 1: Foundations). Cellular automata theory, first proposed byJohn von Neumann in the 1940s, established the foundations for self-replicating, dynamical systems. Mathematician John Conway's 'Game of Life' (1970), demonstrated the potential of simple cellular automata to generate unexpectedly complex behaviour, providing a mathematical system (a universal Turing machine) capable of simulating complex systems. In 1968, artist Norman White independently demonstrated a physical computing model of celf ular automata. ln FirstTrghtenUp theDrums, digital circuits generated complex behaviours similar to non-linear dynamic systems: a grid of lights illuminated in unpredictable patterns resembling rain dripping down a windowpane. In the 1980s, Christopher Langton used cellular automata to simulate living systems, a field of research known as artificial lif,e (A-Life), which he hoped would enable scientists to 'locate life-as-we-know-it within the larger picture of life-as-it-could-be'.s Also in the 1980s, biologists Humberto Maturana and Francisco Varela extended their influential theories of autopoiesis, structural coupling and embodied cognition to draw third-order phenomena of language and society into this reflexive fold (secfion 1). As a result, the scientist - and science itself - became inextricable from the complex linguistic and cultural \ 'r.rr\ that mediate the production of l<nowledge and the attribution oi 'rrni' .rnd value. As discussed below, autopoiesis, A-Life and related concepts rrrrl rlt lrrriclues have pervaded art practice and theory.  

Irr t)5(i, artist Nicolas Schdffer explicitly introduced cybernetic concepts into rr",p,rrsive sculpture cyspI, the title oiwhich is an acronym joiningthe first rrvr r h'r rt'r's of the word 'cybernetics' and 'spatiodynamic'. By 1960, Roy Ascott had ro incorporate the ideas of cybernetics into his artistic practice, later ' 1rr,rr(llnrl these ideas into his teaching and theoretical writing, influencing ," r.r.rrions of artists, including students Stephen Willats (section2), Brian Eno " ttt,n '1: Generative sysfems) and christa sommerer and Laurent Mignonneau ',r As described by Usman Haque (secfion 2), the landmark exhibition vl),'rr('ric Serendipity'at the lnstitute of contemporary Arts in London (196g) rrr, lrsychologist and cybernetician Gordon pask's sculpture Colloquy of I /r r/rrlr's, wlrich generated complex behaviours as its elements interacted with each ',rlrr'r ,rr(l with the audience. pask was an early innovator of human_machine tlcsigr.r and conversation theory, which he integrated into educational t' ' lrrrrrl,rgy, fields that remain vital research areas for artists and scientists.  

l()(i(i Lawrence Alloway curated 'systemic painting' at the cuggenheim rrsing the term to signify a cool, non-expressionistic approach to ' r,l,,r rrrli tlre lormal possibilities of an image through repetition, as in the worl< of l' ' lr r, r, Arirres Martin, Robert Ryman, and others later associated with Minimalism. .rpproach characterized the 1970s systems Group in Britain, whose rr,, ,,lrrl, il. t 0rrstructivist-inspired work was re-examined at Southampton City Art 2008.

and in constructivist Victor vasarely's 1950s proposals for mass-produced art' Equally, Burnham saw it percolating in the growing disavowal by artists [[Ad Reinhardt]].DonaldJudd,RobertMorrisandLesLevineoftheformalist determinism of concrete objects, which was being subsumed by a growing emphasison.liststructures'indynamic,open-endedandresponsiveartworks.

Haact<e's real-time systems included a varlety 'plugged' and 'unplugged' media' addressing a range of natural social systems, as did Stephen Willats' application of systems thinking to actual social intervention (section 2). This lineage has continued in the institutional and sociologicalcritiqueslevelledbyMarkLombardi'sdiagrammatic.Narrative Structures' drawings of the 1990s, Josh On's website They Rule (2004)' and UBERMORCEN.COMetal's'GooglewillEatltself'(section4)'similarly',it characterizes the ecological projects by artists such as Agnes Denes' David Dunn' and Newton and Helen Mayer Harrison since the 1970s' and by Beatrice da Costa' YolandeHarris,NatalieJeremijenko,MichaelMandiberg,AndreaPolliandAviva Rahmanisincethelgg0s.lndeed,fromthemidlgg0stothelate2000s' Burnham,s systems aesthetics had been revisited and reinterpreted to such an extent that the phenomenon of its recupelation became subject lristoriographic research in its own right (see my text in section 3)' Following exhibitions, symposia and publications at Tate Modern in 2005 and whitechapel Callery in 2OO7, systems aesthetics reappeared (again) US mainstream contemporary art contexts in the fiftieth anniversary issue Artforum (September2ol2),inwhichBurnham's-lg68andlg6gessaysandthe.Software' exhibitionhecurated(1970)weresubjecttoanotherroundofenthusiastic reappraisals (see Caroline Jones in section3)'

Its influence can be seen in the work otJohn Cage' Alvin Lucier' IannisXenakis(secfion4)andBrianEno(secfion4),allofwhomwerewellversed in cybernetics, and who, in turn, have influenced subsequent ofcomposerS,artiStSandarchitects.Lucier'slg65.MusicforSoloPerformer' incorporated electro-encephalography (EEG) to create a systemic bio-feedback loop between the performer's state of mind and the sound produced' advent of cor.rsumer EEG headsets, one can expect enrerging artists to build on the pioneering work of Lucier, David Rosenboom, Richard Teitelbaum and Nina Sobell. ln addition, systems thinking may have contributed to expanding the frame of art to include the total environment, as in Cage's silent composition $4^{\prime}33^{\prime\prime}$ and happening Theatre Piece N.l (both 1952), Xenakis' design for the Philips Pavilion (1958) and his Polytopes (1967-73) and Diatope (1978), Bernhard Leitner's sound environments, and Eno's multimedia software program and installati on 77 Million Paintings (2006), presented as a large-scale projection on the Sydney Opera House (1958-73), Jorn Utzon's architectural landmark inspired by natural systems.  

Systems theory was an important influence on visionary architects including Bucl<minster Fuller (section 5: Environmental and Social Systems), Cedric Price (section 2), Paolo Soleri and the Archigram collective. Fuller's concern with sustainable urban metastructures was an important influence on Soleri and Archigram, which shared with Price a concern with creating flexible or, to use Pasl<'s term, 'underspecified' environments that used emerging technological media to respond cybernetically to their inhabitants. As Haque, William J. Mitchell and Michael Weinstock (section 2) suggest, systems theory is not an outmoded way of thinking but continues to offer architecture and design new possibilities for functional and formal invention.  

This generative approach heralded by Schoenberg finds visual parallels in Richard Paul Lohse's 1944 Continually interpenetrating range of colours bssed on ct seial system from 1-12. Lohse, in turn, anticipates the conceptual, systemic and generative work of artists ranging from Sol LeWitt to Sonia Landy Sheridan in the 1960s and 1970s, to more contemporary works of digital art (see section 4). ln the lineage of White and Pask but informed by the worl< of Maturana and Varela, in l(en Rinaldo's Autopoiesis, cotrrplex systemic behaviour emerges through interactions between members of a group of robotic sculptural elements and the .rudience. ln 1990 artist Michael Joaquin Grey in collaboration with Randy Huff programmed genetic algorithms into a supercomputer to generate li[e-like forms rnalogous to actual species. ln the early 1990s, ecologist Tom Ray's Tierra project Lrsed A-Life to simulate evolution, a technique used by artists including Karl Sims, l.rue Prophet, and Christa Sommerer and Laurent Mignonneau. Mitchell Whitelaw ,rnd Geoff Cox note a divide between generative art wlrich focuses on the emergent properties and potentials of formal systems and that which focuses on the critical r trltural implications of the institutionalization of software. The field of bio-art, as lxcnrplified by the Tissue Culture and Art Project, also draws on the generative ,rt'sthetic heritage, often using biological material and laboratory techniques to r r('.lte awareness of and instigate critical discourse about the implications of ,'r r rt'rgir.rg biotech practices.

But the concept of artaSasocialsystemwasalreadypresentinphilosopherArthurDanto'sinfluential 1g64 essay ,The Artworld'. Danto opened the floodgates for institutional analyses of art that focus less on the objects themselves than on the larger communities or systems of discourse in which they circulate and gain meaning and value' Pierre Bourdieu's field theory shares this general approach, offering incisive commentary onthesystemicrelationshipbetweenart,artists,artcritics,powerandcapital. Nick Prior applies Bourdleu's schema to the counter-cultural phenomenon of music and proposes the addition of actor network theory (ANT) in order to account for the important role of teclrnology, absent in Bourdieu's framework but vital for the analysis of glitch. ANT is itself a highly systemic form of cultural analvsis' Like cybernetics, it draws paraltels between human and non-human actors' both which can exercise agency that affects the behaviour of a social system' ln his analysisofartandtherelationshipbetweenscientificknowledgeandhumanistic knowledge, Bruno Latour, a primary theodst of ANI provides a systemic reading artworksandsystemsofinterpretation.llwhilereadingBourdieu,Priorand Latour (in secLion5), one substitutes the word 'system' for'field' or'network" the relationship of their work to systems theory becomes clear'  

Strainsofsystemsthinkingcanbeidentifiedthroughouthistoryandacross cultures, from the I Ching to the Mayan calendar and from Buddhism to the l(abbalah. The broad appeal of systems thinking in the 1960s dovetails with the growing popularity of eastern philosophy at that time' It is not surprtstng' therefore, that some leading proponents of systems thinking - including' in this volume, Ascott, Burnham and NamJune Paik in the arts and Fritjof capra, Donella Meadows and Varela in the sciences - became deeply engaged with non-western systems of thought.

ICFL SYSTEMATIC OR SERIAL ART IS A SUBLIMATED AND CRITICAL ECHO OF THE STRUCTURES OF CIVILIZATION  

# Fritjof Ccprc Systems Theory crnd the New Pcrrcrdigm//1988  

The dramatic change in concepts and ideas that happened in physics during the first three decades of Ithe twentieth] century [...] led Thomas Kuhn to the notion of a scientific paradigm, a constellation of [...] concepts, values, techniques, and so on, shared by a scientific community and used by that community to define legitimate problems and solutions. Changes of paradigms, according to l(uhn, occur in discontinuous, revolutionary breaks called paradigm shifts.  

Today [...] we recognize paradigm shifts in physics as an integral part of a much larger cultural trans[ormation. The intellectual crisis of quantum physicists in the 1920s is mirrored today by a similar but much broader cultural crisis. The major problems of our time - the growing threat of nuclear waq terrorism, the devastation o[ our natural environment, our inability to deal with poverty and starvation around the world, to name just the most urgent ones - are all different facets of one single crisis, whicl-r is essentially a crisis of perception. Lil<e the crisis in quantum physics, it derives from the fact that most of us, and especially our large social institutions, subscribe to the concepts of an outdated worldview, inadequate for dealing with the problems of overpopulated, globally interconnected world. At the same time, researchers in several scientific disciplines, various social movements and numerous alternative organizations and networks are developing a new vision of reality that will form the basis of our future technologies, economic systems and social institutions.  

What we are seeing today is a shift of paradigms not only within science but also in the larger social arena. To analyse that cultural transformation, I have generalized l(uhn's account of a scientific paradigm to that of a social poradigm, which I define as 'a constellation of concepts, values, perceptions and practices shared by a community, which form a particular vision of reality that is the basis of the way the community organizes itself'.'  

The social paradigm [...] consists of a number of ideas and values, among them the view of the universe as a mechanical system composed of elementary building blocks, the view of the human body as a machine, the view of life in a society as a competitive struggle for existence, the belief in unlimited material progress to be achieved through economic and technological growth and, last but not least, the belief that a society, in which the female is everywhere subsumed under the male, is one that follows from some basic law o[ nature. During recent decades, all of these assumptions have been found severely limited and in need of radical revision. [...]  

paradigm may be called a holistic, or an ecological using the term ecorogical here rn a much broader and deeper awareness, in that deep sense, recognizes the fundamental of alr phenomena and the embeddedness of individuars societies in the cyclical processes of nature.  

deep ecologicar awareness is spirituar or religious the conceptof the hunran spiritis understood as the mode of consciousness feers connected to the cosmos as a whore, 'oot word rerigion (from the Latin rerigare, meaning ,to becomes clear that ecolo therefore, not surprising ecological awareness, is c Of spiritual traditions, for example, that of Eastern spiritual traditions the mystics, or with the phirosophy and cosmorogy trrrderlying the Native American traditi ,ns.2

This method of questioning, in other words epistemology, inevitably becomes part of the theory.[..]  

ng'to'network' as metaphor of knowledge' The metaphor of ing has been used in Western science and philosophy for here are fundamental laws, fundamental principles' basic building blocks, and so on.

This web of relationships is described in terms of a corresponding network of concepts and models, none of which is any more fundamental than the others.  

This new approach immediately raises an important question: If everything is connected to everything else, how can you ever hope to understand anything? Since all natural phenomena are ultimately interconnected, in order to explain any one of them we need to understand all the others, which is obviously impossible.  

What makes it possible to turn the systems approach into a scientific theory is the fact that there is such a thing as approximate knowledge. [...] [l]t is recognized that all scientific concepts and theories are limited and approximate. Science can never provide any complete and definitive understanding. Scientists do not deal with truth in the sense of a precise correspondence between the description and the described phenomena. They deal with limited and approximate descriptions of reality. Heisenberg often pointed out that important fact. For example, he wrote in Physics and Philosophy, 'The often discussed lesson that has been learned from modern physics Iis] that every word or concept, clear as it may seem to be, has only a limited range of applicability.'6  

# Self-Organizing Systems  

The broadest implications of the systems approach are found today in a new theory of living systems, which originated in cybernetics in the 1940s and emerged in its main outlines over the last [forty] years.T [... ]  

The central concept of the new theory is that of self-organization. A living system is defined as a self-organizing system, which means that its order is not iurposed by the environment but is established by the system itself. In other words, self-organizing systems exhibit a certain degree of autonomy. This does not mean that living systems are isolated from their environment; on the coutrary, they interact with it continually, but this interaction does not determine their organization.  

In this essay, I can give only a brief sketch of the theory of self-organizing systems. To do so, let me distinguish three aspects of self-organization:  

1. Pattern of organization: the totality of relationships that define the system .rs an integrated whole 2. Structurei the physical realization of the pattern of organization in space .rrrcl time 3. Organizing activity; the activity involved in realizing the pattern of ( )r'g.tnlzatlon  

For self-organizing systems, the pattern of organization is characterized by a rrrutual dependency of the system's parts, which is necessary and sufficient to rrnclerstand the parts. [...]  

pattern of self-organization has been studied extensively and described precisely by Humberto Maturana and Francisco Varela, who have called it autopoiesis, which means literally self-prod uction. [. . . ]  

An important aspect of the theory is the fact that the description of the pattern of self-organization does not use any physical parameters, such as energy or entropy, nor does it use the concepts ofspace and time. [...] This pattern can be realized in space and time in different physical structures, which are then described in terms of the concepts of physics and chemistry. But such a description alone will fail to capture the biological phenomenon of self-organization. [... ]  

The structure of self-organizing systems has been studied extensively by Ilya Prigogine, who has called it a dissipative structure.8 The two main characteristics of a dissipative structure are ( 1 ) that it is an open system, maintaining its pattern of organization through continuous exchange of energy and matter with its environment; and (2) that it operates far from thermodynamic equilibrium and thus cannot be described in terms of classical thermodynamics. [...]  

The organizing activity of living, self-organizing systems, finally, is cognition, or mental activity. This implies a radically new concept of mind, which was first proposed by Gregory Bateson.s Mental process is defined as the organizing activity of life. This means that all interactions of a living system with its environment are cognitive, or mental interactions. With this new concept of mind, life and cognition become inseparablyconnected. Mind, or more accurately, mental process is seen as being immanent in matter at all levels of lite. [... I  

# Science and Ethics  

A further reason why I find the theory of self-organizing systems so important is that it seems to provide the ideal scientific framework for an ecologically oriented ethics.lO Such a system of ethics is urgently needed, since most of what scientists are doing today is not life-furthering and life-preserving but life-destroying. [...1  

It is generally not recognized in our culture that values are Dot peripheral to science and technology but constitute their very basis and driving force. During the scientific revolution in the seventeenth century, values were separated from facts, and since that time we have tended to believe that scientific facts are independent of what we do and, therefore, independent of our values. In reality, scientific facts emerge out of an entire constellation of human perceptions, values and actions - in a word, out of a paradigm - from which they cannot be separated. [...] Scientists, therefore, are responsible for their research not only intellectually but also morally.  

One of the most important insights of the new systems theory of life is that life and cognition are inseparable. The process of knowledge is also the process of self-organization, that is, the process of life. Our conventional model of knowledge is one o[ a representation or an image of independently existing facts, which is the model derived from classical physics. From the new systems point of view, knowledge is part of the process of life, of a dialogue between object and subject.[... I

$|...|$ How does one recognize a constructivist? Very easily. Ifyou were to ask one wlrt,ther something, say, a formula, a notion, an object, order, symmetry, a l,rx()uomy, laws of nature, etc., etc., is discovered or invented, a constructivist worrlcl tend to say invented. Moreover, if hard pressed, a constructivist would ..v('n s(.ly that the world as we know it is our invention. since whatever we invent r', oilr'responsibility, the constructivist position contains the seed for an ethic.  

I lcalize that I might not easily get away with such far out propositions. I will, tlrcrt'lirre, muster whatever help I can get. [...] Let me read a charming vignette wriltcrr by Gregory Bateson. He packed a lot of epistemology into a minimal space by using the literary device of a dialogue between a precocious daughter and her father. He called them'Metalogues'. I shall give you, along with some of my comments, the one entitled'Metalogue: what is an instinct?'  

Daughter: Daddy, what is an instinct?  

Let me interrupt by asking you to stop and think how you would have answered your daughter's (or son's) question. I would have proudly come up with a lexical definition: An instinct, my dear, is the innate aspect of behaviour that is unlearned, complex, etc., etc. .. .' Since the daughter could have found this kind of answer in any dictionary, her father reframes the context of the question by ignoring the semantic significance of the word 'instinct' and shifts to its functional (even political! ) significance when used by one partner in a dialogue:  

Fother: An instinct, my dear, is an explanatory principle.  

Let me pause again and invite you to reflect on the question of whether a library could accommodate the contextual switch demonstrated by the father. I consider this transition from a monological to a dialogical situation of the greatest importance, and I shall return to this later. Now let us hear what the daughter has to say to this answer.  

D: But what does it explain? F: Anything, almost anything at all. Anything you want it to explain. Please note that something that explains almost anything at all, most likely   
explains nothing at all. The daughter senses this: D: Don't be silly. It doesn't explain gravity. F: No, but that is because nobody wants instinct to explain gravity. lf they did   
it would explain lt. We would simply say that the moon has an instinct whose   
strength varies inversely as the square of the distance, and so on and so on. D: But that's nonsense, Daddy. F: Yes, surely, but it was you who mentioned instinct, not I. I shall not interrupt the dynamics of this dialogue any more but I ask you to   
pay attention to father's consistent reference to descriptions of observations and   
not to the observations per se (e.g.'... if you say... there was a full moon ...'and   
not'... if there was a full moon...', etc.). Most likely you [the audiencel, as   
librarians, would have caught this anyway. Well, here we go. D: But what does explain gravity? F: Nothing, my dear, because gravity is an explanatory principle. D: Oh, do you mean that you cannot use one explanatory principle to explain   
another - never? F: Hum, haw, hardly ever. That is what Newton meant when he said hypothesis   
nonfingo. D: And what does that mean please? F: Well, you know what hypotheses ate. Any statement linking together two  

descriptive statements is an hypothesis. If you say there was a full moon on 1 February and another on 1 March, and then you link these two observations together in any way, the statement which links them is an hypothesis.  

D: Yes, and I know what non means, but what is fingo? F: Well,Jtngo is a Latin word for'to make'. lt forms a verbal noun,ficfio, from   
which we get the word fiction. D: Daddy, do you mean that Sir lsaac Newton thought that all hypotheses are   
just made up like stories? F: Yes, precisely that. D: But didn't he discover gravity? With the apple? F: No, my dear, he invented it.  

The dialogue continues, but I shall stop here because I just wanted you to hear this punchline.  

Constructivists would insist that not only do we invent the laws of nature, we construcl,' our own realities. [... ]

# Clqude E. Shqnnon A Mcthemcrticql Theory of Communiccttion/ /1948  

l...lThe fundamental problem of communication is that of reproducing at one poirrt, either exactly or approximately, a message selected at another point. l'r ccluently the messages have meaning; that is they refer to, or are correlated ,rccording to, some system with certain physical or conceptual entities. These scrnantic aspects of communication are irrelevant to the engineering problem. llrc'significant aspect is that the actual message is one selecfed from a set of possible messages. The system must be designed to operate for each possible st'lcction, not just the one which will actually be chosen, since this is unknown ,rt the time of design.  

Il' the number of messages in the set is finite then this number, or any rrrorrotonic function of this number, can be regarded as a measute of the rrrlirr-rration produced when one message is chosen from the set, all choices lrt'ing equally likely. [...1  

By a communication system we will mean a system [which] consists of essentially five parts:  

7. Aninformation source, which produces a message or sequence of messages to be communicated to the receiving terminal. The message may be of various types: (a) A sequence of letters, as in a telegraph or teletype system; (b) A single function of tim $f(t),$ as in radio or telephony; (c) A function of time and other variables, as in black and white television [... | (d) Two or more functions of time, [as in] 'three-dimensional' sound transmission, or if the system is intended to service several individual channels in multiplex; (e) Several functions of several variables, [as in] colour television t. l; (f) Various combinations also occur, for example in television with an associated audio channel.  

2. A transmitfer, which operates on the message in some way to produce a signal suitable for transmission over the channel. In telephony this operation consists merely ofchanging sound pressure into a proportional electrical current. [...] Vocoder systems Ianalysing and synthesizing human speechl, television and frequenry modulation are other examples of complex operations applied to the message to obtain the signal.  

3. The channel is merely the medium used to transmit the signal from transmitter to receiver. lt may be a pair of wires, a coaxial cable, a band of radio frequencies, a beam of light, etc.  

4.The receiver ordinarily performs the inverse operation of that done by the transmitter, reconstructing the message from the signal.  

5. The destincfion is the person (or thing) for whom the message is intended.  

We wish to consider certain general problems involving communication systems. To do this it is first necessary to represent the various elements involved as mathematical entities, suitably idealized from their physical counterparts. We may roughly classify communication systems into three main categories: discrete, continuous and mixed. By a discrete system we will mean one in which both the message and the signal are a sequence of discrete symbols. A typical case is telegraphy, where the message is a sequence of letters and the signal a sequence of dots, dashes and spaces. A continuous system is one in which the message and signal are both treated as continuous functions, e.g. radio or television. A mixed system is one in which both discrete and continuous variables appear, e.g. PCM Ipulse-code modulation] transmission of speech. [...]  

# Wqrren Wecrver Recent Contributions to the Mcthemqticql Theory of Communicction/ / 1949  

[...lThe word communication will be used here in a very broad sense to include all of the procedures by which one mind may affect another. This, of course, involves not only written and oral speech, but also music, the pictorial arts, the theatre, the ballet, and in fact all human behaviour. In some connections it may be desirable to use a still broader definition of communication, namely, one which would include the procedures by means of which one mechanism (say automatic equipment to track an airplane and to compute its probable future positions) affects another mechanism (say a guided missile chasing this airplane). The language of this memorandum will often appear to refler to the special, but still very broad and important, field of the communication of speech; but practically everything said applies equally well to music of any sort, and to still or moving pictures, as in television.  

# Three Levels of Communications Problems  

Relative to the broad subject of communication, there seem to be problems at three levels. Thus it seems reasonable to ask, serially:  

Level A. How accurately can the symbols of communication be transmitted? (The technical problem.) Level B. How precisely do the transmitted symbols convey the desired meaning? (The semantic problem.) Level C. How effectively does the received meaning affect conduct in the desired way? (The effectiveness problem.)  

The technical problems are concerned with the accuracy of transference from sender to receiver of sets of symbols (written speech), or of a continuously varying signal (telephonic or radio transmission of voice or music), or of a continuously varying two-dimensional pattern (television), etc. Mathematically, the first involves transmission of a finite set of discrete symbols, the second the transmission of one continuous function of time, and the third the transmission of many continuous lunctions of time or of one continuous function of time and of two space coordinates.  

The semantic problems are concerned with the identity, or satisfactorily close approximation, in the interpretation of meaning by the receiver, as compared with the intended meaning of the sender. This is a very deep and involved situation, even when one deals only with the relatively simpler problems of communicating through speech.

# Comments  

So stated, one would be inclined to think that Level A is a relatively superficial one, involving only the engineering details of good design of a communication system; while B and c seem to contain most if not all of the philosophical content of the general problem of communication'  

The matl-rernatical theory of the engineering aspects of communication, as developedchieflybyClaudeSl-rannonattheBellTeleplroneLaboratories' .rclnrittedly applies iu the first instance only to problern A, namely, the technical pr oblenr of acculacy of translerence of various types ol signals from sender to rcceiver. But the theory has, I thinl(, a deep significance [...] Part of the significance of the new theory comes from the fact that [...] any limitations tliscovered in the theory at Level A necessarily apply to levels B and C. But a l.rr.gel part of the significance colres from the lact that the analysis at Level A rliscloses that this level overlaps the other levels nrore than one could possibly rr.rively suspect. Thus the theory of Level A is, at least to a significant degree, also ,r theory of levels B and C. [...]

The oxygen and carbon dioxide and salt in our blood, the hormones flowing from our ductless glands, are all regulated by mechanisms which tend to resist any untoward changes in their levels. These mechanisms constitute what is known as homeostasis, and are negative feedback mechanisms of a type that we may find exemplifi ed in mechanical automata.  

It is the pattern maintained by this homeostasis, which is the touchstone of our personal identity. Our tissues change as we live: the lood we eat and the air we breathe become flesh of our flesh and bone of our bone, and the momentary elements of our flesh and bone pass out of our body every day with our excreta. We are but whirlpools in a river of ever-flowing water. We are not stuff that abides, but patterns that perpetuate themselves'  

A pattern is a message, and may be transmitted as a message. How else do we employ our radio than to transmit patterns of sound, and our television set than to transmit patterns of light? lt is both amusing and instructive to consider what would happen if we were to transmit the whole pattern of the human body, of the brain with its memories and cross connections, so that a hypothetical receiving instrument could re-embody these messages in appropriate matter, capable of continuing the processes already in the body and the mind, and of maintaining the integrity needed for this continuation by a process of homeostasis [...]  

lf we consider the two types of communication: namely, material transport, and transport of information alone, it is at present possible for a person to go from one place to another only by the former, and not as a message. However, even now the transportation of messages setves to forward an extension of man's senses and his capabilities of action from one end of the world to another t...1 [T]he distinction between material transportation and message transportation is not in any theoretical sense Permanent and unbridgeable.  

This takes us very deeply into the question of human individuality. The problem of the nature of human individuality and of the barrier which separates one personality from another is as old as history [... ]  

one thing at any rate is clear. The physical identity of an individual does not consist in the matter of which it is made. Modern methods of tagging the elements participating in metabolism have shown a much higher turnover than was long thought possible, not only ol the body as a whole, but of each and evel.y component part of it. The biological individuality of an organism seems to lie in a certain continuity of process, and in the memory by the organism of the effects of its past development. This appears to hold also of its mental tlcvelopment. ln terms of the computing machine, the individuality of a mind lics in the retention of its earlier tapings and memories, and in its continued rlcvelopment along lines already laid out.  

Under these conditions, just as a computing machine may be used as a pattern rrrr which to tape other computing machines, and just as the luture development ol'these two machines will continue parallel except for future changes in taping .rnd experience, so too, there is no inconsistency in a living individual forking or tlivaricating into two individuals sharing the same past, but growing more and rnore different. This is what happens with identical twins; but there is no reason why it could not happen with what we call the mind, without a similar split of the lrody. To use computing-machine language again, at some stage a machine, which was previously assembled in an all-over manner, may find its connections divided i u to partial assemblies with a higher or lower degree of independence [ . . . ]  

Moreover, it is thinkable that two Iarge machines which had previously not bcen coupled may become coupled so as to work from that stage on as a single rn.rchine. Indeed this sort of thing occurs in the union of the germ cells, although pc'r-haps not on what we would ordinarily call a purely mental level. [...]  

To recapitulate: the individuality of the body is that of a flame rather than th.rt of a stone, of a form rather of a bit of substance. This form can be transmitted ol rnodified and duplicated, although at present we know only how to duplicate it over a short distance.  

When one cell divides into two, or when one of the genes which carries our torporeal and mental birthright is split in order to make ready for a reduction tlivision of a germ cell, we have a separation in matter which is conditioned by lhc power of a pattern of living tissue to duplicate itself. Since this is so, there is rro absolute distinction between the types of transmission which we can use for scnding a telegram from country to country and the types ol transmission which at least are theoretically possible for transmitting a living organism such ,rs a human being.  

Let us then admit that the idea that one might conceivably travel by telegraph, in .rddition to travelling by train or airplane, is not intrinsically absurd, far as it nr.ry be from realization. The difficulties are, of course, enormous [... ]  

I have stated these things not because I want to write a science fiction story concerning itself with the possibility of telegraphing a man, but because it may lrcllr us understand that the fundamental idea of communication is that of the lr'.rrrsmission of messages, and that the bodily transmission of matter and nrcssages is only one conceivable way of attaining that end. [...]  

# N. Kcrtherine HcYles Contesting for the Body of Informcrtion: The Mccy Conferences on Cybernetics (1946 cnd 1953)//1999  

when and where did information get constructed as a disembodied rnedium? How were researchers convinced that humans and machines are brothers under the skin? Although the Macy Conferences on Cybernetics were not the only forum grappling with tl.rese questions, they were particularly important because they acted as a crossroads for the traffic in cyben-retic models and artefacts- This Itext] charts the arguments that macle information seem more importanI than materiality within this research community. Broadly speaking, the alguments were deployed along three fronts. The first was concerned with the construction of information as a theoretical entity; the second, with the construction of (htrman) neural structures so that they were seen as flows of information; the third, with the constrLlction of artefacts that translated information flows into observable operations, thereby mal<ing the flows 'real"  

Yet at each of these fronts, there was also significant resistance to tl.re reification of information. Alternate models were proposed; important qualifications were voiced; objections were raised to the disparity between simple artefacts and the complex problems they addressed. Reification was triumphant not because it had no opposition but because scientifically and culturally situated debates made it seem a better choice than the alternatives' Recovering tl-re cornplexities of these debates helps to demystify the assumption that information is more essential than matter or energy. Followed bacl< to moments before it became a black box, this conclusion seems less like an inevitability and more like the result of negotiations specific to the circumstances of the US techno-scientific culture during and irnmediately following World War ll.  

The Macy Conferences were unusual in that participants did not present finished papefs. Rather, speakers were invited to sketch out a few main ideas to initiate discussion. The discussions, rather than the presentatiolls, were the centre of interest. Designed to be intellectual free-for-alls, the conferences were radically interdisciplirrary. The transcripts show that researchers from a wide variety of fields - neurophysiology, electrical engineering, philosophy' semantics' literature and psychology, among others - struggled to tttlderstand one another and mal<e connections between others' ideas artd their owr.r areas of expertise' ln the process, a concept that may have begun as a model of a particular physical system came to have broader significance, acting simultaneously as mechanism and metaphor.  

The dynamics of the conferences lacilitated tl-ris mixing. Researchers rnight not have been able to identify in their own worl< the mechanism discussed by a fellow participant, but they could understand it metaphorically and then associate the metaphor with something applicable to their own field. The process appears repeatedly throughout the transcripts. Wherr Claude Shannon used the word 'infonnation', for example, he employed it as a technical term having to do with message probabilities. When Gregory Bateson appropriated the same word to talk abor-rt initiation rituals, he interpreted it metaphorically as a 'difference that makes a difference' and associated it with feedbacl< loops between contesting social groups. As mechanism and metaphor were compounded, concepts that began with narrow definitions spread out into networks of broader significance. Earlier Iin How We Becqme Postmodernl I called these networks 'constellations', sLlggesting that dr,rring the Macy period, the emphasis was on homeostasis. IHere I explore] the elements that came together to form the homeostasis constellation [andl also demonstrate the chain of associations that bound reflexivity together with subjectivity during the Macy period, which for n-rany of the physical scientists was enough to relegate reflexivity to the category of 'non-science' rather than 'science'. [A]fter the Macy period ended [...] reflexivity was modified so that it could count as producing scientific knowledge during the second wave of cybernetics.  

# The Meaning(lessness) of Information  

The triumph of information over materiality was a major theme at the first Macy Conference.John von Neumann and Norbert Wiener led the way by naking clear that the important entity in the man-machine equation was information, not energy. [...] Central was l-row much information could flow through the system and how quickly it could move. Wiener, emphasizing the movement from energy to inlormation, made the point explicitly: 'The fundamental idea is the message ... and the lundamental element of the message is the decision.'Decisions are important not because they produce material goods but because they produce information. Control information, and power follows.  

But what counts as information? [...] Claude Shannon defined inf,ormation as a probability function with no dimensions, no materiality, and no necessary connection with meaning. Although a lull exposition of information theory is beyond the scope ofthis text, the following explanation, adapted from an account by Wiener, will give an idea ol the underlying reasoning. Like Shannon, Wiener thought of, information as reptesenting a choice. More specifically, it represents a choice of one message from among a range of possible messages. Suppose there are thirty-two horses in a race, and we want to bet on Number 3. The bookie suspects the police have tapped his telephone, so he has arranged for his clients to use a code. He studied communication theory (perhaps he was in one of the summer-school classes on communication theory that Wiener taught at UCLA), and he knows that any message can be communicated through a binary code. When we call up, his voice program asks if the number falls in the range of I to 16. If it does, we punch the number 'l'; if not, the number 'o'. we use this same code when the voice program asks if the number falls in the range of 1 to 8, then the range of 1 to 4, and next the range of 1 to 2. Now the program knows that the number must be either 3 or 4, so it says, 'lf 3, press l; if 4, press O', and a final tap communicates the number. Using these binary divisions, we need five responses to communicate our choice. [.'.]  

Note that Iinformationl theory is formulated entirely without reference to what information means. Only the probabilities of message elements enter into the equations. Why divorce information from meaning? Shannon and Wiener wanted information to have a stable value as it moved from one context to another. lf it was tied to meaning, it would potentially have to change values every time it was embedded in a new context, because context affects meaning. Suppose, for example, you are in a windowless office and call to ask about the weather. 'lt's raining" I say. on the other hand, if we are both standing on a street corner, being drenched by a downpour, this same response would have a very different meaning. In the first case, I am telling you something you don't know; in the second, I am being ironic (or perhaps moronic). An information concept that ties information to meaning would have to yield two different values for the two circumstances, even though the message ('lt's raining') is the same.  

To cut through this Gordian knot, Shannon and Wiener defined information so that it would be calculated as the same value regardless of the contexts in which it was embedded, which is to say, they divorced it from meaning. In context, this was an appropriate and sensible decision. Taken out of context,the definition allowed information to be conceptualized as if it were an entity that can flow unchanged between different material substrates, as when Hans Moravec envisions the information contained in a brain being downloaded into a computer. Ironically, this reification of information is enacted through the same kind of decontextualizing moves that the theory uses to define information as such. The theory decontextualizes information; Moravec decontextualizes the theory. Thus, a simplification necessitated by engineering considerations becomes an ideology in which a reified concept of information is treated as if it were fully commensurate with the complexities of human thought'  

Shannon himself was meticulously care[ul about how he applied information theory, repeatedly stressing that information theory concerned only the efficient transmission of messages through communication channels, not what those messages mean. Although others were quick to impute larger linguistic and social implications to the theory, he resisted these attempts. Responding to a presentation by Alex Bavelas on group communication at the eighth Macy Conference, he cautioned that he did not see'too close a connection between the notion of information as we use it in communication engineering and what you are doing here ... the problem here is not so much finding the best encoding of symbols... but, rather, the determination of the semantic question of what to send and to whom to send it'. For Shannon, defining infolmation as a probability function was a strategic choice that enabled him to bracket semantics. He did not want to get involved in having to consider the receiver's mindset as part of the communication system. He fett so strongly on this point that he suggested Bavelas distinguish between information in a channel and information in a human mind by characterizing the latter through 'subjective probabilities', although how these were to be defined and calculated was by no means clear.  

Not everyone agreed that it was a good idea to decontextualize information. At the same time that Shannon and Wiener were forging what information would mean in a US context, Donald Macl(ay, a British researcher, was trying to formulate an information theory that would tal<e meaning into account. At the seventh conference, he presented his ideas to the Macy group. The difference between his view and Shannon's can be seen in the way he bridled at Shannon's suggestion about'subjective probabilities'. In the rhetoric of the Macy Conferences, 'objective' was associated with being scientific, whereas 'subjective' was a code word implying that one had fallen into a morass of unquantifiable feelings that might be magnificent but were certainly not science. Macl(ay's first move was to rescue information that affected the receiver's mindset from the'subjective'label. He proposed that both Shannon and Bavelas were concerned with what he called 'selective information', that is, information calculated by considering the selection of message elements from a set. But selective information alone is not enough; also required is another kind of information that he called 'structural'. Structural irrflormation indicates how selective information is to be understood; it is a lnessage about how to interpret a message - that is, it is a metacommunication.  

To illustrate, say I launch into a joke and it falls flat. ln that case, I may resort to telling my interlocutor,'That's a joke.'The information content of this message, considered as selective information (measured in 'metrons'), is calculated with probability functions similar to those used in the Shannon Wiener theory. In .rddition, my metacomment also carries structural information (measured in 'logons'), for it indicates that the preceding message has one kind of structure r..rther than another (a jol<e instead of a serious statement). ln another image Macl(ay liked to use, he envisioned selective information as choosing among lblders in a file drawer, whereas structural information increased the number of tlrawers (jokes in one drawer, academic treatises in another).  

Since structLtral information indicates how a message should be interpreted, semantics necessar ily enters the picture. In sharp contrast message probabilities, which lrave no connection with meaning, structural inlormation was to be calculated through changes brought about in the receiver's ffrind. [...]  

And how does one measure these changes? An observer looks at the mind of the person who received the message, which is to say that changes are made in the observer's mind, which in turn can also be observed and measured by soffleone else. The progression tends toward the infinite regress characteristic of reflexivity. Arguing lor a strong correlation between thenature of a representation and its effect, Maclay's model recognized the mutual constitution of forn and content, message and receiver. His model was fundamentally different from the Shannon-Wiener theory because it triangulated between reflexivity, in[ormation and meaning. In the context of the Macy Conferences, his conclusion qualified as radical: sr,rbjectivity, far from being a morass to be avoided, is precisely what enables information and rneaning to be connected.  

The problem was how to quantify the model. To achieve quantification' a mathematical model was needed for the changes that a message triggered in the receiver's mind. The staggering problems this presented no doubt explain why Macl(ay's version of information theory was not widely accepted among electrical engineers [... ]  

Nicolas S. Tzannes [...] pointed out that whereas Shannon and Wiener define information in terms of what it is, Macl(ay defines it in terms of what it does. The formulation emphasizes the reification that information undergoes in the Shannon-wienertheory. stripped of context, itbecomes a mathematicalquantity weightless as sLlnshine, moving in a rarefied realm of pure probability, not tied dowrr to bodies or material instantiations. The price it pays for this universality is its divorce fiom representation. When informatiotl is made representational, as in Macl(ay's model, it is conceptualized as an action rather than a thing. Verblike, it becomes a process that someone enacts, and thus it necessarily implies context and embodiment. The price it pays for embodiment is difficulty of quarrtificatior-r and loss of univetsality.  

ln the choice between what information is and what it does, we can see the rival constellations of homeostasis and reflexivity beginning to tal<e shape. Making information a thing allies it with l.romeostasis, for so defined, it can be transported into any medium and maintain a stable quantitative value, reir.rforcing the stability that homeostasis implies. Making inlormation an action links it with reflexivity, for then its effect on the receiver must be taken into account, and measuring this effect sets up the potential for a reflexive spiral thr-ough an infinite regress of observers. Homeostasis won in the first wave largely because it was more manageable quantitatively. Reflexivity losI because spccifying and delimiting context qr-rickly ballooned into an unmanageable project. At every point, these outcomes are tied to the historical contingencies of the situation - the definitions offered, the models proposed, the techniques .rv.rilable, the allies and resources mobilized by contending participants for-their views. Conceptualizing inlormation as a disembodied entity was not an arbitrary rlccision, but neither was it inevitable. [...1  

Il humans are information processing machines, then they must have lriological eqr-ripment enabling them to process binary code. The model tonstructir-rg the human in these terms was the McCulloch-Pitts neuron. The McCulloch-Pitts neuron was the primary model thlough which cybernetics was \('en as having'a setting in the flesh', as Warren McCulloch put it. The problem w.rs how to move from this stripped-down neural model to such complex issues ,rs universals in thought, gestalts in perception, and representations of what a \Vstem cannot represent. Hele the slippage between mechanism and rnodel lrccomes important, for even amoDg researchers dedicated to a hard-science ,rpproach, such as McCulloch, the tendency was to use the model metaphorically lo forge connections between relatively simple neural circuits and the r orrplexities of embodied experience. ln the process, the disembodied logical li rln of the circuit was rhetorically transformed lrom being an effect of the model to.l couse of the model's efficacy. This move [...] made embodied reality into a lrlurred and messy instantiation of the clean abstractions of logical forms. [...] llre tension between logical lorm and embodiment [...] displays how the t ons[ruction of a weightless information was complicated when cybernetics rrroved into the intimate context of the body's own neural funetioning.

# Gregory Bateson Style, Grcrce qnd Informcrtion in Primitive Arl/ /1967  

[...]Aldous Huxley used to say that the central problem for humanity is the quest br grace.l...l  

I argue that art is a part of man's quest for grace; sometimes his ecstasy in partial success, sometimes his rage and agony at failure'  

I argue also that there are many species of grace within the major genus; and also that there are many kinds of failure and frustration and departure from grace. No doubt each culture has its characteristic species of grace towards which its artists strive, and its own species of failure.  

Some cultures may foster a negative approach to this dlfficult integration, an avoidance of complexity by crass preference either for total consciousness or total unconsciousness. Their art is unlikely to be'great'.  

I shall argue that the problem of grace is fundamentally a problem of integration and that what is to be integrated is the diverse parts of the mind - especially those multiple levels of which one extreme is called 'consciousness' and the other the'unconscious'. For the attainment o[grace, the reasons ofthe heart must be integrated with the reasons of the reason. ['..]  

The central question is: In what form is information about psychic integration contained or coded in the work ofart?  

# Style and Meaning  

They say that'every picture tells a story'[...] But I want precisely to avoid analysing the'story'. [... 1  

I am concerned with what important psychic information is in the art object quite apart from what it may'represent'. 'Le style c'est l'homme m€me' ('The style is the man himself') (Buffon). what is implicit in style, materials, composition, rhythm, skill, and so on? [...1  

The lions in Trafalgar Square could have been eagles or bulldogs and still have carried the same (or similar) messages about empire and about the cultural premises of nineteenth-century England. And yet, how different might their message have been had they been made of wood !  

But representationalism as such is relevant. The extremely realistic horses and stags of Altamira are surely not about the same cultural premises as the highly conventionalized black outlines of a later period. The code whereby perceived objects or persons (or supernaturals) are transformed into wood or paint is a soutce of information about the artist and his culture.  

# 42l/FOUNDATIONS  

It is the very rules of transformation that are of interest to me - not the message, but the code.  

My goal is not instrumental. I do not want to use the transformation rules when discovered to undo the transformation or to 'decode' the message. To translate the art object into mythology and then examine the mythology would be only a neat way of dodging or negating the problem of 'what is art?'  

I ask, then, not about the meaning ofthe encoded message but rather about the meaning of the code chosen. But still that most slippery word'meaning' must be defined.  

It will be convenient to define meaning in the most general possible way in the first instance.  

'Meaning' may be regarded as an approximate synonym of pattern, redundancy, information and 'restraint', within a paradigm of the foilowing sort:  

Any aggregate ofevents or objects (e.g. a sequence ofphonemes, a painting, or a frog, or a culture) shall be said to contain 'redundancy' or 'pattern' if the aggregate can be divided in any way by a 'slash mark', such that an observer perceiving only what is on one side of the slash mark can guess, with better than random success, what is on the other side of the slash mark. We may say that what is on one side olthe slash contains information or has meaning about what is on the other side. Or, in engineer's language, the aggregate contains 'r'edundancy'. Or, again, from the point of view of, a cybernetic observer, the information available on one side of the slash will restrain (i.e. reduce the probability ofl) wrong guessing. [...]  

The essence and rcison d'€rre of communication is the creation of redundancy, rneaning, pattern, predictability, information, and/orthe reduction of the random l)V 'restraint'.  

It is, I believe, of prime importance to have a conceptual system which will li rr.ce us to see the 'message' (e.g. the art object) as both itself internally patterned .rrrd itself a part of a larger patterned universe - the culture or some part of it.  

l'he characteristics ofobjects ofart are believed to be about, or to be partly r lt'rived from, or determined by, other characteristics of cultural and psychological "vstcms. our problem might therefore be oversimply represented by the diagram It lr.rlacteristic, of art object/Characteristics o[ rest of culture], where square lrr,rcl<ets enclose the universe ol relevance, and where the oblique stroke rr'prcseuts a slash across which some guessing is possible, in one direction or in lr,th. problem, then, is to spell out what sorts of relationships, , or rcspondences, etc., cross or transcend this oblique stroke. [...1  

# I cvcls and Logical Types  

| | lhc word 'l<now' is not merely ambiguous in covering both conncifre (to know through the senses, to recognize or perceive) and scvoir (to know in the mind), but varies - actively shifts - in meaning for basic systemic reasons. That which we l<now through the senses can become l<nowledge in the mind. [. . ' ]  

[T]here is a special form of 'l<nowing' which is usually regarded as adaptation rather than information. A shark is beautifully shaped for Iocomotion in water, but the genome of the shark surely does not contain direct information about hydrodynamics. Rather, the genome must be supposed to contain information or instructions which are the complemer-rt of hydrodynamics. Not hydrodynamics, but what hydrodynamics requires, has been built up in the shark's genome. similarly, a migratory bird perhaps does not know the way to its destination in any of the senses outlined above, but the bird may contain the complementary instructions necessaly to cause it to fly right.  

'Le coeur q ses rcisons que Ia raison ne connait point' ('The heart has its reasons which reason does not at all perceive') [Pascal]. It is this - the complex layering of consciousness and unconsciousness - that creates difficulty when we try to discuss art or ritual or mythology. The matter of levels of the mind has been discussed from many points of view, at least four of which must be mentioned and woven into any scientific approach to art:  

(1)Samuel Butler's insistence that the better an organism'knows'something, the less conscious it becomes of its knowledge, i.e. there is a plocess whereby knowledge (or 'habit' - whether of action, perception or thought) sinks to deeper and deeper levels o[the mind. This phenomenon, which is central to Zen discipline (see Herrigel, Zen in the Art of Archery), is also relevant to all art and all skill.  

(2) Adalbert Ames' demonstrations that the conscious, three-dimensional visual images which we make of that which we see are made by processes involving mathematical premises of perspective, etc., of the use of which we are totally unconscious. Over these processes we have no voluntary control. A drawing of a chair with the perspective ol Van cogh affronts the conscious expectations and, dimly, reminds the consciousness of what had been (unconsciously) taken for granted.  

(3)The Freudian (especially Fenichel's) theory of dreams as metaphors coded according to primary process. I shall consider style - neatness, boldness of contrast, etc. - as metaphoric and therefore as linl<ed to those levels of the mind where primary process holds sway.  

(4) The Freudian view of the unconscious as the cellar or cupboard to which fearful and painful memories are consigned by a process of repression. [... I  

These considerations are especially relevant in any attempt to derive a theory of art or poetry. Poetry is not a sort of distorted and decorated prose, but rather prose is poetry which has been stripped down and pinned to a Procrustean bed of logic. The computer men who would programme the translation of languages sometimes forget this fact about the primary nature of language. To try lo construct a machine to tlanslate the art of one culture into the art of another would be equally silly. [...]  

In the clich6 system of Anglo-Saxons, it is commonly assumed that it would be somehow better if what is unconscious were made conscious. Freud, even, is said to have said, 'Where id was, there ego shall be', as though such an increase in conscious knowledge and control would be both possible and, of course, an improvement. This view is the product of an almost totally distorted epistemology and a totally distorted view of what sort of thing a man, or any other organism, is.  

Of the four sorts of unconsciousness listed above, it is very clear that the first three are necessary. Consciousness, for obvious mechanical reasons, must always be limited to a rather small fraction of mental process. If useful at all, it must therefore be husbanded. The unconsciousness associated with habit is an economy both of thought and of consciousness; and the same is true of the irraccessibility ol the processes of perception. The conscious organism does not require (for pragrnatic purposes) to know how it perceives - only to know what it perceives. (To suggest that we might operate without a foundation in primary l)rocess would be to suggest that the human brain ought to be differently structured.) Of the four types, only the Freudian cupboard for skeletons is perhaps undesirable and could be obviated. But there may still be advantages in keeping the skeleton off the dining room table.  

In truth, our life is such that its unconscious components are continuously plesent in all their multiple forms. lt follows that in our relationships we tontinuously exchange messages about these unconscious materials, and it lrecomes important also to exchange meta-messages by which we tell each other what order and species of unconsciousness (or consciousness) attaches lo our messages.  

lrr a merely pragmatic way, this is important because the orders of truth are rlil'ferent for different sotts of messages. ln so far as a message is conscious and volLrntary, it could be deceitful. I can tell you that the cat is on the mat when in l,rt t she is not there. I can tell you 'l love you'when in lact I do r.rot. But discourse ,rlrou[ relationship is commonly accompanied by a mass of semi-voluntary lirrrcsic and autonomic signals which provide a more trustworthy comment on tlrt' verbal message.  

Similarly with skill, the lact of skill indicates the presence of large unconscious , rrrrrponents in the performance.  

It lhus becomes relevant to look at any work of art with the question: What r rrnr;)onents of this message material had what orders of unconsciousness (or' , onst'ioLrsness) lor the artist? And this question, I believe, the sensitive clitic rr',rr,rlly asl<s, though perhaps not consciously.  

Art becomes, in this sense, an exercise in communicating about the species of unconsciousness. Or, if you prefer it, a sort of play behaviour whose function is, amongst other things, to practice and make more perfect communication of this kind. [...]  

'lf I could tell you what it meant, there would be no point in dancing it.' [...]  

lsadora Duncan's remark [suggests thatl if the message were the sort of message that could be communicated in words, there would be no point in dancing it, but it is not that sort of message. lt is, in fact, precisely the sort of message that would be falsified if communicated in words, because the use of words (other than poetry) would imply that this is a fully conscious and voluntary message, and this would be simply untrue.  

I believe that what lsadora Duncan or any artist is trying to communicate is more lil<e: 'This is a particular sort of partly unconscious message. Let us engage in this particular sort of partly unconscious communication.' Or perhaps: 'This is a message about the interflace between conscious and unconscious.'  

The message of skill of any soft must always be of this kind. The sensations and qualities of sl<ill can never be put in words, and yet the fact of skill is conscious.  

The artist's dilemma is of a peculiar sort. He must practise in order to perform the craft components of his job. But to practise has always a double effect. It makes him, on the one hand, more able to do whatever it is he is attempting; and, on the other hand, by the phenomenon of habit formation, it mal<es him less aware of how he does it.  

lf his attempt is to communicate about the unconscious components of his performance, then it follows that he is on a sort of moving stairway (or escalator) about whose position he is trying to communicate but whose movement is itself a function of his efforts to communicate. Clearly, his task is impossible, but, as has been remarked, some people do it very prettily. [... ]  

# The Corrective Nature of Art  

It was noted above that consciousness is necessarily selective and partial, i.e. that the content ofconsciousness is, at best, a small part oftruth about the self. But if this part be selected in any systematic manner, it is certain that the partial truths of consciousness will be, in aggregate, a distortion of the truth of some larger whole.  

In the case of an iceberg, we may guess, from what is above surface, what sort of stuff is below; but we cannot make the same sort of extrapolation from the content of consciousness. lt is not merely the selectivity of preference, whereby the skeletons accumulate in the Freudian unconscious, that makes such extrapolalion unsound. Such a selection by preference would only promote optimism.  

what is serious is the cross-cutting of the circuitry of the mind. If, as we must believe, the total mind is an integrated networl< (of propositions, images, processes, neural pathology, or what have you - according to what scientific language you prefel to use), and i[the content of consciousness is only a sampling of different parts and localities in this network; then, inevitably, the conscious view of the network as a whole is a monstrous denial of the integration of that whole. From the cutting of consciousness, what appears above the surface is arcs of circuits instead of either the complete circuits or the larger complete circuits of circuits.  

what the unaided consciousness (unaided by art, dreams, and the lil<e) can never appreciate is the systemic natule of mind. [...]  

Characteristically, errors occur wherever the altered causal chain is part of some large or small circuit structure of system. And the remainder of our technology [...] bids fair to disrupr rhe rest ofour ecology. [...]  

The point [...] is that mere purposive rationality unaidecl by such phenomena as art, religion, dream, and the like, is necessarily pathogenic and destructive of life; and that its virulence springs specifically from the circumstance that life depends upon interlocking circuits of contingency, while consciousness can see only such short arcs of such circuits as human purpose may direct.  

In a word, the unaided consciousness must always involve man in the sort of stupidity of which evolution was guilty when she urged upon the dinosaurs the common-sense values of an armaments race. she inevitabty realized her mistake .r million years later and wiped them out. [...]  

That is the sort of world we live irr - a world of circuit structures - and love c.rn suryive only if wisdom (i.e. a sense or recognition of the fact olcircuitry) has rn effective voice. [...1  

Il]f art, as suggested above, has a positive function in maintaining what I c.rlled 'wisdom', i.e. in correcting a too purposive view of life and making the view more systemic, then the question to be asl<ed of the given worl< of art bccomes: what sorts of correction in the direction of wisdom would be achieved lry creatilg or viewing this work of art?  

The question becomes dynamic rather than static.

| .. I I r is probably an error to think of dream, myth and art as being about any one ilr.r[ter other than relationship. As was mentioned earlier, dream is metaphoric ,rrrcl is not particularly about the relata mentioned in the dream. In the , onventional interpretation of dream, another set of relata, often sexual, is for the set in the dream. But perhaps by doing this we only create dream. There indeed is no a priori reason for supposing that the sexual rcl.rt.r are any more primary or basic than any other set.  

In genera[, artists are very unwilling to accept interpretations ofthis sort, and it is not clear that their objection is to the sexual nature of the interpretation. Rather, it seems that rigid focusing upon any single set of relata destroys for the artist the more profound significance of the work. If the picture were only about sex or only about social organization, it would be trivial. lt is non-trivial or prolound precisely because it is about sex and social organization and cremation, and other things. [n a word, it is only about relationship and not about cny identifiable relata. [...]

[...]We had been moving in many ways towards a sense that a solution to the ecological crisis would demand a new definition of the individual, a definition by which the arguments of 'economic man' would cease to be relevant, one that would retain a sense of the vividness of persons and at the sane time allow each person to identify with natural process. To learn to love, we would need to recognize ourselves as systems, the beloved as systemic, similar and lovely in complexity, and to see ourselves at the same time as merged in a single system with the beloved.

# lleinz von Foerster Cybernetics of Cybernetics/ / 197 3  

[...] Here is [a] proposition, which I shall now baptize'Humberto Maturana's Theorem Number One':  

Anything said is said by ar-r observer.'  

Should you at first glance be unable to sense the profundity that hides behind the simplicity of this proposition let me remind you of [Charles] West Churchman's admonition of this afternoon: 'You will be surprised how much can be said by a tautology'. This, of course, he said in utter defiance of the logician's claim that a tautology says nothing.  

I would like to add to Maturana's Theorem a corollary which, in all modesty, I shall call 'Heinz von Foerster's Corollary Number One':  

'Anything said is said fo an observer.'  

With these two propositions a non-trivial connection between three concepts has been established. First, that of an observer who is characterized by being able to make descriptions. This is because of Theorem 1. Of course, what an observer says is a description. The second concept is that of language. Theorem and Corollary 1 connect two observers through language. But, in turn, by this connection we have established the third concept I wislr to consider, namely that of society: the two observers constitute the elementary nucleus for a society. Let me repeat the three concepts that are in a triadic fashion connected to each other. They are: first, the observers; second, the language they use; and third, the society they form by the use of their language. This interrelationship can be compared, perhaps, with the interrelationship between the chicken and the egg and the rooster. You cannot say who was first and you cannot say who was last. You need all three in order to have all three. In order to appreciate what t am going to say it might be advantageous to keep this closed triadic relation in mind.  

I have no doubts that you share with me the conviction that the central problems of today are societal. On the other hand, the gigantic problem-solving conceptual apparatus that evolved in our western culture is counter_productive not only for solving but essentially for perceiving social problems. one root for our cognitive blind spot that disables us to perceive social problems is the traditional explanatory paradigm which rests on two operations: one is ccuscfron, the other one deduction. tt is interesting to note that something that cannot be explained - that is, for which we cannot show a cause or for which we do not have a reason - we do not wish to see. In other words, something that cannot be explained cannot be seen. This is driven home again and again by Don Juan, a Yaqui lndian, carlos Casteneda's mentor. It is quite clear that in his teaching eflorts DonJuan wants to make a cognitive blind spot in Castaneda's vision to be filled with new perceptions; he wants to make him 'see'. This is doubry difficult, because of castaneda's dismissal of experiences as 'illusions' for which he has no explanations on the one rrand, and because of a pecuriar ploperty of the logical s[ructure of the phenomenon 'blind spot' on the other hand; and this is that we do not perceive our blind spot by, ror instance, seeing a brack spot crose to the centre of our visual field: we do not see that we have a blind spot. ln other words, we do not see that we do not see. This I will call a second order deficiency, and the only way to overcome such deficiencies is with therapies of second order.  

The popularity of carlos castaneda's bool<s suggest to me that his points are being understood: new paradigms emerge. r'm using the term ,paradigm' in the sense of Thomas l(uhn, who wants to indicate with this term a curture-specific, language-specific, stereotype or model for linking descriptions semantica[y. may remember, Thomas l(uhn argues that there is a major change in paradigms when the one in vogue begins to fail, shows inconsistencies or r ontradictions. I, however, argue that I can name at least two instances in which emergent defectiveness of the dominant paradigm but its very ll.rwlessness is the cause lor its rejection. one of these instances was Copernicus, rr,vc'l vision of a heliocentric planetary system which he perceived at a time the Ptolemaic geocentric system was at its height as to accuracy of its lrrcrlictions. The other instance, I submit, is being brought about today by some rrs who cannot - by their life - pursue any longer the flawless but sterile path tlr,rt cxplores the properties seen to reside within objects, and turn around to their very proper-ties seen now to reside within the observer of these co'sider, for instance,'obscenity'. There is at periodic intervals a ritual lr.rlir'r.ed by the supreme judges of this land in which they attempt to establish lor all a list ofall the properties that define an obscene object or act. "rrrt t' rbscenity is not a property residing within things (for if we show Mr X a lr,rilrring and he calls it obscene, we know a lot about Mr X but very little about when our rawmakers wiil finally come up with their imaginary list w,' ''lr.rll I<now a lot about them but their laws will be dangerous nonsense.

.Thepropertiesoftheobservershallnotenterthedescriptionofhis observations.'  

Butlasl<,howwoulditbepossibletomakeadescriptioninthefirstplaceif not the observer were to have properties that allows for a description to be made?Hence,lsubmitinallmodesty,theclaimforobjectivityisnonsense!one mightbe tempted tonegate‘objectivity'andstipulatenow'subjectivity.But pleaseremember thatif a nonsensicalproposition isnegated,the result is again a nonsensical proposition.However,the nonsensicality of these propositions either in the affirmative or in theirnegation cannot beseen in the conceptual frameworkinwhich thesepropositionshavebeen uttered.If thisisthestate of affairs, what can be done? We have to ask a new question:  

'What are the properties of an observer?'

Yes and No!  

tying for me to report to you that the essential conceptual oftheobserverhavebeenworkedout'Theoneisacalculusof ;ltheotheroneisacalculusofself-reference.2Withthese calculi we are now able to enter rigorously a conceptual framework which deals with observingandnotonlywith theobserved.  

EarlierIproposedthatatherapyofthesecondorderhastobeinventedin order todealwith dysfunctionsofthesecondorder.I submit thatthecybernetics ofobserved systems we may consider to be first-order cybernetics;while second-order cybernetics is the cybernetics of observing systems.This is in agreement with another formulation that has been given by Gordon Pask.He. too.distinguishes two ordersof analysis.The one inwhich the observer enters the systemby stipulating the system's purpose.We may call this afirst-order stipulation'.In a'second-order stipulation'the observer enters the system by stipulatinghis ownpurpose.

'l-he act of indicating any being, object, thing or unity involves making an oct of distinction which distinguishes what has been indicated as separate from its b.rckground. Each time we refer to anything explicitly or implicitly, we are slrecifying a criterion of distinction, which indicates what we are talking about ,rnd specifies its properties as being, unity or object.  

This is a commonplace situation and not unique: we are necessarily and pt'r'nranently immersed in it.  

A unity (entity, object) is brought lorth by an act of distinction. Conversely, r',rt h time we refer to a unity in our descriptions, we are implying the operation ol rlistinction that defines it and makes it possible. [...]  

Wlrt'n we speak of living beings, we presuppose something in common between tlrtrrr; otherwise we wouldn't put them in the same class we designate with the rr,rrrrt''living'. What has not been said, however, is: What is that organization that r lr l irrt's them as a class? Our proposition is that living beings are characterized in t I r, rt , I ilc r.r lly, they are continually self-producing. We indicate this process when rv' r ,rll tlre organization that defines them an autopoietic organization.[...]  

The most stril<ing feature of an autopoietic system is that it pulls itself up by its own bootstraps and becomes distinct from its environment through its own dynamics, in such a way that both things are inseparable.  

Living beings are characterized by their autopoietic organization. They difler from each other in their structure, but they are alil<e in their organization.  

By realizing what characterizes living beings in their autopoietic organization, we can unify a whole lot of empirical data about [them]. The concept of autopoiesis [...] explicitly proposes that such data be interpreted from a specific point of view which stresses that living beings are autonomous unities.  

We use the word 'autonomy' in its current sense; that is, a system is autonomous if it can specify its own laws, what is proper to it. We are not proposing that living beings are the only autonomous entities. Certainly they are not. But one of the most evident features of a living being is its autonomy. We cre proposing that the mechanism that makes living beings autonomous systems is autopoiesis. This characterizes them as autonomous systems. [ ... I  

That living beings have an organization, of course, is proper not only to them but also to everything we can analyse as a system. What is distinctive about them, however, is that their organization is such that their only product is themselves, with no separation between producer and product. The being and doing oI an autopoietic unity are inseparable, and this is their specific mode of organization. [... I  

Ontogeny is the history of structural change in a unity without loss of organization in that unity. This ongoing structural change occurs in the unity from moment to moment, either as a change triggered by interactions coming from the environment in which it exists or as a result of its internal dynamics. As regards its continuous interactions with the environment, the cell unity classifies them and sees them in accordance with its structure at every instant. That structure, in turn, continuously changes because of its internal dynamics. The overall result is that the ontogenic transformation oIa unity ceases only with its disintegration. [...]  

Now, what happens wlren we consider the ontogeny of, rrot one, but two (or more) neighbouring unities in their medium of interaction?  

We can Iook at this situation, of course, lrom the perspective of either one of the unities, and it will be symmetrical. This means that, for the cell on the left, the one on the right is only one mole source of interactions, indistinguishable from those which we, as observers, classify as coming from the 'inert' environment. Conversely, for the cell on the right, the other is one more source of interactions encountered according to its own structure.  

This means that two (or more) autopoietic unities can undergo coupled ontogenies when their interactions tal<e on a recurrent or more stable nature. We have to l<eep this clearly in mind. Every ontogeny occurs within an environment; we, as observers, can describe both as having a particular structure such as diffusion, secretion, temperature. ln describing autopoietic unity as having a particular structure, it will become clear to us that the interactions (as long as they are recurrent) between unity and environment will consist of reciprocal perturbations. In these interactions, the structure of tlre environment only triggers structural changes in the autopoietic unities (it does not specify or direct them), and vice versa for the environment. The result will be a history of mutual congruent structural changes as long as the autopoietic unity and its containing environment do not disintegrate: lhere will be a structural coupling. [...]  

Our discussion has led us to conclude that, biologically, there is no 'transmitted information' in communication. Communication takes place each time there is behavioural coordination in a realm ofstructural coupling.  

This conclusion is surprising only if we insist on not questioning the latest metaphor for communication which has become popular with the so-called communication media. According to this metaphor of the tube, communication is something generated at a certain point. It is carried by a conduit (or tube) and is delivered to the receiver at the other end. Hence there is a somefhing that is communicated, and what is communicated is an integral part of that which travels in the tube. Thus we usually speak of the 'information' contained in a picture, an object, or, more evidently, the printed word.  

According to our analysis, this metaphor is basically false. It presupposes a Lrnity that is not determined structurally, where interactions are instructive, as though what happens to a system in an interaction is determined by the perturbing agent and not by its structural dynamics. lt is evident, however, even in daily life, that such is not the case with communication: eaclr person says what he says or hears what he hears according to his own structural cletermination; saying does not ensure listening. From the perspective o[ an observer, there is always ambiguity in a communicative interaction. The ;thelrornenon of communication depends on not what is transmitted, but on what happens to the person who receives it. And this is a very diflerent matter I ronr'transmitting information'. [... I  

t)r'ganisms and societies belong to one class of metasystems; these consist of ,tsgregates of autonomous unities that can be cellular or metacellular. An oltserver can distinguish the different metasystems of this class by the different rlcgrees of autonomy he sees possible in their components. Thus, ilhe should put thcnr in a series according to the degree ofdependency oftheir components (in rlrcir embodiment as autonomous unities) on their participation in the metasystem they form, organisms and human social systems would be at the opposite ends of the series. Organisms would be metasystems of components with minimum autonomy, i.e., components with very little or no dimension of independent existence. [... ]  

As metacellular systems, organisms have operational closure in the reciprocal structural coupling of their component cells. The central feature in the organization olan organism lies in its manner of being a unity in an environment wherein it must operate with stable properties that permit it to conserve its adaptation, whatever the properties of its components may be. [...]  

IHluman social systems [...] have operational closure, too, in the structural coupling of their components. But human social systems exist also as unities for their components in the realm of language. Therefore, the identity of human social systems depends on the conservation of adaptation of human beings not only as organisms (in a general sense) but also as components of their linguistic domains. [...]  

[Clentral to the operation of a human social system is the linguistic domain that its components generate and the extension of their properties - a condition necessary for the embodiment of language, which is their realm or domain of existence. The organism restricts the individual creativity of its component unities, as these unities exist lor that organism. The human social system amplifies the individual creativity of its components, as that system exists for these components. [... ]  

Coherence and harmony in relations and interactions between the members o[ a human social system are due to the coherence and harmony of their growth in it, in an ongoing social learning which their own social (linguistic) operation defines and which is possible thanks to the genetic and ontogenetic processes that permit structural plasticity of the members.

# Donellc H. Meqdows Dcnclng with Systems/ /2AO  

[...] People who are raised in the industrial world and who get enthused about systems thinking are likely to make a terrible mistake. They are likely to assume that here, in systems analysis, in interconnection and complication, in the power of the computer, here at last, is the l<ey to prediction and control. This mistake is likely because the mindset of the industrial world assumes that there is a key to prediction and control. [...1  

But self-organizing, non-linear, feedback systems are inherently unpredictable. They are not controllable. They are understandable only in the most general way. The goal of foreseeing the future exactly and preparing for it perfectly is unrealizable. The idea of mal<ing a complex system do just what you want it to do can be achieved only temporarily, at best. We can never fully understand our world, not in the way our reductionistic science has led us to expect. Our science itself, lrom quantum theory to the mathematics of chaos, leads us into irreducible uncertainty. For any objective other than the most trivial, we can't optimize; we don't even know what to optimize. We can't l<eep track of everything. We can't find a proper, sustainable relationship to nature, each other, or the institutions we create, if we try to do it from the role of omniscient conqueror. [. .. I  

Systems thinking leads to another conclusion, however - waiting, shining, obvious, as soon as we stop being blinded by the illusion of control. It says that there is plenty to do, of a dilferent sort of 'doing'. The future can't be predicted, but it can be envisioned and brought lovingly into being.  

Systems can't be controlled, but they can be designed and redesigned. We can't surge forward with certainty into a world of no surprises, but we can expect surprises and learn from them and even profit from them. We can't impose our will upon a system. We can listen to what the system tells us, and discover how its properties and our values can work together to bring forth something much better than could ever be produced by our will alone.  

We can't control systems or figure them out. But we can dance with them!  

I already knew that, in a way before I began to study systems. I had learned about dancing with great powers from whitewater kayaking, from gardening, from playing music, from skiing. All those endeavours require one to stay wideawake, pay close attention, participate flat-out and respond to feedback. It had never occurred to me that those same requirements might apply to intellectual work, to management, to government, to getting along with people.  

But there it was, the message emerging from every computer model we made.  

Living successfully in a world of systems requires more of us than our ability to calculate. lt requires our full humanify - our rationalify, our ability to sort out truth from falsehood, our intuition, our compassion, our vision and otrr morality. [. . . I  

# 1. Get the beat  

Before you disturb the system in any way, watch how it behaves. If it's a piece of music or a whitewater rapid or a fluctuation in a commodity price, study its beat. lf it,s a social system, watch it work. Learn its history. Ask people who've been around a long time to tell you what has happened. [..']  

Starting with the behaviour of the system forces you to focus on facts, not theories. lt keeps you from falling too quickly into your own beliefs or misconceptions, or those otothers. [...]  

Starting with the behaviour of the system directs one's thoughts to dynamic, not static analysis - not only to 'what's wrong?' but also to 'how did we get there?' and 'what behaviour modes are possible?' and 'if we don't change direction, where are we going to end up?' ['. . I  

# 2. Listen to the wisdom of the system  

Aid and encoulage the forces and structures that help the systetr rr.rn itself' Don't be an unthinking intervener and destloy the systetn's own self-maintenance capacities. Before you chatge in to make things better', pay atterrtion to the value of what's already there. [...]  

# 3. Expose your mental models to the open air  

Remember, always, that everything yotl know, and everything everyone knows, is only a model. Get your model out there where it calr be shot at. Invite others to challenge your assumptions and add their own. Inste.rd ol [ecorrling a champion for one possible explanation or hypothesis or model, collect as lllalry as possible' Consider all of them plausible until yott find some evicletrce that causes to rule one out. That way you will be emotionally able to see the evidence that rules out an assumption with which you might have cotrfttsecl voLrf own identity. [...]  

# 4. Stay humble. StaY a learner  

systems thinking has taught me to trust my ir.rtuitiorr nrore and my figuring-out rationality less, to lean on both as much as lcarr, but still to be prepared for surprises. working with systems, on the computer, itt tlatltre, among in organizations, constantly reminds me oI how incomplete rry mental models are, how complex the world is, and how much I don't know.  

The thing to do, when you don't know, is not to bluff and not to freeze, but to learn. The way you learn is by experiment - oI, as Br-rcl<minster Fuller it, by trial and error, error, error. ln a world of complex systems it is not appropriate to charge forward with rigid, undeviating directives. 'Stay the course' is only a good idea if you're sure you're on course. Pretendingyou're in control even when you aren't is a recipe not only for mistakes, but for not learning from mistakes. What's appropriate when you're learning is small steps, constant monitoring, and a willingness to change course as you find out more about where it's leading. [...]  

# 5- Honour and protect information  

A decision-maker can't respond to information he or she doesn't have, can't respond accurately to inlornration that is inaccurate, can't respond in a timely way to information that is late. I would guess that 99 percent of what goes wrong in systems goes wrong because of faulty or missing information.  

If I could, I would add an Eleventh Commandment: Thou shalt not distort, delay or sequester information. You can drive a system crazy by muddying its information streams. You can make a system work better with surprising ease if you can give it more timely, more accurate, more complete information. [...]  

# 6. Locate responsibility in the system  

Look lor the ways the system creates its own behaviour. Do pay attention to the triggering events, the outside influences that bring forth one kind of behaviour lrom the system rather than another. Sometimes those outside events can be controlled (as in reducing the pathogens in drinking water to keep down incidences of infectious disease). But sometimes they can't. And sometimes blaming or trying to control the outside influence blinds one to the easier task of increasing responsibility within the system.  

'lntrinsic responsibility' means that the system is designed to send feedback .rbout the consequences of decision-making directly and quickly and compellingly to the decision-makers. [...]  

# 7. Make feedback policies for feedback systems  

| ... I Yon can imagine why a dynamic, self-adjusting system cannot be governed lry.r static, unbending policy. It's easier, more effective, and usually much cheaper to clcsign policies that change depending on the state of the system. Especially whcr-e there are great uncertainties, the best policies not only contain feedback loops, bnt meta-feedback loops - loops that alter, correct and expand loops. llrt,sc.rre policies that design learning into the management process.  

# ll. I'l.ry attention to what is important, notjust what is quantifiable  

( ultLlre, obsessed with numbers, has given us the idea that what we can rrr',r\urc is rnore important than what we can't measure. You can lool< around and make up your own mind about whether quantity or quality is the outstanding characteristic of the world in which you live.  

If something is ugly, say so. lf it is tacky, inappropriate, out of proportion, unsustainable, morally degrading, ecologically impoverishing, or humanly demeaning, don't let it pass. Don't be stopped by the 'if you can't define it and measure it, I don't have to pay attention to it' ploy. No one can precisely define or measure justice, democracy, security, freedom, truth or love. No one can precisely define or measure any value. But if no one speaks up for them, if systems aren't designed to produce them, if we don't speak about them and point toward their presence or absence, they will cease to exist.  

# 9. Go for the good of the whole  

Don't maximize parts of systems or subsystems while ignoring the whole. [...1 Aim to enhance total systems properties, such as creativity, stability, diversity, resilience and sustainability - whether they are easily measured or not.  

As you think about a system, spend part of your time from a vantage point that lets you see the whole system, not jr-rst the problem that may have drawn you to focus on the system to begin with. And realize that, especially in the short term, changes for the good of the whole may sometimes seelr to be counter to the interests of a part of the system. lt helps to remember tlrat the parts of a system cannot survive without the whole. [...]  

# 10. Expand time horizons  

The olficial time horizon of industrial society doesrr't extencl beyond what will happen after the next election or beyond the payb.rcl< period of current investments. The time horizon of most faurilies still extends Lrr'tlrer than that - through the lifetimes of children or grandchildren. [...] Tlre longer the operar.rt time horizon, the better the chances for survival.  

In the strict systems sense there is no lorrg-terut/short-tertr distinction. Phenomena at different timescales are nested witlrirr e.rch other. Actions taken now have some immediate effects and sor.ne that racliate or-rt for decades to come. We experience now the conseqLlences of acrions set irt llolion yesterday and decades ago and centuries ago.[...1  

# 11. Expand thought horizons  

[...] Seeing systems whole requires more than being'inlerdisciplinary', if that word means, as it usually does, putting together people fi-om different disciplines and letting them talk past each other. tnterdisciplinaly communication works only il there is a real problem to be solved, and if the representatives from the various disciplines are more committed to solving the problem than to being academically correct. They will have to go into learning mode, to admit ignorance and be willing to be taught, by each other and by the system.  

It can be done. It's very exciting when it happens.  

# 12. Expand the boundary of caring  

Living successfully in a world of complex systems means expanding not only time horizons and thought horizons; above all it means expanding the horizons of caring. There are moral reasons for doing that, of course. And if moral arguments are not sufficient, then systems thinking provides the practical reasons to back up the moral ones. The real system is interconnected. No part of the human race is separate either from other human beings or from the global ecosystem. lt will not be possible in this integrated world for your heart to succeed if your lungs fail, or for your company to succeed if your worl<ers flail, or for the rich in Los Angeles to succeed if the poor in Los Angeles fail, or for Er,rrope to succeed if Africa fails, or for the global economy to succeed if the global environment fails. [... ]  

# 13. Celebrate complexity  

[... ] Let's face it, the universe is messy. tt is non-linear, turbulent and chaotic. It is dynamic. lt spends its time in transient behaviour on its way to somewhere else, not in mathematically neat equilibria. lt self-organizes and evolves. It creates diversity, not uniformity. That's what makes the world interesting, that's what mal<es it beautiful, and that's what mal<es it work. [...]  

# 14. Hold fast to the goal ofgoodness  

[...] The gap between desired behaviour and actual behaviour narrows. Fewer actions are taken to affirm and instill ideals. The public discourse is full of cynicism. Public leaders are visibly, unrepentantly, amoral or immoral and are not held to account. Idealism is ridiculed. Statements of moral belief are suspect. It is much easier to tall< about hate in public than to talk about love.  

We know what to do about eroding goals. Don't weigh the bad news more heavily than the good. And keep standards absolute. [...]  

And so we are brought to the gap between understanding and implementation. Systems thinl<ing by itself cannot bridge that gap. But it can lead us to the edge ol what analysis can do and then point beyond - to what can and must be done by the human spirit.

# CYBERNATED  

ART IS UERY IMPORTANT BUT ART FOR  

# CYBERNATED  

LIFEIS MOREIMPORTANT AND THE LATTER NEED NOT BE  

CYBERNATED  

Nqm June Pqik Cyberncrted Artll1966  

Cybernated art is very important, but art for cybernated life is more important, and the latter need not be cybernated.  

(Maybe Ceorge Brecht's simplissimo is the most adequate.)  

But ifPasteur and Robespierre are right that we can resist poison only through certain built-in poison, then some specific frustrations, caused by cybernated life, require accordingly cybernated shock and catharsis. My everyday worl< with video tape and the cathode-ray tube convinces me of this.  

Cybernetics, the science of pure relations, or relationship itself, has its origin in karma. Marshall Mcluhan's famous phrase'Media is message'was formulated by Norbert Wiener in 1948 as 'The signal, where the message is sent, plays equally important role as the signal, where the message is not sent.'  

As the Happening is the fusion ofvarious arts, so cybernetics is the exploitation ofboundary regions between and across various existing sciences.  

Newton's physics is the mechanics of power and the r,rr.rconciliatory twoparty system, in which the strong win over the weal<. But in the 1920s a German genius put a tiny third-party (grid) between these two miglrty poles (cathode and anode) in a vacuum tube, thus enabling the weal< to win over tlre strong lor the first time in human history. It might be a Br,rddhistic 'third way', but anyway this German invention led to cybernetics, which came to the world in the last war to shoot down German planes from the English sky.

# Roy Ascott The Gybernetic Stqnce: My Process crnd Purpose//1968  

[...] As distinctions betvveen music, painting, poetry, etc. become blurred snd medis qre mixed, a behaviourist synthesis is seen to evolve, inwhich dialogue and feedback within s social culture indicate the emergence of a Cybernetic vision in art as in science. |. . .l  

The Cybernetic Art Matrix is seen as a process in which anarchic group behaviour interscts with pre-established systems of communications, hardwsre and learning nets. ln both csses the processes are self-generating and self-critical. Basically they are initiated by creative behsviour, and in turn give rise to its extension in other people.  

# I  

The paradox we face as artists writing about our work is that the future is alI that interests us, and that is precisely the part of our activity which must remain necessarily unpredictable. For many of us there is a further paradox; we can see that, as the value of the commercial gallery declines and our interest in the art object as objecr diminishes, so the need lor new channels of communication between people increases, free access to new technology and media becomes imperative, and a new cultural situation inexorably evolves. The paradox lies in the fact that we continue to throw off art objects in the course of our creative work, while our eyes are set on the new horizon. We have undoubtedly become process-orienfed but we still deal with objects. [... I  

I am concerned, in short, with some kind of tangible philosophy, with ideas in action. Both CAM [Cybernetic Art Matrix] on a social scale and my individual artefacts on a intimate scale are essentially triggers. They contain nothing but the possibility offuture action; that is to say they exist only in so far as the spectator participates in their evolution by, on the one hand, interacting with other people within a complex social situation, and on the other hand by conducting a private interior dialogue.  

If the modern era in science and art and human allairs can be differentiated from previous eras, as the outward aspect of events would suggest, it must contain some unifying quality, some basic characteristics which are shared by artists, scientists and politicians alike. If we examine the apparently diverse tendencies in all these fields, we may discern a common vision. This vision, still clouded and imprecise, is characterized by a fundamental and mutual tendency: a tendency to the creation of dialogue. In previous periods of western society, art, science and politics have tended to be deterministic, absolutist, hierarchic. The channels of communication have been one-way channels, the flow of information has been in one clirection. ln each area of activity we find a closed system: an image is projected, a principle expouncled, a social relationship established, in each case, only to reinforce a fixed point of view, an absolute ideal, a permanent set of values.  

But now chonge is everywhere apparent. Human beings are mobile geographically and socially; the scientist not only observes an experiment, he participates in it; the artist's interest lies more in the process of working than in the finished art work, and his audience expects, not a fixed attitude or viewpoint to the work, but a field of uncertainty ancl ambiguity in which they can, endlessly' take part. In every area the system, so regarded, is open-ended; nothing is fixed' Today we are concerned less with the essence of things as with their behaviour; not what tlrey are but what they do. This trnified tendency is evidently behavioural, and we can see how the vision of our time is uttimately cybernetic'  

This new vision contrasts forcibly with the old attitudes. Henri Bergson [...1 revealed repeatedly in his Philosophy of C|tange the nature of the new situation. 'The role of life is to insert some indeterminotion into matter' .'. 'The living are relatively stable, and counterfeit immobility so well that we treat each of them as thing rather than as progl'ess, forgetting that the very permanence of their fonn is only the outline of a movement.'r A shift of hr-rman interest is from the thing, the object, the product, to the process' the system, the event in which the product is obtained. The history of modern art, with its roots in that same period, is the history of this shift; a radical move which, as it evolves, may take us into a culture more exhilarating and free than previously we might have imagined possible'  

# II  

I am suggesting that a behaviourisf framework can be constructed from which to examine, not only the internal relations of modern art, but its social implications, and its potential contribution to our forming cybernetic ct-tlture. Everywhere in modern art, particularly in the visual/plastic arts, but also tlre more experimental reaches of music and literature, the emphasis is on behaviour, on what happens, on Process and system, the dynamic interplay ol random and ordered elements. [...]  

As for the spectator, he no longer expects to receive a ready-made experience, or the expression of an experience, but rather to participate at a deep level, either in lris consciousness or, more physically, by immediate action' The artist no longer decides everything and projects it as a whole in some definitive and final composition; he now initiates a dialogue' or set oI events, which, when taken up by the audience, whether in a group or inclividually, will be shaped into totally unpredictable and indeterminate forms and experiences' ["'l  

We .tre entering an era in which everyone tal<es responsibility for the common r rrlttrr.c, by participating in the decisions and actions which will inform it.  

As leedbacl< between persons increases and communications become more r,rpicl .rrrd precise, so the creative process no longer culminates in the arfwork, I rr rt cx tends beyond it deep into the life of each individual. Art is then determined rrot lty the creativity of the artist alone, but by the creative behaviour his work rrrrlrrces in the spectator, and in society at large. Where art of the old order r rrrrstituted a deterministic vision, so the art of or-rr- time tends towar-ds the t lt,vclopment oIa cybernetic vision, in which feedback, dialogue and involvement rr sotre creative interplay at deep levels of expet'ience are paramount. But a vision of our time, if it is truly representative, must embrace more than the ,rspir..rtions of its artists; it will include scientists, technologists, economists, all tlrose fields of hunran endeavour in which creativity is prime. And a common ,,lririt which can be called cybernefic infuses all these fields today. [...1  

I l]he cybernetic spirit, more than the method or the applied science, creates ,r t ontinuum of experience and knowledge which radically reshapes our plrilosophy, influences our behaviour and extends our thought. [...]  

can be no doubt that the cybernetic vision, as it emerges in our r orrsciousness, will rapidly effect great changes in the human condition.  

# ill  

I h.rve suggested tl'lat modern art may be best understood if it is examined in the trlltext of behavior.rr, that there is a fornring aesthetic of process and sysfem in wlrich the cardinal factors of feedback and interplay are consistent with a r vhcrnetic vision. [... I  

Where the behaviour of the artist is uppermost, where the focus is on the ,u tist's activity for its own sake, as for example in the case of Jacl<son Pollocl<, the , rt l i on painter in h i s a rena, we can see that aspect of art as behavioural ritual. Action ir which chance plays a large part was a characteristic of Surrealism, and, ,rs in the case of Duchamp, the act of random choice can become ritualized to the tlt'gree of dispensing with the fabrication of art objects altogether. Once the ,rt tiolt or event becomes all-important, 'happenings' are an inevitable ( (,r)seqLrence. People interacting freely in groups, producing un[amiliar situations, ( ,lt.rlysing perhaps further group responses, constitLlte an art situation.  

Wlrere the artist is interested less in his own behaviour than in the behaviour rrl the spectator his work may be seen specifically as a behavioural trigger.The r(,sponse in an observer might be elicited in a number of ways: physically, in the irrrrlediate sense of a highly intensive optical activity induced by visual stimuli r rc.rtir.rg flicker, after-images, spatial ambiguity and uncertainty of figure-ground rt'l.rtionships; or manually, where the nature of the artefact induces the spectatol to alter the position of its parts; or again a postural response may be effected, with the observer moving about, shifting position, so that images merge and transform, and in so doing encourage this activity as the sole relationship possible between artefact and the human being.  

Artworl(s may also trigger off responses of a polemical or social kind, encouraging in their audience changes in individual or group behaviour by questioning preconceptions, destroying illusions by means o[ the shock of unfamiliar, absurd or incongruous imagery. Within the same context a more sober, dialectical construction of abstract values has been developed to present the observer with the possibility of new social behaviour.  

Again, the artist's main interest may lie not in his own behaviour, nor in that of the observer, but more especially in the behaviour of the objects he mal<es. These behavioural structures literally behave in the sense of articulating their various parts in response to internal or external stimuli. The medium may be light moving onto surfaces, themselves moving perhaps, or fins of metal dependent on the impact of air currents to push themselves round. They may be structures internally powered by electricity or some hydraulic device. Another possibility, dramatically demonstrated by Tinguely li.e. Homage to New York, 19601, is the built-in capacity systematically to destroy itself. We must look to the future and the research of, for example, Stafford Beer or Gordon Pask, for those 'fungoid systems' and chemical-colloidal computors which might make possible the creation of behavioural structures invested with the properties of growth. [...]  

The behaviourist tendency [...] implies a total behavioural involvement in which all our senses are brought into play, not simply visual, but postural, tactile and including the sense of hearing and even of taste and smell. In short, a behaviourist synfhesis is forming where the boundaries between the once highly differentiated arts of music, poetry, painting, architecture, sculpture and acting are becoming less distinct. The media merge, and at the same time the distinction between the roles of artist and audience becomes blurred. The artwork or event is a matrix between two sets of behaviour, which through it become one, continuous and interrelated. lnevitably a state of perfect feedback will emerge, where we all both initiate and involve ourselves in total creative situations. [...]  

# IV  

I have already said that both these artefacts and the CAM-complex are intended to function as triggers, and that the former are in some good sense models for the latter. They are part of the same overall process, they proceed from the same stance. That is, to initiate dialogue, to involve other people in creative behaviour, engaging more of the senses than the purely visual one alone. Presenting, not a set o[ ideas or a personal expression of feelings, but a situation in which other people'sideasandfeelingscanbesetinmotion,generatingquite unpredictable experience.This processis deterministiconly in the sense that it is aimed at elciting creative thought and action in the community.The specifics of that action and of the directionsmyprocessesmay takeare equallyunpredictable and open-ended.Each situation,as it emerges,will have its own controlling energy.andthusmywork,initsimplications,isessentiallycybernetic.Afunction orthe outputvariable(social,individualresponse)is toactasan inputvariable mmyworkingprocessandintheart-work/experience,sointroducingcontinually more and more variety into the system....]

Siephen WillatsMy development of concepts andmodels is related toa piception of thefunction of the artist inrelationto theworld.Iwasconscious ofthefact that theworkIwas proposingwas goingtobe partof society.Aninitial bservationwasthat artworkiscompletely dependentonits audience.Wecould almost sayviewers areitsreasonforbeing:withoutthemit doesn'texistIt is esential for artists to realize they are somehow partofsociety.The next observation was that most art practice was describing existing values and beliefs, amplifying what was validated in existing society. Then there was another smaller, much more difficult but ultimately more meaningful role, concerning transformation; the notion that the artist can transform existing values and provide a vision of the future, a different perception of the world, and a language for that. I saw that practice was nothing more than a vehicle, embodying the language. You have got to have a model to represent reality; models are representations ofan external, encountered or possible reality.  

pethick Diagrams have been a central aspect ofyout practice from very early on' They are used as a language for forming models, but also as a tool for planning projects. your use of them was also influenced by exposure to theories outside art, like cybernetics, systems theories, black box theory.  

Wiltats The diagram is a dynamic picture, a model in a dynamic state' I saw that other languages were needed to provide a vision of a future possible world. The languages available to me in the world of historical art wele inadequate to describe the new reality, the new world I was encountering (in the late 1950s and early 60s), that seemed to be emerging. So I became interested in languages from outside art. The emerging sciences of cybernetics and information theory were especially exciting, as wete the nascent philosophies of semiotics. All l<inds of new ways of thinking were appearing and could be drawn into practice' lt was just a natural way of representing ideas and social relationships in a dynamic way. lf the artist was in a relationship with the audience, and the audience was part of society, the artist was in a relationship with society, so there was feedback' This is how my diagrams originated.  

Pethick One o[ the most striking early works is Homeostat Drowing (1969)' This diagram depicts an endless network ofinterconnecting Parts. Can you talk about where this came from, what it represents as a social model?  

Willsts ln the mid 1960s I encountered the worl< of Ross Ashby, who developed the homeostat. His representation was a model with four nodes' totally interconnected by input-output relationships. The irnportant thing for me was thatit showeda possibleformofrelationshipsandinformationwithinsociety. Though I don't think Ashby saw it this way; his was a mechanical model. NeverthelessI could glimpse social ramifications.The homeostat model posed another notionillustrating the difference between our historical systems of control - where information is contained within a set hierarchy - and the idea of a continually shifting, self-determining system. This is another model of control, make information available throughout structures, so this one-layer networl< could be seen as a new social model. I was interested in the notion of another society, moving away from the straitjacket I perceived in the 1950s. This early work led to simulation works showing a decision-mal<ing model of society based on rnutual cooperation, like vrsual Homeostotic lnformation Mesh (1969) and visual Homeoststic Maze (1968). These simulations represented the self-organizing nrodel of society in a dynamic state, and involved people in making decisions .rbout their relationships with others. t have always been interested in cooperation, .r comparative critique between competition and cooperation in decision making.  

Pethick The Homeosf at Drawing is also based on an idea of agreement, a frequent rrotion in your worl<, especially in later worl<s like Metq Filter (1973-75).  

Willats Yes, I saw agreement as a fundamental state. Agreement is not compliance, .rcqr.riescence; it involves perceptual recognition of mutuality. It requires a complex scries of exchanges. Agreement is a social state between people, not a rrechanistic thing; if one is conforming it may seem like agreement, but it is not.  

I\,thick The concept of self-organization is something you wete interested in vt'ry early on, and explored in different ways: the individual's capacity to selforgrnize; non-conformity regarding imposed social structures. Resistance to , ontr-ol emerges when you look, for example, at the planned environment, at lrrw tower blocks or modernist housing structure people's lives, how their rrrh.rbitants develop their own subcultures and languages.  

lvil/rrf.s Absolutely. In the early 1970s Iwas consciously looking for polemics to rr'l)rcsent in my worl<, and I thought about externalizing these observations and rrl.',rs. lsawthatpeoplewereinastateof whatlcall counter-consciousness: they lrv.t I in a reality that was determined for them in a mechanistic way. They had to ,rrl,rpt to it, so they created their own counterculture. I don't thinl< this movement , r l( )r(.e was rationalized, that came later with the post-punks in the early 80s; it \v.r', ,l so|t of basic human reaction to a crushing state of determinism. I felt the 'Irrrt ol'self-organization was alive even in the most depressing environments. I rrrrrrr t'(l this in tower blocl<s, where residents were isolated from external reality, t,lrv',rt.rllV and socially, but still fought back and managed to create a l<ind of 1'rrrlrolit society lor themselves, to find mutual relationships. Tbe development "l .r r,rrrtcr-consciousness was really important; without it, people would have , ,'ll.rprt'tl. It helped them to maintain their own identity.  

r" r//rr /' You have talked a lot about the artist as someone concerned with transformatiorr, also in relation to the individual's capacity to transfor m, through the works you have made on housing estates.  

Willats I saw my practice as a way of engaging with other people, lorwarding a vision ofsociety that has to be in a language people can understand. The traditional art world has its own special, exclusive languages. People know this, and I wanted to extend the meaning of my work beyond this exclusive environment. I had to find a way to build a bridge and make my propositions rneaningful to them. That meant creating a symbolic world for an audience to enter, and articulating this symbolic world in a familiar language. The most appropriate language was their language, so embodying the audience's language in the work helped me to create the symbolic world too. One thing was to set up a relationship with the audience, a feedbacl< between creator and observer of the work. The audience entering the symbolic world cou[d mal<e inferences to their own reality, looking at the world around them, then seeing how it could be transformed. I was working with people on the margins, alienated lron the normal, predetermined behaviour of society. At the time, people said this was crazy and tried to stop me, but I said no: these people are important to the future because they embody the act of transformation, developing other languages to denote other ways olviewing future society. [...]  

Pethick Reading your collected writings in the book Art Society Feedbsck (2010), there are some recurring principles of your work that become clear, connected to a reluctance to see things as fixed, or from one perspective, favouring dynamic states, open systems, acl<nowledging the complexity of people and experiences. This is something that can be addressed using the language of the diagrarn, but also thlough worl<ing with people, involving multiple ar.tthors. To explore more than one perspective, coexistences, multiple channels, uncertainties. Something very striking in your work is tl]at you have often resisted a singular, autlroritative perspective, in flavour ofopen situations.  

Willats What is fr-rndamental to these models is the idea of self-organization and cooperation. I'm interested in acknowledgement ol relativity, transience, fluidity, complexity. I think in the last three decades sorre very intportant things have become guiding principles. These ideas didn't exist in the 1930s,40s or 50s. Lastcentury thinl<ing said the world was sinple, authoritative, monumental, immortal, etc., but in the world currently opening r-rp before us we acknowledge the richness of complexity, transience, n-rulti-channel fluidity, self-organization.  

# Steinq ctnd Woody Vcsulkcr Woody's Fqmous Feedbcrck Rop/ / 197 3  

Woody [...] We look at video leedback as electronic art material. It's a building material for an image. lt's totally abundant in its electronic nature. It's the clay, it's the air, it's the energy, it's the stone, it's the raw material that you simply use, and then build an image with it. And video feedback is very much what audio feedback is abour. You use the relationship between a camera and a monitor the same way you use the relationship between a speaker and a microphone. An ambient noise is amplified through this cycle, and gets amplified further and further, until it results in almost unbearable sound. In video, of course, it happens on a much smaller volume scale. The image basically builds, it increases its volume, but at a certain point it does not increase anymore. It discharges its cycle, and then builds the image again and again.  

Now you can o[ course influence the process: the speed of development or the direction of the feedback within a field; you can influence tlre left to right or the right to left development, in the sense of a spiral. These are allthings, through discovery of working with feedback and through sets of errors, you can define what controls of the camera/monitor relationship to use to shape the feedbacl<. Now we usually work with brightrress, with f/stop on the lens, and the zoom: these are the major things, and then with the position of the monitor to the camera, or the position of the camera to the monitor. We can increase the intensity of the development and its complexity. And we can also simplify. We can somehow filter certain details out of the process. Feedback does not always have to develop into organic flow, like clay or electronic matter which increases in strange blobs of light. It can also be used simply as a mirror effect, if you zoom in .rnd out you can see the frame; you can use the feedback as a mirror effect which again has its directions and laws. lf you turn the camera, you get a curving cltect, you can go up and down, and you can actually control that.  

Now, if you use multi-monitors, or- split screen effects, you can of course influence with different images the final composition. what's interesting abor,rt It't'clback is that any part of the image changes the composition of the whole lr'.rme. lf a person wall<s in feedback, every minor movement or position within llr.rt rrame organically changes the whole structure, even if it's not detectable. so llr.rt rneaus the integration between the objectand electronic feedback is total, llrcre's no division. It's not a passive process, superimposition, or palts of r .llrging or matting. It's an organic influence to the image. Now, we usually don't wor.k witl.r a single feedbacl<. We usually use feedbacl< as part of the frame, or, as in the last composition we did, the leedback as a set, controlled in a monitor becoming part of the set. We built that environment for that particular purpose.  

Steina That feedback can also be the spice of the image, the flavouring that you don't really have to see, and itjust shapes around whatever object you have; it mal<es an aura or makes the object more shape-like. And it can also become a mirror effect of whatever object that it repeats into the frame; it's the dimension, it's the space builder. And as you said before, every object that moves affects the feedback, and the feedbacl< allects every object that moves, a mutual manipulation of the real image that's being used, or it can be a synthesized image that's used, and the feedback merging together.  

Woody What I would stress the most about feedback is that it itself could lead into all aspects of video; discovering and worl<ir.rg with it, it demonstrated all phases of video, yet it may not possess aesthetic quality by itself. What it did to us was to give us the clues to the behaviour of an electronic image, because the sets of clues in tl-re behaviour of feedback are so obvious and so explicit that if you have the imagination to extend that clue into the expression, then you l.rave nraterial which you can learn to control. Of course, the control of feedback is a painful process; it may become frustrating because it is somehow always the same, and somehow always has a similar development, br.rt if you don't really depend on it, if you l<now how to control it you can really go very far away from the basic.

# Zcbet Pcrtterson From the Gun Controller to the Mcrndcric: The Cybernetic Cir:emq of John qnd Jqmes Whitney//zAOq  

In Los Angeles in the late 1950s, John Whitney started purchasing junl<: 'mechanical junk excreted from army depots across the country... Junk such as brand new thirty-thousand dollar anti-aircraft specialized analogue ballistic problem-solver computers dating back to World War II'.' He transformed this n-rilitary-spec surplus into a machine for creating experimental animation - literally and metaphorically retooling a device that had itself served to remake human vision for modern war. A twin of this machine would enable John's brother James to create the 1966 film Lapis, a work P. Adams Sitney would describe as 'the most elaborate example of a mandala in cinema'.2 [. . . ]  

The worl< began with hand-painted plates. These were used as input for a system that utilized the junked 'hardware from war surplus: selsyn motors to interlock ca[rera functions with artwork motions; ball integrators to preset rate programming of some motions; and differential assemblies to control the incremental advance of the motions as each frame advanced'.3 As John Whitney later stated, 'it was astonishing to discover the variety of orderly patterns generated by as random a source as these dot patterns. The original artwork contains no hint of the patterns that were produced'.a The formal properties of this mandala emerge in dialogue with the apparatus used to create it - the gun controller, a mechanical analogue computer that was a precursor to contemporary computational technology. ln this dialogue is crystallized an entire subterranean history of vision and computation that reverberates into the present.  

William Moritz situated Lapis in an artisanal tradition of experimental film animation that moved from Hans Richter and Vil<ing Eggeling in the 1920s through Len Lye and Oskar Fischinger to the West Coast school with which the Whitneys were involved.s Gene Youngblood - writing at mr-rch the same time as Moritz - chose to situate Lapis in a different trajectory, placing it under the auspices of the human-machine feedbacl< loop. Youngblood's rhetoric is precise: he does not call these works computer fllms or graphic animations but situates them as 'cybernetic cinema'.6 In using this terminology Youngblood himself was riding a wave of pop media criticism that began wlren Br-rckminster Fuller and Marshall McLuhan a few years prior latched onto cybernetic as a descriptive catchphrase for a diverse range of phenomena from visual media to child psychology. The term's origin, however, can be more precisely located as a theory of messages and information control developed through military research in anti-aircraft technology during and after World War II. During the 1960s, cybernetics had eclipsed these early beginnings to become a more general means o[ considering and analogizing the organization of bodies - both human and machinic. As such, cybernetics became part of the foundation for an emerging discourse of both human-machine interaction and computational representation. Youngblood's rhetoric situated the Whitneys' films not simply as works made with a computer but as works engaged with this larger field. youngblood also understood the whitneys as engaged with the questions the computational turn raised for concepts of representation and visuality and the disciplining of perception in the postwar era. [...]  

ln the late 1950s, John Whitney continued his experiments in machinerealized art, constructing a machine that he had first imagined during his wartime work at Locl<heed. A duplicate of this machine sat in James Whitney's studio.T [...] Here, James practised yoga, filmmaking, computer animation, Japanese brush painting and raku pottery, and also studied Taoism and nuclear physics. Here, in the centre, or perhaps oflf to the side, was the bull<y metal apparatus geared with a plethora of moving parts.James Whitney had constructed this machine with his brother John, and he would use it to make a single film - lcpis. This large, complex machine with all its gears and selsyn motors, situated at the heart of his studio space, is the pivot around which this story turns; it was a mechanical analogue computel.  

[...] Analogue computation implies a representation in which an abstract physical quantity - electric current, light flux - is signified by a concrete physical quantity; for example, length or shape. In this representational practice, an inherent resemblance to the world is maintained. By contrast, digital computing is based upon a rigorous quantization in a practice of unit operations. At the beginning of World War ll, a substantial amount of money was spent creating mechanical analogue computers - machines that made their calculations using selsyn gears and wheels and cams. Then, in 1943, the military abruptly replaced these machines with electronic analogue computers. Extraordinarily expensive equipment was dismissed to junk yards by the ton - and John Whitney bought one. The machine he purchased was an M5 anti-aircraft gun director - a specialpurpose mechanical analogue computel developed f,or the guidance and control ol anti-aircraft weaponry.8 These mechanical computers were intricate and elegant integrated systems, each weighing in at approximately 850 pounds and comprising approximately 11,000 moving parts.s They were created to solve a particular set of equations for an unchanging number of variables. specifically, they performed the delicate task of calculating the lead necessary to fire and hit .r moving target from a particular distance.'o [...]  

The gun controller is a technology of vision that directly responds to a similar fechnology of vision. Both are specifically dedicated to augmenting, informing and enframing the soldier's ptocess of seeing - and both directly shape the actions olwhich he is capable. This is a process in which the human body is reeducated by the machine to act according to a new paradigm of visuality.  

At this early stage in the development of computers, the computer was already being developed as a technology that promotes specific habits of visuality. The gun controller trains its users to look at the world in highly specific ways, beginning with glancing - shifting focus back and forth across a visual field. As Jonathan Crary points out, 'one learns nothing new that way; it yields a world already l<nown through habit and familiarity'.r' One sees an object quickly; then focus, lock, fire. To lool< at a particular object is to target it. The machine translates the object into data - height, speed, direction - for the singular purpose of burning that object out of the world. To see is to model is to comprehend is to destroy. This would become, in subsequent years, the model for a new kind of visual experience. [. . . ]  

This model of vision can be understood more easily in dialogue with the camera obscura than the film camera-and the similarities and differences are instructive. First is a similarity of separation. The individual is held at a certain distance lrom the world - [...]the operator is enclosed in a sheath of metal and Plexiglas. Like that of the camera obscura, the viewpoint of the turret is a dream ol objectivity and transparency, remove and control. But the gun controller operator does not look at a representation of the world held on a separate wall to trace or examine. The eye looks directly on the world, through a framing device. The space of the eye - the space of looking - is shown to be particularly disciplined. Bodily reach is augmented by ballistics. Vision is enframed with lenses. Unlike the camera obscura, where the subject could be said to control or master a world by himself, the subject is himself constrained and enclosed - locked into a circuit of machines. This mode of looking dreams of efficiency and instantaneity; it is a mode appropriate to a space of visual bombardment and a world that valorizes speed.12 [... ]  

While contemporary digital computers may seem impossibly distant from these early analogue computers - distinct in size and shape, interface and use - the early computers ofler an important reference point lor understanding how contemporary computer visuality functions; lor example, the tracl<ing of the mouse, and the habits of pointing and clicking. As Crary points out, most cases, using a computer produces a psychic field of expectant attentiveness, within which one inevitably trains oneself to maximize the speed of response to specific commands and functions and in fact to derive at least some satisfaction lrom these habitual operations of mechanical lacility'.r3  

The work of the Whitneys offers us an alternative way of seeing with the computer - but one that responds to, and participates in, the paradigm of vision enacted by the gun controller. As stated earlier, the Whitney brothers both literally and metaphorically retooled the military gun controllers, thereby engaging with a technology that was simultaneously material and social. This technology irrevocably shaped their production - pointing us toward asking how particular computational technologies instantiate particular habits of vision, shaping ideas of subject and object.John Whitney tells us thatJames Whitney began with random dots. Computer processing repeated, rearranged and recombined these figures, generating plecise, strobing patterns. Beginning to watch lapis, the viewer may have an experience like that of the operator of the M5 - an experience that itself worked to develop the habits of vision that Crary attributes to users of modern computers. The eyes seem to deflocus. The viewer' deliberately relaxes the gaze to take in the whole field at once. The experience is of awaiting motion, then attempting to focus in on its particularity - an attempted targeting, as it were. Icpis begins with a glowing sheet of white, a space to project or fall into. Slowly, arrays of tiny particles edge themselves into a ring. The particles swarm and cluster, eventually flaring into complex geometric patterns. Unlike with the M5, this targeting cannot be completed. The image cannot be resolved into a stable emplacement. The viewer is presented with a representation in which there is nothing to locl< on to. [...1  

Abstract art based on permutation and seriality, as developed in the 1960s, has often been understood as a triumplrant celebration of Enlightenment-style reason. As Rosalind I(rauss points out, serial geometric abstractions were understood, at this point in time, as 'the demonstration of rationalism itself', the apex of a 'triumphant Cartesianism' that reinscribed the transcendental subject.ra  

This particular debate on abstraction was taking place only shortly after Whitney's initial films were produced - and seems particularly instructive in light of the 'triumph of reason' that the digital computer might seem to represent. Fitting the Whitneys into this debate is fairly straightforward, on one level: the Whitney films are a clear example of algorithmically generated, deterministic .rbstract art. Further, James Whitney states clearly on a number of occasions that in Lapis he wanted to depict 'mind forms'.1s Yet in spite of the seemingly inherent rationality of these films - they were, after all, systematically worked out by computer - their formal permutations do not emerge as particularly rational. Experientially, these patterns are not easily graspable; nor do they deify the human mind as the site of mathematical prowess. To move inside the systems of tlre Whitneys' work, including Permutations and lopis, is 'precisely to enter a world without a centre, a world of substitutions and transpositions nowhere legitimated by the revelations of a transcendental subject'.16 [.. . ]  

lr.r the years after Permutsfions, John Whitney maintained a belief that the capabilities of computational media would transform alt as well as the wider field of human experience. Throughor-rt his lifetime, he continued to dream of the utopian possibilities that computation carried for disrupting traditiorral modes ol representation. James Whitney was less optin-ristic. Curiously, both brothers' feelings stemn-red lrom a particular aspect of computer technology: its peculiarly dictatorial quality. The M5 was capable of establishing a unique bodily discipline. In a related lashion, lcpis produces certain undeniable physical eflects (as does Permutations). 1...1  

These ellects are not in the film per se but rather in the spectator's perceptual system - 'the electrical-cherlical functioning of [the viewer's] own neryous system'.r7 The 'flickering' of film frames can produce strong physiological and psychological elfects - including, but rrot limited to, migraine headaches, nausea, epileptic seizures, anxiety, exhilaration and euphoria. The forceful effect of tlrese films derives from their deft mixing of the purely visual, or optical, with the corporeal, a field that has been described by its phenomenological dinension as 'the haptic'. This mixing tool< on a particular resonance within the postwar culture of the televisual - as well as within an emerging culture of tl-re computational. [. . . ]  

Unlil<e the distanced reflection of the camera obscura, these new technologies provide no room for distance or judgement - or escape. Jol-ur Wl-ritney found in this the possibility of a new vision and an accompanying transf,ormation of the human subject. James lound disruption, which comes through clearly in the er-rding to l-tis fllm lapis. [...]  

ForJames, the computer provoked tlre sort of physical nausea that can stem only from the furious rejection of a bodily disturbance. Crary has written compellingly of the perceptr-ral retraining that occurred with the advent of capitalism as a dissociation of vision from the body. By contrast, the Whitneys reveal a vision wrought haptic - a reattaclrment of t[-re body that was understood to hold both revolutionary possibility as well as the danger of a totalizing cybernetic control.

lrr Mill Valley, California, in tl-re Spring of 1978 I got high on networking. I had ,rrrlit'ipated the condition some 17 years earlier in my rather wintry studio in lrrrrrlon where I was visited with a cybernetic vision of art, after reading the wor ks of Norbert Wiener and Ross Ashby, formulatirrg a prospectus lor creative work which could, as I saw it, raise consciousness to a higher level.  

My worl<, on gallery walls and in colleges ol art both in England and abroad (r",pt'ci.rlly at Ealing, London and at the Ontario College of Art IOCA], Toronto) . rt lr'rn pted to create analogues of the cybernetic vision which l had cornmitted to prrlrlir'.rtion, but one crucial element was missing. It was not simply that computer ,r( ( ('s wcls difficult to arrange, although that certainly was the case at that time, but that some link between the computer and the means of communication was (in my experience) lacking. [... ]  

More broadly, in my mind, the concept o[a global creative network, a cybernetic art matrix, was clear but not until some fifteen years after I had first digested the significance of integrative systems did I come upon the technology which could effect these transformations of culture I had so eagerly anticipated. [... I  

In 1980, thanks to an award from the National Endowment for the Arts in Washington DC and Jacqr,res Vall6e's Inlomedia Notepad computer conferencing system, I set up rny first international networking project, mailing portable terminals to a group of artists in California, New York and Wales to participate in collectively generating ideas from their own studios. One of the group, Don Burgy, chose to tal<e his terminal wherever he was visiting and log in from there. [. . . ]  

As my contribr.rtion to Bob Adrian's 'World in 24 hours'event in Ars Electronica, I had players at their terminals around the world toss coins lor the first planetary throw of the I Ching. As I recall we got close to the eighth hexagram, Pl (Holding Together/Union), but the bottom line of the lower trigram was unbroken, which translormed the reading into the third hexagram, CHUN (Difficulty at the Beginning): 'Times of growth are beset with difficulties. They resemble a first birth. But these difficulties arise from the very profusion olall that is struggling to attain form. Everything is in motion: therefore if one perseveres there is the prospect of great success.'  

Over the past three years I have been interacting through my terminal with artists in Australia, Europe and North America once or twice a week through LP. Sharp's ARTBOX. I haven't come down fron-r that high yet and frankly I don't expect to. Logging in to the network, sharing the exchange of ideas, propositions, visions and sheer gossip is exhilarating, in fact it becomes totally compelling and addictive. It was Don Burgy, in the first project, whose 26th entry confided: 'Guess I'm hooked because Ijust got up and the first thing I did (after brushing my teeth) was to log in.'  

A new user coming online even for the first time seuses a connection and a close community, almost intimacy, which is quite unlike initial face-to-face meetings. For anyone not involved in networl<ing, it is probably hard to imagine how a computer-based medium could possibly be convivial and friendly, or how indeed working at a data terminal could lead to interconnections between human beings at any real level of meaning at all. [...]  

IClomputer-mediated networks, in my view, offer the possibility of a kind of planetary conviviality and creativity which no other means of communication has been able to achieve. One reason may be that networking puts you, in a sense, out of body, linking your mind into a kind of timeless sea. lt is a mole precise condition than that oceanic feeling thatJung describes in proposing a collective rrrrcouscious, and that is because it deals witlr more than feeling - with particular itlc.rs .rnd associations. These ideas, being generated from a diversity of scattered krc.rtions, set in widely different cultural contexts and channelled of course llrrough r,ruiquely diflerent individuals, may become densely layered in meaning .rn<l inplication. Networl<ing produces an interweaving of imaginations which 1livcs to the term 'associative thinl<ing'the most amplified interpretation. [...]  

My belief in this new order of the text, actually a new order of discourse, and rrry wish to exercise and celebrate the participatory mode of dispersed authorship whith networking af,fords, led me to devise a project wholly concerned with the rrrlt'rwcaving of textual inputs from a global distribution of artists. This became tc l'lissrrrc du Texte in the exhibition ELECTM 1993 at the Mus6e d'art moderne, paris.  

l lrc tirle ofthe project alludes, ofcourse, to Roland Barthes'book le plqisir du li'.\r('; l)ut pleating (plissure) is not intended to replace pleasure (plaisir),only to .rrrrplily and enhance it. [...]The text Barthes writes about is not,telematic text' ,r'' lcxperience it, and the authorship he analyses is not the,distribr.rted .rrrllrolshiP' o[ networl<ing.

lr'lr'nr,rrit s rlocs not only generate a new order of art discour-se but denrands a new form of criticisrn and analysis. The theoly of this rnode of art will have its technical, philosophical and communications aspect bound up within a larger cybernetic framework, which Gregory Bateson has called'ecology of rnind'. This in turn will produce a reevaluation and fresh ir.rterpretation of older art forms since it can be argued that meaning has neveL in reality been created by a oneway dispatch, nor do new ideas of images originate in the solitary mind. Individual genius was the invention of an era, which chose to delimit and contain the subversive power of art within fixed, ider-rtifiable boundaries. The field of conmunications networl< analysis is especially relevant here, and the major shift of emphasis within this field of research, in recent years, points up the dialectic between the telematic model and the older paradigm of art discourse. [. .. ]  

Telematics has arisen from an ethos of cross-disciplinary science and is set within a cybernetic perspective of the world. Nunrerous writers have attempted to describe the enormous changes they see occurring in human awareness, which son-re see as a kind of planetary consciousness. Teilhard de Chardin inagined a noosphere, a thinl<ir-rg layer, enveloping the biosphere of the earth. ln The Clobol Brain ('1983), Peter Russell advanced the hypothesis of the emergence of a planetary brain which may put us onto 'tl-re threshold of a cornpletely new level of evolution, as different from consciousness as consciousness is from life and life is lrour matter'. He firrther suggests that this process will result in 'a global brain, which will result in a shift iu human ego-centred awareness to a r,rnified field of shared awareness'. [...]  

Networking is a shared activity of mirrd and a form of behaviour which is both a dance and an embrace. It brings about a convergence of ideas from scattered sources which then, amplified, plaited or stacked, diverge out into branching pathways of meaning. This darting to and fro olideas and images (let's call it creative data), colliding, emitting new combinations, absorbing each other, virtual, real, in a state of continual transformation, puts me in mind of Gary Zukav's description of the dance of sub-atomic particles'which never ends and is never the same' (DrincingWu Li Masters: An Oventiew of the New Physics, 1979).  

That, I would see as the grand aspiration of networl<ing in art, where the artworl(, the transformations of 'creative data,' are in perpetual motion, an unending process. lr.r this sense art itself becomes not a discrete set of entities, but rather a web of relationships between ideas and images in constant flux, to which no single ar-rthorship is attributable and whose meanings depend on the active participation of whoever enters the networl<. In a sense there is one wholeness, the flow of the networl< in which every idea is a part of every other idea, in which every participant reflects every other participant in tl-re whole. This grand reciprocity, this symmetry of sender and receiver, is such tl-rat a mirror image is exchanged in which sender is receiver and receiver sender. The .bserver of the 'artwork' is a par-ticipator who, in accessing the system, tr'.rnsforms it. The physicists who attempt to explain the quantum view that all P.t l'ticles exist potentially as different combinatiorrs of other particles often cite thc BLrddl-rist parallel view of the world, expressed in the metaphor of Inclra,s nct: the heaven of Indra, there is said to be a network of pearls, so arranged lh.rt ilyorl look at one you see all the others reflected in it. ln the same way c.rch object in the world is not merely itself but involves every other object and in l.rct is everytl-ring else.'[... ]

rests upon the idea that architects are first and foremost system designers who have been forced, over the last 100 years or so, to take an increasing interest in the orgarrizational (i.e. non-tangible) system properties of development, communication and control. Design problems were coped with as they cropped up, but for some time it has been evident that an underpinning and unilying theory is required. Cybernetics is a discipline that fits the bill in so far as the abstract concepts of cybernetics can be interpreted in architectural terms (and, where appropriate, identified with real architectural systems), to lorm a rheory (architectural cybetnetics, the cybernetic theory of architecture). t I  

A structure exists chiefly to perlorm certain lunctions, for example, to shelter its occupants or to provide them with services. At this level, a 'functional' building is contrasted with a 'decorative' building; it is an austere structure, stripped of excrescences. But the concept of functionalism can be r-rsefully refined in a humanistic direction. The functions, alter all, are performedfor hurnan beings or human societies. It follows that a building cannot be viewed simply in isolation. It is only meaningful as a human enviroument. lt perpetually interacts with its inhabitants, on the one hand serving them and on the other hand controlling their behaviour. ln other words, structures mal<e sense as parts of larger systems that include human components and the architect is primarily concerned with these larger systems; fhey (not just the bricl<s and mortar part) are what architects design. I shall dub this notion architectur-al 'mutualisrn', meaning mutualism between structures and men or societics.  

One consequence of lunctionalism and mutualism is a shift of err-rphasis towards the form (rather than the material constitution) of structures; materials ar.rd methods come into prominence quite late in the design process.  

Another consequence is that architects are required to design dynamic rather than sfcrtic entities. Clearly, the hunran part of the system is dyrramic. But it is equally true (thougl-r less obvious) that the structural part must be imaged as continually regulating its human inhabitants.  

Once a rudimentary version of the functional/mutualistic hypothesis has been accepted, the integrity of any single system is questionable. Most human/ structural systems rely upon other systems to which they are coupled via the human components. By hypothesis, there are organizational wholes which cannot be meaningfully dissected into parts.  

Holism is of several types:  

a) A functionally interpreted building can only be usefully considered in the context of a city (notice that the city is also fr-rnctionally interpreted and, as a result, is a dylramic entity). b) A (fr-rnctionally interpreted) structure, either a br,rilding or ar-r entire city, can only be meaningfully conceived in the context of its ten-rporal extension, i.e. its growth and developmetrt.  

c) A (functionally interpreted ) structure exists as part of an intention, i.e. as one product of aplan. d) Il (assumed dogma) man should be aware of his natural surroundings, then buildings should be wedded to or arise lrom tl-rese surroundings ([Frank Lloydl Wright's organic thesis).  

lt is a corollary ofa, b and c that the structure ofa city is notjust the carapace of society. On the contrary, its structure acts as a symbolic control programme on a par with the ritual constraints which are known to regulate the behaviour of various tribes and which render this behaviour homeostatic rather than divergent. Hence, the architect is responsible for building conventions and shaping the development of traditions (this comment simply elevates the idea that a building controls its inhabitants to a higher level of organization).  

Systems, notably cities, grow and develop and, in general evolve. Clearly, this concept is contingent upon the functionalist/mutualist lrypothesis (without which it is dilficult to see in what sense thesysfem itself doesgrow) though the dependency is often unstated. An immediate practical consequence of the evolutionary point of view is that architectural designs should have rules for evolution built into them if their growth is to be healtlry rather thar.r cancerous. [...]  

Many human activities are symbolic in character. Using visual, verbal or tactile symbols, man 'tall<s with' his surroundings. These consist in other men, iuformation systems such as libraries, computers or works of art and also, of coLlrse, the structures around him.  

Buildings have always been classified as worl<s of art. The novel sub-theory is th.rt structures may be designed (as well as intuited) to loster a productive and pleasurable dialogue. [...] Gaudi's work, especially the Parque Guell [is] at a symbolic level one of the most cybernetic strLlctures in existence. As you explore the piece, statements are made in terms of releasers, your exploration is guided by specially contrived feedbacl<, and variety (surprise value) is introduced at .rppropriate points to make you explore.  

It is interesting that Gaudi's work is olten confrcsfed with functionalism. Syslemically it is lunctionalisnr pure ar-rd simple, tl-ror-rgh it is aimed at satislying oirly lhe symbolic and informational needs of man. [...]  

ln common with the pure architecture of the 1800s, cybernetics provides a rncfalanguage lor critical discr-rssion. But the cyberrretic theory is more than an cxtension of 'pure' architecture. As we noted somewhat earlier, pure ,rrchitecture was descriptive (a taxonorny of buildings and n-rethods) and pr cscriptive (as in the preparation of plans) but it did little to predict or explain. lrr con[rast, the cybernetic theory has an appreciable predictive power. For t'x.tnrple, urban development can be modelled as self organizing system (a lor.rn.rl staternent of 'evolutionary ideas in architecture') and in these terms it is possible to predict the extent to which the growth of a city will be chaotic or ordered by differentiation. [...]  

The cybernetic theory can also claim some explanatory power in so far as it is possible to mirric certain aspects of architectural design by artiflcial intelligence computer programs (provided, incidentally, tl-rat the program is able to learn about and,from architects and by experimenting in the language ofalchitects, i.e. by exploring plans, material specifications, condensed versions of clients' conments, etc.). Such programs are [...] potential aids to design, acting as intelligent extensions of the tool-lil(e programs mentioned at the outset. Further, they oller a means lor integrating the constructional system (the 'rnachinery of production') with the ongoing design process, since it is quite easy to embody the constraints of current technology in a special part of the simulation. However, I believe these programs are of far greater importance as evider.rcir.rg out theoretical knowledge of what architecture is about. In so far as the program can be written, the cybernetic theory is explanatory.  

It seems lil<ely that rapid advances will be made in at least five areas guided   
by the cybernetic theory of architecture. 1. Various computer-assisted (or even computer-directed) design procedures   
will be developed into useful instruments. 2. Concepts in very different disciplines (notably social anthropology, psycho  
logy, sociology, ecology and econonics) will be unifled with the concepts of   
architecture to yield an adequately broad view of suclr entities as 'civilization',   
'city' or'educational system'. 3. There will be a proper and systematic formulation of the sense in which   
architecture acts as a social control (i.e. the germ of an idea, mentioned as   
'holism', will be elaborated). 4. The high point of lunctionalism is tlre cor-rcept of a house as a 'machine for   
living in'. But the bias is towards a r.nachine that acts as a tool serving tl.re   
inhabitant. This notion will, Ibelieve, be refined into the concept of an   
environment wifh which tlre inhabitant cooperates and in which he can   
externalize his mental processes, i.e. mutr.ralism will be emphasized as compared   
with mere fr-rr-rctionalism. [... ] 5. Gaudi (intentionally or not) achieved a dialogue between his environment   
and its inhabitants. [...]The dialogue can be refined and extended [...lin terms   
ol a reactive environment. lf, in addition, the environnent is malleable and   
adaptive the results can be very potent indeed. [...] ln the absence of a human inhabitant, feedback leads to stabilization with   
respect to certain pre-programmed invariants [...]lf there is a human being in  

the environnent, the computel, nraterial and all, engages him in dialogue, and within quite wide limits is able to learn about and adapt to his behaviour pattern.  

Tlrere is thus one sense in which the reactive environment is a controller and another in which it is controlled by its inhabitants.  

ln the context o[ a reactive and adaptive environment, architectural design takes place in several interdependent stages. 1. Specification of the purpose or goal of the system (with respect to the human inhabitants). lt should be emphasized that the goal may be and nearly always willbe underspecified [...] [The] aim is to provide a set of constraints that allow lor certain, presurrably desirable, modes of evolution. 2. Choice of the basic environmental materials. 3. Selection of the invariants which are to be programmed into the system. [...] 4. Specification of what the environment will leant about and how it will adapt. 5. Choice of a plan for adaptation and development. [n case the goal of the system is underspecified (as in 1) the plan wilt chiefly consist in a rrumber of evolutiorrary principles. [... ]  

Urban planning usually extends over time periods ofyears or decades and, as currently conceived, the plan is quite an inflexible specificatior.r. However, the .rrgument just presented suggests that it need not be inflexible and that urban clevelopment cor.rld, perhaps with advantage, be governed by a process lil<e that in the dialogue of a reactive environment (physical contact with the inhabitants giving place to an awareness of their preferences and predilections; the inflexible plar.r to the environmental computing machine). If so, the same design paradigrrr .rpplies, since in all of the cases so lar considered tlre primary decisions are systemic in character, i.e. they to the delineation or the modification of a control l)rogran. This universality is typical of the cybernetic approaclr.  

One final manoeuvre will indicate the flavour of a cybernetic theory. Let us t rrln [he design paradigm in upon itself; let us apply it to the interaction between lhe clesigner and the system he designs, r-ather than the interaction between the svstem ar.rd the people who inhabit it. The glove fits, almost perfectly in the case when the designer uses a computer as his assistant. ln other words, the relation entity' is preserved when these ornnibus words are r t'pl.rced either by'designer/system being designed'or by'systemic environment/ r rr h.r bi[ants' or by 'urban plan/city'. But notice the trick: the designer is con trolling tlr('cor.lstl'uction of contlol systems, and consequently design is control o/ r ontlol, i.e. the designer does much the same job as his system, buf he operates ,rl .r higher level in the organizational hierarchy.  

l:r.rr-ther, the design goal is nearly always underspecified and tl-re 'controller' is rrrr longer the authoritarian apparatus which this purely technical name r rrnrnror.rly brings to mind. ln contrast the controller is an odd nixture of catalyst, r rrrtt'h, rremory and arbiter. These, I believe, are the dispositions a designer ',lrorrl<l bring to bear upon his work (when he professionally plays the part of a controller) and these are the qualities he should embed in the systems (control systems) which he designs.

[...] Sometime in 1960Joan Littlewood [a veteran of the English radical theatre scenel met and became friends with Cedric Price [...] a young architect on the London scene. [...]  

Price's ideas for a technologically innovative, 'non-deterministic'architecture of planned obsolescence couched in terms of Littlewood's conceptions for alternative theatrical practice produced the quintessential anti-architectural project, the Fun Palace. Littlewood's aesthetic was characterized by an emphasis on direct communication between audience and performer. Ilt] stressed physical form over speech [...1, employed interactive techniques [...], and adapted environmental forms such as festivals with the aim of engaging the sensory and physical participation of the audience in the action. [...] Littlewood's tlreatrical expertise and social mission were well met by Price's wit and architectural objective: to produce an architecture that could accommodate change. [...1  

In 1963 [...] Gordon Pask [...] formed the Committee for the Fun Palace Cybernetic Theatre, which added a new twist to Littlewood's idea of direct communication. with the expertise of an unusual interdisciplinary committee Iincluding Roy Ascott, who proposed an electronic PiIIsr of Information] now in place, the goals olthe project were refocused: [...] the technological mandate moved beyond the realm of mechanical mobility into the more ephemeral mobiliry offered by new informatiotl media and mass communications. The discrete disciplinary interests of the three protagonists - cybernetics, transient architecture, participatory theatre and communications - merged in the objectives of the Fun Palace project: to facilitate the emergence of an ephemeral subjectivity through the theatricality of communication. [...]  

Although the Fun Palace was never realized, Price achieved such notoriety [...] as to secure lor himself a seminal role within debates about architecture and technology. For cutting-edge technological visionaries such as Archigram, Price was the man to watch [...]. The production of the social and the individuat - both physically and virtually in real-time - is the theoretical crux o[ the Fun Palace. [.. . I The conflict between the simultaneous time of information and the disciplinary time of work (of schedules, timetables, industrial production) had to be amended for humans, to allow them to adapt to the flux and flow of the future technological world. [... I  

To facilitate learning and help people live in a scientific culture, the Fun palace would be equipped with calculating apparatuses (such as cooperative machines operated by two or three people or individual teaching machines) with the idea that these would assist people to learn cooperative behaviour and develop speed in observation and deduction. There would be closed-circuit TVs and surveillance systems by which participants could 'experience the emotional thrill and power' of watching themselves participate Iin] a cybernetic learning machine.

# Usmcn Hcrque The Architectural Relevcrnce of Gordon Pcsk//2OO7  

Gordon Pask (1928-96), English scientist, designer, researcher, academic, playwright, was one of the early proponents and practitioners oIcybernetics, the study of control and communication in goal-driven systems of animals and machines. Originally trained as a mining engineer, he went on to complete his doctorate in psychology. His particular contribution was a formulation of secondorder cybernetics as a framework that accounts for observers, conversations and participants in cybernetic systems.  

Pask was one ofthe exhibitors at the'Cybernetic Serendipity'show staged at the ICA, London, in 1968, cuiated byJasia Reichardt, an exhibition that became the inspiration for many future interaction designers. The interaction loops of cybernetic systems, such as Pasl<'s Colloqu y of Mobiles (1968), where actions lead to impacts on the environment that lead to sensing and further modification of actions, are core to the notion of a Paskian environment. He is also known for his Conversation Theory, a particularly coherent and potentially the most productive theory of interaction encompassing human-to-human, human-to-machine and machine-to-machine configulations in a common franework' ["']  

The extent ol Pasl<'s research, theories and artefact design/construction was enormous. As such, clifferent groLlps of people find completely different tracts from his bacl< catalogue relevant to their own wofl(. In the 1960s, he worked with the architect Cedric Price on his Fun Palace project as resident cyben.retician' introducing the concept of underspecified goals to architecture systems. In lhe .lg70s, Pasl<'s contribution to tlre philosophy of MIT's Architecture Machine Group was focused around the notion of architecture as an enabler of collaboration. And in the 1980s and early 1990s, architects such as John Frazer at the Architectural Association were pal ticularly interested in how Pasl<'s adaptive systems might be applied to tlre architectural design plocess in order to evolve building lorms and behaviours.  

Now, at the beginning of the 21 st century, Pask's Conversation Theory seems particularlyimportantbecauseitsuggestshow,nthegrowingfieldofubiquitous computing,humans,devicesand theirshared environmentsmight coexist ina mutually constructiverelationship.Ifwe thinkof havingconversationswith our environmentsinwhichweeachhavetolearnfromeachother,thenPask'searly experiments with mechanical ancl electrochemical systems provide a conceptual frameworl< for building interactive artefacts that deal with the natulal dynamic complexity that environments must have withor-rt becorning prescriptive, lestrictive and atltocratic.  

h.r this context, his teaclring and conversational rnacl.rines demonstrate authentically interactive systems that develop unique interaction profiles each humanparticipant.Thisapproach contrasts sharply with theStarTrek Holodekapproachoften attempted inso-called intelligentenvironments,which presumes that we all see all things in the same way and which deniesthe creative-productiveroleoftheparticipantininteractionswithsuchenvironments. pasl< recognizecl, for example, that interpretation and context are necessaly elements in language - as opposed to locating meaning itself in language - which is particularly important to consider for any design process' not least the construction of archi tectural experience.  

His theories on underspecified and observer-constructed goals have been a majorinfluence onmy own work.[...|TheongoingprojectsPaskianEnvironments (with Paul Pangaro.another former student and collaborator of Pask)and EvolvingSonicEnvironment(withRobertDavis,Goldsmiths,Universityof London) aim to provideconcrete and pragmatic strategies for implementing Pasks theories in an architectural context. [...]  

Four of Pask's projects in particular give hints abor.rt how to create richer, more engaging and stimulating intetactive envit'onments. lt is wortlr bearirrg in mincl that each of these pt-edates the common digital computer and was therelore t onstructed mainly usirrg analoglre components. The descriptions below have lrt'crr sirlplified, which is somewhat counter to the spirit of a Pasl<ian approach often necessarily conrplex - but it is hoped they will provoke the readel to lolkrw ugr with Pask's own writings, which cover both the theories and the results ol tlre projects he actually constructed.  

'l'he MusfColour Machine, constructed in was a performance systenr of t oloured lights thaf illuminated in concert with audio input from a human pt'r'lolmer (who migltt be using a traditional urusical instrun-rent). [...]  

lhe sequence of light outputs might depend at any one moment on the Irt'clrrencies and rhythms that it can hear, but if the input becomes too continuous lirr instance, the rhythm is too static or the frequency range too consistent - A.4rrsiColour will become bored alrd start to listen for other frequency ranges or rlrylhnrs, lighting only when it encounters those. Tlris is not a direct translation: rl listcns for certain frequencies, responds and theu gets bored and listens ,,lst,where, produces as well as stimulates improvisation, and reassenbles its l,rrrlirr.rge much like a jazz mnsician might in conversation with other band rrr,rrrbers. Musicians who worked with it irr the 1950s treated it very much lil<e ,rr rol lrcr. onstage participant.  

lhc innovation in tl-ris project is that data (the light-output pattern) is I,rovol<ccl arrd produced by the participants (other rnusicians) and nothing exists rrrrtrl orre of therr enters into a conversation with the designed altefact. ln this p.rrlrt ip.rr.rt-focused constructional approach, the data evol<ed has no limits.  

l',rsl< constructed a systerr that aspires to provide enouglr variety to keep a t','r',rrrr in[et'ested and engaged witlrout becoming so random that its output rl,l){',us rronsensical. How these crite[ia (novelly vs boredom) are measured is i , ,r ,' l( ) t l)c system. This calculation is constantly being r-elormulated on the basis $111$ lroW the person responds to the l'esponse. Unlike the efficiency-oriented t , r u ,'r n olttirrization approach taken by many responsive euvironmental \',rr'rr\, .rn architecture br.rilt on Pasl<'s system would contir.rually encourage rr',r, lty,rrrcl ltrovoke conversational relationships with human palticipants.  

tlrl St'll-Adaptive l(eyboard Instl'uctor (SAI(I), designed by Pask and Robin ,'l, l,rrron Wood in 1956, was essentially a system for teaching people how to ,r, r( ,r',('s;lccd .rnd accuracy in typing alphabetic and numeric symbols trsing a t'I,ylir'ylto.rr-d.

The result is that, while presentation of test items starts or-rt at the same rate for each item with timely cue information, gradually, as the student imp|oves, the pace is increased and cues are withdrawn for particular items. If a student has difficulty with any individual item - manifested either by mal<ing a mistal<e or by fesponding slowly - the pace is decreased for that item alone and cue information is selectively reintroduced. [...]  

The stLrdent responds to the machine just as the machine is responding to the student, and the natute of theirgoals at arry point in time is dependent on the particular history of response the other has provided. [...]  

SAI(I provides a praguratic strategy for constructing algorithms that have mr.rltiple dynamic environmental inptrts and outputs, yet one that is still able to accoLlnt lor an explicitly human contribr,rtion. lt provides a rnodel of interaction where an individual can directly adjust the way that a machine responds to him or her so that they can converge on a mutually agreeable nature of feedback: an architecture that learns from the inhabitant just as the inhabitant learns from the architecture.  

Chemical computers are assemblages consttucted electrochemically, that are able to compute an electrical output on the basis of electrical input. ln 1958 Pasl< was particLllarly interested in how these could be used to construct analogue systems that emulated biological neutal networl<s in their lacl< of specificity: they evolved behaviours over time depending on how they were trained. Such systems can modify their systemic interconnections as they grow in order to improve proficiency at calculation or pattern recognition. tn effect, Pask discovered that they can grow their own sensors. [. . . ]  

The fascinatir.rg innovation Pask made was to reward the system with an influx of free metal ions - whicl-r enable growth of the threads - when certain output criteria were met (as measured at the electrode). The arrangement was so delicate that it was aflected by all sorts of inputs including, but not limited to, physical vibration. Thor-rgh several methods were employed, one in particttlar is interesting for its potential architectural application as an adaptive environment sensing system. A buzzer was sollnded. At the moment of sor'rnding, if the frequency of the br-rzzer appeared at the sensor electrode, then the systeln was rewarded with its metal ions. Particular arlangements of thread did occasionally detect the buzzer and replicate the electrical frequency at the sensor electrode.  

As a result of the reward system - the provision of metal ions - these types of networl(s were allowed to survive and prosper while those that did not respond to tl.re buzzer were starved of ions and tended to die olf. ln other words, by measuring the output criteria (the generated waveform) and rewarding the system when these output criteria correlated with specific input criteria (the buzzer sound), the system became better at recognizing the buzzer. The systetll w.rs llrt'r.clore able to evolve its own sound sensor, which would not have been I ro,,,, ilrlt' il all cornponents of the system had been well specified at the start of the lxpr'rirneuI because designing and building such chemical structures would have lrr'r'rr ;lrohibitively complex. The under-specification of the threads meant that a rrrrrt lr bctter sound sensor could be evolved and constructed. More importantly t lrr rrrilr, by changing the input criteria, say by using electromagnetic fields rather tlr,rrr vibratiorl, the system could dynamically grow a uew type of sensor.  

I lrt' reasoning behind Pask's interest in underspecified goals is that if a rlr",irirrcr specifies all parts of a design and hence all belraviours that the rorrslilucnt parts can conceivably have at the beginning, then the eventual rrlrrrIity and functiolring of that design will be limited by what the designer can lrrr'tlitt. lt is therefore closed to novelty and can only respond to preconceptions rlr,rl wcre explicitly or implicitly built into it. Il, on the other hand, a designed , orrstr.lcI can clroose what it senses, either by having ill-defined sensors or by ,lyrr,rrnically determining its own perceptual categories, then it lnoves a step r lrr',t'l [o true autonomy which would be required in an authentically interactive ,v',1('nr. ln an environmental sense, the human component o[ interaction then lrlr onres crucial because a person involved in deterrnining input/output criteria r', prorluctively engagirrg in conversations with his or her environment.  

lrr c[ect, if sr-rclr an embodiment has underspecifiecl goals, it enables us to , rrll,rlror'.rt€ and converge on shared goals. We are able to affect both the , rrrlrrrtlintent's response and the way the response is computed.  

I Iris is a completely different notion of interaction fron-r that used in many of trrrl,ry's so-called interactive systems, which are premised on unproductive and l)r(",1)('(.ified circular, deterministic reactions. In these systems, the machine , ,,rl,rns a fir.rite amount of infor-mation and the human simply navigates through rrr ,'rrrt'r'ging landscape to uncover it all. I do something, the device/object/ , rrvrronnrenI does something bacl< to me; I do something else, the environment ,1,,' , else back to me.

There is little of the conversation that r trrlV ir)tcractive environmerrt should have, especially in the sense that nothing r.\/, 1 (,ur enierge because all possible responses are already programmed. [...]  

l', r''li w.rs lnol e interested in creating evolving and variable interactions whose rrrrr lol.rl is conversational in a valid sense. It is not about concealing and then ' r , ,rlrrrll, bLrt rather about creating information, just as Wikipedia enables in the ' rrrrlr'\t ol the Web. [n an architectural context, this approach enables us to , i,rv, ri(',.rgr.ee on arrd thereby share each others'conceptual models of a space rrr,l wlr,rl .r(l.rptations we decide it requires. With this shared conception we are 1,, rrlr .rlrlt'toactuponthegivensolaspaceinconjr-rnctionwithanaltefact,and $r\left[\sigma,\sigma,\nu\right]$ r r ,r cons[ructive, engaging and ultimately satisfying fflanner. Sr-rch a systen.t has to operate with underspecifled sensors - either a whole collection of them, each individual sensor of which may or may not eventLlally be determined as useful in calculating its output and therefore rewarded by the system - or better yet, it may evolve its own sensors, through dynarnically determined input criteria.  

In lris Colloquy of Mobiles project ( 1968 ), a physically constructed embodiment of Conversation Theory, Pask suspended a collection of purpose-built mechanical artefacts able to move and rotate, some directing beams of light ('females') and others using a combination of servos Ifeedback-controlled correcting mechanismsl and mirrors to reflect light ('males').  

Movement was initially random until a light beam from a female was caught by a male and reflected back to the lemale's light sensor. At this point, movement would cease and the light beams were locked in place as the males started oscillating their mirrors. After a period of time, the mobiles would start moving again, searching for new equilibrium arrangements.  

tf left alone, the males and females would continue an elaborate and complex choreography of conversations through the medium of light - one whiclr it was not necessary or even possible to pre-programme - finding coherence every now and then as a light beam was shared between partner members of a conversation. The most interesting point came when visitors entered the scene. Some blocked pathways of light while others used handheld torches to synchronize the devices. The males and females were not able to distingr-rish between light created by a visitor and light reflected from a female - and had no need to. They were still able to find coherence within their own terms of reference.  

Colloquy reminds us that environmental sensor/actuator systems (light beams in this case) will respond to their environment solely on their own terms. [...]  

This makes sense for sornething as easy to learn and understand as a thermostat, in which there is a finite range of input conditions and a finite range of output conditions and the system attempts to map from inputs to outputs in a linear-causal way. However, it becomes problematlc in complex environmental systems [... I  

Such environmental systems must contain methods for ensuring that proposed outcomes of the system are actually acceptable to the human. The significant cornplexity and dimensions of the system must be able to improve outcomes without confounding a person with too many inappropriate or incomprehensible outcomes. Moreover, he or she must have a way to reject inappropriateness and reward those criteria that are useful. A person must be able to construct a modeI of action collaboratively with the environment.  

This makes it clear that we need to be able to make coherent connections with our environmental systems. Rather than simply doing exactly what we tell them [... ] or alternatively the systerns telling us exactly wl-rat they think we need (which relies on the environment interpreting our desires, leading to the usual Irrrnr.rrr-machine ilequality), a Pasl<ian system would provide us with a method lirr conparing our conception of spatial conditions with the designed machine's t onception olthe space.  

It is vital at this stage in the development of interactive and time-based rrrccli.r to reconsider Pask's model of interaction, particularly because we are no lorrger-naive in dealing with our technological interfaces. We now expect more Ironr them and are better able to comprehend the structures behind them. A I'.rsl<ian approach to architecture does not necessarily require complexity of nrtcr.action - it relies on the creativity of the person and the machine negotiating ,r( ross an interface, technological or otherwise. [...]  

Architectural systems constructed with Paskian strategies allow us to r lr.rllenge the traditional architectural model of production and consumption llr.rt places firm distinctions between designer, builder, client, owner and mere rrt t upant. Instead we can consider architectural systems in which the occupant l,rkc.s a prime role in configuring and evolving the space he or she inhabits, a l)ol ton-up approach that enables a more productive relationship with our r'nvironments and each other. Pask's approach, if implemented, would provide a rrrrcial counterpoint to the current pervasive computing approach that is llrrncled on interaction loops that have been fixed by the designer and, if rr rr plc rrented, would have a positive impact on the design of futute environments.  

'l his interpretation of Pask's way ol thinking about interactive systems does rr)l necessarily result in technological solutions. lt is not about designing ,rlslhetic representations of environmental data, or improving online efficiency ,rr nr.rl<ing urban structures more spectacular.

# Willicm J. Mitchell Intelligent Cities//2007  

It's impossible to predict the futures of cities, and certainly unwise to try. For one thing, there are too many uncertainties and random contingencies. For another, there's an indeterminacy effect; interventions concerning the futures of cities - predictions, prophecies, warnings, jeremiads, utopian proposals, science fictions in the style of Minority Reporr [Spielberg,20O2l and the like - themselves have the potential to change thinl<ing and therefore the very futures they address. But designers and planners can usefully suggest possible futures, and demonstrate ways to achieve them. This engages the imagination, provides a concrete basis for debate about what might be desirable and achievable, and establishes some starting points f,or constructive action. In this lecture, then, I will sketch one possible, particularly interesti ng urban future - that of infel ligent cities.  

# Evolution of urban intelligence  

To put the idea of intelligent cities in perspective, it is useful to go bacl< to the beginning ofa long evolutionary process. The physical fabric ofthe earliest cities, long before the industrial revolution, consisted esserrtially of skeleton and skin - columns, beams, walls, floors, and roofs. Its functions were to provide shelter and protection, and to intensify land use. The inhabitants, sometimes assisted by animals, provided their own mobility, performed social and econotlic transactions face-to-face, and supplied the coordinating intelligence needed to make the city function as a system. This began to establish a cyborg condition; spatially extended layers of artificial skin augmented the protection oflered by living human skin. Then, with industrialization, cities started to acquire, as well, increasingly extensive artificial physiologies. Now there were water supply and liquid waste removal networks, energy supply networks, transportation networl<s, and heating and air-conditioning networl<s buildings. Food processing and supply uetworks extended human alimentary canals at one end, while sewers extended them at the other. Inhabiting a city meant being continually plugged into these networks, arrd dependent upon tl.rem for your survival. Cities extended the capabilities of human bodies in mote comprehensive and sophisticated ways, and took over more of the functions traditionally performed by the unaided human body, so the cyborg condition intensified.  

Finally, in the latter half of the nineteenth century, cities began to add artificial nervous systems to their fabrics of skeleton, sl<in, and suppty, processing and removal networks. This process began with the construction of telegraph,  

It,le phone and radio communication systems, picked r-rp momentum through the lilst halfofthe twentieth century, and then accelerated in extraordinary fashion .rl'tcl the introduction of digital telecommunications in the late i960s - eventually prrrclucir-rg today's pervasive connectivity through the internet and mobile wileless networl<s. The pioneering media theorist Marshall McLuhan presciently lr.riled these new networks as extensions of human nervous systems.  

At the dawn of the twenty-first century, then, cities possessed all of the t rtrcial subsystems of living organisms: structulal sl<eletons; input, processing ,rrrcl waste removal networks for air, water, energy and other essentials; and rnrrlliple layers of pl-otective skin. Even more importantly, the existence of ,rltificial nervous systems was enabling cities to sense changes in their ir.rternal ,rncl external environments and respond, lil<e organisms, in intelligently r oorclinated fashion. In my 2003 book $\bar{M}e{++}$ : The Cyborg SeIf and tlrc Netyvorked, ( i/.y, I discussed this development in detail.  

# l:lcments of digital urban intelligence  

I he elements of ar-tificial urban intelligence did not appear all at once. Instead, tlrt'r-e has been a complex and messy process of technological emergence and irrtcgration into larger systems - much as, in biological evolution, existing \lluctures and unexpected rntrtations are appropriated for new pul'poses within crncrging functional organizations. (This sort of process is sometimes called tt't hnological convergence, but this terminology suggests something far less messy ,rrrrl .rd hoc than what actually goes on.) First came development of the theory of (ligit.rl information by Claude Shannon, followed in the 1960s by tlre invention of lr.rtkct switching, the Alpanet, Ethernet, the lnternet and the World Wide Web. t ,nrbined with ongoing rapid expansion of wired and wireless communication r lr.rnnels - including very fast fibre optic cable connections - this put in place the r r('( ('ssary nerve pathways at building, city, national and ultimately global scales.  

Ncxt, during the'1970s and 1980s, came the increasingly profound effects of tlrt' semicor-rductor revolution. Computers, which had hitherto been large, r h'lit r te, expensive and confined to a few specialized and privileged sites became rrrrrth srraller, much less expensive and mr-rch more robust. By the mid 1980s, tlris rlcvelopment had made desktop personal computers part of everyday life, ,rrrrl these were soon linl<ed into the growing digital networks. With further rrrrrri.rturization and improvements in performance of semiconductor devices ,.rrrrt'l.r1ttop computers, mobile phones, Blackberries and iPods. Less visibly, but rrr,rylrt'even mor-e importantly in the long run, tiny, embedded microprocessors I r.r ,unc crucial components of devices and systems ranging from automobiles to ,lrriit.rl cameras. Digital intelligence was no longer tightly concentrated, but was r row trbiquitously present throughout urban environments.  

During the dotcom bubble of the late 1990s, it seemed to many that the digital era was all about internet connectivity, personal computers and websites. There was much excited discussion (partiatly but not entirely grounded in reality) of the alleged death of distance, the dematerialization ofjust about everything, and the emergence of new business opportunities. Meanwhile, though, a third wave of technological innovation - that of digital sensors and tags - was making its presence felt. Minuscule, digital cameras and microphones gave the internet eyes and ears everywhere. GPS and other location technologies made devices such as automobiles and mobile phones continuously aware of where they were. RFID tags err-rbedded in products and pacl<aging began to revolutionize logistics and retailing. All this had the effect of weaving a very tight web of connections between the now-global artificial nervous system and the physical world. The artificial nervous system developed the capacity to perceive and quickly respond to conditions and events in the physical wortd, while digital processes had increasingly immediate and significant consequences in the physical world. Old metaPhors of a distinct 'cyberspace' and transcendent 'virtual worlds' - though still flavoured in the popular press, and by some cultural theorists - began to seem quaintly outmoded.  

Finally, we have now seen the development of large-scale software that ties all these pieces together to function as intelligently coordinated, geographically distributed systems. The most vivid example of this, of course, is the immense and highly sophisticated software apparatus of Google, which now structures daily intellectual life throughout the world. But there are many more. Today's global financial markets wor-rld be impossible without an immense and very sophisticated software infrastructure. Businesses, from financial product manufacturers to airlines, depend upon their enterplise software. Retailers like Amazon.com could not operate at all without the software that manages transactions, keeps track of consumer preferences and handles back-office lunctions. MySpace and YouTube enable and sustain social and cultural connections through the operation of software. [...] we are also seeing the emergence, in the software world, of cognitive hierarchies similar to those exhibited in the operations of human minds. At the lowest level is software, usually operating on local processors, that provides straightforward, reflex-like capabilities. For example, a sensor-equipped microprocessor in a machine mlght detect overheating and switch it off. This outage might be noted by central plant management software, which then adjusts the flow of a process accordingly. And this higher-level response, in turn, might be noted and responded to by the still more centralized software for global enterprise management. Such large-scale software systems are now crucial and inescapable in daily urban life. Their economic, social and cultural ellects are undeniable, and are increasingly the focus of important social science resealch. Mostly, I'd be prepared to argue, tlrey have enhanced human life. But they do deserve much closer critical scrutiny - and sometimes resistance - than they have customarily received. They have become very significant expressions of ideology, mediators of consciousness and instruments of power. The new intelligence of cities, then, resides in the increasingly effective combination of digital telecommunication networl<s (the nerves), ubiquitously embedded intelligence (the brains), sensors and tags (the sensory organs), and software (the l<nowledge and cognitive competence). This does not exist in isolation from other urban systems, or connected to them only through human intermediaries. There is a growing web of dir-ect connections to the mechanical and electrical systems of buildings, household appliances, production machinery, process plants, transportation systems, electrical grids and other energy supply networks, water supply and waste removal networl(s, systems that provide life safety and security, and management systems for just about every imaginable human activity. Furthermore, the cross-connections among these systems - both horizontal and vertical - are growing. And we are just at the beginning. [...]

# Michqel Weinstock Morphogenesis ctnd the Mathematics of Emergence/ /2OO4  

Er.nergence is a concept that appears in the literature of many disciplines, and is strongly correlated to evolutionary biology, artificial intelligence, complexity theory, cybernetics and general systems theory. lt is a word that is increasingly conrron in architectural discourse, where too often it is used to conjure complexity but without the attendant concepts and mathematical instruments ol science. In the simplest commonly used definition, emergence is said to be the pro;rerties of a system that cannot be deduced from its components, something nrore than its parts. [...] In the sciences, the term refers to the production of lolnrs and behaviour by natural systems that have an ilreducible complexity, and ,rlso to the mathematical approach necessary to model such processes in t onrpu[ational environments.  

'l-he task for architecture is to delineate a working concept of emergence and to outline the mathematics and processes that can mal<e it useful to us as designers. This means we mus[ search for the principles and dynamics of organization and interaction, for the mathematical laws that natural systems obey, and that can be utilized by artificially constructed systems. We should start by asking: What is it that emerges, what does it emerge from, and how is emergence produced? [... ]  

It is evident that there is a pressing need for a more developed mathematical approach in current architecture. First, the [iberation of tectonics from the economic straitjacket of orthogonal geometry demands more precision in the interface between architectural definitions of form and the computer-driven fabrication processes ol manufacturing constructors. Second, the engineeling design for the complex geornetries of contemporary tectonics must begin from a definitive mathematical base. And third, there is a lacuna in the theoretical body of architectur-e, an absence that is marked by the proliferation of design processes that borrow the appearance of scientific methods yet lack their clarity of pttrpose, mathematical instruments and theoretical integrity. [...1  

# Process and Form  

Living organisms can be regarded as systems, and these systems acquire their complex lorms and patterns of bel.raviour through the interactions, in space and over tinre, ol their components. The dynamics of the development of biological forms, the accounts of growth and form, of morphogenesis, have become much more central to evolutionary theory than in Darwin's thesis. [...] Theories of morphogenesis, the creation of lorms that evolve in space and over time, are now inextricably errtwined with the rnathematics of information theory, with physics and chemistry, and with organization and geon.retry. The pattern of alignment with concepts and technologies of economics and industry remains consistent.  

The convergent lines of thought between biology and mathematics were initiated early in the twentieth century, particularly in the work of Whitehead and DArcy Thompson. DArcy Thompson, zoologist and mathematician, regarded the material forms of living things as a diagram of tl.re forces that have acted on thern. His observations of tlre honrologies between skulls, pelvises and the body plans of different species suggested a new mode of analysis, a mathematization of biology. Morphological measurements are specific to species and at times to individuals within a species, and so are various, but there are underlying relations that do not vary - the'homologies'. [...]  

Thompson's comparison of related forms within a genus proceeds by recognizing in one form a cleformation of another. Forms are related if one can be deformed into another by Cartesian tt'ansformation of coordinates. Comparative analysis reveals what is missing in any singular description of a form, no matter how precise, and that is the morphogenetic tendency between forms.  

At around the same time the mathematician and philosopher Whitehead argued that process rather than substance was the fundamental constituent of the worlcl, and that nature consists of patterns of activity interacting with each other. Organisms are bundles of relationships that maintain thernselves by adjusting their own behaviour in anticipation of changes to the patterns of activity all around them. Anticipation and response mal<e up the dynamic of life.  

The union of these two groups of ideas is very interesting - form and behaviour emerge from process. lt is process that produces, elaborates and maintains the form or structure of biological organisms [and non-biological things], and tlrat process cor.rsists of a complex series of exchanges between the organisnr and its environment. Furthermore, the organism has a capacity for maintaining its continuity and integrity by changing aspects of its behaviour. Forms are related by morphogenetic tendencies, and there is also the suggestion that some, if not all, of these characteristics are amenable to being modelled mathenatically. The ideas are particularly relevant to us, as in recent years both architecture and engineering have been preoccupied with plocesses for generating designs of forms in physicat and compr-rtational environments.  

# Pattern, Behaviour and Self-Organization  

Form and behaviour have an intricate relationship. The form of an organism affects its behaviour in the environment, and a particular behaviour will produce different results in different environments, or if performed by different forms in the same environment. Behaviour is non-linear and context specific.  

Mathematical descriptions of behaviour are found in the elaboration of Wlritehead's 'anticipatiorr and response' by Norbert Wiener, who developed the first systematic description of responsive behaviour in machines and aninrals. [...] Cybernetics organizes the mathematics of responsive behaviour into a general theory of how machines, organisms and phenomena maintain themselves over time. [t uses digital and numerical processes in which pieces of information interact and the transmission of information is optimized. Feedback is understood as a kind of'steering' device that regulates behaviour, using information from the environment to measure the actual performance against a desired or optirnal performance.  

Worl< in thermodynamics by Prigogine extended this (and the second law of thermodynamics) by setting up a rigorous and well-grounded study of pattern formation and self-organization that is still of use in the experimentaI str-rdy and theoretical analysis of biological and non-biological systems. He argued that all biological organisms and many natural non-living systems are maintained by tlre flow ofenergy through the systern. The pattern ofenergy flow is subject to many small variations, which are adjusted by 'feedback' lronr the environment to maintain equilibrium, but occasionally there is such an amplification that the system must reorganize or collapse. A new order emerges from the chaos of the system at the point of collapse. The reorganization creates a more complex structure, with a higher flow of energy through it, and is in turn more susceptible to fluctuations and subsequent collapse or reorganization. The tendency of'selforganized' systems to ever-increasing complexity, and of each reorganization to be produced at the moment of the collapse in the equilibrium of systems, extends beyond the energy relations of an organism and its environment. Evolutionary development in general emerges from dynamic systems.  

# Geometry and Morphogenesis  

Theoreticians fiercely contest the precise relationship of morphogenesis to genetic coding, but there is an argument that it is not the form of the organism that is genetically encoded but rather the process of self-generation of the form within an environment.  

Geometry has a subtle role in morphogenesis. [t is necessary to think of the geometry of a blological or computational lorm not only as the description of the fully developed form, but also as the set of boundary constraints that act as a local organizing principle for self-organization during morphogenesis. Pattern and feedbacl< are as significant in the models of morphogenesis as they are in the models of cybernetics and dynamic systems. Alan Turing put forward a hypothesis of geometrical phyllotaxis, the development ol form in plants, which offered a general theory of the morphogenesis of cylindrical lattices. These are formed locally rather than globalty, node by node, and ate further modified by growth. To mathematically model this process, it is necessary to have a global informing geometry, the cylinder, and a set oflocal rules lor lattice nodes. [...1  

An intricate choreography of geometrical constraints and geometrical processes is fundamental to self-organization in biological morphogenesis. Computational models of morphogenetic processes can be adapted for architectural research, and self-organization of material systems is evidenced in physical form-fi nding processes.  

# The Dynamics of Differentiation and Integration  

Feedback is not only important for the maintenance of form in an environment; it is also a useful concept in modelling the relationship of geometrical pattern and form during biological morphogenesis. ln pattern form models, feedback is organized in two loops: from form to pattern and from pattern to form. ln these models the unstructured formation olbiochemical pattern caLlses morphogenetic 'movements' and a consequent transformation in geometry. The change in geometry disrupts the pattern and a new pattern emerges, which initiates new rnorphogenetic movements. The process continues until the distribution o[ nrorphogens is in equilibrium with the geometry of the evolving form in the nrodel. The feedback loops, from pattern to form and from form to pattern, constrllct a mathematical model evidenced by the lrequency of the terms 'sciences o[ complexity' and 'complex adaptive systems' in the extensive literature of thermodynamics, artificial intelligence, neural networks and clynamical systems. Mathematically, too, there are commonalities in the .rpproach to computational modelling and simulations. It is axiomatic in contemporary cybernetics that systems increase in complexity, and that in n.rtural evolution systems emerge in increasing complexity, from cells to nrulticellular organisms, from humans to society and culture.  

System theory argues that the concepts and principles of organization in n.rtural systems are independent of the domain of any one particular system, .rnd contemporary research tends to concentrate on'complex adaptive systems' lh.1t are self-regulating. What is common to both is the study of organization, its structure and function. Complexity theory lormalizes the mathematical structure of the process of systems from which complexity emerges. It focuses orr tl.re effects produced by the collective behaviour of many simple r-rnits that interact with each other, such as atoms, molecules or cells. The complex is hcterogeneous, with many varied parts that have multiple connections between lhem, and the different parts behave differently, although they are not rnclependent. Complexity increases when the variety (distinction) and rlcpendency (connection) ofparts increases. The process ofincreasing variety is t ,rlled differentiation, and the process of increasing the number or the strength rrl.connections is called integration. Evolution produces differentiation and rnlcglation in many'scales'that interact with each other, from the formation ,rrrcl structure of an individual organism to species and ecosystems.  

# I he Genetics of Collective Behaviour  

I I rt' collective behaviour of semi-autonomous individual organisms is exhibited rrr tlrc social or group dynamics of many natural species. Flocl<s of birds and ,,r lrools of fish produce what appears to be an overall coherent form or array, willrout any leader or central directing intelligence. Insects such as bees and tr'rrrrites produce complex built artefacts and highly organized functional ',ptt i.rlizations without central planning or instructions. Structured behaviour lrn('rllcs from the repetition and interaction of simple rules. Mathematical rrrorlt,ls have been derived from natural phenomena, massively parallel arrays of rrrrlrviclu.rl 'agents', or'cell units'that have very simple processes in each unit, wrtlr sinrple interactions between them. Complex patterns and effects emerge from distributed dynamical models. Wolfram's extensive study of cellular automata offers a comprehensive account of their characteristics and potential. The study and simulation of co-evolution and co-adaptation is particularly effective in distributed models. [...]  

The concepts and mathematical techniques to produce collective behaviour from simple local responses have the potential radically to change architectural environmental systems. lt is evident that the current methods of producing 'smart'buildings with hybrid mechanical systems that are controlled by a remote central computer are inferior conceptually and prone to failure in operation. The self-organizing capabilities of distributed dynamic systems have produced intelligent behaviour in natural organisms and in computational simulations, and await architectural applications. [...1  

# Architecture and Emergence  

In answer to the question: What is it that emerges, what does it ernerge from, and how is emergence produced? We can say the following.  

Form and behaviour emerge from the p[ocesses of cornplex systems. Processes produce, elaborate and maintain the form of natural systems, and those processes include dynamic exchanges with the environment. There are generic patterns in the process of self genetation of forms, and in forms themselves. Geometry has both a local and a global role in the interrelated dynamics of pattern and form in self-organized morphogenesis.  

Forms maintain their continuity and integrity by changing aspects of their behaviour and by their iteration over many generations. Forms exist in varied populations, and where communication between lorms is effective, collective structured behaviour and intelligence emerges.  

The systems from which form emerges, and the systems within individual complex forms themselves, are maintained by the flow of energy and information through the system. The pattern of flow has constant variatiorrs, adjusted to maintain equilibrium by'feedback'from the environment. Natural evolution is not a single system but distributed, with multiple systems co-evolving in partial autonomy and with some interaction. An emergellt whole lorrn can be a component of a system emerging at a higher level - and what is for one process can be 'environment' for another.  

Emergence is of momentous importance to architecture, demanding substantial revisions to the way in which we produce designs. We can use the mathematical models outlined above fot generating designs, evolving forms and structures in morphogenetic processes within computational environments. Criteria for selection of the 'fittest' can be developed that correspond to architectural requirements of performance, including structural integrity and 'bLrildability'. Strategies lor design are not truly evolutionary unless they include iterations of physical (phenotypic) modelling, incorporating the self-organizing material effects of form finding and the industrial logic of production available in CNC Icomputer numerical control] and laser-cutting modelling machines.  

The logic of emergence demands that we recognize that buildings have a life span, sometimes of many decades, and that throughout that life they have to maintain complex energy and material systems. At the end of their life span they must be dissembled and the physical materials recycled. The environmental performance of buildings must also be rethought. The current hybrid mechanical systems with remote central processors limit the potential achievement of 'sffiart' bLrildings. lntelligent environmental behaviour of individual buildings and other artefacts can be much more effectively produced and maintained by the collective behaviour of distributed systems.  

We must extend this thinking beyond the response of any single individual building to its environment. Each building is part of the environment of its neighbours, and it follows that 'urban' environnrental intelligence can be achieved by the extension of data communication between the environmental systems of neighbouring buildings. Urban transport infrastructure must be organized to have similar environmental responsive systems, not only to control internal environments of stations and subways, but also to manage the response to the fluctuating discharge ofpeople onto streets and into buildings. Linking the response ol inlrastructure systems to gloups of environrnentally intelligent buildings will allow higher-level behaviour to emerge.  

We are within the horizon of a systemic change, from the design and production of individual 'signature' buildings to an ecology in which evolutiouary designs have sufficient intelligence to adapt and to communicate, and from which intelligent cities will emerge.  

An artist is not an isolated system. In order to survive he has continuously to interact with the world around him. Theoretically, there are no limits to his involvement  

# Jcrck Burnhqm Systems Aesthetics/ / 1968  

A polarity is presently developing between the finite, unique work o[ high art, i.e. painting or sculpture, and conceptions which can loosely be termed 'unobjects" these being either environments oI altelacts which resist prevailing critical analysis. This inch-rdes worl<s by some primary scr,rlptors Iminimalists] (though solre 11ay reject the charge of creating environnlents), some gallery kir.retic and luminous art, sotrre outdoot' works, happenings arrd rnixed media presentations' Looming below the surface of this dichotomy is a sense of radical evolution which seems to run counter to the waning revolution ol abstract and non-objective art' The evolution embraces a series ol absolutely logical and incremental changes, wlrolly clevoid of the levered iconoclasm wlrich accompanied the heroic period from 1907 to 1925. As yet the evolving aesthetic has no critical vocabulary so luecessary lor its defence, nor for that matter a name or explicit cause.  

ln a way this situation might be likened to the'morphological development' of a prime scientific concept - as described by Thonras l(uhn in The Structure of Scientific Revolufions (1962). l(uhn sees science at any given period dominated by a single'major paladigm'; that is, a scientific colception of the natur.rl order so pervasive and intellectually powerltrl that it dominates all ensuing scientific discovery. tnconsistent facts arising through experimentation are invariably labelled as boglts ot'trivial - until the emergence of a new and more encompassitrg general theory. Transition between major paradigms may best express the state of present art. Reasons for it lie in the nature of current technological shifts'  

The economistJ.l(. Galbraith has rightly insisted that until recently the needs o[ the modern industrial state were never served by complete expression of the aesthetic impulse. Power and expansion were its primary aims'  

Special atteution should be paid to Galbraith's observation. As an arbiter ol irnpending socio-technical changes his position is pivotal. For tlre T.elt he reptesents America's most articulate apologist for Monopo[y Capitalism; for the Right he is the sociali st eminence grise of the Democratic Party. ln The New Industrial Sfafe (1967) he challenges both Marxist orthodoxies and American nrythologies plerrised tpon laissez-faire capitalism. For them he substitutes an incipient technocracy shaped by the evolving technostructure. Such a drilt away frorr ideology has been anticipated lor at least fifty years. Already in Calilornia thinktanks and in the central planning committees of each soviet, fr'tturologists are concentrating on the role ol the technocracy, i.e. its decisiorl-making autonomy, how it handles the central storage of inforrnation, and the techniques rr,,rrrlrly rrrrlllt'ntcnting social cl.range.

,' I I' r, ,, n ,rlirltr,ssivt'electronic media and two hundred years of industrial vandalism, the long held idea that a tiny output of art objects could somehow'beautify' or even significantly modify the environment was naive. A parallel illusion existed in that artistic influence prevails by a psychic osmosis given off by such objects. Accordingly lip service to public beauty remains the province of well-guarded museums. Through the early stages of industrialisrn it remained possible for decorative media, including painting and sculpture, to embody the aesthetic impulse; but as technology progresses this impulse must identify itself with the means of research and production. Obviously nothing could be less true for the present situation. In a society thus estranged only the didactic iunction ofart continues to have meaning. The artist operates as a quasi political provocateur, though in no concrete Sense is he an ideologist or a moralist. 'L'art pour I'art' and a century's resistance to the vulgarities of moral uplift have ensured that.  

The specific function of modern didsctic art has been to show that art does not reside in materisl entities, but in relations betvveen people and beNveen people and the components of their environment,l...l  

In an advanced technologicsl culture the most important srtist best succeeds by Iiquidating his position qs srtistvis-o-vis sociefy. Artistic nihilism established itself through this condition. At the outset the artist refused to participate in idealism through craft. 'Craft-fetishism',3 [...] remains the basis of modern formalism. Instead the significant artist strives to reduce the technical and psychical distance between his artistic output and the productive means of society. Duchamp, Warhol and Robert Morris are similarly directed in this respect. Gradually this strategy transforms artistic and technological decision-making into a single activity - at least it presents that alternative in inescapable terms. Scientists and technicians are not converted into 'artists', rather the artist becomes a symptom of the schism between art and technics. Progressively the need to make ultra sensitive judgements as to the uses of technology and scientific infornration becomes'art' in the most literal sense.  

As yet, the implication that art contains survival value is nearly as suspect as attaching any moral significance to it. Though with the demise of literary content, the theory that art is a form of psychic preparedness has gained articulate supporters.  

Art, as an adaptive mechanism, is reinforcement of the ability to be aware of the disparity between behavioural pattern and the demands consequent upon the interaction with the environment. Art is rehearsal for those real situations in which it is vital for our survival to endure cognitive tension, to refuse the comforts of validation by affective congruence when such validation is inappropriate because too vital interests are at stal<e.a [.. . ]  

he systems approach goes beyond a concern with staged environments and h.rppenings; it deals in a revolutionary fashion with the larger problem of boundary (oncepts. ln systems perspective there are no contrived confines such as the theatre proscenium or picture frame. Conceptual focus rather than material limits clcfir.re the system. Thus any situation, either in or outside the context of art, may bc designed and judged as a system. [n as much as a system may contain people, itlcas, messages, atmospheric conditions, power sources, etc., a system is, to quote lhc systems biologist, Lr-rdwig von Bertalanffy, a'complex of components in interaction',s comprised of material, energy and information in various degrees of olganization. In evaluating systems the artist is a perspectivist considering goals, lloundaries, structure, input, output and related activity inside and outside the svslel.n. Where the object almost always has a fixed shape and boundaries, the t onsistency of a system may be altered in time and space, its behaviour determined lroth by external conditions and its mechanisms of control. [...]  

IF]or our time the emerging major paradigm in art is neither an ism nor a r ollcction of styles. Rather than a novel way of rearranging surfaces and spaces, it is fi-rndamentally concerned with the implementation o[the art impulse in an ,rrlv.rrrced technological society. As a culture producer, man has traditionally r l,rinred the title Homo Faber: man the maker (of tools and images). With r orrtinued advances in the industrial revolution, he assumes a new and more r r r I it .r I function. As Homo Arbiter Formae his prime role becomes that of man the tttrtliL'r of aesthetic decisions. These decisions - whether they are made concertedly ur not - control the quality of all future life on the Earth. Moreover these are v,rlrrt' jr-rdgements dictating the direction of technological endeavour. Quite lrl,rirrly such a vision extends beyond political realities of the present. This cannot r,'rrr,rir.r the case for long.

# Jack Burnhcm Recl Time Systems// 1969  

Presently it will be accepted that art is an archaic information processing system, characteristically Byzantine rather than inefficient. To emphasize this cybernetic analogy, programming the art system involves some of the same features found in human brains and in large computer systems. Its command structure is typically hierarchical.t At the basic level artists are similar to programs and subroutines. They prepare new codes and analyse data in making works of art.  

These activities are supervised by metaprograms which consist of instructions, descriptions and the organizational structures of programs. Metaprograms include art movements, significant stylistic trends, and the business, promotional and archival structures of the art world. At the highest level art contains a selfmetaprogram which, on a long-term basis, reorganizes the goals of the art impulse. The self-metaprogram operates as an undetected overseer, establishing strategies on all lower levels in terms of societal needs. Because we have no comprehensive picture of human life, these needs remain rather obscure (Zeitgeist is not sufficiently teleologic to express the anticipatory monitoring function of the self-metaprogram).  

Aesthetic values emanate from the self-metaprogram. [...] Values, though, are simply the result of long term information processing structures. This is the business of museums and art historians. The more aggressive commercial galleries have long considered controlling and creating art information vital to selling, while not forgetting that sales are art information. The survival strategy of all social organizations, including the art system, is that of transforming preferred information into values.  

ln business this is taken for granted. At the management level, information'is data that has been culled, analysed, interpreted and presented on a selective basis in a manner useful for understanding and decision making. Its function is to decrease uncertainty'.2 As indicated, every artist produces data by making art. Critics, magazines, galleries, museums, collectors and historians exist to create information out of unprocessed art data. History is uncertainty about art minimized.  

A major illusion of the art system is that art resides in specific objects. Such artefacts are the material basis for the concept of the 'work of art'. But in essence, all institutions which process art data, thus making information, are components of the work of art. Without the support system, the object ceases to have definition; but without the object, the support system can still sustain the notion ol'art. So we can see why the art experience attaches itself less and less to t.lronical or given forms but embraces every conceivable experiential mode, irrcluding living in everyday environments. Thus art, according to John McHale, bccomes'temporal immersion in a continuous contextual flow of communicated t,xperiences'.r Examine the function of information in art: communication theory st.rtes that information is obtained when a signal reduces uncertainty within a svstem. lnformation is need requited; hence information for a system has high t'ntr-opy-reducing potential (negentropy). Negentropy is the ability of information to iucrease the structure and potential energy within a system. Such information is only obtained by expending the energy of systems outside the one receiving inlormation. Thus the art system has maintained its vitality by constantly rt'.rching outside of itself for data. ln the past this has taken the form of new strbject matter, materials and techniques. But art now challenges the entire art rnfbrmation processing structure, not merely its content.  

Encoding information always involves some physical process. In high-speed processing this takes the form of digital computer'hardware'. The procedures or l)rograms for processing data are called 'software'. For all previous art, rlislinctions between software and hardware were not recognized, so that t'rrcoding took the form of other art media and materials, where some rnlbrmation was lost, and perhaps some gained. Graphic reproductions of or iL{inal works of art were a form of advertising. We now look upon them as worl<s oI art in their own right. Electronics have taught us that we often confuse roltware with its physical transducer. In other words, if we extend the meaning ol soltware to cover the entire art information processing cycle, then art books, r,rl.rlogues, interviews, reviews, advertisements, sales and contracts are all .,ottware extensions of art, and as such legitimately embody the work of art. The ,rrl object is, in effect, an information'trigger'lor mobilizing the information r yr lt. Making, promoting and buying art are real time activities. That is to say, tlrt'y happen within the day-to-day flow of normal experience. Only Art Applcciation happens in ideal, non-existential time. [...]  

In societies where existing values adequately deal with the environment, tlrt'r'c.rle no comparative values - only the existing way of life. Values are nonlxistcnt in metabolically stable societies. Hopefully such a metabolic rt'org.rnization is under way and will lead to a convergence of global information with parallel rather than linear processing. [...]  

{)bjectively, we know very little about the rules of this metabolism. But we lirrow that organic stability is predicated upon extensive communication rrr,lworl<s, including memory, feedback and automatic decision-making r,rp,rcities. The rudiments of such networks already exist, in the form of large'.r,rlt' cligital computer control systems. SAGE, the first computer-based air defence system; Project Mercury, the first real time digital support system for space flight; Telefile, the first online banking system; and SABRE, the first corr-rputerized airline reservation system, are a few of many operating real time systems which gather and process data from environments, in time to effect future events within those environments.  

Emotionally most humanists share an instinctive antipathy for these immensely complex computer systems. Their Orwellian overtones far overshadow their conceivable use as artists'tools. But practically, it is imperative that artists do understand them - both technically and philosophically. These computer systems deal with rectl time events, events which are uncontrived and happen under normal circumstances. AlI of the data processing systems I have referred to are built into and become a part of the events they monitor. Already a large part ol the metabolic inlormation used to run the military and commercial interests of the United States is real time-oriented. tt is not proposed that artists have the choice between traditional media or using the computer. What I am saying is that the real time information-processing mode is rapidly becoming the routine style of handling information. [...]  

Some recent tendencies in Hans Haacl<e's work intrigue me. One is a willingness to use all forms of organic life - from the most elementary to the most complicated. This seems a logical extension of his philosophy ol natural systems. [...] For a museum, he is planning a steady output of statistical inlormation about visitors involving a small process-control computer and a display device. Two years ago Haacl<e would have balked at using this l<ind of technology; today, working more closely with events, it becomes a necessity. As Haacke explains:  

The artist's business requires his involvement in practically everything... It wor,rld be bypassing the issue to say that the artist's business is how to worl< with this and that material or manipulate the findings of perceptr,ral psychology, and that the rest should be left to other professions ... The total scope of ir-rformation he receives day after day is ofconcern. An artist is not an isolated system. In order to survive . .. he has continuously to interact with the world around him. Theoreticalty, there are no limits to his involvement.a [...]  

Art as inlormation-processing leaves little in the way of protection for the artist. Style used to be the art system's equivalent to patent rights. And even among the conceptualists one senses a certain degree of deference and respect for each other's ideas. But if the output of artists continues to be based upon nonsequential ideas, it may be impossible to support the notion of 'ownership'. Such ownership amounts to who amplifies original data first so that it becomes information. [...] According to Ithe ecologist Ramon] Margalef, boundaries l)('tw(.cn systems in nature are usually asymmetrical. More organized systems ,rlw.rys gain information and energy from less organized systems. [...]  

l1 is a basic property of nature, from the point of view of cybernetics, that any cxchange between two systems of different information content does not result in .r partition or equalizing of the information, but incteases the difference. The svstem with more accumulated information becomes still richer for the t'xchange. Broadly speal<ing, the same principle is valid for persons and human or-g.rnizations: any exchange increases to a greater extent the information of the p.rrty already better informed.s  

I rttlc irr.ragination is needed to realize how this principle operates within the art ',vstcm. As the fame of a living artist grows, he ceases simply to make data make rl,rt.r. His subsequent output is inlormation, since it is already art history. l'l,rgi.rrism of existing information, i.e. the worl< of well-known artists, has rrrirr inral energy - unless original inlormation becomes the object of new data in .r vcry convincing way. On the other hand, famous'avant garde'artists may r,rpitalize upon the work of their lesser-known contemporaries. Being better ,,rri,rnized systems, established artists have greater access to museums and rrrt,tli.r. Tt is important, however, that they use such rnaterial while it is still data, $1.0:$ . llefore it becomes art infotrlation.  

On a personal level Margalef's cybernetic principle remains a matter of ethics ,rrrrl practicality. But its implications for the total art inforrnation system are farrr',rching. As information processing becomes more generally r-rnderstood, rrrslitutior.rs and persons - other than artists - will insist upon creating their owu ,rrt information. Specifically I am thinking about projects which demand money, pl.rnnirrg and technical support far beyond the individr:al artist's means. Artistic r'ntlc.rvour is thus brought up (or down) to the level of corporate research. [...]  

# Hqns Hcrqcke In Conversqtion with Jeqnne Siege/ /1971  

leanne Siegel You have been called a naturalist because of your extensive interest in physical elements, as well as grass, birds, ants and animals.  

Hans Hsacke [. .. ] When people see the wind stuff or the thir-rgs I have done with animals, they call me a'naturalist'. Then they get confused or feel cheated when they discover, for example, my interest in using a computer to conduct a demographic survey. This is inconsistent only for those with a naive understanding of nature - nature being the blue sl<y, the Rockies, Smokey the Bear. The difference between 'nature' and 'technology' is only that the latter is man-made. The ftrnctioning of either one can be described by the same conceptual models, and they both obviously follow the same rules of operation. It also seems that the way social organizations behave is not much different. The world does not breal< up into neat university departrnents. lt is one supersystem with myriad subsystems, each one more or less affected by all the others.  

lf you take a grand view, you can divide the world into three or four categories - the physical, biological, the social and behavioural - each oi them having interrelations with the others at one point or another. There is no hierarchy. All of them are important for the upl<eep of the total system. It could be that there are times when one of these categories intelests you more than another. So, for example, I now spend more thought on things in the social field, but simultaneously I am preparing a large water-cycle for the Guggenheim show that uses the peculiarities of the building.  

Siegel When did you first become aware of systems theory?  

tlaacke Sometime in 1965 or 66 I was introduced to the concept of systems. I reard about systems analysis, and the related fields of operational research, :ybernetics, etc. The concepts used in these fields seemed to apply to what I had reen doing, and there was a useful terminology that seemed to describe it much nore succinctly than the terminology that tand other people had been using until .hen, so I adopted it. But using a new terminology doesn't mean that the work lescribed has changed. A new term is nothing holy, so it can't serve as a union abel. On the other hand, a clear terminology can help to stimulate thinl<ing.  

iiegel Jack Burnham has had a lot to say about systems and sculpture, yours in particular. When did you first meet him?  

llaacke I metJack in 1962 when we were both isolated from people interested in what we were doing. Since then we have been in contacf and have had a very lr-uitful exchange of ideas. lt was Jack who introduced me to systems analysis.  

Sicgel What is your defi nition of a system that is also a work of art?  

lluacke A system is most generally defined as a grouping of elements subject to a ( onrmon plan and purpose. These elements or components interact so as to ,rrrive at a joint goal. To separate the elements would be to destroy the system. I hc [erm was originally used in the natural sciences for understanding the lrcir.rvionr of physically interdependent processes. lt explained phenomena of rlircctional change, recycling and equilibrium. I believe the term system should I rr' r cserved for sculptures in which a transler of energy, material or informatior.r (,( ( urs, and which do not depend on perceptual interpretation. I use the word exclusively for things that are not systems in terms of perception, but ,rrt'physical, biological, or social entities which, I believe, are more real than 1 rl r t t,lttual titillation. [... ]  

A vely important dilference between the wor[< of Minimal sculptors and my work is that they were interested in inertness, whereas I was concerned with , lr,rrrlit. From the beginning the concept of change has been the ideological basis ,rl rrry work. All the way down there's absolutely nothing static - nothing that r lr rr ", noI change, or instigate real change. Most Minimal work disregards change. I lrrrrris cl.rim to be inert, static, imrnovably beyond time. But the status quo is an r I I r r', rorr, .r dangerous illusion politically. [... ]  

',r, r,r'/ ls there any difference in communication between social systems and l,lrv .rr ,rl ol biological ones?  

ll,rrrr l{'lirr lthysical orbiologicalptocessestotaketheircourse,thereisnoneed l,,r 11,,' l)r('sence of a viewer - unless, as with some participatory works, his t,lr\,,r,,r1 ('ncrgy is required (he then becomes an indispensable part of the \',rl nr',, lrlrysical environment). However, there is no need for anybody to get rrr, rrt,rlly irrvolved. These systems function on their own, since their operation ,l,rr", l1qpl l,rl<cPl.rceintheviewer'smind(naturallythisdoesnotpreventamental rrr r'ntlI rrrrr.tl t'csponse).  

llrr' rrriliing ol a social situation, however, usually follows a different pattern. llr,'rr' tlrr'proccss lakes place exclusively in the minds of people. Without l'rrrl rl),nrt\ llrt'r'c is no social set. Take the MoMA Poll in last year's'lnformation' show: the worl< was based orr a particular political situation circunrscribed by the lndochina Wat Nixon's and Rockefeller's involvement in it. MoMA's close ties to both, my own little quarrels with the museum as part of the Art Workers Coalition's activities, and then all the minds of the people who had a stake in this game the Vietcong as much as the Scarsdale lady on her culture tour to the city. The result of the poll - approximately 2 to 1 against Rockefeller/Nixon and the war - is only the tip of the iceberg. The figures are not quite reliable because MoMA, as usual, did rrot follow instructions, and the polls have to be taken with a grain of salt.  

Emily Genauer gave us a little glimpse of the large base of the worl< in her review of the show She wrote: 'One may wonder at the humour (propriety, obviously, is too archaic a concept even to consider) of such poll-tal<ing in a museum founded by the governor's mother, headed now by his brother, and served by himself and other members of his family in important financial and administrative capacities since its lounding 40 years ago.'With this little paragraph she provided some ol the bacl<ground for the work that was not intelligible for the politically less-informed visitors of the museum. She also articulated feelings that are shared by the top people at numerous museums. [t goes lil<e this: We are the guardians of culture. We honour artists by inviting them to show in our museum, we want them to behave lil<e guests; proper, polite and grateful. After all, we have put up the dough for this place.  

The energy of information interests me a lot. lnformation presented at the right time and in the right place can be potentially very powerful. It can affect the general social fabric.  

Such things go beyond established high culture as it has been perpetrated by a taste-directed art industry. Of course I don't believe that artists really wield any significant power. At best, one can focus attention. But every little bit helps. In concelt with other people's activities outside the art scene, maybe tlre social climate of society can be changed. Anyway, whenyou work with the'real stuff' you have to thinl< about potential consequences. A lot of things would never enter the decision-making process if one worked with symbolic representations that have to be weighed carefully. lf you work with real-time systems, well, you probably go beyond Duchamp's position. Real-time systems are double agents. They might run under the heading 'art', but this culturization does not prevent them from operating as normal. The MoMA Poll had even more energy in the museum than it would have had in the street - real socio-political energy, not awe-inspiring symbolism. [... ]

ns lhe cult of high modernism tumbled lrom its lofty throne, the scientific lhcories of Claude Shannon, Norbert Wiener and Ludwig von Bertalanffy gained sLrbs[autial purchase in the arts. Radically opposed to the romantic emotionality ol cxplessionism, Abraham Moles arrd Max Bense's theories of inforrnation ,rt'sthetics', Roy Ascott's cybernetic art theories and Jacl< Burnham's 'systems ,rcsthetics' became influentiaI models for more rational approaches to making ,rncl Lrnderstanding art. Losing their lustre by the mid 1970s, they disappeared Irorn art discourses for nearly two decades, apparently gathering dust but, as rt'tcnt affairs sLlggest, also gathering steam. Historical and critical writing .rtkl lcssing these aesthetic theories began to emerge in the 1990s and accelerated rrr the 2000s, when a number of exhibitions and symposia were devoted to rr'l.rtccl lhemes (including a'Systems Art'symposium at the Whitechapel Callery tt 2007). Specialized scholarly publications also mushroomed in the 2000s, rrrr ltrclirrg Francis Halsall's Sysrems of Art (2008). Paralleling the entry o[ this lr',lolic.rl l'ecuperation into museum contexts, scholarly writing on the subject lr,rs t'ntered into more mainstream academic discourses, including Pamela Lee's r lrtottopltobia (MIT Press, 2004) and the celebration of Burnham's work in the lrl t rt't lr .rr.rniversary issue of Artforum in2O12.To borrow a line from Hans Haacke's t,r,rposc(l 1971 work ironically dedicated to Wiener and resuscitated by scholar I rrl,r' Sl<r'cbowsl<i: All Systems Go!'r  

( ontcnlporary discourses surror,rnding systems aesthetics, however, tend to Lrr li ,rn .rppleciation of the alternate art histories that emerged around rrrl,rrrrr.rtional, cybernetic and systems approaches to art.

So, while it is important to recognize the vital contributions of Burnham's theories, it is equally important to recognize that they were not without precedent, and that those precedents contributed to the overall ecology of discourses olwhich his were a part, just as recent scholarship on systems aesthetics is part of a larger ecology of art-historical writing. The emerging literature has only begun to scrutinize these issues and to contend with why those aesthetic theories lost artistic currency in the 1970s, how they increasingly and differentially came to regain it, beginning in the 1990s, and wl-rat their possible hermeneutic uses are today. The question I propose is: How has the historicization of those interpretive syntheses in the 1960s been 'reprogrammed'by contemporary artists and writers, and to what ends?

Marga Bijvoet's Arf os Inquiry: Toward New Collaborations Between Art, Science andTechnology (1997) is a pioneering yet under-recognized monographic study of art in the 1960s and early 1970s.a A key aspect of Bijvoet's framing ol this terrain draws on information theory, cybernetics and systems theory, with particular emphasis on the aesthetic theories ofJack Burnham. She discusses the application of biologist Ludwig von Bertalanffy's general system theory in Burnham's formulation of a'systems aesthetics' inhis Artforum essay of that title and in his book Beyond Modern Sculpture, both published in 1968.s  

ln 'Gemini Rising, Moon in Apollo' (1998), I noted that in presenting 'such diverse artists as Joseph l(osuth, Hans Haacke and Sonia Sheridan', Burnham's 1970'Software' exhibition, 'implicitly problematized distinctions between "art and technology" and other experimental art media and technological invention' includingwhat had come to be known as hypertext and intelligentenvironments.6 ln'The House thatJack Built'(1998), Iclaimed that the relationship Burnham posited'between experimental art practices and "art and technology" questioned conventional distinctions between them, and oflered important insights into the complementarity of conventional, experimental and electronic media in the emerging cultural paradigm later theorized as postmodernity'.2  

Mitchell Whitelaw's 1998 essay,'1968/1998: Rethinking a Systems Aesthetic'8 emphasized Burnham's 'anticipation of contemporary concerns', such as the 'cybernetic organism', 'self-organizing systems in relation to scnlpture', and 'an art embracing "real time information processing"'. Similarly, he noted, the reentry of terms like cybernetics and systems into the critical vocabulary of cultural discourse give new relevance to Burnham's systems aesthetics.  

Simon Penny states that he gravitated to Burnham's 'visionary and pioneering' writing as a sculpture student in the late 1970s, and notes that it influenced his pursuit of interactive art practice as well as his own theoretical work.e Although it is common to read that 'the impact of Burnham's work was limited',tO Penny's ,r(colrnt suggests that its impact was perhaps much greater among artists than .u)rong critics and historians. Indeed, the influence of Beyond Modern Sculpture ,rrrcl tlre important essays in Arts magazine and Artforum therefore cannot be rrrc.rsured in footnotes. However, a significant proportion of anglophone artists wlro came of age during the span of Beyond Modern Sculpture's five editions, pr inted between 1968-78, knew about Burnham and his theories. Now, nearly lr.rll'a century after its publication, Burnham's work is suitably historical, and its pr.r.science sufficiently verifiable. As a result, his aesthetic theories are becoming rrrrrch more palatable to contemporary art historians.  

By 2000, it had become increasingly apparent that the exclusion and rilrcttoization confronting the practice and criticism of new media art and the l,rlgcl historiography of art and technology required an explicit suturing ,,lr'.rtegy. In Art in the Information Age'(2001 )[argued that by'interpreting r rrnceptual art and art-and-technology as reflections and constituents of broad r rrltural transformations during the information age' categorical distinctions r,rrr be relaxed, allowing parallels to be drawn between seemingly diverse pr,rctices, oflering new insight into contemporary art.rr Informed by Burnham's tlrt'or-y of systems aesthetics and his notion of software as a metaphor for art, rrry .rnalysis of works by Levine, Haacke and t(osuth in'Software' led to the urrri lusion that in the information age,'meaning and value are not embedded in olr;t'cts, institutions or individuals so much as they are abstracted in the lrrotltrction, manipulation and distribution of signs and information'. (436) lrrr,rlly, limplicitly applied Burnham's systems approach to analyse the system lry which art history is written. Using Haacke and Ascott as examples, I claimed t lr,rl the historicization of an artist's work as conceptual art or art and technology ",,rys lcss about their worl< than it does about the institutional mechanisms that lr,rvl created and reinforced categorical distinctions ... at the expense of rr llrrl il'ying continuities between them'. (438)  

( )n top of these early art-historical reappraisals of systems aesthetics, after tlrr' l.rrglislr publication of Niklas Luhmann's Art ss Social System in 2000, llrrrnlr.rr.n's brilliant oddball 1960s theory gained high-powered company. A ,t.r1i1it'ring number of publications addressing Burnham and his ideas were I'r,rrlutc(l in the 2000s, includingwork by more mainstream scholars. This point r', rrrrpolt.rr.rt because, as Gere has noted, a 'problem facing discourse concerning ,,r , ,rllt'tl rrew media art was how it had been contextualized and historicized ... rroI IIr,rl therewasnocriticaldiscourse,butratherthatitremainsthepreserveof tlr,r',r'involved, with little or no connection or engagement with outsiders.'r2 llrrrlliinl,i that gap, Lee embraces Burnham's theory of systems aesthetics, ,r ,,r'rlinll that'the impact of systems discourse within both the sciences and humanities is immeasurable... its rhetoric informs and certainly facilitates a new understanding of many of the artistic practices of the 1960s.'13  

As in'Art in the lnformation Age', many of these art-historical recuperations directly conlront discourses that spurned or ignored Burnham's theories. Similarly, they draw parallels between systems aesthetics and other, more authorized methods in order to identify continuities and erode categorical distinctions between the historical and current discourses of new media and mainstream contemporaty art. For example, Halsall has engaged Burnham's systems aesthetics in a discourse with Luhmann, Arthur Danto, Rosalind l(rauss, Nicolas Bourriaud and other writers, proposing a systems-theoretical method that draws together diverse forms of art practice and interpretative models.ta ln AII Systems Go: Recovering Hans Haacke's Systems Art'(2008), Skrebowsl<i tool< on art historian Benjamin Buchloh, using Burnham's 'Systems Aesthetics' to counter Buchloh's strict division of Haacke's work into two camps, before and after the influence of systems aesthetics: 'those earlier projects that emphasized "physiological, physical and biological processes" and the "mature" - i.e. polltical - works'.1s He claims that Buchloh's antipathy toward systems aesthetics blinded him from registering Haacke's ongoing concern with systemic approaches to art that provide continuity between his biological and political works: 'Recovering the influence of Burnham's systems aesthetics on Haacke encourages us to understand his practice holistically, revealing a fundamental consistency underlying its stylistic diversity' (61 ). Turning Buchloh's words against him, Skrebowski argues that his position is founded on a binary opposition between nature and society: 'for Buchloh, Haacke's art cannot be political until he "transfers his interests from biological and physical systems to social slstern5"'.te Skrebowski deconstructs this mythic division and concludes:  

Systems theory offers a way to thint< tl-re natural and social analogically, and Haacke's art, via his engagement with Burnham's systems aesthetics, makes use of it to do exactly that. We can now see once more that Haacke's critical artistic interventions build on an unbroken, ascending scale of systemic complexity - from organic elements, through plants, animals, and finally up to human beings. (61 )  

Haacke explicitly eschewed hierarchical judgements between biological and social systems. Burnham likely would agree with Sl<rebowsky's systemic interpretation. Its recognition of the recapitulation of fundamental orders, relations and structures at various levels of organization parallels alchemy, structuralism and kabbalah, all highly refined theories of systemic relationships that fascinated him. Within the emerging historiography of systems aesthetics, Skrebowski's reappraisal of Haacke and his dismantling of Buchloh's position demonstrate the hermeneutic potential of,the systems approach.  

ln Art After Philosophy' (1969), Joseph l(osuth stated that'art "lives" through influencing other art, not by existing as the physical residue of an artist's ideas. The reason why diflerent artists from the past are "brought alive" again is because some aspect of their work became "usable" by living artists'.'i Kosuth's biological metaphor suggests that art is a quasi-living organism, an open system whose elements have relevance only when they participate in the current functioning of the organism. The same claims can be made of art-historicaI interpretations. Were I not so sensitive to that issue perhaps fewer words would have been dedicated to this inevitably self-promotional recitation of my owl'l historiographical contributions. I know that by interpreting and commenting on my own ideas and inserting [and reinserting] them into a living discourse I revitalize them.

Artforum, the journal that published'Systems Aesthetics'in 1968, later ignored Burnham, whose name was invoked in its pages only twice between 1998 and lt then rediscovered Burnham in2012, celebrating'Systems Aesthetics' .rrrd the 'Software' exhibition. ln the context of my'strategic hlstoriography'this rcrrewed interest in Burnham by a prominent art journal was a double-edged sword. On one edge, such mainstream recognition vindicated years of worl< conducted in relative obscurity; on the other edge,Artfurum ignored the scholarly worl< that initiated the process ofrecovering Burnham from the rubbish heap of hislory. Neither Caroline Jones' essay 'Systems Symptoms' nor Anne Wagner's 'l).rta Almanac' mention Bijvoet, Gere, Penny, Whitelaq Halsall, Sl<rebowski, rnyself or any of the artists, curators and scholars (many of whom are connected with new media art) who have contributed to this project since the mid 1990s. lt is .rs though Artforum rediscovered Burnham's work on its own, effectively r rccliting itself for this important recuperation, without acknowledging the prior st lrolarship, including this historiographical study of that literature. Furthermore, rn (he same issue of Artforum, Claire Bishop's essay'Digital Divide'limited its rlrscussion to'the mainstream art world'and dismissed the 'sphere of "new rrrt'rli.r" art'as a'specialized field of its own'. Thus, even as Bishop acknowledges tlrt' presence of new media art, she condones an account of contemporary art tlr,r( bracl<ets it out of the conversation, thereby reifying the gap between rrr,rinstream contemporary art and'new media art'that she ostensibly seeks to ,rrlrlrcss. A further analysis flollowing the approaches of Pierre Bourdieu and Nrlil.rs Luhmann offers usefulinsights into the systemic nature of these events.  

ln 'Tlre Field of Cultural Production ...'(1983) Bourdieu notes that'the literary ,,r ,rrtisticfieldisatall timesthesiteof astrugglebetween... thosewhodominate tlrl liclcl econornically and politically Iin this case Artforum and its contributors] ... and [those] who are least endowed with specific capital [scholars of new media art, andl tend to identify with a degree of independence from the economy...'re (321) The art journal chose Jones and Wagner - distinguished senior art historians - due to 'the value which the specific capital of [those] writers ... represents for the dominant fractions ... in the struggle to conserve the established order...'(322) The journal's failure to cite the work of the writers associated with new media art who have done the heavy lifting on re-evaluating Burnham's worl< constitutes an act of rhetorical violence by omission, with several effects: 1) it systematically strips originality and authenticity from that which is excluded from the journal's pages; 2) it usurps a field of scholarship and establishes the journal's dominance over that field in its own terms; 3) it shields mainstream contemporary art discourses from interlopers that potentially threaten the status quo; and 4) simultaneously reifies the journal's position of dominance as the arbiter of those discourses. As Bourdieu observes, 'the fundamental stake in literary struggles is the monopoly of literary legitimacy, i.e.,inter alia, the monopoly of the power to say with authority who is authorized to call himself a writer.' (323) ln other words, the journal wields 'the power to consecrate Icertain] producers'at the expense ofothers.'One ofthe difficulties of orthodox defence against heretical transformation of the field by a redefinition of the tacit or explicit terms of entry is the fact that polemics imply a form oi recognition; an adversary whom one would prefer to destroy by ignoring him cannot be combated without consecrating him'. (323) Much better to ignore them, bracket them out, leave them invisible...  

By contrast, in Art as Social System (2000) Luhmann argues that the robustness of a 'complex system' can be demonstrated by how it is capable of "processing a greater amount of irritation internally, that is, it can increase its own complexity more rapidly" (158). Following this approach, the present collection of texts aims to demonstrate the ability of art as an autonomous, autopoietic system to accommodate competing discourses that might otherwise undermine its operative closure.

# Frcrncis Hqlsqll Systems ot Arl//2OOB  

By the end of the '1960s the interest in the application of systems thinking by the mititary-industrial complex began to filter into cultural life. Between the years 1966 and 1972 there were a number of important exhibitions and publications that took the idea of systematicity as their central organizing principle, with titles such as Sysfems; Information; Software and Rodical Software' ["'l The journal Radicql Software [...] explored the intersections between technological systems and art. Eleven editions were published by The Raindance Corporation [...] forrned in New York in 1969 by the artist Frank Gillette Ias] 'an alternatlve media think tank: a source of ideas, publications, videotapes and energy providing a theoretical basis for implementing communication tools in the project of social change'.l[... ]  

As Marga Bijvoet noted [...]:  

Cybernetics and systems notions with their accompanying vocabularies were mainly applied to the possibilities of new media systems, such as video, cable, satellite, etc. words like system, feedback, information, software, parameter, entlopy and negentropy, process, pattern became the principal vocabulary in the writers' argumentations.2  

In the midst ol the curatorial and publishing activity was Jack Burnham's own exhibition'software'(The jewish Museum, NewYorl<, 1970). [... ] [T]he uniqueness of the show lay in its attempt to express thoroughly Burnham's concept of systems aesthetics:  

ln contrast to the numerous art and technology exhibitions which took place between '1966-1972, and which focused on the aesthetic applications of technotogical apparatus,'software'was predicated on the ideas of 'software'and 'information technology' as metaphors for art. He conceived of 'software' as parallel to the aesthetic principles, concepts or ptograms that underlie the forrnal embodiment of the actuat art objects, which in turn parallel 'hardware'''  

The show contained [...] innovative exhibits exploring ideas of systematicity, interactivity; the use of new technological systems in art making and the shift from singular art objects to systems of art. [... I Many worl<s were conceived of as completely interactive with full visitor participation. [..'l  

As llurnham explained,'Software' was  

... au attempt to produce aesthetic sensations without the intervening'object'; in lacl, to exacerbate the conflict ol sense of aesthetic tension by placing works ir.r rrundane, non-art formats.4  

As the rationale and exhibits in the show demonstrate, he was able to do this by rr rvol<ir.rg the concept of 'software' as both a central dynamic and metaphor for an rrrlcr.rctive art practice. To thus understand art as sofltware is to invoke the p,rr.rcligm of the coding of a computer program which is not copied in diflerent Ir,rrclware, but is rather given other manifestations. Les Levine, for example, saw lrrs contribution to'Software'in these specific terms, and wrote the following r l lsc ri ption of Sysfems Burn- off X Re sidual Sofnv ar e in the'Software' catal ogue :'l n nr,llrv cases an object is of much less value than the software concerning object. I I rt' olrject is the end of a system. The sofnvare is an open continuing system.'s  

More recently, Lev Manovich argued that the application of the metaphor of, '',nltware'can be extended beyond computers to a definition of art since the ,rr lvt'rrt of modernism in general:  

lir sumnrarize: from the new vision, new typography and new architecture of the l!)20s we move to new media of the 1990s; from'a man with a rnovie camera'to ,r user with a search engine, image analysis and visualization programs; from t inerna, the technology of seeing, to a computer, the technology of memory; lrorn t lc l.r m iliarization to information design. In short, the ovont-garde becomes softvvore. llris statement should be understood in two ways. On the one hand, software t rrclifies and naturalizes the techniques ofthe old avant-garde. On the other hand, soltware's new techniques of working with media represent the new avant-garde ol the meta-media society.G  

Nl,rrroviclr, lil<e Burnham, was lool<ing for an adequate vocabulary to describe a \.rr('lV ol diverse artistic practices. Both recognized the potential in systems rlrr,ory Io reframe a discussion of the avant-garde. For Burnham in particular this , r rt , rilt'cl .r formulation of an aesthetic theory based upon the central paradigm of tlr,' possiltility for a system to be conceived as a medium for art. [...]  

lo Lrnderstand art as software is to understand it in terms of codes and rrrlorrr.rtiort rather than in material or medium-specific terms. Burnham t,r,,, l,rillrc(l that systems aesthetics necessitated the dissolution of the material ;','r rlit'ity of traditiorral artistic mediurns, so that the traditional 'objet d'art' rr,'rrltl t'vcntually be replaced by'aesthetic systems'.  

[The] culturat obsession with the art object is slowly disappearing and being replaced by what might be called 'systems consciousness'. Actually, this shifts lrorn the direct shaping of matter to a concent for organizing quantities of energy and infornration.T  

In his advocacy of 'the organizir-rg quantities of energy and inlormation' for a new type of art-making, Burnham advanced an alt that was both ontologically unstable and interactive. He thr,rs specifically linl<ed a post-f,ormalist artistic attitude - prevalent in the art world at the time, wl.rich was also interested in exploring de-ontologized arrd interactive art - to the contemporary discourse of systems theory. In 1968 he wrote:  

The post-formalist sensibility naturally responds to stirnuli both within and outside the proposed art lolmat... [but] the lerm systems aesthetic seems to encompass the present situation more fully.s  

In doing so, Burnham articulated in systenrs-tl.reoretical terms the emerging historical situation in art practice toward the end of the 1960s. [...] Systems aesthetics can also operate as what Peter Osborne called a 'retrospective critical discourse', which 'does not need to dlscover its terms literally or empirically within the discourse of the period under discussion'.e This means that systems aesthetics can also be identified as a function oi the discursive system from which it is observed and constituted; it thus can be integrated into a coherent historical and sociological narrative.r0 [... ]  

It is my argument here that Burnham's systems aesthetics is compatible with a variety ofart-historical descriptions and can therefore be employed as part of a retrospective critical discourse of systems aesthetics. Thus conceived, systems aesthetics allows lor an expanded field of practice, implying a shift from singular art objects to the use of systems as artistic mediums. These descriptions include the 'den-raterialized' art object (Lucy Lippard), 'intermedia' (Dicl< Higgins) and the'post-rnedir-rn-r condition' ( Rosal i nd l(rauss ).  

Lucy Lippard's definition of the 'dematerialized' art object highlighted wlrat was at stake when the anti-modernist aesthetic led to a dismantling of the modernist art object. [...] Such work can be understood as exploring an aesthetics of systems, and in doing so thus iurtctioned by investigating the ways in which it was embedded in various networks ol display, representation, meaning and control.  

Dick Higgins used the term'intermedia'in 1966 to explain Ihow] 'nluch of the best worl< being produced today seems to fall between media'. [...] Civen its plurality, intermedia art is resistant to an account of it in terms of the nr.rterial specificity required of it by a limited accoun[ of modernism. Thus the tcrrn 'intermedia art' is, like Lippard's phrase, compatible with Burnham's .lccount of a practice that attempted to mal(e art without the production ol tunique art objects. [... ]  

Krauss's notion of the post-medium condition tal<es account of a situation in the 1960s which was also described by Lippard, Higgins and crucially, Burnham. I his was a situation when artists began to form a critique of modernist mediumspecificity. The systems aesthetic thus provides the opportunity to reinscribe nraterially diverse practices (such as minimalism, conceptualism and new media .rlt) within the single medium of system. In doing so the'retrospective critical cliscourse'of systems theory provides the vocabulary to rnap different artistic strategies within a single rubric. One may thus discuss historical examples as coutiglrous with rr-rore recent ones. [...]  

Recent curatorial interest in systems has demonstrated both its effectiveness .rs a descriptive paradigm and its relevance to contemporary plactice. For exanple, in 'Open Systerrs: Rethinking Art c. Modern, 2005), curator Donna De Salvo [...] demorrstrated that as an organizing principle system was flexible ar-rd suggestive enough for 'rethinking' lristorical practice whilst also providing a locus that is effective, rigorous and engaging (and popular). The concept of system thus provided an opportllnity to re-evaluate the chosen work in a broader historical and aesthetic context in which the often unhelpfully narrow titles of minimalism, conceptualism and so forth could be sidestepped in lavour of critical descriptions grounded upon a shared interest ir.r systenrs of display, lepresentation, meaning and control. [...] [f]he exhibition uncovered interesting connections between artists who produced work as visually diverse .rs Robert Smithson, Carl Andre, Lygia Clark, Andy Warhol and Bruce Nauman. To reflect this systemic connection [...] all works on display were'linked by their use ofa generative or repetitive system as a way ofredefining the work ofart, the self and the nature of representation'.rr [...] De Salvo's claim on the persisting relevance of systems art is supported by three instances of contemporary curatorial and artistic interest in systems.  

Filst, several shows between2OO4 and 2006 concentrated on a reappraisal of .rrt from the late 1960s and early 1970s, incLrding high profile retrospectives of Donald Judd [in Europe], Dan Flavin and Robert Smithson Iin the USl. This was lollowed by contemporary installations by artists who had been active since the 1960s, including Bruce Nauman's Rsw Materials (2004-5, Tate Modern) and l(icl-rard Serra's 2006-7 installations at the Guggenlreim in Bilbao and New York. All this activity reinforced the cues that contemporary artists (for example, Liam Cillick, Carsten Hriller and Mark Dion) were clearly tal<ing lrom conceptualism, r.niuimalism and institutional critique, and thr.rs demonstrated how systems could be employed to map an expanded field of practice from historically dillerent times.  

Second, such a mapping would draw direct connections with other artists who have specifically investigated how their own bodies are situated within various social, physical and psychic systems. ln [the artist Stelarc'sl bodily modifications he subordinates his physical body to cybernetic and technological systems. For example, in Ping-Body (1996), his body was controlled by pr-osthetic extensions remotely controlled by user s over an internet connection. Brian Eno's 77 Million Paintings (2006) used self-generating and developmental algorithmic systems to create a sequence of evolving patterns or'paintirrgs'displayed on monitors and television screens. These examples demonstrate the diversity of art practices whose predominant mediums can be observed as systems.  

Third, renewed contemporary interest in self-critical practice that expands its scope beyond the limits of a singular artwork into the social systems within which it is placed has been the specific tenet of French curator Nicolas Bourriaud's [...] concept of'relational aesthetics' since the start of the 1990s (again, tl're examples of Liam Cillick, Carsten Holler and Mar[< Dion are appropriate). [This] has pushed for a move into 'the realm of human interaction and its social context, rather than the assertion of an independent and private symbolic space'.r2 Such work arguably takes its cues from the rigorous probing of the status of art and its institutions that is characteristic of art that engages in systems aesthetics (for example, Burnham and Haacke's work from the late 1960s and early 1970s). Bourriaud's Relational Aesthetics argues that art institutions might become [...] part of the social systems that create new venues for relations among different practices and viewers; they are both 'frame' for the work and part of its medium. Relational aesthetics is thus compatible with systems aesthetics in so far as it radically reconceives the purposes and effects ofart practice, and thus puts into question common notions of the nature of art objects. This reconceived understanding locates art in a system of relationships between art and its environment, its viewers and art discourse.  

I close with a further example of how the notion of system might be usefully employed by contemporary art historians. This is in providing an account of socalled 'new media art'. New media art has had a problematic reception in arthistorical terms. As Charlie Gere obserued, it raises the question as to what critical discourse is supposed to deal with it: 'tf new media art wishes to be taken seriously then it is necessary to start to develop appropriately robust and convincing means by which it can be examined critically.' t...1 [f]he point was 'not that there is no critical discourse, but rather that it remains the preserve of those involved, with little or no connection or engagement with outsiders.'r3  

Cere's claim is one that art historians should take very seriously. However, this requires [overcoming] the tradirional art-historical preoccupation with specificity of media and [row this problem may be reconciled] with the pr.oliferation of differing media employed in new media art. WJ.T. Mitchell rliagr.rosed the problem in the following terms:  

ln the field of art history, with its obsessive concern for the materiality and 'specificity' of media, the supposedly 'dernaterialized' realm of virtual and digital rnedia, as well as the whole sphere of mass media, are commonly seen either as beyond the pale or as a threatening invader, gathering at the gates of the aesthetic .rnd artistic citadel.'r4  

svstems aesthetics and the vocabularies of systems theory provide, I argue, the lr.rsis for such an 'appropriately robust and convincing' theory of new media art. I hey do so by expanding the discourse on new media beyond a discussion o[ a n.lrrow set of art practices corresponding to a limited set of media into a tliscussion about systems art more generally. Systems theory and systems ,rcsthetics thus employ the idea of system as medium to inscribe a coherency irrto what would otherwise seem to be utterly disparate works. This opens these works up to art-historical analysis and provides continuity with historical plccedents which may, in the first instance, appear materially incomparable. [... ]

# Cqroline A. Jones Systems Symptoms: Jqck Burnhqm's'Systems Aesthetics'/ /20ll  

A brief meteor,Jack Burnham blazed forth in September declaring'Systems Aesthetics' to be the pre-erninent mode of contemporary art-nraking. How could this sculpture teacher from the Midwest have gotten it so right? ln the ensuing decades, what Burnham called 'systems' came to define some of the most significant cultural developments of our time, even if this genealogy has been obscured. Undeclared as such, systems thinking now suffuses the art world as we know it. Consider: The work of such different artists as Olafirr Eliasson, Andrea Fraser, Damien Hirst, Seth Price and Tino Sehgal, as well as platforms such as Triple Canopy, would be hard to understand without recourse to some concept of art as a disparate, sprawling, yet rule-bound system within which artists must strategically acl<nowledge dealers, viewers, performers, participants, buyers, fabricators, curators, programmers, institutions, infrastructures, the environment, magazines suclr as Artforum, algorithms, and other constellations around and within the ever more expansive work of art.  

Burnham called it. And Artforum, under editorJohn Coplans, continued to pusl-t it, with lawrence Alloway's 'Network: The Art world Described as a system' appearing in 1972. But Burnham's thesis has become unaccountably obscure. one factor was tlre revulsion that soot't confronted the very term systems and the source of its discourse - Burnham's first footnote refers to the Rand Corporation's 1964 publication Anolysis fo r Mititary Decisf ons, and the obvious entanglement of systems theory with the military-lndustrial complex was a fatal attribute in the eyes of his largely leftist audience during the Vietnam era. By 1980, Burnham himself was unwilling to continue plumping for this unlikely constellation of wat games and process art, castigating his early techno-utopianism as a 'panacea that failed'.r But the ultimate answer may be that systems didn't fail: They simply wormed their way into the art world like a weakened virus. Contemporaneiry is ltuilt on Burnham-like 'systems'; their code laces our cultural genome. Exploring Lhe evolution from Burnham's vision of a 'systems aesthetics' at the core of artworld discourse to our current reality of systemic practices not only opens up .rlternative historical perspectives on the intervening decades br-rt suggests a fresh view of much contemporary art. The systems virus is still here - but it has mutated liom Burnham's engineering and industrial setups into the social and electronic protocols that govern our world. Burnham bemoaned that the systems aesthetic 'has no critical vocabulary so necessary for its defence'; what we got instead was a clitical vocabulary utterly defended from its own sources in systems thinking.  

Reading the original 1968 essay today is an exercise in reverse teleology. It reveals Burnham as an ambitious player in the high-stakes gamble over the legacy of modernisn initiated in the 1950s by Clement Greenberg and carried on by Michael Fried. [...]Burnham's systems outlined a counter-trajectory that laid claim to the entire future of contemporary art.2 Systems artists were not only 'post-formalist' (which Burnham argued explicitly) but 'post-Minimalist' (as ArtJorum editor Robert Pincus-Witten would soon declare). ln'Systems Aesthetics' [...] Burnham recognized physical 'systems'that enmeshed the viewer in a range oI embodied, conceptual and planetary entanglements that art would both i rrstantiate and reveal.  

Despite his own debt to phenomenology, Fried's theories of vanguard rrodernism (like Greenberg's)famously demanded a strict separation of art from rhe world. [... ] Ambulatory environments, let alone the 'processing' of the viewer through some durational engagement, were part of an abjured theatricality. By contrast, Burnham flatly rejected the object and the segregation it implied, engaging systems that provoked phenomena and allowed the systems artist to reduce 'the technical and psychical distance between his artistic output and the ploductive means of society'. [...] Burnham argued that 'in an advanced technological culture the most important artist best succeeds by liquidating his position as al tist vis-i-vis society'.3 t... I [f lhe application of a 'systems aesthetic' could render form secondary - and thus open up art practice to a wide range of ur-gent issues including'such concerns as maintaining the biological livability of the Earth, producing more accurate models of social interaction, understanding the growing symbiosis in man-machine relationships, establishing priorities for the usage and conservation of natural resources, and defining alternate patterns oI education, productivity and leisure'.4  

It seems clear that part of Burnham's agenda was to arrogate lor artists goals that could rival the systems being developed elsewhere (from Landsat to IBM ). In 1968, sr.rch systematic ambitions were epitomized by the work ol Dan Flavin, Les Levine and, even more consistently, Hans Haacke, on whom Burnham had just pLrblished a first monograph.s Burnham's support for Haacke, and Haacke's admiration for Burnham, vectored them both to MIT - arguably the narthex of all things system in 1967-68.  

Burnham must have finished the Artforum piece just before moving to MlT, where he joined the first cohort of fellows at Gyorgy lGpes' Center for Advanced Visual Studies and pitched a course on'Systems and Art' he had developed with a systems engineer, Gustave Rath. I(epes was already actively engaged with systens theory at the time, having solicited texts from biologist Ludwig von Bertalanffu (whose writings Burnham footnoted in the 'Systems Aesthetics' essay) and cybernetics theorist Norbert Wiener.6 But where l(epes would see his job as ameliorating the alien rybernetic world of 'command, control and communication', Burnham subscribed to total engagemert. His 'Systems and Art' course and the aesthetics essay were staging grounds for techno-sociality in itsell not merely 'a novel way of rearranging surfaces and spaces' but'flundamentally concerned with the implementation of the art impulse in an advanced technological society'.i This grand view was refined in a secondArfforum article, published in September 1969: 'Real Time Systems'. Here Burnham compared artists to 'programs and subroutines', their work'an archaic information processing system'we need in order to'prepare new codes and analyse data'.8 Art is not special in this regard, exhibiting the same protocols as other knowledge-producing activities, but it is better at revealing the constructedness oI consciousness. Segueing to the computer-controlled real-time systems coordinating contemporary economic and military domains, Burnham acknowledged the 'instinctive antipathy' that most humanists have toward 'these irrmensely complex computer systems. Their Orwellian overtones far overshadow their conceivable use as artists'tools. But practically, it is imperative that artists do tunderstand them - both technically and philosophically.'e  

The radical consequences of this imperative were revealed by the legendary cancellation of Hans Haacke's planned retrospective at the Solomon R. Cuggenheim Museum in the spring of 1977. Exemplifying the 'liquidation' of the artist in a way Burnham had never anticipated, the Guggenheim cancellation demonstrated that systerns art had merged with society's systems and was thereby subject to their political, legal and economic forces. The cancellation was thus both the apotheosis of systems and the moment after which it would become difficult to say its name. [n this light, it is moving to read Burnham's response to the exhibition that never happened, writing inJune 1971 of Haacke's plan to work with 'physical, biological and social systems', the totality revealing the artist's commitment to 'the interconnectedness of all systems' and an art that could interrogate'the way the world functions on its most essential levels'. Civen the cancellation, Burnham was forced to conclude that the Guggenheim had decisively altered Haacke's 'systems art', which could therefore be understood as drawing closer'in its semiotic structure... to the ritusl drama (where the artist's premises are recapitulated in everyday life) and away from the plcsfic orfs'.ro (The emphases in both instances are Burnham's.) Never more prescient than here in his anticipation of the shift from techno-mechanical systems to social protocols, Burnham nonetheless lost the capacity to shape artistic discourse, or to advocate for 'systems' as a concept. Hencef,orth 'systems', with their uncontrollable boundaries, would be abandoned for a more tractable art-world discourse of 'institutional critique', one thatArfforum authors and editors would be active in promoting. We might consider whether institutional critique is, indeed, our 'ritual drama', with the secret life of systems that undergirds it emerging later, and elsewhere, in unacknowledged ways.  

The Guggenheim cancellation may have cemented a shift to the social that was already under way in Burnham's thinking. [... I In the introduction to his own anthology of systems essays, Burnham was surprisingly personal about the fr-rnction they had served: 'Ultimately systems theory may be another attempt by science to resist the emotional pain and ambiguity that remain an unavoidable aspect of life'."  

But systems' virions survived. By the 1990s, what I would call systemic artworl<s had emerged with a vengeance. Just as Burnham had recognized an array of physical and material entanglements in work otherwise described as conceptual or dematerialized, systemic artworks diatectically reject or critically torque the virtual ideologies of the Internet to materialize the links that join archival, research-driven, process-oriented, labour-intensive, recursive, informational, social and communicational aspects of art. In 2012, Burnham's concetns about everything from the consumption of natural resources to the implementation of machine technology seem tailor-made [or the contemporary art world. Take Docunrenta 13 this past summer, where such systematics were witnessed in the crowd of artists offering soil currency (Claire Pentecost), time banks (Julieta Aranda and Anton Vidol<le), off-limits apiaries (Pierre Huyghe), or machine-propelled air currents (Ryan Gander). And Burnham's words to l(epes lrom November 1967 are entirely in line with the Arup-infused logic of much contemporary art and architecture: 'What I propose is not that the artist become an engineer, but that for some phases of his problem-solving it would be advisable for him to think lil<e an engineer Imanaging] input-output exchanges of materials, energy and information.'12 lf Burnham turned from the systems he prophesied, we would find it impossible to do so. We cannot turn from them because they are turning within us, the dynamic engine of our imbrication in lnany aspects of lived reality - the art world, but also the economic, legal, ecological and political worlds we navigate and that seem to implode or explode daily. Whether or not we want to see or name them, systems are us.

# Boris Groys The Mimesis of Thinking//zOAs  

The contemporary 'art system' emerged as an effect of the shift in artistic practices that took place during the and 1970s. Art is always in flux; its forms are always subjected to a historical evolution. But in the 1960s the role of the artist was subjected to a radical redefinition that has not lost its validity until now. Until the 1960s the romantic image of the artist remained fundamentally intact. The 'true' artist was understood to be a lonely cl eative individual following not the external rules and conventions of society, but excl usively his or her 'inner necessity', as l(andinsky famously put it [Concerning the Spiritual in Art, 79121. The role of the artist was to act outside modern bureaucracies, outside the huge socio-economic machines of modern industrial production. The creative artistic act sel ved as a paramount example of a non-alienated, liberated worl<. Of course, the artist, in a very acute way, experienced dependency on the capitalist art marl(et, on the plevailing public taste, on tlre explicit or implicit censorship in the name of generally accepted uorms and values. But the duty of the artist was seen precisely in the struggle for liberation flrom these external norms, values and dependencies. This struggle was regarded as possible and even necessary because the artistic creative act itself was understood as being uniquely autonomous, internally flree. Art had to manifest this inner freedom openly to be recognized as 'true' art. But it is precisely this inner autonomy and freedom of the creative act that was questioned by the art practices of the 1960s and 1970s.  

It was during this period that mass cultural imagery began to invade the whole visual field of contemporary society. An individual artist could no longer compete effectively with the commefcial apparatuses of anonymous ilnage production. ln additiorr, emelging conputer technology demonstrated the possibility of producing, processitlg and registering images without any direct intervention by a human producer or spectator. Some authors and artists reacted to this loss of individual control over image production with desperate protest Ie.g. the Situatiorrists]. Other artists developed a new strategy, which operated through the individual appropriation of mass-produced images Ie.g. Pop]. In both cases the 'system' was seen as something purely external, as something opposed to the unique subjectivity of an individual artist. Retrospectively, it seer.ns that the real shift was effectuated by minimal and conceptual art of the period, because in this context an individual artwork was understood as being inscribed in a certain system of image production and communication from the staft. This shift was paftially inspired by dilferent linguistic theories, sucl'l as French structuralism or the Wittgensteinian concept of language games. Notwithstanding the differences in these details, all these theories interpreted an individual speech act as an application of a set of general linguistic rules. Accordingly, the advanced art of this time understood the individual act of art production as being originally regulated by a 'system', as following a certain general rule from the beginning, and as being inscribed into a certain social practice even befole its product was submitted to a definite social use.  

This change of attitude towards the notion of a system can easily be nrisunderstood as an act of capitulation vis-i-vis the apparatuses of technological progress and commercialized mass culture. But in fact this change allowed the artist to analyse and criticize the dominant regime of image production and distribution by his or her own artistic means for the first time. Indeed, if the act of art production is understood as fully autonomous and genuinely free, then the artist can only be a slave or a victim of the external systems of the art market, art institutions and so on, being completely heterogeneous in relationship to these systems. But if the creative act itself is part oIa certain system and guided from the beginning by a certain set o[ rules, then the artist has a unique inner access to the system. And this means that the artist has a unique competence and power in dealing with this system. The integration o[ an individual creative act into a communicative system was interpreted by some theoreticians as a sign of the death of autonomous artistic subjectivity. But this subjectivity successfully suryived its death by making the system itself the object of its inner, intimate experience. There are many ways to understand what kind of system is guiding the inner creativity of an artist. Some artists wanted to analyse the existing systems, the existing visual codes that compel the artist to use a certain vocabulary of images and to combine them according to a certain set of rules. Other artists tried to develop alternative, utopian systems of visual communication that would be able to supplant and substitute the existing image regime. There were artists such asJoseph Beuys or Lygia Clark who Ifrom the 1960s onwards] developed their own myths, their own complicated systems of meaning production and communication. And there were the artists who played ironically with the socially accepted visual codes to subvert and deconstruct them, such as Marcel Broodthaers or llya Kabal<ov. Overall, the art of the 1960s shifted its focus from the individual creative act to a description, investigation and development of communication systems and visual codes. Accordingly, the art world as a whole began to be perceived as an 'art system'. The metaphysical loneliness of the romantic artist was substituted by strategies of participation and collaboration. The artist became a part of the art system, of the art bureaucracy. The artist's main occupation became not [o create but to criticize. The paradoxical figure of a 'critical artist' that emerged in the 1960s announced an end to a long period of confrontation belween the individual artistcreator and the art critic serving the 'system', a conflict that contributed substantially to the dynamic of romantic and modernist art. [...]  

The typical Minimalist installation is perceived as a fragment of a formalized algorithm of reiterations and modifications. However powerful and fascinating the immediate visual impression of these installations on the viewer may be, ultimately they point to something invisible, merely conceivable, virtual. Clearly, the same set of binary oppositions, the same visual code that is manifested in the installations, can produce a potentially infinite row of new objects. That is why the viewer's imagination is stimulated to imagine the generative code, to imagine all the variations that can be generated by the code. Such an attempt, however, lmmediately points the viewer in the direction of the invisible set of rules on which the different variations are based. And that means nothing other than that an individual artistic decision is no longer understood as sovereign, as fully autonomous but, rather, as an individual application of the existing set of rules, as a realization of an option that is always already given. The same is true, of course, for Donald Judd's early installations as well as those of Carl Andre, where the objects mostly do not vary at all but are simply reiterated. Here the variations are reduced on the one hand to mere repetition within the framework of an installation. on the other hand, however, Judd varied materials and lorms from installation to installation in an easily understandable, transparent way. That was also true of Andre's installations, which practise pure combinations of the simplest geometric forms. This is a strategy of variation that puts the artists beyond the traditional opposition between affirmation and negation, between repetition and innovation. Hence if Minimalist artists themselves repeatedly insisted on the immediate presence of their objects, de facto the most important aspect in Minimalist installations took place in the zone of the invisible, that is, between the art objects.  

This view was formulated, with critical intent, in Michael Fried's famous essay Art and Objecthood' (1967). Fried criticized Minimalist installations for drawing the viewer's attention away from the individual artworks and into the space of the installation. According to Fried, in a Minimalist installation the presence of the space is felt more strongly than the presence of the art objects themselves. This is why Fried attributes a theatricality to Minimalist installation, which he characterizes as hostile to art. The reason for this critical assessment of Minimalist installation becomes clear when Fried writes that that which lies between the artworks, or even between the individual arts, can only be the theatre, the stage. To put it another way, for Fried that which takes place between artworks is always just another image - in this case an image of a stage. But, as I have tried to show what happens between artworks in a Minimalist installation is not theatre but a set of rules, a formal logic, an algorithm, which may generate an image but is not in itself an image. Minimalist installation is also crucially distinct from theatre in that it can be walked on Iin the case of Andre] and around. An installation does not present itselfto visitors as a stage that can only be observed from a certain position, but as a space for the flineur, for walking from one object to the other. The viewer's movement from one art object to another is guided by the same system o[ rules that determines the space between the individual artworks in an installation by linl<ing those artworks by a series of reiterations and modifications.  

One might say that Minimalist installation practises the mimesis of thinking. In that phrase, 'thinking' is understood to mean a step-by-step movement from one option to the other, from one variation to the other within an overarching, virtual system tlrat incorporates and ananges all such conceivable options and variations. The goal of using art as a mimesis of thinking unites almost all the main trends in the art of the 1960s and 70s. It also subsumes many of the attempts to use language - as a supposedly direct representation of thinking in the context of art. [...] But the infinity of thinl<ing cannot be represented by an individual image. Thinking progresses from one image to another in a systematic way without any conceivable end. Thinking is the infinite progressive movement, the infinite 'et cetera'. Therefore, it can be represented in the art context only in the form of an installation that recreates this progressive movement, even if only inside a finite, limited space. Minimalist installation represented the process of methodically, systematically organized thinking precisely by directing the visitor to a step-bystep movement from one object to the other. Here we are dealing with the same understanding of thinl<ing that lies at the basis of computer programming. And of, coulse, only the introduction of the computer made it possible to represent such thought processes and to formalize them to a greater extent. Minimal and conceptual art of the 1960s had, however, tal<en the decisive step in the dir-ection of representing thought processes by taking pure thinking as its object and thus aestheticizing it. In this sense Minimalism is at the same time very much a megalomaniacal maximalism that wants to transcend the limits of the finite installation space. Not only does the artist subject the uniqueness of his or her artistic decisions to an abstract, infinite generative code, but the artworl< itself also ceases to be a concrete, unique artwork, and instead presents itselffrom the outset as a fragment of a potentially infinite progression that, while it can certainly be understood, grasped and even continued at will, cannot be completely realized.  

Now, however, every programme for mimesis leads to countless difficulties and paradoxes. Magritte observed that a representation of an apple is not an apple and a representation of a pipe is rot a pipe. So too a representation of thinking by means of computer programs or artistic installations is not yet thinking. Human thinking is used lor the purpose of individual and collective suruival in the service of the survival instinct. 'lntelligent' machines and artistic installations do not thinl<; they merely represent thinking beyond any concern about their own survival and wellbeing. The mimesis of thinking is thus in many respects confronted with the same difficulties that iaced the mimesis of Nature. Above all, it faces the fundamental question ofhow one represents the system ofall possible options in the necessarily limited space of the artistic installation. The thinking is potentially infinite. The space of the installation, by contrast, is finite. Minimalist installation lives from the tension that results from the encounter of an abstract, infinite generative code that regulates the production of art objects within the installation space and the external, contingent characteristics of this space whose size limits the code's further realization. This incursion of the contingent into the infinite progression of thinking which takes its internally unmotivated, 'irrational' limit from the external form of the installation space, is, however, merely an external symptom of the irrationality that internally affects every code and every system of thinking from the outset. lf, for example, artists are asked why they chose precisely this rule ofvariation and not another, they can explain it either by falling back once again on their own contingent, subjective, creative decisions or by reference to a meta-system that determines the choice of the specific rule in each individual case. Such a reference to an ever-higher meta-level system, however, famously leads to insoluble logical paradoxes that in turn can be eliminated only by the contingent decision to limit the system.

[...] [ln'Systems Aesthetics'(1963),Jack Burnham] notes rhat,The scope of a systems aesthetic presumes that problems cannot be solved by a single technical solution, but must be attacked on a multilevelled, inferdisciplinary basis.'r (my emphasis) and it is here that the interaction between technologist and artist enters consideration. Architects, engineers and electronics technicians may all become involved in the production of a work [...1, widening the network of ideas and influences that go into the production, and making the production more of a process, though Burnham does suggest that the artist may actually assume some of these functions.  

Burnham recognized the role of the network of interacting individuals within a system and the functions of feedback and adaptation processes that go into developing an artwork using contemporary technologies, but he didn't explore the further consequences, which are that the interactions among those individuals are sequential, taking place over time, and that the relational ascendancies also vary over this time. ln more general terms, a system is a network of nodes having disparate relations which change over time, so that at one interval one node is a source and at another a different node becomes the source, giving rise to opportunities for feedback relations to have a range of impacts both within the ma[<ing of an artwork and within the greater society.  

To a certain extent Burnham's analysis is incomplete because it fails to account for the potentially reciprocal interaction between the artist and the technologist. While his concern was with the role of cybernetics in the making of responsive artworl<s, the general thesis here is that this cybernetic activity is also what takes place between individuals, and between individuals and their institutions, in the processes of collaboration. It is this wider class of cybernetic coupling that provides the basis for my view of the relations between artists and their technical support and reciprocally the role of the artist in industrial and scientific institutions, with or without a collaboration in place. The technology mal<es available and the user makes demands, each feeding the other in reciprocity. There is a continual process offeedbacl<s (a conversation, so to speak) between the demands of the user - artist or scientist - and the engineer, the technologist. It goes something like this. Within some context the engineer develops the existing capabilities of a technology. These capabilities may stimulate the artist to utilize that technology for some process which suits their context and intentions, but the technology will be, almost necessarily, inadequate to the artist's intentions. It is here that the potential for collaboration appears. Even if it does not actually produce a collaboration, the needs of the artist can stimulate an engineer to extend the technology in some way thus extending the possibilities of its use, and thereby extending the range of the works that the artist might produce with that technology. Thus technology and art can co-evolve in a configuration of mutual interdependence driven by the feedback each supplies to the other, which is a cybernetic process, whether there is an active collaboration taking place or not.  

While Burnham points to the value of collaboration (if only to l<eep the artwork running) and that it is a cybernetic system showing feedback distributed interaction, his model remains incomplete in that it doesn't elucidate the process by which collaboration evolves as a problem-solving mechanism. In order to reach towards this necessaly extra layer in the interactions that constitute collaboration it will be useful to introduce Deleuze and Guattari's 'machinic phylum', through which they provide us with a view of the dynamics or the motive forces in the cybernetic system.  

In their 'Balance Sheet Program for Desiring-Machines'2 they consider our whole social process under the general rubric of the 'desiring machine' as an aspect of their 'machinic phylum'. They invoke a cyclical interaction mechanism that is cybernetic and of a greater spread of function within society. (And what follows is my extractive/interpolative reading of their article.) The machinic phylum must take hold of a tool so that  

[Tlre person] and the tool become or already cre distinct components of a machine relation to effectively engineering agency (une instance effectivernent mochinisante). And we believe moreover that there are always machines that precede tools, always phyla that determine at a given moment which tools, which Ipeople] will enter as machine components in the social system being considered.,l lhe machinic phylum is seen not as the tools and machines that we use but as a tl.ynamic network of technologies and people, a social machine that functions at that higher (societal) level. lt is an organization offunctional nodes (people and i'stitutions) in a social, collective networl< wherein the flow ol energy and irrlormation produces the organization of the machine (system) and drives its cvolution. This social machine fut'tctions through communication and interaction, iI is recurrent (i.e. a feedback circuit), utilizing'the probability of a less-probable' produces order or new states of lower entropy, which is a definition of information); not'acting through the functional synthesis of a whole'but real distinctions in an ensemble' (as through the production of information by the system). In many ways it represents the linkages between people that make up a society. The motivational forces that flow th'ough these linkages, producing the dynamics of the system, are the forces that Deleuze and Cuattari gather under the rubric of ,desire'. [...]  

Artists could almost be thought of as paradigmatic desiring-machines but for the fact that the desiring-machine exists at the more interactive social rather than individuaI level. Artists are often particularly difficult to pin down, artistic creativity being different from the more directed activity of the engineer. As Deleuze and cuattari note: 'What defines desiring machines is precisely their capacity for an unlimited number of connections, in every sense and in all directions.'a  

They are or become rhizomatic, proliferating in the world as sequentialry coupled interactiolrs having impacts, in varied ways, on themselves and on each as systems in process with other surrounding systems. The desiring machine is the ensemble of individuals and'fixed'entities (tools and machines iu our usual way of speaking) the components of a constantry infer-looping collection of relations among components driven by our interests and desires a nd the tools' offerings. [.. . ] Desi re, generosity, multiple idiosyncratic behaviours drive the process, draw things in - building the desiring machine. Components rrutate, producing a radical break as inventions. New approaches and discoveries euergize the phylum. These breal<s are step-functions in its processes (in its local and evolutionary time scales) and it shows a punctuated evolution - flowbreak-flow. lt self-organizes (as autopoeisis) as'a collective fuil body, the engineering agency on which the machine installs its connections and ef1'ects its rlrptures'.s rhus the collaborative process can be seen as this ,machine, in itselt, a machine that functions through multi-layered feedback processes operating between the individuals who are the 'nodes' in the 'network' that is the organization of the machine. [. . . ]  

Within the machine we are engaged in construction - we are engaged with the world in the process of its and our construction. To draw the process apart into components is ultimately to mislead, because it is the one process of these components tightly coupled that is the world and our becoming in it. [...]  

The system of a collaboration in process entails layers of interaction and feedback and they are the object of interest here. It is the cybernetic processes in which the interactions within this structurally coupled system consist that bring forth its evolution. The concept of interaction that I am invoking here, in which the internal processes of the system (artist $^+$ technologist $^+$ the devices they produce and use) act to produce and reproduce its components, setting up a sustained existence for those components in the face of environmental perturbation, leads one to the concept ofAutopoiesis. [...]  

IM]any o[ the characteristics of autopoiesis assist greatly in understanding the development of the 'components' (the term has a particular technical function) that would be operating in the social environments which produce the types of artefacts that, for example, make up the art and technology tool set. [...1  

Two or more autopoietic systems, say an artist and a technologist, each of which acts as a medium for the other, become mutually structurally coupled through the history of their reciprocal interactions. Events ('conducts', behaviours) in one system'triggering perturbations' in another system bring the systems into an interlocking of interactions which is indistinguishable from what we call a 'consensual domain'. '[A] consensual domain is closed with respect to the interlocking conducts that constitute it, but is open with respect to the organisms or systems that realize it.'6 It is this'interlocked, mutually selecting, mutually triggering domain of state trajectories'7 that is a collaboration, and I would consider that it is, in itself, an autopoiesis. [...]  

We can think of collaboration in this way: the creation of a device or an artwork through a spiralling evolution brought about by the interactions of collaborators within an integrated system of feedforwards (being suggestions or enquiries), feedbacks (being responses) and adaptations. For those outside the collaboration, it would be seen as a self- generating autopoietic process. [...]  

The individuals involved should be seen as discrete autopoieses that engage in feedback processes which bring a potential integration of the interests, intentions and skills of the individuals into what is a 'desiring machine' or system. The particular desiring machine is driven by the needs, desires, intentions and imaginations of the individual autopoietic entities within it. As a system it will, in the whole, be autopoietic, operating in a substratum of the consensual clorrain that we understand to be a society, and, in its construction as a jointly .rgleed project, becomes, in itself, a more narrowly determined consensual clomain which is, thus, the collaboration.

To obtaln a new operative basis it was necessary to systematize the media so that they could form logical sequences and would permit a multiplicity of operations. The result: variability and extensibility.  

The colour series provides the law for formal expression, colour and form cancel each other out as opposites.  

Anonymity of the media, non-limitation of the structural laws, relativity of the dimensions, extensibility and flexibility determine the expression.  

The machine and the expression are developed at the same time, the method represents itself, it is the picture.  

The picture field is a structural field.  

The prerequisites for the development of flexible ordering systen-rs are the identity of the pictorial media, of surlace and surface boundaries, the anonymization and objectification of the structure, the congruence of the beginning and the end ofthe action.  

The anonymous element is part and substance of a system of coordinates in which each element has an equal share of passivity and activity.  

The individual expression lies in the choice of methods, in the control of preliminary conditions.  

Simplicity is notproduced by spontaneity but by the multiple superimposition, interpenetration and modification of the processes of development.  

There is no definition of aesthetics without the definition of its social basis.  

The tasl< consists in developing systems that make transparent and combinable, flexible orders possible.  

Technological reality is a fact that cannot be ignored. Identical with it is a vocabulary of media that is characteristic of this epoch, an instrumentarium of methods, systems, modes of behaviour, an arsenal of forms of expression that have already shaped the life of the epoch and will continue to shape it.  

A social basis corresponds to every cultural expression, a cosmology to every aesthetic. In no other form of art do the media and methods of a global technological strategy find a legitimate expression as they do in constructive, logical, systematic or serial art, which is a sublimated and critical echo of the structures of civilization.  

The forms of expression of a non-hierarchical society correspond to this society ln the sphere of visual art: they are flexible, transparent, verifiable in method and in result.  

It is as an instrument of cognition that art has a social value  

Every technology has an appropriate sign alphabet that differs from its lbrerunner in structure, dimensions and motion. Forms of expression in art correspond to this global structufe.  

Flexibility is the counter-principle to monumentality.  

No other epoch has experienced this onset ofstraight lines, direct connections, .rccumulations of identical elements resulting from the addition and division of the identical.  

The possibility of repeating elements and facts mechanically is one of the identifying marks of this epoch.  

Geometric artforms have a range extending from the esoteric to democratic oldets.  

There is no such thing as the language of geometry.  

The serial principle is a radical democratic principle.

# Iqnnis Xenqkis Free Stochqstic Music/ / 1965  

Art, and above all, music has a fundamental function, which is to catalyse the sLrblination that it can bring about through all means of expression. lt must ainr llrlough fixations which are landmarks to draw towards a total exaltation in which the individual mingles, losing his consciousness in a truth immediate, r.ue, enormous and perfect. If a worl< of art succeeds in this undertaking even lirr .r single moment, it attains its goal. This tremendous truth is not made of olljects, emotions or sensations; lt is beyond these, as Beethoven's Seventh Syrnphony is beyond music. This is why art can lead to realms that religion still rrccupies for some people.  

But this transmutation of everyday artistic material which transforms trivial prrrrlucts into meta-art is a secret. The 'possessed' reach it without knowing its 'rrrcclranisms'. The others struggle in the ideological and technical mainstream of their epoch which constitutes the perishable'climate'and the stylistic fashion. l(ccping our eyes fixed on this supreme meta-artistic goal, we shall attempt to define in a more modest manner the paths which can lead to it from our point of departure, which is the magma of contradictions in present music.  

There exists a historical parallel between European music and the successive attempts to explain the world by reason. The music of antiquity, causal and deterministic, was already strongly influenced by the schools ofPythagoras and Plato. Plato insisted on the principle of, causality, 'for it is impossible for anything to come into being without cause' (fimceus). Strict causality lasted until the nineteenth century when it underwent a brutal and fertile translormation as a result of statistical theories in physics. Since antiquity the concepts of chance (tyche), disorder (ataxia), and disorganization were considered as the opposite and negation of reason (logos), order (fcxis), and organization (sysfcsis). It is only recently that knowledge has been able to penetrate chance and has discovered how to separate its degrees - in other words to rationalize it progressively, without, however, succeeding in a definitive and total explanation of the problem of 'pure chance'.  

After a time lag of several decades, atonal music broke up the tonal function and opened up a new path parallel to that of the physical sciences, but at the same time constricted by the virtually absolute determinism of serial music.  

It is therelore not surprising that the presence or absence of the principle of car,rsality, first in philosophy and then in the sciences, might influence musical composition. It caused it to follow paths that appeared to be divergent, but which, in fact, coalesced in probability theory and finally in polyvalent logic, which are l<inds of generalization and enrichments of the principle of causality. The explanation of the world, and consequently of the sonic phenomena which surround us or which may be created, necessitated and profited lrom the enlargement of the principle of causality, the basis of which enlargement is lormed by the law of large numbers. This law implies an asymptotic evolution towards a stable state, towards a kind of goal, ol stcch cs, whence comes the adjective'stochastic'.  

But everything in pure determinism or in less pure indeterminism is subjected to the fundamental operational laws of logic, which were disentangled by mathematical thought under the title of general algebra. These laws operate on isolated states or on sets of elements with the aid of operations, the most primitive of which are the union, notated U, the intersection, notated n, and the negation. Equivalence, implication and quantifications are elementary relations from which all current science can be constructed.  

Music, then, may be defined as an organization o[ these elementary operations and relations between sonic entities or between functions of sonic entities. We understand the first-rate position which is occupied by set theory, not only for the construction of new works, but also for analysis and better corlprehension of the works oIthe past. ln the same way a stochastic construction ol an investigation of history with the help of stochastics cannot be carried lhr-ough without the help of logic - the queen of the sciences, and I would even vcuture to suggest, of the arts - or its mathematical form algebra. For everything that is said here on the subject is also valid for all forms of art (painting, sculpture, .rlchitecture, films, etc.). [...]  

[My article'The Crisis of Serial Music'(1954)] served as a bridge to my iutroduction of mathematics in music. For if, thanks to complexity, the strict, cleterministic causality which the neo-serialists postulated was lost, then it was necessary to replace it by a more general causality, by a probabilistic logic which would contain strict serial causality as a particular case. This is the function of stochastic science. 'Stochastics' studies and formulates the Iaw of large numbers, which has already been mentioned, the laws of rare events, the different aleatory ;trocedures, etc. As a result of the impasse in serial music, as well as other causes, I originated in 1954 a music constructed from the principle of indeterminism; two years later I named it 'Stochastic Music'. The laws of the calculus of probabilities entered composition through musical necessity.  

But other paths also led to the same stochastic crossroads - first of all, natural events such as the collision ol hail or rain with hard surfaces, or the song of cicadas in a summer field. These sonic events are made out of thousands of isolated sounds; this multitude of sounds, seen as a totality, is a new sonic event. This mass event is articulated and forms a plastic mould of time, which itself,follows aleatory and stochastic laws. If one then wishes to form a large mass of point-notes, such as slringpizzicati, one must know these mathematical laws, which, in any case, are no more than a tight and concise expression ofa chain oflogical reasoning. Everyone has observed the sonic phenomena of a political crowd of dozens or hundreds of thousands of people. The human river shouts a slogan in a unilorm rhythm. Then another slogan springs from the head of the demonstration; it spreads towards the lail, replacing the first. A wave of transition thus passes from the head to the tail. The clamour fills the city, and the inhibiting force of voice and rhythm reaches a climax. It is an event of great power and beauty in its ferocity. Then the impact between the demonstrators and the enemy occurs. The perlect rhythm of the last slogan breal<s up in a huge cluster of chaotic shouts, which also spreads to the tail. lrnagine, in addition, the reports o[ dozens of machine guns and the whistle of bullets adding their punctuations to this total disorder. The crowd is then rapidly dispersed, and after sonic and visual hell lollows a detonating calm, full of despair, clust and death. The statistical laws of these events, separated from their political or moral context, are the same as those of the cicadas or the rain. They are the laws ofthe passage from complete order to total disorder in a continuous or explosive lranner. They are stochastic laws.  

Here we touch on one of the great problems that have haunted human intelligence since antiquity: continuous or discontinuous transformation. The sophisms of movement (e.g. Achilles and the tortoise) or of definition (e.g. baldness), especially the latter, are solved by statistical definition; that is to say, by stochastics. One may produce continuity with either continuous or discontinuous elements. A multitude of short glissandi on strings can give the impression of continuity, and so can a multitude of pizzicati. Passages lrom a discontir.ruous state to a continuous state are controllable with the aid of probability theory. For some time now I have been conducting these fascinating experiments in instrumental works; but the mathematical character of this music has frightened musicians and has made the approach especially difficult.  

Here is another direction that converges on indeterminism. The study of the variation of rhythm poses the problem of knowing what tlre limit of total asymmetry is, and of the consequent complete disruption of causality among durations. The sounds ola Geiger counter in the proximity of a radioactive source give an impressive idea of this. Stochastics provides the necessary laws.  

Before ending this short inspection tour of events rich in the new logic, which were closed to the understanding until recently, I would lil<e to include a short parenthesis. Il glissandi are long and sufficiently interlaced, we obtain sonic spaces of continuous evolution. It is possible to produce ruled surfaces by drawing the glissandi as straight lines. I performed this experiment with Metastasis (this work had its premiere in 1955 at Donaueschingen). Several years later, when the architect Le Corbusier, whose collaborator I was, asked me to suggest a design for the architecture of the Philips Pavilion in Brussels, my inspiration was pinpointed by the experiment with Metastasis. Thus I believe that on this occasion music and architecture found an intimate connection. [...]  

In line with Istochastic ideas], Michel Philippot introduced the calculus of probabilities into his painting several years ago, thus opening new directions for investigation in this artistic realm. In music he recently endeavoured to analyse the act of composition in the form of a flow chart for an imaginary machine. It is a fundamental analysis o[ voluntary choice, which leads to a chain of aleatory or deterministic events, and is based on the work Composition pour double orchesffe (1960). The term imaginary machine means that the composer may rigorously define the entities and operating methods, just as on an electronic computer. In 1960 Plrilippot commented on his Compositionpour double orchestre:  

If, in connection with this work, I happened to use the term'experimental music', I should specify in what sense it was meant in this particular case. It has nothing to do with concrete or electronic music, but with a very banal score written on the usual ruled paper and requiring none but the most traditional orchestral rrstrllrnents. However, the experiment of which this composition was in some \('nsc a by-product does exist (and one can think of many industries that survive only Ihrough the exploitation of their by-products).  

l he end sought was merely to effect, in the context of a work which I would have written independent of all experimental ambitions, an exploration of the l)rocesses followed by my own cerebral mechanjsm as it arranged the sonic clcrlents. I therefore devised the following steps:  

I M.rl<e the most complete inventory possible of the set of my gestures, ideas, rrr.rrrrrerisms, decisions and choices, etc., which were mine when lwrote the music. .2. llcclr,rce this set to a succession of simple decisions, binary if possible; i.e. accept or refuse a particular note, duration or silence in a situation determined and tlt'fined by the context on one hand, and by the conditioning to which I had been srrb.jected and my personal tastes on the other.   
$3.$ [stablish, if possible, from this sequence of simple decisions, a scheme ordered ,rt cording to the lollowing two considerations (which were sometimes ( or)tr.ldictory): the manner in which these decisions emerged from my rrnagination in the course of the work, and the manner in which they would have lo clnerge in order to be most useful.   
4. I)resent this scheme in the form ofa flow chart containing the logical chain of t lrt'se decisions, the operation of which could easily be controlled.   
$^{\dag}\rangle_{-}$ Sct in motion a mechanism of simulation respecting the rules of the game in the llow chart and note the result.   
(;. Colrpare this result with my musical intentions.   
$/_{\cdot}$ Check the differences between result and intentions, detect their causes, and ( ( )r rect the operating rules.   
$8.$ ltcfer these corrections back to the sequence of experimental phases, i.e. start ,r1i,rin at l. until a satislactory result has been obtained.  

ll we conflne ourselves to the most general considerations, it would simply be a rrr,rtter of proceeding to an analysis of the complexity, considered as an ,rt t urrulation, in a certain order, of single events, and then of reconstructing this r orrrplexity, at the same time verifying the nature of the elements and their rules ol t rrmbination. [...]  

I lrus appeared the phenomenon, a rather banal one, of autogeneration of r ornplexity by juxtaposition and combination of a large number of single events ,rnrl o;terations.  

$\Lambda!$ the end of this experiment I possessed at most some insight into my own r r r rs ic.r l tastes, but to me, the obviously interesting aspect of it (as long as there is no ('r'ror of omission ! ) was the analysis of the composer, his mental processes, and ,r ( (,rtrin liberation of the imagination.  

The biggest difficulty encountered was that ofa conscious and voluntary split in personality. On one hand was the composer who already had a clear idea and a precise audition of the work he wished to obtain, and on the other was the experimenter who had to maintain a lucidity which rapidly became burdensome in these conditions - a lucidity with respect to his own gestures and decisions. We must not ignore the fact that such experiments must be examined with the greatest prudence, lor everyone knows that no observation of a phenomenon exists which does not disturb that phenomenon, and I fear that the resulting disturbance might be particularly strong when it concerns such an ill-defined domain and such a delicate activity.  

Moreover, in this particular case, I fear that observation might provol<e its own disturbance. lf I accepted this risk, I did not underestimate its extent. At most, my ambltion confined itself to the attempt to project on a marvellous unknown, that of aesthetic creation, the timid light of a dark lantern.

# Phivos-Angelos Kollias Icrnnis Xenqkis ond Systems Thinking//2Oll  

[...] Mathematical thinking in musical composition relers to the abstraction of sound elements, their quantification and the formalization of their relationships. That is to say, it is the rationalization o[ sound's control. Although the use of mathematics as a composltional tool does not necessarily suggest aesthetic values, or particular modes of perception, the application of stochastics [procedures based on random variables and probability], via a cybernetic epistemology, opens up a new field of musical creation and experience.[...1  

As Francisco Valera suggests, one of the basic aims of cybernetics was the attempt to organize a science of the mind. llnvitation aux sciences cognitives, 19961 From this perspective, what had previously been monopolized by philosophers and psychologists became a subject of study for interdisciplinary teams, who would search for the underlying processes of the mind and describe them in terms of explicit mechanisms and mathematical formalizations.  

This may help explain the reason for Xenakis' interest in systems thinking. As clescribed by Makis Solomos, in Xenakian aesthetics, which has a clearly antiromantic attitude, the focus is no longer on the 'heart' but the 'brain'; no longer orr sentiment but the sensory. ['Les "op6rations mentales de la composition"', Intellecta (2008)l For Xenakis logic, rather than beauty, now rules the arts.  

Another reason is that for Xenakis art was not a matter of,cultivated minds - an attitude that led away from humanity's biological foundations and would result, as Ire put it, in a'sterile desert'. lnstead, he extends the sensorial aspect of music so as to form a direct connection between human biological nature and intelligence.  

A third reason is Xenakis'tendency towards universality. He envisages a new l<ind of musician, who possesses 'a sort of universality, but one based upon, guided by and oriented toward forms and architectures',r and who is conversant with mathematics, logic, physics, chemistry, biology, genetics, palaeontology, the human sciences, history. [...1  

Another important aspect of systemic thought, also connected with universality, is the concept of isomorphism. According to Ludwig von Bertalanffy, 'lhe consequence o[the existence ofgeneral system properties is the appearance of structural similarities or isomorphisms in different fields. There are correspondences in the principles that govern the behaviour of entities that are intrinsically widely different.' lGeneral Sysrems Theory, 19681  

Similarly, Xenakis states that'any theory or solution given to one level can be assigned to the solution of problems on another level. ... IQ]uestions having to do mainly with orchestral sounds ... find a rich and immediate application as soon as they are transferred to the microsound level ... All music is thus automatically homogenized and unified.' [... 1  

At the base of Ithe psychologist and cyberneticianl Ross Ashby's interpretation ol cybernetics is the concept of difference:  

1. The difference between two discernible things. 2.The difference between one thingand its change to another. lAnlntroduction o Cybernetics, 19561 [...1  

Xenakis describes what he calls Markovian stochastic music, starting with a basic hypothesis: All sound is an integration of grains, of elementary sonic particles, of sonic quanta. Each of these elementary grains has a threefold nature: duration, frequency and intensity,' He explains his hypothesis with a metaphor: 'A complex sound can be imagined as a multicoloured firework, in which each point of light appears and instantaneously disappears against a black sky.' ln older to model any complex sound (viewing Xenakis' hypothesis from a cybernetic perspective), the only three parameters that interest us are duration, lrequency and intensity. [...]  

ln order to describe sound in finite steps, Xenakis takes chunks of time of unchanging length, so as to simplify the model and keep only two changing parameters. ln this way, in every instance, the state of a grain [of sound] can be described by a vector (l g) where the mapping (the correspondence) between the lrequencies and the intensities can be single-valued or many-valued. That is to say, in the former case a frequency may correspond to only one intensity, while in the latter case a frequency may correspond to many possible intensities. [...]  

As Ashby does in his cybernetics, Xenakis first describes determinate transformations and later introduces stochastic ones. A determinate transformation is closed: all the elements of the transformation are predefined; and it is singlevalued: each operant is converted to one, and only one, transform.[...] Xenakis also suggests another use of cybernetic representation, where the elements of the transformation may represent, instead of screens, other musical elements: notes, rhythmic values, textural qualities, timbres or'concrete music characters'. [...]  

Interpreting Xenakis' music through systems thinking, we can more profoundly understand his methodologies and resulting aesthetic values. This can inlorm us more about his music than a simple approach through mathematical formulae. Furthermore, a knowledge of the evolution of these theories can contribute to new applications in music.

Accepting that creative work is an algorithm which represents a human behaviour in a given situation, it is natural to ask: how is such an algorithm built up, and which precise mathematical laws could be extracted for later use in different circumstances? lf one is now curious enough to look for his own aesthetic parameters, he is ready to engage in an interesting line of research. These considerations led me to use the computer as a PARTNER in my work.  

The first step was an extended analysis of my own paintings and drawings from the last ten years. It resulted in a surprisingly large amount of regularities, determined of course by my particular aesthetic sense, through which I was able to establish a number of basic elements that amounted to a rudimentary syntax. After representing these basic constructions through a mathematical formalism, and setting them up in an abstract combinatorial framework, I was in a position to realize all possible representations of my algorithms.  

since the most important point in applying a computer to solve aesthetic problems is the MATERIALGERECHTET use of this instrument, the research therelore should assume that old techniques of drawing and imagination are not to be imposed on the machine (although this would be possible), but should develop a priori a vocabulary which integrates the computer into the .resthetic system.  

Computer graphics in general are conditioned by four basic premises:  

1. A PRECISE idea of an aesthetic problem.   
2. The need to break this idea into parts which could be reassembled as a l)fogfam.   
3. A steady control of the computing process to take full advantage of the MACHINE - HUMAN dialogue.   
4. The need for the logic of the events to become perceptible.  

The logic built into a program mal<es it possible to create a nearly infinite rrr-rmber of new situations. This is very important since the creatior-r of a form is limited a priori by its author's characteristics, of which he may be conscious or runconscious. lt means that the exploration of a new idea leads sooner or later to .r repetition which can be avoided by resorting to a computer once the basic l)arameters have been formulated. As it is possible to conceive the logic of a construction but not all its consequences, it is nearly an imperative to rely on a computer to show this large variety of possibilities; a procedure which may lead to different and perhaps more interesting answers, lying of course outside of rrormal behaviour but not outside of the imposed logic.  

At this point a new problem appears: how to choose what is to be kept and wl.rat is to be rejected?  

My aesthetic criteria were determined by a decision not to create single lbrrrs but sets of forms. The basic parameters are the relationships between the lirrms, and no aesthetic value is associated to particular forms. within this t'ontext it is possible to ignore the former'good'and'bad', and aesthetic decisions c.rn be based on wERTFREIE2 procedures, where the totality represents a'quality ol-a quantity'. The fundamental consequence of this attitude is, that alter a period ol tests, modifications of the logic and parameter exchanges, all possible results ol.r program have to be rigorously accepted as final answers.  

computer graphics is a young and new way of aesthetic communication; it integrates human thinking, mechanical handling, logic, new possibilities o[ drawing and incorruptible precision of drawing - a new DUICUST  

The concentration which is necessary to establish a logic (writing a program - that means to give a definition of all instructions that have to be done in the machine) will reflect itself in the result as a clear construction whicl-r could be understood by everybody, and there will be less and less mystical barriers behind which the artist can hide himself.

The 1960s were tumultuous years in Chicago. There was enough charged negative and positive energy in the air to move the most inert of us to creative activity. It was in this climate that a new program, Generative Systems, was born at the School of the Art lnstitute of Chicago. 1...1 lAlt first we taught extensions of traditional art processes, but later we developed a full program of investigation into the transformative process occurring in art as a result ofthe impact of the communications revolution on the society at large. Cenerative Systems was a research centre; a resource and energy bank; a self-generating centre where communication tools came and went while people remained; a nurturing ground for the Electronic Printout Systems (ESP); an extension into the luture of photography, drawing, textiles, and so on; a time machine from instant real-time back to mechanical time; an attitude; an interactive force between industry, education and the public; and finally a viable alternative to the present art education system.  

Although Generative Systems courses were formally begun in the 1970s, they were rooted in my worl< at the Institute in the 1960s when I taught [. .. ] the basic art school foundation courses. They were influenced for the most part by Bauhaus teachings. [...] [H]owever, my main educational resource was the lririlrly pictorial journal Scientific Americqn.lt was not until I worked with high''lrct'rl cornmunications tools that Moholy-Nagy's Vision in Motion (1947) took rrrr ,r re.rl significance for me. The new communication imaging systems validated I rrs pclceptions. [... I  

lirr'.r decade, from 1967 to 7977, we were occupied with exploring many r rrrnr.r.runications systems [...1. The communications technology that emerged in tlrt' 1960s validated the dreams of the most imaginative minds. Objects could be '.trt'lched in time, layered in time, scanned in time, filtered in time, nrt't.rr.r.rorphosed and synchronized in time, in a matter of seconds, on the new clt't tlonic copiers, telecopiers and computers, with their moving lights, lenses, tlrt'r'nr.rl and/or steel rollers and electronic gates.  

l)Lrlirrg and 1970 I created a body of work with copiers and their byprorlucts that led to my becoming artist-in-residence at 3M's Color Research I ,rlror.rtory with Douglas Dybvig, laboratory director and inventor of 3M's Colorrrr photocopying machine. This gave me tlre foundation needed to r'.,t.rblish the first Generative Systems course in 1970 [...]. Then in the two r'n\uiug years Generative Systems became an energy bank, tele-link-up, lxt h.rnge centre, city nerve centre, public relations centre and interdepartmental lrrrl< u;r providing events, activities and performances. By the seventh year, the ( ollrscs called Process I and Process ll were created. This was partly as a result ul rrrv renewed exposure to scientists in 1976 as an artist-in-residence at 3M's ( r'ntr'.rl Research Laboratories [...].  

l'rocess I [...] examin[ed] energy for imaging manually, mechanically, ,'llt tronically and photonically. Process Il gave the student an opportunity to pull ,rp,rrl .'rnd examine dozens of communication machines, such as high-speed r rrpit'r's, video recorders and computers. One of the teaching assistants was Greg t,rrrrtll.rch, who in the process began research for a three-dimensional ;rlrrrto.qr.rphic system that he would after gladuation patent as Z-Tranz.  

( onrputer Graphics was finally made into a course in the late 1970s, when I olrt,rinccl a 4l( Radio Shack computer with a thermal silver paper printer. In a few rrrrrrrllrs .t Z-80 computer was assembled from a kit by a graduate student tr',rt lrirrg.rssistant,John Dunn, who in the process was setting the basis lor the lr ',1 ( onrpLrter graphic system for artists, his SLIDEMASTER, which became EASEL .rrrrl lhcn Lumena (Time Arts Inc.). [...]  

I S lince the main emphasis of both courses was not on making 'Art', another murs('scerred necessary. It was not until the end of the 1970s, however, that we wr,rc lc.rcly for a course that would permit all aspects of the artistic process to lrrrrt tiorr as a unity. [...]  

I lrt' course called Homography was created for just this purpose - to decide wlr,rt to clo with our new-found knowledge. [We used] tools from a whole spectrum of eras: the pen, pencil and brush; the camera; the copier and video recorder and computer [...] to create problems that did not yet exist [...], to explore the conceptual, artistic and scientific implications of the area. By the end of the semester I had created nine new lessons, nine ways of visualizing time through the use of manual, mechanical, electronic and photonic tools. George I(ubler's The Shape of Time (1962) and Moholy-Nagy's Vision in Motion were being realized not merely in film, video and sound, which were by nature time studies, but also in what are normally considered 'still arts': drawing, painting, printmaking and photography.  

Moving-time and stopped-time imaging systems are interchangeable, but it was not until the availability of electronic photo/print processes in the 1960s that images, not merely of our imagination, could be stopped in time by simple accessible systems. Photographers knew of Harold Edgerton's pioneering work in stopped-time images, but fields outside photography, film, video and sound did not deal with multiple dimensions. [...]  

Process I and Il provided the minimal experience with technology needed to pursue the development of Generative Systems. Homography was the course designed to permit two aspects of the creative process - personal/inner and objective/outer - to function as a unity. lt was a search for the poetry of the process. lt was an attempt to find the aesthetics and meaning underlying the shift from tools of one l<ind of time to tools of another kind of time. This was a complex process, and in my own case, since I was learning along with the students, it could be achieved only through the total integration of my own wor[< and production with tlrat of the classroom needs.  

I have had many challenging discussions with splendid artist/educators who found my system to be dangerous, to say the least. My choice for this integrative process can best be explained by recognizing tlrat my context, in Chicago at the time, seemed to demand a democratic, decentralized program with the support of people in industry, artists, those in educational institutions and a host of other people. My personal philosophy and my desire to integrate a first-generation creative process into art production and training, in synchronization with social and technological development, led me to no other conclusion. I could find no other acceptable alternative for the Chicago art school context. The time and place seemed to demand a fluid, non-dictatorial context. Yet the program had to be based on solid, objective discovery rooted in a knowledge ofart history and scientific/artistic discovery. [... ]  

In retrospect, some aspects of the program that are applicable to other quite different educational approaches appear to be the following:  

1. In studying nature's processes, we discover basic common underlying unities, structures and patterns. Not only is the river delta a 'new landscape', it is .r cleudlitic pattern in our hands, in a heat-pressured copier sheet, in the positive rh.rrge ofXerox electrostatic toner on a selenium plate, or in the pressure ofa lirot in the mud. If one moves one's foot in a flow pattern one creates a wave; if {)nc n-lns a hot iron over dye-coated copier paper one creates again a wave form.  

2. Artists can work with scientists to study nature's processes as well as its   
ploclucts. The underlying stl'uctures of systems can be explored by both artist   
.rnrl scientist separately or in tandem. 3. Artists can use mind, senses and hand to examine and explore energy   
\ources to enhance their awareness. Light, heat, magnetics, electrostatics and   
sourrcl fransmission can be playfully and systematically explored, even by using   
t hilclren's science books, manually, mechanically, electronically, photonically   
,rn<l biologically. 4. Our perceptions of time and space are altered as we change our tools from   
rn.rr.ru.rl to electrostatic to photonic and biologic or any combination of these. We   
r,rrr ride in time through past, present and future via our choice of tools. 5. Stopped-time and moving-time systems, when playfully and systematically   
,'xplored, can reveal new ways of perceiving ourselves in time and space. We ride   
irr sp.rce/time through our choice of system. (;. Ways of visualizing time can be studied subjectively/objectively, inwardly/   
( r rtw.rrdly, as was colour by Johannes Itten linThe Art of Colour, f 961 l. [...1 7. Artists can create their own sophisticated tools and thus affect society; or   
tlrt'y can separately or simultaneously pick up tools discarded by the society for   
r r t'at ive experimentation. u. No tools are too outmoded lor creative use. No tools are too new for creative   
rrsr,. An artist can create with any tools, but certain tools are linked to the dynamics   
r rl soci.rl and technological development and open up vistas in a special way. 1). Complex systems can be invented even by young students. One key is to   
rlirt'tt the student to lool< at the mirror image of a problem such as three  
rlrnrt'nsional photo-imaging with the grid on the camera rather than on the   
r r'( ('l)tol'. 10.'lhere need not be artist/technicians who only create tools or operate   
tlrt'rrr while others, artists proper, create art with these tools. Timing, need and   
lrrrnr.rlr preference and adaptability create a wide range of choices in a single   
lrlr,lirrrc. Specialization is for researchers and robots. I I Networks of individuals can build an energy bank, and with it creative   
r,rr itt,rncrrt, even in static academic environments. 12. Arr artist/educator who openly and freely provides a visible model of   
r r r'. rt irrg through teaching, exploration and I esearch can produce a body of artists   
r ,rp,rlrlc ol creating their own tools, or creating their own art centres, or inventing   
r lrr, rrt'xt stage of multidimensional visualization. The product does not disappear in the process. Process and product are two components of one system - the creative process.   
13. Artists can explore and record the processes of evolving, moving systems as well as of static ones.   
14. Generative Systems does not have to be only the closed system of its historical past. It can be an open/closed system or a mind/body system. [.. . ]  

The Generative Systems program at the Institute was not a closed system or a variation on a theme. It was an open system, an ever-changing system, in which the machines would come and go, but the humans would remain the constant factor. Courses would not be named for a specific and therelore static technological process [... ]butratherforadynamicprocess encompassingchange, metamorphosis, inconsistency and chaos. In the process, the mind/body of the human being could create closed systems and open systems, neither one negating the other, but, rather, each complementing the other in a process of continual becoming. [. . . ]  

The Cenerative Systems program was just one way, in one place and at one time, to tackle common problems of creativity in art, science and technology. Perhaps Generative Systems'ten-year existence in an institution was validated by its graduates, who invented new systems lor society, set up new learning centres, created new artforms and influenced yet another generation of artists.

A musical score is a statement about organization; it is a set of devices for organizing behaviour toward producing sounds. That this obseruation was not so evident in classical composition indicates that organization was not then an important focus of compositional attention. Instead, the organizational unit (be it the orchestra or the string quartet or the relationship of a man to a piano) remained fairly static for two centuries, while compositional attention was directed at using these given units to generate specific results by supplying them with specific instructions. [...]  

I shall be using the term variety frequently in this essay and I should like to .lttempt some definition of it now. It is a term taken from cybernetics (the science of organization) and it was originated by WR. Ashby.l The variety of a system is the total range ofits outputs, its total range ofbehaviour. All organic systems are probabilistic: they exhibit variety, and an organism's flexibility (its adaptability) is a function ofthe amount ofvariety that it can generate. Evolutionary adaptation is a result of the interaction of this probabilistic process with the demands of the cnvironment. By producing a rsnge of outputs evolution copes with a range of lrossible futures. The environment in this case is a variety-reducer because it 'selects'certain strains by allowing them to survive and reproduce, and filters out others. But, just as it is evident that an organism will (by its material nature) and rlust (for its survival)generate variety, it is also true that this variety must not be unlimited. That is to say, we require for successful evolution the transmission of rdentity as well as the transmission of muf ation. Or conversely, in a transmission of evolutionary information, what is important is not only that you get it right br.rt also that you get it slightly wrong, and that the deviations or mutations that ale useful can be encouraged and reinforced.  

My contention is that a primary focus of experimental music has been toward its own organization, and toward its own capacity to produce and control variety, .tnd to assimilate'natural variety'- the'interference value'of the environment. I:xperimental music, unlike classical (or avant-garde) music, does not typically oller instructions toward highly specific results, and hence does not normally specify wholly repeatable configurations of sound. It is this lack of interest in the precise nature of the piece that has led to the (l think) misleading description of this kind of music as indetermincfe. t hope to show that an experimental conposition aims to set in motion a system or organism that will generate rrnique (that is, not necessarily repeatable) outputs, but that, at the same time, seeks to limit the range of these outputs. This is a tendency toward a 'class of goals' rather than a particular goal, and it is distinct from the 'goalless behaviour' ( irrdeterminacy) idea that gained currency in the 1960s.  

I should like to deal at length with a particular piece of experimental music th.rt exemplifies this shift in orientation. The piece is Paragraph 7 of The Creat l,carning by Cornelius Cardew,2 and I have chosen this not only because it is a t'rlrrpendium of organizational techniques but also because it is available on r t'cord. [.. . ] Impticit in the score is the idea that it may be performed by cny group ol people (whether or not trained to sing). The version available on record is pcrformed by a mixed group of musicians and art students, and my experience of lhe piece is based on four perlormances of it in which I have taken part.  

Cardew's score is very simple. lt is written for any group of performers (it tkrcs not require trained singers). There is a piece of text (from Conlucius) which is clivided into24 separate short phrases, each of one to three words in length.  

Beside each phrase is a number, which specifies the number of repetitions for that line, and then another number telling you how many times that line should be sung loudly. The singing is mostly soft.  

All singers use exactly the same set of instructions. They are asked to sing each line of the text the given number of times, each time for the length of a breath, and on one note. The singers start together at a signal, and each singer chooses a note for the first line randomly, staying on it until the completion of the repetitions of the line.  

The singer then moves on to the next line, choosing a new note. The choice of this note is the important thing. The score says: 'Choose a note that you can hear being sung by a colleague. I[ there is no note, or only the note you have just been singing, or only notes that you are unable to sing, choose your note for the next line freely. Do not sing the same note on two consecutive lines. Each singer progresses through the text at his own speed.'  

A cursory examination of the score will probably create the impression that the piece would differ radically from one performance to another, because the score appears to supply very few precise (that is, quantifiable) constraints on the nature o[ each performer's behaviour, and because the performers themselves (being of variable abiliry) are not'reliable'in the sense that a group of trained musicians might be. The fact that this does not happen is of considerable interest, because it suggests that somehow o set of controls that are not stipulated in the score arise in performance and that these 'automatic' controls are the real determinants of the nature of the piece. [... ]  

In summary, then, the generation, distribution and control of notes within this piece are governed by the following: one specific instruction ('do not sing the same note on [vvo consecutive lines'), one general instruction ('sing any note that you can hear'), two physiological factors (tone-deafness and transposition), two physical factors (beat frequencies and resonant frequency), and the cultural factor of 'preference'. of course, there are other parameters of the piece (particularly amplitude) that are similarly controlled and submit to the same techniques of analysis, and rhe'breathing'aspects of the piece might well give rise to its most important characteristic - its meditative calm and tranquillity. But what I have mentioned above should be sufficient to indicate that something quite different from classical compositional technique is taking place: the composer, instead of ignoring or subduing the variety generated in performance, has constructed the piece so that this variety is really the substance of the music.  

Perhaps the most concise description of this kind of composition, which cheracterizes much experimental music, is offered in a statement made by the cybernetician stafford Beer. He writes: 'lnstead of trying to specify it in full detail, you specify it only somewhat. You then r ide on the dynamics of the system in the tlirection you want to go.'3 In the case of the Cardew piece, the 'dynamics of the svstem' is its interaction with the environmental, physiological and cultural tlinrate surrounding its performance. The English composer Michael Parsons plovides another view on this kind of composition:  

The idea of one and the same activity being done simultaneously by a number of people, so that everyone does it slightly differently,'unity'becoming'multiplicity', gives one a very economical form ol notation - it is only necessary to specify one procedure and the variety comes from the way everyone does it differently. This is an example of making use of 'hidden resources' in the sense of natural individual differences (rather than talents or abilities), which is completely neglected in classical concert music, though not in folk music.a  

lhis movement toward using natural variety as a compositional device is t'xcmplified in a piece by Michael Nyman called 1-100 (Obscure 6). In this piece, lirLrl pianists each play the same sequence of one hundred chords descending slowly down the keyboard. A player is instructed to move on to his next chord only when he can no longer hear his last. As this judgement is dependent on a rrrrrrber of variables (how loud the chord was played, how good the hearing of tlrc player is, what the piano is like, the point at which you decide that the chord is no longer audible), the flour players rapidly fall out of sync with one another. Wlr.rt happens after this is that unique and delicate clusters of up to four different t lrords are formed, or rapid sequences of chords are followed by long silences. I lris is an elegant use of the compositional technique that Parsons has specified, rrot least because it, like the Cardew piece, is extremely beautiful to listen to - a l,rctor that seems to carry little critical weight at present.

Civen Imyl reservation about polarizing musical ideas into opposing camps, I slrould now lil<e to describe two organizational structures. My point is not that t l.rssical music is one and contemporary music the other, but that each is a group oI hvbrids tending toward one of the two structures. At one extreme, then, is this typc of organization: a rigidly ranked, skill-oriented structure moving sequentially t lrr ough an environment assumed to be passive (static) toward a resolution already rlt'lined and specified. This type of organization regards the environment (and its v.rr icty) as a set of emergencies and seeks to neutralize or disregard this variety. An olrsclver is encouraged (both by his knowledge ofthe ranking system and by the tlillcling degrees offreedom accorded to the various parts ofthe organization) to rlircct his attention at the upper echelons of the ranks. He is given an impression oI .r lric'r.rrchy of value. The organization has the feel of a well-functioning machine: r I { )l)crates accurately and predictably for one class of tasks but it is not adaptive. lt rs rrot self-stabilizing and does not easily assimilate change or novel environmental conditions. Furthermore, it requires a particular type of instruction in order to operate. [n cybernetics this l<ind of instruction is known as analgorithm. Staf,ford Beer's definition of the term is 'a comprehensive set of instructions for reaching a known goal'; so the prescription 'turn left at the lights and walk twenty yards' is an algorithm, as is the prescription 'play a C-sharp for a quaver lollowed by an E for a semiquaver.' It must be evident that such specific strategies can be devised only when a precise concept of form (or identity, or goal, or direction) already exists, and when it is taken for granted that this concept is static and singular.  

Proposing an organizational structure opposite to the one described above is valueless because we would probably not accord it the name organization: whatever the term does connote, it must include some idea of constraint and some idea o[identity. So what I shall now describe is the type of organization that typifies certain organic systems and whose most important characteristics hinge on this fact: that changing environments require adaptive organisms. Now, the relationship between an organism and its environment is a sophisticated and complex one, and this is l-rot the place to deal with it. Suffice it to say, however, that an adaptive organism is one that contains built-in mechanisms [or monitoring (and adjusting) its own behaviour in relation to the alterations in its surroundings. This type of organism must be capable of operating from a different type of instruction, as the real coordinates of the surroundings are either too complex to speci[y, or are changing so unpredictably that no particular strategy (or specific plan for a particular future) is useful. The l<ind of instruction that is necessary here is known as an heurisfic, and is defined as 'a set of instructions for searching out an unknown goal by exploration, which continuously or repeatedly evaluates progress according to some known criterion.'6To use Beer's example: if you wish to tell someone how to reach the top of a mountain that is shrouded in mist, the heuristic'keep going up'will get him there. An organism operating in this way must have something more than a centralized control structure. It must have a responsive network oIsubsystems capable of autonomous behaviour, and it must regard the irregularities of the environment as a set of opportunities around which it will shape and adjust its own idenriry.

With the development of super computers by the late 1980s it was possible to urodel a System close to the order of complexity of natural systems, a new tcrr.itory for the art of observation.

During the six years of our collaboration, we have worked at the borderline of art and biology and have used biological principles to create interactive artworks. [...] ln 1992 we developed the concept of natural interfaces and evolutionary image processes linked to interaction. We started working with evolutionary biology and became increasingly intrigued by how natural evolution and the processes of nature can function as tools of creation. [...]  

Based on the insight that interaction per se and the interrelation between entities are the driving florces behind the structures of life, we investigated interaction and the creative process. Creation is no longer solely understood as an expression of the artist's inner creativity, but instead becomes an intrinsically dynamic process. Linking the interaction of human observers (visitors) directly to the dynamic and evolutionary image processes of an artwork allows us to create artworks that are under constant change and development.  

We believe that interaction should not be linear but instead feel like a journey. The more one engages in interaction, the more one learns about it and the more one can explore it. We call this principle non-linear or multi-layered interaction: interaction should be easy to understand at the very beginning but also rich so that the visitor is able continuously to discover different levels of interactive experiences. [... ]  

One of our first interactive computer installations to use a natural interface, instead of then common devices such as joysticks, mouse, trackers or other technical interfaces, was lnteractive Plant Growing (1993). In this piece, living plants function as the interface between the human visitor and the artwork. [...]  

[Wle became increasingly inquisitive about the process of creation itself. Artificial Life (A-Life), a research field invented by scientist Christopher Langton at the Santa Fe Institute, proved capable of producing processes of nature within a machine (computer environment) and allowed computer programs to evolve over time. This enabled the development of processes and patterns that are no longer predictable or'handmade'.  

Fascinated by the idea of creation through evolution, not as a scientific simulation or mimicry of nature but as an investigation into the creative process itsell we studied the possibilities of applying A-Life principles to art projects.  

Natural evcilution has brought about a vast variety of forms and structures in nature, so it seemed reasonable to us that artificial evolution could function as a mechanism of the visual creation process. Also inspired by John Cage's use of ch.rnce procedures in his musical compositions, we began to introduce a t <lntbination of interaction and artificial evolution to our works.  

ln 1994 we started to collaborate with Tom Ray, A-Life scientist and creator of thc ,Tierra' system. During this collaboration we developed the interactive cornputer installation A-volve, which allowed visitors to create A-Life the lirr.rr of artificial creatures) and to interact with it. Artificial creatufes are basically conlputer-generated forms that display life-like behaviour and interact with cach other as well as with their environment. A-Volve features A-Life principles irr the birth, creation, reproduction and evolution of its artificial creatures.  

ln an interactive real-time environment , A-VoIve visitors interact with virtual ct'eatures in a water-filled glass pool. These virtual creatures are products of cvolutionary rules and are influenced by humal creation and interaction' l)csigning any kind of shape and profile with hisi her finger on a touch-screen, t he visitor creates virtual 3-D creatures that are 'alive' and swim in the real water 0l the pool. The movement and behaviour of the virtual creature are decided by its form - that is, how the viewer deslgns it via the touch-screen' ["']  

Cross-over between the genetic strings olthe parent cteatures, as well as the rnutation and selection of fitter creatutes, provide a simulation of reproduction rnechanisms found in nature. Newborn olfspring also live in the pool, interacting with visitors and otber creatures.  

Laurent designed algorithms to ensure smooth and natural movements and '.rnirnal-like'behaviour of the creatures. None of the creatures are pre-designed' rhey are all born exclusively in real time through the interaction of the visitors .rncl the mating processes of the creatures themselves' ["'l  

since the genetic code of the offspring is carried fromgeneration to gcneration and the system emphasizes selection of fitter cteatules, the code is .rltle to evolve over time toward fitter creatures. Although evolution can take Pl.rce by itself without outside influence, the system is designed in such a way th.1t the visitor and his/her interaction and creation of forms will significantly inlluence the evolutionary process. The visitors act as a kind of external selection mechanism. [...1  

All of A-volve's entities - the images, the forms and the graphical environment change continuously, as does the audience itself, their imaginations, the ways lhcy conceive and draw forms and how they interact with them' Human-creatute itrtcraction itself becomes a creative plocess. The sociat interaction between the vicwers and the virtual world is essential to the creation of the work itself. we rhinl< of A-volve as a complex system in which, as in quantum physics, the entities Ir.rnsform their states according to probability patterns. This system is like an inlc'rconnected, intrinsically dynamic web of movement, interaction and tr.rnsformation of particles and entities' [...1  

In 1996 we began to study the building blocks of visual creation and investigated how simple structures can result in complex-looking shapes and forms through genetic manipulations. We developed GENMA (Genetic Manipulator) - an interactive installation that allows visitors to create, manipulate and explore the genetic design of artificial creatures - for the Ars Electronica Centre (AEC) in Linz, Austria, as part of a permanent exhibition.  

CENMA is a kind of dream machine enabling us to manipulate artificial nature on a micro scale: abstract, amoeboid, artificial 3-D forms and shapes. Principles of A-Life and genetic programming are implemented in this project, which altows visitors to manipulate the virtual genes of the creatures in real time. [. . . ]  

On a visual level, GENM,  further explores the concept of 'natural' or 'openended'design - design that is not pre-fixed or controlled by the artists but that represents the degree of interest and interaction of each visitor. Each visitor creates the forms he/she wants to see, aided by artificial genetics, mutation and manipulation. One could even say that the audience become artists themselves, using the power and possibilities of the installation's tools.  

In 1997 we extended the concept of CENMA a step further and implemented the principles of open-ended design in an installation called Life Spacies [...], an interaction and communication environment in which remotely located visitors via the lnternet and onsite visitors at the installation in Tokyo can interact with each other through evolutionary forms and images.  

Through the Life Spacies web page, people all over the world interact with the system as well. By simply typing and sending an e-mail message to the lfe Spacies website one can create one's own artificial creature.  

We developed a special text-to-form coding system that allows us to translate text into genetic code. In a way similar to what occurs in nature, letters, syntax and sequencing of the text are used to code certain parameters in a creature's design. Form, shape, colour, texture and the number of limbs are influenced by text parameters. As there is great variation in the texts sent by different people, the creatures themselves also vary greatly in their appearance, thus resulting in unique creatures for each participant.  

As soon as the message is sent, the produced creature starts to live in the trle Spacies environment at the ICC museum, where on-site visitors can interact with it directly through touch. [...]  

The artificial species can be created in one of two different ways:  

Through incoming e-mail messages. A text-to-form editor creates the genetic code for each creature: one message equals one creature; complex text messages create complex creatures; and different levels of complexity within the text represent di fferent species.  

Through reproduction of the creatures themselves. Reproduction helps the creatures propagate their genotype in the system so they can form groups of different species.  

Life Spacies is also based on the idea ofevolutionary design - the result is not predetermined by the artist but depends solely on the interaction of the visitors and the evolutionary process. Only the messages e-mailed from people throughout the world and the reproduction and evolution of the creatures themselves determine how the creatures lool< and how they behave. One can therefore never really predict how the work will evolve and what l<ind of creatures will emerge. lts evolution depends on how many people send messages, how complex these messages are and how the creatures reproduce among themselves and through the selection of visitors at the museum.  

Life Spacies is a system where interaction, interrelation and exchange happens on human-human, human-creature, creature-creature, and human-environment, creature-environment and real life-A-Life levels. [...]  

The interaction rules are non-deterministic and multilayered; our aim was to create an open-ended system in whlch each entity - whether real life or A-Life, whether actually present (visitors at the ICC Museum) or virtually present (the users on the Internet or the creatures as code) - are equally important components of a complex,life-like system. [...]  

Interactivity and A-Life teach us to rethink our definition ofart, broadening our view by allowing us to integrate personality, variety, processes of nature and new perspectives on art and life. As the images in our installations are not static, pre-fixed or predictable, they become living processes themselves, representing the influences of the viewers' interactions and the internal principles of variation, mutation and evolution. The image processes are no longer reproducible but continuously changing and evolving. Such artwork can therefore be considered a living system itself, representing the relationship and interaction between life and A-Life.  

Ken Rinqldo Autopoiesis/ /24O0  

My interdisciplinary media art installations look to the intersection between natural and technological systems. Integration of the organic and electromechanical elements asserts a confluence and co-evolution between living and evolving technological material. I am fascinated with and encouraged by humanl<ind's struggle to evolve technological systems that move toward intelligence and autonomy, which are modelled from our current conceptions of the natural. My artworl<s are influenced by theories on living systems, artificial life, interspecies communication and the underlying beauty and pattern inherent in the nature and organization of matter, energy and information. While I find hope and fascination with our techno-cultural evolution, many of my works express concern for ecological issues, which are often not considered within the realm oftechnological and cultural progress.  

I have chosen interactive art in particular because it encourages active, selfdetermined relationships with a work of art and points to a co-evolved coupling between human, machine, nature and culture. The branching and joining of physical forms in my work echoes the behavioural flow and multiple directions an interactive piece may take in the act of self-organizing. I am compelled by open structures that define form but do not close the lorm off to tl.re viewer. I use exposed electronics and mechanics as part ofthe aesthetic, in proposing structural relationships between wire, circuits and natural structures. I believe it is imperative that technological systems acknowledge and model the evolved wisdom of natural living systems, so they will inherently fuse, to permit an emergent and interdependent earth. Symbio-technoetic can describe this philosophy.  

Autopoiesis is an artificial life robotic series of fifteen musical and robotic sculptures that interact with the public and modify their behaviours based on both the presences of the participants in the exhibition and the communication betweeneachseparatesculpture. [The]sculpturestalkwitheachotherthrough a hardwired network and audible telephone tones, which are a musical language for the group. Autopoiesis is 'self-mal<ing', a characteristic of all living systems. This characteristic of living systems was defined and refined by Francisco Varela and Humberto Maturana.  

Autopoiesis [...] presents an inleractive environment, which is immersive, detaited and able to evolve in real time by utilizing feedback and interaction lrom audience/participant members. The interactivity engages the viewer/ participant, who in turn affects the system's evolution and emergence. This ( r('.r[es a system evolution as well as an overall group sculptural aesthetic. The \t r ucIures themselves are consttucted of cabernet sauvignon grape vines pulled nlto colrpression with steel wires. The joints are a custom-moulded urethane pl,rstic. [...] The grape vines were selected to create an approachable natural st ulgrture that exists in the human biological realm.  

Autopoiesis utilizes a number of unique approaches to create this complex and cvolving environment. It uses smart sensor organization that senses the presence ol the viewer/participant and allows the robotic sculpture to respond intelligently. 1...1 For example, at the top of each sculptural element (or arm), four passive irrlr'.rred sensors [...] tell each arm to move in the direction of the viewer, while the ,rt t ive infra-red sensor located at the tip stops the arm as it arrives within inches of (hc viewer. This allows the sculpture to disptay both attraction and repulsion bch.rviours Iand] giveIs] the viewer a sense of the emotional state of the sculptural t'lcr.nents as they interact. Furthermore, inAutopoiesis the robotic sensors compare tlrcir sensor data through a central-state controller, so the viewer is able to walk thlor.rgh the sculptural installation and have the arms interact both individually ,rrrcl as a group. Some of the behaviours Iinclude] 'follow the leader', where one .rrnr is passing a'mimic me'message to the next arm [and] 'flocking'behaviour, where they are all moving simultaneously, or flocl< out from the centre, where the .rlnr in the centre sends a message for the other arms to follow Higher and more r,rpid tones are associated with fear and the lower, mote deliberate tonal sequences with relaxation and play. Other tones give the impression of the sculptures whistling to themselves. The telephone tones are a consistent language of intelcommunication and manilest a sense of overall robotic group consciousness, where what is said by one, affects what is said by others. [. .. I  

Autopoiesis continually evolves its own behaviours in response to the unique crrvironment and viewer/participant inputs. This group consciousness of sculptural robots manifests a cybernetic ballet of experience, with the computer/ rn.rchine and viewer/participant involved in a grand dance of one sensing and rt'slronding to the other.

# Benjcrmin Bogcrt qnd Philippe Pcrsquier Context Machines/ / 2Al3  

Context Machines are generative artworks whose design is inspired by models of memory and creativity drawn from the cognitive sciences. In a traditional artistic context, tlre artist works directly in the material that is presented to the audience. In generative art, the artist manifests the concept in a system whose output is presented to the audience. This is a process of meta-creation: the building of systems that create media artefacts. Our development of Context Machines is manilest computationally and informed by cognitive models and theory, which are ralely exploited in generative art.  

Our initial motivation leading to Context Mschines is that their output be, to some degree, a surprise to us. Computational theories oIcomplexity, emergence and non-determinism contribute to processes that enable surprising results. The creative behaviour of Context Mschines is manifest in the generative representation presented to the audience. Context Machines are image-makers - but the process by which they generate images is more significant than the images themselves. Harold Cohen describes the significance of cognitive processes in image-mal<ing:  

An image is a reference to some aspect of the world which contains witl-rin its own structure and in terms of its own structure a reference to the act of cognition which generated it. It must say, not that the world is tike this, but that it was recognized to have been like this by the image-makeq who leaves behind this record: not of the world, but of the act.r  

Context Machines share a number of core features: they all involve a computercontrolled camera, used to collect images of their visual context, and use computational methods to generate novel representations. [...]  

The artvvork should relate itself to its context, without that relation being predetermined by the artist.  

This is our central motivation and informs Memory Associstiun Machine's production and remains in the bacl<ground of all Context Machines. The use of an 'intentional stance' lrames the work as an autonomous entity that is capable of forming a relation to its context, which includes the audience. In order to form such a relation, the artwork must be embodied - albeit in a synthetic sense: the world impacts the systen'r through the images collected by the machine, while the artwork impacts the world through the subtle eflect of its representation on the viewer. For example, a rich and complex representation may encourage viewers to approach the work, which would increase the number of images of people collected by the system. In addition is the aspect of surprise, where the rnachine's representation should, to some degree, appear independent of the intention of the artist. This interest in surprise is analogous to the interest in erasing the 'artist's hand' in traditional art. In illusionistic painting, the lack of visible brushstrokes gives the viewer the inpression that the worl< is magical and disconnected from the artist while sirnultaneously testilying to his or her sl<ill. The creative behaviour of the Confext Mschines provides a similar rnagical quality: 'The signs of the will of a creator are sometimes less palpable in these objects than a manifestation of a "will" of their own.', [... ]

[...] So far the discourse around software and generative art has focused largely on defining and contextualizing the field, and reflecting on its particular processes and materials - for example, the nature of 'code', or the question of software/process as art.  

ln order to come to grips with the works themselves, I would argue that any critique must be able to address the specifics of their generative systems: that lhr. systems, not their outputs or residues, are the core of the work. System can lrt'<lislinguished from code: code is the language-specific text that implements lhe abstract, lormal structure that I will call system. [...]  

How do we read such systems, critically? [...] Stefan Helmreichrand l(.rtherine Hayles2 have made strong analyses of a-life science, pursuing a b.rsically deconstructive approach and arguing that a-life Iartificial lifel systems .u'e fundamentally narrative in their operation. Moreover, for these critics ,r life's narratives themselves 'reinscribe' particular assumptions about t'nrbodiment, subjectivity, gender, family and theology. These narratives ate tlt'coded in part from the discourse around the software system - Hayles, for t,x.rrnple, makes use of a video representing Torn Ray's Tierrc system, where li.ry's biological and theological analogies are spelled out in the narration and tlrc construction of the visualization. However, when Stefan Helmreich analyses f ohn Holland's Echo, a platform for creating agent-based a-life simulations, he rkrcs so based on conversations with a programmer and inspection of the code; llclrrreich's observations come as much from the defined formal structures of I hc software as they do from the discourse around those structures. These ,rrralyses suggest a way of reading systems as stories; they in turn create new, r r.itical stories based on that interpretation.  

So, a 'systenr story' is a translation or narration of the processual structures, ontology, entities and relations in a software system. Such stories are useful devices lirr.opening up these systems to discussion and critique. System stories are not singular or objective; each one is a particular and situated reading. Nor are they lkr.rtirrg signifiers though, since they draw on the concrete, formal object that is the srrl'tware system. What generative art criticism needs are system stories that ('ngage, in detail, with that formal object, and draw out its implications.  

Hayles and Helmreich also provide an argument as to the importance of sVstem stories. In their analyses, the narratives ofartiflcial lile are tacit, built-in ,rssumptions which inform software n'rodels and simulations. ln the case of a-life, llrcre is an obvious relationship with the world'outside'the simulation - with lili'as we know and live it. The critics warn us against mistaking these assumptions lor 'the rules' of life - confusing the made with the given, or culture with nature. 5 irn ilarly the value of system stories for generative art is in their ability to connect t ritically, prospectively, speculatively - entities and relations within the system with entities and relations outside it. [...]  

Sirrulation techniques are used in these works as generative devices, not as lools lor modelling; but nonetheless the work is entirely shaped by the t onstluction of its underlying system, its conflguration of entities and relations. I h.rt conflguration, what Brad Borevitz calls its'logic'or'systemacity',3 is revealed t{) I he user through a process of dynamic interaction; as Borevitz says, there is a kind of experiential reverse-engineering at play, as we map back from residue or output to system. once again however, the system is core, and therefore surely the structure of that system is crucial. Especially in works using simulation and related techniques, abstract generative art performs cosmogeny: it brings forth a whole artificial world, saying, here is my world, and heres how it works. once again, I will argue that this practice is in a unique position to explore and critique 'how it works'. Borevitz quotes Clement Greenberg on abstract painting and sculpture: 'like fr,rnctional architecture and the machine, they look what they do., So, what do they do? [...]  

Engaged as it is in the pragmatics of generativity - of making something make something - generative software art turns to computationally expedient techniques. The simplest of these is combinatorics, or the playing out of permutations. Some recent visual generative art follows this approach, setting a simple system in motion and observing its outcomes. The results are visually complex, but the underlying system is surprisingly simple, as in some of the pieces in Casey Reas's Softvvare (structures) #002 and#003, Jared rarbelt's #003A and #0038, and William Ngan's #0038.a  

ln this project the artist's focus was reflexive and processual: considering the 'natural language' specification of a structure and its varied implementation. Removed from that context, however, we are laced once again with the shape of the system, and the question ofinterpreting or responding to that configuration of entities and relations. The model worlds in these instances are pure machines, clockwork constellations. They transform determinism into aesthetic complexity, using scale of population and a kind of analytic or integrative visualization - displaying spatio-temporal relations rather than the entities themselves. [...]  

sofwvare (structures) also shows examples of another common world-system, using techniques of physical simulation. Robert Hodgin's implementations of #003, and Ngan's #003A, both introduce simulations o[ momentum and gravity (disobeying the 'structure' in the process). Among the many other uses of this technique are Mark Napiers and scott Snibbe's6 works in the CoDeDoc project.l [...] These techniques are pragmatic and effective, in generative terms: they create complex, dynamic interactions between elements, at a low computational cost- They also bring with them an immediate physical resonance, as we recognize these physical dynamics and infer the properties of the entities (their relative masses, the strength of gravity). [...]  

Ngan writes of trying to imbue a 'sense of life' into the entities in his beautiful #0034:' Hodgin describes the results as 'organic' and 'cellular'. Tarbell goes further, imagining the circle-entities'experiencing' and'choosing' intersections 'analogous to daily life'.7 This critique is not intended to discourage or overinterpret these narratives, but rather to imagine the consequences of taking them nrore seriously, especially in their potential relationship with the'outside'world.  

This unfulfilled potential is especially clear in the way generative art uses multi-agent systems. ln this ubiquitous technique, entities are explicitly defined .rnd visualized, often literally traced as they move around a cosrnos/canvas. Their r-elations with each other can be more complex than in a physical simulation, irrcluding'flocking' behaviour, where individuals modify their motion based on that of their neighbours. [...]  

Here too, the generative technique is effective in creating visual complexity, .rnd emergent dynamic form; but again each multi-agent system encodes an ontology, a structure of entities and relations, which must be read as the core of the work. The entities themselves have characteristic properties: they are identical, or belong to a set of predefined types, and their properties and behaviour are static over time. The systems have a particular relation to time: they tend to be a series ofinstantaneous slices. The state ofthe system at one rnoment is a function of its state in the momentjust passed (this is also true of physical simulations). In other words, history is all but absent. This is reflected in the construction of 'agent' and 'environment' in these systems. The environment here is (literally) a blank canvas, inert, empty space. Agents tend not to have a nreans of influencing that environment - even when they leave 'traces' in that space, the traces have no impact on the agents. The traces are visualization rlevices, not entities in the lormal ontology. What kind of narrative is this? All these attributes can be explained as computationally pragmatic - the simplest or rurost efficient way to achieve the generative payoff of the swarm aesthetic. Again .rny referentiality of this system can be downplayed in favour of pure generative instrr,rmentality. And again Iwould argue that in fact these worl<s are Iundamentally determined by this ontology, and that in a basic way we see it in llre works (cf. Greenberg, above). The works visualize their structure of entities .rncl relations. They model a world.  

My concern is not for realism or to oppose the necessary abstraction that any sinrulation or agent-based system involves. Rather it is to point out that these svstems encode, for whatever reason, specific ontologies, and that those ontologies in turn, especially in agent-based systems, present specific attributes: rrrodes of being and relation, relationships between individual and group, rrrrlrphology of groups, relations of individual and environment, models of beingirr-time. Lev Manovich sees in such work an image of 'world as the dynamic nctworks of relations, oscillating between order and disorder - always vulnerable, rr'.rdy to change with a single click of the user'.8 This is true, the swarm aesthetic is enchanted with dynamic multiplicity, with shifting networks of relation, with to.rlescence and dispersal. Br-rt consider the subject or agent modelled here, if llr.rt's the story we want to tell: a clone in a crowd, unchanging, with no traction on the space it inhabits, existing in an ongoing, perpetual present. If these systems provide images of contemporary society then they are, at best, naive and utopian: a mass of identical (or typed) individuals, each contributing equally to the collective dynamic, each equally connected with and affecting all the others. As a social model this is a kind of idealized, frozen anarcho-democracy, where power relations (unequal causal connections) can never emerge.  

This critique is simply a starting point; its flipside is more positive and important. If generative software art communicates system stories, particularly in the form of model worlds or ontologies, then it is potentially a platform for telling system stories that are more sophisticated, critical or experimental; it could tal<e seriously the prospect that Manovich proposes, the potential o[ software and generative technique to provide images of, or rather imaginations oJ the (social, cultural, personal, material ...) systems we live in. Generative art has a unique potential here, because unlike other art forms its basic materials are systems themselves. [...]  

casey Reas's works Tissue andMicroimage begin to develop the homogeneous swarm, creating distinct'species' of agent with distinctive (but again fixed) relationships. The added complexity of the interaction within the system is revealed in the images, as tangled clouds resolve into dark loops and braids. Similarly Ichitaro Masuda's recent work Haohsos has multiple species of agent, dilferentiated in size and colour, and attracted to and repelled from each other to varying (randomized) degrees. while Masuda's code reveals that the parameter for attraction is 'love', this is no agent-meets-agent story. lndividuals form pseudo-stable clusters of five or more, where forces of attraction and repulsion are in equilibrium; these clusters might in turn orbit other groups, and are readily disrupted if another agent approaches. lf there is a social story here, it is one of pursuit, desire and loss, but above all the delicate negotiation o[ local collectives or cliques. once more this dynamic in[orms the aesthetic of the trailpaintings which the system produces, with tight gnarls and knots, as well as dense circular orbits and linear vectors.  

These examples retain the usual disconnection between agent and environment - agents interact with each other, but have no functional impact on their world. However, this feature is not computationally or formally necessary, and in fact there seems to be a generative and aesthetic payof,f for linl<ing agent and environment more tightly. [...]  

Narrative critiques reading software and generative art have a significant limitation, or rather a kind of grain or directionality. They can decompose a system, analyse the modes of being and relation that it encodes, but they have little to say about how those encodings play out, how they operate in a generative process. The emergence of complex, dynamic forms and behaviours from these local encodings is central to artists' interests in complex systems;r0 this is the rroment o[ emergent generativity or the 'computational sublime'.'r Once agaitr, tlris is where generative art is in a unique and powerful position, in that unlike other forms of discourse, it can actually experiment with the emergent outcomes of particularontologies, modes of beingand relation. [...1  

One of the further implications here is a reconsideration of the context for .generative art. lf it is fundamentally concerned with creating model ontologies, then we can imagine it in relation to other practices of formal modelling and sirnulation. These techniques have a long history in military strategy and geopolitics, but in recent years they have become more widespread. For example, .r new branch of social science has emerged which uses simulation as a basic tool lbr testing 'explicit models of social phenomena'.]2 [... ]  

In other words, we ate already being modelled, in artificial worlds that can lold back powerfully into the real. Like Helmreich, I would be very concerned if social modelling was used only to entrench our 'known features'. Unknown li'.rtures must be more promising, and here again generative art can step in. llorevitz writes: 'lf there is a chance that software will contribute significantly to .r new politically relevant aesthetics, it lies in the way software shows us a way orrt of order, in and through order.'r3 Yes, but what's required is attention to the specifics ofthat order, its structures and properties. Generative art can, and must, tlo rlore than make images of complex systems; it can tinker critically with the svstelns themselves, then set them running: possible worlds.  

lf abstract or generative soltware art can, and sometimes does, work this way, whcre does this leave the binary of formalism/culturalism, or generative/ soltware art? Perhaps the relation could be one of complementarity.'Culturalist' soltware art [e.g. UBERMORGEN.COM's Google WiU Eat lrsef] has often focused un intervening critically, and practically, in existing software systems, rt'r onfiguring them from the inside. ln the process it shows up the latent cultural ,rli('ncv oIsoftware, butalso its potential transformation. [...]  

As I have argued, we can think of abstract software art, or generative art, as pott'rrti.rlly exploring alternative modes of being and relation, telling stories l)ul .tlso literally toying with complex, dynamic systems, exploring them prospectively, and not (merely) as eye-candy machines, but as model worlds. lo rt'st.rte the binary: perhaps generative formalism Ie.g. Reas's Software 1\trrrr lrrrcs)] can be prospective and exploratory, where culturalism is more lor,rl, situated, concrete, interventionist. The two strands might in fact be r and their critical potential might be far greater if we think t lrr'nr togcther, instead of apart.

# Geoff Cox Generator: The Vcrlue of Softwcrre Art//2OO?  

[...] [s]oftware art exemplifies process-orientatecl practice in a way that lencls itself to critical work appropriate to contemporary conditions. [...] [ollder definitions associated with generative art stress the formal rule-based and syntactical properties of software, and thus do not place sufficient emphasls on semantic concerns and social context. Although, in general, this may be the case, formal concerns are essential to understand the more cultural aspects and the generative or transformative aspects of sofltware. The essay argues that taken together, the terms generative art and software art emphasize productive contradictions - inherent to both, and between the two. [. . . ]  

Inke Arns [.. . ] stressIes] the distinction between earlier work using computers and softvvare art, where the latter is'...not art that has been created with the help of a computer, but art that happens in the computer; software is not programmed by artists in order to produce autonomous artworks, but the software itself is the artwork. What is crucial here is not the result but the process triggered in the computer by the program code.'l  

[... ] But in the case of software, it is not simply a choice of process or product but of the interaction between source code and its executed form. [...] [The] privileging of execution, even if in combination with source code, avoids some of the contemporary practices associated with software art Ie.g.] programs that are not necessarily executable, or executable only on a conceptual level (often referred to as 'codework'). Perhaps it is simply a case of generative art requiring improved description to shift emphasis from the object generated to the process of generation. [... ]  

Iln the] exhibition'CODeDOC', first for the Whitney Museum of American Art's 'artport' web site (2002), and later at Ars Electronica (2003), the curator Christiane Paul set the invited artist-programmers an instruction to'connect and move three points in space'in a language oftheir choice (Java, C, Visual Basic, Lingo, Perl) and to exchange the code with the other artists for comments. [Here] code is taken to be part of the work and not simply meant to assist interpretation. [. . . ]  

The challenge for a critical practice in software art is to maintain contradiction irr the process of transformation, for this is where politics is evident and where reiuvention ta[<es place. In [. . . ] a contemporary situation where conceptual strategies have become the orthodoxy of contemporaly art and effectively recuperated, r.rdical art can be found in social energies not yet recognized as art. Perhaps software art and culture represents such an instance - for now at least.

[S]ociety operates on the theory that specialization is the key to success, not realizing that specialization precludes comprehensive thinking. This means that the potentially-integratable-techno-economic advantages accruing to society from the myriad specializations are not comprehended integratively and therefore not realized, or they are realized only in negative ways. [...]  

One of humanity's prime drives is to understand and be understood. All other living creatures are designed for highly specialized tasl<s. Man seems unique as the comprehensive comprehender and coordinator of local universe affairs. [...] In organizing our grand strategy we must first discover where we are now; that is, what our present navigational position in the univer-sal scheme of evolution is. To begin our position-fixing aboard our Spaceship Earth we must first acknowledge that the abundance of immediately consumable, obviously desirable or utterly essential resollrces have been sufficient until now to allow us to carry on despite our ignorance. Being eventually exhaustible and spoilable, they have been adequate only up to this critical moment. [...]  

We begin by eschewing the role of specialists who deal only in parts. Becoming deliberately expansive instead of contractive, we ask, 'How do we think in terms of wholes?' lf it is true that the bigger the thint<ing becomes the more lastingly effective it is, we must ask,'How big can we think?' [...]  

One oI the modern tools of high intellectual advantage is the development of what is called general systems theory. Employing it, we begin to think of the largest and most comprehensive systems, and try to do so scientifically. We start by inventorying all the important, known variables that are operative in the problem. But if we don't really l<now how big 'big' is, we may not start big enough, and are thus likely to leave unknown but critical variables outside the system, which will continue to plague us. Interaction of the unknown variables inside and outside the arbitrarily chosen limits of the system are probably going to generate misleading or outrightly wrong answers. If we are to be effective, we are going to have to thinl< in both the biggest and most minutelyincisive ways permitted by intellect, and by the information thus far won through experience. [.. . ]  

Can we think oi and state adequately and incisively, what we rnean by universe? For universe is, inferentially, the biggest system. If we could start with universe, we would autonatically avoid leaving out any strategically critical variables. [... ]  

Holding to the scientists' experiences as all important, I define universe, including both the physical and metaphysical, as f,ollows: The universe is the aggregate of all of humanity's consciously-apprehended and communicated experience with the non-simultaneous, non-identical and only partially overlapping, always complementary, weighable and unweighable, ever omnitransforming, event seqr-rences. [.. . ]  

Having adequately defined the whole system, we may proceed to subdivide progressively. This is accomplished through progressive division into two parts, one of which, by definition, could not contain the answer - and discarding of the sterile part. Each progressively-retained live part is called a'bit', because of its being produced by the progressive binary'yes'or'no' bi-section ofthe previously residual live part. The magnitude of such weeding operations is determined by the number of successive bits necessary to isolate the answer. [... ]  

How many 'bisecting bits' does it take to get rid of all the irrelevancies and leave in lucid isolation that specific infornation you are seeking? We find that the first subdividing of the concept of universe-bit one is into what we call a system. A system subdivides universe into all the universe outside the system (macrocosrn) and all the rest of the universe which is inside the system (microcosm), with the exception of the minor fraction of universe which constitutes the system itself. The system divides universe not only into macrocosm and microcosm but also coincidentally into typical conceptual and non-conceptual aspects of universe - that is, an overlappingly-associable consideration, on the one hand, and, on the other, all the non-associable, nonoverlappingly-considerable, non-simultaneously-transforming events of nonsynchronizable disparate wave frequency rate ranges. [...1  

Synergy is the only word in our language that means behaviour ol whole systems, unpredicted by the separately observed behaviours of any of the system's separate parts or any sub-assembly of the system's parts. [...]  

There is nothing about an electron alone that forecasts the proton, nor is there anything about the Earth or the Moon that forecasts the coexistence ofthe Sun. The solar system is synergetic - unpredicted by its separate parts. But the interplay of Sun as supply ship of Earth and the Moon's gravitationally produced tidal pulsations on Earth all interact to produce the biosphere's chemical conditions, which permit but do not cause the regeneration of Ilfe on Spaceship Earth. This is all synergetic. There is nothing about the gases given offrespiratorily by Earth's green vegetation that predicts that those gases will be essential to the life support of all mammals aboard Spaceship Earth, and nothing about the rrammals that predicts that the gases which they give off respiratorily are essential to the support of the vegetation aboard our Spaceship Earth. Universe is synergetic. Life is synergetic. [...]

# Jcrmes Lovelock Geophysiology: The Science of Gcrio//1989  

There is growing recognition of the inadequacy of the separated disciplinary approach for the solution of planetary scale problems. To understand even the atmosphere, which is the simplest of the planetary compartments, it is not enough to be a geophysicist; knowledge of chemistry and biology is also needed. It might seem that research teams that include experts in each of the different disciplines would resolve the problem, but anyone who has attended gatherings of experts knows that each expert speaks but does not ot cannot listen. What might help would be a broader-based general science, or a scientific operating system, that provides an environment within which the separate disciplines could interact.  

Contemporary concerns have developed from the consequences of changes made by humans in the composition of the atmosphere and the nature of the land surface and biota. [n many ways these modern concerns echo similar concerns about the human body early in the development of medicine. In the late nineteenth century the sciences of biochemistry and microbiology were well advanced but largely disconnected and not very helpful to those with disease. Advances in medicine were, however, vastly enabled by the existence of the general science of physiology. This science was transdisciptinary and also recognized the essentially emergent properties of a living organism. lf one is interested in how our core temperatures are maintained at 37 degrees centigrade, a biochemical approach to a solution of the problem is fruitless. Temperature regulation is a systems control problem. But by starting with physiology, the biochemical aspects involving, for example, oxidative metabolism naturally fit into place. The main purpose of this paper will be to put forward an analogous Earth science, geophysiology, as the transdisciplinary environment for planetary scale problems, particularly those involving a wide range of disciplines. Where it is postulated, even though not proved, that emergent properties exist, it may be useful for practical purposes to consider the Earth as if it were a living organism.  

Before the nineteenth century, scientists were comfortable with the notion of a living Earth. One of them wasJames Hutton, who has often been called the father ofgeology. Hutton ['Theory ofthe Earth', 1788] likened the Earth to a superorganism and recommended physiology as the science for its investigation. [...]  

Hutton's wholesome view of the Earth was discarded early in the last century. I thinl< that this may have been a consequence of a growing interest in origins and in evolutionary theories both for Earth and for life sciences. For biologists there was Darwin's great vision of the evolution of the species of organisms by natural selection.  

For the geologists there was the wholly independent theory that the evolution of the material environment was simply a matter of chemical and physical determination. The divorce of the Earth and life sciences in the nineteenth century was inevitable. There was a rapid increase in the supply of inlormation about the Earth as exploration and exploitation developed. But the techniques for looking at organisms were very different flrom those for looking at the ocean, the air and the rocks. lt must have been an exciting period of science. There were few inclined to stand bacl< and take a broader view or try to keep alive Hutton's superorganism. What is remarkable is not the division of the sciences, but that two distinct and very different theories of evolution could coexist even until today.  

The reason for endurance of the division is, I think, a mutual acceptance by Earth and life scientists of the anaesthetic notion of adaption. [... ]  

Adaptation is a dubious notion, for in the real world the environment, to which the organisms are adapting, is determined by their neighbours' activities rather than by the blind forces of chemistry and physics alone. In such a world, changing the environment could be part of the game, and it would be absurd to suppose that organisms would refrain from changing their material environment, if by so doing they left more progeny. In his time, of course, Darwin did not know, as we do now, that the air we breathe, the oceans and the rocks are all either the direct products of living organisms or have been greatly modified by their presence. In no way do organisms just 'adapt' to a dead world determined by physics and chemistry alone. They live with a world that is the breath and bones of their ancestors and that they are now sustaining. [... ]  

Like co-evolution, Gaia reflects the apartheid ofVictorian biology and geology, but it goes much further. Gaia theory is about the evolution of a tightly coupled system whose constituents are the biota and their material environment, which comprises the atrnosphere, the oceans and the surface rocks. Self-regulation of important properties, such as climate and chemical composition, is seen as a consequence of this evolutionary process. Like living organisms and many closed loop self-regulating systems, it would be expected to show emergent properties; that is, the whole will be more than the sum of the parts. This kind of system is notoriously difficult, if not impossible, to explain by cause and effect logic, as practising inventors know to their cost. [...]  

Engineers and physiologists have long been aware ofthe subtleties offeedback. Homeostasis is only possible when feedback is applied at the right amplitude and phase and when the system's time constants are appropriate. Both positive and negative feedback can lead to stability or instability, depending on the timing of their application. Theoretical ecology rnodels, notorious for their intractable mathematics, would not surprise an engineer, who would see them in his words as 'open loop systems' where leedback was applied, or happened by chance, in an arbitrary manner. By contrast, geophysiological models, such as Daisyworld la computer simulation o[a hypothetical world in orbit], include feedback, negative and positive, in a coherent manner. As a consequence, the models are robust and stable and will happily accommodate any number of non-[inear equations and still prefer to relate with stable attractors. [... I  

I do not disagree with those who propose that some, or even a large proportion, ofthe total regulation ofany chosen Earth property can be explained by deterministic chemistry and physics. Livir-rg systems use chemistry economically. They do not strive ostentatiously to do better than blind chemistry or physics because there is no need. The purpose ofGaia is to offer a new way of looking at the Earth and to make predictions that can be tested experimentally. Had it not been for the curiosity stimulated by thoughts on the mechanisms of Caia, none of the important trace gases dimethyl sulfide, carbon disulfide, methyl iodide and chloride would have been sotrght and for,rnd when they were [...]. To conclude, Gaia theory provol<es us to think about three things:  

1. Life is a planetary scale phenomenon. There cannot be sparse life on a planet. lt wolrld be as unstable as half of an animal. Living organisms have to regulate their planet; otherwise, the ineluctable forces of physical and chemical evolution would render it uninhabitable.  

2. Gaia theory adds to Darwin's great vision. There is no longer any need to consider the evolution of the species separately from the evolution of their environment. The two processes are tightly coupled as a single indivisible process. It is not enough merely to say that the organism that leaves the most progeny succeeds. Success also depends upon coherent coupling between the evolution of the organism and the evolution of its material environment.  

3. Lastly, it may turn out that the gift of Gaia to geophysics is the reduction of Alfred Lotka's insight [Elements of Physical Biology,1925] to practice: a way to look at the Earth mathematically that joyfully accepts the non-linearity of nature without being overwhelmed by the limitations imposed by the chaos of complex dynamics.

Our work begins when we perceive an anomaly in the environment that is the result of opposing beliefs or contradictory metaphors. Moments when reality no longer appears seamless and the cost ol belief has become outrageous offer the opportunity to create new spaces - first in the mind and thereafter in everyday life.  

We understand the universe as a giant conversation taking place simultaneously in trillions of voices and billions of languages, most of which we could not conceive of even if we l<new that they existed. Of those voices wlrose existence has impinged on our own to the degree that we can become aware of them, we realize that our awareness is imperfect at best. Therefore, it seems to us that the casual and wanton destruction and disruption of living systems of whose relationships we know so little requires extraordinary hubris.  

For us, everything started with a decision made in the late 1960s to deal exclusively with issues of survival as best we could perceive thenr. Each body of work sought a larger or more comprehensive framing or understanding of what such a notion might mean and how we, as artists, might express it. For example, in The Seventh Lagoon of The Lagoon Cycle, we came up with the statement: 'but that would require reorienting consciousness around a different database'.  

We are now exploring what such a statement might mean - unpacking our intuitive ideas. Our most recent worl< opens up the idea of setting Llp an ecosecurity system, a safety net for the ecology not unlike a social security system. However, there are issues such as the population explosion that need a separate and comprehensive address, for just as prairie grass would displace everything that is not itself, so would any expanding population. The notion that ingenious technology will resolve population pressures on the one hand and generate infinitely expanding marl<ets on the other is sirnply an illusion. It is too easy to forget that every entrepreneurial act, even recycling, is itself a tax on the ecosystem. [...]  

# The Lagoon Cycle (1973-85)  

This work is, in part, a mural 360 feet long, averaging 8 feet tall, in sixty parts. It was completed over the period 1973 to 1985. It is portable, done on photomural paper mounted on heavy cotton duck. The materials are photography, oil, graphite, crayon and ink. lt was first exhibited in complete form at the Johnson Gallery at Cornell University in 1985 and then later at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art.  

The Lagoon Cycle can be read as a story in seven parts; each part, as in a picaresque novel, is its own story. It can be read as an array of storyboards for a very unusual movie. As artists, we see it as an environmental narrative, one of whose properties is to envelop the viewer with its form and subject matter. For us, this work relates to other twentieth-century environmental works as well as to the myriad mural programs of the past.  

The Lagoon Cycle unfolds as a discourse between two characters who discuss the ways in which the metaphors we live by aflect what we do to each other and to the environment. It casts light on how we create our world view and are in turn created by it. The Lagoon Cycle is named after the estuarial lagoons that are endangered everywhere; the lagoons are used as a metaphor for culture and even for life itself.  

The story concerns two characters who begin a search for a 'hardy creatute who can live under museum conditions'and who are transformed by this search. The characters define themselves inThe First Lagoon by the diflerences in their values and perceptions, with one naming himself Lagoon Maker and the other naming herself Witness. Both proceed to live up to their names, although they finally surrender them as circumstances push the two characters into constructing ever-larger frames for their discourse.  

# The Sixth Lagoon: On Metaphor and Discourse  

The Fifth Lagoon deals with the Salton Sea, which was lormed by flood flow released by human error from the canals along the Colorado River. Ihe Sxfh tcgoon treats the entire Colorado River basin. lagoon Maker and Witness reflect on the insights they have gained through observing aquatic systems. They expand the scale of their thinking flrom the Salton Sea to the Colorado River watershed, which has been changed by lifesryles that demand vast amounts of electricity and irrigation. The exploding megatechnology of the twentieth century has shocl<ed the environment and does not have time to 'niche itself in'. Witness sees all nature as a discourse between the elements, and both characters urge, 'Pay attention to the discourse between belief systems and environmental systems.'

As we stated earlier, we believe that the universe is a giant conversation and that any introduction of new ideas, new metaphors, or new possibilities can change that conversation. Although we have built works, we think that changes in the conversation that lead to attitudinal and behavioural changes are as significant as any'built'work.

# Dcrvid Dunn and Jim Crutchfield Entomogenic Climqte Chcrnge: Insect Bio-Acoustics Future Forest Ecology/ / 2AO9  

Forest ecosystems result from a dynamic balance of soil, plants, insects, animals and climate. The balance, though, can be destabilized by outbreaks oftree-eating insects. These outbreaks in turn are sensitive to climate, which controls precipitation. Drought stresses trees, rendering them vulnerable to insect predation. The net result is increased deforestation driven by insects and modulated by climate.  

For their part, many species of predating insects persist only to the extent t|at they successfully reproduce by consuming and living within trees. Droughtstressed trees are easier to infest compared to healthy trees, which have more robust defences against attacl<. To find trees suitable for reproduction, insects track relevant environmental indicators, including chemical signals and, probably, bio-acoustic ones emitted by stressed trees. At the level of insect populations, infestation dynamics are sensitive to climate via seasonal temperatures. Specifically, insect populations increase markedly each year in which winters are short and freezes less severe. The net result is rapidly changing insect populations whose dynamics are modulated by climate.  

Thus, via temperature and precipitation, climate sets the context for tree growth and insect reproduction and also for the interaction between trees and insects. At the largest scale, climate is driven by absorbed solar energy and controlled by relative fractions of atmospheric gases. The amount of absorbed solar energy is determined by cloud and ground cover. Forests are a prime example, as an important ground cover that absorbs, uses and re-radiates solar energy in various forms. At the same time forests are key moderators of atmospheric gases. Trees expel oxygen and take up carbon dioxide in a process that sequesters carbon from the atmosphere in solid form. As plants and trees evolved, in fact, they altered the atmosphere sufficiently that earth's climate, once inhospitable, changed and now supports a wide diversity of life.  

There are at least three stories here: those of the trees, the insects and the climate. They necessarily overlap, since the phenomena and interactions they describe co-occur in space and in time. Their overlap hints at an astoundingly complicated system, consistingof many cooperating and competing components; the health of any one depends on the health of others. [...] How are we to understand the individual views as part of a larger whole? In particular, what can result from interactions between the different scales over which insects, trees and climate adapt?  

Taking the stories together, we have, in engineering parlance, a feedback loop: Going from small to large scale, one sees that insects reproduce by feeding on trees; forests modulate insect reproduction, and precipitation controls tree growth. The feedbacl< loop of insects, trees and climate means that new kinds of behaviour can appear - dynamics caused not by a single player but by their interactions. Importantly, such feedback loops can maintain ecosystem stability or lead to instability that amplifies even small effects to the large scale.  

Here we give a concrete example of the dynamic interaction between insects, trees and climate. We focus on the role that bark beetles (Scolytidae or, more recently, Curculionidae: Scolytinae) play in large-scale deforestation and consequently in climate change. Bark beetles are emblematic of many different insect species that now participate in rapid deforestation. Likewise, we primarily focus on the North American boreal forests because of their unique characteristics but also as representative of the vulnerability of all types of forest ecosystems. Thus, the picture we paint here is necessarily incomplete; nonetheless, these cases serve to illustrate the complex of interactions implicated in the feedbacl< loop and also the current limits to human response.  

Although they are not alone, bark beetles appear to be an example o[a novel player in climate change. Unlike the climatic role that inanimate greenhouse gases are predicted to play in increasing global temperatute over the next century, bark beetles represent a biotic agent that actively adapts on the shorter time scale of years but still can cause effects, such as deforestation, at large spatial scales. To emphasize the specificity and possible autonomy of this kind of biological, nonhuman agent, we refer to the result as entomogenic climate change.  

A detailed analysis of the problem of entomogenic climate change leads us to make a number of constructive suggestions for increased attention to relatively less familiar domains of study, including micro-ecological symbiosis and its nonlinear population dynamics, and insect social organization. Here we emphasize in particular the role that bark beetle bio-acoustic behaviour must have in their evolving multiple survival adaptations, which, it appears, fills in significant gaps in the explanatory model of infestation dynamics. One goal is to stimulate interdisciplinary research appropriate to the complex of interactions implicated in deforestation and to discovering effective control strategies.  

# Forest Health and Climate  

The Earth's three great forest ecosystems - tropical, temperate and boreal - are of irreplaceable importance to its self-regulating balance. Their trees help to regulate the Earth's climate, provide essential timber tesoutces and create a diversity of habitat and nutrients that support other forms of life, including millions of people. Forests contribute to global climate dynamics through a carbon cycle in which atmospheric carbon dioxide is converted into an immense carbon pool. [...]  

All forms of deforestation, human and natural, directly impact climatic conditions by attenuating or delaying the carbon cycle. In concert with welldocumented greenhouse gas elfects that drive global atmospheric change, the potential loss of large areas of these forests, combined with accelerating deforestation of tropical and temperate regions, nray have significant future climate impacts beyond already dire predictions. Ice core studies reveal that the Earth's climate has varied cyclically over the past 450,000 years. Temperatures have been closely tied to variations in atmospheric carbon dioxide, in a cycle that recurs on the time scale of millennia. Vegetation has been forced to adapt. The boreal forests are, in fact, highly vulnerable to these climate shifts. Examination of fossil pollen and other fossil records shows that, in response to temperature variations over the past millennia, North American boreal forests have changed radically many times. The unique sensitivity of these forests' tree species to temperature suggests that the predicted warmer climate will cause their ecological niches to shift north faster than the forests can migrate.  

One major consequence of boreal deforestation is increasing fire risk. Over the next half-century, the Siberian and Canadian boreal forests wilI most likely see as much as a 50 percent increase in burnt trees. one of the major sources fuelling these fires will be dead and dying trees l<illed by various opportunistic insect species and their associated micro-organisms.  

Paralleling concerns about the boreal forests, in recent years there has been a growing awareness o[ extensive insect outbreaks in various regional forests throughout the western united states. As consecutive summers of unprecedented forest fires consumed the dead and dying trees, a new concern emerged: insectdriven deforestation is a threat connected to global climate change. In fact, climate experts, forestry personnel and biologists have all observed that these outbreal<s are an inevitable consequence of a climatic shift to warmer temperatures. [...1  

It is now well established that mountain pine beetles have slipped through mountain passes from the Peace River country in northern British columbia to Alberta, the most direct corridor to the boreal forests. If the beetle is successful at adapting to and colonizing canada's jack pine, there will be little to stop it moving through the immense contiguous boreal forest, all the way to Labrador and the North American East coast. lt then will have a path down into the forests o[ easrern Texas. Entomologist Jesse Logan describes this as 'a potential geographic event of continental scale with unknown, but potentially devastating, ecological consequences'.  

Continental migration aside, if the beetles infest the high-elevation coniflers, the so-called five-needle pines, of the western United states, this wiil reduce the snow-fence effect that these alpine forests provide. Snow fences hold windrows ofcaptured snow that are crucial to the seasonal conservation and distribution of water from the Rocl<y Mountains. This is one of the primary origins of the water that sources several major river systems in North America. Every western state is contending with various rates of unprecedented insect infestation not only by many different species of Scolytidae but also by other plant-eating insects.  

These and other rising populations of phytophagous insects are now becoming recognized as a global problem and one of the most obvious and rapidly emerging consequences of global climate change. over the past fifteen years, there have been reports ofunusual and unprecedented outbreaks occurring on nearly every continent.[...1  

# The Bio-acoustic Ecolory Hypothesis  

one of the more under-appreciated research domains regarding bark beetles concerns their remarkable bio-acoustic abilities. [...]  

Past research suggested that sound-making and perception in bark beetles was secondary to their use of chemical-signalling mechanisms. Most studies addressing acoustic behaviour concentrated on sound generation, and only in its relationship to chemical signalling. These include the role stridulation sound-making has in controlling attack spacing between entry points in the host or in the triggering of pheromone release between genders. The resulting view is that bark beetles use a combination of chemical and acoustic signals to regulate aggression, attack on host trees, courtship, mating behaviour and population density.  

An emphasis on pheromone-based communication may very well have led to a lack of follow-up on the possibility that host trees themselves produce acoustic cues that attract pioneer beetles. Perhaps the earliest proposal dates to 1982 when William Mattson and Robert Haack (of the USDA and Forest Service, respectively) speculated that cavitation events in trees might produce acoustic signals audible to plant-eating insects. Cavitation occurs in trees through breaking of water columns conducting the xylem tissue of leaves, stems and trunks. The assumption has been that the sounds are vibrations coming from individual cells collapsing, which is due to gradual dehydration and prolonged water stress. While cavitation produces some acoustic emissions in the audible range $20~\mathrm{Hz}-20~\mathrm{kHz},$ , most occurin the ultrasound range $20-200~\mathrm{kHz}$ and above). [...]  

Recent fieldwork by Dunn focused on sound production by the pinion engraver beetle (lps confusus). Sounds were recorded within the interior phloem layer of pinion trees, often adjacent to beetle nuptial chambers. A rich and varied acoustic ecology was documented - an ecology that goes beyond the previously held assumptions about the role of sound within this species. Another important observation was that much of the sound production by this species has a very strong ultrasonic component. Since communication systems seldom evolve through investing substantial resources into portions ofthe frequency spectrum that an organism cannot both generate and perceive, this raised the question of whether or not bark beetles have a complementary ultrasonic auditory capability. Recent laboratory investigations by Carleton University biologistJayne Yack have also revealed ultrasound components in some bark beetle signals and indirect evidence that beetles possess sensory organs for hearing airborne sounds.  

One possible implication that arises from the combination of these Iaboratory and field observations is that various barl< beetle species may possess organs capable of hearing ultrasound for con-specific communication. If so, these species would be pre-adapted for listening to diverse auditory cues from trees.  

This in turn raises an important issue not addressed by previous bark beetle bio-acoustic research. A very diverse range ofsound signalling persists well after the putatively associated behaviours - host selection, coordination of attack, courtship, territorial competition and nuptial chamber excavations - have all taken place. ln fully colonized trees the stridulations, chirps and clicks can go on continuously for days and weeks, long after most of the associated behaviours will have apparently run their course. These observations suggest that these insects have a more sophisticated social organization than previously suspected - one that requires ongoing communication through sound and substrate vibration.  

The above acoustic fieldworl< led us to conclude that there must be a larger range of forms of insect socialily and, therefore, means of organizational communication. More precise understanding of these forms of social organization may improve our ability to design control systems, whether these are chemical, acoustic or biological.  

# Closing the Loop  

The eventual impact that insect-driven deforestation and global climate change will have on the Ear th's remaining forests ultimately depends on the rate at which temperatures increase. The impacts will be minimized if that rate is gradual, but increasingly disruptive if the change is abrupt. Unfortunately, most climate change projections now show that a rapid temperature increase is more likely. [...]  

one conclusion appears certain. Extensive deforestation by insects will convert the essential carbon pool provided by the Earth's forests into atmospheric carbon dioxide. concommitently, the generation of atmospheric oxygen and sequestration ofcarbon by trees will decrease.  

Most immediately, though, as millions of trees die, they not only cease to participate in the global carbon cycle but become potential fuel for more frequent and increasingly large-scale fire outbreaks. These fires will release further carbon dioxide into the atmosphere and do so more rapidly than the natural cycle of biomass decay. The interactions between these various components and their net effect are complicated at best - a theme running throughout the entire feedback loop. [... I  

The repeated lesson of complex, non-linear dynamical systems, though, is that the apparent stability ofany part can be destabilized by its place in a larger system. [...]  

Tal<en alone, the potential loss offorests is ofsubstantial concern to humans.  

when viewing this system as a feedback loop, however, the concern is that the individual components will become part of an accelerating positive feedback loop of sudden climatic change. such entomogenic change, given the adaptive population dynamics of a key player (insects), may happen on a very short timescale. This necessitates a shift in the current characterization of increasing insect populations as merely symptomatic of global climate change to a concern for insects as a significant generative agent.  

In addition to concerted research in bio-acoustics, micro-ecological symbiosis and dynamics, and insect social organizations, these areas, in conjunction with the field of chemical ecology, must be integrated into a broader view of multi-scale population, evolutionary and climate dynamics. In this sense, the birth of chemical ecology serves as an inspiration. It grew out of an interdisciplinary collaboration between biology and chemistry. It is precisely this l<ind of intentional co-operation between disciplines - but over a greater range of scales - that will most likely lead to new strategies for monitoring and defence against what seems to be a growing threat to the world's forests, and ultimately to humanity itself.

# Pierre Bourdieu The Field of Culturql Production, or The Economic World Reversed / / 1983  

[...f Few areas more clearly demonstrate the heuristic efficacy of relational thinking than that ofart and literature. Constructing an object such as the literary field requires and enables us to make a radical break with the [conventional approachl which tends to foreground the individual, or the visible interactions between individuals, at the expense of the structural relations - invisible, or visible only through their effects - between social positions that are both occupied and manipulated by social agents, which may be isolated individuals, groups or institutions. [... I  

The literary or artistic field is a field of forces, but it is also afeld of struggles tending to transform or conserve this field of forces. The network of objective relations between different positions implement in their struggles to defend or improve their positions (i.e. their position-takings), strategies which depend for their force and form on the position each agent occupies in the power relations (rapports de force).  

Every position-taking is defined in relation to the spoce of possibles which is objectively realized as a problemafic in the form of the actual or potential positiontaking corresponding to the difflerent positions; and it receives its distinctivevalue from its negative relationship with the coexistent position-takings to which it is objectively related and which determine it by delimiting it. lt follows from this, for example, that a pnse de position changes, even when it remains identical, whenever there is change in the universe of options that are simultaneously offered for producers and consumers to choose from. The meaning of a work (artistic, literary, philosophical, etc.) changes automatically with each change in the field within which it is situated for the spectator or reader. [. . . I  

when a new literary or artistic group makes its presence felt in the field of literary or artistic production, the whole problem is transformed, since its coming into being, i.e. into difference, modifies and displaces the universe of possible options; the previously dominant productions may, for example, be pushed into the status of outmoded (d€clcssi) or classic works.[...]  

The work of art is an object which exists as such only by virtue of the (collective) belief which l<nows and acknowledges it as a work of art. Consequently, [... ] a rigorous science of art must [... ] take into account everything which helps to constitute the work as such, not least the discourses of direct or disguised celebration which are among the socialconditions of production of the work of art qua object of belief.  

The production of discourse (critical, historical. etc.) about the work of art is one of the conditions of production of the work. Every critical affirmation contains, on the one hand, a recognition of the value of the work which occasions it, which is thus designated as worthy object of legitimate discourse [...] and on the other hand an affirmation of its own legitimary. Every critic declares not only his judgement of the work but also his claim to the right to talk about it and judge it. In short, he tal<es part in a struggle for the monopoly of legitimate discourse about the work of art, and consequently in the production of the value of the work of art. (And one's only hope of producing scientific knowledge - rather than weapons to advance a particular class of specific interests - is to make explicit to oneself one's position in the sub-field ofthe producers ofdiscourse about art and the contribution of this field to the very existence of the object of srudy.) [... ]  

[Tlhe sociology of art and literature has to take as its object not only the material production but also the symbolic production of the work [...]. lt therefore has to consider [...] the producers of the meaning and value of the work - critics, publishers, gallery directors, and the whole set of agents whose combined efforts produce consumers capable of knowing and recognizing the worl< of art as such. [... ]  

The literary or artistic field is at all times the site of a struggle between the two principles of hierarchization: the heteronomous principle, favourable to those who dominate the field economically and politically (e.g. 'bourgeois art') and the autonomous principle (e.g. 'art for art's sake'), which those of its advocates who are least endowed with specific capital tend to identifu with degree of independence from the economy, seeing temporal failure as a sign of election and success as a sign of compromise.[...]  

[ln t]he struggle [...] over the imposition of the legitimate mode of cultural production [...], the artists and writers who are richest in specific capital Irecognition] and most concerned for their autonomy are considerably weal<ened by the fact that some of their competitors identify their interests with the dominant principles of hierarchization and seek to impose them even within the field, with the support of the temporal powers. [...] In the struggle to impose the legitimate definition of art and literature, the most autonomous producers naturally tend to exclude 'bourgeois' writers and artists, whom they see as 'enemy agents'. [. . . ]  

The [...] definition of the writer (or artist, etc.) is an issue at stake in struggles in every literary (or artistic, etc.) field. In other words, the field of cultural production is the site of struggles in which what is at stake is the power to impose the dominant definition of the writer and therefore to delimit the population of those entitled to take part in the struggle to define the writer [or artistl.

# Nick Prior Putting c Glitch in the Field: Bourdieu, Actor Network Theory cnd Contemporqry Music/ /2OOB  

[...] Glitch has become an influential presence in music since the late 1990s and has gained credence as a contemporary form of sonic experimentation based on computer-generated clusters of rhythmic pulses, skips, clicks and scratches. Its development out of commercially-restricted scenes into more mainstream musical environments follows a logic present in Pierre Bourdieu's analysis of the chiasmatic structure of cultural fields, where the position-taking of artists is meaningful only in relation to a dynamic space of social relations governed by the twin poles of economic and cultural capital.r  

In this sense, it will be argued, we learn a lot about the social dynamics of stylistic practice from greater sensitization to its position in a structured setting of socio-economic relations partly defined by the social characteristics and position-takings of the musicians themselves. Bourdieu's cultural sociology pits itself very effectively against aesthetic writings on glitch, precisely because it refuses to cut analysis off at the stylistic boundaries of the work. But there are some outstanding questions, one of which is addressed towards the end of this article. In a context that cries out for attention to a range of agents involved in cultural production, to what extent is there room for a sufficiently complex treatment of technology under Bourdieu's corpus of ideas? [...] One possible supplementary position comes from actor network theory, a theory that treats the realm of technologies as bound to the human world in ways other than that of instruments, tools or social weapons. When technology is considered a true form of mediation, it will be argued, it is possible to extend the range of objects in Bourdieu's fields to include those devices, techniques and artefacts that permit the solidification and transformation of field relations. Despite some conceptual incommensurability, rubbing these two traditions against each other sheds light on the complex human/non-human entanglements and field trajectories of contemporary styles such as glitch. [...]  

Bourdieu's concept of field [...] provides a heuristic for the analysis of 'historically constituted areas of activity with their specific institutions and their own laws of functioning'.2 These fields consist of sets of historical relations between positions grounded in specific forms of power or capital. Conceptually, the field is an immediate invitation to think relationally about the actions of social agents who, propelled by their habituses, compete for particular values specific to that field.3 It is the interactions and conflicts between these agents over the prizes available that define the precise contours ofthe field, particularly the limits of what is found to be acceptable as the stakes in the field. In which case, the field is also a space of competition, the analogy being a game of chess where players enter the game and position themselves according to the powers and moves available to them. [... ]  

In Bourdier-r's hands, then, the field becomes a network of objective relations between agents, but also Iarger groupings and institutions distributed within a space of possible positions. Its function is not merely to describe a logic of struggle between agents, but also a grander attempt to examine how modern societies are themselves defined by an architecture ofoverlapping spheres such as artistic fields, economic fields and scientific flelds. In fact, it is the relationship that particular fields have to what Bourdieu calls the 'field of power', the broader political field, that defines their ability to resist the penetrations of outside lorces such as the market. [n the case of the cultural field, autonomy is dependent on the increasingly dualistic structure of a space defined by two logics of capital, economic and cultural. It is these species of capital that internally divide the cultural field into two sub-fields: on the one hand, the 'de-limited' sub-field of production and, on the other, the 'large-scale' or 'heteronomous' field of production. While the delimited field is defined by its distance from commercial mass marl<ets and its appeal to specialized audiences, the large-scale field is defined by its proximity to the broader field of power and economic determinants.4 Here, we might recognize the conventional opposition between 'high' and 'low' culture, and the symbolic positions occupied by avant-garde artists and commercial producers in the cultural field. [... ]  

In popular usage, the word 'glitch' has negative connotations. lt refers to mechanical error or a rogue signal present within an electronic system and is conventionally seen as a problem. While its derivation from the Yiddish'glitshn', to slip, slide or glide, suggests a physical movement, it is commonly used to describe errors in computer-based systems that result in a short electrical pulse. This meaning can be traced back to its usage by astronauts describing electrical malfunctions during the first US manned space-flight in 1962. Glitchy systems are systems prone to errors, the outcomes of which are often discernable as small audio spikes.  

It is these sounds of error and related secondary audio phenomena such as static and interference that have become used as source material lor musicians associated with the music style known as glitch. From the late 1980s, a cluster of bands such as Pan Sonic, Matmos and Oval, as well as a vast array of 'sound hackers' from Germany, Japan, the USA and elsewhere, turned to glitch as a way of creating and performing music. Drawing on the technological artefacts of error, as well as a rich history of avant-garde experimentation associated with elektronische musik and musique concrdte, these musicians compose music as a series of micro incidents - bleeps, cuts, clicks and pulses - rendered by digital techniques and tools. [...]  

It was during the 1990s that glitch really took off, however, as a steady increase in the amount of music produced under the category was matched by a visible expansion in the networks, discourses and accoutrements of glitchrelated phenomena. Not only did glitch extend the sources of error to include computer-based system crashes, clipping and distortion, but the 'scene' had developed enough of a following and presence to warrant specialist CD compilations as well as a network of independent record labels based in Germany, France and the UI(. I(ey support personnel such as critics gravitated to the category as the latest in a long line of (post)modern sonic interventions with counter-cultural connotations. Indeed, its intellectual appropriation as avantdigital deconstruction lent it the kind of leftfield gravitas so central to electronic arts lestivals and specialist academic journals [...].  

While glitch's origins in experimental art music are significant, however, its more recent dalliance with less restricted domains is also noteworthy. Just as electronica itself has become relatively normalized through channels of popular and consumer culture, so glitch has seeped into the mainstream via electronic and dance music festivals, film scores, radio airplay, as well as the odd car and mobile phone advert. Moreover, glitch bands such as Matmos, Autechre and Aphex Twin have attained a degree of popular (albeit far from superstar) appeal and coverage, and the style has very quickly crystallized into an established genre with recognizable gigs, stylistic signatures and labels - Mego, Touch, Thrill Jockey and Mille Plateaux to name just a few. [...]  

llrrs t'lrrplt,rsls on tlrt, tt,rt,llr.rl l)tovoc.ltions of glitch is common in ( onl('nrllor,rry wr ilirrlis .rtrtl clircctly nt.tps onto the relatively small gap between nrrrsiti.rns, critics rrrcl audiences.

[T]he stylistic fundaments of glitch are [...] the latest in a series of socio-biological progressions dependent on imperfections [Onl the other hand, glitch is a musico-philosophical intervention possessing a certain quality of alterity onto which are piled avant-garde aspirations towards cultural critique, shock and deconstruction.u [...] Powerful as these writings are, what is lost are the sets of social relations that make glitch-based interventions possible, as well as the broader socio-economic webs and networks that travetse them. Indeed, it is precisely because descriptive histories of glitch move us towards describing the style from within that we need to add the kinds of critical insights that Bourdieu's cultural sociology brings.  

Prima lacie, glitch fits Bourdieu's model rather well [...].  

First, while it is stretched between the two poles of production Ithat is, within the overall Field of Cultural Production (Music), glitch stretches between the restricted sub-field Avant-garde/Experimental' on the one hand, and the largescale sub-field 'Commercial Pop/Rock'on the otherl, glitch's aesthetic orientations are skewed towards the principles of the restricted sub-field. This is evident in glitch's connections with, and origins in, a rarefied world of academic computer music and audio research. In its 'pure' form, in fact, this kind of computer music stretches the limits of the possible forms of productive activity itself: that is, the limits of the field and therefore the limits of music, as it bleeds into 'sound', 'noise', 'research', and so on. Even in its less restricted forms, glitch music is aligned by critics and musicians to a kind of 'scientific approach' that yields experiments in form.6 This is not to assume that it is somehow self-referential or 'outside', but that it owes its experimental dispositions to certain structural preconditions operative in the field itself.  

Second, then, glitch's protagonists comprise a culturally-privileged fraction of specialists Iwith] high participation rates amongst graduates with humanities, music technology or sound design degrees, committed to innovation and autonomy. This commitment is made possible by the accumulated history of the field itseli including the positions occupied by previous electro-acoustic musicians - Pierre Schaeflfer, Iannis Xenakis and John Cage being notable figures. Clitch audiences, on the other hand, tend to be drawn from a similarly restricted group of young educated technophiles and aficionados with a preference for experimental art music. [...]  

Third, revered as the most recent example of sonic experimentation, glitch's aesthetic credentials are regularly delended with respect to both avant-garde practice and high theory, to the extent that critics and fans are as likely to evoke the work of Deleuze and Guattari and describe the genre as 'rhizomatic'.7 as they are to place it in the pantheon of dance music. [...] Transposable inclinations between education and experimental music are revealed in a mastery of words and concepts around discourses ofglitch. Here, the i mportance ofthe consecrating actions ofinfluential critics is essential to the positioning ofglitch as relationally distinct from mainstream pop. [...]  

Like the dense explanations accompanying contempotary art, writings on glitch are essential to its symbolic legitimacy. Liner notes, in particular, are a key site of its discursive presence, with a typical compilation bearing a dense accompaniment of essays packed with Deleuzian allusions. Notwithstanding the question of whether anyone reads these notes, their mere presence is testament to a belief among those equipped with the esoteric codes that glitch is distinct. This is why criticism is the site of an 'objective connivance'.8 between readers and critics, as the homology between the two is also a structural correspondence between the intellectual field and the readership's location within a dominant class field. [...]  

[Wlhile still part of an ever fragmenting music industry, glitch is closer to what Bourdieu calls a 'research sector',s its position secured by an opposition to the incumbents of more commercial styles of music dubbed as 'easy' or 'formulaic'. Even the physical sites of some glitch performances are telling, many becoming the staple diet of classical concert halls and avant-garde galleries. A recent performance by Ryoji Ikeda at the Sage at Gateshead (in northern England), for instance, had all the trappings of a classical sojourn for the refined cultural intelligentsia, the purpose-built concert hall graced by an audience that would not have looked out of place at a Schoenberg concert.  

Boundaries between sub-fields are not impermeable, however. lndeed, as Bourdieu himself states: 'one must be wary of establishing a clear boundary, since they are merely two poles, defined in and by their antagonistic relationship, of the same space'.ro Fourth, then, an interesting recent development has been the way glitch as a technique and style has migrated into more commercial forms of music. Both Bjdrk and Radiohead have appropriated glitchy sounds for their own works with some degree of commercial success. In the case of her 2001 album Vespertine, Bjork even went so lar as to call in the specialist glitch band Matmos for programming duties on three of her tracks, while Madonna's hit 'Don't Tell Me' (2000) contains an array of glitchy interruptions. Unsurprisingly, mainstream artists and producers have picked up on the fact that glitch carries with it bleeding-edge connotations. Just as 'cool', 'edge' and 'risk' have become commodified offshoots of the domestication of the avant-garde, so glitch is becoming one ofthe latest targets in a long succession oloutr6 styles considered fair game for appropriation. tndeed, a host of software companies are already coding glitch-making 'plug-ins' that automatically produce the sounds of computer error to order, without the musician having to slice their CDs or tinl<er with the insides of computers. This accommodation and cornrnercialization reprises the historical trajectory of vinyl scratch (itself once considered radical and annoying) from the likes of Grandmaster Flash and Christian Marclay into the pop rnainstream. [...]  

We can begin to see, then, how the field concept can 'sociologize' spheres of cultural practice in important ways. As an overall map of the terrain of culture and its dialogues with power, the field orients us to positional co-ordinates and their logics. It shows us how alliances and dilferentiations really matter in the making of movements, genres and styles [...]. It finesses our approaclr to the music world by describing how the cultural field is internally configured according to a series of associations and schisms between genres, institutions and associated personnel. It also makes good sociological sense of the preconditions of autonomy, moving us away lrom statements that affi rm the cultural 'independence' of musicians without reflecting on how this independence is actually a profound dependence on thejoint histories ofhabitus and field. As for broader, contextual issues, the field concept gives us analytical purchase on the mechanism bywhich spheres of practice like rnusic re-translate the incursions of economic and political forces. [...]  

And yet for all these benefits, there is still something missing. No concept, of course, is perfect, but cracks are beginning to show in Bourdieu's ideas.[...1 Bourdieu rarely addresses technology. [. .. ]  

Well, perhaps [there] are just missing details and oversights. After all, Bourdieu cannot be expected to cover everything. lndeed, it is entirely possible to construct a Bourdieu-inspired take on technology witl-rout too much difficulty. [. . . I In the case of glitch, for instance, we could quite easily plot how hierarchies ofcapital correspond to different choices and uses made ofparticular technologies such as software applications. This would follow a logic whereby the more popular an application is, the less likely it will be adopted in good faith by avantgardistes. We could also examine how techniques of authoring highlight dispositional consumption practices and aesthetic investments in the field: does the musician use samples from mass-produced CDs or generate their own audio material in the field? Do they use preset sounds bundled with software applications or programme their own sounds and patches? Do they use a Mac - the sine qua non of the 'culturally enlightened' - or a PC?  

These are all lines of inquiry befitting a field approach. Still, if we keep asking  

#  

these questions, we are lelt continuously rehearsing the mantra of technology as an instrumental 'badge'or a 'thing' that secures and reproduces. Technologies rarely open up, they close down; they are technical and symbolic resources, extra weapons in the game. What is missing here, I would suggest, is the texture of technology, not just in relation to the more phenomenological aspects of tweal<ing and twiddling but also to the multifarious modifications and translations that technologies afford, to their efficacy beyond reproduction, to what they make possible. [...]  

tt has been an insight of actor network theorists (ANTs) such as Bruno Latour and Michel Callon to explain the importance of non-human actors in tl.re social world. Actors such as chemicals, airbags and door knobs impose their presence in all sorts of ways that make them partners in interaction. This means that action is no longer perceived as the sole realm of the human actor, but also the realm of the non-human actor, including the technological artefact. For their presence, the world is not exactly as it was before, a positivity has been made that changes the course of events. This position adds to Howard Becl<er's notion of an 'art world'lr as collective activity the important understanding that techniques, settings and devices exchange their properties with humans. These entities comprise a cluster of elements - inanimate and animate - that might at any point add their identities and relationships into the collective.l2  

When one opens action up like this, the points of articulation and influence between a range of entities are enlarged such that 'production' becomes a full and expansive concept. lt also allows for a degree of slippage between the prescliptions encoded in the manufacture ofartefacts [...] and the unforeseen uses that these technologies end up alfording through breakdown, error and misuse. Indeed, the history of music bulges with cases that point to the unpredictable, productive and unstable: turntables as DJ instruments, monophonic bassline generators such as the Roland TB303 mis-programmed to beget acid house, telephone bandwidthsaving technologies turned into vocoders.  

Perhaps the computer itself might be a case where digital audio flexibility and the increasing availability of music software sends all sorts of lorces into the practices of music making and the inevitability of new forms and genres. After all, glitch is glitch (and not grunge, hip hop, trip hop or drum and bass) notjust because of its field position as conventionally understood by Bourdieu; notjust because of the habitus-derived uses its protagonists have made of hardware and software; but also because of these technologies themselves. That is to say, the gathering of digital objects around glitch changes not only how the music is rrade, but also what the music 'is'. The codes, the coding, the graphic user interface, the CDs, the various hardware interlaces and their design - these all rrake a difference. They do not determine the style alone, but neither are they merely a backdrop to, or weapon for, the purposeful action of the acquisitive human actor. They are objects essential to the relay of social relations in the formation of glitch to tl'le same extent as non-human objects are in the formation of all styles and genres. We might, indeed, speculate that Bourdieu fails to tackle non-human objects head on precisely because they introduce elements of presence, uncertainty and deviation into fields in a way that poses a series o[ problems to Bourdieu's own schema.  

One does violence to the intricacies of the social world when technology is framed as a passive recipient, tool or 'subset' of the habitus enacted in fields,13 (and not also an active force in those fields. [...]This recognition is importar-rt in a contemporary context where musicians enter into increasingly immersive relations with their instruments and lorm increasingly complex machine-body assemblages. Yet, throughout music history, as Antoine Hennion has shown, material devices such as scores, concert staging, acoustic treatments and musical texts have always formed an'interconnected series of mediations ... creating an irreversible movement which none of them alone would have been able to achieve'.ra [...]  

One needs to be guarded against work that claims a selfl-organized, machinic evolution and genesis of technology independent of its uses and meanings amidst social spheres of practice. This is precisely the reason why the best worl< in actor network theory alerts us to how the technical and the social are inextricably linked, in turn sensitizing us to the fact that instruments and associated devices are not passive intermediaries but active mediators. [...]  

To return to the case of glitch, then, one needs to hold together objects, trajectories and materials without losing sight of its socially organized formation in successive phases of attachment and opposition. The field clearly does set certain limits, particularly in how specific modes of operation and intervention among glitch musicians are played out, but glitch is also held together by an array of other objects which populate these relations and without which the style becomes unthinkable: transistors, electrical pulses, keyboards, software, graphic user interfaces, laptops, CDs, digital signal processing tools, the internet. It is the latter, for instance, that has been the proliferating condition of knowledge under which glitch musicians have learned the tricl<s of the trade, including how to use and abuse particular forms of software: it is an earlier breakdown in the material properties oftechnologies such as the CD and CD player that gave glitch its source materials: and it is the visual streams and blocks of MlDl data in applications such as Ableton Live, Max/MSP and AudioMulch that have enjoined the glitch musician in new modes of working.  

[...] Indeed, what better way of making sense of the way glitch represents an intermeshing of humans and technologies at one and the same time as it has accreted symbolic validity in a field of relations than to strategically deploy insights from both Bourdieu and ANTs. [...S]uch a commitment to glitch's materiality is not to ignore the position-takings of the musicians, critics and labels themselves, but to examine human and non-human materials as coproducers of the field, as heterogeneous assemblages ongoingly exchanging their properties in relatively structured settings: to open the black box oftechnology as well as the well-regulated ballet of the field.

# Niklcrs Luhmcrnn The Function of Art crnd the Differentiation of the Art System//1995  

[...]Today, systems theory is a highly developed, albeit controversial, analytical instrument. lt requires theoretical decisions that do not directly concern art. (This, of course, holds for other - for example, semiological - analyses of art as well.) In conjunction with the thesis that society is a functionally differentiated system and is in this form historically unique, a systems-theoretical orientation has further consequences. [t means that the different functional systems are treated in many respects as comparable.[...] Issues such as system formation and system boundaries, function, medium and forms, operative closure, autopoiesis, first and second-order observation, and coding and programming carr be investigated with regard to any functional system. As these investigations take shape and yield answers, a theory of society emerges that does not depend on discovering a unified meaning behind society - for example, by deriving societies from the nature of man, from a founding contract, or from an ultimate moralconsensus. Such propositions may be treated as part of the theory's subject matter, as different forms of self-description available to the system of society. What ultimately characterizes society, however, manifests itself in the comparability of its subsystems. [. . . I  

ln a domain such as art (just as for laq science, politics, and so on), we discover not unique traits of art but features that can be found, mutatis mutandis, in other functional systems as wel[ - for example, the shift to a mode of secondorder observation. Art participates in society by differentiating itself as a system, which subjects art to a logic of operative closure - just like any other functional system. [...] Modern art is autonomous in an operative sense. No one else does what it does. The societal nature of modern art consists in its operative closure and autonomy. [...]  

We base the following analyses on a distinction, namely, on the distinction between system/environment relations, on the one hand, and system/system relations, on the other. When dealing with system/environuent relations, the system constitutes the internal side of the form, whereas the environment is its unmarl<ed space. [...] ll however, we are dealing with systen'r/system relations, then the other side can be marked and indicated. ln this case, art no longer deals with'everything else' but with questions such as whether and to what extent the artist is motivated by political convenience or by wealthy cttstomers. [... ]  

What happens to art if other social domains, such as the economy, politics, or science, establish themselves as functional systems? What happens when they locus more narrowly on a special problem, begin to see everything from this perspective, and eventually close themselves off with an eye toward this problem? What is art if in fourteenth-century Florence the Medicis support art as a way of politically legitirnizing money acquired in dubiotrs ways, which they subsequently invest in consolidating their political position? What happens to art if the functionally oriented differentiation of other systems pushes society as a whole toward functional diflerentiation? Will art become the slave of other ft-rnctional systems, which dominate from now on? Or does - as indeed we shall argue - the increasing automatization of functional systems challenge art to cliscover its own function and to focus exclusively on this function? [...]  

[W]e must formulate more radically the difference that art establishes in the world. [. . . ] One might start from the assumption that art uses perceptions and, by doing so, seizes consciousness at the level of its own externalizing activity. The Iunctionofartwouldthen consistin integratingwhatis inprinciple incommunicable - namely, perception - into the communication network of society. [...] l(ant .rh'eady located the lunction of art (of the presentation of aesthetic ideas) in its c.rpacity to stimulate thinking in ways that exceed verbal or conceptual corrprehension. The art system concedes to the perceiving consciousness its own r.rnique adventure in observing artworks - and yet it makes available as communication the formal selection that triggered the adventure. [. . . I  

An independent relation between redundancy and variety characterizes pcrception. In a manner that is matched neither by thought nor by communication, lrerception presents sstonishment and recognition in a single instant. Art uses, cnhances, and in a sense exploits the possibilities ofperception in such a way that it can present the unity of this distinction. To put it differently, art permits oltservafion to oscillate between astonishment and recognition [...] for example, lly clr-rotations from other works that render repetitions at once familiar and strange 1... I However [...] the identification of repetition relies on perception rather than on conceptual abstraction. Art specializes in this problem, and this distinguishes it Ilonr ordinary elforts to cope with small irritations in everyday perception. [...]  

The work of art, then, establishes a reality of its own that differs from ordinary rr..rliry. And yet, despite the work's pelceptibility, despite its undeniable reality, it simult.rneously constitutes another reality, the meaning of which is imaginary or fictional. Art splits the world into a real world and an imaginary world in a nl.llter that resembles, and yet differs from, the use of symbols in language or Ironr the religious treatment of sacred objects and events. The function of art ( oncenrs the meaning of this split - it is not just a matter of enriching a given wollcl with firrther objects (even if they are 'beaLrtiful'). [... ]  

lre inraginary world of art offers a position from which somethingelse can be tlt,tcrn'rined as reality - as do the world of language, with its potential for misuse, or the world of religion, albeit in different ways. Without such markings of difference, the world would simply be the way it is. Only when a reality 'out there'is distinguished from fictional reality can one observe one side from the perspective ofthe other. Language and religion both accomplish such a doubling, which allows us to indicate the given world as resl. Art adds a new twist to this detour, which leads via the imagination away from and back to reality - art realizes itself in the realm of perceptible objects. Any other doubling of reality can be copied into the imaginary reality of the world of art - the doubling of reality and dream, for example, of reality and play, of reality and illusion, even of reality and art. Unlike language and religion, art is made, which implies freedoms and limitations in the choice of forms unknown to language and religion. [...]  

Only within a differentiated distinction between a real and a fictional, imagined reality can a specific relationship to reality emerge, for which art seeks different forms - whether to 'imitate' what reality does not show (its essential forms, its ideas, its divine perfection), to 'criticize' reality for wlrat it does not want to admit (its shortcomings, its 'class rule', its commercial orientation), or to affirm reality by showing that its representation succeeds, in fact, succeeds so well that creating the work of art and looking at it is a delight. The concepts imitation/critique/affirmation do not exhaust the possibilities. Another intent might address the observer as an individual and contrive a situation in which he faces reality (and ultimately himselfl) and learns how to observe it in ways he could never learn in real life. [...1  

The question might be rephrased as follows: How does reality appear when there is art?  

ln creating a double of reality from which reality can be observed, the artworl< can leave it to the observer to overcome this split - whether in an idealizing, critical or affirmative manner, or by discovering experiences of his own. Some texts are meant to be affirmative and oppose the hypercritical addiction to negativity - yet they can be read in an ironical or melancholy mode, or as mirroring one's own experiences with communication. [...] Because it embeds its forms in objects, art need not enforce a choice between consensus and dissent, or between an affirmative and a critical attitude toward reality. Art needs no reasonable justification, and by unfolding its power of conviction in the realm of perceptible objects, it demonstrates this. The 'pleasure' afforded by the artwork, according to traditional doctrine, always also contains a hint of malicious joy, indeed of scorn, directed against the vanity of seeking access to the world through reason. [... ]  

An independently developed sense of lorm in art leads to gains in autonomy, especially when art develops its own dynamics and begins to react to itself. [...] Everyday lile becomes worthy of art, and what used to be significant is subjected to distorting misrepresentations. [...] Common values were not just negated or turned on their head; they were neutralized and rejected as distinctions for the sake of demonstrating possibilities of order that had nothing to do with them. [.. . I Against these trends, art developed procedures and principles of its own - novelty, obscurity, style-consciousness, and eventually a self-description that thematizes the various artistic genres and sets them apart from the new rationalism. [... I  

In the twentieth century, one encounters artworks that seek to cancel the difference between a real and an imagined reality by presenting themselves in ways that mal<e them indistinguishable from real objects. [...] No ordinary object insists on being taken for an ordinary thing, but a work that does so betrays itself by this very effort. The function ofart in such a case is to reproduce the diflerence of art. But the mere fact that art seeks to cancel this difference and fails in its effort to do so perhaps says more about art than could any excuse or critique. Here, what we learn to observe is the inevitable and ineradicable rule of difierence. [...]  

Unlike philosophy, art does not search for islands of security from which other experiences can be expelled as fantastic or imaginary, or rejected as a world of secondary qualities or enjoyment, of pleasure or common sense. Art radicalizes the difference between the real and the merely possible in order to show through works o[ its own that even in the realm of possibility there is order after all. [... ]  

Within the gravitational field of its function, modern art tends to experiment witlr formal means. The word/ormal here does not refer to the distinction, which at first guided modern art, between form and matter or form and content, but to the characteristics ofan indicating operation that observes, as iffrom the corner ol its eye, what happens on the other side of form. ln this way, the work o[ art points the observer toward an observation of form. This may have been what was rreant by the notion 'autotelic'. However, the social function of art exceeds the lrere reconstruction ofobservational possibilities that are potentially present in tlre work. Rather, it consists in demonstrsting the compelling forces of order in the realm of thepossible. [... ]  

Art raises the question of whether a trend toward 'morphogenesis' might be irrplied in any operational sequence, and whether an observer can observe at all except with reference to an order - especially when observing observations.  

From this perspective, the formal complexity a work is capable of achieving becomes a crucial, indeed, the decisive variable. Whatever functions as the other side of, a florm requires decisions about further forms that generate other sides of their own, which raises the problem of how much variety the work's recursive irrtegrity can accommodate and l<eep under control. [...] Contrary to widely held notions, the function of art is not (or no longer) to represent or idealize the world, nor does it consist in a 'critique' of society. Once art becomes autonomous, the cmplrasis shifts from hetero-reference to sell-reference - which is not the same .rs self-isolation, not I'ort pour l'orf. Transitional formulations of this type are understandable. But there is no such thing as self-reference (form) without hetero-reference. And when art displays a self-positing order in the medium of perception or imagination, it calls attention to a logic of reality which expresses itself not only through the real but also in fictional reality. Within the difference real/fictional reality, the unity of the world (the unity o[ this difference) escapes observation by presenting itselfl as the order of the distinction's form.  

Art has no ambition to redeem society by exercising aesthetic control over an ever-expanding realm of possibility. Art is merely one of society's functional systems, and even though it may harbour universalistic ambitions, it cannot seriously wish to replace all the other systems or force these systems under its authority. The functional primacy of art holds exclusively for art. This is why, protected by its operative closure, art can focus on its own function and observe, from within ever-expanding boundaries, the realm of possibility with an eye toward fitting form combinations. [...]  

When Hegel speaks of the end ol art [. .. ] he can mean only one thing: art has lost its immediate relation to society and worldly affairs and must henceforth acknowledge its own differentiation. Art can still claim universal competence for almost everything, but it can do so only cs crf and only on the basis of a specific mode of operation that follows its own criteria.  

The notion that art, as represented by artists, can find a knowledgeable and sympathetic counterpart somewhere else in society must be sacrificed as well. A supporting context - if this is what one is looking for - is no longer available. A model based on complementary roles for artists and connoisseurs can no longer represent the couplings between the art system and society. Rather, it represents the dilferentiation of art as communication in society. The interaction between artists, experts and consumers differentiates itself as communication, and it tal<es place only in the art system, which establishes and reproduces itself in this manner. What romanticism called 'art criticism' is integrated into the art system as a'medium of reflection', and its tas[< is to complete the artist's work. [...]What it actually reflected upon, however, is the autonomy imposed upon art - the functional differentiation of society. [... ]  

The differentiation ofthe art system - a process characterized simultaneously by continuity and discontinuity - allows the relation between system and environment to be reintroduced into the system in the lorm of a relationship between self-reference and hetero-reference. As we recall, there can be no selfreference without hetero-reference, for it is not clear how the self can be indicated if it excludes nothing. When the unity of self-reference and heteroreference becomes an issue, searching for the common denominator in the meaning of reference suggests itself: what is the reference of 'reference'? [...]  

Depending on how the relationship between selfl-reference and lreteroreference is applied, we shall distinguish an art that is primarily symbolic from an art that thinl<s of itself as a stgn, and we shall further distinguish an art that specializes in experimenting with/orm combinations. Prior to its differentiation, art was considered symbolic if it searched for a higher meaning in its condensed ornamental relationships.ln the course of the court- and market-oriented phases of its differentiation, art turned into a sign. The sign, by virtue of what was believed to be its objective reference, stood for what the artist, the connoisseur and the lover of art had in common. But once the differentiation of this community was realized as communication, the only remaining option was to observe the continuaI balancing between self-reference and hetero-reference in the operations of the art system. Under these conditions, one finds the nexus between self- and hetero-reference in the/ormal combinstions of artworks that facilitate an observation of observations. [...]

[...] The paradox inherent to surveillance phenomena is well known. The attractiveness of problems of paradox, however, earns a very positive estimation in Niklas Luhmann's perspective, whereas repressing and avoiding paradoxes does not really help us out of the pitfalls with which they are connected. Paradoxes emerge [.. . I when the conditions of possibility of an operation are also the conditions of its impossibility. Paradoxes are problems par excellence for every observer, but not necessarily for the operations of observation, which instead experience a dynamization by means of paradoxes. This dynamic makes paradoxes apparently productive, but what do we gain from them besides the confusion we know all too wel[? 'The conventional answer seems to be: exercise of wit.'l And how can wit and understanding be sharpened and trained? The exercise is 'to deframe and reframe the frame of normal thinking, the frame of common sense.'2 The communication of paradoxes fixes attention on the lrames of common sense, frames that normally go unattended. If this is the function then it will not surprise us that deframing again needs its own frames.' Art appears to be predestined [...] for this task of multifaceted framing and destabilization. Indeed, art is capable of enabling experiments with reality and even with the way in which we perceive this reality. With a reflexive turn, it allows for perceptions about how we perceive reality. Seen ambitiously, as is usual in the tradition of modernity, art should still be conceived of autonomously, which frees it from tasks imposed from the outside, no matter how useful or sublime. It is one of the strengths of Luhmann's theory of art that it conceives of art as autonomous and at the same time as a socially and historically constituted phenomenon. All sub-systems of society are autonomous, according to Luhmann; otherwise they would not be able to differentiate themselves as sub-systems. [...] The characteristics ofobservation that I will outline are relevant to areas of (as well as beyond) art. They have this in common with the phenomena of surveillance, which can be located in aesthetic contexts as well as in other areas, taking on various roles according to the situation.  

Besides the strict separation of psychical and social systems, and the result that society does not consist of psychical systems but rather of communication, Luhmann's theory has us believe that observations are not directly communicable and communication, no matter what kind, is not directly observable. Of course, Ithel specialized notions of 'communication' and 'observation' used here warrant further explanation [...]. Indeed, this point is already a demonstration of the ideological potential - one almost wants to say that it is determined by Zeitgeist and culture - of surveillance phenomena and methods, especially when they are working with technological means like photography, video and audio recording. The technological medium produces something that is generally accepted as a means of providing evidence. In this mediatized condition, observations are apparently directly translatable and exchangeable - but only apparently. The more the inner connective energies of societies are conceived of in dissolution, the more emphatic the power of proof and the violence of (producing) evidence ol these apparently exchangeable observations are becoming. Yet we do not want to get ahead of ourselves here, since Luhmann's concept of 'medium' is linked to a concept of '[orm', and it is not subsumed in the generally accepted definition of 'medium', which is usually only considered in the technological sense. [...1  

The general assumption of this essay is that every kind of surveillance is necessarily linked with observation. Put negatively: no surveillance can occur without the execution of operations of observation. This somewhat unspectacular assertion Imakesl clear that every act of surveillance necessarily produces its opposite. Surveillance and observation result in something that one can call a 'blind spot' analogous to that of the eye; the blind spot is something that surveillance and observation cannot see, cannot observe, for systematic reasons. [...] The indissoluble double gesture of revealing and concealing, veiling and apparently unveiling, has a paradoxical quality [...1. In order for something to be made observable at all, other things - certain fields that are ambiguously linked to observation and organize it in a certain way - drop out of the same observation. In brief, the paradox emerges that by means of producing something (an observation), we unwillingly also produce its opposite (concealing). What results lrom this for the plethora of surveillance phenomena and their effects is a not insignificant question. The fact that totalitarian fantasies of surveillance, dreaming of complete transparency, have also to observe themselves, thereby rendering themselves opaque, is the irony and paradox of the field outlined here. And it is hardly sufficient to downplay Recl-political phenomena of this kind as an 'irony of history'.  

When a second observer sees what the first one does not see - thus, when he observes an observer observing - this is called second-order observation. This observation of observation sees 'what the observer sees and how he sees what he sees. lt even sees what the observed observer does not see, and sees that he does not see what he does not see.'3 But in order to see all of that, the secondorder observation has to use a distinction that remains invisible to it, since only by means of this distinction is it able to observe what it observes. ln terms of this operatively applied distinction, a second-order observation is also a first-order observation, which also results in a paradox, since it is simultaneously something and something else. 'Each Iobserver] observes what he is capable of on the basis of his own paradox, invisible to himself, and based on a distinction whose unity is inaccessible to his observation.'a  

Here observation is conceived not in terms of the human being but rather systemically, 'highly abstractly and independently of the material substrate, the infrastructure or the specific manner of observation." [. .. I  

An observer can observe it/himself observing, just not simultaneously; the observer must use an operation of higher-order observation, and then the latter is unobservable. [.. . ] The observer observes himself as another.  

This point is also foregrounded by Peter Weibel's closed-circuit video installation Beobachtung der Beobachtung: Unbestimmtheit (Observing Observation: Uncertainty) (1973), in which the observer, located in the inner space of observation,'can never see Ihim or herselfl from the front, no matter how much Ithe observer] twists and turns'.6  

The three cameras airned at lrim/her and the monitors connected to them systematically prevent the viewer lrom seeirrg a front view of himself/herself in the monitor. This calculated effect of the view of oneself from behind is constructed by the arrangement of the cameras and uronitors, and it becomes especially apparent when the observer moves within the installation in order to escape being trapped in tl.ris rear view, which is, however, not possible. And all of this may become the 'subject' for observers and observations o[ second order and higher order that still are part of the installation, even more so when they are not located/taking place in the inner sphere. [...]  

By neans of second-order cybernetics, Luhmann is able to explain that 'operations of, "subjects" olten are best understood when one considers them to be induced by observation, thus, brought about when the observed object itself is functioning as an observer. The distinction subject/object is thus implemented neither naturally nor transcendental-theoretically via self-reflection of the consciousness, but rather it is a distinction that is testing itself in the praxis of observatior.r; it can be applied not only to humans but also to animals and social systems, and perhaps even to electronic machines, whenever the complicated tvvo-part operation of observing observers succeeds.'] l. ..1

# Bruno Latour Some Experiments in Art cnd Pelitics//20lI  

The word 'networl<' has become a ubiquitous designation for technical inlrastructures, social relations, geopolitics, mafias and, of course, our new lile online. But networks, in the way they are usually drawn, have the great visual delect of being 'anaemic' and 'anorexic', in the words ol philosopher peter Sloterdijk, who has devised a philosophy of spheres and envelopes. Unlike networl<s, spheres are not anaemic, not just points and links, but complex ecosystems in wllich forms of life define their 'immunity' by devising protective walls and inventing elaborate systems olair conditioning. Inside those artificial spheres of existence, through a plocess sloterdUk calls 'anthropotechnics', humans are born and raised. The two concepts o[ networks ancl spheres are clearly in contradistinction to one another: while rretworks are good at describing long-distance and unexpected connections starting from local points, spheres are useful lor describing local, fragile and complex 'atmospheric colrditions' - another of sloterdijk's terms. Networl<s are good at stressing edges and movements; spheres at highlighting envelopes and wombs.  

of course, both notions are indispensable lor registering the originality of wlrat is called 'globalization', an empty term that is unable to define lrom which localities, and through which connections, the'global' is assumed to act. Most people who enjoy speaking of the 'global world' live in nanoW provincial confines with [ew connections to other equally provincial abodes in far away places. Acaden-ria is one case. So is wall Street. one thing is certain: the globalized world has no'globe'inside which it could reside. As for Gaia, the goddess of the Earth, we seem to have great difficulty housing her inside our global view and even more difficulty housing ourselves inside her complex cybernetic feedbacks. ll is the globe that is most absent in the era of globalization. Bad luck: when we had a globe during the classical age of discoveries and empire, there was no globalization; and now that we have to absorb truly global problems ...  

# Saraceno's Galaxies Forming along Filaments  

so how can we have both networl<s and spheres? How do we avoid tl-re pitfalls of a globalization that has no real globe in which to place everything? ln a work presented at the Venice Biennale in 2009, Tomds Saraceno provided a great, and no doubt unintended, metaphor lor social theory. ln an entire room inside tl-re lliennale's mair.r pavilion , cala.xies Forming along Filaments, Like Droplets along the strands of a spider'sweb (2oo8) consisted oIcarefully mounted elastic connectors that produced the shape of networl<s and spheres. [f you were to avoid the guards' attentive gaze and slightly shal<e the elastic connectors - strictly forbidden - your action would reverberate quickly through the links and points of the network paths, but much more slowly through the spheres. This is not to say that spheres are made from different stufl as if we must choose between habitation and connection, between local and global, or indeed between Sloterdijk and, let's say, actor-network theory. What Saraceno's work of art and engineering reveals is that multiplying the connections and assembling them closely enough will shift slowly frorn a networl< (which you can see through) to a sphere (difficult to see through). Beautifully simple and terribly efficient. [...]  

Saraceno performed precisely the task of philosophy according to Sloterdijk, namely of explicating the material and artificial conditions flor existence. The tasl< is not to overthrow but to mal<e explicit. 1...1 Calaxies Forming along Filaments allows those who try to redescribe the loose expression of globalization to explore new concepts. Instead ofhaving to choose between networks and spheres, we can have our cake and eat it too. There is a principle of connection - a kind of movement overlooked by the concepts of networks and spheres alil<e - that is able to generate, in the hands of a clever artist, both networks and spheres; a certain topology of knots that may thread the two types of connectors in a seamless web.  

More interesting still is the theory of envelopes - the concept implied by this percept. In this proposition, walls or qr-rasi-walls are supported by both external and lateral linl<ages. Again, we all l<now, or should know, that identities - the walls - are made possible only through the double movement of connecting distant anchors and stitclring together local nodes. lf yor-r believe that there are independent bubbles and spheres that can sustain themselves, you are clearly forgetting the whole technology of envelopes. But it is one thing to say it, lor instance in political philosophy - that no identity exists without relations with the rest of the world - and it is quite another to be reminded visuclly and experientially of the way tlris could be done.  

Standing in the middle of Saraceno's work, the experience is inescapable: the very possibility of having an envelope around a local habitat is given by the length, number and solidity of the connectors that radiate out in all directions. I would have loved to see, when the exhibition was dismantled, how quickly the spherical patterns would have collapsed once a few of their outside links had been severed. A powerful lesson for ecology as well as for politics: the search for identity 'inside' is directly linked to the quality of the 'outside' connection - a useful remindel at a time when so many groups clamour for a solid identity that would'resist globalization', as they say. As if being local and having an identity could possibly be severed from alterity and connection.  

Anotlrer remarkable feature of Saraceno's work is that such a visual experience is not situated in any fixed ontological domain, nor at any given scale: you can tal<e it, as I do, as a model for social theory, but you could just as well see it as a biological interpretation of the threads that hold the walls and components of a cell, or, more literally, as the weaving of some monstrously big spider, or the utopian projection of galactic cities in 3-D virtual space. This is very important if you consider that all sorts of disciplines are now trying to cross the old boundary that has, until now, distinguished the common destiny of increasing numbers of humans and non-humans. No visual representation of humans as such, separated from the rest of their support systems, mal<es any sense today. This was the primary motive for sloterdijk's notion of spheres, as well as for the development of actor-network theory; in both cases the idea was simultaneously to modify the scale and the range of phenomena to be represented, so as to renew what was so badly packaged in the old nature/society divide. If we have to be connected with climate, bacteria, atoms and DNA, it would be great to learn about how those connections could be represented.  

The other remarl<able feature of the work is that although there are many local orderings - including spheres within spheres - there is no attempt at nesting all relations within one hierarchical order. There are many local hierarchies, but they are linked into what appears visually as a heterarchy. Local nesting, yes; global hierarchy, no. For me, this is a potent attempt at shaping today's political ecology - by extending former natural forces to address the human polltical problem of forming livable communities. [... I  

To thinl< in these terms is to find a way to avoid modernism - in which case the hierarchy moves from bigger to smaller elements from a central point - but also to avoid, if I dare say, postmodernism - in wbich case there would be no local hierarchies and no homogeneous principle by which to establish the connections (in this case the elastic tensors that provide the language for the whole piece). For me, that is the beauty of saraceno's work: it gives a sense of order, legibility, precision and elegant engineering, and yet has no hierarchical structure. It is as if there were a vague possibility of retaining modernism's feeling of clarity and order, but freed lrom its ancient connection with hierarchy and verticality.  

# Who Owns Space and Time?  

To explore the artistic, philosophical and political questions raised by Saraceno's work, it might be useful to turn to another locus classicus - not the sphere versus networl< debate, but the debate over who owns the space in which we live collectively. There is no better way to frame this question than the bungled dialogue [...]between Henri Bergson and Albert Einstein in paris in 1922. After Bergson spoke lor thirty minr-rtes, Einstein made a terse two-minute remarl<, ending with this damning sentence: 'Hence there is no philosopher's time; there is only a psychological time different from the time of the physicist.' While Bergson had argued that his notion of space and time had a cosmological import that was to be carelully meshed within Einstein's remarl<able discoveries, Einstein argued that there was only one time and space - that of physics - and tlrat what Bergson was after was nothing more than subjective time - that of psychology. We recognize here the classical way for scientists to deal with phitosophy, politics and art: 'What you say might be nice and interesting but it has no cosmological relevance because it only deals with the subjective elements, the lived world, not the real world.' [...]  

Can we do better at the beginning of the twenty-first century? In other words, is it possible to give Bergson another chance to make his case that, no, he is not talking about subjective time and space, but is rather proposing an alternative to Einstein's cosmology? To explore such a possibility, I decided to rely on the fascinating genre of the reenactment. As many artists have shown, especially Rod Dicl<inson in the amazing staging of Milgram's experiment, reenactmenI is not a mere facsimile of the original but a second version, or a second print of the first instance, allowing for the exploration of its originality. This is why, in a series of lectures at the Centre Pompidou inJune 2010, I invited, among many others, the artist Olafur Eliasson and two scholars, a historian of science, Jin-rena Canales, and a philosopher, Elie During, to reenact the famous debate by allowing the conclusion to shift somewhat, thus reopening a possibility that had been closed in the twentieth century.  

Who owns the concepts of space and time? Artists? Philosophers? Scientists? Do we live in the space-tirne of Einstein without realizing it, or, as Bergson vainly argued, does Einsteirr, the physicist, live in the tirne of what Bergson called duration? Those questions, it seemed to me, were just as important for physicists, historians, and philosophers as they are for an artist like Eliassotl, who has populated museums and cities around the world by publicly demonstrating, through many artful connections between science, technology and ecology, that there are many alternatives to the visual expefience of common sense. The art form - or forum - that I chose consisted ofasking the three ofthem to conjoin their lorces in presenting fihrs and photographs to set the stage for this famous debate, with Eliasson 'refereeing' the debate through his own worl<.  

It may seem silly to ask an artist to adjudicate a debate between a philosopher and a physicist - especially a debate whose pecking order had been historically settled once and for all: the physicist speal<s of the real world, and the philosopher 'does not understand physics'; the artist is irrelevant here. But that was precisely the point, a point shared by Saraceno's heterarchy: that it is now possible to complicate the hierarchy of voices and rnal<e the conversation between disciplines rnove ahead in a way that is more representative of the twenty-first century than of the twentieth. No discipline is the final arbiter of any other.  

That is exactly what Elie During did in a brilliant piece of philosophical fiction in which he entirely rewrote the 1922 dialogue as if Einstein had actually paid attention to what Bergson had told him. In the end, 'Zweistein' - that is, the Einstein of 2010 - was not, of course, convinced (that would have been a falsification, and no longer a fiction), but he had to admit that there might be more philosophy in his physics than he had claimed in 1922. So now we have a more balanced situation: the space and time in which we live - experientially, phenomenologically - might not be a mere mistake of our subjective self, but might have some relevance for what the world is really like. Instead of accepting tlie divide between physics and philosophy, this reenactment was a means of answering Allred North Whitehead's lamous question: 'When red is four-rd in nature, what else is found there also?' Lil<ewise, is it possible to imagine a world where scientific knowledge is able to add to the world instead of dismissing the experience of being in the world? [...]

# Editor's acknowledgements  

Although I have tried to be inclusive and equitable, tlris book, lil<e any arrtlrology, is partial and idiosyncratic. Any shortcomings reflect the limits of my own lcrowl('(lti(' and the lack of scholarly litelature on the topic. This volume would have anrounl('(l to much less without the excellent 'nuggets' of feedback and flar-r'c..rrlrirr1,, discussions generated in tlie DXARTS Systems seminar that I led at the UnivcrsitV of Washingtonin2}T4,which pushed my own thinking about the topic. I .rnr nrost glateful to Roy Ascott, who introduced me to cybernetics twenty years.1go.ilt(l also to David Dunn and Cristina Cogdell, whose suggestions enriched the book. Special thanl<s to my research assistantJoelOng, who made invaluable contrillutions to all aspects of the project and to lan Farr, who entrusted the volume [o ure.rrrcl nurtured its development with unening certainty and unwavering support.

SYSTEMs In the 1960s many artists,composers,musicians and architects began to embrace open systems that emphasize organism over mechanism,dynamic processes of interaction among elements,and the participant's role as an inextricable part of aesthetic experience. This anthology traces this radical shift from its roots in systems and information theories,cybernetics and artificial intelligence to current cutting-edge science. It also explores the ways in which systems-based art projects can create self-generating entities and networks,alter our experience of time,change the configurations of social relations,cross cultural borders,and interact with threatened ecosystems.  

Systems is one of a series documenting major themes and ideas in contemporary art
