# Documents of Contemporary Art  

In recent decades artists have progressively expanded the boundaries of art as they have sought to engage with an increasingly pluralistic environment. Teaching, curating and understanding of art and visual culture are likewise no longer grounded in traditional aesthetics but centred on significant ideas, topics and themes ranging from the everyday to the uncanny, the psychoanalytical to thepolitical.  

The Documents of Contemporary Art series emerges from this context. Each volume focuses on a specific subject or body of writing that has been of key influence in contemporary art internationally. Edited and introduced by a scholar, artist,criticor curator,each of thesesourcebooksprovides access toa plurality ofvoices andperspectives defining asignificant theme or tendency.  

For over a century theWhitechapel Galleryhasoffered apublicplatformfor artandideas.Inthesamespirit,eachguesteditorrepresentsa distinctyetdiverse approach - rather than one institutional position or school of thought - and has conceivedeachvolume to address notonlya professional audience but all interestedreaders.

# Sarah Cook Introduction//The Message is the Medium  

In 2010 artist Aram Bartholl embedded a USB stick into a brick wall on 21st Street, New York. This, the first of his 'dead drops', was a gesture that recognized the three key stages in the life of information and its use as a material or medium for art: its storage, transmission and reception. The USB stick had one file on it, a readme.txt which explained what a dead drop was: 'an anonymous, offline, peer-to-peer filesharing network' in which users are invited to plug in their laptops and share files.2 The nub of the project, of course, is where the dead drop is, and how that location is noted. Bartholl's dead drop within the group exhibition 'Talk to Me' at the Museum of Modern Art later that year was indicated by an object label, arguably undermining the artist's intent that these drop sites are happened upon in the hybrid, networked spaces of everyday life. But MoMA had to be protected against infringement of copyright laws or other legal wrangles about being the distributor or broadcaster of information that may be slanderous, confidential, and so on.  

Dead drops are a small gesture compared to the actions of Chelsea Manning and the WikiLeaks ‘data dump' in November 2010, Edward Snowden and the global surveillance disclosures published in June 2013, or the Panama papers (11.5 million documents about offshore banking) in April 2016; but they come from a similar place: that old adage that information wants to be free.3 Here we don't mean free of charge but free from corporate control and vested interests. So where information is free, where information resides (in what register), is a key concern that many of the texts here seek to elucidate. Is it in an archive? A cloud (essentially another person's computer)? Is it encrypted? Artists have consistently drawn attention to the occurrence and location of information, most often through interfering with the stages of its processing or mediation via transmission and reception.4  

The late media theorist Friedrich Kittler noted that in addition to an understanding of the mediating technologies of information - such as typewriters and telephones - one also needs to consider the systems that enable this mediation - the postal service, the software.  

All libraries are discourse networks, but all discourse networks are not books. In the second industrial revolution, with its automation of the streams of information, the analysis of discourses has yet to exhaust the forms of knowledge and power. Archaeologies of the present must also take into account data storage,transmission and calculation in technological media.5  

Kittler also emphasized that the control of those systems - what Alex Galloway and Eugene Thacker in The Exploit: A Theory of Networks (2007) refer to as protocols - is something to pay attention to and interrogate:  

Information networks can be described only when they are contrasted with one another. The source, sender, channel, receiver and drain of streams of information, [Claude] Shannon's five functions, in other words,6 can be occupied or left vacant by various agents: by men or women, rhetoricians or writers, philosophers or psychoanalysts, universities or technical institutes. Whereas interpretation works with constants, the comparison between systems introduces variables.?  

This book asks what information is, and how the varied practices of artists have explored information as more than just material for art (as process, as method). Its five sections are organized thematically around the life cycle of information, addressing the (im )materiality of information as it occurs in our environment, the ways in which artists transmit and receive information as art, and how overwhelming it can be to navigate these new milieus, socially and politically. The book takes as a given the philosopher Luciano Floridi's claim that we are living the effects of a fourth revolution (as a consequence of the work of Alan Turing) and that 'we are not stand-alone and unique entities, but rather informationally embodied organisms (inforgs), mutually connected and embedded in an informational environment, the infosphere, which we share with both natural and artificial agents similar to us in many respects.s Of course, the exercise of editing an anthology about information and art, in which information about art is excerpted, has been somewhat of a 'metatask'. As Markus Krajewski notes in Paper Machines: About Cards and Catalogues, 1548-1929:  

... the excerpt is a pointer that also refers to something else - and presumably not just to what is essential. However, excerpting alone does not make a collection of a specific productive strength. What is the use of the most painstaking copy if it cannot be brought into productive relation with other entries? What is the use of several pages of excerpts if they do not enter into a network of connections? In isolation, every index card is in peril of becoming a data corpse; to live, it must enter into relations with the remaining content. Thus, what single slips of paper require is cross-referencing. For only by means of cross-references do the disparate single entries, fed in at different times, constitute a web of evident relations, whether consciously drawn by the user or unconsciously put together by the machine.  

This book aims to provide a survey of art beyond information theory (understood as beginning with Claude Shannon's 1948 article A Mathematical Theory of  

Communication'), but any such fixed perspective is challenged by our constantly changing infosphere with its potential for endless cross-referencing. Due to the series focus on the artist's voice, it excludes texts on media and language (by theorists such as Vilém Flusser, Manuel Castells, Noam Chomsky, James Beniger, Lisa Gitelman) and those on biology and environmental concerns (such as those of biosemiotician Marcello Barbieri), both key areas for future work. The excerpt from Robin Mansell's The Information Society points to other writing in the field of sociology and communication studies, and readers are urged to follow these leads, alongside Floridi's work, and James Gleick's accessible The Information: A History, A Theory, A Flood (2011). There was also insufficient space to represent areas such as experimental music, dance and poetry; live or performance practices beyond their role within Fluxus (see Craig Saper in section 1); and to reproduce software code-based works. I hope a future volume on instruction or the score might redress this.  

# ... what we mean by information - the elementary unit of information - is a difference which makes a difference ... -GregoryBateson9  

Curators of information have often adopted the predominant  theoretical perspective that information should be differentiated from messages, signals or data. When London's Science Museum replaced its Shipping Gallery (installed in 1964 and devoted to the maritime heritage of the British Empire) with one about the Information Age, it rewrote the history of telecommunications to consider the infrastructure of networks, and technological advances in their components that allow information to be transmitted and received, from wire to code. This emphasis on infrastructure is welcome, as our unquestioning use of communication technologies has often blinded us to the differences between them.  

The dependence of information on the occurrence of syntactically well-formed data, and of data on the occurrence of differences variously implementable physically, explains why information can so easily be decoupled from its support. The actual format, medium and language in which data, and hence information, are encoded is often irrelevant and hence disregardable. In particular the same data/ information may be printed on paper or viewed on a screen, codified in English or in some other language, expressed in symbols or pictures, [and may] be analogue or digital.(Floridi)io  

However, for decades many artists have disputed the notion that data or signals are not already information, and have explored varied practices of abstracting.  

manipulating, exposing, visualizing, sonifying, relocating or embodying data, in order to make messages into information, to make them meaningful in alternative ways. Thus it would seem that the support on which information depends can then be analysed in a different register, and artists can disagree with theorists of information as to whether or not the form of information is the most important thing about it. Is the medium the message?  

To further complicate these different readings of what matters most about information itself, information theory also teaches the differences between types of information irrespective of their structural manifestations: environmental or semantic; instructional (which can not be true/false) versus factual (which must be true/false); false information (not really information at all, though if the message's content is false it is called misinformation) and disinformation (when the source of the message knows that the message's content is false and intentionally transmits it anyway). As Floridi writes, The difference between information in Shannon's sense and semantic information is comparable to the difference between a Newtonian description of the physical laws describing the dynamics of a tennis game and the description of the same game as a Wimbledon final by a commentator." Artists have long concerned themselves with the intricacies of these differences, and increasingly, it would seem, with instructional information - whether in their own process or in the shifting of agency, giving control over the transmission and reception of the information to the viewer. "Instructional information is not about a situation, a fact, or a state of affairs, and does not model, or describe, or represent. Rather it is meant to (contribute to) bring about [a situation, a fact, or a state of affairs].'12 Here perhaps we can come to a different, ICT-induced understanding of the artistic act, of action-based art, or even of relational aesthetics in a post-medium art landscape.  

# ... there is nothing more wonderful than a list, instrument of wondrous hypotyposis  

--Umberto Eco13  

As with all taxonomies that arise in the parsing of one kind of information from another, and one kind of art practice or movement from another, it makes sense to start with a list - of artists who write lists as art; others who publish lists as art; or who cross-reference lists in database form as art; or point in their art to what is missing in the lists others have made. This book thus owes its greatest debt to Lucy Lippard - both her curatorial work (wherein exhibition catalogues were envelopes of index cards -metadata to the art's data) and her 1973 publication Six Years: The Dematerialization of the Art Object..., the ultimate in curatorial lists (with a list for its title) recording chronologically the emergence of varied practices that concerned themselves with the communication of data and the processing (mediation) of information, as both the concept of the work and its manifestation. Joseph Kosuth's index-card catalogue entry for his work (comprising four telegrams) in Lippard's 1970 exhibition '955,000' at Vancouver Art Gallery reads:  

JOSEPHKOSUTH,NEWYORKCITY   
THEFIFTHINVESTIGATION'1969   
(FROM THE SERIES, BEGUN IN 1966, SUBTITLED 'ART AS IDEA AS IDEA')  

THESE INVESTIGATIONS HAVE HAD FOUR CONCERNS:  

A.CONCEPTASART(ASIDEA)   
B.INFORMATIONASART(ASIDEA)   
C.VISUALEXPERIENCEASART (ASIDEA)   
D.INVESTIGATION OF CHANCE FOR NON-COMPOSITIONAL PRESENTATION.  

THE WORK IN THIS EXHIBITION IS RELATED TO CONCERN A' (CONTEXT ASCONCEPT).  

THE FORM OF PRESENTATION (LABELS) IS IRRELEVANT TO THE ART.  

Lippard's book is a seemingly unbiased list of activities, giving no more schrift to Kynaston McShine's exhibition Information' at MoMA, New York, in 1970 than to 'Visions, Projects, Proposals' at the Nottingham Festival in England, organized by the Midland Group Gallery the same year and including a number of the same artists. Information', with its critical reviews, is the obvious historical touchstone for curatorial practice as information management, but is that because so little documentation remains of many other shows of the time? Future historians of today's information-based art, take note.  

'Information' brought together irrelevant' forms of presentation (concepts as art) that were at the forefront of practice in the 1960s and 70s, including conceptualism, land art, earthworks, systems-based art and Arte Povera. Yet it nevertheless marks a rupture in the history of information art. While some artists' works were accessioned into the art-historical canon, others - those more concerned with computer networks, for example, abstracting rather than representing the system - were 'ghettoized’ and little considered in the art mainstream until  the   widespread  adoption  of computer  information technologies (and the most accessible information machine - the browsable Web) inthe early 2000s.  

Les Levine's 1971 review of 'Information' in Studio International (excerpted in section 1) is eerily prescient:  

Instead of taking a work of art, which if it were translated would present an aspect of life or decode as a particular concern, we merely take the direct working situation and present it (documented) as the work.... this is information art. I... I In a city, where people have answering services, instead of talking to people directly, the technology talks to the technology. You phone a person, his answering service answers. You leave a message. The technology is making the decision and the people are sitting around on the sidelines. One computer is talking to another computer. One telephone is talking to another telephone. One television is talking to another television. Humans are merely looking at it once in a while to see what the result of all this activity is and deciding what they should do with it.14  

Another anticipatory moment was the formation of Art Metropole, Toronto, in 1974 by the artist group General Idea (AA Bronson, Felix Partz and Jorge Zontal), with the aim of it being the collection agency devoted to the documentation, archiving and distribution of all of the images. Art Metropole intends to keep abreast of the tide, housing and distributing evidence of activity and imagery: magazines, publications, videos, correspondence, snapshots, memories and the ephemeral flood. (FILE, December 1973). They also may as well have been describing the Internet, some twenty years before the emergence of web-based art practices. Having launched FILE Megazine (sic) in 1972, General Idea was at the forefront of the so-called information revolution, using publishing, the postal service, fax machines, video and the possibilities of greater international travel to participate in expanding networks of artists, exhibitors and distributors of art. General Idea's intention with Art Metropole was, curatorially speaking, to do what most of us engaged in contemporary art and social media do today - manage the processing and circulation of information, its move from private to public and back again, whether that information is visual or textual.  

The differences in information art's forms are tied to the accessibility of new technologies, with ideas sent via telephone superseded by those broadcast to screens via satellite, and so on. For information art, the message is itself the medium, and the medium is the message, in an endless feedback loop.  

# Information devours its own content -Jean Baudrillard15  

Suddenly, information - already and always everywhere, as Warhol pointed out - was everywhere. As of the early 1960s, Conceptual artists dug into its systems, its patterns, its brute force. Following Warhol, they were drawn to the raw blankness of information, which they saw as a powerful opponent to the tyranny of 'content': art matters because it is, not because it is about something. Moving beyond the Warholian sphere  

of celebrity and popular culture, however,these artists shifted toward Wittgensteinian philosophy and considered the fundamental rawness and blankness of language, perception and knowledge, and what it all had to do with art. Mel Bochner presented a space's measurements; lan Burn photocopied one hundred blank pages; Ed Ruscha catalogued every building on Sunset Strip; and On Kawara's One Million Years literally refers to and encompasses all the information known to man.   
-AnthonyHuberman16  

Before we make too rigid a distinction between the content of information art and its form, or dismiss its form (or label) as irrelevant, as Kosuth would have us do, we should remember that information doesn't exist without its processing. Wherever communication technologies are used for the management of information, those technologies have their own programmed or accidental logics, madevisible or not by thework.  

Thus a critical counterpoint to the artists who make lists (or keep files, photograph, record and annotate everything - let's call them the Hanne Darbovens of the world) are those who query the rules and regulations around the processing of that information, particularly the processes behind the access to the information contained in those lists or databases (the Graham Harwoods of the world). Anthony Huberman's “1 (not love) Information', characterizes information as something that contemporary artists strive to stop in its tracks, as there is nothing worse than to have themselves and their work labelled (unless of course, the artist is deliberately playing with processes of categorization).!  

In this volume, texts such as Tom Sherman's 'Primary Devices' (1988) and Basak Senova's 'Congestion in the Data Flow' (2006) point to the tensions between working with the constraints of information technology architectures and working against them. Depending on when a text was written it might be utopic or disheartened about where such developments in art and technology could lead.  

Jean-Francois Lyotard's 1984 exhibition Les Immateriaux' offers an ideal case study to reappraise what possible futures might have emerged from a utopian approach to the ease of communication facilitated by IT (Francesca Gallo's text imagines what Lyotard might have thought of today's live-data driven installations). While forms of information management might change rapidly in a networked or digital context, protocols and behaviours around their use may be slowertochange.  

The new book demands the new writer. Inkstand and goose-quill are dead. The printed sheet transcends space and time. The printed sheet, the infinity of the book,must be transcended   
El Lissitzky18  

In 2000 Canadian artist and researcher Catherine Richards, in collaboration with electronic circuits engineer Martin Snelgrove, filed a patent in the US patent office for a 'method and apparatus for finding love' (US 2003/0083544 A1). The 'prior art' in their patent application was literally prior art - schematic drawings based on late Renaissance artworks, which suggested the cupid's arrow, the finger on the nipple, the vibrations in the ether as key components in a technological system required to find love (or the 'mediation of emotion by technology' as they described it). Of course their patent has been interpreted as being about the ineffable algorithm, the coding underpinning the services sold to us as part of our socially networked existence. Tinder, Facebook, match.com - all of these web applications use complex systems to parse and interpret the information we provide in order to sell us back new connections. An artwork in the form of a patent is both a way of lodging and releasing information about something - what is known at a particular moment - and nailing down the possible applications of that information into future ideas and applications.  

Patents are intellectual property rights management systems, geographically cordoned, just as the terms of agreement you click to 'accept' when logging into these sites are enforced within a particular country's laws. (Michael Stevenson and Erik Borra's 2o06 project was a plug-in for your web-browser that changed the ‘accept' button on all software licensing agreements to one that read 'whatever'). Patents stand against the idea of the commons and fair use. They have terms of protection for the information contained within them, which essentially remains locked from future application for a period of time, not unlike testimonies. As with other forms of IP, patents, like copyright, depend on enforcement. They are part of the so-called information economy, which as Cory Doctorow points out, is based on a myth, simple thinking and a flawed premise, \*[the] buying and selling [of] information. Therefore, we need policies to make it harder to get access to information unless you've paid for it.'9 The last decade has shown that the better an information technology infrastructure, the better the access possible. Though that cuts both ways. Accessible to whom? Rights of ownership and rights of usage are not the same thing; it's not the information that gets more expensive (or valuable), it's the rightto accessand useit.  

Both Felix Stalder (in 'A New Public Sphere' in this volume) and Doctorow remind us that a primary demand of digital rights activists is (while information remains unfree) to be ‘able to use the network and their computers without mandatory surveillance and spyware installed under the rubric of "stopping piracy", because censorship and surveillance are themselves corrosive to free thought, intellectual curiosity and an open and fair society' (Doctorow, op. cit.). He wrote that before Snowden. As Kittler notes in 'On the History of the Theory of Information Warfare' (1998), 1f the Phantasm of all Information Warfare, t0 reduce war to software and its forms of death to operating system crashes, were to come true, lonesome hackers would take the place of the historic artistengineers.' And so, perhaps, they have.  

What is the meaning of displaying an information machine,if the information   
it carried or processed cannot be seen?   
-Tilly Blyth, curator20  

This returns us again to a consideration of the 'where' of information, and the significance of moving it from one place to another. Numerous texts in this volume try to deal with reading versus accessing information via a screen, but this is a red herring, despite the screen's primacy as a mechanism of display in contemporary art. The screen, linked to a network or not, is countered with the printed page, allowing distraction or connection. With distraction there goes memory, an interruption or stoppage in the flow of information, as Scott Lash describes it. With reading comes imagination and new perceptions of pasts or futures (as in the Yes Men's The New York Times 'special edition'). But fron information's own perspective, the differences in the support of the transmission of the message shouldn't matter.  

However, in life as in art, the deliberate creation and successful reception of fictional or misleading information does depend on the form it takes - gaining its authority through its best use (or mimicry) of the established protocols of earlier forms: the archive, encyclopaedia, lists, or, in the case of The New York Times 'special edition', the typeface, layout and distribution system of the newspaper it imitates. Juxtaposition - placing the fictitious in the same informational register as the real, or the private alongside the public - continues to be an enticing strategy for artists. Sharon Hayes' works often rely on memory and public record: she re-speaks speeches, lectures, even love letters out loud, sometimes with her audience holding the script and invited to correct her misremembering. Likewise Rod Dickinson's rescripting and editing of political speeches into newly deranged lectures also asks us to check if the transcript is correct. Are the footnote citations accurate? Who wrote the score? Do we have a finding aide, or the code for translating this back into lived experience?  

The idea of a score suggests the aliveness of the moment of information's transnission. Signal, noise and rhythm are terms used to distinguish one information flow from another, whether that flow is spoken words or data sonified. The noise - deliberately introduced or a result of corruption, whether visible or audible - might in fact be the thing of interest. Jim Campbell's works try to create images using the minimum amount of information possible - the weakest possible signifiers, if not signals. His Home Movies series uses strings or grids of LEDs programmed to play back the light and colour flicker from old footage of childhood holidays and family gatherings. You almost have to squint to make out the image and action, but the glow reflected off the gallery wall evokes a nostalgia all its own. Campbell describes these as low resolution works', purposefully abstract, evocative, and laden with memory. As with the datacloud, your external portable hard-drive, the operating system on your phone, time degrades the information's ability to be transmitted. It might be there, but it might not be retrievable and readable.  

# Information technology is always already strategy or war -FriedrichKittler21  

Hans Haacke's work News (1969) was initially proposed as follows:  

A telex machine installed in the Dusseldorf Kunsthalle prints all the news communicated by the German press agency DPA. The print-outs wili be put on display for further reading one day after being communicated, and on the third day the rolls of paper will be labelled and dated, then stored in Plexiglas containers.  

When most recently remade (version 12) in 2008, the labelling, dating and storing was foregone in favour of the ever-increasing crumpled pile of paper on the floor, print-outs of an RSS feed, which visitors can handle.22 Information, of course, has the possibility to spill over at any stage in its life cycle. As Stalder notes in relation to our current state of constant warfare:  

Vast streams of classified records need to flow freely in order to sustain complex, distributed and time-sensitive operations. Yet, since the information is classified, it needs to flow within strict boundaries which cannot be clearly defined on a general level (after all, you never know what needs to get connected with what in advance), and it needs to flow through many hands. This creates the technoorganizational preconditions for massive amounts of information to leak out.'23  

As most technological developments around networked communications have their origin in warfare, a number of texts consider the flow of information in conflict zones, such as Veran Matic's retelling of Radio B92's set-up. Trevor Paglen's work Code Names (2o01-) lists the names or phrases referring to all classified active military programs. The movement of military information from the secure container of the gallery back into the information system that drives warfare itself is sited within the process of Matt Kenyon's project Notepad (2010), in which he created standard-issue, yellow, ruled notepads of the kind supplied for use by the US military. The rules on the page are not just lines: when viewed through a magnifying glass they are reveaied as microprinted names of civilians killed in the Iraq conflict. Kenyon encourages viewers to use the paper to write to government representatives or military officials to protest against the ongoing conflict, thus entering  into official archives these names otherwise uncommemorated.  

As Hans Haacke said in an interview in 1971:  

Information presented at the right time and in the right place can potentially be very powerful. It can affect the general social fabric. Such things go beyond established high culture as it has been perpetrated by a taste-directed art industry. Of course I don't believe that artists really wield any significant power. At best, one can focus attention. But every little bit helps. In concert with other people's activities outside the art scene, maybe the social climate of society can be changed. Anyway, when you work with the 'real stuff' you have to think about potential consequences ... Real-time systems are double agents. They might run under the heading ‘art', but this culturization does not prevent them from operatingasnormal.24  

Data visualization is how we now think of the 'making visible' of information about 'real stuff' in real time, under the heading of art or design. Mark Lombardi's lifetime worth of drawings of the interconnections between money, power, politics and privilege (which he called 'narrative structures'; see Networks in this series) are among the more iconic works in this area, and their sprawling, handdrawn aesthetic has influenced their digital offspring. The use of technology to process and re-present data (as in the work of Angie Waller, C5, James Bridle, among numerous others) is a balance between showing too much or too little information, often demonstrating the networks or connections between one thing and a hundred others (relationship status: it's complicated).  

So yet again we are back to the idea that information is not the thing, but rather the process of its manifestation. Or, as Baudrillard puts it in Simulacra and Simulation, 'rather than creating communication, [information] exhausts itself in the act of staging communication. Rather than producing meaning, it exhausts itself in the staging of meaning.'  

An example of that staged performance of information is Thomson & Craighead's net artwork Beacon, which has been ‘broadcasting' online at automatedbeacon.net since 2005. It's an endless string of terms entered into the search engines of web-browsers by users all over the world. It is like watching the web breathe. Reading it is addictive, then exhausting (see excerpt on page 107).  

# A book about information art without JoDl and Constant Dullaart?  

I stopped believing that I needed to add brand new content to the world a long time ago, I think we are needed in framing this enormous amount of visual language that is developing and we are overloaded with [it] before we have figured out what it all entails... click scroll swipe click mispellling lol wtf clikc ty   
-ConstantDullaart2s  

The idea of information as being both a resource and a commodity, with value placed on the protocols of its access (developed in Mark Balnaves and Michele Willson's A New Theory of Information & the Internet: Public Sphere Meets Protocol, 2011) is not lost on artists, who have sometimes sought not to add new information to the world but to take their own personal information and exploit it, multiply it, sell it on, or increase its value by making it hard to access. In 1972, the artist Stuart Brisley changed his name to his National Insurance number by deed poll for the duration of an exhibition in London as part of his performance $(Z L~65~63~95~C,$ now in the Tate collection). Or consider a 1971 work by Eleanor Antin,Library Science:  

Each participant in the exhibition of women artists was asked to provide me with a 'piece of information' of any form that described or represented her self, her life, her work, or any aspect of herself that she felt appropriate at this time. Twenty-six participants responded. Each ‘piece of information' (object or document) was classified for subject as a book in accordance with the classification system of the Library of Congress ... All of the 'pieces of information' were exhibited beside their'subjectcataloguecards'.26  

The status of authorship here becomes, in a metadata sense (or in terms of authority of citation) more significant than the content authored. Though artists have played with citation also, of course. Art & Language (Michael Baldwin and Mel Ramsden), citing their collaboration with critic Charles Harrison, commented on shifting roles: 'Charles never did the work, but we quite frequently buried our identity in his academic identity [...]I can think of circumstances where Charlie gave papers under his name as an academic which in fact were written largely by Art&Language.'27  

It may be for this reason that this introduction includes artworks not otherwise included in this book. Rather than an editorial essay this is a curatorial one. I'm sorry if you've been misinformed - did I not mention Kittler's notion that “interpretation works with constants, the comparison between systems introduces variables'? This is of course a deliberate detournement for the sake of pointing out the variables and connections in artistic approaches to working with information as material and medium for art.  

As you approach the end of this book you will find that the concerns of artists open out, from resistance to the classification of their own work, through attempts to name and categorize activity outwith their work, to a general exposure of the process of information's own life cycle - its transmission, processing and usage. With the Internet, this ability to play with source, signal and citation - to redirect from authored text to readymade scraped content (so brilliantly done in JODl's work, such as http: //text.jodi.org from 2002, or Heath Bunting's work _readme.html (Own, Be Owned or Remain Invisible) from 1998, in which an article about Heath published in the Telegraph is hyperlinked so that every word takes you to a different .com site on the Web) - to manipulate, to misinform, comes to the fore. A few examples are included here, such as Cheryl L'Hirondelle's Treaty Card and the International Necronautical Society's Calling All Agents. But other net-based artworks, such as those by JODl, Constant Dullaart and others, which don't lend themselves to an offline, unillustrated anthology, playfully or critically reconfigure the information environments that we spend our screen-time in and predict the future of our communications networks. We should also keep a keen eye on them.

Aspects of the Aesthetics of Telecommunications//1992  

# [... Art and Telecommunications  

One must try to understand the cultural dimensions of new forms of communication as they emerge in innovative artworks which will not be experienced or enjoyed as unidirectional messages. The complexity of the contemporary social scene permeated by electronic media, where the flux of information becomes the very fabric of reality, calls for a re-evaluation of traditional aesthetics and opens the field for new developments. In other words, to address the aesthetics of telecommunications is to see how it affected and affects more traditional arts. It is also to investigate to what extent the context for a new art is created by the merger of computers and telecommunications. The new material which artists will be dealing with more and more must be identified, then, in the intersection between the new electronic processes of visual and linguistic virtualization brought irreversibly by telecommunications and the personal computer (word processing, graphic programs, animation programs, fax/modems, satellites, teleconferencing, etc) and the residual forms that resulted from the process of dematerialization of the art object, from Duchamp to conceptual art (language, video, electronic displays, printing techniques, happenings, mail art, etc.). This new art is collaborative and interactive and abolishes the state of unidirectionality traditionally characteristic of literature and art. Its elements are text, sound, image, and eventually virtual touch, based on force-feedback devices. These elements are out of balance; they are signs which are already shifting, as gestures, as eye contact, as transfigurations of perpetually unfulfilled meaning. What is commuted is changed, re-changed, ex-changed. One must explore this new art in its own terms, i.e. understanding its proper context (the information society at the dawn of the twenty-frst century) and the emerging theories (poststructuralism, chaos theory, culture studies) that inform its questioning of notions largely taken for granted such as subject, object, space, time, culture and human communication. The forum where this new art operates is not the materially stable pictorial space of painting nor the Euclidean space of sculptural form; it is the electronic virtual space of telematics, where signs are afloat, where interactivity destroys the contemplative notion of beholder or connoisseur to replace it by the experiential notion of user or participant. The aesthetics of telecommunications operates the necessary move from pictorial representation to communicational experience.  

Two of the most interesting new forms of communication that seem to do away with the old addresser-addressee model proposed by Claude Shannon and Warren Weaver! and reinforced by Roman Jakobson? are electronic mail (e-mail) and conference calling. In e-mail a user can post up a message and let it adrift in electronic space, without necessarily sending it to a specific addressee. Then another user, or several other users at the same time, can access this message and answer it, or change it, or add a comment or incorporate this message into a larger and new context - in a process that has no end. The closed message as identity of the subject is potentially dissolved and lost in the signifying vortex of the network. If real-time is not crucial for e-mail, the same cannot be said about conference calling, where three or more people engage in exchanges that don't have to be limited to voice. If the linear model goes as far as allowing for addresser to become addressee when the poles are reverted, this new multidirectional and interconnected model melts the boundaries that used to separate sender and receiver. It configures a space with no linear poles in which discussion replaces alternate monologues, a space with nodes that point in several directions where everybody is simultaneously (and not alternately) both addresser and addressee.  

This is not a pictorial or volumetric space, but an aporetic space of information in flux, a disseminated hyperspace that does away with the topological rigidity of the linear model. It shares the properties of non-linear systems, such as those found in hypermedia or in the statistical self-similarity of fractals, as opposed to the embellished linear surfaces of postmodern painting. It is here, possibly, that artists can intervene ciitically and suggest a redefinition of the framework and the role of telematics, showing that antagonistic forces mutually constitute each other. What we used to call true and real is and has always been reciprocally and dynamically, in its play of differences, constituted by what we used to call false and unreal. Cultural values are also questioned, since the structures that privileged one culture over the others are conceptually challenged, bringing cultural differences to the forefront. Artists can also show, by working with the new media, what role the new media play in forming or preserving stable structures that form the self, that model communication and, ultimately, that create social relations (including relations of authority and power).  

In like manner, artist and audience are also constructed in this play of differences. If the mass-produced printed book generated both the notions of author and audience as we know them today,associating control over the distribution of printed information with power, the disseminated play of meaning of telematic networks potentially dissolves both, without fully establishing the integrated, harmonized, aural global village dreamed of by Marshall McLuhan. If telecommunication is that which brings people closer, it also is that which keeps them apart. If telematics is that which makes information accessible to everyone at any moment regardless of geographic frontiers, it is also that which makes certain kinds of data generated by particular groups in certain formats accessible to people involved with specific institutions. That which brings people closer is also what keeps them away, that which asks is also that which affirms certain values implicit in the framing of the question. If there is no end to this play, to this motion, there must be awareness of its context - but then again awareness is not removed from this motion through which it is also configured.  

To the linear model of communication, which privileges the artist as the codifier of messages (paintings, sculptures, texts, photographs), telematics opposes a multidirectional model of communication, one where the artist is creator of contexts, facilitator of interactions. If in the first case messages have physical and semiological integrity and are open only to the extent they allow for differentinterpretations,in the second case it is not mere semantical ambivalence that characterizes the significational openness. The openness of the second case is that which strives to neutralize closed systems of meaning and provide the former viewer (now transformed into user, participant or network member) with the same manipulation tools and codes at the artist's disposal so that the meaning can be negotiated between both. This is not a simple inversion of poles, as proposed by Hans Magnus Enzensberger,3 but an attempt to acknowledge and operate within a signification process that is dynamic, destabilized and multivocal, within a signification process not based on the opposition artist/ audience but on the differences and identities they share. Messages are not 'works' but a part of larger communicational contexts, and can be changed, altered and manipulated virtually by anybody.  

One of the problematic issues here is that the dissolution of the artist in the user and vice-versa would take away from artists their privileged position as senders or addressers, because there is no more message or work of art as such. It is clear that most artists are not prepared to give up this hierarchy because it undermines the practice of art as a profitable activity and the social distinction associated with notions such as skill, craft, individuality, artistic genius, inspiration and personality. The artist, after all, is someone who sees him- or herself as someone who should be heard, who has something important to say, something important to transmit to society. On the other hand, one can ask to what extent artists who create telecommunication events don't restore the same hierarchy they seem to negate by presenting themselves as the organizers or directors, or creators of the events they promote - in other words, as the central figure from which meaning irradiates. As it seems, while a television director works in collaborative fashion with tens or hurdreds of people without ever giving up responsibility for the outcome of the work, the artist (contextcreator) who produces telecommunication events sets a network without fully controllingthefluxofsignsthroughit.Theartistworkingwithtelecommunication media gives up his or her responsibility for the 'work', to present the event as that which restores or tries to restore the responsibility (in Baudrillard's sense) of the media.4 [.]  

Artists are now endowed with new instruments with which they reflect on contemporary issues, such as cultural relativism, scientific indeterminacy, the political economy of the information age, literary deconstruction and decentralization of knowledge; artists are now able to respond to these issues with the same material (hardware) and immaterial (software) means that other social spheres employ in their activities, in their communion and isolation. If actual walls are falling (Berlin Wall, Iron Curtain), and also metaphorical walls (telematic space, virtual reality, telepresence), one can not simply overlook or overestimate these historical and technical achievements. It is not only with sheer enthusiasm for new tools that the artist will work with communication technologies, but also with a critical, sceptical approach concerning the logic of mediation they entail. This means not ignoring the fact that utopias of ubiquitous electronically mediated communication necessarily exclude those cultures and countries that, usually for political and economic reasons, don't have the same or compatible technologies and therefore cannot participate in any global exchange.  

Let's suppose that in a not so distant future Jaron Lanier's dream of 'postsymbolic' communication becomes possible and that the cost per minute in a cyberspace matrix is comparable to the normal cost of a phone call. This hypothetical situation could be a viable approach to the problem of linguistic barriers (including language impairment), but it would be no different from other cases of economic segregation, given that even basic telephone technology is full of serious problems in most developing countries. Perhaps exactly because of these problems, and not despite them, artists are using today's techniques to discuss today's issues. If telecommunications art will not simply neglect the contradictions inherited in the media and in other technological monopolies present in late capitalist societies, I still like to think that perhaps freer forms of communication can emerge out of new interactive artistic practices that make the process of symbolic exchange the very realm of its experience. [...]  

# Telephone Pictures  

The telephone, the automobile, the airplane and, of course, radio were for the avant-garde artists of the first decades of this century a symbol of modern life, in which technology could extend human perception and capabilities. The Dadaists, however, deviated from the general enthusiasm for scientific rationalism and criticized technology's destructive power. In 1920, in the Dada-Almanac, edited in Berlin by Richard Huelsenbeck, they published the irreverent proposal that a painter could now order pictures by telephone and have them made by a cabinetmaker. This idea appeared in the Almanac as a pun and a provocation. Constructivist Hungarian artist Laszl6 Moholy-Nagy was living in Berlin at the time, but it is uncertain whether he read it or heard about it. What is certain is that the soon-to-be member of the Bauhaus believed that intellectual motivations were as valid as emotional ones in creating art and decided to prove it to himself. Years later, the artist wrote,  

In 1922 1 ordered by telephone from a sign factory five paintings in porcelain enamel. I had the factory's colour chart before me and I sketched my paintings on graph paper. At the other end of the telephone the factory supervisor had the same kind of paper, divided into squares. He took down the dictated shapes in the correct position.(It was like playing chess by correspondence.) One of the pictures was delivered in three different sizes,so that I could study the subtle differences in the colour relations caused by the enlargement and reduction.  

With these three telephone pictures, the artist was taking his constructivist ideas several steps further. First, he had to determine precisely the position of forms in the picture plane with the minute squares in the graph paper as the grid through which the pictorial elements structured themselves. This process of pixelation in a sense anticipated the methods of computer art. In order to explain the composition over the phone, Moholy had to convert the artwork from a physical entity to a description of the object, establishing a relationship of semiotic equivalence. This procedure antedates concerns set forth by conceptual art in the 1960s. Next, Moholy transmitted the pictorial data making the process of transmission a significant part of the overall experience. The transmission dramatized the idea that the modern artist can be subjectively distant, he or she can be personally removed from the work. It expanded the notion that the art object doesn't have to be the direct result of the hand or the craft of the artist. Moholy's decision to call a sign factory, capable of providing industrial finishing and scientific precision, instead of, say, an amateur painter, attests to his motifs. Furthernore, the multiplication of the final object in three variations destroyed the notion of the 'original work, pointing towards the new artforms that emerge in the age of mechanical reproduction. Unlike Monet's sequential paintings, the three similar telephone pictures are not a series. They are copies without an original. Another interesting aspect of the work is that scale, a fundamental aspect of any art piece, becomes relative and secondary. The work becomes volatized, able to be embodied in different sizes. Needless to say, relative scale is a characteristic of computer art, where the work exists in the virtual space of the screen and can be embodied in a small print or a mural of gigantic proportions. [...]  

With Moholy-Nagy's three 'telephone pictures', which were shown in his first one-man show in 1924 at the gallery Der Sturm in Berlin, we saw the artist acknowledging the conceptualization power of the telephone exchange. This first experience was recognized as a forerunner of conceptual art by Chicago's Museum of Contemporary Art in its 1969 exhibition Art by Telephone'. Thirty-six artists were asked to place a phone call to the museum, or to answer thie museum's call, and then to instruct museum staff about what their contribution to the show would be. The museum then produced the pieces and displayed them. A record-catalogue was produced with recordings of the phone engagements between artists and museum. The director of the museum, Jan van der Marck, maintained that no group exhibition had tested the aesthetic possibilities of remote-control creation:  

Making the telephone ancillary to creation and employing it as a link between mind and hand has never been attempted in any formal fashion.6  

'Art by Telephone' was not meant as a telecommunications art event. It was a group exhibition of works produced by an unusual method: telephone descriptions followed by the curators' own implementations. The artist was to be, as in the case of Moholy, physically absent from the process. Marck saw this as an expansion of the syncretism between language, performance and visual arts characteristic of the decade. Conceptual art set the framework for the emergence of telecommunications art by emphasizing that cosa mentale that Duchamp had already defended against the purely visual result of retinal painting.Marck wrote that the participants  

want to get away from the interpretation of art as specific, handcrafted, precious object. They value process over product and experience over possession. They are more concerned about time and place than about space and form. They are fascinated with the object quality of words and the literary connotation of images. They reject illusion, subjectivity, formalist treatment and a hierarchy of valuesin art.7  

This exhibition's pioneering status in the development of the aesthetics of telecommunications was counterbalanced by many artists' rather shy response to the chailenge of making creative use of the telephone. The majority of the participants had never worked with communications or telecommunications before, but what is noticeable is that their response to this unique opportunity was still bound by the notion that the work of art is embodied in tangible matter - even if matter without durable substance. Most artists used the telephone in an ordinary way, providing instructions for the making of objects and installations; only a few dared to transform an actual communication experience in the work itself. The most notable exceptions are Stan VanDerBeek, Joseph Kosuth, lames Lee Byars and Robert Huot.  

Huot's interactive proposal was the most unusual if not the most literal. It potentially involved all visitors of the museum and attempted to generate unexpected first meetings by employing chance and anonymity. Twenty-six cities in America were chosen, each starting with a letter of the alphabet, and 26 men named Arthur were selected, one in each city. Each Arthur's last name was the first listing under the initial letter of the city (Arthur Bacon, in Baltimore, for instance). The Museum displayed a list of all cities and names, and invited visitors to call and ask for 'Art'. The work was the unexpected conversation between 'Art' and the visitor, and its development totally up to them. Huot's piece, no matter if intended as a pun on the title of the show, presents the artist as the creator of a context - not a passive experience. It disregards pictorial representation, gives up control over the work and takes advantage of the realtime and interactive qualities of the telephone. The piece was meant to spark relationships, and by doing so anticipated much of the telecommunications workof thenexttwo decades.  

# Visual Telephonics and Beyond  

For all the social, political and cultural implications of the telephone, or more precisely, the dialogic structuring of the telephone, one is compelled to observe that little critical attention has been paid to it. Historical, technical and quantitative sociological studies can shed little light on the deeper problematics of the telephone, which is adjacent to linguistics, semiology, philosophy and art. Avital Ronell has brought to the fore a long-distance philosophical call that is as unprecedented as it is welcome. Letting her own discourse oscillate between orality and writing in the connections and reroutings of a metaphorical switchboard, Ronell's The Telephone Books has provided a new philosophical insight, a multi-party line between Martin Heidegger, Sigmund Freud, Jacques Derrida and, of course, Alexander Graham Bell. Ronell's gesture, albeit on another plane, is similar to that of those artists who since the late 1970s have found in the telephone an incomparable source for experimentation. Why the telephone?  

In some ways it [the telephone] was the cleanest way to reach the regime of any number of metaphysical certitudes. It destabilizes the identity of self and other, subject and thing, it abolishes the originariness of site; it undermines the authority of the Book and constantly menaces the existence of literature. It is itself unsure of its identity as object, thing, piece of equipment, perlocutionary intensity or artwork (the beginnings of telephony argue for its place as artwork); it offers itself as instrument of the destinal alarm, and the disconnecting force of the telephone enables us to establish something like the maternal superego.? I... ]  

Perhaps what is unique about ordinary telephony is that in its circuitry only spoken language circulates. As Robert Hopper has suggested, the telephone emphasizes the linearity of signs by splitting sound off from all other senses, by isolating the vocal element of communication from its natural congruity with the facial and the gestural.o By cutting the audible out of its interrelation with the visual and the tactile, and by separating interlocutors from the speech community, the telephone abstracts communication processes and reinforces Western phonocentrism, now translated into an outreaching telephonocentrism. It is to destabilize this phonocentrism, and subsequently to contribute in undoing hierarchies and centralization of meaning, knowledge and experience, that theorists like Ronell and telecommunications artists invest their calls. In the twentieth century, what Derrida calls phonocentrism can be traced back to Saussure, and Hopper cautiously finds Saussure bound to the telephone. Hopper supports his argument with evidence that Saussure lived in Paris when the city saw the boom of telephony. But more than that, he reminds us that the telephone was invented by a speech teacher of the deaf (Bell) and he stresses the acute resemblance of Saussure's speaking circuit to telephonic communication. In the almost scientific vocal isolation of telephony and in the presence of absent speakers, speech speaks loudly of its linear structure and offers itself for theoretical (and artistic) investigation.  

Being this entity which excludes all that is different from vocal immediacy, the telephone speaks volumes about its platonic metaphysical framework. But when zeroing in on several particulars of telematic experience, one instantiates new insights on the telephonic structure that contribute to a possible deconstruction of that framework. Perhaps the most relevant aspect of the new telephonic syntax is its recent technical absorption of the graphic element. It is now technically possible not only to talk but to write over the phone (e-mail), to print over the phone (fax), to produce and record sound and video (answering machine, slow-scan TV,videophone) over the phone. As we have seen, it is also very likely that in the future, fibre optics will give us access to telecyberspace. The telephone is becoming the medium par excellence of that ‘enlarged and radicalized' writing that signals Derrida, but contrarily to what one would otherwise hypothesize, the more the telephone becomes speechless the more central its role becomes in our lives. It is clear that the telephone is slowly but continuously ceasing to owe its existence exclusively to orality, but the cultural implications of this new aspect of contemporary life remains to be further elaborated as an aesthetic experience.  

If the artist can have a unique encounter with technology because he or she is an expert aware of the changes in sense perception, as McLuhan purported, then it is the artist who will instigate the discovery of new realms of experience beyond ordinary cognition. Today a small number of artists inflated by an spirit of genuine artistic inquiry are turning their back on the art market and are committing themselves to creating telecommunications events in the placeless placeofnetworking.  

Starting in 1982, after the pioneering telecommunication activities of Bill Bartlett, Stan VanDerBeek and Liza Bear, Bruce Breland, Matt Wrbican and other members of the Pittsburgh-based Dax group (which now has an extension in Bellingham, Washington), have worked consistently with fax and slow-scan TV as artistic media. Dax has created or participated in telecommunications events in which telephone lines are saturated with signals that flow in multiple directions carrying graphic information. These interactions often include other media as well (dance, computer music, etc), span over several time zones, are geographically dispersed and establish varied kinds of relationships between participants. Bruce Breland, director of the group, wrote that the concept of interactive systems has erased the old boundaries of regionalism or nationalistic art. Telematics has created the possibility of a new setting for interactive participation between individuals and groups. Telematics provides a means for instantaneous and immediate dissemination of information granting the individual a choice between sinple retrieval or intricate collaborative art events.  

One of their first activities was participation in The World in 24 Hours (1982), a global network organized by Robert Adrian X for Ars Electronica in Linz, Austria, which linked sixteen cities on three continents for a day and a night. Three years later, they stretched the notion of worldwide interaction with The Ultimate Contact, a slow-scan TV piece created over FM radio in collaboration with the space shuttle Challenger, in orbit around the Earth. The Dax group also participated in larger networks realized in acknowledged art institutions, such as the Ubiqua telecommunications lab at the 42nd Venice Biennale in 1986. In it, they participated with text (IP Sharp), slow-scan TV and fax. More recently, they were the first to collaborate with African artists in a telecommunications event. On July 1990, they created Dax Dakar d'Accord, a slow-scan TV exchange with artists in Pittsburgh and Dakar, Senegal, as part of a Senegalese five-year commemoration of the African Diaspora, the 'Goree-Almadies Memorial'. Participants from Dakar included Breland, Wrbican, Bruce Taylor, Mor Gueye (glass paintings), Serigne Saliou Mbacke, De C.A.S.A. (sand paintings), Les Ambassadeurs (dance and music), Le Ballet Unite Africaine (dance and music), and Fanta Mbacke Kouyate performing 'Goree Song', which makes reference to Coree Island in Dakar Harbour - a holding and embarkation place for the slave trade that took place over a four-hundred year period.  

In Brazil, or perhaps I should say, in and out of Brazil, artists such as Mario Ramiro, Gilbertto Prado (a member of French Art Reseaux), Paulo Bruscky and Carlos Fadon have worked with telecommunications since the early or mid 1980s. The events created by these artists, some of whom have occasionally worked together, encompassed exchanges both on a national and international scale. Mario Ramiro, now living in Germany, is also a sculptor who works with zero-gravity and infra red radiation. He has initiated and participated in a number of telecommunications events with fax, slow-scan TV, videotext, live television broadcasts and radio. He has also written extensively on the subject. Paulo Bruscky, from Recife, well known for his work in xerography and mail art, is one of the few Brazilian artists to have been awarded a Guggenheim fellowship. His early work in telecommunications involved experiments with telex and fax. Carlos Fadon, who lived in Chicago and now is back in Sao Paulo, is a photographer and computer artistwhose work ispart of several international collections.One of his most original slow-scan TV pieces is Natureza Morta ao Vivo (Still Life/ Alive), which proposes that once one artist (a) sends an image to another (b), the image received becomes the background for a still life created live. The artist (b) places objects in front of the electronic image and the combination of both object and image is captured as a video still which is now sent back to the artist (a). This artist now uses this new image as the background for a new composition with new objects and sends it to the artist (a). This process is repeated with no terminus, so that the generation of a still life remains a work-in-progress through which a visual dialogue takes place.  

In Paris, the Art Reseaux group, formed by Karen O'Rourke, Gilbertto Prado, Christophe Le Francois and others, has been developing elaborate projects such as O'Rourke's City Portraits, which call for participants in a global network to travel in imaginary cities by means of exchange of fax images. The project usually involves the initial creation of a pair of images, the entrance and the exit, which other artists then take as the extremes of the route they will explore in the metamorphosis of images exchanged over the telephone line. Artists create entrances and exits using images of the cities they live in, by manipulating other images to form synthetic landscapes or both, blending aspects of direct and imaginary experiences of the urban environment. Gilbertto Prado has been working on the 'Connect' project, which involves at least two sites and two fax machines in each site. Artists in each site are asked not to cut the roll of thermal paper in the machine when fax images start to appear. Instead, they are asked to feed that roll into another fax machine and interfere in the images in the process. A loop is then formed, connecting not only the artists but the machines themselves. This new configuration forms a circle in electronic space, linking in an imaginary topology cities that can be as far apart as Paris and Chicago. As an example of possible systems of interaction beyond linear models, Prado designed a circular diagram in which the hands (and not the mouths or the ears of the interlocutors) are the organs used for communication.  

Le Francois' most recent project is Infest, in which artists are invited to investigate aesthetically that new aspect of contemporary life which is the deterioration of images and documents due to contamination and infection by computer viruses. During the exchanges, images suffer manipulations that attempt to destroy and reconstruct them (infection/disinfection), pointing to the new condition of electronic decay in the world of digital epidemiology.  

As the metaphors of human existence continue to intermingle with those of cybernetic existence, designers learn how to cope with issues of interfacing and artists compare  remote  communication  to   face-to-face interaction. Acknowledging the place of telephony in art, Karen O'Rourke reflects on the nature of fax exchanges as an artistic practice:  

Most of us today have taken not painting (nor even photography) as a starting point for our images, but the telephone itself. We use it not only to send images but to receive them as well. This nearly instantaneous feedback transforms the nature of the messages we send, just as the presence of a live audience inflects the way in which actors interpret their roles or musicians their scores.12  

Traditionally, as in the sign/idea relationship, representation ( painting, sculpture) is that which takes place as absence (the sign is that which evokes the object in its absence). Likewise, experience (happening. performance) is that which takes place as presence (one only experiences something when this something is present in the field of perception). In telecommunications art, presence and absence are engaged in a long-dlistance call that upsets the poles of representation and experience. The telephone is in constant displacement; it is logocentric, but its phonetic space, now in congruity with inscription systems (fax, e-mail, etc.) signifes in the absence more typically associated with writing (absence of sender, absence of receiver). The telephone momentarily displaces presence and absence to instantiate experience not as pure presence, but, as Derrida wrote, 'chains of differential marks'!3 [..]

# Robin Mansell The Information Society//2009  

[...] The origins of the emphasis on information and communication control systems, typical of much of the literature on 'The Information Society, can be traced to a programme of scientific research, engineering and mathematics in the post World War Il period and the publication in 1948 of Norbert Wiener's Cybernetics: Or Control and Communication in the Animal and Machine. As Professor of Mathematics at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), he was interested in neurological systems and information processing and feedback systems. A year later, Claude Shannon, an electrical engineer and mathematician, also at MIT, and Warren Weaver, a scientist and Director of Natural Sciences at the Rockefeller Institute, published A Mathematical Theory of Communication. These men were interested in developing new approaches to automation and computerization as a means of providing new control systems for both military and non-military applications. Wiener, especially, was concerned with the philosophical implications of their work. He observed that 'society can only be understood through a study of the messages and the communication facilities that belong to it'(The Human Use of Human Beings).  

Notwithstanding his interest in society, at this time there were few interdisciplinary collaborations with social scientists working on the implications of the insights arising from science and engineering.  

Fritz Machlup, an economist, and Marc Porat and Michael Rubin undertook empirical work aimed at measuring the intensity of information activities and the growth in information-related occupations in the United States economy. This work was to give rise to comparative research aimed at mapping and measuring the Information Society, initially focusing on industrialized countries. Machlup emphasized that over-concentration on information and its delivery systems could deflect attention away from equitable availability and distribution of the benefits of information, and he warned against the temptation to'measure the unmeasurable' counsel that was not particularly well heeded (Machlup and Kronwinkler,'Workers Who Produce Knowledge - Steady Increase, 1900 to 1970', 1975). There has been considerable investment in indicator development, but relatively less effort has been devoted to understanding whether the data collected using these indicators can be used to infer behavioural change or applied to the analysis of the experiential aspects of information societies. In the 1970s research in Japan by Yoneji Masuda was developing a vision of the Information Society. The goal of the plan he devised for the Japanese government was ‘the realization of a society that brings about a general flourishing state of human intellectual creativity, instead of affluent material consumption'. ('Emerging Information Society in Japan', 1980; italics in original).  

The Information Society was designated [by Masuda] a ‘computopia', a society that would function around the axis of information values rather than material values' and rather idealistically, as one that would be 'chosen, not given' ('Computopia: Rebirth of Theological Synergism'). A different approach to measurement in Japan was Youichi Ito's work, which involves the many different modes of information and communication, including books, telephone calls, etc.  

Daniel Bell's The Coming of the Post-Industrial Society: A Venture in Social Forecasting ( 1973) brought the information age to the attention of social scientists in the United States and Europe, working in many disciplines well beyond those that had always focused on the media or communication systems. For Bell 'the axial principle of the postindustrial society ... is the centrality of theoretical knowledge and its new role, when codified, as the director of social change' ('The Social Framework of the Information Society', 1980). He said that the variables it was crucial to study were information and knowledge, and it was now necessary to focus on business and management issues as well as broader societal concerns. Peter Drucker employed the term ‘knowledge society' in arguing that knowledge workers would have to change and adapt to its requirements (Knowledge Society', 1969). For these authors and many others, the task at hand was to forge a strong commitment to technological innovation as the mobilizer of economic andsocialprogress.  

Social scientists working in the field of communication in the United States generally emphasized the potentially transformative character of information and communication technology (ICT), although Harold Lasswell, Fritz Lazarsfeld and Robert  Merton  concentrated on  the interactions between  mass communication and social action, as did Wilbur Schramm. Lasswell emphasized that the social scientific study of communication meant a focus on 'who says what in which channel to whom with what effect' ('The Structure and Function of Communications in Society', 1948), setting the stage for a tradition of media effects research with its problematic search for a stable set of effects.  

The Canadian Marshall McLuhan, a Professor of English, popularized the term 'global village' in his Gutenberg Galaxy: The Making of Typographic Man ( 1962). McLuhan extended the work of fellow Canadian and economic historian, Harold Innis, emphasizing features of communication in the written and oral traditions. McLuhan suggested that 'the advent of a new medium often reveals the lineaments and assumptions, as it were, of an old medium' ('Effects of the Improvements of Communication Media',1960).  

This and similar observations sparked vociferous debate - which continues about whether specific communication technologies are causally related to certain societal configurations. The American scholar Ithiel de Sola Pool was one of several in this period who put ICT at the centre of the case for an Information Society policy. Such policy discussions offered a normative prescription for the optimal way of capitalizing on the benefits of the production and use of ICTs. Information Society as injunction and prescription rather than description, a programme consistent with the dominant values in the wealthy western countries of the world, was well on its way to being developed. [...]  

The influential work of Manuel Castells has highlighted the cultural and institutional manifestations of network societies and the importance - or logic - of emergent social formations. Castells' work has been criticized by scholars such as Nico Stehr and Jan van Dijk for its 'modern version of "technological determinism" (van Dijk, 'The One-Dimensional Network Society of Manuel Castells', 1999).  

Despite this, however, Castells' work is very important for understanding the enabling as well as the disabling characteristics of what he calls ‘mass self communication', that is, the possibilities created by the Internet, including an ever-growing number of social networking sites and greater access to mobile communication.  

James Beniger advocated the development of a general theory of information, communication, decision and control, an approach that was taken up by systems theorists such as Niklas Luhmann. Philosopher Manuel De Landa was also drawn to systems theory and focused on the chaotic properties in the evolution of systems, re-emphasizing a focus on information processing to explain developments in intelligent machines, especially those used for military purposes. Suhail Malik also took a systems perspective to the examination of information societies - in this case making an attempt to integrate insights from developmental systems theory, biology and the social sciences.  

Other scholars have begun the quest for a general theory of information paralleled by some political economists' quest for a general theory of society. For example, Tom Stonier envisaged a theory that would encompass 'information, intelligence, meaning, and understanding' (Towards a New Theory of Information', 1991). Others, such as Haridimos Tsoukas, while still focusing on information, argued that information overload might diminish understanding in society, while Luciano Floridiis among those intrigued by the ethical implications ofinformation. Scott Lash maintained that in the information age 'the centrality of the means of production are displaced by the means of communication', that non-linear sociotechnical assemblages replace the institutions of earlier societies, and, therefore, that a critique of information must emerge from information feedback loops within the communication system itself (Critique of Information, 2002). Following Luhmann's systems theory, Lash argues that we can no longer stand outside the system and critique it from a transcendent ideological position.  

The proponents of research in the critical traditions of scholarship on the Information Society have struggled to provide a theoretically robust account of how the  interpenetration of asymmetrical relationships within today's information societies perpetuates inequalities and injustices. Research in the more critical traditions has had relatively little influence on the priorities of those promoting the Information Society vision. This vision continues to be driven strongly by those in a position to make design and other choices regarding the nature and use of technology. including those individuals using the technology in the search for profit and according to the values of global capitalism. The virtual spaces enabled by the Internet provide opportunities now for more people to represent their views and to participate online in communicative dialogues of many kinds. The uncertainty over these developments is whether these new voices will be heard and responded to by the traditionally powerful actors in society, and whether these voices are heralding a more profound shift of influence and control towards action to address inequality and exclusion.

Fluxus as a Laboratory//1998 [... Fluxus offered a research methodology for what I call 'networked ideas' and demonstrated the value of those ideas in various experiments. That history has receivedless attention.  

Fluxus often parodied the kind of art that posits a masterpiece appreciated by a spectator. By contrast, Fluxus works highlighted socio-poetic interaction and encouraged epistemological experimentation among participant-users. Confronted with a Fluxus work, a participant-user would first notice how these works played against the notion that art should follow certain (modernist) rules of form.  

For example, one work by Ken Friedman suggests socio-poetic and antiformalist qualities. The work consists entirely of the following text: The distance from this sentence to your eye is my sculpture.' This work pokes fun at the normal criteria for sculpture. It also suggests a particularly important interaction with the spectator. It goes beyond a mere critical appreciation of art in its striving toward the status of masterpiece to suggest a social network built on playing through or interacting among people, activities and objects. In this sense, Fluxus functions as more than a way to organize information: it is also a way to organize social networks, networks of people learning. These networks are based on an interactive model of art rather than on the traditional model of art as a oneway communication from sender to receiver, the notion of the artist offering inspired genius intended to dazzle spectators. This can be done in many ways. In an issue of Editions Et, for example, Eric Andersen's contribution consisted of three cards with instructions on one side on how to mail the card, and these instructions on the other side: 'don't do anything to this very nice card.'i Typical of Fluxus work, these instructions put the participant in a humourous double-bind and point to the social interaction involved in the work.  

The social project of the Fluxus laboratory involves disseminating knowledge. This is the social situation of learning. Simone Forti suggests that in the context of this social - that is, anti-aesthetic - project Fluxus work has no intrinsic value. The value of the work resides in the ideas it implies to the reader, the spectator and to other participants. Forti goes on to explain that 'when the work has passed out of their [the producer's] possession, it is the responsibility of the new owner to restore it or possibly even to remake it. The idea of the work is part of the work here, and the idea has been transferred along with the ownership of the object that embodies it.2 Forti explains that the audience performs the piece in the process of transferring the ideas. The work is 'interactive'3 The term interactive suggests the shift away from the notion of passing some unadulterated information from the mind of an author, an artist or a teacher directly to the eyes and ears of a spectator. Instead, participants interact with ideas, playing through possibilities rather than deciding on the meaning of a work once and for all. Dick Higgins categorizes Fluxus under the phrase Exemplative Art, which he defines as 'art as illustration or example or embodiment of idea, especially abstract conception orprinciple'.4  

Higgins' description of Fluxus ‘art-games' can function as a coda for this particular type of work. He writes that in art-games, one 'gives the rules without the exact details', and instead offers a 'range of possibilities' Higgins goes on to list a series of crucial elements in art-games including social implications and a community of participants more conscious of other participants than in most forms of drama or of performance art, what we might call team spirit. And there is an element of fascination about when the rules will take effect. Again, the authors leave the details of the actual event open. In an essay titled 'Getting into Events', Ken Friedman discusses ways to perform Fluxus event scores:  

You can perform a Fluxus event in virtuoso or bravura style, and you can perform it jamming each piece into the minimal time possible as Ben Vautier does; or, go for a slow, meditative rhythm as Alison Knowles does; or, strike a balance as you'll see in the concerts organized by Dick Higgins or Larry Miller. Pieces can have a powerful torque, energized and dramatic, as in the work of Milan Knizak, the earthly folkloric touch seen in Bengt af Klintberg's pieces; or the atmospheric radiance, spiritual and dazzling, that is seen in Beuys' work.6  

Significantly, these poetic scores do not depend on the voice of a reader. Instead a participant-user 'reads' the poetic event by creating a situation. Fluxus event scores and performance instructions have a didactic structural grammar; they seem to be parodies of scientific experiments simply because they reduce theatricality to a set of instructions. Using the trappings of a science experiment suggests a way further to displace the interpretation of Fluxus as an art movement. Building and interacting with their work, rather than passively appreciating it as a finished product, changes interpretation into a generative project. The start of that sort of interpretation begins with a new concept for the endeavour previously known as Fluxus: the Fluxus laboratory.  

I first became interested in the concept of a Fluxus laboratory after discovering a number of references to the pedagogical and experimental imperatives central to much Fluxus work. It is well known that two of the key roots of Fluxus included the experimental pedagogy at Black Mountain College (during the summer sessions of 1948 and, especially, 1952)7 and the New School for Social Research (from John Cage's seminar). Black Mountain College focused on a redefinition of the arts by stressing a holistic and experimental approach to art rather than a technical or formal approach. In earlier years, students had approached wider questions not typical of art schools; for example, they helped Wilhelm Reich build his first \*orgone boxes'. The 1952 summer session added to, and changed, this experimental approach to art. Cage, fast becoming a major influence on the experimental arts, brought to the summer session his concerns with the I Ching, \*chance', etc. His Theatre Piece I, which assigned a specific time bracket within which each performer had to perform a specific action, became the prototype of Happenings.  

Buckminster Fuller summarized the experimental nature of these influential summer sessions: failure is a part of experimentation, you succeed when you stop failing.s Although Black Mountain College eventually closed its doors, the teachers present during those two summer sessions (including Cage, Fuller, MC Richards and Merce Cunningham) conspired to create a travelling school: 'the finishing school was going to be a caravan, and we would travel from city to city. and it would be posted outside of the city that the finishing school was coming ... we would finish anything ... we would really break down the conventional wayofapproachingschool."9  

Many other experimental schools have been associated with Fluxus over the years. For example. Dick Higgins and Al Hansen organized the New York AudioVisual Group as an outgrowth of the Cage classes at the New School, Jeff Berner and Ken Friedman were involved in the San Francisco State College Experimental College, and Friedman was later involved in the College of Mendocino. Of the nearly two-hundred experimental colleges and Free Universities started in the mid 1960s, however, few survive. These attempts at allowing for a laboratory-like atmosphere in the study of the arts and humanities were superseded by more mundane institutional concerns, and those experimental colleges that developed in the context of larger universities transmitted their lessons and were essentially absorbed into the bodies of the larger institutions that supported them.  

Even so, a number of educational institutions took a deliberately Fluxist tone. California Institute of the Arts (Cal Arts) began as a particularly prominent forum for Fluxus experiments. Fluxus artists played a major role in the founding faculty, and Fluxus people flourished there for a short time. An issue of Aspen, the ‘Cal Arts Box', documents some of this activity. The faculty included Allan Kaprow, Dick Higgins, Alison Knowles, Peter Van Ripper, Emmett Williams and Nam June Paik. Although the laboratory atmosphere at Cal Arts quickly faded, participants like Paik went on to have an influence on many other curricula and temporary educational situations. George Maciunas also planned the organization of a school as well. In a prospectus for the New Marlborough Center for the Arts, he described a think-tank that would devote itself to  

1) study, research, experimentation and development of various advanced ideas and forms in art, history of art, design and documentation; 2) teaching small groups of apprentices in subjects not found in colleges; 3) production and marketing of various products, objects and events developed at the center; and 4) organization of events and performances by residents and visitors of the center.10  

It was an effort to purge the art world of authors and creative geniuses. Like many of the contributions to assembling magazines, the works became models for alternative forms of social organization. Indeed, as Estera Milman explains, 'Fluxus work (objects, paperworks, publications, festivals and performances) and the movement's social structures became congruent and interchangeable.'l1 George Maciunas' manifesto for Fluxus explains this socio-poetic practice:  

Fluxus FLUX ART: non art - amusement forgoes distinction between art and nonart forgoes artist's indispensability, exclusiveness, individuality, ambition, forgoes all pretension towards a significance, variety, inspiration, skill, complexity, profundity, greatness, institutional and commodity value. It strives for nonstructural, nontheatrical, non-baroque, impersonal qualities of a simple, natural event, an object, a game, a puzzle, or a gag. It is a fusion of Spike Jones, gags,games,Vaudeville, Cage and Duchamp.12  

The Fluxus project combined a sometimes parodic emulation of the Bauhaus model with the production of 'impersonal' conceptual games and puzzles, concrete poetry, along with an interest in situations, experimental culture, and an attack on 'commodity value' in art. These concerns and the mixing of these tendencies appeared in a number of Fluxus assemblings and periodicals. While Vaudeville, Cage and Duchamp have secured prominent places in scholarship on art and mass culture, Spike Jones still remains a somewhat marginal figure. Yet his Musical Depreciation Revue offers a whole array of useful jokes, gags, puns, spoonerisms, and so on.  

My corporate name for these works, the Fluxus laboratory, alludes to the function of laboratories in large manufacturing concerns: they attempt to develop new products through endless rounds of experiments, failures and sharing of successes among the participants. It also subverts the notion of limited liability among corporate shareholders, to suggest that possibilities were unlimited and the participants, unlike shareholders, had to take unlimited chances. It even hints at the way some of the participants used a corporate umbrella, a single name for many diverse artists and divergent art works, to help them initiate a unique and specific type of working with ideas. Although Maciunas' rhetoric suggests the anonymous IBM structure  in  which all participants became anonymous contributors to the single corporate identity, Fluxus was in reality closer to the Bell Labs model, in which participants were credited with particular innovations and works within the larger Fluxus project. Even Maciunas, who tried to produce his contributions to many works anonymously, now regularly receives careful credit for each and every aspect of his contribution. Many of the works were produced by a number of participants, and this aspect is still relatively rare in the art world. The individual contributions were combined into something much more interesting than any of the parts alone.  

This way of working placed creativity and innovation in the hands of a linked or networked community rather than locating it in the mind of a sole genius in the form of a single artist's inspiration. Of course, this has political ramifications, and it may or may not have succeeded in negating or avoiding the art world's recuperative powers. The context of a concept such as the Fluxus laboratory introduced a method of research that makes increasing sense to those involved in transforming pedagogy and the creative process from individual inspiration to a virtual community networked through with hypermedia links and relays.  

Considering these works as part of a Fluxus laboratory has both an air of humour and a suggestion of translating these works towards a structure of influence. Fluxus sought to purge the art world of its problems; that purge was perhaps an unwitting discovery of a way of working that depended on something like a viral influence among participants. Things in the air were passed around and developed. The Fluxus laboratory is impossible to trace to a single origin. The group previously known as Fluxus can now function as a generalized systems theory that experiments with the structure of influence and socio-poetic links.  

In an issue of Aspen, George Maciunas highlights this interest in new forms of systems theory.13 The subtitle of the issue is Art Information and Science Information Share the Same World and Language'. A number of artists who were partially influenced by Fluxus participated in this project. Robert Morris's Los Angeles Project suggests the shared fascination with art, technology and information systems, especially in these networks of cultural work looking for new maps for contemporary experience. He proposes an ecological experiment in which he will bury air conditioners and heaters and measure effects. Presumably you could visit the site as a national park. Morris explains that what 'miniature golf did for the game, this park will do for the national park system." Ed Ruscha's Parking Lot includes an aerial photo of thirty-four parking slots in a lot, and similarly in Richard Serra's Lead Shot Runs the artist dropped lead shot from an airplane and measured the size of the holes. Robert Smithson also has a work about landscape structures entitled Strata. These absurdist projects function as conceptual scores. They also highlight the interest in experimental procedures to change the way people understand the urban and post-urban contemporarylandscape.  

The Fluxus magazine De-coll/age, compiled by Wolf Vostell, began publishing in the early 1960s, subtitled Bulletin der Fluxus und happening Avantgarde. The Iulv1967issueof $D\acute{e}$ -coll/age, bound in a cover of the Figaro newspaper printed on card stock, includes contributions from the concrete poet Dom Sylvester Houedard; the composer and editor of the assembling Revue Ou, Henri Chopin; Ben Vautier, Daniel Spoerri; and Dieter Roth, the well-known printer, designer and artist who collaborated with Eugen Gomringer. There is a police department letter to Vostell explaining their actions in arresting Charlotte Moorman for undressing during a performance. Theissue includes a number of documentations of happenings by Allan Kaprow and Al Hansen. Articles include Dick Higgins' 1966 essay ‘Intermedia', a reprinted essay on the all-at-once world by Marshall McLuhan and a series of works by Gustav Metzger on the 'Destruction in Art Symposium'. In the reprinted text of a leaflet, Metzger, who later initiated the 1974 'Art Strike', announces the symposium and explains 'auto-destructive art'. A series of letters signed by Metzger follow this leaflet about the planning for events in Germany and London. A series of photos documents a symposium in which people sit inside or under the eviscerated bloody bodies of large animals. There is also a negative review from the London Guardian of 9 September 1966, which reads in part:  

The destroyers-in-art include writers who obliterate words, burn books, and cut odd words out of dictionaries and paste them up haywire. They tear books apart and shuffle the pages so the narrative now reads surprisingly (which is art). Words are displaced and lines transposed in d new and meaningful way. Some newspapers, it seems, especially in their hurried first editions, have long possessed a natural aptitude for the new and the meaningful. That's art. Or is it? More often it is error. Just as destruction-in-art is mainly perverse, ugly and anti-social.  

The designer has photocopied a series of programmes by Ad Reinhardt written vertically over this newspaper article. They give instructions about programme painting. In addition to these works, there are documentations of papers presented by George Maciunas on Fluxus, Jean Tinguely's statement, Dom Sylvester Houedard, Milan Knizak, Yoko Ono and Vostell. The point of including the entire conference and the negative review suggests that the artists were less concerned about their work receiving adulation than in constantly highlighting the social interactions and even negative responses to the situations they presented.  

Erving Goffman explains that the primary experience of a participant confronted with, for example, a Fluxus event is to become ‘interactionally disorganized' (emphasis added).4 Although Goffman is specifically describing the experience of attending a Happening, this description also captures some of the elements of Fluxus Events. These events were not Happenings, but the audience reactions were quite similar. Reading interaction in terms of how these events (dis)organize and disseminate knowledge can help explain precisely the effects produced by the Fluxus laboratory. Goffman explains that when the audience encounters an event like the one reviewed above, watching becomes doing; it would be a mistake to argue that a listening, watching and stillaudience is, therefore, passive. In fact, the opposite may be the case. The breaking of the normal frame of reference - seeing an art opening or a theatrical performance - can actually induce involvement. Goffman explains, however, that the initial reaction to the event will probably be negative:  

If the whole frame can be shaken, rendered problematic, then this, too, can ensure that prior involvements - and prior distances - can be broken up and that, whatever else happens, a dramatic change can occur in what it is that is being experienced...negative experiences.'15  

Among the various ways to shake the frame or reflexively examine the frame and its dissolution, Goffman mentions brackets, direct address to the audience, the "fool' character in a play, and, in terms of Fluxus, the spectacle-game. The spectacle-game addresses the whole matter of the show under presentation, and, in doing so, sets in motion a merger of performers and spectators - in some sense, the spectators (and their expectations) are put on stage.16  

One way these events play the spectacle-game is to announce a performance in a conventional way. When the audience arrives, some of the expected activities occur, but the traditional performance does not take place. In this situation, Goffman explains that an audience is made 'conscious of its own restrictive conventions' in thinking of a performance only in a traditional sense. These events create a situation where the audience has to interact with the frame of reference. As Goffman explains, in a discussion of Happenings, 'actual performances of this kind often do succeed, of course, in driving the audience up and down various keys in their effort to arrive at a viable interpretation of what is being done to them.17  

George Maciunas had experimented with machines that use arbitrary constraints to change the frame of reference. For example, his Smile Box makes you smile. In a work he planned before he died, he charted the outline for a Fluxus laboratory experiment. His Learning Machine (1969) functions as the transitional work between Fluxus and the Fluxus laboratory. It would have contained charts, diagrams and atlases; it would have recategorized fields of knowledge.  Maciunas only  completed a  two-dimensional  diagram and tabulation; he intended this diagram as the first surface for a three-dimensional storage and retrieval system. He later built a few models of these machines, and one can consider all of the Flux Kits as cognates for the Learning Machine. Even these incomplete diagrams and models suggest a plan for using electronic media for a memory theatre dedicated to invention rather than mere descriptions. Indeed, one could argue that the machine hints at a Fluxus memory or intelligence (post-cognitive, involutionary and interactive).  

Maciunas' machine lists all knowledge in a classification system. For the most part, the grid is not exceptional. It closely resembles traditional taxonomies of knowledge, and it suggests the classifications found in memory theatres. These were systems of classification and organization used in remembering large amounts of information. Some even attempted to categorize all known information. One of the devices used to create a memory theatre was the conceit of an imagined building. Giulio Camillo's memory theatres, for example, stuffed all his knowledge into an imaginary Roman amphitheatre. This encyclopaedia, thesaurus and poetry machine became'a work of manic idiosyncrasy, resembling a private museum like those of [Duc Jean Floressas] des Esseintes, [Joris-Karl] Huysmans'paragon of decadence'18  

The tradition of these memory devices goes back to Classical times, when Simonides used the memory of a tragic event as the basis for his device. When he was asked to identify the bodies in a collapsed building that he had left shortly before the collapse, he remembered where each person stood. Later, he realized that he would never forget the way the room appeared before the tragedy. As a result, he learned to store particular types of information with each figure. Later, he would imagine walking around the space while each of his former friends held these bits of information. In this way, he could store much more information than he could remember without the aid of this system. The Learning Machine resembles this effort to describe all knowledge.!9 The use of a memory theatre shifts the process of knowing and remembering from an organic cognition to a discursive practice - a learning machine. This particular machine was not Maciunas' only foray into memory systems. He had also, for example, diagranmed the history of world architecture.  

Maciunas' system contains a few anomalies. For example, he includes a heading called Uology. This apparent neologism suggests a science of 'u'. Of course, there is no traditional science of Uology, but the possibility of such a science suggests the play between the particular and the general discussed above. Another suggestive neologism is flexography, which may hint at a flexible writing practice - a way to write in the Fluxacademy. In terms of how the Machine organizes information, it lists the term food’ under light'; it lists “light' under 'chemical'; and 'chemical' under 'engineering'. This suggestive organization makes one rethink the way we normally classify the notion of food. In another organizational aberration, it lists 'textual criticism' under 'philology'; 'philology' under 'cybernetics'; and 'cybernetics' under biological sciences' (which appears as two separate headings). It also lists 'cybernetics' both under 'applied maths' and under physiology'. In terms of organisational suggestiveness, the art and design section is the most interesting because it appears to function as a mise-enabyme for the rest of the memory grid. Everything in the rest of the classification grid is at least suggested in the art and design section. In contrast to most classifications of art and design, however, sculpture has no listing, and painting and drawing have only minor listings. In most traditional taxonomies those three listings would be the dominant areas.  

Maciunas' classification is different in many ways. It does not quite match a mere description of art and design. One possibility suggested by the classification is how a category can shift from one heading to another; for example, it lists 'cinema' under 'photography', but contains a special listing for 'expanded cinema'. What Maciunas does in this work, and in his chart on the history of art movements, is to provoke new possibilities through the unusual classification of information. The startlingly wide scope of the art and design classification includes wars, orgies, prisons, clouds, fountains. shells, insects, food, cybernetics ... Including all or any of these headings in discussions of art and design makes the system a provocation as much as a description. How, for example, can one make insects into art or how are they already aesthetic or part of design?  

Other than these few anomalies, the Learning Machine does not, at first, appear to diverge from traditional taxonomies of knowledge. On closer examination, however, there is one key difference. The information is not structured in epochal categories - that is, the Learning Machine does not structure the categories under headings according to historical chronologies, movements or periods, nor does it organize information according to authors. artists, inventors, leaders or other individual systems. Much of the knowledge taught in universities, and especially what is taught in secondary schools, depends on these kinds of marker for legitimacy. We rarely find departments or pedagogical methods based on the premises of a taxonomy that organizes information in an alternative to history and 'great men'. In contrast, Maciunas' Learning Machine reworks the frames of reference for organizing knowledge: it suggests alternatives to disseminating that knowledge; and it can function as a generative device to produce knowledge structures through interaction within and among our frames of reference. These interactions (for example, asking why orgies and wars are included as art and design) suggest more than a semiotic reading of culture as designed. It suggests that culture and taxonomies are open to art and design. It suggests that in an open exchange of knowledge, even nonsense may play a crucial role in learning. And it Suggests that those who risk nothing, those who give no part of the self to the learning experience will never understand either Uology or flexography. Fluxus wanted to make conceptual cognitive maps more mobile. One way to do that was by inventing kits and boxes that directly addressed these conceptual issues, and by inventing tools like the Learning Machine. [...]

# Art In-Formation: American Art under the Impact of New Media Culture//2013  

With the spread and increased accessibility of new communications channels in the mid twentieth century, many conceptual artists began to explore the network structure of technological media. By the end of the 1960s, the notion of the information society had entered the social theoretical discourse,inspiring artists to experiment with public communications systems, including print media (newspapers, journals, artists' books, multiples, copy art, billboards), postai services (mail art), television and fax transmission, and computer technology (net art) as avenues of creative expression and as potential tools for critical engagement. The field of information, previously considered to belong to the sphere of mass communication and thought to contradict genuine artistic endeavour, surfaced as the new cultural a priori, which challenged and redefined artistic practices. Anticipated by the programmatic agenda of media interventions by the Situationist International movement in France, artists in the United States - among them Dan Graham, Richard Serra, Allan Kaprow, Nam June Paik, Hans Haacke, Ed Ruscha, John Baldessari, Robert Smithson, Sol LeWitt, Vito Acconci, Stanley Brouwn, On Kawara and Lawrence Weiner - responded to the aesthetic, ideological and political challenge posed by information technologies by actively engaging in their organizational dynamic. Since information and communication were being discussed as key issues in society's ability to maintain control over economic and social relations, the role of art and creative processes had to be redefined. The potential of information to facilitate economic advancement and social emancipation became a central aspect of public debate on the new technoculture. Developed alongside Marshall McLuhan's thesis, articulated in Understanding Media: The Extensions of Man (1964), that information could function instrumentally as a form of innovation and resistance, the trope of the information society not only shaped the collective imagination but also contributed to the fascination with the reality-shaping myth of codes and data that facilitated the advancement of high-tech production modes and the appropriation of them in the formulation of a new perspective for artistic practice. In fact, McLuhan's ideas significantly influenced a newly envisaged liaison of art and communication media conceptualized as aesthetic interventions, if not as overtly political activism. Art as information could be practised in collective constellations while connecting far-flung locations, diverse environments and distant temporal zones, which, in McLuhan's vision, converged in ‘the total involvement in all-inclusive nowness'2 The notion of unlimited communication and transport, often referred to in contemporary rhetoric as the new frontier of late capitalism, envisioned the world as a global system in which the media enabled the flow of information and capital to break free from national boundaries.  

Conceptual art and its transmissive logic of 'dematerialization' proved to be highly compatible with the structural components of information media.3 During the 1960s Dan Graham experimented with words and ciphers arranged in patterns that resembled units of information, formatted to enter the channels of media distribution. Graham's graphic structures - texts, diagrams, charts, typographic patterns, photographs and questionnaires - were expressly designed for reproduction in the pages of magazines and were meant to integrate seamlessly with their platforms of display. Such concepts aspired not only to the sign structure of informational language but also to the idea of omnipresence in the public domain. Beyond their formal features, which assimilate the algorithms of computer programs through the systematic accumulation of letters and numbers, these conceptual works challenged the traditional notion of art as a static material entity. Graham's works from this phase of his career directly engage with McLuhan's idea that 'information has detached itself from such solid commodities as stone and papyrus'4 Freed from material manifestation, the abstract concept of information structurally converges with Graham's fluid, signoriented transitional formulas that anticipate realization in the process of arbitrary permutation over the course of infinite dissemination. At the same time, Graham's appropriation of standardized evaluation procedures - such as the multiple-choice questionnaire - implied a feedback structure, incorporating the responses of people (as documented in various reproductions of Graham's LIKES: A Computer-Astrological Dating Placement Service showing filled-out versions of the forms). Calibrated for proliferation in the established systems of communication, the semantic structure of these machine-readable sign constellations functions like a vector that transforms in the course of its activation and displacement into a 'social sign' (Graham's term). Likewise, Graham's work Schema ( March 1966) lists a set of editorial and design specifications - (Number of) adjectives, (Number of) adverbs, (Percentage of) area not occupied by type', and so forth - leaving the choice of 'exact data' as wellas the components' order in their final form' to 'the editor of the publication where it is to appear'.6 The infinite possibilities for the reconfiguration of the piece aim at an evolutionary development, which ultimately transforms into a poetic abstraction emerging from its arbitrary realization. Published in various journals, the changing features of these concepts reflect their context specificity and at the same time their open accessibility, although this proves to be dependent on the half-life period of attention granted to the content of magazines and media emissions in general. Graham commented in several essays on the vagrant nature of his concepts and his understanding of art's realization as a process 'in-formation'.7 These writings clearly reveal an effort to reach beyond a merely appropriative, formal approximation of digitized computer language or electronic content management systems toward a new epistemological framework that situated processoriented, performative and ephemeral art forms in relation to the internal logic of information, namely, programming and planning. In detailed discussions of works by Serra, LeWitt, Carl Andre, Donald Judd, Bruce Nauman and Yoko Ono, Graham's essay 'Subject Matter', issued in 1969 in the artist's publication End Moments, exercises a media-theoretical reading of ‘kinaesthetic' reception processes demanded by sculptural or performative concepts that vary in space and time. Transitive structures, shifting between the place and periodicity of collective or individual audience relations, undergird Graham's informational equation of art: “(Systems of) information (in-formation) exist somewhere halfway between material and concept, without being either one'.8  

Graham's in-formation' theory was flanked by those of other conceptual artists who were simultaneously exploring communication processes and operative information systems by appropriating their symbolic logic. Weiner addressed the art spectator as the recipient of information in such works as AN ACCUMULATION OF INFORMATION TAKEN FROM HERE TO THERE (1969), the concept of which he described thus [in the accompanying Statement of Intent]: \*1. The artist may construct the piece / 2. The piece may be fabricated / 3. The piece need not be built / Each being equal and consistent with the intent of the artist / the decision as to condition rests with the receiver upon the | occasion of receivership'9 Baldessari saw the future of his art as serving as 'straight information' and therefore began burning all of his earlier paintings in June 1969, shortly before he presented documentation of this radical and likewise symbolic gesture at Jack Burnham's exhibition 'Software / Information technology: its new meaning for art', the following year.1o  

A succession of landmark exhibitions addressed these artistic developments. 'The Machine as Seen at the End of the Mechanical Age', staged at The Museum of Modern Art, New York, in 1968, marked the historical threshold to the postindustrial age by directing a retrospective view toward the beginnings of a machine aesthetic in art, while Maurice Tuchman's exhibition Art and Technology', held at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art in 1971, prompted a critical debate about the role of private industry in the development of innovative artforms.11 The Museumof ModernArt's groundbreaking 1970show\*Information', curated by Kynaston McShine, offered the first record of the growing cultural awareness of the informationalization of contemporary society; more than 95 artists were invited to contribute. McShine saw the vanishing point of the paradigm shift from the industrial age to the information society not in the electronic revolution per se but, rather, in a new ‘sense of mobility' and fast transmission in conjunction with the strong impact of visual imagery circulating 'in the newspapers or periodicals, on television or in the cinema'.12  

In his view, books and magazines remained central sources of information. This theory was mirrored programmatically in the exhibition's catalogue, which not only assimilated the format of a journal but was also considered 'a necessary adjunct to the exhibition'. In tune with McLuhan's prophecy, McShine stressed the pivotal importance of magazines as popular information media even in the 'global village', since the availability of publications like Time relied on worldwide distribution networks before computerized information transfer had reached a global scope.3 Moreover, McShine predicted that artists would have to confront growing competition in the form of the flow of images and information circulating in the mass media, particularly in documentary art forms. Multiple insertions of double-page picture collages, tacitly juxtaposing newspaper images showing anti-war protests, indigenous peoples, Woodstock, environmental pollution, Mick Jagger, or a key scene from Michelangelo Antonioni's 1970 film Zabriskie Point with iconic moments from art history featuring Yves Klein, Marcel Duchamp, Gordon Matta-Clark or Allan Kaprow illustrate McShine's vision of an aesthetic confluence of popular visual culture and novel approaches to art and creative practice. 'An artist', according to McShine, 'certainly cannot compete with a man on the moon in the living room'.l4 Not coincidentally, a still from the 1969 live television broadcast of Neil Armstrong's first steps on the moon appears on a double-page spread at the centre of the catalogue, serving as a symbolic reference point for the exhibition's emphatic argument. The visual taxonomy of its confrontational rhetoric was meant to draw attention to the challenges facing fine art in the contemporary information society and emphasize that artists would ultimately need to fathom the possibilities of working with mass media to tap new and wider audiences, beyond the walls of museums and galleries. McShine considered it essential to expand the idea of art by traversing the media-specific boundaries of painting, sculpture, drawing, graphics, photography, theatre, music, dance and poetry:  

Such distinctions have become increasingly blurred. Many of the highly intellectual and serious young artists represented here have addressed themselves to the question of how to create an art that reaches out to an audience larger than that which has been interested in contemporary art in the last few decades. Their attempt to be poetic and imaginative, without being either aloof or condescending, has led them into the communications areas that INFORMATION reflects.15  

McShine's heuristic project heralded a competitive positioning of art and aesthetic manifestations in the contemporary visual order. His rhetoric ambiguously conjured both anxiety and a sense of opportunity with the intention of drawing attention to the potential of new media while at the same time emphasizing the need to re-situate art as a critical agent within contemporary visual culture. In a dialectic sense, this engagement alone would, according to McShine, ensure art's and artists' public recognition by an emerging information society.  

Burnham's exhibition ‘Software / Information technology: its new meaning for art, held at the Jewish Museum, New York (16 September to 8 November 1970), and at the Smithsonian Institution, Washington, DC (16 December 1970 t0 14 February 1971), aimed at a more radical understanding of informational demands. Highlighted by the exhibition's programmatic title, Burnham's approach to the paradigm shift in ‘late modern technocratic society' left the traditional notion of the art object even more rigorously behind, equating operational constellations of art and non-art as a means of exemplifying the scientific move towards 'modes of organization and the instrumental concern of maximizing organizational efficiency and utility'.16 The exhibition included realtime systems such as Hans Haacke's News (1969-70), which consisted of five teletype machines connected to commercial wire agencies that produced yards and yards of paper filled with information about current events from around the world, and his Visitors' Profile (1970), in which two voting boxes with photoelectric counters registered the ballots of visitors who were invited to answer questions on a current political issue.17 Likewise, 'Software' featured works that demonstrated automatized information processes in interactive feedback with living components, offering a model of an 'intelligent environment'. Seek, a work conceptualized by Nicholas Negroponte, a professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, in collaboration with the university's Architecture Machine Group, consisted of desert gerbils placed in a habitat of Plexiglas blocks that were constantly rearranged by a robotic arm. The idea was that an observing machine would register the animals' interactions with their environment and “learn' about their living preferences'. This live-fed system was meant to simulate a 'cybernetic world model' and a behaviourist laboratory for observation and experimentation' that blurred distinctions between art, science and information technology.18 According to the art historian Matthew Rampley, 'Software' became the epitome of a novel theory that recognized 'a more detailed exposition of the meaning of system' and 'its role as a theoretical framing' of contemporary art practices.!9 Many of the artists who participated in both Software′ and “Information' (Acconci, Baldessari, Haacke, Weiner, Douglas Huebler and Joseph Kosuth) were, like Burnham, invested in the idea of informational rather than object-oriented artistic production, as Les Levine made explicit in his comment in the Softwarecatalogue:  

In many cases an object is of much less value than the software concerning the object. The object is the end of a system. The software is an open continuing system. The experience of seeing something first hand is no longer of value in a software controlled society, as anything seen through the media carries just as much energy as first hand experience. We do not question whether the things that happen on radio or television have actually occurred. The fact that we can confront them mentally through electronics is sufficient for us to know that they exist. In the same way, most of the art that is produced today ends up as information about art.?o  

Underscoring the 'value of information' as'the currency of the post-industrial age', both shows were exponents of the political and social activism of their time.21 Their transgressive concepts reckoned with the dynamics of a rapidly expanding informational economy and the irreversible move toward immaterial labour. Whereas McShine's curatorial concepts suggested the need for artists to capture unallocated cultural territories for aesthetic and critical engagement to face the demands of the new globalized social order, Burnham's theoretical framing saw the production of art itself as an information-processing system, before the commercialization of computer technology had even fully unfurled. Although some criticized the in-formation paradigm as inappropriate for art discourse, Burnham insisted that instead of privileging technological art and immaterial production, his exhibition meant to point to 'the information technologies as a pervasive environment badly in need of the sensitivity traditionally associated with art'.22 Today, this claim could be seen in consonance with the French philosopher Jacques Ranciere's argument about art's potential to redistribute sensibilities and therefore enable a politically challenging aesthetic practice.?3

# David Askevold On Projects of the 1970s//2011  

I met Gerry Ferguson at the Kansas City Art Institute where he was teaching art history. A few years later Nova Scotia College of Art and Design hired Gerry, Garry Kennedy and Pat Kelly, who had all attended school together and were friends. At Nova Scotia they were looking for another artist to teach sculpture. I flew up, interviewed, and was hired.[...]  

After teaching for a year in the newly formed Foundation department, 1 proposed a course called 'Projects'. I had the idea to bring professional working artists into the classroom to work directly with the students. I...]  

Dan Graham was the first visitor I brought to the school. My original idea was to bring in a new artist every six weeks. That was too expensive for the administration, so I began by inviting various artists to the school to give talks and hold small seminars. Dan's first talk focused on systems and the photographs of Muybridge. With student help, Dan began making a piece and over the years was a repeat visitor to thecollege.  

I invited James Lee Byars up for a week to perform and speak. I thought Byars aesthetics very theatrical, romantic, mystical and not really part of the conceptual New York art mafia at the time, which included Robert Barry, Doug Huebler, Joseph Kosuth, Lawrence Weiner and to some extent Mel Bochner. [...] I connected with both Kosuth and Weiner. Lawrence gave me the names of a number of people to include for the class. Because of cost restraints, I couldn't bring everyone I wanted to Nova Scotia and came up with a compromise. 1 composed a letter asking artists to propose projects for the students to complete. The artists would send in instructions and the students would make the work. The responses were enthusiastic and we went forward with the projects.  

I continued to work on my game pieces and began some new ones that combined photographs and text. The format of the photo-and-text pieces came out of the conventions formalized by Chris Burden and Doug Huebler, who documented their works by using black-and-white photographs with brief descriptions. By the early seventies this became such a convention that it turned into a style that was copied in all corners of art departments in the US and Canada. When poorly used, it was worse than embarrassing. It was simply bad art. I never thought conceptual art should be a style. I thought of it as a way to question assumptions and to comment on art history, and also on subjects outside of art, in order to expand the boundaries of art beyond the tastes and styles that had been dominant for so long. I...]  

Lucy Lippard visited a few times. When I was in New York we would meet up, usually in her loft, which at the time was in Soho. In 1970 Lucy was responsible for getting a student and two faculty members from Nova Scotia, including myself, into the “Information' exhibition curated by Kynaston McShine at The Museum of Modern Art. I exhibited Shoot, Don't Shoot, which was a zero-sum game matrix. I combined two images of a gunfight from Sam Peckinpah's movie The Ballad of Cable Hogue that were shot with a 35 mm still camera directly from the screen at the Capital Theatre in Halifax. The piece was only about four inches by twelve inches. Around the same time, I made a second version on paper, which is in the collection of The Museum of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles.  

In the early seventies I made my art using diagrams, either appropriated from game-theory books or constructed from texts found in detective novels. I also made photo-text pieces that combined descriptions of the location of the object represented, personal experiences and fiction. Sometimes the text came first, followed by the photos. Sometimes I took photographs and applied text to them, like newspaper captions where the captions anchor the context, meaning or interpretation of the photo. In most cases I gave the images parallel texts, like stereophonic recordings in which each audio track is individuated from the other. I subsequently used a static camera to document simple mundane tasks. I broke the images down into sound-image juxtapositions; later I began to incorporate narratives into them. [...]  

The Ambit (1975-76), was my last and largest major photo-text piece. It was published in its complete form in 1981, for my mid-career exhibition at the Van Abbemuseum in Eindhoven, Holland, then under the direction of Rudi Fuchs. The nine colour photographs with text are in their collection. The piece came about after I was invited by a publisher and a couple of artists from Italy and Germany to write an article about culture and art. I was brought to a standstill by this request, mainly because I'm not an academic writer. I came up with the idea of developing an entire culture in my head. Usually the text came about while I was driving my car. I began talking silently to myself, in a stream of consciousness. When I would return to the small house on Boutlier's Point, at the edge of the water, I would type out what I remembered, editing and re-editing the quasilegalistic text in which I used unfamiliar language structures.  

The photos followed the texts but did not illustrate them. Rather they were there to reinforce the spirit or feeling of what was being said, which could be rather arbitrary. I carefuily chose where in my small house I would write the text and took photographs of the locations, including the shadows on the carpet, the windows - photographed from the fall into the winter - and some of the bedding in the closets.

The Dilemma of Categories and the Overdetermination of a Business Practice: N.E. Thing Co.//2010  

I... The N.E. Thing Co. (NETCO) was founded in 1966 under the name of N.E. Baxter Thing Co. It had operated since late 1967 under the name of N.E. Thing Co. It was officially incorporated on 16 January 1969, and dissolved in 1978. The National Gallery Environment was to be the most up-to-date and officially sanctioned manifestation of the kind of organization that lain and Elaine (later known as Ingrid) Baxter envisaged as the medium to package and promote a new form of art experience and proposition conceived under the generic product definitions of 'sensitivity information. For Baxter, "Visual Sensitivity Information" (Vsl)' was a generic term for 'all art products'. VSl allowed the user to 'think in a totally new way about the history of art' by effectively eliminating historical periodization and its implied hierarchy between old and new art as well as traditional categories of practice. Instead, as Baxter claimed, All artists, all painters and sculptors are simply 'visual-sensory informers': people who handle our world's information, putting it together in colours and shapes'.!  

Sensitivity information drew attention to the company's unique range of products, their close ties to the 1960s art world, and the preoccupations of a small group of artists who were trying to redefine the nature and functions of artwork. As openly proclaimed by its pun-based name, the company's business interests were remarkably wide-ranging and its ambitions were practically limitless. However, its products remained ambiguous and oddly exclusive. They seemed to proclaim an allegiance to a company that bridged art, art history and a ubiquitous world of consumer products whose primary symbol was plastic: that most modern and universal material. But their relationship to the world was publicly defined by NETCO's new esoteric, information-based paradigm of knowledge production and sensory experience.  

Moreover, the business model was ambiguous. The NETcO Environment at the  

National Gallery was conceived as a corporate environment, but it was also billed as a 'visual sensitivity information centre'. This ambiguity points to a confusion in the Environment's attributed functions. Was it an operating business or was it an environmental artwork? Could it have been a grotesquely oversized promotional/ didactic booth of the kind that one might find in a trade show? Because the exhibition's organization embraced both functions simultaneously, it embodied a more complex environmental model than the one implied by the designation of corporate headquarters. The Environment seems to have operated more as a kind of meta-environment that encapsulated in a total fashion the nature, functions and economic matrix of a business organization, its communications systems and promotional technologies. Finally, the Environment was also publicized in less challenging terms as a playful and ironic multifaceted artistic activity that exceeded its corporate and institutional boundaries. The National Gallery Newsletter of 27 May contains references to 'demonstrations of plastic products', 'movies', a 'deepfrozen environment' with frozen sculptures in a series of freezers, ongoing telecopier works, ‘an ever-changing photographic exhibit, and the modification of a 'plot of land'. The range of listed activities mirrors the company's incorporated mandate to 'manufacture, import, export', as well as to buy and sell 'and otherwise' deal 'in things of all kinds'. It also introduces the reader to the Baxters' ambitions. While they were certainly in line with the professional aspirations of many other artists in the late 1960s, their adopted business model proposed a new frame of reference for the creation (manufacture), display (packaging), and reception (consumption) of artworks. In this sense a national museum was the perfect environment to present NETcO's ideas and products.  

# ACTS and ARTS  

One of the company's activities that also defined the particular nature of its methodological practice consisted of dividing the world, through acts of aesthetic judgement, into two basic categories of Visual Sensitivity Information (Vsl): aesthetically claimed things (ACTs) and aesthetically rejected things (ARTs). Accession to each category was registered and certified by quasi-legal documents that reflected and supported the original acts of judgement. Thus, on the one hand, the word 'Art' was transferred into the domain of the everyday through a deft play on its spelling that allowed it to conserve its original meaning while also signifying its diametrical opposite (aesthetically rejected things), thereby paving the way for a different, yet traditionally historically filiated, range of artworks and experiences. On the other hand, selected elements ('things') of the everyday world were adopted as artworks by means of a quasi-legal process of selection under the heading of ACT, or aesthetically claimed thing. ARTs and ACTs were therefore bound together in an uneasy tension and economy, supporting yet contradicting each other's parameters and conditions of existence. Moreover, each ART and ACT actively promoted the question of what could and what could not be considered art while appearing to sponsor a new definition of the artist as corporate representative.  

If ARTs and ACTs functioned like the complementary elements of a Saussurian sign, whose arbitrary significance (word/concept) could only emerge in relation to a total system in which each element of the sign found its place and meaning. then they could only do so through the vested powers of a corporate signature that was legally and aesthetically guaranteed by individual knowledge and taste. These definitions and contradictions reflected the play of ambiguity that was one of the hallmarks of NETcO's corporate post-studio (art) practice.  

ARTs and ACTs represented particular states of aesthetic invisibility/visibility with specific documentary attributes (authentication by way of standardized printed forms, company seals, labels and official signatures that were ultimately legitimated by the N.E. Thing Co. name). While the play they initiated had its roots in a number of earlier works (such as Robert Morris's Untitled [Statement of Aesthetic Withdrawall from 1963) that challenged, through legal procedures, the aesthetic status of the artwork, they adopted a slightly different strategy. Instead of appropriating a Duchampian strategy of circumventing the aesthetic judgment underlying the creation of an artwork through operations based on chance or through the adoption of a stance of aesthetic disinterestedness (readymade), and rather than attempting strategically to stress or even opt out of the art world, the Baxters chose, in the ubiquitous and intangible spirit of the newly emerging age of knowledge production and management, to treat everything as information - the most radical, scientifically up-to-date and elementary attribute of all things and processes. In a gesture that was both an ironic comment on and a pragmatic recognition of the artist's future in this kind of society, they had chosen to incorporate themselves legally in order to function ideally, if not always in practice, through the concept of a corporate body and mind.  

Information was not only a medium for the translation of invisibility into visibility in an emerging post-industrial, service-oriented economy, but it was also the ultimate act of reduction, of democratic levelling to a basic and common standard of equality. Information became, in a NETCO business-governed cosmology, an artistic lingua franca of the common man's claims to free access to the pleasures of creativity, personal expression and appreciation. If VSI served as the measure of the success of this form of democracy because of its capacity to encompass and treat everything on equal terms, ACTs and ARTs served as the measure of its failure to separate itself from a traditional system of art and the authority of the artist that it had cultivated, even if this authority was strategically subsumed by a company's economy and system of manufacture.  

The successes and failures of NETcO's VSI-based strategies of democratic homogenization also applied to its engagement with a major national art institution. In so far as the environment that the company produced on the first floor of the National Gallery of Canada was inspired by the layout of a traditional 1950s or 60s middle-sized company, it was a form that could easily be conceived as a statement of the possibilities of art to both comment on and integrate with a broader Canadian economy (at the level of a certain systems-based, economic logic, if not completely in practice). But integration implied accommodation, which suggested that participation was acceptable. In this sense, the 1969 NETCO Environment is an extension, an apotheosis, and paradoxically) an ironic commentary on the 1960s artistic strategies of blurring the boundaries between art and life. It achieved this unique position because of the way that it proposed (again with a heightened sense of irony in the figures of company president and vice-president, simulated corporate headquarters, a range of products, and company name) the integration of the artist with her or his society as a potentially responsible and socially productive economic agent. The irony, of course, resided in the simple fact that the whole exercise was a spectacular piece of theatre, a refined happening' that was simultaneously anchored in the latest and most advanced artistic practices and in the material and symbolic trappings of a traditional corporate environment. [...]  

The Baxters' company endorsed the artistic values and possibilities of a general business model and corporate structure of operations, and publicized and marketed these values directly or indirectly through its products. While a business model and practice were imported into the art world, company products were clearly conceived in relation to the recent history of contemporary art, with its melding of Pop, post-Pop, Happenings, conceptual and cybernetic art, with an emerging social and political consciousness. lt was in this rich and rapidly changing environment that NETcO began to produce post-Pop art (inflatable landscapes, etc.) and quasi-documentary works (ACTs and ARTs) that were informed by the possibilities offered by the concept of information.  

The concept of information allowed artists effectively to circumvent the question of the 'correct', or historically sanctioned, medium that had dominated art up to the 1960s Pop art movement, as well as the post-Duchampian question of what was, or what was not to be, considered ‘art', by simply dissolving questions through the application of a new and common definition for the 'content' of a work of art. The concept of information promised to eliminate the need for inventing or developing visual or materially based counter-strategies under the auspices of succeeding stylistic movements that were more often than not authenticated by the label of the 'avant-garde'. In their place, it seemed to promote a common pan-human (even if distinctly Western) international and democratic frame of reference that was directly anchored in the most advanced theories of human and machine-based communication. Information' also points beyond its more obvious communications and data transmission connotations to the world of computing technologies, their binary digital logic and beyond, to this logic's ability to represent the world's data content in elementary - 1/0, On/ Off or True/False - bits of information. Information was therefore the product of a new model of how the world could be represented, as a total system composed of interlocking intersystems with a common currency (bits and bytes) that no longer respected material or cultural boundaries. Its adoption by artists promoted the values of a global economy involving the exchange of data and ideas, where the concept of medium could take on a different meaning and even eclipse the content it transmitted.[...]

# Elizabeth R. Shaw “Information'Press Release//1970  

[...I INFORMATION, an international report on recent activity of young artists, will be on view at The Museum of Modern Art from July 2 through September 20. Selected by Kynaston McShine, Associate Curator, Department of Painting and Sculpture, the exhibition and catalogue contain work by more than 150 men and women from 15 countries including artists from Argentina, Brazil, Canada and Yugoslavia, being shown in this country for the first time.  

'Many of the highly intellectual and serious young artists represented here have addressed themselves to the question of how to create an art that reaches out to an audience larger than that which has been interested in contemporary art in the last few decades', Mr McShine says. Their attempt to be poetic and imaginative, without being either aloof or condescending,has led them into the communications areas that INFORMATION reflects.: The only common denoninator is that all are trying to extend the idea of art beyond traditional categories.  

Several pieces in the exhibition can only be realized with the active participation of people either in or outside the Museum. Stig Broegger (Denmark) has placed low wooden platforms around the galleries and in other parts of the city and metropolitan area; the exhibition will include photographs of people's reactions to these objects - using them or watching others use them.  

Group Frontera (Argentina) has set up a television tape-recording booth in the Museum; visitors answer questions and not only become the subject of TV video tape recording, but also watch themselves live and on delayed tape on TV screens in the galleries. 'The object of our work is to formulate a theory of the role of mass media in the identification of a society's culture, the Group says. Poems, selected by Giorno, have been recorded and can be heard on phones in the galleries or by calling (212) 956--7032 from anywhere. Hans Haacke will poll Museum visitors. He has provided two voting boxes with photo-electric counters, ballots for each visitor to answer either/or questions referring to a current socio-political issue and a chart recording results. Oiticica (Brazil) has constructed a 12-foot high 'nest' structure on, and in which, he invites the public to climb, rest, sit. 'You can say it is a “leisure proposition" using different sorts of materials which are not important as such ... but in the way they can be used during the exhibition.'  

Other works consist of documentation - in the form of photographs, photostats, drawings or written instructions - of works that have or have not taken place. Robert Barry describes an event which occurred March 4 when a litre of argon was returned to the atmosphere. For the catalogue, he contributes ART WORK, 1970:  

It is always changing.   
It has order.   
It doesn't have a specific place.   
Its boundaries are not fixed.   
It affects other things.   
It may be accessible but go unnoticed.   
Part of it may also be part of something else.   
Some of it is familiar.   
Some of it is strange.   
Knowing of it changes it.  

George Brecht's unrealized proposals, drawn in ink on printed maps, are to move mountains and islands: Displaced-Replaced Mass (1969 Nevada), earth works by Michael Heizer, is projected on the gallery walls at large scale. Part of Walter De Maria's representation is an article on him in Time magazine (2 May 1969), 'High Priest of Danger, blown up to the scale of one foot to one inch. Hans Hollein has selected various locations (shown in photographs) which he declares as sites for non-building, subterranean buildings, or modifications of the surface. \*The general attitude of the artists in this exhibition', Mr McShine comments, is straightforward, friendly, coolly involved and allows experiences which are refreshing. It enables us to participate, quite often as in a game; at other times it seems almost therapeutic, making us question ourselves and our responses to unfamiliar stimuli. The constant demand is a more aware reaction to our natural and artificial enviroments. These artists are questioning our prejudices, asking us to renounce our inhibitions, and if they are re-evaluating the nature of art, they are also asking that we reassess what we have always taken for granted as our accepted and cultural conditioned aesthetic response to art. In the re-evaluation of their situation,some artists have attempted to extend themselves into their environment and to workwith itsproblems and events.Some havebecome aware of their own bodies, in a way that has nothing to do with the accepted idea of the self-portrait, but more with the questioning and observing of sensations. Others have embraced natural phenomena in ways that are at times romantic and at times bordering on scientific.  

An intellectual climate that embraces Marcel Duchamp, Ad Reinhardt, Buckminster Fuller, Marshall McLuhan, the I Ching, the Beatles, Claude LeviStrauss, John Cage, Yves Klein, Herbert Marcuse, Ludwig Wittgenstein and theories of information and leisure inevitably adds to the already complex situation. It is even more enriched by the implications, for example, of Dada, and more recently happenings and Pop and 'minimal' art.  

Joseph Kosuth's One and Three Chairs consists of a photographic enlargement of the chair, a photographic enlargement of the dictionary definition of the word chair, and the actual chair. He says:  

In a sense, then, art becomes as 'serious' as science or philosophy, which don't have 'audiences' either. It is interesting or it isn't, just as one is informed or isn't. Previously, the artist's 'special' status merely relegated him into being a high priest (or witch doctor) of show business ... This conceptual art, then, is an inquiry by artists that understand that artistic activity is not solely limited to the framing of art propositions, but further, the investigation of the function, meaning and use of any and all (art) propositions, and their consideration within the concept of the general term'art'.  

Every unit of an (art) proposition is only that which is functioning with a larger framework (the proposition) and every proposition is only a unit which is functioning within a larger framework (the investigation) and every investigation is only a unit which is functioning within a larger framework (my art) and my art is only a unit which is functioning within a larger framework (the concept 'art') and the concept art is a concept which has a particular meaning at a particular time but which exists only as an idea used by living artists and which ultimately exists only as information. [..]  

'The activity of these artists is to think of concepts that are broader and more cerebral than the expected “product" of the studio. With the sense of mobility and change that pervades their time, they are interested in ways of rapidly exchanging ideas, rather than embalming the idea in an “object". However, the idea may reside on paper or film', Mr McShine says.  

The increasing use of the mail, telegrams and telex machines for transmission of works themselves and of ideas is represented in the work of many artists in the exhibition. Christine Kozlov shows only a telegram; N.E. Thing, Co., Ltd. (Ilan Baxter, President), is transmitting images from Canada by telex and telecopier into the galleries during the run of the show, as well as exhibiting 27 photographs of ART (aesthetically rejected things) and ACT (aesthetically claimed things).  

Art and Project, founded in Amsterdam in 1968, is represented entirely by copies of the Bulletin they publish. Vito Acconci has set up a post office box for all his mail sent to the galleries which he calls 'Service Area'. The artist says, 'the piece is performed (unawares) by the postal service, as the mail travels to the Museum, and by the senders of the mail, wherever they happen to be. I perform the piece actively by going to the Museum to pick up my mail.' New York Graphics Workshop urges visitors to send a self-addressed stamped envelope if they wish to receive 'something' at the close of the exhibition. Paul Pechter is distributing handbills stating that anyone wishing to locate his contribution - randomly placed, unlabelled devices - may receive exact information on their whereabouts by sending him a stamped, self-addressed envelope.  

Other artists offer more tangible, but still provocative, objects; Christopher Cook has printed the time and date of different events on nine sheets of paper which have been hung throughout the galleries. Mel Bochner drew a circle in black chalk on a gallery wall and filled it with words and numerals describing its dimensions. Siah Armajani has made visible one computer activity by stacking the total print-out of all the digits between zero and one into a 5o0 pound, 9 1/2 foot tall column of 25,974 pages, representing 28.5714 hours of print-out time.  

More than 40 films, ranging in length from three minutes to eight hours, are shown on Olivetti's ‘information machine' or 'visual jukebox' in the galleries. Under this umbrella-like structure, people stand and watch 4o individual screens. Many of the films will also be shown in the Museum auditorium at noon on Wednesdays throughout the course of the show.  

\*The films and video tapes in the exhibition are often described as 'minimally structured' which means that the content is non-narrative and that the style, while almost an extension of cinema verite, is like so much of the other works in the show, simply a method of distributing the visual information that interests the artist', Mr McShine says.[...]  

Elizabeth R. Shaw (Director of Public Relations, The Museum of Modern Art), extracts from press release (2 July 1970) for ‘Information'(New York: The Museum of Modern Art, 1970) 1-5.  

# Les Levine Information Fall-out//1971  

[...] The Museum of Modern Art's “Information': the style of the show was photographic, while at the same time there was no style. While there were some eighty artists in the show, there were no artists in the show: no one stood out any more than another. Every movement previous, such as Pop, Op, Colour Painting, always had its figures. In pop, it would be Andy Warhol, Roy Lichtenstein, Oldenburg and a few others. In colour painting, it would be Louis, Noland, and on down the line. In 'Information', it was clear that the only outstanding figure was the curator. The curator in this situation becomes the artist. We have a 'Woodstock" situation at the Museum of Modern Art. All of these people are brought together to make this show under the authorship of the curator. The curator presents the mediawith apackage.  

The value of shows like this is that, because they are so open, they tend to have no taste or choice position. Now having no taste or choice position is valuable because it is a supportive position. It supports the socio-economics of the art community. So it is decided that, rather than make breakthroughs with artists who hit home runs, you give the overall scene a vehicle to work with, an open communication system. If you see a show with eighty or more people in it, all of the people dissipate into one person, the curator, and the people who are not in it stand out more than the people who are in it.  

A careful selection was made so that none of the works would be outstanding. So none of the works could in fact actually exist as themselves, as personal elements belonging to a particular artist. The ideas were all interchangeable with any of the other ideas in the show. It is clear now that ideas are not the propertyofanybody.  

If you present the media with a show which apparently has no particular artist, they will make one of the people involved 'the artist'. And seeing that none of the artists stand out any more than the others, the person who becomes 'the artist' is the curator. The curator has made an artistic breakthrough. The curator has not only gathered all the information, he has also made information: an artistic system which is supportive to the members of that system equally, rather than a system which supports particular figures in it and downgrades others.  

“Information' came at a time when the Art Workers' Coalition had its many fights with the Museum of Modern Art. You can't take the energy away from a powerful system without giving that system a considerable amount of energy. The Art Workers' Coalition was constantly attacking the Museum of Modern Art. The Museum of Modern Art then puts on this giant “Information' show, which includes all of its enemies. It becomes more powerful than it ever was before. It gets rid of the idea that there are going to be any further personal breakthroughs in art. Because the idea of a personal breakthrough means that there is a particular set of facts or group of information or sensitivity to a situation which is particular to a specific person or group of people. However, it is impossible for any one person to have more facts than any other person now.  

Shows of this type are presented as: This is the art of now. However, they are not the beginning of anything; they are the end. They show very clearly what art has been like in the past. In presenting the “Information' show, the Museum made it virtually impossible for any artist of integrity to continue making pieces about information. Many people will say that the effect of this show was to demythologize art. I don't think they demythologize art. They put art in line with social conditions.[..]  

Technology has had a greater effect on the cultural thrust than art. Technology has created political man. It has created political change. It has created aesthetic change. It has created many levels of things that we thought art would.Probably the greatest reason why technology has taken over from art is because art was always technology anyway. The art of the cave painter was a technological art. It was an art of how to do it,how to image the society,how to present society with a working model of itself that would in fact be a 'conceptual tool', a valuable and useful device for the shaping of that society. Now we are arriving back technologicallytocavepainting.We'renowatapointwheretechnologycan present us with a workingmodel of ourselves.  

It is important that we expand the technological environment into a completely bio-technology environment so that we are interconnected very directly with the technology and that we can plug into any area of thinking to create a support system between one another. It is true that we are further apart ideologically than ever before in the world. It is also true that we are closer togetherthanwehave everbeen.  

Where does the art collector fit in? Apart from gathering objects to surround him, which give him a certain sense of place or personal environment, it's also true that collecting art has been a way of socially identifying oneself. The sophisticate now realizes that having a number of paintings on his wall is not going to increase his image to very many people. Buying works of art today would have little value or importance; everybody can buy everything anyway. There are no rich people, only middle-class people. The rich merely have more 'middle class'.  

So the artist will have to create a personal publicity system for the collector. He will have to identify these people to the society. So he has to decide that these people will become media packages. He will package these people in such a manner that they will become information for society. The problem of collecting art objects is that the information reads out more about having money and power than it does about being aesthetically involved or concerned with art. Therefore, if one does have money and power, there is very little value in buying art because it's going to create bad information. Money and power represent personal politics at a time when everyone is trying to get a broader inter-supportive system. The only step left now would be for the collector to become an artist. He must be directly involved in art production. He could do it by selecting various groups of art and showing them in a similar way to that in which the curator of the Museum of Modern Art put on the Information' show, or he could begin to make art which expresses the kind of person that he is, in the kind of environment that he finds himself. Museums will probably undergo an enormously difficult period; it will become evident to them that there will be an enormous increased production from artists. And the collection of this production will cause real-estate problems, will cause economic problems, and will also cause political problems. What it will probably be important for museums to be doing within the next few years will be bringing in the various underprivileged social groups in our society. Presenting the museum as a community cultural laboratory rather than a place that sets up high standards and aesthetics.  

The absurdity of formal art criticism is that it is pretty much umbilical to collecting. Formal art criticism must be judged as organized power. For all that formal art criticism hates commercialism, it always acts as a very straight commercial for the art it's talking about. In formal criticism when you say, 'Something is good', you're saying, buy it. When you say, It is bad', you're saying, 'Do not buy it.:' So formal criticism will find itself with the same problem that the collector finds himself in. People do not want to be told constantly what their taste should be any more. Good taste, at this time, in technical democracy, ends up as nothing more than taste prejudice. Expressing aesthetic authority over another human being is arrogant.  

The artist must, without question, abdicate. He must realize that his work must not contain authority. It must in fact have the capability to succeed or fail as the viewer wants it. Thereby being much more supportive to the viewer. It must, in fact, be completely devoid of logic. The logical vacuum must be there so that the viewer applies his own logic to it and the work in fact makes itself before the viewer's eyes. So that it becomes a direct reflection of the viewer's consciousness, logic, morals and ethics. The work should act as a feedback mechanism to his own working model.  

Once you have information about something, there is no need to do it. The one thing that so-called 'Do It' activities, such as Woodstock, make absolutely clear, in information terms, is that you do it to get the information. That if you have the information, you don't do it because having the information means it's been done. So what we would have in art is a series of 'doing it' that would create information. Television is pretty much like art in this situation. The only thing that occurs which is of interest to most people is commercials, sports events and newscasts. We will have to get all the people watching television on television so thateveryone'swatching themselves and everyone else  

What we are seeing now is a series of works that are made for the reason that they can be turned into media. Art now reads out as social software: information. Once we know that the purpose is to influence the social software we can do away with art and start influencing the social software directly. Beyond that the artist will probably dissolve,cease to exist in our society as a separate heroic figure.

# From Over- to Sub-Exposure: The Anamnesis of 'Les Immateriaux'//2009  

Although a number of twentieth-century exhibitions are already hailed as ‘landmark exhibitions', one major and highly innovative example has eluded the attention of scholars until recently: Les Immatériaux', co-curated in 1985 for the Centrc Georges Pompidou in Paris by the philosopher Jean-Francois Lyotard and the design historian and theorist Thierry Chaput. Among its many novel features was the fact that it was the first exhibition in which a philosopher played a leading role, opening the door to many other instances where intellectuals would become ad hoc curators. Instead of the standard sequence of white cubes, Lyotard and Chaput divided the entire fifth floor of the museum with large sheets of uncoloured metal mesh hanging from the ceiling. Contrary to the neutral lighting of most exhibition environments, 'Les Immateriaux' offered a theatrical setting - the work of young stage designer Francoise Michel - which played with stark contrasts between spotlit exhibits and areas of near total darkness. In Chaput's words: Decked in demanding grey, illuminated by improbable lighting, with unpredictable ideas allowed to hover, this hour, this day in this year, suspended, rigorously ordered yet without system,‘The Immaterials' exhibit themselves between seeing,feeling and hearing."1  

Importantly, Les Immateriaux' brought together a striking variety of objects, ranging from the latest industrial robots and personal computers to holograms, interactive sound installations and 3D cinema, along with paintings, photographs and sculptures (the latter ranging from an Ancient Egyptian bas-relief to works by Dan Graham, Joseph Kosuth and Giovanni Anselmo). One reason for the heterogeneity of objects represented in 'Les Immateriaux' was that many of the exhibits were chosen by Chaput well before Lyotard was invited to join the project in 1983. Indeed, the Centre de Création Industrielle (CCl) - the more 'sociological' entity devoted to architecture and design within the Centre Pompidou, which initiated Les Immateriaux' - had been planning an exhibition on new industrial materials since at least 1982. Variously titled 'Création et materiaux nouveaux', \*Materiau et creation', \*Materiaux nouveaux et création', and, in its last form, La Matiere dans tous ses états',this exhibition, first scheduled to take place in 1984, already contained many of the innovative features that found their way into‘Les Immateriaux'.  

These features included an emphasis on language,as matter, the immateriality of advanced technological materials (from textiles to plastics and holography), exhibits devoted to recent technological developments in food, architecture.  

music and video, and, crucially, an experimental catalogue produced solely by computer in (almost) real time. The earlier versions of the exhibition also involved many of the future protagonists of Les Immateriaux, such as Jean-Louis Boissier (among several other faculty members of Université Paris Vll, where Lyotard was teaching at the time) and Eve Ritscher (a London-based consultant on holography). Furthermore, Les Immatériaux' benefited from projects pursued concurrently by other groups within the Pompidou which joined Lyotard's and Chaput's project when it was discovered that their themes overlapped. Thus, an exhibition project on music videos initiated by the Musée national d'art moderne was incorporated into Les Immateriaux', and another project on electro-acoustic music developed by Ircam (Institut de Recherche et de Coordination Acoustique/ Musique) also seems to have merged with the 1985 exhibition.  

Although other institutions expressed interest in taking the show, ‘Les Immatériaux' was too much a reflection of the unusual museographic practices of the place where it originated to translate into different contexts, and the show did not tour. For Les Immatériaux' was much more than an 'exhibition', simply understood. It drew upon all the entities within the Centre Pompidou, offering musical performances (including the world premiere of Karlheinz Stockhausen's Kathinkas Gesang), an impressive film programme (titled 'Cine-Immatériaux', curated by Claudine Eizykman and Guy Fihman), a three-day seminar on the relationship between architecture, science and philosophy, as well as three related publications, in addition to the two catalogues.  

'Les Immateriaux' would in fact be among the last exhibitions at the Centre Pompidou to embody the latter's original ambition to be a centre open to all forms of expression, from industrial design and urbanism to painting and performance, instead of a modernist museum based on the neat differentiation between departments according to media.Les Immateriaux' represented, as it were, a hinge in the Centre Pompidou's history, between a more conventional future (the CCl effectively dissolved a few years later, merging with the Musee national d'art moderne) and a certain postmodern idealism that tolerated,even encouraged, the blurring of disciplines and exhibitions with an element of pathos and drama. As Chaput expressed it in 1985, Les Immateriaux' represented 'one of thelast"romantic"experiences'.2  

As the originator of the exhibition, and its main representative within the Centre Pompidou, Chaput played a key role, though he was understandably the less visible of the two co-curators vis-a-vis the public and especially the media. Bernard Blistene was responsible for the selection of most art works in 'Les Immatériaux'. Most but not all: the Egyptian bas-relief was Lyotard's personal choice, and we can assume that Lyotard was responsible for the inclusion of Marcel Duchamp, Daniel Buren and Jacques Monory, since he had written extensively on the three artists prior to his involvement in 'Les Immateriaux'. As for Lyotard himself, he was instrumental not only in securing certain loans and the participation of prominent figures in the exhibition catalogues, but also in designing the exhibition's overarching linguistic structure. As early as spring 1984, Lyotard had suggested the conflation between five French words deriving from the Indo-European root mat (to make by hand, to measure, to build) and the communication model first developed by Harold Lasswell - 'who / says what / in which channel / to whom / with what effects?' - later translated into a communication diagram by Claude Shannon and Norbert Wiener, which Roman Jakobson would apply to, and amend in light of, linguistics. Lyotard's conflation of these communication models with the etymological group of mat- terms was hardly rigorous. What it proposed, however, was an epistemological short-circuit between heterogeneous discourses, the one poetic, the other scientific, to establish the following equivalences: materiau $=$ support (medium), materiel $=$ destinataire (to whom the message is addressed), maternite $=$ destinateur(the message'semitter),matiere $=$ referent(thereferent), and matrice $=$ code (the code).  

The drawings collected in the Album section of the exhibition catalogue indicate that the layout of Les Immateriaux' had reached a near-definitive stage by September 1984. Once past the initial corridor, the visitor would have t0 choose between one of five strands (or valences) leading through the exhibition, each corresponding to one of the five mat- strands. Each mat- strand in turn would incorporate a number of 'zones, with each 'zone' unified by a common soundtrack, audible through headphones distributed to each visitor before entering the exhibition. (The soundtrack, selected by Lyotard's then collaborator and future partner Dolores Rogozinski, and engineered by the Pompidou technician Gerard Chiron, consisted of excerpts of literary and philosophical texts by the likes of Maurice Blanchot and Samuel Beckett.)  

Each 'zone' subdivided into several 'sites', that is, variously sized installations with more or less obvious reference to the mat- strand in which they were included. For example, the Nu vain site designed by Martine Moinot - an active figure in Lyotard's support team at the Centre Pompidou - featured ‘twelve asexual mannequins' with, at the back, 'a screening of a passage from Joseph Losey's film Monsieur Klein alternating with a photo from a concentration camp prisoner'. As the visitor entered this site - one of three in the first 'zone' in the matériau mat- strand - she or he would have heard the voice of the poet and playwright Antonin Artaud ('Pour en fini avec le jugement de Dieu', originally intended to be broadcast on radio in 1948) and Rogozinski ('The Angel'). Thus guided - or, more accurately, misguided - through the exhibition's obscurity by the soundtrack, the isolated visitor of 'Les Immateriaux' would drift from site to site and strand to strand with, as only markers, the switch between voices indicating the passage from one zone to another.  

If no two trajectories through Les Immateriaux' could possibly be alike - given the freedom the visitor had to choose her or his own sequence of 'sites' and 'zones' - Lyotard and Chaput were careful to document the visitors' drifting patterns, devising a dense network of self-indexing nodes both inside and outside of the exhibition. Each visitor to ‘Les Immatériaux' was to receive a magnetic card with which to record the 'sites' she or he went through: upon leaving the exhibition, she or he should have been able to print a hard-copy record of the visit, though this system of 'mise en carte' does not seem to have been implemented.  

Another self-indexing node in ‘Les Immateriaux, “Les Variables Cachees' in 'zone' 12 (matrice strand) allowed visitors, by way of a computer terminal, to provide answers to a set of questions, which contributed to statistical views of the exhibition's public projected on a screen in the same 'site'. Published in 1986, the exhaustive study of ‘Les Immateriaux' by the sociologist Nathalie Heinich constituted another means of measuring and archiving the visitors' movements through, and reactions to, the exhibition.  

The idea of constituting an archive of the communication generated by ‘Les Immateriaux', mediated analogically as well as digitally, also determined the exhibition's catalogues. Instead of the traditional single volume acting as an anticipated record of the completed event, two publications were issued, both of which reflected the process underpinning Les Immateriaux'. The first is a folder with, on one side, L'Inventaire - a sheaf of loose pages each describing one of the exhibition's sixty-one 'sites' - and, on the other, a bound Album of notes and sketches (most of these by Philippe Delis, the scenographer of Les Immatériaux') documenting the exhibition's development from 'La Matiere dans tous ses etats' in 1984 to a snapshot of the installation, presumably taken in early 1985. The second publication, titled Epreuves d'écriture, is a soft-cover bound volume containing the records of a computer-mediated discussion among twenty-six participants - including Daniel Buren, Michel Butor, Jacques Derrida and Isabelle Stengers - of a set of fifty terms proposed by Lyotard. Lyotard held this second volume in high esteem: 'It is probably a “book" that elicits a kind of beauty, as it were, very different from what i was accustomed to. For me it is a great book'' f...  

# 'Painting'  

For Lyotard, one of the most successful ‘postmodern' efforts to translate the spatial  experience  of  the  exhibition  into the  temporal  experience of a manifestation was the philosopher and critic Denis Diderot's reports on the Paris Salons of the 1760s, which relied on narrative devices that played upon - 0r deconstructed to endlessly reconstruct - painting's power to elicit the sublime.  

In Diderot's report on the Salon of 1767, from which Lyotard quotes in the preparatory documents for 'Les Immatériaux, the eighteenth-century critic imagines himself wandering through a landscape modelled after a painting by Joseph Vernet, in the company of a fictitious character (a priest) who claims that painting could never possibly reproduce the sublime beauty of the landscape - which is, of course, based precisely on a Vernet painting. In this intermingling of art and life, of realism and fiction, Lyotard sees Diderot performing 'a kind of rotation' whereby the author 'settles in a fictitious space represented by painting and from there defies all possible painting'.4 This is how the sublime could be said to re-enter 'Les Immateriaux', by way of a derivation from the illustration of the sublime (in the works of Newman, for example) to a non-representational, second-degree sublime that comes to the fore in the act of manifesting, or trying to manifest the sublime at work in painting.  

As opposed to the Enlightenment Bildungsroman and the modern city though which the Baudelairian flaneur or Situationist chronicler recorded his firstperson impressions, Les Immateriaux' refused to grant primacy to the subject's all-powerful subjective eye. Had it aspired to showcase the sublime, ‘Les Immatériaux' would have taken the form of the blockbuster' display (among which, for example, one could cite Olafur Eliasson's The Weather Project at Tate Modern, London, in 2003). Instead, Lyotard's and Chaput's 'manifestation' was to the “large-scale retrospective what Joyce's Ulysses is to the Odyssey', that is, a narrative attempt to make the process of exhibiting manifest. Between Ulysses and the Odyssey, the relation to a putative origin changes, as does the flow of the narrative: chronological and sequential in the latter, heterogeneous and nonlinear in the former. In describing the effect sought by Les Immateriaux', Lyotard frequently invoked Virilio's notion of 'surexposition' ('overexposure' or, equally. 'overexhibition'), by which was meant the transformation of cities into sprawling 'conurbations' where 'the opacity of construction materials is reduced to nothing and the architecture begins to drift, to float in an electronic ether devoid of spatial limits yet inscribed in the singular temporality of an instantaneous broadcast'.5 What distinguishes this sublime cyber-landscape from Lyotard's and Chaput's stagecraft is precisely the exhibition's opacity and depth - its 'difficult' greyness and theatrical obscurity - which impeded the seamless mobility and translucency of Virilio's futuristic vision.  

The fact that the setting for this alternate vision of postmodernism was a 'manifestation' is crucial, for it is through an exhibition conceived as an immersive theatrical environment that the singularity of the modernist eye could be transcended and, at the same time, that transcendence in general, in the sense of Aufhebung, could be shown to be thoroughly unpredictable, literally unforeseeable. And it is precisely this quality that undermines the efforts of those seeking to discuss ‘Les Immateriaux' as a novel treatment of the'exhibition medium'. Lyotard aimed to challenge Shannon and Wiener's communication diagram, in which 'medium' - one possible translation of the French 'support' - is the central term. Following Diderot's allegorical fable, Les Immateriaux' does not perform a 'deconstruction' of an exhibition medium, rather it draws attention to a specific 'medium' condition - that of painting - through the specific 'exhibitionary' form of a heterogeneous 'mise en espace-temps' in which competing discursive genres could be played out. [...]  

[Lyotard and Chaput claimed] that Les Immateriaux'merely presents to the eyes and ears some of the effects [of a new sensibility], as would a work of art'.6 But to grant Les Immateriaux' art-like status, a number of operations of workingthrough, or anamnesis, must first be performed: of the modern in the postmodern; of the pictorial or fictional field in the exhibition space (as Diderot did in his report on the 1767 Salon); and of colour (or voice) in the pictorial/fictional field (as manifested in Les Immatériaux, in particular, through Duchamp, Monory and Buren). These permutations are what destabilize any authorship the anthropocentric “I' may have over a ‘work' - be it of art - and transform the singular subject into a participant in a collective heterologia.7  

We may debate whether ‘Les Immatériaux' successfully dramatized these reversals, whether, that is, Lyotard and Chaput managed, as Lyotard put it, to 'convert anxiety into joyfulness' and ‘displace the tragic nature of writing into humour'8 Yet what is undeniable is that, true to Freud's definition of anamnesis as a first step in the analytic treatment, the working through of Les Immateriaux' has only just begun - not in search of any definitive origin or answer, but as a potentially endless chain of phrases in which Lyotard's commitment to an ‘initial forgetting' at the Centre Pompidou in 1985 still pressures us to take part.9

# Jorinde Seijdel The Exhibition as Emulator//1999  

[TJoday's integrated circuits - several million transitions on pure silicon surfaces the size of a thumb - mock any exhibition.   
-Friedrich Kittlerl [...]  

Jean-Francois Lyotard's point of departure [in the creation of ‘Les Immateriaux'] was that technological and scientific development was causing radical change in the relationship between human beings and their perception of reality. The perspectivist vision of reality that had largely determined our ideas of what formed a “faithful' representation of reality from the Quattrocento to modern times, was being replaced by a new view which held that the human beings no longer controlled nature/material, but rather, along with all other things, were immaterializing into messages, that is information, according to Lyotard.  

By making this postmodern condition visible, Lyotard wanted to create a 'reflexive unease' in the viewer regarding the implications of the information age. He created a network of technological, artistic and scientific experiments, all of which fit into an overarching language-theoretical formula, consisting of sender > receiver > bearer of message > code containing message > subject to which message refers. Lyotard did not see Les Immateriaux' as an exhibition in the traditional sense, but as a postmodern time-space filled with flowing information and invisible interfaces in which the borders between various areas fade and old‘unities'dissolve.  

[]t is not a question of presenting an exhibition (exposition), but rather an overexposition.2  

Now, the information society has already changed from philosophical concept into daily reality. And many of the state-of-the-art technologies that Lyotard used to intensify the experience of the electronic age have probably already entered history, as archaic prototypes or quaint gadgets. But Les Immatériaux' was one of the first large-scale attempts to chart the information society and explore the new experience it was creating. It was also a serious reflection on the significance of the exhibition as a medium and an interface. But to what extent could Lyotard comprehend the implications and paradoxes of his solidly constructed project?  

The main criticism of Les Immateriaux' at the time was that its philosophical framework and semiotic formula were so dominant that the openness of the original question was lost, causing the exhibition ultimately to acquire exactly the same kind of artificial unity and coherence as the traditional exhibition. It was precisely the idea of the exhibition as part of a Grand Story [grand recit] master narrative} that Lyotard opposed, as he himself had declared the bankruptcy of such Grand Stories. The unwanted and unexpected effect of his project was that he demonstrated a new Grand Story, that of the Ultimate Information Society, or InfoArcadia, as Jouke Kleerebezem called it.3  

Lyotard thus carried out a premature rescue, but also revealed that the exhibition, including its new postmodern form, continues ultimately in its aim to be an Arcadia, a coherent whole with a claim to completeness and representiveness. But would we still be fooled?  

Is the exhibition in the information age an interface (meaning ‘area of contact' or 'connection'), or a program (not in the sense of ‘overview', but rather of 'software')? Probably both. In his overexposition, Lyotard was the designer of an interface that aimed to allow the spectator to 'run a program': he was thus alsoaprogrammer.  

Today, exhibitions (as a reflection of a desire to connect directly with reality) are less interface and more program, or, in the words of Bolter and Grusin: less 'hypermedium' and more ‘transparent medium'4 The opposite is also being simultaneously attempted by emphasizing the reality of the exhibition with the aid of a kind of ‘immersive environment': a space in which the viewers are completelyabsorbed.  

Lyotard's ‘Les Immatériaux' showed something else that we now recognize because of the computer, namely, that the exhibition can also be seen as an analogue 'emulator'. In the digital sense, an emulator is a program with which a computer can imitate operating systems other than its own. MAME (Multiple Arcade Machine Emulator) is an emulator that uses a new program to translate old computer games, so game fans can again gain access to a lost Arcadia with classicgamesoftheiryouth.  

The exhibition-as-emulator can be imagined as a kind of salvage program for all kinds of worlds, belief systems and realities that it retranslates into universal codes and interfaces. Simultaneously keeping old and new programs available means not only that all the desires of a fragmented and individualized society can be satisfied, but also that the display and amusement culture of Info Arcadia can stay in business eternally with hyperefficiency: everything can reappear (or appear in advance) to be replayed again and again, but without the heavyhandedness of the museum, in which the world retains only display value and allows no direct interrelations, let alone pleasure.  

As a thought-experimental metaphor, the exhibition-as-emulator is not an attempt to save the exhibition, but rather to understand and situate it in the here and now according to its own inherent logic. Emulation would seem to be the answer to the oft-repeated paradox that the computer as a medium can archive all other media except itself. In his essay 'Trancemedia: from Simulation to Emulation', Arjen Mulder suggests that emulation is the only means at the computer's disposal to secure and access its own history. Emulation of all earlier hardware plus software is the only way in which computer history can written using a computer. Why would we not also see the exhibition as a model, an analogue machine' that can include every model except itself? And is it not tempting to extend the analogy even further, by claiming that the exhibition-asemulator is the only idea that can allow a retrospective of the exhibition?  

The exhibition seen as emulator thus allows us to 'play' old exhibitions, displays or shows. But they are encoded according to a new program and conditioned by a current system, so they generate a new pleasure and a genuinely contemporaryexperience.  

Emancipated from the pressure of old value systems, you can navigate with lightning speed through the Louvre, as a hypertextual network: you zap your way through stately museum rooms, browse' an exhibition with ethnographic objects and scan in nervous relaxation through spaces with the most tempting, 'clickable' points.  

But the opposite can also occur (emulation is a much happier thing than simulation): confronted with the spectacle of the present state of InfoArcadia, you can furtively allow the old rules and speeds to prevail anew, and be touched by information and the media in the same way as in an old-fashioned exhibition: regarding a computer game as Art, the computer monitor as a movie screen ...  

This has again become possible, without being old-fashioned; like a wishdream machine, the exhibition-as-emulator keeps all conditioning and models public. The only thing you have to comprehend is that you're emulating. I...]  

In this sense, emulations and emulating media are in between life and death: they are alternating re-animations, animations or 'pre-animations'. In InfoArcadia, all things are possible, as long as you have the right programs. But the fun will only really start when the interfaces start playing the wrong programs, or when the programs begin to hide behind the wrong interfaces.

Contemporary Art as Immateriaux', Yesterday and   
Today//2015  

In 1985 as today, the historical and critical interest of Les Immateriaux' lies, in my opinion, in the way it opposed the trend towards the triumph of traditional values that marked the 1980s. This was a decade in which, in both the political and cultural arenas, the Western world witnessed the gradual advance and dominance of conservative positions, with the great success of a return to the various forms of painting: Transavanguardia, Neue Wilde, New Expressionism, and so on. 'Les Immateriaux' should be understood as a kind of 'Manifesto of Technophilic Postmodernism', of which Jean-Francois Lyotard was an interpreter.  

While Lyotard left his stamp on ‘Les Immatériaux' especially through the work he did on the exhibition as a medium - the organization and display, the soundtrack, the catalogue, etc., are the very areas in which one can sense the hand of the philosopher' - for the selection of the works, Lyotard often relied on specialists (such as Alain Sayag for the photography, or Bernard Blistene for fine arts). Indeed, after studying the documents in the archives of the Centre  

Pompidou, one can understand that the collaboration with the National Museum of Modern Art (the art department of the Centre Pompidou, MNAM) wasn't easy. For example, Lyotard did little to secure loans from other museums, an exception being the Egyptian bas-relief of the Grenoble Museum - a strange choice, if truth be known. Despite this, the choice of artworks exhibited in 'Les Immatériaux' is very stimulating, and gives rise to many lines of thought, even though the works represent only a part of the materials, documents, artefacts, instruments and images that filled the sixty sites on the fifth floor of the Centre Pompidou. [...]  

Looking at our present time, certain themes beloved by Lyotard are still topical.For example,the game of identity has become one of the most widespread pastimes among Web users: social networks,blogs, chatrooms and dating portals have fuelled the fashion of self-presentation and representation, backed by the great pressure of television. Anne Helmond has explored the link between search engines, social networks and identity constructions, showing how software and works associated with these Web tools - as ‘Identity 2.0' - are a variant of a performative notion of identity, once again eiaborated within postmodernism. Such forms of self-representation are more dynamic than static personal web pages, because they make possible the storage of documents related to the flow of personal and professional life. But the fact that they are often produced with an APl (Application Programming Interface) causes a substantial seriality of personal profiles, documented in the various social networks. The relationship between self-determination and over-determination of identity is variable, but forms and contents automatically selected by software seem to prevail.2  

Among female artists such as Orlan, Cindy Sherman, Adrian Piper and others, Lynn Hershman, a pioneer of new-media art who has explored gender stereotypes in her famous alter ego Roberta Breitmore (1974-78) - a work with a strong photographic element - alludes precisely to mixture, where the percentage of stereotype prevails over personal identity. I am referring to DiNA (2004), an artificially intelligent agent, linked to the Internet and equipped with a custom software, video and microphone, which makes her able to interact directly with the museum visitor. DiNA is engaged in an ongoing campaign, via her website, for virtual elections to the office of TV-president; she converses with voters and collects votes on topics pertinent to global survival. DiNA is unique because she is able to process these responses in real time, and to mix virtual events which have occurred during her campaign with current events as they are unfolding throughout the world. Lynn Hershman writes about this work: I've always been attracted to digital tools and cinematic metaphors that reflect our times, such as privacy in an era of surveillance, personal identity in a time of pervasive manipulations.' I..]  

# Ways of Interaction in Art  

Returning to the selection of the works of new-media art, it seems to me that this is the terrain on which Lyotard had the strongest confrontations with the other lecturers from the University of Paris Vlll. Jean-Louis Boissier remembered his extensive collaboration on 'Les Immateriaux': Boissier's work Le Bus is one of the iconic works of the exhibition, particularly because of the exploration of urban space that it proposes, which in some ways recalls the Situationist practice of urban drifting.4 The latter, in turn, is a ftting model for the visit to “Les Immatériaux': that is, to stroll, with no points of orientation, being able to keep crossing the same sites, and observe objects of a different nature, such as those that the Situationists observed in the shop windows and in the streets of Paris.  

Disorientation is perhaps the most ubiquitous element in ‘Les Immateriaux', and the image which best illustrates the 'confusion' experienced during a visit to the exhibition was, perhaps, the catalogue, which was made up of a hundred loose sheets (not bound in a book) - much as the individual sites were not included in a pre-planned, sequential or narrative-driven route of the exhibition. The architect Philippe Délis has underlined how the spatial conception of the exhibition - which at the time was novel - has become familiar to us during the last twenty years, mainly thanks to the experience of surfing the net.5  

But returning to the interactive art of Les Immateriaux', as well as Le Bus, there isSon $_{!=}$ Espace, created ad hoc by Rolf Gehlhaar. Technically advanced,the work was indebted to research in visual kinetics. Son=Espace comprised a space which viewers walked through, with sensors that picked up the movements of the audience and turned them into sounds by means of an elaborate computerized system devised by the artist. This project was born from the idea of creating a piece of music that was non-deterministic, and in fact Gehlhaar had been working since 1983 on developing an adequate software program, work which also gave rise to the title of the work. The movements of the user were detected by a sensor system using ultrasonic devices, which sent them to the software. The software produced different sounds, depending on the areas in which the public was located, on the speed and direction of the movement, and so on. The work consisted of the software developed by the artist which, among other things, he has continued to work on since, creating different variations of the prototype exhibited at the Centre Pompidou6 thanks to the committee of La Villette, the museum of science and technique that opened in 1986, and for which 'Les Immatériaux' was, from the point of view of institutional policy, a sort of dress rehearsal.  

But what are Lyotard's ideas about these works of art? Can one consider 'interactivity' as being equivalent, in the arts, to the theme of 'the crisis of the subject' in philosophy? [...]  

It is difficult to say whether the philosopher of postmodernism would have appreciated a new kind of artwork, made with data flows on the Web - one of the newest forms of interaction. Carlo Zanni, an Italian artist who lives in Milan and New York, combines technical research with high-level stylistic solutions, while also integrating suggestions from literary texts and soundtracks.  

From Ebay Landscape (2004) - where the form of a simple Japanese landscape changes constantly following the NASDAQ, the stock market of Ebay, and the CNN home page - to In time (2005) - a skyline where the weather changes every 15 minutes according to the meteorological station at La Guardia Airport, while the choppers and zeppelins follow the updates of CNN website, and the skyline is like a dynamic histogram related with the most frequent queries on the Time Out New York website7 - Zanni explores a sort of interaction without personal intentions.  

The fluid and unstable nature of these works is evidently a metaphor for our increasingly connected world. In the same direction, Zanni works on 'data cinema', which is what he calls a kind of work in which the constant changing of the Web - with which the user interacts via his or her Internet connection - modifies the novel. The Possible Ties between llness and Success (2006) is a reflection upon the relationship between talent, success and manic-depressive illness. We observe the protagonist of a short film attacked by a progressive disease. The spots that slowly cover his body, like a contagious disease, are generated automatically by software that communicates with Google Analytics, a well-known statistical analysis system for monitoring the traffic on websites: 'The patches extend as much as the virtual visitors increase, and distribute on the actor's body in different places, depending on the geographical origin of the visitors. The film is constantly changing, due to the interaction of the unaware spectators.'s  

Another work by Zanni embodies early analysis of digital photography, as proposed by Edmond Couchot more than fifteen years before.? The Fifth Day (2009) is a sequence of pictures showing a taxi ride. The photos were taken in Alexandria, Egypt. They change during the exhibition, because linked to the Web, being thereby sensitive to the dataflow from Egypt, describing the evolution of statistics of some aspects of its cultural and political life. The data, retrieved from the Internet and transforming the aesthetics of the photos, relate to such matters as the proportion of seats held by women in the national parliament (which changes the position of the pedestrian crossing the road in one photo), or the perception of corruption (which changes the image in the rear-view mirror of the taxi in another photo),'o to name just two.  

So, in the end, in my opinion, works of art based on the Internet are the clearest examples of how Les Immatériaux' was on the right track, in the middle of the1980s.  

Continuing our stroll through Les Immateriaux', looking for works of newmedia art, we encounter a work that is almost 'rudimentary' for its time, even when compared to Le Bus or Son=Espace, for example. I am talking about Temps differe (1985) by Catherine Ikam, a closed-circuit video installation identifiable with the site of the same name.  

Originally linked to minimalist research on perception and its space-time dimension (an example being Bruce Nauman's work), and subsequently focusing on the social implications of video surveillance (different examples we can cite are the experiences of Fred Forest and Dan Graham), closed-circuit video installations are located in an intermediate position between video art and interactive environments.  

The artwork of Ikam focuses in particular on the distorting effect that mirrors have on closed-circuit television. Temps differe consists of two rooms, which are identical, empty and interconnected, equipped with a video surveillance system: a minimalist purity whose result is rather mundane. In the first room, the visitor sees on the monitor the place where he is standing, devoid of his own presence; in the second environment, however, the TV displays an image of the preceding space, recorded immediately before. In this way, the experience of the place and its image on the monitor do not match, as occurs in the classical Corridors of Bruce Nauman. The goal in both cases is to undermine the fidelity, realism and documentary ability of the video, and to simultaneously induce in the viewer a kind of cognitive vertigo, caused by the inconsistencies.1  

I have long questioned why Lyotard chose such an outdated work, even if it was specially made for 'Les lmmateriaux'. Beyond any other considerations, I believe that the philosopher meant the selected artworks to serve as emblems, symbols of certain tendencies in contemporary society, and that he therefore sometimes glossed over the artistic value of some of the works. Les Immateriaux' is a classic example of an educational exhibition - a theoretical exhibition if you like - rather than an object-oriented show. And this is also the reason why some works were displayed both at the 1983 exhibition ‘Electra: Electricity and Electronics in the Twentieth Century',2 and at Les Immatériaux', because they have a very different meaning and purpose in the two exhibitions.  

In the case of Temps differé, it is probably the idea of using feedback, which is at the core of the artwork, that Lyotard found interesting: it is a concept that was borrowed from biology and psychology, and that has been applied to both social communication and the arts. Starting from the various forms of interactivity, passing through some examples of institutional critique, conceptual art and relational art, the attention given to 'feedback' is a typical aspect of late modern culture, and one of those concepts that mark the horizon of artistic research in the last thirty to forty years, even if it changes its appearance.

# Tom Sherman Primary Devices//1988  

[Wjhy do artists choose to work in today's predominant communications technologies?  

The predominant communications technologies of our time are video, computers  and  telecommunications  networks.  These  key  interrelated communications technologies supply speed-of-light power to a much more visible media environment comprised of print, photography and cinema. These media of greater visibility have attained their considerable profile in part because they have given birth to vast histories of artistic accomplishment. Print, photography and cinema are the 'smokestack' media of the cultural industries. By comparison, video, computers and telecommunications networks are, from an arts perspective, relatively uncharted territories. That is, while there is a recent art history for each, an arts perspective of these communications technologies is still an unestablished, minority point of view.  

Being on the margin fails to discourage some artists. This kind of defiant attitude has been exhibited by significant artists throughout Western art history. Today many of these artists are more interested in managing information than they are in formulating unique forms of individual expression. Problems inherent in the management of information, working with and against the hierarchies which dominate information and communications technologies are difficult problems which intrigue and challenge many contemporary artists. Video, computers and telecommunications networks are the technological infrastructure of the late twentieth-century information economy. It is not surprising that many artists choose to work directly with these predominant communications technologies.  

The primary devices of these communications artists differ from those working with traditional fine art media, just as widespread attitudes and values associated with the use of communications technologies differ substantially from traditional art concerns. An intellectually acceptable methodology for using communicationstechnologies doesnotincludea behaviourallexicon of theatrical gestures or anti-communications techniques. Methodologies of information gathering, processing and diffusion are unlikely to be conceived for the purpose of defining or establishing one's creativeidentity. Communications art strategles are usually devised for their utility and effectiveness. Other, more convoluted, traditional approaches to the art-making process will tend to render the artist ineffective or incompetent. The primary devices used by communications artists are specific pieces of equipment designed to perform assigned functions or serve particular purposes - such as video, tape recorders and personal computers.  

In many cases these primary devices are format-technologies, technological devices taken off-the-shelf and used without modification. The artist forms a relationship with a particular class of machine for the purpose of confronting the problems and opportunities these machines were designed to address. Teams of engineers, working in most cases without knowledge or concern for artists or the art-making process, design these primary devices, assigning functions with consumer or industrial applications in mind. Market realities determine the performance specifications and degree of utility of these devices. A specific piece of equipment therefore constitutes a particular work environment or site. Factors of compatibility, or more significantly incompatibility, with other machines go a long way towards defining the context or place within which one must act.  

While the actual working context or environment may be extremely limited in reality, many artists using contemporary communications technologies see an unlimited future potential of their chosen media. In other words, extremely rigid machine environments are accepted, because, in theory, existing restrictions will fall as these technologies advance on their own momentum. Artists working with today's powerful but challenging technologies believe they are at the frontier. In the face of unavoidable, unnerving change, these artists want the same things they have always wanted, and more: to work directly, without restriction,with images and sounds.  

They do not relish art-making which is distanced by cumbersome levels of technique. Artists want to control motion precisely. They long to harness computers and robotic technologies for cultural and artistic purposes. Everyone would probably agree that screens of all sizes must go. Virtual environments of unprecedented complexity must be designed to exist without the constrictive influence of frame and aspect ratio.  

Communications technologies may be restrictive today, but one only has to look contemplatively at the actual pace of development to become intoxicated with the potential of these integrated technological devices.  

If television, which can be seen to be the history of video, breaks up, the way radio has, into a spectrum of mobile, wireless personal telecommunications technologies, what will the temporal and spatial implications of fully interactive video be if it is transmitted at the speed of light on a global scale? A question like this will stimulate some artists more than others, because some will believe they can play an active role in the process of technological change. There are individuals in all sectors of society who feel they must take part.in psychological and societal change brought about by advancing technologies. Certain educators, scientists, economists, bureaucrats and politicians all find  themselves advocating technological change from their particular perspectives. Informed artists are likely to communicate with professionals in other sectors sharing similar goals. Thus we witness the development of cross-disciplinary, collaborative work which transcends strict professional jurisdictions in efforts to reach common goals.  

It may be difficult to form productive, working relationships across disciplinary lines, but artists inclined to work in non-traditional media face limited opportunities in their own professional sector. The arts community in any nation with an advanced technological infrastructure seems to find comfort in the fact that the arts are a physical and spiritual link with the past. in the visual arts, painting and sculpture continue to reign as the mature forms of apparently everlasting value. The endless examination and manipulation of these mature, material-based forms seem to continue to satisfy most artists, patrons, curators, critics, dealers, publishers, bureaucrats and psychologists.  

Related visual media like film and video are marginally accepted as iegitimate artforms but make things complicated from both an aesthetic and economic perspective. For one thing, flm and video invite viewers to think about sound and music and performance. To complicate things further, the visual arts community has also generously accepted photography, the written text, audio, performance and installation. In some circles even holography is an acceptable medium for artistic purposes.  

The choice an artist often must make is whether to work in well-developed or completely undeveloped territory. If one wants to make a painting, the problems have been addressed over and over by countless numbers of very capable individuals. On the other hand, if one wants to work in video, computers or telecommunications networks, relatively few have looked at the territory from an art-making perspective.  

When looking at well-worn work environments or places where few artists have dared to go before, is it really possible to use the same criteria to evaluate the way art-making problems are solved in such extremely different domains?  

As well as an underdeveloped critical environment, communications artists have the additional problem of working in the professional territory of another group, namely engineers and scientists. From a traditional arts perspective, the painting problem is a challenging, ongoing proposition of merit. From a science and engineering perspective; the act of painting is fascinating as an abstract exercise. The viewpoint of the engineer is considered here because the artist must wear the other professional's hat whenever he or she enters the communications environment in an art-making mode.  

From an arts perspective, the terrain of video, computers and telecommunications networks presents an unstructured work environment, with no clearly established range of techniques and relatively little art history.  

There are neither behavioural expectations nor performance standards. From an audience perspective, there is scant knowledge of the terrain, and curators and critics rarely exhibit the willpower necessary to gain an informed, privileged point of view. To make matters worse, from a science and engineering point of view, video, computers and telecommunications networks offer a work environment suitable for just about everything but the art-making process. Many hard-science professionals think only of Escher and Bach when they do think of art and culture.  

There are scientists and engineers who think of themselves as artists in the mould of Leonardo da Vinci or as intellectual humanists quite well equipped to view art. But the reality of the situation has been rendered in black and white to the point of hopelessness.A greyscale of ideas ofany complexity would necessarily involve the multiple perspectives of an interdisciplinary group or recorded conversations between individuals transcending professional overspecialization and seemingly  inescapable segregation and  isolation. The fundamental problem is that there is no business (\$) to speak of in the interdisciplinary zones where artists currently exchange information with professionals from other disciplines. Money talks, and video, computers and telecommunications networks simply do not serve the interests of interdisciplinary groups as well as they serve multinational corporations.  

To go back to a comparison of traditional art practice and activity designed for the new technologies, it is apparent that there are substantial differences between the two options. Artists who choose to work with traditional media completely control the production of their art with their own hands. Artists who opt for manipulation of information must rely on others to control the processes of enormously complex systems. Work which involves the artist with communications systems means the artist must work collaboratively. When this collaborative work demands formal relationships with people in other cultures, then things may become extremely interesting - often to the point of chaos. Successful collaboration, and even more importantly, productive cooperation, then become the measures of professionalism in the communications art feld.  

Unfortunately, cooperative work habits cannot be sustained by goodwill alone. Mutual benefits must also result; for example, the acquisition of previously unattainable information. Maybe this new information will actually lead to business (\$) opportunities. At this time there isn't much business (\$) for the unaffiliated individual in and around these complex global systems. It is likely to happen soon, but for now personal satisfaction is all that is available - the terrific feeling one has after collaborating and cooperating transculturally. Many of these emotional benefits arrive via the keyboards and other devices of interactivity. Interacting directly in cooperative professional communication is a remarkable experience even when it is not perceived to be part of the art-making process.  

The main objective of all interactive works is to reduce the response time for everyone concerned. The artist wants to know what the audience thinks and will in some cases share authorship of the work with others to find out. The spontaneity of natural conversation is sought. Improvisation, a desirable ingredient in all creative communication processes, is fundamental to the evolution of a dynamic aesthetic of communications art.  

A structural approach to communications art may involve the artist in the creation of serial analogies. Analogous models of particularly interesting aspects or applications of systems are constructed for the purpose of introducing these modes into larger, more comprehensive systems. A series of analogous systems are constructed in an attempt to shift meaning in a system to suit personal objectives. Thus the basic nature of the larger systems are redefined, step by step, over time.  

Artists form relationships with systems with the goal of becoming the managing agents of the systems employed. An artist, when confronting the reality of a general system which is underdeveloped as an art-making environment, will naturally seek out and interact with the system's likeminded agents, who may or may not work within large organizations. These like-minded agents wili be other artists or professionals from other disciplines inclined to exchange information with artists.  

In this way artists manage to control an aspect or application of a system, rather than finding themselves powerless, non-productive and completely alienated, like a majority of members of their society.  

Another matter that should be considered is the inherent value of membership. The artist enters an association with a particular community which is using the same system, or at least the same routing and addresses in a system. The 'nerdy view of this is that membership translates into being a 'node' in the system. For instance, the artist might want to be an active partner in a group hoping to influence national and international societal trends (eg. an environmental group). In such cases the national and international societies are managed by a critical mass of optimistic people who want to see an aspect of a system, or a whole system, work. For this to happen, the behaviour of the group has to be studied so that information may be extracted and transferred in an unobtrusive, controlled manner. The system managers must refrain from asking too much of potential collaborators while still finding the way to prime the pump.  

Whenever anyone manipulates  information or an audience which  is interested in consuming and contributing information there is bound to be a political reaction. The management of interactivity depends on a practical understanding of how members of a participating audience are going to react. If an interactive system is controlled intelligently through the process of anticipating the behaviour of the participants, then the system may not differ much from vertical information hierarchies like television and other classical mass media. Vertical hierarchies are topdown, one-way information diffusion systems which do not feature equal status between the artist, the system designer and programmer, and the audience - the potentially responsive participants.  

Hierarchical relationships do not have to be vertical in nature - they can of course be horizontal. Many artists working with communications technologies are obsessed with the idea of eliminating vertical hierarchies in favour of formal relationships which feature lateral, equivalent levels of information exchange. To this end, communications artists are constantly trying to build ladders between have-nots and those who possess or appear to possess greater skills and resources. In some cases this quest for a level playing field' becomes petty. Success is often resented and every attempt is made to subvert emerging power in individuals or the organizations they manage. Those who appear to make extraordinary gains are thus criticized for unfair practices or disappointing performance, given the advantage they seem to hold. Rumour and innuendo are the conventional weapons of such destructive, negative leveling tactics.  

More optimistically, not everyone equates higher levels of technology and vertical hierarchies exclusively with military research, behaviourist domination of the media-illiterate, corporate profit acceleration or California-born special effects movies. Not everyone insists that low-tech is the only way to be politically correct. What is the value of maintaining pathetically low levels of image and sound fidelity in the interest of assuring one's competitive position on the bottom? What is so attractive about dressing in the commonplace images and soundsofgutter-end technology?  

Thankfully, the microchip revolution has transferred tremendous power to the bottom-end. The basic Macintosh computer resting on today's junkpile due to factors of obsolescence is still a machine of incredible power and utility. Such a piece of equipment is simply the price of admission to a universe of opportunities and problems. Personal economic realities aside, the artist who is interested in managing information must have the psychological and social freedom to work with whatever level of technology he or she needs or wants.  

The artist must be concerned about the accessibility of specific machines, the primary devices of his or her profession. The artist must also be able to cope with the politics which come with the territory of these communications technologies. The politics in the traditional art milieu are fairly straight forward and easy to understand. Reactions to art based on these new technologies will range from indifference to paranoia, which may result in active attempts to oppress such machine-focused activity. But within the communications art community itself, the artist may face ruthless competition as everyone struggles for resources and security in this undeveloped, hostile environment. The corporate sector which controls the evolution of the primary technological devices and the actual channels of communication will likely remain unimpressed with real innovation and creativity until it can be demonstrated that there is business (\$) in the affairs of communications artists.  

As it stands, many people give lip-service to the importance of interdisciplinary activity. Actual financial support comes exclusively from informed individuals at agencies within governments of no more than a handful of nation states. Universities, like all bureaucracies, know the theoretical value of interdisciplinary exchange, but face insurmountable resistance from tenured staff content to stay over-specialized. With respect to the private sector, the artist may find access to sophisticated technologies in exchange for services in kind. In light of this grim synopsis, why do artists choose to work in today's predominant communications technologies? First, they are simply not interested in the traditional problems associated with art-making. They seek relationships with technological systems which are not conventionally perceived as media environments conducive to creative activity. There are freedoms associated with the absence of firm behavioural expectations or standards of performance. There are few rules to break.  

Second, the individual who chooses to work in communication technology must be able to transcend reality in an attempt to anticipate the potential problems and opportunities presented by rapidly advancing technologies. This second demand separates those who can actually participate actively in the development of a technologically-based culture from those who will have to contribute in other ways. Technology moves ahead progressively. It is driven by business(\$).It waits for no one.  

If artists wish to determine its course they must project themselves into a future they can manage on their own.  

If some artists are really interested in managing information, rather than formulating unique forms of individual expression, then they must have the tools, the skills and they must begin to think of their work as business (\$). If their business is the exchange of information with professionals from other disciplines, then they mustconvince theireers,atrons,curators,critics,dealers,ublishers,bureaucra and psychologists that their particular form of art/business has value. While this will be difficult, it is not impossible. Time is on their side because of the growing, in some cases technologically generated need for interdisciplinary groups.  

The exchange of information in interdisciplinary zones must be well documented, and all such activity should be thought of as information transactions. All such transactions should be compiled in detail and then released when appropriate to open-minded people in other interdisciplinary zones. If artists construct rather than edit these information packages, a common management problem will soon arise. The volume of information formed by the documented history of transactions will demand adequate storage and indexing strategies for information retrieval and manipulation. Sooner or later, someone is going to need this information, and at that point the information provider, the communications artist, is going to be in business (\$).

# Peter Schjeldahl Jenny Holzer at the Guggenheim//1990  

Jenny Holzer's LED word-crawl up the Guggenheim's atrium corkscrew is an amazing sight that makes for an amazing scene. Though it opened December 12, I didn't visit it until Christmas week when New York museums are mobbed with college kids and tourists, and I'm glad. This is one show you want to see in a crowd - the more the better - because the flashing tapeworm's behavioural effect on people is so delicious: hundreds of citizens standing around in stoppedin-their-tracks attitude - inwardly focused, slack-jawed vulnerable-looking. adorable - as they perform the unnatural act of reading in public.  

They read in the snaking display some punk-poetical greatest hit of Holzer, litanies of artfully formed verbal sludge: phrases like 'SAVOUR KINDNESS BECAUSE CRUELTY IS ALWAYS POSSIBLE LATER', that are frontloaded with spondaic stresses, hence effortful to read, and obscurely freighted with menace. Standing and reading these blazing, lugubrious urgencies in Frank Lloyd Wright's bobbin is like becoming a minuscule fantastic voyager inside the head of somebody probably insane.  

This is one of the best public art pieces I've ever witnessed, because the public is at least half the show in an environment - the practically art-proof Guggenheim, no less - that is efficiently and drastically transformed. Young museum-goers sprawl in the ramp's empty, darkened bays, and people who aren't reading look at those who are or at one another, as dazed and weirdly exhilarated as folks during a minor natural disaster. There is a mildly anarchic, aimless air, a kind of exciting staleness like the last day of the close-out sale in a store that is going to be torn down. It somewhat reminded me of the 1960s, when Western Civilization felt that way.  

All the while, the words glide by - in various fonts of the LED's red and green lightbeads, which can combine to make a sickish yellow - with spookily silent celerity, changing course at angles of the balustrade's convex bulges like riverrapids water spraying off rocks. At a brisk trot (not advised), you might physically keep pace with the upward scoot of, say, 'PROTECT ME FROM WHAT I WANT. Walking downramp and looking across, you may briefly fancy that you are, in fact, tracking the word-crawl and even, in some manner, causing it to move - an illusion of being locked into the twinkling display that made my brain hurt.  

Holzer is of the generation of artists who in the late 1970s produced work defiantly heralded as 'Bad Painting' (later subsumed to neoexpressionism), and I think of her stuff as Bad Writing: a use of language aggressively ugly, expressionistically distorted, and in your face. The word choice is often so 'off' as to approach gibberish, but the syntax is so threatening that you automatically read very carefully, seeking cues for fight or flight. Such is especially the case of her things from the early 1980s, of which her masterpiece is the monologue of pure malice that ends, 'DO YOU WANT TO FALL NOT EVER KNOWING WHO TOOK YOU?' To be in a public place drenched in such guttural palaver is to feel normal social facades crack, with a paradoxical effect of calm stillness (because everybody'sreading).  

THE MOUTH IS INTERESTING BECAUSE IT'S ONE OF THOSE PLACES WHERE THE DRY OUTSIDE MOVES TOWARD THE SLIPPERY INSIDE: Why would anyone want to say something like that? Anyone wouldn't, I think, and that may be the essence of Holzer's harsh, toneless, true (but somehow pointlessly true) statements, which seem to issue, with jarring emotional punch, from a disembodied consciousness belonging to everyone and no one. Isn't the sense of such a consciousness, at once in insinuating and alienating, the definitive effect of public spaces in our time, of plazas, malls, airports and lobbies (and museums, which may be defined as buildings that are all lobby)? Holzer is onto the nerve of our world - with sandpaper and a hammer.  

The psychopathology of everyday life that Holzer explores is a trackless, amorphous realm, in which she fairly often gets lost. Her attempts to be sculptural with aphorism-engraved marble benches and pseudo-sepulchres - which I can't help thinking of as chatty garden furniture for rich collectors - are inauspicious. And much of her LED work has been overdependent on the tricky appeal of that medium, provoking negative comparisons to the laconic control that Bruce Nauman, for instance, brings to his uses of neon. Worse yet, Holzer's present installation at Dia hints at a loss of edge in her writing.  

The Dia piece is stirringly theatrical, with vertical LEDs seeming to fire words up through the floor and down through the ceiling, but the messages thus displayed (and repeated on marble in an adjoining chamber) tend to be laboriously selfconscious. 'WHEN MY MIND IS RIGHT I CAN SAY WHAT NO ONE WANTS TO HEAR' is like the nervous brag of an author on the talk-show circuit, and A CLEAR THOUGHT MUST COME TO STOP THE MEN AND MAKE THE AUDIENCE LAUGH UNTIL THEIR INSIDES BUBBLE' invites the rejoinder, 'No it mustn't.' Lots of Holzer's new hortatory nuggets are likewise arguable and even a mite pleading, lacking her old savagery. Does becoming an art star make it hard to stay pissed off?  

But, oh boy, is she ever a showperson! The brilliantly simple Guggenheim installation, besides being my own favorite thing by her since her posters of nearly a decade ago (all those visceral one-liners plastered around the city), is the perfect realization of a very significant ambition. By trial and error, Holzer has fashioned an extraordinary cultural role for herself - some combination of dirty-talking stand-up comic and Wizard of Oz - and she plainly grasps the demands of the job, at which she is literally incomparable. As good as she gets, with disappointments allowed for, is as good as contemporary public art gets.

# BasakSenova Congestion in the Data Flow: Erhan Muratoglu, I/O InterfaceOverbloated//2006  

A constant production of information is accumulating. The indexing protocols of information are getting more sophisticated each and every day. However, the channels to distribute information are no longer sufficient. ‘The information' itself is getting more condensed and compressed, shorter and faster. Through various media, our perception codes have been changing; we are trying to adapt to the pace of the information flow. We have been trained to perceive several moving images and multiplied messages at a time. We are actually in a constant process of following the information flow but even the enormous growth of new multimedia mobile and wireless networks is slow for the pace of its flow.  

Among these various media, television is a piece of cult apparatus with a momentum which is equal to the consumption mechanism of our globalized world. The televisual flow is formatted for unconscious addiction, providing toxins of curiosity in 72 dpi tablets. On the overloaded data network, and forward and backward leaps of digital images and text codes, it offers virtual timelessness indexed to real time and the machine. It is a noisy piece of machinery which deciphers capitalism; a frantic mechanism which filters and melts the context and content of everything that it conveys through the 'time' reference which decodes itself.  

By merging with other information technologies, its speed and intensity still continues to be pinned to the screen through prototypical interfaces. The data flow is mounting but the apparatus itself is transmitting data through the same machinery/operation logic by getting 'supposedly' layered with interfaces.  

Television, which is not deliberately designed for conveying plentiful and diverse information at a time, strives to adapt the contemporary digital milieu. Hence, televisual media wearily fails and mutates into something that is neither capable of carrying almost infinite digital data nor graspable in the conventional manner.  

Conventional media resists new methods of gathering and sharing information. Yet it is well aware of the fact that it has to compete with the 'new' media: a new media which challenges the gathering, possessing, distributing and sharing strategies of old media. Controlling mechanisms and powers unintentionally pressurizes television to bear a load which does not fit through the screen. Televisual flow can no longer hold the load and it is apparent. Dividing the timeline in its least possible time-slices does not help cramming in the massive data, as it has already reached beyond the limits of human perception.  

Therefore, we need to reconsider the weird current condition of conventional media which is facing inevitable extinction. Fortunately, the operating system beyond the conventional media and the values created so far will no longer be part of a system which is fed by open source information generation.  

Such a situation is also shaping the agenda of the digital art scene through various kinds of reactions and reflections such as Erhan Muratoglu's video work 1/0 Interface Overbloated (2005). The work itself concentrates on a typical news bulletin on television which is humorously contaminated by digital data. Digital data encapsulates the regular broadcast with an anchorman presented news feed. I/o Interface Overbloated invites the viewer into an electronic zone that surrounds the solid physical world around us. We are living in a transitional period. Conventional media has mutated into something which strives to fit in the massive amount of digital data into its limited analogue space. I/O Interface Overbloated exposes the bottleneck condition in which new digital data try to flow through the television screen. The struggle between the narrated news and visual data feed creates bizarre conditions and undefined zones for the viewer/ data receiver. The conventional TV screen is encapsulated by the new data strugglingtofind away to flow.

# Charu Maithani Error/Glitch/Noise: Observations on Aesthetic Forms ofFailure//2013  

We see the world through different forms of projections - cinema, digital, print and also nature (extending Feuerbach's notion of God being the outward projection of human nature). Characterizing the postmodern shift in space-time, computer programs as digital projections have added virtuality in the spacetime consortium, transforming its perception. The scope of sharing videos, images, information and knowledge digitally has changed our understanding of the medium and outreach, contributing to the culture and ecology of distribution and communication. Simultaneously, the gap between mediated experience and reality is becoming difficult to identify. Mnemonic images from mediated experiences create a better experience, many times leaving us disappointed with actuality. At such an intersection, an error in the medium intervenes with instability, mistake and inaccuracy.  

Making use of the scope of error in the transfer of information or data, a glitch confronts us with new possibilities and dimensions. Rendering a safe system ineffective, the error advocates the simultaneous provocation and expansion of a medium. The error annotates the space-time of an event with a mark that disrupts the (perceived) expected flow, instilling doubt and fear of instability. A closer look at the poetics of error gives an insight into the medium's possibilities and propels the development of knowledge. [. ]

# Flicker Films  

The experimental film sub-genre, flicker films, illuminates the existence of a single frame. Bringing forth the gap between, flicker films simulate error in film projection. By inverting the phenomenon of viewing 24 frames per second, the fluttering films confront the viewer with possibilities of error in film projection. In Peter Kubelka's Arnulf Rainer, rhythmic alternations between blan/ck and white frames are like flashes of memory. Traces of each frame can be found in the next, as the sounds are interrupted with silences. The idea of movement is Created with the next frame, many times giving a stroboscopic effect. Paul Sharits and Tony Conrad are others who use flicker as an aesthetic tool in their films. The black frames and interrupted sound make way for a gap in the audio and visual. The flicker and gap between each frame is the error.  

Taking us back to the basics of cinema, flicker flms challenge the idea of gap, movement and silence, bringing to light thoughts and images that we otherwise won't see. Michael Arnold's films - like Piece touchee and Alone. Life Wastes Andy Hardy - evolve from flicker films. His films analyse other films by slowing them down frame by frame; slowing motion; repeating, reversing and embedding flicker. Stretching time in all of his work, his films confront unobvious and suppressed tensions. The otherwise conceivable error confronts the viewer as a tool to announcethecryptic.  

# Communication  

A Mathematical Theory of Communication by mathematician Claude E. Shannon is an article written in 1948 that lays the foundations of information and communication theory and the field of cybernetics. Also known as the Father of the Digital Age, Shannon's paper was path-breaking. A few observations on Shannon's Communication Model:

It is mathematically impossible to get an error-free communication.   
2 The medium is just a tool to get the message across.   
3 The capacity of a channel to transmit information is called the Shannon limit. Theoretically, it is possible to transmit information below the Shannon limit with zero error, if a channel's capacity to transmit information is greater than   
4 Data compression through source coding is based on the objective of removing redundancy and repetition in a message.   
5 The signal received can be understood only if the decoding tool or software understands the encoding. The diagram depicts the relationship between information, power and noise in cybernetics. Information is directed towards a desired output. By inducing noise, the flow of information can change the output.  

In Postdigital Aesthetics, Lev Manovich talks about a model for cultural communication; he highlights the importance of the medium (channel), adding the component of the author's and reader's respective software2 in the post-digital communication model. The communication model can now be considered as  

Sender - Software - Message - Software - Message - Receiver  

# Hamartia  

Aristotle, in the Poetics, talks about hamartia, meaning flaw, mistake, error, failure or, as the New Testament has it, sin. In literature, it denotes the hero's tragic flaw, a misjudgement. T.c.W. Stinton discusses the interpretation of hamartia as a moral flaw in 'Hamartia in Aristotle and Greek Tragedy' (1975). Stinton groups the meanings of hamartia into three: to miss the mark (literally); to fail in some object or make a mistake; and to offend morally or do wrong.3 An inherent flaw or misjudgement is manipulated to get the figure of a 'tragic hero'. Hamlet's indecisiveness and Othello's jealousy led to their downfall. While philosophers and literarians can debate over the ethical, moral and intellectual meanings of the word, it certainly represents error. An error in or by a person so grave that it leaves them exposed to the most tragic ends of our times.

# Biohacking  

In The Hackers' Code of Ethics, Steven Levy talks about computer access, freedom of information and decentralization of authority.5 By manipulating faults and changing the use and function of obsolete technology, hackers are able to use the system for their purposes. Building upon existing systems and ideas, hackers expand the capability and understanding of technology.  

A new form of hacking gaining interest is biohacking. In an interview with Steven Levy in Wired, Bill Gates says that if he were a teenager today, he'd be hacking biology. Biohacking uses biology to change gene sequencing, effect body augmentation through machines and adjust biological processes in the body through chemical methods. Mainly working away from institutions and organizations, most biopunks are DIY scientists, sometimes using their own body to hack. Dave Asprey has upgraded his body to be more efficient through chemicals and surgery on himself. Implanting machines in her body, Lepht Anonym is a biohacker of another kind. She uses instruments from the kitchen to implant different kinds of technology in her body for the purpose of sensory extension. In a video on YouTube,7 Lepht talks about her main reason for it - curiosity.  

Based on hacking ethics, biohacking is encouraged, shared and passed on to people who are willing to try it. Many times, it is difficult to pin point whether biohackers exploit the faults or manipulate the properties of the biological system to achieve their goals. Many times, it's both.  

# Concluding Thoughts  

Error or glitch is a break providing a space on which various expressions can be projected. As seen above in various forms of error [and] glitch, failure confronts the medium with its limitations. It destructures the systems of power and control behind the medium by exposing its gaps and faults.  

Any system inherently contains a chance of error. That chance is generated into an evolutionary quality that needs to be grasped. Glitch Studies Manifesto by Rosa Menkman talks about how the constant search for complete transparency brings newer, better media. Every one of these new and improved technologies will always have their own fingerprints of imperfection.8  

Using error and glitch as generative tools in visual and sonic art practice is increasingly becoming part of the art-making process. Many websites and projects are exploring glitch aesthetics. Rosa Menkman's website (http://rosamenkman.blogspot.in/), Joan Heemskerk and Dirk Paesmans' (Jodi)'s website and works (http: //www.jodi.org/), Dimitre Lima and Iman Moradi's now defunct Glitch browser (http: //dmtr.org/glitchbrowser/), are just a few examples. One can even create one's own set of glitchy images at the imageGlitcher (http://www. airtightinteractive.com/demos/js/imageglitcher/). Glitch aesthetics lends itself to a wide variety of manipulation and use. Iman Moradi in his 2o04 dissertation on glitch art compares pure glitch and glitch alike, delving further into glitch creation. Similar differentiations between unexpected and designed glitch were also explored in Menkman's essay 'The Glitch Momentum', where she borrows Marshall McLuhan's concept and introduces hot and cool glitch. An error that happens unexpectedly is a cool or pure glitch, unlike an error that has been induced through design and control, called hot glitch or glitch alike. Many consider the latter as just a filter or preset that has become a new commodity made popular as an 'effect'.9 It is no surprise that in visual effects history, a lot of effects were initially errors.  

The unexpected nature of glitch makes the encounter with error very special.  

The error makes other ways of seeing not only possible, but necessary. The event created out of this encounter invents a space-time arrangement that leads to a re-evaluation of existingvalues.  

The virtuality added in the encounter is through the medium, as it is the capability of the medium to produce the error. The quality of the encounter depends upon the medium that is the interface between the error and the audience. The event then is not the solution to a problem, but rather opens up what is possible'io beyond the medium. Bruce Sterling's new aesthetics, biopunk and transhumanism are a part of these emerging possibilities.

We can only get in touchwith it through certain kinds of actualizations  

# Felix Stalder Information Economy//2005  

The new media are not bridges between man and nature; they are nature. -Marshall McLuhan'  

Digital media builds an integrated environment based on flows of information. Increasingly, this environment provides the primary setting for human agency; we talk to our friends over cellphones, we collaborate with people near and far via email, we even look up maps and physical places online. This does not imply that people are somehow becoming virtual, but virtually all human actions rely. in varying degrees, on digital information networks. Information ecology aims at understanding the properties of this environment in order to use its potential, avoid its dangers and influence its development positively.  

The basic elements of this environment are not materials - soil, houses, or any other tangible form of atoms - but intangible flows of information produced by and processed through media: information to communicate among people, to control processes across time and distances, to check and re-evaluate existing information, and to produce more new information. At the interconnections of such flows nodes arise. Nodes are structures built by the recurrent intersection of different flows which they, at the same time, process and direct. Nodes can have the form of large institutions, such as banks or government agencies that depend on the constant input of information which they process and feed back into the flow as new information. At the other end of the scale, personal identities are shaped by flows of information; built upon past experience and maintained and changed in the constant reshaping through the exposure to new information in everyday life. Nodes are intensifications and consolidations of flows in which they constitute structures that process the information, and by doing so maintain themselves and the continuity of the flows.  

These two elements, flows and nodes, are mutually constitutive, one builds upon the other. Flows without elements of structure would be noise, and nodes without flows would be dead. The interconnections between the nodes constitute the patterns in the flow of information. They provide the stabilization within the potentially fluid environment enabling navigation and purposeful, systematicaction.  

While the nodes stabilize the flows of information and endow a certain consistency and continuity to the environment, they are themselves subject to the dynamics of the environment. These dynamics, which are produced by the interactions of the nodes and shaped by the media that channel the flows, are themselves not reducible to any single node but are the result of the combination of all flows, of the interaction of all nodes at the given time reflecting their different capacities to influence. The dynamics, however, are not random; they have discernible patterns in which they develop.  

These patterns are the four basic dimensions of an information ecology:  

interdependency / change / time-boundness / differentiation  

# Interdependency  

All nodes are connected to other nodes through communicative processes. Other than mechanical machines that are isolated from one another, the very nature of the ecological environment is its connectedness. The uniqueness of each node, the fact that every node embeds a singular combination of connections to other nodes, ties them into one large shared environment in which all elements are interdependent. What makes this interdependency so vital is the 'material' of the flow: information. Information is not objective data, however; information is the relation which arises within the environment, and it is the difference that makes difference.2 Information results from relationships between two otherwise meaningless pieces of data, it relates both sides of the flow to each other. Marshall McLuhan saw this very clearly when he wrote: 'The 'meaning of meaning'is relationship.'3  

The economy in an integrated environment does not produce isolated products, such as soybeans or rolled steel, but local groupings of products that support each other. Companies exist in mini-ecologies structured by strategic alliances and synergetic partnerships. The decline of Apple Computers has been caused by locking in its operating system instead of licensing it to other manufacturers and profiting from the increased variety.4  

# Change  

The flow of information does not simply connect two sides; by being connected they change. A bridge does not simply couple two independent villages across a river but it creates a new city (or a new war).  

The flows of information are infinitely malleable. It is their intrinsic property to change their direction and quality instantaneously, a characteristic greatly accelerated by electronic media. Out of such changes new relationships arise which bring supposedly independent nodes into a sudden interdependency. Mergers and outsourcing are but one result of changes in information flows.  

However, change is neither additive nor subtractive in an integrated environment; it is ecological. One significant change generates total change. If a species is removed from a given habitat, what remains is not the same environment minus that one species, the result is a new environment and the conditions of survival within it have been reconstituted. This is also how the ecology of information works. New flows of information can change everything.5 The interdependence of the nodes means that information can travel through the whole environment and, according to the way it is reshaped in each node, it grows or decreases in relevance and speed.  

In an ecological environment where change is ubiquitous and sudden, the mode of survival is adaptation instead of optimization; as has been paramount under linear development during the industrial age. The newest version of a piece of software is not better because it has less bugs but because it incorporates new capabilities, adapting to the fast-paced changes of the Internet.  

# Time-boundness  

In an environment where information flows very quickly, at the speed of light through computer networks, and the new interrelations are born as fast as old connections die, time is a supreme factor. Apart from the fact that there is continuous change, nothing is fixed. Quick moves in the capital markets can wipe out institutions that were once the foundation ofglobalempires,as demonstrated impressively by the fall of Barings Bank in London. Information, the means to act upon the flows of information is only a resource as long as it is timely. The time span in which information really makes a difference is neither intrinsic in the information itself nor in the flow upon which it intends to act; but is determined by the relation between the node and flow, and by the purpose of action. For dealers in the capital markets fifteen minute old quotes are worthless, for the journalist who prepares the daily summary for a newspaper they are valid. And, for the analyst who tries to develop models for predicting the future movements. the quotes of the last couple of years may be of crucial importance as a testingground for his models.  

# Differentiation  

Information is difference, and the nodes survive as long as they can make a difference, which is for as long as they can produce information that is valid for others. In information ecology the basis for cooperation and survival is differentiation and not similarity. This is the difference between a network and a collective. Highly differentiated nodes can group together in order to respond to newly arising opportunities and dissolve once their mission has been achieved.  

Differentiation is the reduction of complexity. Vast amounts of data are reduced, according to the inner structure of the node, into specific information. This information, the difference between the node and the flow and among the nodes, is the basis upon which the flows are redirected, new connections are established and old ones maintained.

# Scott Lash Involuntary Flows and Involuntary Memory: In Conversation with Arjun Mulder//2003  

Arjun Mulder In the information society we can make databases with all the information in the world, but when we do that, we exclude involuntary memory?  

Scott Lash Exactly. In the information society we tend to think of memory in terms of the irreversibility of systems. Systems, socio-techno systems, or any kind of systems have a path dependency. Take llya Prigogine and Isabelle Stengers: their kind of vitalism - and they call it vitalism - breaks with Newtonian mechanism. Of course Prigogine is very Bergsonian. His reading of memory wants to make memory some kind of natural system, as in chemistry. But the same could apply to a socio-technical system, so that memory winds up being the path dependency of self-organizing systems. Memory is indeed, on the one hand, such a path dependency; I'm not saying it's not. But that is not the way we human beings experience it.  

I do believe that non-human objects experience one another as images, as Bergson and Deleuze claim. But I don't think that the representations we humans, or even humans working through prosthetic extensions make, are logical representations. A number of contemporary vitalists reduce the idea of representation to a kind of logical representation, to Cartesian representations. Whereas, what I am talking about is a more analogical representation, like in dreams. I think that that kind of thing is lost if we conceive of memory as purely informational. 1 think it is even largely lost in people like Deleuze. Although I want to work out the problematic of self-organizing systems, of the city as selforganizing organism, as far as I can, still I think a city is more than just that. The city is something that has strata, different levels and things underneath it that Can maybe be excavated, maybe get lost, maybe retrieved ...  

Mulder What is the value of involuntary memory in the information society? Is it just one of the stoppages in the information flows? ls it something that pushes the flows in a certain direction? Is it something that lets you fall out of the information and gives you a sort of transcendent experience?  

Lash Neither. I think that the stoppages in the information flows tend to be nonlinear systems. And although involuntary memory is not linear, it's not conventionally non-linear either, nor even necessarily a system. The trick here is: how can you make the transition from matter to memory, from some kind of informational matter to the kind of memory I want to talk about? I'm not sure youcan.  

Mulder Information flows and involuntary memory are two parallel worlds?  

Lash They might be. I think Deleuze winds up making a bit of a mistake, the way he wants to understand memory. Memory is for Deleuze the virtual. The virtual is memory, the plane of consistency, or the plane of immanence. All those things are the same for Deleuze. Like for example in his cinema books when he writes about the movement-image and the time-image. The virtual is actualized in the shot, the cinematic shot, le plan. Hence the shot is the movement-image, the actualization of the virtual. And it's a good thing, it's not mechanical, it's the proper actualization of the virtual. The time-image, on the other hand, is the virtual itself. The time-image is memory in the Bergsonian sense. The timeimage is life, because Bergson says memory is life. Life for Bergson is always so incredibly cultural, as distinct fron natural, from the naturalness of perception.  

The interesting thing with the information society - and this is where Bergson and Deleuze make all the sense in the world - is that previously in the old traditional dualist metaphysics of Descartes, which Bergson takes apart and Deleuze too, you've got matter and movement, which are physical, and then you have images and light, which come from consciousness. Bergson and Deleuze say we need to talk about a movement-image, that is, an image that is not just in consciousness, but also physical. Thus the old kind of dualism gets collapsed into a plane that is in between, and that plane-in-between is comprised of matterimages, which are image and matter at the same time. So then in a sense you've got almost: light = matter = image = movement. You get Einstein too, in a sense, because light is not in contraposition to matter.  

That's an exciting idea now, because the information society does that, doesn't it? In the manufacturing society it was easy enough to think in terms of base and superstructure, since matter was out there, and the material production formed the base, while images and culture formed the superstructure. But now we have this kind of immanent plane of consistency, this thing that is in between matter and light, and that is comprised of both. We're in a kind of an informational set-up, one which Deleuze characterizes as a primaeval soup, which is cool - as in the cooling down of the universe. And when the universe cools down you get objects and bodies. Then the bodies have perceptions of each other, and eventually you get subjects. The movement that counts now is no longer the Newtonian movement of bodies in space, but it's the vibrations, or the excitement, or the communications, or the intensities that are always between objects, and sometimes these objects are human ones. That's where the movement is in the information society.  

This is obviously an incredibly exciting position, and I can go along with it to a certain extent. But then memory comes in. And memory is clearly in the interval between reaction and action. So let's see: you're a body now in this cooled-off primaeval soup, and you're in this world with other bodies, which are sometimes human and often not human. You are perceiving these bodies in terms of your interests, because you don't have an overall view, and they see you in terms of their interests, even if they are non-human bodies. The kinds of action and reaction, and the kinds of intensities that are coming, have to do with these interests. The interval then is between your reaction to what is coming off these other bodies and your action, which is after the reaction.That interval between reaction and action is memory, in Bergson. So the longer that interval gets and the more that interval is a question of self-organization, the more it's like memory.  

That's where Bergson gets his dualism from. It's the transition from nature to culture, and from matter to memory. Bergson talks about it very much in terms of a human body. He doesn't have a primaeval soup, as Deleuze does. And Bergson also talks about dreams. Bergson say he's a dualist, while Deleuze and the Deleuzians are all monists. I find the Bergson position so attractive because, on the one hand, you've got this wonderful collapse of the matter/image/movement/ light stuff, and on the other, there is still space for dreams, for involuntary memory.  

Mulder But isn't involuntary memory the self-organizing part of the memory?  

Lash It is in a way. It is self-organizing, but ...  

Mulder ... it is also organizing you in a way.  

Lash That's what I think it is. And it's surely not consciously. It's definitely unconscious. And it works in analogical representations, and in terms of lost objects, like the Mother, the home. I'm not sure if it can't also work in terms of some kind of future dream. I'm not sure if it has to be as past-oriented as all the people I talked about make it, from Bergson to Freud. Having said all that, how do we make sense of the world? That's a huge question, for artists as well as theorists andordinarypeople.  

I think we make sense of the world through some sorts of mapping, and through some sorts of mapping on, I suppose, something like Deleuze's plane of consistency or whatever you want to call it. It's a mapping inside the real. It's a mapping in which we are mobile. I don't think it's primarily cognitive mapping at all. Cognitive mapping - Fredric Jameson had the concept in his book on postmodernism - came from Kevin Lynch in The Image of the City. Kevin Lynch was in the first generation of cybernetics, with Wiener, Weaver and co. The first generation had very much an 'Oh, I've got a bird's eye view' type of approach, 'and we're going to organize your system'. They were into an equilibriumed control/command/communication/intelligence kind of approach. Whereas the second generation of cybernetics and non-linear systems are more like Maturana and Varela: the mapping is autopoietic, in the world, it's no longer outside of us, and it's not cognitive. We're doing something like, not cognitive, but tactile mapping. This tactile mapping is not very far away from what Michel de Certeau talks about in The Practice of Everyday Life, in terms of walking in the city. I think it's mobile; it can be fast, it can be slow. We're no longer making sense of the world so much in terms of narratives or in terms of logic. I think we're doing it in terms of some kind of mobile mapping. This mobile mapping is also, of course, micro-electronic; we're online all the time. We're doing mobile mapping to make sense of the world in the same way that we're doing it in contemporary cityscapes.  

Then the question comes up: where does involuntary memory fit into this? Henri Lefebvre in The Production of Space starts with a spider, which I think comes from Roger Caillois, the old friend of Bataille from the College de Sociologie. So Lefebvre talks about this insect, a spider who moves in asymmetries and dissymmetries, making sense of space. And there you've got already protoperception happening and the production of space. So you've got sensemaking and production. It doesn't take a long time until we can work that through ourselves into some kind of transition from nature to culture. And then we're also producing space and are involved in this kind of mobile mapping. Making sense out of the world is Web weaving, it's a matter of cartography, of tactile mapping.  

The question then is: where is involuntary memory and where is the archive? I think that Derrida has got it very wrong. The archive is nowadays much more like a genetic archive, like a micro-electronic archive. That's the way I want to see it. The archive is memory; the archive is the plane of consistency. But, at the same time, it's the real. It's not Derrida's symbolic; Derrida is living in the past. And neither is it ideology a la Zizek. The archive is the real, it's the real as memory. But this kind of memory is not, I think, involuntary memory. It's the virtual.  

Mulder Basically your critique of Deleuze is that he is right about the information society, but he forgets exactly the part that the information society has forgotten, which is involuntary memory.  

Lash Exactly. What is going on with Deleuze, and with a lot of us, is, we're trying to make sense of the virtual. Since the virtual is never directly graspable, we can only get in touch with it through certain kinds of actualizations, whether we're artists, media-artists or coders in IT, or sociologists, or philosophers, or curators or whatever. We make sense of the virtual through this kind of tactile mapping I'm talking about. The only problem is that I don't think that's sufficient, because the virtual that we're trying to make sense of, the archive that we're trying to make sense of, is the informational archive, is the real. Deleuzians all say: 'Don't be melancholic, affirm everything: But you can't affirm everything. There is stuff that is lost.  

Mulder Does informationalization then entail radical forgetting, not so much of the flows, but of the part that makes sense of the world, the involuntary memory?  

Lash I think that we do make sense of the world in the flows. But I think in Deleuze there's too much forgetting. Deleuzians tend to go with Prigogine and see memory as path dependency of self-organizing systems. So memory winds up being not just an archive but an information archive. And I don't think that's enough. Yes, you can make sense of the world in the flows, but only in a limited way. There's also something else, and that something else is involuntary memory. That something else is a very ruptured symbolic with loads of problems, but it should not be totally forgotten, although it's never completely graspable. [...]

One Thing Leads to Another//1996  

One Thing Leads to Another centres on how we all construct models of information available, and how that information is often incomplete and randomly encountered.  

The work is founded on the exchanges between two people in the confined space of a room, the subsequent interactions being a possible metaphor for how social perceptions are built up, one event leading to assumptions about the next event, etc. One person was removed from the perceptual evaluations of the viewer, who is invited to try and find an identity that may match that person's behaviour in the sequence.  

The work was made from an actual event, with a model in her own living room, and a die which was thrown to create a random series of positions for her in the room. The die was also thrown to give the model a behaviour in relation to the other (obscured) person. As the die was thrown so the model moved around the room, enacting the behaviour given to her by the numbers that had turned up on the die. As the sequence unfolds, the viewer is drawn into looking at ever more complex and interactive exchanges between the two people in the room.

Moving between the Past-Present-Future//1997  

My everyday encounter with the world is a random bombardment of information. I then implicitly, but actively, filter this information into a model of what I think is happening, this being formed and reformed and referenced according to my shifting priorities. The composition of this unavoidable bombardment has a multichannel dimension, within what is effectively a mosaic of potential references, these are then prioritized according to my perceptual starting point. Thus the various positions I hold, physically, socially and cognitively, mean there is always an innate relativity in my relationship with this multichannel mosaic.  

In my desire to seek sense and order, not only are connections built by myself within the same bandwidth of experience, but across bandwidths, one affecting the other. Thus what I see is affected by what I hear and feel, etc., and vice versa, and it is this mix that enables the creation of my own personal experience.  

This idea of perceptual self-construction formed the rationale behind the work Moving between the Past-Present-Future, which presents the viewer with multichannel references emanating from an actual event that took place between four people. The viewer is invited to construct their own model of what they think is happening between the four people. The event to which they are referred took place at the Poster Studio in the Charing Cross Road, London, at midday on a Saturdayin July1995.  

Four people who had not met each other before were invited to a room at the Poster Studio to enact a random sequence of moves and responses to each other across a grid laid out on the floor. A die was thrown to create positions in the room for each participant, and then a piece of paper was drawn from a box that gave that person a particular behaviour to enact there, and then in response to the other three participants, who were also positioned on different parts of the grid. These changing relationships and responses to each other were photographed asthey tookplace.  

While the participants were moving around the grid enacting their given behaviours, a tape recording was made of ambient sounds audible inside the building, and a photographic documentation made of signs and objects present in theenvironment.  

The work was then structured into three related moments that represented the passage of time inside the room: the past, the present and the future. The decisions about which elements from the documentation are represented in these three parts was also given a random basis by throwing a die.  

So, though an actual event took place inside the Poster Room between the four participants, how it developed, and the viewers' perceptual reading of it in the presented work, is underpinned by a random series of procedures. The way in which references are laid out in each panel is therefore purposefully discrete and disparate, so that the viewer, in responding to a question about their own perception of the event, is reliant on the fabric of connections they create between the displayed references. This active process of constructing a model of what is an interpersonal exchange between four people parallels the relativity inherent in all perceptions, especially those of social events, a different story being possible each time the same information is approached and re-approached.  

Tom Sherman I Get Tired//2001  

I get tired of managing information all the time. It would be nice to just let go a little more. To go with the flow. I used to have a life after work. I was paid a salary to keep things organized in the office. When things were crazy busy, my job was to follow procedures to keep things moving and in tip-top shape. When things were quiet, my partners encouraged me to stir things up, then to put things back in order before I'd go home. That's what white-collar workers have always done: they use telephones and computers to manage information, to stir things up, and to put things back in order.  

My life got more complicated when I got hooked up at home. I set up a desktop and started working in the evenings and on weekends. I found I could straighten out the messes I'd made at work in my free time at home. I could get a lot more done by extending the office into my time off. I resisted the laptop thing because I needed some time to think, and commuting was the only time I had for myself. It seems as if I've always carried a cell phone on the road, for peace of mind. I use it mainly to keep in touch with my partners and family. I seldom initiate any business when I'm on the road. I know this limitation goes against the grain. I do answer work-related calls and react when I have to. Mostly, I listen to music and read novels. I do like to talk with my mother when I'm commuting.  

The other day I realized how sick I am of managing information. I feel like a damned cleric or a librarian. Most of my waking hours are spent opening and closing files, putting things back in order, hacking away at the snarl of traffic in my in-box, launching reassuring messages in response. Staying in touch with people I hardly know. I thought my life's work would be more creative. I thought I'd be the one making the messes - interesting, vital messes. Instead, I find I'm merely an extension of this year's software. I use the latest, most powerful software as a template for my highly effcient, productive behaviour. I'm consistent, methodical and orderly. There are loose ends, but these loose ends dangle in the Never-Never Land beyond the control of the system, the network somewhere beyond my desktop. I think about these loose ends when I'm commuting, between the time spent lost in my music, or in my novels, or talking to my mother.  

# Elizabeth Vander Zaag Nicetalky:In Conversation with Pooiside//2002  

Poolside What were the origins of Talk Nice?  

Elizabeth Vander Zaag In 1995-96 I was creating a parenting video, working a lot with interactive media and I thought wouldn't it be great if you could help people hear their tone of voice.  

Poolside Your sense is that people don't actually hear what they sound like?  

Vander Zaag After I did it I wasn't necessarily a better parent. I was just more aware when I was yelling at my daughter. My work isn't intellectual; it comes out of my own experience and it has to be something that I feel. So I created this very funny scenario where you get this 'tween' - an eleven or twelve year old - to do the dishes, and everybody who did it - this is in the mid 1990s remember, when people didn't realize all this stuff could be made - thought that the actress was in another room, because the responses were so accurate. It's generic, and so the scriptwriting was about generic conversations that you have.  

Poolside Tell me how you initially set about to do it. Did you decide you would have to construct a script that would properly fit into the mouths of the two youngactressesyou'dhired?  

Vander Zaag At the time that I was developing this idea, software technology was where it was at, and not content. I would just spin the content out real quick with a very low budget. That wasn't hard for me to make but the software is really quite complex and a lot of investment has gone into it. Speak and Yell is the name of the software and in real time it analyses certain prosodic elements of your voice. First of all, to have that happen in real time is quite amazing, and at the same time your computer has to process which video clip to call up as a result of the evaluation being done by the software.  

Poolside How many video clips were there that could be called up?  

Vander ZaagProbably fifty to a hundred. I don't exactly know.  

Poolside So if the responding voice indicated anger or frustration then the computer would register that tone and call up the appropriate response from the availablevideoclips?  

Vander Zaag Yes. The one with the volume control and the kids doing the dishes was pretty simple. It had five stacks with fifteen responses in each one. Talk Nice is different because it creates more of a story. First of all, there's a Waiting Loop in which you just chit-chat as if you were in the gallery but not sitting in the chair. Then there's a Coaching Section which has a fair number of clips in which you're coarhed on how to talk nice. That's where they do the 'I'm a Canadian, eh' bit. From this section you can go in different directions, so if your voice doesn't go up enough then you end up in the computer game room where you can get blown up. But if it does go up enough then you get to go to the Bubble Tea Room where the girls are discussing their party.  

Poolside So are you operating like a playwright or a linguist?  

Vander Zaag Neither, because we had to create a large database in which people said things in certain ways, we had to evaluate whether this was up or that was up, and then we had to take the slope of that. Pitched slope over time is what's going on in Talk Nice, which is quite a bit different from the earlier piece because you have to do backward analysis to see what kind of a slope change there was. So it's considerably more complex than just doing amplitude. The critical part has been developing the Speak and Yell software. There are other off-the-shelf programs that will check pitch but not over time. So this idea of pitch-over-time is unique to our software, and that takes much more work. Then when I did the content I got funding from the Creative Canadian Innovation Initiative and through the Banff Centre, so it was wel funded. It wasn't just a little project. I was able to hire a coder - a software sound programmer. They're in high demand and they don't work for cheap. The guy I've been working with all along is an artist named Leonard Paul. Because we're in the next stage of this now, I got funding from the Daniel Langlois Foundation to go online. The big challenge is to get the code to work outside of the Windows environment in all the libraries that it's working with.  

Poolside What's its utility? Apart from its aesthetic and interactive appeal, does it actually have a social function?  

Vander Zaag I'im hoping. I have given up waiting for the rest of the world to say this is what we need, so I'm just making stuff with it now. But it makes sense to me because there's no emotional expression in the interface with the computer. It's all through the hand; people do capital letters when they're upset, or when they want to speak loudly. It's so primitive. So I just thought what if we could bring voice to it? And they're starting to ship computers with microphones and games with little headsets. But you see everybody's hung up on word recognition, which is an area that doesn't interest me. I'm not into more information at this point in our overloaded times. I want there to be less, and more primal, information. Apparently, 80 per cent of communication is not the words; there's face and gestures and then there's tone.  

Poolside Could the reaction of the two young girls get more complicated?  

Vander Zaag Oh sure. If I could do more evaluation and measure different aspects of voice - like word rate and pausing and gender, which can be done from the physical attributes of your voice. I just don't have funds for that. So I'm stopping now with the development of the software; as far as I'm concerned it works pretty darned good. Now I'm trying to make it work online, because that offers a whole lot of new opportunities.  

Poolside I'm reminded of the idea of the feminine ending in speech patterns, in which a declaration sentence ends with an uncertainty. Are you gendering language? I suppose what I'm asking is whether you operate from the assumption that there is a gender to language, or is your project about discovering whether or not language is gendered?  

Vander Zaag I feel that there is definitely a difference, especially in the younger group. As you get older it blurs more. In our middle years it's not so different, but in our younger years it is quite different. I think it has an impact on younger women going into felds that are dominated by men. Initially, one of the barriers for their success is the way they communicate. I did a lot of training in technology and women would say 'thingamigiggy', or they would use a general word, and if you sit around and listen to a bunch of men talk about technology, they've all got anachronisms and proper nouns for everything, and they're kind of bullshitting each other with it. Whereas women know how the process works but they don't have the same language. I taught video first and then I taught multimedia, and that was one of the things that I found was creating a barrier for women. Technology is a coded language, and that's one of the reasons women have not risen to the top in the way men have. I can't say that these communication patterns would be the same in a church, say, or in a different social setting, but my focus was on the technology side of it, where I realized that there are different styles in the technology. The language has been evolved by men and it has excluded women in the style of talking, and maybe even women's style of thinking.  

Poolside There are probably more assumptions made about these ideas than there ishard data togo on?  

Vander Zaag But I've done research with teenage girls where they'll compete with each other to not be the best. I once watched some girls cutting up honeydew melons, and they all kept saying how they couldn't do it. Girls have this thing where one can't be that much better than the other because they're group-oriented. One of the other things that girls do is they overlap a lot, so that not one person is talking by herself. That shows agreement as well but I can't do overlapping.  

Poolside How do you describe your practice? What is a piece like Talk Nice?  

Vander Zaag I call it new media art. The difference is in the narrative pattern that you can do through interactive work and through traditional video. But I just work with what my work is. I think it's your job to figure out what it is, and whether it's art.  

Poolside You've watched people work with it a lot and I wonder if you've drawn any conclusionsfromwhatyou'veseen?  

Vander Zaag I'm always amazed by how much people want to perform. I'm really struck by that because for so long the art audience has been rendered mute. We're supposed to just gaze in awe. But this theatrical sense was really evident, especially when a bunch of people would come in and then they'd perform for each other as much as they'd interact with the girls. I never expected that and I've seen it in so many places. The kind of humour that people bring to it just astonishes me. People are generally funny when they're just having fun with each other but we never expect to have fun in an installation. It made me realize that this interactive medium is allowing the audience to be creative - you're just basically creating a shell which brings out the humour in people.  

Poolside Is this the equivalent of the interactive engagement when people play video games which test the manual and visual skills of the participants? Does your work make demands on a different part of our being?  

Vander Zaag I think it's about a different level of awareness. It is an artificial world but I'd say that the contrivance of some of the games I've played is much more pronounced. In Talk Nice you're actually forced to be in your world and your life, even though it's a teenager's life. As an artist, I'm more interested in that realism than in creating science fiction.  

Poolside So it represents a shift back towards the human through a technology that hasn't had much of a reputation for engaging our humanity?  

Vander Zaag Yes and that's partly because I'm a woman working in technology.

# Stephen Wilson Visualizing Net Activity: Stelarc//2002  

In the last decade, Stelarc has created an extraordinary set of performances and installations that explore the implications of technology for concepts and practicalities of the body. Many of his events reflect on the ways that our bodies are not under our own control. In several events he wires his body up to the Internet, either to reflect general activity levels or to allow specific individuals to tele-operate his body. In Parasite (1997) he uses images acquired via the Internet to map particular muscle stimulation. As Stelarc describes it, the 'cyborged body enters a symbiotic/parasitic connection with information':  

The body has been augmented, invaded, and now becomes a host - not only for technology, but also for remote agents. Just as the Internet provides extensive and interactive ways of displaying, linking and retrieving information and images, it may now allow unexpected ways of accessing, interfacing, and uploading the body itself. And instead of seeing the Internet as a means of fulfilling outmoded metaphysical desires of disembodiment, it offers, on the contrary, powerful individual and collective strategies for projecting body presence and extruding bodyawareness.  

In one PingBody event, Stelarc (located in Luxembourg) had his muscles stimulated by Web viewers in remote cities (Helsinki, Paris and Amsterdam). In another PingBody event, he linked his body's muscles directly to Net activity levels (with the length of time for a message to be sent to a location and return used as an indicator of the Internet's traffic in particular locations).  

Stelarc is a passionate spokesperson for a vision of humanity that reaches beyond the present limits of bodies. Defying categorization into either cyber optimism or cyber pessimism, Stelarc has created provocative events that sit uneasily in both worlds. His works reflect on current theoretical speculations on cultural control of the body but do not fit neatly into its categories. They go beyond the place that most serious researchers have yet ventured. Telecommunications is part of what fascinates Stelarc: How can we create composite, remotely linked bodies that question traditional notions of 'ownership' and locating the self? Telepresentally linked bodies can create a shifting, sliding awareness that is neither 'all-here' in this body nor 'all-there' in those bodies. This is not about a fragmented body but a multiplicity of bodies and parts of bodies prompting and remotely guiding each other. This is not about master-slave control mechanisms but feedbackloops of alternate awareness, agency, and of split physiologies ... the body not as a site of inscription but as a medium for the manifestation of remote agents.  

In our Platonic, Cartesian, and Freudian pasts these might have been considered pathological, and in our Foucaultian present we focus on inscription and control of the body ... Bodies must now perform in techno-terrains and data structures beyond the human scale, where intention and action collapse into accelerated responses...2  

Imagine a body remapped and reconfigured - not in genetic memory but rather in electronic circuitry. What of a body that is intimately interfaced to the WwW - and that is stirred and is startled by distant whispers and remote promptings of other bodies in other places? A body that is informed by spiders, knowbots, and phantoms? Consider the Internet structured so that it would scan, select and switch - automatically interfacing clusters of online bodies in real time.3

Break the Law of Information: Notes on Search Engines and Natural Selection//2003  

# Back Up  

There is no permanent back-up device for the Internet. A number of institutions have made one-off synchronous copies of the Web that claim to be complete for the duration of the period it takes their spiders to reach the furthest corners of the Web. There are also systems which actively monitor every email or newsgroup message sent on behalf of the odder fans of political action and dissolution.2 But of course both of these are partial. As what Gregory Ulmer has usefully called 'a pre-broken system', the net has no centralized back-up. Copies of elements of the net are backed up across thousands of storage devices off and across itself. Were the whole lot to go down, putting back together the results of such disgraceful degradation would be an insane task.  

Inevitably, some large areas of the Web would slide back into place with the efficiency of a file amongst filing cabinets. Others however - made on the fly, left without a double - would go missing. Still more would have their links tangled, lost - a mess of stringy, gloopy, gone data.  

Natural Selection? is in a sense the result of this crash before it happens. It is the Web, picked up in pieces by people who never made it, put back together in a way that makes more sense. It is obvious that the British Airports Authority site would 'want' to link to information about people getting killed by antiimmigration police. It is obvious that someone looking for information on fertility treatments would want to find a site mixing the histories of different acts of racial ‘improvement' into a corporate brochure. And it is obvious that anyone looking for traces of overtly racialized political activism on the net is going to want their browser to become infested by a fast-breeding Jamaican virus in the guise of a triple-consciousnessed poet.5  

# Black Box  

A search engine is a black box. That is to say, the relationship between its input and output is masked. The tension between making a search engine usable, predictable and ‘refinable', and the commercial necessity of maintaining its constituent algorithms and processes as proprietary information, provides one of thekey contextsfor thisproject.  

Piracy of any electronic technology is usually carried out by reverse engineering: feeding it inputs and monitoring its output until a tabulation of its workings can be drawn up. The black box is not actually cracked open and scrutinized, but is fed line after line until it can be simulated. What is true of the search engine is also true of the user. When you use HotBot, for instance, your search-string and all the links you make from the results to your enquiry are Iogged and recorded along with your domain and IP address.  

This information is useful for many reasons, and it becomes increasingly so over time with repeated use. It allows the more accurate targeting of search results to specific enquiry entries (according to frequency of choice) and advertising (according to proportional interest from certain domains). Any impression that engines are there to provide a useful service financed by incidental advertising is of course pure 'company history', as Yahoo calls it.  

Just as the engine helpfully provides a field in which you can type in your search-string, the engine is also opening up an aperture through which the user can be interrogated. There are always at least two black boxes in this equation. The interface is where they meet and engineer each other.  

Natural Selection sits on top of any of the mainstream search engines, filtering their results and, if certain strings are fed to it, slipping in a result from the bottom of the deck. The work is composed by making an interface to an interface. The user comes to the engine and presents a search string, a history of others and an Internet location. The composition is driven by the lure of access to data. As they come together, the various elements, devices and drives produce a doubleblinded bait-and-switch.  

It is this context, of the specific rules of formation, of the grammars of information put into play by various search engines - that Natural Selection operates in, and which this story hopes to open up a little. [...]  

# Instructions  

In search engines using automatic indexing to produce inverted files - the number of occurrences of a word related to the number of occurrences of all words in the file - an apparent transparency is generated by the simple procedure of pulling the words directly from the sites that they log. What is important, what is notable, appears simply by virtue of being logged by the crawler. Inevitably, this flat perspective produces an outcry about quality control. For information science,'it is entirely possible that vast concatenations of information resources are just not susceptible to any really effective measure of control and access, at least not by any automatic procedures applied on a large scale.6 The Web challenges not only the status of the document, the corpus, but also the index. This challenge is the result of an attempt to refuse, or at least avoid, the burden of classification built into the architecture of the Web.  

The Uniform Resource Locator, (URL) of the World Wide Web is an attempt to 'point to any document (or any other type of resource) in the universe of information'7 without a priori specification of the resource within any system of classification. Within this schema, anything that is digitizable can be stored, networked and located. The architecture of the Www is an attempt to route round classification, or at least provide a situation where many such interpretative formations can operate without universalization.  This is embedded not just in the device of the URL but also in details such as the simple geek idealism of physical and logical styles, (where, in the latter, the site designer can specify that the individually determined settings of the user's browser can determine the way to display certain forms of text emphasis). The WWW attempts to produce a 'preconceptual8 technology that - in a similar way to a computer's memory, storing both the data it uses and the programs the data is used with - produces a field within which concepts coexist alongside the rules to which the field is subjected.  

Elsewhere there has been discussion of how particular modes of use of HTML have tended to lock down the potential of the network into an idealized form of paper-based media.9 Here, though, I hope to move towards a consideration of how the rules of formation that operate in the construction of search engines produce many particular overt or anonymous ways of making and using the Web. It is not suggested that these are secret rules for the confabulation of the world beyond the magic gate internet into something that it is not, nor are they necessarily merely illusions, misinformation, bad habits of thought, but a series of perceptual devices which are themselves reliant on and interwoven with others - and which are as such open to reinvention.  

# The Eating  

[...] The most simple method of constructing a semantic network is to use a precodified arrangement of terms and their correlates - using a document like an expanded thesaurus to widen and clarify search possibilities'0 by aiding query formulation through synonym relations between words and hierarchical and other relations between concepts. Whilst top-down, ‘hard' semantic networks come into being on the basis of automatic word-sense disambiguation - the syntactical machine that allows and disallows conjugation with what word, with what it means - they aggravate polysemy in the sense that all ‘dictionaries advertise semantic discrepancies'," which allow other diachronic and synchronic meanings, other takes to leak through. However, hard semantic networks are like dictionaries again, in that even if effectively and constantly enriched by lexicographers, they still only really compose logs of past signifiance.  

At the same time, wbilst their hierarchical organization allows for an extremely coherent co-ordination of words from a single perspective, they are unable to negotiate the variable status of words as they are used. Allegory, irony, metaphor, repurposing - the rich meshwork of language that mitigates against its petrification - all go like woodcutters amongst the trees in the database, whilst utterly incommensurable figurations of language such as sacredness throw up errors, not just of computation, but of the essence they pretend to.  

One way of attempting to avoid disjuncture between the semantic model of the information referenced by the search engine and that of its users, in the way commonly imposed by hierarchically organized systems, is to assume that the words that are most commonly found together are actually related in some way. This is a technique that makes best use of machine rather than human interpretation of data. In Latent Semantic Indexing,12 a set of documents is represented by a matrix whose entries are measures of frequencies of occurrences of terms in each document. The greater the frequency of cooccurrence, the greater the relevance. This matrix is then approximated by a sum of rank-one matrices determined using a singular value or related decomposition. This allows for great compression of the data and fast, relatively robust and encompassing referencing of sites. However, what is found to be most related in terms of quantity doesn't necessarily match for each user, or each search. Latent Semantic Indexing finds a way of working the inverted file - mined with homonyms, synonyms and routes to a thousand pointless choice trees - that plays to the data processing strengths of computers, and thus avoids the implicitly ontological nature of directories. However, these techniques are always caught in a self-organized conformism to the homeostatic pressures of what is statistically deemed, by frequency of use and by frequency of cooccurrence, to be the most relevant.  

Searching for the most relevant, the most related - simply rendered as the most linked to - is another technique adopted by a variety of search engines in compiling their results from the inverted field. AltaVista, Excite, Infoseek, Inktomi3 rate sites higher in their list of search results if a substantial number of sites link to it. Google, usefully, makes this process visible and useable, allowing backlinking from its results. Related to 'citation analysis' - the scheme whereby the relative importance of scientific papers is accorded by the frequency of their being cited by other scientific papers - is another approach adopted in different ways both by the Web Stalkerl4 and by the Clever'5 project at IBM: We have developed a new kind of search engine that exploits one of the Web's most valuable resources - its myriad hyperlinks. By analysing these connections, our system automatically locates two types of pages: authorities and hubs. The former are deemed to be the best sources of information on a particular topic: the latter are collections of links to those locations'16 Authorities' are sites that are linked to many times; hubs' are sites that contain many links.17  

Despite their claims, Clever has no way of actually defining a topic other than by resorting to imposing hierarchical taxonomies. What it does do is - by defining a limited set of properties (links-to and links-from, as a way of organizing an interpretation of the topological form of the Web) - use some of ways the Web is actually put together to develop a representation of the emergent, unpredictable interplay of multipolar gravitational tendencies within the hyperlinked structure of the Web. Some of these may be sufficiently closely clustered to be interpretable from specific perspectives as a topic. Other sites which might be highly pertinent from other perspectives might not link at all. What Clever has usefully done, though, is to distinguish the structure of the Web from its content and use it as an organizational principle. What they collapse in their descriptions of the project is the distinction between the hierarchical pretence to objectivity and what they actually represent, which is an aggregate of subjective decisions by the thousands of people making sites to incorporate hyperlinks. Here, objectivity is less about realism than it is about intersubjectivity'18 \*Self-organization' as a phrase may smell like anarchist democratics, but it is in the choice of which elements register as the evidence for, or as the most consequential part of, the self-organization of this data that the political choice - closed to scrutiny or reinvention - as to what is important on the Web or about the Web is made. It is a symptom of a self-reinforcing 'misplaced concreteness' that the mode of interpretation of processes becomes the means by which they are moulded.  

Go to a search engine of either sort and type in Jamaica'. You'll get information on holidays coming up first - along with banner adverts for Sandals resorts. Type in 'Africa' and you'll get predominantly wildlife and famine. Selforganization of data is organized on the basis of what 'self' is determined to be important. This, at present, is something put into place by the demographics of internet use. How data is interpreted and processed, how the grammar sorts and orders the strings of symbols (whether they are hierarchically ordered, or ordered according to emergent compositions of specified elements) has immense importance. When most of this work is done by a closed culture of proprietary specialists, finding ways in which this process can be opened up to speculation and organisation by other forms of 'self' becomes even more imperative - finding ways in which this process can be opened up to speculation and organization by other forms of 'self' even more so. [...]

# Srinivas Aditya Mopidevi Solid Seas and Moving Constellations//2016  

The euphoria that surrounded the proliferation of digital processes began wearing off over the past few years, following the recognition of solidities in the otherwise fluid flows of information. The present landscape of the digital infrastructure operates in a simultaneous tension of being overtly institutionalized whilst actively vectored by pirate circuits and shadow economies. This continuous negotiation between formal and informal networks opens up a fresh set of questions and conceptual trajectories on the digital and the specific conditions of contemporaneity it fuels.  

If we were to ask: where and how does one locate the digital within the current crisis of contemporaneity, does one look at it as a process or as a medium? Or, as the force produced by dispersed financial markets that ride largely on digital networks? How do their leakages, breakdowns, crashes, reversals and porosities remind the world that it is running through, and is manned by, the chaotic medium that is the digital?  

These massive expansions also realign human relationships to geographic locations and cultural imaginations, complicating the logic of conceptualizing contemporary practices as spoken through the frame of nation. In other words, contemporary cultures increasingly mobilized by the digital demand of a different territorial approach, one that thinks beyond the categories of the nation-state. Moreover, these framings that are premised on a singular national identity have proved inadequate to engage with the diverse temporal and spatial manifestations of contemporary practices. As a methodological response to such attitudes, I propose here an assemblage of stories around ships, seas, solids, liquids, impostors and missing persons. They come together to speak through the multiple dimensions of digital contemporaneity vis-a-vis the global capital postulated for us by some practitioners of art.  

# Fluid Extensions  

Sociologist Zygmunt Bauman proposed the idea of liquid modernity' as a response to the altered dynamics of capital and power circulations after the global expansion that was fuelled predominantly by developments in cultures of communication. In this era, a new type of war persists, not the one which conquers a new territory, but the one that crushes and dissolves the walls and boundaries that come in the way of newly dispersing liquid flows of capital and power. As Bauman observes, for power to be free to flow, the world must be free of fences, barriers, fortified borders and checkpoints. Any dense and tight network of social bonds, and particularly a territorially rooted tight network, is an obstacle to be cleared out of the way.' According to him, the restlessness and Openness inherent to liquidity as such creates greater inequality and more social and economic polarization. These inequalities shall be generated by the increasing rise of a fluid giobal elite and the dispersed institutional structures of control leading to disenfranchisement of the poor and other marginal people in the name of their welfare and reorganization.4  

Drawing on Bauman's postulations, I invoke here territorial waters as an analogy, to speak of digital technologies that indeed act as major instrumental forces in blurring borders and boundaries. In the conventional sense, territorial waters are waters that exist within the jurisdiction of the state, extending 12 nautical miles at most from shore.5 The collision of the word 'water' with 'territory' gives an understanding of the latter as a fluid dimension - not only as solid land, but also as fluid water - thus further extending the directions of its flow and helping it seep in and out of various territorial limits, lands and formations.  

The digital turn, then, can be understood as a massive interruption and disruption, perhaps as large as a volcanic eruption, a hurricane for that matter, even comparable to a tsunami, leading many territorial waters (practices) to converge, jump over, spread across and run through to a number of locations and territorial limits. Every meeting site of these convergences is fragile, as it allows for newer significations/power relations to emerge, often extending beyond the specific baggage of the territorial entities they began with. This interruption is also instrumental in extending the fluid dimensions of the present, in the ways practices are made and shared across sites and contexts. The concepts of interruption and disruption are useful in contrast to something like an intervention in identifying the repercussions of the digital on artistic practice. While an intervention is like an arrow that is prefigured with some definite motive, interruptions and disruptions are like teasers to the very foundations of practice, which swing their directions to terrains we have not anticipated or foreseen.  

The baggage of territories within contemporary practice is shrunken, diluted and perhaps dissolved in the circulation of these interrupted flows. The larger labels of nationality and ethnicity are unpacked to reinvent more mobile forms, where identities and significations liquefy on the move and as they move.6 As Irit Rogoff suggests, the meaning of the work/practice is not immanently hidden but generated as the event unfolds.7 According to this logic, every event is a new unfolding, as it allows the practice to acquire newer forms and intensities.  

The instances I cite here collaborate to produce' an event, one that does not have any predefined goal. They come together to unfold a range of postulations on mobility, capital, trade, the digital and subjectivity, moving and building layers of conceptual relationships and contradictions.  

# Imaginary Geographies  

Partly resembling a worldscape, and partly a memory drawing, the process of The Great Bare :Mat & Constellation, a project by the Delhi-based Raqs Media Collective, began vith a netvwork map of links, layers, nodes, conversations and friendships shared through and between three personal computers of the Raqs members. From being a digital draving on the computer screens of Raqs, it went on to take the form of The Great Bare Mat, fuelling levels of conversations and collaborations betveen artists, anthropologists, historians. philosophers, scientists and musicians from different parts of the world.8  

On a second take, the drawing resonates the lines of experience we inhabit in today's world that is made up of the sign system of graphic scribbles. It suggests to us imaginary geographies beyond a specific cartographic representation, aiding us to see them as threads.lines and colour hues, whose beginnings and belongings are multiple and are continuously multiplied.  

In another register of voyages, transitions and departures, in The Knots that Bind are the Knots that Fray, Raqs use found footage of the last distinct Titan cranes that were dismantled and loaded onto a heavy load vessel at the Tyneside Swan Hunter Shipyard in northern England and shipped all the way to the Bharati Shipyard on the west coast of India.  

The ghostly forms within the images allude to floating worlds, to the enchantment of industrial machinery and the life of ships ... indefinite and suggestive of place, evoking an archive built by acts of remembering. The video enthusiast's footage of a piece of local history is transformed in this work into vignettes from a fantastical voyage. The vork is both about drifting away and coming ashore. The knots' of the titie can refer both to nautical speed as well as to the complex ties that bind people to histories. Ties hold things together and speed frays them apart. The knots that bind are the knots that fray.9  

The dismantling of the cranes followed by their displacement allows for their histories to float away from England and into sites on the distant west coast of India, acquiring newer forms and perhaps roles. The footage placed in this form is not only in the register of the specific voyages that history has not accounted, but a reminder for us to think about histories of spaces/places also, in terms of past/lost voyages and found footage.  

# Voyages in Solid Seas  

In a contrasting register of voyages and journeys, the Milan-based collective Multiplicity argues that the territorial waters have lost fluidity and become solid around Europe.0 On Christmas night, 1996, a wooden ship which Multiplicity refers as 'the ghost ship' sank in the Mediterranean sea with 283 Tamil, Pakistani and Indian migrants on board, leading to their death.!1 The investigation of the 'ghost ship' project tells us that despite survivor statements and the discovery of human remains in fishermen's nets, the authorities of the countries involved in the sinking denied the tragedy for five years. Proof only came to light with the facts unearthed by the Italian newspaper La Repubblica, which discovered and flmed the wreck with a remote-controlled underwater camera, 19 miles away from the coast of Sicily. Since then, very few developments have taken place and the 283 bodies that sunk with the ship still lie at the bottom of the sea. While no attempts whatsoever were made to recover and identify them, all the passengers of the'ghost ship'who were drowned in the Mediterranean were considered to be'missing' by the law.2From this point of reference, the collective postulates:  

The Mediterranean is becoming a 'Solid Sea'. A territory ploughed by predetermined routes, unsurpassable boundaries and subdivided into specialized and strictly regulated bands of water. A solid space, crossed at different depths and with different vectors by clearly distinct fluxes of people,goods, information and money.!  

Whoever enters the Mediterranean today has to acquire a stable identity, and 'whether they be immigrants, fisherman, military personnel, cruise passengers, oil platform workers, or beach holiday makers, their “costumes" will not be abandoned until the end of their journey across the water.'14  

Mobility as such, then, can only occur within the paradigms and costumes set in place by the state - that is, as citizen and population. This anticipation of completely formed subjects is conceptually displaced and unsettled by the practices and processes of the contemporary. For instance, take Raqs Media Collective's invocation of figures such as impostors and missing persons, who are not subjects in the complete sense; they exist in a continuous flow of becoming but never actually become. They are figures that are always on the move, in disguise, and cannot be easily looked upon within the categories conceptualized by the state.!s \*They are not territorially bound; they are everywhere, dispersed - in time, in space. They come and stand in, like spectres, phantoms, more as intruders into the conceptual worlds, messing up neat partitions and legibility.'6 And as non-subjects or not yet subjects, they point us to directions of unbounding and unsettling existing territorial understandings by postulating conceptual intrusions and teases.  

The suggestion of 'solid sea', then, leaves us with halts in the flow of territorial waters and subjective formations. The digital is not just a single, homogeneous event like the tsunami or the hurricane, but a cluster of continuous occurrences and fluid intensities, of flows, ebbs and whirlpools, not in a defined sequence, but as multiple and contemporaneous interruptions.  

# Velocities and Flows  

In another project that expands the discussion of mobilities, Multiplicity takes our attention to the stories/realities of borders in the Mediterranean that have been continuously reconfigured in the increasing global reorganization. Under the heading Border Device(s), Multiplicity looks at boundaries as devised in the forms of Funnels, Pipes, Folds, Sponges, Phantom Limbs and Enclosures, a variety of solid passages through which flows of water, people, goods and information are channelized and controlled.  

Funnels channel the disorderly flows of objects and individuals to place - along a coast or a border - such as the boats that ferry immigrants between the Mediterranean. Some boundaries are like the impenetrable Pipes, like the highways which cross Israel and Palestine. There are boundaries that emerge between the Folds of two territories in conflict, such as the strip of desert cutting through the Nicosia. Boundaries that are like Sponges attract populations and investment to create new communities. Like Phantom Limbs, other boundaries continue to function even when they no longer exist. But above all, everywhere in the world there are Enclosures: barbed wire or concrete barriers, or mobile ones.17  

Multiplicity's invocation introduces a diversity of passages leading the so-called flows of practices, people, information and goods. They foreground the relationships between the different range of solid entities and their role in channelizing and controlling liquid flows. This organization and movement works quite in contrast to Bauman's proposition that sees global expansion in terms of liquid flows, and where reconfigured forms of solids (as suggested by Multiplicity) still seem to be playing a crucial role.18  

# Free Trade and Free Ports  

While Multiplicity takes us through how borders are reconceptualized within the once-utopian space called the Mediterranean, CAMP, an artist's collective based in Mumbai, directs our attention to the free trade routes/relations between Sharjah and Somalia, through their project Wharfage.9 ‘Foregrounding the millennia old nautical ties linking the Gulf, South Asia and East Africa, Wharfage recasts the Indian Ocean as a space of connection, communication and exchange.20 Invoking the ideas of free port' and free trade', the project speaks of transacting and sharing goods, traders, sailors and workers between the old ports of Sharjah and Somalia - a collection of semi-state entities. This engagement, as CAMP formulates it,  

may offer a few ways to think about how ‘business' and the spectral lives of these commodities and traders, point to life beyond war or 'global capital'. With pirates up ahead and economic crisis at their tail, these mountains of goods and their sailors may trace old trade routes, but map out something new: a contemporary landscape of used things, break-in-bulk' trade, diasporas, and giant wooden ships beingbuilt in Salaya,Gujarat.21  

While CAMP references free trade and free ports, Allan Sekula's popular Fish Story tells us a tale of the maritime world, labour, and, more specifically, the cargo container as the signifying object of contemporary capitalism. Fish Story speaks of the maritime world as one not only of gargantuan automation, but one that also consists of 'isolated, anonymous, hidden work, of great loneliness, displacement and separation from the domestic sphere'.22  

Sekula's interest, as he notes, is 'to find a social within the sea, as Melville did. Fish Story is an “art historical" study tracing the lineage of the representations of the sea economy from Dutch seventeenth-century painting to the unacknowledged “objective correlative" of the cargo container found in Minimalist and Pop art, whether it be the Brillo Box of Andy Warhol or the serial cubes of Donald Judd. For shippers who speak of “"intermodality", the box is more important than the vehicle. So, the package begins to assume a life of its own, a kind of ghostly animation.'23 Sekula speaks of cargo containers as the 'coffin of remote labour power, since the labour that produces these goods is always situated in 'the fluid, reassignable sites determined by the relentless questforlowerwages'24  

The art-historical referencing of Fish Story is taken to a completely new level by the Periferry project,2 initiated by Guwahati-based Desire Machine Collective, which transforms a ferry into a physical site of their artistic process and collaboration.2 This floating space/place currently acts as a discursive laboratory facilitating latent philosophical and artistic worldviews. Formerly known as M.V. Chandardinga, this vessel was run by the Department of Inland Water Transport, Government of Assam, to ferry people from across the river Brahmaputra and also for transporting goods to many places on National Waterway no. 2.27  

The attempt of the project Periferry has been 'to restore the ferry into a media lab using renewable energy sources and eco-friendly material'.28 It is also considered to be a turning point to look differently at the floating relations of inland water transport on the Brahmaputra, an important water channel connecting Tibet, China, India and Bangladesh.29 The context of the project is largely situated in the ferry docked on the river - an 'in between' space, where many places and experiences meet to open up a dialogue, produce collaborations, articulate resistances, precisely fuelling various kinds of public and private engagements.30  

# Conclusion  

In contemporaneity's discontinuous relationship with fluids and solids, the digital can be mapped both as a life-expanding and a life-threatening combination of forces. The practices of the contemporary take up the task of water diviners tracking fault lines, trapped fluids, seismic zones and even border matrices.  

The logic of looking at the sea or other water bodies as conceptual sites of the social, where transformations can be mapped, realized and argued, is seen as the impulse of contemporaneity that the above-cited practices share. Bauman's proposition of the fluid reorganization of power and capital, flowing beyond the barriers and borders of the state, is contested in Multiplicity's thesis by pointing our attention to the solid passages that direct and govern the flows of people and information. In a world that increasingly communicates through the digital, border devices are relocated to newer sites, where passwords and plug-ins appear as extended forms of control and surveillance. Yet the free ports and trade on wooden dhows continue, barely affected by the changes of contemporary global capital; ferries are mobilized as Periferrys, for alternative artistic and philosophical imaginations. In a nutshell, all the fish and all the ships have different stories to tell, of being and belonging, and of politics and possibilities.  

In its strict technological definition, digital is understood to be a technological system that converts and produces different forms of information, images, audio and video into discrete and discontinuousdatavalues.

# Erica Scourti  

# A Life in Adwords, Algorithms and Data Exhaust: In Conversation with Marc Garrett//2013  

Marc Garrett In March 2012 you began the long, Internet-based, networked art project Life in AdWords, in which you wrote and emailed a daily diary to your Google mail account and performed regular webcams where you read out to the video lists of suggested keywords. These links, as you say, are 'clusters of relevant ads, making visible the way we and our personal information are the product in the “free" internet economy'. Firstly, what were the reasons behind what seems tobe a very demandingproject?  

Erica Scourti Simply put, I wanted to make visible in a literal and banal way how algorithms are being deployed by Google to translate our personal information - in this case, the private correspondence of email content - into consumer profiles, which advertisers pay to access. It's pretty widespread knowledge by now that this data ends up refining the profile marketers have of us, hence being able to target us more effectively and efficiently; just as in Carlotta Schoolman and Richard Serra's 1973 video TV Delivers People, which argues that the function of TV is to deliver viewers to advertisers, we could say the same about at least parts of the Internet; we are the commodities delivered to the advertisers, which keep the Web 2.0 economy free'. The self as commodity is foregrounded in this project, a notion eerily echoed by the authors who coined the term 'experience economy', and who are now promoting the idea of the transformation economy in which, as they gleefully state, 'the customer is the product!', whose essential desire is to be changed. The notion of transformation and self-betterment, and how it relates to female experience especially within our networked paradigm is somethingI'm reallyinterested in.  

As Eli Pariser has pointed out with his notion of filter bubbles, the increasingly personalized Web employs algorithms to edit invisibly what we see, so that our Google searches and Facebook news feeds reflect back what we are already interested in, creating a kind of solipsistic feedback loop. Life in AdWords plays on this solipsism, since it's based on me talking to myself (writing a diary), then emailing it tomyself and then repeating to the mirror-likewebcam a Gmail version of me. This mirror-fascination also implies a highly narcissistic aspect, which echoes the preoccupation with self-performance that the social media stage seems to engender; but narcissism is also one of the accusations often levelled at women's mediated self-presentation in particular, despite, as Sarah Gram notes in a great piece on the selfie,' it being nothing less than what capital requires of them.  

And as this project is a form of autobiography and diary writing, it could also be seen as both narcissistic and an assertion of the importance of personal experience and emotions in the construction of a humanist, unified subject. Instead, I wanted to experiment with a way of writing a life story that operated somewhere between software and self, so that, as Donna Haraway says, 'it is not clear who makes and who is made in the relation between human and machine'. Part of the humour of the project arises from the dissonance between the staged realism of the webcam (and my real cat/hangover/bad hair) with the syntactically awkward, machinic language, which undermines any notion that this diary is the expression of any authentic subject.  

The demanding aspect of it is something I was interested in too, since it calls up the notion of endurance as a virtue, and therefore as a value-enhancer, which many artworks - from mind-boggingly labour intensive supercut-style videos to sculptures made from millions of pins (or whatever) - trade on. You just can't help but ask, 'Wow ... how long did that take?!' - as if the time, labour and effort, i.e. the endurance, necessarily confer value. So there is a parallel between a certain kind of 'age of austerity' rhetoric that valorizes resilience and endurance, and artworks that trade on a similar kind of doggedness - as Life in AdWords does.  

And finally - it made me laugh. Some of the text was so dumb, and funny, it amused me to think of these algorithms dutifully labouring away to come up with key-phrases like 'Yo Mamma jokes' and ‘weird pants'.  

Garrett It ran until 20th January 2013, and ended due to system changes in the Gmail ad settings. How many videos did you produce and were you glad when it all had finally ended?  

Scourti Not sure how many I made - but I was six weeks short of the intended year, so definitely over 300. Actually I was infuriated and somewhat depressed when it ended without warning and in a moment of panic I even thought about somehow cheating it out to the end; but working with a system that is beyond your control (i.e. Google) necessarily involves handing over some of your authorial agency. So instead I embraced the unexpected ending and threw a kind of send-off party plus performance in my bedroom/studio to mark it.  

But this question of agency is obviously crucial in the discussion of technology. and runs through the project in various ways, beyond its unintended termination. At the level of the overall structure, it involves following a simple instruction (to write and process the diaries every day and do the webcam recording) which could be seen as the enactment of a procedure that echoes the operation of a software program carrying out automated scripts. And on the level of the texts, while all the language used in the project was generated and created by the software, I also was exercising a certain amount of control over which sections of the diary I favoured and editing the resulting lists, a move which seemingly reasserts my own authorial agency.  

Thus the texts are more composed and manipulated than they first appear, but of course the viewer has no way of knowing what was edited out and why; they have to take it on faith that the texts they hear are the 'real' ones for that diary.  

Garrett During this period you recorded daily interactions of the ongoing experience onto webcam. As you went through the process of viewing the constant Google algorithms, I'm wondering what kind of effect it had on your state of mind as you directly experienced thousands of different brands being promoted whilst handing over the content once again, verbally to the live camera?  

Scourti I'm not sure what effect it had on my state of mind, though considering the amount of concerned friends that got in touch after viewing the videos, Google certainly thought I was mostly stressed, anxious and depressed. Maybe it's just easier to market things to a negative mind state.  

But also the recurrence of these terms was no coincidence; early film theorist Tom Gunning has argued that Charlie Chaplin's bodily movement in Modern Times 'makes it clear that the modern body is one subject to nervous breakdown when the efficiency demanded of it fails', and compares his jerky, mechanical gestures with the machines of his era.2  

So I was interested in whether, and how, you could do something similar for the contemporary body; how can we envisage it and its efficiency failures in relation to the technology of today, when our machines are opaque and unreadable, if we can see them at all. Maybe what they look like' is code (a type of language , so it would entail some kind of breakdown communicated through language rather than bodily gestures - though the deadpan delivery certainly evokes a machinic 'computer says no' type of affectlessness.  

Also, Franco Berardi has spoken of the super-speedy fatigued denizen of today's infoworld, for whom 'acceleration is the beginning of panic, and panic is the beginning of depression'. In a sense this recurrent theme of stress and anxiety disavows the idea of the efficient, ever-ready, always-on subject of neoliberalism - and yet the project as a whole kind of sneakily joins the club too, since it obeys the imperative of productivity by turning a diary (personal life, non-work) into a ‘project'(i.e.work).  

As mentioned earlier in terms of the 'transformation economy', I'm really interested in this idea of efficiency also as it manifests in rhetorics of selfbetterment, and its relation to the neoliberal promotion of self-responsibility (if you're poor, it's your fault ...). Diaries and journal writing - as well as meditation, yoga, therapy, self-help, etc. - are often championed in everything from cognitive fitness to management literature as excellent ways of becoming more 'effcient'. The underlying belief seems to be that by unloading all the crap that weighs you down, from emotional blockages to unhelpful romantic attachments to an overlybusy mind, you'd get an 'optimized you. Why this is necessarily a good thing - apart from the elusive promise of 'happiness' of course - is never really discussed.  

[The French collective] Tiqqun's notion of the Young Girl, the model consumercitizen, is interesting in this regard - taking good care of oneself reframed as a form of subservience which maintains the value and usefulness of our bodies and minds to capital. Their idea that the Young Girl (not actually a gendered concept in their estimation) 'advances like a living engine, directed by, and directing herself toward the Spectacle' also points to the irony beneath what appears to be a very humanist/individualist inflection to these discourses of selfrealization: they could also be read as a latent desire to become somehow more 'machine-like', as if we could therapize/meditate/journal/jog away our mindjunk with the swiftness and ease of emptying the computer's trash, thereby becomingmoreproductive.  

And yet I'm clearly complicit in this, as I write diaries, meditate, do yoga and obsess over my bad time management, as Life in AdWords makes clear both in the recurrence of all these activities in the texts and obviously in its structure as a daily journal project,  

Garrett [...] [W]hat have you learnt from your own experience, and how do you see others regaining some form of conscious independence from this state of sublimation?  

Scourti Regaining conscious independence ... hmm. I found it interesting that during the project, the people I explained it to would often report back to me on what keywords their emails had produced, and what adverts came up on Facebook, as they hadn't really noticed before - so perhaps in these cases it made people more conscious of the exchange taking place in the free' Web economy. Others took up AdBlocker in response, which is one way of gaining distance - by opting out. However, the info each of us generates is still useful, since even if you aren't seeing the ads, your choices and interactions are still being parsed and thus help delineate a particular user group of citizen-consumers.  

Despite this, my feeling is that opting out - if it's even possible - can be a way of pretending none of this stuff is happening. I'm generally more interested in finding ways of working with the logic of the system, in this case the use of algorithms to sell things back to us, and making it overly obvious or visible. Geert Lovink asked whether its possible for artists to adopt an 'amoral position and see control as an environment one can navigate through instead of merely condemn it as a tool in the hands of authorities' and his suggestion of using Google to do the ‘work' of dissemination for you, in spreading your meme/ word/image, is one I've thought about, particularly in other works (especially Woman Nature Alone). This approach entails hijacking the process by which Google's algorithms organize the hierarchy of visibility to one's own ends - a 'natural language' hack, as Lovink puts it.3  

In contrast, Life in AdWords makes visible the working of the algorithmic system more on the level of the language it produces. It also employs humour, and laughter has been one of the main responses people have had when watching the videos, for a number of reasons. The frequent dumbness of the language and/ or the juxtapositions (\*Where is God?', 'Eating Disorder Program'); the flattening out of all difference between objects/feelings/places (e.g. work-related stress, cat food, God, Krakow); and the lack of shame the software exhibits in enumerating bodily and mental malfunctions (blood in poop, wet bed, fear of vomiting) are all quite amusing in and of themselves.  

That shameless aspect also echoes the over-sharing and ‘too much information' tendencies the Web (especially social media) seems to encourage, which Rob Horning has written about in his excellent blog, Marginal Utility. It also foregrounds that whatever the algorithrns can do, what they still can't do is emulate the codes of behaviour governing human interaction - including knowing when to shut up about your ‘issues'.  

The frequent allusions to these bodily and mental blockages also point to the limits of the productivity imperative - a refusal to perform enacted through minor breakdowns - while bringing it back to an embodied subject, who despite her immersion in networked space is still a body with messy, inefficient feelings, needs and urges. And the comically limited portrait the keywords paint maybe suggests that despite the best efforts of Web 2.0 companies, we still are not quite reducible to a list of consumer preferences and lifestyles.

Communication:44 Statements//1995  

There was a time without Mail-Art. There will be a time without it.   
2 The task of Mail-Art is to bring dysinformation into the information systems, discommunication into the communication systems, emotion into the logical systems.   
3The world is not the world. There are different networks of ideas about the world (in the minds of men/women and in minds' extensions).   
4 From a holistic point of view, there are no Mail-Art objects, there are Mail-Art relations; differences that we notice by comparing things. Relations are thought-patterns.   
5   The essential feature of Mail-Art is not imitation/mimesis (Plato), beauty (Kant), expression (Croce), form (Bell), signs (Goodman). It is communication. The notion 'communication' is no more or less mysterious than the previous universals. It is the transfer of (aesthetic) information, the exchange of (aesthetic) meanings.   
6All 'things' communicate. They cannot 'not-communicate'. This idea concerns objects not intended to communicate. We communicate - we can do no other. The meaning of a Mail-Art tool becomes determined (or modified) by the use of a communication system. A postcard receives its meaning via the sending.   
8  The efficiency of a Mail-Art message derives from its ability to provoke communication.   
9  One aim of aesthetics is to construct a value-system, a logical model of taste to judge or condemn works of art.   
10 Unconscious or not, mail-artists are not without aesthetic preferences. Yet their individual aesthetic opinions don't have much influence on the communicative working of the Network.   
11  Aesthetics is the theology of Art ([Jack] Flam).   
12 In principle, every Mail-Art work is unfinished. It is an aesthetic text asking for a reply. Every work starts a new process, a never-ending story.   
13 Mail-Art is a movement without aesthetic manifestos. It doesn't maintain its unity and unanimity thanks to the existence of a bundle of principles or a constitution, but through the fact that there are no communicative prescriptions. Mail-artists always communicate, again and again. The keystone of Mail-Art is reciprocity.   
14 Mail-Art is a communication sculpture.   
15 Mail-Art is not an artistic island. It is a cultural peninsula of the socio  

economic continent. An appendix that could be called a consciousness of art in a non-poetic space. [I..] 19 Essentially, the aesthetic communication is more important than the objects of art. The durability of the communication-works does not matter. Their effect is in the moment. From this point of view communication archives are a contradiction. [..] 24 The aesthetic space of Mail-Art is everywhere'. The whole world has become a field of aesthetic action. The aesthetic time of Mail-Art is always'. Night o1 day, mail-artists are permanently sending and/or receiving I... 34 Mail-Art means decentralization of art communication. The Mail-Art structure is a 'comcon', a completely connected communication network. Everyone can write to every member and as much as she/he likes. I..] 36 Accidental or telepathic interchange and also crossing communication are typical occurrences in Mail-Art. [...] 42 Words fail. [...]

# Eric Gidney The Artist's Use of Telecommunications//1984  

Since the early 1970s, an increasing number of artists have been experimenting with telecommunications media. However, the first live two-way satellite video transmission by artists took place between East and West coast USA in 1977. Through Two Way Demo, the Send/Receive Satellite Network, the centre for New Art Activities and the Franklin St. Arts Centre, all of New York, collaborated with a large number of artists in a NAsA sponsored, three-day demonstration, using the jointly owned US/Canadian Hermes CTS Satellite. The experimental exchange was simulcast to an estimated 25,0o0 cable TV viewers in San Francisco and New York.  

In the same year Douglas Davis, working with Nam June Paik and Joseph Beuys, created an extraordinary live telecast which was transmitted via satellite to more than 30 countries, including the USA, USSR and most of Europe - perhaps the largest audience ever assembled for an art performance. The programme, which opened Documenta 6, concluded with Davis's performance The Last Nine Minutes.  

In Vancouver, under the umbrella of the Direct Media Association, Bill Bartlett has organized a series of public information expositions. These have included teleconferences using slow-scan video and computer communication networks. Two of the more interesting projects are Pacific Rim - Slow-Scan, based at the Vancouver Art Gallery, and the 'Artists' Use of Telecommunications' conference held at the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art in 1980.  

Pacific Rim was a visual communication link established between members of the Peacesat users group in the Pacific using the ATS-1 NASA satellite and 20 hours of transmission time. There was audience participation at all locations including Raratonga, Santa Cruz, Wellington and Vancouver.  

Via the IP Sharp timesharing network and a conference telephone link'Artists' Use of Telecommunications' brought together artists and groups in eight cities in Austria, Canada, Japan and the UsA to discuss and explore ideas pertaining to satellite and slow scan. It featured a panel of leading artists and art critics including Bill Bartlett, David Ross, Gene Youngblood and Douglas Davis.  

The conference functioned as a live two-way video and audio international network, with information being presented on the applications of telecommunication technology in contemporary art.  

A different kind of computer teleconferencing experiment ['Terminal Art'] was organized by Roy Ascott in 1980. Dubbed \*Terminal Consciousness' by the media, it consisted of eight artists, one in England, one in Wales and six in America, provided with portable computer terminals in their studios linking them to each other and to a data bank in California.  

In January 1980, Kit Galloway and Sherry Rabinowicz presented Hole in Space, a communication sculpture connecting New York and Los Angeles. In both cities, monitors and cameras were installed in store front windows so that the crowds could communicate by image and voice. Each group saw only the opposite group, and because neither crowd could see itself there was little inhibition restraining participation. Without really thinking about it, the numerous participants were utilizing telecommunication via satellite and defining an artwork.  

The LexsSor was first presented as an artwork/concept in 1981 in New York City. Artist Steve s'Soreff, editor of Avant Garde Art Review magazine (AGAR) felt that the one problem both artists and philosophers must face is the relation between permanence and change.  

The LexsSor system transmits artists' books, page by page in colour. As easily as telephoning, LexsSor owners could dial any of the 9,500 artists' books in the Archive. The LexsSor receiver then permits the reader to peruse, skim, back-up or flip the page images at will by means of simple controls. The unit's 'turn-scan' inmage-changing system closely approximates normal page-turning visually.  

The LexsSor concept suggests the possibility that 'permanence' - the book - and change - telecommunications - can be merged.  

The future expansion of the concept would include all books in a central world archive, accessible anywhere at the press of a button.  

On 5 March 1982 a version of this concept was set up in conjunction with Tom Klinkowstein, an artist in Holland, using the Prestel International system. For one hour, requests for artists' books from guests at a celebration in the Hague appeared on a Prestel screen in New York. s'Soreff responded by feeding appropriate pages by American book artists into the system. Twoway, the system simultaneously transmitted Dutch book pages to New York on request.  

Klinkowstein is an American media artist and designer who spends six months a year living in Holland. He uses telefacsimile, computer terminals, television and telephones to create his art events and performances, and has been working with telecommunications media for the last four years. One of his more complex events, Levittown, was performed in April 1982 at the Cultural Centre Hoogt in Utrecht.  

The multimedia performance was beamed to the audience on four screens. One screen carried slow-scan images transmitted live from an American shopping centre built in the 1950s in Klinkowstein's home town, another displayed a list of contents of a 1950s suburban American home on a videotex monitor linked to a Prestel computer in London, where the artist had logged the information. A slowscan tape of a modern-day Dutch shopping mall played on a third screen, while the fourth carried slides and Super 8 flms of the artist's childhood. The performance was accompanied by hamburgers and french fries from McDonalds and the soundtrack consisted of Sousa marches by Klinkowstein's junior high school band.  

The satellite telecast performance Double Entendre, produced by Douglas Davis and based on the poststructuralist ideas of Roland Barthes, was performed in May 1981 between the Whitney Museum in New York and the Centre Georges Pompidou in Paris. The audience faced a 2 metre television projection screen. In the centre of the theatre at the Whitney, a mute woman represented Davis's female counterpart, who was onstage at the Centre Pompidou. In turn, the male counterpart was onstage opposite the female performer in Paris. Pre-recorded video sequences were also mixed into the live' performance and exchanged via satellite. Fragments of each version were later presented on limited access cable networksin eachcountry.  

Robert Adrian X is an artist who works in many different media, but he has been involved in telecommunications projects since 1978, including the 'Artists' Use of Telecommunications' conference in 1980. The success of this project encouraged him to approach Gottfried Bach at IP Sharp in Vienna to see if a cheap and simple electronic mailbox system could be developed. The outcome was Artbox, which now has a network of about 35 users worldwide, many of them representing artistsworkingwith telecommunications.  

On 16 June 1981, Surveillance, a television piece which showed images from the central surveillance room of the Vienna subway system, was broadcast live byAustria'ssecond national network.  

In 1982 Adrian X conceived and co-ordinated the ambitious project The World in 24 Hours' as part of the Ars Electronica biennale.  

This telecommunications programme by artists was, like other such events in the past, intended to develop techniques for individual, personal use of existing telecommunications technology.  

In a letter to the participants written in December 1982 two months after the event Adrian X had this to say: Telecommunications by artists or anybody only gets really exiting when carried out on a global scale. But the price is all the pain and problems of language and cultural differences, time zones, networking and night-working. On balance I think it is worth it ... looking through the material received, one can feel a new kind of art developing, a new medium.'  

My own experiments in Australia include ‘Telesky', the first visual telecommunications event to take place from Australia, which took the form of a simultaneous exchange of information in the area of sky art between artists at Paddington Town Hall, Sydney, and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, using slow-scan TV and voice via two telephone lines. I worked with artist Jan Birmingham and the public TV facility Metro Television and was assisted by a grant from the Visual Arts Board of the Australia Council. Then in September 1982 I co-ordinated the Sydney end of 'The World in 24 Hours'. Artists Mike Parr and lan Howard and students from the City Art Institute in Sydney exchanged images and text using telefacsimile and the Artbox computer mail facility.  

I have also worked with Tom Klinkowstein, who recently visited Australia, on the project Australia 2003', an exchange of telefax images which took place in April 1983 between students in Sydney, Adelaide and Perth on the theme of 'Australia in the Future'. In many ways, Australia is the ideal place in which to conduct these events. Not only is it remote from other parts of the world, but within Australia there are huge distances between major cities.  

It is often claimed that modern electronic systems and networks are not accessible to private individuals, but actually access is a relatively easy matter. The real problems only arise when one seeks ways in which these systems can be used.  

Electronic communications means that no actual object is exchanged. It is in the ephemeral immediacy of the exchange that the meaning of the work exists. Slow-scan TV, like mail art, is a sharing activity. It cannot be passively viewed like TV or video or a painting or a performance, it demands a reply ... a dialogue betweenproducers.  

Much of contemporary art has been moving away from the object. If the object is removed completely, then what is left are relationships between participants. An object is not necessary in order to benefit from the establishment of these relationships. Telecommunications art  involves the creation of relationships without the production of concrete artworks. Images and words are still necessary, of course, in order to communicate. However the material is communicated, accepted and responded to, and an audience may take away only memories of the event as their experience. Further work can then develop and flourish from the creation of these new relationships.  

It will have become apparent that some artists' works are tightly structured in order to communicate a particular message to a particular audience which has relatively little opportunity for interaction.  

On the other hand, Bill Bartlett and Bob Adrian, two artists with extensive experience in using telecommunications, feel that the traditional artist/audience relationship is strained by telecommunications to the point where it breaks down or destroys the project. Therefore they have developed forms in which the artist acts as catalyst or initiator, providing equipment and know-how but not determining the structure of the actual activity. They have agreed that this form of art is of a kind unknown outside of tribal societies, having neither artists nor an audience, and yet because of its range it may be more likely to disrupt or destroy local cultures than to help them.  

However, as Adrian X points out, regional culture is being destroyed by these systems anyway. It cannot be more harmful for the members of these cultures and societies to have a voicewith which to reply.  

Artists are traditionally strong in discovering new ways to use media and materials in inventing new and contradictory meanings for existing organisations and systems in subverting self-serving power-structures in the interests of nearly everyone. Artists using electronic telecommunications are trying to find human meaning in an electronic space.(The World in 24 Hours, 1982)

# Robert Adrian X The World in 24 Hours//1982  

This project connected artists in 16 cities on three continents for 24 hours - 12 noon on 27 September to 12 noon on 28 September 1982 (central European time) -asapart ofArs Electronica 1982.  

The project was conceived as an experiment in the use of easily accessible telecommunications media for the exchange of works by artists using the international telephone system. With three telephone lines available in Linz it was possible to send and receive using up to three media simultaneously, although one line was mostly in use for coordination, either directly or through the I.P. SharpTimesharing network.  

The media available were slow scan television, telefacsimile, computertimesharing and simply sound transmission. Most locations used more than one medium - some used all media simultaneously in multimedia works. Each location was called on the telephone from Linz - at or as near as possible to 12 noon local time - and invited to exchange works, improvisations, information, using whatever media at their disposal. Each contact was for about an hour to half an hour each way. All the exchanges took place individually between Linz and each location, except for those locations which had access to the I.P. Sharp timesharing network, on which a conference was open for the entire 24 hour period.

# Heath Bunting In Conversation with Sarah Cook//2003  

Heath Bunting I used to have an organization called Cyber Cafe. Cyber Cafés were things on street corners where you could check your hotmail, and the idea was that it was a meeting place somewhere on some network and it was mostly me, but it was open to let other people do things with it. I always tried to represent myself as an organization so that people would take me more seriously - or used to anyway. So that's how irrational it is. It's the group that I work with now, but originally it was just a kind of pseudonym for myself. I used to have an organization called Advertising Art as well in the 1980s.  

Anyway. this project is under the Cyber Café umbrella and it was a kind of unexpected result of another project that I was doing. I find with my work that I'm pursuing one thing that might take quite a lot of effort and then something else unexpected comes along, which is quite often better than what I had planned. So what I was trying to do was a sound disturbance for commuters in underground stations and railway stations, by using public telephones. This was before people had mobile phones. So I was logging all the numbers of the telephone boxes in these places and their location, and then did a script on the computer to dial them sequentially. Then I would go there as it was doing it, so it would be one phone ringing, and then five seconds in it would stop and another one would ring, and so on. I found a really good place at King's Cross Station in London, where there was a small room of about this size and it had about 32 public telephones.  

So it was a really nice enclosed space, and I had this idea to publish the numbers and get people to do something with them at a certain time. I had this feeling that there were quite a few people out there who knew how to make free phone calls, and who didn't have anything else to do other than call their friends, Or porn lines in the Caribbean. So I just posted this on the Net and it was scheduled to start at 6 o'clock, so 1 went there at 2 o'clock to check that there wasn't any police presence, or that the phones hadn't been disconnected, because people get paranoid about this. The phones were already ringing - not all of them, but some of them - just continuing to ring. There were members of the public who were already starting to answer them. The thing I liked was that there was a person from BT doing a survey on whether people had enjoyable telephone conversations (and this again was pre-mobile, so most of the people were ringing home saying, 'Hi honey, I'll be home in half-an-hour') and she was like, “What's gone wrong? All the phones have gone wrong today.: Anyway, I hung around, and then at 6 o'clock it just went mad! People came from all over the country just to be in this room. The phones were ring-ring-ringing, and if you picked one up it would be someone in Australia or someone standing next to you. It was quite a surprise to me that two cops were watching.  

Sarah Cook What did the cops do?  

Bunting They didn't care in the slightest. In the end the woman from BT was answering the phones and it was just like a telephone party.  

Cook How were you communicating with people? This was in 1994 so the Web wasn't as we think of it today, so when you say you posted it on the net...?  

Bunting Yes, the Web didn't even exist then.  

Cook So how did the list of phone numbers get out in that sense?  

Bunting I used to be very disciplined, determined to get email lists whenever I travelled. But first of all I started by going into the magazine shops in London and just noted down all the email addresses of all the galleries, the fax list of all the galleries in London and all the newspapers. Before this I used to programme the fax distribution system, because it was a computer in my cupboard that would answer my phone and receive a fax - then it would send them out automatically to everyone else on its list. But I had a list of 08o0 numbers that had fax machines on, so there were about a thousand all around the world. I didn't know where they came out but they were fax machines. So I had a lot of publicity mechanisms, but mostly the email and fax - and they were quite effective because there were not many other people doing things like that. There was no spam then. There were no pyramid or chain-letter schemes on the Net at all. I...]  

Did you want to see the database's back end? You're not supposed to see this - it's a secret! I like to think of my work in terms of phases - the first phase was electronic networking and what we would say was Cyber Cafe with faxes and telephones, and then the Internet took off and there was a huge eruption of interest and production, and it was all very formal. I was involved in seeing a very formal discussion about the Net itself. Then that all fell apart and I moved on to more physical-based networking - things that are already all around us, like roads or tracks or ways.[...]  

So this is a guide to crossing all the borders in Europe without papers or passports. This came about because I was always quite irritated when I travelled, being told what to do by men with guns. So I resented having to carry this documentation, because at that stage I was travelling all the time and travelling very light. So I intended to do this project for several years. Then the opportunity arose and I had some time - and also a friend of mine, a Serbian woman, wanted to go from Spain to France, and we just decided to cross the border illegally, not at a checkpoint. We were a bit worried but were aiso feeling a bit brave, and it ended up that we had nothing to worry about at all. So this is the first border crossing that I was involved in. We had a map, and the map was wrong. We ended up going through all these brambles and forests, ending up getting scratched. Then we got to the border, which is actually quite pronounced physically, even though it's not supposed to be. So on the left you can see Spain and on the right you can see France. Then there's a piece of wire. So I then decided to do all the borders in Europe and just think about the actual physical process of crossing the borders and seeing what was around the borders. I wanted to do a survey of borders - which ones were open, which were closed, and whether they were easy to cross. Basically, in Europe you're not supposed to require papers to travel within Europe, but the borders are still regularly closed. For instance this border was closed six months afterwards, because there was a demonstration in Barcelona. So all the checkpoints were closed, and this would be one of the very few ways you could get across from France to Spain if you were looking for an alternative route.  

![images/5a146fa48555bcc81df8df406ed39e968390d0895d7648c119dd98cf34e95646.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/1YHYBA8.jpeg)  

So we crossed all the borders. I did a route plan - I like route planning and calculating easiest routes from one country to another - and we graded each route. Some were easy and pleasant, others were a bit harder. I... I Then I had this idea that I wanted to cross from France to the UK through the Channel Tunnel, which was possible because people do it every day - the asylum seekers do it. This is the border between France and England. So it was my intention to go the other way, to go from England to France, and in the end I was in a position to do it but never did. It never seemed quite right politically, because people were dying on this border. It didn't seem right for me to make fun out of it just as a gesture. I just never felt I had the right thing to say about it.  

The other part of the project is that it is only available at certain places. So instead of the way that globalism is working at the moment, that human beings are restricted in the movement of information and money and capital flows freely, I tried to erase this by restricting the information and encouraging people to travel to places where you could access the work. For instance, places like universities or social centres have access to the work - or whole countries have access to the work -- but you probably won't be able to see it from home. This is also a response to the fact that it was funded by the Tate and I sensed that there were pressures to turn it into a coffee table project - just for entertainment - and I meant it to be a bit more serious piece of research. This kind of disrupted their intent, which was a major conflict in the end. So instead of the content, it was access, which generated the publicity, that caused a fracture between myself and the commissioner. I...!

# Armin Medosch The Economy of Art in the Information Age//1998  

[One] accident of modernity was to exclude art from being a form of gathering 'real knowledge'. Science gained the monopoly over meaning and truth. In as much as the balance between these disciplines needs to be restored, artists also need to lose their 'outsider' status and be regarded as part of 'normal society. Artists are members of its elite - specialists for manipulating symbols - which, payment aside, is not so different from being a lawyer, a journalist, a researcher or a marketing specialist. But the undervaluing of art in society is, unfortunately, partly a result of the behaviour of artists themselves.  

Since attempts during the 1960s to replace individualistic notions of artistic genius with those of artist as cultural worker, we have seen a return to art business as usual. In this condition the artist is a nineteenth-century figure. Artists stress their individuality' and ‘otherness' in order to be interesting to potential buyers or commissioners and become a name-artist accumulating Symboliccapital.  

This obsolete notion of the artist as individualistic outsider harms artists working with new media tools particularly, because it hinders necessary forms of teamwork between specialists (coding specialist, conceptual specialist, visual specialist...).  

Now, in a consumer driven economy, products depend on being 'hip'. How to achieve hipness is as mysterious as why an artist becomes a 'name'. It is a result of 'soft warfare' in discursive and symbolic reality. Distributive power, but also the skills of imaging are essential.  

Therefore, 'Digital Artisans' - the people with computer skills and creative skills who are actually creating the images, websites, CD-ROMS and games - are playing an increasinglyimportant role. The‘artists as hypermedia surface wizards' are helping to blur the boundaries between art and advertisement. Their ability to do so is what makes them interesting to their corporate commissioners.  

'New Media Art' generally carries the burden of promoting, voluntarily or not, new technologies. Artists have contributed to the degradation of their own discipline by all too often concentrating on the novelty factor of technologies (Netscape.Artists, Macromedia.Artists). High-Tech gadgetry and popularized new scientific metaphors (Artificial Life, Complexity Theory) often cover the lack of anyreal social dimension.  

The institutional  situation is compromising  itself by rewarding lazy conceptualism.  

Institutions meant to support the creation of new artworks often have to focus too much on creating spectacular events in order to be attractive for their sponsors.  

Whereas in the past artists often became technologically creative and invented their own tools, nowadays they seem to be happy to use any new tool which is force-fed to them by an ever more rapid technological development in the commercial technology sector.[...]  

I have tried to describe links between art and business, not to present all of them as intrinsically evil, but rather as a reality we have to acknowledge in order to see who is doing what, who gets the benefits, how the creation of values is structured in the 'information age'.  

Viewed in this light, the overall legal and institutional situation of a country (for example the legal position on intellectual property rights) is often more important than those technological aspects which catch our attention all too easily.  

Art is widely considered a luxury rather than a social necessity, which results in the low renumeration of most artists. Instead, we should try to understand how cultural objects, of whatever character or materiality, can be produced and distributed to the best advantage of society and the artists/producers.

# Arthur and Marilouise Kroker Hacking the Xerox Alphabet//1996  

During a tour of Xerox Parc in Palo Alto, California, I am introduced to the inventor of Xerox's entry into the magic realist contest for a new cyber-alphabet for the third millennium. In actual workplace use, Notepad computers involve heads-up scanning (restaurant orders, taking warehouse inventories) and require easy character recognition of data entries for their just-to-the-minute use. The old twenty-six letter alphabet, with its problems of character recognition and messy scribbling (that all the optical scanners in the cyber-world can't read) just won't cut the digital grade. Not to worry. The young Xerox hacker, intense and digitally exuberant, perfectly befitting the founder of the Virtual Gutenberg Galaxy, had just invented a new easy to use and even easier to learn graphics-based alphabet forNotepad culture.  

Our tour guide enthusiastically chirped in that ten minutes is all it takes to master the new cyber-symbols. A quick learning curve for post-alphabet society. Stunned by this missionary display of technological hubris, I remembered the fate of the Japanese written language when it was discovered that all the characters in the Japanese vocabularly couldn't be made to fit the computer keyboard. The solution was obvious: dump half the characters of the Japanese language and go for a leaner, meaner, digitally powered-up Japan. Probably noticing my slight hesitation before I bent my knee to the rising sun of the Virtual Word, the Xerox hacker said: Hey, if you don't like this alphabet, come back this afternoon. I've almost finished a second virtual alphabet.

# Alessandro Ludovico Consume without a Screen//2011  

Since the arrival of electronic media, visionaries have speculated on ways to expand our physiological reading limits beyond the constraints of print, in order to absorb, through a sort of cultural osmosis, huge quantities of information in a fraction of time. They foresaw what we now call digital technology, though originally imagined as much more powerful than today's fare and often involving the body as primary interface. In line with their predictions, since the early 1990s we've expanded reading space almost ad infinitum through global networks of hypertexts. Now we're back again, considering the book the perfectly sized medium with a universal 'interface'. In fact, after twenty years of re-inventing the wheel, through multiple and unnatural combinations of icons, graphics and animations, contemporary e-reading interfaces resemble the most effective one yet:print.  

Our desire for rich digital content on the go has yielded varieties of fast, precise tools that digitize print at will. We have more software options to make online text (often lost in graphical enhancements and ads) that look and feel like paper. Attempts to incorporate 'digital' elements in print have also generated various hybrids, such as POD (print-on-demand) files that can be updated every second. Digital and print, while two different worlds, are in no way mutually exclusive: they attract, repulse and sometimes complement each other. Nevertheless our senses are still not trained for hypertexts and hybrids. Lost in too much information, we are distracted by the ability to search ad infinitum, floating in a limbo of minimal concentration. The finite space of a book becomes reassuring, with its limits, its focus on unlinkable topics.  

If the digital expands our possibilities and access to content, print is still the preferred medium for preservation. The 'convergence' of different media into a paradise ruled by some omnipotent digital god resounds once more like empty propaganda. The ruling classic interfaces operate alongside digitally specific platforms in a desperate attempt to establish a digital standard for print, as was accomplished for music and video. Once established, this standard will likely escalate our taste for and consumption of editorial products, with unpredictable social consequences. But print will not disappear. On the contrary, whether cheap last-minute up-to-date print-outs or more expensive limited editions, the printed medium is simply mutating as a physically enjoyable form and a future luxury: consume without a screen.

# McKenzie Wark A Hacker Manifesto//2004  

Information wants to be free but is everywhere in chains.  

Information is immaterial, but never exists without a material support. Information may be transferred from one material support to other, but cannot be dematerialized - other than in the more occult of vectoralist ideologies. Information emerges as a concept when it achieves an abstract relation to materiality. This abstracting of information from any particular material support creates the very possibility of a vectoral society, and produces the new terrain of class conflict - the conflict between the vectoralist and hacker classes.  

Information expresses the potential of potential. When unfettered, it releases the latent capacities of all things and people, objects and subjects. Information is the plane upon which objects and subjects come into existence as such. It is the plane upon which the potential for the existence of new objects and subjects may be posited. It is where virtuality comes to the surface.  

The potential of potential that information expresses has its dangers. But its enslavement to the interests of the vectoral class poses greater dangers still. When information is free, it is free to act as a resource for the averting of its own dangerous potentials. When information is not free, then the class that owns or controls it turns its capacity toward its own interest and away from information's own inherent virtuality.  

Information exceeds communication. Deleuze: 'We do not lack communication. On the contrary, we have too much of it. We lack creation. We lack resistance to the present.' Information is at once this resistance, and what it resists - its own dead form, communication. Information is both repetition and difference. Information is representation, in which difference is the limit to repetition. But information is also expression, in which difference exceeds repetition. The hack turns repetition into difference, representation into expression, communication into information. Property turns difference into repetition, freezing free production and distributing it as a representation. Property, as representation, fettersinformation.  

The enabling conditions for freedom of information do not stop at the ‘free' market, no matter what the apologists for the vectoral class may say. Free information is not a product, but a condition of the effective allocation of resources. The multiplicity of public and gift economies, a plurality of forms - keeping open the property question - is what makes free information possible.  

The commodification of information means the enslavement of the world to the interests of those whose margins depend on information's scarcity, the vectoral class. The many potential benefits of free information are subordinated to the exclusive benefits in the margin. The infinite virtuality of the future is subordinated to the production and representation of futures that are repetitions ofthesamecommodityform.  

The subordination of information to the repetition of communication means the enslavement of its producers to the interests of its owners. It is the hacker class that taps the virtuality of information, but it is the vectoralist class that owns and controls the means of production of information on an industrial scale. Their interests lie in extracting as much margin as possible from information, in comimodifying it to the nth degree. Information that exists solely as private property is no longer free, for it is chained to the repetition of the property form.  

The interests of hackers are not always totally opposed to those of the vectoral class. There are compromises to be struck between the free flow of information and extracting a flow of revenue to fund its further development. But while information remains subordinated to ownership, it is not possible for its producers to freely calculate their interests, or to discover what the true freedom of information might potentially produce in the world. The stronger the hacker class alliance with the other producing classes, the less it has to answer the vectoralistimperative.  

Information may want to be free, but it is not possible to know the limits or potentials of its freedom when the virtual is subordinated to this actual state of ownership and scarcity. Privatizing information and knowledge as commodified 'content' distorts and deforms its free development, and prevents the very concept of its freedom from its own free development. 'As our economy becomes increasingly dependent on information, our traditional system of property rights applied to information becomes a costly fetter on our development.2  

The subordination of hackers to the vectoralist interest means the enslavement not only of the whole of human potential, but also natural potential. While information is chained to the interests of its owners, it is not just hackers who may not know their interests, no class may know what it may become.  

Information in itseif is mere possibility. It requires an active capacity to become productive. But where knowledge is dominated by the education of the ruling classes, it produces the capacity to use information for the purposes of producing and consuming within the limits of the commodity. This produces a mounting desire for information that meets the apparent lack of meaning and purpose in life. The vectoralist class fills this need with communication that offers these desires a mere representation and objectification of possibility.  

For everyone to become free to join in the virtuality of knowledge, information and the capacity to grasp it must be free also, so that all classes may have the potential to hack for themselves and their kind a new way of life. The condition for this liberation is the abolition of a class rule that imposes scarcity on knowledge, and indeed on virtuality itself.  

Free information must be free in all its aspects - as a stock, as a flow and as a vector. The stock of information is the raw material out of which history is abstracted. The flow of information is the raw material out of which the present is abstracted, a present that forms the horizon that the abstract line of an historical knowledge crosses, indicating a future in its sights. Neither stocks nor flows of information exist without vectors along which they may be actualized. Even so, it is not enough that these elements are brought together as a representation that may then be shared freely. The spatial and temporal axes of free information must do more than offer a representation of things, as a thing apart. They must become the means of coordination of the expression of a movement capable of connecting the objective representation of things to the presentation of a subjective action.  

Information, when it is truly free, is free not for the purpose of representing the world perfectly, but for expressing its difference from what is, and for expressing the cooperative force that transforms what is into what may be. The sign of a free world is not the liberty to consume information, or to produce it, nor even to implement its potential in private worlds of one's choosing. The sign of a free world is the liberty for the collective transformation of the world through abstractions freely chosen and freely actualized.  

# James Bridle On Wikipedia, Cultural Patrimony and Historiography//2010  

Today I was going to talk about history and culture and memory and preservation, just little things, like that. It's weird for me to talk about these things for one quite strong reason, which is that I grew up in a place that doesn't exist anymore. It's been erased; it's gone; the map is empty; the access roads are closed off; there is no way you can reach this place anymore. I don't have any souvenirs of it, I don't have aides-memoires; I don't have my own photographs; I don't have a Proustian madeleine to take me back to re-experience this place. It's gone and it's very weird when those things aren't there, because we encode our memories of things in objects and places, and when we lose those objects and places, we lose the thread of that memory, but we can't follow it back to ourselves. The whole thing comes apart. There was an effort to record this place, but it was partial. It missed out a lot. The people who did it, they were not citizens. They did not understand. They missed the cul-de-sacs and the interiors. They missed the suburbs, the places where real life happened, in particular adolescence, the locations of your first social and sexual experiences.  

This is a traumatic event.  

I grew up in GeoCities.  

It's true. It's gone. GeoCities had 28 million individual user pages. It had 30 odd neighbourhoods. They were all specialized and important. There was Heartland, which was for families and parents. There was a Rodeo Drive for shopping. There was Nashville for country music. There was West Hollywood for the lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender community, which alone had 28,400 sites. These were important places, where things happened and where they can't happen any longer. They are lost to us. And in losing them we lose something quite worrying. What is worrying is that we don't think about their loss too much and we particularly don't think about that loss when we are making the decision to lose it. We don't think enough about that.  

There were, as I said, efforts - to do this, save aspects of that - but they were partial. The Internet archive's Wayback Machine led this effort. It was a fantastic effort and it was the right thing to do. The Wayback Machine in itself is a wonderful thing. It gives us something that we have rarely in digital culture, which is a sense of history, a sense of memory. The Wayback Machine has been archiving the Web since 1996, which is, you know, forever. A couple of years ago they recovered about three petabytes of data, which is a lot. They take a complete snapshot of the Web that they know about (which is a very different thing from the entire Web) every two months. That adds another three or so terabytes of data to this whole thing. [.]  

These things are stored in this great flat infrastructure, which makes it very hard to compare and contrast and draw out, not narratives but at least a sense of change across these things. It makes it hard to notice when we lose things. We don't notice until well after. This worries me a lot. Historically the kind of storage and archiving that is available to all of us right now was only available to very rich elites. And they also had different technologies to store it. I'm not nostalgic for those technologies, because those technologies were pretty rubbish and they used to lose stuff all the time. But now we all have that problem; we all have to think about this. ...]  

So I'll lighten up and talk about Wikipedia. And there's a reason why I want to talk about Wikipedia, obviously, several reasons, because we can't stop those cultural destructions happening. We've tried, we keep trying and will always keep trying, and it's a good thing to keep trying, but it's also important to understand the process behind them. Why I think Wikipedia is one particularly interesting example of this is because it is not only a structure for encoding the whole of human knowledge but a framework for understanding what that knowledge is, how it is created. It is a real exemplar for human thought processes: how we build history, how we construct it amongst ourselves. And it is this process that I think is absolutely central for us to understand, the most important thing we can do. As well as to try to remember all this stuff, we have to understand theprocessbehind it.  

I use Wikipedia not just because it is awesome in and of itself, but because for me Wikipedia is a subset of the Internet and a good example of that, and it is in that way a subset for all human knowledge. You can generalize from these kinds of lessons to understand our entire knowledge and culture. One thing about Wikipedia is this four-dimensional structure that it has. The first dimension is just the page. The second dimension is that all these pages are linked together into this encyclopaedia. You have a third dimension which is the links between all these things, you reference everything, and everything can be connected and intertwined. But the best thing about it, the absolute best, is this fourth dimension, like in our universe, which is time.  

Wikipedia stretches back into history and we can see this process happening. Have you ever clicked on the history tab? Then you can go back and see what's been happening throughout history. How we've created this story. How we solidify the facts that we talk about. I...]  

When you start looking-at wiki stuff for a while, it becomes really pervasive. You start seeing basically everything as a wiki. Cities in particular fascinate me, all these augmented reality apps we're getting now, layering over old photos of the city. [...] We're only a couple of reversions off the eighteenth century! [...] Everything should have a history button, we should always be able to look back and explore it. But what I'm really talking about here is not history, but historiography. And historiography is the process of writing about the process and creation of history. How we understand what we are really talking about and how we recognize the concepts that we are dealing with and the scale of things. [..]  

We are building this incredible vast, huge system of knowledge and storage, and yet we don't understand that there's always a reason to preserve something. There is always a history to everything; there is always an importance in that to somebody. I think it's the greatest challenge of our time, that we learn to understand this, and identify that atemporality, that endless digital now; that flatness is not the way the world is. We don't at the moment design much that takes into account history and a multiplicity of histories. [...]  

So this is the history of a single article [on Wikipedia]. I wanted to think of a way to show that a single piece of information has this incredible long history. And so I printed it out. This is the history of the Wikipedia article on the Iraq war. It is twelve volumes, 10,000 pages and over 12,000 edits. Every single edit and reversion has happened on this whole article. It's pages and pages of arguments over numbers. You can see the process of history being constructed, the gradual accretion of knowledge and understanding. A consensus that comes together, whether that is true or false, but this consensus is slowly built over time. There are endless arguments over what constitutes history and what constitutes importance. Every now and again someone wipes it all out and says Saddam Hussein is a dickhead. It gets reverted. This is important. This is what history really looks like; this is what culture looks like. This is the process we have to go through to understand history.  

Historiography is everything that happens to us, and I want to leave with the thought that we need to make that more evident and more part of our thoughts in everything we do as we build this immense, huge system of knowledge. We need to make sure that everything is given value, everything is given history and we save it in versions and understanding. There have been a lot of massive numbers today, a kind of big deluge of information. The deluge of information has always been there; we always had all this information. We are starting to save it and understand it now. And even if we don't understand it, we can at least build representations of it; and even if we don't understand the numbers, we can understand that these numbers exist, and that they are huge, and that they define us, and maybe we can change a little our understanding of the world.  

# Suhail Malik Information and Knowledge//2005  

[A]   point made by  Jean-Francois  Lyotard among  others  is  that  the instrumentalization of knowledge transforms it into information. The difference to be highlighted here is between the characterization of information as such and, on the other hand, knowledge's instrumentalization as information. What is left begging between these two determinations of how information and knowledge relate to one another is whether information is per force an instrumental category. If it is, then the nuance brought to light here collapses and the argument about knowledge has no special place: whatever becomes determined as information becomes instrumentalized and the fate of knowledge is only one such case. However, it seems that there is a stronger connection between knowledge and information than this: specifically, information displaces, if it does not replace, knowledge in the new channels and structures stipulated by technoscientific and contemporary capitalistic determinations. Correlatively, epistemological concerns are displaced, if not replaced, by material-systematic ones. This is, for example, a central contention of Scott Lash's Critique of Information (2002) in the description of the collapse of the temporal, spatial or logical conditions for reflection (allied with knowledge) as condition of critique in'information societies'.  

The transmuted identity of knowledge and information can be contested, however. A hesitation about their relation allows for the otherwise intimate knot between these terms to be loosened. With that, some leverage can be had on the question of whether knowledge is in fact, operation, or concept instrumentally displaced by information, or even how the relation and movement from one to the other - if there is such a movement - is to be understood. To be clearer about this, a more precise characterization of information is needed. This is notoriously difficult given the variety of ways the term is understood and operates: as an embodied and material cause (in some genetics), as a signal with a transmissibie quotient without determinate location or material/embodied specificity (in cyber-theory),as a statistical quantitative property of a system(incommunication theory), as an instruction. The divergence in what information means or even is marks it out as an inconsistent category. But it is not incoherent: each of these determinations of information proposes a rationalization of the system in question into (usually linearly organized) channels of control and transmission. In particular, the uncontroversial notion of information as an instruction - with all its implied connotations of programme, design, rule-following, coding, command, and so on - seems to lead directly to its characterization as a type of instrumental rationality, both in its theory and practically. If so, then information is at once an instrumental category and the question of its transformation of knowledgeissettled.  

Staying at that level of analysis, together with the common theoretical political positioning and condemnation of instrumental rationality that attends such conclusions, however, foregoes further investigation of what is occasioned within such determinations of system 'operationalities'. That is, certain critical positions are quickly consolidated at this point without further consideration of what something like ‘instrumentality' actually amounts to. [The ensuing discussion not included in this excerpt] takes up various characterizations of information across a number of disciplines in order to comprehend the effects of such an instrumentalization (if it is one). By examining arguments in theoretical biology, developmental systems and social theory, the initial stage of the argument establishes that information is a situated event, an event that takes place in a mnemically organized system which, following an argument from developmental biology, is then seen to be epigenetically constituted. This determination provides a basis for a critique of the dominant statisticalquantitative model of information in the physical and mathematically developed sciences, notably as information theory. Dispensing with this model as the primary reference for comprehending information, the argument then turns to various arguments about and in response to ‘information societies'. These societies are precisely those which Lyotard addresses in the comments remarked upon above: societies in which information takes a leading role in (de)structuring their economies, knowledges and cultures. As well as Lash's concerns with the reorganization of the spatiotemporal constitution and circulation of knowledge, rationality and (in a general sense) intelligence in such societies, Paul Virilio's argument that information societies are societies of the general accident and Bernard Stiegler's investigation of human (social) genesis through what he calls an “instrumental maieutic' are also examined in view of this general characterization of information. These illustrations accumulate to demonstrate again that meaning is epigenetically constituted - but this time at social and anthropic levels. The last stage of the argument proposes a continuity between this register and the organic epigenesis discussed earlier. This continuity is not that of a staged evolution but the process of information's epigenetic constitution and mutations of (bio)material, symbolic and social meanings and systems.  

It is perhaps worth emphasizing in advance that what is developed and then deployed through these diverse registers is a general characterization or theory of information. Such a theory is, on the one hand, required, if the term is not to collapse into the each time specific determinations of the disciplines in which it is deployed; if, that is, the concept of information is not to be undone by its disciplinary manifestations. And it is precisely this concept of information and its consequences that this article seeks to establish. On the other hand, working towards this level of conceptual generality and consistency (for the general sense of ‘situatedness', for example) requires an abstraction from precisely the disciplinary and empirically specific characterizations of information and the constellation of terms that it carries with it. So, though the characterization of information as an event that is situated in a system with an organized memory is developed by moving between the biological and social determinations of information, this general characterization does not, however, mean that organic memory and social memory (or personal memory for that matter) are the same thing or are unproblematically identifiable, or that what information is, in fact, is the same thing in every instance. In fact, the argument here suggests that it cannot be, since what and how the mnemic organization is for each developmental system is, precisely, different and particular. The concern here is not then to specify what, for example, the mnemic organization is, and so what the specificity or actuality of information is, in every case. For all that, such specificity is observed in the later section on information societies, since what is being constructed here through the examples considered is an understanding of the centrality of information, not just in the formation of certain kinds of society, but, more intrinsically, as a condition for the constitution of complex societies at all.  

What appears through these arguments is that rather than being the reduction of knowledge, information involves a complexification of meaning and systems, a complexification that can now be attributed to the operation of information with some specificity. In particular, there is a reversal of the conventional critical attributions noted above: it is not that information is the latest or only a particular mode of instrumentalization (of knowledge, say) but rather that instrumentality is a particular stratum of informatic operationality, one that determines and is determined in an anthropotechnical complex (and which therefore precedes consciousness as the condition for knowledge in its anthropically derived sense). The received critique of instrumentality is thus seen to be a disavowal of this complex mnemic organization that is central to the development of all orders of living systems and societies; central, that is, to production from pre-cellular-organic to post-industrial levels. [...]  

# Friedrich Kittler In Conversation with Sarah Cook//2000  

Sarah Cook You've written a lot about the idea of storage and the difference between technologies that merely store and technologies that can transmit, receive and also manipulate. But I wonder if certain types of storage, certain archives, are not themselves manipulative? There are some artworks on the Internet like that. How do you see the Internet in relation to this idea of storage and transmission and manipulation?  

Friedrich Kittler I...] [F]or a long time, we had the mistaken impression that storage does count and transmission doesn't count as being art for the people. We didn't believe in transmission. It reminded us too much of our scientific forerunners, who all stressed social transmission from above to below: from bourgeois writers to social conflicts, and so on. Then we looked for our own concept of transmission, and younger people working close to me discovered things such as the relation between the German literary system in the last three centuries and different German mail or post systems, or how closely Kafka worked with letters to his fiancee, and so forth. Transmission and storage. From this moment on it was difficult to disentangle this field. But sure, additional media theory had such a narrow concept of media that storage still remained much more important for them and for the general discussion, and transmission was just neglected. So we changed our minds, and looked for every transmission, from telegraphs to telephones and radio and TV emissions, and finally the Internet. This is where all this distinction between storage, transmission and manipulation, and arithmetical manipulation, coincides. And then we got into another - I wouldn't say trap, but it was risky - another risk; it showed up that storage media, at least in our past, are quite civic, civilian, friendly: it's the media of priests, scholars ...  

Cook ... and curators..  

Kittler Yes, and museums ... And transmission media are, in the last 5o0 years at least; no, in the last 5,000 years, are war. Have been war. And will be war for manyyearstocome.  

Cook So what do you think of museums trying to collect and preserve this transmission media, of the ZKM in an old ammunitions factory in Karlsruhe for example? Of media art curators and their attempts to try and preserve and collect the art made using transmission media, and what that means?  

Kittler [leaning in] Dear microphone, all things which can be known, all things that have arrived, and that's to say, have gone again (I mean history) we can know in so far as you, in your function and your job, store what has gone. And all that has gone has nevertheless been given, maintained or saved by chance or by intent, and so on. I look into historic times and epochs and make up my own mind. But the real question is what we have to do tomorrow or today, this very day. I think freedom means to dance in chance, as Nietzsche had it, and freedom is now and every past is a chain. Not every past, but also every other culture which is contemporary to us.  

Cook You indicated in your essay about hardware a need to create a legacy of the university postal system that you mentioned earlier. You can see today that it was important to maintain the history of the system and that it made evident the difficulty with new media of a technology's ability to store and transmit. But how do you maintain a transmission, how do you store the transmission?  

Kittler You have to because nobody else does it. I have an acquaintance who is in the most important American university for this kind of question (Stanford) and who is responsible for the history of software. Every software company, as soon as something has become obsolete, gives all the blueprints to him and his department, that is to say, to his archive. He is lucky. He is building up a fascinating science, despite his colleagues the historians, who can't understand why things just twenty years old are already historic things. But you and I understand the significanceof it.  

Now comes the real problem: why did companies like Hewlett Packard (which started the whole giving, the whole sponsoring of this new science) decide to do this? It wasn't a narcissistic gift, a silly gift. Maybe old dying Packard had understood, as nobody else had, that so many interesting software and hardware solutions are on their way to obsolescence, to disappear, and how could we allow that some kind of knowledge, active in some given time, should be dead twenty years later? This is good and I think my colleague doesn't see it. For him it is just toys to play around with, and I really feel that if and when we give over every infrastructure in the world by which and from which we live and die to computers - whose internal functioning nobody knows anymore - we're taking a risk! That's why we have to store what is in fact only transmission and only numerical mathematization.I...]  

# Muntadas  

In Conversation with Gianfranco Mantegna//1992  

Gianfranco Mantegna When you speak of 'media landscape, what do you mean?  

Muntadas By 'media landscape' I refer to another domain, beyond the one already cvident or defined as a landscape such as what we see outside a window, and/or beyond the historical representation of what landscape is. I define as 'media landscape' what is presented to us by the media. We saw it clearly during the Gulf War - a war that became two wars: the war that really took place and the one on TV, the war of the media. It is the mechanism of communication systems, which are based on information and disinformation, to establish other kinds of systems. In 1979 I spoke of 'invisible mechanisms', pointing out that all artistic activities have been based on representational systems that try to give visible form to various discourses or personal perceptions. Such systems include drawing, painting, sculpture, etc. The spectrum of themes these systems represent ranges from the representation of reality to that of the phenomena of irreality; from hard reality to mythic fiction; from the political pamphlet to hallucination. These traditional visible systems and techniques have been joined by other systems that have grown out of recent technical developments in world media. Media which appear physically as neutral carriers of pure discourse are manipulated by invisible systems.  

Within the context of political struggle, both dominant groups and those in opposition articulate and disseminate information through their understanding and manipulation of these invisible mechanisms. The retention of power depends on the 'seduction of the masses'. Various media strategies, subliminal techniques, etc., are the 'perfume and flowers' of this seduction. Via media campaigns, posters, radio and television, power is enforced not so much by the gun as by sound and image. The way we read this information and the extent to which we are conscious of its persuasive powers has to do with our subjective and objective processing of the information as we encounter it. The nature and volume of the transmission, and of our reception, along with our cultural, historical and space/time conceptions affect our determination of the character of the message.  

To return to 'media landscapes', there is a split of reality between the two landscapes, the 'natural' and the 'artificial landscape. Today, in a certain sense, they are both real. The landscape controlled and simulated by the media is for many reality itself.  

This idea began in the 1980s with works aimed at the examination of a specific situation, such as Exposicion or The Board Room, in which the function of the gallery is used as an archetype. In institutions and corporations the board room exists as a situation, it is an essential element, not only of the architecture, but also of the metabolism of the place, public and private: a space for decisions, strategies and mysteries. The stadium and the museum, two of the archetypes of the city, work as urban logotypes for two kinds of spectacle. In these works there is a relationship; all is related with something that exists; they are concepts, situations existing in reality. Upon this I construct a metaphor. It is borne out of the relationship between the work I show and the existing situation: the home, with its function between necessity and fantasy, or the stadium, where the public is the consumer of the spectacle but, at the same time, is consumed by it.  

These are situations where extremes are manifest - extremes and paradoxes. All is not as it appears. The interest of the work is to find what there is between those extremes, the particular aspects of the situation. When I speak about complexity, I mean elements that can be understood through history, social sciences or political-economic situations, that generate the complexity of the archetype. I have presented Stadium in seven different cities and it was different each time; for instance, what the stadium in Berlin represents historically in the 1930s versus the stadium in England, within the contemporary sociological phenomenon of hooliganism.  

This series of installations, beginning with Exposicion, does not concern only the site, but also the function, the use of the space, in that case a gallery. The same is true also for the following work, Cuarto De Fundo, which addresses the specific situation of the office, storage and back room activities of the gallery. Other recent works, such as The Limousine Project, The Forum or Words are defined by the colloquial stereotype of an architectonic construction: a board room, the stadium, the home, a limousine, the press conference room.  

Mantegna Have  you  ever  considered the  problem  of  specific  language experimentation within the medium you choose? What kind of relationship do you havewithnewtechnologies?  

Muntadas I believe that the characteristic of each project determines the medium. I have worked in a variety of media, using for each project the one I consider the most adequate. The work of the latest years has a relationship with contemporary phenomena: observation, dissection, commentary, intervention ... Some new technologies have certainly a relation to the subject and concept ! am addressing in the project. I think it is logical to use video if I am talking about television. Finally, the combination of media partially creates the ‘narrative' or language'Iam addressing with the work.[...  

Mantegna Can you say something about the nature of art as communication, spectacle, and at the same time political message for the masses, underscored by your operation on all the topoi of mass communication, from tourism to advertisement?  

Muntadas I believe that art is both perception and information. A way to be \*'touched' and a 'way to learn', both by the recipients and the emanators. The work is not a formula: it's not a percentage of this and a percentage of that, but a variable for each single case, person or situation.Finally, the spectator'completes' the work. We have always to confront the dilemma of the audience, both in what I have called 'protected' spaces and in the heterogeneity of the street. It seems to me that in the last few years more and more works have been offered for protected spaces, that is, for a specialized public, meaning the market. In the street, public art has its laws and rules. It would be interesting to see the same work in different spaces; just the difference between 'inside' and 'outside' could be enough.  

In my most recent work, the ideas refer to that which exists in reality. I do not invent the subject, I build a metaphor that emphasizes certain aspects that I believe the work should address. I believe anybody can understand them because they are issues that surround and concern us: media, religion, economics, architecture. [...]  

# Benjamin Weil Muntadas: On Translation:The Internet Project//2002  

On Translation: the Internet Project (often referred to as OTTIP)) explores three functions in three interrelated dimensions of the translation process, three analytical layers that somewhat typify Muntadas' working process.  

The first dimension documents the three earlier iterations of On Translation, thus presenting a conceptual grounding for the new instalment of the work, while reflecting upon the notion of documentation as a process of translation in itself: with this part, Muntadas was interested in tracing the perceptual shifts generated by the transposition into a new medium.  

The second component attempted to use the network for its capacity to transmit information in an almost instantaneous fashion: it was set to observe the way meaning gets distorted through the translating process, by offering a real-time examination of the shift in meaning. A chain of 22 translators, disseminated around the world, and each representing one of the 22 most spoken languages on the planet, translated a sentence, posted it to the website, and passed it on to the next translator. Once the cycle was completed, the sentencewasprocessed a second time.  

The third part of this work reflects upon the false assumptions made about the network, in the development of the translation 'engine': indeed while OTTIP was being conceived, Muntadas assumed it would be possible to use email in order to transmit the ongoing translation of the original sentence, and automatically post it to a Web interface. However, because computers function with different character sets that are not compatible, it was impossible, for instance, to read a message written in Japanese on a computer set to function with the Roman alphabet. Equally impossible was posting onto the server messages in any non-Roman characters, including Arabic, Cyrillic, Chinese, and others .. This resulted in having to revert to manual posting of messages sent via 'analogue' means of communication (i.e. the fax machine); messages were then scanned and posted on the website, as opposed to being posted in real time thanks to an automated system. This backstage' dimension of the site also served as a repository for source materials related to the translation process, including all the related correspondence, as well as reflections on the automation of such process. It was at about the same time such software as Babelfish was used in websites such as AltaVista, to enable the immediate - yet somewhat approximate translation of Web pages. Texts, and links to other reference material, also included a mechanism that enabled visitors to add to the database.  

The OTTIP project consisted of the creation of a Web page for Documenta X, which followed the process of translation of a single phrase from one language to another, up to a total of 23 languages in the course of the artistic event. The phrase 'Communication systems provide an opportunity to develop greater understanding between people: in what language?', originally in English - the standard language of exchange and publication on the Internet - was subjected to a chain of translations done by different professional translators. The plentiful documentation and correspondence generated over the period of the project, which was co-produced by Documenta 10, Adaweb and the Goethe-Institut, can be consulted on the Internet.  

Using the children's game 'Chinese whispers' - known in other latitudes as ‘telefono', “il telefono senza fili,‘Stille Post',‘el telefono descumpuesto' or 'el joc dels disbarats'- as a metaphor,OTrIP looked at the difficulty involved in distributing information on the net, as well as its errors and metamorphoses, its mutations,illegibilities and losses of meaning.  

The work aimed to show the problems instrinsic to any process of cultural understanding from a linguistic point of view and at the same time to question the sovereignty of technology as the only channel for those exchanges. As the original phrase suggested, far from providing a better understanding between individuals, the evolution of communication systems masks many doubts and questions relating to the growing degradation of information and its consequent manipulation for the sake of a future which is as a visionary as it is, sometimes, blind. The spiral of unexpected twists and turns through which a message gradually loses its literal meaning not only constituted the graphic image of the project and the access interface to the website, it also appeared as a faithful reflection of the changeable character inherent to all translation.

# Mongrel/Harwood National Heritage Turns to InfoWar//1998  

As the InfoWar leaflet states, the information society is 'no longer a vague promise of a better future, but a reality and a central challenge of the here-and-now'. A challenge like, How can we trust the people of the 'better future' when they are the oneswholeft us outof thepast?  

In its own little way, National Heritage has been waging an InfoWar - against the racially exclusive, Us West Coast utopianism that suggests information technology is inherently capable of producing a better world, or against the Euro-authoritarian here-and-now use of technology proposed by a speaker at Imagina 97: 'Now that the time of pioneers and prophets is over, it is time for mastery - political, cultural, social and creative mastery. We must lay the foundations for the cyber-civilization which is about to be born'. Mongrel is attempting to perform an abortion on this kind of cyber-civilization, having diagnosed it as a miscarriage of wealthy elitism.  

Mongrel addresses the computer's ability to reproduce infinitely its masters' image. Mongrel's repeated nagging-and-stabbing at the bloody miscarriage of cyber-civilization is forcing into view the images of those being reproduced so purely and 'cleanly', and is checking the wallet of those who would benefit. Mongrel is attempting to look these questions in the face and to discover that face'scolour.  

We have been examining the specific social relations that surround the new media and in particular how this new media works to construct images of race, eugenics and conflict within populations.  

Constructions of race in the form of mental images are much more than simple indexes of biological or cultural sameness. They are the constructs of the social imagination, mapped onto geographical regions and technological sites. These fabrications of race have traceable links to historically specific relations, from those informing about the experience of slavery, migrant labour, colonization, to those affecting friendship and family life. Racial images are pregnant with the social and political processes from which they emerge and to which, in turn, they contribute, and images of different races articulate the political and economic relations of races in societies.  

A mere look at the Sunday papers may reveal, for example, scenes of poor black, brown or yellow babies waiting for charity along with scenes of white babies waiting for their over-full nappies to be changed - disposables, of course, costing more than a life-or-death dinner for one of the non-white babies.  

If such patterns figure in wider society generally, then what insights can we gain by looking more specifically at the images in Cyberland? Some pretty specific questions can be raised, such as, When was the last time you saw someone black, yellow or brown in the Apple developer mag? Or, Why was the Nippon operating system so expensive in Japan? Although some magazines favour images of Japanese women fondling their modems, CyberEurope and CyberUSA offer us an almost complete absence of mongrelized, black or Asian images and, for that matter, a lack of any impure or 'filthy' social relations. This lack, or strategic forgetting, of mongrel images in the techno-cultural sphere goes far beyond simply reflecting the self-interest or distinguishing experiences and aspirations of the authoring 'Digirati' and their stuck-up class of consumers. The new techno pure-breds are actively ritualizing the 'CyberNation' into an ethnic bleaching - a kind of ethnic cleansing but a little less discriminating, and much cleaner.  

At the turn of the century, the construction of the Chicago skyscrapers marked a similar, albeit less ambitious, attempt. Then Chicago's elite merely tried to rid itself of the butchers' stench from America's biggest slaughterhouses with the watchwords 'Let's not deal with the rotting carcass. Let's build a palace in the sky.'  

Now, dominant racial and cultural groups in society act as an audience to their own techno-cultural-media product. Bleached images of self-congratulatory ritualized distancing symbolically install these groups as the right people to control,restrict and censor Cyberland.  

Digital cloning has helped cail into question accepted notions of originality and genius, allowing a re-evaluation of the codes of cultural production - just so long as this does not include the filth of uncomfortable social relations.  

Given the racialization and elitism of most electronic art events, attendees might still think that underneath they're all still loveable. The multicultural letsget-on-with-each other-and-get-happy number has for a long time been one of the main tactics for hiding hard, difficult debate under a sixties-style love-in.  

Mongrel cultures have come too long a way in intellectual rigour to be fobbed off with a flower pushed up the barrel of their gun. This is, as the InfoWar leaflet says, 'a battle in which the power of knowledge is managed as a profitable monopoly'.  

Societies seem to have learned nothing from the tragedies of this century, now compounded by the military technologies from which the new media have arisen. Are we now about to remake cultural spaces in thrall to the same armsdealer classes that profited before from war, slavery, migrant-labour, poverty, death and disease? Or are we to dirty up their future a little and complicate their desires with a dose of the same uncomfortable social filth?  

# Cultural Prestige and English Art, or Ignorance and Filth  

In the UK, art's centra! positioning on ideas of race, racisms and national identity was for a long time overlooked. While many black artists have been active in this field, the work produced rarely positions itself against the aesthetic and administrative modus operandi that houses it. One consequence is that a selfimage emerges in an art public among whom it is usual to assume that those participating in 'intellectual pursuits' and attending ‘culturally prestigious events' are above the mundanity of racial conflict and who indeed positively cultivate the view of themselves as 'anti'- or ‘post'-racist.  

Giving a few black British artists the odd bit of gallery space is then used as a pretext for the careful shunting of these problems out of the'purified' high-cultural sphere. Racism is thereafter located only in the vast majority of people not in attendance during events of cultural prestige - or, in other words, those people who live in subordinate English street cultures. Exclusion from this elevated world can thus be written off as self-inflicted. As a result, it becomes 'common sense' then that such English street cultures are racist get-togethers of ignorance and filth and that to produce a work of art, in a culturally prestigious location, about race, racism and national identity is unnecessarily preaching to the converted.  

But the politics of race and culture have changed. The idea of a narrow, selfrighteous, art-loving post-racism is, frankly, laughable. The self-confidence of subordinate English street cultures in dealing with racial issues is demonstrable in their endemic philosophy of mixing it up and in their mongrel anthems. This is not a suggestion that racism has declined in any measurable form, but that the ground on which it built their foundations is shifting. Art world post-racism is made all the more comic by the self-righteous moralism of the evangelical artcadresthatespouseit.  

In considering alternative technological arts practice and its relationship to cultural privilege, it is important that we think again about the principles that underlie artistic judgement. The idea of universality in art forms the basis of aesthetic judgement. It is the root onto which are grafted the principals of taste.  

Cultural domination is achieved by taste's acting as a measure of distance between those of us who have taste and those others who have not.  

Universality is a convention that was itself constructed out of debates in which racial difference was a central issue. Long before scientific racism had gained an upper hand, Hegel was arguing that the central difference between black and white races was a cultural and perceptual one. Hegel wrote that blacks 'do not have the ability to appreciate the necessary mystery involved in the creation of truly symbolic art, thus placing them outside the realm of authentic aesthetic sensibility. Critical dialogues in the English art scene between its professionals - curators and artists - and its audience clearly rely on a set of historical principles produced during Hegel's era, a period when slavery, bond servantry and forced child labour were still a large part of western civilization. Aesthetic judgement remains a fundamentally political concept.  

We need to destroy the boundaries put into place by specific arts disciplines, professionalization and the hierarchy of taste. We can start by inviting in the mongrel forms of culture, with their diverse and inclusive filthy' social relations. We can deal with the rotting carcass of Hegel's 'truly symbolic art' by burying it.

# Veran Matic Civil Networking in a Hostile Environment//2000  

I have often heard questions such as: 'How have you managed to survive and develop independent media in spite of the oppression Milosovic's regime has been conducting for the last thirteen years?' As well as curiosity, the question often conceals a reserved attitude towards the authenticity of the local media scene. The answer is quite simple: devotion to the original principles of human rights, the principles derived from the best tradition of journalism, and readiness to make changes in spite of the level of oppression. Nevertheless, I have to emphasize that without the use of new technologies, continuous experiments and endless efforts to connect the media and the entire network of independent organizations, mostly by creating new media, it would never be possible to develop media networking and to keep them alive. A number of situations have demonstrated the role of the Internet in overcoming prohibitions, as well as in strengthening and intensifying the democratization process within the media, because now almost everyone can have their own electronic media thanks to the Internet. However, the Internet is not capable of finding the solution by itself. On almost every occasion it is necessary to merge super-sophisticated technologies with traditional media techniques.  

A long time ago I used to write about the time after the Berlin wall had been overthrown and democracy established in Eastern Europe, where the main necessity was to turn the cold war infrastructure into an infrastructure for democracy, freedom of the press, human rights and so on, which meant beginning to use the war infrastructure for democratic and pacific purposes.  

This actually meant that the local forces which had shown a high level of democracy in their work, a professional attitude to journalism and, most of all, outstanding aspiration to establish and consolidate peace, were supposed to be given the use of the transmission structures for radio stations such as Voice of America and Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty.  

Instead, the budget for some territories has been cut, and increases given to the war areas. Very little has been changed within the structure, and the efficiency of such a method of distributing information, which had been relying on the cold war approach, could not be increased in a way that would indicate a serious qualitativeprogramme.  

Because these ideas were ignored, I suggested creating a parallel transmission structure which would serve local stations which have often been under oppression, bans and disruption, and which would be used for providing information in extreme situations. The emphasis is on enabling the existing influential media structures to overcome prohibitions, banning attempts, etc. The idea was put into effect, but as an extension and development of the existing cold war infrastructure. The only change was broadcasting the VOA, RFE/RL, and similar programmes on FM as well as AM frequencies, and also via satellite. Local media were also offered a rebroadcast, which would mean loss of credibility without a fresh quality.  

At present, we are trying to begin from the beginning. The Pact for Stability in Southeast Europe has presented a usable model. An increase in local cooperation among media could lead to the development of structures which would help to eliminate border barriers in distributing free information when free speech is radically choked.  

The interconnecting of regional media is a need which results from attempts to solve the banning problems as well as the oppression problems. The connection between political and economic events within the region is extremely high and the effects of radical political events cause substantial interference. The attempt to clog the ‘infected' space from the outside has not given the expected results, while it has produced even bigger problems, spreading them from the contagion' epicentre. Because of that, an inverted 'therapy' has to be applied - a broad opening. This can be achieved, above all, by increasing the range of broadcast information.  

After the information epicentre of Radio B92 had been banned four times, along with a number of stations within the Association of Independent Electronic Media (there are more than fifty of them), we were forced to resort to distribution using a combination of many methods. It is of prime importance that the editorial staff remains in Belgrade despite the daily menace. At present we have three dominant ways of broadcasting: radio, television and the Internet, and we combine them all.  

The radio is broadcast on the Internet in RealAudio and MP3 formats. Textbased news is distributed on the Internet in Serbian, Albanian, Hungarian and English. They are designed in such a way that they can be immediately printed and distributed as bulletins in areas where there is no access to the Internet (which has been done in a number of cases). Apart from the news, the site offers both analyses and daily discussions of several topical issues.  

Radio B2-92 is downloaded from the Internet and distributed via satellite as analogue broadcast from the BBC satellite, and digitally using commercially leased satellite time. (The frequencies are enclosed.) Both the satellite and the Internet have two simultaneous functions: to provide information directly, as well as to be a ‘prosthesis' and a link with the possibility of being rebroadcast in a simple way, because for most citizens it is the only way of accessing the media. Therefore, the radio programme is being rebroadcast by thirty radio stations in the country and by ten or so within the region. The stations cover parts of Serbia, including Belgrade, and in this way they compensate for the lack of free electronic media in Serbia. The idea of free regional program transmission has been practically accomplished, and it is important for freedom of speech, for democracy, for resisting war and terror, and so on. The entire distribution is administered by media structures within the country, in cooperation with partners in the region. This increases independence, the best strategies are used and the imposition of other strategies and distribution systems is avoided.  

Apart from receiving the signal through ground transmitters, there are numerous alternative ways of distributing the signal: a great many independent television stations broadcast the B292 current affairs programs covered as teletext from the website http://www.freeb92.net, a huge number of nongovernmental organizations arrange public access to the programme by receiving the signal from the Internet and rebroadcasting it through public address systems in city squares, coffee shops and clubs. This has been the radio's destiny for the past five years - an ongoing combination of both super-sophisticated and primitive ways of transmission. Such a range offers myriad combinations, depending upon local possibilities and imagination. The production centres have been organized flexibly: if the police storm the offices again the programme can be immediately produced from different locations already connected with ISDN and from sites where journalists trained in editing and distribution live, so that they can send their material to the main server which is located at a place where nobody from the staff is located. The server is controlled remotely. In the case of Internet traffic or the telephone lines being disconnected, the most important locations have wireless connections (this has already been established as a parallel network) and the broadcast will be resumed within ten minutes.  

Television broadcast can be organized in various ways. Since the technology is quite sizable,it is pretty difficult to conceive strategies and protect the production centre. For the time being, production is based in various mini-centres. As for the main news, each centre, each branch office and local transmitter has equipment which enables them to broadcast their material through ISDN to the co-ordination centre where it is packaged into the integrated current affairs programs. At the same time, a PC dish allows the downloading reports from other television stations. The central one sends the packaged news program via the Internet through a rented tunnel to the centre abroad, from where it is forwarded to a satellite and to local stations, which later transmit the programme via ground transmitters. In the same way, the programme reaches stations within the region from which it has been rebroadcast, so that it can be watched in Serbia, including Belgrade. In this case too, we are forced to combine the sophisticated and primitive, so the programme is sent, often by car, to a centre for satellite distribution because of possible interference and frequent telephone traffic cut-offs.  

In addition to the ground rebroadcast, the programme is screened on video projectors in squares, coffee shops and clubs or at specialized video projections in cinemas. Some private cable systems also rebroadcast the programme. The television programme uses the site http://www.freeb92.net and its news services and converts it into teletext format. The content of other sites is also presented, which enables users to obtain very full information. This is extremely important, as it is common knowledge that few people can afford to buy newspapers, while independent newspapers are suffering newsprint shortages, limiting their circulation. In some cities with no local television stations, rebroadcast via video senders is being used. The programme is received via satellite dish, recorded onto a VHS tape, and later, by means of a video sender, is distributed amongst the entire neighbourhood at a scheduled time, published on leaflets which are distributed as part of the scheme. In this way, it is possible to cover entire towns with the programme, depending on the topography.  

An additional level of communication and information provision is a regular information service distribution through mobile telephone short message services. SMs is free of charge in Yugoslavia and the most important news from the site is packed into adequate packages and sent to interested mobile phone owners. SMS is also used as a means of communication in extraordinary circumstances, during protests, violence, and so on. In addition, a lot more citizens in Yugoslavia own mobile phones than computers. Thus this form of information infrastructure is of major importance, and can be averted only by preventing all SMS distributors from accessing the local mobile telephone system. In this case the website is a central news checkpoint which, beside being a regular website, provides information to the classic distribution systems: radio, television, satellite, micro-transmitters, SMS, print, public address systems, cinemas, and so on.  

Since the regime has threatened to take over control of the Internet or to supervise Internet communication more rigorously, developing a secure web mail with the help from XS4ALL and MDLF is in progress. All appropriate organizations and individuals will be able to use the freeb92.net domain services, and traffic among those supplied with an address will be absolutely safe, which is of great importance in Serbia nowadays. The only requirement is Internet access through any provider. A possibility for alternative access is being prepared in case the state blocks the classic Internet access (although this is very hard to carry out, it is always necessary to have a couple of alternative options in order to prevent panic and to provide safety).  

The existing exchange of the material and the programmes which has been done in a traditional way via satellite is moving to the Internet as well. Correspondents from the province have been provided with laptop computers and have been trained in editing and posting the material prepared for broadcasting. As well as the central studio, all individual stations will be able to use the material. In order to ensure security, servers outside the country will be used. This will increase the communication possibilities. Owing to similar projects developed by One World and Baltic Media Centre, this form of communication will cover the entire region, which will also increase the transfer of free information and the possibility of media communications.  

Sets of DV cameras and editing equipment have been provided to branch offices and material distribution is carried out as if it were radio: the material is directly sent to the central studio,but also posted onto servers so that the stations within the network may use them and download them by means of PC dishes. It is possible to combine DV cameras, laptops and satellite phones in cases when communication is unusually restricted.  

Ongoing education is of.major importance. Training journalists in using the Internet, computers and software, digital recorders and DV cameras makes an integrated system in which a journalist turns out to be a mighty medium for news production and distribution. Another aspect of education is connected with training representatives of NGOs and other organizations in using the Internet as a medium, so that they will be able to create their own media which could be fitted into broader information systems. At the same time they would take responsibility for the information posted. Media decentralization like this creates a system which can lessen the force and the influence of monopolies, and processes which highly marginalize minorities and marginal groups. Coordinating the central programme withlocal programmes by supplementing and synchronizing makes the question of local programme survival senseless. A networked local media loses its mark of locality - at the same time it is both national and regional, minority and urban. [...]  

We are aware of the difficulties this kind of utopian project will face in order to survive the period of transition and conflicts which will emerge from the free market once the authoritarian state and the sealed society are a thing of the past. We will do our best to preserve these models in spite of all the misfortunes the transition period brings. To do this we shall rely on the same subversive use of new media and new technologies as we now use in pursuit of freedom in a hostile environment.

Linkania:The Hyperconnected Multitude//2005  

I ... Thinking of citizenship in the Web society is increasingly complex: how do chaos and order fit together in a concept that puts the individual in possession of the civics and politics of a State. Individual is an eroded word. A human being cannot be seen as indivisible. In modern society people are multifaceted, able to live many lives in a single one. Schizophrenia blooms in this society mediated by the digital. ...]  

Our goal is to enter citizenship. The idea is to take part, or 'citizenize'. I want, however, to go a little beyond this concept.  

My reference is linkania. A movement of self-organization of chaos. Linkania is an idea, an insertion in the world of ideas and things. [...]  

The concept of citizenship is being emptied in critique. Many activists against mass media sit at night on their couches and enjoy their colourful screen plugged into Rede Globo [the Brazilian commercial network]. Soap operas of the idle life pass in front of their eyes. We must aim beyond tactics. Activism has to go beyond criticism and constitute itself as a thought action, starting from a deep understanding of linkania and from a new model of relation among people and between people and technologies.  

Because linkania has to do with people. I mean people in a more encompassing form. With digital technologies we are perceiving feelings that were not present in our standard metaphysics. We are probing our singularities (and our schizophrenias). We have a crowd inside each person. Linkania makes the bonds for auto-organization. Therefore, linkania is opposed to the Hegelian idea of citizenship. Linkania is immanent. It is connected to people.  

Toni Negri provides an interesting insight:  

Against all avatars of the transcendence of the sovereign power (and nominally that of the 'sovereign people'), the concept of the multitude is one of immanence: a revolutionary monster of the non-representable singularities, it begins with the idea that any body is a crowd in itself, and consequently, expression and cooperation. It's in the same way a class concept, subject of production and subject to exploration, this being defined as exploration of the cooperation of singularities; a materialistic dispositive of the multitude can only start from a prior taking of the body and from the struggle against its exploration.'  

In this sense the Internet brings novelty. It lets us perceive these singularities and understand that this monstrous multitude potentializes the debate. It lets us understand that power tends to decentralization. The catalysis of collaboration is not a case under development. It is a virtual reality. Collaboration is a process that wasn't born with the computer. It's in the people's mouths, circling the dusty asphaltof theoutskirts.  

Linux was born, has grown up, ripened and now reaches a technological Orgasm. Breaking the logic of 'market share' is the apex of pleasure for the hacker communities. But I don't want to restrict myself to Linux. I've been saying that Linux is only the tip of the iceberg in this knowledge revolution. The free software communities are the model for a possible collaboration society. It was the developers who broke the barrier and superposed themselves over the dogmas of the industrial era. [...]  

To link for generosity. To link because we have common interests with real people. To link has objectives: recover the lost voice, seek in the digital interlines for a hope lapse, a more human humanity. Linkania is the collaborative evolution.  

To link, to link and to link: this is the motto of the new world.  

Linkania ... is citizenship without cities. It's unterritorialized. The action is local, but the connection is global. It's the friend's link, the neighbour's. It's the cue. It's business between two companies in different continents. It's the help given by your cousin from Madrid by e-mail. It's the discussion flowing in the forum to visit some exposition, and the link to the exposition, that somebody prints and pins on the nursery mural. All these are links. It's the text by some blogger that makes you think. It's the fortuitous discovery by the jobless person who visits an infocentre and registers for a government programme that sends him to a job. And it was a hint by a neighbour, he gave the link. [...]  

[Tlhe concept of linkania is not to be confounded with the blogger neighbourhood, nor with social softwares. Linkania is not a list of links. Linkania is the kindness to link. It's the act, the pleasure, the love of seeking in collaboration a new way to produce and to be happy. To understand oneself as a link. Linkania is about the hyperconnected multitude. So it is not fitting to think of cities as the space par excellence of sociability and culture. [..]  

This process is particularly important in Brazil. We have an anthropophagic tradition [of 'cultural cannibalism'], that is totally coherent with the hacker culture, melting elements of different origins in creative products. We are historically peripheric. And the edge is the centre. [...] Collaboration is always a survival strategy here. What would this country be if not for the kindness between people playing in the same misery team, the so-called 'excluded'. Excluded from access to the technological tools which allowed the elites to take hold of the cultural and artistic patrimony of humanity and transform it into private property, for the benefit of a few. But not excluded from the culture of collaboration, creativity and survival. [...]  

# Steve Lambert and the Yes Men On The New York Times 'special edition'//2008  

Hundreds of independent writers, artists and activists are claiming credit for an elaborate project, six months in the making, in which 1.2 million copies of a 'special edition' of The New York Times were distributed in cities across the US by thousandsof volunteers.  

The papers, dated July 4th of next year, were headlined with long-awaited news: “IRAQ WAR ENDS'. The edition, which bears the same look and feel as the real deal, includes stories describing what the future could hold: national health care, the abolition of corporate lobbying, a maximum wage for CEOs, etc. There was also a spoof site, at http://www.nytimes-se.com/  

"Is this true? I wish it were true!' said one reader. ‘It can be true, if we demand it.'  

'We wanted to experience what it would look like, and feel like, to read headlines we really want to read. It's about what's possible, if we think big and act collectively', said Steve Lambert, one of the project's organizers and an editor of thepaper.  

'This election was a massive referendum on change. There's a lot of hope in the air, but there's a lot of uncertainty too. It's up to all of us now to make these headlines come true', said Beka Economopoulos, one of the project's organizers. 'It doesn't stop here. We gave Obama a mandate, but he'll need mandate after mandate after mandate to do what we elected him to do. He'll need a lot of support, and yes, a lot of pressure', said Andy Bichlbaum, another project organizer and editor of the paper.  

The people behind the project are involved in a diverse range of groups, including The Yes Men, the Anti-Advertising Agency, CODEPINK, United for Peace and Justice, Not An Alternative, May First/People Link, Improv Everywhere, Evil Twin and Cultures of Resistance.  

In response to the spoof, The New York Times said only, 'We are looking into it.' Alex S. Jones, former Times reporter, who is an authority on the history of the paper, says: 'I would say if you've got one, hold onto it. It will probably be a collector'sitem.'

Digital, Aesthetic, Ephemeral: A Brief Look at Image and Narrative//2014  

With every new development of communication and information technology. the world changes slightly; and with every political movement, a new aesthetic is re-formed. It is an oft-repeated adage that the Internet has altered the way we share information, communicate and see the world; the same was said about the popularization of television and the invention of the printing press. These tools largely familiarized the world with the political aesthetics that became part of our everyday, visual landscape: think of revolutionary Cubism in 1920s Russia, Kalashnikov-romance photography of 1960s Palestine, and even 'flower power'\* and theanti-Vietnamwar movement.  

In the uprisings that have taken place across the Arab world since 2011, we have seen a certain narrative emerge through images and texts, though it is still too premature to examine these fully. In this short time, we have also noticed a cycle in the use and reuse of this content, with their resonance changing alongside shifting narratives. Amidst that, we have seen a recycling of this raw material into fine art pieces that make their way into commercial galleries in the UK, in effect glamorizing and dislocating these images of protest from the mode in which they were created. By July 2011, in London alone, the three-week Shubbak festival was immediately problematized for this exact reason by attendees uttering their annoyance at the quick cliche of an ongoing political Crossover. The organizers' “hasty reprogramming' to include the 'tumult of the Arab Spring' was noted by critics.2  

Still, the analysis of the images produced in and around the 'Arab revolutions' remains varied. The raw material and the 'produced' works of art (using that raw material) stand at separate ends of the conversation. This friction is mostly in the disengagement between actual, momentary images of real-time action that are reused for means ranging from protest to the press. On the other side of the conversation are fine artworks that reframe this raw material into works that reflect on the moment they convey with romanticized hindsight. This will manifest in various forms (film, theatre, visual art) as either fiction or non-fiction, with audiences reacting subjectively to it as 'good' or 'bad' art. These images feed a certain sort of 'simulation' of the reality that is masked by displacement, either in the interpretation of the event or in the setting in which the works are presented. This friction between the two is comparable to Roland Barthes' negotiation between the punctum,the viewer's emotional or personal involvement with an image, and the studium, images that carry an interpreted meaning.  

In this era of image-heavy uprisings in the Middle East, one can look at the shifting use of imagery as much as image content. Tracing the purpose of the now emblematic on-the-run, hazy imagery produced by mobile phone cameras and the like, to the appropriation of such imagery into fine art commodities, shows a shift in narrative of the so-called 'Arab Spring'. Some may argue that this has delegitimized or watered down the purpose of political imagery and the creation of political art, feeding into notions outlined in Guy Debord's The Society of the Spectacle (1967).3 In Debord's conception, society turns experience into representation, diminishing spatial realities and the distance between the past and the present. In Debord's society, people are automated by the image, fooled by it: image rules familiarity. Others may go even further and argue that this preoccupation with the image and the uprisings came at the price of imagining a real revolution. Building on Stuart Hall's idea of the “burden of representation',4 whereby too much weight is put on images that depict the marginal, a valid question would be in reference to a 'double burden': the need for artists to remain politically active while maintaining their role of producing meaningful artwork. The question this poses is whether this constitutes a crisis in art or a crisis in politics. [...]  

The archive of ephemeral, lo-fi, endless information created since 2011 is a scattered one that was created instantly and urgently with hand-held devices, proscribing the possibility of an archivist to maintain this information. They were uploaded on the spot into our current information systems, networked throughout the globe: this propensity was elastic, dialogic and eventually became emblematic. But the danger lies in thinking that credit must go to the tools (internet) for allowing the movement; it is a patronizing misrepresentation of an active, willed movement that used media to narrate a people's agency. The youth used these tools to disseminate information and images in ways that reflected their need and fed into a cycle of empowerment of the independent voice, redistributed as a consistent reminder and self-reflection of an ongoing movement.  

As a reflection of the political movement it was trailing, this inadvertent practice of image creation, for better or worse, parallelled the movement: fast, fleeting and uncentralized. It challenged ideas of power, control, knowledge and memory. With the current trend for focusing on personal, social and political memory and the archive by artists such as Rabih Mroue, Akram Zaatari, Ala Younis and many others, it is no surprise that when the unprecedented historical event rose into chaos, artists reacted by working these current political documentsinto their work. Artists in the Middle East have been retroactively reacting to historical events,byway of whatever media they can amass,from memories people have of the events to using their imagination as an attempt to complete, and at times dislocate themselves from, the story. The group of Lebanese artists who are still grappling with the Lebanese Civil War, for example, years after its end, deal with its psychological, social and political remnants. The work of Walid Raad and the Atlas Group seeks out, preserves and categorizes any bit of media that can allow for a tracing of individual and communal (hi)stories of the time. [...]  

An archive that is in use while it is being produced becomes both historical documentation and resistance material. The images and stories within this greater archive make it active and dynamic. It is not unique: past networks of resistance filmmakers and documentarians have had even stronger practices working with the same idea. Today, while there is perhaps no iconic image for the movement, it was the act of taking pictures with mobile phones that became itself iconic. [...]  

The merging of this hand-held, on-the-run aesthetic with cinema, theatre and fine art experiments with the uses of new media, expresses multiple dimensions of reality and emotions, while also addressing the unknown. The attempt to negotiate the ongoing frenzy came in the reframing of the same images of these grainy realities, showing people on the ground, images that carried the heightened senses, the rough sounds, the empowerment (yet still) and the violence of the moment. [...]  

The empowerment of reviewing and reassessing one's self-image was illustrated well by Malu Halasa during the presentation of her essay, Alternative Histories: Middle Eastern Portraiture, Photography, Art, Documentary, Illustration and Fashion Today, an Illustrated Lecture on Contemporary Visual Culture of the Middle East' at the National Portrait Gallery in December 2011.5 The essay reflects on imagery in North Africa and the Middle East since the uprisings earlier that year. Most profoundly, she discusses a conversation she had with Egyptian photographer Yasser Alwan, who has been taking street portraits since the 1990s. Halasa writes that Alwan noted that his portraits made people 'recoil and react unpleasantly', caused by their shame at 'being Egyptian'. But after 25 January 2011, this sentiment and self-image changed; now there was a feeling and image of perseverance among the working class of Cairo, a post-revolutionary pride. In her presentation, Halasa shared a video clip that shows these portraits, overlaid by iconic speeches about pan-Arab empowerment by Gamal Abdel Nasser and a song from the 1960s called Suta, meaning 'image, that epitomized the feeling of unity and inclusivity at the time. This song, the narrator of the clip says, became the anthem of the 2011 Egyptian revolution. While these thoughts came in retrospect regarding previous works, they embodied the euphoria and pride that can today be looked back at as lost and disillusioned. The narrator of the YouTube clip then goes on to tell the immaterialized fate of the great intention of the pan-Arab ambition.  

As if in a cycle, similar to the cracked self-image of Egyptian society referred to by Alwan, the narrative of the so-called 'Arab Spring' eventually started to shift.  

Contradictions arose between fear and courage; hope and despair; victory and self-reflection; self-criticality. We see this illustrated in the impressionist-meetsrealist exploratory photography of Nermine Hammam. Having created two series of images in reaction to the 18-day Egyptian uprising, we see that narrative shift in the consecutive images depicting mixed emotions. Her first series, Uppekha (2011) puts together photographs she took of the army in Tahrir Square; she manipulates these photos by tweaking the innocence in the features of the young male soldiers by digitally colouring them and replacing their backgrounds with images of Swiss mountain landscapes and Japanese cherry-blossom vistas. Her scepticism comes full-blown through her second series Unfolding (2011), for which she uses images of aggressive protest scenes sourced from the press, some of them now infamous. Among them are images of the Battle of the Camels' and the attack on the 'girl with the blue bra' - images taken by civilians and then used by mainstream press. These are more detailed scenes, again placed against a backdrop of Chinese silkscreens and other beautiful patterns.  

Yet Hammam insists she was not documenting the experience but rather negotiating a fleeting moment. This artistic rendition of what she describes as maternal protectiveness towards the army - ‘I wanted to just get these boys out of there'7 - is also a document that represents the moment in which she created her work. Unfolding not only reflects a specific moment of production, but utilizes the raw material that was meant to spread information about the movement in the first place. The work finally found its way to the displaced setting of a west London art space (in this case, The Mosaic Rooms). In her artist's statement for this series, Hammam notes the disconnection between reality, image and art. "When [they] die on camera, their death is distorted in an endless loop of infotainment ... Images on repeat build up our emotional immunity, a shell that threatens to cut us off from our humanity, our capacity for empathy' She also expressed the distance that the screen presents and the irony it entails, and asserts that these works serve to 'mock the artistic industry forming around the revolution', referring to the relationship between the viewer and artwork as a 'sado-masochistic' one.8 I...]  

Images constituting the narrative of political upheaval have gone through a process of moving from the Barthesian punctum, and bypassed his studium towards a Baudrillardian simulacrum - a state in which people have a stronger relationship with the image and symbol than the reality, once again, a spectacle that society has come to gaze at. lmages that started out as raw documents, showing brutalities and self-determination, held their emotional connection with the viewer. They informed, current and urgent. From there, they moved on to becoming parts of stories created by artists replicating and negotiating realities with the help of such 'real' images, creating works that led to realities being superseded by their own image. Eventually, some part of the equation - whether it was the politics in question or the images meant to represent politics -started to lose track.[...]  

In this act of looking, people have become accustomed to the mediated and now aestheticized images of highly emotive events, overtaking the reality of a political process in flux. Rabih Mroue once noted that what propelled him to produce his lecture performance/video piece Pixelated Revolution (2012), was a comment by a friend of his who said, 'Syrians are shooting themselves.'9 The irony here is in the spectacle of what has been arguably the bloodiest and most complex of the uprisings that started in 2011. The images romanticized the proletariat's voice in Tunisia and the 18 days in Egypt: days that seemed to slip through the fingers of the youths who propelled the movement. At times, being vocal and documenting the situation became more prominent than the end goal, all the while feeding that spectacle. Those days of hope and euphoria quickly became overrun by the fear, tension and brutality that hovered throughout.  

In his Future ofthe Image (2007), Jacques Ranciere points out the disconnection between the simulation created by the apparent 'truth' in imagery and political arts. While I consider that negotiating this frenzy in an artistic way is necessary, the eventual romanticization signifies its own passive development. The spectacle has developed, while the political movement, ongoing and incomplete, has taken a sharp turn from the euphoria that was documented so precisely in the heady days of revolution.

# Lizzie Homersham Ami Clarke and Richard Cochrane: 'Low Animal Spirits'//2014  

'Low Animal Spirits' comprises an algorithm, a 'dark pool made of shiny black Perspex, a plunging and rising section of a line graph realized in cold, grey metal, a text rich in quotation, and a short HD video loop in which highlighter-bright slogans, fast edits and the jangling sound of loose change evoke smalltime gambling habits and addictive arcades. Titled The Slots (2013), the latter is part of Ami Clarke's continuing series Error-Correction: An Introduction to Future Diagrams, which involves the production of speculative scripts exploring language use in relation to technological innovation, the logic of financial markets and ideas of artificial intelligence.  

The Slots derives its subtitles from 'take 2' of the Error-Correction series, initially commissioned for the Exchange publication accompanying a three-part exhibition at London's APT Gallery in 2013. Original phrases, such as 'the eye that remains of the me that was F', take on the quality of quotation since they recur not only in the publication and the video but also as a whisper coming from Clarke's floating lips in her Impossible Structures app, displayed on an iPhone in Banner Repeater's spring group show ‘Snow Crash'. The aforementioned quotation-rich text, titled In the Pull of Time, features this phrase yet again, inserted amid sentences pulled from attributed authors including William Burroughs, N. Katherine Hayles and Franco ‘Bifo' Berardi. In the Pull of Time is available during the Low Animal Spirits' exhibition as a rainbow, neon-lit printout affixed to the wall dividing the gallery's project space from its reading room, as well as in the form of a slim, ten-page booklet for the viewer to take away. It is also one of eleven texts collected in of a final account in formation, published in September on the occasion of Scott Mason's Milton Keynes Gallery performance of thesamename.  

Clarke's work evidently thrives on finding potential in repeating, recombining and disseminating language across multiple platforms, spanning print and digital forms.A further physical platform - Platform 1 of Hackney Downs station on which Banner Repeater is located - provides the ideal context for speculating as to the impact of the market on publication today. British railway stations are historical sites on which the publishing industry has been formed according to the will of powerful profiteers. In 1848 the first W.H. Smith railway bookstall appeared under the management of W.H. Smith Il, whose father had overseen the switch in newspaper distributionfrom horse-drawn carriages to rail.  

While Smith junior played a part in expanding literacy among train passengers, his monopoly over the rails gave him the power to influence taste and dictate the kind of material available: his puritanical streak meant that books with sexual or radical content were kept off his shelves, though they often sold in vast quantities elsewhere. A modern day equivalent of the W.H. Smith story might be found in the evolution of some of the most powerful companies representing one part of a digital publishing revolution. Twitter and Facebook are among the platforms feeding us news online in hierarchies of popularity: the most visible content is that which dominates a market with a currency of likes, shares, favourites or retweets. While Facebook has often censored and manipulated content, the suppression of Twitter as a source of news has been a causefor several recent campaigns.  

Where most artist publications (including the many print projects available to commuters passing Banner Repeater) represent slowness in relation to dominant modes of textual production and dissemination, the algorithmic star of theLow Animal Spirits' show accelerates, performing a scenario in which our reception of news is more closely aligned with the operations of global finance. Inspired by ‘Bifo' Berardi's allusion in The Uprising: On Poetry and Finance to economic crises having at their crux a loss of a referent between the (inhuman) financial sector and (human) poetic language, Clarke asks what it would look like if you set up a model in which the economy and language did in fact correspond. Low Animal Spirits, programmed with the assistance of Richard Cochrane, whose former career involved writing software for derivatives trading floors in the City, consists in the gallery setting of a projection running in real time from a laptop as the algorithm takes in the content of hundreds of global news feeds (from Reuters and Bloomberg to Prague Post and Ghana Web) and subjects individual words used therein to the principles of high-frequency trading. A precedent for this work can be found in Ubermorgen's net art project Extreme.Ru, 1999-2003, where a search engine detected trending words used on the Web daily and allowed the user to change viewpoint by selecting a 'volume, 'volatility' or 'vulgarity'filter.  

However, Ubermorgen's neofascist aesthetic is at odds with Clarke's approach. Moth-like behaviour is encouraged in the viewer, much as it is in the bright neons of The Slots; Low Animal Spirits draws its reader to the biggest, brightest source of light found in white words appearing on a black background, with the most valuable words growing to the greatest size as they become more volatile - shifting from rare to frequent occurrence in the news. Alternatively, one can experience the algorithm's activity as sound - headphones are provided for listening to automated voices as they read the words aloud. Personally, I found it preferable to forgo the voices; without them, it becomes a pleasure to string words together in amusing combinations or ask oneself what stories they might relate to: jobless Lopez', 'privately spewing, grammy leftovers and 'timeshare gimmicks' were among those I noted down.  

Meanwhile, on Twitter, the @LowAnimaiSpirit account has been sending out speculative headlines, recombining the content of the news feeds into different strings of words. When the content is plausible, the account alludes to the fake tweet sent from the hacked Associated Press account in April 2013: Breaking: Two Explosions in the White House and Barack Obama is injured' caused the Dow Jones Industrial Average to plunge more than 100 points before making the quick recovery, as described by the line graph mounted on one of Banner Repeater's walls. If this scenario of market revival reflects the irrationally optimistic human behaviour to which John Maynard Keynes referred when he wrote of 'animal spirits' prevailing during economic downturns, Clarke, by juxtaposing the algorithm with gambling-derived signs, gestures to the huge reallocations of capital, and human losses, that the reduction of language to data can ignore.

# International Necronautical Society Calling A1l Agents//2004  

Coinciding with the granting of a temporary licence to broadcast on FM in the London area, the International Necronautical Society (INS) Communications and Encodings Subcommittee opened the doors of the INS Transmission Room to the public at the ICA and established its first internet broadcast at www. necronauts.org  

The configuration of INS broadcasting protocols was developed following the INS Second First Committee Hearings: Transmission, Death, Technology (Cubitt Gallery, London, 2002) and this installation was designed in accordance with INS General Secretary's Report: Calling All Agents (ICA, London, 2003).  

The Transmission Room is both a fully functioning radio station and an embodiment of the psychoanalytical writers Nicholas Abraham and Maria Torok's notion of the 'crypt': an enclave which Derrida has described as 'a pocket of resistance to reality'. The key elements of INS broadcasting are reception, transcription, transformation and transmission: hearing and calling. Accordingly, the Transmission Room is equipped to receive the widest possible spectrum of data, voice and text streams.  

Visitors to the Transmission Room were able to observe INs Transmission Agents (Dactylographic Assistants) preparing a series of radio broadcasts, transcribing incoming signals, monitoring patterns and devices. The dissection of what INS General Secretary Tom McCarthy calls the 'mediasphere' follows the fault-lines in culture: between literature and philosophy, art and propaganda, fiction and phantasmagoria, territory and map. Incoming content was transposed, permutated, looped, echoed and inverted. Material was subjected to metrical and technical procedures devised by the INS Communications and Encodings Subcommittee, resulting in scripts for broadcast.  

INS signals were heard on FM radio in the London area, via internet radio and rebroadcast by collaborating stations in Europe and America.

# Felix Stalder A New Public Sphere//2010  

[... The public sphere as an arena for political discourse and a counter-balance to the state has been in decline for a very long time. While it's unclear when this decline started - Habermas puts it at the beginning of the twentieth century - it's fairly obvious that it has accelerated since the 1980s, following waves of deregulation and consolidation in the media business. Political and economic pressures led to an increase in the amount of 'soft news', people stories and commentary, and to a decrease in the investigative reporting being conducted. That's a well-known story. At the same time governments have learned to play the game of access and leaks. Journalists are being skilfully fed with insider information and have become increasingly dependent on having access to the centres of power. The embedded journalists at the beginning of the Second Gulf War were the most blatant example of this development. For both sides, this is a good arrangement. For the media, this is much faster and cheaper than doing its own research and for the government, it helps in controlling the story, not only by feeding the information (and even providing 'experts' to be interviewed on TV), but also by threatening to withdraw access from journalists and media who don't tow the line. Last but not least, the legal protections of journalism are effectively weakened, in part because challenges are launched more aggressively, and in part because commercial media view critical reporting through the eyes of their risk-averse legal and accounting departments.  

In the face of the evident crisis of news media, there has been much hope that the internet - the blogosphere and citizen journalism - would be able to replace the old, obsolete structures. On the whole, this has not happened, which is not surprising since new media never simply replaced old media. What we can see, however, is a slow, structural transformation of the public sphere in which the old news media is being complemented by new actors, designed to address the weaknesses of the mainstream media while making use of its core capacity to bring stories to lots of people. All in all, the process of investigative journalism is reorganized and, one can only hope, reinvigorated.  

In a news ecology, the traditional news media remains the most important delivery channel for news. It knows best how to package and deliver news effectively. The legal risk associated with publishing sensitive information, however, is outsourced, to WikiLeaks in extreme cases, or to blogs and other operators without assets in normal circumstances. At the same time, there are new sources of funding and investigative journalism outside the mainstream media. In the US, Pro-Publica, with philanthropic money from the Knight Foundation, was established in late 2o07 as an ‘independent, non-profit newsroom that produces investigative journalism in the public interest', because 'many news organizations have increasingly come to see it as a luxury. In April 2010, the Bureau of Investigative Journalism was launched in London with a very similar aim; funded by the Potter Foundation, it's also a not-for-profit. Both units are partnering with traditional news media, print and television, which will carry the stories they investigate. In addition, new collaborative infrastructures, such as DocumentCloud, 'an index of primary source documents and a tool for annotating, organizing and publishing them', is providing the infrastructure to cope with very large amounts of materials efficiently across newsrooms and organizational boundaries. The various elements that make up the process of investigative reporting, (protecting the source, doing the time-consuming work of gathering and making sense of information, providing the tools for handling the material, and delivering the story to the public at large), are no longer performed by a single organization but by a networked set of organizations, mostly dedicated to performing only one of them well, and all based on different economic models but still working together to move the story into the public sphere. Within this new ecology, WikiLeaks is the actor taking on the most risk, which leaves the others relatively free to act within an otherwise highly constrained environment.  

In a way, this changes the character of the final product, the news story, as well. It brings traditional reporting - where source material is usually kept unpublished - and blogging, where source material is usually linked to, closer together. Since WikiLeaks publishes the material anyway, many of the newspapers that turn its records into stories do that as well (rather than only quoting a sentence or two). On the whole, this makes the stories more transparent and, frankly, more interesting to read. As far as one can tell already, stories written with DocumentCloud tend to be similar. Whether this amounts to ‘scientific journalism' as Julian Assange hopes, journalism that publishes its source information the same way that scientists publish raw data and research methods, remains to be seen. But the combination of having access to a highly edited story as well as to sprawling source material could be very powerful. I...]

1:1//2002  

Jan Ekenberg: Software does not sleep. Just as the exposure of a photographic plate in the first pinhole cameras created an inscription, the 1:1 'softbots' continuously scan servers on the Internet, generating a representation of an environment we seldom encounter face on, but rather from specific entry points, socalledportals.  

Contemplating this endless, rather grand and hubristic inscription, resulting in a database, encompassing all the IP addresses used by Web servers, it's tempting to look historically into the metaphoric and connotative possibilities of our key concepts just for a second. It is amusing to notice that the word for web (a weaving) both in Latin and Greek converges with the word for text (textus and huphos). We can also observe that the Greek word griphos, related to the word griphastai, which in Sparta meant 'to write', also means net. But griphos also has another appropriate, but in the context, somewhat disturbing meaning: griphos also meansriddle or enigma.  

These early photographs, like all images, function as interfaces. The photographic filter that one looks through, allows us to understand and manipulate our surroundings. After looking at a photograph of something, the subject looks different - it is different.  

The Internet is clearly an environment, a public space, but can hardly be seen, Or experienced as such, in itself. The Internet requires an interface to be experienced.  

The title of this project: 1:1, as in scale 1:1 suggests that a map, or a model, has the same size as that which it refers to. When this occurs, the distinction between the abstract ‘Geography' and the tangible ‘Empire' becomes vague. Several variations on this theme have been exercised, most notably by Borges and Baudrillard, but before them Lewis Carroll brought up the idea in a short passage in his book Sylvie and Bruno Concluded, in 1893:  

"What a useful thing a pocket-map is!' I remarked. 'That's another thing we've learned from your nation', said Mein Herr, 'map-making. But we carried it much further than you. What do you consider the largest map that would be really useful?' 'About a six inches to a mile.' 'Only six inches!' exclaimed Mein Herr. 'We very soon got to six yards to the mile. Then we tried a hundred yards to the mile. And then came the grandest idea of all! We actually made a map of the country, on the scale of a mile to the mile!'  

‘Have you used it much?' I enquired.  

It has never been spread out, yet', said Mein Herr: 'the farmers objected: they said it would cover the whole country, and shut out the sunlight! So we use the country itself, as its own map, and I assure you it does nearly as well.'  

First we encounter a collapse between the map and the interface. But the postphotographic practice of the 1: 1 project makes the implosion even more severe. The interface becomes not only the map, but the environment itself. Let's hope the farmers don't object..  

Lisa Jevbratt: Of central importance to appreciating the significance of the 1:1 project is understanding that it explores the formal qualities of the World Wide Web in relation to the larger network of which it is part: the internet. The Web is just one kind of service, or protocol, that inhabits the network's physical and numerical space. The 1: 1 project is primarily interested in exploring the ontology of the internet numerical spaces, through which the Web is able to express itself as an entity in the larger space of the internet as a whole. C5 has created both a database that archives the relationships that exist amidst the numerical space inhabited by the Web, and five different visualization algorithms that allow these spaces to express their various identities to audiences. What's an IP address? The basic protocol of the internet is, not surprisingly, called the Internet Protocol or IP. An IP address is simply the numerical address of whatever kind of service that is offered by that 'place' (or computer) on the network. One example of such a service is the hyper-text transfer protocol (http), which is also known as the World Wide Web. The now ubiquitous Universal Resource Locators for the Web, (URL's), which we are so familiar with via the media, have the 'http://' at their beginning to indicate that they are a web address. The remaining part of the address, (let us say: cadre.sjsu.edu), is really just a cover for the IP address that is the 'real' address of the website. For example 130.65.200.15 is the 'secret' real address for http://cadre.sjsu.edu, a website that could just as effectively be typed into a browser as http://130.65.200.15. It's a little bit like the address of a major supermarket; you often know it by the name on the big backlit sign in front of the store, and don't refer to it by its mailing address. The IP address of websites is typically hidden from view through the services of special computers on the network called domain name servers, which look up a name such as cadre.sjsu.edu and then secretly sends the web browser the actual IP address that it uses to find the site.  

The database is the result of an ongoing‘interlaced search'. An even sample of possible IP addresses is examined simultaneously (rather than searching from the beginning of the numerical spectrum O.o.o.o of the IP addressing system to the end 255.255.255.255). By zooming in on the numerical spectrum, i.e. repeatedly performing the search on different samplings, all possible IP addresses will eventually have been tested for inclusion in the database. The search will at that point start up again, so that new networks and hosts on the Web get included. Currently, approx. 2 per cent of the spectrum has been searched and 186,100 sites have been included in the database.  

Because of the interlaced nature of the search, the database could in itself at any given point be considered a snap-shot or portrait of the Web, revealing not a slice, but an image of the Web with increasing resolution. The C5 IP database contains any hosts that respond to an http request. Hosts with limited or restricted access, and without a front-end HTML document are included. When navigating the Web through the database, one experiences a very different web than when navigating it with the 'road maps' provided by search engines and portals. Instead of advertisements, pornography and pictures of people's pets, this web is an abundance of non-accessible information, undeveloped sites and cryptic messages intended for someone else. Search-engines and portals show us a thin slice of the Web, not the high resolution image we sometimes think they do.  

The interfaces/visualizations are not maps of the Web but are, in some sense, the Web. They are super-realistic and yet function in ways images could not function in any other environment or time. They are a new kind of image of the Web, and they are a new kind of image. I...]

# Julian Oliver The Graph as Landscape: Reflections on Making Packet-Garden//2008  

A computer with access to the Internet will typically touch hundreds, even thousands of remote computers a day. Even if not in active use, software running on a modern operating system will regularly query other computers for an update, an address or even just a simple 'are you alive?' Over the last few years peer-to-peer software, instant messaging, mass-mailers, botnets and multiplayer computer games have exponentially increased the amount of Internet traffic. Packet Garden maps this network contact, forming an accessible 'walk-in' graph, a geography produced through the accumulation of network events.  

On a personal level, I set out to make Packet Garden to learn more about the Internet at the level of network messaging and to explore the metaphor of terrain as graph. Navigation of this terrain is a kind of reading: just as the undulations of the Earth's surface can be read as records of energetic events below and above the surface, I wanted the landscape to both contain and represent information. The key challenge of this world-as-graph experiment was in the design of a heuristic landscape: which data inform which element? The primary information I wanted to use in my graph - and so pass on to the user of the Packet Garden - Was network address(IP),geographical location and a total of the data transferred.  

Before design could begin I needed to know which information I could feasibly capture on Linux, OsX and Windows systems using the same base of code. To have access to this information at all I needed to work at a low level, looking at each packet of data going over the network card and dissecting it in turn. To do this I wrote a tiny program to run on the user's machine that logged what went over the network card and collated the results in a way I could parse to generate a three-dimensional scene. In collecting this data I was stepping into a contentious area. The software I was writing was tracking some of the user's most sensitive data - their computer's network footprints.  

Once this data was logged it had to be parsed so as to be meaningful within mygeographical metaphor.  

I chose network load as my primary deforming force: uploads would make mountains and downloads valleys. In order to locate these formations and deformations, I needed to design a means to translate Internet addresses (IPs) into a system of three dimensional coordinates. Internet addresses currently use the IPv4 standard; IPs are comprised of four blocks of numbers between 0 and 255, separated by dots (the Aotearoa Digital Arts website has the IP '205.196.213.237', for instance). These numbers form unique numerical addresses for computers, to which we ascribe names known as domains. These domains aremade available to querying software such as web browsers by Domain Name Servers. This makes finding data held on a specific computer on a wide network like the Internet easier for humans, with the added benefit that each address contains content of its own - information about location, for instance.  

The Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) has been responsible for the allocation of blocks of IP numbers to countries, while guarding certain restricted ranges for corporate and military interests. Several other ranges (such as the 192.168.0-255.0-255 range) are reserved for Local Area Networks. All such proscriptions considered, of the 4,294,967,296 possible unique addresses, around an eighth of the numeric space of the Internet is out of bounds for public use.  

The first two blocks of anycomputer's IP generally contain enough information to ascertain its geographic region (or that of the computer's ISP at least). I derived this information from a third-party database stored locally as part of the Packet Garden software installation on the user's machine. I used these first two blocks of each IP as values for my longitude and latitude. Once I had plotted these points onto the 360 x 360 plane of my graph, I could then map each of them onto the base sphere of my garden. All other values (such as the amount of data collected at that address over the given time) were scaled to a range between O and 1. An icosasphere (my featureless terrain) could then be deformed, based on these values. Raw traffic proved to be enough to produce meaningfully a simple terrain, but there was still plenty of other data I could incorporate.  

As the computer's activity log was parsed, the ports used by each packet of data were collated. If a match was found between the port used and a known application, a plant form representing that activity was created. There were plants of different types of activities: mail, gaming, HTTP, FTP. I wrote a file pairing ports with applications, but this was later added to by many users interested in detecting traffic from their favourite application. The positions of the plants fit the newly deformed surface, so that each rise or dip wouid be marked with the kind of transaction responsible for it. Features without a detected protocol - sometimes it's impossible to tell a protocol from a port number - were left unplanted. IANA reserved ranges were represented as green crystals or seed-like forms floating above the terrain and marked as 'Private'. The terrain under these seeds would probably never see traffic unless the specific user had access to such addresses via a government, military or corporateintranet.  

Packet Garden allows for users to generate a world whenever they desire, with one garden saved each day. Like a kind of a network diary, the user can compare past worlds with their current traffic. Of particular interest, however, was that some people were changing their browsing habits to generate different sorts of terrains: users were approaching the project in ways I hadn't anticipated, using the graph to shape the data, rather than vice versa.  

During the latter stages of development, Packet Garden got its first major coverage, in The Guardian Online. This exposed Packet Garden to a wide public days after my first beta release. Almost immediately I had thousands of users not . expressly interested in 'Information art' but fascinated by what their computer was doing behind their back'. Next came paranoia, something I entirely failed to anticipate. Online discussions emerged characterizing Packet Garden as new breed of spyware from anti-file-sharing organizations, with one user even suggesting that it was created by the NSA. Others were simply concerned that Packet Garden was a harvester disguised as a gimmick or toy.  

In response to this discussion, two experienced security auditors took the code, screened it thoroughly and reported back. With their finding that my software wasn't strategically breaching their privacy, downloads picked up steadily. Here releasing the project under an open-source licence where it could be subjected to such scrutiny proved to be vital to its continued distribution. In spite of this clean bill of health there was some truth to the criticisms: I was writing a kind of perverted spyware-software for the user to spy on their own computer.  

As Packet Garden was approaching its 100,000th download I saw increasing discussion of the gardens as private worlds, worlds that needed tending and patrolling to protect the sensitive data they contained. More than a raw expression of information, the combination of landscape and personal online history was giving the garden value as little territories: people wanted to name the worlds and landscape features and to invite friends in. This development of the garden as places was something I had not anticipated, let alone attempted toproduce.  

What began for me as way of visualizing imperceptible data would emerge as means for creating private places, worlds built from the everyday communications of users' individual machines. Each Packet Garden becomes a personalization of the unseen life of the network.

# Cheryl L'Hirondelle Treaty Card//2004  

this site is an attempt to re-dress current relations between natives & nonnatives by re-examining the intent, issue and details of the canadian government's 'certificate of indian status' which is more commonly known as ‘treaty card' in mainly the plains on the landbase now called canada.  

when the treaties were signed it was between a chief on behalf of the people and a representative of the queen on behalf of her people. since the treaties were made between at least two parties, then both should have a card. today 'treaty indians' are the only holders of the card which is commonly known to be a carryover from thereserve pass system whereby indianpeopleliving on reserves were not allowed to leave(to hunt & gather, visit relatives or carry out business) unless the indian agent who also controlled food rations would issue this pass.  

perhaps this is why the card is a canadian government issue and doesn't acknowledge the original treaty agreement as much as it still attempts to control the identity & movement of the card holder by branding all '... is an indian within the meaning of the indian act, chapter 27, statutes of canada ...' and has efficiently trained card holders to present as a regular part of daily interaction (and sadly even used to boast as some elevated form of government certification).  

- for current holders: this version will enable you to now provide more relevant information as it pertains to your landbase (ie. original names in your language, &hopefully a moreflatteringphoto ofyourself)   
- for metis, non-status: this version allows you to finally have your own personal facsimile of the gov't issue (if you've been feeling left out of the club). if you are part of a 'surrendered' band and/or are under re-entitledment this can be added in the place of origin/birth field.   
- for non-natives: never let the words 'i wish i had a treaty card' pass your lips again-sign up today  

use:  

this is intended for first time non-native card holders only:  

the purpose of the 'treaty card' (see about) has been to track the movement i.e. spending patterns, prescription drug use, doctor & dentists' care, police contact, social services use etc. and institutionalise the identity of \*...indians within the meaning of the indian act, chapter 27, statutes of canada'.  

if you have created your own card, or are about to, please consider taking action and do all or some of the following:  

after you've printed the card (colour inkjet works best), cut around edge of card, fold in half and insert into a plastic sleeve and: - carry this card in your wallet, purse or on your body as your primary form of identification - memorize the registry number & be prepared to quote it by stating 'my treaty number is -' (refer to registry # on front of card) - present it whenever identification is requested present it when you purchase anything - present it when you visit the doctors', dentists' or any other government subsidized health practitioner - present it when visiting any government agency - present it if stopped by the police or rcmp - most importantly, take note of how it feels always have to account for your identity  

- show off to your friends by stating that you now finally have 'your very own treatycard' refer to yourself as being 'treaty' above any other type of self identification

# Marina Grzinic A Hole in the Brain of the Machine//2000  

0100101110101101.org's [Eva and Franco Mattes] Life Sharing is a Walker Art Center-commissioned Internet artwork - or perhaps, if you prefer, a web-based project - that presents a bizarre shift, a reversal. Rather than moving from dull, drab life into the ecstasy of Internet art, Life Sharing takes a radical detour from the thousands of exciting formalistic possibilities of web designing (the innovative interfaces that are always trying to amuse us) and returns to dull, drab existence itself - the disgusting impotence of everyday bureaucracy, the exchange of mail, and the negotiation for new projects.  

There are subdirectories and maps, dozens of different documents that include e-mail letters, drafts from ongoing projects by 0100101110101101.org, to archives of texts by other authors with 0100101110101101.org's comments, pages of e-mails, half-completed documents and personal annotations mixed with samples of critical texts - a whole bank of virtual papers. Such a gesture allows us to enter a private life. If you have time to take a ride, browse through papers, documents, paths, and texts - who knows how long it might take and where we might land. 0100101110101101.org is creating a hole in the brain of the machine as a kind of alien situation, a de-realization of the system of the computer and of the content of so-called everyday life. It is as if we suddenly have access to the constantly microscopically zoomed information content of an individual, in all the dirtiness and business of someone's life. It is as if he or she gives us the possibility to see everything under his or her skin, the intestines of the body, so to speak, and of the computer as well. There is something disgusting and repulsive in this action, but powerful at the same time. I...]  

The aim of 0100101110101101.org's Life Sharing is to effect the ‘ruin of representation' precisely on the grounds of what has been excluded from the non-represented object (e.g. life itself). This creates a significance derived from absence, and in this way investigates the means by which a subject, and the body, are produced. Such counter-narratives are resistant to the point that they can no longer be included within a philosophically binary opposition, but inhabit philosophical oppositions, resisting and disorganizing, without ever constituting a third term.2 The achievement is this: the decentralization of the subject to the point where instead of outside or inside, there exists a powerful dynamic relation to both outside and inside, dependence and independence, art and nature and, ultimately, to what is real and what is not.  

Is 0100101110101101.org (de)archiving life? No, it is rather a simulation ot its political and emotional coordinates. However, it is not only this; the way life is presented in the Life Sharing project clearly shows that life via the Internet is only an algorithm. Life Sharing is powerful on the libidinal rather than on the conceptual level, on the way we 'desire' our own oppression, rather than the way we entertain beliefs. The project aims not so much to show life as something else, but rather to instantiate the idea of dealing with, or living with and through. contradictions. This means that it is not a question of losing life, but actually getting it back through a process of rethinking the place where it was/is produced.  

0100101110101101.org uses extreme oppositions to show that life is absolutely mediated, constructed and fabricated, and that there is a speculative identity of the computer paradigm and of life itself. It shows that instead of being a substantial force, life is composed of cliche. What else is this mountain of e-mails, virtual paperwork, correspondence? The strategy is not to make fakes, but to develop tactics of political and aesthetic articulation of a proper reality and the politics of resistance, as Homi Bhabha would say, around a specific kind of subject that is constructed at the point of disintegration.3  

0100101110101101.org is almost fixated on life, reaching the zer0 elements of what is perceived to be the central concept of the Internet, which still functions as sublime object. This is a deadly serious vision, as Slavoj Zizek would say, that shows clearly the important quality of technology and clichés.4 Instead of producing a new identity, something much more radical is produced: the total loss of identity. The subject is forced to assume that s/he is not what s/he thought her/himself to be, but somebody/something else.

# SteveDietz The Database Imaginary: Memory_Archive_Database, version4.0//2007  

In 1968, in a report to the Rockefeller Foundation during a residency at SUNY Stony Brook, Nam June Paik argued that 97 per cent of all electronic music was not recorded and that 'a simple measure would solve the whole problem. An information centre for unpublished electronic media should be created. At the time, this meant such a centre would 'provide a Xerox copy and a tape copy of musical pieces, at the request of performers, students, and organizers from all over the world'.! Convert analogue to digital, and the dream lives on, perhaps more vibrant than ever, of a universal database archive, with access to everything by anyone anywhere at any time.  

But is access to information enough? As Hal Foster asked: Will such a database archive be 'more than a base of data, a repository of the given?'2 Particularly in regard to Net culture - but any dynamic activity, really - a database archive can be tantamount to 'museumification', and it is no wonder that many artists are sceptical, at best, of the mausoleumizing of the vibrant Net culture they have been creating and participating in. More to the point, the classification schema inherent in any database, to paraphrase Barnett Newman, are for art what ornithology is for birds. Many contemporary artists, however, use databases as their medium and as an aesthetic platform for their concepts, not merely as a container of metadata about them.  

# The Database Imaginary  

In Interface Culture, Steven Johnson argues that the interface is omnipresent, a defining aspect of contemporary culture.3 Almost unbelievably, according to Wikipedia, ‘Databases resembling modern versions were first developed in the 1960s:4 Arguably, however, the database has become the, ‘back end' of this contemporary, ubiquitous interface culture. Even when, technically speaking, a collection of data, or information, that is specially organized for rapid search and retrieval does not exist, the potential of getting-retrieving-finding what you want is omnipresent, just on the other side of the interface.  

The database imaginary is only partly a reflection of the rise of the Internet and Microsoft sloganeering about 'Where do you want to go today?lm' It is mirrored more generally in what Simon Nora and Alain Mine described in a 1978 report to the French governmient as the 'computerization of society'.5 Even in the art world, Leo Steinberg presciently alluded to this transformation in his classic essay,'Other Criteria':  

The flatbed picture plane makes its symbolic allusion to hard surfaces such as tabletops, studio floors, charts, bulletin boards - any receptor surface on which objects are scattered, on which data is entered, on which information may be received, printed, impressed - whether coherently or in confusion. The pictures of the last fifteen to twenty years insist on a radically new orientation, in which the painted surface is no longer the analogue of a visual experience of nature but of operational processes ... Yet [the flatbed] is no more than a symptom of changes which go far beyond questions of picture planes, or of painting as such. It is part of a shake-up which contaminates all purified categories. The deepening inroads of art into non-art continue to alienate the connoisseur as art defects and departs into strange territories, leaving the old stand-by criteria to rule an eroding plain.6  

Within the context of the computerization of society, many digital artists are part of this 'shake-up which contaminates all purified categories', which might be also described as the database imaginary, freeing data (content) from their metadata (classification schema). The artist, as Manuel DeLanda put it in a 1998 interview, 'is that agent (human or not) that takes stratified matter-energy or sedimented cultural materials' - such as databases - 'and makes them follow a line of flight, or a line of song, or of colour'.?7  

The Unreliable Archivist by Janet Cohen, Keith Frank and Jon Ippolito was commissioned by the Walker Art Center in Minneapolis as both a parasitic archive of the pioneering artist website ada'web and a meta-commentary on the act by the Walker for archiving such a remarkable and vibrant collective project.8 The Unreliable Archivist, like any good archivist, creates metadata about ada'web. In the case of Cohen et al., it just happens to be a little, shall we say, idiosyncratic. The value of a data standard like the Categories for the Description of Works of Art is its precision - at least for experts.9 It allows the user to make minute differentiations between objects. It allows for the discovery of specific known objects from vast databases. What it is not so good at is making connections or finding things one doesn't know about. Think of the difference between searching for an eighteenthcentury portrait in oil on wood [CDwA] and searching for something that has 'ambiguous language','enigmatic images', and 'preposterous style' [UA].  

When I first saw The Unreliable Archivist, I took it to be homage to the wonderful, breathtaking excesses of ada'web and those who created it. I also took it to be a parody, a tongue-in-cheek commentary on the butchery that archiving - mothballing - such a dynamic institution as ada'web could entail. 1 still think these conclusions are true, but my concern has changed. Rather than worrying about how unreliable the archivist is, perhaps we should map mainstream institutional collections according to these categories and values. What would happen? It is possible to imagine a future in which everything is archived - former credit data to our memories, from world events to passionate encounters. How, then, do we create systems that allow each of us to be an unreliable archivist? To allow each of us to create the preposterous, the enigmatic? No matter how intelligent archiving agents are in the future, they will be poor substitutes if they cannot represent an individual, idiosyncratic and imaginative point of view.  

# Technologies to the People?  

It is good for the artist to insinuate himself into the open mesh of any system - not in a provocative and visible way, but mimetically, using their same mediums. -MaurizioCattelan  

Daniel Garcia Andujar's Video Collection is what I would call a prototypical net.art gesture."0 It appropriates the developing practices of the Internet, in this case database-like streaming content as well as its series of unhelpful help-desk messages, and yokes them to cultural and societal desires - in this case database access to significant but not always easy-to-find cultural resources. While there is a clear element of épater le bourgeois with this work, one less predictable outcome is the economic and intellectual property issues that are raised. At least two artist and/or cultural institution representatives wrote to Andujar with questions such as 'How did you do this?' (technically) and ended with more quizzical questions that, more or less, asked, How dare you do this?' The issue is only partly economic. By being so opaque about his project, Andujar also highlights the tension between the ideal of transparency in Net culture and in archiving, and the fact that information is knowledge and power, whether it is about the arcana of technological capabilities such as streaming media or the arcana of classification schema.  

# Reversing the Panopticon  

One of the cornerstones of museum culture is authoritativeness and selectivity. The pioneering example of Muntadas' The File Room, however, points to a very different model of bidirectional information flows, multinodal information sources, collaborative filtering, multiple points of view, the transgression of geographic and discipline boundaries and the commingling of specialist and non-specialist.!1  

The File Room is a particularly interesting example as it is about censorship. Explicitly, it is about instances of censorship that have occurred anywhere in the world. Implicitly, however, it is about the fact that there has been no easily and publicly accessible source for this information, that subjects of censorship have often been beholden to traditional news sources to tell their stories, and, if they are told at all, they are not always the story the subject would tell. The effect of the network, allowing for distributed authorship of the censorship cases in The File Room, creates the possibility of an asymmetrical relationship to power and control - distributed David is fighting the centralized Goliath. Another contemporary example of this reversal of the panoptic gaze of the database is Ryan McKinley's Open Government Information Awareness project.!2 Open GiA is a response to the idea of the Total Information Awareness project, floated by the Bush administration post-9/11. And while TIA was ultimately (or temporarily, at least) shut down, it brought into focus the dark side of the database imaginary, where every shred of information is connected with every other and where total information equals total control. Through the deployment of a distributed database, however, Mckinley at least imagines the possibility of a counterpanoptic gaze of the people.  

# Data Bodies  

In an age in which we are increasingly aware of ourselves as databases, identified by social security numbers and genetic structures, it is imperative that artists actively participate in how data is shaped, organized and disseminated. -Victoria Vesna,'Database Aesthetics', AI & Society, vol. 27, no. 2  

In Time Capsule Eduardo Kac has taken Vesna's observation to a kind of logical extreme, self-implanting a bio-panoptic surveillance device, a microchip that contains a programmed identification number integrated with a coil and a capacitor, then hermetically sealed in biocompatible glass.3 Scanning the implant generates a low-energy radio signal that energizes the microchip to transmit its unique and inalterable numerical code. As part of the procedure, Kac registered himself in a database set up to aid in finding lost animals, classifying himself as both animal and owner.  

According to Kac, half tongue-in-cheek, half seriously, humans adapt, physically as well as emotionally, to become literal extensions of the computer, of the database interface. 'It is almost as if the body has become an extension of the computer, and not the other way around.'4 Time Capsule literalizes this inversion of the human-computer interface, drawing attention in the process to the way our data bodies become subject to the classification and ultimately to the control of innumerable databases that are beyond our corporeal reach.  

# Anatomy of the Database  

Allan Sekula, in his important essay 'The Body and the Archive' pointed out the early role of photographic archives in the normalization of the criminal surveillance system, not to mention the rise of eugenics. In terms of the origins of the photographic archive, which gave rise in many ways to our present-day surveillance society, there were two important poles:  

The Paris police official Alphonse Bertillon invented the first effective modern system of criminal identification. His was a bipartite system, positioning a 'microscopic' individual record within a 'macroscopic' aggregate.  

and  

The English statistician and founder of eugenics, Francis Galton, invented a method of composite portraiture ... Through one of his several applications of composite portraiture, Galton attempted to construct a purely optical apparition of the criminal type.!s  

If the database, with its multiple fields for searching, is a direct descendant of the Bertillon cabinet, which managed to classify hundreds of thousands of subjects according to twelve measurements so that the smallest category in the system had no more than a dozen records, a descendant of Galton's composite photograph is thecompositedataprofile.  

Beginning with Lisa Jevbratt's Stillman Projects, and continuing with the projects 16 Sessions, 1:1 and SoftSub, the artist group C5 has created a number of fascinating collaborative filtering projects that make manifest the vast and subterranean datamining efforts that big and small businesses alike are mounting to make a buck off your information - your body of data/databody.16  

The important aspect of Galton's composite photograph was not whether someone did or did not look like it. No one did, by design. The intent was in the mean differentiation. Individuals that approached the composite profile to a certain degree were suspect. In a similar way, composite data profiles of likely buyers and likely offenders are being created and as your data profile approaches it, you will be acted on accordingly, whether it is with spam or a visit from a governmentauthority.  

SoftSub is an opt-in program - a screensaver that collects information about the file structure ofa user's computer. Data are collected only if a user downloads the software and only if he or he decides to upload personal data. Here, an opposite approach to Andujar has a similar result. By foregrounding the practice of conscientious opt-in, the standard practice of hidden or murky datagathering procedure is highlighted. It is also relevant that SoftSub is collecting essentially benign information. Even assuming nefarious intentions, about all C5 can do is post on the Internet the one hundred messiest desktops. C5's real interest is in trying to understand how to approach very large data sets and attempt to 'understand’ them, or at least create viable hypotheses about them, through a visual mapping process without having a particular target in mind and without assuming there is an objective truth or reality to be discovered. Galton and his disciples, however, attempted to assert that such visual mapping was‘proof'ofcriminality.  

# Data Stories  

There will always be a tension between the complete description of a specific individual and a generalized description of a group. Neither tells the whole story. One way to get beyond just the facts, of course, is actually to tell a story. While storytelling may seem inimical to databases, the linguistic researcher Walter Ong has determined that one of the great Western storytellers, Homer, substituted a stock set of phrases according to identifiable regular occurrences. This is not exactly the same as saying that The Iliad is a database-driven hypertext, but it does hint that the storytelling and information systems are not inherently incompatible.  

DissemiNET, by Beth Stryker and Sawad Brooks, is a database-driven compilation of user-defined stories that is searched with a kind of fuzzy 'curatorial', as they put it, that selectivity complements a dynamic visual display to create a compelling portrait of 'The Disappeared' in Guatemala.7 DissemiNET also has parallels to open archives such as The File Room, as anyone can, at least during its initial instailation, upload their stories related to the topic. More than being an open resource, however, it also creates a repository for personal and social memory 'uses web technologies to give visual form to the transactions (deposits, retrievals, and loss) through which we experience memory ... Drawing parallels between diasporas and the dispersal of meaning over the Web'18  

DissemiNET lies somewhere between the particular instance and a composite whole, but it is particularly interesting for the way, not unlike The Unreliable Archivist, the fuzzy algorithm creates relationships among stories - data - as a way to investigate semi-automated storytelling in relation to very large data sets.  

In a slyly funny piece, Anna Karenin Goes to Paradise, Olia Lialina tells the story of Anna Karenin as a comedy in three acts (and an epilogue): Anna looking for love; Anna looking for train; Anna looking for paradise.9 The way Anna looks', naturally, is through Web searches for the words ‘love', 'train and 'paradise'. Lialina culls the results from the search engines Magellan, Yahoo! and Alta Vista into three pages of preselections, and the ‘reader' is invited to get lost on his or her own train of data thoughts before proceeding to the next act. An interesting and somewhat disturbing aspect of the piece is that upward of 90 per cent of the links in the story now return 'page not found' errors, emphasizing, perhaps, not only the ineffability of love but also the ephemerality of the Web.  

Loss is an important aspect of memory, and impermanence may be the natural state of things - and not just on the Web. Noah Waldrop-Fruin's The Impermanence Agent is a remarkable project that starts out as the story of the death of his grandmother, but is designed to disappear.20 As you browse the Web, the impermanence agent replaces Noah's story with snippets of text and images from your browsing, until, finally, the story is completely retold in the words of what you have been reading and looking at, with only the structure of the original storyleftbehind.  

# The Artist as Reliable Archivist  

Museums have always told stories, but there has not always been the opportunity to counter or play with them. For Road to Victory, a project for the Museum of Modern Art's Museum as Muse', Fred Wilson researched MoMA's archives for several years and then used the Web to juxtapose different stories the museum has told over the years. In the first frame of the project, Wilson quotes A. Conger Goodyear, the first president of MoMA: \*The permanent collection will not be unchangeable. It will have somewhat the same permanence a river has.21  

For Wilson, over time MoMA had lost a certain social agenda, which it had originally intended. He wrote about the project: ‘These archival photographs expose the museum's use of didactic material to persuade the public of its liberal point of view as well as its aesthetic ideas.'22 Interestingly, in the very same press release that quotes Wilson, the press speaks about what the project demonstrates exactly and,presumably,unwittingly:  

Fred Wilson's online project, Road to Victory (1999) - titled after the Museum's 1942 exhibition that included photographs of the United States at war - explores The Museum of Modern Art's memory of itself: namely, the institution's photographic archive. Constructing narratives through juxtapositions and connections between documentary images and text borrowed from the archive, Wilson reveals much of what, though visible, is not on display: the Museum's visitors,staff,exhibition graphics and wall texts.23  

There is no hint that the 'museum' in fact remembers the agenda that Wilson is exposing as a lacuna in institutional memory of itself. While Wilson's project is not, strictly speaking, a database, the database imaginary is of a universal database archive, with access to everything by anyone anywhere at any time, which can be used for personal, idiosyncratic and political uses, independent and even counter to its use upon the body politic.

# Young-Hae Chang Heavy Industries  

The Goal is to Transform a Given Zone: In Conversation withPerspektive//2002  

Perspektive Marcel Duchamp inverts a gallery with strings into a totally woven room [exhibition installation for 'First Papers of Surrealism', New York, 1942]. The gallery turns, with playing children and astonished audience, into a room something like a cross between Hakim Bey's TAZ [Temporary Autonomous Zone] and Bilwet's TEZ [Temporary Entertainment Zone]: art as shocking, as entertaining. Young-Hae Chang Heavy Industries are much between these poles, propagating their wish to entertain. Do you think there still exist autonomous zones to work Out a kind of shock experience, or is this near zero room of no importance for you?  

Young-Hae Chang Heavy Industries Artists always work in a given space, which has more or less importance according to the artist. For our work, which is on the Web, the essential importance of the space is at once given - and taken. We accept it and enjoy it as a premise of our work. Is the space itself shocking? It used to be, but as with most things in art, you get used to it. Is our work shocking? Not really. The goal of most artists isn't to find or create an 'autonomous zone' to put their work in. The goal is to transform a given zone or space with the artwork. Sometimes this space is of the utmost banality and dependency. The Internet and Web have become familiar and even boring and sometimes even disagreeable spaces. The web artist's goal is to make them become less familiar, less boring. less disagreeable, to make them become fresh and new again.  

PerspektiveOur'context $^+$ connex' society always wants to get in touch and get linked to everything. Young-Hae Chang Heavy Industries rejects linkage and produces a viewer-island to send you on a journey through text animation and sound. Eric Kluitenberg proclaims that for an avant-garde working today its main purpose is to disrupt and disconnect the hegemonic structures, to smash the surface. Is your reduction to textual and sound elements a kind of smashing of the surface of/on thewebviewer?  

Young-Hae Chang Heavy Industries We suppose so.The computer screen is a superficial support, akin to the surface of a painting. Any web art that employs images tries to create visual depth to this surface. Any web art that employs textual information also tries to create depth, albeit with a strategy similar to making the reader forget he or she is looking at ink on a bound page. In this sense, yes, our work and other textual work tries to smash the surface of the computer screen.  

The music that accompanies our texts also serves to make you forget you're looking at a computer screen. It doesn't necessarily help you to concentrate on the text, in fact it probably makes it more difficult, because music, more than other art genres, makes your mind wander. This then is also a kind of smashing ofthesurface.  

Perspektive Bilwet's data dandy strolled along the hypermedia highways a few years ago as a descendant of Walter Benjamin's flaneur of the arcades. Today the data dandy is more alone, and alone in the 'real existing electronic loneliness' (Bilwet), more encapsuled than before. Your Flash animations simulate the'good old' flaneur moment - a kind of data pointilism. Is Young-Hae Chang Heavy Industries a lost text flaneur and is Flash beauty the last rule to break?  

Young-Hae Chang Heavy Industries We hope so, but we know better. Our greatest desire is that our Flash pieces make you become a flaneur. Flash as the last rule to break, however, is a premature assessment and wishful thinking. Flash and the Web are in their infancy, waiting for Michelangelos to add flesh, muscle and breathtaking movement and beauty to their stick figures. We're still writing on cave walls. However, Lascaux remains very beautiful.

# Angie Waller Ebay Longing: Project Notes//2003  

Ebay, an online auction website, is a crossroads where many people interact, socialize and engage in commerce. A majority of the auctioneers are based in the United States, where the company was founded in 1996. The vibrant virtual community of ebay brought in \$749 million in 2001. The types of goods auctioned off on ebay are infinite, ranging from beanie babies to Malibu estates. The common element to goods listed on the site is that it is not moderated (with a few exceptions), democratic and most often posted by someone living in the Us.  

The project I'm proposing for 'database dilemmas’ stems from searches I conducted two years ago using Afghanistan as the search query. After collecting a few hundred images, I saw the compelling possibility of anthropological study.  

Before the war against Afghanistan began, the posted items were the expected treasures of blue lapis, burkas and sheets of stamps. As the news headlines about the imminent war began to appear, the catalogue of items shifted from memorabilia and souvenirs to American made T-shirts bearing slogans that supported the war, along with bumper stickers and miscellaneous items that the troops were sending back. Through this range and transition of items, it became apparent that all of the items for auction were views of Afghanistan through a distorted lens of American memorabilia. These objects with democratically assigned value reflected an American sentiment through their slow shifts and self-assigned hierarchies.  

Using a perl script to perform search queries, photos of items catalogued under Afghanistan, Iraq and Syria will be collected each evening. These countries were chosen because they reflect three stages in the 'war against terrorism', Afghanistan being the first target and Syria being a possible target in the future. After the images have been collected, they will become part of an online slideshow with an audio component that mixes together news headlines concerning the region, Arabic lessons and Arabic pop music.  

The images collected from each evening's search query will be stored and archived. Over the period of the year that the project is hosted, a timeline of the three regions will be composed. The goals of this timeline are to track how the consumer goods of an online bartering database reflect the sentiment of its activeonlinecommunity.  

This project fits with 'database dilemmas' by utilizing the indexical structure of the ebay database and making a dynamic narrative and historical document from it by reappropriating the information.

# Oliver Laric The Real Thing: In Conversation with Domenico Quaranta//2010  

Domenico Quaranta According to my Google searches, you were born in Leipzig and Innsbruck, you are black and caucasian, and you have said: I usually give fake CVs when I am asked to give a·CV. Recently I started giving real ones.And now?  

Oliver Laric I'm hiring a writer to develop multiple biographies.  

Quaranta In your work there is an interesting balance between transparency and opacity. On the one hand, you reveal little about yourself through your work and your website. On the other hand, however, Versions is probably one of the most straightforward artist's statements I have ever seen. In a way, it is even too much, since it leaves little space for interpretation.  

Laric I enjoy interpretations and mediated experiences: books about books, exhibition catalogues, interpretations of films. Some of my favourite artworks and movies have only been described to me. A description can generate new work while acting as a portrait of the person retelling the idea, plot, etc.  

There is a novel titled The Weather Fifteen Years Ago (2006) by Wolf Haas, written as an interview between a literary critic and the author. There are two layers: the fictional interview and the fictional novel. Over the course of the interview all details of the plot are revealed through the subjective interpretations of both critic and author. Versions is an interpretation open to interpretations. The first incarnation has been reinterpreted by Momus, Dani Admiss and Guthrie Lonergan, and I just found another reinterpretation of the last version on YouTube. They are permanently in a beta state and affect each other. [...]  

Quaranta Using ‘found material' means, for you and many artists of your generation, using the kind of vernacular material (for lack of a better term) you can find in places such as YouTube, 4chan, Flickr, Google and 3D Warehouse. Is the relationship between art and non- art, high culture and popular culture, definitely changing?  

Laric Some of my favourite exhibitions don't make clear distinctions between those fields, incorporating works by journalists, architects, musicians, etc. I think it is a more interesting strategy to curate works, instead of being involved in a scene Or a CV. As VVORK, we were invited to curate part of the Photo Biennale in Mannheim and selected works by photographers that we found on Flickr, Reuters . and stock photography sites, along with the works of artists. It would have been impossible to distinguish the selection. [...]  

Quaranta What's Versions for you?Art or theory?  

Laric A series of sculptures, airbrushed images of missiles, a talk, a PDF, a song, a novel, a recipe, a play, a dance routine, a feature film and merchandise.  

Quaranta Contemporary art is a little niche, but artists with a strong online presence have the possibility of addressing a broader, and very different, audience. How do you deal with it?  

Laric One of the first works I uploaded to my site (787 Cliparts, 2006) spread to numerous other websites. On some days it had more than 30.000 viewers. This was an exciting experience and made me realize that my website is not a space of representation but of primary experiences. You are viewing the real thing. And when the work travels to other sites, it is still the real thing. It also landed on the front page of YouTube. By now there are over 1,500 comments, a type of feedback that I've never experienced in a gallery context. ...]

# Steve Rushton and Rod Dickinson Closed Circuit//2012  

Two podiums are situated centre stage; they are decorated with plaques carrying nondescript insignia. Behind the podiums a line of grey flags run along the back of the stage. Behind the flags hangs a blue curtain. A line of television cameras are situated in front of the stage. Two autocues are situated to the right and left of the podiums. Two middle-aged men (speaker 1 and speaker 2) take their places at the podiums. Their entrance is met with a flurry of flash photography. The autocues roll. Theyspeak in turn.  

Spring  

Speaker 1 Good evening, tonight I want to talk to you on a subject of deep concern to us all and to many people in all parts of the world. United States of America President Richard M.Nixon.Silent Majority'Speech,3 November 1969.The citizens of this country have summoned the change we celebrate today. Yes, you, the citizens have forced the Spring. Now, we must do the work the season demands. UnitedStates ofAmerica PresidentBill Clinton,Inaugural Address,21 January 1993. When I took office, I told the country that my remarks would be just a little straight talk among friends'. Straight talk is what I propose here today in the first of my addresses to the representatives of the world. United States of America President Gerald Ford, Address to the General Assembly of the United Nations, 18 September 1974. No generation can choose the age or circumstance in which it is born, but through leadership it can choose to make the age in which it is born, an age of enlightenment, an age of jobs and peace and justice. United States of America Senator Jesse Jackson, Address to the Democratic National Convention, 18 July 1984. My experience of people the world over is that we all want to be able to live our lives in peace and security; we all want to give our families the chance of a decent life and a future. British Prime Minister Tony Blair, Address to the PeoplesofIraq,10April2003.  

Speaker 2 To be successful, we must change our attitudes as well as our policies. We cannot afford to live beyond our means. We cannot afford to create programmes that we can neither manage nor finance, or to waste our natural resources, and we cannot tolerate mismanagement and fraud. United States of America President Jimmy Carter, State of the Union Address, 23 January 1979.We must face this situation. We should neither lament over the consequences we have suffered due to the circumstances that were unfavourable in our part of the world, nor should we console ourselves with the fact that there are those in this part of the world who live harder than we do, even though the evil time affected them less than us. Our response is a constructive and resolute one. Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic, Inaugural Speech delivered before the Federal Assembly, 23 January 1997. We have been resolute on the rule of law, on the maintenance of order. We must be. And we shall be. Because without an ordered and disciplined society there is no freedom for any of us. We have been resolute on defence. For without national security there is no nation at all. British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, Speech to Conservative Central Council, 27 March 1982.  

Speaker 1 We are are passing through a time of great trial. And the message that we send in the midst of these storms must be clear: that our cause is just, our resolve unwavering. United States of America President Barak Obama, Address to the Nation on the way forward in Afghanistan and Pakistan at United States Military Academy at West Point, 1 December 2009. Our homeland is on the verge of collapse. The achievements of many generations built up from the dust are about to turn into ruins. State structures are ceasing to function. Each day delivers new blows to the waning economy. General Wojciech Jaruzelski, Television address following the imposition of Martial Law in Poland,13 December 1981.Over the past several days, the country has watched the stock market toss and turn. It's important that we understand what is happening and that a calm, sound response be the course we follow. While there were a couple [of] days of gains after several days of losses, we shouldn't assume that the stock market's excess volatility is over. United States of America President Ronald Reagan, News conference in response to the 'Black Monday' stock market crash, 22 0ctober, 1987. [..]  

# Winter  

[... Speaker 2 We keep what is called a disaster unit always ready to respond and always knowing just exactly where the stocks are that we can send in an emergency, either drugs or blankets or warm travelling rugs, warm clothes, food and all medical supplies. British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, Press conference after Armenian earthquake, 8 December 1988. The number of men is not important. The idea is important, the conviction, the will and the firmness. That is the main thing. That is why we believe so firmly that the other nations will free themselves. That is why we believe in the future of this continent and of all continents, for while the difficulties are great, our history proves that they are not great enough to prevent the victory of the people. Cuban President Fidel Castro, Speech to teachers on imperialism and revolution,3 December 1965.  

Speaker 2 Five years ago, a remarkable vision was laid out in this very Hall, a vision which spelled progress and hope for humanity. Leaders from rich and poor nations alike made a bold promise to make history in the fight against hunger, poverty and disease. World Bank President Paul Wolfowitz, Address on development finance at the United Nations, 14 September 2005. Today our people proclaim their faith in the future, unencumbered either by past tragedies or present limitations. If, as we discuss the present, we enlist the past in our service, we do so only to light up our journey into the future. Chairman of the Palestine Liberation Organization Yasser Arafat,Speech before the United Nations General Assembly,13 November1974.

# Editor's acknowledgements  

Thanks are due to colleagues - artists, curators and others - who offered their suggestions on the lacunae in art history as regards new media and informationbased art. The first proper articulation of my interest in containers for information about information-based art was an essay I wrote for Craig Atkinson/Cafe Royal Books' project ‘Index' in 2014 (I want to commission someone to write a short essay about collecting, presenting and displaying communicative ephemera, email if interested', he tweeted). The needed push to pitch the book was from Maeve Connolly when she shared my office that summer as visiting researcher in the Visual Research Centre (VRC) of Dundee Contemporary Arts. Thanks are due to the VRC's secretary, Hazel McDonald, who laboriously copied, scanned and reformatted potential texts, and Karin de Wild, who assisted in transcribing material from audio. Ian Farr was indispensible throughout, especially in clearing a path through the information overload I became bogged down in. Ashley Woodward and Dominic Smith, both at the Philosophy Department of the University of Dundee, helpfully read early drafts of the introduction, and also reassured me that the Kittlerians won't come after me! My gratitude is offered to those artists who permitted the reprinting of their words, and I am indebted to Diana Nemiroff,under whose curatorial direction I first handled the material forms of conceptual art in the Art Metropole Collection storeroom, forever turning me into an accidental archivist of information-art.

Raw data is now the stuff of life- and of art,as this impressive compendium makes plain.But data isnever simply dematerialized or pure;it is always tethered to modesof transmission,storage and embodiment,and the artistsand artworks highlighted here thrillingly explore the things and networks andmedia thathave changed howwe see and what we know in the age of information.'

INFORMATION While information science draws distinctions between information',signals and data,artists from the 196os onward have questioned the validity and value of such boundaries.Artists have investigated information's materiality,in signs,records and traces; its immateriality, in hidden codes,structures and flows;its embodiment,in instructions, social interaction and political agency;its overload,or uncontrollable excess,challenging utopian notions of networked society;its potential for misinformation and disinformation, subliminally altering our perceptions; and its post-digital unruliness,unsettling fixed notions of history and place.  

Information is one of a series documenting major themes and ideas in contemporary art
