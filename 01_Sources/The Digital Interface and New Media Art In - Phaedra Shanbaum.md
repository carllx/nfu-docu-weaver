# []{#front1.xhtml#page_i .pagebreak title="i"} **The Digital Interface and New Media Art Installations**

This book is about the digital interface and its use in interactive new media art installations. It examines the aesthetic aspects of the interface through a theoretical exploration of new media artists, who create, and tactically deploy, digital interfaces in their work in order to question the socio-cultural stakes of a technology that shapes and reshapes relationships between humans and non-humans. In this way, it shows how use of the digital interface provides us with a critical framework for understanding our relationship with technology.

**Phaedra Shanbaum** is Lecturer in Digital Arts and Media Education at UCL Knowledge Lab, UCL Institute of Education, University College London, UK.

[Art at the Interface](#content.xhtml#bck_Ch101)

![figs0_1and0_2.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/iccXTf7.jpeg)

This book is concerned with the digital interface, its multiple uses in interactive new media art installations and its so-called disappearance from them. In it, I focus on the theoretical disappearance of the object-based digital interface, its re-emergence as human body and the issues related to power, control, and ownership that follow it in these environments. I examine the aesthetic aspects of the interface -- specifically how they are defined and used in fine arts environments -- exploring what artistic experimentation with digital interfaces might reveal about the changing relationship between humans and technology. My main argument is that the digital interface, as it is currently defined, as an instrument that acts and reacts to human input is inadequate. The digital interface is a necessary and important condition of everyday life, in that it forms, informs and structures our relationship with technology. Thus, the digital interface matters and a critical investigation into the aesthetic aspects of the device in digital artworks can help us understand and possibly reconfigure our relationship with technology. My investigation begins with a visit to the Victoria and Albert Museum in London, UK. The purpose of this particular visit is to get a group of undergraduate digital media arts students to engage with digital media art in person. The trip includes a viewing of new media art collective Random International's interactive installation [Swarm Study / III]{.italic} (2011).^[1](#Ch101.xhtml#fn101_1){#Ch101.xhtml#bck_fn101_1}^

[]{#Ch101.xhtml#page_3 .pagebreak title="3"}[Swarm Study / III]{.italic} is installed in the ceiling directly above the stairway that connects the architecture gallery to the ceramics wing.^[2](#Ch101.xhtml#fn101_2){#Ch101.xhtml#bck_fn101_2}^ It consists of a series of brass rods covered in LED lights, a computer and closed-circuit cameras. The rods are arranged in a grid-like formation. They are suspended from the ceiling and placed in four large cubes.^[3](#Ch101.xhtml#fn101_3){#Ch101.xhtml#bck_fn101_3}^ The students stand in the landing and stare at the work. The most daring of the group step forward and slowly begin their ascent up the staircase. The cameras immediately detect the students' movements and the piece is activated -- its lights turn on. As the students walk up and down the staircase, the lights follow them, moving from rod to rod, from cube to cube, flickering off and on. Soon, all the students are interacting with the artwork. Some even go so far as to attempt to "break" it.

"Breaking" the piece is relatively easy. [Swarm Study / III]{.italic} runs on a cybernetic action/reaction loop. It tracks and records the action occurring below it and then produces a pre-programmed reaction to it in real-time.^[4](#Ch101.xhtml#fn101_4){#Ch101.xhtml#bck_fn101_4}^ The action being tracked and recorded is the students walking up and down the stairs at a standard gallery visitor pace. The pre-programmed reaction the artwork produces takes the form of blinking lights, which resemble swarming patterns found in nature.^[5](#Ch101.xhtml#fn101_5){#Ch101.xhtml#bck_fn101_5}^ Given this, all the students have to do to "break" the work is to intervene in the cybernetic action/reaction loop. They do this by running up and down the stairs, instead of walking at a standard gallery visitor pace. This action is a particularly effective form of intervention because if the students are moving too fast, the camera cannot track them and record data. If there is no recorded data, then there is no action: therefore, there can be no reaction. If there is no reaction, then there is no art, as the art is the pre-programmed reaction (swarming) to the action (movement).

After interacting with [Swarm Study / III]{.italic} for a short period of time, we begin to discuss the artwork. We briefly talk about issues related to surface-level aesthetics (representation, expression, form). These questions lead to a conversation around the conceptual idea behind the artwork. The exercise culminates in a discussion about interactivity and interfaces -- specifically, what interaction and interfaces mean to this work. How and why is interaction is deployed? What kind of transformation does interaction bring about? And, most important, what [causes]{.italic} it to work? What is the thing that allows interaction to occur, that reveals the artwork to you? What is the interface in [Swarm Study / III]{.italic}? The answers the students give to the final question are all the same: "Our bodies," they exclaim, "are the interfaces in this work because our bodies are the things that make the lights on the piece turn on and off!" The students are correct. Their bodies [are]{.italic} the things that allow them to interact with the piece and reveals the artwork to them. Their bodies [are]{.italic} the interfaces in [Swarm Study / III]{.italic}.[Swarm Study / III]{.italic} and the students' responses to it show [why]{.italic} the deployment of the interface in interactive new media installations matters to new media art and to contemporary society. The interface matters because it is representative of the increasingly messy relationship between bodies, spaces, and technologies in Western culture. For instance, when embedded into environments and rendered imperceptible, like it is in [Swarm Study / III]{.italic}, the interface allows us to re-imagine what a body, be it human, technological or something in between, actually is or can possibly become, hence the students' response: "our bodies are the interface." The "disappearance" of the object-based digital interface and its emergence as human body in interactive new media installations points to what I will argue to be the particular potential of creative uses of the interface in interactive new media installations to intervene in and possibly destabilize conventional structures and narratives around digital media technology. []{#Ch101.xhtml#page_4 .pagebreak title="4"}This intervention is significant, because when interfaces are positioned, in academic and popular rhetoric, as invisible, shape-shifting things -- when they "vanish into the background" and then suddenly re-emerge as human bodies -- they become a matter of control and regulation. More precisely, they become a matter of power and control over bodies as well as a matter of regulation of communication, interaction, knowledge, and movement in time and space in both interactive new media installations and in everyday life. By investigating how interfaces exert control over bodies, as well as regulate communication, interaction, knowledge, and movement, I also examine what artistic experimentation with interfaces might reveal about the changing relationship between humans and technology.^[6](#Ch101.xhtml#fn101_6){#Ch101.xhtml#bck_fn101_6}^ In this way, this book is not an account of what technological devices like interfaces are or may be; rather, it is about what bodies, both human and non-human, are, who regulates the shape or form they assume and who controls the narratives around them.

My exploration of the digital interface is based on the belief that the interface is an important concept and device in new media art -- a proposition which should form a significant part of any analysis of artworks that incorporate interfaces, interactive or otherwise. This assumption is based on Kate Mondloch's (2010) statement: "the interface 'matters' for media installation art."^[7](#Ch101.xhtml#fn101_7){#Ch101.xhtml#bck_fn101_7}^ Mondloch's statement resonates with some of the questions about the importance of the interface in interactive new media installations: what types of relationships exist between artists, interfaces, and the subjects interacting with them? Why do these relationships matter? Why does the interface matter in interactive new media installations? My overall aim is thus twofold: to introduce a different approach to the study of the interface by examining its use in aesthetic contexts, and to interrogate why the aesthetic processes that bring it into being actually matter in interactive new media installations.

## [[What Is a Digital Interface?]{.bold}](#content.xhtml#bck_sec101_1) {#Ch101.xhtml#sec101_1}

The word "interface," Seung-hoon Jeong (2013) writes, became popular in the field of computer science in the 1960s, referring to the "interface between machine components (hardware or software) and/or the point between these technical machines and human users."^[8](#Ch101.xhtml#fn101_8){#Ch101.xhtml#bck_fn101_8}^ What started out as a word that was used to describe a purely technical device studied by a closed circle of engineers and scientists has now become a buzzword that has been applied to a variety of different entities, processes, and relations.^[9](#Ch101.xhtml#fn101_9){#Ch101.xhtml#bck_fn101_9}^ Interfaces can be anything from tangible objects to human body parts, and to graphic designs. The word "interface" can also denote methods of technological exchange and modes of communication.

Florian Cramer and Matthew Fuller (2008) provide a more detailed classification, identifying five different types of interfaces: (1) hardware that connects users to hardware; (2) hardware that connects hardware to hardware; (3) software or hardware-embedded logic that connects hardware to software; (4) software that connects software to software (APIs); and (5) symbolic and linguistic handles, which make software accessible to users via text, sounds, visual representations or the re-appropriation of familiar physical objects -- otherwise known as "the user interface" (UI).^[10](#Ch101.xhtml#fn101_10){#Ch101.xhtml#bck_fn101_10}^ Cramer and Fuller's typology of the interface will be discussed below, along with a more in-depth theorization of the interface. For now, it is important to note that it is the last definition, the symbolic and linguistic handles which make software accessible to users, (the UI) which is the focus of this []{#Ch101.xhtml#page_5 .pagebreak title="5"}book. This is because it is the most commonly deployed in interactive new media installations.

Since opening up to a more general population, theoretical research on the interface has also seen a surge in volume. The result of this surge is that we now have access to a great deal of information about the interface in various contexts -- for instance, about what it is and what it does in computer science, in science and technology studies (STS), and, to an extent, in the humanities (Ishii and Ullmer, 1997; Blackwell, 2006; Cramer and Fuller, 2008; Dourish and Bell, 2011). However, much less is known about the digital interface in interactive new media installations. What exactly is a digital interface? And what does it actually do in interactive new media installations? Although earlier writings on this subject exist (Dinkla, 1994; Penny et al., 2001), and although new texts appear in this area annually (Mondloch, 2010; Andersen and Pold, 2011; Galloway, 2012; Jeong, 2013; Farman, 2013; Emerson, 2014; Hookway, 2014; Andersen and Pold, 2018), as it stands, we simply do not know enough about the interface and its use in interactive new media art installations.

Yet what is an interactive new media installation? And why is the use of the interface in these environments important? Nathaniel Stern (2013) raises a series of similar questions. Is interactive art a genre? A movement? A medium?^[11](#Ch101.xhtml#fn101_11){#Ch101.xhtml#bck_fn101_11}^ Does the fact that these works are interactive and employ interfaces somehow make them more democratic, and subjects' interactions with them more individualistic? Are they institutionally based, screen-bound and purely visual? Or can they exist outside the gallery walls and engage all of our senses? The answers to these questions, as Stern concludes, are contextual.^[12](#Ch101.xhtml#fn101_12){#Ch101.xhtml#bck_fn101_12}^ They are contextual because they provide descriptions of individual artworks rather than concrete definitions of a medium or genre. Given this, the phrase "interactive new media art installation" does not fulfill a unified set of technical or aesthetic criteria. Instead, it is a blanket term that covers a broad range of complex and diverse gallery-based installations that incorporate digital technology, and that require the subject to act, and the piece to respond, in various ways to this activity.

For instance, some interactive new media installations, such as Char Davies's [Osmoses]{.italic} (1998), are site-specific, fully immersive, virtual-reality environments that require subjects to don head-mounted displays (HMDs) and data gloves to view and interact with them.^[13](#Ch101.xhtml#fn101_13){#Ch101.xhtml#bck_fn101_13}^ Others, like Feng Mengbo's [Q4U]{.italic} (2002), are large-scale, augmented reality-based installations that ask subjects to interact with the work through an object-based digital interface.^[14](#Ch101.xhtml#fn101_14){#Ch101.xhtml#bck_fn101_14}^ And some, like Janet Cardiff and George Bures Miller's [Experiment in F\# Minor]{.italic} (2013), are mixed media installations that incorporate subjects into the installation through the deployment of technology like closed-circuit cameras, light sensors, and custom-designed algorithms.^[15](#Ch101.xhtml#fn101_15){#Ch101.xhtml#bck_fn101_15}^

While definitions and categories can be, as Christiane Paul (2003) explains, "helpful in identifying certain distinguishing characteristics of a medium," they can also be detrimental in that they create limits for approaching and understanding a very diverse and complex art form.^[16](#Ch101.xhtml#fn101_16){#Ch101.xhtml#bck_fn101_16}^ In light of this, I use the following definition of interactive new media installations: interactive new media installations are technologically based artworks that require subjects to make a physical contribution to the completion of the artwork via interaction with a digital interface. While the interfaces located in these works can be defined as points of juncture or modes of communication between different entities, they encompass much, much more.

For example, digital interfaces are also symbolic in that they deploy visual and linguistic metaphors (file-folders as icons, the word "desktop" to describe the objects []{#Ch101.xhtml#page_6 .pagebreak title="6"}located on computer screens) that, as Cramer and Fuller argue, are used to "hide, and condition the asymmetry between the elements conjoined" as well as describe the "condensations of computational power that computers embody."^[17](#Ch101.xhtml#fn101_17){#Ch101.xhtml#bck_fn101_17}^ Thus, they posit "the term interface emphasizes the representation or the re-articulation of a process occurring at another scalar layer."^[18](#Ch101.xhtml#fn101_18){#Ch101.xhtml#bck_fn101_18}^ Interfaces, for Cramer and Fuller, are not just tools for facilitating connections; they are also processes that "articulate, filter, and organize the activities modelled and modulated by the interface."^[19](#Ch101.xhtml#fn101_19){#Ch101.xhtml#bck_fn101_19}^

My own investigation into the interface in interactive new media installations builds on the research summarized above. It starts out, in the same way that Cramer and Fuller's work does, from a recognition of the fact that the interface plays an increasingly important role in mediating and translating, and thus, to an extent, governing, the subject's activities in interactive new media installations. Following on from this, the main objective of this book is to develop an understanding of how the interface can be seen as an important actor in positioning and (re)shaping specific ways of relating to the subject, to technology, to artistic practice and to others. In simpler terms, I am not so much concerned with providing a [technical]{.italic} description of what the digital interface does or [can]{.italic} do (although this issue is important and will be discussed); I am primarily interested in examining what a digital interface [may be]{.italic}, and in exploring potential ways of thinking and doing that it could possibly bring about when theorized in non-instrumental ways, from within aesthetic contexts.

Throughout this book, I propose a more expansive definition of the digital interface in interactive new media installations, positioning it as a dynamic, hybrid, aesthetic and cultural process. The interface then is a threshold, a mediator, and a boundary, but in a more complex sense than something that allows a viewer/participant access to a distinct space, a technological instrument that controls an entity's behavior, or a device that shows us glimpses of something (an image, a snippet of code, an artistic practice). With this, I draw on Lori Emerson's (2014) definition of the interface as a technology that mediates relationships between entities and the aesthetic objects they produce, as well as the technical machine-based processes that take place below the surface.^[20](#Ch101.xhtml#fn101_20){#Ch101.xhtml#bck_fn101_20}^ I take Emerson's definition further, suggesting that the interface mediates, and therefore creates relationships, between viewer/participants, artists and artworks as well as influencing the movements and perceptions of those interacting with it. In this way, I am not simply proposing a more expansive definition of the digital interface in interactive new media installations; I also critically question the relationship between art, technology and viewer/participants. Specifically, I look at how this relationship establishes systems of interaction, forms of spectatorship, and modes of thinking, and how the rising popularity of the interface, and the disappearance of it, informs the conditions of contemporary new media artistic practice.

## [[A Brief History of Digital Art]{.bold}](#content.xhtml#bck_sec101_2) {#Ch101.xhtml#sec101_2}

Compiling any kind of book on any facet of digital media art, as Paul (2016) tells us, is both a challenge and an impossibility.^[21](#Ch101.xhtml#fn101_21){#Ch101.xhtml#bck_fn101_21}^ The field of digital media art is vast and the terminology used to describe it is constantly in flux. Given this, it is, she writes, "inconceivable to cover all the histories, expressions and implications of digital art in one volume."^[22](#Ch101.xhtml#fn101_22){#Ch101.xhtml#bck_fn101_22}^ The first and most significant challenge scholars encounter when creating these texts, as Paul states, is defining the art form and delineating its territory.^[23](#Ch101.xhtml#fn101_23){#Ch101.xhtml#bck_fn101_23}^ Digital media art is a hybrid medium. The term is used interchangeably with []{#Ch101.xhtml#page_7 .pagebreak title="7"}the phrase "new media art" both in this book and in everyday parlance. The difference between the terms lies in their associations. Digital media art refers to works of art that use digital technologies at some point during the artist's creative practice, the artistic process or gallery and museum presentation. New media art is a subcategory of digital media art; it refers to artworks that exploit particular properties of digital media technologies and use them as a medium, rather than as a tool to automate previous artistic processes and practices (i.e. software like Photoshop, Maya, and After Effects).

New media art has an extraordinarily complex, cross-disciplinary and multifaceted history that interweaves several strands of artistic practice and artistic movements with different industrial and computer-based technologies and technological innovations.^[24](#Ch101.xhtml#fn101_24){#Ch101.xhtml#bck_fn101_24}^ One of these histories, Paul writes, "can be traced from early instruction-based conceptual practices like those found in the Dada and Fluxus movements to "algorithmic" art forms that set up open technological systems. Another lineage links concepts of light and moving image from early kinetic and op art to new cinematic forms."^[25](#Ch101.xhtml#fn101_25){#Ch101.xhtml#bck_fn101_25}^ Another path, I would argue, connects notions of performativity, audience participation and embodied interaction found in early feminist, performance, and body art that rely on what Amelia Jones (1998) terms "interpretation-as-exchange" to early cyberart works that require the audience to make a contribution of some sort to the completion of the art work.^[26](#Ch101.xhtml#fn101_26){#Ch101.xhtml#bck_fn101_26}^ However, unlike in some body art performances, audience participation and embodied interaction in new media art is not meant to decenter Cartesian subjectivity or challenge notions of exclusionism and Kantian disinterestedness found in conventional art history and criticism (although some new media artists do deploy interactivity in their installations for exactly these reasons).^[27](#Ch101.xhtml#fn101_27){#Ch101.xhtml#bck_fn101_27}^ Instead, interactivity is used, by some new media artists, in order to comment on the use of computer-based technology in contemporary society. In this way interactive new media installations can be seen as self-referential, in that they comment on or critique themselves.

It is imperative to note here that the lineages briefly sketched above are not distinct strands and the artworks that compose the corpus of digital media art were not created in isolation. Rather, they run in parallel to each other and are non-sequential. Thus, the history of digital media art should be seen, as Paul suggests, as a set of interconnected narratives and processes that feed back on each other and intersect at certain points.^[28](#Ch101.xhtml#fn101_28){#Ch101.xhtml#bck_fn101_28}^ Interactive new media art installations are experimental, and contain non-linear and open-ended narratives, forms, modes of interaction, interfaces, and sometimes creators -- or works in which these elements are put into different and critical relationships. The artists creating these installations achieve this by creatively pushing forward both the technical and formal aspects of the medium through a juxtaposition of aesthetics, computation and bodies (both human and technological), and creatively exploring the relationship between the three. The interconnectivity and non-linearity found in digital media art is reflected in my approach to the artworks theorized in this book, which is non-linear and non-chronological.

Chronological and linear timelines of art movements can be helpful in that they dispel, to an extent, notions of newness. They do this by historicizing artworks and concepts that, as Oliver Grau (2007) states, are "frequently encountered \[by the viewer/participant\] for the first time" and presented to them as utopian or visionary models of the world.^[29](#Ch101.xhtml#fn101_29){#Ch101.xhtml#bck_fn101_29}^ As helpful as these accounts may be, chronological and linear accounts of media and technology have their problems. The first problem is they limit, as Sarah Kember and Joanna Zylinska (2012) write, "the understanding of complex and []{#Ch101.xhtml#page_8 .pagebreak title="8"}multifaceted phenomena and processes by imposing clear-cut distinctions and categories all too early."^[30](#Ch101.xhtml#fn101_30){#Ch101.xhtml#bck_fn101_30}^ The second, they state, is that linear accounts suggest finality, thus inscribing, to an extent, technologically based mediums into linear developmental narratives of media and technology.^[31](#Ch101.xhtml#fn101_31){#Ch101.xhtml#bck_fn101_31}^ In this way, something (an artwork, an artist, a media technological innovation) always gets left out. Recognizing the limitations around linear and chronological timelines presented above, I chose to take a non-linear and non-chronological approach to the artwork discussed throughout this book. My primary reason for employing such an approach is that it allows me to raise questions about more traditional perceptions of interfaces as a series of isolated, spatialized technical objects (a mouse, a keyboard). Furthermore, it allows me to question dominant perceptions of new media art as a medium -- that is, a linear by-product of technologically based art forms like photography and cinema only. Questioning these perceptions challenges traditional Western notions of art history and criticisms which claim that technologically based art is simply a visual process, production or sensation, allowing different, more performative and body-based lineages of the movement to come to the fore.

Given the current state of the contemporary art world, this challenge may seem slightly outdated. Many different scholars, from N. Katherine Hayles (1999a, 2017) and Amelia Jones (2006, 2012) to Nathanial Stern (2013) and Kate Mondloch (2018), have stressed the importance that the body and embodiment play in new media art. However, I must emphasize the fact that new media art goes beyond the visual register that contemporary art history, criticism, and society tends to operate on. Indeed, the brief history of new media art illustrated above shows the vital role performative and body-based art movements play in shaping contemporary new media art practices, as well as how these movements inform the embodied register on which new media art tends to circulate, in the art world and beyond. So, while the majority of the interactive new media art installations discussed throughout this book are visual, screen-bound and gallery-based, it is important to note that performance and body-based art practices have had a significant impact on the history of new media art. In short, interactive new media installations are not exclusively visual. New media art creates embodied and performative modes of existence and identification. Therefore, new media art as a movement is heavily influenced by embodied and performative art practices.

## [[Chapter Summaries]{.bold}](#content.xhtml#bck_sec101_3) {#Ch101.xhtml#sec101_3}

The chapters in this book are all about digital interfaces. I have identified six distinguishable yet interrelated theoretical iterations of digital interfaces commonly deployed in interactive new media installations: the aesthetic interface, the agential interface, the embodied interface, the cybernetic interface, the ubiquitous interface and the implanted interface. These interfaces, briefly discussed below, directly relate to the six key concepts (aesthetics, agency, embodiment, cybernetics, ubiquity, and interiority) that inform my study.

::: {.section}
### [[Chapter 1: The Aesthetic Interface]{.italic}]{.bold} {#Ch101.xhtml#sec101_3_1}

Aesthetics in this book is very broadly defined as a philosophical mode of engagement with, and experience of, art. I draw on Sean Cubitt's (1998, 2005, 2016) []{#Ch101.xhtml#page_9 .pagebreak title="9"}understandings of digital aesthetics as the mediated experience of time to theorize this concept.^[32](#Ch101.xhtml#fn101_32){#Ch101.xhtml#bck_fn101_32}^ My theorization of the aesthetic interface expands on Cubitt's understanding of digital aesthetics, suggesting that aesthetics does not just shape our experience of digital artworks; it also shapes our interactions with, and our experience of, the interface. In suggesting this, my interest in the aesthetic interface feeds into a more theoretical concern around how we might begin to make sense of the interface in interactive new media installations as a field of critical inquiry, as a cultural problem to be examined, rather than a technology to be studied. My exploration of the aesthetic interface is therefore not about the object itself; rather, it is about the systems -- technological, philosophical, embodied, and socio-political -- that permit, shape, and produce the interface and the wider issues such as interaction and agency that surround it. In short, aesthetics is about the mediated experience of time that the relationship between the artist, the artwork, the interface and the audience creates. When applied to the interface, aesthetics then encompasses everything below the surface of its shiny exterior, everything that is invisible to the human eye, but that remains inseparable from the interface -- and without which the latter would not exist. In this way, I seek to contribute to an understanding of the aesthetics of the interface in terms of how they came to be and what they have or will become via a critical exploration of the processes built into them -- as well as our comprehension of them as art objects.
:::

::: {.section}
### [[Chapter 2: The Embodied Interface]{.italic}]{.bold} {#Ch101.xhtml#sec101_3_2}

Current interface aesthetics, as Jeong (2013) writes, "emphasizes that the material interface with digital code often remains meaningless until we access it through our physiological sensory organs."^[33](#Ch101.xhtml#fn101_33){#Ch101.xhtml#bck_fn101_33}^ The embodied interface augments this point of view, suggesting that the viewer/participant is not only accessing information, through participation, but contributing aspects of her own evolving material ontology to her experience through her engagement with and embodiment of technology. Following insights provided by Amelia Jones (2012) and Jean-Luc Nancy (2000) among others, I investigate how the use of the embodied interface in aesthetic settings can illuminate the role technology plays in the co-constitution of the human. In other words, I investigate how the use of the interface in interactive new media installations positions the relationship between the body and technology as a co-constitutive and collaboratively produced experience. The relationship between the body and technology in interactive new media installations, I argue, is unstable, uncertain and to a certain extent open to reconfiguration by the viewer/participant. Instability signals the fact that the interactions that emerge out of the relationship between the viewer/participant and the digital interface are dynamic, open-ended and performed. In doing this, I offer a different understanding of the relationship between the viewer/participant and the digital interface -- one that allows these relationships to come into view as in-process happenings that emerge out of, and with, the viewer/participants' interactions with the interface in interactive new media installations. I then focus on the effects and events that this performance produces. Through a close reading of interactive artworks (Feingold, 1997; Kaufman, 2004; Vesna, 2005--7; Tmema, 2006), I demonstrate that it is the specific events and effects that the relationship between the body and technology helps create that bring the digital interface into being, thus allowing it to actually "matter" in interactive new media installations.

### []{#Ch101.xhtml#page_10 .pagebreak title="10"} [[Chapter 3: The Agential Interface]{.italic}]{.bold} {#Ch101.xhtml#sec101_3_3}

This chapter seeks to contribute an understanding of the multiple types of agency, as well as bodies, at play in the articulation of the interface in interactive new media installations. Through this, it aims to offer an expansion of the notions of agency beyond their traditional humanist conceptualizations. Here, new media installations become a testing ground for this conceptual expansion. Bernard Stiegler (1998) states that Western philosophy "at its very origin and up until now ... has repressed technics as an object of thought. Technics is the unthought."^[34](#Ch101.xhtml#fn101_34){#Ch101.xhtml#bck_fn101_34}^ He posits that ideas about technology in Western philosophy are constituted on the basis of a false separation between the philosophical concepts of [episteme]{.italic} (human knowledge) and [techne]{.italic} (art or craft). This separation has led Western philosophy to devalue technology and the technical. The devaluation of technology, as well as the separation of [episteme]{.italic} from [techne]{.italic}, means, among other things, that "technical beings" lack an ontological status.^[35](#Ch101.xhtml#fn101_35){#Ch101.xhtml#bck_fn101_35}^ Arguing against these configurations, Stiegler posits that humans have access to "originary knowledge."^[36](#Ch101.xhtml#fn101_36){#Ch101.xhtml#bck_fn101_36}^ For this reason, he states that humans can only experience themselves through technology.^[37](#Ch101.xhtml#fn101_37){#Ch101.xhtml#bck_fn101_37}^ No longer seen as an instrument tacked onto the outside of the body, technology destabilizes notions of the "originary human," instrumentality, and interiority. Thus, he concludes that humans have never been, and can never be, separate from technology because they are fundamentally constituted by technology.^[38](#Ch101.xhtml#fn101_38){#Ch101.xhtml#bck_fn101_38}^

Stiegler's critique of traditional conceptualizations of technology assumes a particular importance in the context of this chapter. This is because his statements about "technical beings" lacking an ontological status raise important questions about the agency of the non-human to the fore. Significantly, a central premise in both Stiegler's argument and this chapter is that agency is not merely confined to humans in the classic Aristotelian sense, but encompasses the non-human as well. Given this, questions explored are related to the agency of the self and of others in interactive new media installations. Agency of the self and of others are complicated and, to an extent, reconfigured by the complex dynamics of both the non-human and human entities that make up the digital interface and interactive new media installations. In simpler terms, there are multiple agents and agencies (both non-human and human) at play in the construction and deployment of interfaces in interactive new media installations. These agents and agencies are not neutral; rather, I argue they aid in the articulation and construction of the way in which subjects conceptualize and classify entities, as well as the way in which they experience and interact with interfaces in interactive new media art installations.

### [[Chapter 4: Instruction and the Interface]{.italic}]{.bold} {#Ch101.xhtml#sec101_3_4}

This chapter provides an analytic framework for investigating how instruction is executed and inscribed, as a method of power and control, in interactive new media installations through the cybernetic interface. The cybernetic interface is viewed as a mode of transmitting instruction by the artist to the subject. It is often theorized in terms of the power that instruction has in controlling the actions of its subjects. The interface may be regarded as a cybernetic tool that simply controls interaction, limits access and regulates viewing habits. But its nature changes, to an extent, when deployed in interactive new media installations, as viewer/participants have the ability []{#Ch101.xhtml#page_11 .pagebreak title="11"}to resist or intervene in the instruction given and generate moments of rupture in the spaces they are located in. The focus, I suggest, shifts from the cybernetic transference of immaterial data to the embodied actions of the viewer/participant. When this shift occurs, the viewer/participant, rather than the interface, becomes the locus of interaction in interactive new media installations. Given this, I suggest that when deployed in certain interactive new media installations, the cybernetic interface can provide options for viewer/participant intervention via resistance and/or subversion of instruction.

I explore how the resistance to and subversion of instruction can alter the dominant metaphors and models used in interactive new media installations. My argument is that viewer/participant resistance has the ability to allow for certain destabilizing effects, such as the creation of a different dialogue between the viewer/participant and the digital interface through the modification of the underlying frameworks that compose the relationship between the human and the machine. The emergence of a different type of dialogue between the viewer/participant and the digital interface does not occur because the actions that the viewer/participant makes with the digital interface are somehow different. Instead, drawing on Jones's (2001) theorization of new technologies, I argue that this dialogue has appeared because the conceptual frameworks for understanding the relationship between the body and technology have changed.^[39](#Ch101.xhtml#fn101_39){#Ch101.xhtml#bck_fn101_39}^

### [[Chapters 5 and 6: The Ubiquitous Interface]{.italic}]{.bold} {#Ch101.xhtml#sec101_3_5}

Ubicomp, according to Mark Weiser (1991), refers to the seamless integration of technology into every place, object, building, and body.^[40](#Ch101.xhtml#fn101_40){#Ch101.xhtml#bck_fn101_40}^ Weiser posits that technology must become an integrated tool through which we work, rather than an attention-grabbing machine that performs and dictates tasks and actions. He continues by stating that focusing the subject's attention away from the "single box" allows technology to "fade into the background," thus rendering it invisible.^[41](#Ch101.xhtml#fn101_41){#Ch101.xhtml#bck_fn101_41}^ This invisibility, he states, results in the formation of "new" relationships between humans and machines -- relationships that focus on smaller details instead of foregrounding the "attractiveness" of the technology being used.^[42](#Ch101.xhtml#fn101_42){#Ch101.xhtml#bck_fn101_42}^ Attractiveness, for Weiser, refers to technology that makes itself the center of attention. Thus, the attractiveness of technology for Weiser is troublesome because attractiveness "is the opposite of invisible."^[43](#Ch101.xhtml#fn101_43){#Ch101.xhtml#bck_fn101_43}^

Theories of technology that promote invisibility, as N. Katherine Hayles (1999a) posits, are worrisome because they render the human body as excess "meat" and treat human consciousness as something separate from the human form.^[44](#Ch101.xhtml#fn101_44){#Ch101.xhtml#bck_fn101_44}^ Yet the art world has adopted ubicomp narratives and applied them to the interface in interactive new media installations. Narratives, in particular those around disembodiment exposed by Hayles in 1999, have resurfaced as notions of disappearance and are used to describe interfaces in interactive new media installations. The adoption of these theories is highly problematic, not only because of the disembodiment that comes with them, but also because they erase the aesthetic processes and relationships (i.e. the attractiveness) that bring them into being. This is an act that, I suggest, widens the separation between the art work and the subject, the artist and technology. Interfaces are not separate objects created by the artist that subjects use to navigate an installation or view images; rather, the interface has productive capacities, and these capacities appear not merely through mediating "the world," or disappearing from it, but through the subject's ability to interact in conjunction with and embody it.

### []{#Ch101.xhtml#page_12 .pagebreak title="12"} [[Chapter 7: The Implanted Interface]{.italic}]{.bold} {#Ch101.xhtml#sec101_3_6}

This chapter concludes my exploration of the use of the interface in interactive new media installations through a study of the implanted interface. It examines what interfaces mean when they are implanted into human bodies, what happens to these implanted bodies when they materialize through artistic practice and how they may reconfigure, or not, our human relationship with technology. The rhetoric that surrounds the implant, like the rhetoric that surrounds the interfaces in the previous chapters, I argue has the tendency to reduce the human body and its embodied experience to a set of 1's and 0's. It does this by linking the outside of the body to the inside in an attempt to render it transparent and, in some cases, to erase bodies that do not conform to normalized standards. However, I also suggest that the implant holds the same potential as the digital interface when used in interactive new media installations. It has the ability to allow the viewer/participant to begin to (re)configure the key concepts of agency, identity, embodiment, and the self in these environments. Two interactive new media installations, Eduardo Kac's [Time Capsule]{.italic} and Neil Harbisson's [Internet of Senses]{.italic} (2014), are explored in this chapter. By literally implanting an interface into their bodies, these works showcase humanist myths of wholeness (of the body, of the human) and innocence (of technology) in their work, and, in doing so, they demonstrate the fact that that agency, autonomy, and embodiment are not universal concepts.

# [[1 []{#Ch01.xhtml#page_14 .pagebreak title="14"}The Aesthetic Interface]{.bold}](#content.xhtml#bck_Ch01) {#Ch01.xhtml#Ch01}

In this chapter, I propose a rethinking of the digital interface in interactive new media installations in aesthetic and processual terms. I outline what is at stake in my rethinking, suggesting that the digital interface can be understood as an open-ended series of relational, reciprocal, and co-constitutive processes that influence the movements and perceptions of the viewer/participant(s) interacting with it. With this theorization, I offer an alternative to previously posited notions of the interface outlined by scholars such as Paul Dourish (2001; Dourish and Bell, 2011), Mark B.N. Hansen (2004, 2006, 2013) and to a certain extent Anne Friedberg (2006), Alexander Galloway (2012) and Kate Mondloch (2010, 2018), among others. These texts are invaluable to this study as they begin to critically evaluate what it means to be a viewing subject in a modern technologically based society, as well as question the interface's function as a device that facilitates yet also impedes interaction, mediates experience, and attempts to maintain a fantasy of control over unpredictable computerized systems. However, interfaces, in these texts, tend to be defined and consequently positioned in binary terms. Thus, the interface becomes either an active, yet empty technological object that frames experience, or something that acts as a boundary between the viewer/participant and the virtual world that the interface helps simulate. My approach to the digital interface differs from those offered by the previously mentioned authors, as it resists the structural terms of simplistic binaries listed above. These binary-based approaches are problematic because they do not provide an adequate critical language for describing contemporary digital technologies, like the interface in interactive new media installations. Therefore, my theorization of the digital interface is significant because it situates complex technological objects---which are deeply entangled with notions of relationality, hybridity, and subjectivity---within an aesthetic and cultural framework.

What exactly is at stake in proposing an alternative theory of the digital interface? How does this theory challenge previously posited notions of interactivity, media spec-tatorship, and aesthetics? How might these challenges change the way in which we engage with and theorize the relationship between humans and technology in interactive new media installations? These questions will be addressed through a focus on the importance of aesthetic inquiry, the link between theories of media spectatorship and interaction, and on how these theories can be applied to the digital interface in interactive new media installations. The aesthetics of the interface will be developed in relation to Sean Cubitt's (2016) and Christiane Paul's (2016) understandings of digital aesthetics. Questions of media spectatorship and interactivity will be discussed in reference to the interface's visual presence in interactive new media installations []{#Ch01.xhtml#page_15 .pagebreak title="15"}and in relation to the viewer/participant's embodied interactions with it. In the final section, I draw on new media artist Stelarc's notion of obsolescence, arguing that previously posited theories of the interface are inadequate; thus, they need to be not so much revised as critically repositioned in relation to the role that the aesthetics of the interface plays in interactive new media installations.

## [[Toward a Digital Aesthetic of the Interface]{.bold}](#content.xhtml#bck_sec1_1) {#Ch01.xhtml#sec1_1}

The word "aesthetics" is rooted in ancient Greek, originally referring to "sensation." Its meaning has been broadened over time and has become attached to physical and phenomenological sensations, objects that encapsulate these sensations, and the emotional and intellectual reactions we have to them. In this way, aesthetics has become connected to the realm of art in that aesthetics describes, as Cubitt (2016) writes, "a moment when objects and senses come into contact---generating forms, sensations and psychic events."^[1](#Ch01.xhtml#fn1_1){#Ch01.xhtml#bck_fn1_1}^

Drawing on the work of philosopher Alain Badiou (2007), Cubitt historicizes the notion of aesthetics, suggesting that it can be roughly divided between two moments: the Classical, which revolves around past notions of the transcendent, ideal beauty of singular objects; and the Romantic, which describes future realizations of this past beauty.^[2](#Ch01.xhtml#fn1_2){#Ch01.xhtml#bck_fn1_2}^ And yet, he argues, if we accept that aesthetics is the "moment when objects and senses come into contact---generating forms, sensations, and psychic events, then surely the aesthetic is par excellence the experience of the present?"^[3](#Ch01.xhtml#fn1_3){#Ch01.xhtml#bck_fn1_3}^ But what is an aesthetics of the present? What does it entail? What form does it take? How do we know what an aesthetics of the present actually is? Is it because it has the qualities of being art or it was made in the present day? The circle, as Cubitt states, "is logically vicious."^[4](#Ch01.xhtml#fn1_4){#Ch01.xhtml#bck_fn1_4}^ As such, if we are to begin to describe an aesthetic of the present, we must do something more radical than simply list off the formal attributes of art that connect one movement to another. Cubitt does just this, suggesting that the thing that connects one digital artwork to another---the "digital aesthetic"---is the mediated experience of time.^[5](#Ch01.xhtml#fn1_5){#Ch01.xhtml#bck_fn1_5}^ However, why should we be concerned with aesthetics when theorizing the digital interface in interactive new media installations? And what is actually at stake when the aesthetic aspects of this device are ignored?

For Christiane Paul (2016), the answer to these questions is as follows: we should be concerned with aesthetics because it offers different approaches to, and perspectives on, a number of key issues in the philosophy of art and technology.^[6](#Ch01.xhtml#fn1_6){#Ch01.xhtml#bck_fn1_6}^ Speaking specifically to the aesthetics of new media art, Paul suggests that a critical investigation into aesthetics, alongside concepts like materiality and medium specificity, allows us to make distinctions between different artistic mediums and movements.^[7](#Ch01.xhtml#fn1_7){#Ch01.xhtml#bck_fn1_7}^ For example, she argues, aesthetics helps us to distinguish between practices that use digital technologies as a tool to produce more traditional art objects (photographs, prints, sculptures) and what she refers to as digital-born art---that is, "computable art that is stored, and distributed via digital technologies and uses the features of these technologies as a medium."^[8](#Ch01.xhtml#fn1_8){#Ch01.xhtml#bck_fn1_8}^ Like Paul, I argue that a critical understanding of aesthetics is significant because it allows for a better theorization of the role that technologies play in defining an art form beyond their instrumental contributions. My motivation behind suggesting such an approach differs from hers. My aim in deploying aesthetics is to explore how the use of the interface can act as a mode of critique of our relationship with technology and to reflect on the effects that this critique has []{#Ch01.xhtml#page_16 .pagebreak title="16"}on how we represent ourselves, as subjects, with technology in interactive new media installations.

However, the idea that any kind of aesthetic theory, let alone [digital]{.italic} aesthetics, asks us to "know in some sense what we mean by digital [art]{.italic} as anything other than a social category or works that circulate in the institutions and discourses of art" opens up a number of problems because digital aesthetics, as Cubitt argues, "is not something that can be captured the same way information can."^[9](#Ch01.xhtml#fn1_9){#Ch01.xhtml#bck_fn1_9}^ The key qualities (non-identity, ephemerality, unknowability) that Cubitt sees the aesthetic experience of the digital as entailing are not things that are easily quantified and commodified, despite our attempts to place value on them.^[10](#Ch01.xhtml#fn1_10){#Ch01.xhtml#bck_fn1_10}^ Rather, digital aesthetics, for Cubitt, is dependent on the mediation of the senses of vision and hearing---and these senses are always temporal. Thus, the identity of aesthetics, he argues, is always rooted in the present.^[11](#Ch01.xhtml#fn1_11){#Ch01.xhtml#bck_fn1_11}^ This point leads him to begin to theorize aesthetics in such a way that it allows for "the co-presence of not only artwork and audience but also the social that forms both of them."^[12](#Ch01.xhtml#fn1_12){#Ch01.xhtml#bck_fn1_12}^ Here, Cubitt is arguing that aesthetic encounters occur in time and are durational, non-identical, non-repeatable, and subjective. They are not a "uniquely exclusive collision of perceiver and perceived" and therefore are not located outside of or beyond history.^[13](#Ch01.xhtml#fn1_13){#Ch01.xhtml#bck_fn1_13}^ Thus, we must formulate this encounter, he writes, in such a way that it incorporates history, which is to say that "we must recognize the aesthetic, as both property of a work and as an experience of it, as something giving body to ('corporating') the historical present."^[14](#Ch01.xhtml#fn1_14){#Ch01.xhtml#bck_fn1_14}^

Like Cubitt, I suggest that the term "aesthetics" when applied to the use of the digital interface in interactive new media installations not only describes the characteristics of the artwork in which the interface is deployed, but also encapsulates the characteristics of the interface. In this way, aesthetics does not just shape our experience of digital artworks; it also shapes our interactions with and, by extension, our experience of the interface. Aesthetics, in the very narrow sense of the appreciation of art, as stated earlier, is dependent on "mediation by the senses of vision and hearing" and these senses, as Cubitt argues, are "intrinsically temporal."^[15](#Ch01.xhtml#fn1_15){#Ch01.xhtml#bck_fn1_15}^ Thus, aesthetics can be understood to serve as a descriptor of the mediated experience of time. Interactive new media installations, with their emphasis on viewer/participant action in virtual and physical space alongside their potential to highlight different, non-linear and non-visual modes of thinking and interacting, have the capacity to magnify the mediated experience of time Cubitt speaks of earlier. Here, I propose that new media artist Brian Knep's interactive new media installation [Deep Wounds]{.italic} (2006) provides a perfect example of art that magnifies the aspects of aesthetics discussed above.

In 2005--6, Knep was commissioned by the Office of the Arts at Harvard University to produce an installation (see [Plates 1 and 2](#Ch04.xhtml#pla1and2){#Ch01.xhtml#bck_pla1and2}). He chose as a location Memorial Hall.^[16](#Ch01.xhtml#fn1_16){#Ch01.xhtml#bck_fn1_16}^ This location was initially picked because of its surface-level aesthetic characteristics (stained glass windows, marble floors and walls). However, this attraction faded when Knep researched the building's history. Built between 1874 and 1877, Memorial Hall honors Harvard graduates who died in defense of the Union during the American Civil War (1861--65).^[17](#Ch01.xhtml#fn1_17){#Ch01.xhtml#bck_fn1_17}^ Names of 136 deceased alumni, along with other identifying information (year of graduation, place of birth, battle/place of death), are inscribed in red into the 28 marble panels that line the walls of the hall. Information about Harvard graduates who fought and died for the Confederacy is omitted from the building.^[18](#Ch01.xhtml#fn1_18){#Ch01.xhtml#bck_fn1_18}^

[]{#Ch01.xhtml#page_17 .pagebreak title="17"}[Deep Wounds]{.italic} is installed in the transept of Memorial Hall---a dimly lit space designed for contemplation. The aesthetics of the installation reflects this atmosphere. There are no fast-paced moving images, blinking lights, or loud audio tracks. Rather, [Deep Wounds]{.italic} consists of three large rectangular images, which are projected onto the marble floor of the building. These images, which were created specifically to resemble the stained glassed windows located above them, face the inscriptions on the wall. The images are milky in color, yet transparent enough so that, when visiting the installation, I could catch brief glimpses of what lies below. These hints are enticing, they made me want to explore the work, and so I do. I interact with the work by walking onto the floor. When I do this, the images covering the area of floor I was standing on began to blister and open up, revealing another layer of the artwork---snippets of blue-colored text.

I stand in silence for a few moments, examining the work, trying to make the connection between the imagery the piece has revealed to me and that of my surrounding environment. Making this connection is fairly straightforward: the text on the floor is written in the same font as the names of the deceased Union soldiers that line the walls opposite them, so I assume they are somehow related. I am correct: the text is an allusion to the dead Confederate soldiers, the implied other half of Memorial Hall. As Knep writes: "The content of the text consists of descriptions of the \[Harvard University\] graduates who died fighting for the Confederacy. Each man's year of graduation, state, date of death and battle of death are projected onto the floor."^[19](#Ch01.xhtml#fn1_19){#Ch01.xhtml#bck_fn1_19}^ In lieu of a name, a word describing a relationship (father, son, classmate) is used to identify these soldiers.^[20](#Ch01.xhtml#fn1_20){#Ch01.xhtml#bck_fn1_20}^ I spend a few moments reflecting on the text and then I move on. When I do so, the blistered images slowly knit themselves back together, covering the blue text. Since I must walk across the images on the floor to reveal the full nature of the artwork, my body functions as the interface in this work. Given this, it could be argued that viewer/participant interaction with the interface forms the backbone of the aesthetics of [Deep Wounds]{.italic}.

Katja Kwastek (2013) makes a similar argument about interactivity to the one I make above. Interactive art, she writes, "places the action of the recipient at the heart of its aesthetics."^[21](#Ch01.xhtml#fn1_21){#Ch01.xhtml#bck_fn1_21}^ This is because the recipient's action is the "activity that gives form and presence to the interactive artwork."^[22](#Ch01.xhtml#fn1_22){#Ch01.xhtml#bck_fn1_22}^ Thus, action, she states, is "the primary source of his \[the recipient's\] aesthetic experience."^[23](#Ch01.xhtml#fn1_23){#Ch01.xhtml#bck_fn1_23}^ Kwastek's suggestion could apply to the majority of performative arts practices and movements that precede interactive art. Kwastek acknowledges this fact, stating that in contrast to performative art, interactive works "present an action proposition that is generally not modified by the artist while being exhibited."^[24](#Ch01.xhtml#fn1_24){#Ch01.xhtml#bck_fn1_24}^ For example, Kwastek states that both the production and the reception aspects of interactive art are distinct from each other, although the artwork is involved in both aspects, in that in interactive art "production and reception aesthetics collide."^[25](#Ch01.xhtml#fn1_25){#Ch01.xhtml#bck_fn1_25}^ However, interactive art---and this is what she claims distinguishes it from traditional visual artworks and the more action-oriented variety listed above---does not "manifest its gestalt in the absence of reception."^[26](#Ch01.xhtml#fn1_26){#Ch01.xhtml#bck_fn1_26}^ Given this, she writes, interactive works are "conceived with a view to action, which is enabled and to an extent orchestrated by but not performed by the artist ... \[i\]n interactive art, the recipient becomes the performer."^[27](#Ch01.xhtml#fn1_27){#Ch01.xhtml#bck_fn1_27}^ Here, Kwastek is arguing that interactive artworks require the viewer/participant to perform, as well as view, the artwork, not the artist. And it is this characteristic that makes interactive artworks unique. The physical activity of the viewer/participant and her ability to become a performer, Kwastek []{#Ch01.xhtml#page_18 .pagebreak title="18"}argues, "contradicts a fundamental condition to which the possibility of aesthetic experience of any art form is usually linked: that of aesthetic distance."^[28](#Ch01.xhtml#fn1_28){#Ch01.xhtml#bck_fn1_28}^

According to the prevailing theories of aesthetics, the aesthetic object is constituted through viewer reflection and consideration. In order to achieve aesthetic distance and truly understand the meaning of the artwork, the viewer must be able to, in simple terms, detach herself from reality and immerse herself in the artwork. Once immersed, the viewer can become an objective observer. She can then contemplate the artwork free from any distraction. However, the notion of aesthetic distance does not apply to interactive art. This is because the viewer must interact with the work before she can reflect on it, therefore making the requirement of aesthetic distance extremely difficult to satisfy. Thus, Kwastek concludes: "Physical action on the part of the recipient is indispensable for the materialization of the artistic concept, which the recipient must realize, experience, and reflect upon at the same time."^[29](#Ch01.xhtml#fn1_29){#Ch01.xhtml#bck_fn1_29}^

I agree with Kwastek's conclusions about viewer/participant interaction being a defining aesthetic characteristic of interactive art---one that helps shape our interactions with and, by extension, our experience of the artwork and the interface. For example, the production (making the artwork) and reception (viewing the artwork) of [Deep Wounds]{.italic} are distinct elements. However, the aesthetics of both the aforementioned processes clearly manifest themselves in the artwork---most noticeably in the blistering and knitting of the images. Yet, the installation does not work---it is not art---if nobody is there to interact with it. And while he is present and speaks with me at length during my various visits to the site, Knep is not modifying the artwork in real time. Thus, it could be said that [Deep Wounds]{.italic} is conceived with a view toward viewer/participant interaction---a view that the artist (Knep) orchestrates, but does not perform, making viewer/participant interaction an important aesthetic characteristic of this installation. However, my interpretation differs from Kwastek's analysis slightly in that I do not consider viewer/participant interaction to be unique to interactive art. The ability for the viewer to become a performer via interaction with the artwork is paramount to many different participatory art movements---most notably Fluxus, Situationism, body art, and performance art. Furthermore, while the artist may be present and performing the art piece, the majority of works created in the aforementioned art movements are conceived with a view to viewer/participant action. Rather, following Cubitt, I argue that the characteristic that makes interactive art unique is the mediated experience of time that viewer/participant interaction with the interface creates.

## [[The Aesthetic Interface and the Mediated Experience of Time]{.bold}](#content.xhtml#bck_sec1_2) {#Ch01.xhtml#sec1_2}

[Deep Wounds]{.italic} is an artwork about the American Civil War. It is tucked away in a building located on an Ivy League University Campus---a building that is accessible to students that attend the institution, its employees, and their invited guests. Thus, [Deep Wounds]{.italic} is an artwork about inclusion and exclusion, the (post-)industrial North and the (post-)agrarian South, slavery, racism, and reconstruction, forgiveness and responsibility, loss and regret. In a broader sense, it is about past conflicts, the present societal rifts that these conflicts create, and our future attempts to reconcile them. [Deep Wounds]{.italic} has received rave reviews from the art world. Public response to the work has not been as positive, as the work does not overtly acknowledge the underlying reason why the American Civil War was fought---slavery. This lack of acknowledgment is []{#Ch01.xhtml#page_19 .pagebreak title="19"}reflected in comments made by members of the public. Members of the public have called the piece "yet another conversation between white men about the Civil War," while one commenter referred to Knep as "literally Hitler."^[30](#Ch01.xhtml#fn1_30){#Ch01.xhtml#bck_fn1_30}^ In a rush to critique what could be seen as racist attitudes toward deeply complex and polarized subject matters that still pervade American public consciousness and political rhetoric, one might neglect more basic questions about [Deep Wounds]{.italic}. How do the conscious and unconscious aesthetic choices made by the artist (making the visuals pretty and interaction fluid instead of ugly and burdensome, selecting a memorial to house the work, making the Confederate soldiers who attended Harvard the subject of the installation instead of the African-American slaves who worked there) affect the way in which the artwork is received by viewer/participants and art critics? Do all of them receive it in the same way? How might the terms of engagement and the underlying narratives of [Deep Wounds]{.italic} change (or not) if the digital interface was something other than a human body? Something non-subjective, something purely technical, something Knep could, to a certain extent, control?

Cubitt contends that aesthetics is not simply a philosophical subdiscipline, but it is a particular way in which, in a given context, art is identified as art and, by default, a subject is defined as a subject to be discussed.^[31](#Ch01.xhtml#fn1_31){#Ch01.xhtml#bck_fn1_31}^ For example, he writes, by interacting with digital artworks, "the viewer selects what [not]{.italic} to see as much as what to see; and the installation evolves constantly whether viewers are present or not."^[32](#Ch01.xhtml#fn1_32){#Ch01.xhtml#bck_fn1_32}^ While made specifically about generative web-based installations, Cubitt's point could be extended to encompass interactive new media installations: how a viewer/participant interprets the narrative of an artwork and interacts with it is entirely dependent on her experience in the world. This point could also be extended to encompass the art world as a whole in which the institutions that host the work select, in terms of curation and distribution of funds, what an artist is [not]{.italic} able to discuss and where she [cannot]{.italic} exhibit as much as what she is able to discuss and where she can exhibit. The second point applies to [Deep Wounds]{.italic}.

Knep originally wanted to list the actual names of the Confederate soldiers in his work.^[33](#Ch01.xhtml#fn1_33){#Ch01.xhtml#bck_fn1_33}^ However, the Office of the Arts felt that listing these names would be too controversial because it would call attention to the fact that Harvard, and many of its former graduates, used to own slaves---a fact that the University has only recently publicly acknowledged.^[34](#Ch01.xhtml#fn1_34){#Ch01.xhtml#bck_fn1_34}^ Listing the names of the Confederate soldiers would shine a light on discontinuities between the University's past and present political leanings and socio-economic policies. Doing this would create uncomfortable discussions around what type of subjects could and could not be memorialized, and thus should or should not be remembered. The question of who could or could not be memorialized became even more contentious due to the terms of the trust that endowed Memorial Hall's construction: these terms implicitly state that Confederate alumni must never be enshrined there.^[35](#Ch01.xhtml#fn1_35){#Ch01.xhtml#bck_fn1_35}^ It was only the erasure of the Confederate soldiers' names, in combination with the facts that the installation was temporary (it was exhibited for only three weeks) and ephemeral (projected light)---facts that the University believed would alleviate tensions between what was being shown and discussed in [Deep Wounds]{.italic} and what was not---that rendered the narrative of the artwork "less offensive" to the University and allowed the project to move forward.^[36](#Ch01.xhtml#fn1_36){#Ch01.xhtml#bck_fn1_36}^

However, trying to control how audiences will respond to the narrative of an artwork in the way in which Harvard tried to with [Deep Wounds]{.italic} is as impossible as trying to predict how audiences will interact with the work. These predictions never add []{#Ch01.xhtml#page_20 .pagebreak title="20"}up to the over-idealized cybernetic models of action and notoriously unreliable public opinion polls in any case. This is because, as Cubitt writes, the "'gestalt moment' of an ending, when the patterns of a narrative or the structures of melody and development make sense as a whole," do not happen in digital artworks (specifically those like [Deep Wounds]{.italic} that are generative), as they conclude only in the sense that they can be switched off.^[37](#Ch01.xhtml#fn1_37){#Ch01.xhtml#bck_fn1_37}^ Rather, he argues, the freedom of digital artworks "lies in their ephemeral temporality, their constant bubbling into and out of existence, and in the operations they perform on the accumulated data of the past to produce the emergent unknown future."^[38](#Ch01.xhtml#fn1_38){#Ch01.xhtml#bck_fn1_38}^ What is interesting about [Deep Wounds]{.italic}' narrative and the polarized reactions that it elicits is the view of contemporary America that it depicts---a forward-facing, over-idealistic perspective around reconciliation, which is based on data (biographical information) from America's not so utopian past. Instead of appearing as numbers, biographical information (dates of birth and death, full names of people) appears as relationships (Brother, Father, Son, Classmate). Since they are long gone, we know little of the relationships the soldiers identified on the floor had with those located on the wall. However, the work provides us with just enough information to remind us that conflict creates hatred, and hatred creates rifts between best friends, brothers, and countrymen. [Deep Wounds]{.italic} asks us to explore and respond to these conflicts and rifts---to interact with and take responsibility for our previous actions in the now. In this sense, [Deep Wounds]{.italic} is a deeply ethical work: it invites us to re-open old wounds and to reflect on the unacceptable positions of the past in the present day. Recast as relationships, the biographical information of deceased soldiers from conflicts past and the values they held cease to be abstract. Through interacting with the work, we embody historical information and relocate it in the present. The designation of the viewer/participant's body as interface means that these past relationships become a personalized, albeit mediated, experience of time. The fact that we must use our bodies to interact with the work and in order to see the words that the piece, and the institution itself, attempted to obscure is an important aspect of the work. It makes the notion of aesthetic distance difficult to maintain, given that we must become physically involved in, experience, and reflect upon the work at the same time.

A critical re-evaluation of some of the basic ideas of what a digital interface is and what it does in interactive new media installations presents a challenge to notions held by scholars such as Jonathan Crary (2002), who posits that concepts such as interactivity, media spectatorship, and subjectivity are predicated on "the relative separation of a viewer from a milieu of distraction and the detachment of an image from a larger background."^[39](#Ch01.xhtml#fn1_39){#Ch01.xhtml#bck_fn1_39}^ Crary's interpretation fits the specific interface (the peep show) and time period (the nineteenth century) he is describing. However, notions of detachment and separation when applied to interactive new media art, as they consequently have been, are troubling. This is because they create interiorized and privatized experiences, thus positioning the digital interface as an unconscious, "accidental" choice on behalf of the artist. Positioning the interface as such, I suggest, isolates the viewer/participant from the artistic process, ultimately creating separate objects and subjects in interactive new media installations. There are, however, ways to begin to bridge []{#Ch01.xhtml#page_21 .pagebreak title="21"}these boundaries in interactive new media art installations. One such approach, I argue, involves a critical investigation into the aesthetic aspects of the digital interface, as doing this could allow us to enact what Karen Barad (2007) sees as an abrupt break with notions of representationalism.^[40](#Ch01.xhtml#fn1_40){#Ch01.xhtml#bck_fn1_40}^

Representationalism, for Barad, is the "belief in the ontological distinction between representations and that which they purport to represent; in particular that which is represented is held to be independent of all practices of representing."^[41](#Ch01.xhtml#fn1_41){#Ch01.xhtml#bck_fn1_41}^ This mode of thinking, she writes, is a "particularly inconspicuous consequence of, among other things, the Cartesian division between 'internal' and 'external'."^[42](#Ch01.xhtml#fn1_42){#Ch01.xhtml#bck_fn1_42}^ Representational-ist modes of thinking, she notes, are problematic because they divide things (subjects and objects) into static, homogeneous categories (digital interfaces and viewer/participants).^[43](#Ch01.xhtml#fn1_43){#Ch01.xhtml#bck_fn1_43}^ These divisions, in short, are not logical necessities. They are historic-cultural beliefs that are an intrinsic part of Western philosophy's legacy or, to use Barad's words, simply Cartesian habits of the mind.^[44](#Ch01.xhtml#fn1_44){#Ch01.xhtml#bck_fn1_44}^

Paying critical attention to the aesthetic aspects of the interface---specifically to those aspects of viewer/participant interaction with the interface that constitute an abrupt break with representationalism---will be the starting point for my analysis of Camille Utterback's interactive new media installation [Untitled 5]{.italic} (2004). In what follows, I will suggest that a critical theorization of the aesthetic aspects of the digital interface in interactive new media installations allows us to challenge (via viewer/participant interaction) representationalism and intervene in the "Cartesian habits of mind" (such as belief in the need for aesthetic distance and the ontological separation of objects and subjects that follows from it).

In 2007, I had the good fortune to interact with [Untitled 5]{.italic} at Art Interactive in Cambridge, Massachusetts. [Untitled 5]{.italic} consists of a closed-circuit camera, a computer, and a large projection screen (see [Plates 3 and 4](#Ch04.xhtml#pla3and4){#Ch01.xhtml#bck_pla3and4}). When installed at Art Interactive, the projection screen took up the majority of the back wall of the gallery space. The screen was covered in a series of colorful smudged dots and brush strokes. The brush strokes and dots were visual representations of the past and current presence and movements of gallery visitors. For example, when I entered the gallery, the camera detected my presence, along with the presence and movements of other visitors. This information was processed by the computer and projected onto the center of the screen as a set of brush strokes or, as Utterback calls them, "painterly marks."^[45](#Ch01.xhtml#fn1_45){#Ch01.xhtml#bck_fn1_45}^ So, when I waved my hand, lifted a leg, or jumped, a mark of a certain size and color appeared on screen. If I stood still, a different type of mark appeared on screen. The more I interacted with the work, the more marks appeared.

In addition to the marks, a colored line appeared on screen. Whereas the marks were visual representations of my presence and current movements in space, the line mapped my trajectory. So, when I moved to the left, the line followed me and moved to the left of the screen. When I left the installation space, the line that mapped my trajectory broke apart and became a set of spots. The size of these spots directly correlated to the "in-activity or stillness" of that particular person.^[46](#Ch01.xhtml#fn1_46){#Ch01.xhtml#bck_fn1_46}^ So, if I spent three minutes interacting with the work and then left, the line mapping my trajectory would become a set of imperceptible dots. If I spent one minute interacting with the work, two minutes standing still, and then left, the line would become a set of large splotches.

As a current gallery visitor, I could push these splotches and dots around the screen using my body. As I pushed them, they began to blend into each other. If I did not interact with them, they attempted to migrate back to the center of the screen. Together, these marks, lines, dots, and splotches formed a composition that another visitor, Nathaniel Stern (2013), writes, create intersections between "movement paths and who does or does not follow them" as well as connections between "different moments of time \[and\] different bodies in space."^[47](#Ch01.xhtml#fn1_47){#Ch01.xhtml#bck_fn1_47}^ In doing so, he argues that Utter-back's work creates "slightly different conceptual-material encounters" by highlighting the multiple relationships that gallery visitors are able to form with Utterback's "artwork, and with art- and mark making more generally."^[48](#Ch01.xhtml#fn1_48){#Ch01.xhtml#bck_fn1_48}^ I agree with Stern's reading of [Untitled 5]{.italic}. I believe the marks, lines, splotches, and dots were and are acting in conjunction with each other (as well as in conjunction with the visitor) to create the on-screen composition. Collaborative making and an exploration into the creation of a different type of aesthetic system via embodied interaction are indeed the main aims of Utterback's work.

![fig1_1.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/MbaQ25k.jpeg)

For example, the ultimate goal of [Untitled 5]{.italic}, as Utterback states, is to "create an aesthetic system which responds fluidly and intriguingly to physical movement in the exhibit space."^[49](#Ch01.xhtml#fn1_49){#Ch01.xhtml#bck_fn1_49}^ The visitors interacting with [Untitled 5]{.italic} are expected to engage with the on-screen images. Meaning can be produced, on behalf of the visitors, through embodied interaction. Thus, meaning emerges out of the visitor's interactions with each other and with the artwork. However, the human-to-computer interaction modeled here could be seen as restrictive. This is because, like the majority of interactive new media installations, [Untitled 5]{.italic} is organized from within, governed by internal lines of code and specific rules. Utterback has not revealed these rules to her visitors because she wants them to discover the internal structure and composition via creative exploration and play. As she writes: "While the specific rules of the system are never explicitly revealed to participants, the internal structure and composition of the piece can be discovered through a process of kinaesthetic exploration. Engaging with this work creates a visceral sense of unfolding or revelation, but also a feeling of immediacy and loss."^[50](#Ch01.xhtml#fn1_50){#Ch01.xhtml#bck_fn1_50}^

![fig1_2.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/So7joNn.jpeg)

Concealment of the underlying rules, as Florian Cramer (in Andersen and Pold, 2011) tells us, becomes an issue when applied to computerized devices (like interfaces), as he believes it implies "a separation of 'users' from 'programmers' based on different access privileges to machine functions granted by the respective interface."^[51](#Ch01.xhtml#fn1_51){#Ch01.xhtml#bck_fn1_51}^ In other words, concealment of the underlying rules that govern artworks, by artists, creates a separation of visitors from the artistic process itself. Separation occurs because the visitor has no access to the technical systems she is interacting with. This separation is telling as it reveals a troubling inconsistency hidden in theories of interactivity.

## [[]{#Ch01.xhtml#page_24 .pagebreak title="24"} [The Difficulty with Interactivity]{.bold}](#content.xhtml#bck_sec1_4) {#Ch01.xhtml#sec1_4}

Jacques Derrida (1992, 2000) addresses some of the issues discussed above through an exploration of notions of the gift and hospitality. Derrida (1992) argues that the notion of the gift is a "transcendental illusion."^[52](#Ch01.xhtml#fn1_52){#Ch01.xhtml#bck_fn1_52}^ This is because a gift, in the true sense of the word, must be located outside a set of oppositional or binary demands (I give, you take or I act, you react) and beyond any self-interest or calculated reason (I am giving you X, therefore I expect Y in return, or I am asking you to interact because I want you to contribute to the artwork).^[53](#Ch01.xhtml#fn1_53){#Ch01.xhtml#bck_fn1_53}^

Furthermore, for Derrida, a gift is a transcendental illusion because it is negated by anything that acknowledges it as a direct act of giving (monetary compensation, a simple thank you) as this acknowledgment presumes that one entity (the entity that gives or acts) is no longer indebted to the other (the entity that receives or reacts).^[54](#Ch01.xhtml#fn1_54){#Ch01.xhtml#bck_fn1_54}^ Significantly, the entities involved in this transaction enter into an endless cycle of giving and taking in which a gift must be accompanied by an appropriate response, usually a thank you. For Derrida, it is this part of the give/take cycle (the fact that a gift is associated with a command to respond on behalf of the receiver) that is an issue, as this response, he argues, is imposed on the receiver. Therefore, he suggests that a gift, in its true form, is almost always impossible because it is almost always conditional.^[55](#Ch01.xhtml#fn1_55){#Ch01.xhtml#bck_fn1_55}^ He argues that a gift, be it a present that you give to a friend, or the invitation that Utterback (the giver) is extending to the gallery visitor (the recipient) described above, requires absolute anonymity of the giver in order to be unconditional.^[56](#Ch01.xhtml#fn1_56){#Ch01.xhtml#bck_fn1_56}^ Absolute anonymity is important because it means that no one participating in the give/take cycle can claim any kind of benefit or is obliged to respond. However, for Derrida, this requirement can never be fulfilled. Thus, the notion of the gift, the act of giving, and the possibilities that surround it are inextricably linked with their impossibility.^[57](#Ch01.xhtml#fn1_57){#Ch01.xhtml#bck_fn1_57}^ In short, for a gift to be a gift, it must be given anonymously, without any expectation on behalf of the entity that is giving, of a response of any kind from the receiver, or that they (the giver or the receiver) will be able to gain some sort of benefit. A gift for Derrida then is almost always an impossible scenario, as genuine giving does not exist.

When theorized in direct relation to new media, interactivity, according to Martin Lister (Lister et al., 2009), signifies the users' "ability to directly intervene in and change the images and texts that they access."^[58](#Ch01.xhtml#fn1_58){#Ch01.xhtml#bck_fn1_58}^ Lister argues that: "In interactive multi-media texts there is a sense in which it is necessary for the user to actively intervene; to act as well as viewing or reading in order to produce meaning."^[59](#Ch01.xhtml#fn1_59){#Ch01.xhtml#bck_fn1_59}^ Given this, the subject interacting with new media, of any kind, becomes a participant in, rather than a viewer of, visual culture. For example, I can directly intervene in and change, as noted above, the size, shape, and trajectory of the images in [Untitled 5]{.italic}. I am thus interactive---I am a viewer/participant rather than a viewer because I am directly affecting the outcome of the installation via my presence and movements in space. However, there is an expectation of interaction on my behalf embedded in this piece. This expectation is reiterated by Utterback. Integral to [Untitled 5]{.italic} "are the animated mark's cumulative interaction with each other over time. As a person moves through the space, a colored line maps his or her trajectory across the projection. When a person leaves the installation, their trajectory line is transformed by an overlay of tiny organic marks. These marks can now be pushed from their location by other people's movement in the space."^[60](#Ch01.xhtml#fn1_60){#Ch01.xhtml#bck_fn1_60}^ In this way, the model of interactivity deployed in this work and the invitation it extends to the []{#Ch01.xhtml#page_25 .pagebreak title="25"}viewer/participant is, to an extent, constrained, so the viewer/participant's response is, to an extent, limited. Therefore, interactivity, like Derrida's notion of giving, is almost always an impossible scenario.

This impossibility for Derrida is intensified in the concept of hospitality.^[61](#Ch01.xhtml#fn1_61){#Ch01.xhtml#bck_fn1_61}^ The concept of hospitality, like that of the gift, contains a double logic, as he argues that absolute hospitality is not a possible scenario.^[62](#Ch01.xhtml#fn1_62){#Ch01.xhtml#bck_fn1_62}^ Hospitality, he writes, should extend an open-ended, unconditional invitation to those who request it.^[63](#Ch01.xhtml#fn1_63){#Ch01.xhtml#bck_fn1_63}^ However, this invitation is a paradox, in that it always comes with limitations. To summarize his argument, when theorized from within the context of immigration and the right to asylum in the European Union, absolute hospitality should offer an unconditional "right of refuge" to those who request it.^[64](#Ch01.xhtml#fn1_64){#Ch01.xhtml#bck_fn1_64}^ Yet, the right of refuge and immigration in general are always restricted by laws and other various mechanisms of control (citizenship, finance, religion, language, ethnicity) which are implemented by the State or nation. These limitations create tensions between groups of people (subjects who can and subjects who cannot immigrate), and contradictions between altruistic theories of hospitality and how this concept is enacted in practice.

Derrida continues by arguing that in order to be hospitable, you must have the power to host---to welcome visitors into your country, or as in this instance to extend an invitation to interact with your artwork.^[65](#Ch01.xhtml#fn1_65){#Ch01.xhtml#bck_fn1_65}^ In this way, hospitality is aligned with ownership and self-identity (I am a nation, I am an artist, I run a country so I can issue you a visa, I have created a work of art so I can ask you to interact with it). Furthermore, in order to be hospitable, the host must place limitations on the behavior of their visitors (enter my country but have the correct papers, look at my art but do not touch it). Limitations are put into place precisely because if visitors are given complete unrestricted freedom, then the host is no longer being hospitable as the host is no longer in control of the situation. In this way, for Derrida, hospitality is inextricably linked to notions of power and control, and therefore exclusion.^[66](#Ch01.xhtml#fn1_66){#Ch01.xhtml#bck_fn1_66}^

My argument is that the concept of interactivity, like the ideas of giving and hospitality, is a paradox. Interactivity should provide the visitor with an invitation to explore connections between bodies and representational systems, and to create different ones; to become co-creator of an artwork. In fact, interactivity is essential to many new media artworks---especially to [Untitled 5.]{.italic} For example, [Untitled 5]{.italic} would not work if a visitor was not present to interact with it, as the projected images depend entirely on visitors' presence and movement in the gallery. So, there is a degree of reciprocity, vis-Ã -vis interaction, happening in [Untitled 5]{.italic} and therefore the open-ended invitation to become co-creator mentioned above is a legitimate one.

However, interactivity in [Untitled 5]{.italic}, as mentioned above, is constrained. What a visitor can or cannot do in the installation is regulated by the underlying technological and representational systems that allow the work to function, the interests of the artist, and the invitation to interact itself. While they can be, at times, problematic, these constraints and limitations are of critical importance to the artwork. For example, [Untitled 5]{.italic}, as Utterback tells us, contains "custom video tracking and drawing software \[that\] outputs a changing wall projection in response to the activities in the space."^[67](#Ch01.xhtml#fn1_67){#Ch01.xhtml#bck_fn1_67}^ So, as discussed earlier, I enter the gallery space and move to the left of the screen. The aforementioned software records my presence and movements, processes this information, and this is projected onto the left-hand side []{#Ch01.xhtml#page_26 .pagebreak title="26"}of the screen as a mark, which I can move. However, I have no control over the shape, size, color, and motion of this mark; rather, these attributes are pre-determined by the software. Nor am I given control over other attributes of the artwork (the size and shape of the screen, the placement in the gallery). These attributes are also determined by the artist, curators, and preparators, and by the limitations of the gallery space. Restrictions are put into place precisely because if I was given complete, unrestricted creative freedom to interact, Utterback would not be able to claim creative control over the artwork. Simply put, without regulating visitor interaction, [Untitled 5]{.italic} would not be interactive new media art; rather, I argue that it would be something akin to chaos.

Representational systems can be, as Barad writes, "sometimes explicitly theorized in terms of a tripartite arrangement ... in addition to knowledge (i.e., representations), on the one hand, and the known (i.e., that which is purportedly represented), on the other, the existence of a knower (i.e., someone who does the representing) is acknowledged."^[68](#Ch01.xhtml#fn1_68){#Ch01.xhtml#bck_fn1_68}^ When the acknowledgment of a creator happens, Barad posits that "it becomes clear that representations are presumed to serve a mediating function between independently existing entities."^[69](#Ch01.xhtml#fn1_69){#Ch01.xhtml#bck_fn1_69}^ This assumption of mediation is signifi-cant because, like the tensions and contradictions discussed above, it creates a gap between the subject and the object. This proposed gap raises more questions, this time around the accuracy of representations, concepts of mediation, and of creation, creativity, and creators in interactive media installations. What exactly is it that is being mediated and why is it being mediated? Who or what is doing the mediation? Who exactly is the artist in this installation? Is it Utterback? Is it the visitor? Or a combination of both?

In an attempt to explore similar questions, scholars and artists struggle to develop understandings of the possibilities for interventions that move beyond the restrictive frameworks of representationalism. It is possible to construct coherent philosophical positions that begin to critically question the basic premises of these aforementioned notions. However, completely breaking the dichotomies ((inter)active vs. passive), bridging the object/subject gaps, and resolving the contradictions they create is not as simple as it first appears. It requires, as Barad posits, "a rethinking of the nature of a host of fundamental notions such as being, identity, matter, discourse ... and agency."^[70](#Ch01.xhtml#fn1_70){#Ch01.xhtml#bck_fn1_70}^

I argue that one such rethinking occurs in [Untitled 5]{.italic}. For instance, instead of trying to fill this gap between the subject and the object, and to resolve the tension it creates through the acknowledgment of the existence of a singular creator, or "artist," Utter-back exploits it. This exploitation occurs because, as mentioned above, when I interact with the artwork, I am moving the dots and splotches around the screen, making connections between objects, shapes, and movements, and composing different works with them. In this way, my body has become a paint brush. It has been reconstituted as an artistic instrument---it has become the primary mode of aesthetic expression in [Untitled 5]{.italic}. Designation of the human body as the primary mode of aesthetic expression, or interface, in interactive new media installations is significant because it breaks with traditional representational theories of visual art that prioritize the mind over the body and treat the visual experience of the visitor as the object of perception. It enhances and critically examines, rather than suppresses, the human body's role in the processes of perception and image making.

## [[]{#Ch01.xhtml#page_27 .pagebreak title="27"} [The Digital Interface Is Obsolete]{.bold}](#content.xhtml#bck_sec1_5) {#Ch01.xhtml#sec1_5}

It is important to clarify what I mean when I state at the beginning of this chapter that the term "digital interface"---defined as a device that acts and reacts to viewer/participant interaction---is inadequate when applied to interactive new media installations. While I am suggesting that certain definitions of the digital interface are unsatisfactory, it does not mean that I am stating that the interface is not physically there in interactive new media installations. The digital interface does physically exist, as will be demonstrated throughout this book. Rather, echoing new media artist Stelarc's critique of assumptions about the body and technology in his technologized performances---specifically his statement that "the body is obsolete"---I am arguing that particular understandings of what a digital interface is, its meaning, functions, and physical form in interactive new media installations, have changed, resulting in the need for some new, more complex articulations. My aim in engaging with Stelarc's conceptualization, and by extension his artwork, is to reveal contradictions within traditional theories of the body and its relationship to technology, linking my analysis of the digital interface in interactive new media installations to a certain type of philosophical post-humanist critique of technology: one that complicates, and attempts to think beyond, humanist frameworks of the relationship between the body, technology, and art. Borrowing Stelarc's theory of obsolescence, its particular linguistic figuration and his conceptualization of the body that underpins his statements and practice, and applying it to the interface, enables me to suggest that the digital interface is not a passive, technical device that merely registers the actions of the viewer/participant and then reacts to them. Therefore, any theorization of the digital interface that positions it as this type of device is obsolete in interactive new media installations.

However, as Stelarc points out, while the body, when theorized as "a kind of Cartesian theater of 'I'," may be obsolete, we "cannot discard the body. It is not the object manipulated by the subject."^[71](#Ch01.xhtml#fn1_71){#Ch01.xhtml#bck_fn1_71}^ The body to Stelarc is "not merely a passenger."^[72](#Ch01.xhtml#fn1_72){#Ch01.xhtml#bck_fn1_72}^ Rather, the body, he writes, "has always been a prosthetic body ... I've never seen the body as purely biological, so to consider technology as a kind of alien other that happens upon us at the end of the millennium is rather simplistic."^[73](#Ch01.xhtml#fn1_73){#Ch01.xhtml#bck_fn1_73}^ It is important to note here that Stelarc does not advocate for patching-up bodies vis-Ã -vis prosthetics. Instead, he believes that it is time to redesign them---to rethink "the human in nonhuman forms and with nonhuman forms." So, when Stelarc insists that "the body is obsolete," he is not stating that the physical body itself has disappeared or that it is shape shifting.^[74](#Ch01.xhtml#fn1_74){#Ch01.xhtml#bck_fn1_74}^ Rather, I understand him to mean that specific reconfigurations of the body (as separate biological subjects that use technologized objects), positionings of the physical body (as purely biological or located above or inside technology), and notions of the self (as a singular individualized Cartesian agent whose problems can be fixed through technological prostheses) never actually existed as such. In this way, Stelarc's practice becomes a vehicle for me to think about the use of the digital interface in interactive new media art installations.

Borrowing Stelarc's theory of obsolescence, its particular linguistic figuration, and his conceptualization of the body that underpins his statements and practice, and applying it to the interface enables me to suggest that the digital interface is not a passive, technical device that merely registers the actions of the viewer/participant and then reacts to them. Therefore, any theorization of the digital interface that positions []{#Ch01.xhtml#page_28 .pagebreak title="28"}it as this type of device is obsolete in interactive new media installations. In this way, Stelarc's notion of obsolescence connects the three concerns of this chapter: aesthetics, media spectatorship, and interactivity. Given this, Stelarc's interactive body installation [Rewired/Remixed: Event for Dismembered Body]{.italic} (2015--present) is a perfect piece to conclude this chapter with, as it demonstrates how aesthetics, materiality, space, and human and non-human bodies collide to create the aesthetic interface.

[Rewired/Remixed: Event for Dismembered Body]{.italic} is an internet-enabled interactive new media "body installation."^[75](#Ch01.xhtml#fn1_75){#Ch01.xhtml#bck_fn1_75}^ It explores notions of coherency and continuity, and their relationship with the human body in space and time. By exploring these relationships, Stelarc's goal is to "disrupt and destabilize the body's operation proximal to things and other people."^[76](#Ch01.xhtml#fn1_76){#Ch01.xhtml#bck_fn1_76}^ Like most performance-based works, [Rewired/Remixed]{.italic} is durational---it involves the activation of bodies in space and time in art. Viewer/participants are presented with two different viewing options: they can visit the gallery and participate in the performance in person, or they can visit a custom-built website and participate in the performance via a live stream. The particular performance I participated in took place in Munich, Germany on August 31, 2018. I participated via live stream from my home in London, UK. Stelarc wore a heads-up display (HUD) and sound-cancelling earphones throughout his performance. Attached to his right arm was an exoskeleton robotic arm, which extended from his shoulder down to his fingertips. The exoskeleton arm was a pneumatically actuated, with shoulder, elbow, wrist, and individual finger-flexion. It also rotated passively at the elbow. The exoskeleton arm he wore during this performance was an aesthetic continuation of his famed "performance object"---a robotic prosthetic hand and arm---used in works such as [Third Hand]{.italic} (1980--88) and [Ping Body]{.italic} (1995).^[77](#Ch01.xhtml#fn1_77){#Ch01.xhtml#bck_fn1_77}^

During his performance, Stelarc stands on a platform, located in front of a large white wall, with a halo of bright light splashed down the center of it. Projected into the halo is an enlarged shadow of Stelarc, which mimics the movements of his physical body. Stelarc's body was in constant motion, yet he remained silent for the duration of the performance. The gallery was loud despite his silence---a cacophony of machine sounds and transmitted noises echoed throughout the space, and can be heard in the live stream on the website. Half of the sounds and noises were created by the pneumatically actuated exoskeleton arm, while the other half came from the wall located to the left of the platform. Projected onto this wall was a continuous stream of audio-visual material. The audio-visual material changed depending on the location, date, and time of the performance.^[78](#Ch01.xhtml#fn1_78){#Ch01.xhtml#bck_fn1_78}^ The audio I heard was streamed live from Enschede, the Netherlands; the video was streamed live from Barcelona, Spain. The conversations were mundane and the speaker's voices were drowned out by frequent blasts of techno music (see [Plate 5](#Ch04.xhtml#pla5and6){#Ch01.xhtml#bck_pla5and6}).

As mentioned above, Stelarc wears a HUD and sound-cancelling earphones during the performance. Given this, he cannot see or hear the action happening in the gallery. He does, however, have access to the audio-visual material through some of his bodily augmentations---specifically, the HUD and the headphones. Having access to this material means that he is able to experience multiple places at once. For instance, he is physically located in the gallery for the duration of the performance. However, by accessing the audio-visual material, he can, via sight and sound, experience two vastly different locations. In this way, he is located everywhere and nowhere during his performances; as his bodily senses are to an extent divorced from the events happening in the gallery, he is physically located in and distributed across multiple platforms. As

![figs1_3and1_4.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/FtzMF7n.jpeg)

he writes: "The body was constantly distracted, its attention sliding between what it was seeing, what it was hearing, and what it was doing. The body was neither all here nor all there, but partly here sometimes and partly elsewhere other times."^[79](#Ch01.xhtml#fn1_79){#Ch01.xhtml#bck_fn1_79}^ Stelarc's description of his physical body as located nowhere and everywhere, partly "here" in the gallery and partly "elsewhere" in the visual and acoustic places, virtually observing []{#Ch01.xhtml#page_30 .pagebreak title="30"}events (and to an extent performing them) raises interesting questions related to the concepts of place, the body, and the interface in interactive new media installations. What do notions of place mean with regard to the relationship between body and the interface in interactive new media installations? And how does this relationship change when you "occupy" three places at once?

## [[Place and the Aesthetic Interface]{.bold}](#content.xhtml#bck_sec1_6) {#Ch01.xhtml#sec1_6}

Place, according to Yi-Fu Tuan (1975), has multiple meanings, and these meanings are dependent on the perspective from which it is studied. The two most common theorizations, he writes, are place as location and place as a unique artifact.^[80](#Ch01.xhtml#fn1_80){#Ch01.xhtml#bck_fn1_80}^ While they differ, both theorizations of place share one commonality---a focus on the notion of experience. Experience, from within the context of studies of place, Tuan tells us, "is a cover-all term for the various modes through which a person knows his world."^[81](#Ch01.xhtml#fn1_81){#Ch01.xhtml#bck_fn1_81}^ Some of these modes, Tuan states, are more private (a smell, a taste, an unarticulated thought), while others are more public (visual or physical participation) and some sit somewhere in between the two (a speech or shared idea).^[82](#Ch01.xhtml#fn1_82){#Ch01.xhtml#bck_fn1_82}^ I interact with [Rewired/Remixed]{.italic} through all three modes of experience. For example, my first viewing of the performance was a solitary affair. I sat on my couch in my apartment, scrolled through the webpage, interacted with the interface, and participated in the performance via live stream by myself. The next three viewings were more like public events. I watched and rewatched the video in my office alongside my colleagues. We discussed issues related to the performance (aesthetics, performativity, space, place, and time). We shared ideas and readings on these topics. My consequent interactions with the performance have existed somewhere in between the two public and private modes discussed above. I have viewed and continue to view video recordings of the work by myself, but my thoughts and interactions with it are heavily influenced by the conversations I had with others about the performance. Despite the different modes of interaction and viewing, I never felt alone or dislocated from the gallery. This feeling was due to the amount of activity happening in the video and the subjective meanings I consequently ascribed to it. More specifically, it was due to the way in which my experience of the performance, and the self-referential acts that followed it, created a sense of place. In other words, through various acts of (dis)identification with bodies, places, and interfaces, I was able to create a sense of meaning around the performance and thus to construct a coherent and recognizable place.

Place, Tuan tells us, "is a center of meaning constructed by experience."^[83](#Ch01.xhtml#fn1_83){#Ch01.xhtml#bck_fn1_83}^ He continues by stating that place is understood not only through what we see and think, but also through the more subjective public and private modes of experience. Thus, to know a place fully, he concludes, "means both to understand it in an abstract way and to know it as one person knows another."^[84](#Ch01.xhtml#fn1_84){#Ch01.xhtml#bck_fn1_84}^ Here, Tuan is arguing that place is both an abstract and a familiar experience. It is not something that is known all at once; rather, it is constructed through connections between interactions, experiences, and bodies. These connections create a sense of coherency and continuity, which aid in the production of a place. However, what happens when the meanings that we ascribe to these places, and the coherency, self-referentiality, continuity that follow them are declared, as Stelarc does in his artist statement, inadequate? In order to begin to explore this question, we must return to Stelarc's conceptualization of obsolescence.

[]{#Ch01.xhtml#page_31 .pagebreak title="31"}As mentioned earlier, Stelarc advocates for a rethinking of humanist notions of the relationship between the body and technology through the notion of obsolescence, arguing that the body when positioned as a separate biological subject that uses technologized object never actually existed as such. He extends his rethinking and applies it to the relationship between the body and place in [Rewired/Remixed]{.italic}, writing that "usually, a body performs in the here and now. There is an experience of all-at-onceness, coherency and continuity in the world. In this performance, these parameters are exposed as inadequate and are interrogated with an alternate architecture of awareness and operation."^[85](#Ch01.xhtml#fn1_85){#Ch01.xhtml#bck_fn1_85}^ Here, he is arguing that the way we describe the relationship between the body and place as coherent, linear, and recognizable construction based on experience and memory never existed as such. He then attempts to problematize previous configurations of this relationship by positioning it as unfixed and open to reconfiguration by both the artist performing the work and the viewer/participant experiencing it. For instance, in his writings, he explains how his audio-visual experience differed each day he performed the piece. It varied from the extraordinary to the mundane. The first-person point of view he was experiencing through the HUD combined with the stereo sound caused him to perceive and experience space in "tunnel vision," and he was able to immerse himself in the remote place he was observing.^[86](#Ch01.xhtml#fn1_86){#Ch01.xhtml#bck_fn1_86}^ This immersive experience, he claims, created a disconnect between his body and the physical gallery. Thus, he was able to challenge the coherency and continuity that linear theorizations of place promote, and experience his body, during the performances, as "part physical, part phantom; grounded by gravity but dislocated from a particular place. The body is effectively blind and deaf to its proximal environment, but optically and acoustically extended and aware of remote locations."^[87](#Ch01.xhtml#fn1_87){#Ch01.xhtml#bck_fn1_87}^

It is through this challenge to linear and coherent notions of place and his extension into and awareness of different locations that Stelarc's body becomes the digital interface in this work. His body is the digital interface because it is liminal; it acts as a mediator between entities (the viewer/participant, the artist, the exoskeleton arm) and places (Barcelona, Enschede, Munich). His body also allowed me to, among other things, make sense of the artwork---it provided a sense of coherency and continuity, as it was the only thing in the space that allowed me to navigate the performance and engage with the audio-visual information projected onto the wall. In other words, Stelarc's body acted as the center of meaning constructed by our shared experience of the performance, and in being this way he was able to decenter notions of place and become the "interface" in this installation. One consequence of this designation is a more radical understanding of the digital interface. The digital interface in this work cannot be defined principally by a medium (performance, sculpture, video) or an occupation with media technology itself, but should rather be defined by the operations of its own system. Stelarc echoes my analysis in his writings, stating that "the artist was simply a body, a component in an extended operational system that problematized but equally promised alternate and unexpected outcomes."^[88](#Ch01.xhtml#fn1_88){#Ch01.xhtml#bck_fn1_88}^ Following on from Stelarc, the digital interface in this work then is not a particular object or a specific ephemeral artistic practice. I posit instead that the digital interface becomes a digital interface in conjunction with the interactions, and meanings, that the viewer/participant makes with it.

For example, the exoskeleton arm Stelarc wears is controlled by viewer/participants in the gallery via a large touch screen, and virtual viewer/participants via a webpage. By interacting with this interface, viewer/participants are asked to help choreograph []{#Ch01.xhtml#page_32 .pagebreak title="32"}parts of the performance. As a virtual viewer/participant, I interact with the exoskeleton through the webpage. The webpage, like Stelarc's physiology, is "split." A live stream of the performance plays on the right-hand side of the webpage. The left-hand side contains a rotating three-dimensional rendering of the exoskeleton robotic arm. The phrase "Touch to begin" is located below the image of the arm. When I click on this phrase, the image of the arm rotates to the left and then stops moving. Buttons entitled "preview" and "send" materialize on the top-right and left-hand corners of the webpage. In addition to these buttons, seven words describing the anatomy of the arm---Index Finger, Middle Finger, Ring Finger, Little Finger, Wrist, Elbow, and Shoulder---appear next to their virtual counterparts. I click the words Middle Finger, Ring Finger, Wrist, and Shoulder (see [Plate 6](#Ch04.xhtml#pla5and6)). When I press the preview button, the words disappear. All that remains on the left-hand side of the page is the rendering of the arm. The rendering of the arm then reconfigures itself based on my choices. The phrase "Your configuration has been sent. It will play in approximately 10 seconds" flashes on the screen above the arm, and then the left-hand side of the page resets itself. I eagerly turn my attention to the live stream of the performance happening on the right-hand side of the screen and watch in anticipation. Stelarc eventually moves in response to the choices I made. The wrist and fingers enclosed in the exoskeleton twist and bend, and his shoulder lifts. He moves his unencumbered left arm to shoulder height and bends his body slightly. The shadow projected onto the wall echoes these movements. He holds this pose for a few seconds and then moves on, his body responding to other stimuli. Watching Stelarc's body move in response to my choices encourages me to play. I begin to choreograph a complex web of physical movements by pressing buttons on the interface.

The simple, creative act of play that I perform transforms me from an observer into a viewer/participant. It also, I suggest, changes the way we think about the digital interface, for without viewer/participant interaction, the performance is incomplete. This is because [Rewired/Remixed]{.italic} is a performance that its viewer/participants help create, a performance that we help choreograph through the processes of observation and interaction. For example, my experience of the artwork and the digital interface itself comes from my observations of and interactions with the artists' design (the interface, the website, the exoskeleton arm). [Rewired/Remixed]{.italic} is as much a performance of its viewer/participants as it is of its creator. Thus, I argue that [Rewired/Remixed]{.italic} is an artwork about the ongoing co-constitutive process of its own making.

The questions around the inadequacy of the digital interface that I am exploring through [Rewired/Remixed]{.italic} are less directly about how interfaces have changed, how they operate in space, or how certain definitions of interfaces have become obsolete in a linear or progressive sense (i.e. the move from technical instrument to symbolic screen, to abstract embodied organism). Rather, they revolve around how [concepts]{.italic} that inform the digital interface and [the digital interface as a physical entity itself]{.italic} are located and relocated in theoretical frameworks. I am also interested in the potential that creative rethinking and repositioning of the interface in interactive new media installations can have for breaking binary narratives around technology. Returning, once again, to Stelarc's theory of obsolescence will allow me to begin to suggest some alternatives in this regard.

Rooted in discussions around human--machine interactions and the notion of the cyborg, Stelarc begins his exploration by asking the question of whether "a bipedal, breathing body with binocular vision and a 1400cc brain is an adequate biological []{#Ch01.xhtml#page_33 .pagebreak title="33"}form."^[89](#Ch01.xhtml#fn1_89){#Ch01.xhtml#bck_fn1_89}^ It is this naturalized definition of the human body, as Gary Hall (in Zylinska, 2002) tells us, rather than "some machinic post-human hybrid, which is Stelarc's object for re-design."^[90](#Ch01.xhtml#fn1_90){#Ch01.xhtml#bck_fn1_90}^ Hall continues by adding that just because this particular definition of the body is obsolete does not mean that we can discard it.^[91](#Ch01.xhtml#fn1_91){#Ch01.xhtml#bck_fn1_91}^ Doing away with it, he states, would reduce any creative (re)configurations of the body to a "linear teleological narrative, a narrative in which the biologically given human body is abandoned in favor of some post-human cybersystem."^[92](#Ch01.xhtml#fn1_92){#Ch01.xhtml#bck_fn1_92}^ Stelarc's notion of obsolescence, then, is not about the end of our physical bodies in lieu of some cybernetic other' rather, it is, as Hall states, about "the end of technology---or at least a certain conception of technology which ... has dominated Western thought for almost three thousand years."^[93](#Ch01.xhtml#fn1_93){#Ch01.xhtml#bck_fn1_93}^ The specific view of technology that Hall is referring to here is the Aristotelian one.

Aristotelian positions on technology consider technology as separate from the human being. Thus, technology, when theorized from an Aristotelian point of view, is considered to be an extraneous tool used by humans to accomplish specific goals. In these conceptualizations, technology is considered to be a means to an end. These theories create divisions between the human, technology, and, by extension, the artwork by positioning technology as something exterior to human nature. Stelarc's concept of obsolescence (and the resulting performances that emerge from it) then should not be seen as Cartesian high-tech fantasies of transcending the body via technology; rather, it is about revealing the reductive nature of discourses about technology and our human relationship with it, and then about reconfiguring them.

The notion of obsolescence exposes a fundamental problem with traditional theories of digital interfaces: the desire, on behalf of some theorists and artists, to position interfaces as technologized Others---as empty alien objects that are separate from the human interacting with them. By critically questioning narratives about the relationship between the body and technology via notions of obsolescence, Stelarc is able to confront and undermine this position. He accomplishes this by dismantling naturalized descriptions of the human body, technology, and our relationship with technology, exposing their simplicity and, in effect, their inadequacy. In doing so, our relationship with technology is not seen as one of opposites (a distinct human self and an empty technological object) or antagonism (an "originary" or pure human body vs. the alien technological Other), but as a relational and co-constitutive part of humanity. In this way, Stelarc's concept of obsolescence can offer us a theoretical framework to analyze the relationship between the digital interface and the viewer/participant in interactive new media installations. When the relationship between the human and technology is theorized as the merger of one human entity and one foreign technological object, what is at stake is neither futuristic ideology nor a repetition of a symmetrical past and future; rather, it is similar to the contradictions referenced by Derrida above---or, as Hall terms it, "undecidability."^[94](#Ch01.xhtml#fn1_94){#Ch01.xhtml#bck_fn1_94}^ Instead of attempting to resolve this confusion by creating conceptual distinctions between objects and subjects, by conflating people (the subject, the artist, the theorist) and things (technology, the artwork, a place), Stelarc, like the viewer/participant in [Remixed/Rewired]{.italic}, embraces it via playful experimentation.

If we take this to be the case, if [Rewired/Remixed]{.italic} can be seen as a performance about its own making, and if, as Stelarc argues, the concept of obsolescence and the process of art making itself are about "exposing, undermining and developing alternative strategies and aesthetics" via exploration, then the interface in [Rewired/Remixed]{.italic} []{#Ch01.xhtml#page_34 .pagebreak title="34"}cannot be positioned as a neutral object.^[95](#Ch01.xhtml#fn1_95){#Ch01.xhtml#bck_fn1_95}^ Nor can the viewer/participant be theorized as a subject that has been absorbed into or negated by technology. These specific understandings of the digital interface simply do not apply to this installation. Instead, I posit that the digital interface in this work emerges out of, and in conjunction with, the viewer/participant's interactions with it, and in doing this it generates contradictions and undecidability, thus providing us with alternative possibilities and strategies for conceptualizing and interacting with the digital interface.

My intention in the rest of this book is therefore not to argue that the digital interface as a physical object itself has disappeared. It most certainly exists. Rather, I posit that the term "digital interface" is the name given to the active form by those who create, analyze, and use it, and that draws upon, produces, and constantly reproduces the complex and dynamic processes that constitute it. In this way, I can begin to suggest that the processes that make up the digital interface, and to a certain extent the digital interface itself, become both reciprocal and open to reconfiguration. The digital interface, then, as exemplified above, becomes both an active and integral part of the relationships that it contains and remediates, as well as a deeply entangled part of the system that constitutes the interactive new media installation. This system includes the artists, the viewer/participant, the interface, and the interactive new media installation itself. By rethinking the digital interface in terms of its specific dynamism in interactive new media installations, I may begin to question how it is perceived by the viewer/participant, constructed and deployed by artists and utilized by the viewer/participant. It also allows me to begin to introduce a much more networked model of the digital interface in interactive new media installations---one that (re)positions the relationship between the digital interface and the viewer/participant as co-constituted and relational.

# [[2 []{#Ch02.xhtml#page_38 .pagebreak title="38"}The Embodied Interface]{.bold}](#content.xhtml#bck_Ch02) {#Ch02.xhtml#Ch02}

In the previous chapter, I explored scholarly texts that attempt to rethink the digital interface in interactive new media installations. Narratives of the digital interface were presented and analyzed in relation to the previously posited theories around the technology that they replicate, and the series of socio-political and cultural anxieties or concerns that the digital interface comes to represent.^[1](#Ch02.xhtml#fn2_1){#Ch02.xhtml#bck_fn2_1}^ Rereading these narratives, I proposed an alternative theory of the digital interface: one that positions it as an aesthetic process. I develop this idea further in this chapter, through a discussion of the embodied interface. I theorize the embodied interface in posthumanist terms; as a non-binary, non-oppositional, hybrid of machine and organism, one that questions previously posited notions of the body, embodiment, and identity. Issues around the potential challenges to the aforementioned notions that the use of the embodied interface in interactive new media installations creates are the central focus of this chapter.

In what follows, I present an analysis of the relationship between the body and technology as a co-constitutive and collaboratively produced experience.^[2](#Ch02.xhtml#fn2_2){#Ch02.xhtml#bck_fn2_2}^ I will outline what is at stake in this reconsideration, arguing that the relationship between the body and technology in interactive new media installations is unstable, uncertain, and, to a certain extent, open to reconfiguration by the viewer/participant. Who or what constitutes the relationship between the body and technology in interactive new media installations? How does the artist creating the digital interface and the viewer/participant interfacing with it reconfigure this relationship? How might a reconceptualization of the relationship between the body and technology as co-constitutive and collaboratively produced help us find alternative routes into -- and different ways of thinking about -- the interface in interactive new media installations?

To address these questions, in the first half of this chapter, I examine how the relationship between the body and technology is articulated through the use of the embodied interface in the artwork of Victoria Vesna (2005--7) and Tmema (2006). These installation are crucial to this investigation as the embodied interface is positioned as co-constitutive and processual -- an entity that is produced by and is constantly producing, subjects, objects, and meanings. I build on this analysis in the second half of this chapter, exploring how representationalist structures of meaning manifest themselves in interactive new media installations. I suggest that the ability to participate in the meaning-making process provides the viewer/participant with an opportunity to engage with, subvert, and restructure (within certain parameters) the underlying narratives that help shape her experience in interactive new media installations. I posit that this approach shifts focus away from theorizing the subject in oppositional or []{#Ch02.xhtml#page_39 .pagebreak title="39"}binary terms, as an operational entity whose actions are defined as exterior to technology, towards considering her an integral part of the installation -- an embodied viewer/participant whose interactions with the digital interface have consequences in interactive new media art installations. The notion of an embodied viewer/participant whose interactions have repercussions in interactive new media installations enables me to theorize the encounter between the viewer/participant and the embodied interface as generative -- as an ongoing, open-ended process. From this perspective, the embodied interface is unstable, uncertain, and open to reconfiguration, as the designation of the viewer/participant, rather than interface, as locus of interaction means that the illusion that the artist has complete control over the action occurring in the installation is, to an extent, broken.

## [[The Viewer/Participant or the Interface?]{.bold}](#content.xhtml#bck_sec2_1) {#Ch02.xhtml#sec2_1}

Amelia Jones (2012) explores the relationship between the body and technology as it relates to notions of identity and subjectivity in contemporary fine arts contexts, arguing that art, technology, and individualism are co-constitutive structures of belief.^[3](#Ch02.xhtml#fn2_3){#Ch02.xhtml#bck_fn2_3}^ They are co-constitutive, she states, because the modern subject and, consequently, identity and technology are products of discourses about art (among other things).^[4](#Ch02.xhtml#fn2_4){#Ch02.xhtml#bck_fn2_4}^ For example, concepts of identity, Jones tells us, emerges around the same period in time as notions of art and aesthetics (early Renaissance Europe), reaching their height during the Enlightenment period continuing into the nineteenth and twentieth centuries (i.e. Modernism).^[5](#Ch02.xhtml#fn2_5){#Ch02.xhtml#bck_fn2_5}^ Therefore, the concept of art---specifically art as an inherently superior mode of human production---comes into being at the same time as identity (i.e. when Western Europeans are encountering profoundly different cultural experiences and practices, and feel the need to assert themselves as unique individuals).^[6](#Ch02.xhtml#fn2_6){#Ch02.xhtml#bck_fn2_6}^ Furthermore, the notion of art as a unique, physical expression of an individual separate from other things arises in conjunction with the development of the first technologies of mass reproduction (i.e. the printing press). From its slow development, out of a more collective-based Western European belief system, coupled with the advent of new technologies and systems of thought, the idea of the modern subject, Jones writes, took on specific characteristics in Euro-American thought.^[7](#Ch02.xhtml#fn2_7){#Ch02.xhtml#bck_fn2_7}^ The co-constitutive notions of identity and art come to a head in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries with the ideological construction of "the artist" as the paradigmatic instance of the modern individual.^[8](#Ch02.xhtml#fn2_8){#Ch02.xhtml#bck_fn2_8}^ However, the type of person who could assume the identity of "artist," at this time, was limited to white, European men. Thus, Jones argues that art is not only a binary construction, but is always identified with an individual (again, usually a white, European male).^[9](#Ch02.xhtml#fn2_9){#Ch02.xhtml#bck_fn2_9}^

The concept of identity---specifically who can or cannot lay claim to one---along with art (who can or cannot make it) changed, to an extent, in the 1970s and 1980s. Deeply informed by psychoanalysis, Marxism, feminist theory, and post-structuralism, concepts of identity in the art world, Jones states, became "relatively fixed" around the psychoanalyitic binary of the "male gaze" and woman as "fetish," with theorists and artists, such as Judy Chicago and Miriam Schapiro, arguing against the "essentializing" quality of female imagery created during this time period.^[10](#Ch02.xhtml#fn2_10){#Ch02.xhtml#bck_fn2_10}^ This imagery was deemed essentializing by these theorists, because they displayed fixed, or static, signs of femininity (submissiveness, visual representations of female anatomical body parts). Therefore, these scholars and artists argued that these works []{#Ch02.xhtml#page_40 .pagebreak title="40"}were "fetishistic," in that they are based on the belief that a "female essence" resides somewhere in the body of women.^[11](#Ch02.xhtml#fn2_11){#Ch02.xhtml#bck_fn2_11}^ While important to the development of the meaning of visual images of women, Jones argues that the theories briefly elaborated on above "were themselves binarizing" as they reproduced the same oppositional "good vs. bad" and "self vs. other" dichotomies that they were critiquing.^[12](#Ch02.xhtml#fn2_12){#Ch02.xhtml#bck_fn2_12}^ While attempts have been made to address the aforementioned issues, these binaries, Jones concludes, still exist in the art world and beyond. So, if identity is a binary construction and, in Jones's words, "still the key pressure in determining how we navigate the world of visual culture," then how can we move beyond this construct? How can we provide understandings of the relationship between the body, identity, and technology that are not binary and oppositional?

Jones offers one alternative structure of thought for examining these relationships in works of art---one that she claims resists the reductive binaries of identity described above. She calls this approach queer feminist durationality.^[13](#Ch02.xhtml#fn2_13){#Ch02.xhtml#bck_fn2_13}^ Queer feminist durationality is a collection of strategies that indicate the potential for doing something with artworks through interpretation.^[14](#Ch02.xhtml#fn2_14){#Ch02.xhtml#bck_fn2_14}^ Jones positions this approach in opposition to binary theorizations of art, identity, and identification. Queer feminist durationality therefore has the potential to reactive artworks "by returning them to process and embodiment---linking the interpreting body of the present with the bodies referenced or performed in the past as the work of art."^[15](#Ch02.xhtml#fn2_15){#Ch02.xhtml#bck_fn2_15}^

The definition of the three words---queer, feminist and durationality---are important to Jones's theoretical model. The word durationality is used in reference to Henri Bergson's phenomenological philosophy of embodied experience, time, and technology rather than time- or performance-based artworks.^[16](#Ch02.xhtml#fn2_16){#Ch02.xhtml#bck_fn2_16}^ She deploys this concept as a way of rejuvenating the aesthetic of artwork by repositioning it outside the traditional, binary forms of seeing and identifying.^[17](#Ch02.xhtml#fn2_17){#Ch02.xhtml#bck_fn2_17}^ By doing this, the artwork, she tells us, is moved outside the Kantian "purview of a judgmental, specialist [gaze]{.italic}," allowing for more open-ended interpretations to emerge.^[18](#Ch02.xhtml#fn2_18){#Ch02.xhtml#bck_fn2_18}^ For Jones, this move is important as it possesses the ability to both empower the viewer/participant, allowing them to form new meanings and connections with the artwork, as well as expose the "projections, identifications and circuits and desires" of the interpreter and artist.^[19](#Ch02.xhtml#fn2_19){#Ch02.xhtml#bck_fn2_19}^ Jones's definition of durationality contextualizes her approach to the word "feminist." She uses the term in direct reference to how feminist approaches to visual theory reveal and then complicate fixed meanings and interpretations through revealing the bodies and investments that play a role in the interpretation of art.^[20](#Ch02.xhtml#fn2_20){#Ch02.xhtml#bck_fn2_20}^ Finally, the word "queer" refers to "bodies and individuals identified with particular sexual practices" and to the potential of bodies, as well as images, text, and performances, to disrupt ways of seeing, doing, and identifying through our ability to open ourselves to particular aspects of the world.^[21](#Ch02.xhtml#fn2_21){#Ch02.xhtml#bck_fn2_21}^ Jones argues that the word "queer" has the ability to problematize "the idea that we can know what we see and installs durationality, and its corollary qualities of undecidability and unknowability at the heart of meaning."^[22](#Ch02.xhtml#fn2_22){#Ch02.xhtml#bck_fn2_22}^ Thus, "queer," she writes, avoids essentializing experience as it "[indicates the impossibility of a subject or a meaning staying still]{.italic}, all in one determinable place."^[23](#Ch02.xhtml#fn2_23){#Ch02.xhtml#bck_fn2_23}^

Jones combines the aforementioned concepts (queer, feminist, duration) with Rosi Braidotti's 2012 posthumanist notion of radical relationality throughout her theorization. She does this in order to create new forms of social interaction through the ability, on behalf of the subject, to enter into modes of relation with multiple others.^[24](#Ch02.xhtml#fn2_24){#Ch02.xhtml#bck_fn2_24}^ By entering into these modes of relation, the subject, Jones argues, becomes []{#Ch02.xhtml#page_41 .pagebreak title="41"}interrelated with the building of identification, and thus becomes responsible for her participation in the meaning-making process.^[25](#Ch02.xhtml#fn2_25){#Ch02.xhtml#bck_fn2_25}^ Radical relationality is non-oppositional, in the sense that the agency of the subject is not connected to the present through negation; rather, these connections, she writes, "are affirmative and geared to creating possible futures."^[26](#Ch02.xhtml#fn2_26){#Ch02.xhtml#bck_fn2_26}^ In short, through her linguistic figuration of queer feminist durationality and its connection with notions of radical relationality, Jones is providing us with a model for analyzing contemporary artworks---one that intentionally interprets and misinterprets them, allowing us to reflect on and critically think about how we identify with and construct our experiences with art and with others in non-binary terms.

In what follows I apply Jones's model of queer feminist durationality to Victoria Vesna's interactive new media installation [Mood Swings]{.italic} (2005--7). My aim is to open up a discussion around the binaries discussed above and move them in a different direction, interrogating both the limits and the potentials of the relationship between the body, embodiment, and identity in interactive new media art installations. By doing this, I am responding not only to Jones's call for a more relational mode of interpreting art, but also to an insight she proposed around the difficulties in opening new paths in discussions about the relationship between the self and art. The key to opening these paths, she writes, is to "acknowledge the complex histories of art and theory explicitly addressing the politics of identity, respecting the important need in the past to identify (construct) binaries, while eschewing the repetition of these binaries in a renewed theoretical framework."^[27](#Ch02.xhtml#fn2_27){#Ch02.xhtml#bck_fn2_27}^ I argue that [Mood Swings]{.italic} opens up exactly one of these paths through its staging of the relationship between the body and technology. This relationship is staged (by Vesna) and consequently theorized here, as co-constitutive and emergent. This is a staging that I suggest places emphasis on the relationship between the viewer/participant and the interface as a process of identification, on behalf of the viewer/participant, that not only shapes, but is [shaped by]{.italic} concepts of embodiment and relationality. Therefore, it is a staging that enables me to call attention to the processes and histories that this relationship enfolds and to demonstrate the importance non-oppositional frameworks of thinking about art, identity, and embodiment have in interactive new media installations.

[Mood Swings]{.italic} contains two important entities: the interface (technology) and the viewer/participant (the body). These two entities look and feel distinctive, and it could be argued that they exist in opposition to each other. While they look and feel different, these entities do not have separate ontological existences, as they reproduce and are constantly reproducing each other; that is to say, the interface and the viewer/participant in the work are not [inherently]{.italic} binary. Rather, the pixelated image and the viewer/participant exist in relation to one another. Given this, I suggest that they can productively be read through each other for similarities and differences, highlighting new possibilities for understanding their relationship to each other as performative and co-constitutive. However, to do this, I must attend to and acknowledge, as Jones writes above, the materiality of all the forms found in the work, while refusing to allow the seemingly obvious binary human vs. non-human readings of the relationship between the body and technology to come to the fore.

[Mood Swings]{.italic} consists of a video projector, a computer, closed-circuit cameras, and a projection surface. The camera records the viewer/participant's actions. These actions are transmitted to a computer and processed. These actions take the form of an image of the viewer/participant that is displayed on the projection surface.^[28](#Ch02.xhtml#fn2_28){#Ch02.xhtml#bck_fn2_28}^ The []{#Ch02.xhtml#page_42 .pagebreak title="42"}image of the viewer/participant is the digital interface in this work. This is because the image, like those in the previous chapter, allows the viewer/participant to navigate the installation and engage with the visual information projected onto the screen. The image of the viewer/participant is pixelated to the point of abstraction; the only thing that marks it as "human" is its silhouette. When the viewer/participant walks across the floor, her pixelated image travels across the projection surface. This movement causes digital video trails to appear. These trails slowly erode the pixelated image---they pull it apart---and "poetic texts" appear in its place.^[29](#Ch02.xhtml#fn2_29){#Ch02.xhtml#bck_fn2_29}^ If the viewer/participant moves back and forth in front of the projection surface a certain number of times, or if she stands still in front of it, the texts dissipate and her pixelated image re-appears.^[30](#Ch02.xhtml#fn2_30){#Ch02.xhtml#bck_fn2_30}^ [Mood Swings]{.italic} also contains audio-visual shifts. When the viewer/participant acts the piece reacts: the image changes color, shifting from red to yellow to green to blue. Changes in the color of the image occur in tandem with shifts in audio, moving from irritating and disturbing to peaceful and calming.

Viewer/participant interaction with [Mood Swings]{.italic} is aesthetically similar to interaction found in the installations discussed in [Chapter 1](#Ch01.xhtml)---specifically Utterback's [Untitled 5]{.italic} and Knep's [Deep Wounds---]{.italic} as it involves humans interacting with visual images that are projected onto a screen. However, the conceptual idea that underlies [Mood Swings]{.italic} differs from the other installations discussed thus far. Informed in part by Vesna's collaboration with a Psychiatry and Biobehavioral Sciences research group at the University of California Los Angeles (UCLA), specializing in the environmental effects on mental health, [Mood Swings]{.italic}, according to Vesna, is a comment on the state of women's mental health in the USA.^[31](#Ch02.xhtml#fn2_31){#Ch02.xhtml#bck_fn2_31}^ The audio shifts and color changes mentioned above are visual representations of these environmental effects on women's mental health.^[32](#Ch02.xhtml#fn2_32){#Ch02.xhtml#bck_fn2_32}^ The audio shifts and changes in color last one minute each, and it is striking to feel the difference they have on the way one interacts and consequently, identifies with the work. I argue that these audio-visual shifts and changes bring about an embodied and temporal relationality, one which effects, to an extent, the body of the viewer/participant in an almost visceral way. This is an embodied and temporal relationality that parallels the kind of relationality Jones discusses in her theorization above.

The first time I viewed [Mood Swings]{.italic} was in January 2012. I had just moved from London, UK to Helsinki, FI. Visual documentation of the work was projected onto the wall of my studio. I watched the sunset out of the window, the sky changing colors as the video played on the wall. The colors of the video shifted from yellow to green to blue. The changes in the color of the video corresponded to the changes in the sky around me (my environment). Helsinki is a city that gets about six hours of sunlight a day in the winter months.^[33](#Ch02.xhtml#fn2_33){#Ch02.xhtml#bck_fn2_33}^ The sky takes on a blue color during this time. I paused the video when it turned blue, as it visually matched what I was viewing out of my window and what I was feeling at the time (stressed and exhausted). The shifts in color (both on the wall and out the window) reflected the ephemeral and slightly unstable fluctuations of the artwork's abstracted, pixelated interface. [Mood Swings]{.italic}' interface, which is a shadow of the viewer/participant, spoke to me of the paradox of women's bodies: always belonging to others, unstable, constantly in a state of fragmentation, being pulled into parts by the demands and desires of others. The instability of the interface, and the shifts and changes in the work that accompanied it, created a dialogue between the impermanence and virtuality of the interface and the work of art, and permanence and physicality of my body and my surrounding environment. This was not a binary here vs. there, real vs. technological, male vs. female dialogue; rather, []{#Ch02.xhtml#page_43 .pagebreak title="43"}it was relational in the sense that it provided me with points of (dis)identification and engagement with the artwork: with the interface and with myself. It reached out to me and allowed me to create connections with and meanings out of bodies and things that I was unable to interact with in real life.

In this way, the emphasis, in this work, via both the abstracted dissipating pixelated images that appear on the screen and the audio-visual changes that accompany them is placed on co-constitution and on relationality. More specifically, how the viewer/participant via her pixelated on-screen image is able to create, separate, and critically explore the relationships that the body and technology represents---to (dis)identify with them, only to bring them back together, to dissolve them and to rebuild them anew. The emphasis on co-constitution in [Mood Swings]{.italic} acknowledges the fact that a more relational reading of the relationship between the body and technology might disrupt or even reverse more traditional, binary structures and assumptions about this relationship found in the art world and beyond. Thus, it allows the viewer/participant, the digital interface, their interactions with each other, and the effects they have on the installation to matter beyond mere representation. I also suggest that this emphasis affords the viewer/participant the chance to begin to reconsider and possibly develop different understandings of her relationship to the digital interface in [Mood Swings]{.italic}. These understandings allow both the viewer/participant and the interface to come into view as relational entities that are deeply entangled with each other's embodied being and that form mutually productive parts of the poetic texts that they help create.

## [[The Human "Me" and the Technologized "You"]{.bold}](#content.xhtml#bck_sec2_2) {#Ch02.xhtml#sec2_2}

In what follows, I stage an encounter between Jean-Luc Nancy's (2000) notions of "Being" and "the event" as simultaneous, co-constitutive feelings, on behalf of subjects, of perpetual presence and Tmema's interactive new media installation [Footfalls]{.italic} (2006). I do this to make sense of the effects that the viewer/participant's movements and interactions have in [Footfalls]{.italic}, and of how the relationship between the body and technology helps bring the embodied interface into being in interactive new media installations. In my analysis, I suggest that the specific events and effects that the relationship between the body and technology helps to give the interface presence, bring the interface into being, and allow it to matter in [Footfalls]{.italic}.^[34](#Ch02.xhtml#fn2_34){#Ch02.xhtml#bck_fn2_34}^

I will be referring to viewer/participant interaction using Barad's term "intra-action."^[35](#Ch02.xhtml#fn2_35){#Ch02.xhtml#bck_fn2_35}^ Intra-action, according to Barad, is a concept that assumes there is no in between or object of mediation and, as such, entities are mutually co-constitutive.^[36](#Ch02.xhtml#fn2_36){#Ch02.xhtml#bck_fn2_36}^ This relationship of intra-action, in Barad's formulation, is primary and individuation is secondary.^[37](#Ch02.xhtml#fn2_37){#Ch02.xhtml#bck_fn2_37}^ That is to say, in intra-action, entities only become meaningful and present through their relationship with one another. Thus, intra-action differs from notions of interaction because interaction, Barad argues, assumes that entities exist prior to each other.

Similar to Barad's notion of intra-action, Nancy's conceptualization of "Being" relies on relationality. "Being," according to Nancy, does not exist without the "being-with."^[38](#Ch02.xhtml#fn2_38){#Ch02.xhtml#bck_fn2_38}^ The "I," he states, does not precede the "we" because there is no existence without co-existence.^[39](#Ch02.xhtml#fn2_39){#Ch02.xhtml#bck_fn2_39}^ "Being," for Nancy, is always already a process of becoming with others.^[40](#Ch02.xhtml#fn2_40){#Ch02.xhtml#bck_fn2_40}^ As he writes: "Being cannot [be]{.italic} anything but being-with-one-another, circulating in the [with]{.italic} and as the [with]{.italic} of this singularly plural coexistence."^[41](#Ch02.xhtml#fn2_41){#Ch02.xhtml#bck_fn2_41}^ What []{#Ch02.xhtml#page_44 .pagebreak title="44"}Nancy is proposing here is that being is not a stand-alone process produced by a solitary entity. "Being" instead suggests a simultaneous, entangled feeling, on behalf of the subject, of perpetual presence.^[42](#Ch02.xhtml#fn2_42){#Ch02.xhtml#bck_fn2_42}^

This feeling of presence, as Marie-Eve Morin (2012) tells us, is "a consequence of \[being\] 'singular plural': there is no single independent truth that could be immediately identified as the beginning."^[43](#Ch02.xhtml#fn2_43){#Ch02.xhtml#bck_fn2_43}^ Morin continues by stating that "Being," to Nancy, signals "first of all that there is always by necessity more than one singularity."^[44](#Ch02.xhtml#fn2_44){#Ch02.xhtml#bck_fn2_44}^ Since "Being," as Nancy writes, means "to be-unto-the limit or to be-opened-to," then this opening, as Morin writes, "is necessarily 'with': it is impossible to open oneself to oneself without exteriority."^[45](#Ch02.xhtml#fn2_45){#Ch02.xhtml#bck_fn2_45}^ "Being" then, specifically being singular-plural, is not an attempt to position a concept or an entity as a singular, isolated, or indivisible thing.^[46](#Ch02.xhtml#fn2_46){#Ch02.xhtml#bck_fn2_46}^ "Being" signifies a process of singularization, thus it suggests both an entanglement with and a differentiation from temporarily positioned others.^[47](#Ch02.xhtml#fn2_47){#Ch02.xhtml#bck_fn2_47}^ In short, "Being" is a non-linear, ongoing process that always consists of more than one thing. It is, as Nancy writes, "an excess of unity; it is one-with-one where its Being in itself is co-present."^[48](#Ch02.xhtml#fn2_48){#Ch02.xhtml#bck_fn2_48}^ Plurality and co-presence, as Nancy reminds us, should not be confused with notions of the eternal or transcendental.^[49](#Ch02.xhtml#fn2_49){#Ch02.xhtml#bck_fn2_49}^ Rather, co-presence denotes "the essential sharing of essentiality, sharing in the guise of assembling as it were."^[50](#Ch02.xhtml#fn2_50){#Ch02.xhtml#bck_fn2_50}^ So, when Nancy states that "being cannot [be]{.italic} anything but being-with," "the with" is not exterior or prior to something else. It is not an addition to it, but rather "the with" constitutes "Being."^[51](#Ch02.xhtml#fn2_51){#Ch02.xhtml#bck_fn2_51}^ The use of the interface in [Footfalls]{.italic} could be interpreted to serve as an illustration of Nancy's ideas around "Being" in the sense that its interface is not simply an addition to the installation. Rather, the interface, like "the with" in Nancy's theorization of "Being," constitutes the installation itself.

![fig2_1.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/4WGnQdF.jpeg)

On its surface, [Footfalls]{.italic} is an incredibly simple work. Its aesthetic is reminiscent of seminal interactive new media art works such as Simon Penny's [Traces]{.italic} (1998) and Myron Krueger's [VideoPlace]{.italic} (1974).^[52](#Ch02.xhtml#fn2_52){#Ch02.xhtml#bck_fn2_52}^ Their interfaces are similar too: projected []{#Ch02.xhtml#page_45 .pagebreak title="45"}images of the viewer/participant. However, [Footfall]{.italic}'s underlying idea is in some ways more complex than its predecessors. [Footfalls]{.italic}, according to its artists, is designed to provoke questions about the meaning of the relationship between the body and technology, and the effects that movement and interaction have on immersive environments.^[53](#Ch02.xhtml#fn2_53){#Ch02.xhtml#bck_fn2_53}^ An outgrowth of Tmema's work [Messa di Voce]{.italic} (2003), [Footfalls]{.italic} consists of a wall, a projector, and a computer.^[54](#Ch02.xhtml#fn2_54){#Ch02.xhtml#bck_fn2_54}^ The wall is split into thirds: the top contains a series of black-and-white images that represent static spheres of varying size, the space in the middle is left blank, and the bottom third of the screen consists of a projected shadow of the viewer/participant which she can control by moving her body. Once the piece is activated, the balls stream down from the top of the screen. The viewer/participant can then interact with the projected spheres---she can pick them up and throw them around the screen via her shadow.

To activate [Footfalls]{.italic}, the viewer/participant must step onto a platform located in front of the wall.^[55](#Ch02.xhtml#fn2_55){#Ch02.xhtml#bck_fn2_55}^ When she "stomps" her feet, a circuit board embedded in microphones located inside the platform records these vibrations and transmits them to a computer for processing.^[56](#Ch02.xhtml#fn2_56){#Ch02.xhtml#bck_fn2_56}^ This data is sent to another computer connected to a projector, where it is again processed and then projected onto the wall. The newly processed data changes the state of the projected spheres.^[57](#Ch02.xhtml#fn2_57){#Ch02.xhtml#bck_fn2_57}^ It sets them in motion, causing them to bounce back and forth. It also dictates the size, speed, and number of spheres appearing on the wall. Once the spheres gain enough velocity, they begin to cascade down from the top half of the wall towards the bottom, where they collect around the shadow. At this point, the viewer/participant can catch the spheres and throw them around or off-screen by moving her limbs. If another viewer/participant happens to be located in the same space, an image of her physical body will be captured and projected onto the wall. Both viewer/participants, via their on-screen shadow, can then intra-act with the spheres and with each other.

When viewing [Footfalls]{.italic} either online or in a gallery, viewer/participant intra-action feels spontaneous. While it may be so, intra-action is not a happy accident. Intra-action in [Footfalls]{.italic}, like "Being" in Nancy's theory of the singular-plural, is an experimental, exploratory process that happens in conjunction with and is thus influenced by others. That there needs to be others present in order for intra-action to occur does not imply that there needs to be a human "me" and a technologized "you," but that there must be, in Nancy's terms "a with" or, as Morin states, "an us and a something else, and that there needs to be a plurality within myself."^[58](#Ch02.xhtml#fn2_58){#Ch02.xhtml#bck_fn2_58}^ Given this, Morin argues that entities intra-act "in relation/exposition to you, an 'event of me' exists in relation/exposition to other events."^[59](#Ch02.xhtml#fn2_59){#Ch02.xhtml#bck_fn2_59}^ Hence, intra-action neither affirms symmetry between two or more entities, nor does it dissolve the boundaries between them. Intra-action happens through exposition---through an exposure to, and creative exploration with, other entities.

So, how does viewer/participant intra-action occur in [Footfalls]{.italic}? Viewer/participant intra-action in [Footfalls]{.italic} occurs because the viewer/participant can manipulate and create information located in the installation via the presence of her shadow. She is able to, via her shadow, extend and expand her body into the installation---an act that, as briefly suggested in the introduction, links technology to the embodied experience of the viewer/participant. However, the process of embodiment described above is not a fully conscious one. It can be seen as primarily corporeal and affective, only later becoming theorized and reflected on by the critic/scholar and the viewer/participant respectively. This is because the relationship between the body and technology as it manifests

![fig2_2.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/5EM1dcl.jpeg)

itself in [Footfalls]{.italic} is never self-evident, never concrete. Therefore, the shadow (the interface) cannot be analyzed as a direct representation of the relationship, as intra-action between the body and technology, or, in Nancy's terms, as "the with."^[60](#Ch02.xhtml#fn2_60){#Ch02.xhtml#bck_fn2_60}^ Rather, I suggest that these entities and the relationship between them should be theorized as happening or emerging out of and through "the with" (the relationship between the body and technology). This is because the shadow in this work is not simply a []{#Ch02.xhtml#page_47 .pagebreak title="47"}representation of the viewer/participant, but a physical after-effect of the relationship between the body and technology.

For example, when a viewer/participant picks up a sphere via her shadow and tosses it around the screen, she could be seen as expressing a trace of this "with" or the relationship between the body and technology. I argue that it is precisely this expression of the "with" through intra-action that enables the digital interface (the shadow) to become present in [Footfalls]{.italic}. However, just because something resembling an interface exists in the installation does not mean that it automatically [is]{.italic} an interface.^[61](#Ch02.xhtml#fn2_61){#Ch02.xhtml#bck_fn2_61}^ For, as Nancy writes, the subject "is not a 'subject' in the sense of the relation of a self to itself. It is an 'ipseity' that is not the relation of a 'me' to 'itself' ... It is being-a-part of Being itself and in Being itself, Being in each instant, which attests to the fact that Being only takes place in each instant."^[62](#Ch02.xhtml#fn2_62){#Ch02.xhtml#bck_fn2_62}^ If we take this to be the case, if, as Nancy argues, "the essence of Being only takes place in each instant," and if, as posited above, intra-action between two entities articulates a trace of "the with," then when the viewer/participant "happens with" the digital interface in [Footfalls]{.italic}, an area for experimentation, reconsideration, and possibly criticism of their relationship to, and intra-actions with, the digital interface appears.^[63](#Ch02.xhtml#fn2_63){#Ch02.xhtml#bck_fn2_63}^ Or, in Nancy's terms, a space of "betweens" is opened up.^[64](#Ch02.xhtml#fn2_64){#Ch02.xhtml#bck_fn2_64}^

Nancy argues that: "Everything ... passes [between]{.italic} us. This 'between,' as its name implies, has neither a consistency nor continuity of its own. It does not lead from one to the other; it constitutes no connective tissue, no cement, no bridge."^[65](#Ch02.xhtml#fn2_65){#Ch02.xhtml#bck_fn2_65}^ So, when a link is created between the viewer/participant and the digital interface via embodiment, the movements that the viewer/participant makes in conjunction with the digital interface, while part of a larger ongoing process, are temporarily stabilized through the processes of representation.^[66](#Ch02.xhtml#fn2_66){#Ch02.xhtml#bck_fn2_66}^ For example, when the viewer/participants stomps on the platform, her actions are recorded, filtered, and visual representations of her actions (the spheres) are projected on-screen. However, the very processes of emergence, embodiment, and intra-action that give these visual representations presence involve human experimentation---experimentation that is, as suggested above, accompanied (or in some cases proceeded, interrupted, or followed) by technological forces. This process, as Sarah Kember and Joanna Zylinska (2012) write, is "a hybrid: it interweaves different entities, or rather it stabilizes or 'fixes' entities in the process of interweaving them."^[67](#Ch02.xhtml#fn2_67){#Ch02.xhtml#bck_fn2_67}^ These temporary singular fixes become events in the ongoing processes of emergence and embodiment (which Nancy refers to as "the eventness of the event" or "[the fact]{.italic} that it happens").^[68](#Ch02.xhtml#fn2_68){#Ch02.xhtml#bck_fn2_68}^

However, Nancy argues that what makes an event an event "is not only that it happens, but that it surprises---and maybe that it surprises itself (diverting it from its own 'happening', not allowing it be an event, surprising the "Being" in it, allowing it to "be" only by way of surprise)."^[69](#Ch02.xhtml#fn2_69){#Ch02.xhtml#bck_fn2_69}^ An event, for Nancy, is [not]{.italic} a [happening]{.italic} itself, but the "as it happens," thus, "it is the 'already' that leaps up, along with the 'not yet.'"^[70](#Ch02.xhtml#fn2_70){#Ch02.xhtml#bck_fn2_70}^ While an event can be represented (as a physical action, in still or moving images, or as verbal or written words), as Nancy reminds us, it primarily exists outside of the order of representation.^[71](#Ch02.xhtml#fn2_71){#Ch02.xhtml#bck_fn2_71}^ For instance, the event is the moment when the leap---or the relationship that emerges out of the leap---surprises itself. It surprises itself precisely because it is, to an extent, unrepresentable, as the event is not an expression of "itself" or its surprise.^[72](#Ch02.xhtml#fn2_72){#Ch02.xhtml#bck_fn2_72}^ In Nancy's words, "the leap" happens in conjunction with "the surprise."^[73](#Ch02.xhtml#fn2_73){#Ch02.xhtml#bck_fn2_73}^ The leap, he states, is "nothing but this surprise, which still does not even 'belong' to it \[the event itself\]."^[74](#Ch02.xhtml#fn2_74){#Ch02.xhtml#bck_fn2_74}^ It is the interruption of this process that draws []{#Ch02.xhtml#page_48 .pagebreak title="48"}attention to the fact that the event is actually occurring. Thus, the event surprises itself through its own discontinuity, and it is this surprise that consequently allows the unrepresentable (the interface) to become present and to matter.

Nancy's notions of "Being" and the event articulate exactly why the relationship between the body and technology matters in interactive new media installations. It matters because the digital interface in [Footfalls]{.italic} emerges out of the viewer/participant's multiple intra-actions and relationship with it (the event), and this emergence of the interface as an interface is the surprise of the event. It leaps out of the relationship between the body and technology. The emergence of the shadow as digital interface is the surprise that simultaneously pushes the digital interface outside of representation, and acts as the point at which it can become represented. The relationship between the body and technology constitutes the event; the fact that the shadow emerges out of and with these intra-actions and relationships, and becomes a digital interface is the surprise of its event. This is because the movements that the viewer/participant makes with the shadow that the relationship between the body and technology brings about are precisely the events that constitute its emergence and allow it to become a digital interface. The surprise of this event is significant because it is the moment when the interface is revealed to be an important active agent---one that contributes to and has the ability to create change in---the installation. In other words, we can predict, to an extent, what will happen in [Footfalls]{.italic} when we interact with the interface (and predict how our interactions may change the installation). However, that is not what allows the interface to become present; the reason that it is present is not that it exists or that it can be represented. The overwhelming majority of interactive new media installations have interfaces. Rather, the interface in [Footfalls]{.italic} has presence because it is an integral agent, an active part of a complex, open-ended, temporal aesthetic process initiated by the artists (in the past) and irrevocably shaped by the relationship between the body and technology (in the present), and those who encounter and interact with it in the future.

## [[The "Real" and the Representational]{.bold}](#content.xhtml#bck_sec2_3) {#Ch02.xhtml#sec2_3}

Peggy Phelan (1993) investigates the distinction between the representation and "the real" as it relates to visual power and visibility in photography. She argues, in short, that there is confusion between the representation and the "real" on behalf of the subject who is viewing the photographs.^[75](#Ch02.xhtml#fn2_75){#Ch02.xhtml#bck_fn2_75}^ Confusion between the "real" and the representational occurs, Phelan writes, because there is an insufficient understanding of the relationships between "visibility, power, identity and liberation," among other things, and this misconception leads the subject to mistake the "real" for the representational and vice versa.^[76](#Ch02.xhtml#fn2_76){#Ch02.xhtml#bck_fn2_76}^ Phelan believes that the confusion between "the real" (the subject) and the representational (the photograph) happens precisely because "\[t\]he real is read through representation and representation is read through the real ... Each representation relies on and reproduces a specific logic of the real; this logical real promotes its own representation."^[77](#Ch02.xhtml#fn2_77){#Ch02.xhtml#bck_fn2_77}^ With this in mind, I can explore how confusion between the "real" and the representational manifests itself in interactive new media installations as well as begin to examine some of the issues around, and possibilities for, the subversion of underlying narratives and other representational structures of meaning on behalf of the viewer/participant. A good place to start this exploration is Henry Kaufman's interactive new media installation [The Lightness of Your Touch]{.italic} (2004).

![fig2_3.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/3eZyXlM.jpeg)

I exhibited [The Lightness of Your Touch]{.italic} in 2007 as part of the group show "Capturing Time and Space" at Axiom Gallery in Boston, MA. The only part of [The Lightness of Your Touch]{.italic} visible to the viewer/participant was a large-scale custom-made curved projection screen. The screen doubled as the digital interface. Projected onto the screen was an image of an oversized human torso.^[78](#Ch02.xhtml#fn2_78){#Ch02.xhtml#bck_fn2_78}^ To interact with the work, I had to place my hand on the torso. When I did this, the "skin" of the torso shook. If I placed my hand on the screen for an extended period of time, an impression of a hand appeared on the torso. The brightness and clarity of the impressions directly correlated to the forcefulness and duration of my touch. After a certain period of time had passed, the handprints lifted off the screen, faded away, and the torso returned to its original, unmarked state.

For some visitors, the designation of the digital interface as human torso caused confusion between "the real" (the visitor's body) and the representation (the on-screen torso). This confusion occurred because the appearance of the digital interface (the representation), its movements, actions, and the consequences of these actions (the "skin" moves when touched, a forceful and prolonged touch leaves a colorful mark) resembled, to an extent, the visitor's body (the real).

For example, on the night of the opening at Axiom Gallery, I encountered a visitor who was repeatedly touching her arm, touching her friend's arm, and then touching the screen. She was doing this to show her friends how the piece worked. If she touched her arms or her friend's arms with a lot of force for a prolonged period of time, she said, a red mark would appear on their arm, just like it would on the screen. The comparison between her physical body (the "real") and the on-screen imagery (the representational) the visitor was making worked. Soon everybody was touching the screen and their []{#Ch02.xhtml#page_50 .pagebreak title="50"}arms, and exploring the similarities and differences between the two. The shaking of the skin and the marks, combined with the fact that the interface is designated as the locus of interaction, which mimics the visitor's position (the locus of interaction and sensation) in the physical world, only exacerbated the confusion between the two.

In her discussion of photography, Phelan argues that: "Representation follows two laws: it always conveys more than it intends; and it is never totalizing. The 'excess' meaning conveyed by the representation creates a supplement that makes multiple and resistant readings possible."^[79](#Ch02.xhtml#fn2_79){#Ch02.xhtml#bck_fn2_79}^ In other words, representations, whether a photograph or a moving image projected on a screen, may mimic the "real" thing they are representing, but these representations are flawed because they do not provide an exact replica of "the real." And it is through this failure to represent things perfectly that representations can allow for moments of subversion, on behalf of the subject, and possibly produce change.

So if, as Phelan states, "each representation relies on and reproduces a specific logic of the real" and "this logical real promotes its own representation," then it could be argued that the use of representations of the human body as digital interfaces, like the one deployed in [The Lightness of Your Touch]{.italic}, means that the subject in the installation is doubled (i.e. the subject is the viewer/participant and the computerized representation of it, the interface).^[80](#Ch02.xhtml#fn2_80){#Ch02.xhtml#bck_fn2_80}^ In this way, the interface in [The Lightness of Your Touch]{.italic} (the representation) is providing the viewer/participant with modes of identification---dictating how the viewer/participant's body should look (flawless, unless touched), what her body should be (male, white, and powerful), and how her body should behave (like a machine in all instances). Furthermore, Phelan argues, if reproductions have the ability to generate ruptures and gaps in dominant narratives, produce resistant readings, and create change, then it follows that the viewer/participant has the potential to subvert the underlying narratives and modes of identification provided to her via the digital interface (the representation), and alter them in a similarly profound way.

## [[The Re-use of Cultural Forms: Practice, Potentiality, and Instructional Processes]{.bold}](#content.xhtml#bck_sec2_4) {#Ch02.xhtml#sec2_4}

In a conversation about the use of re-appropriated cultural forms in contemporary artworks, Nicolas Bourriaud (2004) reiterates some of my points made above. He argues that cultural forms carry a set of visual and cultural expectations and experiences (the shape of a head, the placement of hands, the way legs move) that we are intimately familiar with.^[81](#Ch02.xhtml#fn2_81){#Ch02.xhtml#bck_fn2_81}^ The use of these forms, Bourriaud states, makes it easier for a subject to connect to or identify with an artwork. It also leads, he writes, to the "eradication of traditional distinctions between production and consumption, creation and copy, readymade and original work."^[82](#Ch02.xhtml#fn2_82){#Ch02.xhtml#bck_fn2_82}^ Eradication of traditional distinctions occurs because the re-appropriated form, for Bourriaud, is "no longer [primary]{.italic}."^[83](#Ch02.xhtml#fn2_83){#Ch02.xhtml#bck_fn2_83}^ In other words, the re-appropriated form is not original. Instead, it is an object that is "working with objects that are already in circulation ... which is to say objects already [informed]{.italic} by other objects."^[84](#Ch02.xhtml#fn2_84){#Ch02.xhtml#bck_fn2_84}^ The re-use of these forms should, as Bourriaud argues, complicate the conventional notions of artistic production and identification through the eradication of the traditional distinctions between original and copy.

Yet Lucy Suchman (2007a) contends that this need to eradicate distinctions between the human and the computer or the original and the copy, on behalf of some scholars, is part of a need to naturalize, "to disappear and put in one's place something []{#Ch02.xhtml#page_51 .pagebreak title="51"}transcendent, existing independently of one's actions."^[85](#Ch02.xhtml#fn2_85){#Ch02.xhtml#bck_fn2_85}^ This need to naturalize, Suchman states, is troublesome, as it is directly relates to the notions of separation and symmetry.^[86](#Ch02.xhtml#fn2_86){#Ch02.xhtml#bck_fn2_86}^ As she writes: "Having systematically established the division of humans and machines, technological imaginaries now evidence worry that once separated from us, machines are rendered lifeless and, by implication, less. They need to be revitalized, restored to humanness---in other words, to be made like us---in order that we can be reunited with them."^[87](#Ch02.xhtml#fn2_87){#Ch02.xhtml#bck_fn2_87}^ How does the naturalization process that Suchman discusses manifest itself in interactive new media installations? And what possibilities for subversion or resistance on behalf of subjects and artists exist, if they do at all?

An example can be found in Ken Feingold's installation [Interior. Interior]{.italic} consists of a projection screen, a digital interface, and a table. The digital interface is a plastic medical model of a truncated human torso whose organs, spine, and brain are exposed.^[88](#Ch02.xhtml#fn2_88){#Ch02.xhtml#bck_fn2_88}^ The torso rests on top of the table located in front of the projection screen. Although the organs are exposed both in the front (facing the screen) and the rear (facing the viewer/participant) of the torso, only those situated in the rear are fitted with touch sensors. When the viewer/participant touches the interface, animated graphic representations of human body parts and red-lipped doll heads appear on-screen. These images slowly emerge, drifting from side to side until they disappear against the changing background of the pictorial scenes projected on-screen.^[89](#Ch02.xhtml#fn2_89){#Ch02.xhtml#bck_fn2_89}^

Each body part appears according to what area of the torso is touched and operates differently based on physical functions (what its real-life equivalent does). For instance, if the viewer/participant touches the torso's liver, a representation of a liver appears on-screen. If the viewer/participant touches the torso's liver and brain at once, then two representations---one of a liver, one of a brain---appear on-screen. To transition between pictorial scenes, the viewer/participant must keep her hands on one organ for an extended period of time. If she places her hands on two or more parts of the torso for a prolonged period of time, dozens of organs and heads float forward and arrange themselves into monstrous human-like forms that sometimes babble incoherently.^[90](#Ch02.xhtml#fn2_90){#Ch02.xhtml#bck_fn2_90}^

Thus, the physical human body, as represented by the digital interface and the abstracted human-like on-screen images, are cut up, dispersed, and then repositioned by the viewer/participant in the process of artistic creation.^[91](#Ch02.xhtml#fn2_91){#Ch02.xhtml#bck_fn2_91}^ But what is this dispersal suggestive of? What kind of assumptions do the representations of the body in this installation embody? And what types of possibilities or alternative readings do they open or close?

[]{#Ch02.xhtml#page_53 .pagebreak title="53"}[Interior]{.italic} is an installation that is infused with images of bodies that are medical and technological in nature. The interface is a plastic medical model of a truncated human torso that is plugged directly into a machine. In being this way, the aesthetics of the interface gives the impression of neutrality and objectivity (of behalf of the artist) and a certain standardization or wholeness (of the human body and the human experience), yet the interface is carefully crafted and put into play by Feingold. For example, the digital interface visually traces concepts of the human body (technology) as symmetrical to the physical body (the human). However, the representations of the body that appear on-screen when the interface is touched by the viewer/participant are not naturalized. They do not look like, nor do they attempt to mimic, the behaviors of the viewer/participant's physical body in the way the interface does. In stark contrast to the interface, the on-screen representations of the body are abstracted, unsettling, uncanny, and always in excess.

For instance, the on-screen representations---the red-lipped doll heads, the disem-bodied livers and spleens---are not exact reproductions of the body. Nor are they presented as stable or unitary. They are mutated, fragmented, and dispersed across a variety of digital spaces and temporalities. By doing this, Feingold creates a tension between the embodied "realness" of the viewer/participant's physical body and the artificiality of the representations (the organs and body parts located on-screen and the digital interface).

This tension creates, in Deleuzian terms, "bodies without organs" (BwO) in the sense that the representations and the viewer/participant's consequent reconfigurations of them acknowledge the existence of many different versions of the self, yet these images cannot be reduced to either a technological or a biological thing.^[92](#Ch02.xhtml#fn2_92){#Ch02.xhtml#bck_fn2_92}^ No configuration of the body in [Interior]{.italic} can be claimed as the original, as "the real," or as the representational. For, as Rosalind Krauss (1999) states, the BwO "produces nothing; it reproduces. It is the domain of simulation, of series crossing one another, of the possible occupation of every place in the series by a subject forever decentered."^[93](#Ch02.xhtml#fn2_93){#Ch02.xhtml#bck_fn2_93}^

Since the BwO, as Krauss argues, lies in the domain of simulation, it becomes the place of textual and semiological inscription.^[94](#Ch02.xhtml#fn2_94){#Ch02.xhtml#bck_fn2_94}^ For Krauss, the BwO is an entity with no underlying organization or instruction. It is a series of processes, multiplicities or "crossings" that are constantly interrupting, intersecting, and reproducing each other, and that are always both original and in excess.^[95](#Ch02.xhtml#fn2_95){#Ch02.xhtml#bck_fn2_95}^ In this way, the "logic" of the BwO is not that of representation, in the sense that it is a reproduction of an autonomous original object. Instead, Krauss suggests that it is "the logic" of open-ended, variegated "flows of information."^[96](#Ch02.xhtml#fn2_96){#Ch02.xhtml#bck_fn2_96}^ Thus, she concludes, the content of the product (the representation) is the expressive medium of the producer (the artist, the viewer/participant).^[97](#Ch02.xhtml#fn2_97){#Ch02.xhtml#bck_fn2_97}^ As she writes: "\[The BwO's\] logic is not that of the signifier, that of representation. Rather it is the logic of 'flows of information' in which the content of the first flow (its product) is the expressive medium of the second (its producer)."^[98](#Ch02.xhtml#fn2_98){#Ch02.xhtml#bck_fn2_98}^

I posit that the same logic, or chaotic processes of consumption, reproduction, and reconstruction of the relationship between the body and technology, and the real and the representation via the digital interface and the on-screen images are at work in [Interior]{.italic}. This logic manifests itself through the appearance of the monstrous human-like forms in the installation. Embedded into [Interior]{.italic} is a narrative surrounding notions of the body as open to change and the representation as always being in []{#Ch02.xhtml#page_54 .pagebreak title="54"}excess---one that explores how technological representations of the body reflect and then reinforce fixed positions and consequently identities onto the viewer/participant. This narrative, I argue, also suggests that there is room for resistance to and subversion of the underlying narratives of the work by offering the viewer/participant a chance to destabilize, reconstruct, and reposition the on-screen representations via the digital interface.

## [In Conclusion]{.bold} {#Ch02.xhtml#sec2_5}

This chapter has explored how the embodied interface, when positioned as a non-binary, non-oppositional human machine hybrid challenges previously posited notions of the body, identity, and their relationship with technology. The deployment of the embodied interface in the works examined, I argued, shifts focus away from theorizing the subject in oppositional or binary terms, as an operational entity whose actions are defined as exterior to technology, towards considering her an integral part of the installation---an embodied viewer/participant whose interactions with the digital interface have consequences in interactive new media art installations.

However, recognizing the fact that the relationship between the body, technology, and identity is co-constitutive is not enough to adequately support and explain what is at stake, or why these relationships are important in interactive new media installations. It would be an oversight on my behalf to assume that these relationships are co-constitutive---that I know what entities consist of and how they may affect others. Instead, I must engage with and further develop a theory of this relationship that takes into consideration and articulates, in clear terms, why exactly it "matters" in interactive new media installations. I do this in the next chapter, suggesting that a theorization of the relationship between the human and technology as co-constitutive and collaboratively produced allows us to recognize agency: the agency of the human (the viewer/participant), the agency of the non-human (the interface), and the relationships that exist in between in interactive new media installations. Such an approach shifts focus from descriptive statements of identity, the body, and embodiment as static acts, thus drawing attention to the process of agency itself and the effects that this process produces in interactive new media installations.

# [[3 []{#Ch03.xhtml#page_58 .pagebreak title="58"}The Agential Interface]{.bold}](#content.xhtml#bck_Ch03) {#Ch03.xhtml#Ch03}

In the previous chapter, I explored the relationship between the body and technology through a theorization of the embodied interface: a non-binary, non-oppositional hybrid of machine and organism. I used this theorization as a beginning for my analysis of the relationship between the body and technology. Focusing on notions of subjectivity, identification and the embodied self, as theorized by Amelia Jones (2000, 2006, 2012) and Jean-Luc Nancy (2000), among others, I positioned the relationship between the body and technology as a co-constitutive and collaboratively produced experience.

It would, however, be a mistake on my part to offer a theorization of the relationship between the body and technology, and the aforementioned concepts of identity, subjectivity, and embodiment, without taking into account notions of agency. There are multiple agents and agencies, both non-human and human, at play in the construction and deployment of interfaces in interactive new media installations. These agents and agencies are not neutral. Rather, they aid in the articulation and construction of the way in which we conceptualize and classify entities. Taking this statement into account, I continue my examination of the relationship between the body and technology through a theorization of the agential interface.

The agential interface is understood here in Karen Barad's (2007) terms. Agency, for Barad is an enactment---a matter of intra-acting.^[1](#Ch03.xhtml#fn3_1){#Ch03.xhtml#bck_fn3_1}^ It is about the possibilities and accountability, on behalf of the viewer/participant, that a reconfiguration of the relationship between the body and technology entails.^[2](#Ch03.xhtml#fn3_2){#Ch03.xhtml#bck_fn3_2}^ This particular understanding is important to my theorization of the agential interface because the concept of agency, as Barad suggests, is not "something that someone or somebody has. Agency cannot be designated as an attribute of subjects or objects (as they do not pre-exist as such)."^[3](#Ch03.xhtml#fn3_3){#Ch03.xhtml#bck_fn3_3}^ Agency therefore does not encompass the human entity, the technological other, and/or the relationship between them, but exceeds these entities.^[4](#Ch03.xhtml#fn3_4){#Ch03.xhtml#bck_fn3_4}^ Agency, then, is not a condition that an entity must be conceptualized as [having]{.italic}, a quality that it is endowed with, or something that occurs out of the blue and makes it a more important or active thing. Rather, in the context of interactive new media installations, I argue that agency is a matter of how a viewer/participant consciously or unconsciously chooses to position herself in relation to other entities (like the digital interface), the possibilities that these choices may entail, and the effects that these choices may bring about.^[5](#Ch03.xhtml#fn3_5){#Ch03.xhtml#bck_fn3_5}^ In this way, the agential interface is not positioned as a set of issues related to power and control or constraints (although these issues are significant and will be discussed). Nor is it based on the choices the viewer/participant makes in interactive new media installations. Instead, the agential interface is theorized as an entity that emerges out of the []{#Ch03.xhtml#page_59 .pagebreak title="59"}relationship between the body and technology---one that has agency in its own right and thus influences the environment in which it is located. In positioning the agential interface as such, I argue that it has the potential to both open up spaces for criticism and allow for destabilizing effects to occur. These effects include, but are not limited to: the possible creation of ruptures in traditional artistic practices and narratives, the destabilization of binary notions such as the division between the material and the informational, a rethinking of the boundaries between the artist, viewer/participant and artwork, as well as a renegotiation of social and private space.

It is important to note that the effects that the agential interface helps bring about are not unilateral. The agential interface is not deterministic. It is not simply governed by power relations. Rather, the emergence of the agential interface in interactive new media installations could be understood as performative, in the sense that it is iteratively produced. The agential interface materializes out of a renegotiation of the relationship between the body and technology on behalf of the viewer/participant. Agency, however, is not inherent to the subject, as the subject is not determined by power relations alone. Thus, the formation of the agential interface may involve negotiation, conflict, struggles, and local acts of resistance on behalf of the viewer/participant.

In order to frame this argument, we should return to the discussion in the previous chapter around the embodied interface---specifically, its use in Henry Kaufman's [The Lightness of Your Touch.]{.italic} I argued that the interface, which is a projection of an enlarged torso, emerges out of the relationship between the body and technology. More specifically, it emerges out of the repetitive acts of identification and imitation of both historical and contemporary public and social norms performed by the viewer/participant in the gallery (touching a human body, touching an enlarged representation of a human torso projected onto a screen). In this installation, these acts of identification and imitation revolve around notions of the body, touch, and personal space. Identity and processes of identification are formed, by the viewer/participant, through strategic and corporeal acts (again on behalf of the viewer/participant) that are deeply social and continuously reiterated. Thus, the interface, like the body of the viewer/participant, becomes the site where subversive acts carry personal, public, and social effects (i.e. touching a human body so violently that it leaves a red mark).

However, we cannot automatically endow entities with agency, because the subject, be it human or non-human, does not have, per Barad's argument above, a "stable existence prior to the cultural field that it negotiates."^[6](#Ch03.xhtml#fn3_6){#Ch03.xhtml#bck_fn3_6}^ Rather, it is the instability of the interface which is caused, in part, by the reiterative nature of performativity that opens up the possibility of agency, and by default makes way for the conflict, struggles, and acts resistance that follow. How are these resistances possible? What do they mean? How do they manifest themselves in interactive new media installations? And how do we account for both the agency of non-human entities (the interface) and the effects that they may have on interactive new media installations? In order to explore these questions, I begin with a brief review of previous theoretical texts that have explored notions of agency and the effects it has on the relationship between the body and technology. I then address the question of the agential interface through the work of Daniel Rozin (2009), Rafael Lozano Hemmer (2010) and Carmin Karasic and Rolf van Gelder (Karasic and van Gelder, 2008). My analysis culminates in a reconfiguration of the digital interface as human body. This theorization pushes us to reflect on, and then critically question, how we experience, interact, and think with, and about, the []{#Ch03.xhtml#page_60 .pagebreak title="60"}agency of humans and technology. This will ultimately open up a space for different narratives around and reconfigurations of the digital interface in interactive new media installations.

Critical explorations of the effects that a theorization of the relationship between the body and technology as co-constitutive and collaboratively produced may bring about, as discussed earlier, are already underway.^[7](#Ch03.xhtml#fn3_7){#Ch03.xhtml#bck_fn3_7}^ However, these understandings, when specifically applied to the digital interface and interactive new media installations, remain, to an extent, at a superficial level. I argue that an in-depth analysis of the potential events that the relationship between the body and technology brings about and the effects that they might have on the way the viewer/participant interacts with and thinks about the digital interface in academic literature is, to an extent, lacking. The way the viewer/participant interacts with the interface should have an effect on interactive new media installations, and the majority of the theorizations around this relationship state as such. However, how these effects are analyzed brings about a rather limiting concept of the relationship between the body and technology, one that positions it as static and representational, rather than ongoing or open to reconfiguration. This limitation, I argue, is one of emphasis and focus. Specifically, it is a matter of what entity or relationship the scholar is placing emphasis on (the body or technology, the viewer/participant or the interface, the artwork, the artist, or the subject's experience) and what effect(s) of the aforementioned relationships or entities the scholar is interrogating (the socio-political, the technical, the biological).

A good example of how this limitation manifests itself can be found in Galloway's text on interfaces ([The Interface Effect]{.italic}, 2012) and Stern's book on interactive new media art installations ([Interactive Art and Embodiment: The Implicit Body as Performance]{.italic}, 2013).^[8](#Ch03.xhtml#fn3_8){#Ch03.xhtml#bck_fn3_8}^ Interfaces, Galloway argues, are not things, but processes that "effect a result of whatever kind."^[9](#Ch03.xhtml#fn3_9){#Ch03.xhtml#bck_fn3_9}^ To prove this, he offers a methodological account of how the socio-political and economic effects of the interface manifest themselves in various cultural contexts. While he provides an interesting methodology for studying the interface, his theorization of the relationship between the body and technology, and his explanation as to how these effects affect the relationship between the body and technology are arguably reductive. Therefore, his rethinking of the interface is not about what this device can become or the potential that it holds; rather, it is a narrow description of what Galloway believes interfaces should be.

Stern, on the other hand, devotes two chapters to the relationship between the body and technology in interactive new media installations.^[10](#Ch03.xhtml#fn3_10){#Ch03.xhtml#bck_fn3_10}^ Drawing on Barad's (2007) concepts of performativity and entanglement, and applying them to theories of the body and embodiment, the relationship between the body and technology in interactive new media installations is, for Stern, a "performed and emerging emergence."^[11](#Ch03.xhtml#fn3_11){#Ch03.xhtml#bck_fn3_11}^ It is a process that, he writes, "is constituted in and with and through its relations."^[12](#Ch03.xhtml#fn3_12){#Ch03.xhtml#bck_fn3_12}^ To support these arguments, Stern examines how bodies (of the performer, the viewer, and/or the artist) are staged and the potential that a restaging of these bodies (as relational to the artwork) may have for interactive new media art installations. While recognizing the importance that a more performative formulation of this relationship has for interactive new media installations, Stern does not address both the possibilities and the consequences that his approach may have on the digital interface. In other words, the body, in his analysis of the relationship between the body and technology, takes precedence over the techno-material and aesthetic elements of the installations []{#Ch03.xhtml#page_61 .pagebreak title="61"}he is interrogating. The non-human entities---particularly the interface---exist in the periphery. Thus, the effects that his more performative theorization may or may not have on the non-human entities that inhabit the installations he interrogates remain, to an extent, unexplored.

In short, I believe that what is needed is a sustained and detailed engagement with, and an emphasis on, the relationship between the body and technology, coupled with a critical reflection on the important, possibly destabilizing effects that this relationship may have when addressing issues concerning agency in interactive new media installations. This engagement is needed because if we fail to take into consideration all the aspects of the relationships or entities we are examining---if we do not recognize the significance that both human and non-human entities and their relationships have in the space in which they are located---then our theories will ultimately reinforce the same binaries and object/subject, mind/body separations they argue against.

## [[The Agency of Human and Non-human Entities, or Why the Relationship between the Body and Technology Matters]{.bold}](#content.xhtml#bck_sec3_1) {#Ch03.xhtml#sec3_1}

One text that begins to make some inroads in this regard is Seung-hoon Jeong's [Cinematic Interfaces]{.italic} (2013), which focuses on the use of the interface in film and expanded cinema projects. For Jeong, interfaces are cultural mediums whose agency emerges out of their own "flexibility" and "morphology."^[13](#Ch03.xhtml#fn3_13){#Ch03.xhtml#bck_fn3_13}^ Interfaces are not single, unified apparatuses that have separate existences from their users. Rather, he believes they are assemblages, consisting of "at least three major interfaces---camera, film, and screen---which place the same image into a process of differentiation, deferral and remediation."^[14](#Ch03.xhtml#fn3_14){#Ch03.xhtml#bck_fn3_14}^ An interface, he writes, "would be found less between two entities than between two interfaces. There would be no [a priori]{.italic} essence outside of interfaciality."^[15](#Ch03.xhtml#fn3_15){#Ch03.xhtml#bck_fn3_15}^

Interfaciality, as Jeong defines it, indicates "the state or function of interfacing on a surface between two entities."^[16](#Ch03.xhtml#fn3_16){#Ch03.xhtml#bck_fn3_16}^ The concept of interfaciality, for Jeong, is important as it allows us to begin to think about the interface as "a specific material surface for contact that accompanies overlapping and distancing, a contact surface of mediation through interval and interstice---however immediate it may look---in terms of space (between object, medium and subject) and time (between recording, editing and projection; between perception and memory)."^[17](#Ch03.xhtml#fn3_17){#Ch03.xhtml#bck_fn3_17}^ Given this, interfaciality, he argues, implies relationality.^[18](#Ch03.xhtml#fn3_18){#Ch03.xhtml#bck_fn3_18}^

Relationality, for Jeong, is not a synonym for intersection or interaction. Instead, it is a precondition of interfaces.^[19](#Ch03.xhtml#fn3_19){#Ch03.xhtml#bck_fn3_19}^ Therefore, relationality is "already imminently embodied in subjectivity and objectivity which are, simply put, nothing but interfaciality."^[20](#Ch03.xhtml#fn3_20){#Ch03.xhtml#bck_fn3_20}^ Interfaciality, then, is not purely representational, but rather, it is a [quality]{.italic} of relationships and things. It is, he posits, an issue of "the body-subject in physical contact with the medium interface."^[21](#Ch03.xhtml#fn3_21){#Ch03.xhtml#bck_fn3_21}^ This is because the interface, for Jeong, is an embodied agent. Therefore, it has effects (on the cinematic image, the viewer's experience, and the ideas and thoughts she forms around this experience) and is affected by other human and non-human entities.

Jeong's theory recognizes the agency of both the interface and the viewer/participant, and examines the effects this agency may or may not have on the installation/cinematic space. However, I argue that his formulation of the interface is constrained []{#Ch03.xhtml#page_62 .pagebreak title="62"}due to his alignment of notions of interfaciality and relationality with subjectivity and objectivity. This alignment raises a question around concepts such as agency, subjectivity, relationality, interfaciality, and interfaces. If interfaciality and relationality are qualities, inherent attributes, of entities and relationships, and if these entities and relationships are aligned with concepts like subjectivity and objectivity (in the sense that they affect and encompass them), then what of the entities' agency?

Agency should not be understood as a quality or attribute of an entity; rather, agency, as argued above, is an enactment.^[22](#Ch03.xhtml#fn3_22){#Ch03.xhtml#bck_fn3_22}^ Thus, agency is about change, or, more precisely, the possibility of change that this enactment may or may not have. Given this, entities cannot be presumed to be the site of agency, and agency cannot be presumed to be a quality of an entity since entities do not have a stable existence prior to their interactions with others.^[23](#Ch03.xhtml#fn3_23){#Ch03.xhtml#bck_fn3_23}^ Barad builds on her theorization of agency via a close reading of Monica Casper's (1994) article "Humans and Others: The Concept of Agency and Its Attribution."^[24](#Ch03.xhtml#fn3_24){#Ch03.xhtml#bck_fn3_24}^ To summarize, Casper argues that when attributing agency to entities, theorists in the STS fields (and I would argue, to an extent, in the humanities as well) have "failed to consider how the very notion of human agency is premised on 'a dichotomous ontological positioning in which \[non-human\] is opposed to human.'"^[25](#Ch03.xhtml#fn3_25){#Ch03.xhtml#bck_fn3_25}^ The resulting works that these theorists produce, Casper argues, are problematic because the approach utilized to analyze these entities "excludes a crucial factor from analysis since 'the attribution of human and nonhuman to heterogeneous entities' is always the consequence of particular political practices.'"^[26](#Ch03.xhtml#fn3_26){#Ch03.xhtml#bck_fn3_26}^ The crux of the argument that Barad is trying to make via Casper, and the ultimate importance of it to mine, is that how agency of non-human entities is constructed and consequently analyzed renders certain human entities that they come into contact with invisible, reducing them to empty operators.^[27](#Ch03.xhtml#fn3_27){#Ch03.xhtml#bck_fn3_27}^

Barad strongly agrees with Casper's argument; however, she takes issue with Casper's conclusions.^[28](#Ch03.xhtml#fn3_28){#Ch03.xhtml#bck_fn3_28}^ The critical issue, as Barad sees it, lies in "the framing of the referent of the attribution (and ultimately in the framing of agency as a localizable attribution)."^[29](#Ch03.xhtml#fn3_29){#Ch03.xhtml#bck_fn3_29}^ Here, Barad is suggesting that it is not the attribution of agency to non-human entities that is the problem, but rather the alignment of agency with subjectivity and the consequent attribution of subjectivity to non-human agents.^[30](#Ch03.xhtml#fn3_30){#Ch03.xhtml#bck_fn3_30}^ Barad's ultimate point is that the non-human entity should be "understood in relation to its referent," that is, in relation to the entities it emerges out of, rather than assuming that it is a pre-existing entity with inherent properties.^[31](#Ch03.xhtml#fn3_31){#Ch03.xhtml#bck_fn3_31}^

Following on from Barad's statements above, while Jeong is critical of concepts such as relationality and interfaciality, which enables him to trouble assumptions about the passive nature of viewing subjects by theorizing the interface as an embodied agent of change, I suggest that the paradoxical nature of his concept of interfaciality ends up creating a fixed relation between the subject and the screen. This is because Jeong is aligning notions of agency, via his theorization of relationality and interfaciality, with concepts of subjectivity. In doing this, he assumes that interfaciality and relationality are inherent attributes of an entity, rather than one of the many possible effects of his reconfiguration of the body/screen relation. Thus, echoing Barad's statement above, I argue that how the agency of the non-human entities (the interface) is constructed and consequently analyzed, by Jeong in his text, renders the viewer invisible, reducing her to an empty operator. Consequently, she lacks a presence in the installation space. This is not to say that the viewer/participant []{#Ch03.xhtml#page_63 .pagebreak title="63"}is actually invisible. The viewer/participant does physically exist; however, her contributions to the installation are, to an extent, not acknowledged in Jeong's theory of the interface. Given this, the question asked in the introduction "Why does the interface matter?" turns into the following one: what [does]{.italic} it actually mean to be present [and]{.italic} matter in interactive new media installations? This in itself, I suggest, is a question of agency insofar as it aligns itself with what Lucy Suchman (2007b) states is the "longstanding feminist concern" with the problem of who and what is recognized as an autonomous subject, and who and what is not, in discourse in the STS and humanities fields.^[32](#Ch03.xhtml#fn3_32){#Ch03.xhtml#bck_fn3_32}^ Following on from Suchman, my often-repeated phrases "what exactly is a digital interface?" and "why does the interface matter?" are not so much questions about action (of the viewer/participant) and responses to these actions by the digital interface; rather, they are questions of who or what is recognized as a digital interface, who and what is not, and how and why these interfaces emerge in interactive new media installations. These questions open up possibilities for different theories of the agential interface to emerge---theories that position it, as Suchman does, as an "encounter among the efforts and effects of specifically situated persons and things."^[33](#Ch03.xhtml#fn3_33){#Ch03.xhtml#bck_fn3_33}^ These efforts, effects, persons, and things operate in a specific cultural and historical framework that, Suchman argues, "takes autonomous agency not as an effect of cutting" the system of which they are a part, but rather as "the precondition for participation in it."^[34](#Ch03.xhtml#fn3_34){#Ch03.xhtml#bck_fn3_34}^ Thus, the issue, as Such-man rightly points out, is less the attribution of agency to technology and more the fact that "our language for talking about agency ... presupposes a field of discrete, self-standing entities."^[35](#Ch03.xhtml#fn3_35){#Ch03.xhtml#bck_fn3_35}^ As an alternative, she suggests we view interfaces as "entities achieved only through the on-going enactment of separateness and always in relation with others."^[36](#Ch03.xhtml#fn3_36){#Ch03.xhtml#bck_fn3_36}^

## [[The Agential Interface in 768 Pieces]{.bold}](#content.xhtml#bck_sec3_2) {#Ch03.xhtml#sec3_2}

Daniel Rozin's [Rust Mirror]{.italic} (2009) provides one such example of Suchman's suggestion above in the sense that it positions the digital interface as a hybrid entity---one that is separate from other entities (in that it is materially different), but whose agency emerges out of and in conjunction with the viewer/participants' interactions with it. [Rust Mirror]{.italic} consists of a computer, mechanical motors, a camera, and an audio system. It is rectangular in shape and its surface is covered in 768 rusted steel tiles.^[37](#Ch03.xhtml#fn3_37){#Ch03.xhtml#bck_fn3_37}^ When a viewer/participant walks in front of [Rust Mirror]{.italic}, the camera captures an image of her, which is sent to a computer, where it is processed. This newly processed data changes the state of the tiles. It sets them in motion, causing them to tilt toward the light source, or down, toward the gravel, located at the base of the installation, which also reflects light. The tilting of the tiles creates an image of the viewer/participants' body.^[38](#Ch03.xhtml#fn3_38){#Ch03.xhtml#bck_fn3_38}^

If a viewer/participant walks directly up to the work to get a closer look, [Rust Mirror]{.italic} is programmed to zoom in on her image and project an enlarged segment of this image onto its surface.^[39](#Ch03.xhtml#fn3_39){#Ch03.xhtml#bck_fn3_39}^ The viewer/participant can control this image by moving her physical body. For example, if she lifts a leg or bends down to touch the gravel, the image located on the surface of the mirror does the same. The more the viewer/participant interacts with the work, the more the tiles move or "rain" until, as Rozin states, "the storm of rain droplets \[the moving tiles\] completely overcomes the image of the viewer, this also produces a loud rumble of rain produced by the motors and the tiles."^[40](#Ch03.xhtml#fn3_40){#Ch03.xhtml#bck_fn3_40}^ When she steps away from the work, the movement of the tiles settles and its surface returns to its original blank state.

![fig3_1.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/57eqj8P.jpeg)

However, the projected image (the interface) is not a device that acts and reacts, or a transparent representation of meaning (of the artist) and intent (of the viewer/participant), and therefore they cannot be read in this way. Theorizing a digital interface like this is troubling as it replicates the notions raised in previous chapters that there is no real distinction between experiences and perceptions of the object, and thus it is the job of the theorist to objectively examine them.^[41](#Ch03.xhtml#fn3_41){#Ch03.xhtml#bck_fn3_41}^ It also imposes constraints on, as well as suppresses rather than promotes and encourages, creative theorizations of the digital interface in interactive new media installations. Instead, building on Suchman's alternative approach to the digital interface, I argue that there is no ontological separation between the objects (the projected image, the tiles that make up the surface of the mirror, the gears and chips located in the mirror) and the subjects (the viewer/participant, the other entities) located in the same space.^[42](#Ch03.xhtml#fn3_42){#Ch03.xhtml#bck_fn3_42}^

For instance, located inside [Rust Mirror]{.italic} are a series of computer chips and mechanized motors.^[43](#Ch03.xhtml#fn3_43){#Ch03.xhtml#bck_fn3_43}^ These motors flip the rusted steel tiles based on the pre-processed video stream that it has received from the camera, toward or away from the light source located directly above the piece.^[44](#Ch03.xhtml#fn3_44){#Ch03.xhtml#bck_fn3_44}^ The image of the viewer/participant that appears on the mirror's surface is based on the ability of the computer chips to break down an incoming, moving color video stream into black-and-white images, and then recreate and sustain the contrast between light and dark patterns. The digital interface in [Rust Mirror]{.italic} then appears, but not through separate interactions or the maintenance of these interactions by some other invisible entity located inside the machine. Instead, it manifests itself through the interactions that the entities that constitute the artwork make in conjunction with each other. It is through this interaction that I suggest that each one of the 768 squares of rusted steel squares in the installation assumes a new identity and becomes an agent in its own right. The squares each become a single pixel---or a tiny agential interface---working in conjunction with the other human and non-human agents (the rusted steel sheets, gears, microchips, light source, and the viewer/participant) to become a part of a larger digital interface: the viewer/participant's image.

![fig3_2.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/RJrNIro.jpeg)

The fact that the each of these elements must interact in conjunction with each other to create the image suggests that the agency of the digital interface in this work is not inherent. For, as stated above, the image of the viewer/participant located on the surface of the mirror is the result of the open-ended and shifting interaction between the situated elements and entities located both inside and outside the installation space (Rozin, the gears, the rusted steel tiles, the viewer/participant interacting with the work, and those observing it). Thus, the entities that form the mirror and their interactions with each other create change or produce an image of a viewer/participant on the mirror's surface. The image of the viewer/participant in [Rust Mirror]{.italic}, then, is called into being, becomes and is constantly becoming a digital interface in and through viewer/participant [intra-actions]{.italic} (mutual co-constitution). Therefore, the digital interface in [Rust Mirror]{.italic} is as an example of an agential interface in the sense that it produces itself. The digital interface is not only a reciprocal, active, and integral part of [Rust Mirror]{.italic}, but the projected image of the viewer/participant, as an agential interface, can be seen as a performative process---one that emerges out of its similarities and differences in conjunction with itself. If the distinction between the agential interface and the viewer/participant in [Rust Mirror]{.italic} is not inherent, and if it emerges as a performative process out of, and in conjunction with, itself, it could be argued that the agential interface consists of a relationship that already consists of the []{#Ch03.xhtml#page_66 .pagebreak title="66"}combined activities of the human and the machine. In other words, the agential interface in interactive new media installations is a form of relation---one that draws upon its own effects, and the effects of other entities that surround it, and performatively produces itself. An agential interface, then, has as much to say about the processes and relationships that bring it into being as it does about the effects that it creates. Given this, the relationships and individual parts that make up the agential interface can be stabilized or separated temporarily to fix a problem or conduct an investigation into how they work, but it cannot be reduced down to its constituent elements. Thus, I argue that the agential interface only comes into being---it can be viewed as an agent in its own right---when it reproduces itself.

## [[Enacting the Agential Cut]{.bold}](#content.xhtml#bck_sec3_3) {#Ch03.xhtml#sec3_3}

In what follows, I will develop my theorization of the agential interface through an analysis of Rafael Lozano Hemmer's interactive new media installation, [People on People]{.italic} (2010). I have adopted this analysis in part from Barad's (2007) theories of the agential cut, and N. Katherine Hayles' (1999a, 2003) theorization of the relationship between the body and embodiment. In my analysis, I shift focus, concentrating less on where the interface is located in the installation or on how changes to the artwork happen via viewer/participant interaction, and concentrate instead on theorizing the network of multiple materialities, agents, and agencies that compromise the installation.

Rosi Braidotti (1996) argues that approaching the issue of technology in "post-modernity requires a shift in perspective ... the technological factor must be seen as co-extensive with and intermingled with the human."^[45](#Ch03.xhtml#fn3_45){#Ch03.xhtml#bck_fn3_45}^ This shift in perspective for Braidotti is more than just a "move away from a technophobic towards a more technophilic approach."^[46](#Ch03.xhtml#fn3_46){#Ch03.xhtml#bck_fn3_46}^ Rather, it must be viewed as a move toward a more "nomadic" theorization of the relationship between the body and technology---one that allows for "shifts of location and multiplicity."^[47](#Ch03.xhtml#fn3_47){#Ch03.xhtml#bck_fn3_47}^ Unlike the binary shifts in spectatorship critiqued in earlier chapters, the problem is no longer one in which we attempt to explain how changes happen in relation to entities existing in extant positions as binary opposites;^[48](#Ch03.xhtml#fn3_48){#Ch03.xhtml#bck_fn3_48}^ rather, the issue, Braidotti argues, lies in exploring how these shifts help us make sense of the flexible and multiple practices and identities that they help reshape.^[49](#Ch03.xhtml#fn3_49){#Ch03.xhtml#bck_fn3_49}^ Following on from Bradotti, I suggest that my reading of Hemmer's installation affords me a chance to view the viewer/participant and the agential interface as productive and positive parts of the phenomena that they create. Thus, a different story is told from the one offered by the overly determined, technophobic, and technophilic approaches briefly mentioned by Braidotti above.

The focus of Hayles' investigations is on the "idea of relation."^[50](#Ch03.xhtml#fn3_50){#Ch03.xhtml#bck_fn3_50}^ This idea is a way of theorizing the relationship between entities as "the dynamic flux from which both the body and embodiment \[or any two entities for that matter\] emerge."^[51](#Ch03.xhtml#fn3_51){#Ch03.xhtml#bck_fn3_51}^ The "idea of relation" thus suggests that the relationship between the body and embodiment (like the relationship between the body and technology) is defined by its openness to reconfiguration and uncertainty. The body, for Hayles, is the physical human form that is seen by others "from the outside, from a cultural perspective striving to make representations that can stand in for bodies in general."^[52](#Ch03.xhtml#fn3_52){#Ch03.xhtml#bck_fn3_52}^ Regardless of how it is represented or analyzed, she argues, concepts about bodies are generated "from a group of samples, and in this sense always misses someone's particular []{#Ch03.xhtml#page_67 .pagebreak title="67"}body, which necessarily departs in greater or lesser measure from the culturally constructed norm."^[53](#Ch03.xhtml#fn3_53){#Ch03.xhtml#bck_fn3_53}^ The body, then, is an abstract concept, one that is always culturally constructed by both the person inhabiting the form and the subjects that are observing or interacting with it. Located at the other end of the spectrum, for Hayles, is embodiment.^[54](#Ch03.xhtml#fn3_54){#Ch03.xhtml#bck_fn3_54}^ Notions of embodiment, like those related to the body, are culturally constructed, but, as she states, "they are not entirely so, for they emerge from the complex interactions between the conscious mind and physiological structures."^[55](#Ch03.xhtml#fn3_55){#Ch03.xhtml#bck_fn3_55}^ Embodiment, then, is experienced internally. It entails the feelings, emotions, and sensations that "constitute the vibrant living textures of our lives."^[56](#Ch03.xhtml#fn3_56){#Ch03.xhtml#bck_fn3_56}^ For Hayles, the relationship between embodiment and the body can then be seen as "emergent phenomena" that we try to interpret by separating them into individual categories or concepts (the body, embodiment, the body, technology, viewer/participants, digital interfaces).^[57](#Ch03.xhtml#fn3_57){#Ch03.xhtml#bck_fn3_57}^

Veering between an understanding of the relationship between the body and embodiment as an emergent and fluctuating process, and presenting the relationship between the two in terms of discrete (internal and external) entities, Hayles stops short of embracing the full radicalism of her thesis. Consequently, she has been criticized for reducing the relationship between the body and embodiment to interaction between isolated things.^[58](#Ch03.xhtml#fn3_58){#Ch03.xhtml#bck_fn3_58}^ However, the analytical distinction that Hayles is making between the body and embodiment is not as binary as it appears. I do not believe that she is theorizing the relationship between the body and embodiment as a function of two separate (internalized and externalized) entities. Instead, I suggest that she is breaking two entities apart in order to explore how their relationship with each other can begin to create change in the space which they are located. Recognizing, but not fully articulating, the fact that theorists who analyze this relationship are usually focused on whether things are "binary or not," Hayles' text hints at the fact that relationships, like the one between the body and embodiment, are not definable unities, but always a melee of hybrid entities with multiple traits.

Given this, I suggest that the separation of the elements that contribute to the relationship that Hayles is investigating is not an attempt to widen the split between the body and embodiment or a superficial reading of a complex and constantly fluctuating relationship; it is a theoretical strategy---a reclamation of the body, agency, and subjectivity in contemporary discussions of posthumanism. In doing this, Hayles is positioning the relationship between the body and embodiment as emerging out of a distributed series of biological, technical, aesthetic, cultural, and socio-political processes. She does so through a decentering of classical notions of the human and an expansion of concepts of embodiment and the body to encompass non-human entities and processes. I argue that her study of the relationship between the body and embodiment and her attempt to return agency to this process of becoming makes a significant contribution to future theorizations of the relationship between the biological and the technical as an exchange, a network comprised of multiple materialities, processes, and entities that can been pulled apart, for a certain period of time, only to be put back together again.^[59](#Ch03.xhtml#fn3_59){#Ch03.xhtml#bck_fn3_59}^ Hemmer's [People on People]{.italic} (2010) offers an interesting case study in this regard. This is not only because of the notions explored or the problems introduced; rather, a critical reading of this installation provides answers to some of the more critical commentary and concerns about both the relationship between the body and technology, and the use of the agential interface in interactive new media installations.

[]{#Ch03.xhtml#page_68 .pagebreak title="68"}I first encountered [People on People]{.italic} in 2010. It was included in Hemmer's solo exhibition, "Recorders," at Manchester Art Gallery in Manchester, UK. [People on People]{.italic} consisted of two sets of projectors, high-resolution surveillance cameras, and a computer.^[60](#Ch03.xhtml#fn3_60){#Ch03.xhtml#bck_fn3_60}^ When I entered the space, the cameras captured photographic images of me, which were projected onto a long, horizontal wall in the form of a black shadow. The shadow was the digital interface in this work, as it was the means by which I interacted with and accessed information and images. However, the designation of the digital interface as shadow meant that the digital interface is a digital image---a virtualization of me and my movements and actions.

Virtualization, or virtuality, as Hayles states, is "[the cultural perception that material objects are interpenetrated by information patterns]{.italic}."^[61](#Ch03.xhtml#fn3_61){#Ch03.xhtml#bck_fn3_61}^ She continues, writing that virtualization is normally associated with computer simulations such as the shadow in [People on People]{.italic} that "put the body into a feedback-loop with a computer-generated image."^[62](#Ch03.xhtml#fn3_62){#Ch03.xhtml#bck_fn3_62}^ Drawing on Peggy Phelan's (1993) ontology of performance studies, the material (the "real") according to Hayles, implies physicality, and is characterized by presence and absence, as opposed to information (the virtualization), which consists of bits of digital data that are then sequenced into forms and identified by the interrelation of patterns and randomness.^[63](#Ch03.xhtml#fn3_63){#Ch03.xhtml#bck_fn3_63}^

![fig3_3.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/RlwIoVv.jpeg)

Similar to the way in which the Cartesian split used to dominate theories about the relationship between the body and the mind, Hayles believes that the dialectic of "pattern/randomness" (the basis of information) is beginning to overtake the dialect of "presence/absence" (the basis of the material) as a way to theorize the relationship between the body and technology.^[64](#Ch03.xhtml#fn3_64){#Ch03.xhtml#bck_fn3_64}^ Using the tension between the informational and the material as a starting point, she develops a framework for understanding the "semiotics of virtuality," in which the concepts of "presence/absence" and "pattern/randomness" are positioned as complementary and relational.^[65](#Ch03.xhtml#fn3_65){#Ch03.xhtml#bck_fn3_65}^ She accomplishes this []{#Ch03.xhtml#page_69 .pagebreak title="69"}by positioning these two forms of dialectics as the "two axes" of a semiotic square.^[66](#Ch03.xhtml#fn3_66){#Ch03.xhtml#bck_fn3_66}^ She then proceeds to connect them together, producing four synthesizing terms: materiality, mutation, information, and hyper-reality.^[67](#Ch03.xhtml#fn3_67){#Ch03.xhtml#bck_fn3_67}^ Together, she argues, these terms produce the dominant characteristics of the "posthuman condition" and create a framework for the semiotics of virtuality.^[68](#Ch03.xhtml#fn3_68){#Ch03.xhtml#bck_fn3_68}^

Kember and Zylinska build on this argument, applying it to the concept of mediation and stating that simulation "is founded on, and founders on, the collapsing of Cartesian divisions such as the one between the virtual and the real."^[69](#Ch03.xhtml#fn3_69){#Ch03.xhtml#bck_fn3_69}^ They continue, writing that mediation, like the relationship between the body and technology in interactive new media installations, "is positioned within a non-Cartesian framework (rather than an inverted or collapsed Cartesian framework in which the virtual does not absorb and negate the real)."^[70](#Ch03.xhtml#fn3_70){#Ch03.xhtml#bck_fn3_70}^ In short, the virtual does not act as a substitute for the absence of something real; rather, as they state, the real "produces it."^[71](#Ch03.xhtml#fn3_71){#Ch03.xhtml#bck_fn3_71}^

Following on from this, the digital interface (which is a digital image of my physical body) in [People on People]{.italic} is not simply an on-screen representation of abstract information. Just because the digital interface is a virtualization does not mean that it is an inert object---a supplemental body that is separate from me. A change in the physical state does not denote a separation between the material and the informational; rather, it suggests that the relationship between the material (me) and the informational (my shadow) is simultaneously a matter of being-in-the-world (the physical) and a matter of imitating and providing meaning to it (the virtual).

At this point, it is important to note that Hemmer does not aim to create a separation between the body and technology. In fact, he states just the opposite in his artist statement.^[72](#Ch03.xhtml#fn3_72){#Ch03.xhtml#bck_fn3_72}^ However, just because he writes that the installation is an exploration into the creation of "a platform for embodiment and interpenetration" does not mean that the subject and the digital interface are positioned, or able to (re)position themselves, as relational, mutually co-constitutive entities.^[73](#Ch03.xhtml#fn3_73){#Ch03.xhtml#bck_fn3_73}^ For instance, when I entered the space containing [People on People]{.italic}, a camera took a recording of me, which was sent to the projectors on the floor. The projectors on the ceiling also received this information and projected enlarged color photographic recordings of past participants who had previously interacted with the installation onto the wall.^[74](#Ch03.xhtml#fn3_74){#Ch03.xhtml#bck_fn3_74}^ When my shadow passed over certain spaces on the wall, the color recordings revealed themselves. If I stood still for a moment, these recordings sprung to life and began to "interact" with me. When I moved on, the color recordings froze and slowly faded into the background of the installation. Thus, I interpreted the relationship between the body and technology in [People on People]{.italic} as consisting of more or less self-contained objects or subjects who inhabit parallel, yet separate (physical and virtual) worlds.

In short, I positioned myself, in this installation, as an outside entity---a fixed operator, whose physical body needed to be incorporated into the interior of a machine, projected onto a surface, and revealed to me in order for anything to work. Therefore, the relationship between the body and technology in [People on People]{.italic}, while not necessarily conceived of, was presented to me, as an exchange occurring between detached, yet communicative entities. This is precisely because in order to work, [People on People]{.italic} relies on the fact that I will recognize the narratives presented to me by Hemmer via the interface. These narratives include, but are not limited to, the notion that subjects and objects equally contribute to the installation, but are separate entities that occupy different worlds. This is an act of recognition on my behalf that caused me to physically enact a temporary separation, through the act of (re) positioning, between myself and the interface. Given this, when I was interacting with [People on People]{.italic}, I was not a viewer/participant; I was an observer.

![fig3_4.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/ZutrM0M.jpeg)

So, while Hemmer is careful to avoid empty instrumentalism, by ascribing agency to the digital interface, the interface in [People on People]{.italic} could be criticized for what Florian Cramer (2011) calls a focus on "look-and-feel."^[75](#Ch03.xhtml#fn3_75){#Ch03.xhtml#bck_fn3_75}^ By concentrating on the surface-level aesthetic appearance of the digital interface and the high-level technological aspects of the device (the fact that he can simulate a moving image of a subject in real time, project it onto a screen, and make it aesthetically pleasing), Hemmer misses a fundamental aspect of interfaces in general: that they emerge out of and with the relationship between the body and technology and produce themselves. In doing this, Hemmer over-emphasizes the importance of the digital interface and its technological functions, reducing it to both a synonym for simulation (the images of previous subjects as exact replicas) and a synonym of a perceptive medium or interactivity (the shadow of the current subject). The digital interface in [People on People]{.italic} therefore becomes a metaphor---a vague explanation or demonstration of human perception and behavior.

Despite these limitations, the temporary analytical and physical distinctions that Hayles and the subject interacting in Hemmer's installation make between the two entities that they are exploring could be seen in terms of Barad's notion of the "agential cut."^[76](#Ch03.xhtml#fn3_76){#Ch03.xhtml#bck_fn3_76}^ The "agential cut" is a philosophical position, a material-conceptual device for knowing, seeing, and understanding the world.^[77](#Ch03.xhtml#fn3_77){#Ch03.xhtml#bck_fn3_77}^ Barad argues that the relationship between any two entities emerges and is "iteratively reconfigured through each intra-action, thereby making it impossible to differentiate in any absolute sense between creation and renewal, beginning and returning, continuity and discontinuity, here, there, past, present and future."^[78](#Ch03.xhtml#fn3_78){#Ch03.xhtml#bck_fn3_78}^

[]{#Ch03.xhtml#page_71 .pagebreak title="71"}The deeply connected way in which everything is entangled with everything else, according to Barad, suggests that any act of observation or intra-action requires the subject to temporarily enact "an agential cut" between themselves and the object they are studying within the larger material arrangement in which they are located.^[79](#Ch03.xhtml#fn3_79){#Ch03.xhtml#bck_fn3_79}^ Agential cuts then differ from other forms of thinking because the agential cut does not take this division for granted. As she writes:

```{=html}
<aside class="quotes" epub:type="pullquote">
```
\[T\]he agential cut enacts a resolution [within]{.italic} the phenomenon of the inherent ontological (and semantic) indeterminacy. In other words, relata do not preexist relations; rather, relata-within-phenomena emerge through specific intra-actions. Crucially, then, intra-actions enact [agential separability]{.italic}---the condition of [exteriority-within-phenomena]{.italic}.^[80](#Ch03.xhtml#fn3_80){#Ch03.xhtml#bck_fn3_80}^

```{=html}
</aside>
```
Put simply, Barad believes that nothing located in "the world" is inherently separate from anything else.^[81](#Ch03.xhtml#fn3_81){#Ch03.xhtml#bck_fn3_81}^ However, separations are temporarily enacted, so a subject can examine an image, or explore a relationship long enough to gain knowledge about it. In the case of [People on People]{.italic}, this separation occurs through my interaction, thus determining my subject positioning in the installation (as viewer or observer instead of viewer/participant). Therefore, the agential cut enacts a [temporary]{.italic} separation between what is included in, and what is excluded from, the relationship or entity that the subject is observing and/or interacting with. The role of the agential cut is to untangle entities into separate objects and subjects, only to weave them back together later, as this act of unraveling is, and can only be, temporary. For, as stated above, while entities may be temporarily separated or stabilized, they [cannot]{.italic} be disassociated from each other.

If, as Barad argues, nothing located in "the world" is inherently separate from anything else and if, as Hayles argues, focusing on "the idea of relation," "changes everything," then I can begin to argue that the fact that I was able to physically enact a temporary separation (or an agential cut) between myself and the digital interface in [People on People]{.italic} through the act of repositioning could be seen as an exploration, on my behalf, of how entities precede their existence with each other, and of how they emerge out of and with my relationship with the digital interface in interactive new media installations.^[82](#Ch03.xhtml#fn3_82){#Ch03.xhtml#bck_fn3_82}^ It could also be seen as a mode of exploring, again on my behalf, what a body could or could not become (observer, viewer, participant, viewer/participant) in the installation space.

A focus on the "idea of relation" between two entities in interactive new media installations allowed me the opportunity to (re)conceive my relationship and position to both the digital interface and myself (as a viewer and/or viewer/participant) as in-process, and thus unstable and open to reconfiguration. This openness to reconfiguration not only confused the distinction between absence and presence, as well as the material and the informational, but also afforded me the opportunity to begin to experiment with the digital interface. It allowed me to question and challenge the way in which the self/other, body/technology distinctions were presented to me in [People on People]{.italic}, and to explore what the digital interface may become once I repositioned myself and my relationship to technology in interactive new media installations. In this way, I suggest that a reconsideration of the relationship between the body and technology (from separate objects and subjects to mutually entangled entities) highlights different modes of communication and subject positionings. Thus, it has the []{#Ch03.xhtml#page_72 .pagebreak title="72"}potential to open up a collective space for the exploration, criticism, reflection, and reconsideration of the relationship between the body and technology in interactive new media installations.

## [[Collective Spaces of Questioning, Reflection, and Reconsideration]{.bold}](#content.xhtml#bck_sec3_4) {#Ch03.xhtml#sec3_4}

Amelia Jones (2000) writes that the body "is the means by which we produce ourselves as social beings, by which we produce 'social space.'"^[83](#Ch03.xhtml#fn3_83){#Ch03.xhtml#bck_fn3_83}^ Referencing Michel Feher's (1987) formulation of power relations and the body, Jones argues that the body (when viewed from an art-historical perspective) is not only the means by which we produce social space, but is also the actualizer of power. The body, she claims, "functions as a kind of 'resistance to a power'... through its performance as socially determined and determining."^[84](#Ch03.xhtml#fn3_84){#Ch03.xhtml#bck_fn3_84}^ Therefore, the body, for Jones, has always been the site through which both public and private powers are articulated, and if, as she argues, we take this to be the case, then the body can be conceived of as the site of power and as the site of protest or resistance against those powers.^[85](#Ch03.xhtml#fn3_85){#Ch03.xhtml#bck_fn3_85}^

Although related to 1960s--1990s feminist body art performances, the crux of Jones's argument (the body is the site of power, protest, and resistance), as well as her notion that radically disruptive and dislocative practices result in the intertwining of the "embodied selfhood" with social and technological spaces, therefore creating a new type of subject position---"the body/self"---can be applied to the agential interface in interactive new media installations.^[86](#Ch03.xhtml#fn3_86){#Ch03.xhtml#bck_fn3_86}^ "The body/self," for Jones, is a subject position that emerges out of the relationship between the body and social space.^[87](#Ch03.xhtml#fn3_87){#Ch03.xhtml#bck_fn3_87}^ Thus, she writes, "the body/self can be understood as the social" because it is formed through strategic corporeal acts of protest and/or resistance on behalf of both the viewer and the artist.^[88](#Ch03.xhtml#fn3_88){#Ch03.xhtml#bck_fn3_88}^ The renegotiation of this relationship on behalf of the subject means that the relationship between the social and the self is no longer solely conceived of by the artist or theorized in oppositional terms (public space vs. domestic or private space, the body vs. technology). Instead, it suggests potential for rethinking the relationship between the body and technology as being "in process" and open to reconfiguration in a way that both promotes and encourages behaviors that may deviate from the norm, and behaviors that may have the ability to cause dislocative effects in aesthetic contexts.^[89](#Ch03.xhtml#fn3_89){#Ch03.xhtml#bck_fn3_89}^

An example of this potential can be found in Carmin Karasic and Rolf van Gelder's interactive new media installation [Human\^n]{.italic} (2008) (see [Plates 7 and 8](#Ch04.xhtml#pla7and8){#Ch03.xhtml#bck_pla7and8}). [Human\^n]{.italic} consists of two components: technology (computer-generated animations, a circular screen, a camera, a computer, motion detectors) and the human (the viewer/participant).^[90](#Ch03.xhtml#fn3_90){#Ch03.xhtml#bck_fn3_90}^ The animations displayed on the screen are generated randomly from the Internet in real time. They consist of both abstract and literal depictions of states, processes or events that, Karasic writes, "subtly hint at the effects that our \[human\] actions have on the world we occupy."^[91](#Ch03.xhtml#fn3_91){#Ch03.xhtml#bck_fn3_91}^ The images located in the screen could consist of anything from a picture of the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina (a direct reference to global warming issues and civil engineering failures in the USA) to Disney World (an indirect reference to debates about fantasy and the real). When generated, multiple images are combined, distorted, and then projected onto the screen in a kaleidoscope formation.^[92](#Ch03.xhtml#fn3_92){#Ch03.xhtml#bck_fn3_92}^

This was the state of the artwork when I first encountered it in 2008 in Kunst licht kunst in Eindhoven, the Netherlands. The images located inside the kaleidoscope []{#Ch03.xhtml#page_73 .pagebreak title="73"}remained static until the proximity sensors detected my movement. Once my activity was detected, the kaleidoscope began to spin based on my actions. For instance, when I moved to my left, the kaleidoscope spun left. If I walked directly up to the piece to get a closer look, [Human\^n]{.italic} would zoom in on one, or all, of the images and then project enlarged segments of them on-screen.^[93](#Ch03.xhtml#fn3_93){#Ch03.xhtml#bck_fn3_93}^

When I entered performance range, the camera took a color photograph of me. This photograph was transmitted to a computer, where it was processed, distorted, and then integrated into the images in the kaleidoscope in real time. While my image was distorted, I was able to recognize fragments of myself (my clothing) mixed with the other images appearing in the kaleidoscope. Since the actions that I performed (turning left, moving backward) caused a change in the state of the kaleidoscope, it could be argued that my body was the means by which I produced the "social space" of the image.

[Human\^n]{.italic} does not contain a visible digital interface. There was no pixelated image or projected shadow for me to interact with; instead, I was required to use my body to interact with the installation. So, if as Jones states, the body is not only the "actualizer of power" but also the "site of resistance" to these powers, then it could be argued that my physical body was not only aiding in the production of the images, narratives, and social space in [Human\^n]{.italic}, but was also functioning as the site of resistance to the underlying narratives, images, and relationships it helps create.^[94](#Ch03.xhtml#fn3_94){#Ch03.xhtml#bck_fn3_94}^ In this way, it could be suggested that my body was the digital interface (the means of interaction and navigation) in this installation. This is precisely because in its tripartite role as "creator of social-space," "actualizer of power," and "site of resistance," my body is able to become explicitly "non-universal" and "non-transcendent." In this ability to become this way lies the potential for radically dislocative practices which include, but are not limited to, a rethinking of the digital interface, as human body, in interactive new media installations.^[95](#Ch03.xhtml#fn3_95){#Ch03.xhtml#bck_fn3_95}^

It is important to note here that when I posit that the digital interface had become my body, I am not referencing art historians John Chandler and Lucy Lippard's (1971 \[1968\]) notion of dematerialization.^[96](#Ch03.xhtml#fn3_96){#Ch03.xhtml#bck_fn3_96}^ I am also not attempting to argue that I could merge with technology to become part of the installation. Nor am I equating the visual absence of the digital interface with physical disappearance. To argue any of these things is to misinterpret the relationship between the technical and the biological, and to ignore the fact that digital interface has not actually been physically removed. The relationship between the body and technology in [Human\^n]{.italic} is not about assimilation or removal, but about coexistence between the multiple agencies that exist there. By suggesting that the digital interface has become my body in [Human\^n]{.italic}, I am signaling the fact that the digital interface (as in the abstract, multilayered structures of code that allow two entities to communicate with each other and its consequent metaphorical significance as a mediator and translator) is no longer represented, or made tangible by, a physical object or a shadow projected onto a screen. The digital interface, the mode of interaction, communication, its metaphorical, aesthetic, and cultural significance in [Human\^n]{.italic}, is now my body. Thus, it is produced by and is constantly producing subjects, objects, and meanings. In this way, the designation of human body as interface can be seen as emerging out of both the reconception of the relationship between the body and technology, and the ongoing process by which the artwork, cultural meanings, and interactions are collectively created and questioned. In the case of [Human\^n]{.italic} the dislocative acts of cutting (of images), the integration (of my []{#Ch03.xhtml#page_74 .pagebreak title="74"}photographic image with the other images in the kaleidoscope), and artistic experimentation with different configurations of the digital interface allowed me to explore and question my relationship to technology. These acts enabled me to examine my relationship to the content of the images (of events, processes, or states of human actions) and begin to rethink the actions and decisions that I made both in the gallery space and in the world.

## [In Conclusion]{.bold} {#Ch03.xhtml#sec3_5}

Whether understood as an "entangled intra-relating" by Barad, a relational construction "that participates in distributed cognition dispersed throughout the body and the environment" by Hayles or as "non-universal, "non-transcendental," and "in process" by Jones, the relationship between the body and technology in interactive new media installations can be seen as both a mutually entangled and collaboratively produced experience.^[97](#Ch03.xhtml#fn3_97){#Ch03.xhtml#bck_fn3_97}^ Interactive new media installations not only open up a space for the viewer/participant to begin to reposition and reconstruct herself in relation to technology, but also open up a space for criticism (of the underlying structures and theories that dictate and define subject movements and positions) and an area that allows us an opportunity to begin to reflect on, re-evaluate, rediscover, and possibly even redefine our relationship to the digital interface in interactive new media installations. These conclusions lead the way toward the next topic discussed in this book: the cybernetic interface. The following chapter will introduce the cybernetic interface through an exploration of notions of instruction and will then explore the implications of the destabilizing effects that resistance to, or the subversion of, instruction have on the way the viewer/participant both intra-acts with and thinks about the digital interface in interactive new media installations.

# [[4 []{#Ch04.xhtml#page_78 .pagebreak title="78"}Instruction and the Interface]{.bold}](#content.xhtml#bck_Ch04) {#Ch04.xhtml#Ch04}

The digital interface in interactive new media art installations is commonly defined as both the hardware and software embedded in a physical object that enables humans to use technology. Its primary functions are to mediate communication and facilitate interaction between entities. While the interface certainly enables connections to be forged, these connections are pre-programmed by the artist(s) creating the interface, and they occur in spaces of predesigned experiences (interactive new media installations). In this way, some of the functions that the interface performs can be seen as problematic due to the fact that they create active vs. passive dichotomies, resulting in, what Kate Mondloch (2010) refers to as environments of controlled passive response.^[1](#Ch04.xhtml#fn4_1){#Ch04.xhtml#bck_fn4_1}^ However, she states that it is not so much these dichotomies that require scholarly attention, though she believes they should be examined.^[2](#Ch04.xhtml#fn4_2){#Ch04.xhtml#bck_fn4_2}^ Rather, she suggests it is the processes that bring these dichotomies into being---specifically "the disciplinary aspects of screen-based visuality" that should be of concern to any theorist examining them.^[3](#Ch04.xhtml#fn4_3){#Ch04.xhtml#bck_fn4_3}^

For Mondloch, the phrase "disciplinary aspects of screen-based visuality" refers to how the "technological structures and control mechanisms of late capitalism" influence the relationship between humans and technology.^[4](#Ch04.xhtml#fn4_4){#Ch04.xhtml#bck_fn4_4}^ Thus, she writes that while critical accounts written about media-reliant installations have developed "more nuanced theories of attentive regulation and control as potential sites of cultural contestation," the majority of these texts fail to appreciate the role that screen-based apparatuses like interfaces play in administrating and controlling interactions between human subjects and media objects.^[5](#Ch04.xhtml#fn4_5){#Ch04.xhtml#bck_fn4_5}^ Following on from Mondloch, in any investigation into the use of the digital interface in interactive new media installations, it is of vital importance to develop a critical understanding of the means and mechanisms through which viewer/participant interactions are shaped via the interface to attain certain results. I do just that in this chapter, focusing on the concept of instruction. I examine instructional processes---that is, how instruction is transmitted to the viewer/participant via the digital interface, as well as how and why it is employed in interactive new media installations. My exploration is structured around three questions: why is the use of instruction important in interactive new media installations? How and why is instruction employed in them? And for what means and to what ends are the results of this instruction used?

Instruction is viewed in this chapter not as an order or command, but as a method of arranging and then transmitting explanatory or directional information to the viewer/participant. How we learn to interact in interactive new media installations can be accomplished in multiple ways: instruction can occur through reading and []{#Ch04.xhtml#page_79 .pagebreak title="79"}following written instruction manuals, watching other viewer/participants interact with artwork, or through direct experimentation with the installations themselves. Rather than addressing written and oral instructions (user manuals or verbal directions) provided by the artist or venue to the viewer/participant, I am concerned with instruction as it is conveyed through the use of rhetorical devices---specifically models and metaphors deployed as interfaces---in interactive new media installations.

My understanding of instruction is informed by a close reading of Lucy Such-man's (2007a) critique of instruction as a rhetorical device that reinforces problematic modes of communication between humans and machines, as well as Norbert Wiener's (1950, 1961) cybernetic notion of instruction as a method of controlling biological and technical systems. I draw on these specific texts in order to provide a historical and theoretical base from which to understand instruction in interactive new media installations. This historical and theoretical base allows me to explore the implications that the use of instruction, as provided to the viewer/participant by the artist and deployed through the digital interface, has for interactive new media installations.

My ultimate aim in theorizing instruction as such is to take a step back from proliferating utilitarian accounts of instruction and interfaces that concentrate, for the most part, on the undesirable effects of instruction when transmitted via technology to the subject (Galloway, 2012; Emerson, 2014).^[6](#Ch04.xhtml#fn4_6){#Ch04.xhtml#bck_fn4_6}^ In doing this, I aim to provide a different, hopefully more productive account of how instruction manifests itself and can be used in interactive new media installations. The effects that the aforementioned theorists concentrate on in their work are, for the most part, ideological in nature. They are the effects of a normative vision---socio-political or moral beliefs or ideas around how to behave---that are transmitted to the viewer/participant via the digital interface and that structure her experience in interactive installations. So, while these effects are not the focus of this chapter, they are important to any conversation around instruction and must be discussed.

::: {.section}
## [[The Ideological Effects of Instruction]{.bold}](#content.xhtml#bck_sec4_1) {#Ch04.xhtml#sec4_1}

Some instruction, when transmitted through technology, is, according to Alexander Galloway (2012), always binary and always political.^[7](#Ch04.xhtml#fn4_7){#Ch04.xhtml#bck_fn4_7}^ Instruction, for Galloway, is binary in a computational sense; its dissemination hinges on the abilities of various technological, systems to transmit a very small amount of information from one entity to another and to "operate smoothly without obstruction."^[8](#Ch04.xhtml#fn4_8){#Ch04.xhtml#bck_fn4_8}^ It is political, he writes, because the information being transmitted is produced by specific people for specific purposes.^[9](#Ch04.xhtml#fn4_9){#Ch04.xhtml#bck_fn4_9}^ Thus, this type of instruction, he tells us, is similar to propaganda, in that it is meant to be consumed by the public without critical thought.^[10](#Ch04.xhtml#fn4_10){#Ch04.xhtml#bck_fn4_10}^ He takes issue with instruction as propaganda as he believes it is used to influence the actions of the subject through the prohibition of specific types of narratives, modes of production, and moral frames.^[11](#Ch04.xhtml#fn4_11){#Ch04.xhtml#bck_fn4_11}^ Instruction, especially instruction transmitted through technology, for Galloway, is then problematic because it prohibits the existence of "alternate moral frames" and different ways of thinking and acting.^[12](#Ch04.xhtml#fn4_12){#Ch04.xhtml#bck_fn4_12}^ Thus, instruction, he writes, can be seen as "disingenuous informatics" because it is used, by those who create it, to transmit ideological propaganda to the public.^[13](#Ch04.xhtml#fn4_13){#Ch04.xhtml#bck_fn4_13}^

Suchman (2007a) notes that digital technologies "include relations between the sites and interests within which coordinative artifacts are generated and those of their []{#Ch04.xhtml#page_80 .pagebreak title="80"}use."^[14](#Ch04.xhtml#fn4_14){#Ch04.xhtml#bck_fn4_14}^ Such technologies, she continues, "presuppose an open horizon of socio-material practices that inevitably exceed their representational grasp. At the same time, those practices reflexively constitute themselves as implementation of actions prescribed."^[15](#Ch04.xhtml#fn4_15){#Ch04.xhtml#bck_fn4_15}^ However, she writes, "\[the\] frequent presence of multiple, often contradictory, agendas ... on the one hand, and the work required to enact an orderliness ... on the other lead to various forms of both breakdown and creative resistance."^[16](#Ch04.xhtml#fn4_16){#Ch04.xhtml#bck_fn4_16}^ Here, she is arguing that technologies are produced by very specific groups of people to perform very specific computerized tasks for very specific reasons. They are then re-appropriated by the public and used in ways beyond the creators' original intention. Suchman continues, stating that the people who consume technologies and the institutions and people who create them hold very specific, often conflicting interests.^[17](#Ch04.xhtml#fn4_17){#Ch04.xhtml#bck_fn4_17}^ The presence of multiple, often contradictory interests, combined with the fact that these technologies are ultimately pre-programmed to perform specific task(s), can lead to both breakdown situations (the technology will not work) and/or resistance to the instruction given by the subject interacting with it (using it for other, unrelated purposes). Therefore, Suchman's analysis differs from Galloway's as she believes instruction can be ideological, so it may restrict, but it does not prohibit or determine the emergence of alternative narratives, modes of production, and moral frames.

Suchman's critique of instruction assumes a particular importance in the context of this chapter, as her interpretation not only focuses on the ideological effects instruction may have, but she also provides her reader with examples of the subject's subversion and resistance to it. Like Suchman, I focus on the destabilizing effects that resistance to or subversion of instruction on behalf of the viewer/participant has in interactive new media installations. This focus enables me to study a whole range of variations in behaviors and interactions that occur when the viewer/participant resists or subverts instruction, and how it affects the way in which the viewer/participant views and interacts with the digital interface in interactive new media installations. The pertinent questions to be asked at this point are: what are the potential consequences of subversion or resistance of instruction on behalf of the viewer/participant for the interface in interactive new media installations? How does this instruction change when the viewer/participant resists or subverts it? My reasoning behind asking these questions is to develop a critical understanding of the power that instruction has in controlling the actions of its subjects and how the nature of this instruction may change when deployed in interactive new media installations. Subjects, I argue, have the ability to resist or subvert instruction and generate moments of rupture in the spaces in which they are located. Thus, the contribution that my analysis of instruction adds to discussions on this topic is that it directly addresses the potential that the subject's resistance to and subversion of instruction has in allowing for different modes of thinking, doing, and interacting in the specific context of interactive new media installations and in the world at large.

It is important to note here that I provide what could arguably be seen as a semi-historical account of instruction, focusing specifically on the first through third wave cybernetics. Engaging with the concept of instruction from this perspective is signifi-cant because discourses around the regulatory nature of instruction have recently re-emerged among scholars.^[18](#Ch04.xhtml#fn4_18){#Ch04.xhtml#bck_fn4_18}^ I say "re-emerged" because these arguments echo, to an extent, Norbert Wiener's cybernetic notions of instruction. I discuss these notions of instruction in detail below, but in brief, instruction, for Wiener, is a method of controlling biological and technical systems---one that takes information learned from past []{#Ch04.xhtml#page_81 .pagebreak title="81"}experiences and re-inserts it into the system to influence similar situations encountered in the future.^[19](#Ch04.xhtml#fn4_19){#Ch04.xhtml#bck_fn4_19}^ The focus of his research is on the control of system behaviors via instruction. Specifically, he looks at how fast a system adapts to and modifies previous behaviors based on the current information it is receiving.^[20](#Ch04.xhtml#fn4_20){#Ch04.xhtml#bck_fn4_20}^ Any moments of rupture that may occur if and/or when the subject resists instruction in his theory are dismissed, as they exist outside the cybernetic feedback loop of control.^[21](#Ch04.xhtml#fn4_21){#Ch04.xhtml#bck_fn4_21}^ By dismissing these moments, I argue that instruction, as theorized by Wiener, forecloses on any possibilities for subversion or resistance to information being transmitted to the subject interacting with the system, as his theory relies on the false premise that the systems being analyzed are a part of a closed signaling loop.

With some exceptions, research into the use of the digital interface in the humanities fields has adopted and built on the prevailing and dominant cybernetic views on instruction briefly described above.^[22](#Ch04.xhtml#fn4_22){#Ch04.xhtml#bck_fn4_22}^ Given this, the question should be asked of how a conceptualization of instruction would operate in interactive new media installations if we were to concentrate on other aspects of the instructional process---specifically, aspects that allow for moments of experimental resistance and subversion on behalf of the viewer/participant. By shifting focus in this manner, I do not mean to say that we should be unconcerned with more recent developments around instruction, or that artists should not critically interrogate or deploy instruction as a method of controlling viewer/participant interactions in their works. Rather, I suggest that something is needed to complement the notion of instruction as a cybernetic method of power and control over viewer/participants, as well as to provide a different analytic framework for investigating how instruction is executed and inscribed in interactive new media installations. This chapter is my attempt at providing such a framework.

## [[Instruction, Learning Processes, and the Cybernetic Feedback Loop of Interaction]{.bold}](#content.xhtml#bck_sec4_2) {#Ch04.xhtml#sec4_2}

Instruction, for Wiener (1950), is "a method of controlling a system by reinserting into it the results of its past performance."^[23](#Ch04.xhtml#fn4_23){#Ch04.xhtml#bck_fn4_23}^ He continues, positing that if this reinserted information is able to modify the patterns of the performance of the system, or the user's past actions, we are presented with "a process which may well be called learning."^[24](#Ch04.xhtml#fn4_24){#Ch04.xhtml#bck_fn4_24}^ Instruction, then, is a system that influences the learning process, and the learning process is a method that relies on information gained from past experiences feeding back on similar situations encountered in the future.

An example of how instruction and the learning process works, Wiener tells us, can be found in the way a lab rat is taught to navigate a maze.^[25](#Ch04.xhtml#fn4_25){#Ch04.xhtml#bck_fn4_25}^ The scientist places a rat in a maze and in order to find food, or to avoid an electric shock, the rat must be able to remember if its actions have been successful. Did it get food? Or did it get shocked? The rat must be able to use this learned information to change its plan to avoid past mistakes (remembering which paths lead to shocks) and successfully navigate the maze (remembering which paths lead to food).^[26](#Ch04.xhtml#fn4_26){#Ch04.xhtml#bck_fn4_26}^ Wiener writes that the learning process described above is different from other instructional processes, like those that deal with simple performance-based successes or failures.^[27](#Ch04.xhtml#fn4_27){#Ch04.xhtml#bck_fn4_27}^ He calls this instance "feedback on a higher level," as the way the rat is able to navigate the maze is a reflection of disciplinary instructions used to restrict or reinforce behaviors, not of simple learned actions.^[28](#Ch04.xhtml#fn4_28){#Ch04.xhtml#bck_fn4_28}^

[]{#Ch04.xhtml#page_82 .pagebreak title="82"}I want to concentrate, for a moment, on some of the problems in Wiener's statement on the flow and regulation of information in cybernetic systems---specifically, those found in his description of instructional and learning processes as a feedback loop. I argue that Wiener's theorization of instruction is limited because he is treating the biological and technical aspects of these processes as pre-determined and constrained. In doing this, he ends up denying both the biological and technical subjects' agency. That said, he does concede, later in the same text, that if we treat the outcomes of the instructional and learning processes as purely quantifiable---as a detailed string of numbers that merely control action---without being critically questioned or contextualized, the information received about the system being studied is flawed.^[29](#Ch04.xhtml#fn4_29){#Ch04.xhtml#bck_fn4_29}^ This is because these outcomes do not account for more subjective things like human bias. As he writes: "If the results \[of instructional processes\] are merely used as numerical data for the criticism of the system and its regulation, we have the simple feedback of the control engineers."^[30](#Ch04.xhtml#fn4_30){#Ch04.xhtml#bck_fn4_30}^

Moreover, how information flowing through these feedback loops behaves is not the same, for Wiener. He does not believe that all biological processes act alike or respond to information in the same way, if they respond at all.^[31](#Ch04.xhtml#fn4_31){#Ch04.xhtml#bck_fn4_31}^ Rather, he argues that the transmission of information relies on "a complicated pattern of responses in which certain combinations of incoming \[information\] ... will cause the message to go further, while certain other combinations will not. These combinations are not a thing fixed once for all, nor do they even depend solely on the past history of messages received. They are known to change."^[32](#Ch04.xhtml#fn4_32){#Ch04.xhtml#bck_fn4_32}^ These notions of change lead Wiener to explore the limitations of instructional and learning processes. However, some of the conclusions he comes to in his study are flawed.

For example, the instructional process, for Wiener, is predicated on the assumption that there is symmetry between biological and technical entities. This assumption implies that the human and non-human subjects participating in the instructional feedback loop lack agency.^[33](#Ch04.xhtml#fn4_33){#Ch04.xhtml#bck_fn4_33}^ Not only does instruction describe and, consequently, fix the embodied actions and perception of subjects in specific positions (spectator, observer, viewer, participant), but by assuming that biological and technical processes are the same, Wiener's theorization of instruction is positioning the human as an operational entity and technology as a passive tool. Thus, I argue that Wiener's theorization of the instruction and learning processes is reinforcing notions of the separation between the human and the machine. His theorization does this through the creation of an active vs. passive dichotomy (active, operational entity vs. passive tool). So how do these issues around instruction manifest themselves in interactive new media installations, if they do at all? How can the viewer/participant subvert or resist it? A good place to start would be to examine Kelly Heaton's installation [The Pool]{.italic} (2001).

[The Pool]{.italic} consists of a 90" Ã 90" custom-designed wall. The wall is painted white and shaped to resemble a meniscus. Embedded into the wall are 400 Furby toy robots.^[34](#Ch04.xhtml#fn4_34){#Ch04.xhtml#bck_fn4_34}^ The Furby have been modified from their original state. Heaton has stripped them of their plush coverings and wired them together. She has then encased them in the wall so that only their "eyes" and "beaks" are visible. The disembodied Furby parts are arranged along the wall in such a way that they mimic a scientific diagram of the molecular structure of water.^[35](#Ch04.xhtml#fn4_35){#Ch04.xhtml#bck_fn4_35}^

Subjected to manipulation, each Furby is chopped up, gutted, and reconfigured, and they assume multiple new identities: a molecule, a specimen, a pixel, a digital interface, a subject, and an object. Heaton has literally dissected both the conceptual idea of "The Furby" and the physical Furby itself, and corporeally transformed it, using its various parts to engender different artistic deployments of the interface. [The Pool]{.italic} then explores notions about what an interface is, or could be, and by doing this Heaton reconfigures the interface as a source of uncertainty and potentiality. Although Heaton's deployment of the Furby as interface challenges us to think critically about notions like the singularity (of the interface) and the separation (of the human and the non-human) in interactive new media art installations, her interface is ultimately a cybernetic one.

![fig4_1.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/tYghUcC.jpeg)

To repeat: cybernetics is a way to regulate machine-based systems by measuring their actual performance in real-time and feeding the results of this performance back into the machine, creating a continual feedback loop.^[36](#Ch04.xhtml#fn4_36){#Ch04.xhtml#bck_fn4_36}^ The purpose of this feedback loop, according to Wiener, is to "control the mechanical tendency towards disorganization; in other words, to produce a temporary and local reversal of the normal direction of entropy."^[37](#Ch04.xhtml#fn4_37){#Ch04.xhtml#bck_fn4_37}^ Hayles (1999a) critiques Wiener's notion of cybernetics, arguing that the premise of Wiener's cybernetic feedback loop disembodies the human subject, and creates boundaries between humans and non-humans, thus exposing, among other things, an oppressive Cartesianism.^[38](#Ch04.xhtml#fn4_38){#Ch04.xhtml#bck_fn4_38}^ As she writes: "When the physical boundaries of the human form are secure, he \[Wiener\] celebrates the flow of information through the organism. All of this changes however, when the boundaries cease to define an autonomous self, either through manipulation or engulfment."^[39](#Ch04.xhtml#fn4_39){#Ch04.xhtml#bck_fn4_39}^

[]{#Ch04.xhtml#page_84 .pagebreak title="84"}These problems occur because first-wave cybernetics, as SÃ¸ren Brier (2008) states, "focuses not on being but on behavior: it does not ask, 'what [is]{.italic} this thing?' but instead, 'what does it [do?]{.italic}' Or how can we make a thing that does this?"^[40](#Ch04.xhtml#fn4_40){#Ch04.xhtml#bck_fn4_40}^ Therefore, the technologies examined and developed in first-wave cybernetics are not self-referential or autopoietic.^[41](#Ch04.xhtml#fn4_41){#Ch04.xhtml#bck_fn4_41}^ The entities studied, as Brier argues, are "all allopoietic, that is created and made by something else, some other system."^[42](#Ch04.xhtml#fn4_42){#Ch04.xhtml#bck_fn4_42}^ Echoing the theories above and building on them, a cybernetic interface in new media art, according to SÃ¸ren Pold (2011), is a form that is "constructed through a remediation of older representational forms ... complete with their various traditions, genres and media characteristics."^[43](#Ch04.xhtml#fn4_43){#Ch04.xhtml#bck_fn4_43}^ It also incorporates cybernetic feedback and interaction, in that it allows the viewer/participant to "interact with its representations and it registers the user and his/her interactions through input devices, sensors and tracking."^[44](#Ch04.xhtml#fn4_44){#Ch04.xhtml#bck_fn4_44}^ Hence, for Pold, a cybernetic interface is a form that simultaneously builds on and incorporates "media history and aesthetic traditions of how to represent things in a way that are distinguishable and meaningful to human perception," and a computerized mechanism that contains "an action-reaction pattern which, through sensors, input devices, tracking, data-mining and surveillance, registers the recipient and incorporates his/her responses and reactions."^[45](#Ch04.xhtml#fn4_45){#Ch04.xhtml#bck_fn4_45}^ Thus, he argues that the cybernetic interface in new media art is able to construct its own perceptional and representational feedback loop.^[46](#Ch04.xhtml#fn4_46){#Ch04.xhtml#bck_fn4_46}^

Applying these notions to [The Pool]{.italic}, the Furbys may exist as interfaces on many levels between hardware and software, and between human and non-human. While they may demonstrate how art has the potential to critically explore and reconfigure notions of objects and subjects, and while they can be seen as a representational medium that is used for cultural production and experience, they are ultimately cybernetic toys. The digital interface is a cybernetic machine that treats all of the information in the installation as a generalized set of numerical data, with no regard or access to the semantics of the information that it is receiving and processing (viewer/participant movements or the meaning of her speech). However, in the specific context of [The Pool]{.italic}, the cybernetic interface also becomes an aesthetic form that has the ability to allow the viewer/participant to make connections between machine, representation, and culture. Thus, the interface in this work is simultaneously a technical tool, a functional medium, and an aesthetic form. While this designation demonstrates the cybernetic interfaces cultural potential, it needs to be examined critically. This is because the Furby is a cybernetic system whose algorithms measure, interpret, and record all the information in the environment in which it is located, and the person interacting with this device is always a part of this information.

For instance, according to Heaton, each Furby is "actuated by a motor to achieve two visible states, open (and talking) or closed (and silent)."^[47](#Ch04.xhtml#fn4_47){#Ch04.xhtml#bck_fn4_47}^ In addition, each Furby contains a microcontroller that prompts it to "speak" in response to the proximity of the viewer/participant. So, when a viewer/participant walks into the exhibition space, she sees a large white wall covered from top to bottom with disembodied sleeping Furby faces. When she approaches the wall, a custom-designed infrared detection system picks up her presence and causes the Furbys to open their eyes. If she walks right up to the wall, the Furbys respond to her presence by opening their beaks and "speaking."^[48](#Ch04.xhtml#fn4_48){#Ch04.xhtml#bck_fn4_48}^

In this particular example, the distinction between interface (the non-human) and the viewer/participant (the human) becomes blurred. Blurring occurs because the Furby is self-referential. It has the ability to "speak" and respond to human speech.

![fig4_2.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/H4rYtwZ.jpeg)

Thus, the Furby can be perceived by the viewer/participant as "intelligent" because it has displayed the elementary human-like ability of speech. While this self-referential "talk" may have the potential to encourage interesting types of interactions, the literal human-to-machine communication in this work can quickly become an issue, particularly because it creates, among other things, a highly constrained looped dialogue between the viewer/participant and the interface. This dialogue, when theorized in combination with the blurring of the human--machine boundary, implies a generalized symmetry between humans and technology. And this, of course, creates a range of problems, one of which is the personification of machines. The personification of []{#Ch04.xhtml#page_86 .pagebreak title="86"}machines tends to occur because, as Suchman (2007a) argues, humans have a tendency to "ascribe full intelligence \[to computerized forms\] on the basis of partial evidence."^[49](#Ch04.xhtml#fn4_49){#Ch04.xhtml#bck_fn4_49}^ She continues by stating that as soon as these computational forms look, or act, remotely human, subjects will endow them with other human-like traits and abilities.^[50](#Ch04.xhtml#fn4_50){#Ch04.xhtml#bck_fn4_50}^ She further contends that subjects "take appearances as evidence for, or the document of, an ascribed underlying reality, while taking the reality so ascribed as a resource for the interpretation of the appearance."^[51](#Ch04.xhtml#fn4_51){#Ch04.xhtml#bck_fn4_51}^

To put this differently, the deployment of the cybernetic interface in [The Pool]{.italic} highlights the uncertainty and potentiality that occurs when the lines between the human and the machine are blurred; however, the cybernetic character of the digital interface can be found in both the machine and the medium. Therefore, the deployment of the interface in [The Pool]{.italic} could be read as problematic because the cybernetic functions of the Furby could influence viewer/participants' interactions with the interface and the in which way subjects and objects are positioned and analyzed. In this sense, the relationship between the Furby and the viewer/participant in [The Pool]{.italic} is presented to the viewer/participant as symmetrical. This is precisely because the blurring of the human--machine boundary (which occurs when a viewer/participant "talks" to the Furbys) incorporates the viewer/participant into it. Thus, the viewer/participant becomes, to a certain extent, part of the interface's cybernetic system herself.

![fig4_3.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/MhcatMg.jpeg)

However [, The Pool]{.italic}, with its dissected cybernetic interface, its symmetrical subjects and objects, and its self-referential dialogue, could be seen as an example of an []{#Ch04.xhtml#page_87 .pagebreak title="87"}artwork that critically questions concepts of equivalence, seamlessness, and erasure, exposes their flaws, and then turns them back against themselves. It does this not through outright opposition, but through replication and parody. Thus, I suggest that the digital interface in [The Pool]{.italic}, and [The Pool]{.italic} as an installation itself, is a playful cybernetic criticism of a cybernetic system. For example, rather than arguing against a system and a mode of thinking of which it is an integral part, I understand [The Pool]{.italic}, with its fragmented cybernetic interface and its underlying scientific significance (the shape of its wall, the arrangement of the Furbys, and Heaton's dual role as artist and taxidermist), as questioning the validity of, and then poking fun at, this cybernetic system and its dubious claims of relation. Instead of expanding discussions around seamlessness or how humans retain a distinct form that is categorically different from technology, I argue that [The Pool]{.italic} exposes the flaws in and around cybernetic systems and human--machine couplings through parodying itself. In doing this, [The Pool]{.italic} provides its viewer/participants with both an alternative and a means to exploit, resist, and/or subvert this goal-oriented cybernetic thinking. To what extent can it be argued that the resistance and subversion of instruction by the viewer/participant ends up challenging notions of separation and symmetry in interactive new media installations? How are these challenges able to reshape the way the viewer/participant interacts with the digital interface? And how effective are they? In this regard, a return to Suchman's (2007a) study of the use of instruction as a rhetorical device would be helpful.

## [[Pre-programmed Actions and Unexpected Experiences: Instruction as a Rhetorical Device]{.bold}](#content.xhtml#bck_sec4_3) {#Ch04.xhtml#sec4_3}

Suchman argues that plans, like instructions, are "conceptual and rhetorical devices (often materialized in various ways, as texts, diagrams and the like) that are deeply consequential for the lived activities of those of us who organize our actions in their terms."^[52](#Ch04.xhtml#fn4_52){#Ch04.xhtml#bck_fn4_52}^ To summarize her argument, Suchman takes issue with previously held ideas in the computer science field about the concept of planning as it relates to artificial intelligence and cybernetics. Plans, according to Suchman, are not models of action; they also act as "resources for people's practical deliberations about action."^[53](#Ch04.xhtml#fn4_53){#Ch04.xhtml#bck_fn4_53}^ While plans are used in the aforementioned disciplines as resources for action, they do not, she writes, determine its course, as they do not fully represent the embodied practices and ever-fluctuating circumstances of the user's action in concrete detail.^[54](#Ch04.xhtml#fn4_54){#Ch04.xhtml#bck_fn4_54}^ A plan's purpose, she suggests, is to orient the user in such a way that they can "obtain the best possible position from which to use those embodied skills on which ... success depends."^[55](#Ch04.xhtml#fn4_55){#Ch04.xhtml#bck_fn4_55}^ Here she is arguing that a plan of action is a set of movements that are utilized by the user to achieve a desired state. However, this plan does not determine the exact action of the user; rather, it recommends courses of action, which are often based on basic assumptions about the user and/or pre-detected behaviors and basic assumptions around them. Its success relies on the user's knowledge of, and embodied response to, the conditions and entities located in their environment, not on the successful completion of the pre-determined steps provided to them.

If we apply this notion to interactive new media art installations, then a plan of action is something the viewer/participant forms based on instruction the artist provides to her through the digital interface. This is done in order to navigate the various images and narratives that she encounters in the installation. However, the fact that []{#Ch04.xhtml#page_88 .pagebreak title="88"}the artist is providing the viewer/participant with instruction via a navigational device (the digital interface) complicates this process because, as argued above, a plan of action is not a series of pre-determined steps executed to accomplish a goal (touch a button, activate an installation). The actions that the viewer/participant makes are reliant on her intentions or purpose in the installation. In other words, the viewer/participant's interactions with the digital interface reflect and represent, but [do not replicate]{.italic}, her specific purpose in interactive new media installations. Given this, the way in which the viewer/participant interacts with and navigates an installation is not a direct result of the instruction provided to her; instead, it arises, as Suchman states, from her situated actions with the forms that occupy the same space.^[56](#Ch04.xhtml#fn4_56){#Ch04.xhtml#bck_fn4_56}^ Thus, the concept of interaction, when deployed in certain installations, can provide options for viewer/participant intervention via resistance and/or subversion of this instruction.

A very good example of how intervention may occur can be found in Rafael Lozano-Hemmer's interactive new media installation [Microphones]{.italic} (2008). The digital interface in [Microphones]{.italic} consists of a set of 1939 vintage Shure brand microphones.^[57](#Ch04.xhtml#fn4_57){#Ch04.xhtml#bck_fn4_57}^ When I viewed the work, in 2010 at the Manchester Art Gallery in Manchester, UK, the microphones were arranged in a circle. In order to activate the installation, I had to approach a microphone and speak into it. The microphone then should, according to Hemmer, "speak back" to me.^[58](#Ch04.xhtml#fn4_58){#Ch04.xhtml#bck_fn4_58}^ The types of responses the microphones should give me vary---half the time they should play back what was just recorded, half the time they should reproduce a recording of a previous subject.^[59](#Ch04.xhtml#fn4_59){#Ch04.xhtml#bck_fn4_59}^ The distribution of responses, Hemmer writes, serve two purposes: it allows the subject to "understand the interaction" occurring in the installation; and it "creates an experience that is outside his or her control."^[60](#Ch04.xhtml#fn4_60){#Ch04.xhtml#bck_fn4_60}^

The way in which the installation is staged in the gallery may help the subject understand the interaction occurring in it on a deeper level, as Hemmer states above. However, based on personal experience, [Microphones]{.italic} did not create an experience outside of my control insomuch as it creates, to an extent, an experience outside the artist's control. I argue that it is this lack of control on behalf of the artist that allowed me to subvert and resist the instruction I was provided with via the digital interface. For example, my interaction with the interfaces in [Microphones]{.italic} and my ability to navigate the installation were not dependent on a deep understanding of external technical conditions of the form that the digital interfaces represent. My actions with the digital interface were instead dependent on my intentions or purpose (place my ear to the microphone, hear a sound). My consequent position in relation to the digital interface, as a listener, was a representation of both my previous interactions in similar situations and the role Hemmer has instructed me, via metaphors and models (microphones, the word "interactive"), to play in the installation.

At this point it is important to note, as Suchman does, that plans are not located outside action.^[61](#Ch04.xhtml#fn4_61){#Ch04.xhtml#bck_fn4_61}^ They are, she states, "moments of situated activity (activities of planning, remembering, etc.), displaced in time and space from the occasion anticipated or recollected."^[62](#Ch04.xhtml#fn4_62){#Ch04.xhtml#bck_fn4_62}^ Following on from Suchman, the instruction provided to the subject in any situation should not be understood as the cause of action; it should be seen as a resource that can be employed by the subject in order to achieve action. Given this, it could be assumed that when I interacted with the digital interface in [Microphones]{.italic}, I was not necessarily following the pre-designed trajectory of the installation provided to me by Hemmer. For, as argued earlier, a plan does not determine the action of the subject. It relies on her ability to recall previously learned information and apply it to

![figs4_4and4_5.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/B8s0PwL.jpeg)

the situation at hand. This then suggests that when I approached the microphone and placed my ear to it, I was navigating the installation based on knowledge and information (how to behave in a gallery setting, how an interactive new media installation works) located outside of Hemmer's control. In other words, Hemmer does not know who will be visiting the gallery and interacting with his work, so he cannot predict []{#Ch04.xhtml#page_91 .pagebreak title="91"}the behavior of every single subject in the gallery space. Thus, he cannot control every aspect of the way they interact with his installation. This lack of control suggests that I could subvert the narrative or resist the instruction provided to me by Hemmer and, to an extent, modify it.

For example, Hemmer is unaware if I had used a microphone in a professional setting (I have not), been to a museum, or seen an interactive installation before (I have). Nor did he have any prior knowledge as to what I would do or say when I approached the microphone. Ultimately, I did not follow the pre-designed trajectory of the installation provided to me by Hemmer. I did not speak into the microphones; rather, I placed my ear on the sides of them and listened. I did this because I assumed the piece was a sound installation---that the microphones were speakers and that they would play, rather than record and then play back, sound. Since I did not speak, I did not hear the pre-recorded response. Therefore, microphones did not "speak back" to me. Thus, I was participating, but not interacting with the work. The fact that I was engaging with and consequently applying my prior experiences with interactive artworks---experiences located outside Hemmer's control---to [Microphones]{.italic} furthermore suggests that I could alter, to an extent, the outcome of the installation. For, as mentioned above, Hemmer cannot predict, and therefore cannot program, all of these experiences into the installation.

How the subject then creates a plan through situated action is not only viewed as a way to complicate the notion of a plan as a detailed set of instructions that simply controls action; this perspective can also be seen as a way for the subject to resist or modify instruction in interactive new media installations. For example, by recalling my past experiences in similar situations and then implementing them in [Microphones]{.italic}, I was able to challenge some, but not all, of the underlying concepts dictated to me by the instruction given and begin to reshape my experience in the installation. I was able to do this because, as mentioned above, my intent or purpose (which was to interact) was never completely reflected in the movements I made with the digital interface (not speaking into it, just listening, so not receiving a response). The lack of response to my actions led me to begin to experiment and question notions surrounding the cause and effect my interactions may have in the installation.

## [[Peripheral Actions and Unintended Consequences: Instruction and the Filtering Process]{.bold}](#content.xhtml#bck_sec4_4) {#Ch04.xhtml#sec4_4}

Suchman is skeptical of the instructional process and our ability to subvert or resist it due to the fact that the main goal of instruction is ultimately to bring "canonical descriptions of objects and actions to bear on the actual objects and embodied actions that the instructions describe."^[63](#Ch04.xhtml#fn4_63){#Ch04.xhtml#bck_fn4_63}^ Instruction, she writes, is a practical tool used to guide action in virtual and physical environments.^[64](#Ch04.xhtml#fn4_64){#Ch04.xhtml#bck_fn4_64}^ It relies on the subject's ability to recognize symbolic representations and act on them. Therefore, instruction not only acts as a framework, or set of prescribed directions for controlling actions in closed systems, but also serves, as Suchman tells us, "as resources for retrospective accounts of what has happened."^[65](#Ch04.xhtml#fn4_65){#Ch04.xhtml#bck_fn4_65}^ Hence, the success of instruction not only lies in the subject's ability to recall previously learned information and apply it to the task at hand, but is also, in her words, "a matter of constructing a particular course of action that is accountable to the general description that the instruction provides. The work of constructing that course is neither exhaustively enumerated in the description, nor []{#Ch04.xhtml#page_92 .pagebreak title="92"}completely captured by a retrospective account of what was done."^[66](#Ch04.xhtml#fn4_66){#Ch04.xhtml#bck_fn4_66}^ Here, Suchman is suggesting that instruction acts as a resource for describing what type of action happened. This description, which is formed based on previous accounts of interaction, serves as a guide for the course of action that the subject takes. However, such a description is not comprehensive because it treats the actions and decisions that the subject makes in the periphery of the installation as unimportant to the completion or activation of the artwork, specifically the actions and decisions that the subject makes that the instruction views as inconsequential.

![fig4_6.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/QwCKtU6.jpeg)

So, when the viewer/participant interacts with the digital interface---an M16 rifle---in Lynn Hershman Leeson's interactive new media installation [America's Finest]{.italic} (1993--4), the instruction that she receives from the artist via the digital interface could be interpreted as a plan for action by both the viewer/participant and the observer.^[67](#Ch04.xhtml#fn4_67){#Ch04.xhtml#bck_fn4_67}^ This is because the instruction the viewer/participant is receiving describes the way she should act: walk up to the rifle, look into the sight, and pull the trigger in []{#Ch04.xhtml#page_93 .pagebreak title="93"}order to view an image; or press the trigger down for an extended period of time to hear a sound and view an image sequence. It dictates the role(s) that the viewer/participant should play in the installation as well (aggressor before the trigger is pulled and victim afterwards).^[68](#Ch04.xhtml#fn4_68){#Ch04.xhtml#bck_fn4_68}^

However, the instruction does not take into consideration all of the actions and their consequences (both intended and unintended) of the decisions that the viewer/participant makes when she uses the rifle. These decisions include simple shifts in movement, variations in activity, and any ethical objections she may have to the form (a weapon) that the interface represents or the positions (aggressor and/or victim) that she assumes upon interaction.^[69](#Ch04.xhtml#fn4_69){#Ch04.xhtml#bck_fn4_69}^ In the case of [America's Finest]{.italic}, these decisions and their consequent results are explicitly intended to be seen as pointless, due to the fact that they do not follow the instruction provided to the viewer/participant by Hershman Leeson.

In being this way, the interface is acting as a filter, much like Mark B.N. Hansen (2004, 2006) believes the human body in virtual environments does, selecting, subtracting, processing, and then reflecting information relevant to the narrative of the installation back on to the viewer/participant, while filtering out the rest as noise.^[70](#Ch04.xhtml#fn4_70){#Ch04.xhtml#bck_fn4_70}^ This regulation can be deliberate, as illustrated by [America's Finest]{.italic}, or unintentional, as seen in [Microphones]{.italic}. Suchman addresses this point, arguing that there is "a determinate relationship between certain un-interpreted actions by the user, read as changes to the state of the machine, and the machine's transition to a next display. By establishing a determinate relationship between detectable user actions and machine response, the design unilaterally administers control over the interaction, but in a way that is conditional on the actions of the user."^[71](#Ch04.xhtml#fn4_71){#Ch04.xhtml#bck_fn4_71}^ Here, Suchman is stating that technology is able to filter information, and that the relationship between the human and the computer is contingent on the user's actions. If the computer is unable to process the user's actions, then the computer will take control and begin to regulate interaction. So, if, for example, the interface in [America's Finest]{.italic} cannot detect or interpret the viewer/participant's movements in a particular sequence, it could exert control over interaction (and by default the installation) by predicting the viewer/participant's current action(s) based on previously detectable and interpretable ones.

Based on the programmed interaction (pull the trigger of the rifle in order to view and change images, hold the trigger down for a period of time in order to view a sequence of images), the software that allows [American's Finest]{.italic} to work filters out the action(s) of the viewer/participant that are deemed unnecessary and moves systematically to the next step, reflecting information relevant to the completion of the installation back on to the viewer/participant. Thus, I argue, Hershman Leeson is not only able to designate which actions will affect the installation (look into the sight, pull the trigger), but she is also able to regulate and, to an extent, fix the viewer/participant's movements (stand in a specific place, swivel the rifle) and position (aggressor and then victim) in the installation as well.

However, how instruction is deployed to regulate viewer/participant actions and behavior is more complicated than the filtering process described above. There is confusion between how the viewer/participant acts, how she interprets these actions, how the interface is programmed to interpret action, and how these actions are viewed by others in the same space. For instance, just because the viewer/participant believes an action she makes in the installation (pulling a trigger on a rifle) will mimic the way she perceives the outcome of her action in the physical world (shooting, either offensively or defensively, in order to maim or kill) does not necessarily mean it will. And in [America's Finest]{.italic} it does not, as pulling the trigger of the gun causes the viewer/participant to become the victim of her own actions.^[72](#Ch04.xhtml#fn4_72){#Ch04.xhtml#bck_fn4_72}^ Nor does it mean that others located in the same space will view these actions as offensive or aggressive ones. They could easily be understood as defensive, by either the viewer/participant performing the action, or by those observing it. For, as stated above, there is confusion between how the viewer/participant perceives her actions, how her actions affect the underlying narrative of the installation, and how others see them.

![fig4_7.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/V9dlHLr.jpeg)

Suchman addresses this point, raising questions about the relationship between how projected or reconstructed courses of action in situations---specifically the relationship between deliberation and reflection---are both viewed and formed. She contends, in short, that confusion occurs because directed action is always integrally yet problematically related to two types of activities: situated ad hoc improvisation, which she defines as "the part of us, so to speak, that actually acts," and the other, which she writes is derived from these ad hoc improvisations and includes "our representations of action in the form of future plans and retrospective accounts."^[73](#Ch04.xhtml#fn4_73){#Ch04.xhtml#bck_fn4_73}^ These descriptions, she tells us, are formed either before or after the action performed by the subject in the form of imagined projections (the plan created before the action based on instruction given) and recollected reconstructions (descriptions of past actions).^[74](#Ch04.xhtml#fn4_74){#Ch04.xhtml#bck_fn4_74}^

Suchman continues, stating that this method of representation relies upon "the recipient's ability to do the implicit work of anchoring descriptions to concrete objects

![fig4_8.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/AJs70Qj.jpeg)

and actions."^[75](#Ch04.xhtml#fn4_75){#Ch04.xhtml#bck_fn4_75}^ Thus, plans and retrospective accounts of plans are distinguished from action because, she argues, in order to "represent our actions we must in some way make an object of them."^[76](#Ch04.xhtml#fn4_76){#Ch04.xhtml#bck_fn4_76}^ Following on from this, I argue that to provide an accurate account of the abstract nature of the digital interface in interactive new media installations, we must be able to make sense of the actions we perform with it and the []{#Ch04.xhtml#page_96 .pagebreak title="96"}interactions we observe others making when using it, and in order to do so, we must be able to connect them to something tangible and familiar.

For example, the rifle in [America's Finest]{.italic} is a familiar cultural form. The form is not neutral, but rather is laden with multiple, often contradictory, socio-political and cultural meanings. Hershman Leeson has taken this form, along with its underlying cultural meanings, turned it into a digital interface, and placed it in an interactive new media installation. Furthermore, the interface is fitted with electronic measurement devices and is pre-programmed to perform specific functions and transmit specific messages to the viewer/participant---functions and messages that differ from those of the cultural form it mimics (a rifle). Since the instructional method relies on the ability of the viewer/participant to anchor abstract descriptions to concrete forms and actions, it could be argued that the relationship between form and content in [America's Finest]{.italic} allows the viewer/participant to make the actions of abstract technological systems tangible and relatable. In doing this, the viewer/participant is able to comprehend, to an extent, the underlying narrative of the work: a commentary on how the violence of weapons is portrayed in the media.^[77](#Ch04.xhtml#fn4_77){#Ch04.xhtml#bck_fn4_77}^

The fact that the shape the digital interface in Hershman Leeson's installation takes is a familiar one does not necessarily mean that the viewer/participant can predict the type of response that her actions will elicit, although in some cases she can. For example, we can predict, to an extent, what will happen when we pull a trigger of a gun. However, a rifle has multiple meanings, and these meanings, like its interfacial counterpart in [America's Finest]{.italic}, are open to interpretation. This openness suggests that the ability on behalf of the viewer/participant to navigate the installation and comprehend the underlying narrative of the work is not a precondition of the digital interface or the form it takes; rather, it is the product of the viewer/participant's embodied experience with it. And it is this embodied experience, I posit, that allows the viewer/participant to begin to rethink her relationship to the interface, subvert or resist the instruction provided to her, and interact with it in different ways. For it is through the acts of subversion and resistance to instruction that the viewer/participant can begin to modify the underlying narratives of the texts embedded in the rifle and create different structures, forms, and meanings with them.

## [[Shared Ontological Systems and the Emergence of Different Dialogues]{.bold}](#content.xhtml#bck_sec4_5) {#Ch04.xhtml#sec4_5}

In conclusion, I would like to critically interrogate some of the limitations surrounding the use of the cybernetic interface in interactive new media installations---specifically those around the transmission and interpretation of instruction. Of particular concern is the loss of information that occurs through this process and the effects that this may have on how the viewer/participant translates the instruction that the artist is trying to convey through the interface. As argued above, instruction relies on the viewer/participant's ability to connect intangible descriptions of actions and movements to tangible signs and forms. In order to then accomplish a task, the viewer/participant must first be able to interpret the information she is presented with. As Wiener writes: "The amount of information carried with actual terminal equipment depends on the ability of the \[subject\] to transmit or to employ the information received."^[78](#Ch04.xhtml#fn4_78){#Ch04.xhtml#bck_fn4_78}^ Put simply, the amount and type of information transmitted []{#Ch04.xhtml#page_97 .pagebreak title="97"}by the digital interface (and by extension the artist) is reliant on the ability of the subject to process present information and then act upon previous instructions provided to her.

On this point, Dourish argues that the loss of information is a direct result of the use of certain types of ontological systems of representation. Dourish is specifically concerned with how these systems are used as a basis for designing interactive systems in the computer science field.^[79](#Ch04.xhtml#fn4_79){#Ch04.xhtml#bck_fn4_79}^ Ontological systems are structures of meanings, which programmers use to assess their relationship to physical forms and conceptual theories in order to digitally reproduce them in machines. These systems, Dourish writes, are used to address questions like "how we can individuate the world, or distinguish between one entity and another; how we can understand the relationships between different entities or classes of entity."^[80](#Ch04.xhtml#fn4_80){#Ch04.xhtml#bck_fn4_80}^ Echoing Suchman's argument surrounding intelligent and embodied action, Dourish states that the use of ontological systems of representation as the basis of design for interactive systems are detrimental to the instructional process due to the fact that there is "imbalance between the situated organization of practical action and the regimented models that systems embody."^[81](#Ch04.xhtml#fn4_81){#Ch04.xhtml#bck_fn4_81}^ He continues, writing that when designing complex computerized systems like interfaces, major issues, such as the miscommunication of information, manifest themselves quite quickly as they are "consequences of assuming that ontological structures are shared and static."^[82](#Ch04.xhtml#fn4_82){#Ch04.xhtml#bck_fn4_82}^ Here Dourish is arguing that while a design element may reflect the programmers' specific ontological system, it does not necessarily provide meaning for the subject. Not only does the use of an ontological system assume shared meaning, but, he writes, it also promotes "the idea that there is only one ontology in play."^[83](#Ch04.xhtml#fn4_83){#Ch04.xhtml#bck_fn4_83}^ In short, the concept of a single, shared ontology presents issues because it implies that systems of meaning are stable. Furthermore, it suggests that the subject and the programmer or artist share the same model of both the physical and virtual world, despite the fact that they have very different experiences of it. So how does this limitation manifest itself in, and what does it mean for, interactive new media installations?

A good place to begin this investigation is Jeffrey Shaw's [conFIGURING the CAVE]{.italic} (1996). The digital interface in this installation is a near-life-sized replica of a wooden artist mannequin located in the center of a CAVE environment.^[84](#Ch04.xhtml#fn4_84){#Ch04.xhtml#bck_fn4_84}^ The mannequin is fitted with electronic measurement devices, which are embedded in its moveable joints.^[85](#Ch04.xhtml#fn4_85){#Ch04.xhtml#bck_fn4_85}^ A single viewer/participant outfitted with a HMD controls its motions.^[86](#Ch04.xhtml#fn4_86){#Ch04.xhtml#bck_fn4_86}^ In addition to the interface, [conFIGURING the CAVE]{.italic} consists of seven differentiated pictorial and audio domains that display, in Shaw's words, an "emergent complexity of mutable forms and organic abstractions which are conjoined with representative and symbolic images."^[87](#Ch04.xhtml#fn4_87){#Ch04.xhtml#bck_fn4_87}^ These domains are generated through custom algorithms, and each one is distinctive. To access them, the viewer/participant must interact with the interface.

However, if the viewer/participant is unable to identify the mannequin as interface, then she will not be able to interact with it as such, which means she is unable to activate the piece. Similarly, if she misinterprets or does not understand the metaphors (touching equals activity, a head denotes vision) that Shaw has deployed to supply her with navigational information in the installation, or if she is unable to connect the movements of the limbs of the interface to the movement of the images in the CAVE, she will be unable to transition between domains or scenes. Thus, she will be unable to navigate the installation.

![figs4_9and4_10.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/YZCNUEj.jpeg)

[]{#Ch04.xhtml#page_99 .pagebreak title="99"}The inability to process instruction on behalf of the viewer/participant due to the deployment of unsatisfactory metaphors by the artist can result in miscommunication---an act that, Wiener argues, means "information may be lost which can never be regained."^[88](#Ch04.xhtml#fn4_88){#Ch04.xhtml#bck_fn4_88}^ Wiener continues by stating that the process of transmitting information in technological systems may involve "several consecutive stages of transmission following one another in addition to the final or effective stage; and between any two of these there will be an act of translation, capable of dissipating information."^[89](#Ch04.xhtml#fn4_89){#Ch04.xhtml#bck_fn4_89}^ In short, Wiener is arguing that the transmission of instruction is a multifaceted and sequential, but not necessarily linear, process that relies on, among other things, the act of translation, and because of this, the loss of information can occur.

Loss of information is of course detrimental to [conFIGURING the CAVE]{.italic}. It can lead to confusion surrounding the operations of the installation, disorientation of the viewer/participant, or, as exampled above, the viewer/participant, unable to navigate the work, may give up and leave---an action that results in the complete failure of the installation. However, the fact that information may leak out of the system, never to be seen again, is not an issue for Wiener. As he states: "That information may be dissipated but not gained is as we have seen the cybernetic form of the second law of thermodynamics."^[90](#Ch04.xhtml#fn4_90){#Ch04.xhtml#bck_fn4_90}^ Here Wiener is arguing that the loss of information is not detrimental, but a natural part of the instructional process. Thus, he does not consider it to be a major problem. Building on Wiener's assertion, I argue that it is possible for this loss of information to yield more interesting results in interactive new media installations. For example, if the viewer/participant is unable to process instructions or operate the interface properly, she may begin to explore the artwork from a different vantage point or experiment in different ways with the tools provided. Take, for instance, the second domain of [conFIGURING the CAVE]{.italic}. When the viewer/participant enters this domain, layered images of text, characters, and hieroglyphs appear.^[91](#Ch04.xhtml#fn4_91){#Ch04.xhtml#bck_fn4_91}^ When she moves the mannequin's limbs, the graphics and text change.^[92](#Ch04.xhtml#fn4_92){#Ch04.xhtml#bck_fn4_92}^ If she is unable to connect the movement of the mannequin's limbs to the movement of the text and images, these images remain static.^[93](#Ch04.xhtml#fn4_93){#Ch04.xhtml#bck_fn4_93}^ However, failure to process instruction and activate the images in the installation may prompt the viewer/participant to begin to experiment with the mannequin in different ways. Instead of lifting the legs of the digital interface up and down (an action that imitates walking in the physical world), she may begin to experiment and tilt the artist doll completely upside down or move its head around---actions which cause a circular three-dimensional representation of an ancient Chinese rubbing-stone carved with text to appear on the floor.^[94](#Ch04.xhtml#fn4_94){#Ch04.xhtml#bck_fn4_94}^

I argue that experimentation with, and a critical interrogation of, actions of the digital interface allows the viewer/participant to concentrate on the creation or alteration of forms that differ from those that would have appeared if there was no loss of information. By selecting a familiar cultural form and designating it a digital interface, Shaw is tacitly acknowledging his relationship to a set of publicly available and organized series of signs, forms, and actions. However, this relationship is fraught due to the fact that it presumes and then promotes the idea that systems of meaning and representation are both stable and shared, when in fact they are flexible, they fluctuate, and are open to interpretation.

Despite this, the digital interface in Shaw's installation is a representation of a human form---a representation that has the ability to generate ruptures and gaps in []{#Ch04.xhtml#page_100 .pagebreak title="100"}dominant narratives and to produce resistant readings. Given this, by interacting with this form, I argue that the viewer/participant is able to begin to subvert the instruction provided to her via the digital interface and to begin to modify the underlying narrative of the work (originality, being at the origin of and creation or constructing something out of nothing). Thus, she is able to begin to reposition herself as creator, or co-creator, and by extension the locus of interaction in [conFIGURING the CAVE]{.italic}. In this way, the subversion of instruction by the viewer/participant allows a different dialogue between the human and the machine to appear---one that points toward the emergence of multiple perspectives and different theorizations of the relationships and narratives that Shaw is presenting her with.

The emergence of a different type of dialogue between the viewer/participant and the digital interface does not occur because the actions that the viewer/participant makes with the digital interface have changed (as those are, albeit within very narrow limits, pre-determined by the algorithms that the artist employs, as well as the environment in which the viewer/participant is acting). Instead, as Amelia Jones (2001) suggests, this dialogue has appeared because the way we think about and discuss the relationship between the body and technology has, to an extent, changed.^[95](#Ch04.xhtml#fn4_95){#Ch04.xhtml#bck_fn4_95}^ This change in thinking, Jones states, has occurred, in part, because of the proliferation of digital technologies in the early twentieth century, which allow different types of thinking and "technologically mediated modes of being" to emerge.^[96](#Ch04.xhtml#fn4_96){#Ch04.xhtml#bck_fn4_96}^

Jones argues that the concept of translation (reading and writing) was the principal technique used by artists at the height of the Industrial Revolution to connect the body with the new industrialized technology, so translation was the "primary mode of interface between body and technologized world."^[97](#Ch04.xhtml#fn4_97){#Ch04.xhtml#bck_fn4_97}^ Jones continues stating that due to the proliferation of concepts like cybernetics and commodity culture that occurred after the Second World War, the view of the relationship between the body and technology described above, alongside the primary techniques used to articulate this relationship, collapsed.^[98](#Ch04.xhtml#fn4_98){#Ch04.xhtml#bck_fn4_98}^ This collapse, Jones tells us, combined with the "growing awareness of the brutal potential of technology in its military forms," led to enactments of the human body as performance of the work of art.^[99](#Ch04.xhtml#fn4_99){#Ch04.xhtml#bck_fn4_99}^ And artists employing this practice "insisted on the coextensivity of body/machine and vision/machine, of artist and interpreter."^[100](#Ch04.xhtml#fn4_100){#Ch04.xhtml#bck_fn4_100}^ This focus on the body, embodiment and, co-extensivity of the human and the machine, Jones states, meant "enactment, or performance replaced translation as modes for articulating the hinge between body and technology."^[101](#Ch04.xhtml#fn4_101){#Ch04.xhtml#bck_fn4_101}^ In this way, representation, Jones argues, is no longer theorized as static, so it is no longer articulated through images or words, but rather it is seen as processual. It is articulated through the embodied performance of the viewer/participant.^[102](#Ch04.xhtml#fn4_102){#Ch04.xhtml#bck_fn4_102}^

Jones's rethinking of performance as the primary mode of communication between the body and technology allows me to argue that the digital interface as an individual computerized device---a visible technological thing---that provides instruction and mediates a relationship between the viewer/participant and artist that, while important and physically there, is no longer necessary in interactive new media art installations as it is, and has always to an extent been, the viewer/participant who performs these acts. The reconstitution of the interface as the human body in interactive new media installations points toward the next thematic discussed in this thesis: ubiquitous computing (ubicomp).

# [[5 []{#Ch05.xhtml#page_105 .pagebreak title="105"}The Ubiquitous Interface: Part I]{.bold}](#content.xhtml#bck_Ch05) {#Ch05.xhtml#Ch05}

The aesthetic of Scott Snibbe's interactive new media installation [Boundary Functions]{.italic} (1998) is a minimalistic one. The gallery was dark when I entered, the walls bare, and other than a blank projection surface covering the floor, the space was empty. When I walked onto the surface, it remained blank. When another viewer/participant joined me, a closed-circuit camera began to record our action, activating the piece. Our captured performance was transmitted to a computer, where it was processed, generating a white line, which was projected onto the surface.^[1](#Ch05.xhtml#fn5_1){#Ch05.xhtml#bck_fn5_1}^ The line produced a real-time Voronoi diagram that temporarily divided the surface into autonomous regions, based on our physical location in the installation.^[2](#Ch05.xhtml#fn5_2){#Ch05.xhtml#bck_fn5_2}^ For example, when I walked onto the surface with another viewer/participant, the line bisected it. If three of us walked onto the surface, the line divided it into thirds. The line was not static; it was animated and mobile. If I stepped directly on or attempted to jump over the line, it moved out of the way or followed me. No matter what I did, the line responded dynamically, keeping an even distance between me and other viewer/participants.

The line not only visually divided the surface of the piece, but it also acted, as the name of the artwork suggests, as a boundary. Its purpose was to obstruct, to stop me from gaining access to other viewer/participants. In this way, the line was regulatory---it was used to control my actions in the installation. It did this by reinforcing specific notions of what a subject was (me), what an object was (the line, others interacting with the piece), and what our relationship to each other was or could be (one of opposites). However, just because this boundary existed and was visible did not mean that I could not subvert it.

I did just this. I worked together with other viewer/participants and eliminated the line. All I had to do to accomplish this was to hold hands with another viewer/participant and the boundary between us disappeared. The principle interaction in [Boundary Functions]{.italic}, then, was not one of repetition of previously posited theoretical frameworks or behaviors as discussed in earlier chapters; instead, it was about rethinking and rebuilding relationships and spaces. [Boundary Functions]{.italic} did this by allowing me to think seriously about the restrictions, constraints, and potential possibilities of the representational and technical systems I was interacting with. I could then intervene in these systems and the underlying meanings and stories they promote, destabilize, to an extent, and rewrite them through creative and experimental collaboration with others.

This chapter builds on my experience with [Boundary Functions]{.italic}. It examines the use of new interface technologies in interactive new media installations, the utopian and dystopian stories told about these technologies, and the consequent meanings attributed to them. I look at installations that intervene in these stories, critically examining the claims about technology they make, the relationships that these claims promote, and the potential that artistic and collaborative experimentation has for destabilizing and reconfiguring them. I turn to a recent story being told around our human relationship to technology: ubiquitous computing (ubicomp) and its flourishing, yet fragmented and contradictory image of the "invisible" digital interface.

![fig5_1.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/A0manKZ.jpeg)

Very simply put, ubicomp is a "post-desktop" paradigm for HCI. It refers to the seamless integration of technology into every place, object, building, and body.^[3](#Ch05.xhtml#fn5_3){#Ch05.xhtml#bck_fn5_3}^ These technologies are deemed "invisible" by those writing about them and creating them because their inner workings, as well as junctures and communications with other entities, are concealed, hidden away, and thus become imperceptible to the user. In this chapter, I argue that the invisibility of the interface, as it is presented in some texts on ubicomp, is problematic because the word "invisible" is used to position the interface as a natural, neutral, or value-free boundary between humans and machines. The interface mediates, frames, constrains, and thus determines, to an extent, our experience in the space in which we are located. Given this, there is nothing neutral or natural about the interface, even if it has become naturalized. Rather, the word "invisible," when applied to the interface in ubicomp contexts, is used to mask closed and regulatory computational systems that control users' access to content and their creative experimentation with the interface. I will outline what is at stake in this argument, suggesting that the so-called invisibility of the interface standardizes and sanitizes viewer/participant experience with technology. In doing this, viewer/participant []{#Ch05.xhtml#page_107 .pagebreak title="107"}behavior and experience in interactive new media installations is, among other things, reduced to an algorithmic commodity, creating a single, stable, unified perspective of what the interface, and interaction with it, is rather than what it could become.^[4](#Ch05.xhtml#fn5_4){#Ch05.xhtml#bck_fn5_4}^

## [[What is Ubiquitous Computing?]{.bold}](#content.xhtml#bck_sec5_1) {#Ch05.xhtml#sec5_1}

Ubicomp is a term describing the seamless integration of computers into everyday objects, bodies, and artworks, thereby creating environments that are completely saturated with technology. Ubicomp takes many different forms across cultural, aesthetic, socio-political, and technical landscapes. It encompasses everything from the mundane (subway passes), to the aesthetic (installations like [Boundary Functions]{.italic}), to the outrageous (talking doors and toilets found in science fiction), to commercial products (video game consoles and smartphones). These devices, as Lori Emerson (2014) writes, are sometimes referred to as ubiquitous interfaces, as they are the point of interaction between two or more entities of a ubicomp system.^[5](#Ch05.xhtml#fn5_5){#Ch05.xhtml#bck_fn5_5}^ Ubiquitous interfaces are deemed "invisible" by those writing about and creating them because they are imperceptible to their users.

The invisibility of the ubiquitous interface will be understood in this chapter with reference to the foundational texts on ubicomp, particularly those written by computer scientist Mark Weiser (1988--96). I draw on Weiser's definitions of invisibility, rather than more recent ones, in order to explore the implications that the invisibility of the interface has on viewer/participant interaction and for interactive new media installations in general. Furthermore, I use Weiser's definition of invisibility because, as Emerson rightly points out, Weiser's theories are responsible for introducing it into the lexicon of interface design, defining this term "as a device's ability to be simultaneously everywhere yet also unexceptional in how it ideally lacks an identity."^[6](#Ch05.xhtml#fn5_6){#Ch05.xhtml#bck_fn5_6}^

Invisibility, according to Weiser, is the main characteristic that differentiates ubicomp from the personal computer (PC) and other modes of HCI.^[7](#Ch05.xhtml#fn5_7){#Ch05.xhtml#bck_fn5_7}^ Invisibility is such a significant characteristic for Weiser that he returns to this point repeatedly throughout his essays on the topic.^[8](#Ch05.xhtml#fn5_8){#Ch05.xhtml#bck_fn5_8}^ It is imperative, he argues, to "conceive of a new way of thinking about computers in the world ... that takes into account the natural human environment and allows the computers themselves to vanish into the background."^[9](#Ch05.xhtml#fn5_9){#Ch05.xhtml#bck_fn5_9}^ In doing this, he suggests that interfaces in ubicomp contexts will become "so unobtrusive we will not even notice our increased ability for informed action."^[10](#Ch05.xhtml#fn5_10){#Ch05.xhtml#bck_fn5_10}^ Weiser continues his theorization, stating that interfaces should be analogous to the written word; they should be "an integral, invisible part of the way people live their lives."^[11](#Ch05.xhtml#fn5_11){#Ch05.xhtml#bck_fn5_11}^ Thus, ubiquitous interfaces provide a more "natural" type of interaction because they "get out of the way," allowing the user to focus on other, more important things.^[12](#Ch05.xhtml#fn5_12){#Ch05.xhtml#bck_fn5_12}^ Given the importance Weiser places on invisibility in his essays, the majority of the questions I ask will revolve around this concept. Why make interfaces invisible? What relationships, processes, and structures is the word "invisibility" suggestive of? What relationships, processes, and information does it conceal or reveal? How does ubicomp, and the claims it makes, change via artistic experimentation in interactive new media installations, if it does at all?

In order to fully understand the concept of invisibility as well as the possible change in thinking that artistic experimentation with ubiquitous interfaces may enable, it is necessary to explore both what the ubiquitous interface is positioned as [becoming]{.italic}, as referenced in the foundational texts on ubicomp, and how we experience these []{#Ch05.xhtml#page_108 .pagebreak title="108"}positionings in interactive new media installations. I use the word "becoming" here not merely in the sense of a set of linear cultural and technological changes culminating in the realization of semi-realistic potentialities, but more in the sense of what these future positionings may or may not signify (helpfulness, user-friendliness, inaccessibility, erasure) and how they connect to past imaginings of ubicomp. I will focus on three interconnected concepts that Weiser and other scholars use to describe ubiquitous interfaces---invisibility, calm, and attractiveness---and the claims they perpetuate. I say these concepts are interconnected because they are used to describe the same thing---the disappearance of the interface.

Concepts of calm and attractiveness will be understood in Weiser's terms because, like the notion of invisibility discussed above, Weiser is responsible for introducing them into the lexicon of interface design. Attractiveness, for Weiser, refers to technology that makes itself the center of human attention.^[13](#Ch05.xhtml#fn5_13){#Ch05.xhtml#bck_fn5_13}^ Technology should not be, he argues, something "I need to talk to, give commands to, or have a relationship with."^[14](#Ch05.xhtml#fn5_14){#Ch05.xhtml#bck_fn5_14}^ Rather, technology should disappear into the background. In this way, attractiveness is deemed undesirable from within a ubiquitous computing context, because attractiveness is the opposite of invisible. The notion of calm refers to technology that is free from excitement and that does not require the full attention of the person using it. Calm technology does this, Weiser states, by engaging both the center and the periphery of the user's attention, moving back and forth between the two depending on the context, leaving the user, not the computer, "serene and in control" of the situation or task at hand.^[15](#Ch05.xhtml#fn5_15){#Ch05.xhtml#bck_fn5_15}^ I will treat the three concepts mentioned above (invisibility, attractiveness, and calm) as necessary conditions of ubiquitous interfaces only in the sense that these concepts are the foundations on which the theory of ubicomp is built---they are necessary, but not sufficient or definitive. I do not suggest that ubiquitous interfaces can be reduced to these concepts. However, I do believe that these concepts and the claims that they generate are significant enough to merit a critical investigation into what their nature is and how they manifest themselves in interactive new media installations.

I begin my exploration of ubiquitous interfaces by critically examining how ubicomp is framed and presented to us in the foundational papers, and apply them to the use of the ubiquitous interface in interactive new media installations of David Rokeby (2012) and Scott Snibbe (2002). The theory I explore, and the consequent interactive new media installations that I apply them to, are invaluable to my conceptualization of the ubiquitous interface as they critically evaluate the principal claims and question the foundations on which the concept of ubicomp is based. Approaching ubicomp from this perspective will situate my theory of the digital interface at the boundary of the STS and humanities fields, as well as apply it to issues of invisibility and aesthetics. The issue of invisibility is embedded in the notion of the interface as a calming, unattractive technology, as theorized by Weiser in the foundational papers and consequently adopted in the aforementioned fields. The concepts of aesthetics and interactivity will be developed in relation to notions of viewer/participant creativity and choice.

## [[A "Shift" in Computing]{.bold}](#content.xhtml#bck_sec5_2) {#Ch05.xhtml#sec5_2}

In his 1988 article "The Computer for the 21st Century," Mark Weiser introduced the concept of ubicomp, later on defining it as "the method of enhancing computer use by making many computers available throughout the physical environment."^[16](#Ch05.xhtml#fn5_16){#Ch05.xhtml#bck_fn5_16}^ The []{#Ch05.xhtml#page_109 .pagebreak title="109"}availability and integration of technology into the physical environment is significant for Weiser as he believes it will result in a space in which "each person is continually interacting with hundreds of nearby wirelessly interconnected computers."^[17](#Ch05.xhtml#fn5_17){#Ch05.xhtml#bck_fn5_17}^ The ultimate point of creating ubiquitous environments is twofold. I say twofold because ubicomp, as it is presented to us by Weiser in the foundational papers, has two interrelated, yet contradictory goals: one humanist and one technicist. The first goal is humanist as ubicomp is centered on users and their interactions with technology. For example, the point of ubicomp, in Weiser's words, is to "create a new kind of relationship of people to computers, one in which the computer would have to take the lead in becoming vastly better at getting out of the way so people could just go about their lives."^[18](#Ch05.xhtml#fn5_18){#Ch05.xhtml#bck_fn5_18}^ Here Weiser is advocating for what he believes is a better way of interacting with technology, one that shifts attention away from technology (via the integration of multiple small, unobtrusive, or "invisible" interfaces into environments) onto the user and their interactions with other humans.

The other goal of ubicomp is technicist. It is technicist in that it is technologically driven and focused on technical knowledge. The point of ubicomp is, as Weiser writes, "to achieve the most effective kind of technology, that which is essentially invisible to the user."^[19](#Ch05.xhtml#fn5_19){#Ch05.xhtml#bck_fn5_19}^ He states that in order for ubiquitous systems to become invisible, and thus effective, those designing them need to find "the right balance of features."^[20](#Ch05.xhtml#fn5_20){#Ch05.xhtml#bck_fn5_20}^ This balance must meet the specific "niche" for which the device is being designed. For example, if the device is being designed for a sound system in an interactive new media installation, then it would have to meet the technical requirements (power amplification, signal processing, other additional aural requirements), the aesthetic needs of the installation (adapt to the gallery space and the installation, complement on-screen visuals), and the needs of the user (be easy to activate and audible).

However, the only features that ubicomp devices must include, according to Weiser, are "display size, bandwidth, processing and memory."^[21](#Ch05.xhtml#fn5_21){#Ch05.xhtml#bck_fn5_21}^ Given this, an artist designing an interface for a sound system would not have to consider the aesthetic aspects of the device (what it looked like, how it fit in the gallery space and the installation, how it complements the on-screen visuals). She only has to take into consideration the technical requirements: its size (can it fit into a speaker or a microphone?), bandwidth (what frequency is it operating on and what is its data transfer rate?), and its processing and memory capabilities (how much information can it store and how fast can it process?).

So, ubicomp, as described in the foundational papers by Weiser, is seemingly focused on our relationship to and interaction with technology. Yet, the features and relationships Weiser discusses throughout his texts are mostly instrumental ones. As he writes: "The balance for us emphasizes communication, ram, multi-media, and expansion ports."^[22](#Ch05.xhtml#fn5_22){#Ch05.xhtml#bck_fn5_22}^ Furthermore, in order to be effective, these features must be inexpensive and easy to acquire, or "off the shelf."^[23](#Ch05.xhtml#fn5_23){#Ch05.xhtml#bck_fn5_23}^ Central to ubicomp, then, is the development of affordable, embedded, and invisible technology, and the different types of interaction and relationships between machines and machines that these devices may bring about. In short, what appears to be humanist, in Weiser's writings, is actually technicist. I say technicist because the focus of ubicomp is not on what it can do for us, but on the technology itself, and what it can do in its environment. I suggest this because Weiser's emphasis is on the size, speed, power, performance, and affordability of the technology developed, not on the relationships that people have with their machines.

[]{#Ch05.xhtml#page_110 .pagebreak title="110"}While Weiser acknowledges that this balance of features includes communication, the type of communication he promotes is not human-to-computer or human-to-human; rather, it is communication between computers and computers (pens, boards, tabs, pads) and the underlying software and hardware (ram, expansion ports) that enable them to function. In this way, the goals on which Weiser's theory of ubicomp is based are predicated on false divisions between the biological, the technological, and the economic(al)---or, to put it more simply: capital, computers and consumers.

Sarah Kember (2013) writes that ubiquitous technologies are based on false divisions in the sense that they "articulate and disarticulate, avow and disavow" the entanglement of life, technology, and capital.^[24](#Ch05.xhtml#fn5_24){#Ch05.xhtml#bck_fn5_24}^ Significantly, for Kember, the entanglement "of technologies and users" in ubicomp discourses "belies the false divisions that persist through new, social and what is sometimes referred to as cross media."^[25](#Ch05.xhtml#fn5_25){#Ch05.xhtml#bck_fn5_25}^ While directly related to Ambient Intelligence, photography, and face recognition technology, the point for Kember, and the importance of her argument to mine, is that technoscience industries "are taking on the media industries, incorporating them in ways that are utterly asymmetric and exploiting our agential intra-actions or dynamic relations with technology in order to derive value from them."^[26](#Ch05.xhtml#fn5_26){#Ch05.xhtml#bck_fn5_26}^ They do this, she writes, in multiple ways: by reviving and repackaging e-commerce strategies (the replacement of venture capitalists and bankers with "prosumers"), reviving and repackaging previous scientific research into the intersection between life, technology, and media (Artificial Life, Artificial Intelligence), and by "making direct claims on the everyday and on social environments constituted by users and intelligent artifacts alike."^[27](#Ch05.xhtml#fn5_27){#Ch05.xhtml#bck_fn5_27}^

The direct claims that the technoscience industries are making on the everyday, Kember explains, are often contradictory.^[28](#Ch05.xhtml#fn5_28){#Ch05.xhtml#bck_fn5_28}^ They cross already unstable boundaries between the public, the personal, and the private, as well as the professional and the amateur, and the human and the non-human. They come in different forms, depending on the particular type of discourse, technology, and environment they are associated with and the scholars or corporations writing about, designing, or promoting them. Some, like discourses around Ambient Intelligence, as Kember discusses in her article, are created for specific sectors or audiences and deemed ordinary or helpful, whereas other more interfacial products, like Google Glass or the Apple Watch, are called extraordinary and life-changing. While these discourses and devices have their own unique vision and version of media, technology, and computing, they all have, Kember tells us, one thing in common: they all emerge out of research conducted in the realm of ubicomp.^[29](#Ch05.xhtml#fn5_29){#Ch05.xhtml#bck_fn5_29}^ Thus, they are "incorporated within the claims and innovations associated with the wider discourse of ubiquitous computing."^[30](#Ch05.xhtml#fn5_30){#Ch05.xhtml#bck_fn5_30}^ As she writes: "Such claims have come from research in ubiquitous computing and they materialized through new discourses and innovations that, by means of the media and technologies of (everyday) life, seek to change the very meaning of it."^[31](#Ch05.xhtml#fn5_31){#Ch05.xhtml#bck_fn5_31}^ So, how should we understand the relationship between the future of ubicomp that Weiser predicted and its present state as detailed by theorists like Kember? Well, a good first step in developing this understanding would be to examine the underlying goals of ubicomp. A second good step would be to explore how these goals have changed since Weiser wrote the foundational papers.

One of the main goals of ubicomp is to bring about a "shift" in computing---one that Weiser believes will allow human-to-human interactions to become dominant over individual users' interactions with personal computers. Thus, it is a shift that suggests a very subtle move, on Weiser's behalf, from analyzing the relationship []{#Ch05.xhtml#page_111 .pagebreak title="111"}between the biological and the technical as separate (one isolated human and one isolated computer that sometimes talk to each other) toward theorizing the human and technology as entangled entities.

For example, the idea of ubicomp, Weiser writes, first came about via personal research into "the place of today's computer in actual activities of everyday life."^[32](#Ch05.xhtml#fn5_32){#Ch05.xhtml#bck_fn5_32}^ Citing academic studies into situated learning in classroom- and office-based settings---specifically those conducted by Lucy Suchman (1987) and Jean Lave (1991)---people, Weiser states, "primarily work in a world of shared situations and unexamined technological skills. However, the computer today is isolated and isolating from the overall situation and fails to get out of the way of the work."^[33](#Ch05.xhtml#fn5_33){#Ch05.xhtml#bck_fn5_33}^ The goal of ubicomp, for Weiser, is to rectify these problems: to make the computer less isolating and to get it out of the way.^[34](#Ch05.xhtml#fn5_34){#Ch05.xhtml#bck_fn5_34}^ Accomplishing this goal, he states, is not an easy task. It is not a multimedia, GUI or interface problem. Nor is it a matter of symmetry---that is, making computers more human-like or turning them into "autonomous agents that take on our goals."^[35](#Ch05.xhtml#fn5_35){#Ch05.xhtml#bck_fn5_35}^ Hence his question: "Why should a computer be anything like a human being."^[36](#Ch05.xhtml#fn5_36){#Ch05.xhtml#bck_fn5_36}^ Rather, the challenge for Weiser is "drawing computers out of their electronic shells" and to better integrate them "into human activities, since humans are of and in the everyday world."^[37](#Ch05.xhtml#fn5_37){#Ch05.xhtml#bck_fn5_37}^ In other words, computers are not isolated things, singular or individual entities that pre-exist their relations with humans, or autonomous agents that act alone; instead, computers are made by humans and exist in the physical world. Therefore, they should invisibly enhance, rather than simulate, or isolate us from the world. In this way, the computer, albeit invisible, is positioned by Weiser as entangled with its human user in the foundational papers of ubicomp.

While advocating for what he truly believed was a better form of HCI, the relationship between the human and the machine that Weiser's shift in computing subtly hints at is false. Despite his best efforts, I suggest that Weiser is positioning the relationship between the human and technology, via notions of invisibility, as fixed and static rather than entangled, and as such the user, in his theory, becomes pliable rather than open to change. In doing this, Weiser's theory of ubicomp creates boundaries and separations between the user, ubiquitous technology, and other subjects and objects. Like the computer itself, any notion of relation between the human and the machine, in Weiser's shift in computing, fades into the background and disappears, only to be replaced, in more recent texts on ubicomp, with the same notions he was advocating against: simulation (of the users' movements by the machine) and symmetry (between the human and the machine).^[38](#Ch05.xhtml#fn5_38){#Ch05.xhtml#bck_fn5_38}^

Weiser's proposed shift in computing and its problems raise questions specifically pertaining to ubiquitous interfaces and interactive new media installations. How does the relationship between the human and the machine detailed above manifest itself in interactive new media installations? What version or vision of ubicomp and the interface do these positionings of the relationship between the human and the machine present and promote? Do interactive installations provide the viewer/participant with any means of intervention into these positionings?

To begin to answer these questions, we might consider David Rokeby's interactive new media installation [Hand-Held]{.italic} (2012). [Hand-Held]{.italic} consists of two projectors and a Kinect depth sensor.^[39](#Ch05.xhtml#fn5_39){#Ch05.xhtml#bck_fn5_39}^ When the viewer/participant walks into the installation and holds out her hands, the piece is activated. Once activated, the space is filled with 80 layers of three-dimensional images of everyday objects.^[40](#Ch05.xhtml#fn5_40){#Ch05.xhtml#bck_fn5_40}^ Not all of the images contained in these layers are perceptible---some float, suspended []{#Ch05.xhtml#page_112 .pagebreak title="112"}in space, unseen until the viewer/participant interacts with them. The exact images the viewer/participant receives upon interaction, according to Rokeby, are dependent on the height of her hands.^[41](#Ch05.xhtml#fn5_41){#Ch05.xhtml#bck_fn5_41}^ For example, if the viewer/participant holds her hands at waist level, a field of images containing objects like coins or paper money emerges. If she holds her hands at eye level, a field of images containing objects like apples or mobile phones appear. The quality of the images received is dependent on the viewer/participant's location. The closer she is to the center of the installation, the more in focus the images are; the farther away she is, the blurrier they are.^[42](#Ch05.xhtml#fn5_42){#Ch05.xhtml#bck_fn5_42}^ If the viewer/participant moves her hands directly through an object, cross-sections of the interior of that object materialize. The objects are held in a set of disembodied virtual hands and they appear, upon interaction, in the viewer/participant's physical hands. As the viewer/participant moves her hands through the various layers of the installation, the disembodied hands "touch" her. They pass objects between and interact with her, thus making, as Rokeby argues, "the invisible communications through which we increasingly convey information, conduct transactions and relate to each other" visible.^[43](#Ch05.xhtml#fn5_43){#Ch05.xhtml#bck_fn5_43}^ Since the viewer/participant must move her hands in order to view the images and since the virtual hands must "pass" the viewer/participant objects in order for the underlying meaning of the piece to be revealed, the hands (both virtual and physical) become the interface in this installation. The virtual and physical hands have an interfacial significance because they help create and form relationships, and facilitate communication between entities. Instead of depicting these relationships in full, Rokeby has visually reduced them to a series of iconographic symbols. Here he is re-appropriating the imagery and, to an extent, the language of digital capitalism---the images look like apps located on mobile devices and the viewer/participant must "touch" the objects with her fingers in a similar manner to the way she would touch apps on a phone, to open and view them. In doing this, Rokeby provides the viewer/participant with a specific context to interact in (digital capitalism), and thus he offers specific possibilities for viewer/participant intervention into thinking about ubiquitous technologies (disruption, resistance, disturbance, destabilization).

Stern discusses how viewer/participant intervention in the rhetoric of "digitally-enhanced capitalism" occurs and the opportunities for re-evaluation and resistance (of and to narratives or objects) that it affords.^[44](#Ch05.xhtml#fn5_44){#Ch05.xhtml#bck_fn5_44}^ Drawing on Milla Tiainen and Jussi Parikka's (2012) theorization of choreographer Tero Sararinen's dance piece [Hunt]{.italic} (2002), Stern argues that living bodies, like that of the viewer/participant, "continuously connect, perceive and act with a difference."^[45](#Ch05.xhtml#fn5_45){#Ch05.xhtml#bck_fn5_45}^ Given this, he states, "we must recognize their variability as a political existence for both exploitation \[by corporations\] and resistance \[to this exploitation\]."^[46](#Ch05.xhtml#fn5_46){#Ch05.xhtml#bck_fn5_46}^ Stern continues, stating that when corporations advertise technology, they "no longer need to recognize 'particular target groups' in that they can tap into the 'sensation of an excess of possible meanings with respect to a given image/product.'"^[47](#Ch05.xhtml#fn5_47){#Ch05.xhtml#bck_fn5_47}^ So, rather than selling an actual product or marketing it toward a specific demographic, advertisers can sell an "abstract idea of fulfilled desire through their product."^[48](#Ch05.xhtml#fn5_48){#Ch05.xhtml#bck_fn5_48}^ Couple this power (the supposed fulfillment of our every desire that advertisers purport their product will bring about), he writes, "with the supposed infinite choice of interactivity, and credit card details will be very forthcoming."^[49](#Ch05.xhtml#fn5_49){#Ch05.xhtml#bck_fn5_49}^ Interactive new media installations, he goes on to state, can "speak back to such exploitation" because they remind us of the human body's power and resistance to the dominant market's regime.^[50](#Ch05.xhtml#fn5_50){#Ch05.xhtml#bck_fn5_50}^

![figs5_2and5_3.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/KSOeNXv.jpeg)

Following on from Stern, I argue that while the images located in [Hand-Held]{.italic} may be representative of digital capitalism (in the sense that they look like apps on mobile devices), the experience the viewer/participant has with them signifies something different: resistance, on behalf of the viewer/participant, via her physical presence in the installation, to the invisible and sometimes inaccessible relationships between entities (bodies, technologies, spaces, images, and more) that ubicomp promotes. In this way, my designation of the virtual and physical hands as interface takes on a dual significance: the hands perform interfacial functions (they facilitate communication []{#Ch05.xhtml#page_114 .pagebreak title="114"}and interaction), but they also act as an intervention into the dominant discourses of ubicomp---specifically notions of invisibility and inaccessibility.

We are surrounded by ubiquitous interfaces (closed-circuit cameras, biometric and video-surveillance technologies, geolocation devices) that constantly monitor, collect, and share information about us and our interactions with each other. Like the images in [Hand-Held,]{.italic} this information is invisible or unreadable to us without the right device or digital access code. In the case of [Hand-Held,]{.italic} the right device is the viewer/participant's hands; in the case of commercial ubiquitous devices, it is a key code to which only the manufacturer has access.^[51](#Ch05.xhtml#fn5_51){#Ch05.xhtml#bck_fn5_51}^ Unlike commercial ubiquitous devices, the objects in [Hand-Held]{.italic} contain a degree of ambiguity---they move in and out of focus, their relationship to each other is confusing and often contradictory. Rather than minimizing the complexity of these relationships, stabilizing and then standardizing their meanings (as ubicomp technologies often do), the objects revealed to the viewer/participant (as well as their underlying meanings and connections to each other) are left undetermined---open to re-interpretation by the viewer/participant.

The amount of agency and ambiguity that the images and interfaces may hold, and the exact type of intervention that the viewer/participant can make in [Hand-Held]{.italic} is limited by the cultural and institutional organization that hosts it, the viewer/participant who experiences the work, the artists, theories, and theorists that create, frame, and interpret these experiences, and the technical capabilities of the artwork. Moreover, viewer/participant intervention in [Hand-Held]{.italic} may have multiple targets (a company, an individual, a slogan, a philosophy), so it may not offer a solution, let alone resistance to anything. What viewer/participant intervention does, I argue, is begin to provide us with a vocabulary for critically re-evaluating discourses about ubiquitous interfaces---one that I believe starts with a rethinking of Weiser's proposed "shift" in computing and the notions of invisibility and inaccessibility that accompany it.

## [[A Restructuring of Interfaces]{.bold}](#content.xhtml#bck_sec5_3) {#Ch05.xhtml#sec5_3}

I will refer to the shift in computing that Weiser outlines in the foundational papers as a restructuring of interfaces. I refer to this shift as such in order to highlight what I see as an unresolved difficulty in the aforementioned texts on ubicomp that conflate linear and progressive notions of technological evolution (the movement, in a straight line from a, to b, to c) with the open-ended and hybrid nature of the relationship between the human and technology. Furthermore, I believe the phrase "restructuring of interfaces" is important to use when referring to the digital interface in ubicomp contexts, simply because it allows me to begin to counteract claims made around the invisibility and disappearance of interfaces, and the notions of inaccessibility that accompany the disappearance of interfaces. The phrase "restructuring of interfaces" counteracts these claims by drawing attention to the interface and the processes and entities that contribute to its being instead of allowing them to disappear behind, or become black-boxed into, some mythical linear "shift" in computing. Rather than disappear, I suggest that the form that the digital interface takes in ubicomp has been restructured both physically and theoretically.

For example, the digital interface in a ubicomp context has physically shrunk in size and become embedded into the environment, where it is locked down via various black-boxing techniques. Thus, the interface has been physically restructured---it has become both [imperceptible]{.italic} and [inaccessible]{.italic} to the user. The imperceptibility of the []{#Ch05.xhtml#page_115 .pagebreak title="115"}digital interface is conflated with and then referred to as invisibility or seamlessness in some texts on ubicomp in order to reposition relationships between humans and computers, and information and technology. Thus, the interface has been theoretically restructured---everything about it, other than a conversation around its technical functions, has disappeared, to an extent, from discourses on ubicomp. The fact that the imperceptibility of the interface is conflated with invisibility, and therefore disappearance, is troubling because the word "invisibility" is misleading. Invisibility, I argue, is deployed not only to make hardware disappear; it is employed to make aesthetic information subordinate to the computational processes that allow the interface to run. The word "invisibility" is also used to justify Weiser's "shift" in computing. My argument is consistent with those made by Adam Greenfield (2006) and Emerson (2014).

Greenfield argues that the claims made by the computing industry and computer scientists around the invisibility of the interface (which he refers to as "the discourse of seamlessness") are of grave concern because they deprive "the user of meaningful participation in the decisions that affect his or her experience."^[52](#Ch05.xhtml#fn5_52){#Ch05.xhtml#bck_fn5_52}^ These discourses do this, he posits, by placing value on interfaces that recede from view and then embedding them into the environment, forcing the user to "inadvertently, unknowingly or even unwillingly" interact with them.^[53](#Ch05.xhtml#fn5_53){#Ch05.xhtml#bck_fn5_53}^ Greenfield continues, stating that by valuing seamlessness over visibility, scholars in the computer science, engineering, and to an extent the humanities fields are homogenizing the deeply heterogeneous infrastructure of interfaces and our experiences with them. This homogenization occurs, he says, because "without seams ... it's hard to tell where one thing ends and something else begins---points of difference and distinction tend to be smoothed over or flattened out."^[54](#Ch05.xhtml#fn5_54){#Ch05.xhtml#bck_fn5_54}^ In short, Greenfield is arguing that discourses describing seamless interfaces are inherently flawed. The rhetoric is dishonest (it claims ubiquitous interfaces are simple and easy to use when in fact they are complex and often inoperable) and paternalistic in nature (it dictates, to an extent, what [will]{.italic} happen when users interact with technology instead of allowing them a choice). Furthermore, Greenfield believes, by placing value on notions of seamlessness, the rhetoric around ubicomp is simplifying and then standardizing deeply complex human and non-human processes.^[55](#Ch05.xhtml#fn5_55){#Ch05.xhtml#bck_fn5_55}^

Emerson echoes Greenfield's concerns, applying them directly to the use of ubiquitous interfaces in humanities contexts. To summarize her argument, Emerson suggests that the word "invisibility" when used in a ubicomp context, and then applied to the interface, is disingenuous.^[56](#Ch05.xhtml#fn5_56){#Ch05.xhtml#bck_fn5_56}^ Users, she argues, are told by those working in the computing industry that the invisibility of the interface is a good thing because invisibility denotes accessibility to information that did not exist in previous modes of HCI.^[57](#Ch05.xhtml#fn5_57){#Ch05.xhtml#bck_fn5_57}^ Moreover, words like "invisibility," Emerson states, are deployed to make users believe that interfaces have "successfully bridged the gap between the human and the computer" and that "the boundary between human and information is eradicated" because the interface they are using "just works."^[58](#Ch05.xhtml#fn5_58){#Ch05.xhtml#bck_fn5_58}^

These claims of eradication, like the term "invisibility," she writes, are a myth that the computing industry "rides on as it attempts to convince us that the dream \[that the boundary between human and information is eradicated, the gap between the human and the computer is closed\] is now reality through sophisticated sleights of hand that take place at the level of the interface."^[59](#Ch05.xhtml#fn5_59){#Ch05.xhtml#bck_fn5_59}^ Contrary to what the computing industry would like us to believe, the boundary between the human and information has not been eradicated, and the gap between the biological and the technological has not []{#Ch05.xhtml#page_116 .pagebreak title="116"}been closed. Nor do users, as Emerson states, have more access to information than they did before, and computers are not more "natural" because we can touch their screens with our fingers.^[60](#Ch05.xhtml#fn5_60){#Ch05.xhtml#bck_fn5_60}^ The boundaries and gaps between human and information, and the human and the computer, according to Emerson, have only been widened, and more have been created, through notions of invisibility.^[61](#Ch05.xhtml#fn5_61){#Ch05.xhtml#bck_fn5_61}^

I agree with Emerson and Greenfield's critiques of ubicomp. Echoing and then augmenting their critiques slightly, I argue that the word "invisibility," when deployed in the context of interactive new media installations and then applied to the digital interface, not only widens the boundary between the human and information, and the human and the computer, but the word invisibility also denotes finality. And I believe it is this notion of finality that we should be most concerned with, as finality, in a ubicomp context, implies, among other things, inevitability.

While digital interfaces, like most biological and technological entities, have a lifespan, the notion of finality as it is presented to us in texts on ubicomp is of grave concern. It is concerning because it suggests that invisibility is the material and theoretical end-point (for the user, not the designer) in the development of the ubiquitous interface. It implies that there is only [one]{.italic} final, definitive or "good" version of the ubiquitous interface---the closed, restrictive, and pre-determined one---and that no major improvements need to be made to its design, just minor tweaks or upgrades. In short, by suggesting finality, we are told that invisibility is compulsory---invisible technology will be everywhere and everybody will be using them, so we have no choice but to interact with them unless, of course, we have something to hide.

Furthermore, the notion of finality inscribes ubiquitous interfaces into what Sarah Kember and Joanna Zylinska (2012) call a "progressive developmental narrative" of media and technology.^[62](#Ch05.xhtml#fn5_62){#Ch05.xhtml#bck_fn5_62}^ By "progressive developmental narrative" of media and technology, Kember and Zylinska are referring to claims made that media technologies are said to evolve, or progress, in a straight line.^[63](#Ch05.xhtml#fn5_63){#Ch05.xhtml#bck_fn5_63}^ When applied to the interface in interactive new media installations, this evolution entails the progression from technical instrument, to symbolic screen, to abstract invisible organism, as detailed in [Chapter 1](#Ch01.xhtml).

Kember and Zylinska employ the phrase "progressive developmental narrative" in reference to commentaries on emerging media created by those in the media and computing sectors.^[64](#Ch05.xhtml#fn5_64){#Ch05.xhtml#bck_fn5_64}^ These commentaries, they state, perpetuate, among other things, false divisions and binary and oppositional thinking (old vs. new, subject vs. object, virtual vs. material).^[65](#Ch05.xhtml#fn5_65){#Ch05.xhtml#bck_fn5_65}^ Similar sentiments around linear thinking to those made above, they tell us, inform academic arguments around media and technology.^[66](#Ch05.xhtml#fn5_66){#Ch05.xhtml#bck_fn5_66}^ Therefore, the aforementioned "progressive developmental narrative" is not only "restricted to [feelings about]{.italic} new media: it also structures many [ontological conceptualizations of]{.italic} them."^[67](#Ch05.xhtml#fn5_67){#Ch05.xhtml#bck_fn5_67}^ For Kember and Zylinska, this narrative and the commentaries on emerging media that it perpetuates are troubling for a number of reasons, most importantly because they "introduce the question of time into debates on media while simultaneously freezing this question by immediately dividing media time into a series of discrete spatialized objects, or products that succeed one another."^[68](#Ch05.xhtml#fn5_68){#Ch05.xhtml#bck_fn5_68}^

The trajectory of progressive media development narratives, as detailed by Kember and Zylinska above, is evidenced in Weiser's writings on ubicomp and has consequently been projected onto ubiquitous interfaces in interactive new media art installations. For instance, ubicomp is, as Weiser states, a "next generation computing environment in which each person is continually interacting with hundreds of nearby []{#Ch05.xhtml#page_117 .pagebreak title="117"}wirelessly interconnected computers."^[69](#Ch05.xhtml#fn5_69){#Ch05.xhtml#bck_fn5_69}^ Technology in this environment will require "radically new kinds of computers of all sizes and shapes to be available to each person."^[70](#Ch05.xhtml#fn5_70){#Ch05.xhtml#bck_fn5_70}^ Here Weiser is stating in very simple terms that in order for ubicomp environments to succeed, we must radically change the way we think about and interact with interfaces, as well as the actual interface itself. For an interface to become a ubiquitous interface, according to Weiser, it must be different from its predecessor, it must be "new." However, stating, as Weiser does, that for ubicomp to work, the interface needs to be "newer," and thus better, than its predecessor implies some difficulties in relation to my theorization of the digital interface in interactive new media installations as an ongoing and dynamic process, as it suggests some sort of ontological end to the digital interface. Furthermore, it suggests that "newness" is the totality of all the interfaces created, as well as all the written texts related to its use. In this way, Weiser's theory of ubicomp not only promotes chronological narratives of new media, but also suggests that a linear change in technology (the move from desktop to ubiquitous computing) will cause a (positive and progressive) change in culture and society.

## [[Re-opening the Question of the Interface: Linear Timelines and Finality]{.bold}](#content.xhtml#bck_sec5_4) {#Ch05.xhtml#sec5_4}

In what follows, I will discuss the linear timelines and progressive narratives that theories around ubicomp promote, via the notion of finality, through an analysis of the use of the ubiquitous interface in Scott Snibbe's interactive new media installation [Deep Walls]{.italic} (2002). [Deep Walls]{.italic} has been called a social cinematic space produced by a creative community, a new and improved way for a new media artist to engage viewers, and a demonstration of exciting interactive technologies that will positively affect the way in which art is made and experienced in the future.^[71](#Ch05.xhtml#fn5_71){#Ch05.xhtml#bck_fn5_71}^ I agree with some of the conclusions offered above, but my analysis veers from the interpretations of this artwork that position the relationship between the viewer/participant and the ubiquitous interface as linear and stable, and the interaction occurring with it as isolated and determined. I veer from these interpretations because they are inadvertently perpetuating the chronological and deterministic narratives of new media discussed above. This perpetuation is concerning, as these narratives tend to leave things out that do not fit into the story that critics or theorists are trying to tell. In doing this, they foreclose on possibilities for different interpretations, and inevitably erase the subjects, processes, and entities that contribute, and thus matter, to the interface and interactive new media installations.

I suggest that [Deep Walls]{.italic} could be seen as a way to intervene in the linear and progressive narratives of new media that ubicomp promotes and the consequent deterministic, cause-and-effect interpretations of technology they bring about. [Deep Walls]{.italic} does this by presenting the viewer/participant with "a projected cabinet of cinematic memories"---one that requires her to interact with multiple timelines (past, present, and future) at once.^[72](#Ch05.xhtml#fn5_72){#Ch05.xhtml#bck_fn5_72}^ By asking the viewer/participant to act in terms of the past and future rather than the present, I argue that [Deep Walls]{.italic} has the potential to disrupt linear and progressive narratives of technology by allowing the viewer/participant to intervene in them and create different ones. In this way, [Deep Walls]{.italic} provides us with a way to counter notions of finality, linear progression, newness, and change by reopening the question of the interface.

[]{#Ch05.xhtml#page_118 .pagebreak title="118"}[Deep Walls]{.italic} consists of a computer, a closed-circuit camera, and an enlarged rectangular projection screen (the main screen), which is divided into 16 smaller projection screens (the smaller screens).^[73](#Ch05.xhtml#fn5_73){#Ch05.xhtml#bck_fn5_73}^ The closed-circuit camera records the actions of the viewer/participant moving in front of it. The recorded performance is then transmitted to a computer located in the same space, where it is processed, generating a shadow of the viewer/participant that is projected onto the main screen. Each of the smaller screens contains pre-recorded performances of previous viewer/participants. These performances are looped and then repeated until a newer recording is available to take its place.^[74](#Ch05.xhtml#fn5_74){#Ch05.xhtml#bck_fn5_74}^ When a viewer/participant stands in front of the main screen and moves, a shadow mimicking her actions appears. The shadow lacks any physical detail other than size and shape, and is controlled by the viewer/participant. Thus, it is the shadow that becomes the digital interface. The shadow overlaps and sometimes obscures some of the action occurring in the smaller screens. The performance that [Deep Walls]{.italic}' loop of action creates, combined with the fact that there are no other on-screen images for the viewer/participant to control, means that the shadow becomes the initial focus of her attention.

After interacting with the work for a short period of time, the viewer/participant's initial fascination with her shadow wears off and she begins to focus on the pre-recorded actions occurring within the 16 squares. The action occurring in the smaller screens provides her with, among other things, instruction. It becomes a visual manual for how she should move in the installation. For example, if the viewer/participant notices that the shadow in one of the squares raises its arm, she may mimic this action by raising her arm. Conversely, this movement could be interpreted as a message (from the artist, from somebody else) to stop moving, causing the viewer/participant to cease her actions and leave the installation.

![fig5_4.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/5bS8FDH.jpeg)

![fig5_5.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/9012S7t.jpeg)

Based on my personal experience with [Deep Walls]{.italic}, the content of the projected performances located in the smaller screens seemed to suggest that interaction with the piece is seen by the current viewer/participant as a visual message, left by past viewer/participants, for future ones to view or interact with. For example, when interacting with the work in 2005 at Art Interactive in Boston, MA, I discovered a previously recorded performance located in one of the small screens where a shadow addressed the audience directly by waving its hands. I also watched performers address each other (two shadows located in parallel squares got into a fight).

[Deep Walls]{.italic} not only required me to interact with the other entities who are presently located in the same space, but the addition of the performances in the smaller screens enabled me to interact with the installation in terms of the past (with or against pre-recorded images), the present (with others located in the same space at the same time), and the future (recording a performance in order to communicate with somebody in the future, or thinking about my actions in terms of their deletion and replacement). My experience with the work is echoed in both Stern's (2013) and Simanowski's (2011) analysis. Even though users, Simanowski argues, "do not have specific addresses in mind, the movies generated suggest that users understand this interactive installation as an arena where they can stage filmic messages for subsequent users."^[75](#Ch05.xhtml#fn5_75){#Ch05.xhtml#bck_fn5_75}^ The visual messages that current users leave for future ones, Stern suggests, are "artifacts of the past, of those who have passed through the space, the shadows are a part of our present, and our presence as we engage with them again."^[76](#Ch05.xhtml#fn5_76){#Ch05.xhtml#bck_fn5_76}^

Based on these three interpretations, I argue that [Deep Walls]{.italic} can be theorized in terms of Marshall McLuhan's (1962) notion of "all-at-onceness"; that is, a []{#Ch05.xhtml#page_120 .pagebreak title="120"}rejection of thinking of technology as a series of orderly, determined, and linear progressive developments, and a move toward an emphasis on the interconnectedness between, and extension and expansion (rather than isolation or invisibility) of, the human and their interactions with technology.^[77](#Ch05.xhtml#fn5_77){#Ch05.xhtml#bck_fn5_77}^ A McLuhanite emphasis on technology as an extension of man is important to my conceptualization of the ubiquitous interface because it enables me to counter notions of finality, progression, and newness that ubicomp theories promote. Thus, it enables me to suggest that the relationship between computation, the interface, and aesthetics is a dynamic, temporal, and performative unfolding rather than a purely instructional or representational event.

On this point, Kember and Zylinska write that the McLuhanite notion of "allat-onceness" poses a challenge to "many forms of conventional media analysis---in which problems such as technology, use, organization and production are frequently studied in isolation."^[78](#Ch05.xhtml#fn5_78){#Ch05.xhtml#bck_fn5_78}^ It poses a challenge, they state, because: "It is not simply the case that 'we'---that is, autonomously existing humans---live in a complex technological environment that we can manage, control and use. Rather we are---physically and hence ontologically---part of that technological environment."^[79](#Ch05.xhtml#fn5_79){#Ch05.xhtml#bck_fn5_79}^ Thus, they conclude: "If we take this process of technological extension seriously enough---not just on the level of theoretical argument, but also through our experiential being with technologies and media ... we are obliged to recognize that we human users of technology are not entirely distinct from our tools."^[80](#Ch05.xhtml#fn5_80){#Ch05.xhtml#bck_fn5_80}^

If we take this to be the case, then [Deep Walls]{.italic} is more than a demonstration of exciting ubiquitous technologies that will positively or negatively affect the way in which art is made and experienced in the future. By allowing the viewer/participant to intervene in, and disrupt via creative play, the progressive narratives of new media, [Deep Walls]{.italic} lets her create, to an extent, different, non-linear narratives. In this way, [Deep Walls]{.italic} becomes a liminal space. By liminal space, I mean that the installation becomes an area of social exploration, enabling the viewer/participant to separate, for a temporary period of time, the human and non-human entities that congregate there, only to mix them back together again through acts of unconscious and conscious questioning. [Deep Walls]{.italic} becomes an area where the narratives and myths that theories of ubicomp promotes can be explored, critically questioned, redefined, repositioned, and reconfigured by the viewer/participant(s) participating in it.

## [[In Conclusion]{.bold}](#content.xhtml#bck_sec5_5) {#Ch05.xhtml#sec5_5}

In this chapter, I explored the use of the ubiquitous interface in interactive new media installations through a critique of the foundational papers of ubiquitous computing. These papers, I argued, helped create the possibility of ubiquitous interfaces and exposed their limits. However, in order to more fully understand the potential that ubiquitous interfaces may hold, I must not only examine what made the emergence of ubicomp possible and the motives behind it. I must also explore how these theories manifest themselves in contemporary uses of the ubiquitous interface.

For example, like most popular computer science-based concepts proposed in the past decade (virtual reality, Artificial Intelligence, machine learning), ubicomp, or, []{#Ch05.xhtml#page_121 .pagebreak title="121"}more precisely, the people who produce and promote ubiquitous interfaces and the theories around them, make claims and promises that these devices do not, cannot, or in certain cases will never be able to deliver. These include, but are not limited to, evoking a state of calm, improving our lives, or simply making them easier. Thus, as Ulrik Ekman (2011) argues, "ubiquity and ubicomp remain potentialities of whose actualization we are not yet sure."^[81](#Ch05.xhtml#fn5_81){#Ch05.xhtml#bck_fn5_81}^

In the next chapter, I focus on how these newer texts echo the techno-determinist assumptions embedded in the foundational papers about how ubicomp-related devices, as Emerson states, [will]{.italic} be deployed everywhere in the future" and how this imagined deployment implies, to an extent, the inadequacy of traditional interfaces.^[82](#Ch05.xhtml#fn5_82){#Ch05.xhtml#bck_fn5_82}^ I draw on Emerson's theorization of ubicomp in the following chapter, but offer an approach and framework that extends beyond a critique of techno-deterministic imaginings of disappearing technology and marketing rhetoric (although I do critically examine them). I argue that the word "invisible," when applied to the interface in interactive new media installations, not only represents the commodification of bodies and things, but also represents erasure. In particular, I refer to the erasure of the multiple agencies that contribute to and help shape the interface and the relationships between them---relationships between human individuals and relationships between non-human actors, like the ubiquitous interface and the aesthetic, algorithmic and technical processes that allow it to work.

# [[6 []{#Ch06.xhtml#page_125 .pagebreak title="125"}The Ubiquitous Interface: Part II]{.bold}](#content.xhtml#bck_Ch06) {#Ch06.xhtml#Ch06}

In the previous chapter, I introduced the concept of ubiquitous computing (ubicomp) through an examination of the foundational papers, as detailed by Mark Weiser (1988--96). I described ubicomp as the seamless integration of computerized technology into every place, object, building, and body. While readily evident in subway passes and cell phones, ubicomp is more than software or hardware embedded in a physical object; rather, it consists of a networked series of interfaces that are meant to invisibly pervade all levels and layers of an object, body, or environment. The ultimate aim is to create spaces that are completely saturated with technology.

In the past decade, considerable effort has gone into realizing Weiser's vision of ubicomp, including, but not limited to, the development of ubiquitous frameworks, interfaces, and infrastructures. As advanced and impressive as these endeavors have been, there remains, as Yvonne Rogers (2006) states, "an enormous gap between the dream of comfortable, informed and effortless living \[as proposed in Weiser's papers\] and the accomplishments of Ubicomp research."^[1](#Ch06.xhtml#fn6_1){#Ch06.xhtml#bck_fn6_1}^ This gap exists, Rogers argues, because ubicomp involves, among other things, "solving very hard artificial intelligence problems" such as harnessing the huge variability around human motivation and intention, as well as the fluidity of social contexts.^[2](#Ch06.xhtml#fn6_2){#Ch06.xhtml#bck_fn6_2}^ So, while it has been possible to develop a range of simple ubicomp systems that can remind us of events or recommend products, it is, she writes, "proving to be much more difficult to build truly smart systems that can understand or accurately model people's behaviors, moods and intentions."^[3](#Ch06.xhtml#fn6_3){#Ch06.xhtml#bck_fn6_3}^ Difficulty occurs because there exists, as Paul Dourish and Genevieve Bell (2011) argue, a multitude of complex interactions "between space, technology, culture and experience."^[4](#Ch06.xhtml#fn6_4){#Ch06.xhtml#bck_fn6_4}^ The spaces in which ubiquitous technologies are being deployed and the interactions that they enable "are neither stable, uniform, nor given."^[5](#Ch06.xhtml#fn6_5){#Ch06.xhtml#bck_fn6_5}^ Ubiquitous technology, they continue, "can destabilize and transform" these interactions and mediate space, but they "will only ever be one part of the mix."^[6](#Ch06.xhtml#fn6_6){#Ch06.xhtml#bck_fn6_6}^ Dourish and Bell state that this is because ubicomp was "from the outset, a proposal not for how technology should [be]{.italic} but instead how it should be [experienced]{.italic}."^[7](#Ch06.xhtml#fn6_7){#Ch06.xhtml#bck_fn6_7}^

For this reason, I now look deeper into the concept of ubicomp through a close reading of more contemporary theories on the topic. I do this not because of their concreteness (i.e. to examine the objects that contemporary theories of ubicomp produce), but to explore the stories around the relationship between the human and technology that they tell. In this chapter, I argue that the relationship between computation, aesthetics, and the interface should be understood as an interwoven and multifaceted process that questions the ways in which ubiquitous interfaces are theorized and deployed in everyday environments. It is a process that looks toward interactive []{#Ch06.xhtml#page_126 .pagebreak title="126"}new media installations not as a mode of opposition, but as a mode of intervention; a way to critically question commonly held assumptions about the ubiquitous interface, and to call attention to, and then dispel, myths and claims of ubicomp such as invisibility, neutrality, and naturalness.

The address of this book, as mentioned in the Introduction, is not to commercial technological devices, but to principles of aesthetics and human--machine phenomenology. Given this, the focus of this chapter, like the previous one, is on the use of the ubiquitous interface in contemporary interactive new media art installations. Contemporary ubiquitous technologies are, of course, present beyond new media art, but interactive installations are a good entry point to look at such systems, as they construct situations and then ask us to participate---to physically perform---in and with technology. Thus, they afford us a chance to critically experience and re-examine our relationship to technology. Interactive new media installations draw on and remediate cinematic and other art historical practices and traditions---specifically those of technological experimentation, creative collaboration, performativity, and audience participation. Therefore, they provide us with strategies---with a means to undermine the claims of invisibility and neutrality that ubicomp promotes. In direct relation to ubicomp, interactive new media installations do this by intervening in, through mimicry, resistance, opposition, and/or outright rejection, the same regulatory principles and claims that those producing and marketing ubiquitous interfaces employ for commercial gain.

For example, Brian Massumi (2011) states: "the regulatory principles of the technical process \[of the technological object\] in the narrow sense are utility and salability, profit-generating ability. Art claims the right to have no manifest utility, no use-value, and in many cases even no exchange value. At its best, it has [event-value]{.italic}."^[8](#Ch06.xhtml#fn6_8){#Ch06.xhtml#bck_fn6_8}^ By event-value, Massumi is referring to the fact that interactive art is experiential and exploratory, unbound and unsubordinated by and to external finalities. It is precisely this "event-value," he argues, that allows interactive art to intervene in previously posited modes of thinking and begin to reframe them.^[9](#Ch06.xhtml#fn6_9){#Ch06.xhtml#bck_fn6_9}^ Interactive art, he writes, "can push further to the indeterminate but relationally potentialized fringes of existing situations, beyond the limits of current framings or regulatory principles."^[10](#Ch06.xhtml#fn6_10){#Ch06.xhtml#bck_fn6_10}^ Given this, notions of experimentation, collaboration, performativity, and participation embedded in new media art's history become important to any study of ubiquitous technology, because the aesthetic practices that underpin it have the potential to create encounters between entities and facilitate creative action on behalf of the viewer/participant. In doing this, interactive new media installations can reposition the instrumental and invisible ubiquitous interface into a creative and visible technology, bringing the role of the artistic and the aesthetic to the fore. To think about the use of the ubiquitous interface in interactive new media art installations, then, is to acknowledge the role, both positive and negative, that artistic experimentation has played, and still is playing, in the development of new technologies.

Intervention, of course, has its limitations. One of these limitations is that it can inadvertently reinforce that in which it seeks to intervene. In this chapter, intervention is seen as creative experimentation, by new media artists, with ubiquitous interfaces in interactive new media installations. The "thing" that artists are trying to intervene in is, among other things, the commodification of aesthetic content and innovation by the technology industries. The notion of intervention and the limitations that surround it will be discussed in full, but to summarize: new media arts practitioners []{#Ch06.xhtml#page_127 .pagebreak title="127"}working in the 1990s played (and are still playing) a key role in the development of new technologies---specifically, ubiquitous interfaces.^[11](#Ch06.xhtml#fn6_11){#Ch06.xhtml#bck_fn6_11}^ Driven by "the traditions of open intellectual inquiry and interdisciplinarity in the arts and by the previous thirty years of 'art and technology' practice," the underlying goal of some artists developing these technologies, Simon Penny (2013) writes, was to critically question and intervene in the popular rhetoric of the time (Cyberculture, Virtuality).^[12](#Ch06.xhtml#fn6_12){#Ch06.xhtml#bck_fn6_12}^

Nurtured in environments that rewarded aesthetic experimentation, creative risk taking and radical intervention the ubiquitous interfaces created for interactive new media installations in the 1990s have been repurposed, turned into commercial devices that now dominate the twenty-first century. Stripped of their aesthetic functions, some of these technologies have been co-opted by large conglomerates. They have been sanitized and instrumentalized, sold back to us as serialized products that will "expand your creativity" and/or "change the way you use technology forever."^[13](#Ch06.xhtml#fn6_13){#Ch06.xhtml#bck_fn6_13}^ The commodification of aesthetic content raises questions around artistic experimentation by new media artists in interactive new media installations. I will address these questions by critically examining the use of ubiquitous interfaces in interactive new media installations, positioning them as mediums through which notions of creativity and aesthetic content become commodified, asking whether artistic experimentation with ubicomp technology is actually the instrument of intervention that artists developing ubiquitous interfaces like Penny see it as, or more of a continuity of the same. A key point of this chapter is that aesthetic experimentations with ubiquitous systems not only affect the interfaces used in art, but also influence those developed elsewhere. Interactive new media installations critically evaluate the principal claims and question the foundations on which the concept of ubicomp is based. Thus, they offer an important and much-needed critical perspective on ubiquitous technologies---one that seeks to challenge the hegemony of ubicomp theories by intervening in normative assumptions concerning the interface.

## [[The Instrumentalization and Commodification of the Ubiquitous Interface]{.bold}](#content.xhtml#bck_sec6_1) {#Ch06.xhtml#sec6_1}

The digital interface in interactive new media installations is a threshold; an open-ended and generative process that consists of multiple, co-constitutive agencies. What an interface should do, Lori Emerson (2014) states, is "grant access, \[but\] it also inevitably acts as a kind of magician's cape, continually revealing (mediatic layers, bits of information, etc.) through concealing and concealing as it reveals."^[14](#Ch06.xhtml#fn6_14){#Ch06.xhtml#bck_fn6_14}^ Ubiquitous interfaces, she writes, do the exact opposite---they obscure more information from the user than they actually reveal.^[15](#Ch06.xhtml#fn6_15){#Ch06.xhtml#bck_fn6_15}^ The obfuscation of information on behalf of interfaces, she argues, is done deliberately.^[16](#Ch06.xhtml#fn6_16){#Ch06.xhtml#bck_fn6_16}^ For instance, certain information (functions, technical make-up), she states, is purposefully hidden from the user. This concealment of information is rationalized by those in the computing industry who create and market ubiquitous interfaces "in the name of 'invisibility' and the 'user-friendly' with what's fast becoming an ideology."^[17](#Ch06.xhtml#fn6_17){#Ch06.xhtml#bck_fn6_17}^ Emerson clarifies her use of the word ideology, writing: "I use [ideology]{.italic} not merely in the sense of the adamant belief in making the computer more approachable but more in the sense that [user-friendly]{.italic} is used quite deliberately to distort reality."^[18](#Ch06.xhtml#fn6_18){#Ch06.xhtml#bck_fn6_18}^ This clarification, for Emerson, is important because the computer industry deploys the words "invisibility" and "user friendly" with the specific intention of convincing users that a very particular version of a ubiquitous []{#Ch06.xhtml#page_128 .pagebreak title="128"}interface is "inherently better."^[19](#Ch06.xhtml#fn6_19){#Ch06.xhtml#bck_fn6_19}^ Invariably, this version is one that relies on and then promotes to the point of celebration the fact that its inner workings are closed off and imperceptible to the user.

The conflation of the terms "invisibility" and "user-friendly" with "imperceptibility" is highly problematic because it alienates the user from the underlying computational processes of the device. This alienation occurs, Emerson writes, because the user is denied access to the underlying workings of the device.^[20](#Ch06.xhtml#fn6_20){#Ch06.xhtml#bck_fn6_20}^ Building on Emerson's argument and then extending it to the use of the ubiquitous interface in interactive new media installations, I suggest that the concealing or "black-boxing" of computational processes forecloses on change, consequently resulting in a very limited, and thus highly questionable, concept of ubicomp, aesthetics, and the interface. I maintain that this approach instrumentalizes the interface, turning it into a tool for consumption rather than the creation of, aesthetic, and cultural content. However, the interface has always been and, to an extent, will always be a technical device. Furthermore, interfaces have always been, up to a certain point, a commodity. If the interface has always been a highly saleable technological tool, then what exactly is the problem with the instrumentalization and commodification of the ubiquitous interface?

The problem is that some texts on ubicomp claim that the user interacts with ubiquitous technologies through "natural" interfaces (Johnson, 1997).^[21](#Ch06.xhtml#fn6_21){#Ch06.xhtml#bck_fn6_21}^ By natural interfaces, these texts are referring to the physical gestures and spoken commands that the user makes. However, these gestures are not natural, but naturalized. This point is made clearer if we briefly return to Lynn Hershman Leeson's interactive new media installation [America's Finest]{.italic} (1993--4).^[22](#Ch06.xhtml#fn6_22){#Ch06.xhtml#bck_fn6_22}^ The interface in [America's Finest]{.italic}---an M16 rifle---is programmed to recognize and reward "normal" actions that somebody would make with a rifle and ignore those located outside of the preset selection.^[23](#Ch06.xhtml#fn6_23){#Ch06.xhtml#bck_fn6_23}^ The viewer/participant can do anything she wants with the interface, but she will not see an image unless she performs the prescribed, or normal, action of the object. She must pull the trigger of the gun.

In this example, the "thing" being instrumentalized and commodified is not a technical device (the rifle, a computer) or some ephemeral quality of a human being that we deem to be valuable (creativity). Furthermore, despite the fact that the rifle is part of an artwork that has monetary worth, the rifle is not the thing that has value in this particular context, so it is not being commodified. The thing being instrumentalized and commodified is the viewer/participant and her movements. This is because the thing being rewarded in [America's Finest]{.italic} is the viewer/participant's ability to perform the prescribed actions (pull the trigger of the gun).

Given this, the instrumentalization of the digital interface is not just a question related to the commodification of a technical device or an issue of information becoming an object or a thing, but of the normalization and commodification of individual users and their behaviors. Thus, the "thing" being turned into a valuable object and subsequently sold to the highest bidder in a ubicomp context is not the interface, but the human being. This is because the human is positioned as the means of interaction, translation, and navigation in the space in which she is located. She [is]{.italic} the digital interface in these installations and is consequently described as such in the texts that surround them.

## [[]{#Ch06.xhtml#page_129 .pagebreak title="129"} ["You Are the Controller"]{.bold}](#content.xhtml#bck_sec6_2) {#Ch06.xhtml#sec6_2}

In November 2010, Microsoft revealed a new interface to the general public: the Kinect.^[24](#Ch06.xhtml#fn6_24){#Ch06.xhtml#bck_fn6_24}^ On its website, Microsoft describes the Kinect as a device that "gets everyone off the couch. Moving, laughing and cheering."^[25](#Ch06.xhtml#fn6_25){#Ch06.xhtml#bck_fn6_25}^ The Kinect consists of a webcam-style, black-boxed peripheral interface which enables users to interact with computers with their bodies rather than with a visible, hardware-based controller.^[26](#Ch06.xhtml#fn6_26){#Ch06.xhtml#bck_fn6_26}^ As Microsoft puts, it, the Kinect "brings games and entertainment to life in extraordinary new ways with no controller required. Simply step in front of the sensor and Kinect recognizes you and responds to your gestures."^[27](#Ch06.xhtml#fn6_27){#Ch06.xhtml#bck_fn6_27}^ Microsoft goes on to celebrate this device that is "inspiring," "extraordinary," "natural," and "controller-free" (the words "natural" and "controller-free" are repeated at least six times on one page).^[28](#Ch06.xhtml#fn6_28){#Ch06.xhtml#bck_fn6_28}^ Most tellingly, however, throughout its website, Microsoft explains that the Kinect "could quite conceivably pave the way for new developments in human/computer interaction," that it can "transform how people interact with technology," and that it "enables the creation of real solutions," including, but not limited to, helping users "explore their creativity."^[29](#Ch06.xhtml#fn6_29){#Ch06.xhtml#bck_fn6_29}^ This subtle reminder that ubiquitous technology has supposedly eradicated the boundary between the human and the computer by transforming how people interact with technology is echoed in Microsoft's 2009 concept announcement for Project Natal (the codename Microsoft used for the Kinect while under development) and the 2011 television ad for Xbox Kinect.^[30](#Ch06.xhtml#fn6_30){#Ch06.xhtml#bck_fn6_30}^

The 2009 concept announcement begins by reminding the viewer that the Kinect is "new" and "controller-free." We then see a teenage boy walk past a television in his living room. Located on the television is an avatar. The avatar senses the boy's presence and addresses him by name. The boy stops, turns his full attention to the television, and begins to play a video game, sans controller. As the boy moves his arms and legs, the avatar does the same. Here Microsoft is clearly positioning the human body, the boy, as interface. This is because the boy, according to Microsoft, is able to navigate the video game and engage with the visual information presented to him. In case we were not convinced, the words "You Are the Controller" appear on-screen while the boy plays.^[31](#Ch06.xhtml#fn6_31){#Ch06.xhtml#bck_fn6_31}^

Contrary to Microsoft, I argue that the boy is not the digital interface in this context; his on-screen avatar is. This is because the avatar is acting as a mediator between entities and it allows the boy to navigate, communicate, and engage with information. For, as mentioned above, when the boy moves his arms and legs, the avatar mimics him. Moreover, the Kinect, is not controller-free. Although it may seem like the boy is making the on-screen visuals appear, it is the Kinect that makes this happen. The Kinect consists of a series of webcams, microphones, motion sensors, and software.^[32](#Ch06.xhtml#fn6_32){#Ch06.xhtml#bck_fn6_32}^ This hardware and software has the ability to recognize and process a limited set of verbal and gestural commands that then appear as actions on-screen.^[33](#Ch06.xhtml#fn6_33){#Ch06.xhtml#bck_fn6_33}^ The viewer, however, is never told that this is how the Kinect works: full-body interaction just happens. The phrase "you are the controller" is repeated in various iterations ("full body scanning," "use your whole body") throughout the three-minute video in order to reinforce this point.^[34](#Ch06.xhtml#fn6_34){#Ch06.xhtml#bck_fn6_34}^ The video then cycles through all the fun things users can do with the device, briefly pausing to tell the viewer about its interesting new features---specifically the fact that it is controller-free.^[35](#Ch06.xhtml#fn6_35){#Ch06.xhtml#bck_fn6_35}^

[]{#Ch06.xhtml#page_130 .pagebreak title="130"}This is exactly where the obfuscation of information or, as Emerson calls it, "the magic" happens---through the invisible and the everyday.^[36](#Ch06.xhtml#fn6_36){#Ch06.xhtml#bck_fn6_36}^ The Kinect's minimalist outer packaging and the device's marketing rhetoric are crafted to make it look special and enticing, yet accessible and user-friendly. Microsoft does this in the hope that the user will willingly suspend disbelief and accept the impossible: that they will buy into the aforementioned claims around the naturalness and newness of the HCI Microsoft purports is occurring, regardless of her actual experience with the Kinect. The suspension of disbelief on behalf of the user, Emerson states, is akin to the way in which an audience reacts to a magic show.^[37](#Ch06.xhtml#fn6_37){#Ch06.xhtml#bck_fn6_37}^

The audience attending a magic show, Emerson writes, "wants to be amazed by feats that are seemingly impossible."^[38](#Ch06.xhtml#fn6_38){#Ch06.xhtml#bck_fn6_38}^ Their amazement, according to Emerson, depends on two key interdependent factors: "They must believe that the magician's assistant is not being sawed in half or that a dove is not actually being turned into a handkerchief, and yet they must remain in the dark (literally and figuratively) about exactly how the trick works."^[39](#Ch06.xhtml#fn6_39){#Ch06.xhtml#bck_fn6_39}^ The same logic, is at work in the Kinect. We want to be amazed by seemingly impossible feats (the eradication of the boundaries between the human and technology) and then actually do the impossible (control technology with a wave of our hand). Our amazement and consequent participation in this magical feat relies on two interrelated components: we must believe that Microsoft's claims around HCI are [not]{.italic} true (and to an extent we do, as we physically hook the Kinect up to a television or computer and interact with on-screen information via an avatar) and we must remain in the dark about how exactly the device works, and to an extent we are. Microsoft never explains how the Kinect works to the average user.^[40](#Ch06.xhtml#fn6_40){#Ch06.xhtml#bck_fn6_40}^

The 2011 television ad for the Kinect is essentially the same as the concept announcement with two modifications: the first is that the 2011 ad contains no spoken words and very few text-based elements. Unlike the 2009 announcement, Microsoft no longer feels the need to convince users that their body is the interface. The user's body [is]{.italic} the interface. In this way, the user's body is commodified, packaged up, and sold back to her for a price. The commodification of the body is reflected by the fact that the phrase "you are the controller" is no longer repeated over and over again. This phrase is now an indisputable fact, something users already know and must tacitly accept if they want to use the Kinect.

The second modification revolves around notions of creativity---notions that were seemingly non-existent in the 2009 announcement. The 2011 ad features a family putting on a digital shadow puppet show. They have made a shape of an elephant with their bodies in their living room. This shape is reflected on-screen.^[41](#Ch06.xhtml#fn6_41){#Ch06.xhtml#bck_fn6_41}^ Instead of the on-screen shape appearing on a television in a living room, it appears on a canvas in a virtual artists' studio.

The family is then allowed to get creative. If used correctly, the Kinect offers to turn the family into artists by letting them paint the shape that they created. The family does this by "throwing" grey paint on the elephant-like shape. They are then rewarded for their creativity: their picture is placed in front of a landscape background and the phrase "Work of Art!" is overlaid on top of it. The family can then save their 'Work of Art!' in an application and/or share it with their friends.^[42](#Ch06.xhtml#fn6_42){#Ch06.xhtml#bck_fn6_42}^

This specific part of the 2011 ad is telling, in that it reveals an inconsistency hidden in Microsoft's claims around the Kinect---one that expands upon the inconsistencies found in the foundational papers of ubicomp exposed in the previous chapter. Like Weiser, Microsoft claims the Kinect is focused on us and our interactions with []{#Ch06.xhtml#page_131 .pagebreak title="131"}technology. Given its humanist focus, the Kinect, according to Microsoft, is a creative device, one that implies active learning and making. After all, it is the user, not technology that is creative; the Kinect just aids in the creation of an open-ended, participa-tory, and user-centric experience.

This claim is reinforced on Microsoft's website: the Kinect allows you to "unleash your creativity."^[43](#Ch06.xhtml#fn6_43){#Ch06.xhtml#bck_fn6_43}^ However, based on the action occurring in the advertisement, creativity with the Kinect, from within a gaming environment, is not an open-ended, participatory, and user-centric process. It does not denote the creation or production of artistic content. Nor has it transformed how people interact with technology, enabling users to "unleash their creativity" as I lay out above. Instead, the type of creativity Microsoft is promoting is a restrictive, flat, or two-dimensional version that amounts to little more than the consumption and surface-level manipulation of pre-determined multimodal content that is exploited by Microsoft, repackaged, and then sold back to its users for profit.

Microsoft exploits this content in multiple ways: it does it subtly, by releasing the code as "open-source" and then selling access to the community of makers that it has deemed "creative" back to its users (inaccessibility becomes exclusivity here), and it does so blatantly by directing content creators to webpages, via drop-down windows titled "monetize" and "publish," which provide detailed instructions on how to sell user-created content and by placing permanent watermarks on user-generated images.^[44](#Ch06.xhtml#fn6_44){#Ch06.xhtml#bck_fn6_44}^ In this example, Microsoft has not only instrumentalized the user by turning her into an interface ("you are the controller") but has co-opted the term "creativity" and commodified it, turning it into a term that is leveraged to drive profit.

The instrumentalization of the human body and the resulting commodification of aesthetic content raise questions around artistic experimentation: namely, artistic experimentation by new media artists, with ubiquitous interfaces in interactive new media installations. Companies like Microsoft are co-opting experimental ubiquitous interfaces that were developed for interactive new media art installations in the early 1990s for capitalistic purposes.^[45](#Ch06.xhtml#fn6_45){#Ch06.xhtml#bck_fn6_45}^ These interfaces have become commercial products and are marketed to users as "innovative," "creative," and "natural." While their technical make-up is similar, commercial interfaces differ enormously, on practical, creative, and theoretical levels, from those created for interactive new media installations in the early 1990s. They differ on a practical and creative level in the sense that the normal roles for computers at that time did not require these types of interfaces. All that was needed (and, to an extent, was available to the general public) were mice, keyboards, and joysticks/video-game controllers. While not necessarily new, the interfaces created for interactive installations were novel---specifically in terms of what the viewer/participant could actually achieve (physically contribute to the creation of a virtual environment without high-level technical knowledge) and the type of interaction afforded to them (unencumbered, full-bodied interaction in immersive, (semi-) virtual environments).

Interfaces created for interactive installations differ from commercial interfaces on a theoretical level in the sense that the interfaces of the early 1990s were developed and deployed to combat and sometimes attempt to correct, as Penny (2013) argues, "the notion of the (computational) virtual and the confused rhetorics of virtuality" attached to technologies.^[46](#Ch06.xhtml#fn6_46){#Ch06.xhtml#bck_fn6_46}^ The 1990s, Penny states, saw an "explosion of creative research in interactive and immersive art."^[47](#Ch06.xhtml#fn6_47){#Ch06.xhtml#bck_fn6_47}^ This explosion was fueled by the availability of affordable domestic, computational media technologies, the burgeoning []{#Ch06.xhtml#page_132 .pagebreak title="132"}rhetoric of cyberculture, and the utopian and dystopian narratives that followed it.^[48](#Ch06.xhtml#fn6_48){#Ch06.xhtml#bck_fn6_48}^ Given this, new media art, Penny writes, became "a highly charged vortex" for the development of interfaces "as the traditional commitment \[of the fine arts\] to material immediacy and finely crafted sensorial effect abruptly confronted a technology framed as abstract immaterial manipulation of information."^[49](#Ch06.xhtml#fn6_49){#Ch06.xhtml#bck_fn6_49}^ In this way, the reconciliation of "the sensibilities of arts practices and the capabilities and constraints of emerging computational media technologies" was, as Penny explains, just as important to new media artists, if not more important than a technical exploration of new technology itself.^[50](#Ch06.xhtml#fn6_50){#Ch06.xhtml#bck_fn6_50}^

Since then, ubiquitous interfaces that mimic those created by new media artists have been developed and are sold by commercial entities. However, the computing industries reliance on, in Penny's words, "virtual reality's stock-in-trade tracking and simulation techniques indicates that ubiquitous computing is less the kind of antithesis of virtual reality that Weiser envisaged and more of a continuity."^[51](#Ch06.xhtml#fn6_51){#Ch06.xhtml#bck_fn6_51}^ Thus, the co-option and consequent commercialization of experimental ubiquitous interfaces by the computer industry, Penny argues, has had the effect of re-introducing rhetoric surrounding "the virtual" into discussions around media and technology.^[52](#Ch06.xhtml#fn6_52){#Ch06.xhtml#bck_fn6_52}^ In doing this, commercial ubiquitous interfaces perpetuate the exact same narratives about the digital interface that new media artists in the 1990s were attempting to correct---in particular, those around disembodiment.

The disembodiment that this rhetoric promotes remains one of the principal concerns raised by ubiquitous interfaces, which have become so small and inexpensive that they can be embedded into a wide variety of objects and spaces. More subtle, however, are the effects that the ubiquitous interface may have and the role that it may play in creating, in N. Katherine Hayles's (2013) words, "an animate environment with agential and communicative powers."^[53](#Ch06.xhtml#fn6_53){#Ch06.xhtml#bck_fn6_53}^ Hayles continues, arguing that issues that have been raised around the effects ubiquitous technologies may have "are primarily epistemological (who knows what about whom)."^[54](#Ch06.xhtml#fn6_54){#Ch06.xhtml#bck_fn6_54}^ However, the "political stakes" of these environments, she states, encompass much more, including "the changed perceptions of human subjectivity in relation to a world of objects that are no longer passive and inert."^[55](#Ch06.xhtml#fn6_55){#Ch06.xhtml#bck_fn6_55}^ Thus, she concludes, the questions raised around ubiquitous technologies are not only confined to epistemological concerns, but envelop ontological issues as well.^[56](#Ch06.xhtml#fn6_56){#Ch06.xhtml#bck_fn6_56}^

For example, the Kinect, as a ubiquitous interface, operates not only in the realm of commercial gaming and computer science practices as in the sensing, recording, and identification of humans, but also in the technological unconscious. The Kinect operates in this way by working in subtle ("you are the controller") and not-so-subtle ways ("the Kinect transforms how people interact with technology") in an attempt to change the relationship between the human, technology, and space. Hayles writes that epistemological concerns about ubiquitous interfaces, like surveillance and privacy, can and are being addressed by both new media artists and theorists through strategies and tactics like regulation, informed consent, and critique.^[57](#Ch06.xhtml#fn6_57){#Ch06.xhtml#bck_fn6_57}^ Ontological issues, such as to what extent human subjectivity and bodies are being reconfigured by ubiquitous technologies, she tells us, are much more difficult to understand and address.^[58](#Ch06.xhtml#fn6_58){#Ch06.xhtml#bck_fn6_58}^ Thus, our reaction to them, she writes, mostly exists on the level of resistance (how do we stop this from happening/becoming the norm?).^[59](#Ch06.xhtml#fn6_59){#Ch06.xhtml#bck_fn6_59}^ However, she states, if our reactions to the concerns ubiquitous technologies raise remain solely on the level of resistance---as important as that reaction may be---we "lose the opportunity to seize []{#Ch06.xhtml#page_133 .pagebreak title="133"}the initiative and explore the technologies potential for shedding the burden of long-held misconceptions about cognition and moving to a more processual, relational and accurate view of embodied human action in complex environments."^[60](#Ch06.xhtml#fn6_60){#Ch06.xhtml#bck_fn6_60}^ Given this, the challenge that ubicomp presents to us is how to use its potential as an interface in positive and constructive ways while still remaining critical of it. Since the context in which this challenge presents itself is interactive new media installations, the question becomes: how might an investigation into the deployment of ubiquitous interfaces in interactive new media installations help us find alternative routes into and different ways of thinking about and using ubiquitous technologies in non-aesthetic realms? I believe new media artist Brian Knep's [Healing Pool]{.italic} (2008) could provide us with one alternative route into addressing the questions and concerns raised by Hayles.

[Healing Pool]{.italic} is a large-scale interactive new media installation, consisting of multiple closed-circuit cameras, projectors, computers, and a horizontal projection surface.^[61](#Ch06.xhtml#fn6_61){#Ch06.xhtml#bck_fn6_61}^ I encountered this work in Knep's studio in Boston, MA, shortly before it premiered at the Milwaukee Museum of Art in Milwaukee, WI in 2008. The projection surface was located on the floor and took up most of the studio space. The surface was covered from edge to edge with neon yellow, cell-shaped patterns. The patterns are generative, so [Healing Pool]{.italic} has no evident start or end---there is no perceived finality. Left alone, the patterns slowly pulsate and shift throughout the course of each day. When I walked across the projection surface, the patterns tore apart, revealing a trail of orange spaces or "wounds."

![fig6_1.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/DmH11JN.jpeg)

Placing an object on the projection surface or standing still produced a similar effect---a gaping orange hole appeared. After a certain period of time, the patterns rebuilt or "healed" themselves. The healing process did not restore the patterns to their previous state. It created "scars" on the surface of the work. The location of the scars was based on the placement of an object, or my trajectory. The more interaction built up, the more scars appeared, altering the visual appearance of the piece. Since I had to walk across the patterns on the surface to reveal the full nature of the artwork, the digital interface was my body.

![fig6_2.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/XJy4fDI.jpeg)

It is imperative at this point to address what could be seen as a contradictory designation of the interface. My designation of my body as interface in [Healing Pool]{.italic} could be said to contradict my earlier argument around the designation of the user's body as interface in the Kinect. To recap this argument: contrary to Microsoft's claims, I argued that the avatar of the user, and not the user's body, was the interface in the Kinect. I designated the interface as such because the avatar, not the user, is acting as a mediator between entities and allowing the user to navigate, communicate, and engage with audio-visual information. The difference in my designation of these two examples lies in the deployment of the interface, its exact purpose and positioning, as well as how the relationship between computation, aesthetics, and the interface is staged by the artist and performed by the viewer/participant in space.

Should we make the mistake of confusing the staging of the relationship between computation, aesthetics, and the interface [Healing Pool]{.italic} presents to its users for the one Microsoft presents to its users (appreciation and consumption of beautiful moving images), we learn that the purpose of [Healing Pool]{.italic} is to provide, as Knep states, a space in which "interactions---among people, between people and the piece, between people and the space they occupy" occur.^[62](#Ch06.xhtml#fn6_62){#Ch06.xhtml#bck_fn6_62}^ Here, Knep's emphasis is on relationships between entities and the interaction that these relationships create. Just as important []{#Ch06.xhtml#page_135 .pagebreak title="135"}to [Healing Pool]{.italic} as its visual aesthetics, then, is the viewer/participant's relationship with technology---specifically how her interactions with the interface (her body) can alter, to an extent, the artwork. Rather than trying to erase the interface altogether via false notions of invisibility, creativity, and control, as evidenced above via the Kinect, what is important in [Healing Pool]{.italic} is the interface---that is, the viewer/participant, her interactions, and her creative experience within the installation. By placing importance on relationships, Knep is emphasizing the experience and expression of the medium and the interface. He does this by making visible the alterations to the piece that the viewer/participant creates. Thus, notions of artistic production and creation can begin to shift away from representationalist modes of thinking and cybernetic modes of interacting, to a more performative and experiential exploration of, and reflection on, the possibilities and potentialities of the interface.

For example, when I walked diagonally across [Healing Pool]{.italic}'s surface, the patterns split apart. After a certain period of time, the trail knitted itself back together, creating visible scars. The more I moved, the more scars appeared on the surface. These scars, Knep states, "form a memory of all the interactions that have occurred."^[63](#Ch06.xhtml#fn6_63){#Ch06.xhtml#bck_fn6_63}^ Thus, [Healing Pool]{.italic} "becomes a map of \[viewer/participant\] movement in space," one that is not only visible to those located in the installation space, but that they can physically change, to an extent, as well.^[64](#Ch06.xhtml#fn6_64){#Ch06.xhtml#bck_fn6_64}^ Here, [Healing Pool]{.italic} is doing what the Kinect does not: it enabled me to "explore my creativity" by allowing me to become "the controller" of the action occurring in the artwork. It did this by making the effects that my embodied interactions have on the artwork visible. By becoming visible, I had the opportunity to begin to critically explore the effects that my interactions had on the artwork as well as make connections between my movements and the movements of others. In other words, the emphasis in [Healing Pool]{.italic} was placed on my movement and experience, not on the response of the machine. Since emphasis was placed on my experience rather than the end-product of my actions, as it is in the Kinect, my interactions in [Healing Pool]{.italic} became performative artworks themselves. Furthermore, by emphasizing notions of performativity, processuality, and visibility, a space was opened up for intervention through critical reflection---one which allowed me to think seriously about my experience with the work, the consequences that my alterations have on the surface of the patterns, and how these alterations effect other entities located in the same space.

The examples of ubiquitous interfaces that I have discussed so far describe physical objects. They are singular things (a shadow, an avatar), commercialized products (the Kinect), or biological entities (human bodies). However, ubicomp is not just about the interactions with a tangible object for some definite purpose (although sometimes it can be); it concerns the subject's conscious and unconscious engagement with multiple, networked computational systems as well. Given this, things like the Internet, RFID tags, and motion-sensor lighting systems are ubiquitous interfaces. They are considered as such because ubicomp is, as Adam Greenfield (2006) writes, "a distributed phenomenon: The power and meaning we ascribe to it are more a property of the network than of any single node."^[65](#Ch06.xhtml#fn6_65){#Ch06.xhtml#bck_fn6_65}^ Therefore, ubicomp "isn't so much a particular kind of hardware, philosophy of software design or set of interface conventions as it is a situation---a set of circumstances."^[66](#Ch06.xhtml#fn6_66){#Ch06.xhtml#bck_fn6_66}^ Thus, he concludes, ubicomp is less of an instrumental black-boxed technology and more of a conceptual process---one that is linked "not merely by a technical armature, but by a set of assumptions about the proper role of technology."^[67](#Ch06.xhtml#fn6_67){#Ch06.xhtml#bck_fn6_67}^ Greenfield's positioning of notions of ubicomp, first of []{#Ch06.xhtml#page_136 .pagebreak title="136"}all as a problem, by referring to ubicomp as a set of assertions suggests that ubicomp can be understood as performative. I say performative because ubicomp is a futuristic, ongoing, and open-ended project that in its current iteration is surrounded by technodeterminist assumptions about human and non-human behaviors---specifically, how interfaces and humans [should]{.italic} be, how they [should]{.italic} behave in the environment in which they are placed, and how others [should]{.italic} interact with them.

## [["A Radically New Tool"]{.bold}](#content.xhtml#bck_sec6_4) {#Ch06.xhtml#sec6_4}

A good example of how the assumptions around human and non-human behaviors that ubicomp makes manifest themselves in interactive new media installations can be seen in Natalie Jeremijenko's Live Wire (1995).^[68](#Ch06.xhtml#fn6_68){#Ch06.xhtml#bck_fn6_68}^ Live Wire is an incredibly important piece to discuss in relation to ubicomp as it is widely considered to be one of the first artworks to incorporate ubiquitous technology or have a ubiquitous interface.^[69](#Ch06.xhtml#fn6_69){#Ch06.xhtml#bck_fn6_69}^

[Live Wire]{.italic} is, in Weiser and Seely Brown's (1996) words, "a radically new tool ... Its output is so beautifully integrated with human information processing that one does not even need to be looking at it or near it to take advantage of its peripheral clues."^[70](#Ch06.xhtml#fn6_70){#Ch06.xhtml#bck_fn6_70}^ Commissioned by Xerox PARC, [Live Wire]{.italic} is an eight-foot-long piece of red string that displays Internet traffic. Located below the string is a black-and-white sign that reads: "Caution Live Wire."^[71](#Ch06.xhtml#fn6_71){#Ch06.xhtml#bck_fn6_71}^

The string and the sign are the only parts of the piece that the user can see. However, [Live Wire]{.italic} consists of many more hardware- and software-based components, which are embedded in the ceiling. They are imperceptible to the user, so they are considered unimportant to the installation. These elements are so unimportant that Weiser and Seely Brown state that [Live Wire]{.italic} "uses no software" and "does not contain a computer at all."^[72](#Ch06.xhtml#fn6_72){#Ch06.xhtml#bck_fn6_72}^ While [Live Wire]{.italic} does not require a PC in its final iteration, it does contain a motor, an Ethernet cable and the Internet. These components are integral to [Live Wire]{.italic}, as they allow it to function. For example, the string is attached to a small electric motor. The motor is located in the ceiling and is connected via an Ethernet cable to the Internet. The string is pre-programmed to respond to network activity. It does this by twitching or, as Weiser and Seely Brown call it, "waving."^[73](#Ch06.xhtml#fn6_73){#Ch06.xhtml#bck_fn6_73}^ In this way, the string could be considered to be the interface in this work because the string is the point of mediation and interaction between entities. It provides the user with information as well. My brief description of the artwork provided above begs two questions: if all that is visible is a dangling string, then how exactly does a user interact with [Live Wire]{.italic}? Moreover, what does interactivity imply in this context?

The answer to the first question is simple: all a user has to do to interact with [Live Wire]{.italic} is to walk past it. [Live Wire]{.italic} was originally installed in an unused corridor of a hallway in Xerox PARC's Computer Science Lab.^[74](#Ch06.xhtml#fn6_74){#Ch06.xhtml#bck_fn6_74}^ When an office worker walked through the corridor in which [Live Wire]{.italic} was located, she saw it and, to an extent, heard it. What she saw or heard depended on the amount of Internet traffic happening at that precise time. If she passed through the corridor when the network was busy, [Live Wire]{.italic} twitched a lot---so much so that the user not only saw the string move, but she also heard it move (via the grinding of the motor in the ceiling).^[75](#Ch06.xhtml#fn6_75){#Ch06.xhtml#bck_fn6_75}^ If she happened to pass through the corridor during a lull in activity, [Live Wire]{.italic} was programmed to twitch every few seconds. She could then decide to stop and view []{#Ch06.xhtml#page_137 .pagebreak title="137"}the work, or ignore it---to walk past it and carry on with her day.^[76](#Ch06.xhtml#fn6_76){#Ch06.xhtml#bck_fn6_76}^ It does not matter what she did (if she stopped or continued); simply passing by [Live Wire]{.italic} implied interaction. This is because regardless of whether or not the office worker stopped, she was receiving a constant flow of information from the piece. In this way, [Live Wire]{.italic}, according to Weiser and Seely Brown, is a perfect physical or "real-world" representation of the concepts of ubicomp, in it allows for "peripheral attunement" on behalf of the user.^[77](#Ch06.xhtml#fn6_77){#Ch06.xhtml#bck_fn6_77}^ By peripheral attunement, Weiser and Seely Brown mean that users can glean specific information from [Live Wire]{.italic} (Internet traffic) without consciously interacting with it. Furthermore, unlike other screen-based displays of Internet traffic, the information it transmits does not require a lot of "interpretation and attention" on behalf of the user.^[78](#Ch06.xhtml#fn6_78){#Ch06.xhtml#bck_fn6_78}^ Thus, [Live Wire]{.italic}, according to Weiser and Seely Brown, informs users without over-burdening them, because it provides users with clues about their environment.^[79](#Ch06.xhtml#fn6_79){#Ch06.xhtml#bck_fn6_79}^

Simanowski (2013) finds the way in which information is presented to users in [Live Wire]{.italic} and consequently analyzed by Weiser and Seely Brown to be problematic. It is important to recognize, he states, that information in [Live Wire]{.italic} is "not simply present in the background, moving to center stage when needed, but also that it has changed its nature through the specific way of presentation."^[80](#Ch06.xhtml#fn6_80){#Ch06.xhtml#bck_fn6_80}^ Information has changed through presentation because ubicomp "makes not only computers invisible---so that they disappear into the environment---but also information. [Live Wire]{.italic} does so ... by rendering information imperceptible."^[81](#Ch06.xhtml#fn6_81){#Ch06.xhtml#bck_fn6_81}^ Here, Simanowski is arguing that [Live Wire]{.italic} is filtering information through the processes of selection, subtraction, translation, and reflection, as detailed in previous chapters. Therefore, it is altering the information that it transmits to users. In this way, information, for Simanowski, is rendered imperceptible because some of the information that [Live Wire]{.italic} presents to users (specifically the information that is not relevant to the narrative of the artwork) is obscured through a filtration process.^[82](#Ch06.xhtml#fn6_82){#Ch06.xhtml#bck_fn6_82}^

I argue that Weiser and Seely Brown are participating in the same processes of filtration in their theorization of [Live Wire.]{.italic} They are selecting, translating, and then reflecting information back to readers about [Live Wire]{.italic} and ubicomp that is relevant to their argument ([Live Wire]{.italic} is a perfect example of ubicomp), while filtering out the information that contradicts their argument (ubicomp obscures some information). In doing this, they are not only rendering interfaces and information imperceptible, but they are unintentionally using information and, to an extent, technology as a way to fix user's behaviors with ubiquitous interfaces. They do this by regulating, to the point that they are determining how a ubiquitous interface should look (invisible), what it should do (calm, inform), and how users should interact with it (constantly).

Let me explain this argument by giving an example. A ubiquitous interface, according to Weiser and Seely Brown, should not only be invisible, calming, and informative, but should also be effective---it should provide the user with helpful information without being obtrusive, as mentioned earlier. However, when an office worker walks past [Live Wire]{.italic}, as Simanowski details above, she does not receive the "full picture," just blurred information.^[83](#Ch06.xhtml#fn6_83){#Ch06.xhtml#bck_fn6_83}^ The office worker knows that if the string twitches a lot, if there is a lot of Internet traffic and that if it is not twitching, there is minimal or no Internet traffic, but she does not receive specifics---she never gets exact measurements of Internet traffic at a moment's flux. Given this, [Live Wire]{.italic} is an ineffectual ubiquitous interface. I use the word "ineffectual" because the []{#Ch06.xhtml#page_138 .pagebreak title="138"}interface does not perform the calming and informative functions Weiser and Seely Brown claim it does. The string mediates and translates information, and then provides it to users, but it does not inform, nor is it calming or effective. Instead, the information parsed by [Live Wire]{.italic}, as Simanowski writes, is "mapped only as movement" and, in being this way, the interface contradicts, to an extent, Weiser and Seely Brown's theory of ubicomp by calling attention to itself.^[84](#Ch06.xhtml#fn6_84){#Ch06.xhtml#bck_fn6_84}^ I suggest that the way that interaction is presented to the viewer/participant in [Live Wire]{.italic} and consequently theorized by Weiser and Seely Brown is as ineffectual as the issues around information and their theorization of the interface. This is because the way in which Weiser and Seely Brown analyze user interaction with [Live Wire]{.italic} contradicts, to an extent, their theory of ubicomp.

Interactivity in interactive new media installations, as Stern (2013) tells us, is an embodied, relational, and mutually emergent process that humans perform with and as technology, together.^[85](#Ch06.xhtml#fn6_85){#Ch06.xhtml#bck_fn6_85}^ Interactivity is, he states, varied in its engagements and consists of multiple human and non-human entities (viewer/participants, technology, the artist) that slowly become confused over time.^[86](#Ch06.xhtml#fn6_86){#Ch06.xhtml#bck_fn6_86}^ In doing this, viewer/participant interaction has the ability to "intervene in, and challenge, not only the construction of bodies and identities, but also the ongoing and emergent processes of embodiment, as they happen."^[87](#Ch06.xhtml#fn6_87){#Ch06.xhtml#bck_fn6_87}^ Thus, interactivity is a process that frames, articulates, and amplifies "how the body's inscriptions, meanings and matters unfold out while the world's sensations, concepts and matters enfold in."^[88](#Ch06.xhtml#fn6_88){#Ch06.xhtml#bck_fn6_88}^ Given this, interactivity, for Stern, is "a [situation]{.italic} that accents embodiment and signification ... It [frames]{.italic} how we [move-think-feel]{.italic} with and...as an articulation of meaning."^[89](#Ch06.xhtml#fn6_89){#Ch06.xhtml#bck_fn6_89}^ Based on their theorization of human interaction with ubiquitous interfaces like [Live Wire]{.italic}, Weiser and Seely Brown seem to agree with Stern's theorization of interactivity.

Users should, according to Weiser and Seely Brown, be able to interact with ubiquitous interfaces without being constantly bombarded with information. They write that ubiquitous interfaces enable this type of interaction in two ways: first, by moving from the center of the user's attention to the periphery and back in an easy manner; and then by enhancing the users "peripheral reach," making information accessible that would otherwise be out of reach or inaccessible, thus increasing the user's knowledge and ability to interact with information if she so chooses, "without increasing information overload."^[90](#Ch06.xhtml#fn6_90){#Ch06.xhtml#bck_fn6_90}^ Here Weiser and Seely Brown are suggesting that ubiquitous interfaces should provide users with easy access to information. If the user requests information from the interface, then this information should come to the fore and the user should be able to interact with it in an easy and perhaps even fun manner. If the user does not want to receive information, then the interface, and the information it is transmitting, should fade into the periphery.

[Live Wire]{.italic}, as Weiser and Seely Brown argue, is a perfect practical example of how a user should interact with ubiquitous technologies. As they write: "At first it \[[Live Wire]{.italic}\] creates a center of attention just by being unique. But this center soon becomes peripheral as the gentle waving of the string moves easily to the background. That the string can be both seen and heard helps by increasing the clues for peripheral attunement."^[91](#Ch06.xhtml#fn6_91){#Ch06.xhtml#bck_fn6_91}^ [Live Wire]{.italic}'s ability to move from the center to the background of the user's attention, they state, "increases our peripheral reach to the formerly inaccessible network traffic."^[92](#Ch06.xhtml#fn6_92){#Ch06.xhtml#bck_fn6_92}^ Thus, interaction with [Live Wire]{.italic} allows the user to attend to and consequently interpret the information provided to her, as well as reflect on the experience of [Live Wire]{.italic} without feeling overloaded. In short, user interaction with []{#Ch06.xhtml#page_139 .pagebreak title="139"}[Live Wire]{.italic}, for Weiser and Seely Brown, should be a mutually co-constitutive process, one that helps the user frame and articulate the information presented to her. They also believe that interaction with [Live Wire]{.italic} offers the user more choice and possibilities in regards to the way she accesses information, through its ability to move from the center to the periphery of their attention.

However, as mentioned above, interaction with [Live Wire]{.italic} is positioned by Weiser and Seely Brown as compulsory. The office worker is required, by way of presentation, to interact with or at least to view [Live Wire]{.italic}. The office worker walks down the corridor in and there is [Live Wire]{.italic}---moving, making sounds, bombarding her with a constant flow of semi-coherent information, and forcing her to interact with it. By making interaction compulsory, Weiser and Seely Brown are taking away the office worker's choice as to whether or not she would like to interact with [Live Wire]{.italic}. Thus, I argue that the notion that interactivity with [Live Wire]{.italic} offers the user more choice and possibilities, as suggested by Weiser and Seely Brown, is false and counter-productive. I say false and counter-productive because [Live Wire]{.italic} does not actually do what Weiser and Seely Brown say it does (offer the user more choice and thus possibility). Moreover, just because an interface has the ability to move from the center to the periphery of the user's attention does not mean that the user has any awareness of or fully comprehends the activity in which she is participating. The office worker might be able to freely access information that [Live Wire]{.italic} provides, as Weiser and Seely Brown suggest above, but she does not have the ability to regulate the flow of, or understand, the information being provided to her. In this way, user interaction with [Live Wire]{.italic} and [Live Wire]{.italic} itself becomes the opposite of what Weiser and Seely Brown position it as---it is an obtrusive, incomprehensible, and determined rather than an informative and calming experience.

Weiser and Seely Brown, as Simanowski notes, do not discuss the issue surrounding the incomprehensibility of information in their article.^[93](#Ch06.xhtml#fn6_93){#Ch06.xhtml#bck_fn6_93}^ Nor do they address the contradiction around interaction noted above. This lack of acknowledgment explains why they are able to present [Live Wire]{.italic} as a perfect example of how ubicomp should be, without taking into account the extent to which [Live Wire]{.italic} allows for informed actions on behalf of the office worker. It also provides some insight into their confusing description of [Live Wire]{.italic} as a tool rather than a work of art.

## [[In Conclusion]{.bold}](#content.xhtml#bck_sec6_5) {#Ch06.xhtml#sec6_5}

I will conclude my exploration into the use of ubiquitous interfaces in interactive new media installations by examining the potential artistic experimentation with ubiquitous interfaces plays in demystifying ubicomp claims. My starting point for this exploration lies in Greenfield's suggestion that ubicomp is a set of assumptions rather than a unified theory. I use Greenfield's suggestion as a starting point because it indicates that there is a possibility for alternative versions and visions of ubiquitous interfaces---versions and visions that open up a space for exploration and experimentation on behalf of the artist and the viewer/participant. It also suggests that we can employ different, less techno-deterministic approaches to analyzing ubiquitous interfaces. In short, the ubiquitous interface may be limited in its responses and the information it gives to the viewer/participant (as this information and these responses are almost always constrained as they are almost always pre-programmed), but there are limitless possibilities in terms of how we critically investigate and explore it.

[]{#Ch06.xhtml#page_140 .pagebreak title="140"}Critical investigation and exploration can take many forms. One of the most important is artistic experimentation and re-interpretation. For example, through experimentation and re-interpretation, new media artists are able to defamiliarize ubiquitous interfaces and intervene in the myths that surround them, making them, to an extent, recognizable and visible for critique. Furthermore, artistic experimentation with ubiquitous interfaces in interactive new media installations allows us to think seriously about what the relationship between aesthetics, computation, and the interface possibly could become, rather than accepting what we are told it is or has to be.

Throughout their article, Weiser and Seely Brown refer to [Live Wire]{.italic} as a "radically new tool" one that provides the user with "bits \[of information\] through motion, sound and even touch."^[94](#Ch06.xhtml#fn6_94){#Ch06.xhtml#bck_fn6_94}^ While I believe it was incredibly radical at the time it was created, [Live Wire]{.italic} is not a tool. It is a work of art, as it was created by an artist---Natalie Jeremijenko.^[95](#Ch06.xhtml#fn6_95){#Ch06.xhtml#bck_fn6_95}^ The fact that [Live Wire]{.italic} is a piece of art, according to Simanowski, reveals another issue in Weiser and Seely Brown's theory of ubicomp.^[96](#Ch06.xhtml#fn6_96){#Ch06.xhtml#bck_fn6_96}^ This issue, he writes, is "the fact that an artwork logically contradicts the notion of ubiquity and invisibility because by nature its aim is to call attention to itself as an intervention into the everyday life environment."^[97](#Ch06.xhtml#fn6_97){#Ch06.xhtml#bck_fn6_97}^

Simanowski's statement about [Live Wire]{.italic} foregrounds an important question in terms of how we relate to, form relationships with, and make meaning of technologically based artworks and artistic practices. As argued, via Amelia Jones (2000) in [Chapter 3](#Ch03.xhtml) above, in its tripartite role as "creator of social-space," "actualizer of power," and "site of resistance," the human body is able to become explicitly "non-universal" and "non-transcendent," and in its ability to become this way lays the potential for radically dislocative practices.^[98](#Ch06.xhtml#fn6_98){#Ch06.xhtml#bck_fn6_98}^ One of these radically dislocative practices is a rethinking of the digital interface as human body in interactive new media installations. However, by designating a form so intimate to us, as interface, and then advocating for invisibility, as theories of ubicomp do, the interface is naturalized. And in being this way, when designated as interface, the human body---specifically its ability to act as "the actualizer of power" and "the site of resistance"---is, to an extent, neutralized. So, what does the naturalization (of the interface) and neutralization (of the human body) mean for artistic experimentation with ubiquitous interfaces in interactive new media installations? What happens when an artwork used to epitomize the main tenants of ubicomp negates it? And can this negation provide us with a framework for a different understanding a whole range of contemporary artworks that employ ubiquitous interfaces?

Taking these questions into account, I would like to provide a different interpretation of [Live Wire]{.italic} than the one offered by Weiser and Seely Brown. Contrary to Weiser and Seely Brown's claims that [Live Wire]{.italic} is a perfect representation of ubicomp, I suggest that [Live Wire]{.italic} represents a very specific reaction to the three concepts of ubicomp that have been central to my discussion thus far---aesthetics, invisibility, and interactivity. [Live Wire]{.italic} reacts to the notion of invisibility by defamiliarizing information, presenting information as a performative event. It reacts to notions of interactivity in a similar way. It defamiliarizes common preconceived notions of interactivity in interactive new media installations through the lack thereof. Finally, it reacts to notions of aesthetics by existing as an artwork.

I argue that [Live Wire]{.italic} is defined by a refusal, on behalf of the artist, to turn information into aesthetically pleasing data. Jeremijenko reiterates this idea in her statements []{#Ch06.xhtml#page_141 .pagebreak title="141"}around the work: [Live Wire]{.italic}, she tells us, "is tacit information, rather than more of the precisely graphed, data fetishism of information rhetoric."^[99](#Ch06.xhtml#fn6_99){#Ch06.xhtml#bck_fn6_99}^ In contrast to screen-based graphs of Internet activity, [Live Wire]{.italic}, she writes, "is a shared social display of information."^[100](#Ch06.xhtml#fn6_100){#Ch06.xhtml#bck_fn6_100}^ The tacit information aesthetic and shared social display of information that Jeremijenko wishes to achieve is set against its own silence in the parts of [Live Wire]{.italic} that are visible to the viewer/participant (the red string and the black-and-white printed sign). This combination creates a sparse, uninteresting, uninteractive, and uninformative environment---one that provides the viewer/participant with the ultimate form of control: to critically reflect on and then to reject, to an extent, the artwork and the concept of ubicomp, and walk away from it. [Live Wire]{.italic}, then, is not interactive in the way in which we are normally accustomed to seeing. Interactivity with this piece is not about clicking links, reading on-screen information, making a specific semiotic gesture, or performing a choreographed dance. By pushing the lack of aesthetics, information, and interactivity to such an extreme, [Live Wire]{.italic} acts as an intervention into normative assumptions around interactivity and aesthetics in interactive new media installations. For example, by asking viewer/participants to critically reflect on and then to reject, to an extent, the artwork and the underlying concepts on which it is based, is a gesture made by Jeremijenko to the viewer/participant that turns notions of ubicomp against themselves and away from the repetitive and surface-level forms of HCI that it promotes. Rather than fostering the illusion that [Live Wire]{.italic} is a democratic tool, the absence of choice---specifically the choice whether or not to interact with it---is accentuated.

[Live Wire]{.italic} also eschews the aesthetic and information-based conventions of ubicomp as laid out by Weiser in the foundational papers. [Live Wire]{.italic} troubles Weiser's notion that the invisibility of information is a good thing and that interfaces should not be attractive. It does this by calling attention to itself through its messy, dissonant aesthetics. The found-object aesthetics of the work and its placement serves two purposes: it acts as a visual response to the "precisely graphed, data fetishism"; and it acts as a response to notions of invisibility and attractiveness, in that it looks like it does not belong in the space in which it is located, ultimately piquing viewer/participant interest and thus attracting viewer/participant attention.^[101](#Ch06.xhtml#fn6_101){#Ch06.xhtml#bck_fn6_101}^ Furthermore, the string is almost always in motion. When Internet traffic is high, the motor the string is attached to makes a grinding sound, calling even more attention to the fact that it exists, rather than effacing it altogether as a means to better foster the illusion of invisibility.

The exact meaning of the information that [Live Wire]{.italic} is presenting to the viewer/participant is as confusing as the piece's interface and aesthetics, simply because the viewer/participant is receiving incomprehensible information. Thus, in opposition to Weiser and Seely Brown's attempt to naturalize information to the point of invisibility, [Live Wire]{.italic} makes information confusing, unfamiliar, and uncomfortable. In this way, I argue that [Live Wire]{.italic} could be seen as an artwork that is simultaneously of, and not of, ubicomp. It works as a response to notions of invisibility, inaccessibility, and interactivity---notions that prevent any kind of informed action on behalf of the viewer/participant beyond surface-level interventions. With its messy aesthetic, its minimal-ist interface, and the constant low-level of obscured information that it transmits, [Live Wire]{.italic} works against, via defamiliarization, some of the main tenants of ubicomp, while simultaneously helping to define what a ubiquitous interface is, what it should do, and how we should interact with it in interactive new media installations.

# [[7 []{#Ch07.xhtml#page_146 .pagebreak title="146"}The Implanted Interface]{.bold}](#content.xhtml#bck_Ch07) {#Ch07.xhtml#Ch07}

In the previous two chapters, I introduced theoretical perspectives around the digital interface that addressed concepts of invisibility as they relate to notions of ubiquitous computing. I argued that the relationship between computation, aesthetics, and the interface is a process that questions the ways in which interfaces are theorized and deployed in everyday environments. In this chapter, I extend this discussion, focusing on the ways in which the interface reflects the ever-changing relationship between the human and technology through an examination of my final interface: the implant.

In what follows, I explore what interfaces mean when they are implanted into human bodies, what happens to these implanted bodies when they materialize through artistic practice, and how they may reconfigure, or not, our human relationship with technology. The main argument I make is that the implant operates as a set of socio-cultural parameters, ideological activities, and programmed codes. Operating in this way, the implant remediates the discourses and functions of the digital interface---specifically its ability to organize and render socio-cultural, biological, and political relationships as well as bodies (in)visible. For example, the rhetoric that surrounds the implant, like the rhetoric that surrounds the ubiquitous interface in the previous chapters, has the tendency to reduce the human body and embodied experience to a set of 1's and 0's. It does this by linking the outside of the body to the inside in an attempt to render it transparent and, in some cases, erase bodies that do not conform to normalized standards. However, I also suggest that the implant holds the same potential as the digital interface when used in interactive new media installations. It has the ability to allow the viewer/participant to begin to (re)configure the key concepts of agency, identity, embodiment, and the self in these environments.

Agency in this chapter is understood in Margrit Shildrick's (2009, 2012) terms as the ability, on behalf of a subject, to make choices about her body and create change in her environment.^[1](#Ch07.xhtml#fn7_1){#Ch07.xhtml#bck_fn7_1}^ Thus, agency, for Shildrick, is about identity and self-hood.^[2](#Ch07.xhtml#fn7_2){#Ch07.xhtml#bck_fn7_2}^ Shildrick theorizes this concept from the context of critical disability studies, arguing that agency, as well as autonomy, are "valued attributes of personhood" as well as modernist understandings of what it means to be "properly human."^[3](#Ch07.xhtml#fn7_3){#Ch07.xhtml#bck_fn7_3}^ These concepts traditionally include "both a grasp of rationality and control over one's own body."^[4](#Ch07.xhtml#fn7_4){#Ch07.xhtml#bck_fn7_4}^ When challenged---especially by people with non-normative bodies and embodiments---these concepts ground a deep-seated anxiety for the normative majority.^[5](#Ch07.xhtml#fn7_5){#Ch07.xhtml#bck_fn7_5}^ The consequence of this anxiety, Shildrick concludes, is that "difference is made other, rejected and devalued by those who are able to broadly align themselves with the illusory standards of the psychosocial imaginary."^[6](#Ch07.xhtml#fn7_6){#Ch07.xhtml#bck_fn7_6}^

[]{#Ch07.xhtml#page_147 .pagebreak title="147"}Notions of identity and the self are read through Amelia Jones's model of queer feminist durationality, as discussed in [Chapter 2](#Ch02.xhtml).^[7](#Ch07.xhtml#fn7_7){#Ch07.xhtml#bck_fn7_7}^ Finally, I draw on Donna Har-away's (1988, 1991) definition of embodiment as "significant prosthesis."^[8](#Ch07.xhtml#fn7_8){#Ch07.xhtml#bck_fn7_8}^ The word "prosthesis" in Haraway's definition should not be read in utilitarian terms, as a device that replaces a missing body part, as it is in excess of physical substitutions of, or material additions to, the human body. Nor is a prosthesis a device that exists outside the norm. For, as critical disability studies theorists David Mitchell and Sharon Snyder (2000) argue, "far from signifying a deficiency, the prostheticized body is the rule, not the exception."^[9](#Ch07.xhtml#fn7_9){#Ch07.xhtml#bck_fn7_9}^ In this way, the word "prosthesis" should be understood as modes of being that encompass an array of materials, practices, spaces, and bodies that problematize, as Haraway writes, "the structures and modes of reproduction of 'Western Identity.'"^[10](#Ch07.xhtml#fn7_10){#Ch07.xhtml#bck_fn7_10}^

## [[Implanting the Interface]{.bold}](#content.xhtml#bck_sec7_1) {#Ch07.xhtml#sec7_1}

An implant is broadly defined as an object that is placed into the human body. Unlike prosthetics, which are used to replace missing body parts, or a transplant, which is transplanted biomedical tissue, the primary purpose of an implant is to support, mediate, and/or enhance pre-existing biological structures. Implants mediate, and therefore to an extent create, relationships between people and people, and people and technologies. Thus, implants could be considered to be interfaces because they influence the movements and perceptions of bodies in space and time. I draw on Kayla J. Heffernan, Frank Vetere, and Shanton Chang's (2016, 2017) understandings of the implant to theorize the concept of the implanted interface. The word "implant," according to Heffernan, Vetere, and Chang (2017), "is derived from the Latin [implantare]{.italic} meaning engraft or to plant."^[11](#Ch07.xhtml#fn7_11){#Ch07.xhtml#bck_fn7_11}^ Its meaning was broadened over time and has become attached to a diverse range of medical and non-medical forms located across the socio-cultural and technical landscape. Implantable medical devices (IMDs) are the most commonly encountered examples. Heffernan, Vetere, and Chang (2016) define IMDs as "those \[technological devices\] inserted into the body for restorative purposes."^[12](#Ch07.xhtml#fn7_12){#Ch07.xhtml#bck_fn7_12}^ Examples of IMDs include, but are not limited to, wires, pins, poles, and plates used to support ligaments, tissues, or bones; intrauterine systems and devices (IUSs, IUDs); pacemakers and silicone shells (i.e. breast implants) used to regulate, enhance, or replace biological processes and structures; and pharmaceutical delivery devices and deep brain stimulation for the treatment of genetic conditions such as multiple sclerosis (MS) and Parkinson's disease.^[13](#Ch07.xhtml#fn7_13){#Ch07.xhtml#bck_fn7_13}^

In recent years we have seen an increase in non-medical devices voluntarily implanted in the human body. Heffernan, Vetere, and Chang (2016) attribute the increase in voluntary implants to the use of transdermal and subdermal "non-life-threatening health products" like wearable prophylactics, insertable menstrual aids, and transdermal nicotine patches, as well as the rise in popularity of commercial wearable devices like the Fitbit.^[14](#Ch07.xhtml#fn7_14){#Ch07.xhtml#bck_fn7_14}^ They continue, listing the different types of voluntary implants currently in use: (1) magnets (used for interaction with digital artifacts, sensorial use, and human connection); (2) NFC and RFID microchips (used for access and authentication); and (3) bespoke devices (in their study, this device was used for self-monitoring).^[15](#Ch07.xhtml#fn7_15){#Ch07.xhtml#bck_fn7_15}^ They consider these three types of voluntary implants to be extensions of luggable devices (technologies that are carried by a person) and wearable devices.^[16](#Ch07.xhtml#fn7_16){#Ch07.xhtml#bck_fn7_16}^ The second and third definitions, NFC and RFID microchips and bespoke []{#Ch07.xhtml#page_148 .pagebreak title="148"}devices, form the basis for my analysis in this chapter, simply because they are the most commonly deployed.

Heffernan, Vetere, and Chang use the word "insertable" throughout their articles to refer to "non-permanent, voluntary, devices contained within the boundaries of the body."^[17](#Ch07.xhtml#fn7_17){#Ch07.xhtml#bck_fn7_17}^ For them, the difference between IMDs and insertables is an issue of context (medical vs. non-medical), as well as one of user agency and choice.^[18](#Ch07.xhtml#fn7_18){#Ch07.xhtml#bck_fn7_18}^ For example, when used within a medical context, the word "implantable," they state, refers to "an object fixed in a person's body by surgery."^[19](#Ch07.xhtml#fn7_19){#Ch07.xhtml#bck_fn7_19}^ Unlike insertables, the user, they write, "has little choice of whether or not to use an IMD. The driver is typically the result of a medical need, not a discretionary want."^[20](#Ch07.xhtml#fn7_20){#Ch07.xhtml#bck_fn7_20}^ In other words, according to Heffernan, Vetere, and Chang, some implants are voluntary, personal choices initiated by the person undertaking the procedure, whereas others are the result of a perceived medical need and thus could be considered to be, to an extent, an involuntary activity. I agree with Heffernan, Vetere, and Chang's definitions of and delineations between IMDs and insertables---specifically their framing of implants as a matter of choice on behalf of the subject. I extend their exploration in this chapter, suggesting that implants, like interfaces, are a matter of choice [as well as]{.italic} medical and social power and control over bodies, in that they regulate communication, interaction, knowledge, and movement in time and space in both interactive new media installations and in everyday life.

## [[The Limited and Limitless Possibilities of the Implant]{.bold}](#content.xhtml#bck_sec7_2) {#Ch07.xhtml#sec7_2}

A long tradition of medical science practice and, to an extent, medical humanities-oriented theory has focused on issues related to agency, embodiment, identity, and the self as they apply to medical devices like implants, positioning them as technologies that structure images and representations of human bodies. For example, academic research has been conducted on the way in which technology enforces medical and social control over bodies by scholars in the humanities---specifically those working in critical disability, critical race, and queer studies. These works range, to give a few examples, from anthropological studies into how socio-cultural conditions construct technologically based identities (Rode, 2010, 2011, 2018); the representation of able bodies and disability in mass-mediated consumer technologies like video games (Carr, 2014, 2017), from those tracing the historically intersecting truth claims of physiognomy, phrenology, eugenics, and modern-day plastic surgery (Wegenstien, 2012) to those providing accounts of how the creation of "ideal users" of contraceptive implants mirror the transnational political economy of women's bodies (Davis, 1983; Takeshita, 2010). These texts, among others, map the ways in which notions of gender, race, disability, and technology impact each other's logic and development in contemporary society.

More recently, scholars working in critical disability, critical race, and queer studies have provided critiques of these technologies as propagating ablest, misogynistic, and racist policies and values, which are based, to an extent, on humanist and medicalized models of the body.^[21](#Ch07.xhtml#fn7_21){#Ch07.xhtml#bck_fn7_21}^ For instance, Shildrick (2002, 2009) examines ablest policies and values from within the context of critical disability studies, arguing that "disabled people continue to endure broad cultural discrimination and alienation not so much for their difference (which may of course be hidden) but because their performativity of embodied selfhood lays bare the psycho-social imaginary that sustains modernist understandings of what it is to be properly human."^[22](#Ch07.xhtml#fn7_22){#Ch07.xhtml#bck_fn7_22}^ Wendy Chun (2012) presents []{#Ch07.xhtml#page_149 .pagebreak title="149"}a similar critique of these models as they relate to race, suggesting that "race is not simply an object of representation and portrayal of truth," but a technique, "a historically inflected system of tools," as well as processes of mediation and enframing that constructs history and identity.^[23](#Ch07.xhtml#fn7_23){#Ch07.xhtml#bck_fn7_23}^

One argument that theorists working in these fields make, and that I reiterate in this chapter, is that it is time to replace the humanist and medicalized models of the body that underlie theories of technology, like the implant and the interface, with a more inclusive theory of bodily experience. For example, the stories that inform and to an extent structure the parameters, activities, and codes of the implant, like those that inform and structure the interface discussed in previous chapters, are all deeply rooted in humanist thinking about the relationship between the body, identity, and technology. As was argued in [Chapter 2](#Ch02.xhtml), notions of the body, technology, and identity are co-constitutive structures of belief, in the sense that the modern subject, and consequently identity and technology, are products of humanist discourses about aesthetics and art (among other things).

Critical disability and critical race theory carefully and skillfully capture the ableism, misogyny, and racism embedded in humanist thinking around the body, and expose how deeply ingrained it is in technology and its underlying structures. However, it less frequently addresses the underlying aesthetic undercurrent in the rhetoric around the relationship between the body and technology. So, what can critical race and critical disability studies tell us about aesthetics and the interface? The answer to this question, I believe, is that critical race and critical disability studies show us that agency and embodiment are not universal concepts. Therefore, different disciplinary regimes need to be taken into account when examining the interface in interactive new media installations.

In taking up my present focus on the implant, I reiterate and build on some of the same themes as the scholars in the fields listed above, but I place them in a different, more fine arts-based context---specifically interactive new media installations. While our contexts and some of the theory we draw on may differ, our aims are similar in that we seek to critique and overturn the same normative paradigms of the body and technology that determine who or what should be valued (and therefore can exert power and control over their environments and bodies) and who or what should not. For instance, like concepts of race, gender, and disability, aesthetics, as was argued in [Chapter 1](#Ch01.xhtml), is a technical system---one that dictates what we can or cannot see, say or do in any given place, space or environment. In being this way, aesthetics, on the one hand, has played a powerful role in both creating and perpetuating the harmful policies around and models of gender, sexuality (dis)ability, and race. On the other hand, it has created a language for conceptualizing, criticizing, and contesting those very structures. To put it another way, aesthetics is ultimately a technical system. Thus, aesthetics, like the interface, may be limited in its responses and the information it gives to the viewer/participant, as these responses are almost always constrained, but there are limitless possibilities in terms of how we critically deploy, investigate, and explore them.

The following sections look at the work of two new media artists who use the implant as an interface in interactive new media installations: Eduardo Kac's [Time Capsule]{.italic} (1997) and Neil Harbisson's [Internet of Senses]{.italic} (2014).^[24](#Ch07.xhtml#fn7_24){#Ch07.xhtml#bck_fn7_24}^ Kac and Harbisson are not the only new media artists to incorporate implants into their artwork, nor are they the first to experiment with or be inspired by this device. They are two in a []{#Ch07.xhtml#page_150 .pagebreak title="150"}long line of artists who use implants in their work, including, but not limited to, Ron Athey, who has surgical needles implanted through his scalp in his body art performance [4 Scenes in a Harsh Life]{.italic} (1994); ORLAN, who physically replaces parts of her body with those found on women in famous works of art in her radical plastic surgery performance series [The Reincarnation of Sainte-ORLAN]{.italic} (1990--3); and Stelarc's [EAR ON ARM]{.italic} (2007--present), in which he has a human ear surgically attached to his arm, complete with a chip that allows it to "hear," and [Stomach Sculpture]{.italic} (1993), which involves the insertion of a biocompatible sculpture into his stomach as many as six times over a period of two days.^[25](#Ch07.xhtml#fn7_25){#Ch07.xhtml#bck_fn7_25}^

I selected Kac and Harbisson because they showcase humanist myths of wholeness (of the body, of the human) and innocence (of technology) in their work, and, in doing so, they demonstrate the fact that agency and embodiment are not universal concepts. Furthermore, I selected these works because, unlike those created by the artists listed above, they are interactive new media installations.^[26](#Ch07.xhtml#fn7_26){#Ch07.xhtml#bck_fn7_26}^ For example, in [Internet of Senses]{.italic}, Harbisson asked viewer/participants to paint colored stripes on a canvas in Times Square, New York City. These colored stripes were then transmitted live, via the Internet, to Harbisson's Cyborg Antenna, a sensory device implanted in his head. Harbisson received this information and then painted the same color stripes on a canvas at a venue ten blocks away.^[27](#Ch07.xhtml#fn7_27){#Ch07.xhtml#bck_fn7_27}^ In [Time Capsule]{.italic}, the RFID microchip implanted in Kac's ankle must be scanned in order to view the information located on it. Furthermore, viewer/participants as well as journalists and other media figures who attended the installation were not only able to view and interact with the artist (Kac) during the implantation procedure, but they were also able to access, for a short period of time, an online database containing information about the implant.^[28](#Ch07.xhtml#fn7_28){#Ch07.xhtml#bck_fn7_28}^

## [[Support: Agency, Identity, and the Implant]{.bold}](#content.xhtml#bck_sec7_3) {#Ch07.xhtml#sec7_3}

[Time Capsule]{.italic} is a time-based interactive new media installation or, to use Eduardo Kac's words, "a work-experience that lies somewhere between a local event-installation, a site-specific intervention in which the site is both my body and a remote database a live simulcast on TV and the Web, and interactive web scanning of my body."^[29](#Ch07.xhtml#fn7_29){#Ch07.xhtml#bck_fn7_29}^ It consists of a medical professional, seven sepia-toned photographs, and a hospital bed. The hospital bed is surrounded by a variety of technological instruments, including a computer, a telerobotic finger, a microchip scanner, and broadcasting equipment.^[30](#Ch07.xhtml#fn7_30){#Ch07.xhtml#bck_fn7_30}^ All of these entities (the doctor, the medical bed, the broadcasting equipment, the computer) serve as a backdrop for the main event: an implantation procedure. There are two main actors in this installation: the artist (Kac) and a RFID microchip. The RFID microchip consists of a programmed identification number, a coil, and a capacitor. These items are hermetically sealed in biocompatible glass.^[31](#Ch07.xhtml#fn7_31){#Ch07.xhtml#bck_fn7_31}^ Together they form the digital interface in this work: the "time capsule." The time capsule is the digital interface because it mediates relationships as well as interprets and translates information. It also acts as a transparent layer between the processes that bring information into being (the implantation procedure, the various entities located in the installation) and the information itself. By the time the work is finished, the time capsule will be implanted into Kac's ankle and become an implanted interface.

The work starts (and ends) with a basic procedure---Kac cleans the skin around his ankle. He punctures the skin around his ankle with a hypodermic needle. Once punctured, he slides the entire needle subcutaneously to the skin and implants the time

![figs7_1-7_3.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/VDo6DwX.jpeg)

[]{#Ch07.xhtml#page_152 .pagebreak title="152"}capsule.^[32](#Ch07.xhtml#fn7_32){#Ch07.xhtml#bck_fn7_32}^ He then scans the RFID microchip. Scanning the implant remotely via the Internet, Kac writes, "generated a low-energy radio signal (125 KHz) that energized the microchip to transmit its unique and inalterable numerical code (026109532)."^[33](#Ch07.xhtml#fn7_33){#Ch07.xhtml#bck_fn7_33}^ Upon obtaining this data, Kac registers himself, via the Web, on a lost pet database located in the US.^[34](#Ch07.xhtml#fn7_34){#Ch07.xhtml#bck_fn7_34}^ This registration was, according to Kac, "the first instance of a human being added to the database, since this registry was originally designed for identification and recovery of lost animals."^[35](#Ch07.xhtml#fn7_35){#Ch07.xhtml#bck_fn7_35}^ He registers himself on this database as both animal and owner, using his own name, Eduardo Kac.^[36](#Ch07.xhtml#fn7_36){#Ch07.xhtml#bck_fn7_36}^ By both performing the implant procedure and being the receiver of the implant himself, Kac has effectively blurred the distinction between medicine and art as thoroughly as he has blurred the line between animal and human, and human and machine by implanting a RFID microchip in his ankle and registering himself on a lost pet database.

However, more important to [Time Capsule]{.italic} than the blurring of the distinction between species, domains of study, and modes of being is the dynamic that Kac constructs between the interface, the viewer/participant, and the artwork. This dynamic is entered into voluntarily by both Kac, who made a conscious choice to implant the RFID microchip into his body and perform the procedure himself, and by audience members who experienced the installation live in the gallery space in the past and view it remotely from their homes in both the past and the present. Yet, our willingness to voluntarily enter into this dynamic is not easily comparable to the experience of those who have undergone medical implantation procedures. The difference in experience is down to agency and context. By positioning the viewing experience of this work as a matter of agency, I argue that [Time Capsule]{.italic} exposes how aesthetics (as a historical field of vision), technology (the implant), the viewer/participant, and the artist work together to produce objects and subjects. In doing this, it reveals the important role that agency plays in the making and documenting of bodies and identities in representationalist systems of meaning and artworks.

As was argued in [Chapter 1](#Ch01.xhtml), representationalist approaches to artworks are rooted in Cartesian modes of thinking, in that they replicate notions of separation (between the object and subject) and distance (between the viewer/participant and the artwork). Due to the enforced fragmentation that they impose upon reality and that they then take for a supposedly objective picture of the world, these approaches should be regarded, as Karen Barad (2007) states, with suspicion.^[37](#Ch07.xhtml#fn7_37){#Ch07.xhtml#bck_fn7_37}^ Barad continues this line of thought through a close reading of Judith Butler's (1990) critique of representational systems. Simply put, Barad states that representational systems form, define, and reproduce subjects and objects, and they do this "in accordance with the requirements of those structures."^[38](#Ch07.xhtml#fn7_38){#Ch07.xhtml#bck_fn7_38}^ Representationalism then (re)produces subjects and objects, and these subjects and objects reflect the underlying politics or beliefs of the systems, philosophies, and philosophers they represent.^[39](#Ch07.xhtml#fn7_39){#Ch07.xhtml#bck_fn7_39}^ Kac's reliance on representationalist structures of meaning in this installation (the medical bed, equipment, and photographs) suggests that his implant maintains an uneasy relationship with the visual. For example, [Time Capsule]{.italic} is, as mentioned above, a time-based interactive new media installation: it is participatory, generative, ephemeral, and performative. Therefore, the visual records of the implant that it leaves behind (the inalterable numerical code, the entry in the pet database, the scar on Kac's ankle, photographs and written documentation of the actual event) are simply visible signs of deeper, ambiguous unknowns. In leaving behind these visible signs, the distinction between the real and the representational collapse and the implant reveals itself as an []{#Ch07.xhtml#page_153 .pagebreak title="153"}interface. By revealing itself as an interface, a gap is created between the real and the representational, between what one sees, what one is told, and what one knows, and between what the artwork says and what it means. Kac, I posit, exploited this gap and reconfigured (and continually reconfigures through the two "anniversaries" or re-enactments of the piece) new identities for himself: the pet and the pet owner, the doctor and the patient, the artist and the voyeur.^[40](#Ch07.xhtml#fn7_40){#Ch07.xhtml#bck_fn7_40}^

How Kac created these identities and reconfigured notions of the self in his artwork is akin to the way they are created and reconfigured by users of contemporary wearable devices. Deborah Lupton (2016) provides a detailed history of wearable devices, self-tracking technologies and the practices and cultures that surround them. She theorizes the concept of self-tracking as a "practice of self-hood that conforms to cultural expectations concerning self-awareness, reflection and taking responsibility for managing and governing oneself and improving one's life chances."^[41](#Ch07.xhtml#fn7_41){#Ch07.xhtml#bck_fn7_41}^ Practices of self-tracking are similar to those found in new media arts communities in the sense that both cultures view the human body as a place of experimentation.^[42](#Ch07.xhtml#fn7_42){#Ch07.xhtml#bck_fn7_42}^ However, the representations of the body and of the self that self-tracking cultures produce, she writes, are less about disembodiment (as they sometimes were in the early cyberarts communities of the 1990s, as was discussed in the previous chapter) and more about creating symbolic representations of the body through technological augmentations and/or extensions. Given this, self-tracking technologies, she posits, can be understood as a type of "prosthetics of selfhood."^[43](#Ch07.xhtml#fn7_43){#Ch07.xhtml#bck_fn7_43}^ For Lupton, the phrase prosthetics of selfhood refers to the way in which technological prosthesis renders self-extension possible and aids in the constitution of identities. However, there is, she writes, "a doubling of technological prosthetics that occurs in the use of digital technologies for self-tracking."^[44](#Ch07.xhtml#fn7_44){#Ch07.xhtml#bck_fn7_44}^ First, she states that wearable technologies, like smartphones and their apps, are technological prostheses, in that they extend and expand the human body into space and time. These technological prostheses, she argues, "in turn generate datalogical prostheses" through the creation of biological data about the user.^[45](#Ch07.xhtml#fn7_45){#Ch07.xhtml#bck_fn7_45}^ Concepts of embodiment, identity, and the self are then performed by the user "both by engaging with, carrying or wearing a self-tracking device (acts that symbolize a certain type of self: the self-tracking self) and by generating personal data that can be used in certain specific ways as part of the project of selfhood and embodiment."^[46](#Ch07.xhtml#fn7_46){#Ch07.xhtml#bck_fn7_46}^

The same logic, I posit, is at work in [Time Capsule.]{.italic} For example, the implant could be understood as a "prosthetics of selfhood," in that it renders self-extension possible and aids in the constitution of identities. In [Time Capsule]{.italic}, self-extension occurs through the ability of the RFID microchip to be scanned via the Internet as well as Kac's registration on the lost pet database. Concepts of embodiment, identity, and the self are then quite literally performed by Kac in the gallery through the implantation process, which was broadcast live on television by Brazilian TV station Canal 21 and online via a webcast produced by the gallery that hosted the installation, Casa da Rosas, and through the RFID's ability to generate data (the inalterable numerical code).^[47](#Ch07.xhtml#fn7_47){#Ch07.xhtml#bck_fn7_47}^ In this way, Kac's implant not only acts as a bodily prosthesis, extending him into space and time, but also expands his embodied presence, placing him within a network of other bodies and objects, effectively blurring the spatial boundaries between the public and private spheres and the self and the other, while also projecting seemingly private events, like medical surgery and biological data, out into public domains.

## [[]{#Ch07.xhtml#page_154 .pagebreak title="154"} [Mediate: The Social "Time Capsule"]{.bold}](#content.xhtml#bck_sec7_4) {#Ch07.xhtml#sec7_4}

The implant in [Time Capsule]{.italic} not only aids in the creation of different notions of embodiment and identity and reconfigures concepts of the self, but also preserves older identities and concepts of the body and the self. In being this way, I argue that Kac's implant takes on the characteristics of an archive. But what exactly is an archive? And what does it mean in relation to the use of the implant in interactive new media installations? The term "archive," according to Achille Mbembe (2002), "first refers to a building, a symbol of public institution, which is one of the organs of a constituted state."^[48](#Ch07.xhtml#fn7_48){#Ch07.xhtml#bck_fn7_48}^ It is also understood as "a collection of documents---normally written documents---kept in this building."^[49](#Ch07.xhtml#fn7_49){#Ch07.xhtml#bck_fn7_49}^ One of the main purposes of an archive, he continues, is to preserve documents.^[50](#Ch07.xhtml#fn7_50){#Ch07.xhtml#bck_fn7_50}^ To summarize the archival preservation process: once received, documents are placed in a system that facilitates identification and interpretation through the processes of codification, classification, and distribution. Part of this process entails deciding what documents are deemed worthy, or not, of being preserved. Once preserved, users are then granted access to some, but not all, of these documents.^[51](#Ch07.xhtml#fn7_51){#Ch07.xhtml#bck_fn7_51}^ That is to say, some information located in the archive is revealed to and some information is concealed from the user. Since it collects, preserves, conceals, and reveals information, an archive, as Mbembe argues, is "primarily the product of a judgement, the result of the exercise of a specific power and authority, which involves placing certain documents in an archive at the same time as others are discarded."^[52](#Ch07.xhtml#fn7_52){#Ch07.xhtml#bck_fn7_52}^ So, which identities and concepts of the body and the self are preserved, and which ones are discarded in [Time Capsule]{.italic}?

As mentioned above, [Time Capsule]{.italic} contains seven sepia-toned photographs. The photographs were shot in the 1930s and contain images of Kac's grandmother.^[53](#Ch07.xhtml#fn7_53){#Ch07.xhtml#bck_fn7_53}^ In these images, Kac's grandmother is posing in a kayak, sitting on a motorcycle, and smiling with family and friends.^[54](#Ch07.xhtml#fn7_54){#Ch07.xhtml#bck_fn7_54}^ The photographs, according to Kac, are family mementos---they are some of the few possessions his grandmother was able to take with her when she fled Poland in the 1930s.^[55](#Ch07.xhtml#fn7_55){#Ch07.xhtml#bck_fn7_55}^ These photographs preserve memories as well as provide documentation (of Kac's family history, of a specific place, time, and person) and act as modes of identification and interpretation. In his writings on this work, Kac argues that the documentation and identification of humans has been "one of the main thrusts of technological development, particularly in the area of imaging, from the first photograph to ubiquitous video surveillance."^[56](#Ch07.xhtml#fn7_56){#Ch07.xhtml#bck_fn7_56}^ He continues by stating that throughout the "nineteenth and twentieth centuries, photography and its adjacent imaging tools functioned as a social time capsule, enabling the collective preservation of our social bodies."^[57](#Ch07.xhtml#fn7_57){#Ch07.xhtml#bck_fn7_57}^ His implant, he writes, performs a similar operation: it acts as a "social time capsule" and enables the preservation of his social body.^[58](#Ch07.xhtml#fn7_58){#Ch07.xhtml#bck_fn7_58}^

I agree with Kac's assertions regarding technology and the important role it performs in the collective preservation of our social bodies and the future potential that he believes the implant, as archive, may play in this process. As his words suggest, memory and remembering are a central feature of his implant and of archives in general. However, I argue that notions of erasure and forgetting are just as important to the implant's role as archive as notions of memory and remembering. For example, the purpose of an archive, as mentioned above, is to preserve information and grant access to this information to users. What information is preserved in an archive, deemed important, revealed to the user, and remembered, and what information is left []{#Ch07.xhtml#page_155 .pagebreak title="155"}out, deemed unimportant, and concealed from the user, and thus forgotten, is dependent on the context. Concealment and erasure of information happens because some information is deemed unimportant to the archive (a doorknob in an archive about windows) or because it does not fit the story that the institution holding or building the archive wants to tell (the erasure of information about atrocities in archives used in nation-building exercises or medical histories). Thus, it could be argued that archives are ideological nature, in the sense that they are used in some cases to distort reality. However, how does the ideological nature of the archive manifest itself through the implant in interactive new media installations like [Time Capsule]{.italic}? And what do the notions of erasure and invisibility embedded in the archive mean with regard to concepts of agency, identity, and the self in these environments?

Archives, according to Rebecca Schneider (2001), are Western constructs and are thus habitual to Western culture.^[59](#Ch07.xhtml#fn7_59){#Ch07.xhtml#bck_fn7_59}^ She continues by stating that we use archives as a way of understanding ourselves "relative to the remains we accumulate, the tracks we house, mark and cite and the material traces we acknowledge."^[60](#Ch07.xhtml#fn7_60){#Ch07.xhtml#bck_fn7_60}^ From within the context of time-based artworks, like interactive new media installations (or theater in Schneider's article), the issue of remains as material documents becomes complicated because these works deal with live bodies and time-based performance.

Schneider continues, stating that in "scholarly treatments the question of the performance remains of history" versus written or object based remains generally fall under the rubric of ritual.^[61](#Ch07.xhtml#fn7_61){#Ch07.xhtml#bck_fn7_61}^ Oral histories like the one that Kac is attempting to capture, to an extent, in [Time Capsule]{.italic} fall under the rubric of ritual as well.^[62](#Ch07.xhtml#fn7_62){#Ch07.xhtml#bck_fn7_62}^ Oral history and other performative practices, Schneider tells us, are always repeated; thus, "oral historical practices, are always reconstructive, always incomplete."^[63](#Ch07.xhtml#fn7_63){#Ch07.xhtml#bck_fn7_63}^ Given this, she concludes that in performance, as well as in oral history, "the pristine sameness of an original, so valued by the archive is rendered impossible---or if you will, mythic."^[64](#Ch07.xhtml#fn7_64){#Ch07.xhtml#bck_fn7_64}^

The notion of the archive as in the preservation of the "original object" is shifting in favor of what Schneider refers to as "a 'new' history that incorporates collective memory and performative practices."^[65](#Ch07.xhtml#fn7_65){#Ch07.xhtml#bck_fn7_65}^ The oral in these archives, she writes, "is not approached as [already]{.italic} an archive" in the way that human remains or physical art objects are.^[66](#Ch07.xhtml#fn7_66){#Ch07.xhtml#bck_fn7_66}^ Rather, oral histories, she tells us, "are constituted a new, recorded and 'saved' in the name of identicality and materiality."^[67](#Ch07.xhtml#fn7_67){#Ch07.xhtml#bck_fn7_67}^ However, she writes that when we approach performative practices not as things that disappear (as the traditional archive expects), but as both the act of remaining and a means of re-appearance, then the archive takes on a different character---it becomes an act of remembering.^[68](#Ch07.xhtml#fn7_68){#Ch07.xhtml#bck_fn7_68}^ Following on from Schneider, I argue that Kac's implant is not about preserving or monitoring the biological, or the display of bodies or art objects. It is not about collecting and curating memories, but rather is about recollecting and, to an extent, performing different bodies and modes of being. However, what does recollection mean in relation to the archive? In relation to the body? In relation to the implant? And in relation to the concepts of agency, identity, and the self? I believe the answer to some of these questions lies in the way that the implant is used in [Time Capsule]{.italic}. For example, by taking an interface (a technical device that records, reveals, and conceals information), implanting it in his body (a biomedical procedure that alters, to an extent, the human body), broadcasting it to the world for brief periods of time (via the live television transmission, the webcast, and the anniversaries that he celebrates), and then turning it into an archive, Kac places the relationship between aesthetics, the []{#Ch07.xhtml#page_156 .pagebreak title="156"}body, and the interface squarely in the context of power relations. In doing this, he reconfigures notions of identity and the self, focusing not only on what is remembered and forgotten, but on what these acts of remembering may mean for our relationship with technology in interactive new media art installations.

## [[Enhance: Performing the Visible Invisible]{.bold}](#content.xhtml#bck_sec7_5) {#Ch07.xhtml#sec7_5}

On August 27, 2014, Neil Harbisson performed "the world's first skull-transmitted painting."^[69](#Ch07.xhtml#fn7_69){#Ch07.xhtml#bck_fn7_69}^ First-hand accounts of the actual performance are scant, but based on the available documentation, it went something like this: viewer/participants located somewhere in Times Square, New York City were asked to paint simple colored stripes onto a canvas.^[70](#Ch07.xhtml#fn7_70){#Ch07.xhtml#bck_fn7_70}^ Their actions were recorded and sent live, via Skype, ten blocks away from the performance venue (the Hyphen Hub at the Red Door in New York City), where they were projected onto a wall. Viewer/participant actions were also transmitted live, via Skype, to a chip located in Harbisson's brain.^[71](#Ch07.xhtml#fn7_71){#Ch07.xhtml#bck_fn7_71}^ Once received by the chip, Harbisson was able to correctly identify and paint the exact same colored stripes onto canvases in Hyphen Hub that were being painted in Times Square. He did all of this in front of a live audience, without turning around to view the projections on the wall.^[72](#Ch07.xhtml#fn7_72){#Ch07.xhtml#bck_fn7_72}^ The chip located in his brain that received this information and allowed him to create this artwork is one part of a bespoke implant which is osseointegrated into his skull. He calls this implant a Cyborg Antenna.^[73](#Ch07.xhtml#fn7_73){#Ch07.xhtml#bck_fn7_73}^

A Cyborg Antenna consists of a wireless camera and a wireless sound vibration implant. The camera and sound vibration implant are located at different ends and are physically connected to each other through a flexible adjustable shaft.^[74](#Ch07.xhtml#fn7_74){#Ch07.xhtml#bck_fn7_74}^ It works as follows: a chip located in the Antenna receives information. Audible vibrations in the skull then transmit this information to the receiver---usually the implantee.^[75](#Ch07.xhtml#fn7_75){#Ch07.xhtml#bck_fn7_75}^ Aesthetically, Harbisson's Antenna resembles bodily extensions and implants found in science fiction and cyberpunk body modification subcultures. It is visually pleasing; it is metallic and elegant. It rises out of his upper occipital bone, curves around the top of his head, and dips down over his forehead. Its endpoint is punctuated by the presence of a camera. The Antenna has been permanently attached to Harbisson's head since 2004; it was surgically implanted in 2014.^[76](#Ch07.xhtml#fn7_76){#Ch07.xhtml#bck_fn7_76}^ Explaining the actual implantation process Harbisson underwent is slightly difficult. This difficulty is due to the fact that the surgery was repeatedly rejected by bioethical committees and had to be "done underground."^[77](#Ch07.xhtml#fn7_77){#Ch07.xhtml#bck_fn7_77}^ Harbisson briefly explained the process to Vice Motherboard's UK editor Victoria Turk (2014). Harbisson's Antenna, Turk states, "is embedded in the occipital bone at the back of his head, with a separate hole for audio input---essentially, a jack drilled into his skull that transmits sound into his head through bone conduction."^[78](#Ch07.xhtml#fn7_78){#Ch07.xhtml#bck_fn7_78}^ In order to implant the device, she writes, "they \[medical professionals\] had to remove a patch of his \[Harbisson's\] hair permanently to reduce infection, and reduce the thickness of the skin."^[79](#Ch07.xhtml#fn7_79){#Ch07.xhtml#bck_fn7_79}^ The skin was then opened and holes were drilled in Harbisson's head: one hole for the Antenna and one hole for the audio entry.

The brief description of Harbisson's performance and the Cyborg Antenna provided above raises interesting questions around the foundations on which the interface is based. For example, as has been repeated throughout this book, interfaces are ultimately technological devices. When these technical devices are inserted into the human body and become an implant, they begin to form the material basis for []{#Ch07.xhtml#page_157 .pagebreak title="157"}experiencing the physical world. They organize, enhance, and constrain our interactions with other human and non-human entities, and thus they shape, to an extent, notions of subjectivity as well as affective and bodily experience. So, what is conceptually at stake when the interface (the technological) is literally implanted into a human body (the biological)? In order to explore this question, my inquiry into the implant will require a discussion of the rhetoric that surrounds the use of the implant in interactive new media installations. In particular, I will look at how Harbisson's Cyborg Antenna, or more specifically the techno-utopian rhetoric that surrounds it, remediates historical and conceptual Western techno-scientific discourses of the body and its relationship with technology. My focus will be on how the rhetoric used to describe the Cyborg Antenna reinforces Cartesian notions of the body and technology---specifically the problematic concepts of the disembodiment of the human and the notion of transcendence---as was discussed in [Chapters 2](#Ch02.xhtml), [5](#Ch05.xhtml) and [6](#Ch06.xhtml).^[80](#Ch07.xhtml#fn7_80){#Ch07.xhtml#bck_fn7_80}^

Concepts of disembodiment and transcendence, as mentioned earlier, are worrisome because they render the human body as excess "meat" and treat human consciousness as something separate from, and/or more important than, the human form. These concepts, when applied to the use of interfaces in interactive new media installations, have their roots in Norbert Wiener's cybernetic paradigm of power and control, as has been discussed throughout this book. They also inform what Bernadette Wegenstien (2012), drawing on the work of Patrizia Magli (1989), calls the "physiognomic perception" of the body.^[81](#Ch07.xhtml#fn7_81){#Ch07.xhtml#bck_fn7_81}^ The phrase "physiognomic perception" for Wegenstien refers to the late eighteenth-century practices of physiognomy developed by Johann Kaspar Lavater (1741--1801).^[82](#Ch07.xhtml#fn7_82){#Ch07.xhtml#bck_fn7_82}^ These practices involve, in short, assessing a subject's inner character or personality, based on her outer appearance---specifically the face. Physiognomy is highly problematic for many reasons, the most glaring being that these practices attempt to produce scientific theories of the body by linking personality traits (kindness, holiness, depravity) to facial traits (the size a nose, the width of a forehead).^[83](#Ch07.xhtml#fn7_83){#Ch07.xhtml#bck_fn7_83}^ Thus, physiognomy has been, and still is, used as a basis for scientific racism and other forms of discrimination.^[84](#Ch07.xhtml#fn7_84){#Ch07.xhtml#bck_fn7_84}^ Physiognomic practices are implicated in racism and other forms of discrimination because, as Wegenstien writes, they created a code for understanding the world as well as a "moralizing gaze---a way of looking at bodies as awaiting a physical and spiritual improvement that is present in the body's structure as an absence or a need."^[85](#Ch07.xhtml#fn7_85){#Ch07.xhtml#bck_fn7_85}^ Wegenstien continues by arguing that physiognomy laid the groundwork for a concept of the modern body that positioned human bodies as "the effect and object of medical examination ... as an object that could be abused, transformed, subjugated."^[86](#Ch07.xhtml#fn7_86){#Ch07.xhtml#bck_fn7_86}^ As mentioned above, practices of physiognomy---specifically, the split between the inside and the outside of the body that it creates---also inform Cartesian intellectual traditions of disembodiment and transcendence. So, how do Harbisson's claims about the body, about the implant, and about art remediate, or not, the problematic notions of the body and technology briefly discussed above? And how does this remediation affect the key concepts of agency, subjectivity, identity, and the self in interactive new media installations?

In interviews and other writings, Harbisson has outlined a posthumanist vision of utopian high-tech body modification-based installation works, or "Cyborg art." Cyborg art, for Harbisson, is an "art movement where artists create their own senses by merging cybernetics with their own organism."^[87](#Ch07.xhtml#fn7_87){#Ch07.xhtml#bck_fn7_87}^ In his vision of Cyborg art, implants, like the Cyborg Antenna, are not simply life decisions; they are, to use his []{#Ch07.xhtml#page_158 .pagebreak title="158"}words, an "artistic statement ... I am treating my own body and brain as a sculpture."^[88](#Ch07.xhtml#fn7_88){#Ch07.xhtml#bck_fn7_88}^ He does not discuss the ideological underpinnings of his art, focusing instead on the futuristic possibilities that he sees the Cyborg Antenna bringing about and the impact that they may have on fine arts-based practices. These possibilities revolve around neurological reconfigurations of the senses and the effects that these reconfigurations have on notions of creativity. Thus, the actual ideological underpinnings of the Cyborg art movement remain to be explored.

In order to uncover the ideological underpinnings of this movement, first one needs to understand how Harbisson's lived experience contributes to his art. Harbisson was born with "achromatopsia, a congenital condition where cone cells in the eyes are unable to register color."^[89](#Ch07.xhtml#fn7_89){#Ch07.xhtml#bck_fn7_89}^ His achromatopsia served as the impetus for the development of the Cyborg Antenna. In 2003, he met Adam Montadon, at Dartington College of Arts, and together they began collaborating on the first prototype of the Cyborg Antenna---the Eyeborg.^[90](#Ch07.xhtml#fn7_90){#Ch07.xhtml#bck_fn7_90}^ The aim of this collaboration, Harbisson writes, was to "extend my color perception to the level of other humans."^[91](#Ch07.xhtml#fn7_91){#Ch07.xhtml#bck_fn7_91}^ In order to accomplish this, Montadon created software that transposed colors to sound. At the same time, Harbisson started wearing a camera on his head, which was connected to a 5-kilo computer that Harbisson carried on his back.^[92](#Ch07.xhtml#fn7_92){#Ch07.xhtml#bck_fn7_92}^ Harbisson also wore headphones so he could "hear the colors" that the software generated.^[93](#Ch07.xhtml#fn7_93){#Ch07.xhtml#bck_fn7_93}^ At first, as he tells it, he had to memorize the sounds of each color, "but after some time this information became subliminal, I didn't have to think about the notes, color became a perception. And after some months, color became a feeling."^[94](#Ch07.xhtml#fn7_94){#Ch07.xhtml#bck_fn7_94}^ He continued "upgrading" his sense of color, and by 2010, he was no longer using a backpack to carry around a computer. Instead, he had a computer chip attached to the back of his skull, which sent sound directly to his occipital bone.^[95](#Ch07.xhtml#fn7_95){#Ch07.xhtml#bck_fn7_95}^

The current, permanent version of the Antenna, Harbisson states, allows him to feel and hear colors as audio vibrations.^[96](#Ch07.xhtml#fn7_96){#Ch07.xhtml#bck_fn7_96}^ Thus, he claims that it allows him to expand his "perception of light and sound beyond traditional senses and beyond earth."^[97](#Ch07.xhtml#fn7_97){#Ch07.xhtml#bck_fn7_97}^ He also believes that the Antenna has helped him develop new senses. For example, he claims that one of the side-effects of the link between sound and light that the Antenna creates allows him to perceive things in infrared and ultraviolet.^[98](#Ch07.xhtml#fn7_98){#Ch07.xhtml#bck_fn7_98}^ This ability to see in infrared and ultraviolet means that he can "create \[art\] works that only bees can see."^[99](#Ch07.xhtml#fn7_99){#Ch07.xhtml#bck_fn7_99}^ Furthermore, he feels that the Antenna and his bone have "merged" post-surgery.^[100](#Ch07.xhtml#fn7_100){#Ch07.xhtml#bck_fn7_100}^ He attributes this feeling, in part, to the permanent nature of the implant. No longer an exterior device tacked on to his head, he considers the Antenna to be an integral physical extension of his body---one that he can feel, sense, and, to an extent, see with. As he writes, "if someone touches the tip of the Antenna, I can feel it as if someone was touching my teeth or my nails. My sense of balance has also been altered, I feel out of balance if the Antenna is not straight."^[101](#Ch07.xhtml#fn7_101){#Ch07.xhtml#bck_fn7_101}^ The Cyborg Antenna, as mentioned above, is implanted in his head. He claims that it expands his perception of light and sound, and acts as an extension of his physical body. Thus, the Antenna could be considered to be an implanted interface---one he uses not only in his artwork, but also in his everyday life.

The permanent nature of the Antenna, combined with the extra senses that Harbisson believes the device has given him, has created a change in his sense of self and identity. For example, he states that he "no longer feels 100% human";^[102](#Ch07.xhtml#fn7_102){#Ch07.xhtml#bck_fn7_102}^ instead, he identifies as Cyborg and as transpecies.^[103](#Ch07.xhtml#fn7_103){#Ch07.xhtml#bck_fn7_103}^ As he writes: "The antenna is a new body part and the chip an extension of my brain. I don't feel I'm using technology, I don't []{#Ch07.xhtml#page_159 .pagebreak title="159"}feel I'm wearing technology, I feel I am technology. I feel I am a cyborg."^[104](#Ch07.xhtml#fn7_104){#Ch07.xhtml#bck_fn7_104}^ He uses the word "Cyborg" in specific reference to Manfred Clynes and Nathan Kline's (1960) conceptualization of the Cyborg. Clynes and Kline deploy the word "Cyborg" in the context of space travel, defining it, in short, as a "self-regulating man-machine."^[105](#Ch07.xhtml#fn7_105){#Ch07.xhtml#bck_fn7_105}^ They state that a Cyborg is a human who "deliberately incorporates exogenous components extending the self-regulatory control function of the organism in order to adapt it to new environments."^[106](#Ch07.xhtml#fn7_106){#Ch07.xhtml#bck_fn7_106}^ These components may include "suitable biochemical, physiological and electronic modifications."^[107](#Ch07.xhtml#fn7_107){#Ch07.xhtml#bck_fn7_107}^ While not situated in the context of space travel, the Cyborg becomings that Harbisson states he is undergoing echo Clynes and Kline's description above.

For example, like Clynes and Kline, Harbisson cites "cybernetics" as the main reason why he has become a Cyborg.^[108](#Ch07.xhtml#fn7_108){#Ch07.xhtml#bck_fn7_108}^ He also provides a brief description of the biological, neurological, and psychological processes he has undergone to become a Cyborg. Again, these processes echo the rhetoric found in Clynes and Kline's definition above---specifically, their references to the biochemical, physiological, and electronic modifications needed to become a Cyborg. For instance, Harbisson believes that his Antenna has allowed him to become a Cyborg in a biological, neurological, and psychological sense. He has become a biological Cyborg because his body has physically changed because of cybernetics (the chip and Antenna implanted in his brain).^[109](#Ch07.xhtml#fn7_109){#Ch07.xhtml#bck_fn7_109}^ He is a neurological Cyborg because "his brain has changed due to cybernetics."^[110](#Ch07.xhtml#fn7_110){#Ch07.xhtml#bck_fn7_110}^ And, finally, he has become a psychological Cyborg because his sense of being, his identity, has changed because of cybernetics.^[111](#Ch07.xhtml#fn7_111){#Ch07.xhtml#bck_fn7_111}^ Harbisson's notion here is that the blurring of the boundaries between the biological and the technical that his implant has brought about has resulted in the creation of a hybrid or Cyborgian self. This Cyborgian self presents a challenge to notions of the body, identity, and the self as stable and purely biological things, positioning them instead as in flux and open to change. In positioning these notions as being in flux and open to change, this blurring, for Harbisson, also implies a breakdown in the representational systems that regulate the meanings around and identifications of the body and the self, as discussed earlier.

I agree with some of Harbisson's statements offered above---specifically his statements around concepts of the body, identity, and the self as being in flux and open to change. However, I find his notion of hybridity when applied to the implant in interactive new media installations slightly troubling. This is because his figuration of his hybrid self assumes intentionality and suggests, among other things, that identities are produced, and thus become, hybrid forms through some sort of start-to-finish technological production process. In other words, I am arguing that by attributing the change in his sense of being and his identity to "cybernetics" (i.e. technology), Harbisson is conflating the open-ended nature of technological production and human interaction---processes that Barad (2007) argues are dynamic, complex, and "continually reworked as a result of human, non-human and Cyborgian forms of agency"---with Fordist assembly line-like repetitions and maintenance of fixed mechanical processes.^[112](#Ch07.xhtml#fn7_112){#Ch07.xhtml#bck_fn7_112}^ In doing this, identity becomes normalized and, to an extent, universalized within modes of production. Thus, the human and the non-human, their individual agencies and subjectivities, the differences between and their similarities to each other in Harbisson's description of his Cyborg self are sanitized and collapsed into a singular reified object (the Cyborg Antenna), stripping away any possibility of hybridity from his newfound identity, other than the rhetorical performance of it.

## [[]{#Ch07.xhtml#page_160 .pagebreak title="160"} [Remediate: Disembodiment, Transcendence, and the Implant]{.bold}](#content.xhtml#bck_sec7_6) {#Ch07.xhtml#sec7_6}

Harbisson's experience with his implant has been, for the most part, positive and empowering. His life, he tells us, "has changed dramatically" since implanting the Antenna.^[113](#Ch07.xhtml#fn7_113){#Ch07.xhtml#bck_fn7_113}^ The Antenna has aided in the reconfiguration of notions of the self and the creation of new identities, as discussed above. Furthermore, Harbisson feels that the socio-cultural problems that come with achromatopsia that he encountered in the past, such as conceptualizing and talking about color, have, to an extent, dissipated. Art galleries, he tells us, "have become concert halls; I can hear a Picasso or a Rothko. I also found out that things I thought were colorless are not colorless at all."^[114](#Ch07.xhtml#fn7_114){#Ch07.xhtml#bck_fn7_114}^ The press has salivated over Harbisson's artwork, even more so over the novelty of his implant. Because of his self-defined status as a Cyborg, and the ontological implications of a body constantly under construction, he has become a media trope for posthuman subjectivity and identity. Articles entitled "The Man Who Hears Color" and "World's First Cyborg Wants to Hack Your Body" have been published in media outlets like the BBC, Al Jazeera, the [New York Times, The Guardian]{.italic}, and CNN.^[115](#Ch07.xhtml#fn7_115){#Ch07.xhtml#bck_fn7_115}^ The authors of these articles reiterate, to an extent, Harbisson's techno-utopian outlook on his implant and their rhetoric is just as bound up in Cyborg-speak as Harbisson's texts. In the rush to marvel at Harbisson's artwork, some of these authors fail to consider the pressing issues related to agency that underlie the use of the implant in interactive new media installations.

As noted earlier, Harbisson was born with a genetic condition and voluntarily underwent medical surgery in an attempt to "correct" his condition. In other words, he was not pressured, by medical doctors, to get his implant to standardize his body or senses of cognition---in fact, the opposite occurred, as mentioned above. Rather, he voluntarily [chose]{.italic} to have a Cyborg Antenna implanted into his head. Not only did he have a choice with regard to his implantation, he also had input in the aesthetic and technical make-up of his interface. He designed it look arty---unusual, yet benign---TED Talk-friendly, if you will.^[116](#Ch07.xhtml#fn7_116){#Ch07.xhtml#bck_fn7_116}^ Many of these options are not available to, or desired by, people with non-normative bodies and embodiments. By not addressing the notion of choice, Harbisson's rhetoric overlooks insights from critical race and critical disability studies discussed above on technology, normative regimes, and the impact they have on experiences of agency and embodiment. Finally, his descriptions of his implant in his work are utopian (implants make people better forever; implants help you make better art); universalizing (he positions his positive experiences with his implant as a normal one; he makes it seem like anybody can become a Cyborg, regardless of access to, or the affordability of, technology); and paternalistic (he uses the words "we" and "our" interchangeably with the words "me" and "I"). Thus, I argue that Harbisson's Cyborg Antenna, and by default his artwork and Cyborgian identity, could be seen as a rationalist project of self-development and self-discovery rather than a critical exploration of different modes of being and hybrid identities.

However, more troubling than the utopian and universalizing tenor of Harbisson's writings are the progressive developmental narratives of technology he promotes in his artwork. The phrase "progressive developmental narrative of technology," as mentioned in [Chapter 5](#Ch05.xhtml), refers to claims made in some scholarly texts that media technologies are said to evolve, or progress, in a straight line.^[117](#Ch07.xhtml#fn7_117){#Ch07.xhtml#bck_fn7_117}^ When applied to Harbisson's Cyborg Antenna, this evolution entails the progression from a medical instrument used to correct a condition, to a symbolic object used to help him create []{#Ch07.xhtml#page_161 .pagebreak title="161"}art, to an abstract, implanted interface that has reconfigured his identity and sense of being. These narratives are of grave concern because they create false divisions and binary and oppositional thinking (old vs. new, subject vs. object, virtual vs. material), as has been discussed in the previous chapters, and presume normative and shared assumptions about the body, identity, and the self. Furthermore, Harbisson is employing them to promote notions of disembodiment and transcendence.

Take, for instance, Harbisson's claims around notions of identity and the self. He believes, as mentioned above, that his Antenna has changed the way he thinks about himself---it has allowed him to become a Cyborg in a biological, neurological, and psychological sense. He has become a neurological Cyborg because his "brain has changed due to cybernetics."^[118](#Ch07.xhtml#fn7_118){#Ch07.xhtml#bck_fn7_118}^ Part of this neurological cybernetic change is because his Cyborg Antenna has an Internet connection, which allows him to receive images and/or sounds directly in his head. This connection allows him to create art, as mentioned above. This chip also has another function: it allows him to transcend time and space. For example, Harbisson claims that he can now connect his head "to Satellites and to telescopes and perceive and extend my senses to space."^[119](#Ch07.xhtml#fn7_119){#Ch07.xhtml#bck_fn7_119}^ He writes that the fact that he can connect to satellites in space means that "our senses no longer need to be where our bodies are."^[120](#Ch07.xhtml#fn7_120){#Ch07.xhtml#bck_fn7_120}^ Thus, he believes that the next stage of human/technological exploration is "to investigate the disconnection between body and senses; and to start traveling without our bodies. Instead of going through the uncomfortable pain of traveling we could send our senses to space, 3D-print ourselves in other planets and explore space while lying in bed."^[121](#Ch07.xhtml#fn7_121){#Ch07.xhtml#bck_fn7_121}^ Here Harbisson is stating that in order become a Cyborg, we must separate our bodies from our minds and transcend our human physical forms. In addition, he claims that his implant will allow him to circumvent, to an extent, death. As he writes: "In theory, the older you get the more your body and senses degenerate. This theory is reversed if you become a Cyborg. If you have cybernetic body parts, these will get better and better the older you get as your body parts will evolve together with the evolution of technology."^[122](#Ch07.xhtml#fn7_122){#Ch07.xhtml#bck_fn7_122}^ Thus, for Harbisson, becoming a Cyborg not only suggests a change in thinking around identity or identification, but also implies immortality.

However, stating, as Harbisson does, that becoming a Cyborg implies disembodiment, transcendence, and immortality presents some difficulties with regard to my theorization of the digital interface in interactive new media installations as an ongoing and dynamic process, as it suggests some sort of ontological end to our human bodies (but not our minds). It also presents problems in relation to my theorization of the relationship between the body, technology, and identity as co-constitutive. This is because Harbisson's theorization of his Cyborg self is constituted on the basis of a false separation between the body and the mind. This separation, as has been mentioned throughout this book, is troublesome because it has led to the devaluation of body and the biological in favor of technology and the technological. The devaluation of the biological, in lieu of the technological as well as the separation of the body from the mind, suggests, among other things, that humans lack agency. Humans can never be, and have never been, separate from technology, as previously believed. Nor do biological entities lack agency, because humans are fundamentally constituted by, through, and with technology (although, as pointed out earlier, agency can be limited or compromised through the disciplinary practices and regimes imposed on them by the implant). Thus, I suggest that Harbisson's implant and Cyborg identity not only suggest that a linear change in technology (the move from external to internal or []{#Ch07.xhtml#page_162 .pagebreak title="162"}implanted interface) will cause a (positive and progressive) change in culture and society, but also remediate, and thus promote, problematic notions of technological disembodiment, transcendence, universality, and immortality.

## [In Conclusion]{.bold} {#Ch07.xhtml#sec7_7}

It is clear from my analysis above that Harbisson is struggling to make sense of the techno-utopian promises of the implanted interface, and new interfacial technology in general: the promise to make our lives better, easier, and create positive change in the world. One result of this struggle is the remediation of notions of disembodiment, transcendence, universality, and immortality found in his writings and practice. By critically examining his writings and practice, we can see how his thinking about the relationship between the body, technology, and aesthetics is both oddly prescient and deeply misguided. For example, the claims of sameness (between the human and the machine), disembodiment (of the subject), and transcendence that his texts and practice promote are problematic and, in some cases, harmful to people with non-normative bodies and embodiment. This is because these claims reiterate the cybernetic paradigm of control as well as notions of human domination and exceptionalism. However, he is correct when he states that communication and interaction between human and non-human entities are of critical importance, and we can appreciate, to an extent, the liberatory potential and possibilities his reconfiguration of notions of identity and the self as a mixture of human and the machine has with regard to notions of the body, agency, and embodiment. The implanted interface in interactive new media installations does not end where the body begins, but emerges out of both the reconfiguration of the relationship between the body and technology, and the ongoing process by which the artwork, cultural meanings, and interactions are collectively created and questioned. Thus, it opens up new possibilities for resistance and intervention to normative and shared assumptions about the body, identity, and the self. In this way, I suggest that interactive new media installations offer an important and much-needed critical perspective on the implanted interface---one that seeks to challenge the hegemony of humanist and medicalized models of the body that underlie theories of the relationship between the body and technology by intervening in normative assumptions concerning the interface. As seen above, critically questioning, and then challenging and intervening in the dominant narratives that surround our relationship with technology, complicates the picture of how new technologies like implanted interfaces work in the world. Implanted interfaces do nothing by themselves, but once they become part of our artwork, communities, and everyday lives, they become part of our discourse. Thus, they become invested with the power to open up and make different things visible, but also to constrain, close down on, and erase possibilities, modes of interaction, and communication. Interactive new media installations, I argue, are invaluable in this respect because, in being artworks, they call attention to themselves, so they allow us to critically evaluate the principal claims and question the foundations on which the concept of the implanted interface is based.

On Sunday, November 25, 2018, a flurry of emails appeared in my inbox from friends and family across the globe. The emails all contained a link to an article from [The Guardian]{.italic} entitled: "Revealed: Faulty Medical Implants Harm Patients Around World."^[1](#Ch08.xhtml#fn8_1){#Ch08.xhtml#bck_fn8_1}^ The article, which is part of [The Guardian]{.italic}'s investigative series ominously entitled "The Implant Files," documents the contemporary use of medical implants, the biomedical industry that produces them, and the regulatory bodies that surround them.^[2](#Ch08.xhtml#fn8_2){#Ch08.xhtml#bck_fn8_2}^ Their findings are not positive; their portrayal of the organizations that regulate the industry that surrounds implants is particularly damning. "Patients around the world", the article begins, "are suffering pain and many have died as a result of faulty medical devices that have been allowed on to the market by a system dogged by poor regulation, lax rules of testing and a lack of transparency."^[3](#Ch08.xhtml#fn8_3){#Ch08.xhtml#bck_fn8_3}^ The authors of the article document, in detail, the multiple failures of implants and the toll they take on patients and their families. The heart of this failure, they conclude, is a very poorly regulated "global \$400bn (Â£310bn)" medical implant industry that values profit over human life.^[4](#Ch08.xhtml#fn8_4){#Ch08.xhtml#bck_fn8_4}^ For example, according to the authors of the article, there were 62,000 "adverse incident" reports linked to medical implants in the UK between 2015 and 2018. A total of 1,004 of these 62,000 reports resulted in the death of the patient.^[5](#Ch08.xhtml#fn8_5){#Ch08.xhtml#bck_fn8_5}^ This number is exponentially larger in the US. The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA), the investigative team reports, "has collected 5.4m 'adverse event' reports over the past decade, some from manufacturers reporting problems in other parts of the world. These included 1.7m reports of injuries and almost 83,000 deaths. Nearly 500,000 of these reports mentioned an explant---surgery to remove a device."^[6](#Ch08.xhtml#fn8_6){#Ch08.xhtml#bck_fn8_6}^

The most problematic of these devices were those marketed to women and elderly patients: vaginal or transvaginal mesh; the contraceptive implant [Essure]{.italic}; breast implants; and hip and knee replacements. The number of incidents reported compared to the number of surgeries performed were significant. Take, for example, vaginal or transvaginal mesh. Vaginal or transvaginal mesh is a form of surgical mesh.^[7](#Ch08.xhtml#fn8_7){#Ch08.xhtml#bck_fn8_7}^ It consists of a loosely woven sheet created from inorganic and biological materials (polypropylene mesh or biological grafts being the most common). Its primary use is to support organs and tissues during and after surgery. It is also used for reconstructive work (pelvic organ prolapse or stress urinary incontinence).^[8](#Ch08.xhtml#fn8_8){#Ch08.xhtml#bck_fn8_8}^ [The Guardian]{.italic} article reports that over a ten-year period (2006--16), "just over 75,000 trans-vaginal tape (TVT) implants---the most common kind of vaginal and transvaginal mesh---were fitted. During the same period, more than 4,900 procedures were carried out []{#Ch08.xhtml#page_169 .pagebreak title="169"}to remove TVT implants---around 6.5% of the number put in."^[9](#Ch08.xhtml#fn8_9){#Ch08.xhtml#bck_fn8_9}^ The majority of the faulty mesh used in the UK is manufactured by US-based biomedical company Johnson & Johnson. When contacted by reporters from [The Guardian]{.italic} about the problems with its product, Johnson & Johnson issued the following statement: "We empathize with those patients who have had complications associated with pelvic mesh procedures, but we believe it is important to recognize that their experiences do not speak for the vast majority of women whose lives have been improved through treatment with pelvic mesh devices."^[10](#Ch08.xhtml#fn8_10){#Ch08.xhtml#bck_fn8_10}^

A number of discourses become apparent when reading the report discussed above. Discourses about embodiment, autonomy, agency, and the self appear here: about the implant as a figurative and literal "supportive" device that a user choses to have placed in her body ("its primary use is to support organs and tissues"; references to contraceptives; the use of the words "voluntary" and "choice"), or one that improves (or not) the quality of the patient's life, as per Johnson & Johnson's statement given above. Discourses around invisibility, ubiquity, and power and control emerge through the use of the word "insertion" and "technological device," and through the sheer number of implants fitted each year. These discourses are similar to the key concepts that give meaning to the digital interface as discussed throughout this book---specifically, agency, embodiment, ubiquity, and cybernetics.

The main objective of this book has been to propose an analytical framework for the digital interface in interactive new media installations. My aim has been to develop an understanding of how the digital interface can be seen as an important actor in positioning and (re)shaping specific ways of relating to the self, to technology, to artistic practice, and to others. I have been interested in examining what a digital interface [may be]{.italic} and exploring potential ways of thinking, doing, and making that it could possibly bring about when theorized in non-instrumental ways, from within aesthetic-based contexts.

The term "digital interface" has not merely referred to the point of interaction between two or more parts of a technical system, or the symbolic software that enables humans to use computers, but also to a technology that mediates, and thus creates, relationships between viewer/participants, artists, and artworks, as well as influencing the movements and perceptions of those interacting with it. This definition has allowed me to conceptualize the interface as a technical, material, cultural form and artistic practice, something that has been constructed and designed in a specific way for a specific purpose, a procedure for mediating, translating, and disseminating information, a way of relating, a form of embodiment, and a mode of communication. I have been guided by Emerson's (2014) understanding of the interface in a broad sense as a technology that mediates relationships between entities and the surface-level objects they produce, as well as the technical machine-based processes that take place below the surface.^[11](#Ch08.xhtml#fn8_11){#Ch08.xhtml#bck_fn8_11}^ I have used her definition as a primary analytical framework in which to understand the interface and to rethink it as a dynamic, hybrid, aesthetic, and cultural process that emerges out of, shapes, and is shaped by our interactions with it in interactive new media installations. Here, emphasis is placed on the aesthetic and the cultural processes that help shape the digital interface, not the technical and the mechanic processes. Thus, my conceptualization of the interface differs, albeit slightly, from that of Emerson in that the interface is positioned here as a form []{#Ch08.xhtml#page_170 .pagebreak title="170"}that mediates, and to an extent creates, relationships between entities (the artist, the viewer/participant) and the aesthetic objects that it produces (the artwork), as well as the aesthetic and creative processes that are hidden from view (artistic experimentation).

In [Chapters 4](#Ch04.xhtml) and [5](#Ch05.xhtml), [6](#Ch06.xhtml) and [7](#Ch07.xhtml), I have shown how the interface governs the interactions of the viewer/participant by restricting or reinforcing certain types of viewer/participant behaviors. It does this, I argued, in two ways: through instruction provided to the viewer/participant by the artist via the digital interface, and through the deployment of metaphors and models. I demonstrated how instruction and the concept of ubiquity function as important control mechanisms for what users are allowed to see (the artwork) or not see (the device itself), how they are to behave, and how they should interact. My investigation into the use of cybernetic and ubiquitous interfaces in interactive new media installations offered a way to address the question of how the interface---its processes and relationships---can be analyzed as potentially (re)shaping concepts of subjectivity, agency, the body, embodiment, ubiquity, and aesthetics. It also allowed me to argue, as I did in [Chapter 7](#Ch07.xhtml), that notions of agency and embodiment are not universal concepts.

As discussed throughout these chapters, the designation of the viewer/participant as locus of interaction---or interface---means that the illusion that the artist has complete control over the action occurring in the installation is, to an extent, broken. Thus, I suggested that the interface in interactive new media installations can be said to be unstable, uncertain, and, to a certain extent, open to reconfiguration. Regardless of whether or not they are perceptible to us, digital interfaces permeate our environments and play an active role in the space in which they are located. In [Chapters 1](#Ch01.xhtml), [2](#Ch02.xhtml) and [3](#Ch03.xhtml), I showed how the relationship between the digital interface, the viewer/participant, and the artist not only supports interaction, but is what makes interaction in interactive new media installations possible in the first place. Although quite different in terms of their scope, the concepts of aesthetics, agency, and embodiment show how this relationship is not universal and thus needs to be made visible, as well as how integral it is to interactive new media installations.

Ultimately, I believe much is to be gained from understanding the role that the digital interface plays in interactive new media installations. My discussions throughout this book demonstrate how the digital interface introduces different forms of thinking, doing, and making in interactive new media installations by mediating, and thus creating, relationships between viewer/participants, artists, and artworks, and influencing the movements and perceptions of those interacting with it. I have made the case for understanding the digital interface as an ongoing, dynamic, hybrid aesthetic and cultural process. I have suggested that such an understanding requires an analysis of the various aspects of the interface, including how the viewer/participant relates to and thinks about the interface, how this thinking and relation are translated into viewer/participant interaction, and how this interaction reshapes our relationship to technology in interactive new media installations. Through this analysis, I demonstrated not only how the interface is used, but [why]{.italic} its deployment in interactive new media installations matters. It matters because the interface is representative of the increasingly messy relationship between bodies, spaces, and technologies in our culture.

[]{#Ch08.xhtml#page_171 .pagebreak title="171"}There are as many ways of representing the relationship between bodies, spaces, and technology as there are interactive new media installations. Digital interfaces are but one way of representing this relationship, albeit one that provides a very useful example of showing how easily the relationship between bodies, spaces, and technologies can be managed, controlled, and sometimes commodified by both inside and outside forces (the technology industry, artists, academia, the viewer/participant). For example, when embedded into interactive new media installations and rendered imperceptible, the interface allowed us to re-imagine what a body, be it human or technological, may be and what the relationship between them may become, as represented through Karasic's [HÃ»mann]{.italic} (2008) and Vesna's [Mood Swings]{.italic} (2005--7). It also shows that these embodied re-imaginings are not necessarily universal, as was discussed in [Chapter 7](#Ch07.xhtml). Given this, I have argued that what is at stake in my investigation of the interface in interactive new media installations is not what an interface is or may be, but rather what bodies are and what they can become.

Yet, the interface, when utilized as a device that regulates and dictates movements and actions---as is so often the case in interactive new media installations---rapidly becomes an issue of power, control, and regulation, as exampled by installations that rely on the cybernetic feedback loop of instruction discussed in [Chapter 4](#Ch04.xhtml) and the implanted interface in [Chapter 7](#Ch07.xhtml). However, the re-imagining of what a body may be on behalf of the viewer/participant does not imply a process whereby the interface (a technological form) suddenly disappears and re-emerges as something else (a human body) or somehow changes something (a relationship, a viewer/participant's movement, a visual in an artwork) in a pre-determined, linear fashion. The interface may suggest a plan, but it does not determine anything, as the interface does not pre-exist its relationship with others. Rather, the digital interface, by virtue of its role in helping us re-imagine what bodies can become, can serve as a potential site of intervention against the control and regulation that it exerts. In this way, the use of the interface in interactive new media installations reveals not just the regulatory but also the transformative aspects of aesthetics. Thus, it shows the important role the interface plays in positioning and (re)shaping specific ways of relating to the self, to technology, to artistic practice, and to others. At the heart of this book, then, is the notion that the digital interface matters to contemporary society and that a critical exploration of it in aesthetic contexts can help us understand and possibly reconfigure our relationship with technology.
