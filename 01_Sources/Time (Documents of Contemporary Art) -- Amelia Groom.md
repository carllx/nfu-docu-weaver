# AmeliaGroom Introduction//We're five hundred years before the man we just robbed was born  

It's time. It's about time. In time, on time. Time by our side, time on our hands. Take your time, take time out. Tell the time, time will tell. Spending time, timing it. A long time, a lot of time, the whole time. In my time, at times, for the time being, all the time. Having time, keeping time.Killing time, wasting time, doing time. For a time, from time to time, at the same time, some other time. Time and time again, in no time at all. Turn back time, this time around. Set a time, serve your time, give someone the time of day. Workagainst time,beehindthetimes,fallonhardtimes.Thetimeshavechanged,the time has come. Time passing, time running out. Time's up. Time's out ...  

The different ways in which we use the word should be enough to show that we don't have a precise definition for it. The most elusive of the seven fundamental physical quantities in the International System of Units, we don't really know what we think time is. Is it the condition for events or the result of events? Does it exist independently of space? Independently of the mind? Of experience? Should we equate it with change or is time, as the quantum physicist Richard Feynman has quipped, ‘what happens when nothing else does'? Is there an atemporal eternity that is wholly separate to, or encompassing of, everyday duration? Are there times other than the present moment? Will it only ever move forward? Towards what? Could it slow down? Stagger? Split? Repeat or reverse? Would we notice? Why does it fly for those having fun but drag on and on for the bored, the infantile and the stoned?  

The writing compiled here provides little in the way of answers, but a whole lot in the way of more questions. Questions are more important to art than answers are anyway - and questions about time are evidently especially timely. Wasting and waiting; regression and repetition; non-consummation and counterproductivity; the belated and the obsolete; the disjointed and the out of synch - these are all familiar tropes in the work of contemporary artists, and point to a widespread questioning of the idea of time as an arrow propelling us in unison from the past into the future. While useful in certain situations, the notion of autonomous, linear, future-oriented time is a culturally and historically specific construct that remains ideologically grounded.  

Once the twentieth century's fetishization of teleological progress is abandoned, history's time reveals itself as a concoction of chance encounters, arbitrary inclusions, systematic exclusions, parenthetical digressions, abrupt U-turns, inherited anecdotes, half-remembered facts, glossed-over uncertainties and forgotten back-stories. As many have observed, the fragmentary experience of time that characterizes today's globalized geographic mobility makes it increasingly difficult for us to picture ourselves as centralized in any absolutist temporal model. Furthermore, the delocalization and non-fixity of networked digital space is both symptom and catalyst of the broken, multifarious time that we find ourselves in. Physics, of course, is miles ahead of us here, having over the last century repeatedly destabilized Newtonian absolute time and replaced linearity with more untidy models. Shortly after the passing of his lifelong friend Michele Besso, and less than a month before his own death, Albert Einstein famously wrote the following in a letter of condolence to the Besso family:  

Now he has departed from this strange world a little ahead of me. That signifies nothing. For those of us who believe in physics, the distinction between past, present and future is only a stubbornly persistent illusion. (Letter of 21 March 1955.EinsteinArchives7-245)  

This collection of texts is structured according to the illusory distinction of past, present and future, with its three sections titled Before, During and After. While the artists and writers surveyed veer away from linear conceptions of orderly chronology, their work is ordered here under the crude triad structure of thennow-later. In Before, Simon Starling's exhibition 'Never the Same River' restages multiple pasts in the present; Antony Gormley considers time and dynamism in contemporary and ancient sculpture; and Paul Chan emphasizes the Hellenic kairological temporality of his series The 7 Lights. During features Christian Marclay's The Clock; Sylvia Sleigh's ‘history pictures'; On Kawara's Today Series; Hiroshi Sugimoto's Theatres; Janet Cardiff's 're-composed digital present'; and Marina Abramovic's reflections on the long-duration performance works of Tehching Hsieh. The final section, After, includes Lee Ufan on infinity; Katie Paterson's engagement with intergalactic time; the aesthetics of anticipation in the work of Philippe Parreno and Doug Aitken; 'women's time' in Moyra Davey's photographs; and Raqs Media Collective's reflections on the economics of time, presented at the opening of the e-flux Time/Bank project.  

The book begins with the art historian George Kubler's arguments against definitive beginnings. His book The Shape of Time: Remarks on the History of Things (1962) challenged the linearity of established art-historical methodologies, and the discipline's persistent use of biological metaphors. When we talk about the 'birth' of an art, the 'maturation' of a style or the 'death' of a school, Kubler argues, we misread art as an autonomous organism; a self-contained system with successive developmental life stages. Progressive, uninterrupted, “biological' time cannot account for what Kubler sees as the true intermittency of time. In order to account for art accurately as the multi-directional transmission of energy rather than a set of causally determined linear relations, he proposes that 'the language of electrodynamics might have suited us better than the language of botany; and Michael Faraday might have been a better mentor than Linnaeus for the study of material culture.'  

In a number of his essays throughout the 1960s, the artist Robert Smithson heralded Kubler's ideas about time and history. 'A trans-historical consciousness has emerged in the sixties, that seems to avoid appeals to the organic time of the avant-garde, Smithson wrote in his text “Ultramoderne' (1967),2 later citing Kubler's remark that the history of art resembles 'a broken but much repaired chain made of string and wire', connecting 'occasional jewelled links. Against the earlier twentieth-century military metaphor of the artistic 'avant-garde', and the modernist rhetoric of progress that it came from, Smithson looks at mirrors and mirroring across and between times, without any unified trajectories. Of the art of his day he writes, 'the one line of the avant-garde is forking, breaking and becoming many lines.' Published alongside a series of near-identical stills from Andy Warhol's resolutely uneventful eight-hour film Empire (1964), the article concludes: 'Nothing is new, neither is anything old.'3  

The time of art moves backwards as well as forwards. Neoclassicism retroactively created Greek sculpture as we now know it. Cindy Sherman doesn't simply respond to the Old Masters. after the fact; she revises the lens through which we look at them. Cezanne can help us understand Cubism, while looking to Cubism can show us new ways of understanding Cezanne. In each case, notions of influence, legacy, causality and stylistic evolution should give way to an approach that acknowledges continuous dialogue - 'transferals of energy. in Kubler's terms - across times, in multiple directions at once. in her fornulation of the‘preposterous' (literally‘pre' $^+$ 'post') nature of history, Mieke Bal treats art as an ongoing conversation between pasts. presents and futures. Specifically, she claims that by visually 'quoting' Caravaggio, a number of contemporary artists are forever changing the baroque master's work.4  

Culture always reveals crisscrossing movements, and parallels without direct imitative interaction, which seriously challenge the teleological temporal schemas that have dominated Western art history and its doctrine of 'genius'. Kubler uses the example of both Charles Darwin and Alfred Wallace independently formulating the theory of natural selection in the mid nineteenth century; another classic instance is the apparent synchronicity of photography's diverse origins. Geoffrey Batchen has reminded us that photography is an invention with no sole inventor or clear beginning, since at least twenty people in seven countries around the turn of the nineteenth century arrived at the idea of fixing an image on a photosensitive surface.s  

# 14//INTRODUCTION  

It is only with the safety and simplification afforded by hindsight that we can apply telos to an historical narrative. Likewise with creative acts. Stepping away from the worn paradigms of artistic ego and the individual intention of the (usually male) genius, we might instead conceive of time from the perspective of the artwork itself. Against the notion of artistic production as a conscious, heroic, step-by-step execution from an idea to a predetermined end, Jan Verwoert has considered the possibility that an artwork is finished when its beginning appears: ‘when its very possibility emerges as an outcome'. Considering this retroactive temporal logic through the non-figurative paintings of Tomma Abts, he muses on the idea of latency within an image, which gradually becomes apparent to the painter as she paints. Reconsidering the temporal structure of creative production in this way, Verwoert observes, might make us revise our logic of linear development, and abandon the Hegelian schema of history as progression.6  

Following Aby Warburg's dynamic and counter-chronological approach to images in the early twentieth century, Georges Didi-Huberman has endorsed what he calls the ‘sovereignty of anachronism'. In Anachronic Renaissance, Alexander Nagel and Christopher Wood also set out to imagine new art-historical methodologies that might allow us to deal with the complex web of times that works of art move through.7 Their study reveals very different approaches to repetition, precedence, forgery, restoration, origins and authenticity during the Renaissance - leading them to conclude that approaching art from that era with any all-encompassing, one-directional model of time is inappropriate and misleading. In the Before section, these texts and others explore historicism and some possible futures for our engagement with the past.  

A number of exhibitions since the late 1990s - many of them curated by artists - have also facilitated symbiotic relations between artworks from dramatically disparate times, as I briefly survey in 'This is So Contemporary!'. reprinted on pages 45-8. Doing away with consensually agreed upon chronology and the confines of museological categories, these curiosity cabinet-like shows have played with the fact that - as the artist Maurizio Nannucci literally spelled out in neon lights in 1999 - all art has been contemporary. They affirm that the time and place in which a thing was made should not shut it off from other times and places. Works of art can bear witness to the context of their conception and fabrication, but to treat them simply as pedagogical historic documents is to suffocate them. In the author Jeanette Winterson's words, 'pictures and poetry and music are not only marks in time but marks through time, of their own time and ours, not antique or historical, but living as they ever did, exuberantly, untired.'s  

Gone is the avant-gardist compulsion to kill one's forefathers and redefine the playing field from scratch. Last century's isms, manifestos and dreams of the tabula rasa are no longer viable - instead, by opening up alternate times onto each, artists in the wake of modernity's shortcomings can play with the construct of received historicai narratives and reveal their ongoing fluidity in the present. As previous volumes in this series on The Archive, Ruins and Memory attest, early 21st-century art has seen a rising concerm with re-present-ing the past. Many artists are embracing obsolete technologies, abandoned places and outmoded materials: resuscitating unfinished ideas; revisiting documents and testimonies; and restaging downtrodden possibilities.? Rather than a winking postmodern pastiche of appropriated styles, or an earnest nostalgic immersion in a fixed. absent past, these new engagements with the remnants of previous times mark a thickening of the present to acknowledge its multiple, interwoven temporalities.  

The artist Katie Paterson has. approached temporal complexities and conundrums from a much broader scale, making small gestures towards infinity. For her lifelong project' History of Darkness (2010-). she has been making 35mm slides with images of imagelessness from around the cosmos, each one labelled with its distance from the earth in light years. The pictures have been acquired with the help of various telescopes, including the world's most powerful one at the W.M. Keck Observatory in Hawaii, which can see up to 13.2 billion light years away. Seemingly identical blank monochromes. Paterson's images in fact index various unthinkably enormous scales of intergalactic space and time that are beyond the limits of visibility. As rectilinear slices of apparent nothingness, they show us not how little there is to see out there, but how ill equipped we are ( perceptually. technologically, cognitively) for grasping the spatial and temporal vastness that is around us.  

Because light has a finite speed, we can all see the past. In fact, in purely optical terms we can only see the past, since there is always duration between a visible event and the arrival of its image on our retina. Looking into the night sky. we see images that are extremely old - stars as they were billions of years ago. which may well by now no longer exist, though their scintillating image remains in our visual present. Conceived of as an 'archive of darkness' spanning billions of years throughout the universe, Paterson's open-ended project is marked from the beginning by an absurd futility. To archive darkness is to subject the unknown to the systematization of knowledge. In the artist's words: There is never a way to represent, see or know all the darkness in the universe, so it's a kind of infinite journey, and a futile one, to try to capture it on a human scale, and make it an entity.' As with much of Paterson's work, History of Darkness poetically collides various incommensurable temporalities - cosmological time, which is inconceivably immense and always, for us, drastically tardy: the geological time of our tiny planet, from which we look out to all this ancient darkness that predates it; and the biological time of a fleeting human lifespan dedicated to an obviously unachievable project. Further aspects of Paterson's work are discussed in Rachel Kent's 'Marking Time' on page 213.  

The second section, During. opens with an excerpt from Giorgio Agamben's essay 'What is the Contemporary?'. Honing in on the apparent paradox that the con-temporary (literally ‘together with time') is by its nature ana-chronistic ('up against time'), he writes that those who truly belong to their time are those who 'neither perfectly coincide with it nor adjust themselves to its demands'. Our ownepochis completely distant from us,he says,and the'true contemporary' is someone who can perceive the obscurity of the present. Since it is only through our untimeliness that we are equipped for grasping our time, we should, according to Agamben, court a relationship with the present that 'adheres to it through a disjunction'.  

As a now that refuses its nowness, this ‘anachronistic contemporary' has several precedents. Agamben cites Roland Barthes' remark that 'the contemporary is the untimely',as well as Nietzsche's Untimely Meditations, in which he demanded 'the capacity to feel unhistorically.' (See pages 174-7 for Emily Apter's reading of Nietzschean untimeliness in Moyra Davey's photographs, and 89-92 for Quinn Latimel's take on the contemporary anachronisms of painter Sylvia Sleigh.) Agamben's theories of time and history are also strongly indebted to Walter Benjamin, who, writing shortly before his death in 1940, called on us to stop 'telling the sequence of events like the beads of a rosary' and instead grasp 'the constellation' which the present forms with the past, in order to forge the revolutionary future. Benjamin's messianic Jetztzeit, 'now time', is not oriented towards a projected, indefinitely deferred saviour, but rather the notion of revolution as an ongoing latent presence. Instead of endlessly enumerating the causal links of historicism, he tells us we can 'blast open the continuum of history' and galvanize the present by finding out from time 'what it has in store'12  

The destabilization of teleological time has featured in various critical fields. From a postcolonial perspective, for instance. Dipesh Chakrabarty has 'provincialized Europe' through a nuanced critique of Western secularized historicism, which purports to objectivity and universality but cannot include the forms of memory and time that have long existed outside of its constructed linearity.3 Elsewhere, in the context of queer theory, Judith (Jack) Halberstam has shown how hegemonic time is thrown off course, by intent or by necessity, in queer cultures. Their book In a Queer Time and Place: Transgender Bodies, Subcultural Lives (2005) explores the disruptive temporalities that queer subjects develop outside the institutions of reproduction and family - and against organizations of time and space that are based on capitalist demands for propulsion and accumulation.  

Feminist theory has also provided us with non-linear temporalities. In the late 1970s, Julia Kristeva posited (historical) “linear time' and its nationalistic correlatives against (mythological) ‘cyclical' and (Nietzschean) 'monumental' times for feminism after 1968, characterized by echoes across various contexts, without any progressivist notion of sequence.14 More recently, Elizabeth Grosz has defined time as an active force characterized by chance and unpredictability. In advocating the temporality of becoming' she argues that grasping the true indeterminacy of time allows us to approach change in less prescriptive ways. 'The force of time is not just a contingent characteristic of the living, writes Grosz, "but is the dynamic impetus that enables life to become, to always be in the process of becoming, something other than it was.'5 Writing by Grosz appears in the final section, After, along with other texts that deal with change and futurity.  

To disrupt the notion of a homogeneous, uni-directional time made from a string of separate instants is to undermine the hubris of the present. If time is considered to flow all at once, unstoppably and irreversibly like the hands of a clock, the 'now' thinks of itself as being at the brink of the future, in front of a long line of developments and acquisitions; and it inevitably condescends to the past. For Michel Serres, the conception of the present time as an ongoing centre, with all past time behind it and all time to come in front of it, is akin to the ancient diagrams that narcissistically, and without any evidence, placed our planet or our galaxy at the centre of all things:  

Just as in space we situate ourselves at the centre, at the navel of the things in the universe, so for time, through progress, we never cease to be at the summit, on the cutting edge, at the state-of-the-art development. It follows that we are always right, for the simple, banal, and naive reason that we are living in the present moment. The curve traced by the idea of progress thus seems to me to sketch or project into time the vanity and fatuousness expressed spatially by that central position.'6  

Art can show us how our understanding of time has always been something fabricated and shifting rather than pre-existing or 'natural. With linear perspective in European Quattrocento painting, for example, a vector connected an imagined supreme seer - with an artificially fixed, unifocal position in space and time - to a designated vanishing point. Perspectival pictures contained static objects that invited us to approach them successively, through quantitatively measurable units - with past, present and future times neatly lined up. In her essay on the multiplication and decentralization of space in images today, on pages 168-71, the artist Hito Steyerl looks at the gradual breakdown of perspectivalism since the nineteenth century. The nominally objective and scientific worldview of perspectival painting, she says, was intrinsically tied up with the thinking that enabled colonialist expansion. Concomitant with this measurable, absolute space was the new conception of time as unified and linear, enabling projection onto a future that is subject to ownership and control. In Steyerl's analysis, it helped set standards for marking people as other, thus legitimizing their conquest or the domination over them'.  

Introducing the 'timeline of timelines' he compiled with Sasha Archibald for Cabinet magazine, Daniel Rosenberg reminds again us that all conceptions of historic time are historically specific constructs (see pages 60-62). Before the idea of a line of time' started to be naturalized in the nineteenth century, the concept of mapping time - something that doesn't have any spatial substance - was strange and difficult.17 The assimilation of this counterintuitive notion of linear, progressive, divisible 'monochronic' time coincides with, and facilitates, the rise of capitalism. The historian David Landes has traced the development of the mechanical clock and the twenty-four-hour-day system after the thirteenth century in Europe as a precondition for the development of the free market, which is possible only after units of duration (as well as those of weight, length, area and volume) are standardized.8 E.P. Thompson also showed how universal observance of clock time is a consequence of the industrial revolution, and argued that the creation of the modern state would not have been possible without the imposition of what he termed 'time discipline'.19  

As a sign, money is perfectly empty. Neutralized and neutralizing in its supreme non-specificity, money is abstraction par excellence - and it goes hand in hand with empty, abstract time. After Benjamin Franklin's credo that 'time is money.' the philosopher Eric Alliez has traced a history of European philosophical frameworks that shaped what he considers to be the modern temporality of avarice.Hewrites:  

If money bears within itself an ineffaceable debit, it is because time, converted into the money form, is discovered as an empty form, a pure order of time, quantitative and differential, measurable and coinable, which nothing can come to fill. The time without qualities of a future-oriented humanity that cuts time into segments of linear duration that are put to profit in order torealize investments and 'accumulation'. And so time itself is 'invested': there is no advance but in time, nopayment due that is not temporal.2o  

In his polemic against what he termed 'the tyranny of the clock' in 1944, the anarchist George Woodcock argued that prior to industrialization, time was understood only through the natural cyclical passages of day to night and season to season (see pages 65-6). Once time was homogenized and mechanically measured, the worker's body was forced to internalize its persistent ticking. The clock, according to Woodcock, 'was the means by which the regularization and regimentation of life necessary fo1 an exploiting system of industry could best be attained'. Some of the most iconic images that encapsulate the general anxiety surrounding the clock's tyrannical demands for punctuality and productivity are to be found in interwar cinema. In Fritz Lang's Metropolis (1927), the hero Freder desperately grapples with the overpowering hands of a huge factory clock, ultimately assuming the position of crucifixion across it. Charlie Chaplin's Little Tramp also suffers the physical and psychological effects of inhuman and inhumane acceleration at the factory assembly belt in Modern Times (1936). This is a film about a body tragically out of synch with the mechanized reality around it, and its opening credits are set against an ominous close-up of an incessantly ticking clock.  

As innumerable viewers have discovered, Christian Marclay's looped twentyfour hour video work The Clock (2010) is in fact a clock. With its thousands of fragments of found footage from the history of cinema containing references to the time all properly synchronized, Marclay's work reveals itself as an accurate timekeeper. These popular movies invited us to languish in the dark and be temporarily and temporally transported, but The Clock's rearrangement of them prohibits such escapism by endlessly pointing out how much of our own time we are spending in front of the screen. The writer Lynne Tillman describes the anxiety she experiencedseeingthework:  

It was Thursday - 3:15pm, 3:16pm, 3:17pm - I was watching time pass. My time. It was passing. and I was watching it. What is this watching, what am I watching for? I wouldn't, couldn't, wait for the end.21  

But The Clock is also more than a clock. Within the overarching apparatus of this accurate but entirely false 'day', there are different parallel and intersecting times occurring. In her response to the work, reprinted on pages 142-5, Rosalind Krauss points out that the intended temporal structures of the original films are thrown out of joint within the new assemblage: 'the suspense unreeling inside the screen is not synchronized with the suspense unfolding in the viewer's real time.' A mind-bogglingly laborious gesture of remixing hundreds of readymade times into a neat twenty-four hours, the work artificially unifies on-screen and off-screen time. As a result, it reveals that experienced temporality is in fact anything but unified.  

The Clock wasn't the first attempted meeting of depicted celluloid time and literal time. One precedent is Agnes Varda's film Cléo from 5 to 7(1962), where reel time is opened on to real time as we spend an hour and a haif with a woman waiting for the results of a medical test that may or may not confirm a diagnosis of stomach cancer. Coming at the height of the French New Wave, the film eschews flashbacks and plunges us into a shared present tense - one that necessarily includes all of life's inconsequential moments of boredom and banality, which the compressed and intensified time of commercial cinema would normally edit out. The film shows how states of anticipation and apprehension suspend the present for anyone who is waiting. As with The Clock, the recurring references to the time in Cléofrom 5 to 7ultimately reveal the discrepancies betweenobjectively measured 'clock time', re-constructed cinematic time, and the more fluid and unpredictable times of lived, subjective experience.  

Varda's work has often reflected on time. Her documentary The Beaches of Agnes (2008) is a sort of self-portrait, in which the eighty-year-old filmmaker revisits various dormant pasts and playfully remixes the movements of time in the present. There are several shots of her awkwardly walking backwards in a human imitation of the cinematic 'rewind', and throughout the film her dyed hair grows out to reveal her now-signature grey roots - only the amount of growth goes back and forth, disrupting any pretentions to sequential time in the finished film. Like her possibly terminally ill character Cléo four and a half decades earlier, the aged Varda in this film is obsessed with time because she is thinking about mortality. She rues history's relentless onward march, and when a friend gives her a broken clock without hands she likes it because it shows no evidence of time passing. She goes to the seaside, where the perpetual tidal cycles are out of synch with the time kept by clocks, and no evidence of history's developments can be found. 'Time always passes except on beaches', she says.  

Defying time's persistent passing in a very different way. the Taiwanese artist Tehching Hsieh staged a series of year-long performances after arriving in New York as an illegal immigrant in the late 1970s. Time Clock Piece saw him punch a worker's time clock in his studio, every hour on the hour, day and night, from 11 April 1980 to 11 April 1981. This is a work of monumental monotony. where tautology ensures against teleology. The whole deadpan performance unfolded as a self-perpetuating reiteration of the same, like one big etcetera. Unable to work legally in the Us, he dressed himself in a worker's uniform and enacted labour without production or product. 'Clocking in' is the start of the worker's day: by isolating the act and repeating it on loop, Hsieh suspended commencement - stretching it out over a whole year in a grand defiance of progressive time. Here, diligence and punctuality carried out to the extreme amount to an elaborate emblem of inefficacy. The artist has named Sisyphus as an early influence on his practice.  

In his text on Hsieh, Adrian Heathfield considers the collapse of objective temporal measurement that occurs in extremely long performances: 'duration deals in the confusion of temporal distinctions - between past, present and future - drawing the spectator into the thick braids of paradoxical times. (See pages 97-8.) Heathfield refers here specifically to Henri Bergson's notion of la durée pure. Formulated at the turn of the twentieth century, the Bergsonian philosophy of ‘pure duration' was wholly at odds with the cultural construct of quantitative clock-time, where temporal units are abstracted and lined up in sequence. While clocks artificially spatialized time, making it divisible and successive, Bergson understood the time of our lived experience as a ceaseless and indivisible flow. '[E]very duration is thick', he wrote,'real time has no instants.22  

By rejecting instants, Bergson also famously rejected photographic'snapshots'. In Creative Evolution (1907), he argued that since such images cut into continuity by isolating specific moments from the perpetual flow of time, they were incapable of capturing the true nature of reality. But a closer look at photographs can reveal that they also have duration inscribed in them. For his series Theatres (1978-), Hiroshi Sugimoto makes 'movies' still by keeping the shutter of his camera open in front of a film for its entire running time, resulting in pictures of blank white screens as the total sum of the projected images. (Hans Belting's reading of this series appears on pages 137-42.)  

Sugimoto's exaggerated long exposures challenge the established notion of photography as a sharp slice into time; but even photos that were taken very quickly do not simply freeze the flow of things. Josef Koudelka's iconic image from the Prague Spring, which appears on the cover of this book, records the exact time that the Warsaw Pact troops invaded the Czechoslovakian capital in August 1968. In the midgiound, a group of tanks can just be seen rolling in to the apparently vacated city street. But besides indexing a specific point in time, it has also become, over time, an image of the dramatic weeks that followed this moment. A photograph of that which history has told us is about to arrive, its time is latent - but retrospectively so. (This is the same 'anterior future' Roland Barthes is 'punctured' by when he sees a photograph of his deceased mother as a child, and registers that she is both dead and going to die.)23 Initially appearing as a precisely time-stamped, instantaneous snap, the temporal complexity of Koudelka's historic documentary image is further affirmed by the way it implicates our present. Looking at any depicted time involves convergence with real time, and here the arm showing us the time becomes our arm - its position forces us to embody it, so that what was ls anachronistically entwined with what is.  

Collaborating with each other in the present, the wife-husband duo Stephanie and Richard Nova Milne (who go by the moniker nova Milne) have over several years made anachronistic video works through retroactive collaborations with former selves. Mining their personal archives, they insert footage of their adult bodies into childhood home movies and facilitate implausible new axes of disconnected times. Love Cats (1991/2007) has 29- year-old Richard join 10-yeal-old Stephanie on screen for a solo dance she performed at school assembly; and Frame Drag (1988/2009) sees grown-up Stephanie share a tender moment, and a cigarette, with her 11-year-old to-behusband in the past. While Marclay's The Clock is a masterpiece of editing - with individual shots carefully selected and lined up in sequence - nova Milne's videos are made by layering different moments of time onto the same space. The post-production edit is replaced by re-production folding; with superimposed verticality instead of horizontally juxtaposed shots. The time is thickened, and sequence is eclipsed.  

Colliding twoavailable temporalities tovisualize unavailable encounters between them, nova Milne's titles always carry dual dates - with the year of the original material and the year of its later reworking. Their text on pages 216-17 is dated 1988/2012, acknowledging the input made by a child version of Richard. Once linear time is escaped, befores interact freely with afters and - as with Einstein's message of condolence - the predicament of mortality no longer separates the living from the dead. In 2011 the artists travelled to Los Angeles to meet with Tessa B. Dick, the widow of sci-fi writer Philip K. Dick, and made a four-channel video installation that reunites the two in a densely layered time of looped suspension. Described by nova Milne as gestures of 'domestic sci-fi', these works are unapologetically sensual, even sentimental. But beyond impotent nostalgia, they mark a hypothetical liberation of archived memories into living, infinitely re-workable possibilities. 'The past is never dead', William Faulkner wrote,‘it's not even past.'  

The title of this introduction, we're five hundred years before the man we just robbed was born, is robbed from Terry Gilliam's 1981 film Time Bandits. Here, six delinquent dwarfs treat time like a Contiki Tour, making brief, inebriated and opportunistic stops all over it. Because the Supreme Being, their former employer, has left holes in his space-time fabric, the bandits can forge new paths through it, inadvertently redistributing Napoleon Bonaparte's riches to Robin Hood along the way. Chronology does exist, but the stuff it's made up of is riddled with gaps and can always be revisited. This is the sort of temporality proposed by this book - where linearity is just one amongst many co-existing. often conflicting, times. Every anthology editor faces the task of contriving a semblance of order from disparate bodies of work; the hope here is that unexpected interactions will refract across the provisional artifice of that deceptive sequence: Before, During and After...

# George Kubler The Shape of Time//1962  

[...] The oldest surviving things made by men are stone tools. A continuous series runs from them to the things of today. The series has branched many times, and it has often run out into dead ends. Whole sequences, of course, ceased when families of artisans died out or when civilizations collapsed, but the stream of things was never completely stilled. Everything made now is either a replica or a variant of something made a little time ago, and so on, back without break to the first morning of human time. This continuous connection in time must contain lesser divisions. I...]  

Although inanimate things remain our most tangible evidence that the old human past really existed, the conventional metaphors used to describe this visible past are mainly biological. We speak without hesitation of the birth of an art, of the life of a style' and the 'death of a school', of flowering,'maturity' and 'fading', when we describe the powers of an artist. I..]  

However useful it is for pedagogical purposes, the biological metaphor of style as a sequence of life-stages was historically misleading, for it bestowed upon the flux of events the shapes and the behaviour of organisms. By the metaphor of the life-cycle, a style behaves like a plant. Its first leaves are small and tentatively shaped, the leaves of its middle life are fully formed, and the last leaves it puts forth are small again but intricately shaped. All are sustained by one unchanging principle of organization common to all members of that species, with variants of race occurring in different environments. By the biological metaphor of art and history, style is the species, and historical styles are its taxonomic varieties. As an approximation, nevertheless, this metaphor recognized the recurrence of certain kinds of events, and it offered at least a provisional explanation of them, instead of treating each event as an unprecedented, never-to-be-repeated unicum.  

The biological model was not the most appropriate one for a history of things. Perhaps a system of metaphors drawn from physical science would have clothed the situation of art more adequately than the prevailing biological metaphors, especially if we are dealing in art with the transmission of some kind of energy, with impulses, generating centres and relay points; with increments and losses in transit; with resistances and transformers in the circuit. In short, the language of electrodynamics might have suited us better than the language of botany, and Michael Faraday might have been a better mentor than Linnaeus for the study of material culture. [... ]  

For the shapes of time, we need a criterion that is not a mere transfer by analogy from biological science. Biological time consists of uninterrupted durations of statistically predictable lengths: each organism exists from birth to death upon an 'expected' lifespan. Historical time, however, is intermittent and variable. Every action is more intermittent than it is continuous, and the intervals between actions are infinitely variable in duration and content. The end of an action and its beginning are indeterminate. Clusters of actions here and there thin out or thicken sufficiently to allow us with some objectivity to mark beginnings and endings. Events and the intervals between them are the elements of the patterning of historical time. Biological time contains the unbroken events called lives; it also contains social organizations by species and groups of species; but in biology the intervals of time between events are disregarded, while in historical time the web of happening that laces throughout the intervals between existences attracts our interest.  

Time, like mind, is not knowable as such. We know time only indirectly by what happens in it, by observing change and permanence, by marking the succession of events among stable settings, and by noting the contrast of varying rates of change. I...]  

The segmentation of history is still an arbitrary and conventional matter, governed by no verifiable conception of historical entities and their durations. Now and in the past, most of the time the majority of people live by borrowed ideas and upon traditional accumulations, yet at every moment the fabric is being undone and a new one is woven to replace the old, while from time to time the whole pattern shakes and quivers, settling into new shapes and figures. These processes of change are all mysterious uncharted regions, where the traveller soon loses direction and stumbles in darkness.

# Simon Starling Never the Same River (Possible Futures, Probable Pasts)//2010  

# Quick Realities  

It was reported on the first of April this year that a man wearing 'a bow tie and rather too much tweed for his age' was arrested in Switzerland as he attempted to sabotage operations at the Large Hadron Collider.2 The arrested man, who insisted he was from the future, was reportedly spotted rooting around in the bins where he claimed to be looking for fuel to power his ^time machine'. While this elegantly orchestrated piece of April foolery, a hoax as insightful institutional critique, clearly came from outside the physics establishment,there arerespected voices from within who claim that the troubled collider might genuinely be being sabotaged by the future. It has been suggested that the Higgs Boson, (the hypothetical particle that physicists hope to create in the collider), might be so abhorrent to nature that its creation would ripple backwards through time and stop the collider before it could produce the sought-after particle; like a time traveller journeying backwards through time to kill his own grandfather.  

What Buckminster Fuller hailed as the ‘quick realities'3 of contemporary physics, that have, until now, become most traumatically manifest in the two bombs dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki in 1945, seem to generate an evergrowing sense of temporal uncertainty. From its humble beginnings (in a subterranean former rackets court on the campus of Chicago University), the Manhattan Project culminated catastrophically in the bombs dropped on Japan: the first an explosion and the second, a baffling implosion, like some tormented cartoon character quite literally turning itself inside-out, generating temperatures unknown on earth - about ten billion degrees within less than a millionth of a second. The events that occurred in that unimaginably brief moment caused a fundamental rupture in our relationship with time, but perhaps most significantly in our understanding of the future, which 'became something to be anticipated precisely and feared'.4  

Such anxiety-inducing traumas are just one aspect of an ongoing sense of temporal instability The sense that our increasingly unanchored, fluid lives are at odds with the artificial construct of a linear chronology, of course predates the atom bomb, and is perhaps as old as the construct of time itself. Indeed, as Borges writes in The Garden of Forking Paths', 'In contrast to Newton and Schopenhauer, your ancestor did not believe in a uniform, absolute time. He believed in an infinite series of times, in a growing, dizzying net of divergent and convergent and parallel times.'5 The banks of Heraclitus' river of time,6 to which the title of the exhibition [Never the Same River'] alludes, have, as W.G. Sebald's Austerlitz so elegantly attests, been continually breached and redefined. Even empirical science, that for a few centuries seemed to hold back the fold-waters of our temporal uncertainty, now, if the Hadron Collider is any indicator, appears to be swelling its source.  

# The Meeting  

Comprised of works that themselves push and pull at an understanding of linear time - often restaging or reiterating ideas, images or forms from the past or projecting them into the future - 'Never the Same River' conflates works already exhibited at Camden Arts Centre, London, throughout its history into a single exhibition while, in an attempt to break the stranglehold of history. it simultaneously juxtaposes them with moments from a possible future programme. By restaging the display of works from different periods of the galleries' history in the exact position they occupied the first time they were exhibited, Never the Same River' aims to create a kind of temporal polyphony or even at times, cacophony, orchestrating a series of collisions between, until now, spatially and historically remote works, all of which worry at the borders of our understanding of time - the probable past and possible future of Camden Arts Centre momentarily coming together in an unstable present.  

'Never the Same River' attempts to map an artistic preoccupation with a renewed understanding of that 'growing. dizzying net of divergent and convergent and parallel times'. While this was in part inspired by the works that I encountered both on numerous visits to Camden Arts Centre over the last twenty years and when backtracking through the Centre's archives in the somewhat temporally dislocated 1960s reading rooms of the Holborn Library, its genesis might be found most specifically in the events surrounding the installation of a work I made in 2000, rather melodramatically titled Burn-Time. Like an increasing number of my works, it had its origins in a rejected public proposal, in this case for the German city of Bremen. It consisted of a - by then - well-used hen house, built in Scotland to the plans of a Neoclassical prisonturned-museum, dedicated to the work of the Bremen-born, Bauhaus-trained designer Wilhelm Wagenfeld, as well as a number of similarly wel-used egg coddlers (Wagenfeld, 1933) and a roughly built stove, fashioned from bricks extracted from one of the Centre's walls. During the exhibition, work began on plans to refurbish the Centre, and the architects, not knowing that it was a temporary addition, included my brick stove in their drawings of Gallery 3. This misplaced addition to the architectural plans is particularly serendipitous in view of the fact that the architect of the original library building that is now Camden Arts Centre, Arnold S. Taylor, is a family relative. This meeting across time with my great-great-uncle planted the seed of 'Never the Same River', and I suspect inspired the invitation for me to select it.  

# Space Time  

While each work has been assembled from remote moments in the history of the exhibition space, each work also has its own speed, its own internal sense of temporal trajectory. Thus an encounter with the space of the exhibition involves an encounter with what might best be imagined as an impossibly interlocking series of moving walkways, all running at different speeds and on different trajectories. As we move from work to work, from one era to another, we are pushed and pulled through time, sometimes gradually and sometimes at breathtaking velocity, sometimes through the briefest moments in time, and at others,throughvast chunks of thestuff.  

A man is filmed crossing a bridge into the future - again - his actions marking frame by frame a false start to the cinematic future of the twentieth century (Matthew Buckingham). An eighth of a second of 1976 and an eighth of a second of 1977 fuse in a single photographic exposure, a joyous midnight moment turned indecisive - then and now (Douglas Huebler). Close-by, a chicken and egg drama unfolds in a photograph restaging the events depicted in a painting which was in turn based on a photograph made by that same photographer (Christian Boltanski/jacques Monory). A twentieth-century sculptor (Henry Moore) reinvents a long-dead category of English sculpture with recourse to preColumbian and ancient Egyptian precedents, sent into the future by the craftsmen of those civilizations - their ancient, pebble-like forms in turn tossed back onto the beach, via the bronze foundry, by another sculptor (Des Hughes). Two modest canvases testify to an artistic dilemma: their maker, who once cast himself as a corpse, laid out in a pyramidal tomb, finds himself caught between the desire to sustain tradition (Timeless) and the instinct to subvert (Timely) (Paul Thek). An early twentieth-century purveyor of 'séance-fiction' pre-empts the Blitz - her painterly premonitions, once excluded from their present, deemed fit only for the future by their maker (Hilma af Klint). A magic lantern summons voices from the grave (Susan Hiller), the here and now of its interlocking circles of coloured light seeming to both echo and contradict the faded painted circles tracked on a Galician sea wall - remnants of a broken-hearted hermit's life, whose fable-like story triggers musings on the fallacies of prediction (Michael Stevenson).  

If it is true that the future is always set in the present and is always misremembered,7 then what of that crab, caught in the glare of a flash as it retreats beneath a redeployed car body press - this improvised anchor a submerged remnant of Irish entrepreneurship turned Hollywood time machine. Delorean's failed dream (Sean Lynch)? Some works seem to have been generated at almost glacially slow speeds, the medium of the moment, newsprint, petrified (Tony Carter). A sloth hangs in museological stasis (Francis Upritchard) while nearby a bullish chaise longue fires its reclining passenger into the future (Marcel Breuer) and a broken sapling is immortalized in bronze (Keith Coventry). We tread on temporarily unstable ground - step by dizzying step.  

Space and time are constantly confused and become interchangeable terms. A black and white film ripples out from the once shabby corner of one of the Centre's galleries, mapping the institution and its surrounding infrastructure, until the camera settles on a news stand heralding man's first steps on the moon, the map growing suddenly bigger as members of the public speculate and fantasize about a future in space (David Lamelas). An absurdist crossing of the Mexican/US border via a circumnavigation of the globe is at once in defiance of a political stasis and an attempt to operate outside the norms of contemporary life - a detour par excellence (Francis Alys). A hooded falcon (Stefan Gec), its tiny bell fashioned from brass salvaged from a defunct Russian submarine, is recorded flying around the vaulted space once occupied by the aforementioned brick stove and now dominated by - in what is perhaps the exhibition's most disorientating moment of deja-vu, - a restaged, backstage view of an artist in residence - all self-parody and projection - existing at 'the thinnest of interfaces between the past and the future's (Mike Nelson). The falcon's looping flight seeming to cut right through this phantom studio - redoubling the sense that the whole elaborate apparatus is only a mirage. Another studio floor - a deeply stratified, sedimentary conflation of paint, photographs, newspaper clippings and torn-out book illustrations - creates the unstable bedrock from which contemporary images appear. A painted scream, the open mouth a 'shadowy abyss', voices the 'diabolical powers of the future' (Francis Bacon).  

# An Afterword  

In its making, 'Never the Same River' has asked all sorts of questions about the relationship between artworks and their documentation, between photography and memory, and between the objects that haunt the Centre's history and the ideas that evolve around them. Artists' and curators' memories are of course fallible or coloured by concerns of the present and aspirations for the future. Works shift in significance, afe reappraised, remade or simply decay. Some exhibitions are just never recorded - the ‘installation view', as the archives attest, is a relatively recent invention - a work's relationship to the others around it or to the space it occupied lost forever. 'Never the Same River' is thus by nature a collage of hard fact, rigorous research, hazy memory, word-ofmouth rumour and speculation that amounts to a kind of collective memory of a possiblefuture and a probablepast.

# Georges Didi-Huberman Before the Image, Before Time: The Sovereignty of Anachronism//2000  

Whenever we are before the image, we are before time. Like the poor illiterate in Kafka's story ['Before the Law' (1914-15)]. we are before the image as before the law: as before an open doorway. It hides nothing from us, all we need to do is enter, its light almost blinds us, holds us in submission. Its very opening - and 1 am not talking about the doorkeeper - holds us back: to look at it is to desire, to wait, to be before time. But what kind of time? What plasticities and fractures, what rhythms and jolts of time, can be at stake in this opening of the image?  

Let us consider for a moment a fresco from the convent of San Marco in Florence. It was probably painted in the 1440s by a local Dominican friar who later became known as Beato Angelico. It is situated at eye level in the eastern corridor of the clausura, just below a sacra conversazione. The rest of the corridor, like the cells themselves, is whitewashed with chalk. In this double difference - from the figurative scene above, and from the white background surrounding it - the section of red fresco, dotted with its erratic spots, produces an effect like a deflagration: a blaze of colour that still bears the trace of its original spurt (the pigment was projected from a distance like rain in the fraction of a second) and, since then, has assumed permanence as a constellation of fixed stars.  

Before this image, all of a sudden, our present may see itself stopped in its tracks and simultaneously born in the experience of the gaze. Although in my case more than fifteen years have passed since I underwent this unique experience, my ‘reminiscent present' has not failed, it seems to me, to draw all manner of lessons from it. Before an image, however old it may be, the present never ceases to reshape, provided that the dispossession of the gaze has not entirely given way to the vain complacency of the 'specialist'. Before an image, however recent, however contemporary it may be, the past never ceases to reshape, since the image only becomes thinkable in a construction of the memory, if not of the obsession. Before an image, finally, we have humbly to recognize this fact: that it will probably outlive us, that before it we are the fragile element, the transient element, and that before us it is the element of the future, the element of permanence. The image often has more memory and more future than the being who contemplates it.  

But how are we to be equal to all the temporalities that this image, before us, conjugates on so many levels? And first of all, how are we to account for the present of this experience, for the memory it evoked, and for the future it promised? To stop before the painted surface by Fra Angelico, to surrender to its figural mystery, already means to enter, modestly and paradoxically, into the discipline known as art history. Modestly. because the grand painting of Renaissance Florence was bounded by its borders: its parerga, its marginal zones, the registers rightly - or wrongly - called 'subordinate' to the cycles of frescoes, the registers of 'decor', the simple 'imitation marble'. Paradoxically(and decisively in my case), because it was a question of understanding the intrinsic necessity, the figurative - or rather figural - necessity of a zone of painting that could easily be characterized as 'abstract' art. [...]  

InthesingleexampleofFraAngelico'smottledpaintedsurface,atleastthree temporalities - three heterogeneous times, anachronistic to one another - are intertwined in a remarkable fashion. The trompe I'oeil frame stems, evidently. from a 'modern' mimetism and a notion of prospectiva that can be roughly characterized as Albertian, and therefore euchronistic ['of its time'] in this Florentinefifteenth century of thefirst Renaissance.But the mnemonicfunction of the colour itself implies a notion of the figura that the painter found expressed in Dominican writings of the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries: arts of memory. 'sums of similitudes', or biblical exegeses (in this sense, Fra Angelico could be qualified as an 'old-fashioned' painter, an adjective that, in current usage, is used as an equivalent to 'anachronistic'). Finally, the dissimilitudo, the dissemblance at work in this painted surface, goes back even further: it constitutes the specific interpretation of a whole textual tradition carefully collected in the library of San Marco (the commentaries on Dionysius the Areopagite by Albertus Magnus and Thomas Aquinas), as well as of an ancient figural tradition that reached Italy from Byzantium (the liturgical use of semi-precious multicoloured stones) via Gothic art and Giotto himself (imitation marble in the Scrovegni chapel). All of that served a different temporal paradox: the liturgical repetition - temporal propagation and diffraction - of the constitutive and capital moment of this entire economy, the mythical moment of the incarmation.  

We thus find ourseives before the painted surface as an object of complex, impure temporality: an extraordinary montage of heterogeneous times forming anachronisms. In the dynamic and complexity of this montage, historical notions as fundamental as those of 'style' and 'epoch' suddenly take on a dangerous plasticity (dangerous only for those who would like everything to be in its place once and for all in the same epoch: the fairly common figure of what I shall call the 'historian with time phobia'). So to raise the question of anachronism is to question this fundamental plasticity, and with it the combination - so difficult to analyse - of the temporal differentiation at work in each image. [...]  

Sovereignty of anachronism: in some moments of his present, a Renaissance artist, who had just projected white pigment onto a red fresco ground surrounded by a trompe I'oeil frame, will have rendered permanent for the future this veritable constellation - made image - of heterogeneous times. Sovereignty of anachronism: the historian who today would confine himself to the euchronistic past - to the Zeitgeist of Fra Angelico alone - would completely miss the point of his pictorial act. Anachronism is necessary: it is fertile when the past proves to be insuffcient, that is, forms an obstacle to the understanding of the past. [...]  

In a case like this, therefore, it is not enough to practise art history from the perspective of euchronism, that is to say from the conventional perspective of 'the artist and his time'. What such a visuality demands is that it can be envisaged from the perspective of its memory, that is, its manipulations of time. It is in tracing them that we discover an anachronistic artist, an 'artist against his time'. We should therefore consider Fra Angelico as an artist of the historical past (an artist of his time, the Quattrocento), but also as an artist of the more-than-past of memory (an artist manipulating times that were not his own). This situation gives rise to an additional paradox: if the euchronistic past (lof the artist's contemporary. the humanist Cristofero] Landino) screens or blocks ,the anachronistic more-than-past (Dionysius the Areopogite), how is one to smash the screen in order to remove the obstacle?  

What is needed, I shall venture to say. is one more strange feature that confirms the paradoxical fecundity of anachronism. To gain access to the stratifed multiple times, to the survivals, to the longues durees of the morethan-past of memory, we need the more-than-present of an act of reminiscence: a shock, a tearing of the veil, an irruption or appearance of time, what Proust and Benjamin have described so eloquently under the category of “involuntary memory'. What Landino and all the art historians were incapable of seeing and showing before the mottled painted surface of the fifteenth century - and here comes the anachronism - Jackson Pollock proved himself to be quite capable of seeing and showing. If I try today to recall what stopped me in my tracks in the corridor in San Marco, I think I am not mistaken in saying that it was a kind of displaced resemblance between what I discovered there, in a Renaissance convent, and the drippings of the American artist that I discovered and admired manyyearsbefore.  

It is certain that such a resemblance belongs to the domain of what is called a pseudomorphosis: the relations of analogy between Fra Angelico's mottled surface and a Jackson Pollock painting do not stand up to analysis for long (from the question of horizontality to that of the symbolic meanings). Fra Angelico is in no way the ancestor of action painting, and it would have been simply stupid to look in the projections of pigment in our corridor for any abstract expressionist 'libidinal economy'. Pollock's art, of course, cannot be used for an adequate interpretation of Fra Angelico's spots. But the historian does not get out of it that easily, for the paradox remains, the malaise in the method: it is that the emergence of the historical object as such will have been the result not of a standard - factual, contextual or euchronistic - historical approach but of an almost aberrant anachronistic moment, something like a symptom in historical knowledge. It is the very violence and incongruity, the very difference and unverifiability, that will actually have brought about a lifting of censorship, the emergence of a new object to see, and, beyond that, the constitution of a new problem for art history. [...]  

The history of images is a history of objects that are temporally impure, complex, overdetermined. It is therefore a history of polychronistic, heterochronistic or anachronistic objects. Is it not to say, already, that the history of art is itself an anachronistic discipline, for better and for worse?

The Imperial Palace does not have a restored look, nor has it an ancient one: this hesitation makes it appear not eternal but precarious and like an imitation of itself.  

This is Simone de Beauvoir describing the Forbidden City in Beijing, in her travel memoir The Long March (1957).  

There is nothing accidental about the impermanence of the materials; it is simultaneously the cause,the effect,the expression of a troublingfact; thetraces left upon this palace by the past are so few that, paradoxically, I would hesitate to call it a historical monument.  

These were buildings, Beauvoir recognized, that disguised their own histories of fabrication and subsequent restorations. The Forbidden City transcended the merely human circumstances of its life in time. In the European tradition of the building and making to which Beauvoir was implicitly comparing the Chinese palace, an artefact's historicity is both the source of its authority and the basis for an eventual demystification of that authority. In the modern West, the very old building or painting is venerated for having survived and for testifying with its body to the corrosive effects of the passage of time, a passage that can sometimes be measured precisely, to the year. But by virtue of its anchorage in history, the European building is also a mere product of its time. It is all too obviously contrived by real agents - human beings, not giants, not gods. The Imperial Palace in Beijing seemed to evade all these conditions. Beauvoir did not feel invited either to contemplate the structure's great antiquity or to read it as the index of its times, and so she saw the palace as inauthentic, as an “imitation of itself'. The palace's true self, for Beauvoir, was its historical self.  

[Our] premise is that the Forbidden City is no anomaly. Most cultures have created buildings and artefacts that ‘hesitate' in just the way Beauvoir describes. They resist anchoring in time. Societies tend to coalesce around artefacts that embody institutions, but often on the condition that the historicity of those artefacts - as much as that of the institutions - is masked. Like the buildings of the Forbidden City, such artefacts are not meant to look old, nor are they meant to look as if someone has tried to recover their original look. There is no premium placed on their historical moment of origin, because they are supposed to deliver still older truths. For anyone can see that the possible gain in legitimacy conferred by the marks of time is easily offset by the risk of loss of aura through fixing in time. To fix an image or temple in time is to reduce it to human proportions. [...]  

Chronological time, flowing steadily from before to after, is an effect of its figurations: annuals, chronicles, calendars, clocks. The diagrammatization of time as a series of points strung along a line allows one to speak of diverse events happening in different places as happening at the same time. This is not an obvious concept. The ancient Romans, Denis Feeney has argued, had no notion of linear time and therefore no notion of the date. Instead they saw the myriad interconnections among events and people. Many societies have figured to themselves the ramification, the doubling, the immobilization of time: in the naming of plants and seasons; in the promise of reincarnation; in narratives of the rise and fall of worldly empires understood in cyclical terms; in the time travel of dreams and prophecies; in religious ritual; and, within the Christian tradition, in the mystical parallel between Old and New Dispensations, read between the lines of holy scripture. Such contrivances mirror the sensation, familiar to everyone, of time folding over on itself, the doubling of the fabric of experience that creates continuity and flow; creates meaning where there was none; creates and encourages the desire to start over, to renew, to reform, to recover.  

No device more effectively generates the effect of a doubling or bending of time than the work of art, a strange kind of event whose relation in time is plural.

At that same time it points forward to all its future recipients who will activate and reactivate it as a meaningful event. The work of art is a message whose sender and destination are constantly shifting.

The art historian Aby Warburg (1866-1929), trying to explain the peculiar hold of ancient Greece and Rome on the European imagination right up to his day, spoke of the Nachleben der Antike, the‘afterlife' or‘survival'of antiquity. For Warburg. a painting or a court masque was a dense archive of cultural energies, a dynamogram that concretized and transmitted traumatic, primordial experiences.3 Archaic stimuli were directly imprinted in matter and gesture, Warburg believed, giving figuration the power to disrupt an historical present tense. Warburg's cultural symbol was a token (symbolon) that literally 'throws together' past and present. For Warburg, the painter Sandro Botticelli was not only ‘assimilating' ancient art. Rather, his paintings became installations of ancient gestures. When Warburg described the mysterious continuity of life forces across far-flung chains of symbols, whereby pictorial form delivered, centuries later, the pitch and pulse of primordial emotions, he was describing nothing other than a real virtue of artworks. [...!]  

In the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries, different models of the image's temporality came into conceptual focus, and nowhere more clearly than in the work of art themselves. One powerful model proposed the perfect interchangeability of one image or work for another. Under this model, the work did not merely repeat the prior work, for repetition proposes difference, an altering interval. Rather, the work simply is its own predecessor, such that the prior is no longer prior but present. This model of perfect commutativity among works across time and space flies in the face of the empirical fact that works of art are created by specific people at specific times and then replaced for various reasons. [...]  

According to Paul Valéry, in his essay on the 'method’ of Leonardo da Vinci, creativity is the perception of relations, or a 'law of continuity', between things where others see none. This formulation permits us to understand the chain of substitutions, one work standing in for the next, not as a historical reality but as a fiction that the artist and a viewing public create backward from present to past. The new work. the innovation, is legitimated by the chain of works leading back to an authoritative type. But the chain also needs the new work. It is the new work that selects the chain out of the debris of the past.5 Valéry's phrase gives the model of a perfect substitutability among artefacts a new reality that poses a challenge to the materialist and literalist - one might also say counterintuitive - model of an artwork securely moored in historical time, the model that dominates the modern scholarly study of art.6 I...]  

The power of the image, or the work of art, to fold time was neither discovered nor invented in the Renaissance. What was distinctive about the European Renaissance, so called, was its apprehensiveness about the temporal instability of the artwork, and its re-creation of the artwork as an occasion for reflection on that instability. The work of art ‘anachronizes', from the Greek anachronizein, built from ana-, ‘again', and the verb chronizein, ‘to be late or belated: To anachronize is to be belated again, to linger. The work is late, first because it succeeds some reality that it re-presents, and then late again when that representation is repeated for successive recipients. To many that double postponement came to seem troublesome, calling for correction, compensation, or at the very least, explanation. [...]  

The historian who interprets the work of art as a token within a system of symbolic exchanges opens up a window onto the hidden mechanisms of social power in a remote, vanished society. But such an interpretation tends not to want to take up the possibility of the work's symbolic reach beyond the historical lifeworld that created it - its ability to symbolize realities unknown to its own makers. Only the idea of art can open up this possibility. 'Art' in the name of the possibility of a conversation across time, a conversation more meaningful than the present's merely forensic reconstruction of the past. A materialist approach to historical art leaves the art trapped within its original symbolic circuits. It tends not even to notice that the artwork functioned as a token of power, in its time, precisely by complicating time, by reactivating prestigious forebears, by comparing events across time, by fabricating memories. The only time-bending agency made available to the historical work by a materialist approach is one that reproduces its token-like existence in the symbolic economy of luxury and taste: namely, as an absurdly overvalued heirloom of a modern, consumptionbased society; a collector's item or museum piece, in other words. Such an approach will not help us interpret the messages about time or memory, about the gods or the creation, about first things or last things, phrased in the wordless plastic language or embedded in the material make-up of paintings, sculpture, prints, drawings and buildings.

# Elena Filipovic This is Tomorrow (and Other Modernist Myths)//2007  

We look at the present through a rear-view mirror.   
We march backwards into the future.   
- Marshall McLuhan and Quentin Fiore, The Medium is the Message, 1967  

Once upon a time, the past was the past and the present was today. The two were unmistakably separated and the distance between them was neatly visualized in a forward moving line that sped like a torpedo into the unknown of futurity. The order of things was strict. Or at least, so it had been intuited by nearly every modern history book, bestseller biography and archive classification system. And with this rectilinear and irreversible time came the vision of an inexorably progressive and productive future.  

Modernity is riddled with such myths. After all. doesn't the modern age precisely see itself as a series of revolutions (pictorial, technological, political, socia! ...) that surpasses the past in a progressive march towards the future? Isn't. modernism's incessant drive for the ‘new' dependenf upon the linearity of chronology? Of course, critics of the notion of a homogeneous continuum of time have been quite explicit: Walter Benjamin wrote thesis after thesis about the problem; from his cork-lined bedroom Marcel Proust scribbled thousands of pages in which the temporality of memory was offered as an alternative; and Aby Warburg spent the last five years of his life obsessively reorganizing his response; in an enigmatic anti-chronological visual artefact he called the  

42//BEFORE  

Mnemosyne Atlas.1 The faith in sequential chronology lingers, but these thinkers did leave a legacy of criticality that reminds us, when we sit too comfortably in the armchair of history, that the imperative to rethink time is stil timely.  

Taking this as a starting point, the exhibition Anachronism' [Brussels, 2007] looks at the work of contemporary artists from different generations who have insistently grappled with temporality and history - both universal and personal. More specifically, their work refutes that image of history as a neat trajectory moving smoothly forward across time. They have opted to work against time - creating works that deliberately counter the received ideas of how to represent the chronologies implicit in history's unfolding - be it past, present or future. Using such means as the cinematic cut, spatial dislocation, re-enactment, appropriation or collage, they construct dissonant temporalities within the same work of art. The apparent subjects of the artworks in the exhibition are as diverse as the fall of Communism, the legacy of the modernist project, the repetition of the logic of war, but also marginalized figures, the recurrence of forms or the revision of one's past. Yet, in diverse ways and through various media, these artworks point to the constructedness of all historical narratives through an anachrony that is subtle, complex and at times highly personal.  

Pieces by nearly twenty international contemporary artists - including Boris Belay. Guillaume Bijl, Tobias Buche, David Claerbout, Babak Ghazi, Felix Gmelin, Aneta Grzeszykowska, Erwan Maheo, Deimantas Narcevicius, Sophie Nys, Roman Ondak, Paulina Olowska, Tobias Putrih, Pia Ronicke, Martha Rosler, Bojan Sarcevic and Carl Michael von Hausswolff - are shown alongside the continuous screening of Chris Marker's La Jetée. And, as Marker's inclusion in the exhibition might suggest, the filmmaker's cinematic meditation on the paradoxes of time and memory was not only a source of inspiration for how one might think about the implications of memory and time, but also a recurring subject of conversation in the dialogue with several of the participating artists. It made sense, then, to give this film a place of honour and to bring this historic work into dialogue with works in which Marker's project still continues toresonate.  

But Anachronism' is not a theme or survey show around the ‘subject' of anachronism (indeed none of the works are actually about anachronism per se). Instead, it is an effort to bring together a very diverse body of artworks that, each in their own way, provides a vision of temporality and history that shows both notions to be more elastic, fallible and precarious than traditional chronologies would ever allow. It was thus crucial to such a project to give place to the complexity but also the subtlety of many artistic approaches, even at the risk that a viewer might return home and only later understand why such a work was included. For the wager of this exhibition is to provide not only a context for the presentation of a preoccupation driving some recent critical artistic practices but also a context for reflection on why this matters today. I... ]  

Philosopher Giorgio Agamben underscores the ultimate stakes of this:  

Every conception of history is invariably accompanied by a certain experience of time, which is implicit in it, conditions it, and thereby has to be elucidated. Similarly, every culture is first and foremost a particular experience of time, and no new culture is possible without an alteration in this experience. The original task of a genuine revolution, therefore, is never merely to'change the world', but also and above all to'change time'.2  

If, then, the possibility of changing the world lies above all in the effort to 'change time', the promise of these artworks is that through them we might all the better be able to read and question our past (and present) and thus also possibly redefine the course of the future. Because, as the narrator of Chris Marker's La Jetee tells us, there is 'no way to escape Time'.

# Amelia Groom This is So Contemporary!//2012  

In Shakespeare's Julius Caesar (1599), Brutus - while plotting to assassinate the emperor - is interrupted by the striking of a clock. Shakespeare was without doubt fully aware that silent sundials marked time in ancient Rome, and the invention of the mechanical clock came more than a millennium later. The charge of anachronistic error here would itself be an anachronistic error, since in Shakespeare's time it wouldn't have been perceived as an error at all. Our present notion of historic realism is a historically specific construct, and for many centuries prior to its advent artistic representations were overtly anachronistic without jarring their audience. Christ was depicted in contemporary garb throughout the Middle Ages, for instance, and there are countless other images from the pre-Enlightenment canon that overtly disregard accurate chronology.  

With the Greek roots of the word suggesting something ‘up against time', our present conception of anachronism presupposes a homogenous and irreversible temporal sequence, with all points fixed to their proper coordinates in an orderly procession. A glaring anachronistic anomaly in historic representation generally amounts to an embarrassing blunder, or a joke - as with the tenth-century peasant in Monty Python and the Holy Grail ( 1975) earnestly explaining his village as an'anarcho-syndicalist commune'.  

But whether or not we like it, the present always makes itself present in attempts to reconstitute other times. Any scholastic historical account or fictional tale that requires constructing an imagined past (and there is no other type of past) is likely to have something out of place - most conspicuously in its physical objects, cultural references, manners, turns of phrase or hairstyles. Once the present catches up, futurism also finds itself subject to anachronism - as evidenced by the many books and films nominally set in the 21st century or later that refer to the Soviet Union or the World Trade Center as if they still exist. Part of the preInternet 1989 film Back to the Future I's charm is its assumption that fax machines are still ubiquitous in 2015. True fidelity to a time that is not our own simply isn't possible, and anachronism always already resides in the present, composed as it is of various remembered pasts and anticipated futures.  

In his Untimely Meditations (1876) Friedrich Nietzsche demanded 'the capacity to feel unhistorically'. In recent years, other philosophers have called upon us to acknowledge and strategically deploy anachronism: Giorgio Agamben and Michel Serres are particularly lucid on the instabilities of chronology and the multiplicity of disjunctive times that make up the present. They find unrealized potential in the archaic and obsolete, suggesting that old objects, techniques and ideas might just be waiting, unsatisfied with the limits of their epochs.  

With growing awareness of the tempora! complexities at play in every work of art, the discipline of art history also appears to be tentatively adjusting to new thinking on non-linear time. Critical debates on issues of temporality in this thing we precariously name 'contemporary art' are being led by Terry Smith. Keith Moxey and others. Following the dynamic discontinuity of Aby Warburg's approach to images in the early twentieth century. thinkers such as Georges Didi-Huberman are envisaging cross-cutting methods that embrace what is variously termed 'polychronic', 'heterochronic' and ‘anachronic' readings of art history. Concurrently. there has in recent years been a wave of exhibitions that seek to do away with correct chronological sequence and the confines of cultural context, in order to suggest that the time and place in which a thing was made should not shut it off from other times and places.  

Some examples: In 2009, Turner-prize winner Mark Wallinger's exhibition 'The Russian Linesman' at London's Hayward Gallery suggested surprising correspondences between vastly different objects spanning two millennia, with the artist's own Time and Relative Dimensions in Space (2o01) - a lifesized gleaming mirrored replica of Doctor Who's TARDIs - bringing home the notion of traversing multiple space-times from a single point. The 2003-9 touring exhibition ‘History of History' (which was variously manifested in museums across the US and Canada before culminating at the 21st Century Art Museum in Kanazawa) saw the Japanese contemporary artist and collector of East Asian antiquities Hiroshi Sugimoto establish conversations between new works and pieces of material culture from distant pasts. For his 2010 'solo show' at the Neue Nationalgalerie in Berlin, 'Intolerance', the Dutch artist Willem de Rooij presented a series of animal portraits from the Golden Age of Dutch painting alongside feathered ceremonial headdresses from eighteenth-century Hawaii. referring to the display as part of his ongoing work with 'spatial collage'.  

More examples: in 2004 Mike Kelley's'The Uncanny' at the Museum Moderner Kunst in Vienna had the likes of Christo and Paul McCarthy alongside mediaeval reliquaries, anatomical models and ancient Egyptian grave furnishings. Simon Starling's exhibition 'Never The Same River (Possible Futures. Probable Pasts)' at London's Camden Arts Centre in 2010 slipped between different histories in the present as the artist restaged works frorn its shows of the last half-century. In 2012 at The National Museum of Denmark, artist Julie Sass and curator Milena Hoegsberg invited 28 artists and writers to respond to the museum's prehistoric collection. Aptly titled 'Shaped by Time', this exhibition set up fragmented pasts in dialogue with the present in order to consider the construct of history and reveal its malleability. And at the more high-profile end of things, the 2011 Venice  

Biennale, curated by Bice Curiger, included paintings by Tintoretto amongst its line-up of new art, and the curator of 2012's Documenta, Carolyn ChristovBakargiev, similarly proposed that all things in the visual field can be treated as con-temporary (literally 'together with time').  

Making no distinction between art that is old and art that is new, the Museum of Old and New Art opened in Australia in 2011, housing David Walsh's enormous private collection. On show there in 2012 is 'Theatre of the World', an exhibition by the French curator Jean-Hubert Martin that brings together objects spanning four thousand years of history, with a display model that harks back to the Wunderkammers of Renaissance Europe (and Andre Breton's atelier at 42 Rue Fontaine in Paris) in its overt disregard for the conventions of cultural and historical context. Martin has spent several decades provoking outcry for his experiments with de-compartmentalizing art objects, including the controversial and blatantly anachronistic exhibition Artempo' at the Palazzo Fortuny, Venice, in 2007 (co-curated with Mattijs Visser and Axel Vervoordt). His argument is that while orthodox art historians tend stubbornly to grasp at the categories they have retrospectively invented for art, artists have never treated art as something that fits neatly into chronological sequence, with one thing being influenced by what was before and developing into what comes next.  

Similar sentiments were expressed in the early 1960s by the Mesoamerican art historian George Kubler, whose book The Shape of Time: Remarks on the History of Things (1962) famously resonated with the likes of Robert Smithson, [[Ad Reinhardt]], John Baldessari, Robert Morris and other US artists associated with Minimal, conceptual and Land art. Dismissing the rhetoric of progress in favour of more chaotic models of time, Kubler outlined how artistic innovation, replication and mutation never unfold in a single, unbroken direction. History's movements are turbulent, and art will always refuse to tell a fixed, unified story. The Shape of Time showed us that our segmentation of the past is purely arbitrary and conventional; an imposition of linear order on something that is infinitely more fluid and complex.  

Another well-known, vehement opposer of sequentialism and the rigid categorization of art was Jorge Luis Borges.'The true intellectual refuses to take part in contemporary debates, he wrote in his 1941 essay 'Two Books', because 'reality is always anachronous'. Continually returning to the ways in which times overlap and the present reworks the past, he also wrote that 'every writer creates his own precursors' ('Kafka and his Precursors', 1951). This is true not just of literature; all worthwhile art modifies our conception of what went before it, and what comes after it. Kubler also remarked that as one's knowledge of Auguste Rodin forever changes one's understanding of Michelangelo, historic time is always at once progressive and regressive.  

Expressing greater pride in the books he read than the books he wrote. Borges was certainly one of the best (most committed, curious, imaginative. sensitive, thorough and grateful) readers of the twentieth century. Immersing himself in the literature, philosophy and theology of Spanish, English, French, German, Italian, Anglo-Saxon and Old Norse traditions. he also followed contemporary Argentinean writers and read translations of Middle Eastern and Asian texts. But he wouldn't have approved of the divisions made in that last sentence: he read everything as coevally alive in the present, loathing the idea of categorizing a book according to date, place or literary school. In the same vein, the essays and stories he wrote wouid form extraordinary links between obscure thoughts and images of disparate origins that shared no commonality in time or space, demonstrating his insistence on the oneness of things beyond the illusions of individuality.  

I like the exclamatory title of Tino Sehgal's work for the German Pavilion at the 51st Venice Biennale in 2005 so much that I plagiarized it for the title of this article. Drawing on contemporary art's peculiar insecurity about its own contemporary-ness, it indexes a fundamental paradox - in one sense nothing can exist and not be contemporary: in another, any new thing that enters the realm of existence is immediately relegated to the past. When we are presented with old art and new art together on equal terms, divisions become slippery and the past is made available for communicative interaction with the present. We form new associations. and possibly face up to contradictions we'd rather not acknowledge. The inclusion of things in displays of contemporary art that are neither strictly 'contemporary' nor 'art' is not. as some have suggested, a mere fleeting curatorial trend. It's part of a broader growing awareness of the anachronism inherent in all time. After the failed productive-progressivism of modernity. we're dealing with the fact that then and now and later aren't proceeding along a flat line; they're unpredictably and disobediently tangled up with each other.

# Geoffrey Batchen Life and Death//2010  

For far too long photography has been haunted by a spectre of its own making. the spectre of death. Photographs, so it is said, always capture a moment in the past, a moment that we subsequently view in the present. To look at a photograph is therefore to experience a temporal movement back and forth between past and present; it is to witness the passing of time in general. As a consequence. photographs can't help but draw attention to our own imminent passing. Simultaneously presenting us with a 'that has been' and a 'this will be'. they prophesy our death at some unknown time in the future. Whether or not the subject is already dead, every photograph is this catastrophe. Or so, in an oft-quoted passage, claims Roland Barthes in Camera Lucida ( 1980). The passage helps explain the discomfort we sometimes feel in front of photographs. But it doesn't explain why we also keep coming back to them, and why those same photographs remain so compelling. This exhibition ['Suspending Time: LifePhotography-Death', Shizuoka, 2010] aims to offer such an explanation. It seeks to complicate Barthes' aphorism by accentuating the capacity of certain genres of photography to suspend its subjects, and ourselves, somewhere between life and death, thereby offering a permanent deferral of the otherwise fatal onset of passing time. [...]  

Barthes, stricken with grief over the passing of his own mother two years before, indissolubly associated photography with death. However the whole narrative force of Barthes' book is dependent on the capacity of photographs to alleviate this same catastrophe. The book was initiated, he tells us in an earlier interview, by 'a fascination with what has died but is represented as wanting to be alive'. Accordingly, on the same page in Camera Lucida where he comments on the ‘catastrophe' inherent to all photographs, he also concedes that there is 'always a defeat of time in them'. Looking at an old snapshot of two little girls, he exclaims how alive they are!' It is precisely this transcendence of time's passage, this photographic rendition of its subject as simultaneously alive and dead, and therefore as neither, that so moves him in front of a photograph of his mother as a little girl. Apparently only photographs can provide this kind of suspension, a capacity that, Barthes says in his last few pages, is the source both of photography's ecstasy and its madness. [...]

# Augustine Time and Eternity//397-98  

[...J What is time? Who can explain this easily and briefly? Who can comprehend this even in thought, so as to articulate the answer in words? Yet of what do we speak, in our familiar everyday conversation, more than time? We surely know what we mean when we speak of it. We also know what is meant when we hear someone else speaking of it. What then is time? Provided no one asks me, I know. If I want to explain it to an enquirer, I do not know. But I confidently affirm myself to know that if nothing passes away there is no past time, and if nothing arrives there is no future time, and if nothing existed there would be no present time. Take the two tenses, past and future. How can they 'be', when the past is not now present and the future is not yet present? Yet if the present were always present, it would not pass into the past: it would not be time but eternity. If then, in order to be time at all, the present is so made that it passes into the past, how can we say that this present also ‘is'? The cause of its being is that it will cease to be. So indeed we cannot truly say that time exists except in the sense that it tends towardsnon-existence.  

Nevertheless we speak of 'a long time' and 'a short time', and it is only of the past or the future that we say this. Of the past we speak of 'a long time', when, for example, it is more than a hundred years ago. A long time' in the future may mean a hundred years ahead. By 'a short time ago' we would mean, say, ten days back, and'a short time ahead' might mean 'in ten days' time'. But how can something be long or short which does not exist? For the past now has no existence and the future is not yet. So we ought not to say of the past, it is long', but 'it was long', and of the future 'it will be long. My Lord, my light, does not your truth mock humanity at this point? This time past which was long. was it long when it was past or when it was still present? It could be long only when it existed to be long. Once past, it no longer was. Therefore it could not be long if it had entirely ceased to exist. [...}]  

All the hours of night and day add up to twenty-four. The first of them has the others in the future, the last has them in the past. Any hour between these has past hours before it, future hours after it. One hour is itself constituted of fugitive moments. Whatever part of it has flown away is past. What remains to it is future. If we can think of some bit of time which cannot be divided into even the smallest instantaneous moments, that alone is what we can call 'present'. And this time flies so quickly from future into past that it is an interval with no duration. If it has duration, it is divisible into past and future. But the present occupies no space. [...]  

50//BEFORE  

For the mind expects and attends and remembers, so that what it expects passes through what has its attention to what it remembers. Who therefore can deny that the future does not yet exist? Yet already in the mind there is an expectation of the future. Who can deny that the past does not now exist? Yet there is still in the mind a memory of the past. None can deny that present time lacks any extension, because it passes in a flash. Yet attention is continuous, and it is through this that what will be present progresses towards being absent. So the future, which does not exist, is not a long period of time. A long future is a long expectation of the future. And the past, which has no existence, is not a long period of time. A long past is a long memory of the past. I...]

# Dogen Zenji Uji (Existence-Time)// 1240  

We can never measure how long and distant or how short and pressing twelve hours is; at the same time, we call it 'twelve hours'. The leaving and coming of the directions and traces [of Time] are clear, and so people do not doubt it. They do not doubt it, but that does not mean they know it. The doubts which living beings, by our nature, have about every thing and every fact that we do not know, are not consistent; therefore our past history of doubt does not always exactly match our doubt now. We can say for the present, however, that doubt is nothing other than Time. We put our self in order, and see [the resulting state] as the whole Universe. Each individual and each object in this whole Universe should be glimpsed as individual moments in Time. [...]  

The whole of Existence, the whole Universe, exists in individual moments of Time. Let us pause to reflect whether or not any of the whole of Existence or any of the whole Universe has leaked away from the present moment of Time. I...] [Wjhen I was climbing a mountain or crossing a river, I was there in that Time. There must have been Time in me. And I actually exist now, [so] Time could not have departed. If Time does not have the form of leaving and coming, the Time of climbing a mountain is the present as Existence-Time. If Time does retain the form of leaving and coming, I have this present moment of Existence-Time, which is just Existence-Time itself2 How could that Time of climbing the mountain and crossing the river fail to swallow, and fail to vomit, this Time [now] in the jewelled palace with crimson towers?3 I...]  

We should not understand only that Time flies. We should not learn that 'flying' is the only ability of Time. If we just left Time to fly away, some gaps in it might appear. Those who fail to experience and to hear the truth of ExistenceTime do so because they understand [Time] only as having passed. To grasp the pivot and express it: all that exists throughout the whole Universe is lined up in a series and at the same time is individual moments of Time. [...]  

Existence-Time has the virtue of passing in a series of moments. That is to say, from today it passes through a series of moments to tomorrow; from today it passes through a series of moments to yesterday; from yesterday it passes through a series of moments to today: from today it passes through a series of moments to today; and from tomorrow it passes through a series of moments to tomorrow. Because passage through separate moments is a virtue of Time, moments of the past and present are neither piled up one on top of another nor lined up in a row. I...]  

1 [translator's footnote 13 in source] ‘Time which does not have the form of leaving and coming' means instantaneous time, as opposed to time as a linear progression. If we see Time in this way. even a continuous process - like crossing a mountain - is moments of the present.   
2 [14]'Time which retains the form of leaving and coming' means linear time. If we see time in this way. even though the moment of the present has arrived and it will depart, it exists now. Master Dogen's view of real time embraces both the view of time as a point and the view of time as a line, aswell as the view of time as reality itself.   
3 [15] Past time swallowing present time suggests the inclusive character of time. Past time vomiting present time suggests the independence of the past and the present.

# Paul Chan A Time Apart//2010  

The Greeks had two notions of time: chronos and kairos. Chronos, which we are more familiar with, is the concept of time as measure, a quantity of duration that changes in a uniform and serial order. Chronos is, in a sense, empty; without content or meaning beyond its own linear progressing. It is when nothing happens, and goes on not happening.  

Kairos, on the other hand, is a kind of time charged with promise and significance. It is time that saturates time. The dimensions that characterize kairos are neither uniform nor predictable. The phrase 'the fullness of time' evokes the kairological, in the way it expresses the idea that time can be fulfilled and made anew through a profound change or rupture of some kind, making what happens thereafter radically unlike what had come before.  

Kairos and chronos are not opposed to each other. One of the most interesting definitions of kairos comes from the Corpus Hippocraticum. It reads, 'chronos is that in which there is kairos, and kairos is that in which there is little chronos.' The two kinds of time are part of one another. Chronos transforms into kairos by becoming a compressed form of itself, embodying a temporal disruption that dispenses with uniformity. Hegel touched upon this kind of change in his dialectics through his concept of the 'transition from quantity to quality'. This is where something - such as time - acquires a substance that sets it apart, and makes the thing literally unaccountable to the sequence from which it derives. Quality is a force that 'aparts'. In kairos, time is not kept: it is unleashed.  

'Right timing' is another way the Greeks referred to kairos. For them, qualitative time can only be achieved through human intervention. The power to act and take advantage of a special event or action that appears over the unfolding course of things is crucial to the nature of kairos. But this cannot happen at any time. Only at opportune moments, when time holds the most potential for change, is kairos possible. But again, only if the opportunity is seized and acted upon. Kairos is that critical point in time when a crisis or rupture opens up and is catalysed with human will to create new potentials.  

A long tradition exists connecting kairos to art. It is fairly boring and mainly attributable to Plato. Platonic aesthetics is based on principles of harmony, symmetry and measure. The beautiful, for Plato, is that which in words, images, sounds or movements, attains a unity-in-plurality. The idea of kairos as right timing is reimagined by Plato as aesthetic and ethical propriety, or the power of proportion to harmonize elements into a proper balance. The beautiful, once achieved, is really the idea of goodness, wholly embodied. For what the beautiful offers the worid is a vision of life in harmonious balance with itself and the divine.  

Echoes of Plato's aesthetics resound in art. They can be heard every time something 'comes together'. They are heard in the demand (by artists and critics alike) that all the elements that make up a work play their compositional part to produce a meaningful, that is to say coherent, idea.  

But art that works best does so by making a mockery of meaning. Art is art when what is made unmakes itself in the making and realizes, in barely recognizable form, the discordant truth of living life.  

Against Plato, this notion of art actually relates to an even earlier designation of kairos in Greek thought. As far as we know, the first appearance of kairos was in the liad. But Homer did not use it to mean the power of proportion or qualitative time. Rather, it denoted a vital or lethal place in the body, a place that demands special protection. Kairos is the place where mortality resides.  

What is the relationship between mortality and time? Maybe it is that time holds import only when something ends. The phrase, 'all good things must come to an end' is half the story (and not the right half). For what makes something good may not be the beautiful - pace Plato - but how a thing happens to apprehend its own end. Being mortal means the end is ever near, Realizing this. charges every moment with promise and significance. And it makes what matters less dependent on the power of fate, and more on the inner imperative to find a shape of one's own, before it is too late.  

Being mortal means making good on the task of fully inhabiting one's own demise. Time becomes meaningful only in this way. The same holds true for art. To make something by subjecting it to the same forces that make life unlivable, and to do it as ifits aesthetic life depends on it, charges what is made with an incalculable urgency. Art acquires a quality through this process: it becomes mortal.  

Art's essential discord today may come from artists struggling to achieve a form that is mortal. Everyone is an artist, the story goes, and everything can be art. True enough. But not everything that is art is mortal. There are crates and barrels of work being made that act as if they hold the secret to the good, that is to say the eternal, life. They express in endless formal variations the values that define tradition in art and history. And by tradition, I mean the habits of authority: the patterns and practices associated with a certain way of life that imagines progress asdomination.  

These works bid for a place in that tradition by moulding into new and fresh shapes the motives, references and experiences that tradition promotes as timeless: the tried and true. By sensualizing tradition into contemporary forms. these works become valued by an economic and social order that treats novelty as evidence of its commitment to innovation and progress, which in turn becomes a form of self-justification to naturalize the right to advance its rule in perpetuity. As if it was destined. And inevitable. Like time passing.  

There are many kinds of art today. Or at the very least, two. If chronological art stands for the endless, and ultimately empty, serialization of a few traditional ideas that serve to enforce the values of the good life (this is especially the case with art that debases those values for the sake of romanticizing them through their sacrifice), then what does a kairological art look and feel like?  

At a glance kairological artworks look no different than other works. They use the same materials and show in the same shows. They say and mean nothing in particular. But it is how they say it (and mean it) that sets them apart They embody a desperate immanence, as if what is given is not good enough but will have to do. They seize time the way a beat holds a song, to evoke the vertiginous feeling of seeing something emerge by being made and unmade at the same instant. They last as experiences by not staying whole as forms. They radiate an inner irreconcilability about what they are and what they want to be with serious and unrestrained abandon, which is as close as it comes to an honest insight about the plight of living today. This radiance is what makes them pleasurable. Lively.  

And this. They break time out of joint.  

$$
{\pmb{\emptyset}}=\mathsf{T}^{\mathrm{n}}/\{\Delta\mathsf{H}\mathbf{x}\mathsf{1}\sim\mathsf{N}\}
$$  

This is why they rarely console, as art perhaps ought to, in these great times. They remain, in the end, comfortless, as a reminder to anyone willing to engage them just how little time there is left, for anyone, and all that has been lost, how close it all is from disappearing, and what it takes to go on.

# Daniel Birnbaum Paul Chan's The 7 Lights//2007  

Asked where to start an analysis of his work, Paul Chan replied:  

You should start where your book ends. At the end of Chronology (2005/2007) you ask where the new fold' will come from, a new sense of time, a new chronology. For me The 7 Lights represents a testing of what this'new' time might look and feel like. People have told me how 1st Light makes them feel suspended in a 'time' that both is and isn't that of the exhibition. And I think that this feeling comes not only from a re-evaluation of what a 'projected image' is or can be, but also from making time-based works whose 'time' doesn't draw from the well of chronos. Rather kairos is its source.  

So let's begin: first there is light, an illuminated quadrangle on the floor. In complete silence black lines emerge - suddenly a telephone pole appears like a black cross. It remains the only stable object that can offer a sense of orientation and scale. Birds fly by horizontally, lots of birds. Then there are objects floating upwards, seemingiy drawn by some irresistible force that makes them defy gravity. All that is visible are black silhouettes, but we can immediately identify the dark shapes: a cell phone is followed by further flip design phones opening up like flowers in the air. In the distance, clusters of objects rise continuously. and then, very close to us, comes an iPod, a pair of glasses and an entire car that loses its wheels while floating upwards. All of a sudden there is a counter-current of falling human bodies. They drop downwards, precipitously - gravity is still functioning after all. A human couple is holding hands whilst hurtling down. Simultaneously, large objects keep rising: motor vehicles, an 'entire train .. Occasionally, large abstract forms blot out the light field almost entirely.  

The projected rectangle on the floor gives one the sense that what we really see are shadows cast by objects falling and drifting skywards outside a large window. The light out there must be strong because the cast shadows are sharp. A world of shades is all we get; there is no turning around to scrutinize the things themselves, and no glimpse of a world outside of the window bathing in generous sunlight. Before the silhouettes appear, all we see is a quadrangle of lighted space. As the last body has disappeared into the invisible abyss the abstract quadrangle again rules supreme. Slowly, the white light turns into deeppinkishpurple.  

No one who sees Paul Chan's mesmerizing animation 1st Light, the first part of his ongoing cycle The 7 Lights, can avoid thinking of the people who jumped from the flaming towers of the World Trade Center, and yet this artistic rendering of the disintegration of worldly things and the brutal elimination of human lives has nothing exploitative about it. Instead it creates a calm and meditative atmosphere; the viewer is lulled into a state in which time seems to be coming to a halt Somehow one is suspended in another time, and numerous writers have tried to come to grips with this temporal dimension in Chan's work. The critic Johanna Burton describes it as being 'weirdly removed fron time, even as it reflects upon it'2 In a recent discussion about his art, the artist himself elaborated on the aspiration to collapse linear time, and contends, Linear time is neither reality nor concept: it is a bad habit.'3 So what kind of temporal experience is this work trying to generate? If chronology is no longer the rule of the game. what could possibly have taken its place? The animation is fundamentally split in two: daylight (or shadow time) takes around nine minutes, while night-time (just pure colours) takes around four. This goes for the five first chapters of the cycle; they all move from the abstraction of pure light projected in a rectangle to more and more elaborate silhouettes that create a sense of a cosmos in a state of disintegration: things, no doubt, are falling apart, the world is crumbling. Then the calmness of pure light returns.  

Further spatial variations take place: the projection of 5th Light is triangular in shape and appears at the very edge of the floor, in such a manner that the falling shadows appear slightly blurred on the wall as well. In many ways, 6th Light is similar to Ist Light, except that the colours have disappeared. The falling bodies appear only at night, and the shadows no longer seem to represent recognizable objects; the shapes are all abstract. The settings of each in this series are quite distinct, but some basic principles remain the same: worldly objects and animals are drifting skywards, human beings drop precipitously. mostly one by one. Sometimes there is another, horizontal, movement. In 2nd Light, the setting of which the artist characterizes as rural (that of 1st Light being cleariy urban), a kind of procession of primitive poles and flags represents the horizontal dimension - perhaps comparable to the birds of the first part. A robust tree with branches and leaves shivering in the breeze frames the action. One sees humans tumble through the foliage.  

3rd Light, which involves a sculptural element (a three-dimensional replica of the table in Leonardo da Vinci's Last Supper), clearly accentuates the theological quality. and naturally the first object one sees floating upwards is an apple (followed by chairs and dogs). Asked if he is actively interested in the Christian trope of the fall, the artist replies with a Nietzschean twist, "Yes, but only if I can turn it upside down.: Certainly. Genesis provides a key point of reference. So why are there seven lights?  

Does it take a week for the world totally to fall apart? The artist gives a very matter-of-fact answer, devoid of symbolism and numerology: 'When I started working on Ist Light (not knowing it was to be a series, or called 1st Light). I sketched out how else the projection could work physically. And I came up with six other ways. So that's how I came up with seven.' On the other hand. Chan provides a line directly from Genesis as a reference for his cycle (besides numerous other sources from philosophy. poetry and the visual arts - from Novalis. Baudelaire and Ashbery to Man Ray. James Turrell and Kara Walker): 'And God made two great lights; the greater light to rule the day. and the lesser light to rule the night. (Genesis. 1:16). If 3rd Light is the part with the strongest religious connotations. the following and, to date, rmost recent episode, 4th Light, has an inherently secular setting that makes one think of a decrepit office in an industrial complex. Viewed through the geometries of a spider web, a box is seen opening up and a drill machine emerges, soon followed by two other tools and mumerous old-style telephones. Everything is floating in the sky. This, it would seem, is a pretty uninspiring place; not exactly the typical location for eschatological speculations. And yet, eschatology seems to be what the work is about. Is this the end of time, or more precisely. the time of the end? Again, if chronology is no longer the rule of the game, what could possibly have taken its place? Undoubtedly. Chan proffers this work as a glimpse into a specific type of temporality, or perhaps one should rather say a specific sensation of time. When asked where to begin an attempt to say something theoretically valid about his work, he refers to the notion of kairos and to Walter Benjamin's writings about the now (Jetztzeit): For me, his notion of messianic time is the most modern reconfiguration of kairos we have. I think this is why The 7 Lights have an aura of the theological.'  

In his recent essay on messianic time, The Time that Remains, Giorgio Agamben explores the aporias involved in all spatial representations of temporality in general and the messianic moment as described by Saint Paul in particular.4 The book is divided into six 'days', followed by a last chapter titled 'Threshold' (thus a seven-fold structure that seems to me about as accidental as the seven episodes of Chan's Lights series). The crucial distinction is between secular time, chronos, which spans from the creation of the world to its end, and the messianic event (for Saint Paul, the resurrection of Christ). This is the time of kairos, the moment when, in Agamben's words, time 'contracts itself and begins to end'. The messianic time is neither in secular time nor radically outside time. Time 'explodes' here, or rather it 'implodes into eternity'. According to Benjamin, every second is this portal through which the Messiah could enter. (And) it could be right now.  

The impossibility of rendering these temporal aporias visible is as ancient an issue as messianic speculation itself, and no matter how ambitious Chan's post  

9/11 series of projected shadows, this theme will be legible only to those who choose to read the disintegration of things in these terms.Does the work have a political dimension, or is the exploration of the worid of mesmerizing shadows an end in itself? 'Art or politics?' some critics have asked, stubbornly insisting that the line must be drawn even in these times of radically messianic politics. Perhaps it is more rewarding to consider how the work of this artist, who also happens to be a particularly fearless political activist, makes obvious that productive contamination is a more rewarding path to follow. The 7 Lights, says the artist, is a work about light and light that has been 'struck out' (shadows). It is also - this must be obvious even to a viewer uninterested in messianic themes - a meditation on a world falling apart. A harmoniously closed cycle would have been a strange statement in a world characterized by uncertainty, and the last piece in the series to a certain extent leaves things open. The cycle is fractured, broken. 7th Light is not a projection at all. In fact, says Chan, there is no 7th Light. What he offers the viewer instead is a score set in traditional musical notation: Yt is “misused" to accommodate what I need to get out of the language, which is to compose and transpose an essentially silent, moving image work onto fourteensheetsof paper.'  

It is an unfinished piece in the sense that there is only the 'composition' (or score) for 7th Light, but not the thing-in-itself. This, says Chan, is because he wanted to make a work that is not tied to 'instruments' at all.  

1 Taking kairological time as a starting point clearly leads to a radically different notion of the subject. Chan's suggestion implies that his own work does not really fit into the logic of the temporal fold as the ‘archetype of the relationship of self to self (Merleau-Ponty) explored in these pages as a turning back of time towards itself. Insisting on the verticality of a different kind of time could lead to a consideration of forms of subjectivation based on ethics rather than epistemology. We would have to start in Kant's second Critique rather than in the first, and the exploration would no doubt take us from the Kantian notion of Achtung to more recent attempts to define ethical time.

# Daniel Rosenberg The Trouble with Timelines//2004  

In 1765, Joseph Priestley published a chart representing the lives of famous men by means of lines arrayed chronologically against a scale of 2,950 years. Priestley's Chart of Biography was not the first timeline. It had a direct precedent in Jacques Barbeu-Dubourg's 1753 Chronological Chart and earlier roots in chronologies and genealogies, calendars and canon tables, and traditional forms of narrative imagery depicting historical events. Despite the persistence of cyclical gestures, a 1627 chart of the events of the coming apocalypse by Joseph Mede already has something of the modern timeline about it. But none of this made Priestley's chart any less striking in its day. In fact, the idea of a timeline was stil strange enough in the mid eighteenth century that it required a certain amount of explanation. In his accompanying pamphlet, Priestley argued that although time in itself is an abstraction that may not be'the object of any of our senses, and no image can properly be made of it. yet because it has a relation to quantity, and we can say agreater or less space of time. it admits of a natural and easy representation in our minds by the idea of a measurable space, and particularly that of a LINE'!  

After Priestley. the form of the timeline caught on. In addition to its visual effectiveness, the timeline amplified conceptions of historical progress that were becoming popular at the time. The relationship was mutually reinforcing. As Priestley himself suggests, the timeline filed in as a kind of fantasized visual referent for an object without material substance. In its simplest form, it appeared to guarantee the simplicity and directionality of past and future history. But Priestiey's commentary points to a problem too. History had never actually taken the form of a timeline or of any other line for that matter. And simplicity. the great advantage of the form, threatened also to be its greatest flaw. The timeline could function as ‘the most excellent mechanical help to the knowledge of history' because it could impress the imagination 'indelibly'2 For the same reason,a century later, Henri Bergson would refer to the'imaginary homogeneous time' depicted by the timeline as a deceiving 'idol.3  

But already in Priestley's day. the problem of the linear representation of time was posed with precision by writers such as Laurence Sterne. whose 1760 Tristram Shandy satirized the idea of telling a story straight. Sterne's novel even includes a set of sketches indicating the digressive form of a story well and truly told. In fact, Sterne and Priestley are much more similar than they may appear. For Priestley. the timeline is a heuristic, an 'excellent mechanical help'. For Sterne, the linear representation of time is a construction:  

60//BEFORE  

Could a historiographe1 drive on his history, as a muleteer drives on his mule - straight forward - for instance, from Rome all the way to Loretto, without ever once turning his head aside either to the right hand or to the left - he might venture to foretell you an hour when he should get to his journey's end: but the thing is, morally speaking, impossible. For if he is a man of the least spirit, he will hiave fifty deviations from a straight line to make with this or that party as he goes along, which he can no ways avoid. He will have views and prospects to himself perpetually soliciting his eye, which he can no more help standing still to look at than he can fly.4  

Both Priestley and Sterne point to the technical ingenuity and the intensity of the labour required to support a fantasy of linear time. Over the course of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, the convention of the timeline was progressively naturalized But its development tended also to raise new questions. Filling in an ideal timeline with more and better data only pushed it towards the absurd. Dubourg's Chronological Chart, mounted on a scroll and encased in a decorative box, was already 54 feet long. Later attempts to re-anchor the timeline in material reference, as in the case of Charles-Joseph Minard's 1869 diagram, Figurative Chart of the Successive Loss of Men in the French Army in the Russian Campaign, 1812-1813, produced results that were beautiful but ultimately put into question the promise of the modern timeline. The visual simplicity of the diagram is paradigmatic, as is the numbing pathos of its articulation across the space of the Russian winter. At the same time, through colour, angle and shape, Minard's chart marks the centrality of the idea of reversal in the thinking and telling of history. Minard's chart may be more accurate than Priestley's, not because it carries more or better historical detail but because it reads in the way a story might be told. The same could be said for the branching timeline in Charles Renouvier's 1876 Uchronia (Utopia in History): An Apocryphal Sketch of the Development of European Civilization Not as It Was But as It Might Have Been, depicting both the actual course of history and the various alternative paths that might have been if other actions had been taken.  

The problems presented by twentieth-century versions of the timeline arise from different sources. In most important respects, the conceptual issues were already on the table in the eighteenth century. But the twentieth century brought developments in time reckoning that gave timelines new poignancy. In 1945, it became relevant for the first time to tell world history in terms of milliseconds, and, very soon, it also became necessary to start thinking in practical terms about the transmission of information over the course of the very long term. There is something more than a little sobering about the recurrence of the cyclical form in the US government glyph for the declining radioactivity of nuclear waste stored in Yucca Mountain. In it, there may be an  

# echo of Joseph Mede's indecision about the appropriateness of applying the linear form to an apocalyptic narrative.

# Mieke Bal Sticky Images: The Foreshortening of Time in an Art of Duration//2000  

I ... I Time is the stuff of history. In a historical perspective, art is examined through the perspective of change over time. This change is analysed in terms of periods, movements, styles, tendencies and influences. All these concepts presuppose two notions: that time is a continuum that can be divided, and that art is bound to the socio-cultural environment within which it comes into existence. If applied with due caution and quantification, both of these assumptions have enough plausibility to lend themselves for use in standard accounts of the history of art.  

There is, however, also an altogether different relation between art and time: that which concerns time in the image. This relation is likewise grounded in two assumptions. The first concerns representation. In spite of claims to the contrary,in spite, even, of a culture where the media dominate and words and images can no longer be separated, the double binary opposition between space and time and between image and language continues to persist in thinking about visual images. Images unfold in space, texts in time. This assumption has prevailed for centuries, and no critique of it will eradicate it, even though it is quite obviously false. It is based on the idea that a text needs time in order to be read; but so does an image. It also presupposes that an image takes space; but so, too, does text. I...}  

62//BEFORE  

The second assumption is an ontological one. It stipulates that images are in time, that they are still objects which, if well preserved, can last without changing. Although it is obvious that images can evoke or represent time - the past, the future, or two or more moments simultaneously - it is more difficult to see how they can be in time without simultaneously unfolding that being in time as film and literature do: in a sequential development; a time axis whose continuity moves forward. The temporal realism that sticks to those media is just as tenacious as the confusion outlined above, even if different rhythms can bring temporal variation into play, as in fact they routinely do in those media. [...]  

Subject to change in time, Jeannette Christensen's Jell-O works inscribe time, and thus inscribe the installations themselves in time, as an intervention in the present, in a culture whose lengthy past makes the present appear hasty and time-ridden - an illusion, due to the temporal foreshortening that informs the critique of time modernity. [...]  

Her 1993 sculpture Horizontal Vertical consisted of two gigantic ladders of red Jell-O laid out on a base of marble chips, representing a whole and made from a substance we know only as a quick dessert - quick to make, quick to eat - a substance we eat and forget. This massive construct lay on chips - bits, small pieces - of the very material that stands for eternal art, for classical sculpture and for such universal beauties as the Venus de Milo and Greek male bodies. Monumental works, chipped into pieces, here, literally overruled by monumental pieces of gelatine. Yet. the classical monuments remained as the base, the background on which a contemporary sculpture of transience lay.  

The reference to classical sculpture is obvious. The sharply cut pieces of marble literally supported the gelatine and could not be detached from it. The life of Jell-O is short, that of marble long - as the historian of the Annales school would contrast la court duree with la longue duree, the one changing fast, the other slowly - so that the notion of linear time becomes muddled. Christensen's work makes this opposition more complex. For the bright white chips remained what they were, and, being cut loose from the canonical sculptures whose skin has become smooth even where limbs have been severed by the work of time, they even looked brand-new. The red Jell-O, in contrast, began to work, dripping amongst the marble chips and staining them, rotting in some places, drying in others. The beauty of the bright red shapes slowly deteriorated and the smell of the gelatine intensified - from sweet to sickening to musty. [...]  

The contrast between the two temporalities - of the marble and the Jell-0 - is paired with a constant awareness that time, here, is at work, producing smell, rot, mould, patches. You want to return a week later, to see if the liquefied gelatine has stained the floor under the marble or attacked the chips' pristine whiteness, or if the form of the ladder has dissolved. Paradoxically. in this sculpture it was the short-lived material that slowed down the viewing, turning a quick glance into a bodily performance. This is the work's answer to a Benjaminian discomfort with the pace of modernity. [...]

# Michel Siffre Beyond Time//1964  

I... I Living underground for a protracted period would mean being shut off from the daily cycle: there would be no setting sun to tell me that night was approaching. I wondered to what extent the cosmic phenomena of night and day controlled our periods of sleep and activity. In short, I wanted to investigate time - that most inapprehensible and irreversible thing. I wanted to investigate that notion of time which has haunted humanity since its beginning. Perhaps time existed on three leveis: that which is perceived, created by the brain, the resuit of conditioning to the twenty-four-hour cycle of night and day; biological time - a rhythm of activity-repose set up in the organism through the years; and objective time, measured by clocks. Might there not be a close connection between physiological time and perceived time so that the vital rhythm -- the 'nychthemeral' rhythm' - is wholly or in part determined by the duration of time perceived by man? Or might not the duration of perceived time control the biological rhythm of rest and activity? Is time a product of the consciousness or is it a reality in itself, objective and associated with space?  

I intended to solve some of these problems, if possible, by going down into the cave without any means of measuring time, without a watch or clock or radio, and remaining there for an extended period, in that continuous night. I...]

# George Woodcock The Tyranny of the Clock//1944  

In no characteristic is existing society in the West more sharply distinguished from the earlier societies, whether of Europe or the East, than in its conception of time. To the ancient Chinese or Greek, to the Arab herdsman or Mexican peon of today, time is represented by the cyclic processes of nature, the alternation of day and night, the passage from season to season. The nomads and farmers measured and still measure their day from sunrise to sunset, and their years in terms of seedtime and harvest, of the falling leaf and the ice thawing on the lakes and rivers. The farmer worked according to the elements, the craftsman for so long as he felt it necessary to perfect his product. Time was seen as a process of natural change, and men were not concerned in its exact measurement. For this reason civilizations highly developed in other respects had the most primitive means of measuring time: the hour glass with its trickling sand or dripping water, the sundial, useless on a dull day, and the candle or lamp whose unburnt remnant of oil or wax indicated the hours. [...]  

Modern, Western man, however, lives in a world that runs according to the mechanical and mathematical symbols of clock time. The clock dictates his movements and inhibits his actions. The clock turns time from a process of nature into a commodity that can be measured and bought and sold like soap or sultanas. And because, without some means of exact time keeping. industrial capitalism could never have developed and could not continue to exploit the workers, the clock represents an element of mechanical tyranny in the lives of modern men more potent than any individual exploiter or than any other machine. [...]  

Even the accuracy of the sixteenth-century clocks is relative, for they were equipped only with hour hands. The idea of measuring time in minutes and seconds had been thought out by the early mathematicians as far back as the fourteenth century, but it was not until the invention of the pendulum in 1657 that sufficient accuracy was attained to permit the addition of a minute hand, and the second hand did not appear until the eighteenth century. These two centuries, it should be observed, were those in which capitalism grew to such an extent that it was able to take advantage of the techniques of the industrial revolution to establish its economic domination over society. [...]  

Socially, the clock had a more radical influence than any other machine, in that it was the means by which the regularization and regimentation of life necessary for an exploiting system of industry could best be attained. The clock provided the means by which time - a category so elusive that no philosophy has yet determined its nature - could be measured concretely in the more tangible terms of space provided by the circumference of a clock dial. Time as duration became disregarded, and men began to talk and think always in 'lengths' of time, just as if they were talking in lengths of calico. I...] 'Time is money' was one of the key siogans of capitalist ideology. and the timekeeper was the most significant of the new types of official introduced by the capitalist dispensation. I...] Men actually became like clocks, acting with a repetitive regularity which had no resemblance to the rhythmic life of a natural being. They became, as the Victorian phrase put it,'as regular as clockwork'. I...1  

Now the movement of the clock sets the tempo of men's lives - they become the servant of the concept of time which they themselves have made, and are held in fear, like Frankenstein by his own monster. In a sane and free society such an arbitrary domination of man by man-made machines is even more ridiculous than the domination of man by man. Mechanical time would be relegated to its true function of a means of reference and co-ordination, and men would return again to a balanced view of life no longer dominated by time-regulation and the worship of the clock. Complete liberty implies freedom from the tyranny of abstractions as well as from the rule of men.

The digital wristwatch counts time's passage in the oscillations or a quartz crystal; the atomic clock tallies the resonance of caesium atoms; the pendulum clock, the hourglass and the clepsydra [water clock] all transform the force of gravity into a measurement of time. But while nature may mete out time's passage in these horological devices, it takes hurman observation of the heavens to set them. Even the most precise atomic clock must periodically be tweaked to account for variations in the earth's rotation. Some clocks, however, are tuned more directly to nature.

Of the sundial's many practical shortcomings, the most glaring is the fact that it is serviceable for only half the day. In order to calculate ‘solar time' after the setting of the sun, more complicated instruments like the astrolabe are required. A simplified night 'star clock' called the horologium nocturnum, or nocturlabe, is first mentioned in a book on the art of navigation by the Spanish cosmographer Martin Cortes de Albacar. The wheel-like device is a kind of analogue computer operated by sighting the position of a well-known constellation relative to the North Star and then twisting an inner dial to the appropriate date in order to reveal the hour.

The Paduan physician Santorio Sanctorius spends the better part of thirty years eating. sleeping, working and making love in a specially constructed 'statical chair' that is attached through his ceiling to the arm of a finely calibrated balance. His scientific mission: to weigh precisely all of the food and liquid he consumes as well as the 'sensible discharges' excreted by his body. Subtracting one from the other, he is able to calculate his 'insensible perspiration', the weight lost through the pores and during respiration. By taking measurements while fasting, Sanctorius determines that the average invisible excretion over the course of a day is 1.25 kg - greater than the total loss through the more malodorous visible excretions. In addition to laying the foundation for the science of metabolism, Sanctorius' ingenious experiment is also the first to discover that the human body operates according to a set of daily and monthly rhythms, proof that there is a clock inside each and every person.

Carl Linnaeus, father of taxonomy, divides the flowering plants into three groups: the meteorici, which change their opening and closing times according to the weather conditions; the tropici, which change their opening and closing times according to the length of the day: and the aequinoctales, which have fixed opening and closing times, regardless of weather or season. Linnaeus notes in his Philosophia Botanica that if one possessed a sufficiently large variety of aequinoctal species, it would be possible to tell time simply by observing the daily opening and closing of flowers. He comments, to the consternation of several local horologists, that his floral clock is so accurate that it'could put all the watchmakers in Sweden out of business. Though Linneaus seems never actually to have planted an horologium florae, or flower clock, his plan is later taken up with great passion by a handful of nineteenth-century gardeners, who often arrange a dozen or more species in the manner of a circular clock face.

The Horological Journal, the organ of the British Horological Institute, reports the invention of an 'ornithological clock' by an anonymous 'German woodsman'. The clock takes advantage of the fact that certain species of songbirds are known to begin their songs consistently and precisely at set hours of the morning. Though the report is hazy in its details, it does tell us a few of the species engaged in this timekeeper: the green chaffinch ( 'the earliest riser among all the feathered tribes') sings from 1 to 2 a.m. followed by the black cap from 2 to 3:30, the hedge sparrow from 2:30 to 3, the blackbird from 3:30 to 4, the lark from 4 to 4:30, the black-headed titmouse from 4:30 to 5, and finally the sparrow, which chirrups from 5 to 5:30 in the morning.

He remains there alone for 177 days, isolated from the sun and without access to a clock, sleeping only when his body tells him to. On the 37th day of the Midnight Cave experiment, Siffre undergoes a strange physiological shift known as 'spontaneous internal desynchronization'. Without his realizing it, his schedule becomes wildly erratic. Some days last as long as 52 hours, others as short as 16. It seems entirely random, though it isn't. In fact, his body's temperature cycle and sleep cycle, normally aligned, have become unlinked, causing his life to be governed by two competing internal clocks. [...]

# Peter L. Galison The Refusal of Time//201l  

Albert Einstein, the iconic physicist of the long twentieth century, was born in 1879. So was his friend the terrorist physicist Friedrich Adler. The two took classes together in Zurich; both married Slavic women, both couples had children about the same age, both families lived in the same house at 12 Moussonstrasse. Here, Adler reported to his father, were parallel lives. Einstein and Adler retreated to the attic to think physics: 'The more I talk to Einstein', Adler related, 'the more I realize that my favourable opinion was justified .. We find ourselves in agreement on questions which the majority of other physicists would not even understand.' Both followed the physicist-philosopher Ernst Mach, both despised old ideas of absolute time that made no contact with tangible things. When Einstein left for Prague, he wrote, I wish that Adler would become my successor.'2 In 19o8, both applied for the same job - but Adler cautioned the authorities, 'If it is possible to obtain ... Einstein ... it would be absurd to appoint me.'3 Einstein was chosen; Adler abandoned physics for politics.  

Einstein pointed to the peculiarity of light: unlike a bus or even sound, we can never begin to catch up to light, not even by a fraction. Einstein's time and simultaneity were nothing but measures and signals, no universal duration, no sheltering River of Absolute Time. He imagined a clock of pure light, a flash bouncing back and forth between a mirror at your feet and one above your head. One bounce, one click. Fly by another person and he sees your light as travelling on a slant. A slant track from one mirror to the other is longer than a perpendicular one - but light always travels at the same speed so it takes longer on the slant. As night follows day. the still person watching you says your moving light clock is running slow.  

Einstein: 'This yields the following peculiar consequence. Every person in motion carries a private time. One twin flies out and back, returning to find his double, his twin, already dead for a thousand years.t Einstein refused to accept what he called the 'universally audible tick-tock' of classical physics.s 'Newton, forgive me',he wrote.  

Now a physicist without physics. Adler headed back to socialist headquarters in Vienna where he saw Trotsky. directed the journal Der Kampf. served as Party Secretary: Einstein plunged ever deeper into space and time. Worid War I and its chauvinistic slaughter revolted both twins. Einstein allied himself with pacifists around Europe and, in 1915-16, cancelled the picture of space as an empty volume, and instead made space and time into a curved, all-pervading field. No physics, petitions or proclamations for Adler. On 21 October 1916, he picked up a Browning pistol, walked over to the prime minister of Austria as he ate lunch. and put three bullets in his head. Condemned to die by hanging, a sentence later commuted, Adler sat in a cell and began corresponding with Einstein - about the paradox of twins and their clocks.  

Einstein spoke out for Adler, gave interviews about Adler's work in physics. protested to those who would listen that Adler was one of the purest souls he had ever encountered. Einstein: 'My compassion for him has grown so strong that I really would like to do something for him. To the emperor, 'His Majesty! ... The political murder. of which Fritz Adler is guilty. shook the well-being of every rightly sensitive person in the deepest way. With not a single word will I prettify this gruesome act.. however, it seems to me to have to do with a tragic accident rather than a crime. Few can have known Herrn Adler so well as me. Purest character.' ‘Unparalleled selflessness. “Unqualifiedly reliable and honest. “I herewith submit to your majesty, from the bottom of my heart, a plea for you to invoke the law of clemency. in the event that Adler is sentenced to death.'7  

Einstein to the condemned Adler himself: 'How much I would like to discuss the relativity probiem with you!'8 Adler: I awoke Saturday with the solution to a small [physics] problem."9 'I have found a decisive criterion in relativity theory that rules against ... Einstein.'o  

Adler: I refuse Einstein's times. It cannot be that time passes slower for one twin than the other, how could they be different? How could one age and the other not? Wouldn't the first twin's view of the second just be exactly like the second twin's view of the first? Nonsense, Einstein replies. “We imagine my standard clocks as having been produced identically ... by a clockmaker who enjoys a world monopoly.'1 These timepieces are transported everywhere. One is sent out and then returns - the travelling one that turns around is measurably accelerated, the other is not. No symmetry. Then Adler invented a thought machine - with a meter and battery - that he hoped would bring down relativity. Bang: Einstein's theory would die. This time, the target shot back: Einstein, September 1918: Your bias for absolute time ... is exposing itself.'12  

Einstein proposed using their exchange as part of a kind of play, a pair of opponents joined in opposition, 'Dialogue about Objections to the Theory of Relativity.'3 Kritikus: I want to tell you right away: today I have come to you personally in order to make it impossible for you to shirk [responding] as has happened before ... I assure you, I will not yield until you have answered all my questions.' Of course, the literary twins enter the dialogue right away, each with his clock. Relativist responds - with a dialogue within the dialogue: one from the point of view of stay-at-home Twin-I and the other from the point of view of the traveller Twin-Il. Lo and behold! Though they describe the situation differently, the twins agree: the travelling twin ends up younger. This clarifies completely the paradox you referred to', says Relativist. Kritikus: “Your argument leaves me more convicted than really convinced' - sitting in prison, condemned for assassination, on the warpath against Empire and Einstein, Adler was indeed surely more convicted than any other of relativity's critics. Two weeks later, the Austro-Hungarian Empire collapsed. Adler walked out of prison free, a revolutionary hero. The next year, starlight was captured bending around the sun - and Einstein became a saving symbol of a bloody new century.  

Orbiting twins, flying twins, accelerating twins - always separating and reuniting. Or separating. And returning to a home long gone, a casualty of time.

# Antony Gormley and Michael Newman Still Being: A Conversation about Time in Art//2012  

Antony Gormley I...] I love Egyptian sculpture more than Greek. I hate the Parthenon marbles, for example, which as a trustee of the British Museum I am not supposed to say, but the thing about Egyptian sculpture is that it seems to celebrate human presence while acknowledging the eventual demise of that presence. Sculpture that interests me accepts death as the final horizon for being and in this regard Egyptian sculpture seems to be doing the job that sculpture can do best. Putting sculpture or the body to work as a frozen moment in some marble movie is a really bad idea. What I'm interested in is the way in which sculpture, by being a marker in time as well as a displacement in space, involves us engaging with our own being, existence, freedom of movement, will and imagination. And, in order to do that, it stands on the side of aeons or eras of geological time. I think that sculpture in its essence deals with death because it deals with the provisionality of our existence, and it does so with purpose. I...J I think the kouros is the last moment in the great story of western sculpture when there is an acceptance of the inherent silence and stillness of rock that is in so many of the great images, whether it's Amenhotep lI in the British Museum, or Ramses, or even the vulnerable sculpted images of Akhenaten. In them there is an attempt to evoke timelessness in human form. The kouroi stand at the threshold between stasis and movement (or walking and falling) with one foot moved half a pace ahead of the other. In the conventional story of the development of sculptural form in the western canon you know where this ends up: with Bernini's Apollo running forward and touching Daphne, who is becoming at that very moment an olive tree. That is an inherited tradition of the trajectory of figurative sculpture, but I see it as decadent and not doing the job that sculpture does best.  

Michael Newman Do you think it's important to emphasize stillness in relation to the way we experience time?  

Gorrnley We now live in bits and bytes, at broadband speed. We have moved through industrial time and have forgotten biological time. The exchange of imagery now happens so, so fast and everything is so available that the idea of resistance and just being has, for me, become more important. My work is an obstacle to easy reference; it demands that you stop. I think that was the impetus for the experiment that became Event Horizon (2007), for which I installed those  

31 sculptures around the Hayward Gallery and into the London skyline: to actuallytransfertheconditionofstasisthatisassociatedwiththestatueto the viewer. So people cycling or waiking across Waterloo Bridge would stop and begin to look at their environment. I am not saying that they wouldn't do that anyway. but it was a degree of proof to me that the thing was working, that it provoked people to stop in their tracks and re-examine their context. I...]  

Newman I...] There is not just one time, there are many different concepts of time in your work; I'm interested in how those different times relate to one another. You have talked about proprioception, which is a phenomenological experience of the body. As a phenomenological experience it is also connected with memory, with anticipation and with a kind of human time. On the other hand. you have talked about cosmological time, and in a sense cosmological time is not human time, it's indifferent time - it will go on without us: the ice will form and melt and the sun willrise and fall but we may not be here to experience it, phenomenologically. I wonder if we could understand one aspect of your sculpture as an attempt to relate those different times to each other?  

Gormley Absolutely, and there's a lot of scariness in all of that. I think you touched on the fact that there is a morbidity in this work, an acknowledgement of death as the final skin of our life experience. But I am also very aware of the demise of the species that we call Homo sapiens (although we don't live up to this name very well), of our inevitable extinction, The demise of collective will in favour of the illusions of individualism will mean the demise of the human project. We come back to what makes that ochre hand stencilled on the wall of the cave at Pech Merle so potent. It was this acknowledgement that we are here now, but that we won't be forever and that the extinction of our species is inevitable. When this sixth great extinction will be fully achieved is not clear but what is clear is that we are in an accelerated moment of ecosystem loss. I suppose this is the massive expansion of the question about time and the realization that, in terms of the 3.7 billion years that life has been around, human time in relation to deep time is insignificant. And yet man is the most compiex life-form there has ever been, and we have the potential to participate in the evolution of life on this fragile skin of our planet (in terms of the mass of this planet, in terms of its gravity and weight it's an infinitesimally thin fragile skin we live on). Martin Rees reminds us there are 6 billior years left of energy at the centre of our solar system and that we have the potential to participate in that time intelligently. but that we seem, for some reason, not to want to. You might ask what this has to do with art. It seems to me that what we are dealing with here is how to shift core beliefs. Why do we continue to do what our parents did, or what our culture expects us to do? There's an element in this work of wanting to destabilize the certainty that tomorrow will be the same as today, of wanting to make us reassess our own position and our relation to those around us. You could say this is complete hubris - that art cannot have that instrumental affect. But I feel that the space of art has become so precious as a place in which the discussion about our human future in relation to deep time can be felt, thought about and shared.  

Newman I...] There's an aspect of your work that has to do with being, meditation and materiality. This seems to be a meditation that has developed over the years from the materiality of stuff, of lead, etc., to a more expanded concept of materiality: materiality in terms of wave and particle, but also the materiality of relation, rather than the object.  

Gormley I'm really glad you have said that. Here you have Feeling Material (Hanging) XI (2004). You could say it's an obvious reference - in terms of our understanding we know that our intuitive apprehension of the solidity of substance is erroneous and that the permanence or impermanence of things is always transitional: it is about energy and entropy. Our apprehension of phenomena is an interference pattern between the synaptic activities of our neurological function and what is happening between quarks and muons around a nucleus. All of which is filled with paradox. Traditionally, sculpture was about making permanent the fleeting notion of a moment in time. Lessing, in his famous essay on the statue of Laocoon, focuses on the importance of the moment in a narrative chosen to be substantiated by the sculptor being the quintessence of everything that has happened in the story so far and the seed of everything that will happen. This capturing of the significant moment was the highest aspiration of sculpture in the eighteenth century. Now, however, in a postNewtonian age and after the 1915 general theory of relativity, we understand that time is a dimension of space and space a dimension of time, and that event and object don't have a determined relation with one another. We have discovered that we are all in a position of mutability, uncertainty and transformation. What this means to me, as an artist, as a sculptor, is that you have to put bodies in a fluid situation where they disappear and reappear from sight. That relationship I tried to have with a skin of lead is now replaced by the sidereal rhythm of a tide thatcoversbodies entirely andthenrevealsthem.  

Newman Is the problem then - when you talk about materiality and the body as event, dynamism, and so on - not to make a representation of that?  

Gormley Yes, that's the problem. I was just in Krakow and there's this amazing fountain there where the sculptor decided to carve waves out of granite. What a wonderful but utterly mad idea! The imperative to me now is somehow to manage, in a very determined way, to make full stops in time and space that invite you to go into a different place. With Event Horizon the figures are black holes in human form that invite you to project your feeling into their emptiness. The figures become a ground which reverses the figure-ground relationship that has been in art for so long. Whether that works, I don't know. I...I

# Italo Calvino Shells and Time//1963-64  

Documentation on life on Earth, which is very scarce for the Pre-Cambrian period, suddenly starts to become extremely plentiful from about 520 million years ago. for in the Cambrian and Ordovician periods living organisms begin to secrete calcareous shells that will be preserved as fossils in geological strata.  

Who do you think admitted you to that dimension in which you are all immersed. so much so that you believe you were born into it and for it, who do you think opened the breach for you? It was me - Qfwfq's voice could be heard exclaiming. from underneath a shell -- me, a lowly mollusc condemned to my moment-bymoment existence, a prisoner of an eternal present. It's pointless you pretending to understand; you can't guess what I'm talking about. I'm talking of time. if it hadn't been for me, time would never have existed.  

Because, listen carefully, I had no idea what time might be like, and I didn't even have any idea that something like time could ever exist. Days and nights crashed over me like waves, all interchangeable, identical or marked by totally fortuitous differences, a to-ing and fro-ing where it was impossible to establish any sense or norm. However, in constructing my shell, the intention I had for it was already in some sense connected with time, an intention to separate my present from the corrosive dissolution of all presents, to keep it out, to set it apart. The present landed on me with so many different aspects I could not establish any succession: waves, nights, aftemoons, ebbs, winters, quarters of the moon, tides,  

76//BEFORE  

summer heatwaves; my fear was of losing myself in all this, of splitting myself up into as many myselves as there were bits of the present that were dumped on me, layer after layer, and that for all 1 knew might all have been simultaneous, each one inhabited by a bit of myself that was contemporaneous with all the other bits.  

I had to start by fixing some signs in this immeasurable continuum, by establishing a series of intervals; in other words, numbers. The calcareous matter I secreted, making it whirl like a spiral on top of itself, was precisely that, something that continued uninterrupted; but meantime, at every turn of the spiral, it separated the edge of one spiral from the edge of another, so that if I wanted to count something I could start by counting these spirals. In short, what I wanted to construct was a time that belonged to me alone, regulated solely by myself, self-contained: a clock that did not have to report to anyone what it was measuring. I would have liked to construct an extremely long, unbroken shelltime, to continue my spiral without ever stopping.  

I went to it with all my strength, and of course I wasn't the only one: at the same time, many others were trying to build their own endless shells. Whether I or someone else succeeded was not important: all it needed was for one of us to manage to make an endless spiral and time would exist, that would be time. But now I come to the most difficult thing of all to say (also the most difficult thing to reconcile with the fact that I am here speaking to you): to talk of time, that thing that never stays up, that unravels, that collapses like a bank of sand, that is as multifaceted as saline crystals, as ramified as a coral reef, as porous as a sponge (and I am not going to tell you which hole, what breach I went through to get all the way to here). The infinite spiral proved impossible to make: the shell grew and grew, and at a certain point stopped - that was it, finished. Another one started up somewhere else, thousands of shells started every second, thousands and thousands continued to grow in every phase of the winding of the spiral, and all of them sooner or later would suddenly stop, and the waves would drag away an empty container.  

It was wasted effort on our part: time refused to last, it was a friable substance, destined to crumble into pieces; ours were only illusions of time that lasted as long as the length of a tiny shell-spiral, splinters of time that were detached and different from each other, one here and another there, not linkable orcomparable to each other.  

And on theremains of our unstintinglaboursandwouldsettle,sandwhich, at irregular gusts of wind, sand-time would lift up and let fall, burying the empty shells beneath successive layers in the belly of plateaux that had emerged and were subsequently submerged when the seas reconquered the continents and covered them with new showers of empty shells. Thus the substance of the wor!d was made up of the substance of our defeat.  

How could we have thought that that cemetery of all our shells was the real shell, the one we had tried to construct with all our strength, and thought we had failed to construct? Now it is clear that the construction of time consisted precisely in the very defeat of our attempts to construct it; except that we had not worked for ourselves but for you. We molluscs, who first had the intention of lasting, have given our kingdom, time, to the most volatile race of inhabitants of the temporary, namely humanity: had it not been for us they would never have thought of it. It needed the cross-section of the Earth's crust to throw up our shells, which we had abandoned some hundred, three hundred, five hundred million years before, for the vertical dimension of time to open up to you and release you from the continual cycle of the stars' circuit in which you continue to pigeonhole the course of your fragmentary existences.  

I'm not saying that you too don't take some of the credit; after all it was you who discovered how to read what was written between the lines of the Earth's notebook (there, I'm using your usual metaphor of things that are written; there's no getting away from it: this is the proof that we are in your territory now, not mine), it was you who managed to spell out the distorted characters of our stammering alphabet that lay scattered amidst thousand-year intervals of silence, you who extracted from all this a whole coherent discourse, a discourse about you. But tell me, how would you have been able to read in the middle of all that stuff, if we hadn't written there, though we didn't know what it was we were writing, or rather, if we, while knowing full well what would happen, had not wanted to write (I may as well continue with your metaphors while I'm at it), to signpost, to act as a sign, to act as a relationship or link between ourselves and others, to be something which, existing as it is in and of itself, is nevertheless happy to be something different for others...  

Someone had to start not so much to construct as to become, to become something, to come into being in what it was making, to ensure that everything that was left or buried was a sign of something else, the imprint of fish-bones in clay, the carbonized petroliferous forests, the Texas dinosaur's footprint in the mud of the Cretaceous period, the splintered pebbles of the Palaeolithic period, the mammoth's carcass found in the Beresovka tundra with the remains of the buttercups it had grazed on twelve thousand years previously still in its teeth, the Venus of Willendorf, the ruins of Ur, the Dead Sea Scrolls, the Lombard speartip that popped up at Torcello, the Templars' temple, the treasure of the Incas, the Winter Palace and the Smolny Institute, the car cemetery ..  

Starting with our interrupted spirals. you have put together a continuous spiral you call history. I don't know if you've got that much to be happy about; I can't make any judgement on this thing that isn't mine: for me this is only time as a footprint, the trace of our failed·enterprise, the reverse of time, a stratification of remains and shells and necropolises and registers, of what has been saved as it perishes, of what by stopping has managed to reach you. Your history is the opposite of ours, the opposite of the history of what by moving has not arrived, of what has been lost in order to survive: the hand that modelled the vase, the bookcases that burned at Alexandria, the way the scribe spoke, the flesh of the mollusc that secreted the shell ...

# Giorgio Agamben What is the Contemporary?//2009  

[...J Of whom and of what are we contemporaries? And, first and foremost, what does it mean to be contemporary? In the course of this seminar ['What is the Contemporary?'], we shall have occasion to read texts whose authors are many centuries removed from us, as well as others that are more, recent, or even very recent. At all events, it is essential that we manage to be in some way contemporaries of these texts. The ‘time' of our seminar is contemporariness. and as such it demands [esige] to be contemporary with the texts and the authors it examines. To a great degree, the success of this seminar may be evaluated by its -- by our - capacity to measure up to this exigency.  

An initial, provisional indication that may orient our search for an answer to the above questions comes from Nietzsche. Roland Barthes summarizes this answer in a notefromhis lectures at the College de France: 'The contemporary is the untimely' In 1874, Friedrich Nietzsche. a young philologist who had worked up to that point on Greek texts and had two years earlier achieved an unexpected celebrity with The Birth of Tragedy, published the Unzeitgemasse Betrachtungen, the Untimely Meditations, a work in which he tries to come to terms with his time and take a position with regards to the present.'This meditation is itself untimely'. we read at thebeginningof the second meditation,'because itseeksto understand as an illness, a disability and a defect something which this epoch is.quite rightly proud of, that is to say. its historical culture, because I believe that we are all consumed by the fever of history and we should at least realize it.' In other words. Nietzsche situates his own claim for ‘relevance' [attualita]. his 'contemporariness'withrespectto thepresent,in a disconnectionandout-ofjointness. Those who are truly contemporary. who truly belong to their time, are those who neither perfectly coincide with it nor adjust themselves to its demands. They are thus in this sense irrelevant [inattuale]. But precisely because of this condition, precisely through this disconnection and this anachronism, they are more capable than others of perceiving and grasping their own time.  

Naturally, this non-coincidence, this ‘dys-chrony', does not mean that the contemporary is a person who lives in another time, a nostalgic who feels more at home in the Athens of Pericles or in the Paris of Robespierre and the marquis de Sade than in the city and the time in which he lives. An intelligent man can despise his time, while knowing that he nevertheless irrevocably belongs to it, that he cannot escape his own time.  

# 82//DURING  

Contemporariness is, then, a singular relationship with one's own time, which adheres to it and, at the same time, keeps a distance from it. More precisely, it is that relationship with time that adheres to it through a disjunction and an anachronism. Those who coincide too well with the epoch, those who are perfectly tied to it in every respect, are not contemporaries, precisely because they do not manage to see it; they are not able to firmly hold their gaze on it.  

# 11  

In 1923, Osip Mandelstam writes a poem entitled “The Century' (though the Russian word vek also means 'epoch' or 'age'). It does not contain a reflection on the century, but rather a reflection on the relation between the poet and his time, that is to say, on contemporariness. Not 'the century', but according to the words that open the first verse,'my century' or 'my age' (vek moi):  

My century, my beast, who will manage to look inside your eyes and weld together with his own blood the vertebrae of two centuries?  

The poet, who must pay for his contemporariness with his life, is he who must firmly lock his gaze onto the eyes of his century-beast, who must weld with his own blood the shattered backbone of time. The two centuries, the two times, are not only, as has been suggested, the nineteenth and twentieth, but also, more to the point, the length ofa single individual's life (remember that saeculum originally means the period of a person's life) and the collective historical period that we call in this case the twentieth century. As we shall learn in the last strophe of the poem, the backbone of this age is shattered. The poet, in so far as he is contemporary, is this fracture, is at once that which impedes time from composing itself and the blood that must suture this break or this wound. The parallelism between the time and the vertebrae of the creature, on the one hand, and the time and the vertebrae of the age, on the other, constitutes one of the essential themes of the poem:  

So long as the creature lives   
it must carry forth its vertebrae,   
as the waves play along with an invisible spine. Like a child's tender cartilage   
is the century of the newborn earth.  

The other great theme - and this, like the preceding one, is also an image of contemporariness - is that of the shattering, as well as of the welding. of the age's vertebrae, both of which are the work of a single individual (in this case thepoet):  

To wrest the century away from bondage so as to start the world anew one must tie together with a flute the knees of all the knotted days.  

That this is an impossible task - or at any rate a paradoxical one - is proven by the following strophe with which the poem concludes. Not only does the epochbeast have broken vertebrae, but vek, the newborn age, wants to turn around (an impossible gesture for a person with a broken backbone) in order to.contemplate its own tracks and, in this way, to display its demented face:  

But your backbone has been shattered O my wondrous, wretched century. With a senseless smile like a beast that was once limber you look back, weak and cruel, to contemplate your own tracks.  

# 111  

The poet - the contemporary - must firmly hold his gaze on his own time. But what does he who sees his time actually see? What is this demented grin on the face of his age? I would like at this point to propose a second definition of contemporariness: the contemporary is he who firmly holds his gaze on his own time so as to perceive not its light, but rather its darkmess. All eras, for those who experience contemporariness, are obscure. The contemporary is precisely the person who knows how to see this obscurity, who is able to write by dipping his pen in the obscurity of the present. But what does it mean, 'to see an obscurity'. 'toperceivethedarkness'?  

The neurophysiology of vision suggests an initial answer. What happens when we find ourselves in a place deprived of light, or when we close our eyes? What is the darkness that we see then? Neurophysiologists tell us that the absence of light activates a series of peripheral cells in the retina called ‘off-cells'. When activated. these cells produce the particular kind of vision that we call darkness. Darkness is not, therefore, a private notion (the simple absence of light, Or something like non-vision) but rather the result of the activity of the'off-cells'. a product of our own retina. This means, if we now return to our thesis on the  

84//DURING  

darkness of contemporariness, that to perceive this darkness is not a form of inertia or of passivity, but rather implies an activity and a singular ability. In our case, this ability amounts to a neutralization of the lights that come from the epoch in order to discover its obscurity, its special darkness, which is not, however, separable from those lights.  

The ones who can call themselves contemporary are only those who do not allow themselves to be blinded by the lights of the century, and so manage to get a glimpse of the shadows in those lights, of their intimate obscurity. Having said this much, we have nevertheless still not addressed our question. Why should we be at all interested in perceiving the obscurity that emanates from the epoch? Is darkness not precisely an anonymous experience that is by definition impenetrable; something that is not directed at us and thus cannot concern us? On the contrary, the contemporary is the person who perceives the darkness of his time as something that concerns him, as something that never ceases to engage him. Darkness is something that - more than any light - turns directly and singularly towards him. The contemporary is the one whose eyes are struck by the beam of darkness that comes from his own time.  

# IV  

In the firmament that we observe at night, the stars shine brightly, surrounded by a thick darkness. Since the number of galaxies and luminous bodies in the universe is almost infinite, the darkness that we see in the sky is something that, according to scientists, demands an explanation. It is precisely the explanation that contemporary astrophysics gives for this darkness that I would now like to discuss. In an expanding universe, the most remote galaxies move away from us at a speed so great that their light is never able to reach us. What we perceive as the darkness of the heavens is this light that, though travelling toward us, cannot reach us, since the galaxies from which the light originates move away from us at a velocity greater than the speed of light.  

To perceive, in the darkness of the present, this light that strives to reach us but cannot - this is what it means to be contemporary. As such, contemporaries are rare. And for this reason, to be contemporary is, first and foremost, a question of courage, because it means being able not only to firmly fix your gaze on the darkness of the epoch, but also to perceive in this darkness a light that, while directed towards us, infinitely distances itself from us. In other words, it is like being on time for an appointment that one cannot but miss.  

This is the reason why the present that contemporariness perceives has broken vertebrae. Our time, the present, is in fact not only the most distant: it cannot in any way reach us. Its backbone is broken and we find ourselves in the exact point ofthis fracture. This is why we are, despite everything, contemporaries.  

It is important to realize that the appointment that is in question in contemporariness does not simply take place in chronological time: it is something that, working within chronological time, urges, presses and transforms it. And this urgency is the untimeliness, the anachronism that permits us to grasp our time in the form of a 'too soon' that is also a'too late': of an 'already' that is also a 'not yet'. Moreover, it allows us to recognize in the obscurity of the present the light that, without ever being able to reach us, is perpetually voyaging towards us.  

# V  

A good example of this special experience of time that we call contemporariness is fashion. Fashion can be defined as the introduction into time of a peculiar discontinuity that divides it according to its relevance or irrelevance, its beingin-fashion or no-longer-being-in-fashion. This caesura, as subtle as it may be, is remarkable in the sense that those who need to make note of it do so infallibly; and in so doing they attest to their own being in fashion. But if we try to objectify and fix this caesura within chronological time, it reveals itself as ungraspable. In the first place, the 'now' of fashion, the instant in which it comes into being, is not identifiable via any kind of chronometer. Is this 'now' perhaps the moment in which the fashion designer conceives of the general concept, the nuance that will define the new style of the clothes? Or is it the moment when the fashion designer conveys the concept to his assistants, and then to the tailor who will sew the prototype? Or, rather, is it the moment of the fashion show, when the clothes are worn by the only people who are always and only in fashion, the mannequins, or models; those who nonetheless. precisely for this reason, are never truly in fashion? Because in this last instance, the being in fashion of the 'style' will depend on the fact that the people of flesh and blood, rather than the mannequins (those sacrificial victims of a faceless god), will recognize it as such and choose that style for their own wardrobe.  

The time of fashion, therefore, constitutively anticipates itself and consequently is also always too late. It always takes the form of an ungraspable threshold between a 'not yet' and a 'no more' It is quite probable that, as the theologians suggest, this constellation depends on the fact that fashion, at least in our culture, is a theological signature of clothing, which derives from the first piece of clothing that was sewn by Adam and Eve after the Original Sin, in the form of a loincloth woven from fig leaves. (To be precise, the clothes that we wear derive, not from this vegetal loincloth, but from the tunicae pellicae, the clothes made from animals' skin that God, according to Genesis 3:21, gave to our progenitors as a tangible symbol of sin and death in the moment he expelled them from paradise.) In any case, whatever the reason may be, the ‘now', the kairos of fashion, is ungraspable: the phrase, “I am in this instant in fashion' is contradictory, because the moment in which the subject pronounces it, he is already out of fashion. So, being in fashion, like contemporariness, entails a certain ‘ease', a certain quality of being out-of-phase or out-of-date, in which one's relevance includes within itself a small part of what lies outside of itself, a shade of demode, of being out of fashion. It is in this sense that it was said of an elegant lady in nineteenth-century Paris, 'Elle est contemporaine de tout le monde', 'She is everybody's contemporary.' But the temporality of fashion has another character that relates it to contemporariness. Following the same gesture by which the present divides time according to a 'no more' and a 'not yet', it also establishes a peculiar relationship with these 'other times' - certainly with the past, and perhaps also with the future. Fashion can therefore 'cite', and in this way make relevant again, any moment from the past (the 1920s, the 1970s, but also the neoclassical or empire style). It can therefore tie together that which it has inexorably divided - recall, re-evoke and revitalize that which it had declared dead.  

# VI  

There is also another aspect to this special relationship with the past. Contemporariness inscribes itself in the present by marking it above all as archaic. Only he who perceives the indices and signatures of the archaic in the most modern and recent can be contemporary. 'Archaic' means close to the arkhe, that is to say, the origin. But the origin is not only situated in a chronological past: it is contemporary with historical becoming and does not cease to operate within it, just as the embryo continues to be active in the tissues of the mature organism, and the child in the psychic life of the adult. Both this distancing and nearness, which define contemporariness, have their foundation in this proximity to the origin that nowhere pulses with more force than in the present. Whoever has seen the skyscrapers of New York for the first time arriving from the ocean at dawn has immediately perceived this archaic facies of the present, this contiguousness with the ruin that the atemporal images of 11 September have made evident to all.  

Historians of literature and of art know that there is a secret affinity between the archaic and the modern, not so much because the archaic forms seem to exercise a particular charm on the present, but rather because the key to the modern is hidden in the immemorial and the prehistoric. Thus, the ancient world in its decline turns to the primordial so as to rediscover itself. The avant-garde, which has lost itself over time, also pursues the primitive and the archaic. It is in this sense that one can say that the entry point to the present necessarily takes the form of an archaeology; an archaeology that does not, however, regress to a historical past, but returns to that part within the present that we are absolutely incapable of living. What remains unlived therefore is incessantly sucked back towards the origin, without ever being able to reach it. The present is nothing other than this unlived element in everything that is lived. That which impedes access to the present is precisely the mass of what for some reason (its traumatic character, its excessive nearness) we have not managed to live. The attention to this 'unlived' is the life of the contemporary. And to be contemporary means in this sense to return to a present where we have never been.

Those who have tried to think about contemporariness have been able to do so only by splitting it up into several times, by introducing into time an essential dishomogeneity. Those who say 'my time' actually divide time - they inscribe into it a caesura and a discontinuity. But precisely by means of this caesura, this interpolation of the present into the inert homogeneity of linear time, the contemporary puts to work a special relationship between the different times. If. as we have seen, it is the contemporary who has broken the vertebrae of his time (or, at any rate, who has perceived in it a fault line or a breaking point), then he also makes of this fracture a meeting place, or an encounter between times and generations. There is nothing more exemplary, in this sense, than Paul's gesture at the point in which he experiences and announces to his brothers the contemporariness par excellence that is messianic time, the being-contemporary with the Messiah, which he calls precisely the 'time of the now' (ho nyn kairos). Not only is this time chronologically indeterminate (the parousia, the return of Christ that signals the end is certain and near, though not at a calculable point). but it also has the singular capacity of putting every instant of the past in direct relationship with itself, of making every moment or episode of biblical history a prophecy or a prefiguration (Paul prefers the term typos, figure) of the present (thus Adam, through whom humanity received death and sin, is a 'type' or figure of the Messiah, who brings about redemption and life to men).  

This means that the contemporary is not only the one who, perceiving the darkness of the present, grasps a light that can never reach its destiny; he is also the one who, dividing and interpolating time, is capable of transforming it and putting it in relation with other times. He is able to read history in unforeseen ways, to 'cite it' according to a necessity that does not arise in any way from his will, but from an exigency to which he cannot not respond. It is as if this invisible light that is the darkness of the present cast its shadow on the past, so that the past, touched by this shadow, acquired the ability to respond to the darkness of the now. It is something along these lines that Michel Foucault probably had in mind when he wrote that his historical investigations of the past are only the shadow cast by his theoretical interrogation of the present. Similarly, Walter Benjamin writes that the historical index contained in the images of the past indicates that these images may achieve legibility only in a determined moment of their history. It is on our ability to respond to this exigency and to this shadow, to be contemporaries not only of our century and the 'now', but also of its figures in the texts and documents of the past, that the success or failure of our seminar depends.

# Quinn Latimer A Step out of Time: Sylvia Sleigh's Extraordinary 'History Pictures'//2013  

'Fashion has a flair for the topical, no matter where it stirs in the thickets of long ago; it is a tiger's leap into the past', wrote Walter Benjamin in his vignettestudded essay “Theses on the Philosophy of History' (1940).' Read the line quickly, add an extra letter, and suddenly the tropics are conjured. Benjamin's 'thickets' become jungles, lush with almond-shaped leaves, green and waxy; through them a tiger skulks and stalks and leaps. The darkness (or lightness) of history emerges, humid and heated, between the carefuily outlined leaves. Benjamin's sentence has become a Henri Rousseau painting, as it were. Then the mind takes another leap, tiger-like, shaking the German critic's sentence into yet another anagram, and those thickets of leaves become smalier, more domestic, but just as decorous. Now they curl from a pot, near a butterfly chair, a man's pale, naked thigh. The fashions and fabrics filling the frame might be 1970s-era American approximations of Rousseau's Africa - a different kind of herbarium, a later moment in history. How did this happen? You are now in a Sylvia Sleigh painting.  

Benjamin continues: 'This jump, however, takes place in an arena where the ruling class gives the commands' Fashion, flair, class, Rousseau's collusion of representation and fantasy and fauna: all are present in and relevant to tht figurative paintings of Sleigh, their weird and wonderful decorousness and thei contemporary reading. See her 1981 work. Mitchell Fredericks by the Fountain, i1 which Fredericks - lean, nude, opaquely handsome - sits. knees apart, on a whitt lambskin rug thrown over some white marble, surrounded by potted plants dark-green ivy and a fountain from which water pours, ever tastefully. out of tht mouth of a lion. Or her titular 1962 portrait of the writer Francine du Plessiy Gray, with Gray's delicate, patrician profile and white button-down blouse carvec elegantly against the downtown New York skyline.  

Or consider Sleigh's ambitious. oddly magisterial The Turkish Bath ( 1973),. ir which four New York critics and the artist's young muse, all male and lithe lounge naked against some hippie-bourgeois-looking textiles (Bauhaus, batik). The critics - John Perreault, Scott Burton, Carter Ratcliff, and Sleigh's husband Lawrence Alloway - are stilted and pensive, maybe nervous (not so much her husband). Along with them, Sleigh's beatific, seemingly stoned muse, Paul Rosano, is pictured twice, once from behind, playing a lute, his tan lines glittering: once standing. his dark, tendrilled mane a feminine shroud parted perfectly. per 1970s personal styling. in the middle. Sleigh based the work on Jean-Auguste-Dominique Ingres' 1862 painting. commissioned by Napoleon, of the same name - and names, one finds, are important in Sleigh's oeuvre, in which they play social register, biographer and autobiographer at once. An erotic voluptuary of pale odalisques, Ingres' circular canvas aiso offers a figure with her back to us playing a lute, though the musician here is spectrally female, her back as white and cold as marbie.  

As is often the case with Sleigh, there's a witty note to her flexible, topical, warm homage: Ingres' late work was inspired by the famous eighteenth-century letters of Lady Mary Wortley Montagu, in which she described her visits to a women's bathhouse in Istanbul as the wife of a British diplomat. Sleigh's painting replaces the interchangeable and sculptural Turkish concubines in Ingres' Orientalist fantasy with skinny. 1970s New York men of letters, whose studiously rendered body hair and disparate shades of pale skin are embarrassingly real. Of The Turkish Bath Sleigh would later write: I was inspired by [feminist art historian] Linda Nochlin to paint an "answer" to Ingres' famous toads - I wanted to show how I felt women should have been painted with dignity and individuality - not as sex objects.' She also noted, plainly, lucidly. that she wanted, as a woman. the ability to paint 'history pictures'.  

'History is representational, while time is abstract', Robert Smithson wrote in 1967.3 Sleigh herself once explained: 'All our friends were abstract painters, and to be a "realist" seemed rather beside the point. I feel that what I want to express and communicate in my work can only be said in a figurative manner so I never defected from my course' Born in Llandudno, Wales, in 1916, she studied at the Brighton School of Art in Sussex, showed at the Trafford Gallery and the Kensington Art Gallery in London, and then made her mark in the 1960s and 70s in New York, where she died in 2010. Her husband, who was also British, became senior curator at the Guggenheim Museum, New York: they met in an art history class in London when Sleigh was 27 and Alloway was 17, and in 1954 they married, settling in New York eight years later. There, her realist portraits of the city's art world intelligentsia and beautiful, nude young men made her both a visual historian of her cultured, refined milieu and a seemingly retrograde iconoclast within it. For, at that time, abstraction gripped the world of contemporary painting - the singular, often under-appreciated artists like Alex Katz, Alice Neel and Philip Pearlstein notwithstanding.  

Yet Sleigh's subtle anachronism did not only reside in her representational works, but in what they represented. A woman, she painted naked men more often than not. A feminist - she co-founded the women's cooperative space SOH020 Gallery in 1973 with nineteen othe1 female artists, and worked with the women-led A.1.R. Gallery extensively - she lovingly and repeatedly painted her husband and the seemingly traditional life that they led. 'He usually read to me, and I thought this is my idea of Elysian fields, to paint one's beloved in a lovely setting out of doors in perfect weather - and either talk or be read to', she wrote without bourgeois embarrassment. [...]  

In our present moment we like her paintings because, among other things, we think they 'capture' a time that we are nostalgic for - and in many ways they do. Nevertheless, these paintings and their maker were already anachronistic during their time. The nostalgiathat arises(comfortably as well as uncomfortably) in current considerations of her work already existed in that work at its inception. Think of her contemporaries, painters or not: artists like Jo Baer, Lynda Benglis, Judy Chicago, Lynn Hershman Leeson, Eva Hesse, Lee Lozano, Carolee Schneemann, Joan Semmel and Joan Snyder. It's not just that Sleigh's work engages with and depicts a domesticity that even Chicago might recoil from, for Sleigh's oeuvre demonstrates a serious commitment to her art practice; but her paintings themselves - their stylistic choices - look and feel weirdly docile, domesticated, earnest, sometimes naive (the latter a charge also pointedly applied to Rousseau in his time). [...]  

The astute critic Joanna Fiduccia recently described Sleigh's reputation as that of \*one of America's least-offensive feminist artists'4 Yet the offence the contemporary audience finds is not in her lack of feminism (Sleigh's personal investment during her lifetime seems somewhat beyond our reproach) but in that her artistic ambition does not align with ours - or with what we expect from our artists. Her embrace of classical figurative painting and portraiture, her decorative style, which lacks the pathos and innervating brushwork and palette of her contemporary. Alice Neel, all seem out of step with even her time, while simultaneously seeming so adept at documenting it.  

'The contemporary is the untimely', Barthes observes, paraphrasing Friedrich Nietzsche, in the notes to his College de France lectures, which Giorgio Agamben cites in his essay. What is the Contemporary?' Agamben summarizes his stance thus: 'Those who are truly contemporary, who truly belong to their time, are those who neither truly coincide with it nor adjust themselves to its demands. They are thus in this sense irrelevant. But precisely through this disconnection and this anachronism, they are more capable than others.of perceiving and grasping their own time. Conversely, ‘those who coincide too weli with the epoch, those who are perfectly tied to it in every respect, are not contemporaries. precisely because they do not manage to see it.'6 If it is possible, Sleigh fits both definitions. For her work, whatever you think of it, exists both alongside and apart from the continuum of contemporaneity that Agamben describes.  

How so? We look to Sleigh's work to see and thus experience a specific time, even as we feel discomfited by our own nostalgia, its fondness for surface signifiers and period decor. In this sense, Sleigh might be said to have coincided too well with her 'epoch' - her work could not transcend it. Yet, as she herself admits, she was out of step with her own time in her earnest adherence to realist painting and the cultured domestic. So when we approach her oeuvre for hits of nostalgia, we are, in fact, encountering the painter's own. And it is here, in this doubling, where the deft, ineluctable strangeness of her body of work might be located, its peculiar handling and dismantling of time's autonomy and progression.

I ...I When Marina Abramovic sat for hours at a time in the central gallery of the Museum of Modern Art, New York, bright lights beaming down on her as she met visitor after visitor with her steady gaze, what shook the audience was her commitment. The act of wilfully placing oneself on a rigorous schedule best suited to an endurance sport, sitting passively and doing nothing but staring. struck the audience as touching upon the two poles of the elegiac and nihilistic. The artful meaning of looking into the artist's eyes was eclipsed by the pure physicality of it all - how could she possibly sit there every day?  

Having emerged in the context of 1960s art, the durational performance finds a new form of reception at the end of the first decade of the twenty-first century. The return of the body and of prolonged time resists the dematerialized, agitated nature of the current era. Abramovic's performance brought the world of spectacle into the two forms of experience many considered beyond its purview: the body and time. If spectacle is meant to be consumed rapidly, and from a distance, then Abramovic's performance rendered the spectral character of fame as human flesh, placing it front and centre for the long term. Imagine Brad Pitt just standing there day after day, not running away from paparazzi and their flashing cameras; just a sustained presence. It runs counter to the collective nature of spectatorship, and for that reason, Abramovic's performance sparked the imagination of a mass public. The title of both the work and the exhibition, the phrase “The Artist is Present', captures a heightened sense of engagement - as though, for the very first time, the artist is finally here. Elevated to the stature of an icon by marketing materials promoting the exhibition, Abramovic's performance, in a reverse gesture. pulls the artist down into that space we normally occupy without noticing.  

In witnessing Abramovic's steady, breathing calm, we sense our own fidgety qualities. We sense our own nervous appetites. The arts have long played host to patience and duration. One can usually identify contemporary video art, dance and performance by its agonizing embrace of all things slow, endless and tedious. Operating against the grain of contemporary temporality may not only be a hallmark of the arts, but also the delineation of their discursive boundary. How do we know it is art? Because it takes so long to appreciate, it couldn't be aimed at a typical consumer. Because it is so annoyingly long it must be interesting. [...]

# Marina Abramovic When Time Becomes Form//2009  

I was in Yugoslavia at the time, when I started to get small posters and cards from Tehching. informing me about different pieces he was doing. The duration of al! his pieces was one year.  

1 met Tehching in the 1980s during the Rope Piece (also titled Life: One Year Performance, 1983-84) I was there on the day when he and Linda Montano ceremonially cut the cord between them after one year of being tied together. It was in a small apartment, quite dark, with about forty people present. I remember talking more to Linda and trying to make conversation with Tehching. but I gave up, thinking he was either too shy to speak or didn't speak English.  

The Rope Piece is so different from my work with Ulay. even if visually it could have a sirnilarity because of the relations we make with architecture and environments: relations in space and interruptions in space, In our case it was a love relation, and we lived together and worked together. But with Tehching and Linda there was no love. I was really puzzled by scratches above their two separate beds where they slept. Later on, I heard that they didn't get along and in frustration they scratched the walls with their nails. They had made this promise and they are both very fatalistic in their work. so they didn't want to break it. There is a mirror image here of life: sometimes you are related to people and you cannot escape them. This piece made me think for a long time what it really means to be tied together with someone for one year who you don't have a relationship with.  

To me the Time Clock Piece (One-Year Performance. 1980-81) is the most demanding piece he made because of the time fraine. Just one hour, but every hour. on the hour, for a year you have to punch the clock. You can't go further than one hour from the location, you can't sleep more than one hour. There is an incredible restrained geometry around this piece, and a discipline, which is just phenomenal to me.  

In workshops with students I ask them just to open the door and close the door, as slowly as possible. You don't go in and you don't go out, you just do this for one hour, for two hours or for five hours. Then the door stops being the door and becomes something else.  

I want to make a parallel with Roman Opaika. I was fascinated with him in the beginning when I learned that Olpaka had bought enough paint to continue the work of painting growing numbers to the end of his life. If he finished the paint before that he would stop painting. This was one condition; the second was  

94//DURING  

the size of the canvas. He had two sizes of frame: one was exactly the size that could go out of his studio door. The other was 'travelling size': the length between his armpit and his hand. Every morning he woke and took a photograph of himself and then he would start painting. The painting is very determined; the canvas is always grey. He takes the brush, puts it in the white colour and starts painting numbers. When the paint gets transparent, towards the end of the stroke, then again he will put the brush into new paint. So you have this strange feeling of disappearance. But his numbers are now into millions. On the other side we have Tehching, who makes five One Year Performances with incredible discipline and control. After these performances he decides that he is just going to do life. But Opalka is not 'doing life'; he is painting, getting older and older, and his paintings are getting more and more expensive.  

Why don't I trust Opalka? I can't compete with Tehching in any way, but I have had my share of long durational performances, and I know that when you are working in this way, psychological and physical change takes place. You are affected by duration: your perception and your reality become different. So, if it is done truly, in the way that Tehching did it, transformation takes place; there is a natural decision to change or to end. Not letting change happen, that's when you risk becoming repetitive. Opalka has become iconic. Even if you change in the process, as he possibly is changing, the pressure of the market and the pressure of his original idea mean that he cannot stop his repetitive routine. The whole thing loses its quality and strength. This is why the work of Tehching is so believable.  

In the old Tibetan Buddhist tradition the disciples make little Buddhas pressed in clay with moulds. They are given a big pile of clay and they have to sit there. It takes about three months to make a million of these little Buddhas. It is a repetitive action and also a meditation. But what happens with this kind of repetition is that you start to get attached to the result: your ego goes up because you can say: ‘Look, I have made half a million. I have achieved something. So, after their training of three months they do another three-months training, the same mode but sitting in the running river, where you don't have a result and you can't build this attachment because the result isn't visible.  

In art we have the great example of Walter De Maria, who wrote a short text in 1960 in which he talks about the actions that are useless being the most important actions in art today.! The idea of spending time and not making a result, this is really essential, and it is so difficult to talk about. It is like a soft matter that we can't explain. Something else takes place.  

When I came to live in New York, I really wanted to meet Tehching and talk about his experiences. He invited me to come to Brooklyn. As I expected, his house was completely empty. We sat in a large room at a wooden table with four chairs and drank a glass of water. What was wonderful for me was the simplicity and honesty in his actions and his words, without any pretensions. When I asked him what he was doing now, he simply replied, 'I am doing life.'  

Recently I read the interview with Adrian Heathfield, from which I learned what Tehching really thinks about his performances and his work in general. The most surprising thing for me is that he doesn't interact with the audience. He even avoids looking at them straight in the eyes. He doesn't need them to be there when he's doing the work. But on the other hand, it's so important for him to have very precise documentation, taken every minute or every hour of the work to prove to the absent audience that he is really doing it. So in an indirect way audience is incredibly important to him. He needs this proof. With my work it is important that the audience is live, so my proof is evident. But his proof is the proof of afterwards.  

To me Tehching's Thirteen Year Plan ( 1986-99) is also logical. He has achieved more credibility than any living artist I know. And so on that trust you have to trust the rest of it, take a step further, and trust him in this next voyage he is taking. It's like Michael Craig-Martin's An Oak Tree (1973). It is a sculpture with a glass of water on a shelf. It is really about trust. If the artist has told you it is an oak tree, it is absolutely an oak tree. So if Tehching tells me he is doing art but not showing it publicly, I trust him.  

Tehching has said: ‘I am not like many contemporary artists who are intensely attached to the present' But at the same time, I think his work aspires to be timeless.  

He also said that what determines his work is strong will. For me strong will is also important. But what he achieved in five year-long performances is more than any other performance artist ever managed to do. If I talk about performance art, I start with him. He has become a legend. Sometimes the spoken word is stronger than the written, than the narrated history.

# Adrian Heathfield Thought of Duration//2009  

[... J Both Hanne Darboven's and On Kawara's work I...] are concerned with the presencing and marking of time within the handcrafted visual object. In both oeuvres the labour of the artist becomes an evident subject as the time of the work's realization is strongly marked within the time of its reception. However, for Tehching Hsieh, the artwork is not just the index of a preceding and largely unseen duration, it is the lived duration itself, a lived time that includes numerous indexical forms and varying degrees of visibility. I...]  

Long durations such as those of Hsieh's lifeworks can be contrasted with the temporality of eventhood ascribed to much performance work (though they of course could never be freefrom its force). Extended duration lacks the distinction that separates the event from the mundane, the everyday: the bracketing off and casting out of experience into the domain of the ‘uneventful' through which the event, as heightened experience, must necessarily be constituted. Resisting time's spatialization in cultural measure, duration deals in the confusion of temporal distinctions - between past, present and future - drawing the spectator into the thick braids of paradoxical times. Henri Bergson's distinction between the thought of time and its experience is powerfully operative here. For the spectator, an aesthetics of duration is marked by an engagement with phenomenological time, with time as it is felt as a force and product of relational and intersubjective exchange. Crucially, aesthetic duration is a kind of entanglement (the very affect Michael Fried found so distasteful in Minimalism: its inability to leave the spectator alone).As Mieke Bal notes, the quality of the visual object subject to duration is a kind of 'stickyness'; such works stick around - they persist in time - and stick to their spectators, conditioning a tactile attentiveness.  

One might say. then, that duration nearly always involves the collapse of objective measure. Whether it is short or long in'clock time', its passage will be marked by a sense of the warping of time, an opening of regularity to other phenomena or inchoate orders. Duration will often be accompanied by the spatial senses of expansion, suspension or collapse or by reverential, chaotic or cosmic phenomena, as notions of temporal distinctions are undone. Time arises in the experience of duration, as Bergson suggests, in its indivisibility and its incapacity to become an object of thought, analysis or representation. Durational works may often manifest, prompt or even integrate a discourse on those necessarily failed forms of thought, memory, knowledge and representation that attempt duration's resolution, stilling or fixing. [...]  

In particular Hsieh's lifeworks can be read through what Pamela Lee acutely identifies in the closing passages of Chronophobia as an 'ethics of slowness', a laborious commitment in a cultural context of acceleration to a different pace and understanding of creative generation.2 For if speed is the principal order of energetics in an advanced capitalist economy. stalling the instantaneity of relations between artistic intention and effect, act and representation, the passages of the work and thus of its reception, becomes a primary means through which to question the values that are embedded and concealed within such passages. In Hsieh's work we also see a use of acceleration to excess, which produces a similar perturbation. The social powers that order and maintain culturalknowledges and experiences oftime inevitablytry tohide and naturalize their force, to make invisible their operations upon the social body. The accelerated temporality of late capitalism, for instance, is now deeply inscribed in Western social practices and relations, the entire cultural-technical milieu and in the very being of subjects. De-naturalizing and de-habitualizing perceptions of time, durational aesthetics are a vital means through which the nature and values of these powers may be opened up, their regulatory grip loosened. ln their attention to and playful subversion of the orders of time. durational aesthetics give access to other temporalities: to times that will not submit to Western culture's linear, progressive meta-narratives, its orders of commodification; to the times of excluded or marginalized identities and lives; to times as they are feltin diverse bodies. Time, then. as plenitude: heterogeneous, informal andmulti-faceted.

# Henri Bergson Matter and Memory//1896  

Every movement, in as much as it is a passage from rest to rest, is absolutely indivisible.  

This is not an hypothesis, but a fact, generally masked by an hypothesis. I...]  

Movement visibly consists in passing from one point to another and consequently, in traversing space. Now the space which is traversed is infinitely divisible; and as the movement is, so to speak, applied to the line along which it passes, it appears to be one with this line and, like it, divisible. Has not the movement itself drawn the line? Has it not traversed in turn the successive and juxtaposed points of that line? Yes, no doubt, but these points have no reality except in a line drawn, that is to say, motionless. And by the very fact that you represent the movement to yourself successively in these different points, you necessarily arrest it in each of them; your successive positions are, at bottom, only so many imaginary halts. You substitute the path for the journey, and because the journey is subtended by the path, you think that the two coincide. But how should a progress coincide with a thing. a movement with an immobility?  

What facilitates this illusion is that we distinguish moments in the course of duration, like halts in the passage of the moving body. Even if we grant that the movement from one point to another forms an undivided whole, this movement, nevertheless, takes a certain time, so if we carve out of this duration an indivisible instant, it seems that the moving body must occupy, at that precise moment, a certain position, which thus stands out from the whole. The indivisibility of motion implies, then, the impossibility of real instants; indeed, a very brief analysis of the idea of duration will show us both why we attribute instants to duration and why it cannot have any. Suppose a simple movement, like that of my hand when it goes from A to B. This passage is given to my consciousness as an undivided whole. No doubt it endures; but this duration, which in fact coincides with the aspect which the movement has inwardly for my consciousness, is, like it, whole and undivided. Now while it presents itself, qua movement, as a simple movement, as a simple fact, it describes in space a trajectory which I may consider, for purposes of simplification, as a geometrical line, and the extremities of this line, considered as abstract limits, are no longer lines, but indivisible points. Now, if the line, which the moving body has described, measures for me the duration of its movement, must not the point, where the line ends, symbolize for me a terminus of this duration? And if this point is an indivisible of length, how shall we avoid terminating the duration of the movement by an indivisible of duration? If the total line represents the total duration, the parts of the line must, it seems, correspond to parts of the duration and the points of the line to moments in time. The indivisibles of duration, or moments of time. are born, then, of the need of symmetry: we come to them naturally as soon as we demand from space an integral presentment of duration. But herein. precisely. lies the error. While the line AB symbolizes the duration already lapsed of the movement from A to B already accomplished, it cannot, motionless, represent the movement in its accomplishment nor duration in its flow. And from the fact that this line is divisible into parts and that it ends in points, we cannot conclude either that the corresponding duration is composed of separate parts or that it is limited by instants.  

The arguments of Zeno of Elea have no other origin than this illusion. They all consist in making time and movement coincide with the line which underlies them, in attributing to them the same subdivisions as to the line, in short, in treating them like that line. In this confusion Zeno was encouraged by common sense, which usually carries over to the movement the properties of its trajectory. and also by language, which always translates movement and duration in terms of space. But common sense and language have a right to do so and are even bound to do so, for, since they always regard the becoming as a thing to be made use of. they have no more concern with the interior organization of movement than a workman has with the molecular structure of his tools. In holding movement to be divisible, as its trajectory is, common sense merely expresses the two facts which alone are of importance in practical life: first, that every movement describes a space; second, that at every point of this space the moving body might stop. But the philosopher who reasons upon the inner nature of movement is bound to restore to it the mobility which is its essence, and this is what Zeno omits to do. By the first argument (the Dichotomy) he supposes the moving body to be at rest and then considers nothing but the stages, infinite in number, that are aiong the line to be traversed: we cannot imagine, he says. how the body could ever get through the interval between them. But in this way he merely proves that it is impossible to construct, a priori, movement with immobilities, a thing no man ever doubted. The sole question is whether, movement being posited as a fact, there is a sort of retrospective absurdity in assuming that an infinite number of points has been passed through. But at this we need not wonder, since movement is an undivided fact, or a series of undivided facts, whereas the trajectory is infinitely divisible. In the second argument (the Achilles) movement is indeed given; it is even attributed to two moving bodies, but, always by the same error, there is an assumption that their movement coincides with their path and that we may divide it, like the path itself, in any way we please. Then, instead of recognizing that the tortoise has the pace of a tortoise and Achilles the pace of Achilles, so that after a certain number of these indivisible acts or bounds Achilles will have outrun the tortoise, the contention is that we may disarticulate as we will the movement of Achilles and, as we will also, the movement of the tortoise: thus reconstructing both in an arbitrary way. according to a law of our own which may be incompatible with the real conditions of mobility. The same fallacy appears, yet more evident, in the third argument (the Arrow), which consists in the conclusion that, because it is possible to distinguish points on the path of a moving body, we have the right to distinguish indivisible moments in the duration of its movement. But the most instructive of Zeno's arguments is perhaps the fourth (the Stadium) which has, we believe, been unjustly disdained, and of which the absurdity is more manifest only because the postulate masked in the three others is here frankly displayed. Without entering into a discussion which would be out of place here, we will content ourselves with observing that motion, as given to spontaneous perception, is a fact which is quite clear, and that the difficulties and contradictions pointed out by the Eleatic school concern far less the living movement itself than a dead and artificial reorganization of movement by the mind.

Third Rule: State problems and solve them in terms of time rather than of space!  

This rule gives the ‘fundamental meaning' of intuition: intuition presupposes duration, it consists in thinking in terms of duration.2 We can only understand it by returning to the movement of the division determining the differences in kind. At first sight it would seem that a difference in kind is established between two things, or rather between two tendencies. This is true, but only superficially. Let us consider the principal Bergsonian division: that between duration and space. All the other divisions, all other dualisms involve it, derive from it, or result in it. Now we cannot simply confine ourselves to affirming a difference in kind between  

Deleuze/Intuition as Method//101  

duration and space. The division occurs between (1) duration, which 'tends' for its part to take on or bear all the differences in kind (because it is endowed with the power of qualitatively varying with itself), and (2) space, which never presents anything by differences of degree (since it is quantitative homogeneity). There is thus not a difference in kind between the two halves of the division: the qualitative difference is entirely on one side. When we divide something up according to its natural articulations (as with proportions and figures that vary greatly from case to case), we have, on the one hand, the aspect of space, by which the thing can only ever differ in degree from other things and from itself (augmentation. diminution); and on the other hand, the aspect of duration, by which the thing differs in kind from all others and from itself (alteration).  

Take a lump of sugar: it has a spatial configuration. But if we approach it from that angle, all we will ever grasp are differences in degree between that sugar and any other thing. But it also has a duration, a rhythm of duration, a way of being in time that is at least partially revealed in the process of its dissolving. and that shows how this sugar differs in kind not only from other things, but first and foremost from itself. This alteration, which is one with the essence of substance of a thing, is what we grasp when we conceive of it in terms of Duration. In this respect, Bergson's famous formulation, 'I must wait until thesugar dissolves'hasstill abroader meaning than is given toit by this context. It signifies that my own duration, such as I live it in the impatience of waiting.for example,servesto reveal other durations that beatto other rhythms, that differ in kind from mine. I...]

# Matthew Buckingham and Joachim Koester Points of Suspension//2002  

I...J Civic and military histories are inextricably intertwined and few social values or actions are so abstract that they fail to be reflected in material forms. 'Empty' or indeterminate spaces are often the most revealing. Today the second most popular tourist attraction in Copenhagen, after the bronze statue of Hans Christian Andersen's Little Mermaid, is the 1,200-person anarchistic squat located on the site of a former military base now known as the Free City of Christiania. Since 1971 it has existed as a police-free social experiment, self-governed under a direct-democratic process where all major decisions are made by unanimous vote. A sign posted at Christiania's main entrance declares: You are now leaving the European Union'[...]  

The founders of the Free City made King Christian the namesake of their new community and created a flag to represent themselves: three yellow dots on a red ground. “The Christiania Guide, a free publication for visitors, explains that the dots are taken from the three occurrences of the letter 'i' in the word Christiania.  

Symbols, like monuments, attempt to fix meaning against the flow of time. But Christiania's flag seems to do the opposite, marking transience and fragmentation. In the Free City one is surrounded by these three dots; enormous and tiny flags carrying the symbol blow in the wind, and the dots are printed on stickers and cigarette lighters, painted on buildings and bicycles, and posted on signs everywhere. The three dots resemble an ellipsis, or 'points of suspension', the typographical mark that indicates an omission, faltering speech, or an incomplete thought in a printed text. Wherever one of these ellipses appears, it seems to interrupt its surroundings - punctuating it with doubt.  

The individual dot 'evades our capacity to find its centre. Where is the central point, axis, pole, dominant interest, fixed position, absolute structure or decided goal?' This aspect of the dot is made explicit when it is multiplied by three, creating the ellipsis. A period, or full-stop, demands an ending, but three points together imply infinite points, making endings impossible. The ellipsis marks the indeterminate, but it also has the ability to join any two sentences together, and any ellipsis can potentially be connected to any other ellipsis, forrming an endless chain of possible thoughts. This is what makes these three dots a horizon line - a limit that is not a limit - because it is always receding into the distance. Empty space urging us onwards, reminding us that the vanishing point of history is always the present moment.

# Jean-Luc Nancy The Technique of the Present//1997  

I  

Poetry, before being the name of a particular art, is the generic name of art. Techne poietike: productive technique. This technique, that is, this art, this calculated operation, this procedure, this artifice produces something not with a view to another thing or a use, but with a view to its very production, that is, its exposition. The production of the thing puts the thing forward, presents and exposes it.  

To expose is to depart from a simple position, which is always also a deposition, a relinquishing of the contingence of a passing moment, a circumstance or a point of view. What is exposed is placed in the order of absolute, immutable and necessary presence. The word poiesis is derived from a word family that designates ordering, arrangement or disposition. Poetry disposes. Art is disposition. It disposes the thing according to the order of presence. It is the productive technique of presence.  

Presence is not a quality or a property of the thing. Presence is the act by which the thing is put forward: prae-est. It is put forward or in front of its nature as a thing. and of everything which immerses this nature in the world of its connections: origins, relations, process, finalities and becomings. The nature of the thing is in its birth, as the word 'nature' indicates, and in its unfurling within these relations. It can subsist only in this movement, and its permanence is in the passing. But presence is the act that subtracts a thing as it passes. In this way it subtracts the thing from its thingness, or it withdraws the thingness from the thing - that is, all the reality of the res - in the single foregrounding. in this single advancement.  

This advancement is that of the present. The present is not ahead in time, for that which is ahead in time in relation to a past is immediately behind in relation to a future. Unless the contrary is true. But in either sense, the present in time is nothing: it is pure time, the pure present of time, and thus its pure presence, that  

104//DURING  

is, the negativity of the passing. From ‘already no longer' to 'not yet' is a passage without pause, a step not taken, neither disposed nor exposed, inexposable, only and ceaselessly deposing all things.  

On Kawara's question is how this inexposable can be exposed. (In a certain sense, it is perhaps a question which the arts never cease to take up and pass between themselves: how to grasp the ungraspable of passing. how to grasp the pure conjunction of passing and presence, of fleeing and stasis?)  

The present of presence is not in time, it is ahead of time, in front of time. Or it is within it, not in its course, but in its most intimate heart or hollow. It is pure time subtracted from temporality: the space in which pure time opens out and inexposes itself. Space does not represent time, like a line that would be the immobile figure of a mobile process, but space opens time, distends time, distending the very moment to expose this present that does not pass, and that is time itself, negativity imposed for itself. Space is thus the origin of time. It is simultaneously its point of nullity and the whole extension of its successivity. It is the opening of time, the simultaneity of its spacing.  

On Kawara's art is a productive technique of this spacing, which, in effect, does not produce itself. It is not in nature. In nature, there is only the passage, the passing or the pass of time. Only outside nature can there be time itself. Outside nature: in a technique, in art.  

The spacing of time, or space opening time as such and as a totality, is before time, outside of time - in this ‘outside' that is not another place, because it is outside all places, but which is the taking-place of place in general and of all places. A place is always the curving or collecting of a certain closure (with its thresholds and outlets) within absolute spacing - or rather: a curving of this very within. There is thus no place for the pure spacing presupposed by every place. In the same manner (and it's the same thing), there is no world in which the creation of the world takes place. Thus.creation does not take (its) place. But what it is, or what it does, puts in place any possible place, and any taking-place.  

How, despite everything, can creation itself or absolute spacing be put in place? How can time leave time? What ruse, what detour, what skill can be used?  

On Kawara's art proposes a technique to put in place spacing itself, to put forward and expose spacing itself according to the curve, the contour, the frame of a place, in its local colour.  

For within time, the spacing of time does not present itself. Space-time itself does not open its creative hollow in time and space. A technique must be used for that: a technique, in sum, to recreate the creation that has not taken place.  

There must be a technique, just as there must be a technique to measure passing time. Clocks and calendars put chronometric techniques to work. They measure the number of time. But here is a chronometry that measures time's spacing, its opening, preceding and spanning its gap. It is chronomorphic poiesy.  

# 11  

On Kawara gathers the time of men, measurers of time. A million years back, a million years ahead. Between the two, the space where we are: we here now, as much as and as everyone, at every moment and in every place. But everyone, also, in the present of he who makes the work, and who withdraws from it as he opens it, who withdraws from it as he exposes it.  

Two million years do not constitute a history: they are history itself - along with prehistory and posthistory - in the totality of its span and sway. Not history as a grandiose or confused movement of the destiny of peopies, nor as the monumental heaping together of culture and barbarity, nor as an adventure of events, but history as the simultaneous presence of its millions of histories, present history, presentified history.  

In Greek, the meaning of historia is a collection or recollection of occurrences. On Kawara exposes the recollection of humanity past and humanity yet to come, subtracted from memory and expectation. The collection of a considerable number of years is in itself merely the logarithmic index of the monstrous or prodigous number of those that have passed and those that will pass. The'million' is not a count, it is the numeral or the code of the incommensurable, in the shape of a common measurement. All are present together, already past not yet arrived, unnamed, not anonymous, bound in a unique, complex collection: not 'men' but representatives of the present.  

Those who open space-time each time, those who from within nature distance nature, the technicians of presence: makers of steles, stanzas and instants. They are there grasped in their formidable absence, indistinguishable and unfigurable, artists, artisans, artificers.  

There is nothing to read in this long collection, nothing of their histories, nothing but the exhausting numerals of a computation that refers.to no founding or revolutionary event, to no feast or celebration.(Of course, the western Christian calendar is used, but its only function is as a universal indicating technique: in itself, it is merely the technical dissolution of its occidental specificity, and BC or AD no longer have sense, but are merely formal codes of location.) The only solemnity is the very idea of the solemn: that which takes place once a year, and here, it is the year itself in so far as it returns, identical and different, the solemn return of the annual.  

The year presents the annular space of a cycle of life and death. Beyond this, there is no cycle, there is history with its great rhythmic irregularities; but still further beyond, there is the simultaneous eternal present. Nothing distinguishes one year from another but the difference of a numeral, and nothing presents the perennial but the simultaneity, here, of all these differences. Their selfsamesameness.  

What can thus be read in this collection - and what is read aloud, pronounced by the alternating voices of a man and a woman, recorded and broadcast in this very hall - are the numerals that form the numbers of the years. The numbers have no signification. They constitute an order. They force a reading of the ordering of difference in identity, like that of the identity of their enunciation in the sexed difference of the voices. The reading of the collection - this reading that is more or less impossible and nonetheless available - is strictly ordered by its writing, by the reproduction of the traces of numerals one after the other, one by one and side by side, in the minuscule time of the mechanical strokes. Poetry without letters or words, poetry of cadenced regularity, numeral after numeral, going to the next line as the number changes, to the versus of the line, verse after verse, caesura after caesura, calculated discretion.  

#  

July 21, 1969: the date of the first moon landing of human cosmonauts. It's the date on which those who mark time, its artists, concretely open up the cosmic spacing of time. There is no longer a sublunar world of time, and a supralunar world of pure presence. The moon is no longer a signal of the partitioning of spheres, but is itself merely one of the points from which the space of time opens out simultaneously in all directions in the universe, one of the innumerable points stochastically disposed everywhere where there is someplace.  

There is no art that is not cosmological, because the productive technique of spacing produces the world each time, an ordering of the world, the world in whole or in part, but always the whole in each part each time. The world is never anything but the indefinite reference of all its points between themselves, and what is called a work of art is each time a singular, monadic and nomadic solidification of the cosmos.  

On July 21, 1969, something happens in the history of painting, and of poeisy in general. The heavens are no longer celestial. They are neither the province of light above all figures, nor the region of transfigurations. They are no longer heavens but space, and the night of space whose sole figure is the date: the arbitrary notation of its obscure opening. They are neither ground nor form, but the universal spacing of spaces, from all points to all other points: the ensemble of openings to the ensemble of what is open.  

Thus, the painting entitled July 21, 1969 paints the heavens because it covers one space among many with paint, a space identical to all spaces, and which is, as much as any other, at this instant, here and now, the origin or centre of all spacing. It is not man's conquest of space, but space's request of man.  

IV  

It is therefore the sacred, sacred painting. which is in question. That is to say. not painting used to represent religious themes, but the sacred proper to painting itself - and, in general, to the re-productive technique of the world. The sacred operates by setting aside or setting apart, in so far as this distancing is the condition of the relation or of communication - or more precisely. in so far as this gap is the condition of the infinitude of the relation. (The sacred is nothing other than the ordinary condition of communication: reserve, threshoid, access without access.)  

Painting cuts out a space - the most basic sacred gesture, the trace of the templum. The templum is the cut-out of the heavens, the caeli lucida templa that Lucretius speaks of and also calls magnas caeli cavernas. The templum is a hollowing-out of the heavens which defines relations, and, consequently. nonrelations aswell.  

The triptych is a classical form, or format, of western ecclesiastical painting. It is often placed above or before an altar. It can often (and originally. it always could) fold onto itself. It forms an articulation of spacing. a space that can open or close onto that which can be considered both as part of itself and as another space. It exposes the fold and the unfolding of space.  

Viet-Narm persists as the proper name of a time when the worid had to learn of another kind of partitioning than that practised by imperial domination. The principle of an empire is beyond space and time. It is a punctual and immobile power which extends indeterminately. and virtually interminably. Empire crushes the distances it extends. It is a spreading out, not a spacing.  

The dismembering of empire is a dis-location which distinguishes places. Here, Viet-Nam opens the present, 1965, of a partitioning of spaces which put a relation in place. It is a matter of understanding how each thing - one-thing. the 'one' and the 'thing' intrinsically linked - has its own place, puts its place in place, and puts equal places in equal relations.  

A place is opened and delimited by the always similar taking-place of an event that is always different. Taking-place is merely the intersection of time and space - its opening. This opening is singular, producing each time its own local colour - or rather, the place itself as a colour: it is the topology of geographical maps. This colour. here, the colour of the triptych Viet-Nam, is called 'magenta' or 'red magenta'. This is the name of a battle in which the troops of an empire were vanquished, in 1859. In 1860. the dark crimson colouring was discovered and given the name of the deadly battle of the preceding year. This colour is the darum of a bloody spatter.  

Painting does not use colours, it produces the colour of a place in so far as this place is an origin of the world. On the one hand, the place is independent of all places, and each locality is absolute: it instantly colours the totality of a world. But on the other hand, the place is merely localized by its relation to and distance from all places. It is ordered by its coordinates to the very ends of the world.  

The painting entitled Location paints the place of locality in general, painting it by the coordinates of a singular place. Latitude is a given measured in relation to the equator, which is the greatest length of land along the axis which does not connect the poles. Longitude is a given measured in relation to an arbitrarily selected meridian (at least, according to the arbitrary choice of making localization occidental and, in the Occident, English: the imperial place of geography). 'Meridian' means 'partitioning of the day': it is the line along which time (the hour) is the same from one of the Earth's poles to the other. Place is the intersection of the two measurements, according to space and according to time, the point where the one and the other prove to have no dimension, merely the crossing of two lines.  

Nothing subsists in a point, except for the simple exteriority of points in relation to each other. A point consists of nothing (it has no “inside'): it is merely relation to other points. There is no point of space nor point of time (as if it were a little particle of the one or the other), but space and time are the one-outsidethe-other of punctuality itself. Thus punctiform space immediately opens time which goes from one point to the other - and time opens space as the truth of its trajectory (the point which is already not the one and not yet the other). The encounter of space and time: here-and-now.  

This is not in the least abstract: it is the concrete itself - and it is what is present here. For this painting does not represent the coordinates of a point (which can, moreover, be found on a map and situated in the desert of North Africa). It does not represent: it gives the coordinates. It presents the truth of the point: its non-existence outside of its relation to all the points of this painting itself, its concrete absolute. The point pointed to here is in a determinate relation, always calculable, with the precise place where the painting is hung or placed. It is the concrete itself abstracted, that is, withdrawn from all that is not itself in its very concreteness. Hard as a grain of desert sand.  

(A brief word on 'conceptual art': On Kawara has often been presented as a conceptual artist. He himself strictly refuses this classification. Indeed, it has no more justification than most of these sort of qualifications, ‘abstract art' or 'minimal art', etc. If art can be conceptual, it is in the sense that ‘conceive' signifies gathering and containing in the self, giving place, space and form to a presence. But in this case art is always conceptual - and, most importantly, the concept must always end by conceiving of itself as art.)  

# V  

This painting which foregrounds the spacing of time as such foregrounds - exposes - that which, precisely, is not as such. It is not possible to say what the spacing of time is as such, because it is negativity for itself.2 Negativity cannot pose itself as itself (which would also suppose that it can be taken as something else, as another kind of thing): it can only open, it opens, it hollows out or punctures, it has no genre, not even its own. Unexposable, absolute exposer.  

The spacing of time is not a being, nor an operation of being or in being. If there is something in it, whatever it might be, it takes place only on the condition of the spacing of time, which is therefore anterior or exterior to being. Or more precisely: the spacing of time is the act of being - but not in the sense of the action of a subject. It is an act coextensive and co-originary to being itself. It is thus so little 'something' that not only is it not in space nor in time, but it is neither space nor time, and it is, in so far as it is, closer to this: space and time are two names, a double name, rather - space-time - for the necessarily double nature of that which is essentially outside itself (that whose essence consists in the outside-itself).  

Space-time is the unity of that which is outside itself in its very unity (or rather: outside it). It is the opening of the worid, of creation - but creation without a creator, without which space and time would only be in God, and thus, being in him, led back to a subsisting unity with neither space nor time. The one and the other, or rather, this one-other which they form together, are the originary extroversion of that which does not subsist in itself. Space is the condition of temporal passage, and time is the condition of spatial passage: the universal outside of the network of referrals which makes the inside of the world.  

The present is the negation of the double passage, or the pure grasping of the passage as such, immobilized on itself in its very movement: the instantaneous point and the punctual instant. The pure present is that which is purely outside the world, like its creation. But outside the world, there is no outside of the world: neither space, nor time of creation. Outside the world there is the outside of the outside: the intimacy of the opening.  

Poetic technique is devoted to presenting this present, what we call 'representing' not in the sense of recopying, because there is nothing here that can be copied, but in the sense of putting in front, putting forward. This art is devoted. like all art, perhaps, from its own angle, to putting forward that which remains buried, putting into the world that which is outside-the-world.  

With On Kawara, this technique is devoted to this project under a condition which may at first seem purely tautological. The date says nothing but itself. It could happen, moreover, that the tautology is multiplied in the redundancy of several canvases painted on the same day, bearing the same date. In saying nothing but itself, the date says nothing of itself: this time it is the date of nothing. of no event. It says of itself only (and it doesn't say it, it isn't visible): that it is painted the very day. In French, one can say, with all the resources of ambiguity: it is painted of the very day/on the very day.  

Moreover, it is in this and only this way that the date can speak in painting. that it is, effectively, and there again in all its ambiguity, the subject of the painting: it does not discourse on a story, it only announces itself, utters itself, offers itself. Nothing but a point in the network of all the dates of the world - of all the dates that the world is, being nothing else and itself dateless. That's why the date is not read on the canvas: it is not interpreted, it does not enter into a story, but one can only hear it. One hears a voice, although this time there is no recording to accompany the plastic and graphic work. One hears a voice, that is, a timbre and a tone, not a word. One hears time [le temps], one hears the which of the date [le tant],? as is said in French to indicate an undetermined date, the date in general or the idea of the date: le tanr','on est le tant' [what date is it?]). the tantum quantum, the quantity of measured time, not according to its duration, but according to its occurrence. Furthermore, what one hears in this way, before the canvas and coming from the canvas is not a foreign voice given the task of reporting the date, giving the information about it. One hears oneself saying the date: I see the canvas and I pronounce its date, thus repeating that which makes the canvas itself. With a canvas voice, matte and flat against the wall, each person says the which of the date [le tant] again.  

Reference to events is not absent, if one refers to the canvas's protective box, also exposed sometimes, containing one page of a newspaper from the day and the place where the canvas was made. But the properly pictorial gesture consists precisely in separating the date from its use as a point of reference for events and information.  

Tautological painting of the date makes the date what it is: a pure datum, with no other reference. ‘Date' comes from the formula littera data, 'given letter', consigned on this day. The date is the being-given of the given, or the given as such.  

As such, the given is only present: posed, deposed, being-there, without past and without future, without provenance and without destination, without donor and without recipient. The pure given as such in itself cancels the gift, reabsorbing the giving. Thus, strictly speaking, it is no longer given. The Date painting erases the date: it reinscribes it outside its giving, outside its dating. This date no longer dates: it is eternalized by the Date painting. For this reason it multiplies it indefinitely: the erasing is infinite because it is still on the date that the date erases itself. On the date of the painting - the day itself - but also the date of each re-exposition of the painting.  

Such is the logic of the present: at this precise moment, the moment erases itself, and this is how it is a moment. The voice becomes silent, sticks to the canvas, and this is how it resonates: and its resonance is painting. The instant is unstable, and in this way it is an instant. The present is a spacing in which presence conceals itself. That is to say that it does not subsist there. It is not given, posed, deposed, available as an object, as a thing. The present opposes presence: it ruins it, abducts it, in the same movement by which it brings it.  

The most one can say is that presence gives itself: it gives itself and conceais itself, in the same gesture of the present, in the same comings and goings of the present. But giving itseif is precisely not to be given. Giving itself is the act of a subject - and it may very well be the exemplary act of the subject. But this assumes that it takes itself from this side of itself in order to deliver itself beyond itseif. In this gesture, the self subtracts itself. It is nothing - if it can be said to 'be' - but the distance berween this side of it and its beyond. This distance 'is' thus the self 'itself', the present of the self - not its presence: the space it needs to be itself, to attain the self as much as to return to the self.  

The date is here the subject. That is to say that the subject of this painting is the subject, absolutely. What must then be understood here is that the subject, here, paints itself. Or rather, if one wishes, that painting. here, subjectivises itself. These two propositions are correlative and reciprocal. Painting and subject identify the one with the other, and the one by the other.  

(It must be immediately specified that this may have something, or nothing. to do with the individual subject On Kawara, with his anxiety or with his certainty of being himself, and being a painter, and existing in general, etc. In this respect, all hypotheses are equally possible, and they are equally indifferent, at least in respect to what is presented to us, which is painting, and not an encounter with a person. There is no presence of no one: nothing but the present of painting.)  

The subject can only be present as [en tant que} a painted subject. Painting can be present only as [en tant que] a painting of the subject. Painting is the presenter (or giver) of the subject just as much as the subject is the presenter (or giver) of painting. The present cannot be such as it is [en tant que tel] except in the spacing of the present, that is., of time itself. The subject can be only the subject of a retreat on this side, and not beyond, its own presence.  

# V1  

From this group of interdependent propositions, the Date paintings allow for verification on four broad axes:  

1) painting itself, that is, the pigment, paste, diligently applied, smoothed to the limits of the pure plane without, nonetheless, doing away with the traces of the  

112//DURING  

brush, affirming that a ground is covered over, making the ground come forward - the pure thickness obscure in itself - like a ground that surfaces, the presentation of a ground, like the side of a cut-off corner where the ground opens the eye: it itself opens like an eye that looks at us by opening our eyes. What can be seen in this way is painting emptied by the present of its own execution. I paint the date on which I paint. As if each painting, here, was an enlargement of one of the corners where the painter has painted the date the painting was completed. But also: as if the date were a naked ground which had to be painted. Painting, in this sense, is first of all the affirmation of a surface. Why paint the walls of a room? Not to \*beautify', but because without paint the walls disappear, melt into a groundless ground, taking the dwelling with them. Now, there must be a dwelling [demeure]: sojourn, lateness, remaining, repose, and even reserve, delay. The present held back against the precipitation of time, the present extracted from time, spaced.  

2) the colour of the painting, which is the vibration of the surface: the trembling. quivering, shivering, shuddering or brushing of the present, the noise and rustle of its restraint. The numerals and letters of the date are painted in white. White is the colour beyond colours, the colour of their simultaneous presence, which also causes their disappearance: the colour of pure simultaneity remains.  

But the ground (or the surface emptied by the date), the ground is at bottom that which the date, here, designates (that it designates and dates at the same time, that it designates in dating), the ground that is thus the referent of the date - its thing, its substance, its dated - is each time but one colour. This colour varies, dark or sky blue, green, brown or dark grey, sometimes cadmium red, the tendency is to sombre colours, but this darkening is not obscurity: the day is never consumed by the dark, in real black. No black out, but gradation, relation and difference, chromatism, that is flesh, the complexion (chroma comes from chros, surface of the body, skin, flesh), the light brushing of its proper nuance, the perceptible distancing of an imiperceptible distinction, grasped at the moment of its detachment, of its distancing within a limited but infinitely reduced spectre: when one speaks of an imperceptible 'gradation', that means that the present of the leap has not been felt, not grasped at the instant it passed, the presence of the leap. Each canvas, size and colour, only detaches itself from the others, opening between them the series, the rhythm and the syncopation of presents. Difference in the identity of the present.  

3) the calculation of mimesis, or the fiction of presentation. The presence of the present must be made, fabricated, composed, modelled and thus feigned. This poiesis is necessary to grasp the ungraspable. Thus, the painted date is immediately destabilized: it is as feigned as it is true. Its truth (being the date of the date of the painting) has no other attestation than itself, which could nonetheless have been painted on another date. In a parallel fashion, its truth (being the very date of the very date) is lost as soon as the date is over, and the painting with it. At midnight, this truth is no longer current, but the painting is ready to expose it. But in this way it is a truth: by conserving itself across time, the immobile repeated acute present of an vanished present. In exposing itself as this date - this given - it exposes that the given absolutely conceals the gift. But this concealed gift is that which gives itself again each time, at each exposition: it gives itself again, withdrawn into its feigning. Each date announces: I am a present which has passed as the present that it says, and which perhaps, in saying it, feigns only to have been, but which is no less incontestably present as this saying and as this feigning.  

This is exactly what another great fictioner says, at the height of his feigning - Descartes, when he pronounces: ego sum, ego existo. The certitude of the ego sum is coextensive with the time of its enunciation (or its thought). Outside of this present, my being or my existence may be nothing but a fiction. But this present, precisely, repeats itself incessantly. it does not cease to arrive. Here, the certitude of the date is coextensive with its exposition. It is immediately, at the instant, my certainty as a spectator: that I see this date, and that I am myself, here and now, its truth. I am not before an old calenda1. I am before the repetition in the present of the present of this date. I am the present of each date. Today - the title of the series - is each time the today of the exposition.  

4) the exposition as such: the position-before, there-before, over there before us. The date is subtracted from the course of time, and from its referential function. It coordinates nothing: it does not allow an act to be situated in a succession. It exposes the simultaneity of an act with itself. 'I am painting this painting', On Kawara wrote on 18 January 1966. And ten days later: “I am dating here:  

But a date, in English, is also an encounter. And to date can mean: 'go to an encounter'. The date is the possibility of an encounter, with the indication of a place, that is, of the point ordered by the punctuality of the encounter. Here, the place is here. That is, anywhere: in any place where I am dating here, that is in any place where a date painring can be exposed. On Kawara sets a date anywhere. anytime, he sets a date with 'the date' itself. The painting announces: find me there where I am, and we will meet. You will recognize me by this, that I am only there for the encounter. And I will recognize you by the same. We will be there, you as well as I, only to find ourselves there. (In the same way, a museum, a gallery, is a place made to be a place).'Find ourselves there', s'y trouver, in French, can mean both 'be there' and 'meet each other there, find each other there again'.  

# 114//DURING  

We will find each other by each other. Something to see which finds itself there only to be seen, and a seer who finds himself there only to see, to regard - that is, with regard for the visible. It's sight's date with vision. The encounter of sight with its capacity to have regard for its own opening, for its own gaze, that is also for its own ideality: seeing the very form of seeing.  

The form of seeing is the opening of the eye, and in it the spreading of the pupil. This spreading adjusts itself to light, which allows the present of a form with its colour to penetrate in the orifice - this little mute mouth open in the centre of the iris. No form without colour, no colour without form. The simultaneous solidarity of form and colour makes the present of vision. Vision sees the present, but only because the present opens the eye, and disposes it to its presentation.  

The present is this disposition which exposes the thing to its vision. That is, to its desire to be open to itself. Seeing and knowing are the same thing. Veda, Sanskrit, oida Greek, wissen German. The thing seen and known is the thing which is not left to its opaque thickness. It is the thing cut by the present which distances it from itself - by the plane that colours and exhibits it.  

It's the thing as this thing. The thing at an encounter with itself. My gaze is this encounter. It is not the representation of the thing, nor am I the subject of a representation nor of an intention (for me, in me, absorbed by me, consumed, appropriated, filled). I am the staring present of the presentation. I am the place of the date. I am only that, and I' - ego - means nothing else. The spacing of a point which is nonetheless not the spacing between two points. A single distended point: not the infinite divisibility of space, but the division of the indivisible product of all division. The non-dimension as distention. No intentionality. But the precise date of the end of intention, on this side of all aims. Poetry is the productive technique of this end. For what one wants to feel is nothing but this: this end, each time, this overflowing of the present in any present whatsoever. That's what one strives to fabricate, behind the immense and perpetual flowing of presence. But where, behind where, and when? There where time opens.

[Reflections in response to Olafur Eliasson's The Weather Project]  

# Expectations  

The most predictable remark you can make about the weather concerns, of course, its unpredictability. James Gleick tells a story about the beginnings of understanding 'chaos' in which meteorology is central:  

Clouds represented a side of nature that the mainstream of physics had passed by. a side that was at once fuzzy and detailed, structured and unpredictable ... For as long as the world has had physicists inquiring into the laws of nature, it has suffered a special ignorance about disorder in the atmosphere ... As the revolution in chaos runs its course, the best physicists find themselves returning without embarrassment to phenomena on a human scale. They study not just galaxies but clouds.  

And it is indeed odd that in a world where there is instantaneous communication, journeyings to other planets, genetic manipulation - in other words the most incredible technological wizardry and control - you can still walk out of the house and quite unexpectedly get totally drenched from head to foot.  

There is a house I visit often, in southern France. This region of northern Catalonia, lying between the Atlantic and the Mediterranean, between the Pyrennees and the Cevennes, is at the mercy of the winds. Each wind has a name: Vent de Alt, Gregal, Levant, Migjorn, Tramuntana ... The kind of weather the district receives depends on which of these is blowing through at any given hour. Each brings a distinctive temperature, rainfall (or lack of it), humidity, even quality of light. The violent storms of the Tramuntana, the fierce cold in the mountains to the south, the clear dryness of the Mediterranean: each of these also varies by season. A small shift in the configuration of the ever-mobile weather system and you have to rethink your plans for the day.  

Yet this account of the expectation of variability is founded on its own temperate-zone assumptions. There are places where you can rely, for days or even weeks on end, on sunshine, or on freezing cold, or on the fact that it will rain. Even the expectation of variability, then, might leave you surprised.  

And even in these weather-obsessed islands the unpredictability of conditions is regularly denied in the service of caricature. Lazy journalists evoke dreariness through reference to wet mornings in Walsall, or Telford. Why these places? They  

# 116//DURING  

are clearly not always rainy. The weather is enlisted to heighten an effect; to typify. The assumption is that ‘we' are not from such places, or that there are no wet mornings where ‘we' are. Rather we are recruited, along with the weather, into collaboration with the sneering superiority of the writer. This is, perhaps, a vestigal survival of the wider and persistent phenomenon of 'moral climatology'2  

However, we smile together at the image of dullness. For the caricature of the weather is used not just to indicate what undoubtedly is the case (that the weather is different from place to place - a positive variability) but to establish a mutual characterization.  

All visitors to the house in Catalonia arewarned:‘DO NOT LEAVE THE HOUSE WITHOUT SECURING THE SHUTTERS' - it could be that, unexpectedly. the Tramuntanawill blow.  

# Encounters  

Imagine a journey. It does not have to be an epic one; it could be quite quotidian, simply from 'here' to 'there' - from Manchester to Liverpool let's say. One way to picture it is as travelling across space. You're moving between two places on a map. Manchester and Liverpool are given; and you, the active one, travel between them. You have a trajectory.  

Now think of it another way. For this movement of yours is not just spatial; it's also temporal. So, you're barely out of Manchester, approaching the mosses that stretch away, flat, on either side, when Manchester itself has moved on. Lives have pushed ahead, business has been done, the weather has changed. That collection of trajectories that is Manchester is no longer the same as when you left it. It has lived on without you. And Liverpool? Likewise it has not just been lying there, static on the map, awaiting your arrival. It too has been going about its business; moving on. Your arrival in Lime Street, when you step off the train, begin to get into the things you came here to do, is a meeting-up of trajectories as you entangle yourself in stories that began before you arrived. This is not the arrival of an active voyager in an awaiting passive destination but an intertwining of ongoing trajectories, from which something new may emerge. Movement, encounter and the making of relationships take time.  

It is impossible to encounter something with no preconceptions at all, but the full recognition that the encountered is also moving on at least slightly disturbs one's confidence in the fact that these expectations will be met. An encounter is always with something 'on the move'. The voyager is not the only active one. Origin and destination have lives of their own. This project of undoing that traditional counterposition of active subject and passive object is an element in Olafur Eliasson's practice. He challenges the static, given, implacable 'objecthood' of art.  

And this is also to challenge some received ideas about space. Eliasson has drawn on occasion on the writings of Henri Bergson. For example, he chose a long extract from Creative Evolution (1907) as his ‘artist's choice' in a recent monograph.3 Bergson writes of 'movement, which is reality itself.4 This is movement in the widest sense: of process, of change. Space, then, cannot be a static slice orthogonal to time and defined in opposition to it. If movement is reality itself then what we think of as space is a cut through all those trajectories; a simultaneity of unfinished stories.  

Space has time/times within it. This is not the static simultaneity of a closed system but a simultaneity of movements. And that is a different thing altogether. It means, for one thing, that you can't go back in space: the myth of the return. By the time you get on the train again to go back home that night, disentangling yourself - physically at least - from those Liverpudlian trajectories, the Manchester you left will not be the Manchester of now (just as you yourself will have changed). Space has its times. To open up space to this kind of imagination means thinking about time and space together. You can't hold places and things still. What you can do is meet up with them, catch up with where another's history has got to 'now', and acknowledge that 'now' is itself constituted by that meeting up. ‘Here', in that sense, is not a place on a map. It is that intersection of trajectories, the meeting-up of stories; an encounter. Every 'here' is a here-and-now.  

Nor is it only a matter of origin and destination. As the train rattles back, past sprawling factories, through Newton-le-Willows, across the open lived-in flatness of south Lancashire, it is travelling not across space-as-surface but across a multitude of stories. That tree that blows now in the wind out there, that tired factory on the way to defeat, that person running for the bus ... these are things 'caught' in the act, but they are acts that are moments-in-process, never to be stabilized. The train transects a million ongoing histories.  

There is an old association between the spatial and the fixation of meaning. Representation, conceptualization, the work of the intellect, is imagined as spatialization. Bergson figures again here, but leaving a less happy legacy. His burning concern was with temporality, with duration, with a commitment to resisting the evisceration of time's internal continuity, flow and movement. Thus 'language ... always translates movement and duration in terms of space'5 and 'The more consciousness is intellectualized, the more is matter spatialized.\*6  

It's easy to see how this can happen. That business of laying things out side by side; indeed the production of a simultaneity. So Bergson writes (in Matter and Memory, 1896) of substituting the path for the journey; Michel de Certeau of substituting a tracing for acts. But this has effects. It is not just that representation is equated with spatialization but that the characteristics thus derived (fixation, stabilization) have come to be attributed to space itself. The argument is that representation/spatialization tames the vitality of the temporal. Space begins to  

# 118//DURING  

get a bad name. Michel Foucault's classic recantation of the long history of the denigration of space begins: Did it start with Bergson, or before?'7 The problem has been that the old chain of meaning (space-representation stasis) continues to wield its power. The legacy lingers on. De Certeau writes of 'the spatialization of scientific discourse ... scientific writing ceaselessly reduces time, that fugitive element, to the normality of an observable and readable system. In this way, surprises are averted.'s  

There is a complex argument here, but just two points will suffice for now. First, what representation stabilizes (if it really does, and that's another argument) is not just time, but space-time. So often the issue is formulated as though the world that is to be represented is only temporal. It certainly is temporal; but it is spatial too. And 'representation' is an attempt to capture both aspects of that world. Second, in de Certeau's formulation, a tracing is itself a representation; it is not 'space'. The map is not the territory. In Bergson's substitution we may take the path to be a real path. It is not the map; it is the territory itself. But then, a territory is integrally spatio-temporal.  

It is not space that takes the life out of time, but representation. The real trouble is that the old equation of representation with spatialization has taken the life out of space.  

# Multiplicity  

Each day the newspaper I take provides an account of weather conditions 'around the world' on the previous day. (Except in the Americas, because the newspaper is put to bed before the earth has turned far enough upon its axis to enable noontime readings there to be registered, read and reported on. For those parts of the world the reading is for the day before yesterday.) 88 degrees fahrenheit and sunny in Algiers; 48 degrees and cloudy in Helsinki; cloudy again but 77 degrees in Beijing. (That day in London it was 57 degrees, with thunder.) The coeval existence of a multiplicity of conditions: that is the gift of space. Space is the sphere of the possibility of the existence of plurality, of the coexistence of difference. It is the sphere of the possibility of the existence of more-than-one. Without space there is no 'multiplicity' in that sense. (And equally, though this is another argument, without more-than-one, there is no space.) That is the meaning of space as a simultaneity of stories; that sense of 'right now'. Right now there is someone growing manges-tout for your table; right now there is chaos on the streets of Baghdad; right now it is just about noon on the West Coast of the Americas (while it is already evening here in London).  

Hegemonic geographical imaginations tend to present things differently. Countries, it is often said, are ‘advanced' or “backward’ or, in a less explicitly derogatory but more obfuscating terminology, they are developed or developing.  

It is not to deny any notion of 'progress' or 'improvement' (though it may well be to question these terms and the assumptions made by them) to argue that this is to play games with space and time. It is, in effect, to turn space into time, geographical difference into historical sequence. The difference between 'developing' places and ‘advanced' places is our relative positions along a trajectory imagined as singular. The fullness of their contemporaneous otherness is restrained, reduced to a place in a historical queue. Their future is already foretold in our present (though, of course, given the iniquitous dynamics of capitalist globalization it is not). Their space (quite literally) to imagine an alternative future is constrained by an imagination of space as time.  

A lively alertness to the more-than-oneness of space disallows that relegation of contemporaneous difference to the past, and the convening of space into time.  

It is not only in the worlds of globalization and geopolitics that these tricks occur. It is not just 'them' as opposed to‘us' who perform these manoeuvres. Tourists' imaginations can do the same sort of thing: that ‘timeless' holiday paradise; that 'place that time forgot'; the migrant longing for a former home (which is now transformed beyond recognition - no longer there). Journeys 'home' are, in the imagination, often travels in time as well as space - journeys to the past. But places go on without you. A nostalgia, or a set of expectations that does not take account of that deprives others of their agency, denies their ongoing histories. It converts their coeval, different space into a moment in your time. In a move that is a form of colonisation, it holds others still.  

At one point in his Postmodemism, or The Cultural Logic of Late Capitalism (1991)9 Fredric Jameson gets very severe with a passage from Jean-Paul Sartre's La Nausee.0 Sartre had been trying to get to grips with the heterogeneity of other lives, the other things being done at the very moment of his own thinking. Jameson rates this a 'pseudo experience', 'a failure to achieve representation' as 'voluntaristic, an assault of the will on what is "by definition" structurally impossible of achievement.'1 Yes, recognizing all this is impossible. Every train journey (and that would be the least of it) would become a nightmare of guilty admission of all the stories the fullness of whose coeval coexistence you did not manage to recognize. But this is not at all what is at issue. Rather it is a change in perspective. Eliasson, from a different but not unrelated philosophical trajectory. writes of 'seeing yourself sensing'12 It is a matter of a change in the angle of vision - to throw yourself into the spatial, as Bergson might have said. It is a lively awareness of the dimension of coevality; the imaginative opening up of space to times.  

Jameson has written persuasively of the depthlessness of the postmodern era, but often what is proposed instead is a return to the singular modernist narrative. While the former is all space and no time, the latter, I would argue, is all time (a singular history) and no space (for coeval others, competing voices).  

To takeonboard thecoevalityof spaceis torefuse that flipping of theimaginative eye from modernist singular temporality to postmodern instantaneity. It would be to stand amid contemporaneous multiple becomings.  

And that means, again, that space is not a surface. The map is not space. It is a representation of space-time. The weather maps in my newspaper catch things at a moment ('Noon today'). There is an occluded front over Iceland and in Kirkcudbright heavy downpours, though with sunshine too. The legend below the isobars tells us that things will change ('Low D will move towards the UK.') As the fronts move across the land (which is itself moving on and round and round), each place lives through them in succession - after a dry start turning wet in Eastern England, in Northern Ireland, on the contrary, it is clearing up. A plurality ofdaysofweather.  

The recognition that everything is constitutively in process by no means implies - or should not imply - a celebration of mobility as opposed to stability, of transience rather than settlement, of flight as against commitment. Mobility is a theme-tune of our times. Mobility, nomadism, flows: a space of flows replaces a space of places; networks instead of territories. But these are descriptions (accurate or not), not prescriptions.  

Principles as general as this would anyway be problematic. For the world is specific, and structured by inequalities. It matters who moves and how you move.  

Nomadism is also the mantra of the neoliberal: financial capital is constantly circulating; the factory may be “fly-by-night. (And what of the rights of migration?) The emphasis on the times of space is a reminder of co-agency. This is much more of a spatial challenge, for it raises the question of negotiation.)  

# Terms of Engagement  

The different winds that reach us in the village in Catalonia provide a kind of sensual orientation. From the South can come a brisk shudder of recognition that there is still, so late in spring, snow among the Pyrennees; the Marinada wafts hints of the sea.  

They are reminders of this place's place in the wider scheme of things. That same day the newspaper reported 'some very high temperatures for the time of year'. During the previous weekend southerly winds had brought with them the heat of the Sahara, leaving southern Turkey sweltering at more that 35 degrees centigrade (95 degrees fahrenheit) and then pushing on north across eastern Europe and western Russia. We are all interconnected. I remember standing at my window that evening of the Chernobyl disaster, staring out at the clouds and wondering what they might be bringing with them.  

The space of many trajectories, the simultaneity of stories so far, is also the product of those connections. They are constantly disconnected by new arrivals, constantly waiting to be determined (and always therefore undetermined) by the construction of new relations. This space is always therefore, in a sense. unfinished (except that ‘finishing' is not on the agenda). if you were really to take a slice through time it would be - in this sense - full of holes, of discontinuities, of tentative half-formed first encounters; space being made. 'Everything is connected to everything else' can be a salutary political reminder that whatever we do has wider implications than perhaps we commonly recognize. But it is unhelpful if it leads to a vision of an already constituted holism. It is rather that there are always connections yet to be made. juxtapositions yet to flower into interaction - or not - potential links that may never be established. Space then, sensed in this way. is not a completed simultaneity in which all interconnections have been established, in which every place is already linked to everywhere else.  

There are always loose ends. If you were to make a map that really had the characteristics of this space, it would be entirely possible to fall through it.  

And it is in the terms of engagement among these intersecting trajectories that lie the politics, the productivity. the questions, the expectations, the potential for surprise.

# Timothy Barker Recomposing the Digital Present//2011  

Consider a late-model car. It is a disparate aggregate of scientific and technical solutions dating from different periods. One can date it component by component: this part was invented at the turn of the century. another ten years ago, and Carnot's cycle is almost two hundred years old. Not to mention that the wheel dates back to Neolithic times. The ensemble is only contemporary by assemblage. -Michel Serres,Conversations on Science, Culture and Time,1995  

In Serres' description of the late-model car, we see an image of presentness constituted by a drawing together of what he terms the 'pleats of time'. In essence this is a multi-temporal assemblage, taking form in the present. The object that is the late-model car emerges from an aggregate of solutions from different periods in history. In other words, the aggregate of solutions is a grounding from which the present object - and the present moment that is made up of these objects - becomes. What is important to Serres is not the materiality of the latemodel car but rather the processes that it embodies, and the way that the object draws together once disparate moments in time into a field of multi-temporality. For Serres, the object or the image, whether this be a car, a book, a thought or a memory, and likewise every moment in time, is always multi-temporal or polychronic. Like the late-model car, it is always made up of an aggregate of solutions, concepts or problems originating from different historical eras. Multitemporal time is a scalar type of time. It has quantity. thick with multiple temporal episodes overlaid in the present, but not a linear direction; it is an archaeological mode of temporality, in which the present moment, the point at which we receive aesthetic information and interact with technology, takes into itself multiple scales of the past. [...]  

Janet Cardiff's Her Long Black Hair (2o04) demonstrates the overlay of actual time by the temporality expressed through a composition of representational and physical processes. In Cardiff's work, participants wear headphones and are led around New York's Central Park via a pre-recorded voice-over. Occasionally the participants are instructed to stop and inspect a collection of photographs they have been given. As they hold a photograph up to the scene in front of them, it becomes clear that the participants have been led to the exact spot where the photograph was once taken. Using binaural recording techniques that render a 360-degree sound space mirroring the real world, the walks lead participants around pathways, developing a narrative through the voice-over supplied by the woman with long black hair. She makes observations as we move through the park, accompanied by ambient sounds as well as stories about local histories, which seem to surround the listener and interject at certain points throughout the walk. Putting on the headphones, participants hear footsteps. These are the footsteps of the narrator, and they are told to try to match their footsteps to hers. Later in the work, after instructing participants to turn left along the street, the voice-over tells them that they see peanut sellers, which are not physically present. They also hear dogs barking. getting closer, which again are not physically present but give the sense that they once were. This aural re-presentation links a contemporary Central Park to historical and fictitious events re-presented, in the sense of making present again. Hence, this work overlays the physical time of the present with the other temporal events narrated through the audio, as we follow the woman's voice through Central Park, taking the same route that she took at the time of its original recording. Through this process of spatio-temporal overlay, Her Long Black Hair creates an augmented type of reality, thickened with two levels of temporality, as the space of the past synchronizes contemporaneously with the space traversed in the present.  

What is at stake in the multi-temporality composed by Cardiff is the way histories, both personal and collective, are in constant contact with our experiences of the present moment. The voice-over tells us that 'there are always so many layers in front of my eyes', reiterating how layers of the past alter perception and experience in the present. While we navigate through presentday Central Park in cooperation with our virtual tour guide, we hear stories specific to the location, such as comments about the polar bears in Central Park Zoo, vignettes from the different neighbourhoods that take the form of excerpts from documentary interviews, or news stories with the testimony of Harry Thomas from the 1850s, a refugee from the slave states who walked across America into Canada. These are supplemented, furthermore, with quotations from other famous walkers such as Charles Baudelaire and Soren Kierkegaard. Interspersed throughout this larger narrative of place that ebbs and flows backwards and forwards in time, are flashbacks from Cardiff's own experiences while living in New York. At one point Cardiff even shifts from her role as tour guide to answer her cell phone, allowing us to eavesdrop on a short conversation in which she reassures her partner that she is safe in the park at night.

In the early part of the twentieth century. a period dominated by scientific rationalism, Bergson theorized the primacy of immediate experience and intuition in understanding time and the nature of reality. positioning it as a flow O1 duration, rather than a series of causally dependent instants. Deleuze uses many of Bergson's famous illustrations of this type of time, and I would like particularly to focus here on the inspiration that Deleuze takes from two of  

Bergson's images. Firstly, Bergson provides Deleuze with a picture of time as a tape running between two spools, with the past accumulating on one spool and the present passing between the spools.1 Secondly, Bergson pictures time as an inverted cone, travelling along a horizontal line.2 The point at which the summit of the cone intersects the line is the point at which one experiences an image of the body moving in the present. As we move upwards from this present into the wider parts of the cone, we move into the realm of pure memory. Thus, in order for a memory to become actualized in the present, it must descend the cone, moving into the tip and becoming a part of our movement in the present. From these images, Deleuze reads in Bergson a conception of the past that is outside or beyond the mind, as a plane of immanence, a plane 'in which the whole past is entangled and coexists at different levels of expansion and contraction'3 [...]  

The past is brought into the present in Cardiff's work as we navigate the present directed, literally in this case, by events that occurred in the past. In [this] work, the digital medium is not merely a means of representing the world. Rather it is a mode of re-composing the present, of providing a means to rethink the present, to understand it as thick with multiple temporalities. [...]

# Karen Archey Timeliness//2011  

The concept of time, slippery and peripatetic, has long been a favourite indulgence of artists, theoreticians and writers. Although philosophical doctrines have been penned, sculptures erected, and books of poems published in years past, the topic remains evasive, especially in light of recent technological innovations that often disorient and streamline our circadian habits. Our experience of time is highly personal, customized, even. Yet a macro-level consideration of how our collectively shared experience of daily time has changed in the recent past reveals a quickening of pace, the result, perhaps, of increasing integration of technology with the everyday, accompanied in some instances by a reactionary appreciation for the slow, skilled and considered. What can be gleaned today from the accrued and fractured accounts of time, the quickening and lessening of pace, as feit through the works of an artist?  

There are certain artists whose works exist in multiple temporalities, and challenge the notion of temporality itself. They exhibit a sensitivity to an evolving contemporary condition defined by this recently developed shift in pace. Such work operates under multiple, connected working methods, each containing at least two temporalities: the first being the specific cultural moment in which it is made, evidenced by the marks and mediums endemic to its time; the subsequent moment being that in which the work is accessed or activated by its viewer. But what happens when these temporalities are complicated, or even masked? Is it possible for an artwork to possess multiple meanings through different activation points in time, or preserve a singular meaningthatistimeless?  

Consider Andy Warhol's Time Capsules project, an archive of the artist's everyday accruals from 1974 to his death in1987.A set of 612 datedcardboard boxes containing banalities ranging from daily newspapers, correspondence and financial records to gifts and refuse, Warhol's Time Capsules reimagine the impetus of the first time capsule realized in 1939 by Westinghouse Corporation for New York's World Fair. As per the popular understanding of the time capsule, theWestinghouseversioncombined and preserved itemsconsideredemblematic of their historical moment: microfilaments, bank notes, recorded messages from Albert Einstein, commonly used textiles, etc. Somewhat perversely, the boxes containing Warhol's cast-offs have since been lovingly catalogued, preserved and photographed by museum archivists. Yet Warhol presciently understood that it was the near-invisibie matter most familiar to us that may most distinctly define  

126//DURING  

a given historical moment, perhaps more so than whatever is ceremoniously deemed significant at the time. Warhol's nonchalantly collected materials accumulate significance and authority through their maturation, acting as a glimpse into its historical moment.  

While Warhol's Time Capsules simply exist in two temporalities (the dates on which Warhol archived his accumulations, and the moment in which they are activated by the viewer), it was his intention to create tension between his temporality and a projected future moment of activation that renders the work prescient. An oppositional model to Warhol's auguring one, meanwhile, would be that of fashion: an artist who has little regard for the future activation of her artwork, which consequently becomes diminished conceptually in time. Although such work may exist fruitfully in its given moment, the lack of consideration of its future activation will result in that work remembered solely relevant to its specific historical moment, and thus anachronistic. One could understand Julian Schnabel's oeuvre as such: while the artist acts as a figurehead to the bigness of the 1980s, his work has since been reduced to emblematizing this period.  

Working primarily through video and film-based photography, Moyra Davey contemplates the crawl of time twofold: first by tracking the frustrating accumulations particular to the domestic - dust, paper piles, empty gin bottles - and, secondly, by indexing the extinction of the late twentieth-century technology. Davey's straightforward photographs forlornly document shelves of dusty books, vinyl records, Manhattan news stands and radios as an emotional consideration of objects, and the slowness and authority they represent. Indexed here is the waning societal moment in which objects related to an impassioned amateur or critical hobbyist were found through sifting, browsing, luck and skill, but have since been replaced by programmatic search. No longer must we dig through record store bins to find a rare album - such an experience has become a streamlined digital interface. Davey's photographs are intimately scaled and shot on film, pointing to a further implicit challenge to the current status quo of digital imaging technology.  

A similar celebration of skill-based media and predilection for indexing moments of the recent past can be seen in the work of Glasgow-based artist Alan Michael. A hyperrealist painter, in his oversize canvases he pictorializes oftfigureless and seemingly banal scenes with a virtuoso expertise. His paintings evidence specific, recent instances depicting the confluence of corporate and cultural branding and the design of one's identity - in short, the paradoxical attempt to aestheticize and brand individualism to masses of people only visible to them after the passage of time. A number of his Mood series (2010), depict rows of blue 'Vitamin Water' bottles redesigned so that their labels are in a different font each time, while another (Mood 3) renders a slightly out-of-focus  

1960s-style white circular badge covered with psychedelic lettering. The bamboo plant depicted in Mood 9, once a part of savvy interior decor in the 1990s, now seems hopelessly taboo. While Davey and Michaels' work may be made contemporaneously, both artists cite the expiration of previous historical moments to understand the fleeting nature of our current one.  

If these artists gesture towards the reordering of the present by illustrating the waning of moments passed, new media artist Cory Arcangel forecasts the impending obsolescence of the present moment specifically through the lens of technology. His series of Photoshopped gradient prints pre-empt their own expiry by maximizing the printing technology available at their creation.Arcangel predicts that, due to the rapid advancement of imaging technology. the prints will quickly look outdated, thereby exposing the limitations characteristic to the technology of that year. The titles of Arcangel's gradient prints act as instructions for work's digital creation: Photoshop CS: 84 by 66 inches, 300 DPl, RGB, square pixels, default gradient ‘Blue, Red, Yellow', mousedown $y{=}18200x{=}1350$ mouseup $y=23400x=18250$ (2010), positions the series as digital readymades that viewers may create themselves. Moreover, one could argue that the aesthetic deskilling found in Arcangel's gradients reflects a similar tendency within society at large. Arcangel, though not technically a ‘digital native' himself, points towards a younger generation's proclivity for the immediacyof information access. Whether the artist sees these advents as positive remains to be seen.  

In contrast to nascent technology belatedly harnessed by Arcangel, Matthew Monahan's figure-based works incorporate elements of aestheticized museological display, though one would be mistaken to assume the artist is impassioned about the politics of institutional critique. Working with sculpture and drawing, Monahan collapses both time and space by combining disparate aesthetics characteristic of periods and places ranging from Lascaux to ancient Egypt as well as Greek and Roman antiquity. In the artist's oeuvre, a centuriesold Olmec-like face from Tabasco is curiously at home cast in bronze perched upon a British suit of armour and a slick, contemporary fibreglass plinth. That his beautiful, ancestral-looking figures morph through various eras and locales feels not strange or forced, but akin to walking through the Metropolitan Museum's various wings. Yet Monahan's pastiches are not merely postmodern puzzles: we are not meant to partake in an art historical name game. In fact, perhaps we are meant to consider why we don't feel prompted to think about a work's specific author, and what has happened through time to make these eras and aesthetics collapse into one another. Instead of using aesthetic referents to conjure specific works with authorial presence, the artist implodes and ruptures time: his figures gesture towards the fractured, peripatetic consciousness emblematic of our shared contemporary experience.  

While the experience of such technological and societal progress has been approached variably with fetishism or knee-jerk condemnation, artists such as Michael, Davey, Monahan and Arcangel highlight the necessity of considering whether a new consciousness is summoned by the extensive integration of contemporary information culture into daily living. As artists and writers, a most critical and radical moment takes place when we give ourselves time to suspend ideas before their inevitable evolution and departure into the slipstream of constantly accelerated culture.

# Politics and Entropy in an Exhibition During Duration  

My flight to Manchester was delayed by five hours. Sitting at JFK at midnight, watching concession workers turn off lights and leave the terminal, it all felt strangely normal, part of the routine.  

It was 12 July,just one month after the triumvirate of exhibitions comprising the Venice Biennale, Documenta and Sculpture Projects in Minster opened in Europe, and I was getting used to being late. The forced interlude at the airport started me thinking about the correlation between group shows and the element of time, since the project I was travelling to see, 'll Tempo del Postino', was billed as a durational exhibition. Curated by Hans Ulrich Obrist and Philippe Parreno under the auspices of the Manchester International Festival 2oo7, the project took the form of an opera to pose the question: “What if having an exhibition is not a way to occupy space, but a way to occupy time?' While all exhibitions take time to see and fill time on a calendar, this production appropriated the genre of theatre - complete with proscenium arch - to probe the temporal properties of visual art. Of course, the vital and still ongoing history of contemporary performance - from Marina Abramovic to William Pope L. - has used time quite effectively as a medium, but this was somehow different. 'll Tempo del Postino' was positioned as a 'group exhibition' to be performed in front of an audience, with, I suspect, no residual objects, props or documentary relics to commemorate or commodify the event.  

I arrived in Manchester just a few hours before the event began, jet-lagged  

and disoriented: the perfect state, in a way, to experience Parreno's concept ol 'postman's time, a slow, steady unfolding of episodes delivered directly to you, the exhibition-viewer-cum-audience-member.Most of theparticipating artists - Doug Aitken, Matthew Barney, Tacita Dean, Olafur Eliasson, Liam Gillick, Dominique Gonzalez-Foerster, Douglas Gordon, Carsten Holler, Pierre Huyghe, Koo Jeong-A and Rirkrit Tiravanija - emerged during the early 1990s as part of a generation obsessed with time. Think, for example, of Gordon's 24 Hour Psycho (1993), Dean's Fermsehturm (2001) or Barney's five-part Cremaster Cycle (1994- 2002), which all literally consume time, inviting each viewer to contemplate their slow, inexorable passage. There is also Huyghe's L'Association des Temps Libérés (The Association of Freed Time) established in 1995 as a way of extending the scope of an exhibition from a point of culmination to one of production. Incorporating all the participating artists in Gillick and Parreno's 1995 group show ‘The Moral Maze' at Le Consortium in Dijon, Huyghe's Association was conceived to catalyse new projects and promote other options by sustaining the momentum of the exhibition beyond the set chronology of its presentation. In some ways 'll Tempo del Postino' can be seen as an outgrowth of this initiative. Experimental in form, collaborative and entirely unpredictable, the project offered the artists involved (and by extension, the audience) an alternative means to experience their work. It underscored the inherently theatrical nature of their scenario-based practices, giving them the perfect platform to explore other kinds of narrative structures. In our admittedly hackneyed search for the new - how many new art fairs, biennials and degree shows can we endure? - the programme offered a glimpse of still-unexplored territory.  

Also, to my mind, “1l Tempo del Postino' worked towards dispelling recent October-infused criticism that condemns members of this particular constellation of artists for making merely feel-good' work premised on interactivity and an aestheticized form of exchange. On the contrary. a number of the artists in question deal with specific world events, albeit through metaphor and allusion. Exploiting the durational nature of the project and the history of its site, the participants conjured complex layers of time that oscillated provocatively between past, present and future. References ranged from the local, Post-punk band Joy Division and the IRA's bombing of Manchester in 1996 to the mythos of ancient Egypt and the absurdist tragedy of reality television. As the intended finale of the programme, Gonzalez-Foerster's deadpan dissection of Beethoven's Sixth Symphony (1808) resonated into the future with chilling implications. As the music was being played, the members of the orchestra slowly left the pit, one by one, climbing the stairs with their respective instruments and exiting in the wings. The melody waned until it became indistinguishable. On its own, the piece could easily symbolize community and its loss, but the fact that Gonzalez  

Foerster chose this symphonic passage, which was used in the sci-fi thriller Soylent Green (1973), makes the work all the more frighteningly relevant. The film imagines a future in 2022, when the world's resources have become so scarce as a result of climate change and overpopulation that the government encourages a commercialized form of euthanasia. Broken by deprivation, willing victims are able to art-direct their own deaths with choices of music, chromatic effects and footage of what the natural world once looked like. The film's final revelation that the human cadavers were being used to make processed food seems, in retrospect, an unnecessary sensationalist detail, as we look towards our own bleak 2022. Gonzalez-Foerster brilliantly used music to telescope time backwards and forwards in order to make a compelling. politically conscious statement in the midst of a most experimental endeavour.

# Philip Monk The Split of the Unconscious: 24-Hour Psycho//2003  

Douglas Gordon gained notoriety in 1993 with his 24 Hour Psycho, a DIY work in which he stretched Alfred Hitchcock's 1960 horror-thriller classic Psycho to a twenty-four hour silent video projection. The procedure was simple: he took a commercially available VHS tape of Hitchcock's film and played it through a deck that had the capability to slow play extremely. Gordon's act was no mere novelty appropriation of a pop-cultural artefact; his intervention unleashes powerful effects, but not in ways we demand. For many, Hitchcock's film is symbolized by the iconic footage of its lurid shower scene. The temporal dilation of 24 Hour Psycho works against such symbolic condensation to deny the pleasure of this sight: it takes too long to reach this ‘climax'.  

Gordon's 24-Hour Psycho allows us to scrutinize any particular moment of Hitchcock's Psycho - the actors and the details of the set but not so much the movement of the action - in excruciating slow motion. For instance, the oneminute cut-and-thrust of Janet Leigh's shower scene rolls on for ten banal minutes in 24 Hour Psycho. Although sound is suspended, we don't seem to need the dialogue; as familiar as Hitchcock's story is to us, we recall its narrative from past viewings. The hypertrophy of sight at the expense of sound only reinforces our attention in a way that perhaps is special to film in the first place - it plays to our fascination with the image. Gordon recruits us as guilty accomplices to Hitchcock's camera's moralizing scrutiny, which is made all the more dominant in slow motion. He allows our voyeurism to be indulged freely.  

While we know the film already, and thus can anticipate the action, we are nonetheless frustrated by its delay. Because of the extreme slowness of the drama in Gordon's projection, we seem expelled from the film, never quite registering our sense of time with the plot's. We are always out of synch with the time of the action, which sunders our experience. The past (our memory of Hitchcock's film), our present viewing, and our anticipation of future action, which is too slow to arrive, can never link up. ...]  

If slow motion brings about a change in perception where the unconscious abides, its enduring temporal disruption must also adjust our relations to the host fim in adapting its tempo so drastically. Slow motion so radically distends the narrative construction of the film that another reality imposes itself. Gordon's intervention opens a space of madness to view but, more important, it drastically reshapes our experience of time. The slow motion of 24 Hour Psycho places us in a different temporal universe, where there are no privileged moments. In Gordon's version, the shower scene - the epitome of montage in Psycho - is no more significant than any other. In fact, ‘scene' makes no sense when plot construction dissipates and montage is elided through protraction. Montage is the first victim of slow motion; the naturalistic duration film fictionally promotes is the second. With no privileged instances, 24 Hour Psycho reproduces the double-bind space of no single traumatic event. But it also installs us in the reality in which the psycho strikes in the heart of the everyday, in the banality of what Gilles Deleuze calls the 'any-instant-whatever'! I...]

# Dexter Sinister A Note on the Time//201l  

The time right now is 18 February 2011, 3:34 pm. The time stamped below reports [the exact time of download of the text from Dexter Sinistel's Serving Library website to the reader's computer]. What's going on? For the moment, just disregard the impossible chronology that these two suggest. The two times (of writing and of stamping) could never be precisely alike. Each is a specific point, and no two are ever exactly the same.  

Both originate from the same source though - a networked time server maintained by Apple computer and named, simply, time.apple.com. This external beacon commands not only the official time here on my MacBook, but also synchronizes its local clock with those of Apple users worldwide (laptops, desktops, phones, pods, pads, who-knows-whats-next). It's easy enough to think of time.apple.com as a master clock, but actually it is itself only a network of time machines, a collection of counters comprised of a circuit of servers - computers named time1.apple.com, time2.apple. com, time3, time4, time5, time6 and time7. (the server my MacBook is using right now (time4) is located at 20400 Stevens Creek Blvd. in Cupertino, California, just a few blocks away from Apple's appropriate corporate address, 1 Infinite Loop.)  

All of these servers communicate and agree what time it is at time.apple. com. But this covers only the United States, North and South America, and also must synchronize itself with time.asia.apple.com and time.europe.apple.com to provide a unified answer. All of this close coordination, communicated over distance and time, is governed by Network Time Protocol (NTP), a set of timesharing conventions developed in advance of the World Wide Web in 1985, by University of Delaware professor Dr David Mills. It is one of the oldest and most essential internet protocols.  

NTP runs like a Ponzi scheme. Each layer in the scheime organizes a set of time servers, who both receive the correct time from the layer above (each layer is properly called a 'stratum' in the protocol) and aiso are responsible for dispersing the correct time to computers in the next layer down. At each level, more and more computers are connected.  

The Protocol works by sending a message between two points on a network containing two bits of information: 1. What time it is now at the source, and 2. How long it took to transmit this message to its receiver. Simple addition tells you what time it is on the receiving computer (according to the sender). So, what time is it, precisely? Muitiply this transaction through the layer-cake of millions of computers redundantly organized around the Network Time Protocol, and you'll begin to see a collective consensus emerge that passes for accuracy.  

It turns out that in order to send a message between two points. it's essential that the two points agree on what time it is. otherwise the communication is jumbled. A quick thought gymnastic confirms this. You live in Los Angeles and I live in New York. Your clock tells you it is $2{:}34{\:}{\:}{\:}{\:}.{\mathrm{m}}.$ , and mine tells me it is 2:32 p.m., and you tell me, 'Hey! In one minute the eclipse is going to start, you'd better run outside right now to see it (don't forget your sunglasses)!', and I drop what I'm doing to rush right outside. I see nothing. I'm bummed. 1 write back - 'Nothing doing out there, I must've missed it' You reply, ‘But the eclipse is scheduledfor $2{:}33\mathrm{pm!}$ You probably came in too early!' and I respond, ‘'d already missed it then. It's 2:34 now' 'No you haven't, it's in one minute still!' In the midst of this tedious exchange, surely the moon has passed in front of the sun and everyone in question has missed the party. (For communication, then, perhaps time is more of a medium than a measure.) What a misunderstanding!  

These kinds of mis-steps multiply exponentially over a network, and it should be blindingly clear how critical agreement on the correct time is now, in our intimately connected present. Recently. I've been reading an interview with Michelangelo Pistoletto by Hans Ulrich Obrist. In it, Pistoletto describes his personal solution:  

I think I may have already told you about my two-watch theory. As you can see, I feel the need to wear a watch on each wrist: the one on the right shows yesterday's time and the one on the left shows tomorrow's. We're in between. Time is something we somehow register as a concept of past and future. But in actuality. we find ourselves in a state that isn't quite as technical as we'd expect it to be. Maybe it would all be clearer if we were to tell ourselves that our lives are constantly shuttling between two times. After all, the present results from the balance between two juxtaposed instants. Let's push the image even further: you'll notice that the two watches that I'm wearing belong to different phases of socio- cultural reality. One of them is a gold watch: for ages, common belief had it that nothing was better than gold, thanks to the value lent to it by its stainlessness. The other one is a titanium watch. The value of things has changed, now that other stainless metals have been discovered. This watch is made of the same material used for interstellar voyages. There's another difference between these two watches as well, due to technological adlvances. Therefore there's more than just biological time - our life's time - but technological time as well.  

Let's back out now and look only at the time stamp that appears below [on the PDF of this text downloaded by the reader]. It records the moment this document was last modified, saved and exported as a PDF In other words, the time stamp is the publication date. This time was handed down through the cascade of networked time servers described before, but where did the original 'time' come from and how was it set?  

In the top tier of the Network Time Protocol, one computer is hooked directly to one extraordinarily accurate clock. Currently. this is the Caesium Fountain Atomic Clock running at the National Institutes of Standards and Technology laboratory in Boulder, Colorado, named NIST-F1. Atomic clocks rely on the fuzzed logics of quantum mechanics. As electrons orbit the nucleus of an atom, rather than winding down gradually in energy like a pendulum, they lose energy in discrete chunks, at which point the circling electron jumps down to the next closest orbit, producing something like a very, very, very faint 'click'. These steps are consistent for any one atom, and this quantity is its resonant frequency. The resonant frequency of the caesium atom, for example, is 9,192,631,770 hertz (or cycles per second). And in a twist of recursive identity, the NIST has set the official standard for one second to be equal to 9,192,631,770 vibrations of the caesium atom. The United States' primary time and frequency standard is set then by NIST-F1 and is accurate to within one second every 60 million years.  

So you can more or less assume that the time stamped rather accurately reflects when this documentwas released.But,it includes a bit more specificity than the typical publication date as might appear in the running foot in a journal like this.Why?  

We might all agree that [the date stamped] identifies one specific point in time, a forever unrepeatable instant that disappears as quickly as we can stamp it. The eighteenth-century empirical philospher David Hume would most certainly concur. Working at the centre of the Scottish Enlightenment, Hume described his particular, uncompromised version of empiricism. He asserted that everything we know or can know about the world arrives to us only through directsensory experience.Nothingexistsoutside ofourown practicalencounter with it as we move through the world. Further, he suggests that any sensible experience is composed of a single indivisible sensory building block which is marked by the limits of our perception. If you can't experience it, it does not exist. Hume most certainly was an essentialist.  

WhileAmerican empirical philosopher WilliamJamesbuilt many of hisideas on Hume's scaffolds, he also rejected Hume's reductive essentialism. In James' second-wave or 'radical' empiricism, although knowledge about the world still arrived through direct experience, he dismissed what he called Hume's'atomism', or the idea that this experience was ever-assembled from smaller elementary blocks. James was, instead, a 'Gestaltist'- a totalist who, although insisting on the incrementalism of building the world piece by piece, also understood that any one experience was whole and complete in and of itself, neither equivalent to nor reducible into any constituent bits.  

So if we could query Hume on our time stamp, he would identify it as one irreducible moment of publication. However, ask William James and he says that this point is really more of a duation. Time is like that - both point and duration. This is how it can bend and warp. A week, a second, a season: all are equal and discrete, but none are the same. The present can be any number of lengths, from a single vibration of a caesium atom to the life cycle of a publication.  

Some nine months ago, I came across the image Contatore by Italian artist Alighiero Boetti (1940-94). In this collaged print, an edition of 123, Boetti catches a moment, pauses it and extends the transition into one everlasting tick: an impossibly long now. The work is described by his long-time companion Annemarie Sauzeau-Boetti, in her 2002 biography Shaman-Showman:  

Among his early works, Contatore (Meter, 1967) signals the beginning of Alighiero's obsession with the passing of time, its rhythms, its markers. At first it was a game, which gave numerous occasions for jubilation. When the mileometer of the old Fiat 500, completely worn out, was about to reach the hundred or thousand mark, rolling from 799 to 800, or better still, from 99999 to 100000, he never missed the great event, and celebrated with a great, wild yell that would have embarassed any puritan trave!ling with him.  

Then one day he depicted one of these transitions of seven digits. It is a multiple, a product of design, intentionally cool, in which the frisson of pleasure does not pass through the artist's hand, but rather through his mind. Alighiero would probably have celebrated the arrival of the year 2oo0 with his eyes fixed on the faceof a quartzwatch.  

Let's return finally to the time at the end of the first sentence of the present text (18 February 2011, $3{:}34\mathtt{p.m.}$ ) and also, to the stamped date. We'll agree that the difference between these two points describes a length, but how can we measure it? Our metre-stick won't do. Time is nothing until it is counted, and for that we need a clock.  

In From Sundials to Atomic Clocks (Understanding Time and Frequency), James Jepsersen and Jane Fitz-Randolph describe keeping time as only a matter of counting the ticks of any regular, cyclical action. They also describe the constituent parts of a 'clock' (or more properly a 'clock system'. First, you need a device that can produce a periodic phenomenon (for example, a pendulum). this is the resonator. Next you'll have to sustain the periodic motion by feeding it power (for example, the wound coil of a mechanical wristwatch). Finally you need a means for counting, accumulating and displaying the ticks of the resonator. This

is the display (for example, a watch face and arms). Together, these three pieces define a clock. But of course to be useful, to measure a length, our clock must be running. With all of these conditions met, we arrive at an answer for the duration between writing the first sentence and publishing this final text: [calculation of the days, hours and minutes between the two times]. And this delivers one final paradox: time can only be measured by moving. [...]

# Hans Belting The Theatre of 1llusion//2000  

Movie theatres are built as theatres of illusion. But in Hiroshi Sugimoto's equally disturbing and beautiful photographs, such interiors are reintroduced as metaphors. They remind us of our own vision, which is confined in a permanent theatre of illusion. Our attention is drawn to a screen that represents the archetypal image we welcome as the epiphanic window of the world. The window is bathed in a blinding light, which seems to enter the dark room from the outside, though in fact it is projected from within. But the screen is empty, and thus qualifies either as the everything of all possible images or as their nothingness, as vehicles of illusion. If we want to grasp what is happening in front of our eyes, or in the back of our mind, the everything that we are eager to see similarly results in the nothing we can trust. Sugimoto's Theatre series [begun in 1978] therefore strangely resembles the living camera obscura which we are ourselves.  

It seems that the photographs record empty rooms where nothing happens, and yet they are supposed to picture a film during the entire length of its projection on the screen. The result, however, is not meant to work in a naive sense, and in fact cannot work in any documentary or indexical way, but produces an unexpected deception. The technique Sugimoto adopts has been described many times. He takes great efforts to use the projection time of a feature film (its length) as the exposure time of his camera. The screen, where the pictures appear and disappear, in the end remains empty as it cannot keep the many pictures it attracts. Motion creates emptiness in the photograph. The site of the pictures that have been shown on its silvery surface reflects nothing but a trace of the light they carried with them when crossing the dark interior. [...1  

# I1  

Time and space, which we love to see as opposites, in Sugimoto's view are interwoven such that they reveal an abyss of riddles. The visible structure of the interiors is as simple as their semantic complexity seems inexhaustible. Their vision invites a contemplation that we can only reach after allowing their illusion, as a guide to mental conception, to work on us. Our initiation already begins with the interplay between subject matter and its technical medium: the medium stages the interior in a manner we cannot see without the photographs. Photography's indexicality (the record of something which has been and therefore survives as a faithful trace) is subtly dissolved or, better, used as the indexicality of the imaginary or the mirror of our conceptions. Photography's ontology.as Andre Bazin wanted it in the days of high modernism, no longer convinces us when photographs reveal what we cannot see. In Sugimoto's series(which use the emptied evidence of an invisible film sequence) two media are involved in a playful and yet philosophical way. One medium (film) is blended into another (photography). It is not only that we see an image of a site of images where the images are cancelled. The site we see is not part of the film, and the film we do not see (has the camera seen it?) has dissolved in its own time unit while illuminating the site.  

The camera uses the same position as the projector, high above the heads of the audience and thus keeping a similar distance to the people's view in the cinema. Camera and projector have technical eyes, which register the theatre space differently from the way the people do. While competing for the same position in the cinema, the two nevertheless produce a totally different result, which confirms the difference of the two respective media. Ail the same, the result has an abstract quality. against the film experience or the cinema theatre experience of the audience. The work of the camera mirrors the procedure of the projector without paying notice to the illusion that the film generates as its very essence. The difference between technical fiction and human imagination thereby reveals itself. The ritual of the medium whose blind eye waits to be filled with the gaze of the spectator only becomes meaningful as a result of the anthropological use of the image.  

We habitually think that photography is about space, as film is about time. This distinction has been confirmed and also disproved by Sugimoto. The motion image disappears in the photographic image, which easily wins over the younger medium. This result is contrary to our expectation, which depends on the linear idea of medial history and progress. Sugimoto offers us a further paradox, while turning the well known ilusion, inborn in the speed of a film that deceives our slow eyes with a virtual movement, into the opposite illusion of a stillness. resulting from an abundance of motion pictures. The sleeping time in a physical space (the cinema interior) cancels the linear time in a filmic event. The remembered time of a photograph survives the acting (or running) time of a film. We not only see the photographic memory of an interior but also the equally. but paradoxically pictured, memory of a film whose existence on the screen we are forced to believe in, as we cannot actually see it. The diversity of the Theatres, which we only grasp in the series and not in the single picture, adds weight to their physical and local existence, while the anonymity of the empty screen emphasizes the ubiquity and instability of the film, which as a medium of temporality is not part of our living space. The asymmetry familiar to us from the permanent site of a theatre and the impermanent event of a theatre performance, increases in our common filmic experience when we see an outdoor world while sitting in an indoor space. This spatial inconsistency is in a strange way inverted when Sugimoto reveals the indoor experience with the light of film pictures not born in this space. The space is bathed in the dim light that it receives in the film sequence, that is in time.  

#  

Sugimoto's Theatres, however, need more than just description. We realize that we are confronted with a kind of allegory that addresses philosophical issues such as time and space. Their mutual dependence involves both the realm of illusion and the territory of mere conception, as against our usual visual experience. Sugimoto practises visual philosophy when he uses the title Time Exposed for the cycle of seascapes in an outdoor exhibition where they changed further under the impact of weather. But the same title could be given to the Theatres. Time Exposed makes a double reference to exposure and exposition: exposure, as a photographic technique, here turns into the meaning of an exhibition of time (or of photographs, i.e. of art) but also may adopt the rhetorical meaning of the exposition of an argument. Time Exposed at the same time closes time against any simple notion. It could be said that time is nothing but actual time, which anyway does not apply to any photograph in the world. But Gilles Deleuze has taken great care to tell us that, even in the case of cinema, time image and motion image are separate phenomena.  

Time Exposed in our case can only mean that time is encoded in the Theatres in many layers whose classification, in any neat sense, is bound to fail. We may ask ourselves whether time, the time unit of a film, has become invisible, or whether it has adopted a transformation of its visibility. The time event, as the film is, dissolves into a time space, where many sediments of time remembered are buried in a simultaneous view. A photograph of the usual kind arrests time or cuts out a time fraction, never to happen again. Sugimoto seems to have done something similar, which yet secretly indicates a stern opposition to any photographer's confidence in grasping time. He carefully measures a time unit whose measuring principle, however, remains inaccessible to us. We have to believe that his exposure time coincides with the length of a given film. The particular relation between the time of a film and the time of memory. in a building, in our case remains obscure. What we see can last forever, and in fact does so in Sugimoto's photographs. which protect the timeiess calm of what we see from every attempt to interrupt or to end it.  

It is almost an arbitrary act when Sugimoto, as we know, at a certain point handles the shutter so as to produce the photograph. He thus fixes floating time. in a paradoxical way. forever. The photograph, so to speak, testifies against its own traditional evidence as a medium and introduces a startling new time experience. The utmost precision with which Sugimoto measures the time quantity taken from the film is nothing but a solemn gesture. The ritual he applies guarantees a concept that escapes our visual control. The usual indexicality of photography has adopted a new meaning which as yet needs (or defies?) a proper theory.  

# VI  

[...J The time that is enshrined in a photograph (and which is not our time, as we look at it), resembles the aura of a past time which has imprinted the presence of physical places we can visit. The time illusion of the film testifies against the time memory inherent in a photograph. The flm is meant to produce the illusion of living images (images in real time) whereas the traditional image insisted on absent time or time lost. Sugimoto therefore restores the time experience of the film to the time experience in a photograph. when he emphasizes the time memory linked to a particular place against the ephemeral time of filmic narration. His exposure time, as it were, is real fiction, as it uses a unit of filmic time for the evidence of photographic time. Sugimoto's input-time in using the shutter performs (and mirrors) the output-time of films of varying length. But in fact neither the one nor the other can be verified such as to be tested against each other.  

The riddle of time buried in Sugimoto's photographs is not easily exhausted. There is the faked time in the story of the invisible film. which is produced by the very different time built in as the length of the film, and which again differs from the repetitive time of its possible projections on many possible screens. There is, further, the time when Sugimoto produced his photograph (which, in a most ambivalent way, for the first time becomes visible for us). There is, finally, the time when we look at one of his prints, or when we possibly again look at it in another moment of our life. But time is not only illusion. In fact, the accumulated illusion necessarily meets our resistance. Our life experience includes time experience as the vital creation of our mind. What is most uncertain is forcefully ascertained by our self-experience and world-experience. We all live in the same time, but our life-time differs among ourselves and produces different images of time in us.  

# VIII  

In a kind of epilogue, an old time concept of Zen Buddhism may serve as an invitation to enjoy both the playful side and the depth in Sugimoto's conceptual photography. The epilogue however must not be understood as the explanation of what Sugimoto is doing and thinking. Despite the fact that he is Japanese, I have no intention of linking him to a given Buddhist tradition, and in fact never discussed this view with him. The time philosophy of Zen is best represented by Dogen Zenji, a famous teacher of Japanese Zen, whose writings dating from the thirteenth century have been taken up by contemporary artists such as Nam June Paik. [...]  

In Dogen Zenji's Shobogenzo (The Eye and Treasury of the True Law), being' and ‘time' are explained as synonymous, which contradicts our familiar distinction of time and life as opposites. 'Time', we read, 'is existence or being', and vice versa. 'The shape of a Buddha statue is time.' Dogen Zenji in fact rejects 'any difference between your mind and time ... We, ourselves, are time', instead of being victims of time passing. 'Do not think that being is a stable concept', which can be contrasted with the instability of time. Time is always passing but there is also 'an aspect which is not passing. To realize this is to comprehend being' The empty screen, which in Sugimoto's photographs offers a kind of resting place for our searching gaze, may be understood as the allegory both of time and of being. The film of our life which is pictured on a screen, in ourselves, by its very meaning also transcends the empty activity of time.  

In the preceding chapter of this text, Dogen Zenji addresses the ‘Ancient Mirror' (Kokyo) as the emblem of the world and of its pictures which reside in our mind. Again, the screen, with its consummation of pictures, in a surprising way relates to the view the Zen monk develops in his book. \*The ancient mirror and the Buddhas are one and the same; outside the mirror there are no Buddhas' to be seen, and vice versa. 'The one who sees and the one who is seen, the reflecting one and the reflected one are one and the same' The author, to be sure, is discussing the practice of meditation, which he considers an end in itself and not as a help to reach Enlightment. Zen training, he concludes, amounts to the polishing of one's personal mirror. Nevertheless, Dogen Zenji would not confine his teaching to the religious domain only. He addressed a world of illusion in which self-training is a practice of secular and permanent enlightment.  

Imagination and the world of appearances remain an inseparable unity. Mind and eye are mutually each other.' Whatever appears in the world is being reflected in our mind. We live in a theatre of illusion in which the screen (or the mirror) of our attention reflects the nothing and the everything which happens in (our?) time. Photography and film, in a way. are duplicates of our own mirror. but they catch the opposite ends of image experience, in their resting and in their fleeting time. In Western thinking. they are often linked to the antagonism of life and death. In the light of Eastern thinking. 'being' transcends this easy opposition. Sugimoto's visual philosophy, in a most subtle way, uses two modern media against thestereotypes ofmodern thinking.

# Rosalind Krauss Clock Time//2011  

Christian Marclay is a hold-out against the eclipse of the medium. This requires that he embed his work in what I elsewhere term a 'technical support'.! (If traditional art required artisanal supports of various kinds - canvas for oil painting. plaster and wax for bronze casting, light-sensitive emulsion for photography - contemporary art makes use of technical supports - commercial or industrial products - to which it then makes recursive reference, in the manner of modernist art's reflex of self-criticism.) For Marclay. this technical support is commercial sound film, from which he has extrapolated that process into pure synchronicity. Earlier, this was to be found in his focus on synch-sound in the use of mostly Hollywood films for his masterful Video Quartet (2002).  

An anthology of film clips joined top-to-bottom, Video Quartet runs four loops of clips from commercial sound films on four DVD screens, spaced out along a wall. Sometimes the synchrony is visual. as circular forms (phonograph turntable. roulette wheel, trumpet rim) piay simultaneously across the visual field. At other times, Marclay seems intent to contrast sound and silence, a historical divide over which sound jumped in 1929 to turn movies into talkies. At such points, it is the very era of silence that Marclay ambitiously wants his viewers to see. How to do this is not obvious. but one electric moment presents cockroaches spilling onto a piano keyboard and scurrying over it (soundlessly. of course).  

The Clock (2010), Christian Marclay's latest work, is also a compilation of film clips -- fragments of commercial films, joined end-to-end. Projected in video on  

142//DURING  

a wall as a segmented twelve by twenty-one foot image, The Clock selects fragments in which the dials of wristwatches and large free-standing clocks figure prominently. Doubling this temporal focus, The Clock stretches over twenty-four hours of audience and projected time.?  

Marclay has turned to pure synchronicity as the undeniable support for post1929 film and thus for cinema itself. This is easy to see in Video Quartet's exercise in synch sound. In The Clock, we confront what must be called another of the underlying conditions of film - synch time: which is to say, projection at twentyfour frames a second, synchronized with the psycho-physiological facts of optics, as the retinal production of the after-image from one frame's visual stimulation slides invisibly into the next. The illusion of movement overrides the film frame's appearance, creating the visual slippage we call the 'movies'.  

This explanation by way of the after-image, called the 'phi-effect', has become controversial of late, making the synchronization between projected frames and the physiological optics of viewing problematic. Recent research on the 'intermittent reperfusion' on the brain supports the reality of the 'phi-effect', however, even in the relatively smooth unrolling of video.?  

The Clock's synch-time joins audience and screen in the manner of what film scholars call interpellation, after Louis Althusser's ‘Ideological State Apparatuses', as the subject 'recognizes' himself as the addressee of a command, thus identifying with the commander himself; for Laura Mulvey, classical narrative cinema positions female viewers to identify with the male protagonist. In film, this recognition, or identification, causes the viewing subject to suffer a passivity that results in her being woven into the weft of the film's movement, as the swivelling camera or shot/reaction-shot editing lifts the viewer imaginatively off her seat to join the sides of the projected actors. At the very outset of cinematic editing, Vsevold Pudovkin conserved scarce film stock in the post-revolutionary Soviet Union by interspersing pre-recorded scenes with cut-aways to an actor's expressionless face, thereby creating the illusion of someone acting out pity, horror, anguish. These cut-aways perform another act of interpellation, synchronizing observers in the audience with the temporal unfolding of events in the film.  

Marclay's The Clock exploits the cut-away as its 'plot' unfolds through the sights of the dials displayed on clocks and watches, and the reaction shots of horrified characters in the film clips Marclay anthologizes into his own work. It doesn't take long before members of the audience glance at their watches and realize that the precise moment displayed on the screen matches the moment registered on thei1 own wrists. Marclay's plot gears itself into that of the film clips he uses, in which characters anticipate a catastrophe that will be unleashed at a certain moment: a bomb's explosion, a missile's strike. We recognize Sean Connery, Charlie Chaplin,  

Steve McQueen, Gregory Peck, but unlike the temporal arcs that produce the plots of Dial M for Murder, or Strangers on a Train, the suspense unreeling inside the screen is not synchronized with the suspense unfolding in the viewer's real time. In another twist on this, Annette Michelson has characterized Michael Snow's Wavelength (1967) as the very distillation of suspense:  

And as the camera continues to move steadily forward, building a tension that grows in direct ratio to the reduction of the field, we recognize, with some surprise, those horizons as defining the contours of narrative, of that narrative form animated by distended temporality. turning upon cognition, towards revelation. Waiting for an issue, we are 'suspended' towards resolution.4  

Snow's resistance to editing, except for several cuts and splices, allows for an extended zoom to pass through space, ignoring the body that crashes to the floor - the presumed object of the film's 'suspense'. The near continuity of the cinematic zoom enforces the viewer's perception that Wavelength can only continue for the length of a 16mm reel of film, synchronizing the 'suspense' time on the screen with his own perceptual experience, in his seat.  

On all of these fronts, The Clock explores synchronous time, a tour de force in the 'invention' of a technical support and, consequently. a new medium.  

Post-structuralism, in the form of Jacques Derrida's Speech and Phenomena, a critique of Husserl's own critique of structuralism in his Logical Investigarions, focuses on the 'now' effect of Husserl's dismissal of structural linguistics with its division of subjective experience into consciousness and representational sign. He quotes Husserl as saying, "consciousness? means nothing other than the possibility of the self-presence of the present in the living present', and consequentiy:  

In inward speech I communicate nothing to myself because there is no need of it. The existence of mental acts does not haveto be indicated because it is immediately present to the subject in the present moment.  

Derrida insists on this effect of 'self-presence'. this indivisible 'now-effect', as pure fiction. or myth. He writes, “It is a spatial or mechanical metaphor. an inherited metaphysical concept.'s  

The Clock's simultaneity. enacted by the synchronous gearing of reel time into real time, flirts with Husserl's desire for the self-present instant, the revelation of self-presence in the 'now-effect. Derrida's critique of the idea of synchrony is explored as well in 'The Double Session', where he emphasizes the line in Mallarme's essay 'Mimique', characterizing the mime's perforrmance as 'the false appearance of the presenr', which Derrida will celebrate as overthrowing the idea of  

144//DURING  

synchronic self-presence, and consequently of the very specificity of an object-initself6 It is the strength of those contemporary artists who want to explore the dimensions of a specific medium, in itself that they put Derrida's strictures behind them. Marclay manages this by turning to suspense as the extended dilation of the 'now effect', transforming the reel time of film into the real time of waiting.

# Yve-Alain Bois Slow (Fast) Modern/ /2009  

A friend of Mondrian's once asked him to suggest a title for a new little magazine' he was planning to publish. 'Stop!', the painter proposed, because everything goes too fast'.1 This is wholly in character, at least for the Mondrian of 1921-31, a period during which one of his aesthetic goals in painting was to freeze time, to reach utter 'repose', obtain a static 'universal' equilibrium in which everything would be neutralized, every force cancelled out by its opposite. (From 1932 on, on the contrary, starting with his adoption of the'double line', he reversed course and sought to exalt dynamism in his work, complaining that the canvases of his so-called ‘classical' neo-plastic period did not have enough jazz' in them.)  

Stop or, at least, slow down. Very few forces within contemporary life ever demand that we do so. And when they do, it's only for a very short time: just enough for us to notice the change in pace and then go on with our busy existences. Filmmakers long ago ascertained the efficacy of slow motion as a form of emphasis. They make use of it much as a writer places a word in italics. Right from the start, even in the most experimental forms of cinema, slow motion sequences have always been brief accents interrupting a staccato continuum of discontinuous shots. (Films shot in real time remain scarce and continue to be perceived as bordering on the sadistic. Long takes have become an ever rarer treat. More and more films are conceived as extended trailers.) Barely two minutes of slow motion are assigned to the funeral march in Rene Clair's 1924 Entr'acte (one of the longest such film segments ever): less than a minute for the childrens' procession after their pillow fight in Jean Vigo's 1933 Zéro de conduite (Zero for Conduct). The exception would be Warhol's Empire, but there slow motion is perversely unnoticeable. Adding insult to injury, the eight-hour single take film in which (almost) nothing ever happens was shot at twenty-four images per second and projected at sixteen. And even Warhol allowed his viewers to leave their seat. (How many ever stayed for the whole projection? Perhaps on a dare?) As for the countless videos exploiting the spectacular/sentimental effect of the superslow (e.g. the slo-rmo sublime - or is it a form of kitsch? - of Bill Viola's works. with their New Age overtones), we are rarely subjected to them for extended periods. We glance at them in passing, hopping from one gallery to the next in a city's art district, paying an occasional visit to the media wing of a museum, racing through the hubbub of a Biennale. Designers of television ads know this well: slow is excellent, but only in small doses. Speed is a necessary corollary to the monitor's flatness, to the binary reduction of anything visual to a common denominator: the digit of the pixel.  

Can an artwork rebel against the fast flow of art tourism? Can an artwork force us to alter our viewing habits? I would like to make a plea for a venerable practice declared dead every twenty years or so during the past century: namely. painting. Certainly any picture is vulnerable to the mad rush of the average museum-goer, encouraged in his or her haste by a commercial strategy aimed at the infinite growth of ticket sales. And certainly. there too, the rules of the game can undergo change in exceptional circumstances, to very powerful effect.  

Leo Steinberg once told me that, during World War II, the treasures of the National Gallery in London had been moved to a secret warehouse in the countryside but that, responding to complaints on the part of a frustrated public. the powers that be decided to dig out and bring back to London one painting at a time. Each work remained on view, in splendid solitude, for a full month. It is then and there, no doubt, that Steinberg. determined to make the most of the slim pickings that were on hand, acquired his phenomenal visual prowess. More recently Tj. Clark submitted himself to the daily routine of looking at two paintings by Poussin during a six-month period. offering us. in the formidable  

# 146//DURING  

diary of his quotidian observations, the most exacting confirmation that patience pays off. Read Clark's remarks about the miniature figures in Landscape with a Man Killed by a Snake: on how, barely visible, they continue to register once they have been seen.2 Or this, about a particular passage of Landscape with a Calm:  

Poussin is among other things the painter of the unnoticeable: and the ethics of this has to do with precisely not using the unnoticeable as a place in the picture where mere illusionisim can stop and a demonstration of power or facility take over ... The hillside is insignificant. and that's what has to be painted.3  

It is evident that in order to notice Poussin's Lilliputian creatures or to end up musing about the 'accurate likeness of the unnoticeable' in his work, Clark had to decelerate his gaze. A self-imposed constraint, just as Steinberg's was in part prompted by historical circumstances.  

I dubbed such feats of prolonged attention exceptions. But what if slowness were to become the rule? What if the standard limit of one-minute-maximum per canvas that is forced upon us in today's museums were to become its monstrousviolation?  

Poussin seems a good place to start. And here another anecdote comes to mind. In 1994, stunned by my friend Rosalind Krauss's admission that she had never really liked Poussin, I organized a visit with her to the mammoth retrospective of the painter then being held at the Grand Palais in Paris. Upon entering the first gallery, we found that it was very dimly lit and inferred that the weak lighting had something to do with the fact that the museum was closed to the public. The second gallery, by contrast, was bustling with a crowd of photographers and TV reporters whose blinding projectors were flooding the paintings with light. Thank God1', one could have exclaimed, but we did not and. instead, quickly bypassed this anomalously bright room. Our eyes had already adjusted to the subdued lighting: the harsh, incandescent rays cast on Poussin's canvases by the technical crew felt like an act of aggression.  

For several hours we wandered through the exhibition, looking at each painting at considerably greater length than we could have during an ordinary day when the museum was open. Little by little we came to understand that our anomalous pace had little to do with the privileged circumstances of our visit. Rather, it was Poussin's works themselves, for once seen in the faint (mostly natural) light for which they had been painted, that had forced us to accommodate our gaze: to experience fully the amazing subtlety by which the artist modulates speed in his paintings, harnessing various degrees of perceptual velocity to narrative ends. We realized, that is, that Poussin constructs his scenes in depth with an acute sense of how our eyes react to variations of hues and values. More often than not he sets up two extreme speeds - very fast and very slow - with few gradations in between. We are first struck in a flash by an assortment of planes of saturated colour (usually bright, usually primary). Then, once this first pictorial assault has subsided, we come gradually to appreciate the gentle invitation of the darker browns and greens filling the rest of the picture, from which emerge. s!owly decanted, first one, then another, then yet another figure; and it is this last character, surfacing from the dissipating darkness, who sometimes emerges as the key to solving the riddle of the obscure tale the painting purports to tell. It would have been no exaggeration to say that my faith in Poussin was redoubled if it hadn't already reached a pinnacle; but, more importantly. my companion to0 had become a convert. A week after the visit I found out, upon reading a review of the show, that the dimming of the lights at the Grand Palais had nothing to do with our being there on a day of closure. On the contrary. it had been a deliberate choice on the part of the curator, Pierre Rosenberg. for which he was routinely panned in the press. I sent him a fan letter.  

The point of this anecdote? Some paintings demand that we slow down. They put us in an either/or situation: either you proceed at the speed they require, 01 you'll see nothing that is specific to the works in question, nothing specific to their medium. Sure, you might perceive the images they contain, but at such a low level of differentiation that a photograph would do just as well as a painting. Nothing much happens if you slow down in front of an art book's glossy page or a screen on which is projected the pixelated reproduction of, say. an 'ultimate' painting by Ad Reinhardt.  

How do some paintings deflect the ever-growing demand for speedy consumption? What forces you to go at snail's pace when looking at a small genre scene by Edouard Vuillard, a still life by Giorgio Morandi, a monochrome wax painting by Brice Marden, a pencilled grid by Agnes Martin, or certain Rothkos? (Of course you can ignore the injunction: it's a free country, you are free to proceed as you please. But zoom by these works and you'll get very little out of them. Swines like pearls too, but what a waste.) In what way do such paintings post a speed limit sign upon their surface? Do they have something in common? Poussin provides a clue: they incorporate the duration of perception into their aesthetic structure. Low hue and value contrasts dictate subdued lighting conditions - a 1965 black' Reinhardt under floodlight is nothing much more than a black square - and weak light, in turn, dictates slow adjustments on the part of our gaze. Rothko always turned out the lights whenever he ventured in a gallery or a museum showing his work. (They were inevitably put back on by the dealer or curator as soon as he had left the premises.) Distance too, or, rather, the lack thereof, plays an important role: all of the works mentioned entreat us to come close (and this is true even of Rothkos). One has to be able to sniff the wax of a Marden in order to perceive the glacial pulse of the underlayers and feel their effect on the unnamable epidermic colour; one must be on the verge of touching the matte surface of a Vuillard in order to hear its murmur; one must notice the many inflections of Martin's pencilled lines in order to witness the transformation they enact of a cloud into a grid.4 I have suggested that some paintings demand that we slow down. As a matter of fact, most do, at least implicitly. (This makes the rare exceptions all the more striking: Steinberg long ago noted that Kenneth Noland's pictures of the late sixties - those elongated horizontal canvases striped edge to edge with bands of colours - were the fastest he knew; and one could, of course, add many Warhols from the same period.)5 But perhaps it would be better to say that some paintings explicitly force us to decelerate. In this day and age, I consider them among the strongest agents of resistance against the growing desensitization of human subjectivity promoted by the so-called digital revolution. It is not by chance that their singularity, long ignored, has now come to the attention of conservators and prompted historians to seek the advice of such colleagues whom they used to ignore. These works are fragile, but their very fragility is one of the very few monkey wrenches left at our disposal for purposes of defending a sensibility and sensitivity to the fine-grained.

# Jorge Luis Borges A New Refutation of Time//1944-46  

[...J A word about the title. I am not unaware that it is an example of the monster termed by the logicians contradictio in adjecto, because stating that a refutation of time is new (or old) attributes to it a predicate of temporal nature which establishes the very notion the subject would destroy. I leave it as is, however, so that its slight mockery may prove that I do not exaggerate the importance of these verbal games. Besides, our language is so saturated and animated by time that it is quite possible there is not one statement in these pages which in some way does not demand or invoke the idea of time. I...]  

I deny. in an elevated number of instances, the successive; I deny. in an elevated number of instances, the contemporary as well. The lover who thinks, 'While I was so happy, thinking of the fidelity of my love, she was deceiving me', deceives himseif: if every state we experience is absolute, such happiness was not contemporary to the betrayal; the discovery of that betrayal is another state, which cannot modify the 'previous' ones, though it can modify their recollection. The misfortune of today is no more real than the happiness of the past. I shall seek a more concrete example. In the first part of August, 1824, Captain Isidore Su rez, at the head of a squadron of Peruvian hussars, decided the victory of Junin; in the first part of August 1824, De Quincey published a diatribe against Wilhelm Meisters Lehrjahre; these events were not contemporary (they are now), since the two men died - one in the city of Montevideo, the other in Edinburgh - without knowing anything about each other .. Each moment is autonomous. Neither vengeance nor pardon nor prisons nor even oblivion can modify the invulnerable past. To me, hope and fear seem no less vain, for they always refer to future events: that is, to events that will not happen to us, who are the minutely detailed present. I am told that the present, the specious present of the psychologists, lasts from a few seconds to a minute fraction of a second; that can be the duration of the history of the universe. In other words, there is no such history. just as a man has no life; not even one of his nights exists; each moment we live exists, but not their imaginary combination. The universe, the sum of ail things, is a collection no less ideal than that of all the horses Shakespeare dreamt of - one, many, none? - between 1592 and 1594. I add: if time is a mental process, how can thousands of men - or even two different men - share it?  

The argument [above], interrupted and encumbered with illustrations, may seem intricate. I shall seek a more direct method. Let us consider a life in whose course there is an abundance of repetitions: mine, for example. I never pass in front of the Recoleta without remembering that my father, my grandparents and great grandparents are buried there, just as I shall be some day; then I remember that I have remembered the same thing an untold number of times already; I cannot walk through the suburbs in the solitude of the night without thinking that the night pleases us because it suppresses idle details, just as our memory does; I cannot lament the loss of a love or a friendship without meditating that one loses only what one really never had; every time I cross one of the street corners of the southern part of the city, I think of you, Helen; every time the wind brings me the smell of eucalyptus, I think of Adrogu in my childhood; every time I remember the ninety-first fragment of Heraclitus, “You shall not go down twice to the same river', I admire its dialectical dexterity, because the ease with which we accept the first meaning ('The river is different') clandestinely imposes upon us the second (I am different') and grants us the illusion of having invented it; every time I hear a Germanophile vituperate the Yiddish language, I reflect that Yiddish is, after all, a German dialect, scarcely coloured by the language of the Holy Spirit These tautologies (and others I leave in silence) make up my entire life. Of course, they are repeated imprecisely; there are differences of emphasis, temperature, light and general physiological condition. I suspect, however, that the number of circumstantial variants is not infinite: we can postulate, in the mind of an individual (or of two individuals who do not know of each other but in whom the same process works), two identical moments. Once this identity is postulated, one may ask: Are not these identical moments the same? Is not one single repeated term sufficient to break down and confuse the series of time? Do not the fervent readers who surrender themselves to Shakespeare become, literally, Shakespeare? I... l  

Chuang Tzu dreamt that he was a butterfly, and during that dream he was not Chuang Tzu, but a butterfly. How, with space and self abolished, shall we link those moments to his waking moments and to the feudal period of Chinese history? This does not mean that we shall never know, even in an approximate fashion, the date of that dream; it means that the chronological fixing of an event, of an event in the universe, is alien and external to it. In China the dream of Chuang Tzu is proverbial; let us imagine that of its almost infinite readers, one dreams that he is a butterfly and then dreams that he is Chuang Tzu. Let us imagine that, by a not impossible stroke of chance, this dream reproduces point for point the master's. Once this identity is postulated, it is fitting to ask: Are not these moments which coincide one and the same? Is not one repeated term sufficient to break down and confuse the history of the world, to denounce that there is no such history? [...]

# Boris Groys Comrades of Time//2009  

I...I When we begin to question our projects, to doubt or reformulate them, the present, the contemporary, becomes important, even central for us. This is because the contemporary is actually constituted by doubt, hesitation, uncertainty, indecision - by the need for prolonged reflection, for a delay. We want to postpone our decisions and actions in order to have more time for analysis, reflection, and consideration. And that is precisely what the contemporary is - a prolonged, even potentially infinite period of delay. Soren Kierkegaard famously asked what it would mean to be a contemporary of Christ, to which his answer was: It would mean to hesitate in accepting Christ as Saviour.! The acceptance of Christianity necessarily leaves Christ in the past. In fact, Descartes already defined the present as a time of doubt - of doubt that is expected to eventually open a future full of clear and distinct, evident thoughts.  

Now, one can argue that we are at this historical moment in precisely such a situation, because ours is a time in which we reconsider - not abandon, not reject, but analyse and reconsider - the modern projects. [...↓ One can say that we now live in a time of indecision, of delay - a boring time. Now, Martin Heidegger has interpreted boredom precisely as a precondition for our ability to experience the presence of the present - to experience the world as a whole by being bored equally by all its aspects, by not being captivated by this specific goal or that one, such as was the case in the context of the modern projects.2  

Hesitation with regard to the modern projects mainly has to do with a growing disbelief in their promises. Classical modernity believed in the ability of the future to realize the promises of past and present - even after the death of God, even after the loss of faith in the immortality of the soul. The notion of a permanent art collection says it all: archive, library and museum promised secular permanency, a material infinitude that substituted the religious promise of resurrection and eternal life. During the period of modernity, the “body of work' replaced the soul as the potentially immortal part of the Self. Foucault famously called such modern sites in which time was accumulated rather than simply being lost, heterotopias.3 Politically, we can speak about modern utopias as post-historical spaces of accumulated time, in which the finiteness of the present was seen as being potentially compensated for by the infinite time of the realized project: that of an artwork, or a political utopia. [...]  

But today, this promise of an infinite future holding the results of our work has lost its plausibility. Museums have become the sites of temporary exhibitions rather than spaces for permanent collections. The future is ever newly planned - the permanent change of cultural trends and fashions makes any promise of a stable future for an artwork or a political project improbable. And the past is also permanently rewritten - names and events appear, disappear, reappear and disappear again. The present has ceased to be a point of transition from the past to the future, becoming instead a site of the permanent rewriting of both past and future - of constant proliferations of historical narratives beyond any individual grasp or control. The only thing that we can be certain about in our present is that these historical narratives will proliferate tomorrow as they are proliferating now - and that we will react to them with the same sense of disbelief. Today, we are stuck in the present as it reproduces itself without leading to any future. We simply lose our time, without being able to invest it securely. to accumulate it, whether utopically or heterotopically. The loss of the infinite historical perspective generates the phenomenon of unproductive, wasted time. However, one can also interpret this wasted time more positively, as excessive time - as time that attests to our life as pure being-in-time, beyond its use within the framework of modern economic and political projects.  

Now, if we look at the current art scene, it seems to me that a certain kind of so-called time-based art best reflects this contemporary condition. It does so because it thematizes the non-productive, wasted, non-historical, excessive time - a suspended time, stehende Zeit, to use a Heideggerian notion. It captures and demonstrates activities that take place in time, but do not lead to the creation of any definite product. Even if these activities do lead to such a product, they are presented as being separated from their result, as not completely invested in the product, absorbed by it. We find exemplifications of excessive time, that has not been completely absorbed by the historical process.  

As an example let us consider the animation by Francis Alys, Song for Lupita (1998). In this work, we find an activity with no beginning and no end, no definite result or product: a woman pouring water from one vessel to another, and then back. We are confronted with a pure and repetitive ritual of wasting time - a secular ritual beyond any claim of magical power, beyond any religious tradition or cultural convention. I...]  

Alys characterizes such a wasted, non-teleological time that does not lead to any result, any endpoint, any climax, as the time of rehearsal. An example he offers - his video Politics of Rehearsal (2007). which centres on a striptease rehearsal - is in some sense a rehearsal of a rehearsal, in so far as the sexual desire provoked by the striptease remains unfulfilled even in the case of a 'true' striptease. In the video, the rehearsal is accompanied by a commentary by the artist, who interprets the scenario as the model of modernity, always leaving its promise unfulfilled. For the artist, the time of modernity is the time of permanent modernization, never really achieving its goals of becoming truly moderm and never satisfying the desire that it has provoked. In this sense, the process of modernization begins to be seen as wasted, excessive time that can and should be documented - precisely because it never led to any real result. I...]  

But it is precisely because such a wasted, suspended, non-historical time cannot be accumuiated and absorbed by its product that it can be repeated - impersonally and potentially infinitely. Already Nietzsche has stated that the only possibility for imagining the infinite after the death of God, after the end of transcendence, is to be found in the eternal return of the same. And Georges Bataille thematized the repetitive excess of time, the unproductive waste of time, as the only possibility of escape from the modern ideology of progress. Certainly. both Nietzsche and Bataille perceived repetition as something naturally given. But in his book Difference and Repetition (1968) Gilles Deleuze speaks of literal repetition as being radically artificial and, in this sense, in conflict with everything natural, living, changing, and developing. including natural law and moral law.4 Hence, practising literal repetition can be seen as initiating a rupture in the continuity of life by creating a non-historical excess of time through art. And this is the point at which art can indeed become truly contemporary.  

Here I would like to mobilize a somewhat different meaning of the word 'contemporary'. To be con-temporary does not necessarily mean to be present, to be here-and-now; it means to be 'with time' rather than 'in time'. 'Con-temporary' in German is zeitgenossisch. As Genosse means 'comrade', to be con-temporary - zeitgenossisch - can thus be understood as being a 'comrade of time' - as collaborating with time. helping time when it has problems, when it has difficulties. And under the conditions of our contemporary product-oriented civilization, time does indeed have problems when it is perceived as being unproductive, wasted, meaningless. Such unproductive time is excluded from historical narratives, endangered by the prospect of complete erasure. This is precisely the moment when time-based art can help time, to collaborate, become a comrade of time - because time-based art is, in fact, art-based time.  

It is the rather traditional artworks (paintings, statues, and so forth) that can be understood as being time-based, because they are made with the expectation that they will have time -- even a lot of time, if they are to be included in museums or in important private collections. But time-based art is not based on time as a solid foundation, as a guaranteed perspective; rather, time-based art documents time that is in danger of being lost as a result of its unproductive character - a character of pure life, or, as Giorgio Agamben would put it, “bare life' But this change in the relationship between art and time also changes the temporality of art itself. Art ceases to be present, to create the effect of presence - but it also ceases to be 'in the present', understood as the uniqueness of the here-and-now.

Rather, art begins to document a repetitive, indefinite, maybe even infinite present - a present that was always already there, and can be prolonged into the indefinite future. [...]

# Amelia GroomSisyphus//2012  

Why is it that everyone remembers his punishment but no one remembers his crime?  

After violating the goddess Xenia's laws of hospitality, Sisyphus seduced his niece Tyro, only for Tyro to slay the children she bore by him when she discovered that Sisyphus was planning on eventually using them to dethrone her father, Sisyphus' brother and rival. The implacable Zeus then ordered the god of death, Thanatos, to take Sisyphus to the underworld, but Sisyphus tricked Thanatos and chained him up, resulting in disaster on land because nobody could die. When Sisyphus was finally sentenced to execution, he tricked his wife by demanding that upon his death she throw his naked body in the city square to prove her love for him. He then used this as a sign of her disrespect for him, in order to be granted access to the upper world again - ostensibly in order to publicly scold her for not giving him a proper funeral, as a loving wife should.  

He was a scandal!  

Finally condemned to push an immense boulder up a hill, only to watch it roll straight back down, ad infinitum, Sisyphus would famously become Albert  

Camus' absurdist hero, whose 'whole being is exerted towards accomplishing nothing'. and whom we 'must imagine as happy.' Emphasizing the notion of repetition for its own sake, Camus was in fact repeating ideas expressed previously by the Japanese philosopher Kuki Shuzo. Fourteen years before the publication of Camus' Myth of Sisyphus, Kuki had given a lecture in France, where he declared that we should imagine Sisyphus, with his 'firm and certain will of always beginning again', as happy. “He perpetually renews his effort. Is there suffering, is there punishment, in this act? l do not understand', said Kuki, 'Sisyphus should be happy, being capable of a perpetual repetition of dissatisfaction.'2  

A (happy?) slinky on a treadmill [see ‘Epic - Slinky on a Treadmill' on the YouTube website (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v $\mapsto=$ 711bZ_pLusQ)].Asingle gesture, dispossessed of its capacity to move forwards, repeated for three and a half minutes, and viewed on YouTube three and a half million times (as of October 2012). Unlike the Fordist conveyor belt that divided up time and labour into achievable units, each completion here folds back on itself. The immediately anthropomorphized slinky is propelled onwards by its own momentum, but each motion is cancelled out by the reiteration of the same. This is the paradox of the Modernist notion of 'progress': with the indefinite postponement of closure, it demands that we strive for it but never reach it.  

Moishe Postone has described what she terms the ‘treadmill effect' that occurs under capitalism, paradoxically, with its demand for accumulation. Because there is always more to acquire, the arrow of time loops back on itself. The treadmill makes us run in place, so step-by-step becomes step-on-top-ofstep. But can self-consciously redundant gestures of replication also work to resist processes of objectification, commodification and accumuiation?  

Bea Fremderman's two-minute-thirteen-second video loop, Kafka Office (2012), presents us with a generic, grey space of regulated and enforced productivity, where nothing passes besides time itself - with the cyclical passage of day to night, on repeat. This sort of exaggerated, staged inefficacy asks if we can find a way to proceed without progressing; if we can use tautology to resist teleology. This sort of exaggerated, staged inefficacy asks if we can find a way to proceed without progressing; if we can use tautology to resist teleology.  

Meaningless work is obviously the most important and significant art form today. (Waiter De Maria, 1960)  

Before he was punished. Sisyphus had fought progression. He attempted to disrupt the linear transferal of the throne, he halted the human passage from life to death, and he rapaciously refused his own divinely dictated fate. As the only  

156//DURING  

possible retribution, his existence would be condemned to eternal redundancy. where he can never be done with what he has nevertheless already finished. Refusing to meet his end, he was to be punished with endlessness - action without purpose, perpetually unconsummated process, where achievement wouid be impossible, since the completion of each gesture would roll back to its own beginning. But perhaps this punishment only amounted to the highest reward, and purposive purposelessness is an ideal towards which we can all aspire? Kuki Shuzo in 1928: It is the enterprise that interests us, not the goal.

# Michel Serres Science and the Humanities: The Case of Turner//1997  

I...] How much leisure time have we lost, of late and long ago, in fruitless discussions about the laws of history and of events, debates that opposed two loquacious armies: those who fight for causality and against 'chance', and those who, considering Cleopatra's nose, argue that circumstances win out over regularities, even over the long term? As comedy would have it, even political positions have been determined in such debates, debates invalidated by the hard sciences with a stroke of the pen almost a century ago, unbeknownst to thedebaters.  

Unpredictable, then, and yet somehow determined - can historical time from now on dowithout modeis drawnfrom chaostheory,itself born of theorems as old as those of Hadamard and Poincare? Suddenly, the old discussions about the laws of evolution or the logic of history become obsolete. Our initial hesitations over the retrospectivejudgement of Turner's canvases derivefrom these discoveries:what Henri Bergson called ‘the retrograde movement of the true' accompanies this obvious fact: that the time of certain things - and certainly the time of history -- cannot be foreseen, just as tempests cannot be foreseen, but that this time can be calculated deterministically once the event itself has happened. When we consider time as running downstream, the mathematical rationality of calculation and the observed evolution of most physical processes give the victory to Cleopatra's nose. When we look upstream at time as past, the victory goes to the proponents of causes and reasons. How can we not see that the history of humanity and of groups evolves chaotically, in today's theoretical sense of the term?  

How can we not feel that time percolates rather than flows? Far from flowing in laminar and continuous lines, like a well-behaved river under a bridge. upstream to downstream, time descends, turns back on itself, stops, starts, bifurcates ten times, divides and blends, caught up in whirlpools and countercurrents, hesitant, aleatory,uncertain and fluctuating, multiplied into a thousand beds like the Yukon River. Sometimes time passes, sometimes not; but when it passes, it does so as if through a colander. Colander comes from the Latin colare, to filter, and this filter or percolator supplies the best model for the flow of time. Sudden explosions, quick crises, periods of stagnant boredom, burdensome or foolish regressions and long blockages, but also rigorous linkages and suddenly accelerated progress, meet and blend in scientific time as in the intimacy of the soul, in meteorology as in river basins. Would we have understood such obvious facts without the theory of percolation? This theory rediscovers the oldest of intuitions, confirmed by linguistics: in Indo-European languages, the word time [temps] goes back to the aleatory mixtures of the temperaments, of intemperate weather, of tempests and temperature. If the time of a planet and the time of a river can have such subtlety, what about historical time? We can say, at the very least, that history is chaotic, that it percolates. Simultaneously unpredictable and deterministic, its course blends all paces. [..]

# Michel Serres and Bruno Latour Conversations on Science, Culture and Time//1995  

Michel Serres I...] Whether it's the scientific hypothesis, on the one hand, which we have called the hypothesis of excellence, or, on the other hand, that of historicism, the two suppose that time develops in a linear fashion - that is, that there really is an enormous distance, more than a score of centuries, between Lucretius and today's physics. Whether this time is cumulative, continuous or interrupted, it always remains linear.  

Bruno Latour Because of succession. Or successions of revolutions, as described by the epistemologists or even Foucault.  

Serres There you are. But time is in reality somewhat more complicated than that. You no doubt are familiar with chaos theory, which says that disorder occurring in nature can be explained, or reordered, by means of fractal attractors.  

Latour Yes. According to this, chance is nonetheless determined, and disorder is produced by an underlying order.  

Serres Exactly. But in this, order as such is harder to perceive, and customary determinism has a slightly different appearance. Time does not always flow according to a line (my first intuition of this is in my book on Leibniz), nor according to a plan but, rather, according to an extraordinarily complex mixture, as though it reflected stopping points, ruptures, deep wells, chirmneys of thunderous acceleration, rendings, gaps - all sown at random, at least in a visible disorder.  

Serres and Latour//Conversations on Science, Culture and Time//161  

Thus the development of history truly resembles what chaos theory describes. Once you understand this, it's not hard to accept that time doesn't always develop according to a line, and thus things that are very close can exist in culture, but the line makes them appear very distant from one another. Or, on the other hand, that there are things that seem very close that, in fact, are very distant from one another. Lucretius and the modern theory of fluids are considered as two places separated by an immense distance, whereas I see them as in the same neighbourhood.  

In order to explain these two perceptions we must, in fact, clarify the theory of time. The classical theory is that of the line, continuous or interrupted, while mine would be more chaotic. Time flows in an extraordinarily complex, unexpected, complicated way...  

Latour So it is not you who travel through time but, rather, the elements that become close in this chaotic time?  

Serres Certainly. Time is paradoxical; it folds or twists; it is as various as the dance of flames in a brazier - here interrupted, there vertical, mobile and unexpected.  

The French language. in its wisdom, uses the same word for weather and time, le temps. At a profound level they are the same thing. Meteorological weather, predictable and unpredictable, will no doubt some day be explainable by complicated notions of fluctuations, strange attractors ... Someday we will perhaps understand that historical time is even more complicated.  

Latour In any case, it doesn't 'pass'.  

Serres Yes, it passes, and also it doesn't pass. We must bring the word pass closer to passoir - 'sieve'. Time doesn't flow; it percolates. This means precisely that it passes and doesn't pass. I'm very fond of the theory of percolation, which tells us things that are evident, concrete, decisive and new about space and time.  

In Latin the verb colare, the origin of the French verb couler, 'to flow', means precisely 'to filter'. In a filter one flux passes through, while another does not.  

Latour But it doesn't pass in the form of a fluid. It's not a fluid.  

Serres Who knows?  

Latour It is perhaps turbulent, but not linear ..  

Serres 'Sous le pont Mirabeau coule la Seine ..' [Beneath the Mirabeau Bridge flows. the Seine ...] - thus flows classical linear time. But Apollinaire, who had  

162//AFTER  

never ever navigated, at least on fresh water, hadn't studied the Seine enough. He hadn't noticed the countercurrents or the turbulences. Yes, time flows like the Seine. if one observes it well. All the water that passes beneath the Mirabeau Bridge will not necessarily flow out into the English Channel; many little trickles turm back toward Charenton or upstream.  

Latour They don't flow like parallel trickles.  

Serres It's not always laminar. The usual theory supposes time to be always and everywhere laminar. With geometrically rigid and measurable distances - at least constant. Someday it will be said that that is eternity! It is neither true nor possible. No, time flows in a turbulent and chaotic manner; it percolates. All of our difficulties with the theory of history come from the fact that we think of time in this inadequate and naive way.  

Latour All the theologians agree with you.  

Serres Really? Maybe that's why I so greatly admire Charles Peguy's work.  

Latour His Clio? [Clio: Dialogue between History and the Pagan Soul.]  

Serres Yes, Clio. In it one sees, from the evidence, a time that is completely turbulent. From this you understand how Lucretius can be as close to us as our neighbour and, conversely, how contemporary things can become very distant.  

Latour You have a topologically bizarre space as your reference for understanding time.  

Serres There is in Lucretius a global theory of turbulence, which can make that time really understandable. His physics seems to me truly very advanced. Along with the contemporary sciences, it holds out the hope of a chaotic theory of time.  

Latour Everyone has heard you say this, and no one believes you.  

Serres Nonetheless, fairly simple mathematics can also easily bring one to such an idea. A certain theory of numbers reorders their sequence in such a way that near neighbours become very distant, while, inversely, distant numbers come closer. It's fun, instructive, and has a strong influence on intuition. Once you've entered into this kind of thinking you realize how much all of what we've said about time up till now abusively simplifies things.  

More intuitively, this time can be schematized by a kind of crumpling, a multiple, foldable diversity. If you think about it for two minutes, this intuition is clearer than one that imposes a constant distance between moving objects, and it explains more.  

Everyone is amazed that after 1935 the Nazis, in the most scientifically and culturally advanced country. adopted the most archaic behavior. But we are always simultaneously making gestures that are archaic, modern and futuristic. Earlier I took the example of a car, which can be dated from several eras; every historical era is likewise multi-temporal, simultaneously drawing from the obsolete, the contemporary and the futuristic. An object, a circumstance, is thus polychronic. multitemporal, and reveals a time that is gathered together. with multiple pleats.  

Latour You are explaining here a sentence I was going to ask you to explain from your book Le Tiers-lnstruit, which speaks of precisely these nonmetricai diversities: 'l have always used a process of abstraction like this, which could be called topological, and whose principle consists of describing non-metrical diversities - in this case, the network.  

Serres Yes. lf you take a handkerchief and spread it out in order to iron it, you can see in it certain fixed distances and proximities. if you sketch a circle in one area, you can mark out nearby points and measure far-off distances. Then take the same handkerchief and crumple it. by putting it in your pocket. Two distant points suddenly are close, even superimposed. if, further, you tear it in certain places, two points that were close can become very distant. This science of nearness and rifts is called topology, while the science of stable and well-defined distances is called metrical geometry.  

Classical time is related to geometry. having nothing to do with space, as Bergson pointed out all too briefiy. but with metrics. On the contrary, take your inspiration from topology. and perhaps you will discover the rigidity of those proximities and distances you consider arbitrary. And their simplicity. in the literal sense of the word pli [fold]: it's simply the difference between topology (the handkerchief is folded, crumpled, shredded) and geometry (the same fabric is ironed out flat).  

As we experience time - as much in our inner senses as extermally in nature, asmuch asletempsof history asletempsofweather-it resemblesthiscrumpled version much more than the flat, overly simplified one.  

Admittedly. we need the latter for measurements. but why extrapolate from it a general theory of time? People usually confuse time and the measurement.of time, which is a metrical reading on a straight line.  

# 164//AFTER  

Latour So mathematics, which is your model, is not metrical?  

Serres It can easily become so. Sketch on the handkerchief some perpendicular networks, like Cartesian coordinates, and you will define the distances. But, if you fold it, the distance from Madrid to Paris could suddenly be wiped out, while, on the other hand, the distance from Vincennes to Colombes could become infinite. No, time does not flow as people think it does. The time we spontaneously use imitates the succession of natural integers.  

Latour So, it's never a case of your inventing the proximities, in your opinion? Whereas for a modernist, time passes, falls behind him, is obsolete.  

Serres Archaisms can always be found among us, while Lucretius, in some instances, is right on top of things, as they say.  

Let me tell you a true story. Have you ever heard how some brothers, in their seventies, were grouped around their father for a funeral vigil, weeping for a dead man aged thirty or less? He had been a mountain guide and, following an accident, had disappeared into a crevasse in the high mountains. He reappeared more than a half-century later, deposited in the valley by the glacier, perfectly conserved, youthful, from the depths of the cold. His children, having grown old, prepare to bury a body that is still young. That's the source of this alpine scene, which is precisely an anachronism, and is admittedly rare here, but often observed between a writer and his critics. Art, beauty and profound thought preserve youth even better than a glacier!  

Admire how, on the problem of time, an unpretentious true story agrees with recent science, to produce good philosophy.  

Latour It's precisely this biographical and philosophical bizarreness that sets you apart from modernists and makes you so difficult to read.  

Serres We are archaic in three-fourths of our actions. Few people and even fewer thoughts are completely congruent with the date of their times. I...]

# Bruno Latour We Have Never Been Modern//1993  

I... I No one has ever been modern. Modernity has never begun. There has never been a modern world. The use of the past perfect tense is important here, for it is a matter of a retrospective sentiment, of a re-reading of our history. I am not saying that we are entering a new era; on the contrary we no longer have to continue the headlong flight of the post-post-modernists; we, are no longer obliged to cling to the avant-garde of the avant-garde: we no longer seek to be even cleverer, even more critical, even deeper into the 'era of suspicion'. No, instead we discover that we have never begun to enter the modern era. [...]  

We do have a future and a past, but the future takes the form of a circle expanding in all directions, and the past is not surpassed but revisited, repeated. surrounded, protected, recombined, reinterpreted and reshuffled. Elements that appear remote as we follow the spiral may turn out to be quite nearby if we compare loops. Conversely, elements that are quite contemporary, if we judge by the line, become quite remote if we traverse a spoke. Such a temporality does not oblige us to use the labels ‘archaic', or ‘advanced', since every cohort of contemporary elements may bring together elements from all times. In such a framework, our actions are recognized at last as polytemporal.  

I may use an electric drill, but I also use a hammer. The former is thirty-five years old, the latter hundreds of thousands. Will you see me as a DlY expert 'of contrasts', because I mix up gestures from different times? On the contrary: show me an activity that is homogeneous from the point of view of the moderm time. Some of my genes are 500 million years old, others are 3 million, others 100.000 years, and my habits range in age from a few days to several thousand years. [...]  

Peoples without history' were invented by those who thought theirs was radically new (Jack Goody. The Logic of Writing and the Organization of Society. 1986). In practice, the former innovate constantly; the latter are forced to pass and repass indefinitely through the same rituals of revolutions. epistemological breaks and quarrel of the Classics against the Moderns. One is not born traditional; one chooses to become traditional by constant innovation. The idea of an identical repetition of the past and that of a radical rupture with the past are two symmetrical results of a single conception of time. We cannot return to the past, to tradition, to repetition, because these great immobile domains are the inverted image of the earth that is no longer promised to us today: progress. permanent revolution, modernization, forward flight. [...]  

We have never moved either forward or backward. We have always actively sorted out elements belonging to different times. We can still sort. It is this sorting that makes the times, not the times that make the sorting. Modernism -- like its anti- and postmodern corollaries - was only the provisional result of a selection made by a small number of agents in the name of all. If there are more of us who regain the capacity to do our own sorting of the elements that belong to our time, we will rediscover the freedom of movement that modernism denied us - a freedom that, in fact, we have never really lost. We are not emerging from an obscure past that confused natures and cultures in order to arrive at a future in which the two poles will finally separate cleanly owing to the continual revolution of the present. We have never plunged into a homogenous and planetary flow arriving either from the future or from the depths of time. Modernization has never occurred. [...]

# Franco 'Bifo' Berardi After the Future//2011  

I...] The future is not an obvious concept, but a cultural construction and projection. For the people of the Middle Ages, living in the sphere of a theological culture, perfection was placed in the past, in the time when God created the universe and humankind. Therefore, historical existence takes the shape of the Fall, the abandonment and forgetting of original perfection and unity.  

The rise of the myth of the future is rooted in modern capitalism, in the experience of expansion of the economy and knowledge. The idea that the future will be better than the present is not a natural idea, but the imaginary effect of the peculiarity of the bourgeois production model. Since its beginning, since the discovery of the new continent and the rewriting of the maps of the world, modernity has been defined by an amplification of the very limits of the world, and the peculiarity of capitalist economy resides exactly in the accumulation of the surplus value that results in the constant enhancement of the spheres of material goods and knowledge.  

In the second part of the nineteenth century, and in the first part of the twentieth, the myth of the future reached its peak, becoming something more than an implicit belief: it was a true faith, based on the concept of 'progress', the ideological translation of the reality of economic growth. Political action was reframed in the light of this faith in the progressive future. Liberalism and social democracy, nationalism and communism, and anarchism itself, all the different families of modern political theory share a common certainty: notwithstanding the darkness of the present, the future will be bright. [.. ]  

Moderns are those who live time as the sphere of a progress towards perfection, or at least towards improvement, enrichment and rightness. Since the turning point of the century that trusted the future - which I like to place in 1977 - humankind has abandoned this illusion. [I..]

# Hito Steyerl In Free Fall: A Thought Experiment on Vertical Perspective//2011  

Imagine you are falling. But there is no ground.  

Many contemporary philosophers have pointed out that the present moment is distinguished by a prevailing condition of groundlessness. We cannot assume any stable ground on which to base metaphysical claims or foundational political myths. At best, we are faced with temporary. contingent, and partial attempts at grounding. But if there is no stable ground available for our social lives and philosophical aspirations, the consequence must be a permanent, or at least intermittent state of free fall for subjects and objects alike. But why don't we notice?  

Paradoxically. while you are falling. you will probably feel as if you are floating - or not even moving at all. Falling is relational - if there is nothing to fall toward, you may not even be aware that you're falling. If there is no ground. gravity might be low and you'll feel weightless. Objects will stay suspended if you let go of them. Whole societies around you may be falling just as you are. And it may actually feel like perfect stasis - as if history and time have ended and you can't even remember that time ever moved forward. [...] Our sense of spatial and temporal orientation has changed dramatically in recent years, prompted by  

168//AFTER  

new technologies of surveillance, tracking and targeting. One of the symptoms of this transformation is the growing importance of aerial views: overviews, Google Map views, satellite views. We are growing increasingly accustomed to what used to be called a God's-eye view. On the other hand, we also notice the decreasing importance of a paradigm of visuality that long dominated our vision: linear perspective. Iits stable and single point of view is being supplemented (and often replaced) by multiple perspectives, overlapping windows, distorted flight lines and divergent vanishing points. [...]  

Our traditional sense of orientation - and, with it, modern concepts of time and space - are based on a stable line: the horizon line. Its stability hinges on the stability of an observer, who is thought to be located on a ground of sorts, a shoreline, a boat -- a ground that can be imagined as stable, even if in fact it is not.  

The horizon line was an extremely important element in navigation. it defined the limits of communication and understanding. Beyond the horizon, there was only muteness and silence. I...]  

The use of the horizon to calculate position gave seafarers a sense of orientation, thus also enabling colonialism and the spread of a capitalist global market, but also became an important tool for the construction of the optical paradigms that came to define modernity, the most important paradigm being that of so-called linear perspective. [...]  

Linear perspective is based on several decisive negations. First, the curvature of the earth is typically disregarded. The horizon is conceived as an abstract flat line upon which the points on any horizontal plane converge. Additionally. as Erwin Panofsky argued, the construction of linear perspective deciares the view of a one-eyed and immobile spectator as a norm - and this view is itself assumed to be natural, scientific and objective. Thus, linear perspective is based on an abstraction, and does not correspond to any subjective perception. Instead, it computes a mathematical, flattened, infinite, continuous and homogenous space, and declares it to be reality. Linear perspective creates the illusion of a quasi-natural view to the 'outside', as if the image plane was a window opening onto the 'real' world. This is also the literal meaning of the Latin perspectiva: to see through.  

This space defined by linear perspective is calculable, navigable and predictable. It allows the calculation of future risk. which can be anticipated and therefore managed. As a consequence, linear perspective not only transforms space, but also introduces the notion of a linear time, which allows mathematical prediction, and with it, linear progress. This is the second, temporal meaning of perspective: a view onto a calculable future. As Walter Benjamin argued, time can become just as homogenous and empty as space.2 And for all these calculations to operate, we must necessarily assume an observer standing on a stable ground looking out toward a vanishing point on a flat, and actually quite artificial, horizon.  

Needless to say, this reinvention of the subject, time and space was an additional tool kit for enabling Western dominance, and the dominance of its concepts - as well as for redefining standards of representation, time and space. [...]  

This so-called scientific world view helped set standards for marking people as other, thus legitimizing their conquest or the domination over them.  

On the other hand, linear perspective aiso carries the seeds of its own downfall. Its scientific allure and objectivist attitude established a universal claim for representation. a link to veracity that undermined particularistic worldviews, even if halfheartedly and belatedly. It thus became a hostage to the truth it had so confidently proclaimed. And a deep suspicion was planted alongside its claims for veracity from its inception. I.. ]  

Turner experimented with moving perspectives early on. Legend has it that he had himself tied to the mast of a ship crossing from Dover to Calais, explicitly to watch the horizon change. In 1843 or 1844, he stuck his head out of the window of a moving train for exactly nine minutes, the result of which was a painting called Rain. Steam and Speed - The Great Westerm Railway (1844). in it, linear perspective dissolves into the background. There is no resolution, no vanishing point, and no clear view to any past or future. I...]  

With the twentieth century, the further dismantling of linear perspective in a variety of areas began to take hold. Cinema supplements photography with the articulation of different temporal perspectives. Montage becomes a perfect device for destabilizing the observer's perspective and breaking down linear time. Painting abandons representation to a large extent and demolishes linear perspective in cubism, coliage and different types of abstraction. Time and space are reimagined through quantum physics and the theory of relativity. while perception is reorganized by warfare, advertisement and the conveyor belt. I...]  

As linear perspective began to tumble down with the sinking bodies of slaves thrown into the ocean, for many people today the simulated grounds of aerial imagery provide an illusionary tool of orientation in a condition in which the horizons have, in fact, been shattered. Time is out of joint and we no longer know whether we are objects or subjects as we spiral down in an imperceptible free fall.3  

But if we accept the multiplication and delinearization of horizons and perspectives, the new tools of vision may also serve to express, and even alter. the contemporary conditions of disruption and disorientation. Recent 3-D animation  technoiogies  incorporate multiple perspectives,  which  are deliberately manipulated to create multifocal and non-linear imagery.\* Cinematic space is twisted in any way imaginable, organized around heterogeneous, curved and collaged perspectives. The tyranny of the photographic lens, cursed by the promise of its indexical relation to reality, has given way to hyperreal representations - not of space as it is, but of space as we can make it - for better or worse. There is no need for expensive renderings: a simple green screen collage yields impossible cubist perspectives and implausible concatenations of times and spaces alike.  

Finally. cinema has caught up with the representational freedoms of painting, and structural and experimental film. As it merges with graphic design practices, drawing and collage, cinema has gained independence from the prescribed focal dimensions that have normalized and limited the realm of its vision. While it could be argued that montage was the first step towards a liberation from cinematic linear perspective - and was for this reason ambivalent for most of its existence - only now can new and different sorts of spatial vision be created. Similar things can be said about multi-screen projections, which create a dynamic viewing space, dispersing perspective and possible points of view. The viewer is no longer unified by such a gaze, but is rather dissociated and overwhelmed, drafted into the production of content. None of these projection spaces suppose a single unified horizon.

# Elizabeth Grosz Becoming .. An Introduction//1999  

Time . gives nothing to see. It is at the very least the element of invisibility itself It withdraws whatever could be given to be seen. It itself withdraws from visibility.One can only be blind to time,t the essential disappearance of time,even as nevertheless. in a certain manner, nothing appears that does not require and take time. - Jacques Derrida, Given Time: 1. Counterfeit Money  

Time is one of the assumed yet irreducible terms of all discourse, knowledge and social practice. Yet it is rarely analyzed or self-consciously discussed in its own terms. It tends to function as a silent accompaniment, a shadowy implication underlying, contextualizing and eventually undoing all knowledges and practices without being their explicit object of analysis or speculation. Time has a quality of intangibility. a fleeting half-life, emitting its durationparticles only in the passing or transformation of objects and events, thus erasing itself as such while it opens itself to movement and change. It has an evanescence, a fleeting or shimmering, highly precarious 'identity' that resists concretization, indication or direct representation. Time is more intangible than any other 'thing', less able to be grasped conceptually or psychically. This is perhaps why Derrida, above, wants to grant it the status of the invisible, the scotomized: that to which we are blind. [...]  

History, arguably the discipline most closely associated with time within the humanities, is notable for its failure to address the question of the ontological, epistemic and political status of time. Its privileged objects of reflection, historical events and processes, those that occurred in the past and retain some traces, some residue, in the present and the future, raise serious ontological and epistemic and thus political and ethical. questions, methodological questions that the disciple has not even tried to address. Time and becoming remain unreflected and undertheorized, except in rare and isolated cases, in the history of Western thought.  

Within the natural sciences there seems to be a large investment in concepts of time and space, investments that are not entirely the same as, or completely different from, those in the humanities. Classical physics, for example, has tended, with few exceptions, to regard the ‘arrow of time' as irrelevant to understanding the nature of time, and has tended to be committed to an idea of temporal reversibility, the physical and temporal indiscernibility of past, present and future. The biologically oriented sciences, primarily. have insisted that time  

172//AFTER  

does have an irreducible directionality and that the history and temporal placement of an organism or biological process have major explanatory relevance in assessing the current and future states of that organism or process. Biological explanation requires that temporally irreversible relations are constitutive of the organism in its particularity. Yet although physics and biology do take time as one of the relevant vectors in their respective investigations, either discussion remains highly abstract or time tends to be taken as of peripheral interest to its major preoccupations - the study of matter (in the case of physics) or the study of life (in the case of biology). Time is understood as the neutral 'medium' in which matter and life are framed rather than as a dynamic force in their framing. I...]  

An uncanny convergence is evident in the ways in which time is conceived in the writings of Darwin, Nietzsche, Bergson and Deleuze, a point of resonance in otherwise disparate projects and methods. [...]  

Each in his own way affirms time as an open-ended and fundamentally active force - a materializing if not material - force whose movements and operations have an inherent element of surprise, unpredictability or newness. It is significant that this future-oriented temporality brings with it the centrality of the concept of chance, of what is in principle unpredictable, in the work of each thinker; and chance, the concept of the random or the unpredictable, is of the essence of a time that is not regulated by causality and determination but unfolds with its own rhythms and logic, its own enigmas and impetus. Chance is that which signals the openness of the future, its relative connection to but also its relative freedom from the past, the possibilities of paths of development, temporal trajectories uncontained by the present. Chance here cannot be regarded as indetermination, as the absence of a cause (as it is represented in classical philosophy) rather, it is the excess, superfluity, of causes, the profusion of causes, which no longer produces singular or even complex effects but generates events, which have a temporal continuity quite separate from that of their 'causes'. I...]  

Only if we open ourselves up to a time in which the future plays a structuring role in the value and effectivity of the past and present can we revel in the indeterminacy, the becoming. of time itself.  

Such a rethinking of concepts of time involves reconceptualizing many of the most central concerns of epistemology, ontology, ethics and politics, for each, in its own way, contains assumptions about temporality and futurity that need to be questioned and moved beyond. What, for example, would politics be like if it were not directed to the attainment of certain goals, the coming to fruition of ideals or plans, but rather required a certain abandonment of goals? What would a science or a body of knowledge be like, which instead of invoking the criteria of repeatability and the guarantee of outcomes required for industrial and technological efficiency, sought endlessly to experiment without drawing conclusions, without seeking law-like regularities? Would such a science approximate the singularity anduniqueness ofart orintuition?Cou!d experimental techniques themselves be derived experimentally, artistically, inventively, nonteleologically? What would an ethics be like, which instead of seeking a mode of equivalence, a mode of reciprocity or calculation, sought to baseitself on absolute generosity, absolute gift, expenditure without return, a pure propulsion into a future that does not rebound with echoes of an exchange dictated by the past? These questions, when posed acutely and intensely enough, when posed in a timely, which is perhaps to say, in Nietzschean, terms, an untimely fashion, may provoke new modes of knowing, being, responding and initiating.

# Emily Apter Women's Time//2010  

[...I Moyra Davey's photographs. particularly those included in her book Long Life Cool White, invite theorization through themes of archive, memory, fetish, the loss and possession of part objects, and domestic interiority. But for my purposes, the work's greatest interest lies in its use of the demode - with that term understood in its full panoply of significations as the out of fashion, the outmoded and the untimely.  

The notion of the untimely ( Unzeitgemassig) is taken, of course, from Friedrich Nietzsche's Unzeitgemaisse Betrachtungen (Untimely Meditations). sometimes translated as Unfashionable (or Unmodern) Observations. [...] Nietzschean efforts to untime academic historicism, particularly those notions of Zeitgeist that anchor the archaeological and political dating of history, take their place, paradoxically enough, in a long history of antiphilosophy. Premier philosophers of the ‘untimely' include Karl Marx, Sigmund Freud, Henri Bergson, Martin Heidegger and Walter Benjamin ( who, in the words of Karl-Heinz Barck, invented 'a new mode of writing history - a rebours [against the grain] in a non-linear way. as it were - and in the "white heat"of actual experience').' Each theorist disabled the time signatures that assign tempo to the capitalist temporality underwriting labour. production, profit and social calculation. I...]  

174//AFTER  

Davey's photographs and writings expose the stigmatization of period within aesthetic ideology. According to a familiar formula, 'Timelessness', the guarantor of modernism whose trademarks comprise geometric abstraction, whiteness, minimalism, withheld ornament, formalist universalism, autonomy and the psychically shattering experience of Jeztzeit or the ‘now-time', is proverbially pitted against ‘Period'. Period, or period style, is what is most anathema to modernists: period rooms, photographic albums, vintage fashion, all are freighted with associations of historicism, cultural particularism, planned obsolescence, decadence and the outmoded. Despite the common recognition that modernism has become a style, especially in the current era of recycled mid-century modernism in art, design and critical theory. timelessness and period, like temporality and history more generally, continue to be played off against each other aspolar opposites.  

Davey's Long Life Cool White offers relief from this stalemate. Timelessness and period fuse in images of modernist icons framed as outmoded media technologies. Vinyl records, speakers, receivers, turntables, household appliances - all reference that moment when modern gadgets veer into obsolescence. They are still viable machines, not fully ripe for the dumpster or the Museum of Jurassic Technology, but they wear their programmed archaism on their sleeve. They offer. as it were, a glimpse of the pre-conscious period. This precocious periodicity is stored in Davey's inventory of untimely objects, which fall in and out of modernist sequence. I..]  

Davey's circular light fixtures, repeated squares of microwave and blocky fridge, and serial rectangles of radio consoles, defer to timeless modernism, but in her images this classic modernism is undercut by a period aura almost Old Masterish in its lighting effects: the radiant glow emanating from black and white studies of empty bottles of spirits; the deliciously tawdry layer of dirt on a white lighting fixture; the dust clumps under a dog's paw; the magical, midnight colour glinting off a record-player arm; the holographic visage of a woman shimmering through a plastic LP sleeve. These photogenic touches cultivate viewer nostalgia for articles of modern life captured at a moment just prior to their being jettisoned.  

Davey, it would seem, is not afraid to mine the aesthetic potential of outmoded techne in order to exonerate nostalgia: “In critical circles', she writes, 'nostalgia has a negative, even decadent connotation. But the etymology of the word uncovers other meanings. I...1 I am told nostalgia is the intellectual's guilty pleasure'2 Often evoked in the same breath as postmodernism, nostalgia has been tainted as an expression of commercialized historicism, especially in its populist guises as kitsch, camp or the demode. Susan Sontag, a constant muse and interlocutor for Davey, was among the first to pinpoint the peculiar desire aroused by objects of congealed nostalgia: '... so many of the objects prized by Camp taste', she wrote,'are old-fashioned, out-of-date, demodé, not out of a love of the old as such. It is simply that the process of ageing or deterioration provides the necessary detachment - or arouses a necessary sympathy.3 Following Sontag. it seems. plausible that period style exerts a powerful appeal because it grants permission to submit to time's ravages: decay, fade-out, erosion, discontinued brands, trash. Davey's work, in its focus on the ageing of modernism, poignantly engages with the psychic attraction to period aura that attaches itself to outmoded things.  

In naking timeless modernism appear mortal and the outmoded appear forever young, Davey's work inadvertently responds to questions set out by the editors of October in their spring 2002 issue: The obsolescent, the “outmoded", the nonsynchronous, discarded forms, marginal mediums: all of these seem to be resources of special interest to many of the most interesting artistic projects today. How does obsolescence figure in your work? Do you mobilize it for critical purposes primarily? What is the critical purchase of obsolescence? Or does it serve constructive purposes in your work - i.e., the making of a new sort of medium or form?'4 I...]  

Responding to the questionnaire, the artist Martha Rosler takes a similarly dim view of the outmoded in contemporary art practice, arguing that 'planned obsolescence, associated with manufactured objects, outdated by technical or stylistic innovation', lends itself to an artistic obsoleteness that panders to patrons by 'dusting off the discarded and the overlooked'. Rosler objects to 'translating these eiements into treasures of taste and allegories of mortality'. For her, 'Exotic objects and moments function as fragments revalorizing the bourgeois course, a Nanook narrative for the modernizing middle-class'.5  

Though Davey would no doubt be as averse as Rosler is to reducing obsolescent goods and places to the status of exotic eye candy for the bourgeoisie, she seems polemically eager to “love' the outmoded, even at the risk of embracing commodifiable period style. She credits Zoe Leonard with bringing “love and estimation of the old-fashioned gelatin silver print into the equation, at a time, in the early 1990s, when it was thought most uncouth to do so'.6 [...]  

Rather than fail into the familiar trap of simply dismissing the fashion for the outmoded as an engine of late capitalism dedicated to pumping up the flagging charts of world-weary consumerism (Hal Foster) or as a symptom of patronage (Rosler), Davey's work enables us to see the demode as a mechanism that makes possible the radical dispossession of time. There is a temporal violence to outdating; when it erupts, it loosens periodicity's possessive perimeters around spots of time and releases arrested images into the future. The measurement of time in Davey's work is also underscored by the title of the video piece Fifty Minutes. Here, we see how Davey untimes (through the subtraction of ten minutes) the sacred sixty-minute hour. We are prompted to ask: what got lost or went unrecorded in those disappeared ten minutes? The video makes us aware of the normativity of the hour unit. 60 Minutes is the name of a long-running television show, ritually turned on by millions of viewers every Sunday who enjoy the redemptive purgation of American scandals. It is also the sanctioned time of the psychoanalytic session (Lacan, we recall, was excommunicated for tampering with its length). By setting the clock at 'fifty minutes', Davey instills a heightened consciousness of duree, along with the intimation that time might be apportioned differently once uncoupled from the measurement of proft. In Davey's piece, the labour time of women's work - repetitive multi-tasking. domestic chores - is placed on an aesthetic continuum with the unproductive activity of reading. Through such experiments with the decelerated pulse of daily accomplishment, Davey performs an art of the untimely [...]

I...J Linear, compartmentalized time has meant that we have come to see past, present and future as three separate things - a division that lies at the root of the means-ends distinction in traditional leftist politics. [...]  

For Hegel and Marx, one must always negate in order to create: that is, the present must firstly be negated before the future is ever able to come into being. Revolutionary politics is therefore conceived of in purely negative terms. and the job of building a new world deferred until after the revolution. Social movements become equivalent to war rather than creation. When the ends justify the means, the present effectively becomes sacrificed at the altar of The Future - and this for the sake of utopian designs fabricated in the minds of a self-appointed few. [...]  

Drawing on Guattari. we could well say that both past and future inhere together in the 'perpetual present', an enduring liquid moment containing both memory and potentiality:² traces of what has been, but also intimations of what could be, each indissolubly connected to the other. With this perspective in mind, there can no longer be said to be a revolutionary before, during and after. Instead of activist strategy being determined by a stark delineation between discrete stages, means and ends become consonant within a permanent revolutionary process; a continual freeing up of life, desire and the imagination wherever they happen to be imprisoned. [...]  

The futurology of the present centres not on the negation of the present-day so much as on its continual reinvention. It necessarily remains within the temporality of the perpetual present.

See Alexandre Kojeve,Introduction to the Reading of Hegel(NewYork: Basic Books,1969)136.Hegel's ideas on negation are drawn, in no small part, from physics: ‘In modern physical science the opposition, first observed to exist in magnetism as polarity. has come to be regarded as a universal law pervading the whole of nature. (Hegel, Phenomenology of Spirit. 223). Here he takes the positive-negative opposition found in electrical and magnetic phenomena and adapts it to social relations, elevating it as a mechanical law governing all of history.

# Lee Ufan On Infinity//1993  

I like art that evokes a sense of infinity. There is something that goes far beyond the artist in the landscape paintings of the Tang and Sung dynasties, bursting out of a powerful, resonant space where painted and unpainted parts interact, and ancient Roman murals in which the small remnants of painted images jostle against the broad expanse of plaster which takes up the space around them. Buddhist images carved into natural stone in the mountains, weathered by many years of wind and rain, and the Belvedere Torso, whose missing arms and legs interpenetrate with the surrounding space, are works of art that derive their legitimacy from a relationship with the outside world and they exude an atmosphere of inexhaustibleinfinity.  

When a certain critic uses the example of Claude Monet in a discussion of Lucio Fontana, he inevitably refers to infinity. Although the paintings of Monet and Fontana have a firm base in self-awareness, they dramatically introduce immeasurable elements from the outside world and are permeated by awareness of it. Both Monet and Fontana present a world in motion, Monet using colour to suggest the infinity of time that changes with every passing moment while Fontana cuts slits in the canvas to suggest the infinity of space. They brilliantly give visual form to the existence of the outside world and relationships that are formed with it.  

Works of art can speak, but they are not language as such. As long as works of art have a relationship to the outside world, they are necessarily separated from language. According to modern linguistic theory, words are basically representative signs that express and represent the self. I sometimes start from the self/language, but I always want to maintain a relationship with the uncertain, unknown world beyond it. I do not want to put the world into words or possess it with my ego but to enter into a relationship with the world that allows me to perceive it.  

Therefore, although my works are mine they do not depend only on rmne. The work is not identical with me. That is because the outside world enters deeply into my work. Briefly stated, my approach to art is an expression of curiosity and an exploration of infinity. Infinity begins with the self but is only manifested fully when connected with something beyond the self. I do not want to fix or represent the self as self, but to recognize the existence of the self in relationship with otherness and perceive the world in a place where such a relationship exists.  

In the series of paintings From Point and From Line that I made in the 1970s. I attempted to express infinity as a concept of repetition with unlimited variations. Emphasis was given to repetition and variation rather than relationships with otherness. In the 1980s, as the range of the variations expanded, emptiness emerged on the pictorial surface. I paid attention to place as a territory where painting comes into being and evoked a sense of infinity through corresponding relationships with point and line.  

In sculpture, I began by setting up conflicts between dissimilar materials such as stone and glass, encouraging an encounter with othermess by presenting the effects of forces beyond my own will. Action and eventfulness were important elements in these works. Eventually, I juxtaposed steel plates, neutral industrial materials, with natural stones, objects that contain many ambiguous elements, in a flexible temporary arrangement, presenting art as a situation created by bringing certain things together. A confrontational relationship was emphasized andresponsiveness to the outside world was enhanced.  

My paintings resemble those of Daniel Buren and Richard Trelawney in their imagery and, sometimes, the use of repetition. My sculpture, in its themes and materials, resembles that of Richard Serra and Richard Long. However, there are decisive differences between my work and that of these other artists. Their work is characterized by abstraction or generalization of the pattern or details of the painting or the steel or stone, acting to represent the logos of the artist. The canvas or material they use is familiar. It does not have a recognizable individual character, and it does not reveal a shift toward otherness. The work, whether painting or material object, does not accept things outside itself. does not have a close relationship with space, and does not incorporate the atmosphere of the outside world. Their work is enveloped in a concept of 'infinity' derived from the self or ego.  

My works are thoroughly individualized and specialized, unfinished and ambiguous, because they create a relationship between inner and outer worlds. This may strike the viewer as strange or, in some cases, irritating. My paintings seem to be comparatively easy to understand, even if there are parts that are left unpainted or empty, perhaps because I use canvas, the standard format of painting. However, my use of natural stone without any embellishment seems to cause perplexity in people whose thinking is centred on the human ego. In the world of thought, theories that emphasize non-self and othermess are gaining influence, but it is still difficult for people to recognize the existence of things outside the self, especially the world outside human beings. A young French philosopher said to me, "ln your sculpture, stone is speaking for itself without listening to you, so it bewilders the viewer.' The stone I bring into my work does not represent me. It is not intended to speak my words. It is an uncertain entity that communicates with the outside world while accepting its limitations. I make art in order to see how I can relate to an undefined and unfamiliar unknown.  

In Western society, there are many situations in which mutual recognition between self and other takes place in human relationships. In East Asia, on the other hand, there is a tendency to emphasize a territory of otherness in relationships with natural things like animals, plants, stone and earth. My works show a preference for the mediation of a relationship with uncertain, inorganic things rather than directly bringing out human self-consciousness, and this is probably due to the environment in which I was raised.  

My historical awareness and view of the world lead me to see the self in connection with a larger outside world, which includes human beings. The world transcends me and is non-transparent. In my approach, as I face this non-transparent other, the self continually loses its purity and is filtered and then reborn as the other. It shows that art is a kind of overcoming, a leap from one condition to another. Therefore, a work of art must be the site of such a Jeap, a place where there is interactive mediation between self and other. Unlike modernist art, my work is not a closed, self-contained object that reproduces the self. It is arranged as an open place by means of a relationship between self and other.  

In my work expression is not privileged as expression or representation of the self but is neutralized as a relationship with the other to form a non-objective place. My recent paintings bring out responsive relationships with minimal touches and strokes, operating in an undefined peripheral zone to become a place that evokes a sense of infinity. In my sculpture as well, the emphasis has shifted gradually from the relationship between one thing and another to the relationship between a thing and the surrounding space, and I am presently concerned with the connection between expression and the outside world. In my painting, the empty margins and the wall mediate each other, and in my sculpture, things in the exhibition space respond to things in the real world.  

Ultimately, a work of art is neither reality as such nor a bundle of concepts. Because of the fundamentally intermediate character of my art, it neither approaches close to reality nor takes a conceptual direction.  

My art is both simple and complex. I strictly limit myself in the sense of keeping the choice of materials, the structure, and acts of making to a minimum. However, the works are complex and difficult because I use irregular materials just as they are and accept the conditions of the space that surrounds them. In ;hort, by limiting myself as much as possible, I try to become involved with the world as much as possible.  

My kind of minimalism is a method that requires the space around the work to be energized more than the work itself. The work is not a text made up of signs. I want it to be an energetic living body possessing variability and contradictions. The situation of one brushstroke, one stone, or one steel plate must become a living organism brimming with energy in its relationship with otherness. The inherent strength of the materials used is more important than my actions, and they must function as parties to a relationship, an interaction between the materials themselves and between the materials and the surrounding space. This can only be achieved through the same sort of strict discipline that an athlete uses to hone his skills and a careful use of logic in arranging the materials. I am responsible for producing the energy of the interaction, but I depend on the power of empty space to evoke a sense of infinity in the work. Thus the work is given vitality through reality and ideas and it influences the reality and the ideas at the same time.  

I want my works to be non-transparent entities containing the unknown for me and for others.

# Brian Dillon Present Future//2012  

'I utterly spurn and reject so-called “science fiction". I have looked into it, and found it as boring as the mystery-story magazines -- the same sort of dismally pedestrian writing with oodles of dialogue and loads of commutational humour.' Thus speaks the narrator of Vladimir Nabokov's 1952 short story Lance. The writer seems to have shared his creature's scorn for the genre - though, predictably, Lance is also Nabokov's sole‘amateur' stab at sci-fi. The tale is notable too as the source for a statement later quoted by Robert Smithson (who knew a thing or two about timescales)and whichseems perfectly to describe the attitude to the future, and to futurisms, in much recent art. 'The future', writes Nabokov, 'is but the obsolete in reverse.'  

Isn't that essentiaily the would-be paradox that animates a good deal of the future-oriented art of the last decade or two? To the extent, in truth, that it has  

# 182//AFTER  

become a cliche on a par with the popular claim that science-fiction futures are only ever versions of the present in which they are imagined. Contemporary art seems to go further - further back, that is - and assert that the oniy futures we can conjure today are in fact those that belong to the past: a past in which technology, ideology and avant-garde brio meant that things to come were palpable, vivid, almost present, for much or most of the last century. To speak in terms of tense, the only future that seems to have mattered in the recent past has been the future anterior: what will have been, or more accurately what might have been. The future has belonged to others: possibly including - if we're old enough to recall, say, the digital thrills of the 1990s - our own past selves.  

This is not to disparage any of the art made under a temporal regime of the backward look, only to say that until very (very) recently these lost futures seemed to manifest everywhere, in art that variously returned to the buried dreams of modernism, the hubris of late-capitalist production and the fading lures of the big (really big) ideas. Consider, for instance, Gerard Byrne's video installation 1984 and Beyond (2005), based on a 1963 Playboy magazine round table discussion, in which assembled sci-fi writers attempt to picture existence in the year of Orwell's dystopic fiction. Whatever the risible lineaments of the efficient, eroticized pod-life they predict, at least they are imagining some future. Or the brace of works by Duncan Campbell and Sean Lynch concerning the doomed DeLorean DMC-12 car: a futuristic sliver manufactured in Belfast in the early 1980s and by 1985 fit only to be sniggered at in Back to the Future, where the 1950s seemed more modern. Campbell's Make It New John was made in 2009, Lynch's DeLorean Progress Report shown in 2010 at Simon Starling's Camden Arts Centre show 'Never the Same River': an exhibition whose subtitle probably sums up best this entire recent adventure with temporal paradox and nostalgic divining: ‘Possible Futures, Probable Pasts'.  

The former, at least, were short-lived. O1 so one reading would have it, in light of the economic crisis in the wake of which it became de rigueur to quote Fredric Jameson, writing in his Archaeologies of the Future in 2005: 'It is easier to imagine the end of the world than the end of capitalism' If in the pre-crash era Jameson's statement skewered a collective imagination quite prepared to contemplate environmental catastrophe (or its sci-fi stand-ins of meteor strike and alien invasion) but unable to believe in alternative futures except as antique remnants of an ideologically or aesthetically gulled twentieth century, then postslump the aphorism could be wielded, a little too hastily, as a moral admonition of the recent past and our own place in it.  

One could plausibly argue that once the unthinkable future actually arrived it became paradoxically possible to start imagining other futures again: the crisis functions oddly as the end of one big (neoliberal) narrative, with all the glamorous catastrophisms and premature pronouncements of revolution that that entails, and as year zero for other, maybe more modest futures. And contemporary art, having spent time contemplating obsolete futures from the past century, has in a way simply carried on reflecting on the same histories and the same possibilities, but with the nostalgia stripped away: invoking the future seems bizarrely less quaint now that it has diminished on many fronts. Think for example of Ben Rivers' remarkable film Slow Action (2010), in which island utopias centuries hence are worked up from footage of such places as Lanzarote and Gunkanjima, the post-industrial 'battleship island' off the coast of Nagasaki. For sure, Rivers' film makes reference to some coming (or maybe present; I mean our present) catastrophe, but its utopias come from some genuinely fictive elsewhere, schooled on such texts as Francis Bacon's The New Atlantis (1624) and Mary Shelley's The Last Man (1826) rather than the familiar futurisms of the past century.  

In short, the future has hardly gone away. A number of exhibitions this summer have courted its allure in more or less measured ways. In Limerick, Ireland, Eva International, a biennial curated this time by Annie Fletcher of the Van Abbemuseum, Eindhoven, is this year titled ‘After the Future'. Fletcher invokes the irony that after the end of the grand futures of the recent past -- and Ireland's dreams grew very grand indeed - it is both easier and more imperative to imagine modest and workable futures, futures conjured by theorist and activist Franco ‘Bifo' Berardi in his 2011 book After the Future: ‘If we come to terms with this post-futuristic condition, we can renounce accumulation and growth and be happy sharing the wealth that comes from past industrial labour and present collective intelligence.' Which is a restricted vision that actually sounds, of course, exorbitantly optimistic. Utopianism does not necessarily fade away in an era of post-crisis scaling down: at Firstsite in Colchester, the group show'News from Nowhere' (taking its title from William Morris' novel of 1890) mixes recent work by Mark Titchner and Mungo Thomson with frankly futuristic inventions of the past by Naum Gabo and Laszl6 Moholy-Nagy.  

Perhaps the most flagrantly non-nostalgic of futurisms canvassed this summer, though, is the Arnolfini's ambitious 'Superpower: Africa in Science Fiction', curated by Nav Haq and Al Cameron. This despite the title of one of the standout works: Omer Fast's three-part film installation Nostalgia (2009), which juxtaposesthefateof acontemporarychildsoldierfromNigeria,seekingasylum in Britain, with a future in which the geopolitical roles are reversed and a British migrant seeks refuge in 'Fortress Africa'. Haq and Cameron certainly acknowledge the familiar explanation for our visions of the future in the realities of the now - 'SF may not reaily [be] giving us“images" of the future so much as a projection of the present', they write in their curatorial essay. And it's true that there are remnants of familiar lost modernist futures in work such as Kiluanji Kia Henda's installation Icarus 13 (2008). which situates its absurdist sci-fi among the ruins of Soviet architecture in Angola.  

But the shift, if there is one, might have to do precisely with fiction itself, which courts the unprecedented rather than merely reminding us of future dreams recently abandoned. That's to say, the archaeology of actually existing past visions of the future gives way to acts of ex nihilo invention or divination, because suddenly it looks necessary to invent a future again, however unlikely. In 2009, Haq and colleagues edited an issue of Armolfini's biannual journal, Concept Store, devoted to ‘Possible, Probable and Preferable Futures'. That contains, among essays on past and present artistic futurisms, a work by Graham Gussin, Various Futures, that excerpts blurbs from sci-fi paperback novels, their adventures condensed in precis (sample sentence: 'At point zero the rigour of time would be like a mistaken memory'), dense, abstract fragments that are hard to explain using the familiar framework of science fiction as projection of past or present urges or anxieties. Imagined futures are perhaps not, after all, mere ghosts of what has come before, which is one reason Nabokov found the genre so maddening to read and write, involving as it does (or ought) the purest of leaps into invention. As he put it in Ada (1969), a novel seeded with wry bits of counterfactual history, “The present is only the top of the past, and the future does not exist'

# Raqs Media Collective Plankton in the Sea: A Few Questions Regarding the Qualities of Time//201l  

To ask a human being to account for time is not very different from asking a floating fragment of plankton to account for the ocean. How do plankton bank theocean?  

What is time?   
What is the time?   
The time is of your choosing.   
The time is not of your choosing. The time is out of joint. The time has come.   
The time needs changing.   
The time has gone.   
The time has come and gone.   
The time has flown.   
The time is not convenient.   
The time is at hand.   
The time has been spent well.   
The time has been wasted.   
The time is awkward.   
The time is ripe.   
The time has passed so swiftly.   
The time is now.   
What is the time?  

We say 'my time','your time', but how do we tie these models of personhood, of being (me, you, us) to the medium within which all these me's and you's and us's all swim in? Heidegger says, 'Being and time determine each other reciprocally, but in such a manner that neither can the former - Being - be addressed as something temporal nor can the latter - time - be addressed as a being.1  

In the Confessions, Augustine begins his discourse on time by confessing. 'What then is time? Provided that no one asks me, I know. If I want to explain it to an inquirer, I do not know.'2 In our effort to account for time, we will confess toourconfusions.  

# Neuroscience and Mental Time  

Recent research in the neuroscience of how our brain processes time seems to indicate that there are several clocks, in fact several kinds of clocks running in our brain. A recent article by Burkhard Bilger in the New Yorker on neuroscientist David M. Eagleman explains,  

Eagleman borrows a conceit from Italo Calvino's Invisible Cities. The brain, he writes, is like Kublai Khan, the great Mongol emperor of the thirteenth century. It sits enthroned in its skull,'encased in darkness and silence', at a lofty remove from brute reality. Messengers stream in from every corner of the sensory kingdom, bringing word of distant sights, sounds and smells. Their reports arrive at different rates, often long out of date, yet the details are all stitched together into a seamless chronology. The difference is that Kublai Khan was piecing together the past. The brain is describing the present - processing reams of disjointed data on the fly. editing everything down to an instantaneous now. How does it manage it?3  

Bilger continues by detailing the context from which Eagleman's work emerges:  

Justhowmany clocks we contain still isn't clear...The circadian clock,which tracks the cycle of day and night, lurks in the suprachiasmatic nucleus, in the hypothalamus. The cerebellum, which governs muscle movements, may control timing on the order of a few seconds or minutes. The basal ganglia and various parts of the cortex have all been nominated as timekeepers, though there's some disagreement on the details. The standard model, proposed by the late Columbia psychologist John Gibbon in the 1970s, holds that the brain has 'pacemaker' neurons that release steady pulses of neurotransmitters. More recently, at Duke, the neuroscientist Warren Meck has suggested that timing is governed by groups of neurons that oscillate at different frequencies. At UCLA, Dean Buonomano believes that areas throughout the brain function as clocks, their tissue ticking with neural networks that change in predictable patterns. Imagine a skyscraper at night', he told me. 'Some people on the top floor work till midnight, while some on the lower floors may go to bed early. If you studied the patterns long enough. you could tell the time just by looking at which lights are on'  

Time isn't like the other senses, Eagleman says. Sight, smell, touch, taste and hearing are relatively easy to isolate in the brain. They have discrete functions that rarely overlap: it's hard to describe the taste of a sound, the colour of a smell or the scent of a feeling.... But a sense of time is threaded through everything we perceive. It's there in the length of a song. the persistence of a scent, the flash of a light bulb. “There's always an impulse towards phrenology in neuroscience - towards saying, "Here is the spot where it's happening", Eagleman told me. ‘But the interesting thing about the perception of time is that there is no spot. It's a distributed property. It's meta-sensory; it rides on top of all the others."4  

# In the Wake of Storms  

Itisnotat allsurprisingthatweareall thinkingquiteseriouslyabouttheactual possibility of thinking of time-based and spatially-located forms of exchange today. Whenever capitalism licks its wounds, loses confidence - as it is doing today - dormant economic imaginaries come into view. Economists start talking topoets,artists andlaypeople-thosetheyareotherwiseoftenkeentodismiss asmadmenor ignoramuses.  

The need-based systems that emerge in the aftermath of periodic crashes or in the wake of war and catastrophes are small conceptual windows on the realization of some of our desires of what a collective life based on mutuality, generosity. reciprocity and trust might be. As capitalism eats away at the planet's resources, and spends more on destroying human life than it does on sustaining it, the lines between having no choice and desiring something different may begin to blur.  

# After-work Time  

As work-time becomes a less hallowed objective and criterion of living. as it becomes more insecure and unpredictable, incomprehensible and exhausting with inchoate repetition, the value of after-work and non-work time can reassert itself as the site of inventiveness of forms of life and mutuality. A wide spectrum of nineteenth-century thinkers imagined this experience of duration as the site of what life could aspire to become. Their vision was eclipsed by their twentiethcentury epigones who ran amok over our imagination of duration with their frenzied worship of work-time and their paranoiac policing of time. How can we speak in the language of exchange without using the vocabulary of measure? How can the span of time that covers the length of a service be evaluated and divided into exchangeable units?  

The offerings and requests that are part of such a project could be read both as a melancholic-ironic take on not being able to hold on to precious moments of life or as an incipient coming-into-view of an enormous spectrum of specific inventions that human beings can make for one another when the imperatives of work. security, achievement and hierarchy are held in abeyance. It will be a challenge to enact and think through what this can mean for us today. At present, this enormous spectrum, like our Kublai Khan-brains, lives enclosed in silence and darkness. One could say that in a world where the division and hierarchy of labour functions as the dominant measure of life, we inevitably end up arranging various capacities and gifts as unequal but equivalent. But when we are not brought into a relationship of equivalence vis-a-vis one another and mediated by abstract labour power, but instead invoke and discover each other through acts, desires, gestures, requests and offers that activate propensities towards new possibilities of intercourse that lie outside work-time, we are faced with an interesting enigma.  

# Perishables and Imperishables  

The time of human life is a finite, perishable thing. Which is why two quantities. X and Y of perishable human time, can be brought into a relationship of fungibility only by means of a third thing, Z, that we agree upon as being imperishable, at least in comparison to human life. For thousands of years, this Z was condensed into units of precious metals, especially gold, which were treated as valuable precisely because their durability and their apparent imperishability made them appear as things that lived outside of time.  

In India, a currency note declares, “I promise to pay the bearer the sum of X rupees. These rupees reflect the value of a certain sum of gold, which because of its imperishability is something that wili be of the same quality, say ten years from now, as it is today, so that a 'promise made to pay the bearer may be redeemable in the future.  

It is important to hold on to this notion of uniqueness and finitude, because lurking behind this caiculation is the fact that if we view time from the point of view of the individual then the truths that each of us lives only once (hence each moment is unique) and that death is inevitable (hence, one day, our time will end) make time itself the most scarce commodity we have. That is why we buy time. save time, and hoard time. The irony is, we buy time with the time we take to do the things that fetch us the value against which we purchase time. We make time to buy time to sell time to buy time to make time. And key to all of this is the imperishability of gold. Even now, the fascination that ancient gold has over us has something to do with the fact that a gold ornament that is five thousand years old seems, somehow, as good as new. Its promise to pay its bearer the sum of its worth in weight is not diminished over time.  

# Alchemist's Gold  

Now, the old alcheimists' dream of making gold and discovering the elixir of life make sense - both are quests for immortality, to make one's claim on time last longer than ever before.6  

In today's world not even gold can guarantee the stability of value over time. At the end of World War Two, the Bretton Woods Agreements saw the world's major currencies abandoning their reliance on gold reserves as an expression of their value. Instead, they pegged their value to the rate at which they exchanged against the US dollar. with the understanding that at least the US dollar would exchange against gold.′ However, in 1971, the United States under Richard Nixon abandoned the gold standard.s Since then, global financial and monetary systems have been in a kind of free fall. The gravity of the gold standard has given way to the free-floating levitation of the value of different currencies. The Us dollar tries to do the job that goid did for thousands of years: by printing endless copies of itself which are then sent out into the world as a way of shoring up a system ultimately based on the faith that the world's governments have in the idea that the US government will outlast them, just as gold outlasts other materials.  

Never in human history has so much rested on the fortunes of something as fragile as the destiny of an individual state in the world system of states.This is what lies behind the value of your time, my time, and our time - ultimately, the value of our life is pegged to the fetish of the free-falling, free-floating dollar bill. No wonder it says 'In God We Trust'; when all else fails, the divine is the only thing left to turn to.  

# Time, Workers and the Republic  

The relationship between the time and effort that one puts into work, the nature of recompense that one receives, and the quality of one's participation in social life is a triangulated problem that seems to have been with us for thousands of years. Since Plato, if not earlier, we have been accustomed to the idea that those whose hands are busy all day long cannot have the 'time' and the detachment necessary for an engagement with social questions. Hence. they must never be given the authority or the power to decide things. not even for themselves. This is somewhat circular - it automatically ensures that those who have power allocate themselves the freedom to not labour, with the excuse that those who labour cannot find the time to think on matters larger than themselves. In other words, the quality of the time of the thinker and the doer are seen to be two different things have hitherto been arranged hierarchically in all societies.  

What happens when we begin to pay attention to the seconds and the hours? We remember them, tell stories about them, make poems out of tea breaks and songs out of time stolen from labouring. It is the gossip and idle chatter of seconds and hours that makes for society. We know what we know about each other because we tell each other the public secrets of capital. Stretched end to end, this chatter turns into history.  

When we are done with accounting for our exhaustions, we are still left with the question of how, for instance, we value a person's life - the sum total of the value of their time on earth. The thing is, you can gauge the value of a thing only when you know what you miss when you lose it. The problem is. you would not be in a position to judge the worth of your life were you to lose it. And so, to one school of thinking, the worth of a life can only be gauged from what its absence means to those who inherit the loss.  

# Human Life Value: An Insurance Calculation  

How is the insurance industry. with a little help from mortality figures and actuarial tables, able to tell you what you are worth, not to yourself, but to your inheritors? A clear way to assess one's financial worth is to calculate 'human life value. This concept was developed in 1924 by Solomon S. Huebner of the. Wharton School of Business. Huebner is considered a founding father of the life insurance industry and a dominant force in its professionalization.  

Here is how human life value is calculated. First, deduct all personal expenses - food, clothes, travel, entertainment. and so on - from your annual income. Income includes salary. bonus, employee benefits like company contributions to pension funds, and income from investments. (Iit is important to make as complete and realistic an assessment of your income as possible, so you don't end up over-insuring.) What remains of your income after deducting personal expenses is what your family consumes.  

Second, see how many years of earning you have left (your retirement age  

# 190//AFTER  

minus your present age). Project family expenses up to retirement, allowing for reasonable increments. Subtract any pension benefits they would receive if you die. Add non-recurring expenses, like your children's higher education, or their marriage. The shortfall is what you should insure for. And third, calculate the present value of the shortfall, allowing for a reasonable rate of inflation.9  

Here is an example: suppose you earn 300.000 euros per year, and have twenty-five years until retirement. Your total earnings until you retire would be 20.9 million, after factoring in an annual increment of 10 per cent. Say 60 per cent of your income goes towards taxes and personal expenses. The rest would be family expenses. At the end of twenty-five years, then, your total family expenses would be 10.1 million. It is difficult to predict inflation over long periods, but following the current rate of 6.5 percent, the present value of your family expenses over twenty-five years would work out to 4.2 million. That is your financial worth in relation to your family.  

So, if you were to die tomorrow, your family would have to earn 4.2 million units of currency over the next twenty-five years in order to compensate monetarily for your absence. This gives you an indication of how much you should insure yourself for. lf you divide 4.2 million down to the last minute of all twenty-five years, you get 2.5 units per minute and 150 units per hour. That is the value of your time per minute and per hour over the next twenty-five years, according to the insurance industry. This is how the value of every minute is calculated backwards from the event of death.  

# Jan Walker's Forinula for the Value of Your Time  

Another way of computing the value of life-time is made available by Ian Walker, a professor at the Lancaster School of Business at Birmingham University. Walker has calculated what it means to value every minute of our time.o He even has a formula for it: ${\tt V}=({\sf W}((100-\mathrm{t})/100))/{\sf C},$ with $\boldsymbol{\cdot}\boldsymbol{\ v}$ being the value of time, 'W the hourly wage rate, 't' the tax rate, and $\mathcal{\displaystyle Y}^{\star}\mathcal{\displaystyle C}^{\star}$ the cost of living.  

In 2002, when this study was done, it showed that time had become increasingly valuable over the last twenty-five years. This is a slightly different measure from that of insurance, mortality figures and actuarial tables. If there we had sense of how much the absence of our time would cost others, here we get a sense of how much our time is worth to us as we live. The two figures can be different, as the second equation does not include several factors that the first one (being more socially embedded) includes. Does this mean that the same unit of time can be valued differently depending on whether we look at it from the point of view of the inevitability of death or, on the other hand, the contingency of life?  

Walker claimed that his research showed that if people had an endless supply of money, more than 80 per cent would use that money to buy time. In other words, he argued, most of us use money to buy time. But given that time is money, we are back to where we were a little while ago, using time to buy time.  

Regardless of whether we arrive at our value of time from death or from life, we are faced with the fact that key determinants of the calculation, wages and the cost of living are in many instances completely out of our control. In a desperate. war-torn country, wages may be low, but the cost of living may be incredibly high. Even poorer people may have to 'buy' themselves protection. We know this to be true from the fact that in many cases it is expensive to be poor, and that the rich are, in many instances, subsidized. These days they call it stimulus.  

This leads to even more skewed results when it comes to the quality of time. The qualitative experience of time spent waiting in a long queue for food in a soup kitchen is very different from the experience of time earned by a rich patron in a restaurant that takes pride in delivering quick and efficient service. In both instances, a hungry person waited for food. In one case, they felt they exhausted their time in the wait, and in the other, they felt that they had earned the time of a good meal. If we are the meal, and our inheritors are the ones waiting to eat us up, then the value of our time can be sensed from how they recount their experience of waiting for us to die.  

While on the subject of waiting, and the price of waiting, we could drift momentarily towards Howard Nemerov's poem, Waiting Rooms':  

What great genius invented the waiting room? Every sublime idea no doubt is simple, but Simplicity alone is never enough. A cube sequestered in space and filled with time, Pure time, refined, distilled, denatured time Without qualities, without even dust ... Dust in sunbeam between Venetian blinds Where a boy and his mother wait ... Eternity! But I am straying from the subject: waiting rooms.  

All over the world, in the great terminals And the tiny rooms of disbarred abortionists, For transport, diagnosis, or divorce ... Alas! Maybe this mighty and terrible theme Is too much for me. But wait! I have an idea.  

You've heard it said, of course, that anything May instantly turn into everything  

In this world secreting figures of itself Forever and everywhere? How wonderful That is, how horrible. Wherever you wait, Between anticipation and regret, Between the first desire and the second Is but the razor of a moment, is Not even time; and neither is motion more, At sixty miles an hour or six hundred, Than an illusion sent by devils to afford Themselves illusory laughs at our expense (we suffer, but they become happier).  

Think how even in heaven where they wait   
The Resurrection, even in the graves   
Of heaven with the harps, this law applies:   
One waiting room will get you to the next.   
Even your room, even your very own,   
With the old magazines on the end tables,   
The goldfish in the bowl below the window   
Where the sunbeam falls between Venetian blinds .. And in the downstairs fall there is your mailbox, One among many gathering paper and dust,   
A waiting room figure, summing up   
Much in a little, the legendary box   
Where hope only remains. You wait and see.1  

What really happens while we wait? Does our body, our consciousness register the passage of time in a coherent, unified, responsibly sovereign way?  

# Timecode Drift  

Don't we all experience momentary blackouts, anomalies, premonitions and short sharp bursts of deja vu? And could it be that these snags and glitches and cracks and disturbances occur because our mental clocks are a little off-key?  

It is interesting to consider what happens when two bits of digital sound or video are joined together. Essentially, this operation has to rely on the two bits of data first identified on the basis of their timecode stamps. A timecode stamp appears on images produced when you make a photograph with even a basic consumer-end digital camera - it provides information including when the photograph was made and the frame number.  

In a recent article, Gautam Pemmaraju tries to fathom the strangely anomalous phenomena that sometimes occur in the video editing room when joining two different bits of footage leads to unexpected outcomes:  

Timecode is essentially a labelling system for video, film and audio material wherein each frame has a unique identification address in Hour:Minute:Second:Frame format. As binary coded media metadata, timecode [sic] formats (standardized SMPTE, EBU) are practical ways to identify, locate, access and then manipulate recorded audio/visual data.2  

Pemmaraju's story of footage and data going out of synch is familiar to anyone who has spent time in an editing suite. He recounts how he went into an editing suite for post-production work with live footage from a music festival, and he soon realized, 'to his utter dismay', the anguish that was in store for him:  

A multiplicity of timecode issues - drift, break, sync, control track - appeared on the master tapes and I was confronted with the horror of the loss of automated synchronization amongst other devilry. This perfidy cannot be overstated - the prospect of trying to achieve/repair sync, the flaws ofwhich are in turn mischievously asynchronous, begins with the acceptance of many, many edit hours of painful remedial work. Someone or something fucked up and I had to pay for it.3  

As he watched his material go progressively out of sync, Pemmaraju realized that he was confronted with a case of what he calls 'timecode drift. He explains it as a mysterious de-syncing that happens in live (or 'as live') TV production, where the inputs of multiple cameras are received simultaneously (and synchronously by Genlock) and are edited in real time to one recording source (called the ‘online master'). Pemmaraju notes that,  

Drift is loss of sync. The clocks drifted apart, or more precisely, the ‘master clock' was not able consistently to enslave its subordinates. And the drift itself was a variable, not a constant. Its value changed over time, bringing up the rather curious idea of a drifting apartoftime over time. Multiple clocks, meantto be synchronously tethered to one another instead achieve a sort of frisson, a momentary excitement or perturbation, unannounced and governed perhaps by an incalculable whimsy as they break away from their moorings, leading then to schismatic clocks and parallel,fractured times.  

Pondering the phantasmagoric nature of these interlinked drifts of time and perception leads him on 'to consider crossed paths, missed opportunities, and ultimately, an eschatological stoppage - a grinding halt of time'14  

194//AFTER  

# The Qualia of Time  

Pemmaraju's story urges us to consider the occasional senses of temporal dislocation that we all experience from time to time - instances of timecode drift within our consciousness, small insurgencies of siave clocks against a tyrannical master clock. Little outbursts of the time of the id against the timetable of the super-ego? When thinking about the qualities or, to use a more precise term, the qualia of time - the ineffable, intrinsic, private, directly apprehensible sense of what happens when we are confronted with duration - be it in waiting for a bus, the arms of a lover, the walls of a prison, or by the shores of a sea - we realize that every instance of the apprehension of time's qualia is layered on the memory of other experiences, that in some incomprehensible way, the time spent in the arms of a lover is understood not just in reference to itself, but also in contrast to the time spent waiting our turn at a ticket counter. And often, at the ticket counter Or on the assembly line, waiting while the clock weighs down on us, we are recalling the intensity and the comfort of the time spent in the arms of a lover. When we trade time, which time are we trading, which layer of qualia, and how can these add up and be accounted for when our own clocks drift away from each other, from time to time?  

# Dogen on Time: The Universe in a Moment  

All that we have discussed until now points to the difficulty in finding equivalences between different experiences of time. We have seen that the value of time looks different from the points of view of life and death, from the points of view of the different temporal rhythms we embody, and from the point of view of how the social worid conditions the triangulation of waiting, anticipation and entitlement. Finally, we know that our different histories make for different apprehensions of time.  

Dogen,the thirteenth-century initiator of Japanese Soto Zen, wrote extensively on the question of being and time. Here are a few fragments gathered from his textShobogenzo.  

We can never measure how long and distant or how short and pressing 24 hours is; but, just the same, we call it '24 hours'. The leaving and coming of the directions and traces (of time) are clear, so peopie do not doubt it. They do not doubt it but that does not mean that they know it.  

We can say, for the present, however, that doubt is nothing other than time.  

Thus there are moments that are made up in the same moment of time and there are moments of time (plural) in which the same mind is made up. Practice and realization of the truth are also like this. Putting the self in order we see what it is. The truth that self is time is like this. We should learn in practice that because of this truth the whole earth includes myriad phenomena and hundreds of things, and each phenomenon and each thing exists in the whole Earth.  

Such to-ing and fro-ing is the first step of practice. When we arrive on the solid ground of the ineffable, there is just one thing and just one phenomenon here and now, irrespective of whether we understand or do not understand things or phenomena. Because there is only this exact moment, all moments of existencetime are the whole of existence-time, and all existent things and phenomena are time. The whole of existence, the whole universe, exists in individual moments of time. Pause a moment and reflect whether or not any part of the whole of existence Of of the whole universe has leaked away from the present mament of time.1s  

If each second contains the universe, how do we trade it? How do we loan it, buy it, save it? How do we accumulate interest on it? What can we do with it?  

How, then, can my time trade for yours?  

If my time and your time is the time of the universe, then how can we trade time for itself? Only if we reorder our orientation vis-a-vis time from one unduly governed by our sense of the finitude of our lifespans to the infinitude of death itself. This statement may seem surprising to some, and so might need a little unpacking.  

# The Circuit of Debt and Redemption: Life and Death Reconsidered  

If wealth is controlled time, then the sediment that is formed when duration is put under duress is its currency. The time spent in labour is hereby regained as its coinage, which I guarantee to exchange with the detritus of your time, for eternity. My time for yours, for now, for later, for the time of our choosing.16  

The one thing that is equally available to all, and that does not perish and can never perish as long as there is life, is death itself. Our mortality should be the gold standard of our life's transactions with other lives. It is the metal to which we can peg all our currencies, all our instances of giving and taking to each other. Once we die, we can neither give nor receive, and all attempts to evade this fact, whether through inheritances or estates, are basically arbitrary attempts to pretend that death had in fact not occurred.  

Consider the example of two people in two retirement communities in different parts of the world, who each decide to give each other a present - a gift of time. The first gives his gift of time to the second, who then dies and has no chance to reciprocate, and remains indebted to the person who is still alive. But it gets more complicated than this: this first person receives a gift of time from a third person, who then also dies, leaving this person who is still living with no way of repaying him either. But before they died, each person gave and received gifts of time - through the intermediary of the person who remains alive. So, in fact, all debts have been cleared through this triangular relationship of gift giving. As we make this model progressively more complex, we realize that we all stand in a relationship of complex obligations and reciprocity where no one stands indebted to anyone else because of the way in which debts cancel each other out. And yet, everyone is simultaneously indebted to everyone else.7  

In the second chapter of Derrida's Given Time, entitled “The Madness of Economic Reason', is a remarkable passage on the relationship between gifting and time. His analysis comes from a meditation on the problem of the relationship between the excess of gifting and the balance of reciprocity as established by Marcel Mauss in The Gift.  

The gift is not a gift, the gift only gives to the extent it gives time. The difference between a gift and every other operation of pure and simple exchange is that the gift gives time. There where there is gift, there is time. What it gives, the gift, is time. But the gift of time is also a demand of time. The thing must not be restituted immediately and right away. There must be time, it must last, there must be waiting - without forgetting (Il'attente - sans oubli). It demands time, the thing, but it demands a delimited time, neither an instant nor an infinite time, but a time determined by a term, in other words, a rhythm, a cadence. The thing is not in time; it is or it has time, or rather it demands to have, to give, or to take time - and time as rhythm, a rhythm that does not befall a homogenous time but that structuresitoriginally.8  

This presupposes that we understand our time on earth as part of a commons, and our reciprocal actions as the motions of a grand orchestra in which the music continues to be played even though players come and go. This time actually devolves back to the commons when we die. It creates more time for other people. To paraphrase Marx, dead time makes fertile the ground of living time.19  

Aristotle reminds us that, “Ithings] are contained by time in the same way that things which are in number are contained by number and things which are in place are contained by place. .. [Tjhat to be in time is to be measured by time'20 It is not the other way around, it is precisely not to measure our time by the worth of our being. It is time that has us, not we that have time.  

We cannot have time, because in time we become ourselves and then cease to be ourselves. In earlier times, time was seen as the property of God, and that is why there were prohibitions on usury. You could not charge interest on a loan because what you·were giving to another person was not necessarily money alone, but also time. As long as the borrower gave back the principal to you, that was all that mattered. A demand for a repayment of interest only made sense if you thought that the time he had kept the money with himself actually belonged to someone, and that that someone happened to be you. To assume this was to lay claim to time as one's fief, to make oneself a competitor of God.  

The book of Ecclesiastes in the Bible has passages on time that continue to be of valueto consider:  

A time to cast away stones, and a time to gather stones together; a time to embrace, and a time to refrain from embracing; A time to get, and a time to lose; a time to keep, and a time to cast away: A time to rend, and a time to sew; a time to keep silence, and a time to speak; A time to love, and a time to hate; a time of war, and atimeofpeace.21  

Even those of us who are not blessed with belief in the divine can make sense of the fact that there is something perverse and arrogant to laying claim to time as property. The wage system miraculously offers entitlement to a fraction of time, but takes away entitlement to most of it, and yet, at the same time, insists that one should jealously guard the time one has left from theft by others. No wonder that thieves make excellent policemen and the biggest bank robbers are those who own and manage banks.  

Our time began when we were born, and will end when we die. We have done nothing to earn it, so we cannot pretend that it is ours. How do we share and exchange that which is not ours? What does it mean to use words like sharing. exchange, and reciprocity in relation to something that cannot be owned?

# Daniel Bimbaum Future Arrivals//2007  

If the future existed in a concrete sense as something that could be discerned by 'a better brain', we wouldn't be so seduced by the past. But the future, says Nabokov, has no such reality. It is but 'a spectre of thought'. Probably Philippe Parreno sees things in a similar way, and yet this spectre of thought - futurity - haunts much of his work and sometimes gains an unusual solidity. A window opens up, and the future is there, strangely visible before our eyes. This, it seems to me, is what happens in El sueno de una cosa (2001). The Dream of a Thing', says Parreno, 'is a game that produces new stories each time it is played; these are the stories of a film in a permanent pre-production stage.' It's been aired in the movie theatres of Sweden, inserted in the middle of the advertisement programme. Its second showing took place in an art context. Parreno describes it: 'A painting of Robert Rauschenberg, The White Series Painting, is visible during 4'33', the time for the painting given by John Cage. At the end of this score of silence, as in a haunted museum of a theme park, the light fades and the film is projected on the painting.'1 What we obtain in the darkness is nothing less than a glimpse of the future, a moment of visibility not yet integrated into a narrative, and thus unburdened by history, experience and meaning: sixty seconds of a future form of life, and it seems to me, a different sense of chronology, evolution and causality.  

'The search for personal liberty is becoming more and more synonymous with a quest for the non-narrative', says Parreno, and adds, 'the time ought to be taken to develop this. But in the eventuality of a total absence of narrative, fantastic stories are always there to fill the void.2 In El sueno de una cosa, the fantastic 'story' is one of anomalous growth and strangely synthetic vegetation. Surely the scene is not taking place here and now; it's all in some other place and insome radically differenttime,yetit seems undeniably and overwhelmingly present. The beginning of Edgar Varese's 1954 'Deserts', often described as a music of expectation, amplifies the anticipatory quality and the sense of arrival. An arrival of what? The scenery of the film is also the territory of expectation, a transparent desert where the vegetation seems to develop according to its own peculiar chronology. The images, taken in the 'paleness of a midnight sun', have been filmed in $35\mathrm{mm}$ to keep the ‘quality of immanence, of presence'3 The film has been compared to a NASA pilot displaying future events planned in outer space: a kind of rehearsal taking place not in real time but in some tense as yet unheard of. 'When it turns to science fiction, cinema closes its eyes and moves into a rich and uneasy sleep',4 writes J.G. Ballard. That is not what happens in Parreno's film. This is not science and not fiction, and we are all wholly awake and attentive. Our brains, it would seem, have been liberated from the Euclidean coordinates, and can now process images and sounds of a radically different order. Perhaps this art of the future no longer can be understood in terms of an organic brain but instead forces us to invoke a device at once mechanic and sentimental: “The programming for Parreno does not have to do with the brain, but with the machine (human and sentimental), with an art of the future at loggerheads with science as well as with fiction'.5 Parreno has little in common with those artists - Stan Douglas and Tacita Dean would be prime examples - who find inspiration in obsolete technologies and outmoded means of communication. His is an art of anticipation and emergence. If Eija-Liisa Ahtila travels through the labyrinth of pastness and explores the mind as a memory machine, Parreno invests only in the future and shows no interest whatsoever in the past. Consequently. his notion of subjectivity, if that is still the relevant term, is radically different. In fact, it seems to me that Parreno's work represents a great challenge exactly because of the total lack of a retrospective mode. Like no other artist, Parreno forces us to rethink the notions of emergence and arrival. All notions of subjective 'depth' and perceptual 'thickness' - dependent as they are on established concepts of interiority as capsules of pastness - are inadequate. A theory of a subject that constructs itself in relationship to the future rather than through modes of Erinnerung (remembrance) seems to require an entirely novel architecture of time. Imagine [the neuroscientist and philosopher] Francisco Varela's representation of the non-linear network of retentions [in our consciousness], but invert it so as to emphasize the subject's anticipatory drive and openness to a variety of futures, i.e. highlight the plurality of protentions [perceptions of the next moment] rather than the retained past, and you will perhaps move towards a topological rendering of a subject compatible with Parreno's subject of the future.  

(Architectures of the future: Parreno's and architect Francois Roche's collaborative 'Battery. House', a hall for large gatherings and a kind of biotechnology-driven hyper-plug that will solve the. electricity problem at the Thai artist commune The Land, certainly testifies to a futurist predisposition. Built as an unusual film set for Parreno's The Boy from Mars (2003), the eccentriclooking building is powered by animals (local elephants or buffalos) and seems to me to represent a break with the traditional organism/artefact distinction. This is a building that 'breathes and perspires. something between Clement. Adler's early bat-winged aeroplane and a Spielberg pterodactyl', according to Roche. In a short essay. “Hybrid Muscle', he spells out the functioning of the battery house and its intimate cooperation with humans and animals: 'In front of them is a structure made of still-inert plastic leaves holding a 20-tonne concrete counterweight, hanging vertically like clothes in a European miners' locker room. Their job: to lift them patiently. one by one, using a system of cables and pulleys. moving with animal slowness. Thus, muscular energy (2,oo0 w/h) is transferred. stored and released, and thereby transformed. by means of a dynamo. into electrical energy. This endless cycle from elephant to structure to gravity and then to energy compresses or frees interior space, in rhythm with the occupation of The Land and the movement of the counterweight platform'.)6  

In the future perhaps there will be no past. There is a proximity in attitude between Parreno and Doug Aitken, who seems. similarly uninterested in ruminations of the past and in the mnemonic depth of the human mind. Humans are almost entirely absent from Aitken's diamond sea ( 1997 [set among abandoned diamond mines in the Namibian desertl). but the passage of a body through fully automated surroundings is the theme of another somewhat related work, the impressive eight-screen installation electric earth (1999),. which starts with what was absent in Aitken's earlier work: the gaze of a human eye. The protagonist. played by Ali johnson, lies prostrate on a bed, a remote control in hand. gazing at a TV airing nothing but static. The eyes, the remote contro! and the monitor seem to define his confined universe. His drowsy stare expresses nothing but boredom and low energy: it is as dead as the flickering monitor. He mutters,'A lot of times 1 dance so fast that I become what's around me. It's like food for me. I, like, absorb that energy. absorb the information. It's like I eat it. That's the only now I get. Is he an inmate in an electronically controlled cell. or a guest in some desolate motel room? It would appear the latter, because the next thing we know, he is off on a night-time stroll. repeating over and over again the last phrase like a secret mantra. 'That's the only now I get, that's the only now I get. Gone is the fatigue of the motel room; now begins his high-energy trek across electric earth, an urban environment as devoid of humans as the automated desert in diamond sea. He is alone. He passes the airport at sunrise, his hands mimicking the rotation of the huge satellite dish. Night suddenly returns, as if time decided to rewind just before daybreak, and he walks the deserted streets of an empty shopping area, passing a closed supermarket and a trophy shop. His walk. increasingly mechanical and spasmodic, develops into a bizarre dance that seems to conform to its surroundings in a continuous attempt to copy the syncopated rhythms and movements of the automated environment. 'A lot of times I dance so fast that I become what's around me. He keeps to his initial declaration; this is a night of magical automatons.  

Or is it the other way around? Maybe it is the electric paroxysms of this dancing wizard that animate the inorganic surroundings. At times, it seems that it is his dance that sets the objects in motion. Car windows roll up and down mysteriously: a car wash comes alive; a shopping trolley in a deserted parking lot suddenly fills with spasmodic energy. He stands in front of a Coke machine trying to insert his dollar bill, but the machine spits it out again, then pulls it back, producing an epileptic fit that seems to spread from the machine to his body. There is no longer a sharp dividing line between organic body and machine. The automatic movements of a surveillance camera mimic the nocturnal wanderer - or is it vice versa? All the mechanical noises produce rhythms for dancing. The spasms in front of the Coke machine escalate into an ecstatic dance, the lonesome dancer breathing more and more heavily as the music turns into abstract drum and bass accompanied by the pulse of city lights. Aitken says, ‘The landscape in electric earth is stark and automated, but the electricity driving the machines is ultimately more important than the devices it drives. It's what the protagonist responds to, and, in turn, what puts him in motion.'7 This electricity, which seems to pass through the environment as well as through the protagonist's body, does not distinguish between organic and inorganic, between natural and artificial.  

This vision clearly represents a break with the traditional organism/artefact distinction, and seems closer to the view that everything is machine-like, a notion that can be found in the cosmology of G.W. Leibniz. In his Monadology (1714), he states: ‘Every organic body of a living being is a kind of divine machine or natural automaton, which infinitely surpasses any artificial automaton, because a manmade machine is not a machine in every one of its parts ... But nature's machines, living bodies, that is - are machines even in their smallest parts, right down to infinity.'s Thus, there is no difference of kind between a living body and a mechanical device. In Leibniz's Baroque cosmos, organic substances are no different from inorganic ones. 'Whether organic or inorganic, matter is all one',§ says Deleuze. In electric earth, the automatic paroxysm of the inorganic environment seems to communicate intimately with the paroxysms of the protagonist's bodily parts. Yet there is a major difference between their visions: the Baroque philosopher's universe is one of stability and harmonious cooperation between all parts: Aitken's apocalyptic Baroque is one of dysfunctional friction and collapse. The systems of communication are no longer operative. Things don't work; they only display the mechanical spasms and automatic convulsions typical of devices on the verge of total breakdown. And yet, perhaps there is something new emerging. An emergent form of life?  

So what is the hyperkinetic stroll in electric earth really about?  

Aitken expounds:  

It's structured around a single individual, whom I imagined as being the last person on earth. He is in a state somewhere between consciousness and unconsciousness, and he is travelling through a seemingly banal urban environment in the moments before nightfall. As he moves, the world around him - a satellite dish, a trash bag spinning in the air, a blinding streetlight, a car window-begins to accelerate.  

Is this a gloomy vision of the future, showing the last human in a world populated only by machines, the last man himself on the verge of final mechanization? Such an interpretation would be in line with the understanding of diamond sea as a grandiose scenario showing the danse macabre of death machines, but Aitken's narratives can never be pinned down in such an unambiguous fashion. They are open-ended and circular. What does seem clear, though, is that the predicament displayed in electric earth is that of a human body that can no longer be described in the terms of traditional humanism or phenomenology: the human as a reflecting being in. control of its own actions and thoughts and enjoying a harmonious relation to its own body. The rhythmically advanced cybernetic machine in electric earth is an amazing performer. but the dance is not one of serene self-awareness; it is, rather, one of technological disturbance and crisis. The phenomenological subject has always been described as existing in the immediacy of the Now. Yet Aitken's protagonist has cleariy lost this sense of presence; instead he is in a state of continuous flux with a different experience of time: 'That's the oniy now I get.  

With regard to this nocturnal high-tech stroll, the artist has described the experience in temporal terms:  

Taking a walk can be an uncanny experience. Propelled by our legs, we find rhythms and tempos. Our bodies move in cycles that are repetitious and machine-like. We lose track of our thoughts. Time can slip away from us: it can stretch out or become condensed. But this loss of self presence, it seems, can sometimes produce another kind of time: the speed of our environment becomes out of synch with our perception of it. When this happens, it creates a kind of grey zone, a state of temporal flux. The protagonist in electric earth is in the state of perpetual transformation. The paradox is that it also creates a perpetual present that consumes him.1  

This perpetual present. 'the only now he gets, is not a simple temporal atom but rather the effect of complex systems of communication and of technological detours. The subject - if that term can still be applied - is no longer characterized by unity and oneness. Instead it appears as part of a network of flows and pulses, open-ended and unpredictable. Its sense of a now arises when the present merges with its technological surrounding and becomes part of the all-encompassing place known as 'electric earth'. From the phenomenological perspective, the lived body represents the absolute ‘here and now' of experience. the firm ground around which everything else revolves. The situation that Aitken describes in electric earth clearly puts this into question; it would seem that the construction of subjectivity through new technologies and the media cuts right to the very bodily core of human identity. The landscape - whether it be Namibia, Guyana [in monsoon, 1995] or the suburbs of Los Angeles - plays a central role in most of the works, but it's never a question of a pure natural landscape, untainted by culture and technology. On the contrary. today's artificially altered sense of nature has rarely been captured with such precision as in Aitken's videos, not only when the landscape has given way to the mediascape of Los Angeles, but in those works where the cultural traces are more delicate. Shot in Jonestown, Guyana, where in 1978 the followers of Reverend Jim Jones committed mass suicide, monsoon is a film showing fragments of a village that has been repossessed by the jungle; birds and crickets provide the soundtrack. The camera zooms in delicately on small details - a red flower, parts of an old tractor, ants scurrying along a crack in the dryearth $\rightharpoonup$ and seems to make no distinction between nature and artefact. Then we get the larger view: dark clouds, a storm arriving. The footage offers nothing but the anticipation of a monsoon. This was the artist's only preconception of the piece: he would go to the site of the tragedy without a shooting script and stay until a monsoon arrived. One hopes for a storm that can wash away all the remnants of the past, finally deleting all traces of the sad sect.  

The strain increases every second, but the rain never comes. Momentary images of still beauty - a green bush against the clear sky, the patterns of leaves against the blue - give us solace, but the tension builds. As viewers, we are caught in the unnerving interval between the memory of pain and a future that never arrives. 'I was interested in inaction, or waiting, says Aitken. 'Waiting in this location for as long as it takes for a monsoon to hit. In the end, the emphasis became more on the subtleties that we found: this is what ultimately created the narrative.'2 When the rain seems to be coming close, the work suddenly comestoanend.  

The understanding of landscape as a complex conglomerate of disparate elements was clearly formulated in Robert Smithson's projects. In 'Proposal' (1972), he contended:  

The visual values of the landscape have been traditionally the domain of those concerned with the arts. Yet art, ecology, and industry as they exist today are for the most part abstracted from the physical realities of specific landscapes of sites. How we view the world has in the past been conditioned by painting and writing. Today, movies, photography and television condition our perceptions and social behaviour.3  

The list of relevant visual technologies has since been added to, yet in many ways one can see Aitken's interest in the contemporary landscape as a continuation of Smithson's meditation upon nature, art and abstraction. Aitken's automated milieus and the abstract, sometimes monochromatic, qualities he finds in the landscape are also reminiscent of Smithson's observation .in ‘Nature and Abstraction': 'There is no escaping nature through abstract representation; abstraction brings one closer to physical structures within nature itself.'14  

If a history of the American sublime is to be traced via artists such as Newman, Smithson and Turrell all the way up to Aitken's video installations, then one must keep in mind the altered sense of the experiencing subject. The sublime experience in the Romantic tradition was defined in Kantian terms as an experience of the subject's inner capacities to comprehend infinity. The vastness of a landscape, as depicted by, say. Caspar David Friedrich, was seen as a manifestation of the subject's inner struggles. The modem American subject of Newman's writings is equaily heroic: the sublime American image mirrors modern man: 'Instead of making cathedrals out of Christ, man or "life", we are making them out of ourselves, out of our own feelings.' In more recent artists such as Smithson and Turrell, the heroic subjectivity of Romanticism and Abstract Expressionism is no longer in place, but their artistic projects can nonetheless still be understood in terms of a phenomenology: in Turrell's case a phenomenology of perception linking the eyes to kinaesthetic experience; in Smithson's case a more extreme archaeology of cultural sedimentation. Aitken's world, it seems to me, can no longer be understood in terms of a traditional phenomenology; his landscapes are not directed towards a subject. This becomes increasingly clear in installations where a multiplicity of perspectives coexist and where the 'brain', in Deleuze's words, has lost its Euclidean coordinates, and now emits other signs':'5 These 'other signs' can no longer be linked to the unifying concept of a subject. In works such as electric earth, I am in you (2000), or interiors (2002), the self is a zone where time and space intersect in a variety of ways, and the very concept of experience must be thought of in terms of this plurality. interiors is an installation that features a series of seemingly disparate narratives. The characters move through vivid environments, including a Tokyo penthouse, an urban junkyard, and a Los Angeles helicopter factory. The various paths never come together in a synthetic whole.  

eraser (1998) records the artist's trek across the Caribbean island of  

Montserrat a year after it was devastated by the eruption of a volcano. The artist followed a perfectly linear, seven-mile path from the north to the south, from coast to coast, recording the post-catastrophic landscape. The camera sees abandoned houses, a clock tower, an empty street, the interior of a chapel, a red telephone covered with sand. It zooms in on single objects and details: remains of the life that once flourished on the island. This journey through a wild and even hostile landscape is intensely melancholic. Dry, cracked earth; a wild forest; old industrial machinery: this is a journey through an unknown world. Despite all the things encountered, absence is what is most strongly felt. The sound - a composition of fragments recorded on site, looped and stretched - intensifies the melancholic mood. The voice of Louis Armstrong coming from a radio playing for nobody fades away into the night.  

The camerawork produces a sense of proximity and immersion. As if the viewer is winding a path through the jungle and searching out the shelter of a vacant building. eraser attempts to erase the distance between the viewer and the landscape, to involve the viewer to such an extent that the work becomes part of their stream of experience and vice versa. Putting such emphasis on the viewer could be seen as the ultimate phenomenology, and one could perhaps claim that the complete immersion in eraser pushes the viewer's subjectivity to a point where the phenomenological model of experience breaks down. This more complex space allows for the participation of the viewer but also brings the viewer's unity and stability into question. In works such as electric earth, the complexity not only has to do with the multiple projections, but also with the active involvement of viewers who decide their own pace when moving through the installations. Such kinaesthetic and perceptual multiplicity can no longer be thought of in terms of one harmonious experiencing subject. If the sublime landscape of the Romantic painter was understood as a manifestation of the subject's inner struggles, the protagonist in electric earth not only moves through the environment but seems to become part of the electrified landscape. He is a multiple projection of the environment, rather than the other way around.  

The routes through space that these video works trace are never linear, but hint at elaborate narratives: circular, multi-layered and open-ended. The sense of time out of which the stories are constructed can hardly be understood in terms of a linear succession; other spatial models are needed. Not the space of science, but an experimental space that makes this new flow of events perceptible. In trying to visualize and communicate an alternative conception of time, we are forced to adopt alternative spatial metaphors such as the Borgesian garden of forking paths.  

That which truly is, is the eternal Present, the Now. Such is the Platonic teaching, inherited by an entire tradition leading all the way up to modern attempts - such as that of phenomenology - to come to grips with the flow of time. The comet - to return once again to Husserl's image - traces a luminous line. The line represents the succession of now-points, but the now itself is constantly new. The comet must be conceived of as constantly reborn. new in every moment. To break with this powerful linear conception seems to require a spatialization of a different kind. Aitken's large-scale installations offer such spatial solutions, the journey through which is never predictable and never the same. Ali Johnson's body in electric earth emerges as the product of a technological environment run amok. And the viewer who moves from one segment to the next in this complex cinematic corridor becomes part of the scenario, not only through empathy, but through the physical experience of the work. It's his/her bodily conduct and kinaesthetic experience that determines the rhythms and structure of the work. electric earth takes place in and through the viewer's body, itself always a plurality.  

The self is never a given in Aitken's works. The subject, or, rather, new forms of subjectivity emerge via complex systems of detour and technological mediation. The mind has no direct line to itself, but must pass through various complicated systems of mediation. Such seems to be the predicament described in Aitken's automated cosmos, where the displacement of the subject in time is a natural consequence of the digitized topography it inhabits. The human eye is equipped with all kinds of machines that widen its reach. But it cannot see itself see - at least not without the help of mirrors or a prosthetic subsystem. Visual technologies abound in Aitken's universe: the film camera; surveillance equipment; fadar dishes; the remote control; flickering monitors. To the computer file, sound and vision represent nothing but data to be translated and manipulated freely. Through advanced robotics, the kinaesthetic sensations of the body can be broken down to basic signals. Thus, the living body as a last point of reference disappears and a world of freely circulating information is born. One of Aitken's installations, I am in you, gives us a glimpse of such a universe. The last agonizing bodily paroxysms that we experienced in electric earth are gone. This is a harmonious world of child's play. piano music and divine geometry. A young girl whispers, I like to run and not slow down. I like to see and look'. We see her eyes, over and over again, sometimes in extreme close-up. A blue monitor grows and soon covers the whole field of vision, thus producing one of those monochromatic moments typical of Aitken's work. We see bodies falling through space, and aeroplanes sucked into some vortex-like vanishing point at incredible speed. Even if the passage through this five-projection installation is more harmonious than Ali Johnson's nocturmal urban trek, it is by no means without its intense and dramatic moments. All sense of traditional architectural space is gone; we move through a strangely unanchored space where everything floats freely, producing a hallucinatory sense of eternal recurrence. Things attempting to escape this cosmos are sucked back by a mysterious force. Even time is absorbed this way. A candle burns producing a deafening sound; a car rides along the street with no one at the wheel. The girl's voice whispers over and over again, You can't stop.' Who drives this universe, who inverts its course of events? Who am 'I' and who are 'You' in I am in you?  

Most of Aitken's works have explored a specific site with particular histories and memories; electric earth depicted a rather generic urban landscape, but in I am in you all sense of geography and locality has evaporated into a cycle of dream-like imagery. If 'I' am not here, living in this body, feeling with these hands and seeing with these eyes, then I am everywhere or nowhere. Virilio sums up our predicament in a series of questions:  

For if man's sphere of activity is no longer limited by extension or duration or even opaqueness of obstacles barring his way, where is his presence, his real presence, located? “Telepresence, no doubt, but where? From what starting point or position? Living-present, here and there at the same time, where am I ifI ameverywhere?16  

Aitken's recent work seems to occur in such a non-site where time and space must be redefined and our presence becomes ‘as random as those phantom particles whose position or speed may perhaps be known, but never both at once.17 You can't stop', whispers the girl's voice. This is the end of time. Things disappear into the vortex of experience. Again and again: eternally. It is your experience, and you can't stop.

# Toril Johannessen A Personal History with Science: In Conversation with AdnanYildiz//2012  

Adnan Yildiz Let's start with the public space installation from last year. It is in the form of a public clock at the University of Bergen called Historical Time (2011). with some prints showing future calendars. It is based on the decimal clockwork. This reminds me of many things, such as Charles Chaplin's 1936 film Modermn Times, or commissioned calendars from great emperors [such as the Julian Calendar]. or Antonio Negri's great book Time for Revolution ...  

What was your starting point?  

Toril Johannessen The 24-hour day is a strong convention that we adapt to, but naturally it's not given that we measure and represent it in exactly the way we do. I think that, to understand the politics of time, it's aiso vital to be aware of the technologies of time measurement. The decimal clock for Historical Time is conventional in the way it's operated, with a clock face that has a second, minute and hour hand going at a steady speed. The only difference is the layout of the dial and the speed that the hands are set to go at. I wanted to introduce such a familiar yet strange element in the context of a public space in order to direct attention to the arbitrariness of our chosen way of representing time.  

Specifically. I was inspired by a book I read about Aibert Einstein and the  

French mathematician Henri Poincare, who worked at approximately the same time, around the turn of the twentieth century, with the pioneering theories of space and time. The writer Peter Galison describes how research and the development of physics are not just dependent on theoretical abstractions but aiso affected by machines and technological development. Galison speculates, among other things, on how Einstein's years in the patent office at Bern, with a view to the railway station with one of the first coordinated clocks in Europe, may have influenced the development of relativity theory. He also writes about the work today on the synchronization of clocks and the global standardization of time. Throughout the ages, several people have developed, used and applied to patent time measurements based on decimal notation, but probably the most famous attempt at introducing it was during the French Revolution. The Convention of 1795, which introduced the metric system by defining a number of measurements such as kilos, litres, etc. did not include time, and metric clocks were only tried for a short period in 1794-95. The calendar based on the metric system known as the Republican Calendar was in use for about ten years in the same period.  

Yildiz The way you transform your research into presentations for exhibitions brings another question for me, especially regarding the pieces Revolutions in Time or Conventions in Time (parts of the work Words and Years, 2010-11). I would like to talk more about your methodology. How do you create these abstractions, orabstractedgestures?  

Johannessen The methodology is simply that I map the frequency of how often specific words have been used in selected magazines - in those cases, Time magazine (from 1923 to 2011) and some academic journals, from their first issuetothepresent.1 collect the databygoing through the digital databases of the publications, searching the words. I design them so that they are close to what you could find in a textbook or report, but perhaps a little more refined aesthetically, as I design them from scratch instead of using a programme that generates graphs. I started Words and Years as an inquiry into how or if history and the zeitgeist are reflected in language by the use of certain words. I was also interested in looking at how words and concepts can have diverging meanings in different professional fields and that they change their meaning over time. Take revolution: during the English Revolution, the term was understood in the sense of rotation, to returmn to, which was essentially the aim of this revolution: a return to tradition. During the French Revolution, on the other hand, the aim was to tear down the established inorder to build something new, and the term was then used in the sense of subversion.  

Yildiz The project Nonlocality (2011) is composed of twin-exhibitions in Oslo and Dusseldorf I...J How were these presentations in two different city contexts synchronized?  

Johannessen I had wanted to do synchronized exhibitions for a while and tweaked the dates for two planned shows to make them simultaneous. One of the works shown, Mean Time, has two clocks controlied by computers. which continuously retrieve information about global Internet traffic. When the activity online is high, the speed of the dials is faster, when the activity is lower, they go slower. The clocks are thus guided by human activity. not by a godly, invisible hand, or fluctuations in crystals or atoms. The other works were also doubles. and hinted at duplicity and synchronization.  

I was interested in looking at how time and place are variables that change according to technological and scientific deveiopments. Synchronization, standardization and the establishing of a global time are historically linked to the deveiopment of the railway network, a process that is also related to the unfolding of capitalism and ideas of progress. As processes like the determination of longitude, synchronization of clocks and the construction of railway networks aitered temporality and spatiality over a hundred years ago, the Internet now changes our perception of time and space - both the time we use working in front of our computers and how humans in different places are connected day and night in a new time zone.

# Rachel Kent Marking Time//2012  

I find it astonishing that through telescopes, people can look directly into the universe to a time where the Earth didn't even exist. That every time we look into the sky we are looking into the past (the light from the sun and the moon is reaching us from a few minutes ago) - in fact there is never a way to see what is going on around us in the universe right now this moment.   
-KatiePaterson  

[...]Light Bulb to Simulate Moonlight (2008) comprises a solitary illuminated bulb in the gallery, adjacent to a wall-mounted rack of 288 buibs, each one with a 2,0oo-hour lifespan. Katie Paterson collaborated with the lighting company Osram to create this work, inviting its technicians to simulate as closely as possible the moon's glow. The resulting 289 bulbs, which have frosted blue shells and a warm yellow-blue tonality, together represent the average human lifespan - 66 years, when the work was made in 2008 - and the amount of moonlight an average person will experience through the course of his or her life. An ordinary human life measured against the moon's glow, or a tiny, insignificant blip in the context of an ancient planetary backdrop: the relativity of time and scale is poetically evoked in Paterson's work.  

Earth-Moon-Earth(MoonlightSonataReflectedfromtheSurfaceoftheMoon) (2007) takes this relationship a step further. For this work, Paterson researched popular music associated with the moon, settling upon Beethoven's famed piano composition; she then translated the musical notes into Morse code, employing amateur radio operators (known as 'moon bouncers') to bounce it to the moon and back. On its return and translation back into music, the composition had altered subtly - because the moon's surface is uneven, the composition was strangely fragmented, with missing notes and odd pauses. Played upon an automated Disklavier piano, Paterson's artwork has an eerie presence in the museum; it is as though the moon were playing its own composition, beamed across the vastness of space to unsuspecting listeners in the present moment.

# Trevor Paglen Geographies of Time//2012  

[...] EchoStar XVl [a satellite circling the Earth], and the image disc onboard [designed to last for billions of years, holding a collection of one hundred pictures compiled by Trevor Paglen] have a profound and counter-intuitive set of relationships to time. The satellite is an instrument of speed, transmitting hundreds of thousands of images per minute, all at the speed of light. Yet the future of EchoStar XVI lies in the deep time of the cosmos.  

EchoStar XVI is a communication satellite, a technology of commerce, media and global connectedness. It comes from a lineage of communication and transportation technologies that have, in a relatively short period, fundamentally altered our relationship to time and space. In the nineteenth century. with the advent of steam engines, trains and telegraphs, the worid became dramatically smaller. Railroads meant that journeys which had once taken days or weeks were reduced to mere hours. Telegraph cables meant that messages which were once hand-carried by men riding horses could now travel at the speed of light. Transportation and communication technologies integrated global commodities markets and led to the creation of international financial markets. Over the course of a single generation, time sped up so quickly and so dramatically that humans found it nearly impossible to keep up.  

Artists and philosophers tried to make sense of a new world of speed, commerce and distorted geographies. In 1844, J.M.W. Turner made the blurry painting titled Rain, Steam and Speed - The Great Westerm Railway. Four years later, Karl Marx wrote The Communist Manifesto, declaring that the 'constant revolutionizing of production, uninterrupted disturbance of all social conditions, everlasting uncertainty and agitation distinguish the bourgeois epoch from all earlier ones ... All that is solid melts into air' He later expounded on this point, arguing that the continual speeding up of time was one of capitalism's fundamental dynamics, which he famously described as the ‘annihilation of space by time'.  

So complete was the nineteenth century's annihilation of space and time that time itself had to be reinvented. Before the railroads, each place kept its own time. When the sun was overhead, the time was noon. In England, Oxford time was five minutes behind Greenwich, and Leeds was a minute behind Oxford. Dover, in the east, was separated from Penzance by half an hour. But in order to coordinate their schedules and prevent accidents, the railways had to create their own system of time, 'railway time', to bring the discipline of a shared clock to the towns and stations along their routes. [...]  

# 214//AFTER  

The creation of absolute time entailed the subjugation of localities, regions and nations to a centralized tick of a clock at the Royal Observatory in south London: Greenwich Mean Time. Not everyone wanted to go along: in 1894, the French anarchist Martial Bourdin tried to blow up the Royal Observatory (his bomb exploded prematurely, killing him). But by the end of the century, the transformation was nearly complete. 'Time ceased to be a phenomenon that linked humans to the cosmos', explains Rebecca Solnit, ‘and became one administered by technicians to link industrial activities to each other.'2 [..]  

Over the last two centuries, humans have created 3.5 trillion still photographs, and we add hundreds of billions each year. In 2011, Facebook held more than 140 billion photographs, a repository ten thousand times larger than the Library of Congress.? On an average day. a person living in a city sees over five thousand images.\* Pictures form the visual atmosphere of our daily lives. But our pictures are fleeting and elusive. In the far future, bits of hard drives may be fossilized in limestone, and discarded iPhones may find themselves encased in amber. hardened like nail polish, but the bits of humanity that these exquisitely crafted machines hold will be lost to time.  

Earth's new moon, EchoStar XVl, embodies the Anthropocene contradiction betweenthe hyperspeed ofcapital and the deep time of anthropo-geomorphology, the torrential flow of twenty-first-century pictures and their utter ephemerality. While it whirls and hums with energy over its fifteen-year lifespan, EchoStar XVI will broadcast more than ten trillion pictures and video frames to earth-based televisions and computer screens. All of these pictures will be as evanescent as the radio signals that carry them. But EchoStar XVI holds other pictures. A modest collection, to be sure, but one designed to last far longer than the oldest cave paintings. A collection designed to transcend the Anthropocene and to transcend deep time itself. A collection of pictures designed for the time of the cosmos. A collection of pictures that very. well may be the last.

# novaMilne The Joy of Space-Time and Other Fantasies//1988/2012  

It's 6January 1988,in thebasement of a suburban home outsideToronto.Richard addressesthecamera directly,simultaneouslyunderstandingit tobehisrecipient in the southern hemisphere.At age ten, he's unaware that he embodies the seamless flowbetweenelectronicmedia andconsciousness thatMcLuhanhadpredicted.But he understands that space and time are collapsed because his video message can link far-away places and dates. Richard stares directly into the camera, opening with the optimistic icebreaker: The miracle of technology has brought me into your livingroom.'  

In 1988 a younger self is attempting intercontinental contact with his future observant other, while elsewhere in California, physicist Kip Thorne is copublishing a paper asserting that the laws of physics may allow you to harness a wormhole to traverse both space and time. Thorne reminds us that the most evocative aspect of the space-time continuum is its potential plasticity.  

Occasionally we entertain the idea that the thought experiments of theoretical physicists could be amongst the good conceptual art of the last half-century. They direct us to matter outside common visibility, measure or material value. And there's a sort of high minimalism to quantum physics, which gives us the likes of quarks, and names them long before their existence is fully known. But it's the mere hint of a theory's plausibility, like a rogue meme, that quickly segues into speculative fictions and potentially distorted realities.  

We are seduced by the temptation to forsake linearity because of its occult potential to damage the regulatory structures wired to the historically determined present. Non-normative temporalities are self-evident as literary and cinematic devices, and are certainly not particular to science fiction. Virginia Woolf's Orlando (1928) displays a remarkable bandle of temporal slippage, delightfully devoid of any sci-fi necessity to suggest technological possibility. The titular character exists essentially outside of time, and although narrative events are embedded within the normative flow of a 300-year history. Orlando's ageless continuum acts as both metaphor and facilitator of his/her seamless shifts in gender, identification, perspective and spatiality. Orlando poeticizes the experience and observation of time as subjective and malleable.  

But the imagined ecstasy of temporal emancipation does carry a melancholy sting. Felix Gonzalez-Torres' Perfect Lovers (1991) has tempered this for us in devastatingly reduced form by transposing a pair of wall clocks for the bodies of himself and his lover. Initially synchronized, and hung side by side, the autonomy of the clocks' batteries will lead them to expire separately, with their hands out of synch.  

But to further imagine Perfect Lovers, as we often do, we consider the work in spaceflight, and we're reminded of Einstein's predictions of the effects of Time Dilation. These suggest that if you sent one clock travelling on a spacecraft, time for that traveller would be slowed-down relative to their observant other. It's a surreal mechanism when anthropomorphized. And as with Gonzalez-Torres, in the anachronistic, re-composed video art we make as 'Ms & Mr', the observant other is also the observant lover.  

This always leads us back to Kip Thorne's explanation of wormholes in his book Black Holes and Time Warps: Einstein's Outrageous Legacy (1994). His text is illustrated with a series of drawings stylistically reminiscent of those made famous in The Joy of Sex (1972). However these drawings depict two figures (the physicist and his wife) in various domestic scenarios, involving a range of rudimentary black holes. Although the figures are clothed, the included holes give them an awkward erotic undertone. We've always imagined them as theoretical tableaux for relationships conducted through the ‘mouths of wormholes'. Thorne's analogy - with partner, living room, spaceship and traversable wormholes - describes the potential for loops in space-time, and short-circuits for meeting younger selves. The science is explained, but - perhaps politely - the deranged possibilities are never fully entertained.  

We are reminded of J.G. Ballard's lament of the moon landings, and his complaint that NASA actually shrank space-time with the 'child-like fumblings' of the Apollo walks. Celebrating the end of the actualized space age, he suggests that the freedom to explore space correctly is really the reserve of our personal fictions. And according to this proposition, the mouths of wormholes seem neither less banal nor more wondrous than the space-time bending of the family video camera of 1988. In Woolf's words, 'It is a difficult business - this timekeeping: nothing more quickly disorders it than contact with any of the arts'  

Meanwhile in 1988...I collect comic books.I like Science, Maths and Art."

# Mark von Schlegell The Midlister//2012  

Hitherto life had always had a way of bringing the suitable first reader of a book to the door at the suitable moment. But this new book, my thirty-third, was about time travel. This particular book encouraged me to view the time of the novel's creation backwards, from yellowing published copy into pristine mint condition then into proofs then into a proof-read manuscript etc. Before step 3d to 4a, there would be a first reader, this was a certainty. As I waited, it occurred to me that if one looked backwards along the timeline this person's arrival on the scene could seem as the singular event that initiated the creative burst itself - that moment where the book wili pass from dimensional objectivity into the primordial wideness of its mysterious and multi-authored origin in my body.  

So when my house telephone rang the very day 'd printed the latest final version, I confess to a tingle. It struck me as fitting that I would have to rely on the old.technology and cradle a handset to my chin, pinned by a wire to a station pinned more firmly to a wall (all of which rode their own waves back and forth in the timeline), to trade phonons with the world's first reader. But when I realized who it was who was calling, the hair literally stood up on the back of my neck.BillBeck!  

It was Bill Beck. 1 knew it instantly.  

I hadn't spoken to Bill Beck in two decades. Twenty-five years ago, Bill had been the centre of a group of young people interested in science fiction - friends of mine at one remove. They'd all gone on from my life, including Bill. But unlike Bill the others went into successful careers in programrming, science and engineering. It's clear that our bonding with Bill inspired all of us to chase our dreams. Certainly the experience helped lead to my own questionabie development into a mid-list science fiction author (and computer consultant).  

Yes, Wayfarers. Our bonding occurred at the forge, dare I say it? Of a roleplaying game. It was a suitably rationalized science fiction take on the Dungeons $\pmb{\mathcal{E}}$ Dragons model, not very well-known except by a minority who knew it more than theyknowthe world itself andwere thereforemysteriously removed from the worid. Wayfarers was written in the 1970s by a group of miniatures gamers at the Indiana State U. Wargaming Club, and self-published as mimeoed pamphlets. Eventually reprinted and distributed in little booklets available in hobby stores or by mail-order, it used only four six-sided dice, pencil and paper.  

How to explain the achievement? More than any movie or video game could possibly hope to be, Wayfarers opened fully literate 7os hard science fiction into astonishing. life-changing depth. We reasoning, critically engaged adventurers entered a universe of impenetrable depth, laid out in scientifically and imaginatively coherent principles. Reality is a muiti-authored business, and the smail group gave shared life to the universe late into the early morning. At this time role-playing had a sinister stigma, and there was something transgressive afoot as well, something I can't really name. Like many science fiction mid-listers, I am and always have been an essentially normal guy. I didn't tend to hang out with people like Bill Beck. Bill Beck, of course, was the Waymaster.  

In the game it was the Waymaster who would design and monitor the physics and politics and cultures of a universe in which the other players, or characters, would adventure, together or apart, for weeks months of interlinked sessions of game-play. His relation to the dice was Jupiter's to Fortuna. The success of the game depended entirely on the Waymaster and the fact is I didn't like roleplaying so much unless it was managed by Bill.  

For a group of friends who had little to no interest in art, to play Wayfarers with Bill Beck was to watch Royal Shakespeare put on Henry V. To behold what Emily Dickinson called ‘the soul in white heat' - to witmess Henry James' Sacred Fount pouring free for hours at a time, unselfconsciously without even rhetoric. We gathered round Bill Beck's universe late into the suburban night as if around a fire on an open plain beneath the stars.  

Bill's energy knew no bounds in sketching out starmaps and ship diagrams, determininginterestingstatisticsofalltheevenminorcharactersinhisuniverse. An energetic actor, natural comedian, ham tragedian, he impersonated authority figures or cringing cowards with excitement. He impersonated computers with cold skepticalintelligence.Hefrightened,cajoled,mocked andbegged.Meanwhile he built worlds. Consider the wide scope of possibility in a universe where interplanetary travel was the norm and humans and aliens were everywhere about, yearning for romance, revenge, survival and adventure. Whole disciplines, economies, music movements and paranormal sciences appeared with their own micro-histories, as if Bill had lifted them from a world where they already existed waiting for him to take them. To sketch out your character's history with Bill was to learn the history, economy, ecology, culture and science of a peculiar piece of a physical fictional Universe.  

Billaccessed a differentsense of the dimensionality of theworldalways on the verge of being discovered. The player felt as if some extraordinary object was about to be grasped. As was proper to a such a game, you would most often die before you found it. Soon you had rolled another character and started over from an entirely newset of eyes.  

Bill accomplished all this as a teen. His suburban American environment didn't prepare him to understand the extent and nature of his creativity. In the world outside the game, he struggled unceasingly. Even among these same friends he was often something of a scapegoat and victim. They (we) all treated him badly. It was as if we already knew what he (and we) would become and sought to get our crossing over with. He was in fact actively persecuted, even made to be a sort of freak. It was sad he invited these attacks by the way he dressed and kept himself. Friends laughed at him without going behind his back. Girls he loved went out with his closest friends as if to humiliate him sexually. After high school graduation he didn't apply to college (what did he need more to know, after all, Bill who could teach a whole universe?); the Wayfarers went all their own ways. I certainly never played the game again. Left alone in a family that was also evidently collapsing, Bill 'had a breakdown'.  

He found Christianity. He ceded his universal fictive power to Jesus. He lived in his car and grew a prophet beard, looking and smelling like he'd stepped right out of the Civil War,waybefore thiswasfashionable.Waybefore-yes thiswas all many years ago and I'd heard nothing of Bill Beck since.  

'Bill Beck', I said.  

Apparently, he'd survived.  

'I heard you had some trouble with your new book', he said.  

OK, he was born again. But science fiction has a hierarchical energy of its own in which I, it had always been self-evident, stood on a lower rung than Bill Beck. I had thirteen published novels to my credit, not to mention over seventy stories sold, yet in the hierarchical energy of science fiction it was always self-evident that I stood on a lower rung than Bill. I was surprised how clearly I felt this was still the case. I felt immediately that he would never regard my work without merciless patience, no matter what I achieved. The fact is of course that the midlisters, folks like me that is, are the ones that keep the genre alive so that folks like Bill Beck can stand on their highest or lowest rung. This ladder is different from all others. Once observed, its stations are historically and irrevocably claimed. They are on the record.  

'The book's fine. It's all ready. It's about time travel', I said, maintaining authorial confidence.  

'It might be a good idea if I take a look at it first.'  

We exchanged addresses. And so, as a result no doubt of my desire to climb at least a rung or two in his estimation, I forwarded it immediately, electronically.  

Ordinarily the period between my forwarding a finished text to its first reader and me hearing back might be anywhere from a week to a month. But the house phone rang, that now unfamiliar sound, the very next morning.  

'It's not a disaster', Bill Beck said. But you're going to need to rewrite."  

A terrible certainty of the book's failure might have pierced me then, or perhaps a just as terrible hope. But I am a mid-lister. I met the lack of enthusiasm in the voice with the usual shrug of infinite perseverance.  

'Well, thanks Bill', I said. 'But I think as a draft, this is final -'  

I've already diagrammed some of the more fruitful of your backstory's implications. But you're going to have to purify, revise, if you want to really do awaywithEvolution'  

'Do away with Evolution?'  

'Your backstory. Evolution. Noun. The sequence of events involved in the evolutionary development of a species or taxonomic group of organisms. If you want your book to crystallize a moment for the sake of hindsight - Look, time travel backwards does away with evolution. Has no one told you that? The theory no longer applies. Time travel proves that evolution, when taken to its logical end, is a simple tautology. Evolution only works as a backstory to worlds without time travel - never as a story per se. Now you've moved it full frontal, friend. The real backstory must demonstrate that evolution is dead, must die, on the stage of science -- revenged by man and God - reunited in second time by the Holy Spirit. Evolution must fold into backwards frontstory, de-evolving so-called modernity in the process. Unwind fascism, genocide and anti-humanism, into the very chain that Darwin himself claimed 'evolved' through Lamarck into The Origin of Species, back even before Copernicus. Now, as a dead thing, un-write the monster into which it will finally evolve. Do away with it in first-time.'  

"I don't understand: And I don't think I do to this day. It was hard to take it all in.  

'I'm saying Evolution's dead as a backstory. Time travel proves it, science fiction hasn't quite realized it yet. This is real today, buddy. If you want diagrams I cansendsome.'  

He never sent them. Apparently science fiction, from up where Bill Beck stands, along with evolution has been pulled up into the real world and slain. Purportedly from where I stand, things look different. In fact the ladder itself, perceived from a second-time narrative, appears to be a Mobius loop. I walk it and shed the same variations on themes I·catch on the flipside, nodding to Bill Beck as he passes on what from here appears to be a middling position.  

And up here, today, as you can see, I myself am living in my car, exposed to all sorts of threatening horizontal gene transfers, writing this backwards on a gas station receipt so that it might be erased and sunk back, when it's all ended, into the cashier print-box from within which it was soon to roll itself up, pack up and travel to a processing plant, making itself literally, eventually, into part of a living thing and from there even all the way to the tree fish who itself wasn't even the first one, concentrating ever backwards, in fact, to when the comets first delivered theirseedstothisparticularrockyworld and authored thegenres.  

It has been some time since I've heard from my publishers. I trade trinkets with crosses printed upon them; I kneel at the feet of Virgins and cross myself whenever I happen, as now, to realize that I've said too much. Helical interstices of dust in space when viewed holographically from second time appear from the so-called higher rung to be a cross? Why shouldn't it be the other way around? Like a number of mid-listers I know I am anything but religious. Inhabiting my own backstory, I refuse to step forward. I take the six rolled, six-sided dice off the table altogether, pretending, as usual, to erase their facts into all the probabilities of their potential casting. I raise Bill Beck (who never called, who never cared) up before me and believe again that time is risk.

# Michael Stevenson and Jan Verwoert The Dust Mite and the Widgets//2013  

The Dust Mite had not found time to rest lately. Dust never stopped gathering, and the Mite didn't take its occupation lightly. It kept itself meticulously informed about the dust it digested and the many different fibres, particles and remnants of organic or inorganic matter that could be found in its composition. The Mite thus rightfully prided itself on its insight into the stuff that the world is made of.  

Therefore it was boundlessly surprised when it first met the Widgets. Trying to make out someone to address in their featureless mass the Mite exclaimed:  

'Who are you?'  

The Widgets appeared in great numbers but spoke with one voice. “We', they boomed, 'are whatever you want us to be. We have no preference, no state or creed. We're aligned with none. We have no mother tongue. We have no form yousee.'  

Accustomed to the murmur of dust, the Mite was nearly deafened by the volume of the Widgets' address.  

'You, sir, sift dust for a living, but we, we are the cement of the universe. We are sold and bought. Without us, all affairs come to nought!'  

And with that they marched off, keeping in neat rank and file, yet changing shape every other instant.  

# 222//AFTER  

Eager to learn more, the Mite left its dusty home to follow the Widgets.  

'But how', it persisted, 'can you claim to be what everything is made of, when you show that nothing is solid and all is in flux?'  

'You must understand', spoke the Widgets, 'that in the commerce of life, change is the one constant that circulates. Any one unit can be any other, and there won't ever be anything missing or lost ...'  

'Oh ... oh ... oh ..!' were the Mite's last words. By following the Widgets, it had entered a universe where nothing faded, nothing turned to dust and hence nothingwas there to nourish a humbleMite.  

So it withered away, and the Widgets marched on.

# Documents of Contemporary Art  

In recent decades artists have progressively expanded the boundaries of art as they have sought to engage with an increasingly pluralistic environment. Teaching, curating and understanding of art and visual culture are likewise no longer grounded in traditional aesthetics but centred on significant ideas, topics and themes ranging from the everyday to the uncanny, the psychoanalytical to the political.  

The Documents of Contemporary Art series emerges from this context. Each volume focuses on a specific subject or body of writing that has been of key influence in contemporary art internationally. Edited and introduced by a scholar, artist, critic or curator, each of these source books provides access to a plurality of voices and perspectives defining a significant theme or tendency.  

For over a century the Whitechapel Gallery has offered a public platform for art and ideas. In the same spirit, each guest editor represents a distinct yet diverse approach - rather than one institutional position or school of thought - and has conceived each volume to address not only a professional audience but all interested readers.
