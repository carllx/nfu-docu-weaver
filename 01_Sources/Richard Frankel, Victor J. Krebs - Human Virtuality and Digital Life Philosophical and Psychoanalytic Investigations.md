[]{#index_split_000.html_p2}'Whether we embrace it or resist it, digital communication is one of the defining facts of our times. In their rivetingly thorough and engaging account, Frankel and Krebs show us what psychoanalysis has to do with and do for our digital age. And like all the more interesting psychoanalytical books, it is about far more than psychoanalysis.'

**Adam Phillips,** *general editor of the new Penguin Modern Classics, translations of* *Sigmund Freud; author of* On Kissing, Tickling and Being Bored; Going Sane; Side Effects; Missing Out; One Way and Another *; and most recently,*

The Cure for Psychoanalysis

'Secluded during the COVID pandemic, I sank into this extraordinary and utterly timely work. *Human Virtuality and Digital Life* pursues the deeper ambiguities and opportunities of our suddenly, radically digitalized existences. Ranging effortlessly from bison painted on caves to the semiotics of photography to our new "0-1" worlds, from Plato and Walter Benjamin to D.W. Winnicott and Guy Debord, the authors consider the way seeing, thinking, and being will change, the way truth, time, and space will bend, the way our most private possession, our own psyches, will be both impoverished and enriched by what is no longer a dream but is our waking present. A brilliant work.'

**George Makari,** *director, DeWitt Wallace Institute of Psychiatry, Weill Cornell Medicine;* *author of* Soul Machine: The Making of the Modern

Mind *and* Revolution in Mind: The Creation of Psychoanalysis

'This ground-breaking book is a must-read for anybody interested in how the meaning of *the human* is being reshaped by digital communication. Who are we becoming as we relate to others and to ourselves via social media, and virtual worlds? How are technological enhancements of human life transforming who we are? This book offers exciting new perspectives on these timely questions that broaden tremendously our way of understanding the media-enhanced world that we have created and is (re-)creating us. Viewing technology as a *pharmakon* that can be both a remedy and a poison, the different chapters offer powerful elucidations of the ways in which the digitalization of our lives has transformed our world and our capacity to experience and imagine. Using insights from both philosophy and psychoanalysis, the book brilliantly explores digital and virtual technology as "a laboratory of subjectivity" that opens up new possibilities for human existence and new configurations of selfhood and otherness. This mesmerizing book is at the forefront of contemporary philosophical discussions of *the human* and *the posthuman*, and raises provocative questions about technology and the future of *humanity* that will spark new debates. A masterpiece.'

**Jose Medina,** *Walter Dill Scott Professor of Philosophy at Northwestern University;* *author of* Speaking from Elsewhere *and* The Epistemology of Resistance

'A brilliant articulation of a philosophy of human virtuality for the digital era, conceived in terms of our psychic drives to massify, fracture, and capture our desires, our self-image, and the densities of our lives. The ambivalence and numinosity of digital life in the era of COVID has not found more significant expression. The flow and stoppage of time, truth and post-truth, reality and hyper-reality, beliefs, concepts, images, politics, film, our ancestral bodily capacities: they are all treated here. A sweeping and insightful grasp of technology to bear on our time. A tour de force.'

**Juliet Floyd,** *Professor of Philosophy at Boston University; author (with Felix Mülhölzer) of* Wittgenstein's Annotations to Hardy's Course of Pure Mathematics

[]{#index_split_000.html_p4}**Human Virtuality and**

**Digital Life**

This book is a psychoanalytic and philosophical exploration of how

the digital is transforming our perception of the world and our

understanding of ourselves.

Drawing on examples from everyday life, myth, and popular culture,

this book argues that virtual reality is only the latest instantiation of the phenomenon of the virtual, which is intrinsic to human being. It

illuminates what is at stake in our understanding of the relationship between the virtual and the real, showing how our present technologies

both enhance and diminish our psychological lives. The authors claim that technology is a pharmakon -- at the same time both a remedy and a

poison -- and in their writing exemplify a method that overcomes the polarization that compels us to regard it either as a liberating force or a dangerous threat in human life. The digital revolution challenges us to reckon with the implications of what is being called our posthuman condition, leaving behind our modern conception of the world as constituted by atemporal essences and reconceiving it instead as one of processes and change. The book's postscript considers the sudden plunge

into the virtual effected by the 2020 global pandemic.

Accessible and wide-reaching, this book will appeal not only to

psychotherapists, psychoanalysts, and philosophers, but anyone

interested in the ways virtuality and the digital are transforming our

contemporary lives.

[]{#index_split_000.html_p14}[**Preface**](#index_split_000.html_p10)

The writing of this book has been an experiment in shared virtuality.

Composing it between two countries -- Peru and the United States -- on

Skype, with a Google Doc between us, we entered one common mind-

space. The immediacy of the other's presence on the shared screen as we

talked and wrote and thought together, generated a singular mode of intimacy that emerged from the virtual, which encouraged more spontaneity, risk-taking, and freedom. The vulnerabilities that are typically activated when sharing one's writing process -- now intensified by the transparency of the virtual medium -- could be lived out in the open, with

less exposure.

Though the digital screen inevitably intensified our narcissism, it also

enabled us to identify more quickly whenever its head slowly reared.

Territorial and proprietary with our thoughts and words at the beginning,

we began to feel less so with time. When we would divide up our tasks,

elaborating on one's own idea or recomposing a paragraph we had

worked on together, each of us would come back with an independently

constructed text that often uncannily echoed the other's, provoking surges of unexpected synergy that resulted in a genuinely hybrid voice,

with one invisible author. We started to notice that sentences almost seemed to write themselves. It felt, in fact, as if something beyond our

individual minds started constellating.

Alive in the strange presence of our digital images on the screen, sometimes blurred and then again sharply clear, sometimes glitching or

trailing behind our words, garbling sounds that echoed or muted

themselves, our bodies were routinely reconstituted into virtual selves.

Welded together in the virtual page, at the pace and rhythm of our tapping keys, our hands would blend our words together into a single

flow. We have been unable to erase the traces that remain of each other's personal idiosyncracies, but that is only proof of the body's resilience and irreducibility to the digital. There is always some trace that will emerge, like a Barthesian "punktum," in the digital image.

When we had the opportunity to write in the same physical location

(whether in Lima or Boston) dealing with the hard reality of our material

[]{#index_split_000.html_p15}xiv *Preface*

lives, the contrast with working in our usual shared digital mindspace was poignant. On those occasions, even though present together --

ironically enough -- we felt more separate. The now-familiar intimacy ushered in by the virtual screen dissipated as we faced each other in our

embodied difference, two separate minds working on a shared project experiencing together the drag of the real. The contrast between the virtual and the embodied modes of interaction -- something we try to capture again and again throughout the book -- was striking and elusive

at the same time. We were no longer dancing on clouds but firmly tethered to the ground.

Initially we were each personally committed to different and some-

times contrary stances. One of us was inside technology, familiar with

its inner workings, and naively optimistic about digital life; the other

stood slightly askance, weary and pessimistic, assiduously resisting its

pull. But as the result of composing in virtual space we discovered and

experienced new thoughts and ideas spontaneously emerging; orient-

ations shifted and -- as two alternating helmsmen aboard a ship

weathering an unpredictable tide -- we found ourselves each oscillating between the various positions. In this liquid environment we began to feel

safe enough to abandon our previous commitments, and follow the ideas

without restriction. We no longer expected the other to remain faithful to

earlier positions and even became critical of what was once previously defended. ("Consistency is the hobgoblin of little minds," Emerson kept

reminding us.) We deliberately resisted the kind of defensive

argumentation so common in discussions about technology which we

have started to recognize as symptomatic of the poison that is part of the

technological pharmakon. In our particular case, we lived that pharmaco-

logical tension both in our writing and digital lives, and in our growing

capacity to surrender our individual convictions and see them from different and even opposing perspectives.

We wish that the readers of our text, regardless of their feelings or

ideas about technology, will be able to let themselves also enter into

this (pharmacologically) fluid space. All the different positions there interact, resonate, and expand each other, rather than oppose, forming a

complex mosaic that gives image to the relationship with technology that we have attempted to forge in the writing of this book.

We have been talking about these issues continuously over 25 years,

and it has taken us nearly a decade to birth the book. The digital revolution has had such profound and far-reaching effects on everyday

life, it could have been a century. But it has also felt like a single blink, for the transformation to the new mode of life that we are exploring

has already become a global fact and it is advancing at lightning speed

with the onset of the pandemic.

**Disclaimer**

We should warn the reader that the words we use are, some of them, borrowed from others. Deleuze's, Freud's, Benjamin's, Flusser's, or Winnicott's words will appear under their original guise, but may very well acquire a life of their own. These borrowed terms repeat their original meanings, (and so they are duly attributed to their authors in their inception here) but, as with any repetition in a new setting, they may be

called to perform quite different functions from those of the originals.

This may cause confusion, and may seem, at some points, to do a dis-service to the original authors, but it is in the nature of the rhizomatic field from which we hope to be writing, that chaos and cosmos (chao-smos), understanding and confusion together hold the tension.

No expectations should be placed on us or our words to adhere to their

same original meanings, for that would only perpetuate the repetition of

the same. Here, they may turn out to be quite different in the end. To put

it in the language we use in this book, our writing "in-corporates," rather than simply "re-inscribes" the concepts, so variations may appear at any

point and anywhere in the text.

[]{#index_split_000.html_p17}[**Acknowledgements**](#index_split_000.html_p10)

Everything would have been very different were it not for our families

who, in one way or another, nurtured us and put up with our constant

preoccupation with the virtual. We want to thank Magali, Art, Antonio,

Susan, Rachel, and Greti for their love and support; Lisa (undoubtedly

our celestial muse), whose voice so often tempered and grounded us; Eve

and Isaac, who, immersed in their digital lives, taught us more than they

could have suspected.

Our work has also benefited from the keen intelligence of many friends

and colleagues. Mario Montalbetti, whose careful reading and incisive comments on an early draft of the book confirmed to us that we were on a

good track; Humphrey Morris, who, in spirited conversation, challenged

and inspired us to push further and think deeper; Eduardo Villanueva, whose expertise in media studies helped clarify some issues in the first two chapters of the book; Marjorie and Doug Kinsey who, at one remove from

the everyday digital, gave us a fresh perspective from which to see more

clearly. We are both also indebted to Charles E. Scott, whom we met in

the Philosophy department at Vanderbilt University in the eighties, and

whose influence has been with us ever since.

We would also like to mention for supporting us in various ways: Richard Ying, Gordon Bearn, Jorge Villacorta, Greg Shaw, Stephen Pinals,

[**Prelude**](#index_split_000.html_p10)

The astounding omnipresence of the virtual in contemporary con-

sciousness is radically restructuring our psychology, changing our

societies and culture, and having profound effects on who we are, how we behave with one another, and on the kind of world we are

inhabiting. This is clearly evident in the indispensable and ubiquitous

smartphone, the tiny home for quick and always accessible virtuality;

in the screens that have become permanent fixtures in our houses, our

offices, our social spaces, and, of course, our pockets; in our increas-

ingly automated ways of life; and in our growing cohabitation with

innumerable virtual presences and artificial intelligences.

Any adolescent, merely 30 years ago, had to go past the censoring

mediation of a parent or authority figure in order to reach the person

they were pursuing: "Let it be their sibling who answers the phone and not their parent!" was their common prayer. Back then, you could

stay out all day. Nobody could reach you and you lived undisturbed

and disconnected from anyone until you were back home.

Today, things are very different. Having a permanent line to the

other is something we have come to take for granted. Thanks to our

digital devices, we can chat with the person we want, reach them directly and immediately, unencumbered by any mediating presence.

We can't even remember, much less imagine now, a life without a

smartphone connecting us all to each other, like an umbilical cord that we are unable (and by now most likely unwilling) to shed.

Conversations, too, had a different dynamic. They flowed unin-

terrupted by virtual promptings, and whenever voids in memory or

information cropped up, they were not replaced by the immediate

consultation of the Google oracle; rather, they were endured together,

opening spaces of interaction that could be personally enriching in ways that seem almost impossible nowadays. When the last pre-digital

generation dies out, and their time becomes something for the history

books, our children and their children will have only known a time in

[]{#index_split_000.html_p21}2 *Introduction*

which mind and psyche were thoroughly permeated by a digital

sensibility.

The speed and instantaneousness of digital communication radi-

cally unsettles both time and space. "Real time" and "virtual space"

are new categories in our existence that introduce dramatic transfor-

mations in our form of life. The digital spreads through all our interactions and makes the virtual a space where we can now share

experiences, with anyone, anywhere, something previously unim-

aginable. The difference between the public and the private that was

so essential to modern life and culture is gradually disappearing. And

in the compulsive desire it has ignited to expose our most intimate thoughts and feelings in the social media, we may be witnessing today

the gradual disappearance of the boundaries that give shape and

meaning to our collective lives.

As the god of communication, inventor of language, maker of borders,

Hermes presides over the virtual. But he is also the trickster and thief,

misdirecting us when he is supposed to guide, disabling us when he is

supposed to enable. Hermetic undercurrents wind their way through

our contemporary absorption in the digital. The virtual world provides a

screen where we are tricked into believing that all our wishes and desires, our passions and aspirations can be fulfilled and hence made "real"

without the work and labor required by actual life.

It is not surprising, therefore, that in such a short time, we have so

unhesitatingly and uncritically surrendered to the power of digital technology. Our living in the "digital-now" -- as we could call the immediacy of our digital lives -- has transformed our relationship to

temporality, scrambling the links between past, present, and future, making us often impervious to the passage of time and changing our

experience and understanding of history.

McLuhan pointed out, already in the 1960s, that the media had

become all-important. The ways the new technologies modulated the

message began to re-define not just the mode, but the very nature of

communication. *How* things were said started to take precedence over (and even make obsolete or irrelevant) *what* was said. "The medium,"

McLuhan prophetically proclaimed, "is the message," thus antici-

pating the situation -- nowadays pervasive -- where truth no longer matters, and where the way something is transmitted -- whether it be

through instant messaging, the TV news cycle, blogs, webpages,

Twitter, or Instagram accounts, etc. -- not only transforms what we communicate, but also reshapes it, beginning to determine how we

think and what we believe.

In the vertiginous contingency of our digital lives, what really mat-

ters is less the message than that mediatic power that makes it ripple

through the collective mind. Accuracy, objective representation, proof

or argument are literally irrelevant when faced with a "trending topic."

[]{#index_split_000.html_p22} *Introduction* 3

The fake-news wars are predicated on the volatility of the social media

that makes it easy to manipulate, or sway and convince the public.

Democratic elections everywhere have become living proof of this

power. Immediate impact displaces actual facts in this bewildering time

of "post-truth."

Changing our very understanding of knowledge and ignorance, of

subjectivity and objectivity, digital technology is reforging our needs

and interests, affecting all areas of human experience. Our traditional

habits and assumptions, our culture, our politics, our philosophy, and

our morals are subverted by the multiple new forms of digital com-

munication proliferating in our lives today. These profound trans-

formations have been so rapid that we are only now beginning to

notice and slowly assimilate their psychic effect. So much of it still remains unconscious, that it becomes important not only to attend to

what seem to be the digital's very clear perils, but also to try to discern what may be its still unknown or unseen potential. Indeed, we might

be witnessing an enhancement and extension of our existence beyond

anything we are as yet able to imagine.

[**1 Human virtuality**](#index_split_000.html_p10)

In this book, we have made the concept of the virtual the fulcrum of

our whole investigation. Although we all have learned to think of the virtual as a second "world," an artificially constructed environment or object that emulates, and sometimes amazingly mimics

reality, it is important to see that it is not only that. Indeed, the concept of the virtual has a long history in philosophy, as well as crucial significations for psychoanalysis; it brings with it issues of time, embodiment, and mortality, shedding an important light on

what it means to be human. The virtual, then, as a concept, as an idea and as a force in nature, packs a forceful multi-dimensional punch whose impact we will explore throughout the book. But we

begin here, with its most familiar usage, which is derived from our

contemporary digital world.

The "virtual" in the term "virtual reality" serves to qualify something as secondary, fake or unreal, even something illusory. Virtual objects in cyberspace are mere copies that only represent or replicate

reality but are themselves not quite real. A virtual kiss, a virtual flower, a virtual friend, for example, are less than a real kiss, an actual flower, or a friend. Shooting at someone in a videogame is not the same as

shooting a real person. We have naturally gauged the "reality" of the

virtual in terms of how close it comes to the empirical real. The un-

derlying assumption is, of course, that the virtual and the real will never be the same. But it is precisely that unquestioned belief in the

radical separateness of real and virtual that needs to be contested.

[]{#index_split_000.html_p23}4 *Introduction*

Ironically enough, our digital lives are forcing us to seriously question

it, and may in the end reveal as utterly mistaken our assumption that

the virtual, like the pilot fish on the shark, is parasitic on the real.

In striking opposition to our contemporary notion of the virtual as

denoting something false or illusory, the pre-digital understanding of

the virtual has more to do with force. As Brian [Massumi (2014)](#index_split_000.html_p37) observes, "virtual" is derived from the Latin word for strength or potency,

so that the primary definition of the virtual is not simulation, as we usually assume, but "potentiality," which, as Aristotle taught us, is that

which may come to be, the latent potency of a thing. The virtual should be understood, not as an illusory, artificial reality, but as the *dimension of possibility* inherent to all reality. As Massumi puts it,

\[The virtual\] concerns the potency in what is, by virtue of which it

really comes to be. It connotes a force of existence: the press of the

next, coming to pass. The virtual pertains to the power to be,

pressing, passing, eventuating into ever new forms, in a cavalcade

of emergence. (p. 55)

Technology has always contended with the emergent force of the

virtual, its open possibilities, as something it must mold or modulate.

But each new modulation confirms that the potential of the virtual in

its "cavalcade of emergence" always surpasses the technological. Every

technology draws from this prime matter that is the virtual and brings

something out of it that was never there before.

In the shift that took place with the advent of writing, for example,

when the oral tradition was superseded by the scribal, the new tech-

nological modulation of the virtual changed the topography of

communication, for in writing it was no longer required to happen in

a shared (physical) space, nor in real time. The scribal modulation dislocated time and vanished space. The book could be read by

anyone, anywhere in the world. Leaving behind the intimacy of the

oral and confining it to the solitude of each individual's mind, it paradoxically broadened the range of the exchange.

With the digital modulation, another topographical shift takes

place. No matter where we are we can directly interact with the other

in virtual space, restoring the immediate presence of the oral that was

lost to scribality. In bringing forth its own unique modulation, each

technological advance, in its particular configuration of time, space,

and matter, displaces the modulation that has preceded it, laying the

ground for innumerable new shifts and transformations, thus

confirming the inexhaustibility of the virtual.

The history of the virtual is as long as that of language, as we will see

in the brief history of the media [in Part I](#index_split_000.html_p38) of the book, so the meaning

[]{#index_split_000.html_p24} *Introduction* 5

of the virtual does not follow from the advent of digital technology or

the invention of the virtual world. Our ability to speak, to articulate

experience in words, and so "lift," as it were, the empirical world into

the abstract dimension of concepts and images, marks the emergence

of the human virtual. It has always referred to the potentiality that subjectivity adds to sensible experience, and, as the realm of the mind,

has been the concern of philosophy since the beginning.

We will distinguish the "human virtual," that mental space wherein

we are able to think, imagine, fantasize, invent the world, from the

"digital virtual" also a place for thought, fantasy and imagination, yet

located in that virtual space behind our screens, that we call virtual

reality. But let us not forget that both the human and the digital virtual emerge out of the very immanence of our lived existence as mortal, embodied beings in an actual world, in other words, the inexhaustible virtual itself. The virtual *tout court*, moreover, distinct from the human and the digital virtual, is the source of change and

temporal movement that cuts through the world and underwrites the

mind. It is precisely the fate of our relation to the virtual in the age of digital technology that is the central concern of the book.

[***a Virtuality and psychoanalysis***](#index_split_000.html_p10)

The digital virtual is another version -- expressed in a different register

and with a different set of terms -- of what has also been an object of

profound concern for psychoanalysis. Although psychoanalysis does

not speak of virtual reality *per se*, it does speak of psychic reality, dream and play space, fantasy and reverie, and the central role of the

imagination in constituting the real. Indeed, human virtuality could

be seen, from this perspective, as nothing other than the always de-

centered play between the free and open realm of autonomous desire

and fantasy (i.e., the unconscious psyche), and the conscious mind.

Our repeated turn toward the digital in the course of everyday life

(searching, checking, updating, and posting) has significant parallels

to the inwardly directed turn toward our own minds (thinking, fan-

tasizing, and dreaming). Pre-digitally, in a less distracted era, we may

remember (no doubt for some, tinged with a certain amount of nos-

talgia) that it was far easier than it is now to be attuned to an inwardly

generated cognitive and emotional space where thoughts, fantasies

and ideas could spontaneously play out in the mind's eye. This interior space of psychic life, which includes the figures that appear in

dream and fantasy form, as well as reveries, thoughts and ideations, is

what we will call the *virtual within.* It is from this well-spring of internally sourced virtuality that virtual reality technologies seem to draw their dynamism. The virtual-within, in contrast with the artifice

of the digital media, springs from the vital spontaneity of the

[]{#index_split_000.html_p25}6 *Introduction*

imaginative mind. Whereas "virtual reality" arises from the collecti-

vized archive of human subjectivity as it is now assembled in the Internet, the virtual within is sourced in the interior of the in-dividualized, embodied self and depends on experience, memory, and

the creative workings of fantasy.

The difference this makes to our experience of the virtual is illustrated by the case of Frank, a psychotherapy client who once had one

of those crystal clear dreams, in which he found himself taking a walk

in the woods with his father and speaking to him as he was before his

mind and body were ravaged by Parkinson's. In the dream, he was

thinking to himself, "Yes, this is how my father used to walk, this is

how he was physically present, ambling through the natural world,

before he got the disease." Frank was very moved by this dream, as it

resonated with a sad and split-off part of himself that was not quite

ready to mourn what he was losing. Some time later, Frank spoke of

the experience he had had upon seeing old family videos of his father

before Parkinson's. Although he was affectively moved, Frank

observed that the images on the screen did not have the same emo-

tional weight or valence for him. There was something missing. But

what exactly was the difference, what is the missing experience? Is there something about the creative power of the dream, as an unbidden image that comes out of the depths of one's own being, that is

different from the technological registration of a past event? How do

we make sense of the difference between the way the psyche creates

virtual-reality worlds in the form of dream images, fantasies, reveries,

flights of fancy in one's mind, etc., and the digital realm of imaginative, affective, and emergent reality that is materialized in the vir-

tual world? What is the vantage point from which we see the

superiority of the dream experience over its video counterpart?

Today, of course, the psyche is constituting the digital, both individually and collectively. The unconscious force of our psychic

lives structures the particular ways in which each of us invites the digital into the most intimate aspects of our subjective being. But the digital is also transforming our experience of psychic reality. The

imagination of an event on the screen weaves new associations and

meanings and so re-fashions the actuality of the event itself, closely

paralleling the re-fashioning of reality that takes place in our inner

lives. This paradox -- the psyche simultaneously constituting reality

and being constituted by the digital modulation of experience -- is our point of access for probing what is happening to the virtual in

this new world.

In order to hold open a space in which to explore the difference between the digital-virtual and the virtuality inherent to our psychic

lives (i.e., the virtual within), we will continually keep in mind their

resonances and dissonances. In other words, we will pinpoint where

[]{#index_split_000.html_p26} *Introduction* 7

they seem to draw together and where they seem to split apart.

Nowhere is this poignant play between them better exemplified today

than in the dissociation that happens when we use our digital devices.

In opening up the laptop or peering at the phone, we seek contact with a virtual realm that is not immediately available in the present,

just as we do, at any moment, when we inwardly shift our attention

toward our own thoughts and feelings. In both cases -- the turn toward

our mind and the turn toward our devices -- we dissociate in order to

enter another kind of mindspace or even to flee the empirical present.

But, in our digitally permeated split-screen lives, we are becoming evermore dissociative creatures, our attention constantly wavering,

here one minute, gone the next. Yet all of this consciousness-

fragmenting behavior that plagues us in our digital engagements,

takes place against the inescapable backdrop of the human psyche's

vulnerability to distraction, splitting and dissociation. [1](#index_split_000.html_p36) If, as Freud contends, unconscious life is intimately tied to psychic defenses, then

we have to explore what it is that we are obliged to evade about ourselves, about others, and the world, in order to stay so immersed in

the digital flow.

We will see how our fixation with our digital devices makes us blind

to the impact they are having on our affective and erotic lives. In the

vital interplay between the erotic possibilities of the virtual and the everyday exigencies of reality, the digital makes desire more familiar and accessible while at the same time dissociatively estranging us from

its unconscious roots. At the most fundamental level of embodied ex-

istence, we will argue, eros and desire fuel our virtual attachments, not

just in the ubiquity of Internet pornography, but also in virtual shop-

ping, browsing, recording, chatting, and all social networking.

We will not systematically differentiate creative from pathological

dissociation through sociological or empirical investigation. Rather, we aim to think more broadly about what is being split and what is

being dissociated, as well as what is being reconfigured and re-

connected when the digital so pervasively enters into the innermost

dimensions of our acquisitive and erotic lives. This takes us into the

depths of the problematic regarding the changing relationship be-

tween the virtual and the real in the digital era (the theme [of Part II](#index_split_001.html_p80) of the book) and will also help us understand how our use of digitality

both serves us, on the one hand, to escape and, on the other, to potentiate our engagement with the virtual.

[***b Virtuality and philosophy***](#index_split_000.html_p10)

It is by now increasingly evident that traditional Western metaphysics

is no longer adequate for our contemporary world. The digital age is

drastically changing not just our psychology but also our ontology,

[]{#index_split_000.html_p27}8 *Introduction*

the basic makeup of our world. We need only consider the previously

unheard-of entities and relations that begin to people it: virtual space

and "real time," digital screens and smartphones, telematic action and

perception, cybersex and virtual objects, hard disks and holograms, live photographs, downloads and .gifs, algorithms and bitcoins,

"ghosting" and "phubbing" and "blocking" and "sharing," and so on.

In this alternative universe, our understanding of how things are or-

dered is rapidly and radically changing. David [Weinberger (2007),](#index_split_000.html_p37) for example, considers how the lay-out of an office supply store is

changed in the digital era:

Instead of atoms that take up room, \[this space\] is made of bits.

Instead of making us walk long aisles, in the digital world

everything is only a few clicks away ... \[But\] something much

larger is at stake than how we lay out our stores. The physical limitations that silently guide the organization of an office supply

store also guide how we organize our businesses, our government,

our schools. They have guided -- and limited -- how we organize

knowledge itself \[....\] Now, for the first time in history, we are able

to arrange our concepts without the silent limitations of the

physical. (pp. 6--7)

The result of this ontological expansion is a world that forces and stretches the categories by which we normally order and give meaning

to experience, and slowly undermines our standards, shattering some

of our most familiar presuppositions and criteria. But when our

clothes no longer fit our bodies, as Galileo once said, we must look for

others that do. So, we need to find a new paradigm through which to

make sense of this changing order.

From the beginning of time, each technology has inevitably

modified the ways we structure and find meaning in what we ex-

perience. Each new technological innovation either extends and so

potentiates the previous one, as, for instance, the printing press did

to writing, or film did to photography or else, a pre-existing tech-

nology is destabilized by what comes next, as different perceptions

and experiences emerge that shatter old orders and force the es-

tablishment of new criteria and a reshuffling of perceived reality.

We can see this, for example, in how the affective intensity of oral

communication was disrupted by the new ways of ordering our

thinking imposed by the linearity of the written text. Each new

technological innovation introduces novel forms of modulation by

which the virtual is now actualized, thus transforming our per-

ception. The development of impressionistic painting, for instance,

resulted in a perception of reality not in brushstrokes, as the pre-

vious styles had done, but in points or smudges of color that

[]{#index_split_000.html_p28} *Introduction* 9

affected our reception and apprehension of the world. The virtual is

actualized and new aspects are made visible by the powers of each

new medium.

In the particular case of the latest technologies, as we will see, as-

pects of orality and scribablity are further potentiated, but also shat-

tered by the new ontology introduced by the digital medium.

Whereas, from the scribal perspective, the world was made up of

permanent substances and qualities, the digital turns this worldview

on its head. The metaphysics of permanence that underwrites the

modern mindset is displaced by a world of processes in constant

movement. Thus, change -- which had been seen as an illusion of

sensible experience unveiled by means of scientific knowledge -- be-

comes the very essence of the world within the digital framework.

This current medium provides us with new modulations of reality --

new ways in which the virtual is actualized -- that broaden our perception and deepen our understanding of experience. We can now

modulate the temporality of an event and either accelerate or de-

celerate it, thus revealing aspects of its makeup that were otherwise imperceptible. For example, the action of peeling an orange seen

again through a slow motion video allows us to begin not only to notice things that remained unconscious before, but, precisely because of that, leads to weaving experience into ever more complicated

brocades that enrich reality.

Unknowingly anticipating the novel modulations of the virtual that

the digital media introduce us to, Wittgenstein, Benjamin, and

Deleuze rebel against the fixed and sedimented concepts of substances

and qualities inherent to the modern worldview. For this reason we

will appeal and enter in dialogue with these three thinkers. Their experiments in language and methodologies unsettle our conceptions

of identity and permanence, of space and time, and reality and illu-

sion. They provide us with valuable tools that are more suitable for the

mode of thinking that emerges with the digital and useful for finding

our way through the thicket of problematics that begin to arise with

it. Even without having any inkling of the hegemony of digital life that has occurred in our times, they were all intent, in different ways

as we will see, on entering into the dance of the virtual and the actual,

where -- liberated by the temporal movement of the real -- the virtual

becomes a new creation itself.

As the temporality of the things in the world becomes central to the

modulation of the digital, the issue of whether what we see is true or

not, authentic or illusory, becomes secondary or even dispensable. As

[Massumi (2014)](#index_split_000.html_p37) observes, "the question of perception is no longer one of truth or illusion, but of differing modes of reality, in the movement of emergence through which the forms of experience

[]{#index_split_000.html_p29}10 *Introduction*

come to pass" (p. 56). The new modes of actualizing virtuality no longer depend on a fixed representational relationship with what already is, but rather constitute a wholly new production of experience.

The actualized virtuality that constitutes the ontology of the virtual

world makes it evident, that contrary to what the modern metaphysic

of presence suggested, the virtual need not be always considered in the framework of original and copy. As [Massumi (2014)](#index_split_000.html_p37) asserts of the virtual, from a Deleuzian post-representational perspective, "\[f\]ar

from \[being\] a replica of the real, \[it\] is the very motor of its continued becoming" (pp. 55--6).

And if we return to the notion of the virtual as potential, then the virtual is a potential that "never appears as such. What appears is that which it gives rise to -- which is precisely not it, but its fulfillment" (p. 56).

What we are dealing with in the book then is not primarily "virtual reality" (in the digital sense), but the reality of virtuality, that potential of which Massumi speaks, which is nothing other than the inscrutable and

inexhaustible immanence of the virtual, where we are unable to discern

anything prior to the new modulations, but which is the source of all emerging meanings. The virtual as potentiality is always behind what we

perceive, underwriting it all with pure possibility; it is situated behind perception as its invisible double, out of which reality emerges. "Potential is \[...\] never actually present as such \[...\] It is as evasive of the present as it is effective in its formation" (p. 56).

That is why, in what follows, we continually return to the question

of the negative or unsayable or -- in psychoanalytic terms -- the unrepresentable, as manifestations of this potential which never appears

as such. The paradox of virtuality is found in the fact that "no sooner

has it disappeared into its own fulfilment than it makes itself felt again

in the press toward a next" [(Massumi, 2014,](#index_split_000.html_p37) p. 56). Much like the unconscious in psychoanalysis, the virtual has effects in the world but

does not appear as such. Virtuality is a hermetic messenger, invisibly

present in all transformation.

The mind, the spirit, and the soul all refer to the human virtual, that

dimension of possibility that the temporal opens in our existence. Insofar

as the mind is in unstoppable movement and change, it is permeated by

absence; it is grounded in primordial, constitutive loss. As [Nusselder](#index_split_000.html_p37)

[(2014)](#index_split_000.html_p37) points out, it "contains an emptiness or negativity" (p. 74).

That the mind itself is thoroughly permeated by the virtual means

human experience is haunted by lack and incompleteness. This

intimate relationship between virtuality and absence invokes the

existential dimensions of the virtual,

Virtuality introduces an "openness" (otherness) in human exis-

tence: the dimension of infinity and freedom. Because of this

"openness" human existence cannot entirely be grasped on an

[]{#index_split_000.html_p30} *Introduction* 11

objective level (as an object). On the ontological plane, this

openness or "wound" of the human subject is the condition of

possibility of new configurations of humanity. [(Nusselder,](#index_split_000.html_p37)

[2014,](#index_split_000.html_p37) p. 80)

Nusselder places at the heart of our virtuality a wound, which we want

to identify with mortal contingency and ontological lack. At the very

center of the digital there remains an irreducible negativity that constitutes the very possibility of life, and the human meaning we make of it. This is another pivotal area of experience that we want to

keep an eye on as we probe the kind of virtuality that arises out of the

digital. What does it do to our wound, to our lack, to that which is

imperfect and incomplete in us? And do the new configurations of

humanity that arise from this age open or close us to that wound? Do

they serve as a balm or poison?

[**2 Digital life**](#index_split_000.html_p10)

We find ourselves today in a perpetually fracturing set of discourses

around the question of technology. Some will see what is hap-

pening in the digital age as a further stage in a continuous progression of civilization, as simply one more (giant) step in the

single path of technological progress toward an enhanced

humanity. According to that view, the new digital technologies

extend our power, enhance our faculties, as technologies have al-

ways done. But although they do so with ever greater sophistica-

tion, they still remain on the same plane as what came before.

Others, however, will see that "progress" as an illusion, the so-

phistication brought about by each new technological discovery

merely amounting to new faces behind which lurks the familiar; in

other words, the deeper fact beyond any apparent advance always

comes back to the same incorrigible human nature. So here also

there is no incommensurable difference with anything that has

passed before. Others, on the contrary, see the digital indeed as a

world-defining leap, as the beginning of a glorious potentiation of

the species, as the transhumanists, with their expectation, for ex-

ample, of escaping organic life by uploading the human mind into

computers. Still others, also affirming such a quantum change, will

see in it instead the seeds of human demise, a dangerous and re-

gressive experiment that fundamentally threatens our very nature

or is even the beginning of the end of what we have known as

human.

We bear witness to the stubborn propensity to polarize in the ada-

mant advocacy of any one of these positions, perhaps the most pernicious obstacle we face when considering technology. It is difficult to

[]{#index_split_000.html_p31}12 *Introduction*

have a conversation about the impact of the digital world on our psychic lives without quickly falling into one of these camps, replacing

dialogue with argumentation, often leading to frustration or a narrow

manicheism. We become tendentious and are forced to choose be-

tween one side or another, contributing, among other things, to the generational divide where adults are confronted by the passionate opposition of youth. Typically, parents will rebuke their children, "Look

at what is happening to you. You live inside your phone" and their children will disdainfully dismiss them, convinced that they will never

understand. One must admit, as one strives to keep an even keel, that

sometimes it seems undeniable that we are making progress, that just as

the scribal culture enriched orality, the digital is also opening new horizons to the human and therefore enhancing our faculties and experience. But then, at other times, when we see how humans respond

to each new technological advance, the same hybris and misjudgement

rear their ugly head, and all changes suddenly become nothing but cosmetic. We confess however, that we are inclined to believe that the

digital, in opening a new dimension of reality, i.e. the virtual world, is

bringing with it a radical transformation, a quantum leap that is changing the kind of creatures that we are as well as our place in the

world. It is hard not to see these changes as unprecedented in

the history of mankind, giving us the power to determine the future of

the planet. But this too may be a mirage, as everyday life has suddenly

become so inundated by the new virtualities of the digital that we cannot see clearly anymore. Thus, we must shed our certainties and keep the question open considering the possibility that we are indeed

entering a posthuman time. As Žižek lucidly writes,

... one should abandon the old humanist idea that, whatever

happens, a certain form of human dignity will be maintained or

reasserted. This is simply cheating. Such a perspective assumes

dogmatically that a basic notion of humanity will somehow

survive all these socio-technological transformations. \[...\] What I

am convinced of is that if these tendencies continue, then the

very status of what it means to be a human being will change.

Even the most elementary things, like speaking language, emo-

tional sense and so on will be affected. Nothing should be taken

for granted and it would be inconsequent to be either optimistic

or pessimistic. [(Žižek and Daly, 2004,](#index_split_000.html_p37) p. 85)

Žižek is resisting as folly any judgment that rests on our present hu-

manist conception, but it is that very folly that causes the polarization

that infects our current discourse on technology. In that light, we intend to approach the uncharted territory opened by virtual reality

with full receptiveness, and neither optimistically nor pessimistically.

[]{#index_split_000.html_p32} *Introduction* 13

No matter how you understand the meaning of digital technology

and the virtual for life today, the insistence upon advocating for one

particular view over another inevitably blinds us to the utter complexity at the limit of discourse. Any book that addresses the question

of digital technology in our current era (and there are scores and scores of them) faces this immense difficulty. Very few accounts of digitality demonstratively stay open in the face of that tension. [2](#index_split_000.html_p36)

Instead, they take a stand and stubbornly defend it at all costs.

Alternatively, we intend to enter into a broader and more compre-

hensive dynamic that reflects the primordial tensions of the digital age, never wholly represented by any one systematic discourse or any

one certain position. We hope rather to articulate these tensions

performatively, in a language attuned to what is inevitably uncertain

and ultimately unknowable.

Our assumption is that serious psychological and philosophical

engagement will help to overcome this powerful tendency toward

dichotomization. We thus offer a different approach to these ques-

tions. Whether emancipatory or regressive, optimistic or pessimistic,

our method for breaking through these polarizing positions is to give

careful and equal voice to all stances, so that their dialogue can speak

out of the many-stranded tensions between them. We will be sus-

pending the dialectic to counter the splits that binary logic seems to

impose on us and the demand for closure. We aim instead to enter phenomenologically into the thicket of contradictions and indeterminacies that always shadows and shapes whatever tentative

conclusions we may draw about the digital.

In an age when everything is so rapidly changing, it is essential to

provide a framing of the issues that allows us to encounter the com-

plexity of technology. We use the word *encounter* deliberately to distinguish argumentation about the effects of the digital (which pushes

us onto one side or another) from existentially entering the question,

addressing what is happening at the level of our being. We explore the

intersection of the virtual world with the thinking/feeling body and

psyche, and drawing together philosophy and psychoanalysis, we

enact a mode of writing in which thinking, affect and lived experience

are held alongside each other in their own complicated and often

conflicting realities. In our best (and of course imperfect) attempt to

relinquish any side, we are not only addressing the problem of fore-

closure, but also resisting the impulse to split thinking and affect that

weighs down so much academic writing.

In our view, the Luddites who bury their head in the sand and re-

fuse to engage with what is happening, because they don't like it and

won't have any part of it, are as confused and problematic as the techno-liberationists who unthinkingly turn toward technology to

avoid having to bear the limitations of embodied life in a world that

[]{#index_split_000.html_p33}14 *Introduction*

seems to be out of control. There is always something unconscious in

any one perspective, as any single approach to the question of tech-

nology implicitly negates another. Perhaps it is our very human inclination for closure, as well as an implicit need to preserve a single

foundational substance (whether it be the real or the virtual), that makes it difficult to live in this tension. Instead of holding it, we polarize and either fantasize optimistically about digital eternity, fleeing from bodily weight, or battle skeptically and tragically against

the digital, which we see as a fever raging in our time and numbing us

to life.

[**3 Poison and remedy**](#index_split_000.html_p10)

The Internet, through its capacity to cut across unlimited swaths of time and space, takes us out of ourselves into a much wider world of

people, things, and meanings, engaging a multiplicity of perspectives

on the "other." And yet, at the very same time, nothing more dramatically exposes a process of narcissistic inflation than time spent on-line, as it situates the self at the center, radically severing it from

what is other. The digital enhances and enriches human experience

while at the same time flattening and diminishing it. The Greeks gave

this paradox -- of being at the same time a remedy and a poison, si-

multaneously healing us and making us ill --, the name "pharmakon."

Invoking Derrida's ground-breaking essay on the pharmakon,

*Plato's Pharmacy*, [Does and Clarke (1999)](#index_split_000.html_p37) write:

Like writing or drawing, each virtual-reality technology is a

pharmakon -- cure, remedy, potion, drug, poison, magic, etc.

They reli(e)ve memory and enhance experience and sensation,

but in so doing, they facilitate forgetfulness, dis-ablement, and

sensory deprivation. (p. 264)

Our investigations follow what we accordingly characterize as a

pharmacological method; we attend simultaneously and system-

atically to both the shadow and the light of the digital. The pharmakon will serve as a guiding principle for holding the tension of these opposites. Like a discipline of double vision, a contemplative exercise in paradoxical thinking, the pharmakon will help us situate

and explore our thought about the digital and all its related phenomena -- from video games, and social media to robots and Internet

pornography, consumerism and the ubiquitous presence of the

smartphone, etc. -- from within this paradox. There is a logic to the

pharmakon that we will be on the watch for, "according to which

what supplements or supports at the same time weakens, what

cultivates at the same time undermines..." [(Russell, 2020,](#index_split_000.html_p37) p. 104).

[]{#index_split_000.html_p34} *Introduction* 15

We do not intend to provide practical guidelines for dealing with

digital life. We are convinced instead that the kind of understanding

of technology we aim for should be existentially demanding as well

as transformative. The reader might experience in confronting this

text, at times, a sensation of vertigo, but that is the very nature of

what we are proposing to do. We seek not only an intellectual exercise of understanding, but also a concrete encounter with the

paradox at the root of the digital, which is increasingly permeating

our everyday. We don't intend to defend a theory or to take a position, as much as make evident the pharmacological complexity of

the virtual and our digital lives.

All technologies of communication and information poison us with

the illusion of permanence but also cure us from that illusion by ex-

posing the inherent spectrality of passing time. They may simply be

forms by which we confront the ephemerality of temporal existence,

and try to deal with its passing or evade it. They express our need to

manage loss and oblivion and are all symptoms of our complex and

evolving relation with mortality.

In light of our technologies, the mythological figure of Pygmalion

provides a fitting image for reflecting upon our relation with death and mortality. The mythic sculptor is said to have replaced Aphrodite,

the object of his love, with a perfect sculpted image of the goddess,

just as we secretly hope to replace our imperfect world with the concoctions of our ever more sophisticated genetics, neuroscience and

cybernetics. And just as Pygmalion avoids emotional commitment

and vulnerability by fabricating a perfect version of his love through

his art, we too attempt to escape contingency, up to the point of overcoming our own mortality. Technology is Pygmalionic.

In our Western tradition, we habitually deny time and death. We feel

a need to make every change predictable, and hence controlled through

scientific theory, political ideology, medical science, and so on, since each unpredictable change always prefigures death. In this sense, we could say that Western culture has been anchored in the melancholic replacement of the ephemeral passing present with the sedimented past.

We call this intrinsic melancholy "the Pygmalionic Impulse," for, just like Pygmalion, our culture replaces fleeting experience with mental representations (concepts or images) as if, in fact, intent on preserving

the object to avoid suffering its irremediable loss [(Krebs, 2004).](#index_split_000.html_p37)

But technology is also Promethean: As the fire stolen from the gods

earns the reckless titan and his transgression the implacable sanction,

technology contains within itself an inner curse that stokes the titanic

excess of our nature. In our exploration of the virtual, and in our at-

tempt to grant it its fullest expression, we hope to engender in the reader both the experience of its hermetic paradox, as much as its Promethean ambition and its chastening.

[]{#index_split_000.html_p35}16 *Introduction*

Psychoanalytically and philosophically speaking, we may conjecture

that our propensity to closure and rational completeness stems from a

tendency in us to control what is to come, unable to deal with the uncertainty or the openness and fragmentariness of life. Here, the virtual is our teacher, provocateur, and guide, since it is an intrinsically

open field that resists our systematic tendency to safely encapsulate it

in any closed or finished theory. To truly allow the virtual to reveal itself, we must find ways to confront its utter unrepresentability, to open ourselves to the slap it brings to our intellectual profligacy that

wants to reduce vital experience to a set of concepts.

The digital throws us into a dynamically changing reality that demands from us a different kind of thinking that explicitly acknowledges death as an unavoidable burden of creatures of language capable

of thought; it makes thinking and representing a form of mourning.

And yet, because the digital throws us into a relationship with the world that is always mediated, it numbs our relationship to temporality

and impinges upon our capacity to more fully embrace the flux of time.

Our ability to digitally control and manipulate time blocks our mortal

awareness and often prevents us from reaching reality.

The digital modulates in completely original and momentous ways

our relationship to the virtual dimensions of our own being. As the

new technologies of information and communication continuously

thrust us into the particular dance between virtual and actual the digital enacts, it brings us face-to-face with our mortality. But then what effect is the digital revolution having on our relationship to loss

and the passing away of things? How does it enhance our relationship

to temporality and, conversely, how does it numb us to death?

[**Coda**](#index_split_000.html_p10)

At the beginning of the second decade of the millenium it may be time for us to think of technology not so much in terms of the power

it gives us to subject Nature to our will, but as an outgrowth of our

very life; an outgrowth that is instituting radically new modes of being in the world that respond to the unwieldy forces of the cultural

unconscious unleashed by our technological action.

Walter [Benjamin (1979)](#index_split_000.html_p37) distinguished between technology conceived as an instrument of domination and technology as a means of

reflection. As he says, many assume that its purpose is the mastery of

nature, but this may be completely mistaken. He reflects thus:

\[...\] who would trust a cane wielder who proclaimed the mastery

of children by adults to be the purpose of education? Is not

education above all the indispensable ordering of the relationship

between generations and therefore mastery, if we are to use the

[]{#index_split_000.html_p36} *Introduction* 17

term, of that relationship and not of children? And likewise,

*technology is not the mastery of nature, but of the relation between* *nature and man.* (pp. 103--4)

Technology has as little to do with mastery over nature as the teacher

has with subduing their students. If technology is to be mastery over

anything, Benjamin suggests, it would have to be over our relation to

the world, over how to manage or live with the new nature that it opens around us. But the blindness Benjamin is pointing to is still blatantly clear in our own relation with the world. We should learn to

see, therefore, technology as an event of life that speaks to (and from)

the deepest levels of human consciousness. Understood in this way,

any event in the world -- whether it be the roadkill we see on our way

back from the country, the burning of the Amazon forests, or the phenomenon of "fake news" -- insofar as it involves our technological

presence in the world, becomes a sign from which to learn to see technology not merely as a tool we can use for our advantage or even

our survival. What this calls for instead is a change in mentality, from

the straight-forward Apollonian directness of the scientific ethos, to something more hermetic, like the obliqueness of the virtual itself.

Indeed, [Ortega y Gasset (1968)](#index_split_000.html_p37) contended that in our time, after more than 2500 years of identifying with reason and submitting

sensibility to its demands, we are discovering that reason is nothing

but "a tiny island afloat on the sea of primeval vitality" (p. 57).

Reason, according to him, with its culture of abstract intelligence, its

science and theory, cannot supplant life. Our mission in this era, he

believed, is to submit reason to vitality, place it within the life-world,

and surrender it to spontaneity. It is culture, reason, and ethics that

should be at the service of life and not the other way around.

The real character and import of this digital revolution may be its

offering us (or forcing us) into a new perspective that may mark the

beginning of that exploration that Ortega y Gasset had seen, as already approaching from the future, so that our gradual withdrawal

from the physical into the virtual may in the end serve as a way to disabuse ourselves of the illusory image we have of human being as

the zenith of nature.

[**Introduction to Part I**](#index_split_000.html_p10)

Before we begin our investigations on human virtuality and digital life, we need to provide a genealogy of the technology that has led us

to this era. We begin with a short story of the evolution of the media,

starting in the emergence of language, and consider the relation be-

tween these evolving technologies and what we are calling the human

virtual. And we finish with virtuality's different transformations,

especially apropos the digital.

[]{#index_split_000.html_p40}[**1 History of the virtual**](#index_split_000.html_p10)

\[In\] a technological world \[...\] the terms of nature are obscured; one

need not live quite in the present or the local.

Rebecca [Solnit (2003)](#index_split_001.html_p59)

[**Prelude**](#index_split_000.html_p10)

Human beings, unlike any other species on the planet, have a sense of

history, of living through a sequence of past, present, and future.

Animals, on the contrary, do not have our sense of time; they live always in an unstoppable now. They forget as soon as they're done,

and then they do it again as if for the first time. Animals immediately

forget: not their bodies, that remember in another way, but their temporal consciousness. For them, each moment "sink\[s\] back into

deep night extinguished forever," as [Nietzsche (1980,](#index_split_001.html_p59) pp. 8--9) poetically says. Their life is condemned to (or blessed with) an eternal present. But humans are freed from this sentence. They suspend the

world from the actual present and virtualize it into a representation, a

concept, an image, an idea. Images and words are our awakening to

consciousness.

According to the Greek myth, we received the gift of thought in

the fire that the titan Prometheus stole from the gods as compen-

sation for the precariousness of our natural existence. This titanic transgression curses us but also brings us closer to the gods. In technology, we are given the power to extend reality, to usher the

world into the realm of possibilities. It constitutes our "leap into the

virtual," which begins the evolution of *Homo sapiens*. Technology generates a history of the virtual, of the many different transformations it undergoes with each new advance. That history has led

us -- through images painted on cave walls, and words first uttered

and then written, through photographic and then moving images --

to our latest leap into the digital modulation of the virtual, which

we call "Virtual Reality."

[]{#index_split_000.html_p41}22 *Virtual media*

The awakening of the intellect, says [Wittgenstein (1993),](#index_split_001.html_p59) is always accompanied by a rupture from the original ground. Human consciousness involves the loss of the instinctive connection to the world

that characterizes the life of animals and human infancy. Every time a

new technology arises, it conditions the virtual differently, so that the

same dynamic of loss is repeated again. Armed with a new medium,

we lose the immediacy of the world we had attained under the spell of

the previous one. Our smartphones, for example, capable of carrying

an immense memory supplement, begin to displace and obliterate our

natural memories, which often no longer remember even the simplest

of things. Suddenly, what had been natural for us before, is forgotten

with the next technology, which opens a new evolutionary path in its

place.

[Plato (1980)](#index_split_001.html_p59) was the first to warn us about that technological dynamic, especially its particular loss and danger, when he pointed out

that the new invention of writing would separate knowledge from

experience, doing away with the work of memory that transforms

information into understanding, and so leads us to mistake information for wisdom. As King Thamus tells Theuth, the inventor of writing,

in the Phaedrus:

If men learn \[writing\], it will implant forgetfulness in their souls;

they will cease to exercise memory because they rely on that

which is written, calling things to remembrance no longer from

within themselves, but by means of external marks. \[Writing\] is a

recipe not for memory, but for reminder. And it is no true wisdom

that you offer your disciples, but only its semblance, for by telling

them of many things without teaching them you will make them

seem to know much, while for the most part they know nothing.

(p. 275a)

Writing allows us to handle information without having to assimilate

it immediately, as we did before, when we received it orally and had to

process it right there and then in our bodies, through our emotions.

But with writing, we can learn to repeat the discourse of another and

"understand" its meaning, at a distance, intellectually, without really

grasping it. (Apollo, the myth says, shoots his precise arrows always

from a distance.) In making memory dispensable, scribal conscious-

ness disconnects the oral medium from experience and words lose the

depth and power of their grounding in the body.

There is a new loss every time we leap again into the virtual. This

has been true with speech and written or printed words, photographs,

and moving pictures; it is no different with digital images, hypertexts,

and the like. But, faithful to its pharmacological nature, that loss al-

ways comes with its gain as well. All technology opens new doors,

[]{#index_split_000.html_p42} *History of the virtual* 23

making new experiences possible, at the same time that it closes

others. Writing may disconnect us from the immediacy of oral lan-

guage and its automatic work of memory, but it also sharpens the reasoning and logical skills without which modern scientific advance,

for example, would not have been possible.

[**1 A short story of the media**](#index_split_000.html_p10)

[***a Words: From speech to writing***](#index_split_000.html_p10)

Technology is the expression of a drive to extend ourselves into the

virtual. It reflects our capacity to abstract reality, to remove ourselves

from the immediacy of experience in the world, to lift it up "into thought." Its consequences mark the path technology has forged in

human history, and the world-changing transformations it has occa-

sioned. In order to explore how this manifests in the digital era, we

intend to provide a basic framework from which to understand them,

outlining, in broad strokes, a short history of the technology of communication and tracing the primary ways in which each subsequent technology has transformed human experience.

The story we want to tell begins with the appearance of what some

might consider our first technology: language. With words, human

being was extended into the abstract and ethereal realm of concepts

that freed us from the passage of time and the tyranny of becoming.

Speech articulates the mental world, extends our experience with

virtual possibilities, and re-configures it with ideas and constructed narratives. Articulated in the air of spoken words, behavioral patterns,

acquired tastes and tendencies, etc., they are passed on from genera-

tion to generation, in "memes" (to use Dawkins' now-trending term),

which function at the cultural level as genes do biologically. Thanks

to language, human evolution speeds up beyond the biological. As

Yuval [Harari (2011)](#index_split_001.html_p59) observes, since the emergence of language, humans don't live in only one mode of natural life, as animals seem to

do, they live in many *cultural* alternatives.

The virtual was first forged by spoken words and images, con-

stituting together a mythical worldview. [1](#index_split_001.html_p57) With alphabetical writing --

a particularly Western form of inscription that articulates meaning around arbitrary signs -- the mythical thought of words and images was replaced by logical, rational thought. By massifying that technology in the 15th century, the printing press helped intensify this shift away from orality which has prevailed in our culture ever since.

In transforming spoken words and images into logical concepts,

writing subordinates our synchronistic, moment-to-moment experi-

ence of time to the diachronic progression of history. As [Vilém Flusser](#index_split_001.html_p59)

[(2011a)](#index_split_001.html_p59) says, "the unidirectional flow of writing" (p. xiv) results in a

[]{#index_split_000.html_p43}24 *Virtual media*

new experience of time as linear, a stream of unstoppable progress, of

dramatic unrepeatability, of framing, in short, history. Past, present,

and future, and our conception of time as progressive, are made

possible by this virtual extension of experience.

The invention of writing made it possible for stories to reach

farther across time and space than their tellers and stay more

stable than memory; and new communications, reproduction,

and transportation technologies only continue the process.

[(Solnit, 2003,](#index_split_001.html_p59) p. 11)

But as we know, every gain brings a loss with it. As [McLuhan (1998)](#index_split_001.html_p59)

pointed out in his seminal book, *Understanding Media*, the advent of any technology involves not just an extension but also an amputation

of experience. When our calculating capacity is extended by an elec-

tronic calculator, for example, we stop adding or multiplying in our

head. The mental activity of calculating is amputated. When we ex-

tend our motility with the car, we amputate our legs so that we hardly

consider it a possibility to walk even short distances. When we extend

our memory with the Internet, we begin to depend so much on the

technological extension that we stop committing to memory the

information that is stored there now.

In their battle against spoken language, [Flusser (2011b)](#index_split_001.html_p59) writes,

"the characters of the alphabet suck the life of the language up into

themselves: letters are vampires" (p. 37). And, as [Havelock (1986)](#index_split_001.html_p59)

points out, with writing, "the acoustic flow of language contrived by

echo to hold the attention of the ear has been reshuffled into visual

patterns created by the thoughtful attention of the eye" (p. 13).

Writing displaces bodily interaction: the sonority of the voice that

the ear receives gives way to the intellectual sharpness of the seeing

eye and the spontaneity of speech yields to the deliberateness of reason. The analytic, sequential way of thinking and perceiving

fostered by the linear logic of the alphabet pointedly contrasts with

the thought and perception that characterized oral culture. The

richness of the image and the associative thought it promotes is re-

placed by the exactness of the concept and rational way of thinking.

We thus begin to live as we read, logically and sequentially, as if in a

fixed line towards a goal. But, of course, this transformation did not

take place immediately.

The printed page, in placing the object before us in inert signs, extends our capacity for concentration, objective analysis, and representational memory. That shift transforms language and modifies

the way in which we had traditionally modulated the virtual. Whereas

in the oral tradition, the expression with which words were delivered

was inseparable from its content, so that they were literally an

[]{#index_split_000.html_p44} *History of the virtual* 25

extension of our tongues, in the new scribal tradition content becomes more important than expression, and so language is trans-

formed into a tool. The industrial revolution's emphasis on

production and efficiency, and the pragmatic expeditiousness of that

era that is occasioned by writing, turns language into a mere "vehicle

of information," what [Benjamin (1978)](#index_split_001.html_p58) called a "bourgeois language"

(p. [318).2](#index_split_001.html_p57) Its clear concepts, sedimented on the page, simplify the complexity of oral language and its aesthetic dimension. We begin to

experience reality through the objective concepts of reason, and gra-

dually become more insensitive to the pregnant opacities of actual experience, unable to see the meanings that opened up through the

spoken word and its images.

So, although bourgeois language achieves an aesthetic detachment

from sensible experience that is, of course, responsible for many

scientific achievements in these past centuries, it involves also the kind of sensible impoverishment that Plato warned us about, when

he pointed out that writing would affect the capacity to interiorize

what we learn and end up confusing information for wisdom. Once

we begin to read the world through the thinking head rather than

the resonating body, concepts are divorced from their live, performative contexts. They abstract us from time and disconnect us from

its flow. Spontaneity yields to regularity, contingency and the unknown are systematically disavowed, and our vital circle narrows.

While written language provides a precise, technical tool and

expedites communication, it also takes away its existential depth.

If technology is, as [McLuhan (1998)](#index_split_001.html_p59) observed, an extension of human being, then images and drawings, concepts and words, each

constitute a different extension of experience with its own particular

modulation of virtuality. With the spoken word we leave the mute

privacy of wordless experience and enter into verbal interaction with

actual others that help forge a public world of shared meanings. By

suspending temporal movement and casting events into abstract signs

(i.e., writing), we substitute the immediacy and fleetingness of experience with a permanent, objective, atemporal, visual trace. No

longer subject to the transience of passing voices in a conversation or

fleeting thoughts, with writing the world is sedimented into objective,

atemporal meanings.

The illusion of an orderly world and of a world with a rational telos,

at the service of humans, is only possible with a language turned into

a tool of reason, understood as pure or as instrumental. The excesses

that this will incur are anticipated, for instance, by the image of Goya's famous etching -- of a man crumpled on his desk asleep upon

an open book -- "The sleep of reason produces monsters."

[***b Images: From photography to digital image***](#index_split_000.html_p10)

[*i Photography*](#index_split_000.html_p10)

But let us not forget that the word originates in the image. Concepts

anchor our world, as [Nietzsche (2017)](#index_split_001.html_p59) so poignantly puts it, "by means of the petrification and coagulation of a mass of images which

originally streamed from the primal faculty of human imagination

like a fiery liquid" (p. 22). Despite the prevalence of scribality, words

and images both are inscribed in our psyche; both are different

openings to the human virtual and stand always in a dialectical

relationship. Each marks a different psychic domain and holds a

perennial tension within ourselves.

Between the 17th and 19th centuries, printed reproduction spread

slowly but steadily, and with the invention of the daily newspaper, it

placed itself at the center of culture. The prevalence of the word continued, however, despite the introduction, in the 20th century, of

the electronic media. The telegraph, the telephone, and the radio, since they are linked to the voice and articulated language, were still

compatible with writing. But with the invention of photography in

the mid-19th century, the rupture with scribality begins with its re-introduction of the image. Its extensions in television and film are then powerfully potentiated with the advent of digital technology,

which massifies the image in the same way that the printing press did

with writing.

Like the written or spoken medium, the trace on the photographic

plate continues the technological modulation of virtuality, freezing time and abstracting from experience, but now through the image.

Before photography, the past was preserved in memory and brought

back in words; but every experience, every object, and every event was

unique and unrepeatable, an ephemeral and passing moment. With

every photograph, however, we are able "to snatch a moment from

the river of time," as Rebecca [Solnit (2003,](#index_split_001.html_p59) p. 17) puts it. We are able to bring the past back, but no longer just in abstract mental concepts,

as language does, but again, as in pre-scribal times (when humans painted on the walls of caves) in an actual two-dimensional visual trace of the empirical experience.

In the otherwise image-dominated history of human consciousness,

scribality and linear texts had become primary bearers of important

information in the West for a relatively short hiatus. [3](#index_split_001.html_p57) With the photographic camera, a return to the image becomes imminent, and it has

important consequences for our relationship to time:

Opposed to the unidirectional flow of writing, and its unrepeat-

ability that determines an inscription of time as progressive, the

[]{#index_split_000.html_p46} *History of the virtual* 27

image now introduces a new temporality that does away with the

linear sense of movement and introduces an "all-at-onceness."

[(Flusser, 2011b,](#index_split_001.html_p59) p. xiv)

The photograph extracts experience from its temporality so that we can hold its image completely in our consciousness, just as we do with

concepts. But the photograph, unlike the concept, is a physical image

that, because it impresses our senses, involves our body and elicits an

affect. Being the result of an actual impression of what is photographed, there is a material continuity between the photograph and

what it is a photograph of; it works within the logic of the visual image, which unavoidably engages our imagination and the capacity

to make connections that go far beyond the actual. A new plasticity

emerges, and hence a myriad of possible new connections and

meanings that go beyond the rigid sedimentation of concepts. Again,

unlike concepts that constitute what we grasp in the ethereal context

of the mind, the perception of the image, being a bodily phenom-

enon, brings in the issue of spatio-temporal experience that is absent

in the mental construction of meaning that takes place with writing.

The camera captures mechanically not only what we saw, the par-

tial perception of our senses and our limited attention, but also what

we did not see but lay open in the actual event. It brings to awareness,

in other words, in the "all-at-onceness" of its image, what [Benjamin](#index_split_001.html_p58)

[(2008b)](#index_split_001.html_p58) calls "the optical unconscious" (p. 278).

It is possible, for example, however roughly, to describe the way

somebody walks, but it is impossible to say anything about that

fraction of a second when a person starts to walk. Photography

with its various aids (lenses, enlargements) can reveal this mo-

ment. Photography makes aware for the first time the optical

unconscious, just as psychoanalysis discloses the instinctual

unconscious. (p. 278)

The density of time, its endless flux, the many aspects it hides from us

in its movement, are immediately available to the camera. The range

of what is seen is broadened, and with it also the range of what can be

known. That is why the most interesting detail in the photograph, as

[Barthes (1981)](#index_split_001.html_p58) points out,

occurs in the field of the photographed thing like a supplement

that is, at once, inevitable and delightful; it does not necessarily

attest to the photographer's art; it says only that the photographer

\[...\] could not *not* photograph the partial object at the same time

as the total object. (p. 47)

[]{#index_split_000.html_p47}28 *Virtual media*

The contingency of actual experience slips in through the image,

something impossible through the static nature of writing, and awa-

kens us to temporal movement in its recovered loss. [Barthes (1981)](#index_split_001.html_p58)

calls that wound or scar that evidences chance and tears through the

framed image the *punctum,* which, as he puts it, "rises from the scene, shoots out like an arrow and pierces me" (p. 26). The *punctum* is that unexpected or unintended detail in the materially captured reality of

the photograph that escapes its intentionality and evidences its *having* *been* there, in space, in moving time. [4](#index_split_001.html_p58) That ghostly effect of the punctum, that affect, tears through the representation and exposes us,

making us suddenly vulnerable to the shadow of time; it unfixes,

opening us to time's phantasmatic flow, to its radical absence. The image not only brings to presence something now absent, but also

intimates something that is no longer here, something missed.

Because photographs engage our body, as images normally do, they

are more able than words to evoke and bring temporality to experi-

ence by physically presencing an absence, in the actual impression of

the *punctum*. That paradox confers on the photograph its particular numinosity.

Being a paradigmatic pharmakon, even though it poisons us with

the illusion of permanence that its image creates, photography also cures us of that illusion as it exposes us to the ineluctable spectrality of the passage of time.

[*ii Film*](#index_split_000.html_p10)

The vision of a celluloid tape with a series of moving images telling

a story to millions. Millions anywhere. Millions seen and unseen.

Millions seeing the same story without ever knowing each other.

Without even having to be together. Affecting their dreams and

actions. Replacing their books. Replacing their families. Replacing

religion, politics, art, conversation. Replacing their minds.

(Sam Shepard, *Angel City*)

Film inherits photography's material connection with its object, what

(following C.S. Peirce) has been called its "indexicality." [5](#index_split_001.html_p58) It therefore also shares the issues of time and temporality that we have seen arise

in the photographic capture of the passing moment. But with film, we

don't so much freeze time as register its movement. Film introduces

the unheard-of possibility of extracting *the actuality* of time from actual time, and of replaying its movement, literally, at any time. In that

register, we can see details that, when within the temporal flux, we pass over, but that now serve, in the cinematic image, as a new medium to contemplate, express, and communicate. With film, a

whole new level is added to our experience of time, and a new

[]{#index_split_000.html_p48} *History of the virtual* 29

dimension of temporality is given to human experience. As the genius

of Russian film Andrei [Tarkovski (1994)](#index_split_001.html_p59) writes:

Time, printed in its factual forms and manifestations, such is the

supreme idea of cinema as an art, leading us to think about

the wealth of untapped resources in film, about its colossal

future. (p. 63)

The movement of time that we could only experience in the un-

stoppable flow of our present awareness before this technology, now becomes a possible object of detailed inspection. Film lifts the seeing

eye from its own temporality, and allows it to study time in movement

from outside its actual flow. In setting the captured image in motion

and then liberating it from the present, film dissolves the static rigidity of the photographic image into the flux of actual becoming. Instead of

hiding contingency, embalming time, as [Bazin (1971)](#index_split_001.html_p58) puts it, film liberates it. While in the photographic image the actuality of time only

appears in the "glitches" of its capture, in [Barthes' (1981)](#index_split_001.html_p58) *punctum*, in film temporality bursts forth upon the screen. It doesn't just pierce us

with a static evidence of temporal movement, as the photograph does.

The single beam of time that leaks in surreptitiously from the *punctum*

now radiates from the immersive flow of moving images on the screen.

Temporality floods and inundates here.

In its beginnings, not quite understanding its potential and sub-

mitting to the prevailing scribal rationalism, film was constructed following the criteria and standards of representation that it inherited

from writing. As [Bazin (1971)](#index_split_001.html_p58) explains,

Classical editing separated reality into successive shots which were

just a series of either logical or subjective points of view of an event ... \[in its\] ordering of the shots \[it is a\] conventional analysis

of the reality continuum that truly goes to make up the cinemato-

graphic language of the period ... \[and\] introduces an obviously

abstract element into reality. (p. 28)

That abstract element that habitually slips into classical filmmaking in

the sequential parsing out of the captured event is a residue from the

prevailing medium of writing. In its traditional narrative, film subjects

the presentation of reality that the moving image performs to the abstraction of rational thinking. Instead of bringing us closer to reality, this imposed sequentiality in its structure distances us from the

density of concrete experience, placing it within a familiar and preconceived framework. This tendency to abstract thinking is, of course,

a symptom of the scientific mentality that the printed word spread through modernity.

[]{#index_split_000.html_p49}30 *Virtual media*

But eventually film discovered the new relation to reality that it could forge, the real power of its technology. That tendency toward

abstraction is precisely what film is to overcome as it moves toward a

more embodied experience than traditional film had yet seen. The

movement of Italian neo-realism in the 1940s, for example, -- with films like *Bicycle Thief* or *La Strada* and directors like Rossellini, Visconti, De Sica, and Fellini -- seeks in its newly emerging methods to

come closer to reality, to bring film down to concrete experience. This

new virtual space requires an intensified sensorial involvement of the

spectator with the image.

Whereas initially, then, film images were used to construct fields of

perception along rigid rails of logical thinking, modelled after the linearity of writing, and working with our expectation of sequential

action in a narrative plane, the cinematic image eventually breaks with the scribal model and begins to respond instead to "a new form

of reality \[which\] is felt to be dispersive, elliptical, errant or wavering, working in blocks, with deliberately weak connections and floating

events" [(Deleuze, 1989,](#index_split_001.html_p58) p. 1). In these new developments, the film image marks its independence from conceptual thinking and appeals

to our own experiential discernment.

In departing from the sensory-motor expectation of movement

[]{#index_split_001.html}

that classical film automatically followed, the cinematic image now

traces a virtual space that, even as it works with the discontinuity and fragmentariness of the subjective -- what [Deleuze (1989)](#index_split_001.html_p58) describes as a "dispersive, elliptical, errant or wavering" reality -- it presupposes its underlying invisible continuity. The film image now

subverts the hold of the prevailing scribal structures of memory that

order experience along logical tracks and rational narratives and

opens film into a whole new mode of experience of time. It relies no

longer on an *a priori* conception of reality, but instead delivers us to an underlying whole from which the image now comes forth. As

[Bazin (1971)](#index_split_001.html_p58) writes:

The traditional realist artist ... analyzes reality into parts which he

then reassembles in a synthesis the final determinant of which is

his moral conception of the world whereas the consciousness of

the neoreality director *filters* reality. Undoubtedly, his consciousness, like that of everyone else, does not admit reality as a whole,

but the selection that does occur is neither logical nor is it

psychological; it is ontological, in the sense that the image of

reality it restores to us is still a whole. (p. 98)

Whereas in traditional cinema the reality of objects and setting was

functional, strictly determined by the physical and psychological

demands of the situation, in neo-realism and independent films, it

[]{#index_split_001.html_p50} *History of the virtual* 31

now becomes a protagonist itself. Reality is represented not as a synthesis of elements according to a given continuity, but as the selective filtering of experience by subjectivity. No longer married

to the logic of action, film rather flirts now with the openness of (audiovisual) contemplation and imagination. Just as everyday

reality is unitary without it depending on a continuous, linear, se-

quential experience (even if we are often inclined to construct it or

narrate it in that way), the cinematic representation of reality ap-

pears as a disrupted and discontinuous, though at the same time

unitary, whole. So, if the landscape in a film is "bare and confined,"

this reflects the limitations of the consciousness of the protagonist

without falsifying the landscape. What the neo-realist film shows is

not false; "it is \[...\] a mental landscape at once as objective as a straight photograph and as subjective as pure personal consciousness" [(Bazin, 1971,](#index_split_001.html_p58) p. 98).

The moving image begins to modulate the virtual itself in ac-

cordance with the organic way of the image, no longer in sub-

servience to the logical structures of writing. It re-engages our body

in the perception of the world, harkening back to the spontaneity

of sensible perception that defined oral culture in its appeal to in-

tuition and imagination. Film no longer seeks to represent or re-

plicate an already deciphered real, but "aims at an always

ambiguous, to be deciphered, real \[...\] between the reality of the

setting and that of the action," [Deleuze (1989)](#index_split_001.html_p58) writes "it is no longer a motor extension which is established, but rather a

dreamlike connection through the intermediary of the liberated

sense organs" (p. 4). Their liberation from scribal strictures generates a freedom of associations and connections that transforms

reality into an oneiric landscape. [6](#index_split_001.html_p58)

With the new technologies of photography and film, therefore,

the image re-emerges in the 20th century, reclaiming a central

place in the collective imagination and forcefully reinstating ele-

ments of the magical world that were banished with writing. The

advent of the analog (photograph or film) image brought the

bodily imagination back into scribal culture. As [Sartori (1998)](#index_split_001.html_p59)

points out, enhanced by television and film, the spectator becomes

more a seeing than a symbolic animal, a *Homo videns* rather than a

*Homo sapiens*.

For \[Homo videns\] things represented in images count and weigh

more than things said in words. And this is a radical change of direction, because while the symbolic faculty distances Homo

sapiens from animals, the fact of seeing brings him closer to his

ancestral capacities. (our translation, p. 33)

[]{#index_split_001.html_p51}32 *Virtual media*

[*iii Digital image*](#index_split_000.html_p10)

The beginning of the 1990s marks the time -- 150 years since the photograph displaced painting -- when the digital image on the screen

started to displace the analog image on a photographic plate or cel-

luloid. It was no longer the light that came from the object that produced the image, but an array of binary digits obtained from a scanner, which a computer could then process algorithmically into

digital images. Every point in a grid is made to correspond to a point

of color in the scene or object photographed, which together con-

stitute the mathematical elements from which the image will now

emerge. The analog representation of reality is thus digitized. William

[J. Mitchell (1992),](#index_split_001.html_p59) in his now classic book, *The Reconfigured Eye*, writes: Just as the elementary operation of painting a picture is the brush

stroke and the elementary operation of typing a text is a key-

stroke, the elementary operation of digital imaging is assignment

of an integer value to a pixel in order to specify (according to some

coding scheme) its tone or color. (p. 6)

Whereas the (analog) photograph captures a continuous reality, the

digital capture is rather constituted by discrete points; it is from these that an image of reality is arithmetically constructed. Mitchell

explains the difference between the continuous capture of analog

media and the digitized image in the following metaphor: "Rolling

down a ramp is continuous motion, but walking down stairs is a

sequence of discrete steps -- so you can count the number of steps"

(p. 10). The continuity of the analog image results in an amazingly

precise record of every detail, which is made up of an unbroken se-

quence of gradations that go from the absence of light (black) to plenitude of light (white). You can magnify analog images in-definitely, and you will always find more information captured from

(continuous) reality.

The classic movie *Blow-up* (1966), for instance, is predicated precisely on that fact. A discovery of the murder that triggers the whole

plot results from the detail that shows up when an image is magnified

while developing a film. Whereas the analog photograph carries the

actual impression of the light and shadows emanating from its object,

a digital image is a mathematical reconstruction of that impression as

it is captured and numerically converted in a grid, and so will only show as much as that conversion will allow. The digital image is not

the exact reproduction of the original, therefore, but merely the best

approximation according to the available matrix.

A digital copy of a painting, for example, would be faithful, not to

the original object but to the conditions of its reproduction. A digital

[]{#index_split_001.html_p52} *History of the virtual* 33

photograph is the result of the capture of all the object's points of light in the field of the image.

But once we decide what the focal field is, as well as the depth and

speed from which reality is reconstructed, the act of interpreting those

points of light is algorithmically fixed. This places limits on the capture of the actual event, insofar as the optical limitations of the apparatus arbitrarily determines the depth and scope of the representation. Its limits are fixed in that first capture, so that it can never reveal more than it has registered.

The digital object, being discrete, inevitably loses the continuity of

the analog, but whereas the analogic object will suffer deterioration in

its reproduction, the digital object, no longer a copy but a clone, re-

creates itself anew every time. Each new copy would be a variation on

the digitized data beyond the limits of which it can render no more

information.

There is an irreducible ontological difference, therefore, between

the continuity of reality transmitted from its material impression (i.e.,

from actual contact) and the discontinuity of the digital register that

is wholly managed in the abstraction of numbers and silicon circuits.

No matter how high the resolution of the digital image, gaps will al-

ways remain insofar as digital captures break up continuous tonal

gradients into discrete steps made up of numerically assigned points.

The continuity of curves and fine details are approximated to the grid.

Nothing can close the space that separates each discrete digital unit

from the other. "As waves dissolve into drops, judgments into bytes,

actions into actemes" writes [Flusser (2011a),](#index_split_001.html_p59) "a void appears, namely the void of the intervals that hold the elemental points apart \[...\] and

so \[the\] impossibility of measuring the points themselves" (p. 15). The

void that appears with the digital betrays the digital images' genera-

tion from numerical calculation instead of from an empirical con-

nection with the world. The digital image is fundamentally detached

from the real. We see on our screens not an impression but a reconstruction which results from calculation and not from physical

contact.

[Benjamin (2008a)](#index_split_001.html_p58) had noted at the beginning of the 20th century, a difference between the mechanical reproduction of a work of art and

the work of art itself. When substituting it with an infinitely re-producible replica, the object loses its unique connection to its original creation, which Benjamin relates to the atmosphere emanating

from its material origin -- what might be seen as the spiritual or aes-

thetic depth of the object -- which he calls "the aura" (p. 23). The question now is whether the experiential loss of digitization in its disconnection from the reality it pictures, is analogous to the impoverishment of experience Benjamin diagnosed in the technically

reproduced image.

[]{#index_split_001.html_p53}34 *Virtual media*

In the concept of the aura, Benjamin is trying to capture the resonance that the work of art derives from its unfathomable origin.

This quality is absent from the mechanical reproduction, the flatness

of which derives from an origin that is no longer inexhaustible; there

is no material resonance for the reproduction to carry. For [Benjamin](#index_split_001.html_p58)

[(2008a),](#index_split_001.html_p58) nearly a century ago, that loss was a sign of his times.

Every day, the urge grows stronger to get hold of an object at close

range in an image \[Bild\], or, better, in a facsimile \[Abbild\], a reproduction. And the reproduction \[Reproduktion\], as offered by

illustrated magazines and newsreels, differs unmistakably from

the image. (p. 23)

Benjamin is pointing to an ethos that is familiar to us also in our 21st-

century culture, where the pulsating opaqueness of living matter is reduced to rational controllable criteria, where the distance between

sensible experience and conceptual understanding is eliminated,

where singularity is replaced by homogeneity, archetype by stereo-

type, and the dynamic living thing by static inert matter. It is significant that the very same ethos that occasions that loss in the field of

perception in Benjamin's time with mechanical reproduction and its

penchant for statistics, is also seen in our dealings with the world in

this century; it is echoed in the compulsive need to quantify and measure all things, that seems to have grown with digital technology

and its will to digitization.

In the digitization of the image, the object is detached from empirical continuity and transported to a world of pixels, where reality is

thus sanitized and disconnected from the body and sensible experi-

ence. The sharpening of digital information demands, for example,

the systematic suppression of silent pauses or background noise. But

as Sheryl [Branham (2017)](#index_split_001.html_p58) observes:

\[R\]emoving \[silence or noise\] while a speaker is talking \[... first\]

makes correlated noise, such as echo, more pronounced and

jarring to the listener. Second, it diminishes a sense of social

presence, of *being with* another. \[...because\] the background noise

\[that it intends to eliminate\] isn't really just noise under normal

circumstances. It's a form of information, providing feedback that

someone is still there. (p. 147)

But beyond the disconnection that results from the digital modula-

tion, reality and the analog image undergo even further modifications

in digitization. What we are perceiving on the screen is always a modified version of what is on the other side, so that our perception is

always compromised. [Brahnam (2017)](#index_split_001.html_p58) explains:

[]{#index_split_001.html_p54} *History of the virtual* 35

To increase band-width efficiency, some [codecs7](#index_split_001.html_p58) encode only areas that change in a video frame and not the entire frame \[...\]

As quality matters, video and audio errors are detected and

corrected, and enhancements to signals are made throughout

the transmission process. At the source and at the destination,

signals are sharpened, colors heightened, noise adaptively sup-

pressed, silence suppressed, and missing data and other aspects of

the signals synthesized and augmented. ... (p. 147)

On Skype (or Zoom or Facetime), we can readily recognize not just a

loss but a distortion of what is transmitted, so that what is received is

never completely aligned with the reality that is projected. It is not,

however, a matter of a loss of quantity of information that happens in

digitization, as is generally thought. As [Lev Manovich (2001)](#index_split_001.html_p59) observes, digital technology has already developed so much that this logical consequence of digitization no longer holds. Digital images can now

provide as much information as analog images can. That difference no

longer matters, for by the beginning of this century, a digital image

already could contain more information than anybody would ever

want. The resolution of scanners now provides an exactness that al-

lows the stored image, even if it is comprised of a finite number of pixels, to contain much finer detail than was ever possible for analog

photography. The problem is that digitization involves also -- beyond

the distortion and manipulation necessary for its sharpness -- the loss

of a particular kind of information that connects the object to its original ground.

With the analog image, as Stiegler [(Derrida and Stiegler, 2002)](#index_split_001.html_p58)

put [it:8](#index_split_001.html_p58)

we know that the luminances that come to touch my eye \[the

photons that come to imprint and *physically* touch, from out of the nineteenth century, *the photosensitive* silver halides\], *really* touched what the photograph renders visible. (p. 152)

But the digital image "breaks the 'umbilical cord'" that grounds the

materiality of the process responsible for the ghostly effect of the photographic image, i.e. of something that once was but now is not,

irretrievably no longer there. Whereas the photographic plate, we

could say, shines back at us an image from a moment past, in the digital image nothing shines back at us from any past:

With analog light, the silver luminances still have to do with

touch and with life -- with a past life. With the digital photo, this

light, from out of the night \[...\] doesn't come from a past day that

would simply have become night (like photons emanating from a

[]{#index_split_001.html_p55}36 *Virtual media*

past object). It comes from Hades, from the realm of the dead,

from underground: it is an electric light, set free by materials from

deep within the belly of the earth. An electronic, that is to say, a

decomposed light. (ibid, p. 153)

The digital image emerges from a darkness that has no past; it is not a

footprint of anything, but an algorithmic phantom of something that

has never been there; it merely mimics the indexical character of the

traditional image. The digital image becomes an assemblage of com-

puter data that may, furthermore, be permuted and interlaced in ways

that need no longer hold any relation to actual reality. The *this was* of the photograph that gave it its truth, becomes now essentially

*doubtful.* This discretization, this turning the continuity of reality into a series of discrete points, radically "affects the chain of memorial light" [(Derrida and Stiegler, 2002,](#index_split_001.html_p58) p. 154). Disconnected from space, the digital image is unmoored from all familiar ports. The indexical

connection between the image projected on the screen and the event

it represents is done away with, and so our "natural" belief that the

image bears something that makes contact, or is actually linked, to an

actual moment in time and space, is shattered.

According to Laura [Mulvey (2018)](#index_split_001.html_p59) this is what distinguishes digital images from analogic (photographic and film) images. The *this was* that sustains the analogic image, she argues, is no longer there for the

digital, and the link to an actual origin that guaranteed the representational accuracy and authenticity of the analogic image no

longer exists. "The digital as an abstract information system," she writes, "made a break with the analogue imagery, finally sweeping

away the relation with reality" (p. 18).

The digital data captured is an approximation of reality, always

limited to the possibilities of the equipment available. A digital cap-

ture of data is converted into an archive that will become an exact copy, but its exactness corresponds to the sampling rather than to the

object itself. As [Flusser (2011a)](#index_split_001.html_p59) says, traditional images "are observa-tions of objects," while technical images are "computations of concepts." The resulting digitized image will always lack the continuity of

the analog because the collected data is discrete. Even if the sampling

ends up collecting much more information than we experience (as

Manovich points out is already the case), for instance, more visual data than human beings can process or more audio data than even

dogs, with their wide auditory frequencies, can hear. In other words,

concepts can never be objects, so despite the abundance of data, the

discontinuity that distinguished the digital from the analog is never

bridged; it may seem, therefore, that we have lost the aura once again.

But perhaps it is not so much lost as transformed, and the digital

[]{#index_split_001.html_p56} *History of the virtual* 37

object rather inaugurates a new dimension of experience, drawn from

"the night of a past that was never present."

What is interesting is that although it is affected, the chain of memorial light, as Stiegler calls the material connection with the original, may be *not broken*, just "knotted in a different way" [(Derrida](#index_split_001.html_p58)

[and Stiegler, 2002,](#index_split_001.html_p58) p. 154). Other relations, intertextual and cross media, begin to emerge that while leaving behind the indexical

connection may still provide "the chance of a new intelligibility of

light, which has always already been \[...\] the night of a past that was

*never present*" (ibid, p. 155). In other words, being cut loose from the causal logic of reality, a different kind of connection and sense-giving logic opens up, which is now defined by the multimedia

possibilities introduced by the digital. And thus we touch down

again into the oneiric landscape Deleuze found in neo-realism,

where the actual and the virtual begin to merge into one single

reality.

In digitization, the uniqueness and singularity of the original object

is homogenized for the sake of exact replication and so detached from

the tradition, which gives it its temporal and material depth. In its binomial reduction to 0s and 1s, the qualitative movement of the

analogic image is transformed into the quantitative states of the digital.

As Stiegler points out, a similar revolution was caused by the institution of writing that also discretized and so made the continuity of

speech analytical, and hence also analyzable. Prior to writing, the speaker was not aware of any discrete objects in her thought process

until the sign system made possible the play of analyzable, diacritical

combinatorial elements. Similarly, the digital discretization of the image makes its elements also analytical. But unlike writing, we are ordering something that has never been there.

The digital image is constructed from those discrete elements, even

though they do not come from the objects themselves. This means

that the possibility of *not having been* is essential to the digital photographic image. But this characteristic, as Stiegler points out,

inspires *fear*, for \[...\] at the same time that it is infinitely manipulable, \[it\] still *remains* a photo, so it preserves for us something of the *this was* within itself, and the possibility of distinguishing the true from the false dwindles in proportion as

the possibilities for the digital treatment of photos grow. [(Derrida](#index_split_001.html_p58)

[and Stiegler, 2002,](#index_split_001.html_p58) p. [150)9](#index_split_001.html_p58)

Representation gives way to the production of reality in the digital, where accuracy begins to lose importance beside technical dexterity

and perfection.

... in-person communication and distant communication re-

semble each other as much as whole foods resemble highly

processed foods---about as much as a real blueberry muffin, for

example, resembles a processed blueberry muffin that contains

not a single blueberry but rather artificial flavors and textures that

taste and feel in the mouth just like a blueberry should---or, as

some might say (and this is the ultimate goal), "better" than any

blueberry could. [(Branham, 2017,](#index_split_001.html_p58) p. 147)

We become "\[m\]ore concerned with questions of technological magic

('How'd they do that?')," [as Everett (2010)](#index_split_001.html_p59) says, "than with believable representations of reality as markers of success" (p. 32). This, of course, has the consequences we are living with regarding the phenomenon of post-truth, about which we will have more to say in the

following chapters.

Imagination, which had been displaced in the act of representation

by writing and alphabetical reasoning, comes back again with the

digital. So just as with the discretization of language that took place

with the invention of writing we learned to analyze the continuity of

spoken language and began to construct its meanings in unheard of

ways, with the discretization of the image that happens in the digital

we are bound to learn new ways of seeing it. And because the discrete

image is now lifted into the collectively shared space of the Internet,

where new possibilities of interaction introduce a different set of conditions, we might just be witnessing the birth of new forms of belief.

**Notes**

[1](#index_split_000.html_p42) Depending on how we understand the irruption of the virtual in human consciousness, or the play of images and words in its advent, our first technology could be either the tongue, or the drawing hand. We could in

this latter case conceive of the painting on the walls as inaugurations of the virtual. Virtuality would have broken into human existence with the ability to articulate the world pictorially before it did through the spoken word.

Vilém Flusser proposes this interpretation of technology, as we shall see below.

[2](#index_split_000.html_p44) Here we are emphasizing technical writing, holding in mind, of course, the many other forms of poetic and literary writing that do not fall into this

deadening trap but which had to be learned during the following centuries

following its inception.

[3](#index_split_000.html_p45) It's only for about 4,000 years that linear texts (i.e., scribality) became the dominant bearers of important information. As [Flusser (2006)](#index_split_001.html_p59) argues, before that, image-thinking bore the first modulation of the virtual in human experience, which continued in the margins of culture in the history of painting and the plastic arts. Photography, however, places the image again at the center of experience to modulate virtuality, and forges a path towards

[]{#index_split_001.html_p58} *History of the virtual* 39

the digital that brings images together with words in a new virtual hybrid

whose consequences we will be exploring here.

[4](#index_split_000.html_p47) "Punctum" designated in Latin "th\[e\] wound, th\[e\] prick, th\[e\] mark made by a pointed instrument: \[it\] ... also refers to the notion of punctuation \[...\]

Photographs \[...\] are in effect punctuated, sometimes even speckled with these sensitive points; precisely, these marks, these wounds \[...\]" (Barthes, R. [1981,](#index_split_001.html_p58) p. 27).

[5](#index_split_000.html_p47) The philosopher Charles Sanders Peirce coined the term "indexical," to refer to the gesture of pointing, as this applies to signs that point at something. "I," "now," and "here" are indexicals for they point to what

they mean. Photographs and paintings seem to be, in that sense, both indexical, whereas digital images we would have to say are not, insofar as

they give visual appearance to numerical codes rather than represent reality.

[6](#index_split_001.html_p50) Of course the work of cinema verité and the French nouvelle vague are as important or more important than Neorealism for our purposes. We are, however, not so interested in being faithful to film history as we are in using this particular case as an illustrative example.

now detect and uncover deepfakes (NYT, Nov 25th 2019).

Photography does not create eternity as art does, it embalms time, rescuing it simply from its own proper corruption.

André [Bazin (1967)](#index_split_001.html_p78)

According to [Vilém Flusser (2011),](#index_split_001.html_p78) while animals are "immersed in an animate world," human beings break away from that "four-dimensional space" (p. 6) when the hand intervenes in the world and

makes it an object distinct from the subject that holds it.

Unlike animals, even primates, human beings have hands that

can hold the immediate world at bay, bring it to a stop (so that the

environment is no longer relevant). This extension of the hand

against the world can be called an "action." With this designation,

the lifeworld falls into two areas, the area of the fixed, understood

objects and the area of the "one who understands", whose hand

abstracts the subject from the lifeworld, brackets it out, leaving a

three dimensional universe of graspable objects. (p. 8)

The original, pre-conscious unity is thus lost to the new space that opens with the separation of a subject from the things now abstracted

from their context and placed where deliberate human action be-

comes possible. Without human consciousness, the world of animals

is bound up with what is seen; there is no separation between what is

experienced and what experiences; they are one and the same. It is in

that sense that the animal lives in four dimensions, enclosed, sealed

within them. But becoming conscious, a human subject breaks off

from its embeddedness in the world, and the three-dimensional world

of visible objects is now before him, available for contemplation and

control.

[]{#index_split_001.html_p61}42 *Virtual media*

The same human hand that holds the world at bay, that manip-

ulates it and molds it to the subject's will, turns next to "extending"

the world in images. In the movements of the hand, the image-maker

transmutes his experience onto flat surfaces, giving birth now to a new, two-dimensional world. As phenomenologists point out, the

process here consists of a spontaneous response, an aesthetic expres-

sion of the "intertwining of vision and movement" [(Merleau-Ponty](#index_split_001.html_p78)

[2007,](#index_split_001.html_p78) p. 353), that takes place in the resonating, perceiving body. As

[Merleau-Ponty (2007)](#index_split_001.html_p78) explains, it is by "lending his body to the world that the artist changes the world into paintings" (p. 353).

Immersed in the visible by his body, itself visible, the see-er ...

approaches \[the world\] by looking, he opens onto the world \[...\]

Things are an annex or prolongation of itself; they are encrusted

in its flesh \[...\] Since things and my body are made of the same

stuff ... their manifest visibility must be repeated in the body by a

secret visibility. "Nature is on the inside," says Cézanne. (p. 355)

The image is not, however, the result of "an operation of thought that

would set up before the mind a picture or a representation of a world"

(p. 333). The process antecedes rational thought. It is not "a decision

made by the mind, an absolute doing which would decree, from the

depths of a subjective retreat" (p. 354); it is not, in other words, a

"representation" but the spontaneous response of the body to the

world. This is how the virtual irrupts in human experience, without

the mediation of language or thought, as the result of an aesthetic expression. The virtual brings forth another layer, a further depth to

the world. As [Merleau-Ponty (2007)](#index_split_001.html_p78) writes:

the animals painted on the walls of Lascaux are not there in the

same way as are the fissures and limestone formations. Nor are

they *elsewhere.* Pushed forward here, held back there, supported by the wall's mass they use so adroitly, they radiate about the wall without ever breaking their elusive moorings. I would be hard

pressed to say *where* the painting is I am looking at. For I do not look at it as one looks at a thing, fixing it in its place. My gaze wanders within as in the halos of Being. Rather than seeing it, I see

according to, or with it. (p. 355)

The bison painted on the cave wall is not a replica but an extension of

the world, executed by the play between eye and hand. Even though it

is a thing, it is a peculiar sort of thing. What makes it an image is not

the actual physical markings, but what those markings open up for us.

They not only imitate the appearance of the event (and hold it in time

for us to revisit once the event is no longer there), but also trigger the

[]{#index_split_001.html_p62} *Dimensions of virtuality* 43

imagination that transports it beyond the actual fact thus depicted.

The potency of what we perceive resonates once more in the painted

image, embedded as it is in the body. That distant echo ushers us into

the virtual space of human consciousness. In the image that the hand

draws, the three-dimensional space of action becomes the two-

dimensional space of pictures on flat surfaces, a new "space," a play-

ground for the (human) mind.

Images are intended to serve as models for actions. For although

they show only the surfaces of things, they still show relationships

among things that no one would otherwise suspect. Images don't

show matter; they show what matters. And that allowed the hand

to probe further into the circumstances than before \[...\] they had

to be made accessible, intersubjective, and they had to be

stabilized, stored \[...\] "published." [(Flusser, 2011,](#index_split_001.html_p78) p. 11) Pictorial inscriptions manage to capture experience in static forms, something writing will also do later, to stop the world in space and

subject it to the human gaze, infusing it with our growing con-

sciousness.

Simon [McBurney (2011),](#index_split_001.html_p78) talking about Werner Herzog's documentary on the world's oldest surviving paintings writes that these

artists live in a time where everything was connected:

They lived in an enormous present, which also contained past and

future. A present in which nature was not only contiguous with

them, but continuous. They flowed in and out of a continuum of

everything around them; just as the animals flow into and out of

the rock. As if the rock was alive, so were the animals. Everything

was alive. ("Herzog's Cave of Forgotten Dreams: The real art

underground," *The Guardian*, 17th March)

In that two-dimensional rendering of the world anything can be

connected to anything, for everything can always mean something, as

the primitive mind knows. What emerges, then, is a space of magic, a

space of promiscuous proximities and viable resemblances that in-

flames the imagination. The painted image fuels what [Benjamin](#index_split_001.html_p78)

[(1978)](#index_split_001.html_p78) calls the "mimetic faculty," which he defines as "a rudiment of the powerful compulsion in former times to become and behave like

something else" (pp. 333--336); it creates order and fashions mean-

[ings.1](#index_split_001.html_p77) In that primordial virtuality, "\[o\]mens and maledictions can appear everywhere ... that become unpredictable and frightening \[in\]

a world full of meanings, full of 'gods'" [(Flusser, 2011,](#index_split_001.html_p78) p. 13).

Freed from the onward march of time, the image virtualizes actual experience, rendering all its possible relations surveyable. The caveman

[]{#index_split_001.html_p63}44 *Virtual media*

sees the original scene in the image again, but he is now freed from the

immediacy of reflex action and so able to ponder and deliberate between the multiple options that he can invent in the new virtuality of

the image.

With the technology of writing, another form of inscription ap-

pears, that further advances the evolution of the human virtual.

Meanings and representations are torn from the magical context of

the original pictorial surface and translated into concepts. They are

"lifted," as it were, from the surface of the walls by the same fingers

that used to draw, which now begin to write. Pictorial two-

dimensional surfaces are unraveled into scribal lines. The two-

dimensional image is now condensed into a linear one dimensionality

by this new gesture.

We could say that the virtual that is first modulated by the bodily

imagination in the production of painted images (and in the pro-

duction of concepts in oral language) is now modulated again, and again by the hand. [2](#index_split_001.html_p78) This time, however, the modulation is not a result of the body's spontaneous response in painting (or in words), but of a

cognitive grasp of the world now deliberately articulated in writing.

Oral language is thus superseded too by writing, which institutes a new level of abstraction in the human mind. The result is a conceptual universe of texts, calculations, narratives, and explanations

[(Flusser, 2011),](#index_split_001.html_p78) which the invention of the printing press further expands, thus establishing the scribal form of Western culture for the past 400 years.

But, as we have seen in [Chapter 1,](#index_split_000.html_p40) with the invention of the photograph in 1839, the image comes back to the center of cultural

consciousness. The one-dimensional, linear, hierarchical, process-

oriented, historical way of thinking instituted by the scribal sequence,

now has to compete with the two-dimensional way of the image, as

surface, context, scene -- a space of connections and associations. The

invention of film strengthens the return of the imaginal in the collective. The virtual there, as in the photograph, is no longer simply ideas that we think, but also images that we perceive and feel;

moreover, in the cinema our experience is not static but also kinetic; it

is immersed in moving time. The virtual now can cause us to ex-

perience a feeling of vertigo, for example, whereas in the scribal form

we were protected from such emotional or physical immediacy. With

the image, the bodily dimension with its sensuality comes back. The

virtual is now not only rationally but also affectively modulated.

Because of the reinsertion of the image into culture by the photograph

and the movies, we no longer experience, perceive, and value the

world and ourselves in a dramatic, linear plot, but in fields of relationships, networks of meanings, and random associations

(cf., [Murphie, 2002,](#index_split_001.html_p78) p. 192).

[]{#index_split_001.html_p64} *Dimensions of virtuality* 45

In the reshuffling that took place with the advent of the broadcast

voice in the radio at the beginning of the 20th century, as [Havelock](#index_split_001.html_p78)

[(1986)](#index_split_001.html_p78) observes, there was no return to the oral but a "forced marriage, or remarriage between the resources of the written word and of

the spoken, \[...\] reinforc\[ing\] the latent energies of both parties"

(p. 33). Likewise, what happens with the advent of photography, is by

no means merely a reversion back from writing to the image either.

Half visual image, half writing -- more a product of blueprints and manual instructions, than of the world -- the "technical image" is a hybrid, behind which the written word is always lurking. "As apparatuses themselves are the products of applied scientific [texts," Flusser](#index_split_001.html_p78)

[(2006)](#index_split_001.html_p78) explains,

in the case of technical images one is dealing with the indirect products of scientific texts \[...\] Television and cinema are on a

different level of existence from caves and the Etruscans. (p. 17)

After scribal culture's long marginalization of sensibility, the body and

the imagination return to the center of culture with the technical image. This strange symbiosis, however, in which the image enters

with writing, threatens to disconnect it from the actual experience it

purports to signify.

In mechanically restructuring the sensory stimuli, the camera

compromises or diminishes the physical continuity between object

and perception that characterizes the traditional (drawn or painted) image. The technical image emerges now, not according to the

spontaneous whim or creativity of the painter but according to a

preconceived format. Whereas traditional images signify phenomena,

we could say, technical images signify instead concepts. With the

camera we focus on the world not as we do on an object of vision, open to the live interaction between my spontaneous, attentive body

and its senses, subjectively impressionable, but to the recording or compiling of information by a technical device. Mechanically

grasped, received, and taken, the scene before us lives only within the

confines of a predetermined set of possibilities in the camera. The world through the camera is no longer a world of objects but, more

and more, a world of mental constructs of codified images played on

our screens. "Instead of representing the world, \[technical images\]

obscure it until human beings' lives finally become a function of the

images they create" [(Flusser, 2006,](#index_split_001.html_p78) p. 17).

The tourist that sees New York through her camera lens is indeed

having an experience, but it has little to do with her actual perception

of New York. Her experience becomes a function of her images rather

than the other way around. A mechanical take from reality is trans-

lated into a photographic representation that is, however, (partially)

[]{#index_split_001.html_p65}46 *Virtual media*

disconnected from her own subjectivity. What she will get from it when she sees the photograph will be external to the original experience, even if because of its similarity, the photograph may

evoke it.

In this hollowed-out image, mediated by the automatic camera

program, nothing needs to be about the world any more. The pho-

tographic representation lacks, therefore, a certain type of existential

depth of experience for, as Flusser observes:

Human beings cease to decode the images and instead project

them, still encoded, into the world 'out there', which meanwhile

itself becomes like an image -- a context of scenes, of states of things \[...\] Human beings forget they created the images in order

to orientate themselves in the world. Since they are no longer able

to decode them, their lives become a function of their own

images: imagination has turned into hallucination. [(Flusser,](#index_split_001.html_p78)

[2011,](#index_split_001.html_p78) p. 10)

As Flusser pointed out already in the eighties, it is increasingly true that everyday activity now aspires to be registered, whether in a photo

or a video; it has to be translated into a screen, converted into a technical image in order to be operative or functional in the social world today, even in order to acquire experiential legitimacy. Insofar

as its origin has been displaced or, in this case, intervened by an ap-

paratus, there is in the technical image a loss of depth or (to use Benjamin's words again) of the aureatic.

In potentiating the photographic capture by means of computa-

tional calculations, digitization dramatically brings back the hege-

mony of the rational and completes the path of abstraction that had

developed up to this point. Moreover, as we saw in [Chapter 1,](#index_split_000.html_p40) the empirical connection that still provided the analog image with a

foothold in the world, despite its being mechanically modulated, is now completely severed. The digital image ends up being as distanced

from the sensible world it supposedly represents as the concept in writing was.

As photographers (analogical or digital), we begin to attend to

reality in a very different way than we did when our images were not

technologically mediated:

If \[photographers\] look through the camera out into the world,

this is not because the world interests them, but because they are

pursuing new possibilities of producing information and evalu-

ating the photographic program. Their interest is concentrated on

the camera; for them, the world is purely a pretext for the

realization of camera possibilities. In short: they are not working,

[]{#index_split_001.html_p66} *Dimensions of virtuality* 47

they do not want to change the world, but they are in search of

information. [(Flusser, 2006,](#index_split_001.html_p78) p. 26)

By turning from writing to the technical (analogic and digital) image,

we are not going back to the initial two dimensional space of tradi-

tional images. As [Flusser (2006)](#index_split_001.html_p78) sees it, we are making one more step in a trajectory of increasing abstractness or withdrawal from concrete

reality:

Humanity has climbed \[a\] ladder step by step from concrete

toward higher and higher levels of abstraction: a model of

cultural history and the alienation of human beings from the

concrete. (p. 6)

The one-dimensional world inaugurated by writing is now left be-

hind as we enter into the zero dimensionality of 0s and 1s. The apparatus now finally breaks altogether with the sensible contact of

the world; the light that touches the photographic paper that reacts

to it due to its material properties and the laws of their relation to

light rays is replaced by the coordinates assigned to each point in

space in the digital grid. The image that emerges from this process is

artificially extracted from it. Nevertheless, the magic of the traditional image, that had been shattered by the linearity of writing, comes back to life in the digital. At the same time that, as we have

said, it reinforces the rational order, the digital image in the end also

subverts it.

From one perspective the photograph enriches us, insofar as it

brings back to collective consciousness the sensuality of the image, and so complexifies our scribal world. But there is also a sense, as we

have just seen, in which the digital takes away precisely the connec-

tion with the sensible that the analog photographic image brought by

virtue of its direct contact with empirical reality. It is completely gone

with the digital. It does not receive the image and modulate it, but recodifies it, translates it into a language that has nothing to do with

the sensual, and so breaks the physical bond that images had traditionally enjoyed and promoted. We see with the digital a reinsertion

of the image but a further distancing from the sensoriality of

the body.

As we move on with our explorations, we will continuously witness

this oscillation in how we perceive the digital image, which insofar as

it is an image in some sense reconnects our body to the sensuality of

the world, but insofar as mathematically operated becomes instead a

modulation that moves further along the path of disengagement from

experience for the sake of rational abstraction.

[***b From the virtual to virtual reality***](#index_split_000.html_p10)

"What has God wrought?"

(first telegraphic message)[3](#index_split_001.html_p78)

Every new technology modulates the virtual differently. Speech mod-

ulated the virtual in the intellectual space of discourse, where it takes shape primarily through the logical associations between words,

their syntax and grammar. The first human who drew a picture on a

cave wall, or a pictogram on a stone tablet, was further modulating the virtual in the aesthetic space of perception, where it takes shape

through the associations suggested to the eye by the inscriptions.

Scribal logic prevailed in the West, after the invention of the alphabet,

because of the simplicity and easy dissemination of writing. But with

the invention of photography and film in the 20th century, the col-

lective rational discourse that determined Western culture, with its stress on logical reason, gives way again to the thought of images in

the qualified sense in which we have just seen.

Whereas photography suspends moments of time from actual ex-

perience in images, film liberates the image from the constraints of physical existence. For the first time in human history, the virtual is

modulated as light projected on a screen. Just as with writing, experience is also embalmed, but now in an ethereal form and move-

ment that is beyond the material. Photographic images bring together

both the presence and absence of what they project in singular

phantasmatic entities, that both are and are not in the empirical. But

film, as we have seen, which is photographic images in motion, fur-

ther modulates time, lifting the image out of actual flowing experience creating a second track of temporal movement. Time is no longer

just the necessary condition of experience, the flowing river of con-

sciousness that accompanies all our perceptions. Contrary to

Heraclitus' proclamation that we cannot enter the same river twice, we can say that we can step into the same river as many times as we

want with film.

In the concrete images of the caveman, in pictograms on a stone

tablet, in written signs and photographic images on paper, the virtual

is placed/materialized outside our minds. If we take the virtual to be

the potential kept within everything that we perceive, then in the representational act of writing, drawing, and photography, that potential is sedimented in its actualized form. With the film screen -- and

even more with the digital screen -- a further development takes place

in the modulation of the virtual.

When we look at pictures in a physical album and rearrange them in

different orders, for example, in terms of different criteria than those

[]{#index_split_001.html_p68} *Dimensions of virtuality* 49

that had previously determined their order (instead of chronologically,

we might arrange them geographically, in terms of the places where they were taken), the actualization of the alternatives forged by the imagination takes place at the expense of their virtuality. Once I arrange them in this order, the multiple other possible arrangements that

were virtually present have settled upon one option, so that the virtual

is materialized and sedimented into one actual ordering. But in the virtual world, on the contrary, any actualization remains potential, pregnant with further possibilities, pulsating in its virtuality. On the digital screen, the actualized virtual, though actual, remains permeable,

always open to change. This fusion of actual and virtual that takes place

in cyberspace -- this hyper-presence of the virtual, as we might call it --

makes experience incessantly fluid and changing, and susceptible to unlimited manipulation. In other words, its plasticity makes reality susceptible to either distortion or enhancement.

[**2 Virtuality and experience**](#index_split_000.html_p11)

[***a Post-truth***](#index_split_000.html_p11)

In the virtual world we are able, then, to isolate the pieces of past

living experience that have been captured by film, and -- because

they are still pulsating with movement and alive -- to bring forth from them their yet unrealized possibilities. In the digital screen, paradoxically, the virtual is actualized while still remaining virtual.

This constitutes its irresistible temptation, for options are never exhausted by any particular actualization; what is actual always

remains virtually alive. Virtual hybrids of past moments can be

generated, which, in their newly edited arrangements, allow us to

re-live them in novel ways. We can now not just change the order of

experience and create new patterns and meanings, but also play

with past, future, and present time, and so generate events that, although non-existent in the physical world, add a novel virtual

dimension to our experience. As Stiegler put it, "it is an electric light, set free by materials from deep within the belly of the earth.

An electronic, that is to say, a decompos\[ing\] light" [(Derrida and](#index_split_001.html_p78)

[Stiegler, 2002,](#index_split_001.html_p78) p. 153).

This newly acquired capacity has enormous potential, even though

it begins to wreak havoc in our normal perception of the world and

our experience of time. Whereas the scribal tradition is married to truth and ideology, the digital is instead open to a plurality of points

of view, seeing ever-new aspects and connections. So the digital does

away with ideology insofar as "ideology is about the truth, one truth,

my truth" [(Flusser, 1990).](#index_split_001.html_p78) The more points of view it can collect, the better the picture.

[]{#index_split_001.html_p69}50 *Virtual media*

Just as writing changed the way in which we thought of and per-

ceived the world, constituting both in terms of rational logic and se-

quential orderings, the virtual image does away with the scribal world

of theories and explanations. This technological wizardry threatens

"objectivity," as [Mitchell (1992)](#index_split_001.html_p78) pointed out already at the beginning of the nineties, anticipating phenomena as familiar to us today as deep fakes, catfishing, fakenews, etc.:

Naive enthusiasm for the almost magical possibilities of this new

electronic medium soon gave way to alarm. It was a short step, we

began to realize, from innocuous enhancement or retouching to

potentially misleading or even intentionally deceptive alteration

of image content. And that step would put us on a slippery slope:

the smug apartheid that we have maintained between the

objective, scientific discourses of photography and the subjective,

artistic discourses of the synthesized image seemed in danger of

breaking down. (p. 16)

[James Bridle (2018)](#index_split_001.html_p78) poignantly illustrates this breakdown between the objective and the subjective when he tells of a man that, returning from a holiday with his phone full of photos, noticed an anomaly while browsing through them:

In one image, he saw himself and his wife at a table in a

restaurant, both smiling at the camera. But this photograph

had never been taken. At lunch one day, his father had held the

button down on his iPhone a little long, resulting in a burst of

images of the same scene ... \[He\] uploaded two of them to see

which his wife preferred. In one, he was smiling, but his wife

was not; in the other, his wife was smiling, but he was not.

From these two images, taken seconds apart, Google's photo

sorting algorithms had conjured a third: a composite in which

both subjects were smiling their "best." The algorithm was part

of a package called AutoAwesome (since renamed, simply

"Assistant"), which performed a range of tweaks on uploaded

images to make them more "awesome"---applying nostalgic

filters, turning them into charming animations and so forth.

But in this case, the result was a photograph of a moment that

had never happened: a false memory, a rewriting of his-

tory. (p. 152)

The seamlessness of the digital in our everyday experience is in-

creasingly such, that the difference between virtual and real becomes

ever more difficult to discern, and the valences of our world come out

[]{#index_split_001.html_p70} *Dimensions of virtuality* 51

of joint. Guy [Debord (2012),](#index_split_001.html_p78) talking about what he called the Society of the Spectacle, wrote in 1967:

Images detached from every aspect of life merge into a common

stream, and the former unity of life is lost forever. Apprehended in

a *partial* way, reality unfolds in a new generality as a pseudo-world apart ... All that once was directly lived has become mere

representation. (p. 12)

This emphasis on the apprehension of reality as appearance or re-

presentation eventually involves the displacement of truth as a necessary element of communication. The world we live in begins to

change in initially imperceptible ways, which may in the end have significant consequences, as we can witness in our time with the

phenomenon (or cultural condition) of post-truth, where the blurring

of the borders between what is real and what is falsely represented as

real, confuses the public into whatever new reality it is possible to weave on screen. In that way, we may find ourselves in a world where

there is no reliable order, or where different orders acquire their va-

lidity and status in terms of their utility, their persuasiveness, or anything else, and not for any truth they stand for.

"In a world that has been really deranged," writes [Debord (2012),](#index_split_001.html_p78)

"the truth is a moment of falsehood" (p. 14). And, indeed, only in a

such a world could one affirm, as some politicians actually have, that

"truth is not the truth," or that there are "alternative facts" that ap-

parently establish a parallel world where one operates according to criteria that are alien to the truth. And in the confusion that begins to

reign in our culture between these parallel worlds, the edges that distinguish the true from the false, fiction from reality, the virtual from the real, are blurred, and a new order begins to emerge, or rather

a disconcerting disorder, where lies are viralized and where sentiment

and opinion begin to displace truth and fact everywhere. Post-truth is,

in this sense, the symptom of an effectively deranged culture; deranged by the emergence of social networks and the advent of the virtual world, where the effect of what is said is worth more than what

is said, and where the emotional impact of the image, how it stirs the

passions, displaces reality.

Stiegler [(Derrida and Stiegler, 2002)](#index_split_001.html_p78) observes that when we start living in the world mediated by all kinds of technological prosthetics,

or through a screen, the very conditions under which we have ac-

quired our beliefs up until then are altered. In digital virtuality, these

are grounded indifferently in real events and "alternative facts," on realities as well as in mere opinions or assemblages. Our life has spread

into the virtuality of the screen to such an extent that if someone says

that something happened and builds a narrative in the media

[]{#index_split_001.html_p71}52 *Virtual media*

powerful enough to represent it, then it happened. In the same way, if

I say that something did not happen, and point to the inconsistencies

or irregularities of its virtual presentation, sowing doubt about the veracity of the image, then maybe it did not happen, or did not happen the way it is being presented. Faced with the epistemological

promiscuity of the virtual screen, the objective criteria of truth become obsolete in the new digital order.

If I can imagine how something could happen, and present in video

form a realistic representation of that fantasy, it can be difficult for the mind to sort through whether it happened or not. We see this all the

time in our late night political satire where video images, manipulated

for comic effect, show, for example, a political figure or a celebrity saying or doing something that is in stark contrast to what, in real life, he or she would actually say or do. This leaves us disoriented, as the video presentation of the occurrence imprints in our mind a sense of truth even

though we know at another level it is only a wishful fantasy, a joke.

Since we associate the computer screen with the transmission of real

events occurring in real time, nothing escapes digital representation.

We automatically accept what we see without distinguishing the live

transmission from its deferred edition, the actual fact from the virtual

event. We accept the representations as if they were the truth, although it is possible that they no longer correspond to anything

"real" outside their own creation.

Not only can the virtual image surreptitiously distort our perception

of reality; sometimes it is the virtual image that determines reality be-

yond the facts themselves. Just consider, for example, the diminishing

authority of the sports referee in the age of instant replay, to see how

the image on the screen becomes reality and our perception its in-accurate copy. As [Doel and Clarke (1999)](#index_split_001.html_p78) observe, "what until now represented the real is increasingly subject to the hyperreality of real-time recording" (p. 270). And the power to manipulate reality, to create

"truth" as such, is a byproduct of the digital era. In a very concrete sense, everything becomes a game of images, where the value of what is

said does not lie in its correspondence with any reality, but in the effect it produces at this moment, in the impact that it is capable of provoking through social networks, in their exposure in the virtual world.

What we call post-truth is the displacement of truth by a hybrid that is validated by very different criteria than those we know, that are

sometimes even contrary to what is reality. Perhaps more im-

portantly: it is no longer just ideas, nor thought sequences, nor arguments, nor discourses that build the world, but rather images,

panoramic visions, totalizing representations that appeal to our feel-

ings, our fears and desires, and incite our false opinions and ill-founded beliefs. The digital fusion of text, sound, and image, which

occurs in the virtual screen, and the possibility of immediate

[]{#index_split_001.html_p72} *Dimensions of virtuality* 53

reproduction and the ease and speed of communication in virtual

networks, provide the perfect means to replicate the virus of post-truth more and more effectively.

Beyond disrupting the normal criteria that distinguish fact from

fiction, virtual and real, the concoction of digital images we are sub-

jected to in this post-truth era seems to replace one dimension of reality with which we are familiar with an incommensurable and

disconcerting other which, unmoored from our reliable references,

suspends us in a void. Truth and falsity, fact or fiction, real and virtual seem to merge and in this indistinct space all polarities become mute.

However, from below this opaque limbo of rising uncertainty, an

entirely new horizon may yet emerge.

It is worth noting that the screens of our smartphones place at our

entire disposal, at the minimum cost of a single click, a universe of infinite possibilities entirely designed to please and anticipate, often

even provoke, our desires. It therefore becomes obvious that post-

truth is something more complex than the mere devaluation of truth.

It challenges us to assume a reality in which truth no longer counts,

and where passions and emotions override it. Now, our moral re-

sistance to this devaluation of truth, strong as it is and justified as it

seems, may be ignoring that what is happening calls forth a re-

consideration of the very nature and purpose of communication, of

life in society.

When the scribal mind confronts and is challenged by the digital,

all the structures that had until now guaranteed stability and safety,

protecting us from the adversity of the world, shudder. The vital forces

that had been channeled and contained by reason's sedimented no-

tions, dogmatic principles and laws, are set loose by the onset of the

rhizomatic nature of the digital so that repressed psychic forces break

free and run amock, bringing chaos and disorder to the world. The troubling phenomenon of post-truth becomes, in the beginning, the

breeding ground for the darkest passions and the lowest human in-

tentions that express themselves in the destruction and disorder that

we are witnessing, greatly potentiated today by the onset of digitality.

But perhaps it is now in this darkness that the occasion presents itself

to move precisely in the direction pointed to by Ortega's premonition

that ours is the time for the exploration of human sensibility and vi-

tality. As Nietzsche once proclaimed, "everything \[...\] we call today culture, education, civilisation will have to appear \[...\] before the infallible judgement of Dionysos" [(Ortega y Gasset, 1961,](#index_split_001.html_p78) p. 58).

[***b Laboratory of subjectivity***](#index_split_000.html_p11)

Thanks to virtual spaces like Twitter or Snapchat or Instagram, TikTok,

blogs, and podcasts, there are now many more and different ways of

[]{#index_split_001.html_p73}54 *Virtual media*

relating, communicating, and expressing than ever before; ways that,

quite apart from their undeniable perils, also broaden our world and open yet unexplored dimensions of human experience. In the communication that takes place on the web, thanks to the invisibility with

which we might cloak ourselves in our interactions, thoughts and ex-

periences are expressed and articulated that used to remain trapped in

mute, individual private experience. These now become not just shared

and public -- enhancing one's own personal awareness in the emerging

intersubjective discourse -- but they also begin to constitute a new collective. Feelings and actions seem to open, in novel and complex ways, to whole new areas of interactive meaning and possible aspects of

relating (to) things, which may be recovering connections and modes

of awareness once lost to what was repressed by tradition.

Whereas in reality, space and time limit our possible experiences

and our visual perception under the weight of various kinds of pre-judice, insofar as the virtual world can be color-blind, these limitations are done away with for the identity of who presents themself to

us is never guaranteed; we can, for instance, develop very strong feelings about another person without ever being sure of who they are, or even knowing their gender, ethnicity, or culture.

In earlier times, talking about intimate experiences was very un-

common, except in confession or with our closest friends and family.

Doing it publicly was inconceivable. Today, this reticence gives way to

the unprecedented phenomenon of virtual life, where we are driven to

publicly share even the most private and personal thoughts, feelings,

beliefs, and images.

The breakdown of what [Mitchell (1992)](#index_split_001.html_p78) calls the "apartheid qualities" of our scribal world have many unforeseen possibilities. When

Facebook, for instance, provides us with a video of our Saturday, with

the images of the activities we have been capturing during the day on

our smartphone (playing with the kids, walking the dog, jogging,

visiting the market, etc.), by amalgamating them into a video clip, our

virtual life expands our perception and memory of the day. The

memories randomly captured through the digital suddenly become

autonomous and provide us with a new string of associations that are

affectively alive, producing new perceptions that expand our reality.

Or when an algorithm begins to bombard us with memories from the

past, there is no telling how many unexpected consequences that may

have on our sense of our day, in our sense of time, especially as the

past is now becoming so blurred with the present. The virtual temporal flow, its pace and rhythm, begins to erase the distinction between reality and fiction and undermines our notions of truth and authenticity. What we see belongs in a parallel plane of virtual spatiotemporality that, insofar as it is integrated with our experience, con-

fuses or muddles the actual spatio-temporal coordinates that hold it.

[]{#index_split_001.html_p74} *Dimensions of virtuality* 55

We don't even have to generate these virtual moments; they are

generated for us (and usually for no pure motives), thickening our existence with layers of virtual residue that can change the course of

our days.

Consider Emily [Witt (2016),](#index_split_001.html_p78) who interviewed several women who found sexual satisfaction performing for strangers on various webcam

sites. Internet sexual women, as Witt calls them, in some cases lived in

small towns where the dating pool was limited, or they were victims

of sexual trauma. As she writes, "digital sexuality allows for possibi-

lities of anonymity, gender-bending, fetish play and other modes of

experimentation with a degree of safety and autonomy that's not

present in the physical world" (in [Williams, 2019).](#index_split_001.html_p78)

The digital medium offers us the power to articulate what can be an

extremely personal experience, which, digitally encoded, ceases to be a

simple personal testimony and becomes exemplary for the collective.

The *personal* revelation, in a node of plural and public interactivity, becomes a universalized concept. The virtual world generates, in other

words, blueprints of psychic constellations, systems of possibilities where the individual in virtuality is able to come closer to experiences

and facts than she was able to consider or even articulate in her world

before. In digital life, she recognizes the contours of feelings that she

can explore in a practical and ludic way in order to open herself to new

experiences. Whereas it is habitual for us, especially in the Western world, to replace experience with our conceptual grasp of it, in the virtual world, the concept is incarnated in the actuality of digital life.

We no longer just think our thoughts and fantasies. We live them out

in the virtual world. In this way, feelings and sensations, intuitions and images, projections and the work of self-articulation become

available in the full range of possible digital interplay that makes them

susceptible to experimentation and reflection. The virtual world

thus becomes a laboratory of subjectivity, where a new kind of self-knowledge is forged.

People nowadays collect in their smartphones images of their sur-

roundings and of other people. They will dwell on them, magnify

them, reduce them, inspect them, fantasize, share, and talk with

others about them. They may never see the object of their exploration

again, but that is not important. What is important is the opportunity

that is offered by the digital capture to explore the empirical world and convert it into a screen upon which to project the resonances that

arise from this virtual contact.

Of course, there is the danger of addiction, of feeding one's obses-

sions or generating new ones that may affect our lives negatively. But

in essence the process plays the same role as what took place in pre-

digital times, when adolescents spent the day listening to their vinyls,

again and again, totally immersed, undergoing an experience that,

[]{#index_split_001.html_p75}56 *Virtual media*

even though solipsistic, was transformative. The lyrics of their songs

became ways of articulating their emotional lives, of making con-

scious what they otherwise could not have, with the subsequent in-

creased awareness. The difference, however, lies in the way the virtual

is modulated in the digital, and how it enables the public sharing and

bringing to collective awareness otherwise private experiences. They

are submitted in the virtual platform to others, whose responses -- as if

from a spectral choir, tragic or dramatic, lyrical or humorous -- help

us discern and make common unexplored dimensions of our

subjective life.

[*i San Junipero*](#index_split_000.html_p11)

In his iconic television series, *Black Mirror*, Charlie Brooker offers us, in the episode "San Junipero," an illustration of the experimental potential of the virtual. There, in that virtual "beach town" called by

that name, people are "downloaded" for a full immersive experience

of their youthful days. It's your typical role-play game, except the character you play is nobody else but you, young and in the past. We

soon learn that the "San Junipero System" of virtual reality is used by

terminal patients for what they call "immersive nostalgia therapy" to

help them cope with their bodily demise. But it is also considered, by

some, as an afterlife option, a sort of virtual heaven where you can

"pass over" -- after the death of your body -- to live your youth endlessly.

There are two characters in the episode: Kelly, who we first see as

a dashing young woman in her 20s, and Yorkie, a curious and ra-

ther nerdy-looking bespectacled woman, in the same age bracket.

They are in San Junipero, *virtually* there, in 1987. In their real life, which is sometime in our very near future, they are both in their

late 70s. Yorkie is quadraplegic, bed-ridden since her 20s, and Kelly

is dying of terminal cancer. They "visit" San Junipero for a few hours every weekend. Yorkie is exploring it as a possible permanent virtual destiny, to "pass over" when she dies, whereas Kelly

visits to have fun and do all the things she never dared before she

dies. They meet there and become erotically involved. Yorkie lives

out her sexuality for the first time and falls in love with Kelly, but

Kelly resists the emotional pull of the relationship, because of her

belief that this virtual stuff is just for fun. As she tells Yorkie, she

does not do feelings. But the loving feelings she starts to experience for Yorkie lead her to question the actual attachments in her

life and her relation to this virtual world. Eventually, Kelly visits

Yorkie in real time, at the clinic where she lies in bed motionless,

and mute. Moved by her visit and Yorkie's story, Kelly offers to marry her in order to sign the euthanasia papers Yorkie needs to

[]{#index_split_001.html_p76} *Dimensions of virtuality* 57

legally disconnect her body and "pass over" to the virtual heaven

for good.

As the story develops, Kelly is visiting Yorkie for the first time since

she "passed over" and became a permanent resident. Visibly ex-

hilarated, Yorkie brushes her feet on the sand and, shrieking in delight, bangs the car with her hand to prove it's real. She pleads with

Kelly to consider passing over too, so they can live together in San Junipero forever. But Kelly resists. They begin an argument that ends

in a terrible fight. Yorkie's puerile analysis of what she takes as Kelly's dilemma (whether to stay true to her dead husband or "pass over" to

be with Yorkie), judging her marital bond with the immaturity and naïveté of the 21-year-old she must still be emotionally, enrages Kelly.

She forces Kelly to weigh her feelings, now, in the virtual, against her

total life, which is no longer just about her but also about her husband, her daughter, and their shared grief over their child's early death, and the arguments and feelings they had had around their

afterlife. The virtual reality of San Junipero suddenly leaks into the real, and Kelly is forced to confront her belief in the difference between them.

Can the youthful, vital excitement she is experiencing in her virtual

20's outweigh the trials and tribulations of married life, her 49-year bond with her husband? For Yorkie, who has had no experience or

attachments for practically her whole life, San Junipero has been very

important to her. Kelly, on the other hand, has always seen it as merely an "immersive nostalgia therapy," providing her with the

entertainment of a virtual reality experience of her own memories

that diverts from her ailing body. She has never taken it as a serious

afterlife alternative, but her skepticism seems suddenly shaken by her

growing feelings for her virtual lover.

Our subjective life, our feelings and emotions, seem not to dis-

criminate between real and virtual. The arrows of Eros move freely between them, traversing both. What we imagine frequently finds its

way into our reality: We plan our life in this way, and whatever we

achieve or don't achieve is a matter of our success in actualizing the

virtual; our fears may have a completely virtual source and yet they

are actualized in our actions and attitudes in life; when we imagine

that we can change the world and embark on the many enterprises

that will carry us probably for the rest of our lives, we actualize vir-

tuality, which infuses our thoughts and actions in reality. Or when we

dream and try to make our dreams come true, or fall in love and weave

the web of fantasy, it inspires us to hold our desire and make it grow.

The real and the virtual do not seem to be opposites, but quite to the

contrary interdependent, complementary, porous to one another. We

don't need to stick to the story in San Junipero to validate this claim.

How many couples have we not heard about or known that have met

[]{#index_split_001.html_p77}58 *Virtual media*

on the web, fallen in love, then met in real life and lived happily ever

after? Brooker's fantasy points merely half a step ahead, where full immersive virtual experience can be seen as nothing but a further technological way to do what we have always done with our minds: to

tell stories and compose narratives that help us to articulate ourselves

to others and give direction to our lives. The virtual serves Yorkie in

her new self-discovery and becomes, for Kelly, too, a place where she

finds herself experiencing new feelings, moved to compassion for

Yorkie's septuagenarian quadriplegic self, trapped in the real world just as she also feels real passion and joy with her, as the young woman she has met in San Junipero.

Reality and virtuality, in other words, have never been too far from

one another in real life. We have always, ever since we learned to speak,

navigated from one to the other, nurturing one with the other. Until

the advent of the mass media, we have lived their intersection privately

by withdrawing into our own subjectivities. Now, with virtual reality,

we can not only introvert into ourselves, but into the intersubjective,

digital world. Although we tend to consider the virtual as a fake copy of

the real, a mere representation of reality, it has become a virtual play-

ground that complements and enlarges our reality by introducing a

new possible real, where the virtual does not merely copy or repeat, but

engenders wholly singular and novel creations.

San Junipero, regardless of whether it is possible or not to download

our souls into a digital chip, conceives the virtual as that space of transit, where the imagination is free from the bonds of sedimented

concepts and identities. Insofar as the virtual and the real interact, what happens in the virtual is actual experience; it is not just a simulation, but something that is woven into the fabric of life and complicates or complexifies it.

The question that lurks in the background is the question about the

truth of our virtual experiences, the existential status of the virtual copy, which we will be addressing in what follows [(Part II).](#index_split_001.html_p80) It directly pertains to how we begin to live and slowly to understand -- both individually and collectively -- the relation between real and virtual,

their connection, and interdependence. Perhaps more poignantly

than ever before, digital technology, in the advent of the virtual world, confronts us with the complexity of this question, and with how it bears, ultimately, on our difficult relationship with death and

mortality.

**Notes**

[1](#index_split_001.html_p62) The advent of writing and the prevalence of the scribal mind has brought about the demise of that faculty, and it is a question for the digital, as we will see, if it resurrects or simply transforms it.

[**Introduction to Part II**](#index_split_000.html_p11)

It is thought that with the advent of digital virtuality, we have entered

into a new era where the virtual dimension is radically transforming

the way we live and perceive the world. However, as we have already

seen in our exploration of virtual media, virtuality is not a feature belonging exclusively to the digital, but rather it is an intrinsic dimension of the real, always active, always impacting our experience.

Even if it is true that the omnipresence of the digital has brought it to

prominence for us today, as we will see in this second part of the book,

we can better grasp the revolution and crisis we are living by examining the dynamic and puzzling relationship between the virtual

and the real, that ultimately defies any fixed categorization.

Embedded in any particular perspective on what technology means

to us is a set of assumptions about the interrelationship between material reality -- the world of things and objects that we encounter

outside ourselves -- and virtuality, that dynamic sense of potentiality

and possibility that is inherently immaterial. Whether and how the virtual and real line up or don't line up, or are in opposition with one

another or in creative play, these are assumptions that resolve

themselves into very particular stances that attempt to fix their

meaning.

Entering into the singular phenomenology of these stances, we

will draw from their distinct intelligence the philosophical and

psychological assumptions embedded in them. The radical inter-

changeability between real and virtual makes it nearly impossible to

definitively determine them. And we take that fact as something to

be contended with, not explained away. We will deliberately resist

the impulse to take sides, faithful to the complexity that is revealed

by their tension. Only by holding together each stance's voice and

their critiques, will we prevent the polarization that occludes their

pharmacological nature and allow their utter unresolvability to

strike us.

[]{#index_split_001.html_p81}62 *Evolving conceptions*

Moreover, each particular perspective on how the virtual and the

real relate to one another always casts a shadow, always leaves

something out. But being attuned to their play and allowing their differences to remain in generative dialogue, we will see how one stance can suddenly change into the other, thus enacting a tendency

of words and things, when taken to their extreme, to revert into their

opposite, what the Greeks called an *enantiodromia.* Thus, as we probe each stance and each critique, we will experience together, as writers

and readers, a certain kind of vertigo. We believe that the discourse

around technology must be situated in this fracturing, boundary-

unsettling dynamic.

Psychoanalysis is thoroughly attuned to the highly complex set of

interrelations between fantasy and reality, terms that have the same

kind of metonymic play as the "real" and the "virtual." Hence, in its

theoretical elucidation of the intrapsychic and intersubjective di-

mensions of unconscious life, psychoanalysis can shed its own unique

light on the nature of the virtual. The perilous dance of the pharmakon, between healing and poisoning, resonates with the psycho-

analytic idea that an important aspect of treatment involves the

analyst allowing herself to be infected by the patient's illness [(Ogden,](#index_split_001.html_p59)

[2001).](#index_split_001.html_p59) Only by taking it inside herself, knowing it from within, can the analyst make genuine, existential contact with what the patient is

suffering, thus making it more real to both. One cannot get to the remedy (i.e., therapeutic growth) without carefully working one's way

through the poison.

We intend similarly to enter into our technological issues by al-

lowing ourselves to be infected by the poison of the profound contradictions in the force field between the virtual and the real that we

are living in contemporary digital culture. In an even more dramatic

image from psychoanalysis, our goal is not to heal or cure, but to keep

open the wound that is pushing us full force into a digitally permeated life-world [(LaPlanche, 2015).](#index_split_001.html_p59) We are certainly not aiming at some kind of premature closure that suggests we know where any of

this is headed; rather, we steadfastly embrace the utterly contradictory

uncertainties that form the unconscious backdrop to all of our posi-

tive knowledge about digital life. At this stage of the book, we want to

invoke a mode of thinking that, being disposed to affectively charged,

lived experience, draws us closer to this wound and challenges the dominant contemporary discourse on technology which, in pursuing

clean and clear-cut divisions between virtual and real, always ends up

in a polarization that freezes thought.

[]{#index_split_001.html_p82}[**3 Two stances on the virtual**](#index_split_000.html_p11)

[**and the real**](#index_split_000.html_p11)

[**1 Stance one: The inherent fakeness of the virtual**](#index_split_000.html_p11)

What we will call "the first stance" is a view that understands the virtual as a false approximation of the real, a copy or simulation, merely an imitation of reality, that never reaches the ontological status of "real." As [Doel and Clarke (1999),](#index_split_001.html_p58) whose incisive essay we will draw from, express it:

\[T\]he virtual is to the real as a copy is to the original: it is nothing

more than a reflection, a representation, and a reproduction... \[It

is\] secondary, derivative, and supplemental. Superficial, decora-

tive, and accessorized, it has nothing essential about it. It

participates without belonging. (p. 262)

A strict ontological split between the virtual and the real is assumed

here. Moreover, that ontological separation is conceived of quantita-

tively. The virtual is less substantial than the real: not different but lesser. It hovers over events, mirroring them without ever actually belonging or attaching to them. It is a simulation that lacks the vitality and authenticity that arises out of an encounter with the real.

The virtual user is removed from the fullness of "real" human

existence.

This conception of the relation between the virtual and the real

emphasizes how the quality of sensory experience is lessened by

the virtual; the aesthetic intensity of the encounter with concrete

reality is diminished in that simulation. If, as [Kant (1992,](#index_split_001.html_p59) I, §6) sees it, the liveliness of aesthetic experience is a function of the play between reason and imagination, then in the virtual that play

has been annulled, the tension dissolved or broken and the quality

of experience flattened. Virtuality, taken as a simulation of reality,

not only eliminates the essential tension in that play but also

diminishes imagination, creating a state of indifference and

tepidity in us.

[]{#index_split_001.html_p83}64 *Evolving conceptions*

Moreover, we become psychologically invested in our virtual si-

mulations because they provide a defensive shield against the messi-

ness and intractability of reality, the time-space drag of the real, that

impedes the expeditious fulfilment of what we want, when we want it

[(Doel and Clarke, 1999).](#index_split_001.html_p58) Reality is reduced to the controllable and predictable nature of the copy that is perfectly designed to fulfill our

wishes, thus liberating us from the obdurate density of the real. No longer slowed down by the exigencies of matter, space, and time,

desire and its fulfilments live in the unbroken circuit of virtual relations that overcomes the frustrations and obstacles attendant to everyday life.

We are increasingly living in a time when simulated realities med-

iate our access to the real. The moment we switch on, we enter a phantasmatic world that obviates the disjointed and fragmentary

nature of life and experience. Just as the Lacanian infant constructs a

false image of wholeness by gazing at herself in the mirror [(Lacan,](#index_split_001.html_p59)

[1977),](#index_split_001.html_p59) simulated reality -- ontologically severed from those dimensions of existence that come about through an actual encounter with

the real -- also creates an alluring illusion that deceives us. When we

are so immersed in the virtual world, we can easily neglect our most

vital physical needs. We become trapped in a delusional and patho-

logical fiction, where the objects of the world are divested of their material density, and the tension necessary for the integrity of life collapses.

Insofar as the first stance assumes that the virtual inevitably deceives us into mistaking a copy for the real, that deception can begin

to take on a sinister quality as the world becomes flooded with simulations that we can no longer distinguish from the real. This theme

of the dystopian effects of simulated reality is portrayed in the *Black* *Mirror* episode "Be Right Back," which explores the possibility of virtually simulating our presence after we are dead.

The protagonist of this story, Martha, in attempting to overcome the

loss of her boyfriend, Ash, who has unexpectedly died, signs up for a

website that can virtually re-create her lost partner by extrapolating his

digital footprint from his past social media use. [1](#index_split_002.html_p108) This is achieved first with Ash's voice, and eventually, as she develops a closer relationship

to the digital version of Ash, with a clone of his body. On several oc-

casions we witness her gradual disappointment and frustration with

the clone's lack of spontaneity and inability to respond in a fully human way. At one point, when he fails to react to her emotional prodding she begins violently hitting him in frustration and mounting

rage, and then reproaches him for not responding to her violence by

hitting her back, as Ash would probably have done if he were alive. He

tells her that nothing in Ash's history, the history from which he has

been built, includes anything that would have him ever be violent to

[]{#index_split_001.html_p84} *Two stances on the virtual and the real* 65

her or could justify his reciprocal aggression. But if he were human, she

realizes, he would go beyond the bounds of his program.

Replacing a "real" object of the world with a virtual copy raises the

whole issue of what it means to substitute a spontaneously living object with a digitally replicated copy or clone. With the clone, Martha has someone who looks, talks, and acts exactly like Ash, but

someone with whom she is unable to make an affective connection;

in their intimate experience, she struggles with the haunting realiza-

tion that the cloned version of Ash lacks the essential vitality of her

living boyfriend. "It's like the old Marx brother's joke," [as Žižek (2003)](#index_split_002.html_p109)

writes, "where Groucho is seducing a typical dowager and says, 'Your

eyes, your nose, everything of you reminds me of you... everything

but yourself!'" (p. 94). And with this realization, Ash's clone becomes

monstrous for Martha and has to be hidden away in her attic for life.

The clone, as we would expect from the perspective of the first

stance, will always be inferior to the original. With virtual fireplaces,

for example, the experience of the actual fire is replaced by a representation that clearly caters to the more conceptual senses

(audiovisual images), but lacks the physical properties that make up

for the existential density that is left behind. Virtual pets, moreover,

allow for bonds of affection that are from the very beginning un-rooted, lacking real commitment and devoid of relational depth; the

on-line avatars through which we engage with others in virtual rea-

lity, also do away with the need to relate to their humanity.

A gardener most poignantly articulated this impoverishment. At the

apartment building where he worked, he immediately noticed that

the tree in the lobby that everyone had praised for its beauty, was in

fact artificial. For him, it looked, as he said, "tall, stupid, and dead,"

and he continued, "I live from my plants, they are my companions. I

wake up to them in the morning at home and then in every other folks' homes. I laugh with them, I talk to them, I cry with them. But it

makes me so sad when I realize that even though that thing they have

brought is a fake, they still want it here; that everyone is just indifferent, unwilling to put the time and care needed for real things."

Since any object today can be so flawlessly copied, we become de-

sensitized to the real, and so are tricked into believing that we are interacting with something real when in fact we are not, thus losing

something vital about the world of objects. Ash's (virtual) identity is

algorithmically constructed from past information. Its repertoire is limited to that which has been given to it, so, like a digital simulation,

it lacks all vitality. Martha's confining Ash to the attic represents a kind of melancholic withdrawal from the object. But that loss and increasing alienation from the life-world may also be registered unconsciously, resulting in a desperate psychic need to make contact

[]{#index_split_001.html_p85}66 *Evolving conceptions*

with the real by breaking through the simulations. That was the case,

according to [Frankel (2002)](#index_split_001.html_p58) in the violence of the school shooting at Columbine in 1991, which has become the horrific prototype of an

increasing number of school shootings in its wake.

When we interact with any kind of virtual clone, we frequently risk

becoming aesthetically and ethically numb to its fakeness: for ex-

ample, in the recordings of nature music that we listen to in order to

soothe ourselves in the middle of the frenzy of our contemporary

lives; or, in the electronic voices with which we, more and more fre-

quently, enter into simulated human conversations, habituating

ourselves to the hollowness of electronically simulated sounds with the muffled echo of the digital; or with the multiple new forms of artificial intelligence (Siri, Alexa, etc.) whose daily interactions begin

to blunt our perception and reaction to the living bodily human

presence. We become so used to interacting with a machine, per-

ceiving the world by means of it, that we begin to respond in the same

way with their human counterparts and so become blind to the dif-

ference. Sherry [Turkle (2012)](#index_split_001.html_p59) tells of a 16-year-old boy who uses texting for everything that once told her "... someday, someday, but

certainly not now, I would like to learn how to have a conversation

..." [(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t7Xr3AsBEK4).](https://www.youtube.com)

Perhaps we begin to lose our affective and bodily connection to the

world; it is little by little disappearing, becoming a thing of the past.

Some may call that simple nostalgia; others may want to recover what

is being forgotten. As we will see [in Chapter 8,](#index_split_005.html_p222) that loss brought about by the digital was already anticipated by those philosophers whose ontologies become useful for us now as we face the technological

advances of our era. For [Benjamin (1979),](#index_split_001.html_p58) for example, it was fore-shadowed in the loss of the mimetic faculty and the aura of objects;

for [Wittgenstein (1980),](#index_split_002.html_p109) in the disconnection in our materialistic, contemporary lives from what is most important to us; and for

[Heidegger (1977),](#index_split_001.html_p59) in the withdrawal of being that happens with technology.

Many areas of our collective life today have become infected by the

simulating effects of the virtual: politics, economics, sex, and war. We

are now agitated with the emergence of virtual politics, where the reality of the claims made rely no longer on factual truth but on fleeting reference to "virtual facts," the validity of which depends no

longer on their accuracy, but on the immediate impact they have. All

is momentarily up for grabs as there is no instant objectivity by which

to measure any one truth-claim. The dispensability of truth is emboldened because by the time we have it settled, the moment has

passed and the damage done. We see it too in economics, where brick-

and-mortar buildings, non-corporate town business centers, book-

stores, and so on are increasingly a casualty of e-commerce. The urban

[]{#index_split_001.html_p86} *Two stances on the virtual and the real* 67

world of concrete structures is de-realized by the virtual, so their ac-

tual location in space becomes irrelevant, and the physical interaction

between people that takes place in such spaces is neglected. Virtual sex

is another example where the actual encounter with a real other be-

comes secondary to its representation. Or take virtual wars, where in

striking targets with drones, the pilots are insulated from the risks and

dangers of combat, and in that distance, there is only indirect ac-countability for collateral damage. War becomes a virtual occurrence

on the screen wholly separate from the physical, lived reality of a soldier's life.

The virtual liberates us from our situatedness in time and space, which ordinarily serves as a constraint to fantasy and desire. What could not or did not happen in the real happens in the virtual. Take

the following case as an example: As we were writing this a few years

ago, in January 2016, the coldest day of the year thus far, in Harvard

square, in that miserable American Trump-Clinton political season,

Harvard students were being summoned by a loudspeaker, like in a

call to prayer, to come inside a "virtual reality booth" -- a huge tent set

up in the center of the public space of the square -- where one could go

and sit on a sunny beach, go sailing, high-diving, and the like, all of it

*virtually*! The real is cold and uninviting, so "come on in and have the virtual-real." It is of course merely a substitute, but if you really let yourself go and give yourself over to how good of a substitute it is, you

can create within yourself what used to be called a willing suspension

of disbelief. But here's the rub: Whereas previously from the willing

suspension of disbelief we entered into the potential space of art and

imagination, in virtual times, that willing suspension of disbelief becomes effectively a willing disavowal of reality and a deflation of experience.

One can always counter that those students are just taking a

break, that they know it's a cheap trick. Sure enough -- but if an increasing portion of social and political life today enacts this unconscious clarion call into the virtual as a response to the disenchantment with the world, our actual relation with the real, both

individually and collectively, is severely impoverished. For even if it

is our nature to wish for an impossible world, free from contingency

and restraint, the digital exacerbates that desire, and so also contributes to the disenchantment. It would seem that we enter the

virtual reality booth at the expense of real life, real sensation, real

memory, insulating the other fibers of perception that are in the body, always involved with an enrichment of experience. People are

now manifesting this loss, for example, in their newfound pre-

ference for vinyl over the digital register, "for the richness of music," as they put it. Or the experience we are having more frequently these days, that even when the resolution of the digital

[]{#index_split_001.html_p87}68 *Evolving conceptions*

image is ever sharper and more precise, it ends up that "realer than

real" becomes unreal. Instead of "watching" television we feel as if

we are on the "artificial" set itself.

That richness is what we lose, and we lose it not because it is no longer there, but because we have turned from reality without even

noticing and started to live in an artificial world that while comfor-

table and predictable and well under control (we think), involves the

forgetfulness and eventual disappearance of another register of ex-

perience. Rather than an evolution there may be a pauperization here

that should be avoided. Memory will not help, for when we become

sensorially habituated to the same perceptual range, we shall not ex-

perience the loss nor remember the difference in quality.

The mediation of digital technology ushers us into a new realm of

experience where a disconnection (perhaps even an amputation) from

the body becomes necessary. And this means that the empathic ele-

ment that grows in density and depth with the participation of the body diminishes in the flatness of the virtual screen, so that we forget

to actually listen to the undertones and nuances of words; or, unable

to hear them any longer, we become despondent, melancholic, lit-

erally haunted by the shallow emptiness of a virtualized world.

Digitization allows us to efface from everyday experience the opaque,

the unknown, the uncertain, the unformed; it involves, in other

words, a flight from the real. As simulation becomes the order of the

day, what used to be naturally, spontaneously implicit and acknowl-

edged now requires to be made explicit, as if vitality were being won

over by representation.

[***a Critique of the first stance: The alleged inherent***](#index_split_000.html_p11)

[***fakeness of the virtual***](#index_split_000.html_p11)

There are several implicit assumptions about the virtual behind the first stance that need to be examined. The virtual is seen as an inferior

copy of the real, so that when we succumb to it, we lose our ground,

and therefore our bodies, our senses, and our genuine experience of

the world. This denigration of the virtual creates a powerful di-

chotomy, a dramatic opposition, between the authentic real and the

artificial virtual. In positing such a drastic division, we become obsessed with authenticity. Prioritizing the original over the copy we end up adhering to a correspondence theory of re-presentation, where

"the virtual ... .must be \[...\] anchored in and \[...\] subservient to that

which it re-presents and or dis-places" [(Doel and Clarke, 1999,](#index_split_001.html_p58) p. 264).

Allowed to function on its own, the virtual automatically involves us

in disavowal. "In short, and for the sake of appearances and experi-

ences, the virtual may seem real and vice versa, but in their respective

essences, never the twain shall meet" (p. 263).

[]{#index_split_001.html_p88} *Two stances on the virtual and the real* 69

This conception of virtuality is Platonic in the traditional sense. It

so dichotomizes the virtual and the real that it ends up making the

real an immutable and essential form. The virtual tears us away from

our ground, and we lose our fundamental orientation toward reality.

Embodied, historical memory ceases, and our sensorial awareness

breaks down, throwing us into confusion. Encapsulated in the cocoon

of virtuality, we start living vegetative existences, where the sensu-ousness ( *aisthesis*) of the world becomes imperceptible to our anesthetized consciousness.

Contrary to the first stance, however, the digital clone or simulation

is not simply a degraded version of the real. We see this in "Be Right

Back" when Martha directs the clone to jump off the cliff and commit

suicide -- because his machinic limitations have made him repulsive to

her -- and he pretends to be scared of jumping, shedding simulated tears, evoking such a powerful emotional response from her that,

despite her initial impulse, she is unable to let him destroy himself and is forced to live with him forever, as a ghost in the attic. This is

also evident in the case of virtual pets. Even if their sounds, gestures

(and even tears) are algorithmically generated, they are still capable of

provoking empathy, as we know from the powerful emotional bonds

that children and the elderly develop in relation to them. It seems that indeed we can form "real" attachments to these digitally animated objects, which challenges the conception implicit in the first

stance that living creatures are necessary for the development of

authentic attachments.

To return to the issue of virtual wars, we had emphasized the video

game quality of making war, where the "operators--pilots as they are

called--sit behind computer terminals outfitted with joysticks, moni-

tors, interactive maps, and other cockpit gear, remotely controlling drones on the other side of the world" [(Rushkoff, 2013,](#index_split_001.html_p59) p. 120). Here was an image of the distancing effects of virtual simulations: The pilots are being shielded from the real-world consequences of their ac-

tions, as well as the ways in which the targets of the attacks became

dehumanized, and thus unreal, by their appearance on a digital

screen. But, in fact, as Rushkoff points out:

the levels of clinical distress in drone crews were as high, and sometimes even higher, than those of crews flying in real planes.

They were not desensitized video-game players wantonly drop-

ping ordinance on digital-screen pixels that may well have been

bugs. They were soul-searching, confused, guilt-ridden young

men, painfully aware of the lives they were taking. (p. 121)

This stirring example illustrates the limitations of the first stance, for

even though it picks up on real losses incurred by our digital life, in

[]{#index_split_001.html_p89}70 *Evolving conceptions*

assuming that the virtual is a degraded copy of the real, it misses the

power of the virtual to significantly impact one's relationship to reality.

The first stance conceives of the real as some kind of Platonic Idea

that stands above the everyday as a supra-reality, without shadow, and ever more vulnerable to the supposed tarnishing influence of the

virtual. We must then always be on guard against the virtual and its

seductions of degraded reality to protect and preserve the authenticity

of the real. Ironically, however, this hyper-idealization becomes even

more disconnected from the real than the virtual it had rejected. It seems, therefore, that we are engaged in a dance where the real and

the virtual switch places. The idealized, authentic real, floating above

the experience of everyday life, takes on the character of what we were

previously calling the virtual. And the virtual, that which was so powerfully guarded against, becomes the new real. Thus, when we

take the first stance to its limits, it dissolves into its opposite: an *enantiodromia*! This unexpected, and sudden reversal, where the virtual is now seen as more real than real, lands us in what we will explore

next as the second stance.

A great deal of the anti-technological literature, from Carr's *The*

*Shallows* [(2011)](#index_split_001.html_p58) to Turkle's *Reclaiming Conversation: The Power of* *Talk in a Digital Age*(2016), can be read, perhaps uncharitably, as

manifesting a kind of paranoid vision of the virtual intruding and

overtaking the real, where we must, at all costs, protect ourselves

from its seduction and protect our children from its encroach-

ment. There is a strong sense of nostalgia that underlies this first

stance, a yearning for a by-gone time, where experience was un-

mediated and untarnished, conversations and connections be-

tween people transparent and benevolent, a time when reality had

no trouble presenting itself to us in the full promise of what it was

and what it could become. Inevitably, for those of us who grew up

in a world without the digital, there is a yearning to recover those

aspects of life and experience that are degraded by our virtual life.

But the trap, of course, is our unconscious tendency to idealize the

past, and forget, that all of the same problems that we struggle with in a virtual world i.e., the superficiality of conversations, the

lack of presence we bring to relationships, how we objectify the

other, the rapacious desire for cheap entertainment, etc., were all

there before the digital, albeit in a different form and with a dif-

ferent rhythm. Stance one, in its unceasing disdain for the virtual,

can then become a way to hide and seek shelter from all that is changing. But as we will see, there are other considerations that need to be taken up if we are going to arrive at a more nuanced view of the matter.

[]{#index_split_001.html_p90} *Two stances on the virtual and the real* 71

[**2 Stance two: The virtual as an upgrade of the real**](#index_split_000.html_p11)

As a counterpoint to the first stance, our second stance conceives of

the virtual as an improvement over the deficiencies and imperfections

of the real. "The virtual is to the real as the perfect is to the imperfect,"

as [Doel and Clarke (1999)](#index_split_001.html_p58) put it.

Here, it is the real that is figured as partial, flawed, and lacking; whilst the virtual promises a rectification and final resolution to

come. \[...\] The virtual exudes wonderment by 'correcting' defects

in the real; by surpassing the constraints, inadequacies, and

limitations of the real -- particularly the drag of (real) space-

time. (p. 268)

[Guattari (1995)](#index_split_001.html_p59) points out that for Aristotle the goal of technology was to create what nature found it impossible to accomplish, thereby

rectifying what is flawed in the real. Overcoming lack and inadequacy,

virtuality substantiates a world of repletion and fullness. It offers, in

religious terms, redemption from a fallen world.

The ways in which our technologies seem to surpass the limits and

constraints fundamental to the everyday experience of space and time

explains the appeal of this second stance and the wonderment that it

inspires. With each technological advance, we are dazzled by the new

possibilities they provide for registering and sharing with each other

the passing moments of our lives. I place a GoPro Hero on my ski helmet, for example, and as I swoosh down the slopes on my snow-board, I can re-create, as never before, for anyone who wants to wit-

ness it, what it looks and feels like to actually be immersed in what

was once a wholly personal experience, now doubled and rendered

accessible to all.

Pre-digitally, we had all sorts of devices, each with a different function, to register the many dimensions that constitute lived experience: tape recorders for sound, cameras for images, and all sorts of

gadgets (TVs, VCRs, etc.), to play it all back to us. But with the digital

revolution, we don't have to wait for someone else to make the cap-

ture, we can make it ourselves, whenever we choose; and the same is

true of our music, which we can make and have whenever we want.

Moreover, we can have it all immediately, at the moment of its

happening. All pre-digital functions are now unified in a portable device that is always ready and at our disposal, exhilarating us with

the ever-present possibility of quickly and efficiently capturing the ephemeral everyday.

We can now playfully disassemble and reassemble the historical

sequence of life events into an intensely personal and idiomatic

bricolage. We can then experience, in communion with our friends

[]{#index_split_001.html_p91}72 *Evolving conceptions*

and family, our world as we have digitally woven it together. This digital extension fosters our artistry in creatively giving form to our

relationship to the temporality of events and provides us with a

freedom to shape and reshape experience, desire, and memory that

significantly transforms the way we operate. Our relation with others

is radically transformed; virtually connected, we are able to experi-

ence the depths of emotional intimacy, even without physical

proximity.

At the individual level, social networks provide a platform for an expression of emotional life that flows from the interior to the social

in a creative interchange between what has taken hold of our consciousness at any given moment, and the receptive subjectivity of our

intimates. Collectively, the ever-expanding circles of contact in the social web grant us access to larger aggregations of individuals with whom in the pre-digital past we would never have had any opportunity (or perhaps the desire) for real exchange. The virtual thus in-

[]{#index_split_002.html}

augurates new circumstances and contexts that transform the very

nature of friendships and love relationships.

Selfhood expands in the virtual. The immediacy of what is hap-

pening in the world arrives at its threshold, up close and personal, giving birth to new configurations of collective life. Social and

political happenings, ordinarily outside the range of everyday con-

sciousness, become transformed into events, lived out in the directness of individual experience. A strongly felt creative interchange takes place between what we are thinking and feeling with those on

the other end, who are perpetually in an active, responsive witnessing

role to what we are experiencing in the moment. Social networks

provide a platform for the expression of our emotional lives that freely

traverses the border between the interior intimacy of the self and the

exterior collective world.

Our devices become smaller and ever more precise as they mediate

our physical and psychological engagement with the world, offering

not just instantaneous access in words, images and sounds to the

events of the day, in real time, but also enriching and broadening the

palette of social and cultural experience. Our screens are filled with consciousness, meaning and affect, as they open us to the happening of

the world, in its immediate "now" moments. And all those "nows" -- all

those important and significant events, personal and collective -- are also instantly retrievable from the personal flux of our own temporality, which flows more intensely in our own creative digital

reconstruction, liberated from ordinary space and time.

We each carry today a personal, a collective, and a cultural mem-

orial archive, a remarkable library of human culture. Digitally, we not

only are able to hold on to nearly every event and experience that has

significantly impacted us, but also -- and unlike the photo album of

[]{#index_split_002.html_p92} *Two stances on the virtual and the real* 73

the past -- we are able to do so in a living, three-dimensional interactivity that creates endless, mind-boggling possibilities for con-

temporary thought, art, and experience. The power of the virtual to

overcome the constraints of physical space and the inexorability of time captures our imagination and persuades us of the unlimited

benefits of the digital.

[***a The virtualization of everyday life***](#index_split_000.html_p11)

The drive toward an increasing virtualization of everyday life that we

are experiencing today is behind the enhancement of reality that our

new technologies achieve. As [Lévy (1998)](#index_split_001.html_p59) so enthusiastically writes:

\[The virtual\] is a fecund and powerful mode of being that expands

the process of creation, opens up the future, injects a core

of meaning beneath the platitude of immediate physical presence.

(p. 16)

That "core of meaning," that universe-expanding virtual power,

eclipses the alleged importance of physical presence. The fecundity of

virtual interconnectivity not only overcomes the physical limitations

of sense perception, thus extending our knowledge of the world, but

also transforms and expands the world there is to know. As Noura Aleisa and Karen Renaud [(2017)](#index_split_001.html_p58) write of the virtual interconnectivity in "The Internet of Things":

a tool could measure heart rate and body temperature, and then

communicate with the energy management system to adjust

room temperature depending on the individual's physiological

status. Other tools activate smart streetlights, monitor surveillance

cameras and control traffic lights. Collected information can be

shared with different stakeholders to improve business intelli-

gence (p. 1)

Reality is augmented and transformed by technological devices into

this broad network of connections that produces ever-increasing

amounts of data and information. We can instantly acquire in-

formation about things and people absent to our sense experience, in

ways that extend, surpass, and even do away with our ordinary per-

ception. In his book *The Internet of Us,* [Lynch (2016)](#index_split_001.html_p59) imagines what that virtual realization might look like:

Imagine a society where smartphones are miniaturized and

hooked directly into a person's brain. With a single mental

command, those who have this technology -- let's call it

[]{#index_split_002.html_p93}74 *Evolving conceptions*

neuromedia -- can access information on any subject. Want to

know the capital of Bulgaria or the average flight velocity of a swallow? It's right there. Users of neuromedia can take pictures

with a literal blink of the eye, do complete calculations instantly,

and access, by thought alone, the contact information for anyone

they've ever met. (p. 3)

In the *Black Mirror* episode "The Entire History of You," a world is envisioned in which most people have a small chip implanted behind

their ear that records everything they do, see or hear. Memories can be

played back at will, either in the privacy of one's mind or on a screen,

in a process known as ["re-do."2](#index_split_002.html_p108) Want to know how that woman sitting to your left responded during the presentation you gave at work?

Re-do the scene you have digitally registered in your mind. Your an-

swer is right there. The limitations of human experiential memory are

gone. Everyone in society can possess inside their minds what was otherwise only registered outside it, making immediately accessible

what had to be externally accessed before. Our minds become nearly

omniscient and we acquire a new power of intelligence, with which

we can more easily grasp and control the complexities of the world.

And as the advances in Artificial Intelligence promise to better capture

the intrinsic properties of the biological substrate of intelligence --

especially with the adoption of the connectionist model, inspired by

neural networks -- we can expect a progressively more accurate si-

mulation of our intuitive and aesthetic capacities, over and above the

more abstract cognitive and symbolic thinking that it has already

potentiated, and so an even greater technological expansion of the human mind.

But the virtual not only enhances the powers of intelligence, it also

aids in the creation of a more perfect sense of self, as [Aleisa and](#index_split_001.html_p58)

[Renaud (2017)](#index_split_001.html_p58) also point out. The virtual amends what is lacking --

from the limitations of one's developmental history -- in the very structures that constitute the self. Freed of the inhibitions that plague

it in the real world, the self is broadened and expanded in virtual space. If I lack energy and motivation, or have a hard time sticking with something because of my low frustration tolerance, I may well

discover a new source of agency in the plentifulness of virtuality.

Think of the way children, for example, can more easily engage in musical creativity or train in a new language, once they can relate to it

digitally. The virtual offers compelling short-cuts to certain kinds of

experiences that I may have unsuccessfully sought to attain in my everyday world. This is certainly true in the realm of friendship and

romance, but also in learning and education, and in the buzz and excitement of on-line life that outstrips the ordinariness of quoti-dian life.

[]{#index_split_002.html_p94} *Two stances on the virtual and the real* 75

The approach to the virtual that evolves out of *stance two* professes a genuine faith that the digital revolution is ushering humanity to

somewhere and something better. In its triumph over the defects in

the real, digital virtuality is of unquestionably great benefit to us, making everyday life more interconnected, more comfortable and

pleasurable, and ultimately more meaningful. It is no surprise,

therefore, that from this positive regard for all the good the digital revolution brings, we are unafraid to allow it to continue to unfold unimpeded, without restraint (and perhaps almost cheering for it) till

the end.

[***b Critique of stance two: The virtual as an alleged***](#index_split_000.html_p11)

[***upgrade of the real***](#index_split_000.html_p11)

One cannot help but note that there is a triumphant note to stance

two. The world, in its digital dimension, becomes transparent to us as

a revitalized object of knowledge and experience. Its frustrating insufficiency, its obdurate muteness, is finally overcome. The digital gives us the power to make it speak. But the temerity of leaving the

actual for the virtual warrants further scrutiny.

For Plato, traditionally understood, the sensible world of everyday

experience is imperfect, a mere copy ( *simulacrum*) because the senses only provide us with imitations ( *simulacra*) of perfect, ideal forms. The first stance, as we remember, sees the virtual as a false copy of the real

in the same way that for Plato the sensible is a false copy of the Ideal

Forms. But the apotheosis of that position is when the ever more idealized real itself becomes perfect. And, just as the Platonic forms themselves are threatened by the sensible, this pristine reality is threatened by the debasing virtual.

So, whereas in the first stance, the virtual seduces us into thinking

that we are encountering the real (when we are actually caught up with a false and inferior copy), in the second stance, the drive to perfect what is lacking in the world, on the contrary, ends up overtaking the real and leaving it behind. This is precisely the critique advanced by Jean Baudrillard, who observed, that while modern societies organized around production, postmodern societies organize

around technological "simulations" (e.g., television, movies, and

computer screens). In our current moment, the acme of all techno-

logical simulations is the promise of the Internet of Everything to overlay upon the world a self-correcting digital upgrade.

Western culture up until modernity has conceived knowledge and

perception as a matter of representation, and relied primarily on

models of truth as correspondence. It is through the representational

capacity of the mind that knowledge is possible, and philosophy's

[]{#index_split_002.html_p95}76 *Evolving conceptions*

central concern has been to provide it a reliable foundation, and to

spell out criteria to discriminate those representations that did, and

those that did not, succeed in accurately rendering the world. The underlying dualism -- of a mind that knows and a world that is

known -- was articulated by both rationalists (Descartes, Leibniz,

Spinoza, et al.) and empiricists (Locke, Hume, Hobbes, et al.) in modernity. Contemporary philosophy may be understood in terms

of the rejection of this dualism. On the one hand, coherentist the-

ories of meaning in the Anglo-American philosophical tradition (as

in the pragmatism of James Dewey and William James, for instance),

conceive knowledge as a function of the coherence between beliefs

rather than any correspondence with reality. On the other hand,

post-structuralism in Continental philosophy (as Barthes, Lacan,

Derrida, Foucault, et al.), are also instances of this rejection of the representational model and its reliance on a correspondence theory

of truth.

In so radically breaking with the representational model, these

"postmodern" or contemporary positions go too far, according to

Baudrillard, for they call forth a world of unmoored signifiers, each referring to the other in an endless cascade of drifting and disrupted

meanings. Baudrillard understands our media-saturated, consumer

society as reflecting this epistemological crisis where we find ourselves

caught up in endless loops of images that have little connection to an

outside, external reality. Inside the virtual world, surrounded by mere

simulations, we become narcotically self-absorbed, and hypnotized,

by our absorption in the screen. The existential reality of embodiment

is severely disrupted (Baudrillard might say, wholly obliterated) in this

unending labyrinth of mirrors reflecting only mirrors. Thus, the ultimate price we pay for the virtual world is the disappearance of the

real, as the world itself becomes, in [Baudrillard's (1994)](#index_split_001.html_p58) poignant term, the "Desert of the Real."

Simulated reality empties out the world, forcing us to seek life, animation, and vitality by fleeing to the virtual. Entertainment, information, and communication technologies generate intensity and

immediacy, and thus overcome the dullness of everyday, ordinary

experience. And yet, this turn away from the world only increases our

desire for the real, for what we end up encountering in the virtual is

not the real, but its digital double, the hyperreal.

Baudrillard, in the 1980s, located the hyperreal in places like

Disneyland, malls and consumer havens, and TV sports and large-screen

blockbuster movies. For us, the situation is very different as hyperreality has taken on wholly new forms and is now all-pervasive. Today, even

our most sacred cultural spaces are turned into commercial simulacra, into Disney Worlds, that fuel the voyeuristic madness of tourism, for example. Living in the digital age, as opposed to the postmodern age

[]{#index_split_002.html_p96} *Two stances on the virtual and the real* 77

that Baudrillard was describing, provides instantaneous access to intensified experience, which seems to touch just about everything. This

overflowing well of hyperreality affects our sexuality, our politics, and just about every other aspect of human experience.

As we continue to develop our critique of the second stance, "hy-

perreality," "hyper-consumption," "hyper-connectedness," "simula-

tion," and "simulacrum" will serve us as orienting concepts to explore

the digital developments of the last decade, since the introduction of

the iPhone in 2007. In a world of iPhones and iPads and recording and tracking devices everywhere, as well as our everyday social interactions mediated by automated processes, Baudrillard's reflections

on the idea of hyperreality are more pertinent and familiar now than

when he wrote at the beginning of the digital revolution. Ironically,

he died the very year the iPhone was made publicly available.

It is our contention that even though Baudrillard's ideas were

clearly prophetic, digital culture has taken a whole new and un-

predictable turn since he first wrote about it in the 1980s. The use of

technology as an upgrade of reality -- correcting its defects, overcoming its gaps and voids -- has taken on an unprecedented force in

the digital era. It has become part of the very fabric of our experience,

which has resulted in a near total embrace of the hyperreal. The porousness of everyday life, its existential complexity, is substituted with an experience that feels more real than real, and bestows upon

the events of our lives a quality of fullness and presence. But that filling in, that overflowing of meaning and experiential immediacy

that is granted by digital hyperreality, casts its own shadow. The ex-

hilaration of hyperreality fizzes out, becoming a one-dimensional,

monotone sameness. Too much of everything turns into nothing. The

world is stripped of its animation and vitality, life is flattened out and

divested of meaning. In other words, hyperreality, as we will explore,

partakes of the logic of the digital pharmakon. So, although inspired

and forever indebted to Baudrillard's thinking, we will at the same time attempt to freely encounter the hyperreality of our own era as opposed to his.

[**3 A contemporary phenomenology of digital**](#index_split_000.html_p11)

[**hyperreality**](#index_split_000.html_p11)

What we intend to do in what follows is less to go beyond a critique of

the second stance and more a reflection of the present state of our hyperrealized society. It is no longer a speculation with regard to the

value of the virtual, but a meditation on what it actually means to be

now traversed by the virtual everywhere. In the end we will be able to

recognize the pharmakon, which advances us to consider the nature

of the virtual, rather than to arrive at a third "position."

[]{#index_split_002.html_p97}78 *Evolving conceptions*

We are living in a period of history when the hyperreality of the digital virtual thoroughly permeates the institutional, cultural, and psychological structures through which we apprehend the world.

Given the rapidity of these transformations, we lack adequate con-

cepts to understand, as well as metabolize, the effects hyperreality is

having on our experience of the world, and our relation to ourselves

and others. In the following passage, [Giegerich (2007)](#index_split_001.html_p58) describes what it feels like today to be living with these changes.

Surfing \[the net\] goes along with thrill. Thrill is that state in which

the individual is absolutely in the Now. Here we have to come

back to \[...\] the indispensability today of the stimulation of the

emotions and the importance of the sensual impression some-

thing makes on people over against what it is that makes the

impression. \[...\] It is the intensity of the impression or affect that

really counts \[...\] The sheer affective intensity creates a Here!,

Now!, This!, and I. Absolute immediacy is the goal. (p. 327)

This intensification of experience that Giegerich calls "absolute immediacy" transforms reality into hyperreality; "hyper," as in having a

lot or even too much of something, in this case, reality. The digital speeds up and dynamizes its analogical counterpart and brings a

heightened, electric feeling that enlivens experience. The faster they

speed up and speed by, the more real and alive things feel. And when

things move that fast, time can be suspended altogether, allowing its

movement without the loss it implacably exacts in the real. By gen-

erating a subjectively intensified, ongoing register of the movement of

our own experience in time, our devices enable us to escape the costs

of human temporality. The hyperreality effect!

It's not only that we can now stop the very thing that resists any

stopping, namely the movement of time. We stop it *in real time*, as historical time is set in the background. Think again of the use of instant replay in sports, where we place before us a past moment and

make it a center of attention in the midst of flowing time. We sense

the growing tension between the real happening of the game that

continues to progress and our fixation on the frozen moment.

With this newfound capacity to bracket a moment of real time,

temporal movement is suspended, and we find ourselves in a new

(virtual) space of collective experience that disarticulates the coordinates of analogical spatio-temporality and complexifies our con-

ception of what is real. Whereas traditional film memorializes our historical and collective life, the cyber-register hyperrealizes and personalizes it. The digital register of experience gives each one of us control over the archiving process of our own life. What we register is

inherently autobiographical -- it is ultimately about what is happening

[]{#index_split_002.html_p98} *Two stances on the virtual and the real* 79

and what has happened to me: "Here!, Now!, This! and I." Memoir, a

more subjectivized version of the classical autobiography, has become

the dominant literary modality of our time.

As time, truth, and meaning become hyperrealized, a vertiginous

buzz permeates our experience of being in the world, our ethics, and

our politics. We now live in an era where we can no longer distinguish

the real from the copy, fact from fiction, objectivity from subjectivity.

In our global, interconnected lives we don't have just digital presidents, but hyperreal ones. The far-left French presidential candidate,

Jean-Luc Mélenchon, for instance, appeared in 2017 at seven rallies simultaneously, thanks to the wonders of hologram technology. Is it

worth asking anymore for the real Mélenchon to stand up?

[***a The hyperrealization of meaning: Limits, addiction,***](#index_split_000.html_p11)

[***and the incapacity to metabolize experience***](#index_split_000.html_p11)

We are flooded today by an unstoppable torrent of unruly and world-

shattering forces that burst forth from the digital, undoing the balance and rhythm that structured the analogical world. As we try to digest the personal and cultural events that relentlessly swirl around

us, our very capacity for making sense of what is happening, both personally inside and socially, is being hyperactivated. This is evidenced in our dramatic obsession with the present moment. As

[Rushkoff (2013)](#index_split_001.html_p59) observes:

Everything is live, real time, and always-on. It is not a mere

speeding up, however much our lifestyles and technologies have

accelerated the rate at which we attempt to do things. It's more of

a diminishment of anything that isn't happening right now -- and

the onslaught of everything that supposedly is ... It's \[...\] why

email is giving way to texting, and why blogs are being superseded

by twitter feeds. It's why kids in school can no longer follow linear

arguments; why narrative structures collapsed into reality TV; \[...\]

If the end of the twentieth century can be characterized by

futurism, the twenty-first can be defined by presentism. (pp. 2--3)

Rushkoff's notion of presentism captures that sense of unceasing at-

tunement to the immediate moment where events are presented si-

multaneous to their actual occurrence. In this regard, we remember being struck when first hearing about -- what has now become a very

common phenomenon -- the particular ways in which a young man

was staying in touch on his smartphone with the events of his girl-

friend's life, while she was away at school in another city for a se-mester. Whatever she was doing -- going to a party, studying for an

exam, watching a documentary, hiking with a friend, eating, taking a

[]{#index_split_002.html_p99}80 *Evolving conceptions*

shower, etc. -- was posted in video form on her Instagram story feed so

that this young man, watching from his digital perch, was able to immerse himself in the present happenings of her daily life. He was

there as witness, even if not as a direct participant, commenting in

"real time" despite the asymmetry of their electronic interaction as well as the thousand-mile span that separated them. Given the immediacy of his virtual presence, he was able to outmaneuver the

feelings of sadness he had for her leaving, his lonesomeness, their not

"really" being together.

In our hyper-connected world, the other is unceasingly present,

always available, perhaps even more available than when they are in

the same physical space. That constant availability of the object

clearly affects our relation to separation and separateness, being alone

as opposed to being alone with the virtual other.

The present moment, always being on, everything always available

and within our reach, creates an ever-churning river of meaning. In

our unceasing engagement with the personal, political, and cultural

events of the day, as they appear on our phones, and computers, in

text, or video form, we experience the overflowing of that perpetual

scroll. An infinite realm of possibility opens to us -- every book ever

written, every song ever recorded, every fetish ever imagined -- all in

standing reserve, ready to be actualized. This sense of unending digital

potential inspires a feeling of boundlessness that taps into the primordial roots of our earliest omnipotence, when our most ardent

wishes and their actualization were one. This spawns the digital fever

of contemporary life.

The wishing self, in front of the screen, has free rein over the rea-

lization of its fantasies without delay. It is no longer a matter of simply viewing a movie, seeing a play or watching a television show, where

the beginning, middle, and end occur in a time-bounded frame of

predictable duration. That framing of experience is a feature of the sequential temporality of the analog world that stands in marked

contrast to the haphazardness and freedom that is possible in the digital (where there are no temporal constraints). One can now watch

multiple episodes of a series, or movie after movie, in rapid succession,

allowing oneself to be carried away by the hyperrealized narrative world that comes alive on the screen. ["Binge-watching"3](#index_split_002.html_p108) is that fully immersive experience that feels like it never has to end, as the dull routine of everydayness and its slower, more methodical and exacting

rhythms of time are displaced. When we are finally ready to stop the

story -- say, after watching the entire season of a show in one sitting --

we are surprised, even shocked, by how much actual time has passed.

But you can also see different episodes simultaneously, or skip

through them to only the parts that interest you. In this world, beginning, middle and end make no demand upon us. Surfing, gaming,

[]{#index_split_002.html_p100} *Two stances on the virtual and the real* 81

and Internet pornography are all examples of activities in which di-

gital selves exist in a span of time that readily dissociates from the rhythms of the body and its historical time. [Rushkoff's (2013)](#index_split_001.html_p59) "presentism" is a hyperreality effect of the digital, that fundamentally changes our relationship to those aspects of reality that occur with a

different temporal pacing, for example, things that move slower and

require patience, the fact that something ends, or that something has

a definitive beginning, and the sense of a pause or break between them, and so on.

If in our delineation of the second stance we emphasized the

wonderment and creative potential of this immediate access -- for

instance, the ability to connect virtually to a distant friend, somewhere on the other side of the globe -- here we must consider what hyperreality may be doing to ordinary, everyday, localized experience.

Is it creating an undue dependence on a certain intensity of meaning,

without which things begin to lose their sharpness and focus and fade

from our mind? Bursts of reinforcing dopamine aside, is that why we

can't stop ourselves from looking down at our phones? And does it not lessen our interest, blur our vision of things, when we check our

timelines, messages, and texts, no matter where we are or what else we

may be doing? Are we then not less able to bear the experience of emptiness or indeterminateness in the everyday? These seem like legitimate yet very uncomfortable questions to raise in a hyperrealized

world.

[*i Digital addiction*](#index_split_000.html_p11)

Hyperreality covers up the lack inherent to the real (i.e., the fissures

and disjunctions in experience) with the infinite potential for anything to become animated at any moment in time. And we, in turn,

are unconsciously driven to fill in the moments of absence, loss, and

the passing away of things that haunt the everyday with the un-

ceasing plenitude of virtual presence. This is most clearly evident in

the panic that sets in when someone loses their phone, for instance,

or the gaming system of an adolescent is precipitously taken away by

their parents. It is symptomatic of an impending dread of the gray dullness of life. Or, in Freud's hands, it is the return of the repressed,

now as the ever-present lack in the real.

Emotional experience, of all stripes and varieties, often contains a

painful dimension. According to [Bion (1983),](#index_split_001.html_p58) a crucial part of human development involves the capacity to bear psychic pain, and in fact,

its development is essential for the growth of the self. This idea that

there is psychic work to be done with one's painful emotional experiences is expressive of the unyielding realities of a person's existential situatedness: what has vanished and must be mourned, the

[]{#index_split_002.html_p101}82 *Evolving conceptions*

inevitability of suffering, both bodily and psychically, and, of course,

one's inescapable attunement to loss and finitude.

But in a hyperrealized culture that so well shields us from these gaps

and indeterminacies, we may no longer be able to learn how to me-

tabolize the kind of psychic pain that is an essential part of how we

process our emotional lives. Or, in other words, if we cannot find a

way to bear the ever-present lack inherent to the real, what the phi-

losopher Charles [Scott (1999)](#index_split_001.html_p59) calls "time's losses," a good deal of our psychic resources then have to be devoted to holding that lack at bay.

The ego, with its own particular set of needs and desires, is now armed

with a potent meaning-creating device that can overcome the void of

life's emptier moments by situating the self in something much more

immediately compelling. The tedium of the world, which can, para-

doxically, generate its own harvest of creativity and spontaneity, is mindlessly dismissed.

Because every event can be experienced, and re-experienced in its

now-moment, digital addiction becomes, in essence, an addiction to this

permanently available and ever-emerging immediacy. Hyperreality, this

heightened enhancement of experience, is the drug that feeds our digital

addiction. It is what underlies the craving for more, whether it be through pornography, gaming, shopping, or the compulsive search for

facts and knowledge. And in our need for the hyperreal, just like with

any addiction, the everyday world of non-hyperrealized reality becomes

increasingly empty, tedious, and often unbearable.

The digital media tries to compensate for this growing gap by

making the simulations themselves feel ever more intensely personal

and engaging. The more hyperreal our simulations become, the less

they are connected to the real. The less we are connected to the real,

the less we can resist the urge to turn, ever more frenetically, toward

hyperreality to compensate for this lack. This is its addictive circle, and brings us back to the undecidable logic of the pharmakon where

"the needed remedy is also the poison that generates the need"

[(Russell, 2020,](#index_split_001.html_p59) p. 105).

Given the power of digital simulations to so accurately mimic

reality, we become entangled in a confounding maze where it can

never be "real" enough, because the yearning for more "realness" is

created by the fact that it is not real at all. We are seduced into be-

lieving that if we can just keep more of our life and our mind immersed in them, we can finally find full satisfaction in our

simulations. Madness, as Einstein said, is doing the same thing while

expecting a different outcome. Since it's the nature of a wish to clash

with what is actually possible, a gap opens between what is there for

us in the virtual world and what is not in the real. Because this gap

remains unconscious, we are forever prodded to return to the virtual

to overcome it. But because it is impossible to reach what we are

[]{#index_split_002.html_p102} *Two stances on the virtual and the real* 83

seeking there and yet we are convinced we can, our virtual life is sustained by a dire illusion.

[*ii Loss of quality*](#index_split_000.html_p11)

Hyperreality seduces us with its profligate offerings, and in the rush of

the addiction, it is no longer what it offers, but *that* it offers which matters; just as Don Juan, in his unsatisfiable desire for conquest, no

longer cares about the particularities of the woman who comes next,

but just that it is another one. Quality yields to quantity, and the excessive need to measure displaces everything else, even desire, thus

becoming an undeniable symptom of the digital age. As a result, ob-

session and compulsion overtake us, and reality is spurned for the thrill and satisfaction of quantification. A walk in the park, for instance, is no longer a walk in the park but 3372 additional steps to add

to the 2678 already taken, in the quest for a daily total sum, with the

euphoria of its completion. And if we think back on the experience of

the primitive artist that painted the animal images in ancient caves, as

[McBurney (2011)](#index_split_001.html_p59) says, what truly separates us from them is "not the space of time but the sense of time. In our minute splicing of our lives

into milliseconds, we live separated from everything that surrounds us" ( *The Guardian*, March 17, 2011).

We are no longer connected to our bodies through the sensual

resonances of the inner, but through the external measurements of

our gadgets. When we put in our AirPods to silence the external

world, we cut ourselves off as well from the internal. When we wear

them on a jog, and immerse ourselves in music, it becomes more

difficult to listen to the signals emanating from within. The breath,

which normally marks our step, is muted. Oblivious to our rhythm

and endurance, we fail to mark an even step or run at a good pace.

And if to AirPods we add Fitbits, Apple Watches, or any other

wearable, we track our workouts but are estranged from the lived

experience in our flesh, numbed to everything inside and outside us.

Obsessed with our digital attunement, we can't stop looking, we

can't stop checking, and the entire experience of the jog is narrowed

to the appearance of small numbers on our screen, and the tracking

of our progress, where we compare today's run to yesterday's and

anticipate tomorrow's.

If behind all digital addictions there is a hidden desire for omnipotence and control, then we may be exacerbating our all-too-human

disavowal of the unpredictability of bodily life by making its processes

something that needs close monitoring and supervision. All that

quantitative scrutiny of our frail, contingent bodies (and remember,

our wearables are now with us even while we are sleeping, measuring

our heart, our pulse and our REM cycles) makes us obsessively

[]{#index_split_002.html_p103}84 *Evolving conceptions*

hypervigilant about what is going in and what is coming out. Our oral

and anal predispositions to the world are over-stimulated by the

digital.

Like any addictive substance or behavior, the shot of hyperreality --

whether it takes the form of closely inspecting what is happening inside our bodies or giving ourselves over to the intensified experience

of reality that happens when we enter a virtual world -- can never truly

give us what we actually want or, perhaps more importantly, need.

Hyperreality and its addictive circle jettisons us back to the assump-

tions of the first stance, where the simulation is always inferior to the

real. But, in a further twist to the problem, because our simulations

have become so "real," they feed our unconscious yearning to possess

and ultimately domesticate reality. Instead, however, we must learn to

accept the uncalculable dimensions of bodily experience and tolerate

and bear its psychic demands. To recover from digital addiction is therefore to recover the real.

[*iii The narcissistic excesses of hyperreality*](#index_split_000.html_p11)

As Ian [McEwan (2016)](#index_split_001.html_p59) points out:

We are now just past the sort of toddlerhood of the digital age.

Millennials certainly take it for granted that we live in a new era,

mostly of self-expression, but not so much of listening. We are not

Hamlet so much these days. We are broadcasters of the Self.

Selfhood is extremely important of course, who can deny it. But

when you make the self the outer limit of your politics, you then

begin to ignore a great deal of the attitudes, situations, dilemmas,

misery of others. \[...\] Listening, that is abandoning the self, and

abandoning yourself to another's point of view is what the

Internet has not given us. It has given us trolls, it has given us tsunamis of opinion, but not listening. Perhaps it will take a bend

in the future that we cannot yet foresee.

The self is innately vulnerable to narcissistic inflation, grandiosity, and its own aggrandizement, and the digital capitalizes upon this

primordial predisposition. If, in the inner recesses of the psyche, the

self is as radically unfixed as depth psychology asserts, narcissism functions as a strong compensatory impulse to oppose that flux by firming it up, countering its indeterminateness through strong identifications. The growth of the individual is a dialectical process between the creation of narcissistic structures that fortify the self by keeping out what is not-me and yet at the same time are permeable

and flexible enough to make transformative use of what is other.

[]{#index_split_002.html_p104} *Two stances on the virtual and the real* 85

Neither overly sealed and buttoned up nor too permeable and open,

the goal is to stream the self with just enough narcissistic libido that it can hold in some kind of workable tension the inevitable clash between the me and not-me worlds.

From the perspective of our critique of stance two, the digital milieu

has the power to wreak havoc on that uneasy tension, generating

pathological forms of narcissism that shut down access to otherness.

As McEwan points out, by its ceaseless broadcasting of who it is, what

it believes and how it desires, the digital self may hamper the possi-

bility of a certain mode of self-abandonment necessary to empathi-

cally enter into another's point of view. An important effect of the narcissistic inflation of hyperreality is that the Internet becomes an algorithmically defined echo-chamber ("filter-bubbles" as they are

called) relaying information that only reinforces our own views,

hemming us in and making us oblivious to the other. The self has little resistance against this plunge into its personalized digital space

of resonance. There is nothing more involving and gratifying than

having our own sense of the world, our proclivities and idiosyncrasies,

expanded and amplified.

The ultimate aim of this narcissistic expansion is the immortality of

the self. The urgent need in our species to rescue it from its temporal

impermanence, to outstrip our human limitations, is exacerbated by

technology's promise of overcoming death. As [O'Gorman (2015)](#index_split_001.html_p59)

points out:

This promise comes in many shapes and forms, from medical

technologies designed to extend life, to artificial intelligence

research that seeks to transfer human consciousness into ma-

chines, to highly immersive video games and the identity-

morphing spaces of the Internet. This false promise of immortality

is facilitated largely by our technologically mediated ability to

vanquish space and time, to reproduce and extend ourselves

electronically through transmission and storage. (p. 9)

Indeed, the self's desire for enhancement and expansion spurs on the

growth of technology and the digital magnifies this essential impulse.

Conversely, technological extensions promote the self by constantly

making its life easily accessible in images. As we scroll through our digital files, it is the snapshots of the self that we cannot stop looking

at. They are the undeniable proof of our existence, a bulwark against

the thrust of time and its movement. In this regard, consider the selfie

phenomenon: Inversely to how Dorian Gray's hidden painting por-

trayed his true self, ravished by the degenerative effects of time and

social debauchery, our public selfies preserve an unchanging, static, posed, and well-fashioned self.

[]{#index_split_002.html_p105}86 *Evolving conceptions*

As we go through the day, with all of its many tasks, the digital makes it possible for us to permanently register everything that we do,

thus offering the self a kind of immortality. By overcoming its geographical limitations and facilitating its expressiveness, the presence

of the self is augmented and expanded. Each person can then indeed

become a broadcaster of herself, the events of her life, the people and

places she encounters, the food she eats, even her most private mo-

ments, delivering a veritable personal daily to all of the world. The ordinary narcissistic strivings to be liked, to have friends, to be known, are transformed into an insatiable demand for thousands of

friends on Facebook or followers in Twitter and Instagram, constant

gratification through likes and comments, and the permanent atten-

tion from the inexhaustible audience in the web. The virtual exalta-

tion of the human desire for closeness and connection turns a basic

psychological need into an unquenchable desire.

In the virtual world, the "I" is propelled into the center of action.

The digital capture of an event that fixes it outside of time inevitably

inflates the self's importance, and turns it into an idol. This individual

narcissism becomes a cultural titanism that demands everyone to

behold and bear witness to a psychologically intensified and overly libidinized self that knows no bounds. Digital narcissism is of an entirely different order than anything that has ever occurred.

The self's narcissism is hyperrealized by the voyeuristic desire of its

virtual audience (i.e., nearly all of us), engaged as we are with digital

culture. It is of little importance whether our voyeurism results from

admiration or denigration, for it is driven by impact, not substance.

Winnicott famously said of the developmental process that there is no

such thing as a baby, only a baby and its mother. We could say of our

current social predicament that there is no such thing as the self, only

the self and its digital feed.

That desire for permanence has spread beyond our representations

of the self to infect also our relation to the objects we encounter every day. When at the museum, for instance, surrounded by works

of art, we are now often overtaken by an urge to capture the objects

and the moment, so as to make them available whenever, even if we

never look at the photographs again. A substitute mind lives in our

devices, a proxy memory, an ever-expanding archive of the self and

its objects, furthering its expanse and reach. Once the event is cap-

tured, the shot snapped, we can rest easy and maybe, if only for an

instant, actually look at what stands before us, before we repeat the

same vicious cycle. The power the digital grants us to outwit impermanence transforms the way we are actually living. The art and

cunning genius of digitality lies in its effectively responding to our

panic about the ephemerality of the moment; it serves as a shield against change and becoming.

[]{#index_split_002.html_p106} *Two stances on the virtual and the real* 87

[***b Digitally induced death anxiety***](#index_split_000.html_p11)

The compulsion to turn to the virtual world to escape the ravages of

time intensifies as everyday reality becomes an increasing object of technological control. No moment is lost anymore because we can

bring it back, instantly. Unlimited and infallible memory now exist alongside a permanent and eternal archive of the past. We experience

a sense of omnipotence and grandeur, as uncertainty and unpredict-

ability are all but vanquished. The conviction that we are able to so

effectively ward off dispossession and disappearance feeds the feeling

that ultimately we have the same power against our mortal condition.

These pocket-sized disavowing devices can endlessly forestall the

inevitable, promising us a refuge from death. Yet, at the same time, in

a peculiar kind of rebounding effect -- a return of the repressed, as it

were -- that which we so desperately want to vanquish finds its way

back. A key feature of digital life entails this unceasing and unstoppable oscillation, this haunted relationship to mortality, as we are

drawn closer to it at the very same time that we drive it away.

We use our phones and computers and tracking devices to stay in

touch with those we care for, bolstering the illusion that if we can just

keep an eye on them, nothing bad can happen. And indeed, the in-

vention of the smartphone has actually, to a certain extent, made that

possible. If someone is endangered, we will know, and know fast. And

maybe we can help them. Many emergencies have been averted be-

cause we have our phone and nearly instant access to the other, no

matter where they may be. As a result of this intricate network of connections, many lives have been saved. Given this incredible power

to always know in an instant, where someone is -- and even, if in tracking and surveillance mode, what they are doing -- it's not a far

stretch to see how we become convinced that as long as the other is

connected to me through their phone, no true ill is to befall them.

The unconscious fantasy that so pervades digital life is that we

somehow insure, with this constant monitoring, that our loved ones

will be safe.

The terrible irony is that in safeguarding ourselves against loss, dis-

possession, and ultimately death, we are also unconsciously enacting a

perverse and stultifying relationship to mortality. Our phones, at any

moment, day or night, are on the ready to alert us to the injury or disappearance of someone dear to us, someone we love and care for.

This contributes to the feeling today of a persistent underlying death

anxiety, as our worry about the other -- we haven't yet heard from them, are they OK? did they get to where they were going? -- only intensifies. We compulsively turn to our phone for reassurance even

though, paradoxically, we know deep down it could also be the potential bearer of bad news. This relationship becomes our modern era's

[]{#index_split_002.html_p107}88 *Evolving conceptions*

*amor fati*. Drop it, break it, lose it, and you are cut off from fate. This explains why our devices can take on more importance than our

friends, lovers, and family. This dynamic underlies an existentially rooted fetishism that keeps us desperately tied to them in a simultaneous avowal and disavowal of death. We monitor, we wait, we worry.

[**Coda: A brief reflection on the interrelation**](#index_split_000.html_p11)

[**between the two stances**](#index_split_000.html_p11)

In the first stance, the virtual is fake trickery, seducing us into believing that we are experiencing the real when we are merely experi-

encing the falseness of virtual simulation that is distinct from and degrades the real. In eschewing the virtual, what is sought from the

perspective of the first stance is the reality of unmediated pure presence that can only be found in the real. It is only by staying with the

non-virtual darkness and opaqueness of experience that the real can

be encountered.

The reality of unmediated pure presence that is being sought in the

first stance is, ironically enough, exactly what is being sought in the

second stance. But whereas the first stance achieves it by separating

the virtual from the real in order to save the real, the second stance

seeks that same unmediated presence in the virtual, which is set apart

from the time/space drag of the real. It is in the pure presence of the

virtual that the world is repaired.

For the anti-technologists of the first stance, we enter pure presence

in the realness of the world, where its material limits awaken us to our

embodiment and our mortality beyond the virtual. For the pro-

technologists of the second stance, however, the ontological mal-

adjustments of the real are fixed by the virtual copy. Instead of degrading the real, the virtual creates another, perfected world, where we transcend the restrictions of material life. There is an uncanny surprise, then, as we think about the interrelationship between our two stances. Those who are committed to creating a virtual upgrade of

the real are claiming for themselves the very same territory that the

anti-technologists claim to have found outside or beyond or before the virtual. But both are committed to the One-All of unmediated

presence -- an essential reality in its own right.

Each stance, in its own way, attempts to split off a dimension of

the world in seeking out its conception of this unmediated reality.

Pure presence in the first stance has no traces of the virtual and pure

presence in the second stance has no traces of the real. The anti-technologists' commitment to unmediated presence, as that which

lies beyond the virtual, and the pro-technologists' contention that we can only reach pure presence by creating a perfect double,

ironically articulate the same suspicious utopian vision of reality.

[]{#index_split_002.html_p108} *Two stances on the virtual and the real* 89

Indeed we may conclude that the problem with these stances, as

compelling as each one is, is not what they hold but the pre-

supposition that they stand on opposite sides. In other words, the problem is having to choose. There is not one or the other bank that

we need to take, but the river itself, to which we now turn.

**Notes**

[1](#index_split_001.html_p83) There is a feature in Facebook called "legacy contacts" that allows you to nominate an executor of your personal page, responsible for keeping it active after your death, as a virtual tombstone for your social network. The appointed can choose photos of yours to greet visitors, write messages on

your behalf and even select the friends who can view your memorial page.

Eter9 is an actual website that further develops this idea of virtual survival.

Brooker merely takes this fantasy one step further into the digital reconstruction of the person.

[3](#index_split_002.html_p99) It is now widely known that there are certain formulas that content pro-ducers like Netflix use to make their series "binge-worthy," ways of manipulating the telling of the story (e.g., hooking the viewers by ending early episodes with cliff-hangers), or concentrating in the marketing of the show, say, for example, on four central characters, two evil, two good, to keep the story simple and keep a viewer watching. Media critics speak of this as a reduction in how we now tell stories.

[]{#index_split_002.html_p110}[**4 The inexorable flow**](#index_split_000.html_p11)

At the still point of the turning world. Neither flesh nor fleshless;

Neither from nor towards; at the still point, there the dance is,

But neither arrest nor movement. And do not call it fixity,

Where past and future are gathered. Neither movement from nor

towards,

Neither ascent nor decline. Except for the point, the still point,

There would be no dance, and there is only the dance.

--TS Eliot, Burnt Norton, Four Quartets (1980)

[**Prelude**](#index_split_000.html_p11)

We want to advance in this chapter a third interpretation of the vir-

tual, but it would be a misnomer if we called it "a third stance." It could imply that we have arrived at the synthesis -- an overcoming, a

sublation, a Hegelian *Überhebung* -- of the previous two stances. But this third reading of the virtual does not synthesize; instead, it re-pudiates the dynamics of polarization that the first two stances enact,

and battles against the utopianism that underwrites them.

As we advance this new position, we will draw heavily [from Deleuze](#index_split_002.html_p126)

[(1994),](#index_split_002.html_p126) who proposes we consider the virtual as opposed, not to the real as we usually do, but to the "actual." In his famous words, "the

virtual is fully real in so far as it is virtual" and "the virtual \[is\] '\[r\]eal without being actual ...'" (p. 208). In the previous chapter the real and

the virtual were seen dualistically as "immutable and inalienable

forms" [(Doel and Clarke, 1999,](#index_split_002.html_p126) p. 270), each separate and protected from the "degrading" effects of the other. Here, however, the virtual

and the real are in a constant inter-flowing. No dualism is operative.

And so this new reading of the virtual dislocates the previous two stances, for neither real nor virtual is more originary or more authentic; they don't compete or threaten one another. Here, real and

virtual amalgamate in the Heraclitean embrace of Becoming.

The virtual does not reside outside of the real but dwells at its very

heart. For example, fantasy and imagination are virtual dimensions of

[]{#index_split_002.html_p111}92 *Evolving conceptions*

the mind that although not actual name something real in our

experience. "Real" therefore is not only the actual but at the same time the virtual. The real is no longer synonymous with the actual, and the virtual is not opposed to the real.

Splitting what is virtually there from what is actually there, to declare that only what is actual is real, evidences a desire to sediment

the real; it amounts to a resistance to change. For if the virtual informs

the real even before it is actualized, if there is no originary model that

the virtual copies (whether distorting or improving it), then everything is potentially changing all the time; the virtual inseminates and

is inseminated by the actual.

Deleuze describes traditional Platonic philosophy as "the dogmatic

image of thought" because of its *rigor mortis*, its resistance to all change; in taking all thinking to be representation and not leaving any room

for other modes of thought, Plato's conception of thinking is

excessively constraining. It thus subordinates mutable sensible experi-

ence to an immutable and transcendent (intelligible) reality. So Deleuze

envisions instead, an ontology of movement and continuous trans-

formation, where reality is an inexorable flow of virtual and actual that

opens room for the acknowledgement of temporal movement and

change. Deleuze's ontology is not wedded to permanence and

immutability, but is committed to the quickening of becoming.

Heraclitus unhorses Parmenides.

Once we free ourselves from the dichotomy of real and virtual, it becomes obvious -- as was implicit in our discussion on the emergence

of the virtual in [Chapters 1](#index_split_000.html_p40) and [2](#index_split_001.html_p60) -- that the virtual is an essential dimension of *all* human experience. We mistakenly think that with

the advent of Virtual Reality, the virtual is for the first time transforming the way we live and perceive the world; that thanks to our

technological advances, we are now finally in full control of the virtual. But digital technology simply provides us new ways of engaging or modulating the virtual; and as today we are tempted to

identify the virtual with its specific digital instantiation, we need to

explore virtuality's embeddedness in the real.

[**1 The Deleuzian simulacrum**](#index_split_000.html_p11)

Whereas the Platonic simulacrum (or simulation) is always con-

ceived as a mere copy of an original, the Deleuzian simulacrum

rejects the assumption of a stable immutable original that is

opposed to the copy. By rejecting the implicit dualism involved in

that conception, the simulacrum is freed from the demand for

sameness and identity and welcomes instead the acknowledgment

of difference and change. It moves us beyond the polarity of real

[]{#index_split_002.html_p112} *The inexorable flow* 93

vs. copy. As [Doel and Clarke (1999)](#index_split_002.html_p126) put it, the Deleuzian simulacrum is "without original archetype or prototype" (p. 282).

We \[...\] begin, then, by simply casting off the denigration of

virtuality as a dubious and duplicitous xerography. Hereinafter, it

is acceptable to love the simulacrum; and to love it all the more

for departing from re-presentation -- for turning the 're' of

representation from just another one of the same to a wholly

transformative production of something other than the same.

[(Doel and Clarke, 1999,](#index_split_002.html_p126) p. 266)

Whereas for Plato a copy is defined, [as Massumi (1987)](#index_split_002.html_p126) writes, "by the presence or absence of internal, essential relations of resemblance to a

model," in other words, it is tied to a commitment to sameness.

The Deleuzian simulacrum \[...\] bears only an external and

deceptive resemblance to a putative model... \[that\] envelops an

essential difference. (p. 91)

There is a different agenda, then, than to copy an original. Without

anything to copy, its identity is autonomously forged, independent of

any permanent model. Rather than a reflection of something else, it is

a *sui generis* interaction of horizontal vital intensities -- of what Deleuze calls vectors and lines of force -- that are always active behind

the sedimented identities.

The thrust of the process is not to become an equivalent of the

'model' but to turn against it and its world in order to open a new

space for the simulacrum's own mad proliferation. The simula-

crum affirms its own difference. [(Massumi, 1987,](#index_split_002.html_p126) p. 91) Our first response to a dream of someone familiar to us, say a dream of

our mother, is to equate the dream image with the actual person, as if

the image were merely a copy or simulacrum. But working with the

dream, it soon becomes clear that this outward appearance is hiding a

difference, for the "mother" in the dream, as a spontaneous product

of the imagination, has an autonomy of its own that breaks from its

referential origin. As [Hillman (1979)](#index_split_002.html_p126) says:

The persons I engage with in dreams are neither representations

(simulacra) of their living selves nor parts of myself. They are

shadow images \[...\] they are personae, masks \[...\]. (pp. 60--1)

As he says elsewhere, they are "the deep, subjective psyche in its personified guises" (p. 98).

[]{#index_split_002.html_p113}94 *Evolving conceptions*

The simulacrum becomes indeed, as Doel and Clarke put it, "a

transformative production of something that is other than the same"

(p. 266). It does not re-present something through resemblance and

sameness, but merely *presents* the ever moving flow of experience, a vital force that will emerge in new constellations, bringing forth difference instead.

Now, for Plato and the subsequent tradition in philosophical

thought, knowledge was possible only by reference to a stable iden-

tity, to an external and unchangeable model, and difference, as he declared, is "unthinkable in itself" [(Deleuze, 1994,](#index_split_002.html_p126) p. 145). The Deleuzian simulacrum, on the contrary, rejects the paradigm of sameness to which Plato and the tradition adhere; embracing change

and movement, the simulacrum becomes a center of new formations,

opening the floodgates to the prolific creation of new identities that

constitute sensible experience in time, thus bringing change back to

the fore of human consciousness. Deleuze sets the task of finding a way to think the difference that Plato declared unthinkable, but

which is inevitable if we are to come to know anything in the ever flowing river of temporal experience.

Because the metaphysics of presence since Plato is predicated on the

centrality and prevalence of being, sameness and permanence, it

invents a still and unchanging structure, a crust as it were, that replaces the vitality of temporal experience and the pulse of becoming

with the illusion of an unchanging world. It provides a scaffolding by

which, detained in thought, the contingent can be made an object of

intellectual knowledge.

We are, indeed, living in a time where digital entities enter our world (holograms, avatars, memes, gifs, etc.) not as copies that

downgrade or upgrade reality, but as virtual simulacra (i.e., as spon-

taneous and creative emergences) active from within themselves and

not in terms of an external or transcendent original. Given the impact

our technological gadgets are having on how we experience the world,

we need a new ontology that instead of covering up, or sedimenting,

opens up to the aliveness of experience and its differential com-

plexity.

[**2 Differentials and microperceptions**](#index_split_000.html_p11)

Behind our stable perceptions, there is the evershifting multiplicity of

the sensible, which is composed of what Deleuze calls "micro-

perceptions," that is, fuzzy or unconscious perceptions beneath

our "macroperceptions." It is from these constellations of different intensities that freely circulate under our awareness that clear perceptions will eventually emerge into consciousness. What we

normally consider to be perception is in fact, as [Murphie (2002)](#index_split_002.html_p126)

[]{#index_split_002.html_p114} *The inexorable flow* 95

writes, "a differential operation at the threshold of percep-

tion" (p. 199).

The virtual is an immanent presence that underlies the real, a pul-

sating energy, "a pure a-subjective current" (pp. 3--4), an in-

determinate vitality, an open-ended power of reorganization that "is

made of virtualities" [(Deleuze, 1997,](#index_split_002.html_p126) p. 5). Massumi thinks of them as a "pressing crowd of incipiencies and tendencies" [(Bennett, 2010,](#index_split_002.html_p126)

p\. 57) underlying matter; they interact as "a set of speeds and slow-

nesses between unformed particles" [(Deleuze and Guattari, 1987,](#index_split_002.html_p126)

p\. 262) that flow at the edge of conscious awareness. They actualize

the virtual, not by repeating (the same) but by negotiating the mesh

of differences, the microperceptions that generate "a wholly trans-

formative production of something that is other than the same" [(Doel](#index_split_002.html_p126)

[and Clarke, 1999,](#index_split_002.html_p126) p. 266). For [Deleuze and Guattari (1987),](#index_split_002.html_p126)

Every constellation of singularities and traits deducted from the

flow---selected, organized, stratified---in such a way as to con-

verge \[\...\] artificially and naturally \[\...\] is a veritable inven-

tion. (p. 406)

As Jane [Bennett (2010)](#index_split_002.html_p126) explains, "we are talking here of a materiality that is *itself* heterogeneous, itself a differential of intensities, itself *a* life \[... where\] there is no point of pure stillness. No indivisible atom

that is not itself aquiver with virtual force" (p. 57).

The virtual is however not merely possibility. The possible is a

mental construct that lies within the abstract structures of thought and theory, and only becomes real when it enters the immanent field

of perception, whereas the virtual is always already real as a differential. [Bennett (2010)](#index_split_002.html_p126) calls it a "peculiar 'motility' of an intensity,"

"a vibratory effluescence that persists before and after any arrangement in space" (p. 57). The virtual is there always as the "minute, obscure, confused perceptions" [(Deleuze, 2015,](#index_split_002.html_p126) p. 86) from which conscious, clear, and distinct macro-perceptions eventually emerge; it

does not await some event to become real.

This distinction between the possible and the virtual is crucial for

understanding how the digital-virtual can precipitously devolve into a

hypostatization of the possible. We need only think of the experience

we might have had when we first got a digital music service like Spotify that put all songs ever recorded at our immediate disposal. In

our excitement, our desire is ignited, and we thrill at the possibility of

playing through any song we could think of. The virtual has been awoken. But after a while, the thrill subsides and the zero

dimensionality of digital possibility freezes something. The music is drained of its uniqueness, everything starts to sound the same. A deadened feeling creeps in which causes a further plunge into a more

[]{#index_split_002.html_p115}96 *Evolving conceptions*

intense search for that elusive song that would redeem it all, if we could just keep looking. If there's one thing the digital excels in, it is

in offering us to make real, at any moment we choose, the endless possibility of novelty. But, in the end, what at first awakened the virtual, now causes it to flee. The excesses of digital possibility drain

out the liveliness from experience, like water squeezed from a sponge.

When these forces of flux constellate into a perception, they inject

temporality into the real. The simulacrum is not to be conceived as a

static object, somehow reflecting, duplicating something else but as an animated center of emergence. Simulacra stand at the threshold of

perception. Every simulacrum then, is a constellated set of micro-

perceptions that obeys no prior model, but rather constitutes a radical

transmutation.

Perhaps we can understand the mechanism or process of this

transmutation by considering what goes on in the following stanza

from 'Être': a composition by the Chilean musical artist Nicolas Jaar:

It's a body floating into the land

No, it's a body swimming out into the water

No, it's the land itself here that's a body

A body of land

It's the water itself that's a body of water[1](#index_split_002.html_p126)

In this text the frontiers between identities, or territories demarcated

by definite concepts, are de-constructed, subjected to the movement

between possible different aspects of a perception, transforming a

description of a (static) object to the expression of a dynamic

constellation of forces in movement.

By deconstructing the ties between model and copy, or doing away

with a model altogether, Jaar creates the experience in which the si-

mulacrum is traversed by the fluidity of time. When time is injected

into something sedimented, microperceptions are activated that be-

cloud our perceptual experience, causing new zones of perception to

emerge, new aspects to dawn, as Wittgenstein says.

This diffusion of the world into microperceptions and differentials

becomes even clearer in the video that attaches to Nicolas Jaar's poem,

where one is never quite certain whether they are seeing a body, land,

a reflection of a body in the water, or the reflection of land on the surface of the water. Or, perhaps more precisely, where what one is seeing is not separable from the uncertainty of these different

modulations of perception.

We begin to perceive and experience no longer in terms of sub-

stances, but in terms of processes; we leave behind hierarchies and move on to networks, from considering things in terms of quantities

we begin to see them as qualities, or as [Deleuze (1992)](#index_split_002.html_p126) says, objects

[]{#index_split_002.html_p116} *The inexorable flow* 97

become objectiles. The objectile (i.e., the object conceived of as moving entity) as an event discloses the simulacrum's grounding, no

longer in some ideal atemporal realm but in an immanent world of

temporality, a flock of differentials.

The way the act of remembering is described by Matt [Bluemink](#index_split_002.html_p126)

[(2020)](#index_split_002.html_p126) in his *In memoriam* of the famous philosopher of technology Bernard Stiegler, after his recent death, clearly illustrates what we are

describing above. Bluemink tells the story of Stiegler in a French prison for bank robbery in the early 80's making his way through the

prison library, chock full of the great works of 19th- and 20th-century

philosophy, where he fell in love with the discipline. As he read and

reread and took notes from these texts

he found that his present interpretation was not identical to the

one he had presented previously, or the one he remembered. He

came to realise that what he had read the previous day had

modified his memories. In other words, the exteriorisations of

consciousness \[...\] that were laid out on the page in the form of

letters and words had fundamentally changed his perception and

interpretation of those memories. This led him to demonstrate

that our memory is never static---it is constantly being changed

\[...\]. Matt Bluemink. In Memoriam. In *#am Magazine*, August

[stiegler-in-memoriam/](https://www.3ammagazine.com)

The contents of memory are not static unities; they are "a flock of differentials" that are being permanently touched by what we perceive and experience, and so transformed into what they are now,

where "now" is an indexical, always referring to this present moment

and its current movement. Memories are indeed not objects but

objectiles.

The Deleuzian simulacrum thrives in a logic of becoming, popu-

lated not by the full presences of external things, but by ghostly presences and hauntings. Like the image provided to us by Jaar, it is

the very fluidity of everything that impregnates us with its irreducible

ephemerality. The call to love the simulacrum involves, therefore, an

acceptance of our permanent uncertainty, our connection to non-

being, our standing on the edge, where we can "begin to feel, or ought

to feel terrified that maybe language (and understanding, and

knowledge) rests upon very shaky foundations -- a thin net over an abyss" [(Cavell, 1979,](#index_split_002.html_p126) p. 178).

[Deleuze and Krauss (1983),](#index_split_002.html_p126) quoting Nietzsche, drives this same point home:

[]{#index_split_002.html_p117}98 *Evolving conceptions*

Behind every cave ... there is, and must necessarily be, a still deeper

cave: an ampler, stranger, richer world beyond the surface, an abyss

behind every bottom, beneath every "foundation." (p. 53)

The event is a force of movement along many different and im-

perceptible dimensions. The passage from minute, microperceptions

to conscious perceptions is not a quantitative, measurable matter. It is

a kind of bricolage in motion, unmappable, stripped of Cartesian

coordinates, not to be understood in terms of a totality or a sum of

homogeneous parts, but as a function of particles in motion, waves and beams of light, and sudden flashes. It results in a particular non-linear, non-hierarchical, non-causal manner of being that introduces

us to the order of resonances and echoes, and horizontal connections.

This is how James Hillman (1979) describes, for example, the

dreamwork, when he compares it with the activity of a bricoleur:

\[T\]he dream bricoleur is a handyman, who takes the bits of junk

left over from the day and potters about with them, tacking

residual things together into a collage. While the fingers that form

a dream destroy the original sense of these residues, at the same

time they shape them into a new sense within a new context \[...\]

Imagination works by deforming and forming at one and the

same moment. (pp. 127--128)

Representation gives way to expression or performance, and the se-

dimented objects of the scribal mind implode and begin to flow,

constituting meaning not from linear, logical linkages but from intensive tides, pulsations, and forces of attraction and repulsion.

Quality is introduced where quantity had been the rule. It is propelled

not by a rational need for totality but by affective impressions and attractions that are inwardly charged, in dynamic tension. Those

animate forces are responsible for the passage from vitality to consciousness. An "infinite sum of minute perceptions that destabilize the preceding macroperception while preparing the following one"

[(Deleuze, 2015,](#index_split_002.html_p126) p. 86) produce a conscious perception. The task of all perception, Deleuze says, is "pulverizing the world, but also \[...\]

spiritualizing its dust" (p. 87).

[**3 Rhizomatic play**](#index_split_000.html_p11)

In the move from substances to processes, from objects to objectiles

that we have been illustrating with Jaar's song, a new logical frame-

work arises. Whereas the guiding metaphor for the traditional logic that deals with substances was conceived in terms of the arboreous (as

in Descartes' tree of knowledge), in this new logic, [Deleuze and](#index_split_002.html_p126)

[]{#index_split_002.html_p118} *The inexorable flow* 99

[Guattari (1987)](#index_split_002.html_p126) refer to the image of the "rhizome," which in contrast to the hierarchical and sequential mode of thought, is characterized

more by circulations than by lines and angles:

\[U\]nlike trees or their roots, \[the rhizome\] connects any point to

any other point, and its traits are not necessarily linked to traits of

the same nature; \[...\] It is composed not of units but of dimen-

sions, or rather directions in motion. It has neither beginning nor

end, but always a middle (milieu) from which it grows and which

it overspills. (p. 21)

The rhizomatic deconstructs the scribal order, insofar as it goes

against its logical hierarchical structure, thus making the very notion

of representation idle. The inherence of a system of referentiality that

binds the simulacrum-as-copy to an original is abolished. It explodes

the static model that provided fuel to the original-copy relation, creating a multiplicity of forces that in fluid horizontal interaction result in wholly new self-originating, autochthonous meanings.

This shattering of the familiar framework and rebirth of the rhizo-

matic that characterized the oral is illustrated in the word play that

takes place in Blossom Dearie's song "Rhode Island Is Famous

for You":

Copper comes from Arizona/ Peaches come from Georgia/ and

Lobsters come from Maine/ The wheat fields/ are the sweet fields

of Nebraska/ and Kansas gets Bonanzas from the Grain// \[...\]

/Pencils come from Pennsylvania/ Vest from Vest Virginia/ And

Tents from Tent-esee/ They know mink where they grow / Mink in

Wyo-mink/ A camp chair in New Hamp-chair / That\'s for me.

(Blossom Dearie, "Rhode Island is Famous For You" by Arthur

Schwarz and Howard Dietz)

In this portion of the lyrics of this song, sameness in sound becomes

the alibi for the reconstitution of new interrelations that connect layers of meaning that were previously unconnected. "Kansas' bo-nanzas from the grain" are well within the literal meaning with which

the song begins, but by the end, when we arrive at "Pencils from Pennsylvania" and then from "Mink to Wyomink," or "a camp chair

with New Hampshire" it is the sound and rhyme that counts, no

longer the truth of the facts or the information about the places dis-

cussed that those words represent. Suddenly there is play. The words

in the song slide from representational to acoustical meaning, as the

"meaning" of the words becomes secondary to the sound that pre-

vails. New connections are distilled from petrified meanings, weaving

new relations in an alternative web of virtuality.

[]{#index_split_002.html_p119}100 *Evolving conceptions*

Another illustration of the rhizomatic shift we are explicating is found in the work of the French performance artist ORLAN. In a live

Internet transmission, she subjected her face to reconstructive surgery

and had a second mouth opened on her cheek. Her surgical inter-

vention disrupts the connections that are active in our normal perception. The mouth becomes something very different when it is seen

as part of one's cheek. The face no longer looks like the face but is dispersed in new infinitesimal differential relations, that evoke -- at both the conscious and unconscious level -- new (and perhaps, here,

shocking) perceptions.

An example from James Baldwin's *Giovanni's Room* [(2000)](#index_split_002.html_p126) reinforces the same occurrence:

I was in bed upstairs, asleep. It was quite late. I was suddenly awakened by the sound of my father's footfalls on the walk

beneath my window. I could tell by the sound and the rhythm

that he was a little drunk and I remember that at that moment a

certain disappointment, an unprecedented sorrow entered into

me. I had seen him drunk many times and had never felt this

way -- on the contrary, my father sometimes had great charm

when he was drunk -- But that night I suddenly felt that there was

something in it, in him, to be despised. (p. 21)

Here we see again a new and unexpected impression displacing what is

familiar, cracking open the crust that covers up the virtual differentials, setting them free as fragments from which new ways of seeing spontaneously arise. A conscious perception is therefore not the result of the

ordinary object or its familiarity, but rather arises from the minute and

unconscious perceptions quickening beneath it. The simulacrum is not

a mirror that reflects the world but, we could say, a black mirror that

absorbs it, sucks it into a field of yet unformed forces, a dark vitality that can now come to light in new constellations.

In the Deleuzian simulacrum the meaning and reality of the event is

determined from within its own occurrence and not by any external

model or criterion. The simulacrum, in other words, is not a re-

production but an emergence. Differentials weave opposites together

into a rhizomatic psychic and physical space, and the images pro-

duced by the virtual resemble nothing other than themselves in their

own movement. As [Deleuze (2015)](#index_split_002.html_p126) puts it, "Resemblance \[here\] is equated with what resembles, not with what is resembled" (p. 96).

Abstract painting, for example, results from the dismantlement of

the representational scaffolding of normal perception by the forms

and colors emanating from the canvas. The "reality" that emerges in

abstract art is independent of any model; it owes allegiance to nothing

but its own autonomous occurrence.

[]{#index_split_002.html_p120} *The inexorable flow* 101

But when the simulacrum is understood as a false copy (first stance),

its own originary differential virtuality is denigrated as inferior; and

when it is seen as perfecting the real (second stance), that perfection

overshadows its living immanence. From this new perspective the

simulacrum involves neither denigration nor idealization. It evi-

dences the fact that the actual is permeated by the virtual, which goes

all the way down, in these minute perceptions, inexhaustibly. More

than a mere possibility, it is invisibly active, always and forever able to emerge.

What the simulacrum does in its state of severance from an original

is to usher us behind the scene of the representational, beyond the mimetic contract of sameness that the traditionally understood

Platonic model imposes on us. As [Deleuze and Krauss (1983)](#index_split_002.html_p126) see it: Plato, by dint of inquiring in the direction of the simulacrum,

discovers, in the flash of an instant as he leans over its abyss, that

the simulacrum is not simply a false copy, but that it calls into question the very notions of the copy ... and of the model. (p. 47)

By rendering the simulacrum free from its commitments to re-

presentation, Deleuze's ontology opens us to the abyss over which

Plato leans.

As we have said, it is the masked difference behind the surface

similarity and its rhizomatic play that constitutes the depth of the simulacrum. In Deleuze's (1983) words:

The simulacrum \[...\] contains a positive power \[...\] It sets up the

world of nomadic distributions and consecrated anarchy. Far from

being a new foundation, it swallows up all foundations, it assures

a universal collapse, but as a positive and joyous event, as

de-founding (effondement). (p. 53)

Whereas a copy merely stands for its model, the Deleuzian simulacrum

instead generates different circuits of connections and associations that

break the rigidity of representation.

[**4 Modulating modulations**](#index_split_000.html_p11)

In the digital age, we awaken to a new ecology of the virtual, where the

actual is not only permanently open to, but also inseparable from it.

The Deleuzian simulacrum is not a mimesis, but a "modulation." It liberates experience of the world from the paralyzing expectation of stability by temporalizing it. [As Murphie (2002)](#index_split_002.html_p126) points out, it is not that virtuality itself has been increased with the digital, but rather that it is our ability to modulate it that has been dramatically enhanced. With

[]{#index_split_002.html_p121}102 *Evolving conceptions*

each new technological advance "modulation is no longer a filter for a

stable world, but is applied to modulation itself, so that everything is

taken up within this modulation of modulation" (p. 191).

We can screen in or screen out, speed up or slow down, intensify or

block out different dimensions of the real, regulating the many ways

the world is open to us -- ontologically, perceptually and affectively.

The virtual is nothing other than the permeability of the real to these

modulations. The digital provides the tools for modulating that per-

meability, in ways that -- for the first time in history -- put the human

totally in charge.

As we have already seen in the first part of the book, we can

understand the history of the virtual as a history of its successive modulations. The oral articulation of the virtual, we could say, constitutes its first modulation, making private experience shareable in our verbal interaction. The written word modulates that modulation,

extending the public realm beyond its actual living context, traversing

space and time. The virtual is further modulated with the moving

image, which insufflates time into virtual space. The flow of actual experience becomes shareable, not just its conceptual or photographic

modulation, but also the sensible dimension that had been previously

suspended.

The digital modulates these modulations of the virtual, not just by

new representations, but by the creation of a new virtual public space

where -- differently from the space of the moving image -- it becomes

interactive and independent of our physical location. Indeed, it

doesn't only duplicate or represent, but begins to merge with physical

experience. We begin to inhabit, together, a common spatial and

temporal situation other than the one we are empirically occupying.

VR creates a totality which (potentially) both overwhelms present

perceptive thresholds and creates, rather than represents, a "total *enough* world" within the world(s) at large. [(Murphie, 2002,](#index_split_002.html_p126) p. 193) These new modulations bring to the fore dimensions of the virtual that had remained below the threshold of conscious perception.

Insofar as we can now extract time from personal, subjective tem-

porality, we become also able to modulate it -- accelerate, decelerate,

and stop it -- reconstituting experience by virtually reassembling its original order, merging different temporalities to our own experience

of time. In the example we already considered in the introduction, replaying in slow motion the capture of our peeling an orange, the pressure of our fingers against the peel is evoked in the experience of

the screen images, where the conjunction of our bodily memory and

the audiovisual feed unveils aspects of our subjective experience that

usually go unnoticed. The fleshiness of the fruit, the precise

[]{#index_split_002.html_p122} *The inexorable flow* 103

movements of our fingers in interaction with the orange, and so on,

all aspects which would otherwise have remained buried in the

darkness of unconscious oblivion now open into consciousness, pro-

viding in this encounter, the rudiments of new vocabularies and

common discourses that can broaden the range of lived experience.

VR brings in front of us something that we have always ignored, i.e.,

the movement behind what we saw as stable bodies and fixed states of

affairs. [Murphie (2002)](#index_split_002.html_p126) writes that it

brings to an end the regimes of separation which would, through

the operation of certain representations, deny the *interactive*

reality of the virtual and the actual in favor of a simple facticity

of *stable* bodies and *fixed* states of affairs. [(Murphie, 2002,](#index_split_002.html_p126) p. 192) As a consequence, we are able now to begin to see the world beyond

those sedimented perceptions that had constituted our familiar pre-

digital world and deliberately affect it, modulating the virtual that had

previously remained unconscious.

In instituting a new *public* interactive realm beyond the bounds of ordinary space and time, new modes of intersubjective experience

enter our social lives in the digital world. Human relationships are dislocated from their ordinary and everyday time-space coordinates so

that the kinds of things we say, the forms by which we speak with others, the bonds we make, are all transformed.

We learn to combine and integrate, or separate and distinguish

different aspects of our lives. With those captures we effect further

modulations that open spaces of relating where we begin to live

beyond empirical life. The committed partner, for example, can be

in touch, through Facebook, with their first high school boyfriend

or girlfriend. There can be contact, play, active reminiscing, and so

on and yet, because it is held in virtual space, it does not necessarily

threaten the partner\'s actual relationship with their husband or

wife. The experience of intolerable tension and conflict that an

empirical encounter produces in actual life, can be muted or dis-

solved through the digital modulation -- through Zoom conversa-

tions or Instagram lives -- and so wholly transform or complement

the empirical relationship. By being able to better filter what we show to the other of ourselves, digital virtuality softens something,

sharpens or invents something else, in other words, it greatly expands the psychological possibilities of relating. Adding texture to

our relational lives, and drawing out in original ways the inter-

subjective virtuality that is always already at play, the virtual staging offers a new medium for containing the inherent tensions

endemic to human relationships.

[]{#index_split_002.html_p123}104 *Evolving conceptions*

Freed from spatiotemporal locality, our whereabouts become ir-

relevant, and so the virtual may complement the present actual

context, our everyday life, with unexpected possible connections. In

that ethereal space of virtuality, many different dimensions of ex-

perience and temporalities crisscross, potentially creating con-

stellations that escape the exclusive one-track sequence of fixed

identities or logical meanings. Thus, we construct from what we see

and read about people on social media, identities that no longer

correspond to the actual time and space in which each person lives,

unveiling possibilities of relations that are non-existent in our mere

physical interaction. How often do we learn about someone's ac-

tivities that belong to the past in our virtual screen, yet we ignore

that temporal constraint, treating it as if it were happening now, with no real consequence. Past moments may be woven together

with the present in different ways than they do actually in reality.

For example, someone might comment on a trip we took last year,

as if it were a recent event, without our correcting them but simply

taking these dislocations in time as new routes of shared experience,

alternative historical sequences, new or unexpected topics and dis-

courses that change and diversify our original experience. The vir-

tuality of the space in which we are relating makes any discrepancy

with actual fact irrelevant to the dynamics of the relationship and,

to the contrary, mines those discrepancies for unexpected meanings

and relations.

The a-historicity of events in the virtual world creates alternative realities where we are free to participate and shape them as sequences

in a playful blending of actuality and virtuality that may, in the end,

have actual consequences. When Facebook gives you back images

from the anniversary of an event, say, by reposting them on your wall,

stories are relived outside their actual temporal contexts, virtually re-

experienced. With the historical havoc wreaked by this muting of

chronological time and experience, and the constant delivery of au-

tomatic (timeless) images from the digital media, our memories are stratified and layered together in unforeseen ways.

Our new digital apparatuses allow us, therefore, as [Murphie (2002)](#index_split_002.html_p126)

puts it, "to shift the gears on the thresholds of perception, operation,

and expression more powerfully than ever before" (p. 188). The

digital-virtual offers, beyond social interaction, a new way of modulating the play between fantasy and reality, thus providing novel spaces for the expression and strivings of the self.

In the second season of the HBO comedy *Crashing*, we find an amusing illustration of this. The main character, played by Peter

Holmes, who has been living in his friend's garage, in one particular

scene is sitting on a couch, his computer on his lap, getting ready to

masturbate. He types in the word *boobs* into Google Images and gets a

[]{#index_split_002.html_p124} *The inexorable flow* 105

screenful of pictures of women with tight dresses, showing their

cleavage. Not satisfied, we see him remove his Google Filter, which had been set on high (to screen out explicitly sexual material), and now he gets a series of very salacious pornographic pictures of breasts

as well as vaginas and penises and people engaged in a surprising variety of sexual acts. As this becomes too much for him, he then changes his filter back to medium and a new series of pictures of woman's breasts suddenly appears on his screen that are just right for

what he wants. As this character successfully discovers the exact level

of explicitness he needs to satisfy his onanistic urges, we witness the

modulation of modulations in action.

A masked difference, we have seen, lays behind the surface simi-

larity of the Deleuzian simulacrum, constituting its creative power.

When we construct a self from the representations of someone's di-

gital footprint in the virtual world, that construction's depth is grounded on the differences that such variations, free from their dependence on a "real" and fixed model, are able to uncover, and not on

the supposed identity of the subject.

From the perspective of the conventional self, what would seem

fragmented here instead makes it possible for us to see an aspect of

that person that was previously unseen. No longer subservient to

the person we know (yet still connected to him or her), this new

identity acquires a validity that relies on the intensity or expressiveness of what is virtually emerging. The constraints of objective

truth are thus lifted, as they are in fictional narratives (oral, written, photographed, filmed). Playing with temporality, undoing

linear developmental assumptions about how an individual life

unfolds, we constellate different and diverging identities. Although

fragmented and partial, there will be a multiplicity of qualities

ascribed to a person and recognizable beyond her so-called "real"

identity. They won't represent anything essential, but -- more

imagistic, associative, intuitive -- they become containers of pre-

viously inoperative potentialities, now actualized in the vitality of

the digital.

Breaking thresholds, ushering suprasensible similarities, "in-

ternal relations" between things, the inexorable flow between the

actual and virtual awakens in us a new sensibility by which we may

begin to construct a reality more attuned to a range of differences

that did not exist before the advent of the virtual world. Beyond its

enriching our experience by providing us with the possibility for

new connections, the digital taps into a spontaneity from which

the "mad proliferation" beyond the constraints of an already

established reality can arise.

With the virtual world we are learning to live with simulacra and

their reckless and unforeseeable promiscuity. Resonances with the

[]{#index_split_002.html_p125}106 *Evolving conceptions*

passions and emotions begin to reverberate rhizomatically. Emotional

expression in the web (sometimes sponsored by the cloak of in-

visibility available there) is opening realms of shared meaning that before never passed the walls of a family setting, or the closet of one's

own inhibited mind. As we will see in [Chapter 8,](#index_split_005.html_p222) when we discuss the loss of Benjamin's "mimetic faculty," we will see how modes of

thought that have been relegated to the fringes of modern culture start to be activated in this inversion toward the non-referential Deleuzian simulacrum. And the potentiation of spontaneity in

whichever form it takes -- be it natural or artificial or a hybrid of the

two -- may well serve as a training ground for what is becoming our

post-human future. The question again is whether this shaping is

not just another step in a sequence, but a quantum leap in human consciousness.

[**Coda**](#index_split_000.html_p11)

In our digital ecology, a new spectrum of experience opens up that challenges the hierarchical power-structures of traditional thinking.

This becomes intelligible to us from the perspective provided by what

we have been calling the Deleuzian simulacrum. But true to its

pharmacological nature, these new technologies also seem to be

reinforcing the dualistic conception of the Platonic simulacrum that

Deleuze was so forcefully criticizing. Through a repression of difference, these same technologies seem to promote sameness and iden-

tity, pushing us further into our old power arrangements, freezing the

world rather than freeing us to the rhizomatic play of digital life. As

[Murphie (2002)](#index_split_002.html_p126) points out:

This increased ability to operate the virtual is by no means

immediately ethically positive. It is not until we answer the

question, each time specifically, of what manner of living it

implies, of what passions can break up the trademarks we

increasingly live through every time we boot up. (p. 192)

So what manner of living does this new digital age imply? Does the

breakdown of referentiality and self-dissemination in digital virtuality

adhere to the spirit of Deleuze's post-Platonic metaphysics, or is it a

mere bastardization of it? Does virtual reality deliver us to the immanent field, or is the flash/bang of digital impregnation merely

window dressing, disguising a further deepening of the fissure

between the virtual and the real that Deleuze is so intent on decon-

structing? Does cyberspace instantiate rhizomatic play or does it fur-

ther disavow it? Or is it instead, that it does both?

[**Introduction to Part III**](#index_split_000.html_p12)

The Deleuzian simulacrum, in not having a source outside of its own

becoming, is resonant with the unconscious psyche that underlies our

affective lives. They both allude to a source of alterity and otherness,

out of which perceptions and meanings arise, that traverses the human

subject. If indeed we want to explicate in what ways digitality ushers us

into the rhizomatic, we have to examine how it opens or forecloses access to the non-representable aspects of our being. Depth psychology

can help us wrestle with these questions. With its own unique renderings of how we psychologically live out our virtual nature, it sheds

an important light on the agonizing tension between immanence and

transcendence that entrenches itself in everything digital.

Deleuze's radical ontology opens into a temporal world that resonates

with the frenzied activity of digital life. But what if, unconsciously, we

make use of this newfound power to further something in us that un-

dermines the creative expansion that revealed itself to us so compellingly when we saw the digital through Deleuze's eyes? Possessed by power, greed, and hubris, our technologies seem indeed to pull us in the

opposite direction toward a fixed and ossified world. Can we hold the

tension between the virtual world as rhizomatic and the virtual world as

mimetic, between the virtual as presentation and the virtual as representation? This becomes the underlying theme of what is to follow,

in particular, as we explore the implications of what it means today to be

endowed with the digital powers to modulate, in unprecedented ways,

the actualization of our innermost wishes and desires.

What happens to the real in an age when the very stuff of our

fantasy lives is so effortlessly actualized in the virtual world rather than in the empirical? What, in other words, lends itself to falsifica-tion or mere replication, and what opens in fact new doors to experience and reality? By exploring what might be provoked in our

unconscious life by these new tools, we can better assess what of di-

gital virtuality is faithful to the Deleuzian vision and what betrays it.

[]{#index_split_002.html_p130}[**5 The virtual within**](#index_split_000.html_p12)

[**Prelude**](#index_split_000.html_p12)

One central idea running through the depth psychological tradition is

that fantasy and reality live in a rich and complex set of dialectics. [1](#index_split_003.html_p156)

This underlying dualism has far-reaching implications, and spawns a

powerful set of dichotomies, whose dynamic tension generates the

very contours of our psychic lives: the inner world and external rea-

lity, internal objects and real objects, the unconscious and conscious

mind, self and world. The mode of virtuality that arises from our new

technologies, what we have been referring to as digital virtuality (as

opposed to its human counterpart), unsettles these well-entrenched

dichotomies, destabilizing the ways in which we have come to make

sense of our psychology. Digital virtuality is a singular space with its

own unique dynamics. It turns the inner (and often private) world of

fantasy and imagination outward, as psychic life is now lived collec-

tively in the social media; simultaneously it turns the outer world of

material reality (including, of course, the body) inward, as it now appears on our screens in the form of virtual simulations.

The possibility of digital virtuality arises from the technological innovations of the 21st century that have allowed us to code reality,

and thus virtualize the events and processes not only of the organic,

material world, but of our minds and our bodies as well. As [Zuboff](#index_split_003.html_p158)

[(2015)](#index_split_003.html_p158) puts it: "As a result of pervasive computer mediation, nearly every aspect of the world is rendered in a new symbolic dimension as

events, objects, processes and people become visible, knowable, and

shareable in a new way" (p. 77). Indeed, the very term "virtual reality"

has now become one of the most important and critical, even though

still opaque and ill-defined, signifiers of our contemporary technolo-

gical discourse. We will employ this term, and its counterpart, the digital virtual, in the broadest, most open and encompassing way

possible to describe the realm of human experience and interaction produced by the digital. We understand digital virtuality as a new way

[]{#index_split_002.html_p131}112 *Depth psychology in the digital age*

in which life and mind are virtualized, and the border between the virtual and the actual radically reconfigured.

But, at the same time, we want to distinguish it from human virtuality here defined as the psychological and existential play of fantasy

and reality that grounds our embodied existence. Compared to its di-

gital counterpart, human virtuality is located inside the coordinates of

our identities as psychological beings. And thus, our term of choice, the

virtual within, becomes a moniker for the mode of virtuality that is native to a depth psychological perspective, a virtuality out of which

we maintain an inner sense of self while living in the world with others.

The very project of depth psychology is one that traces how the

actual becomes virtual: how trauma, loss, the implacability of the real,

as well as the affectively-charged events of human life, become de-literalized, de-substantialized, and thus transformed into psychic

realities. [Hillman (1979)](#index_split_001.html_p59) contends that movement along this path from the actual to the virtual, from concrete reality to the symbolic, is

one of the central functions of our dreaming life.

\[T\]he dream is less a comment on the day than a digestive process

within the labyrinthine tracts of the psyche. The dream-work

cooks life events into psychic substance by means of imaginative

modes ... This work takes matter out of life and makes them into

soul, at the same time feeding soul each night with new

material. (p. 96)

Indeed, as we proceed, one of the primary ways that we will compare

human and digital virtuality is from the perspective of the existential

coordinates that constitute our dreaming lives. Here we concur with

[Ogden (2009)](#index_split_001.html_p59) that dreaming is "the most free, most inclusive, and most deeply penetrating form of psychological work of which human

beings are capable" (p. 104). Dream life is rife with what is most other

in the psyche, i.e. its a-subjective and non-representable dimensions,

and, at the same time, with what is most personal, distinctive, and familiar. Our dreaming minds, our capacity for fantasy, reverie, and

imagination, the very source of psychological virtuality that makes us

who we are, will be the tableau against which we want to examine the

virtuality endemic to the digital. Each is replete with a fantastic freedom of action and "transformational fluidity" [(Scott, 1999),](#index_split_002.html_p109) yet, what is different in their occurrence -- the fact that in the digital, this

freedom of action is under the control of the self, whereas in the dream, it seems to arise from an other-than-me source -- leads us to ask

how the virtuality of the digital age is impacting our relationship to

the virtual that comes alive in dreams. What is it doing to the intui-

tions of the non-representable inherent to our dreaming minds? What

is it doing, in fact, to the human virtual?

[]{#index_split_002.html_p132} *The virtual within* 113

The digital unleashes the private experiences of the self into the collective and networked spaces of contemporary life. For example, in

the past, the experience of birth and death involved rituals kept sheltered within our most intimate circles. The digital has radically transformed these rituals, as today, these events (and indeed practically all aspects of our emotional lives) occur in a much more public

and visible way. It is no longer uncommon to set up webcams in

hospital rooms for the dying and memorial websites for the deceased,

where everyone who has ever had any contact with the person (and

even those who did not) can publicly comment on and interact with

the mourners; websites that remain active with users long after

someone's death and continue on in perpetuity. Long before we are

able to download our consciousness into machines, the digital is

offering us a new kind of immortality.

This sudden obliteration of a private and personal space forces us to

reconsider our sense of boundaries, and the importance of modesty,

discretion, loyalty, and so on. These changes rattle our beliefs about

the individualistic self and its values. They represent a new privileging

of the external over the internal, the public over the private.

Some insist that this dissolution of the self into the maelstrom of

collective forces has the negative effect of foreclosing many, if not all,

of the values that practitioners of depth psychology (in whatever of its

many forms) tend to affirm, such as the freedom of imagination,

"negative capability" [(Li, 2009,](#index_split_001.html_p59) p. ix), interior depth and the privacy of the self, and so on. [2](#index_split_003.html_p156) This anxiety about the possibility of such foreclosure speaks to the concern that something essential is being lost because we no longer consider it worthwhile to preserve the difference between psychic interiority and collective exteriority. Or, to put it another way, we have become so enthralled by the participatory

immediacy of the collective-self provided by our everyday devices that

the other portals for unconscious psychic life that require privacy, solitude, slowness, and stillness are gradually starting to recede. The

exteriorizing that is inherent to the digital self seems to thwart the development of interiority that requires a certain degree of protection

for the privacy of self-experience in the face of collective impingement. Some therapists experience that recession acutely. Perhaps

that's why the presence of the smartphone, perched comfortably in

the patient's lap during a session, is so threatening. They think (and

sometimes even say): "Put that away, at least just for this hour, so we

can focus on just you and I and what is arising both inside and be-

tween ourselves!" And the patient, especially if he is younger, resists

this opprobrium, retorting, "What do you mean interior and exterior,

private and public? They are the same." The smartphone even breaks

down the temporal conditions under which therapy has traditionally

been practiced, infecting the field with virtual time. Text, facetime,

[]{#index_split_002.html_p133}114 *Depth psychology in the digital age*

and email extend in a nearly unlimited way the scope of therapeutic

[contact.3](#index_split_003.html_p156)

This eruption of the digital into what was once considered the most

private and hallowed of all spaces, the therapist's consulting room, gives us pause, as we seriously consider whether the interiorized self's

historical moment has passed. Is it a pre-digital relic, a now archaic and untenable potential for selfhood that in the contemporary era is

replaced by a digitized self that only dreams collective -- no longer private, hidden, and interior -- dreams [(Giegerich, 2007)?](#index_split_001.html_p59) Have we come indeed to the collapse of the project started by Freud a little over

a century ago?

A world pervaded by digital virtuality challenges our modernist

constructions of selfhood, making obsolete the notion of an inter-

iorized object-relational world that lives in a creative and dynamic tension with the outward demands of social, familial, and cultural life.

If we are truly near the endpoint of this experience of the self, do we

resist the challenge wrought by the digital and try to go back? Or is the

digital revolution offering us a desirable option to the individualistic

subjectivity that has dominated our psychological outlook and our

[]{#index_split_003.html}

conception of the human since the Romantic era? [4](#index_split_003.html_p156) Should we simply let the principles and insights of depth psychology be displaced, or should we protect and preserve them as a necessary compensation for

the losses that we are incurring in the digital era?

The depth psychologist makes the claim that there is always going

to be an essential need to come to terms with forces inside the self that

are distinct from the collective. The internal object world that engenders the complexity of our emotional lives is a reality that cannot

so easily be dismissed. The psyche, contained within each of us, has

an indispensable metabolizing function. It is responsible for transforming the raw, undigested materials of psychic life into structures

that form the architecture of the developing self. Indeed, the very existence of an inner apparatus for the psychological processing of experience is what enables us to come to terms with the existential and emotional realities of life [(Bion, 1983).](#index_split_001.html_p58)

But what the digital suggests is that, on the contrary, there might be

other ways of arranging things to deal with these emotional com-

plexities. Perhaps the psyche is even more vitally engaged and better

contained when we allow ourselves to dwell in the interfluidity between digital virtuality and the real. As explorers of this present-day

world, we are being offered wholly new and distinct ways of bearing

the affective contingencies of everyday life, cooking life events into

"virtual" substances by means of the digital vessel.

The depth psychologists' first impulse is to stand in judgment of digital virtuality, seeing it as false and inauthentic. It is nothing more

than a delinquent attempt to mimic the true source of the virtuality

[]{#index_split_003.html_p134} *The virtual within* 115

emanating from the inner recesses of unconscious life. But this assumes, as we saw in the first stance, that the virtual is inferior to the

real, that the spontaneity and creativity that it generates is no more

than an unconscious investment in the expansion of our narcissism

and its desire for unending gratification. From this vantage point, the

virtuality of digital life is seen as reifying the world, reducing its ex-

istential possibilities rather than furthering them. Experience is dea-

dened, its metaphorical resonances obviated. This adjudication of the

digital as negative and regressive seems to enact a foreclosure of its own, preventing a dialogue with the technological world that has the

potential to revision the traditional dichotomies fundamental to our

conception of psychic life.

In virtual space, the things of the world and the processes of the mind penetrate one another differently than they do in the ordinary,

off-line life of the mind. That difference points to the unique play of

the digital, the way it can so seamlessly engineer a cross-over from mind-fantasies to their actualization in the virtual, freed from both the encumbrances of the body and the materiality of the world. This

rhapsodic intertwining of fantasy, imagination, and virtual reality

places our much beloved and well-theorized psychological meta-

physics on the chopping block. It disrupts and confounds our first principles, the basic set of metapsychological assumptions that have

been determinative for our understanding of how we live as psycho-

logical beings and our relationship to embodiment, other people, and

the external world. The entire mind-body, self-world, inner-outer or-

ganization (i.e., the criss-crossing, two-channel system that is foundational for depth psychology) is subverted. Digital virtuality is a third

term that forces depth psychology, and its binary structures, back on

its toes.

If indeed we have to go back and rethink everything, and en-

visage a way of seeing the psyche that is in tune with the digital

age, we are confronted (again) with the very virtual, in all of its unpredictable wildness, dwelling under the rubric of unconscious

psychic life, which, for over the past 100 years, depth psychology

has been grappling to understand and articulate. We are entering

an era in which the self that arises out of the digital leaves us struggling to find a new framework that can bear and contain the

novel modes of virtuality that are opened up with the advance-

ment of these startling technological changes. The worldview

presupposed by the digital age, as much as that of depth psy-

chology, determine our stance toward the unfathomableness of

human virtuality.

One important vantage point for catching sight of these transfor-

mations is the consideration of how each new technological advance

modulates our relation to temporality. Depth psychology and its

[]{#index_split_003.html_p135}116 *Depth psychology in the digital age*

metapsychological framework arose out of the scribal era. [Derrida](#index_split_001.html_p58)

[(1995a)](#index_split_001.html_p58) remarks that if it wasn't for the very particular temporal rhythms of its early founders sending and receiving letters, psychoanalysis would never have evolved in the particular way that it did.

The digital age, in contrast, is not only speeding up the exchange of

ideas and information, but, in its unparalleled ability to capture human experience, grants us a new kind of dominion over the passing

away of things. The digital offers a defensive refuge from the ravages

of time contemporaneously with the possibility of a more originary experience of human mortality. In its extraordinary capacity to stop

time, the digital is haunted by the specter of death. This signals an essential link between digital virtuality and our mortal condition. If

we are to contend with the virtuality of our era, then we must come to

terms with this paradox. If indeed we are experiencing a shift away from depth psychology, we not only have to embrace those dimensions of the virtual that had been previously foreclosed and are now

opened, but also come to terms with the foreclosure and loss of what

earlier was open and available.

[**1 Digital mind in search of a soul**](#index_split_000.html_p12)

If, for Jung, modern man searched for his soul in the interior cham-

bers of the individual psyche, today, as inhabitants of the digital era,

we turn outward, toward the collective psyche, to discover our depths.

We live less inside ourselves and our own bodies and more in the virtualized spaces that arise out of the interchange between smartphones, social media networks, and the Internet of Everything that connects them. This has a wide-ranging impact on how we experience

psychological reality. The unconscious, that internal place of depth and otherness, is, for the digital man in search of a soul, wholly exteriorized by our technologies. Jung used to say that, in our modern

age, our gods were found no longer in the heavens but in our

pathologies. We might say that today they are found not in the

heavens but in the Cloud, not in our pathologies but in the devices we

carry with us everywhere.

In an age where self-display and network connectedness have be-

come the norm, where there are to be no secrets anymore, no hidden

crevices of the psyche immune from exposure, and self-confession has

become a cultural imperative, it is an edgy time to be practicing psychoanalysis and psychotherapy. It is as if we are living in a digital

Panopticon; everything about us is on perpetual display, as what was

once internal to the self is now voluntarily (and almost compulsively)

laid bare for all to see. This collapse of privacy and internal space is

revealed by the pace and mode in which people speak about their

symptoms and tell the stories of their lives in therapy. The fact that it

[]{#index_split_003.html_p136} *The virtual within* 117

is less metaphorical and more literal, and that there is less capacity for

self-reflectiveness (to say nothing of how taboo it is becoming for there to be moments of silence), is evidence of this collapse. There is a

pressure to get to the next thing and the thing after that, as if therapy

provides another opportunity for binge watching, this time a show

exclusively about the self.

The speed and self-assurance that the digital life inspires bleeds into

the consulting room. It is so difficult to disconnect, even for the hour,

that whenever a patient's smartphone rings or vibrates, he is incap-

able of silencing it without first looking to see who is beckoning. It's

not only the impingements to therapeutic intimacy perpetrated by

the smartphone that poses such a great challenge. There is also little

room for opaqueness; issues must be clarified quickly, and thus we find ourselves as therapists unwittingly rushing to make meaning out

of the patient's material at the pace of a Google search. The digital has

so habituated us to immediate answers that the pressure to do

something, to know something, to solve the problem, in a nearly

automatic fashion, often drives the dialogue. Perhaps this need for quick solutions is a reflection of how, for patient and therapist alike, it is increasingly difficult to tolerate uncertainty and not-knowing,

which is essential for grounding therapeutic work in the life of the unconscious. Today, we are desperate to escape the inferior feelings that come when something is not quickly known and made clear. This

has the effect of impeding the process of allowing something to arise

of its own accord from within, spontaneously and unexpectedly, ra-

ther than its being imposed from the outside, narrowing the scope of

psychotherapeutic practice.

The move to slow down, to think and feel something from the in-

side, is counter-intuitive as today both patient and therapist are pos-

sessed by chronic impatience. This urge for a quick fix has always dogged psychotherapy, especially in its contemporary, positivist

forms. However, that pressure for rapid solutions seems to have intensified, especially since the digital life of the patient -- his text messages, dating profiles, Facebook and Instagram postings -- have

now become the *prima materia* (the prime matter) of the therapeutic

work. The unconscious, no longer extracted from the interior reaches

of a private self, springs forth from a fecund and proliferating super-

abundance of digital images, sounds, and narratives that we have

become more and more porous to in our intensified virtual life. The

internal object world, once the sacred province of depth psychology,

has now suddenly become populated with the characters of the

"shows" and tv series we are watching such that we find ourselves preoccupied with the fictional lives of those we identify with in our

screens. Of course, we have always been susceptible to this with no-

vels, movies, soap operas, etc., but there is something uniquely

[]{#index_split_003.html_p137}118 *Depth psychology in the digital age*

penetrating about the way these streaming services deliver their

content that accounts for this new form of psychic inhabitation.

Psychic life and digital life have become so intertwined that the psy-

chodynamics of the everyday are not easily distinguished from the

cyber-dynamics generated by the digital. This is why very often a good

deal of what happens in any one session involves metabolizing the patient's digitally saturated everyday experience.

In an age of digital openness, where the sharing of intimate images

and narratives about one's life in an extended virtual space with others has become one of our newest and most valued cultural institutions, self-coherence is now dependent upon self-display. We

know ourselves best, we feel most whole and put together, when we

broadcast the events of our lives to the world as they happen. The acknowledgment of our words and actions by a receptive other (how

many likes, how many followers) helps us hold on to who we are, and

makes us feel relevant and coherent. The development of self-

awareness, a common goal of nearly all forms of psychotherapy, takes

root now in how we are seen, known, and approved of by others in

virtual space. This poses a challenge to the psychological conception

of identity as a matter of inner depth. How does psychotherapy reconceive its own task under these new and changing circumstances?

[**2 Digital narcissism**](#index_split_000.html_p12)

While contemporary digital practices seem to be ushering in a distinct

conception of a self that casts aside its own interiority in the name of

collective recognition, we return again to our working assumption

that the concepts of depth psychology have a unique contribution to

make. Undoubtedly, given all that we have just laid out, this is quite

paradoxical. On the one hand, the digital age is forging a new con-

ception of selfhood that fundamentally deconstructs the privacy and

interiority of the depth psychological self. And yet, on the other hand,

these very same psychological notions about the nature of selfhood

that the digital so powerfully challenges, can also shed a revealing light on the unconscious complexes that haunt it. For instance, the

concept of narcissism, which is so central to the psychoanalytic dis-

course, powerfully illuminates how the digital is structuring the

contemporary psyche. Technology and narcissism are inextricably

bound. Technology feeds our narcissism just as much as narcissism

drives our uses of technology. Still, the very suggestion that technology may be unwittingly fostering a new kind of narcissistic omnipotence makes us recoil, as does the idea that the technological impulse itself is inherently narcissistic.

Healthy and pathological narcissism are generally distinguished by

psychoanalysis. Healthy narcissism is the basis for personal agency

[]{#index_split_003.html_p138} *The virtual within* 119

and autonomy, that internally generated sense of positive self-regard

that allows us to take action in the world with resolve and confidence.

Pathological narcissism, in contrast, traps us in a self-aggrandizing bubble that constantly needs mirroring reinforcement from the outside, cutting us off from any authentic contact with the other [(Kohut,](#index_split_001.html_p59)

[1971).](#index_split_001.html_p59) In attempting to clearly and cleanly distinguish one form of narcissism from the other, our psychological theories are vulnerable

to over-simplifying what is a decidedly complex and confounding

phenomenon.

In popular culture, narcissism has become our default lens for

making judgements about the words, actions, and character of those

close to us and those in public life. When we call someone "narcissistic," the language surrounding these judgements often takes on a

one-dimensional and overly moralistic tone. For example, by com-

menting on someone's unbridled grandiosity and exhibitionism, we

take them down a notch. We accuse our most intimate partners of

being narcissistic when they do something that we perceive as being

selfish, something that counters our own self-interest. We use it to wound the other, forcing them to once again pay attention to us and

our own narcissistic needs. But we also use it to praise a certain kind of

self-confidence and fruitful hubris that we respect and celebrate --

"She's narcissistic, for sure, but at least she goes for what she wants."

The word is thrown back and forth, like an exchange of daggers: self-

absorbed and impervious, yes, but highly magnetic and effective. It is

an endless and vexing see-saw.

With equally sweeping pronouncements of praise or damnation,

depending upon which side is up and which down, this same kind of

see-sawing effect occurs in how we talk about the digital. If we listen

closely to the many claims that are made about its redemptive or destructive qualities, we hear tones and inflections that evoke the discourse on narcissism: Is the inflation brought about by the digital

revolution a positive, life-affirming type, or does it also need to be taken down a notch in order to come to terms with something beyond

it? Technology extends the reaches of the self, feeds its generative expansion, and offers it a unique platform at the center of the action.

And yet, at the same time, nothing inflames the narcissistic impulse

more than a smartphone in one's hand or a computer on one's lap.

And when we are fully absorbed inside that mini-universe of the self,

there stands, outside of us, the narcissistically wounded friend we have abandoned, imploring, "Why did you leave? Why aren't you

placing me at the center of your attention rather than your device?"

In both cases, thwarted or realized, narcissism is infused in every as-

pect of our digital lives. We must confront this narcissistic dynamic

that is always there running behind the scene if we are to truly come

to terms with the paradoxical effects of technology upon the psyche.

[]{#index_split_003.html_p139}120 *Depth psychology in the digital age*

Narcissism is perhaps the most vulnerable feature of the human

soul. It is the place from which we first begin to love, and thus it holds

our most primary wounds and greatest ambivalences. There is no

avoiding the fact that there is a narcissistic investment, very often concealed, in nearly everything that occupies our mind. By dint of having a desiring self, narcissism always has us in its grips. But, as

[Derrida (1995b)](#index_split_001.html_p58) explains, there are different ways of being gripped by it:

There is not narcissism and non-narcissism; there are narcissisms

that are more or less comprehensive, generous, open, extended.

What is called non-narcissism is in general but the economy of a

much more welcoming and hospitable narcissism, one that is

much more open to the experience of the other as other. (p. 199)

He goes on:

I believe that without a movement of narcissistic reappropriation

the relation to the other would be absolutely destroyed \[...\] The

relation to the other, even if it remains asymmetrical and open,

must trace a movement of reappropriation in the image of oneself

for love to be possible. Love is narcissistic. (p. 199)

Through this idea that love itself is narcissistic, Derrida is emphasizing

a fundamental ambiguity in the relation to the other. Or, in slightly

different terms, he is emphasizing the inherent and enduring conflict

between our self-interest and our investment in the well-being of the

other [(Slavin and Kriegman, 1992).](#index_split_002.html_p109)

The myth of Narcissus, a core image for depth psychology, contains

within itself all of the rich and evocative complexity that we have been discussing. The beautiful young man, leaning over the pond,

enraptured by the sight of his own reflection, suggests at least two very different readings. The view of classical psychoanalysis contends

that what we are witnessing here in its purest form is an image of self-

love: a solipsistic absorption in a beautifully magnified reflection of the self at the expense of one's investment in the other. In the myth,

this other is portrayed by the figure of Echo, who is in love with Narcissus, but has to come to terms with how his self-absorption

makes him unresponsive to her love. This self-absorption accords with

[Freud's (1914)](#index_split_001.html_p59) vision of "primary narcissism," inherent to early infantile life: A baby, at the very earliest beginnings, finds itself in a state of nearly totalizing self-satisfaction that has no need for an other.

[Hillman (1983)](#index_split_001.html_p59) offers a second reading: "Narcissus leans out and over and into the image; he is not wrapped up in his own feelings, his

own self. He has forgotten himself, subjectivism completely gone, no

[]{#index_split_003.html_p140} *The virtual within* 121

narcissism whatsoever! The image fills consciousness and his desire"

(p. 182). For Hillman, Narcissus is an exemplar of the imagination as

an a-subjective, autonomous dimension of psychic life. Lou Andreas-

Salomé, a neglected yet important early follower of Freud, drives this

point home by pointing out that what Narcissus is really enraptured

by is not his own image, but the world reflected back in the pond.

Narcissus \[...\] looked not into a man-made mirror but into a forest

pool, the mirror of nature, so that what he saw was not just his

own face, but his face in union with the outer and boundless

world of nature. That union, that entirety was what he was in love

with. [(Livingstone, 1984,](#index_split_001.html_p59) p. 185)

Narcissus falls in love with the world; in peering through the self, he

experiences union with what is outside of himself. This second

reading offers a very different way of envisioning the narcissism at the

core of love, supplanting the inwardly turned love of the solipsistic self with a love that opens toward the beauty of the world. Rather than manifesting a frenetic desire to stamp itself everywhere, this is a

narcissism that supplants its own face with the face of nature, an image that speaks to the dissolution of the self into "the outer and boundless world of nature." As Hillman says, "subjectivism completely gone." Narcissism is thus transformed in its encounter with its opposite, the a-subjective, which lies outside the mind and its constructions.

In light of this second reading, we can see how digital narcissism, in

connecting with so many people in so many ways, encourages an

existentially expansive opening of the self toward the world, a more

welcome and hospitable stance toward "the other as other." However,

it can also galvanize us to turn back on ourselves, in ceaseless self-absorption, blocking out the world. In the demanding speed and

buzzing confusion that make slowness and quiet reflection impossible

in the digital, we are barely conscious of these opposing forces.

Think about how this tension collapses when our relationship to a

digital device is challenged: For instance, how, when we are asked to

justify the amount of time we spend online, or on our phones, or playing video games, we deflect and mis-direct, anything to divert the

charge, refusing to acknowledge them as the narcissistic objects that

they have become for us.

We are very vulnerable to becoming completely absorbed in them,

often at the expense of our more immediate connection to what is occurring around us. A well of shame is opened up when this self-absorption is censored by the other. In our own wounded narcissism --

the profound lack at the core of our being -- that we seek to hide from

ourselves and keep hidden from others, we cannot bear to

[]{#index_split_003.html_p141}122 *Depth psychology in the digital age*

acknowledge the pleasure we take in our gadgets. The digital helps us

ward off the lack by ceaselessly inflating the narcissistically delighted self.

The psychological origins of this lack are the love, understanding,

and care that we desperately needed when young, but could never get

enough of. The creative potential for love and attachment to help us

contain this lack has its own conflicted history, rooted in one's earliest

emotional experience. In its most extreme and pathological forms, it

becomes a narcissism whose only mode for bearing its own lack is through the exploitation of the other. Unable to love, it becomes a malignant narcissism.

[Heidegger (1996)](#index_split_001.html_p59) takes it one step further by speaking of an ontological lack, the nullity of existence, that haunts us all our lives, evoking an existential shame we all feel for having a null void at the

center of our being: the shame, in other words, of being mortal.

Weaving together this psychological and ontological shame in

whatever ways we can (conceptually, emotionally, experientially)

enables us to see inside each of us the workings of these twisting poles

of shame as they wind their path through the maze of digital life. Why

are we so stubbornly defensive about our digital practices? What are

we most afraid of having exposed?

Well, one way to put it would be to say: We cannot ever truly come

to terms with the fact that in our desperation for the enhancement of

self, and the emboldenment of our narcissistic drives that forms the basis of the digital impulse, there lies a shameful act of recovery, an attempt to obtain the love that has always eluded us by using the digital to fill in lack and loss and gap. We cannot bear to see, operating

behind the scenes, the hidden promise to repair our broken narcissism.

As an answer to the powerful yearning of restoring what has been

traumatized, abandoned, and left behind, the digital blends together

self-importance, omnipotence, and a feeling of union with the world.

In other words, the digital enacts a powerful unconscious fantasy that

we can become whole again, and that what was lost in the potential

fullness of ourselves can now be regained.

This deeply buried narcissistic wound is at the core of what could be

called the digital unconscious. Each of us, in our own particular and idiomatic ways, are driven to exploit the digital, where our insatiable hunger can eventually lead to a virtual life that lacks "nothing." Beyond

simply being defensive about our attachment to our gadgets, there is a

nearly involuntary resistance to reflect upon the origins of our digital narcissism. We know so well from psychoanalysis how the unconscious

resists exposure, so it is not surprising how very arduous, even agonizing, it can be to examine our libidinized narcissism and its hidden investments. We just want to indulge in our devices and be left alone.

[]{#index_split_003.html_p142} *The virtual within* 123

[**3 Digital illusion and the virtual-real**](#index_split_000.html_p12)

Psychoanalysis offers a unique vision of the psyche as an intricate yet

ultimately indeterminable dance of polarities. For example, desire and

sexuality, as a fundamental source that animates psychic life, en-

compasses an astonishing mixture of opposing tensions: love and

hate, tenderness and aggression, intimacy and distance. Freud's con-

ception of how these polarities structure our lives helps us to under-

stand not only how human behavior is driven by unconscious forces,

but also the staggering degree of self-deception that goes on in the mind when it comes to understanding why we do the things we do.

Psychoanalysis as a practice involves learning how to live amidst these

tensions, how to contain them well enough within oneself so that one

can continue to stay in an open relationship with the world.

Keeping in mind these key features of psychoanalysis, we want to

push further the dialogue between depth psychology and digital vir-

tuality by way of Freud's (1974) "Two Principles of Mental

Functioning." The Pleasure and Reality Principles describe a primary

tension between the instinctual drive for pleasure and the impulse toward immediate gratification, on the one hand, and the facts of reality that demand a necessary delay of gratification, where we have

to face, rather than disavow, reality, on the other. Our ceaseless search

for pleasure is always bumping up against the exigencies and obstacles

of a world that does not simply bend to our wishes.

In order to realize the full force of what is at stake in these two opposing principles, it is necessary to move away from the attempts

to bind the primal energy of the psyche into normative paths of

progressive growth and development -- what [Bersani (1986,](#index_split_001.html_p58) p. 112) calls "the teleological thrust" in Freud's theories. But, remarkably enough, alongside his theoretical attempts to funnel desire into socially respectable and normalized channels, there is a counter-

narrative in Freud's writing that acknowledges the non-teleological

a-directionality and ungovernability of desire. This bifurcation in

Freud strongly parallels the dynamics we have already seen, between

the Platonic move to ground the simulacrum in representational

structures and the Deleuzian approach that leaves it unmoored, open

to its own vital movements. Following this spirit in Freud's work, we

intend to stay closer to the latter Deleuzian approach in our continuing exploration of the virtual within.

This move echoes the important broadening of classical psycho-

analytic theory into the rich post-Freudian literature, where the opposition between pleasure and reality is transformed into an outwardly expanding set of lively dialectics, as, for example, the creative tension between the internal (object relational) world of psychic reality and the

external demands of communal, intersubjective life. This broadening

[]{#index_split_003.html_p143}124 *Depth psychology in the digital age*

also happens in continental philosophy, as the dualisms of inner and outer reality, as well as mind and body, are fundamentally deconstructed. We see this particularly in the Deleuzian ontology of immanence, which aims to do away with the traditional splitting of self and world. As we proceed, we will use these ideas to help us draw out the

implicit ontological and existential registers embedded in Freud's work

that will become useful for our on-going exploration of virtual life.

A common feature that runs from Freud to the post-Freudians to

these contemporary philosophical discourses is the assumption that

the play of illusion and reality (virtual and real) ontologically struc-

tures our psychic lives. We cannot bear too much reality, so we turn to

illusion as a creative shield, protecting us from that which is unbearable. But when our inner resources are exclusively devoted to

keeping reality out, and we are left without the capacity to process psychic events (and thus make the unbearable bearable), that shield is

unwittingly transformed into a fortress, and our illusions become

calcified, numbing us to the sense of our own aliveness.

A primary function of psychoanalysis, and perhaps implicitly of all

forms of therapy, is to help a person move beyond the traumatic (and

the neurotic) in order to facilitate new ways of organizing the self so

that it can both bear and be enlivened by the suffering from our en-

counters with the primary oppositions of life and death, fantasy and

reality, virtual and real. Psychic destructiveness and psychic emergence stand in a dynamic tension with one another. When the drives

are wholly unbound, a person is subject to psychological destruction.

Early trauma, for instance, can be seen as premature exposure to an

overwhelming drive energy that causes the psyche to split and turn

against itself for the sake of self-protection [(Kalsched, 1996).](#index_split_001.html_p59) But something destructive also happens when the drives are too tightly bound, as when so vigilantly defending against them one is cut off from the creative potential of one's own life force. In the encounter

with what is "other," therefore, the psyche can either be creatively transformed or destructively overwhelmed.

Between creativity and destructiveness, illusion is an essential

mediator. As Stephen [Mitchell (1988)](#index_split_001.html_p59) points out, illusion, which he describes as the overvaluation or idealization of a person, a thing, or

an experience, can be seen in two contrary ways. When the experience of something becoming larger than life, vitally important and compelling, is used to conceal or disavow some aspect of reality that

we have failed to come to terms with, illusion becomes defense, an attempt to escape the real. The view of the virtual as an upgrade of the

real would be an example. We seek comfort in its offer of a cleaned-up,

perfected reality, because reality itself is too harsh to bear. By bringing the things of the world so close in that they feel alive, compelling, and

important, the digital fuels this over-idealization of experience. But

[]{#index_split_003.html_p144} *The virtual within* 125

this can easily veer in a pathological direction, especially when it hooks our narcissism. In order to maintain its illusion of omnipotence, the all-important self needs to ward off an awful lot of the world that does not fit into its idealized image of itself. It's easy to see, then, how these new opportunities to simulate reality unconsciously

compel us to steer our virtualities toward what we want and who we

think we are.

When the virtual is not seen as opposed to the real but inseparable and

always embedded in it, our view shifts. The virtual becomes a life-potentiating wellspring for our creative response to the world, allowing

us to embrace it in its full dimensionality. In being able to temporarily

escape the heaviness of material and psychological reality, illusion allows us to play and can become the growing edge of how we come to know

ourselves. The digital virtual is a prime example of how we deepen our

experience of the real through creative illusion. The networked connectivity that surrounds us everywhere fills us with possibilities that bring an almost magical aura to ordinary life.

But it is this very "magic" that is in question as we consider that the

digital is the greatest fabricator of illusion that has ever been created. It can make us believe, body and soul, that we are living in one kind of reality that can stand in absolute contradiction to our actual life circumstances. The homeless man sitting on a city bench staring into his

smartphone (an image not uncommon today in a large metropolis),

dreaming that he is living a very different life becomes a poignant me-

taphor for this condition. Every time we log on and start clicking we enact that dream. What in actual life can only be one way, in the virtual

can be any way. But how is that trick performed, and how does it differ

from our ordinary experience of imagination, daydreaming, and fantasy?

What is "illusory" about the digital-virtual is that it seduces us into

believing that we are experiencing something real, not virtual; the very same illusion that underlies our conviction that we are awake when dreaming. The virtual-real entices us with the promise that we

can have all the real we want, always ready and at our disposal.

Because of our vulnerability to self-deception, we can trick ourselves

into believing that we are indeed experiencing something real when

in fact we are, on the contrary, desperately resisting it. It can draw us

into that rapture of self-absorption, into what can become, un-

checked, a trance-like state. Oliver [Sacks (2019),](#index_split_002.html_p109) mourning for an era that is apparently being left behind, describes what has become a common contemporary scene that exemplifies the ubiquity of this

enthrallment:

I cannot get used to seeing myriads of people in the street peering

into little boxes or holding them in front of their faces, walking

blithely in the path of moving traffic, totally out of touch with

[]{#index_split_003.html_p145}126 *Depth psychology in the digital age*

their surroundings. I am most alarmed by such distraction and

inattention when I see young parents staring at their cell phones

and ignoring their own babies as they walk or wheel them

along. (p. 28)

Whereas fantasy or the creative immersion in illusion used to be held

in check, it is now becoming unbound. The permanent accessibility of

the virtual-real is making whatever was outside limiting it, irrelevant.

Its enticements are dramatically restructuring our relationship to the

phantasmatic dimensions of psychic life that Freud called primary

process. This free-flowing, always on-tap, digitally-generated virtuality

is a new presence on the world stage that in its very occurrence conceals our relationship to those other sources of virtuality that have

nothing to do with digital realities. Today, we can have as much of it

as we want, with little risk or exposure. The massive outpouring of virtual-real is bedeviling human virtuality. Something fundamental

about our desire is changing.

The digital age, in a very short span of time, has created astonishing innovations in our most bedrock cultural institutions: poli-

tics, media, education, economics, to say nothing of child-rearing, dating, sexuality, consumerism, and our everyday experience of

human (and non-human) relationality. The illusion of the virtual-

real potentiates life as it bolsters the self. But, at the very same time,

it holds within it the promise of an endlessness that has the potential

to carry us away into a frenzied state. We can only continue to partake of its riches by fundamentally disavowing key aspects of

material and psychic reality. The Hikikomori who cease to bathe, eat,

and drink until they literally fall over, exemplify this disavowal. The

virtual-real satiates a profound hunger for more intensity, more life,

while at the same time leaving unaddressed the demands of our

bodily existence.

How much illusion is necessary to make bearable the undeniably

painful dimensions of existence? In the recesses between pleasure and

reality, the virtual-real creates a space where our most primordial desires can manifest themselves in a medium that transforms mind-fantasies into virtual immediacies. What is conjured up from the re-

cesses of the psyche is virtually presented to us as real, in unlimited

supply, at whatever intensity we choose. But the central issue (and this refers as well to the implicit question of narcissism, which remains lurking in the background) is whether having such immediate

access to all the virtual-real we want tips the scales (in either direction), thereby collapsing a necessary tension between these two

sides of illusion, defensive or creative, narrowing or expanding life, which touches the very core of who we are psychologically and

ontologically.

[]{#index_split_003.html_p146} *The virtual within* 127

In the spirit of "pharmacological" thinking, we want to hold our

discourse open to both sides of the ledger: There is something about

the phantasmatic nature of the virtual-real that is creative and enlivening and furthers our capacity for imaginative living. And there is

at the very same time a strong unconscious pull to use it to block out

what we refuse to bear.

The core Freudian tension between pleasure and reality can be read

existentially, as the distinction between subjectivity and world occurrence, i.e. what happens in our mind as opposed to what happens

in the world. The mini-universe that arises from the virtual-real is limited by the ontological reality of our everyday life-world. [Scott](#index_split_002.html_p109)

[(1999)](#index_split_002.html_p109) suggests that it is the very eventfulness of human embodiment that sets these limits, when he writes:

There is something not at all virtual in the inexorability of a

singular event \[....\] It is "real," we are inclined to say, not

imagined at all, quite beyond the reach of the perceptions that

grasp it, imagine it, and name it. There is much that is not virtual

in a child's sickness, a realization that brings many new parents

out of a cloud of romanticism and imagination when they see

that their child, burning with fever, can die. Not virtual, real. It is

one thing to see a car wreck on film. It is quite another to be in a

wreck, to feel the shock of the accident, the impact, the radical

movements, out of control, twisting and rolling with you tossed

and thrown in them \[...\] I knew a 13-year-old boy who ran a very

painful first marathon. Afterwards he said, "I always thought that

in the movies, if I were the guy on the ground, wounded,

reaching for the gun, that I would do it. I would move two

inches more, get the gun, and shoot the other guy. Out there I

got to where I couldn't move any more than I was moving. I

thought I was going to die. I tried, but I couldn't do any more.

You know, you reach a point and you can't go farther." The

nonvirtual reality of limits. (p. 189)

The extraordinary access we have to the virtual-real, in its fluid capacity for infinite transformation, shields us from the unyielding

nature of life events. As it becomes so seamlessly assimilated into the

texture of everyday life, our awareness of how much of the real we are

allowing to be replaced by the virtual-real is slowly eroding. When our

technologies provide too much assistance in holding at bay what is unbearable in the real, and, at the same time, give us such immediate

access to its vitality, we become unable to use our own imaginative capacities to bring to life the things of the world. It's easy to imagine

us soon walking around with our VR headsets, immersed in virtual

reality, increasingly numb to those moments in everyday life that

[]{#index_split_003.html_p147}128 *Depth psychology in the digital age*

Scott calls the "nonvirtual reality of limits," like sadness, boredom, loneliness, and emptiness.

Yet what from one perspective appears to be withdrawal and es-

capism, warding off the hard realities of material life, may, from an-

other, be seen as a liberation from the rigidity of culture. Our new and

emerging virtualities can expand and deepen our experience of the

concrete world, and change our attitude toward non-human others;

they can unshackle our erotic energies, and deconstruct the binaries of

gender and sexual orientation. What emerges is an ethos of multi-

plicities that are no longer ruled by or originate from a central struc-

ture -- an overturning of the Law of the Father, an overcoming of sexual difference.

Trauma often entails a premature exposure to psychic and/or phy-

sical impingements, where the ego is overwhelmed by the aftershocks

of severe loss, abuse, and bodily disintegration. This causes a breakdown of the capacity to metabolize psychic pain [(Bion, 1983; Ferro,](#index_split_001.html_p58)

[2007).](#index_split_001.html_p58) Because unguarded exposure to life's contingencies has the potential to unconsciously re-invoke the traumatic experience, the victim

of trauma must live a restricted existence. What results is the "frozen"

child who is unable to play, or the adult survivor who cannot bear anything that hints of the unpredictable and unknown, and thus is cut

off from the spontaneity of psychic life and its richness.

Now let us imagine what it would be like for a traumatized person to

have a certain amount of control in a medium where the play of illu-

sion and imagination can be enjoyed, relatively safe from the im-

pingement of others. The experience of omnipotence without limits,

pleasure that transcends the boundaries of the real -- all features of life

online -- creates a potential space for psychic exploration of tremendous

promise for recovering what has been foreclosed by one's develop-

mental traumas. The virtual-real helps repair the damage done to the

virtual within, by offering "safe play" for the enactment of fantasy and

desire, helping to generate the building blocks of a psychic capacity that may never have had the chance to be borne.

Young people nowadays take for granted the relatively "safe play"

made available by the virtual. There they engage in psychic explora-

tions that are dynamically open to the currents of the imaginative psyche that flow in sexuality, friendship, video games, art, music, fashion, and more. There is an immediacy of connection and a vibrancy of communication in those spaces, an "instant of sheer youth,

an order where everything is pending, where what is no longer pos-

sible historically remains always possible" [(Scott, 1999,](#index_split_002.html_p109) p. 231). The virtual-real thus becomes an ahistorical moment of pure possibility.

The instant of sheer youth made possible by the virtual suggests

that the digital age instantiates a puer psychology, where the experi-

ence of "now" is given supreme value. Always seeking, always

[]{#index_split_003.html_p148} *The virtual within* 129

wanting, always chasing after the new that lurks just ahead, life is lived in an unceasing quest for the unattainable. The *Puer Aeternus* of Greek Mythology gives us an image of this high-flying youth, who, longing for the unattainable, seeks to escape the grounding limits of

reality:

Phaethon, Apollo's son, tries to drive his father's Sun-chariot

straight up in the sky. Icarus, in his desperation to escape the starry-eyed bull at the center of Minos' labyrinth flies upward

toward the sun on waxen wings constructed by his father. Both

figures fall to their death on a reverse traversal toward the earth.

Vertical flight and free falling characterize this aspect of the puer

spirit. [(Frankel, 1998,](#index_split_001.html_p59) p. 183)

The puer-like dimension of digitality inevitably evokes its opposite, the senex -- the low and leaden-footed old man or woman -- that

signifies the dramatic descent that forcefully grounds it.

With the ever-present possibility of the virtual-real, one never lands

anywhere definitively, everything stays open ... until the inevitable fall. From the senex perspective, being always up in the air, open to

every and all possibility, is nothing other than an avoidance of ma-

terial life, superficially skimming its surface. Here we find ourselves swept up again in yet another instance of the paradoxical dichotomy

embedded in our technological discourse, although this time in the

image of the puer-senex. [Hillman (1998)](#index_split_001.html_p59) and [López-Pedraza (1990)](#index_split_001.html_p59)

have written convincingly of the tremendous psychological work in-

volved in not polarizing these two figures. We are contending that the

permanent availability of the virtual-real that flows from the digital,

in its turbulent extremes of wide-eyed optimism and dark pessimism,

embody that very polarization, a splitting of two vital life orientations, that are in desperate need of a pharmacological intervention: learning to stand in-between the sprint toward the future and the new, on the one hand, and the slow walk backward into the past and

the old, on the other.

[**4 Digital virtuality and the pleasure principle**](#index_split_000.html_p12)

The digital challenges the assumption that pleasure, fantasy, and illusion need to be firmly bound in order to adequately heed the call of

the real. As an agent of unbinding, digital virtuality releases us from

the stultifying binaries that repress non-normative desires and or-

ientations. With this incredible liberation of desire, imagination, and

a newfound fluidity in our sexual lives, there stands Freud, in full senex regalia, declaring that the digital virtual is nothing other than

the adult re-creation of the pleasure principle inherent to early,

[]{#index_split_003.html_p149}130 *Depth psychology in the digital age*

infantile life. Were he around today, Freud might describe the

Internet as a narcissistically regressive device -- a wish-granting machine, as it were, in its hallucinatory-like ability to bring to life the object of our desire. Indeed, the transformational malleability of the

virtual eerily echoes the primary process world, where wishes are in-

stantaneously gratified without the need of a real "other"; the virtual-

real condenses an entire scene into an extensionless point.

Just as the hungry baby hallucinates the milk-filled breast, the

virtual creates an immediate path from desire to its gratification, overriding the necessity of the circuitous path of secondary process --

Freud's *Umweg* -- where, in order to actually be fed, one has to emerge from the solipsistic world of wish-fulfillment and take into account the reality of an "other," separate from the self. In the mode of primary process, the infant is granted control over the breast. It is there

and then gone, but when mother leaves, the loss evoked by her ab-

sence is overcome: The breast is hallucinated back into presence. The

digital places in the hands of the ego that selfsame power to overcome

absence through the "virtual" re-creation of the object.

The hermeticism of the infant's world is ruptured when she has to

acknowledge the difference between her desire and its object, between

her subjectivity and the external world. Coming to terms with that gap is what ultimately delivers her from infantile fantasy into reality.

The digital provides a magical means to go back to the hermeticism

that existed before that acknowledgment. The virtual world and its objects, a repository of our desires and projections, returns us to the

psychic womb. Digital representation seals us off from the other,

re-creating the very solipsism of the infant.

Digital life, with its totalizing access to an infinite world of virtual

objects that are there, ready, at our immediate disposal, be they sexual, aesthetic, consumerist, or informational, is wholly bound up

with desire's lack at the heart of the pleasure principle. We are placed

in the same situation as the breast-hallucinating infant with one es-

sential difference: now these hallucinations are digitally materialized

in a virtual space that is public and collectively accessible. Wishes, which had before solely remained in the inner spaces of the mind, are

now made tangible as "objects" in the virtual world. Moreover, we have acquired experience that forces us now to deal with these new

virtual objects, not solely from the mute solipsism of infancy.

The role of pleasure and desire in our daily digital duties, though often unconscious, infuses them with sexual energies that represent

the primary investments of our affective lives. This hidden erotic sphere explains why, even in the midst of our most intimate relationships, we cannot wait to get back to the screen. When our ex-

periences with real others fail to give the right dose of pure pleasure

output, we rush to make contact with the virtual, where the eroticized

[]{#index_split_003.html_p150} *The virtual within* 131

omnipotence of self (a real "turn-on") can always be relied upon. We

are drawn away from what is before us as we long for what is there

waiting for us. The pure potentiality of the virtual is the source of this

powerful seduction, where fantasy and desire are activated through

the promise of seeing and thus "having" whatever it is that we want.

It's not that we love our digital devices more than, for example, our

children, or that what is happening there is more important than

what is happening around us. Rather, the bond that grows between us

and the digital overrides the bonds we have to empirical reality and

those closest and dearest. It is an attachment to a material object unlike any other. It's not like loving your car, even obsessively loving

it. Or loving your house or even your dog. A shockingly large quantity

of narcissistic-libido pours forth from our devices, carrying an electric-

like psychic charge that overcomes the tedium that we experience in

our everyday being. Take that away, and we are catastrophically faced

with a powerful shock of negativity that is caused by the return of the

repressed emptiness. Suddenly, and without warning, we stand on the

precipice of a lack that we no longer know how to deal with. This may

be why our digital devices have become as indispensable to us as, say,

our hands or our mouths. Once all our information is lost and our pocket-sized representational universe has vanished, we have the

feeling that something fundamental to our subjectivity has been

erased. One's machine crashes, and what has become an essential part

of the desiring self's experience is suddenly obliterated. The digital fills us up, overflows us with the dynamism of its hidden erotics, and when it ceases, our world is emptied and we are driven into a state of

panic.

Whether it be in the desperate compulsiveness of online shopping

or Internet pornography, or in our mindlessly surfing the web or

checking for the likes we have or the chats pending, the virtual pro-

vides us with the unceasing novelty of its offerings which is meant to

banish the void and transport us away to somewhere else. We are in

an endless quest to avoid desolate spaces, to reconnect with liveliness

and desire, to lose ourselves again and again in the erotic.

According to Plato in the *Symposium*, Eros is the child of the mythic couple *Poros* (plentifulness) and *Penia* (poverty). The digital is well-attuned to Poros, as it so effectively fills us up, but what happens to

our relationship with Penia, that sense of poverty that haunts our digital ministrations? If indeed the digital erodes our capacity for metabolizing emptiness, lack, and loss, then, paradoxically, the diminishment of that capacity increases the powerful seduction of the

digital's overflowing fullness. Penia is the gap between what we ima-

gine and what we get. She's the non-representable dimension of

language, which communicates despite its failure to communicate.

And most poignantly, she is the null center of subjectivity, that vast

[]{#index_split_003.html_p151}132 *Depth psychology in the digital age*

reservoir of nothingness out of which the self emerges. We keep

grasping for more virtual-real, using it as a glue to fill in the gaps of

reality, in order to forestall an encounter with Penia. The operations

of the digital-virtual covers over the gappiness inherent to our own occurrence. They bring precision, uniformity, and full presence. No holes. No empty space. Nothing to fall through.

At times, when we are really gripped by it, we want to be rid of anyone

or anything that stands in the way or interferes with our engrossment in

the digital. Think here of the fights that ensue at dinnertime or bedtime

when the exasperated parent is struggling to get a child or adolescent to

close down the game, put the phone away, shut off their iPad. Or when a

friend asks another to put down their phone and listen to what they are

saying. Or when we refuse the darkness of sleep and dream in the name

of the eternally illuminated screen, never to be extinguished or perhaps

not until that very last moment, just before we fall into sleep, the mo-

ment of our own self-extinguishment. And when we awaken in the

middle of the night, amidst the darkness of the dreaming self, we once

again crave its light.

Lacan tells us that love is giving what you don't have (i.e., giving to

the other what you lack). Thus in order to love, we have to come to

terms both with our own lack, as well as the lack in our beloved. So

what happens to that lack when our love lives are suffused with the

overflowing digital? On social media, we seek out love with the

strategy of Poros -- fires are lit, matches are made, and passions burn.

In searching for love on the Internet, we present the perfection of our

digital identity, which covers up all inadequacies and vulnerabilities.

Our attractions resonate with a digital fullness that conceals lack and

inverts the grammar of Eros.

[**5 Sexuality hyperrealized**](#index_split_000.html_p12)

The digital has brought about a dizzying expansion of the erotic

imagination, calling forth a vastly wider range of sexual possibilities

than ever before. In the age of Tinder, Grinder, Bumble, Match, and

the like and the numerous and diverse forms of cybersex, sex has become accessible in an entirely new way. Along a broad spectrum of

options -- from the digitally mediated partner behind a screen to the

digitally searched and sorted partner lying next to us -- we can have

what we want when we want it, with a single swipe. Sex in the digital

age is nearly instantaneous. No more waiting around. Deferral and

delay have all but been eliminated. We can have sex with our partners

in virtual space, and even with people over the Internet that we don't

ever have to meet in the real world.

By removing the many and varied obstacles between what we wish

for and what we can have, the virtual creates a hyperrealization of

[]{#index_split_003.html_p152} *The virtual within* 133

desire, often pushing us toward its omnipotent edge. Hyperreality

fuels the erotic charge of the sexual images and situations that unfold

before us. The digital register of sexual experience, the brilliant real-

ness of its image, its rapid change of angles, objects, and perspectives

and its capacity to zoom in and scrutinize, places before our very eyes

what was once only possible in art and imagination. As the digital brings pornography to its ultimate evolution, the greatest turn on may very well be hyperreality itself. The still photo culminates in the

porn videos of today, as the sharpness of the digital representation reveals the erotic right down to its most minute gradations, all now

captured in stunning high definition reality. Although pornographic

images date back to the earliest days of human history, with the ad-

vent of film there has been a progressive intensification of the erotic

imagination in barely a century. The digital makes the experience of

watching simulated sexual acts no longer a form of voyeuristic

vicariousness but real-time virtual interaction.

What we are witnessing today is nothing short of an erotic re-

volution. In this light, the digital can be seen as a dynamic force that

has lifted the cultural prohibitions and repressions that have tried to

regulate and normalize human sexuality. Today, everything is open

and available, freeing libido, liberating desire.

With its focus on unruly and disorderly drives that seek satisfaction

independent of their objects, Freud's *Three Essays on the Theory of* *Sexuality* reveals what in sexuality cannot be domesticated. As Bersani (in [Bersani and Phillips, 2008)](#index_split_001.html_p58) puts it, Freud articulates a sexual desire \[that is\] indifferent to personal identity, antagonistic

to ego requirements and regulations, and, following a famous

Freudian dictum, always engaged in group sex even when the

actual participants are limited to the two partners of the socially

approved couple. (p. 43)

This unbinding of Eros that occurs in Freud's original drafting of the

*Three Essays* parallels the hyperrealization of sexuality that is opened up by the virtual. When erotic fantasy becomes real through its actualization on the web, we can now see and experience whatever it is we

can dream up. The Internet maxim mysteriously referred to as Rule 34 states that "if you can imagine it, there is porn of it"; Now, whatever

sexual act we fantasize instantly materializes. We can get as close up to

the action as we wish or keep it safely distant, as is evidenced by the

increasingly common practice of couples and groups filming them-

selves while having sex (and often posting it for others to see). And increasingly, with the sophistication of virtual reality technologies, Internet pornography is becoming a three-dimensional immersive experience. The virtual actualizes what is truly polymorphously perverse

[]{#index_split_003.html_p153}134 *Depth psychology in the digital age*

in our nature, creating an inexhaustible combination of the sexual instinct's "source," "aim," and "object" [(Freud, 1905).](#index_split_001.html_p59) In enabling us to bypass the encounter with a separate other, the digital reinforces a turning away from the actual object, which is crucial to Freud's definition of sexual excitement. More and more of our erotic life takes place amidst digitally constituted, virtual objects that we can use at our

own discretion to give shape to the drive.

Breaking free of the analogical structuring that tethers the self to its

own unique history, the digital is an invitation to enter into one's own radical multiplicity. In virtual space, we are temporarily relieved

of the burden of having to hold ourselves together as a somewhat unified self in order to negotiate the vicissitudes of worldly experience. In this move from one to many, an affective intensity is ushered

in, making space for the many different dimensions of self that get little play or everyday recognition. In terms of one's erotic life, what

does not happen in ordinary social experience can happen in virtual

social space. We can say or see or enact anything we want, buttressed

by the anonymity and distance of the digital. Playing at different genders and sexualities, we are free to experiment with our identity

and desire in whichever directions it may take us.

Faced with the problem of the unruliness, disorder, and multiplicity

brought about by sexuality, we may choose, as Freud does, to see sexual repression as the compromise we make for an orderly, civilized

life. But the digital offers an alternative solution by creating a space

free from the constraints of the reality principle where we can realize

dimensions of our sexual drives that have no place in civilized society.

Our primitive desires, aggressive and erotic, which threaten social norms through the voyeuristic and exhibitionistic tendencies of

the self, for example, can now happen virtually, thereby preserving civilization, and perhaps even transforming it.

If the domestication of our sexual and aggressive drives is the price

we pay for civilization, is there any price to be paid when these very

same drives can live out a relatively undomesticated life in the virtual

world? The digital makes sexuality more fluid and accessible, opening

us to the expressive freedoms of an undomesticated Eros; however, if

there is a cost to these new freedoms, it may very well be a certain kind

of disconnection from everyday, embodied sexuality. Bionic sexuality

is rapidly advancing into the culture, as sex with love dolls and sex

with avatars becomes commonplace, and, just around the corner, sex

with robots [(Danaher and McArthur, 2017).](#index_split_001.html_p58) As [Knafo and Bosco](#index_split_001.html_p59)

[(2017)](#index_split_001.html_p59) point out:

The sex-doll industry is burgeoning, and high-end silicone love

dolls are being manufactured in the United States, Japan, and

Germany and sold briskly on the Web. There are even sex-doll

[]{#index_split_003.html_p154} *The virtual within* 135

brothels and escort services \[...\] David Levy, a well-known AI

expert, boldly claims that in less than 40 years, marriage to robots

will be legal in some states. (pp. 14--15)

Just a little over a decade ago, there were a couple of films that depicted the fictional occurrence of human sex-doll relationships [(Lars](#index_split_001.html_p59)

[and the Real Girl (2007), Kūki Ningyō (2009)).](#index_split_001.html_p59) Nowadays, these fictional stories have become real life occurrences, perhaps a little odd to

some, but unsurprising to many. Indeed, this new mode of sexual

behavior is becoming so normalized that it is not uncommon to find

that, for example, in his Instagram account, a Russian man is constantly posting photographs, videos, and commentaries about his love

life with a doll, rhapsodizing about her as an actual (human) lover. As

we increasingly rely upon a world of non-human objects to sustain our sexuality and begin to live out our primordial drives in the digital

world, we contemplate the prospect of a post-human future.

Another potential cost is just how addictive digital sexuality can become. The disembodied engagement and permanent availability of

unending erotic possibilities helps to explain this, as there is always

something new and exciting that promises more in the next click. It's

a way of dealing with desire and finding pleasure with little cost or emotional or psychic investment. The object of our desire appears

before us and engages us scopophilically, hyperactivating our fantasy

while our increasingly aroused body remains mute, passive, and in-

visibly participating. We can have the object we want as close as the

screen can bring it, but never beyond. The session eventually ends when it finds release, but only as the inexhaustible call of sexual possibility hyperactivates again the draw toward something new,

something not yet seen. Our desire is unable to penetrate the real. As

[Zizek (1997)](#index_split_003.html_p158) sees it:

My cyberspace sexual partner is...over-present, bombarding me

with the torrential flow of images and explicit statements of her

(or his) most secret fantasies. Or, to put it another way: \[the real

other\] is the cut of the Real, the traumatic obstacle, which again

and again unsettles the smooth run of my self-satisfying erotic

imagination, while cyberspace presents its exact opposite, a

frictionless flow of images and messages -- when I am immersed

in it, I, as it were, return to a symbiotic relationship with an Other

in which the deluge of semblances seems to abolish the dimen-

sion of the Real. (p. 156)

The intensification of sexuality, while unbinding and broadening

may, at the very same time diminish and flatten the erotic.

Hyperrealized sexuality intensifies things, makes them hotter, but at

[]{#index_split_003.html_p155}136 *Depth psychology in the digital age*

the same time may cause Eros, in his ineffability, to flee. Here, we bump up against the paradoxical ambivalence of the erotic, as it plays

itself out digitally.

The drive toward the cyber-realization of desire aggravates our relation to desire's lack. Because of the unending virtual availability of

what we most desire, that we can have as much of exactly what we

want, without interference, we are tricked by the seductive promise of

the erasure of lack, that desire can be truly and finally satisfied. We can't stop looking. We can't stop searching. We can't stop believing

that we will ultimately find the right combination of sounds and

images that will fully extinguish our desire. But in the end, we are entrapped by the masochistic search for the ever elusive object.

In *Being and Time*, [Heidegger (1996)](#index_split_001.html_p59) describes what happens when we make the world into a repository for our wishes:

Being-in-the-world whose world is primarily projected as a wish-

world has lost itself utterly in what is available, but in such a way

that in the light of what is wished for, what is available (all the

things at hand) is never enough. (p. 182)

In the episode of *Black Mirror* that we have already mentioned, "The Entire History of You," there is a scene that shows the husband and

wife, in bed, having sex. As the excited and passionate moments

subside, each partner uses the re-do button to stimulate themselves as

they approach climax by replaying the previously impassioned mo-

ments. It is not clear whether they are playing back what just happened or past fantasies with other lovers, but in that turning back toward a moment that has (just) passed, they become impassive and

disconnected from the living reality of each other's body, but sexually

stimulated by and fixated on their own representations.

Sex with a real other involves this back and forth movement be-

tween intersubjective sexual contact and interiorized fantasy, whether

we are imagining and remembering what just happened, or fanta-

sizing about a different lover, or different parts of someone else's body

altogether. The re-do button literalizes the virtualizing of sexuality in

the act of making love, something that is usually private and concealed. This scene thus stages the phantasmatic, virtual dimensions of

sexuality (i.e., the hallucinated, real/not real play that constitutes it).

But the scene also raises an important question about the effects of the

digital on sexuality. By providing an instantaneous replay of past sexual memory come to life, the self, clicking away at the re-do button, hyperrealizes fantasy. The sexual imagination is handed over

to the cyber-ego in the form of on-demand instant replay porno-

graphy. Even though the "real" other, the real relationship, is not

[]{#index_split_003.html_p156} *The virtual within* 137

completely eclipsed, it is displaced by this artificially intensified fantasy now made manifest as a virtual reality.

When the cyber-ego takes control of Eros, sex becomes an ever-

narrowing expression of what the ego wants. The digital brings in so

much of the agentic self and its strategies of perversion (which no doubt inflame sexuality), and thus becomes so tied up with narcissism, that the other is just out of reach, and the possibility for establishing a different kind of intensity -- more welcoming of the other

as other -- is elided.

Sex is one of our most forceful reminders that desire ultimately

flows from loss and lack. What is truly pornographic about the digital

is that it literalizes the wish for unending and unlimited satisfaction.

Who can resist its call to the enduring youthfulness of life? The compulsion to use the digital to solve the problem of lack in sexuality

is just one more instance of the same drive behind the use of our pocket sized machines to disavow lack in the world. If emptiness

evokes the negative, virtual life evokes its opposite. Mortal existence

itself is always pervaded by absence, darkness, and the passing away of

things. But we must reckon with what we are missing when our digital

lives are fueled by the promise to banish death and contingency, and

full presence becomes the order of the day.

[**Prelude**](#index_split_000.html_p12)

As we have indicated, although formulated in significantly different

concepts, the issue of the virtual (and its relation to the real) is paramount for psychoanalysis, in its elucidation of the complex and

dynamic tension between the inner world and outer reality. Pleasure

vs. reality, fantasy vs. trauma, transference vs. the real relationship,

are all expressions of this fundamental tension. In Lacan, it manifests in his tripartite division between the symbolic, the imaginary

and the real. The individual's growing capacity to differentiate the

virtual from the real, fantasy from reality, traces a progressive path

toward separation and individuation that we find in psychoanalytic

developmental theory from Freud to Winnicott to Klein to Bion.

In all of the many and varied guises in which psychoanalysis takes

up these issues, Winnicott's work is most profoundly oriented toward

the virtual dimensions of psychic life. He offers a developmental fra-

mework from which to understand its earliest origins in infancy as well as the continuing role it plays in child, adolescent and adult development. In our continuing effort to differentiate an existential-psychological virtuality from the virtuality that arises from digital technology, Winnicott is the perfect foil, for his writing and thinking

took place in the mid-20th century, an era that saw many significant

cultural and social changes, but one clearly preceding the changes brought about by the digital revolution. Not only does he provide us a

framework for understanding the developmental origins of human

virtuality, but, when held up against what is happening to the mind

in a 21st-century digital culture, his work shines a bright light on the

[]{#index_split_003.html_p160} *The virtual as potential space* 141

many effects, both positive and negative, that the digital is having on

this trajectory as it develops throughout the lifespan.

For Winnicott, psychic life is potentiated when fantasy and imagina-

tion make creative contact with the outer world. Such moments of po-

tentiation, when experience feels most alive and real, cannot be located

simply as wholly inside or outside. *Potential space* is his term for a third area of experience, an intermediate area in which this vital mode of psychological engagement takes place. It is the point of contact between

the inner world of fantasy, where things are fluid and idiosyncratic, and

the outer world of reality, where things appear to be fixed and

unchangeable. Potential space provides a dynamic scaffolding, "a resting-

place for the individual engaged in the perpetual human task of keeping

inner and outer reality separate, yet interrelated" (1971a, p. 2).

Potential space is an area of illusion, but this term is used in a positive sense to point to the place where things come creatively alive with meaning. If we think of potential space as possibility and emergence,

there is then an implicit link between what is potential in human life --

the mode of experience that occurs in potential space -- and the concept

of the virtual. Indeed, potentiality is the base definition of the virtual in philosophy, as we have already seen. As [Massumi (2014)](#index_split_004.html_p185) explains: What is in potentiality may come to be; and what has been,

already was in potential. The virtual must thus be understood as a

dimension of reality, not its illusionary opponent or artificial

overcoming. The virtual, as allied to potential, belongs specifically

to the formative dimensions of the real. It concerns the potency in

what is, by virtue of which it really comes to be. (p. 55)

[Winnicott's (1971a)](#index_split_004.html_p185) definition of potential space as an intermediate area of experience, "to which inner reality and external life both contribute" (p. 3) strikingly maps onto the dynamic tension between

the virtual and the real that has been the object of our [study.1](#index_split_004.html_p184) By exploring in what follows the dynamics of Winnicottian potential

space -- "this potency in what is, by virtue of which it really comes to

be" -- we are offered a unique pathway for differentiating the virtual as

a mode of potentiation inherent to virtual reality technologies from

a mode of potentiation belonging "specifically to the formative

dimensions of the real" [(Massumi, 2014,](#index_split_004.html_p185) p. 55).

A significant struggle for us as psychological beings (pre- and post-digital) is to find life-affirming ways to engage the many polarizing tensions that result from the virtual/real dichotomy. Fundamental to the

task of bearing the human condition is keeping inner and outer reality

separate yet intimately related, or, in other words, finding ways to creatively stand in these tensions. Yet, it is not always so easy to discover this "resting-place." Potential space is difficult to sustain and very

[]{#index_split_003.html_p161}142 *Depth psychology in the digital age*

vulnerable to collapse. We are prone to cutting off or ridding ourselves of one side or the other, eclipsing the scope of our experience in the world.

The possibility of losing or collapsing potential space in a digital age is what is at issue in this chapter. This resonates with the idea that we have been developing throughout the book that, paradoxically, there may be

an attenuation of the virtual in the age of digital virtuality. Yet, as always, we will try to stay open to both sides, and, as we will come to see, especially in our exploration of adolescence, the digital may also be creating new kinds of potential space, new forms of life, that uniquely

re-envision the encounter between the virtual and the real.

[**1 Three senses of the virtual**](#index_split_000.html_p12)

Because Winnicott was first and foremost a developmental theorist,

our method will be to examine three critical moments in his work with an eye toward what they reveal about the emergence and maturation of human virtuality. We will start from its earliest origins, in

the primary relationship between mother and infant, move to the

phase of transitional phenomena, when the infant begins to negotiate

the process of separation, and lastly turn to adolescence, when the whole question of virtuality comes to the fore again in surprisingly new and unfamiliar [ways.2](#index_split_004.html_p184) The question of the virtual will be explored against the backdrop of how, in each of these moments, an originary

contact with both the externality of the world and the otherness of

the psyche is accomplished by the evolving self. Three distinct, yet related aspects of virtuality arise in the context of these particular developmental moments that offer new insights into many of the

topics that we have touched upon up to this point.

The first sense of the Winnicottian virtual gives expression to how

the imagination (play, illusion and fantasy) aids the developing

psyche in mediating otherness and difference.

The mother, at the beginning, by an almost 100 percent adaptation

affords the infant the opportunity for the illusion that her breast is

part of the infant. It is, as it were, under the baby's magical control

\[...\] Omnipotence is nearly a fact of experience. (1971a, p. 11)

Here, the illusory aspects of the virtual are prominent, establishing the

earliest foundations of the mother-infant relationship. This "opportu-

nity for illusion" constitutes a nascent virtuality which grants the world

a high degree of malleability that accords with the wants and needs of

the baby. For example, "... there is opportunity for the feeling of one-

ness between two persons who are in fact two and not one" [(Winnicott,](#index_split_004.html_p185)

[1987a,](#index_split_004.html_p185) p. 7). The breast is not an object coming from the outside, but is experienced as part of the infant himself, engendering a foundational

[]{#index_split_003.html_p162} *The virtual as potential space* 143

sense of omnipotence. This essential link between omnipotence and

our nascent experience of virtuality will become central to our analysis

when we begin to explore the resonances between the baby's feeling of

having magical control over the breast and the ascendancy granted to

the self as a result of digital virtuality.

In modulating the relationship between illusion and reality, the

virtual keeps certain facts about the world at bay, thus granting the

infant time and space to grow. This modulation is best captured by

[Winnicott's (1987b)](#index_split_004.html_p185) deceptively simple phrase, "the world in small doses," which describes the necessity of protecting the vulnerable

infant from the psychic destruction that can happen when the world

rushes in too quickly. Being careful to safeguard the infant from those

aspects of the world that she is not ready to take in, aligns with a view

of early trauma as the premature intrusion of a world not given in small doses, but rather in large and traumatically overwhelming ones

that fracture the developing psyche. There is a fragility to self-world

relations in early development, and the self's inner implosion and collapse is the result of externality's premature impingement that

brings a tide of pathology in its wake. The virtual, in its capacity to

modulate reality through the "opportunity for illusion" provides a

sheltering function that helps to protect the infant from untimely exposure to the world.

Alongside this protective and mediating virtuality, we also find

Winnicott articulating that aspect of the virtual that imbues life with

psychological meaning and makes our experience in the world with

others feel real. It is the force underlying the potency and creativity of

the psyche. And indeed, for Winnicott, the very question of whether

or not life is experienced as being worth living centers on "whether

creativity is or is not part of an individual person's living experience"

[(Winnicott, 1986,](#index_split_004.html_p185) p. 39). He goes on to say:

Creativity is then the doing that arises out of being. It indicates

that he who is, is alive ... \[It\] is the retention throughout life of

something that belongs properly to infant experience: the ability

to create the world. (pp. 39--40)

Creative living, which Winnicott at this point wants to distinguish

from being artistically creative, involves an encounter with ex-

ternality that is lived out, experientially, on multiple psychic stages:

the dream stage, the fantasy stage, the stage of instinctual drives.

Each marks a larger psychic surround that envelops the self with its

own cast of characters, as the virtual makes it possible for the figures

of our inner psychic life and our actual objects -- those that we love

and depend on -- to live in an intimate, psychically animating

transference.

[]{#index_split_003.html_p163}144 *Depth psychology in the digital age*

A third sense of the virtual appears with Winnicott's contention that

there are private and hidden aspects of the self which do not accede to

representational knowing. In fact, not wanting them to be found at all, what is hidden in the self resists communicating and being

communicated with. This inner otherness evokes the unpredictable

and ungovernable arising of psychic life that seems to bypass human

intentionality all together; this non-personal force of emergence

permeating all experience accounts for the electrifying spark in the virtual, whose origins lie in something beyond human subjectivity.

And if there is one central message of the whole Winnicottian

oeuvre, it is this: We should not prematurely force upon these unformed, non-communicating dimensions of the psyche our need for

representational knowing. They should ultimately be respected and

left to be. Undoubtedly, one very important aspect of psychological

maturation involves learning how to allow the non-representable

aspects of our psychic lives to be available to us without having to be

made transparent and fully understood. The way, for instance, you

can let the images of the dream you wake up with remain present as

you move through your day without having to *know* what they mean.

Letting the unrepresentable stay unrepresentable yet still inform ex-

perience is no easy matter, and we infer it has something to do with

bearing that primary ontological tension that constitutes us.

A certain degree of emotional openness to uncertainty and in-

determinacy is required so that the unconscious can become a source

for enlivening experience and animating the world virtually. In this

view, Winnicott becomes a guide for potentiating our unconscious

life. To be in potential space is to be fed and nurtured by this unrepresentable undercurrent, allowing it to pulsate as something felt, yet still unknown, as one lives in the world as an active subject. The

collapse of potential space is the loss of access to that psychic other-

ness which we have been characterizing as our inner virtuality. For Winnicott, early environmental conditions, when *good enough*, allow

for emotional openness and so rightfully set the stage for releasing the

virtuality of the self into this world-potentiating force. But when conditions are not *good enough*, life becomes deadened, things no longer feel real, and we are forced to seek symbolic substitutes that ironically cause further restriction, barring access even more.

We might then see the allure of technological hyperreality as an

unconscious compensation for the collapse of potential space, the loss

of existential access to the potentiation of psychic reality. It's as if the digital takes charge of potential space and says to the self: "You can

now have this whenever and wherever you want. And though we

cannot exactly give you the feeling that comes with an internally generated virtuality in loving dialogue with the world, we offer the next best thing, a substitute mode of hyperreality that simulates its

[]{#index_split_003.html_p164} *The virtual as potential space* 145

immediacy as best it can. And if you stick with it long enough, you

will never miss the real."

This is illustrated by the recent attempt to aid a grieving mother in

South Korea whose daughter died of leukemia at the age of [7.3](#index_split_004.html_p184) Using new virtual reality technologies, an avatar of the child was created as a

composite of her digital photographs, the registration of the mother's

memories and the movements of a child actor. Donning a VR headset,

she was able to see and hear her daughter again, move with her in space as if she were still alive. In being able to bring the child back,

there is the hope that this mother can better work through her grief.

There she is again, alive and lively as she ever was, so the mother is

offered another chance of being with her, even talking to her in this

strange new ghostly medium. What kind of potential space is this? It's

as if the gap between life and death is being filled, holding at bay the

reality of loss, which remains only potential, through this spectral re-

encounter with the object.

We are only beginning to consider how this might affect, positively

or negatively, the process of mourning. The promise is that the virtual

representation will help the mother come to terms with the abrupt loss by lessening its finality. But we could imagine that it might instead (and here we are on very shaky ground) become an obstacle for

her working through her loss, as the avatar replaces the non-

representational depth of the real with a hyperreality that erases it.

This reveals yet another aspect of our digital dependency, where our

use of virtual technologies short-circuits the psyche's relation to the

non-representational, making us ever more reliant upon our simula-

tions to compensate for that loss. Winnicott's ideas serve as a gauge to

our growing digital addiction, reminding us that there is another way

of potentiating experience, dreaming reality into being. Can we see the Winnicottian virtual as a response and compensation for the

hyperreality of our time?

[**2 The psychological origins of virtuality**](#index_split_000.html_p12)

We have noted Freud's weariness of the omnipotence that char-

acterizes the infant at the breast, as he perilously retreats from the world of real objects to seek out the hallucinatory satisfaction of his

desire. The solipsistically self-satisfied infant at the *virtual* breast is a foundational image, for it reveals the invincibility of the pleasure principle in its precipitous dismissal of reality. In its hallucinatory re-creation of the real, the virtual offers a substitute satisfaction that

simulates "actual" satisfaction.

But one cannot dwell there too long. Sooner or later, the infant will

have to pull himself away from the virtual breast and seek a breast that

can offer "actual" nourishment. It is a matter of survival. But we also

[]{#index_split_003.html_p165}146 *Depth psychology in the digital age*

know that early developmental trauma can give rise to individuals

who adhere to their simulations at the expense of a *real* [life.4](#index_split_004.html_p184)

For Freud, the virtual is dangerous because its seductive charms

cause us to mistake illusion for reality. The self-enclosed Freudian infant has not yet turned toward a *real* other for satisfaction; he is trapped in the illusory belief that he can receive all the satisfaction he

needs from the virtual itself. In pointed contrast, Winnicott's focus is

on the interceding [m(other).5](#index_split_004.html_p184) Winnicott conceives of a different beginning, one that already presupposes her active presence in creating

a holding environment that enables the infant to actualize the experience that he has indeed created the world. "\[T\]he mother makes

her breast available (or the bottle) just as the baby is preparing to conjure up something, and then lets it disappear as the idea of it fades

from the baby's mind" (1987b, p. 73). Here, the inner imagination about what is most ardently desired (the breast in fantasy) meets up

with the actual breast that satisfies that desire.

\[T\]he breast is created by the infant over and over again out of the

infant's capacity to love or (one can say) out of need. A subjective

phenomenon develops in the baby, which we call the mother's

breast. The mother places the actual breast just there where the

infant is ready to create, and at the right moment. (1971a, p. 11)

This profound synchrony between a fantasy in the mind and its ac-

tualization in the world elucidates an originary or foundational experience of the virtual, where mind (that perplexing admixture of

fantasy, desire, and selfhood) and world temporarily fuse, and in that

emergent state, the distinction between self and other fades away. The

world comes alive as mind, and mind is embodied in the world.

In nine months the mother gives about a thousand feeds, and

look at all the other things she does with the same delicate

adaptation to exact needs. For the lucky infant the world starts off

behaving in such a way that it joins up with his imagination, and

so the world is woven into the texture of the imagination, and the

inner life of the baby is enriched with what is perceived in the external world. (1987b, pp. 73--74)

If things go well enough between mother and infant, this early experience of desire potentiating reality is woven into the subjective fabric of one's being. As an important counterpoint to the solipsism

of omnipotent hallucinatory satisfaction, Winnicott highlights

the thoroughly intersubjective nature of the origins of the virtual, challenging the overly restrictive lines Freud drew between psychic reality and the external world. Winnicott's virtual gives rise to a

[]{#index_split_003.html_p166} *The virtual as potential space* 147

self-expansive turn toward the experience of aliveness in relation to

objects that engenders the development of an inner psychic capacity

to amalgamate fantasy, desire, and imagination with the actuality of

the world.

In considering the earliest exchanges between infant and mother,

Winnicott is evoking a time when fantasy and reality are not yet differentiated, and the infant experiences a world that is wholly receptive to his innermost virtuality. In the abundant fullness of its ever-expansive, possibility-granting fluidity, the virtual gives shape and expression to the infant's dreams, thoughts, and desires. Thus, this first stage of Winnicott's developmental story finds the infant dreaming up the world without any question that it will reciprocate in

a total and all-embracing responsiveness.

Because there is someone else there offering her caring and protective

attention, the infant can safely venture in a non-defensive way toward

the aliveness of the world. The risk is being able to bear its open and fluid nature, its "cavalcade of emergence" [(Massumi, 2014,](#index_split_004.html_p185) p. 55) well enough to be transformed rather than damaged by it. Mother mitigates this risk

for the infant, as the therapist, in a parallel way, does for her patients.

Inside a therapeutic holding environment the patient can risk breaching

the self, turning toward its transformative possibilities; opening, in other words, to its inner virtuality, as it becomes, in the presence of another, a space safe enough again to engage [with.6](#index_split_004.html_p184)

Winnicott's work can be read as a testament to his continuing elu-

cidation of states of being in which these two distinct orders -- self and

world, inner and outer, reality and fantasy, body and mind -- can in-

terpenetrate one another, for it is in their overlapping points of contact

that virtuality is borne. Like our use of the word *psyche*, virtuality becomes the third term that bridges them, suggesting that the very mode

of the real that underlies Winnicottian potential space is an immanent

virtuality, which does not split self and world, but unifies them.

In our dreaming life, we return to this immanent virtuality, re-

connecting with a state of mind that parallels the infant's originary

act of dreaming up the world, as the sharp divisions between subjective and objective experience, self and other, fall away. But when

we awaken and begin to remember the dream, there is always some-

thing ineffable of the experience that cannot be recovered, that does

not return. The virtuality that infuses the dream is ungraspable,

slipping through our fingers the moment we try and pin it down.

The digital, in the full force of its technological potentiation, seeks to

simulate this originary virtuality, offering us a non-divided world that

is wholly receptive to our wishes and desires. Anything we conceive of

can be grasped there, the moment it comes into our mind.

For instance, let's imagine that when you are spending time with

your teenage daughter, a particularly stirring song from your past all

[]{#index_split_003.html_p167}148 *Depth psychology in the digital age*

of a sudden pops into your head. You are so excited to share it with

her that you impulsively rush to find it on YouTube, abruptly click the

link, and there it plays, just as you remembered it. The digital now allows you to potentiate, in a parent-child relational space, all of the

associations and fantasies you had while hearing that song as a teen-

ager, as you listen to it alongside your daughter as an adult. But when

she seems to be immune to the meaningfulness of the song, you

notice that something is awry. While you expected the vital memory

lodged in your mind to shift in the flash of a moment into an inter-

subjective event of the present, you suddenly realize that YouTube failed to translate the inner imagination you had of the song, without

which it loses its poignancy. Just as with the residues of the dream that we are left with upon awakening, it does not bring back that ungraspable quality of the past that made it so vibrant when you first

thought of it.

What contributes to the false hope that there could be such a

perfect transfer from the past to the present is the speed by which we

are able to actualize that fantasy. Its instantaneousness evokes the feeling of "\[t\]he mother plac\[ing\] the actual breast just there where

the infant is ready to create it, and at the right moment" [(Winnicott,](#index_split_004.html_p185)

[1971a,](#index_split_004.html_p185) p. 11). YouTube becomes the stand-in for the maternal function, for as it has become so adept at simulating that originary

desire-creating-the world moment, we expect things of it that it

cannot really provide.

The digital plays a bit of a trick on us, making us believe, for that

second, that there is no loss, that the time and context of my experience of that song (or person, or event) is not really in the past. In

the virtual everything that has passed is suddenly back in our grasp.

Nothing is lost to time. And as we enter into that aspect of the illusion, the ineffable is erased, just as with Benjamin's mechanical reproduction the aura is abolished from the work of art, and we become immune to its absence. Experience is, indeed, literally flattened,

for all depth (spatially and temporally) in our perception is lost.

"The digital society of transparency," Byung-Chul [Han (2018)](#index_split_004.html_p184) writes,

"de-auratizes and demystifies the world" (p. 7).

Yet, dwelling in the full presence of what has passed but now returns, in an immediate and graspable way, also opens up a psychic playground for self-exploration. We have detailed the many significant ways, therapeutically and otherwise, that these new virtual spaces offer unique and powerful opportunities for growth, self-expansion and healing. The illusory sense that nothing is actually lost

may be an important part of what contributes to the potentiating

power of that dynamic.

At the same time, we must acknowledge the regressive shadow that

haunts the speed and brilliance with which the digital recovers the

[]{#index_split_003.html_p168} *The virtual as potential space* 149

past. For in protecting us from exposure to certain essential, and here

we might say, non-virtual dimensions of experience -- especially those

dealing with loss and absence -- we become unpracticed in bearing

change and the passing away of things. If we return to the concept of

an immanent and embodied virtuality, a virtuality that comes alive in

its contact with the world, we must come to terms with the fact that

something is forsaken when that immanence is replaced by its digital

simulation (we might say, ironically, that the missing is missing). That

which cannot wholly be captured in simulated form, what Heidegger

calls "the worldliness of the world" or "the thingness of the thing" is

sacrificed.

We can now see further into the existential dimensions of this

virtual regression, for as more and more of our life is enchained to the

circuits and devices that constitute the everyday digital, there is a turning away from the world. Where virtual and real are locked in a

deadly opposition, the virtual kills the world, and in the end, we fall

in love with our simulations rather than with each other and certainly

no longer with the world.

There is a very human tendency to take asylum in the merger states

endemic to those earliest desire-creating-world moments, where the

innocence of the self meets up with the innocence of the world. This

is the very stuff that gives such poignant vibrancy to our dreams and

fantasies. Perhaps we are so taken in by Facebook because it emanates

a nostalgia for this originary condition. Our desire to (re)experience

that lost state of innocence (often an innocence that most of us never

got much of in the first place) pulls us further and deeper into the labyrinths of digital virtuality. A game like Second Life represents this

yearning to once again have at one's disposal a world that is relatively

free of risk and harm, one that wholly bends to the impulses of the

self. But there is concern, as we have seen, that a world without risk

has drawbacks of its own. Something grows there, and at the same time, something else cannot grow.

Our current digital practices tend to deny the fact that the kind of

merger state that was foundational for us as infants is no longer ger-

mane in the same way when we become adults. By losing sight of the

developmental vicissitudes of the virtual, we force it into serving our

own regressive psychological and emotional demands, using its po-

tentiating power to covertly recapture that originary virtuality. When

we place into the hands of the adult ego the means by which our wishes, in one fell swoop, can be turned into realities, we inevitably

invoke that hidden will to power that seeks to eradicate otherness, a

theme we will explore in the next chapter.

And let's remember here that for the Winnicottian infant, otherness

was not something that had to be expunged in order for the virtual to

emerge. Indeed, just the opposite. When otherness is fed to the infant

[]{#index_split_003.html_p169}150 *Depth psychology in the digital age*

in small enough doses by a sensitively attuned caretaker, he has access

to a non-disavowing virtuality. As Adam [Phillips (2019)](#index_split_004.html_p185) writes: In Winnicott's account we can only bare and enjoy the fact that

we didn't create the world as we wanted it to be after we gain the

conviction that we did create the world, and that it was as we

wanted it to be \[...\] The reality principle is only what Winnicott

calls an "insult" to the child if it impinges prematurely. (p. 37)

The virtual surround of the digital world, as it occurs for us today, is

not often fed in small doses. It becomes harder to protect ourselves, at

any stage of development, from its overpowering and often over-

whelming impingements that flood in and overtake the potential

space of an emergent self. The digital then takes advantage of the very

situation it helps to create with its injunction: "The only safe place left for you is inside here. Come on in, and shut the door behind you. Let

us join together and banish the world."

[**3 Virtuality and transitional phenomena**](#index_split_000.html_p12)

In his reading of Freud, [Lacan (1978)](#index_split_004.html_p185) envisions an unrecoverable gap at the center of subjectivity, resulting from the initial cut that severs

the unity of mother and infant. Our original connection, gone forever, creates a state of self-alienated and compulsive object-seeking that haunts our psychological lives. Lacan's account stands in marked

contrast to Winnicott's conception of transitional phenomena, which

envisions a very different way of bearing "the cut in the real" inevitable in the separation from mother.

As the infant develops and the mother no longer perfectly adapts to

his needs, a gap opens up between what is wanted and what actually

arrives, between desire and its fulfillment. As the infant is faced with a

space of difference between a "me" and a "not me," something is

needed to help him negotiate and bear this emerging gap. Transitional

phenomena mark the passage from being merged with mother to

being separate from her, when the infant turns to the outer world and

uses a transitional object, say a bit of a blanket or a soft toy, to help

bridge this difference. The separation that would have occurred between mother and baby does not actually occur. There is only

potential space between them, not actual space.

The transitional object is a creative solution to the original separa-

tion. The baby takes this bit of the emerging "not me" world that reminds him of mother, a particular touch object, one that is soft and

smells of her body and uses it in place of her. It carries the meaning of

that which is, yet is not mother and that which is, yet is not self.

Winnicott describes this paradoxical state of holding on and letting

[]{#index_split_003.html_p170} *The virtual as potential space* 151

go (to mother, to self) as a non-compliant resolution to the infant\'s

inevitable loss of omnipotence.

What ensues, then, with transitional phenomena is a whole new

dimension of the virtual based upon the creative deferral of the actual.

It gives rise to a potential space in which separation, loss, and the otherness of the world remain in potential form, while, at the same

time, there is contact with something real, an actual object. The tat-

tered blue blanket that must never be washed provides a "resting

place" in which an infant can gradually come to accept the reality of

an outside world that is not simply fashioned from his own mind, but

stands outside of it, with its own separate existence. "I am here staking

a claim for an intermediate state between a baby's inability and his growing ability to recognize and accept reality" [(Winnicott, 1971a,](#index_split_004.html_p185)

p\. 3). Or, to put it another way, transitional virtuality offers the de-

veloping child an original way of mediating the difference between his subjectivity and the occurrence of the world.

The importance of the material (technical) object in the constitu-

tion of human virtuality is something [Stiegler (2013) points out.](#index_split_004.html_p185) As

[Roberts (2007)](#index_split_004.html_p185) explains:

For Stiegler, philosophy is both founded on and founders on the

exteriorization of the human, or, as he calls it, 'technics.' Technics

encompasses everything from primitive tools through systems of

writing to modern telecommunications. For him, 'technics is the

condition of culture, and it would be absurd to oppose technics to

culture.' Technics, thus understood is not merely instrumental, a

means to an end, where the 'end' remains a resolutely human need

or desire. Rather technics shapes what it means to be human, and

the 'human' in this sense is constituted always already through

technics. Indeed, technics is the 'prosthesis of the human': the

human is constituted not by some interior capacity (e.g. conscious-

ness) but by a new prosthetic relationship with matter. (p. 26)

Stiegler finds strong resonance with Winnicott, for whom the transitional object demonstrates "the foundational role that material things

play in the generation of the child's psychic life" [(Russell, 2020,](#index_split_004.html_p185) p. 113).

As Russell continues:

\[R\]ather than being simply present at birth \[...\] object-relatedness

is the effect of the identity of the maternal object and the

technical (mechanical/processive) aspects of maternal practice.

This identity is what is re-encountered/repeated by the child in

the form of the transitional object (...) as something material that

can be absolutely manipulated but that is also experienced as

animated and mindful. (p. 114)

[]{#index_split_003.html_p171}152 *Depth psychology in the digital age*

What he means by the identity of the maternal object and the tech-

nical aspects of maternal practice is that the breast itself, as Winnicott

tell us, stands for the whole technique of mothering (feeding, holding,

soothing, etc.). Object relatedness is not a given, it is acquired through

the repetition of these practices.

Stiegler posits a transitional virtuality lying "beyond or beneath"

(p. 1) the actual object and startles us with the claim that:

The transitional object has a distinct virtue: *it does not exist.*

Certainly something exists that enables it to appear -- for example,

a teddy bear or cuddly toy. But what makes this teddy bear or

cuddly toy able to open up 'transitional' space \[...\] is that beyond

that part of the object that exists in external space \[...\] there holds

something that is precisely neither in exterior space, nor simply

internal to either the mother or the child. (our italics, p. 1)

This transitional virtuality is what reinforces the loving bond

between them:

What takes hold between the mother and child in not existing,

but in passing through the transitional object, and which there-

fore finds itself constituted by it, links and attaches them to one

another \[...\] through a relation of love \[...\] What holds and is

upheld as this link through which these two beings become

incommensurable and infinite for one another, is what, by

allowing a place for that which is infinite, consists precisely to the immeasurable extent that it does not exist -- because the only

things that exist are finite things (pp. 1--2).

When Stiegler speaks of allowing a place for that which does not ac-

tualize itself in the world as a finite object, "something that is precisely neither in exterior space, nor simply internal to either the mother or the child" (p. 1) he is evoking what we have been calling

the human virtual, that space of emergence where the pure potenti-

ality of "that which is infinite," comes to the fore as an animating and

life-vitalizing force. Here, it gives rise to the paradoxical situation in

which mother and child can differentiate themselves from one an-

other while at the same time being held together in loving union. The

virtual, "to the immeasurable extent that it does not exist" holds open

a space for the possible as opposed to the actual, an infinite realm that

disseminates the finite actuality of their relationship by opening to a

larger order of reality that underwrites them [both.7](#index_split_004.html_p184)

But the pivotal gesture that Stiegler finds in Winnicott, which has

such importance for how we think the technological, is that this very

[]{#index_split_003.html_p172} *The virtual as potential space* 153

opening to the infinite, to the possible, to the virtual, happens through a relationship to a technical object, which in early development is linked to the mechanical/processive and temporal aspects of

maternal care: the over and over again experience of the infant

feeding at the breast, which is "re-encountered/repeated by the child

in the form of the transitional object" [(Russell, 2020,](#index_split_004.html_p185) p. 114). There is something processive, even mechanical, at work in our relationship to

the object-world that ignites the virtual. This shows the inter-

dependence between technics and virtuality, and thus any attempt

to distinguish human virtuality from digital-virtuality cannot be

done by splitting them apart and trying to naively recover a pre-technological world. In Stiegler's framework, there is no avoiding

technics as constitutive of what makes us human, whether we

embrace digital life with open arms or shun it. It is at our very origins,

as Winnicott shows.

[Stiegler (2013,](#index_split_004.html_p185) p. 3) enables us to understand how it is that the transitional character of the object is responsible for constituting a world. Or, to put it another way, the material world that surrounds us

becomes animated and alive through the current of virtuality that

runs through everything. That's why when we are cut off from the virtual, a world once bustling with potential is supplanted by a de-realized one, resulting in a diminished connection to a sense of

aliveness in relation to things. The mother's job is to convey to the

child that life is worth living, and she does so by co-experiencing with

the child the current of virtuality that underlies the transitional ob-

ject, so that the very fabric of their bond is impacted by its animating

and enlivening force. This makes very clear for us the connection we

have already seen between virtuality and Eros; indeed, the erotics of a

life-affirming desire (the very thing mother conveys to the child) is at

the root of the feeling that life is worth living. This is the opposite of a

\[r\]elationship to external reality which is one of compliance, the

world and its details being recognized but only as something to be

fitted in with or demanding adaptation. Compliance carries

with it a sense of futility for the individual and is associated with the idea that nothing matters (Winnicott as quoted in

[Stiegler. 2013,](#index_split_004.html_p185) p. 21)

The opposition between the feeling that life is worth living and futi-

lity will become important again when we explore the pharmacolo-

gical nature of digital virtuality in adolescence, for it also moves in both directions: on the one hand, it amplifies the sense of vitality that

is so intensely stirred during that time, while on the other, it can heighten the feeling of emptiness (life is dead and nothing really

[]{#index_split_003.html_p173}154 *Depth psychology in the digital age*

matters) also endemic to the adolescent psyche, which can push one

into either destructive rebellion or stultifying compliance.

It's perhaps not surprising, then, that for Stiegler the transitional object is the first pharmakon

because it is both an external object on which the mother and

child are dependent (losing it is enough to make this clear) and in

relation to which they are thus heteronomous, \[and an\] object

that \[...\] provides \[...\] sovereignty to both mother and child: their

serenity, their trust in life, their feeling that life is worth living, their autonomy. (pp. 2--3)

The mother protects the child from the threatening aspect of this first pharmakon which manifests as the prospect of the child becoming overly

reliant on it, for too long of a period of time. In this regard, [Winnicott's](#index_split_004.html_p185)

[(1971a)](#index_split_004.html_p185) claim that "most mothers allow their infants some special object and expect them to become, as it were, addicted to such objects" (p. 1)

takes on new relevancy. The issue of dependency, as manifest in the impulse to concretize and thus become addicted to our technical objects

at the expense of the vital circuit of virtuality that lies beneath them, is so crucially at stake in what we have seen thus far, from Benjamin's loss of

the aura to our seemingly insatiable craving for the hyperreal.

It's almost as if Winnicott is providing the directives that the good

enough mother already intuitively understands for protecting herself

and her child from the negative side of the pharmakon. Russell (2020)

provides us with the philosophical scaffolding for her instinct.

\[I\]t is crucial that the mother not challenge or denigrate \[the

transitional object\] by insisting on the priority of \[...\] \[the\] actual --

that she not impose a subject/object structure of opposition but

instead provide for an experience in which the thing appears as

having been both discovered and created. Doing so generates in the

child the feeling of discovery which is met by a world waiting to be

discovered -- a world that is there. ... (p. 114)

What's so critical in this formulation is that the way the mother protects the child from becoming overly dependent is rooted in her

ability to let the object itself stay transitional by not challenging the

intermediate space in which it dwells. As we have seen, this requires

her own receptivity to the current of virtuality that runs through it. In

[]{#index_split_004.html}

the end, the threat of fixation fades, as the object loses its significance over time and is eventually discarded. Yet, the child retains access to

its world-constituting force, as the transitional object gives way to transitional experience, and the intersubjective, psychic processes, i.e.

[]{#index_split_004.html_p174} *The virtual as potential space* 155

the way that virtual transitionality mediated the love between mother

and child, now spreads itself over the whole cultural field.

Because the "abrogation of omnipotence" (p. 5) is a feature of the

transitional object from the start, there is something foundational about this non-compliant resolution that grants us our initial exposure to a world that is different from the self and stands outside it.

The pharmacological tension within the human being is revealed by

two radically opposed paths that can subsequently unfold.

At this point my subject widens out into that of play, and of

artistic creativity and appreciation, and of religious feeling, and of

dreaming, and also of fetishism, lying and stealing, the origin and

loss of affectionate feeling, drug addiction, the talisman of

obsessional rituals, etc. [(Winnicott, 1971a,](#index_split_004.html_p185) p. 5)

In the first case, it becomes the source of play, dreaming, creativity (i.e., all of the activities that enable life to be lived imaginatively, passionately, in fruitful contact with this in-between space) while in

the second, it becomes a path toward self-destruction, in the forms of

lying and stealing, perversion and addiction.

Transitionality, as a state of being that is characterized by an

openness to the potentiality of the virtual, does not disavow the ac-

tual but holds it at bay, analogously to how the mother forestalls the

ever-demanding complexity of the world, offering it in small doses to

the infant. Yes, the infant is no longer all-powerful and mother is no

longer completely under his control, but in exchange for that abro-

gation of omnipotence, the infant gains a newfound capacity to

dream the real, to bring together "what is objectively perceived and

what is subjectively conceived of" [(Winnicott, 1971a,](#index_split_004.html_p185) p. 11). This is quite a reward, for it allows us to develop the capacity to play with the

deferral of the actual, with the back and forth illusion of things being

real and not real. The world of symbol, metaphor and metonymy is

thus opened up, without having to sacrifice or disavow the real.

But something entirely different can happen as well. Development

can be not quite good enough, and we find ourselves unable to

surrender our omnipotence. When this occurs, the deferral of the

actual inherent to transitional virtuality becomes a means of dis-

avowal, and our technics are placed in the service of extending our

subjective conception of the world beyond its limits. In the name of

an inflationary egoic agency, we thus attempt to subdue all that is

other to us. This is why Winnicott points to talismans, obsessional

rituals and addictions, as the transitional object becomes a fetish, a way of holding onto a world absent of separation or loss. As a result, the virtual can no longer perform its mediating function and difference collapses.

[]{#index_split_004.html_p175}156 *Depth psychology in the digital age*

We are most vulnerable to the poisonous side of the pharmakon

when we lose our capacity to bear the difference between the object

itself and the potential space it opens up. We clamour to possess that

potential space, to have it always there at the ready, at our disposal.

We try to do so by colonizing the object, but we find ourselves smack

dab in a destructive relationship of dependency, as we fear that once

we lose it, or stop its incessant use, we will be cut off from the very

source of virtuality. This process is now recognizable to us as the pharmacological roots of addiction, one of the great dangers posed by

our digital lives. It accounts for the panic we feel when we lose our phone or are for some reason impeded from going online, as if we were being cut off from life itself.

What if we consider all the digital objects that we surround ourselves with today -- our smartphones, laptops, tablets, video games, airpods, apps of all sorts that stream video and music and link us to

social networks -- as derivatives of the first pharmakon itself, which allowed the developing child to discover/create an intermediate space

in the name of bearing the loss of omnipotence that inevitably comes

in the encounter with the otherness of the world. We would have to

consider, as the mother does for the child, how to protect ourselves

from the threatening and destructive aspects of our digital objects in

order to contend with their pharmacological nature. What are

we actually doing with these devices as we move through the most ordinary moments of life?

In this light, let's consider how pervasive transitional moments

really are for both children and adults. We see it most clearly in those experiences from childhood that involve a passage from one

state to another: the transition from waking up to going to school;

waiting for the bus; the end of recess and the return to class; standing in line at a store, waiting for dinner, having to stop

whatever it was we were doing and go to bed. It's the wise adult who

helps with these transitions by remembering to bring along a little

something to eat or a small object to fiddle with, especially when the child is very young and truly requires a hand in learning to manage such moments. The need of something to help bridge those

gaps does not end when we become adults, for they do not dis-

appear, but simply change terrain. Now there is driving home from

a long day of work and having to enter the very different rhythm of

domestic life; or, once back home, trying to shift into a space of relational connection with a family member after finishing a long

list of household chores; or moving from a dull and uninspired

feeling into something meaningful and even inspired, as we attempt

to engage a creative act; or finding ourselves in the hollow between

the non-erotic and the erotic when we want to have sex with

someone, and the mood is just not there yet.

[]{#index_split_004.html_p176} *The virtual as potential space* 157

If we look around today, we see nearly everywhere people (children,

adolescents, and adults) using their devices to help manage these

endless transitions. We have become very dependent upon the virtual

deferral to plug the tiny holes and gaps that emerge in those small moments between one thing and the next. Someone leaves the room,

and without even giving it a moment of thought, I instantly flip on

my device. I'm hungry, but it's not yet time to eat, and I go directly to

Instagram. He breaks up with me, refusing to see me ever again, and I

can't stop myself, for months on end, from obsessively checking in on

him on Facebook. I miss the bus, I'm late for a train, a flight is can-

celled and there's my phone as solace for all of the endless waiting that lies ahead.

One of the great blessings of the digital is that it enables separations,

endings, momentary lapses in the action -- where we may well register

the hauntings of loss and absence -- to always remain potential, not

actual. I'm bored and have nothing to do; someone is coming but

hasn't yet arrived; five more minutes and then I have to leave; red light; stalled car; walking the dog; pushing the baby carriage; eating

lunch alone. But is the quick turn to the device to replace the object

and ward off these difficult feelings truly a blessing? Or, has the smartphone become -- as it makes an appearance today in nearly every

single transitional moment -- the ultimate fetish object? Does the play

between the subjectively perceived and the objectively presented

enhance or diminish the vitality of difference? Do our virtual objects,

in their play of deferral, open or collapse transitional space? [As Stiegler](#index_split_004.html_p185)

[(2013)](#index_split_004.html_p185) says, "\[t\]hings can constitute a world only insofar as they irreducibly proceed from the transitional character of the object"

(p. 3). Do we lose or gain the world?

This raises the very serious and troubling question as to whether is it

possible or not to have a non-fetishized relationship with these

objects. Is there a way to get enough distance or detachment from them

so that the virtuality that is awakened through them, that surges beneath and beyond them, can, like the fate of the mother--child

relationship, become incommensurate with the technical object so that

we can be nourished by its infinite potential without having to reify the

object itself? Is there any way to relate to our current crop of technical

objects such that the potential for fixation evaporates, and the dazzlement of its technological dimension organically loses significance over time and is eventually discarded. Will there ever be a post-digital

period of history?

Recently we heard the story of a psychotherapy patient who, in

having to prematurely end a very successful treatment because his

therapist was moving away, suggested at the beginning of his

last session that she provide him with access to her personal e-mail account, so that they could very occasionally have contact with one

[]{#index_split_004.html_p177}158 *Depth psychology in the digital age*

another. Here, in this particular fantasy of termination, the attempt to

use the digital to defer loss is painfully evident. Is it a creative deferral or a refusal of loss? Does it soften the blow of the end so that it can

actually be felt by the patient without overwhelming him, or does it

keep him trapped in the fantasy of an interminable relationship,

where the end never comes?

As a psychoanalyst of the virtual, Winnicott is showing the gradual

progression of transitional phenomena from their incarnation in a

specific object into a mode of being that enables us to bring the full

force of our psychic lives into creative contact with the world. Taking

note of this progression is crucial for our investigation of digitality insofar as we continue to explore how the virtual object, as pharmakon, both opens up as well as blocks access to the real. When are

we retreating into our screens to escape the world, and when does the

world seem to pour forth from the digital in new and originary ways?

Undoubtedly, this becomes a central topic with adolescents as today

one of the primary ways they begin to forge an emerging relationship

with the outside world is by withdrawing from the outward life of the

family into the privacy of their digital screens. [8](#index_split_004.html_p184)

[**4 The re-emergence of virtuality in adolescence**](#index_split_000.html_p12)

Winnicott addresses the developmental necessity of protecting the

psychic reality of the infant, child and adolescent from external im-

pingements, so that what is tacitly growing within can, over time, come to live in harmony with the facticity of the world. We have spoken of this protective sheltering as the mediating function of the

virtual, in that its dynamic play of illusion and reality can serve to regulate how much of the world may enter at any one time. But

[Winnicott (1965)](#index_split_004.html_p185) takes this requirement for protection from externality one step further with his assertion that there is a core to the

personality that,

never communicates with the world of perceived objects, and that

the individual person knows \[...\] must never be communicated

with or be influenced by external reality .... Although healthy

persons communicate and enjoy communicating, the other fact is

equally true, that each individual is an isolate, permanently non-

communicating, permanently unknown, in fact unfound. (p. 187)

This need for aspects of the self to stay hidden, unknown and unfound, takes on paramount importance during the tumultuous

transformation in identity that happens in the passage from child-

hood to adulthood.

[]{#index_split_004.html_p178} *The virtual as potential space* 159

Th\[e\] preservation of personal isolation is part of the search for identity, and for the establishment of a personal technique for

communicating which does not lead to violation of the central

self.... (p. 190)

Winnicott was writing at a time before our personal technologies so

readily served as a "remedy" to the problem of human solitude by providing the contemporary adolescent with a manifold of nearly

irresistible opportunities for communicative connection. In sharp

relief from the embeddedness in community and fellow feeling that

being on Instagram, Snapchat, and TikTok calls forth, Winnicott was

making the claim that learning to bear loneliness, isolation and

feeling separate from the collective -- aspects of being alive that evoke

the existential dimensions of having unknown and unfound parts of

oneself -- are an important element in the adolescent's search for her

soul. "Struggling through the doldrums" is his catchphrase for this

period of development in which a young person finds himself ex-

periencing periods of impotence and passivity in the face of an

overwhelming, and at times, deadened world. Not only is the ado-

lescent, like the infant, essentially an isolate, but his isolation often

manifests with depressive-like symptomatology: melancholy, some-

times severe; inaction, at times crippling; and a lack of connection to

others that can wear the mask of social anxiety.

In our current era, where there is so little tolerance for depressive

affect and social withdrawal, we rush to pathologize the doldrums, treating them as a condition that needs psychiatric intervention. As

denizens of a brightly illuminated digital world that so effectively eradicates feelings of isolation and loneliness, what do we make of Winnicott's insistence upon the psychological necessity of this inwardly oriented turn toward the dark opaqueness of one's own being?

How does the digital adolescent, with the pressure to sustain a well-

crafted online persona, establish a *personal technique* for communicating that does not violate those aspects of her identity that are not

ready (if ever) to be known or found? If indeed, as we have

hypothesized, the digital is a stand-in for the mothering function (in

its role of being a self-object as well as a container and facilitator of

originary desires) need it only be seen as an intrusive mother, and as

such, incapable of not violating the unformed? Or, as we will come to

explore, does the digital also uniquely adapt to the very situation -- the

psychological necessity in adolescence for concealment -- that

Winnicott is drawing our attention to?

We need to grapple with that which comes at us from the outside in

order to perceive what is expressing itself in a quieter way within. It

is only in that stillness that we can come to know the more private

dimensions of the self that resist communication with the outer

[]{#index_split_004.html_p179}160 *Depth psychology in the digital age*

world. Often, it is in solitude -- and the forceful confrontation with the

psyche that being alone brings with it -- that the uniqueness of

who one is, different from everyone else, can be discovered and

reflected upon.

People are afraid to find themselves alone, and so don't find

themselves at all ... You can't create something without being

alone ... What seems different in yourself: that's the one rare

thing you possess, the one thing that gives each of us his worth;

and that's just what we try to suppress. \[Instead\] we imitate. [(Gide,](#index_split_004.html_p184)

[2018,](#index_split_004.html_p184) p. 30)

The incommunicado self is a fitting image for that acute sensitivity the adolescent has to those aspects of who she is and what she experiences that can never be fully articulated, not to the self, nor to another. When she is lost or alone, without orientation, or carried off

by her dreams and fantasies, the depth she encounters there often surpasses the markers of who she knows herself to be. She is thus brought into contact with intimations of her being that have very little consequence for her well-functioning, social self.

Adolescence is a time of flux, where we are very open to the proliferating play of the virtual, as it drives the many and frequent experiments with persona, identity, and the ever-shifting boundary

between self and other that are such a prominent feature of this age.

By being given space to follow those circuits of virtuality, the adolescent comes to create/discover the uniqueness of his individuality,

the idiosyncrasy of his desire. Here again it is incumbent upon the parent to tolerate and endure this intermediate space, even when it flies in the face of adult reason. It is essential in providing the adolescent a resting place from the either/or logic of this age, and thus helping her bet manage the tension between the inward draw toward

the private and interior, and the outward pull, in the face of collective

pressure, to imitate or be like others. In this light, we can read

"Struggling through the Doldrums" as a primer for how to be po-

tentiated by the world in accordance with the exigencies of the incommunicado self. It is a guide for seeking access to a mode of potential space that grounds self-experience in that third sense of an

a-subjective virtual, a state of mind that we live but do not make

[(Scott, 1988).](#index_split_004.html_p185)

New urgencies arise in mind and body during adolescence. What

had been dormant becomes active, as the sexual and aggressive im-

pulses, heretofore contained by the mind of the child as internal fantasies, now seek expression and contact with the physicality of another body and the materiality of the world. A period of growth is

instantiated that is, on the one hand, enlivening and expansive, and

[]{#index_split_004.html_p180} *The virtual as potential space* 161

on the other, threatening and dangerous. For the adolescent faces in a

wholly new way the richness of the world's possibilities as well as its

equally real and implacable limits. Like it or not, externality, in all of

its radical ungovernability, comes marching up to the adolescent's

door, beckoning him or her to step through. We fall in love for the

first time, and are awakened to the suffering of erotic life. We are overwhelmed by feelings of alienation and disconnection in relation

to the family that once held us. We cast a new and unsettling eye on

the contradictions and hypocrisies of the culture that surrounds us.

And then there is the inevitable confrontation with an adversary, an

enemy, be it a fellow student, a teacher, a parent, or a love rival.

Competition, striving to be better, or just giving up and giving in, takes on a whole new meaning, as does winning and the possibility of

defeat. It all starts to feel like a matter of life and death.

We want to think of the virtual, in all three Winnicottian senses -- as a

deferring and protective mediator, a world-enlivening potentiator, and

that which gives rise to the unfathomable, a-subjective surround from which the self evolves -- as helping to hold and contain the adolescent, as

she undergoes these transformations. One's relation to the play of gain

and loss, the opening and closing of the world to desire, the dialectic of

illusion and reality that engenders experience, that is, one\'s relation to

the very virtual itself, is determinative for how one survives this trea-cherous passage. One is thrown from the shelter and safety of being a

child cared for by parents into the unpredictability and instability that

comes with a sexually mature body, facing the uncertainties and

hazards of adult life. The adolescent makes use of the mediating, defer-

ring, protective side of the virtual as a safeguard, an internal holding environment, so that the physical and affective intensity of these experiences can be borne well enough such that they can do their psychic transformational work without falling prone to the destruction that

can happen if there is not enough containment. That is why making room for, nurturing, and paying heed to the internal psychic space of the

adolescent is essential for their psychological health and growth.

The adolescent experience in a virtual world forces us to confront

once again the paradox by which the digital robs us of something in

our relation to human virtuality that causes a compensatory in-

tensification of our engagement with the digital. This is one way of

understanding its nearly magnetic draw on the adolescent of today.

Digital virtuality, in all of its raw and ferocious power (and think of

that sheer quantum of energy alongside what gets opened up in the

psyche during adolescence) tends to override and upset the depth

psychological way of imagining the relation between virtual and real

which locates one's unique individuality, one's true self, as dwelling

deep inside a person's psyche. So what's wrong with challenging that

formulation, with all of its inherent proclivities toward dualism and

[]{#index_split_004.html_p181}162 *Depth psychology in the digital age*

its historical denial of social and cultural realities? The digital is simply tipping the virtual/real/actual scales, coming up with a new equation that gives the adolescent more direct modulating power over

the whole operation.

But the worry is, that in so powerfully replacing the internal with

the external, the private and interior with the collective, and its demands for representational transparency, there may be less of the

inwardly generated human virtual available to protect the adoles-

cent in her confrontation with externality. Its unceasing stimuli

tends to drown out what we have traditionally conceived of as

space for the emergence of an internal world. And we worry then

most, not about the transformations happening as a result of this

new digital-adolescent hybrid -- in other words, what they are doing

in that space, (and as we know it is often physically safer there today than out in the world) -- but the lack of psychic protection found there in the name of a diminishing human virtual. Yet, and

perhaps this is the greatest paradox of them all, we find ourselves

turning today, as the realities of the external world grow harsher and less habitable, to the digital as an unexpected shelter for

the adolescent psyche. We can't help but encourage our kids to

dwell there when the alternative, being-out-in-the-world, feels so

dangerous. Those are the very kind of knots we believe Stiegler was

attuned to, as we attend to the pharmacological maelstrom that is

going on today with adolescents and their technology.

[**5 Digital adolescence**](#index_split_000.html_p12)

Adolescence is a potential space in its own right. No longer a child, and

not yet an adult, the adolescent stands on a precipice between what has

been and what is to come. But if the quest to hold onto the more opaque and non-communicative aspects of the self wasn't fragile enough in the life of the pre-digital adolescent, it is an even more for-midable process for someone growing up in the digital era. In a world

where the exteriorized spaces of socially digitized networks encapsulate

the adolescent's experiential and affective life, "Struggling through the

Doldrums" can seem like an archaic and out-of-date concept. However,

if we for a moment dim the beam of digital light, we are forced to confront the fact that for a self that takes root in the collectivity and

transparency of virtual worlds, there is little opportunity for inwardness

and solitude, less ground for learning to bear the always contingent nature of human experience itself.

\[During\] adolescence ... there is a strengthening of the defences

against being found, that is to say being found before being there

to be found. That which is truly personal and feels real must be

[]{#index_split_004.html_p182} *The virtual as potential space* 163

defended against at all cost, and even if this means a temporary

blindness to the value of compromise. [(Winnicott, 1965,](#index_split_004.html_p185) p. 190) The outward pull toward being seen and validated, something already

so engrossing for any adolescent, becomes, for the digital native, a totalizing mode of experience. There is little room left to explore those

aspects of self that shy away from attention, and resist premature at-

tempts at representation. As the adolescent is pulled toward a state of

near total visibility, the defenses against being found before being ready to be found are breached. All becomes fodder for the posting and profiling of the nascent self.

But we also have to consider that there is an important flipside to

the search for identity in adolescence that moves in the exact opposite direction: the growing hunger to make contact with the

world, and the people and events in life that feel most alive and real.

Given this strong drive to seek out vital and compelling experiences

that move one away from the predictability of family life and the trappings of the childhood self, it is no wonder that adolescents are

so powerfully drawn to our 21st-century technologies. The digital is a

meaning-intensifier; it imbues experience with an emotional

immediacy unlike almost anything else in life. It supercharges the virtual's potentiating effects. With video games, for example, adolescents can enter a totally immersive world of excitement and

action, where newly awakened sexual and aggressive impulses are

given free rein. In these virtual encounters with unknown worlds,

where contingency and risk, violence and destruction, the erotics

of agency, action, and affiliation can be safely played with,

adolescents come to know something more about the authenticity of

their self-experience.

Perhaps the digital stages its own solution to this fundamental

dilemma of adolescence: not risking premature exposure to the un-

formed dimensions of the self alongside an equally strong impulse to

move outside the self and make contact with the world. Inside the protected space of the digital, two aspects of the virtual that we uncovered in Winnicott's early developmental theory can be woven

together, as the digital provides both a mediating and protective force

field, offering shelter from premature exposure to the world while at

the same time, in its actualizing function, allowing desire to potentiate reality, as the world becomes ripe with possibility. There is an

unrestrained quality to this intensification of experience yet it takes

place in a very protected environment.

Having transformed the experience of being alone, by making it not

only tolerable, but, at times, deeply pleasurable and often preferable,

our contemporary technological gadgetry offers the adolescent a un-

ique mode of psychological privacy, a perch from which the interior

[]{#index_split_004.html_p183}164 *Depth psychology in the digital age*

dimensions of psychic life can be explored. When she closes the door

of her bedroom and clicks on the screen, she enters an intensely social

and public, yet wholly sequestered, holding environment. In such a

space, she can be as anonymous as she chooses, thus modulating how

much of herself she reveals to the other and how much is kept hidden.

The encounter with social networks and digitally mediated realities provides a means of exploration for her innermost fantasies and

reveries, beyond the psychic reality of her mind, as they now appear

in virtual worlds, to be shared, shaped, and camouflaged. In this heretofore unseen and puzzling way, the digital allows her to

reach inside herself by reaching outwards, thus establishing virtual reality as a sheltered sanctuary for the actualization of her innermost

self-experience. [9](#index_split_004.html_p184)

Because it provides both a safe and protected space (its mediating

function) and a compelling and enlivening one (its potentiating

function), the virtuality inherent to digital life offers the adolescent a

platform for the spontaneous unbinding of the self, a loosening of identity that escapes the strictures of a life dominated by the wishes

and needs of others. The digital contributes, in its own bewildering and, at times, contradictory ways, to a profound leap into the outer

world. There are people to encounter, an endless multitude of things

to see and experiences to be had. So much comes alive, erotically and

relationally, in the vast and open wilderness it provides for friendship,

love, and the sheer excitement of encountering what is new and

unfamiliar.

Free from the scrutinizing and judging eyes of one's parents, there is

an extraordinary fecundity that happens in the private spaces of di-

gital adolescence. Because it occurs in a relatively safe zone, a contained space (the adolescent is not out in the streets, but in one's bedroom) he can use it to engage in the complex (and of course, lifelong) process of learning to make contact with others without

being overtaken by them, to show off the self and hide it at the same

time, and to loudly and brashly communicate while holding back

what's not ready to be said. If indeed adolescence is a potential space

all its own, which holds in tension this confluence of paradoxical and

opposing forces, then perhaps we can consider, to an important ex-

tent (that must be reckoned with to understand the life world of the

contemporary adolescent) that the kind of virtuality that manifests itself in digital space can become an effective vessel for its hard-wrought transformations.

Part of what defines adolescence and ultimately pushes one into

adulthood is some kind of collapse, some kind of failure to contain the particular ways in which we are broken in upon by the world. We

are not claiming that the digital forestalls such collapses; rather, we

want to seriously consider what it might have to offer along the way,

[]{#index_split_004.html_p184} *The virtual as potential space* 165

as a new kind of container, a profoundly distinct means of actualizing

experience that at least partially overcomes certain types of hazards when experience is acted out in the world.

We began with the idea that the digital runs contrary to the psychological tasks of adolescence, as it blocks access to a personal and

idiomatic virtuality in the name of an all encompassing, difference-

erasing collective virtuality. And we end by saying that digital life can

be understood as a rich launching pad for an intensive engagement

with the intricacies of the virtuality that comprises the adolescent psyche. So which is it? Or do we have to choose?

**Notes**

[1](#index_split_003.html_p160) Winnicott never explicitly uses the word *virtual* even though the problematic of the virtual and the real is significantly at issue in his work.

[2](#index_split_003.html_p161) In the next chapter, we will examine [Winnicott's (1971b)](#index_split_004.html_p185) essay "The Use of an Object" and explore the difference between object relating and object usage as we come to relate to the other as a separate subjectivity. This analysis will lead us to think about what impact digitality is having on this always already difficult struggle to come to terms with the "otherness" of

the other. Without a doubt, this is also a crucial stage in the developmental origins of human virtuality, but we will treat it separately given its centrality to the question of the other.

And I sneeze into my phone which transcribes this explosion as "you."

(Maureen N. McLane)

How can he be a self and others others since the others too are selves,

to themselves?

(John Banville)

[**Prelude**](#index_split_000.html_p12)

We are in the grip today of a powerful instinct to know and be known

by larger and larger networks of people. We are consumed with the

impulse to expand the self beyond the boundaries of where we are currently situated and be in simultaneously active (and often live) virtual contact with a multitude of others -- extended family, friends,

acquaintances, colleagues from work, people from our past, as well as

acclaimed people, celebrities, sports figures, and the rest. This drive to

immerse ourselves in a collective network of others has a rapacious quality that we try to quell by passively turning to our news feed, the

updates, photos, videos, and likes of that wildly random, voluminous

assortment of people that we mark as friends or followers. There is contact, exchange, meet-ups, and so on, that are part of how we satisfy the desires of this digitally expanded self alongside a more pas-

sive, voyeuristic mode, where the thrill and pleasure is in checking up

on and watching how others are living their lives. The excitement and

at times, desperation, to receive likes on our postings, to be rated by

the other, or to playfully explore the number of matches we might get

on a dating app (even if we are not really looking for a date) speaks to

the unabashed yearning to be seen, to feel held inside the other's mind, or to hold the other in ours.

As a result, bolstering that feeling of being connected to the whole

world, our minds become populated with an extensive arrangement

of people and events; no longer the inner objects of the depth psychologist, "the cemeteries of the brain" [(Arsic, 2016,](#index_split_005.html_p217) p. 71), but outer

[]{#index_split_004.html_p187}168 *Depth psychology in the digital age*

ones, brimming with aliveness, vitality, and change that implant

themselves in our everyday consciousness. Through this process of

taking in so many lives other than our own, the digital is expanding

our relational world at an accelerated and unrelenting pace. Yet, this

outward focus and attention toward virtual others may deafen us to

the rhythms of the inner self and the free arising of its imagery. We

have discussed this in terms of the virtual within, portrayed by depth

psychology, in its Freudian and Jungian stripes, as an internal world

complete with its own universe of characters, whose affectively

charged currents of images and narratives, journey beneath our outer

lives. Two distinct forms of virtuality, two different virtual reality worlds.

In wondering whether we can still hear the music of our own

imagination amid the clamoring roar of the collective, we are im-

pelled to consider the interplay between the virtual as it manifests in

the singularity of the individual psyche and its dissemination into the

collectivity of a networked mind. This familiar topic can now be

illuminated from the perspective of the other. Our internal and

external object relational worlds are taking shape today against the backdrop of digital virtuality, in which new modes of both taking in

and expunging the other are becoming increasingly prevalent. This

destabilizes the assumptions that we have up to now taken for granted

about where we draw the boundary between self and other, and has

dramatic consequences, as we will see, for the place of otherness in everyday human life.

[**1 Digital disavowal**](#index_split_000.html_p12)

"Under normal conditions," as Young says, "dissociation enhances the

integrating functions of the ego by screening out excessive or irrelevant

stimuli. Under pathological conditions the normal functions of dis-

sociation become mobilized for defensive use" (Young, as quoted in

[Bromberg (1998)).](#index_split_005.html_p217) In the course of everyday life, there is not such a clear distinction between these two -- integrative and defensive -- instances of dissociation, but more of a spectrum; and even in clinical practice it is often difficult to discern where on such a spectrum someone lies. In our everyday use of digital devices, the distinction between adaptive and pathological instances of dissociation become

even more blurred. For example, it is commonplace (and now no

longer only with the younger generations) that when people are

gathered together in the same communal space, it is considered well within the boundaries of ordinary social behavior to turn away from whatever is happening in the immediate present circumstances and

begin interacting with someone else, on one's phone. But some may say we have always done that, in more covert ways, all the time

[]{#index_split_004.html_p188} *Virtuality and the other* 169

anyway, not on our phones but in our minds. Indeed, in our engage-

ment with others we often find ourselves lost in thought, taken

somewhere else, being physically yet not emotionally or cognitively present.

If dissociation can be described as a momentary splitting of the

mental from the physical, one state of self from another, does anything change when the dissociative moment of being swept up and

taken somewhere else is no longer contained within the boundaries of

one's own mind and body? Is the nature of being split different in the

case of our smartphone life, when we are physically present with one

person while engaging virtually with someone else, somewhere else,

at the same time? If we are always already, in the everyday, non-pathological sense, in a mild state of dissociation, if indeed, as

[Bromberg (1998)](#index_split_005.html_p217) claims, this is how the mind functions, is it another instance of the same, or is the digital pushing us toward a more severe,

problematic level of dissociative splitting?

The spectrum between ordinary and traumatic dissociation we find

in Bromberg is also present in Freud's concept of disavowal. Freud considers it to be a pathological defense that the ego uses to radically

deny the impact of an unpleasant or horrifying external perception,

by splitting itself into two [parts.1](#index_split_005.html_p216) As a result, two simultaneous paths form in the mind, two independent logics, that do not interact or interfere with each other. At the same [time, Freud (1940)](#index_split_005.html_p217) also seems to imply that disavowal is an ordinary, non-pathological aspect of the mind, where there is a self-generative back and forth movement between disavowing something and then acknowledging it, a creative

and adaptive use of it. [2](#index_split_005.html_p216) We can see this dynamic play in our relationship to our own mortality, and the ongoing oscillation between

living our lives as if we are not going to die (disavowal) and moments

where are brought face to face with our mortal condition (acknowl-

edgment).

[Bromberg (1998)](#index_split_005.html_p217) expresses a similar state of play between knowing and not-knowing something when he says that ordinary dissociation is

a basic process that allows individual self-states to function

optimally (not simply defensively) when full immersion in a single

reality, a single strong affect, and a suspension of one's self-

reflective capacity is exactly what is called for or wished for. (p. 273)

We can be acknowledging one reality while disavowing another, not

because we are defensively trying to escape from something, but

creatively trying to enter it, keeping certain aspects of a situation out

of awareness so that we can more fully immerse ourselves in it. This

happens with events and with people. Indeed, this play of disavowal

and acknowledgment is one of the primary ways by which we regulate

[]{#index_split_004.html_p189}170 *Depth psychology in the digital age*

our relationship to the other. This is strikingly evident in the paradoxical nature of the therapeutic setup. The business relationship

between therapist and patient (you pay me for my services because this is how I make my living) is disavowed well enough in order for

both participants to enter into the affectively charged, relatively un-

guarded relationship necessary for the therapy to work. This play of

disavowal and acknowledgement is what holds the tension between

intimacy and professionalism that is necessary to both sustain the therapeutic bond and eventually break it, when it is time for the treatment to come to an end.

And finally there is the use of disavowal for psychic survival, as what happens with trauma. Here it is not a creative play of knowing

and not-knowing, or a near-psychotic refusal to acknowledge what is

before one's eyes, but an active turning away from reality in order to

protect the self from fragmenting. Only by being able to disavow the

traumatic experience can the victim hold onto another part of himself

that continues to exist separate from the trauma. This brings us back

to the image of two independent tracks, where the traumatized ego and its non-traumatized part become separate, non-interacting systems that account for how someone who has suffered such experi-

ences survives and continues on with life.

A wide range of digitally induced behaviors toward the other lie on

the broad spectrum from interactions laced with ordinary dissociative

moments to more severe and, at times, pathologically induced ex-

amples of disavowal, where the reality of the other is so erased from

the mind that it is as if he or she ceases to exist anymore. The digital

provides us with new instruments for regulating contact: We can

move in toward the other, very close and quick, or suddenly expunge

her, effacing her from memory. In the discourse of our digital times,

there are many terms that illuminate the spectrum of these new

modes of modulating our relationship to the other: friending, liking,

muting, blocking, unfriending, and, in its most annihilatory form,

ghosting. These movements along the path from connection to era-

sure have dynamic effects both on who is acting and who is being acted upon.

"Sorry, I have to take this" was used in the past to excuse the mo-

mentary interruption of a phone call, and there was an expectation

that the other would come back and re-engage. But that mantra today

has transformed into a perpetual "waiting," for with the advent of the

smartphone, there is no predicting when someone might take a call,

and if they do, we can certainly never know for sure when and if they

will return. In psychotherapy, in what was once considered a revered

space of intimate depth relating, it has become commonplace for the

patient to interrupt the exchange, no matter what is being talked about, no matter how affectively charged, by taking a call or

[]{#index_split_004.html_p190} *Virtuality and the other* 171

responding to a text and then re-presencing with the quip, "Oh yes,

where were we?" If the patient is momentarily dissociated, searching

to find their way back, so is the therapist, as their experience of being

embedded in a dialogical process has also been breached by the interruption. But again, is this any different from a psychotherapy pa-

tient who, speaking to her therapist on the phone from an outdoor

park, intermittently interrupts the process by turning her attention to

the tweeting bird that lands nearby? Whether the distraction is virtual

or not seems to make no difference, for they both have a similar dissociative effect.

The withdrawal from the present moment has no apparent in-

dicators; it can happen at any time, called from the outside by a ding

or the inside by an impulse to tweet. It is generally permissible now to

ignore whoever we are with in real life in order to respond to the virtual beckoning. This is the unwritten rule of digital social life. In groups, hanging out with family or friends, we simultaneously have a

foot in each world, real and virtual, and the virtual is progressively given favor.

We are increasingly intolerant of any lull in conversation, all the many awkward moments of not quite knowing what to say or where

to go next. Phubbing, where we ignore our companion by turning to

the phone or screen, has become socially acceptable. I'm bored with

you, so I phub you. Or your phubbing signals that you are bored with

me. Any moment, no matter how intimate, can be interrupted. The

digital phub becomes the ever-ubiquitous solution to working our

way out of such holes. I stumble over my words, or take too long to

say what I want to say, and "poof!" the other is gone. There is the running joke that nowadays people are phubbing even while

having sex.

And of course, we are also phubbing ourselves. We may be thinking

or working on something, deeply engaged in a task, and thus tempted

with the ever-present enticement to click away and go somewhere

else. High school and college students report always having to add into the time calculation any one homework task will take the endless

minutes or hours spent compulsively searching the web, and often,

after the first few minutes, not even enjoying it.

But what effect does phubbing have on the other; what happens in

the mind of he or she who is being phubbed? As we saw in our psy-

chotherapy example, the experience of being engaged together with

someone and then suddenly dropped, sets off a dissociative process in

the mind. Whatever ways in which we might have been present to

ourselves, and/or present to the other, is shattered in that abrupt and

unexpected experience of being turned away from. It can potentially

create a wave of strong affect -- upset, anger, outrage, sadness, help-

lessness, and so on -- that is inevitably blotted out, as we are all

[]{#index_split_004.html_p191}172 *Depth psychology in the digital age*

expected to adhere, without complaint, to this unwritten code of di-

gital conduct. Isn't it parallel to the situation of a child who grows up

with a parent whose attention toward her is constantly being inter-

rupted, which results in herself becoming split? Dissociated parents forge dissociated kids. And of course, for us today, dissociated kids also

forge dissociated parents. Since the limits of their relation to their children are regulated by the demand that to make emotional contact

they must also partake in the virtual, the emotional life of the parent

suffers these fissures too. Abrupt shifts in presence and attention are

the currency of contemporary exchange.

We shouldn't pretend anymore that our gadgets only serve com-

municative ends. In our impulse to make them into tools of erasure,

there is an imperious urge for dominance, a will to power. I no longer

have to bother with the reality of the separate other, for the smartphone in my hand can become a weapon, offering me a quick and

efficient escape from her demands. It allows me to defend against the

ways in which the uninvited other tries to penetrate my defenses and

occupy space inside my mind. And does this remarkable power to

psychically expunge the other from our being, help explain our psy-

chological yearning to always be in possession of such a device,

especially in moments of great vulnerability?

To understand the nature of these self-other dynamics, we must first

face an important paradox contained within them. Because we are

social and relational beings from the start, the formation of loving attachments with our early caretakers is a crucial necessity for not only our physical but our emotional survival. One of the primary

consequences of forming a close relationship with another person,

however, is having to bear the residues of the other's unprocessed and

unmetabolized affects. We unconsciously and unwittingly take them

in. A mother does it for her baby, as she metabolizes the unthinkable

anxieties that the infant cannot yet bear [(Winnicott, 1962;](#index_split_005.html_p218) [Bion,](#index_split_005.html_p217)

[1983).](#index_split_005.html_p217) And we do it, consciously and unconsciously, when we love each other, in that enormously complex, bi-directional exchange of

affective chaos that is the life-blood of any significant relationship.

As infants, we just drank in the other. The internal object world disclosed by psychoanalysis is generated from how un-self-consciously and openly vulnerable we were to taking in the un-

conscious dimensions of their being. And because this process gives

rise to the innermost structures of the self, we are forever haunted by

this enigmatic stamp of otherness inside [us.3](#index_split_005.html_p216)

With the reverberating echoes from those early experiences where

we were once colonized, the boundary between self and other be-

comes a psychic fault line. In this conception of human development,

we are ever vulnerable in our relational lives to the unmetabolized actions and words of the other. Whereas repression is a defense

[]{#index_split_004.html_p192} *Virtuality and the other* 173

against instinctual demands that arise from within, disavowal defends

against the claims of reality, which in this context, amounts to the claims made upon us by the people who inhabit our closest orbit.

Nevertheless, there is, as we have indicated, a constructive use of disavowal. It can serve as a protective shield, allowing us greater capacity for bearing the primordial conflict between self and other

without having to repress it. By disavowing fundamental aspects of who someone is, we can better tolerate and live in a less-conflictual

stance with them. The back and forth of knowing and not-knowing,

disavowing and acknowledging, becomes the means through which

we dynamically modulate our relations.

So perhaps digital disavowal has a positive potential. It helps to prevent our falling through the many small fissures that are always on

the verge of multiplying in our relation to the other. The click that suddenly switches things off can very well be seen as a momentary disavowal that allows us the chance to recoup and gain our footing

once again. By temporarily distancing or even erasing the other, we

protect ourselves from his unsettling effects. It also helps us bear the

otherness that lives within, in the form of traumatic traces of early object ties that, in certain triggering situations, create unbearable affects that threaten the integrity of self-experience. When we live out a

wholly new identity on the Internet, for example, we enact a mode of

internal disavowal, where we can disregard certain facts about ourselves and our history. In Jungian terms, we might speak of this as a

creative disavowal of the shadow. We may find that this digitally constructed persona better sustains the synthesizing processes that

knit the self together and keep it whole.

The digital is able to disavow one thing in the name of the next so

adroitly that we can exist in multiple realities and diverse worlds without contradiction. This quicksilver passage from one reality to another can be taken up in very different ways. It can become a seductively enticing hide-out for the self, where we can appear to others

one way but actually be acting antithetically to it. Here, the digital magnifies the all-too-human trait of self-concealment; it makes us

masters of deception. Whatever we are doing on-line, whoever we

may be in contact with, can be secreted away from the other, in a mere click, as we return to the report that we were writing or the shopping that we were doing. This quality of being hidden in plain

sight -- everyone on their laptops or phone, furtively clicking away at

something -- exacerbates the tendency, so much a part of modernity,

to live a compartmentalized life, acting out the conflicts within the self by dissociatively switching between multiple, yet contradictory identities. These disavowing mechanisms help to further repress these

conflicts, so we can continue on with things despite them.

[]{#index_split_004.html_p193}174 *Depth psychology in the digital age*

But, at the same time, it also offers us the possibility of engaging, rather than repressing, them; a way to hold the mind's multiple

compartments in a free play of exchange. As we have seen, the other

can be as directly acknowledged by the digital as it can be disavowed.

And in-between the two, there is a creative play of knowing and not-

knowing things about the other, while letting them know and not

know things about ourselves. The unique mix of virtual and actual that happens in digital life offers us the possibility of learning to play, of opening up the very space of "don't act-out and don't repress" that

is so central to the psychoanalytic process. The digital enriches and expands the creativity of modulation, that fecund dance of revealing

and concealing, which makes our relationship to the other more alive,

more bearable, fuller, and richer.

Never in human history have we seen outside the province of our

own minds such a quick and totalizing mechanism for disavowal as

that which we are given with the digital screen. It seamlessly keeps incompatible realities apart from each other, on separate and parallel

tracks. It allows heterogeneous things, with their diverse and separate

dynamics, to lodge, conflict-free, inside a person's awareness. Because

what is happening on one screen does not impact what is happening

on another or in our actual empirical experience, we can go from one

to the next, guilt-free, without ever having to look back.

If indeed we are all struggling to bear the ways in which we are inhabited by the traces of the other, then the specific ways we use our

pocket-sized disavowing machines expose the innermost aspects of

our psychology. If we let ourselves go and truly make full use of the

logic of disavowal, we must reckon with the inescapable conflict be-

tween a disavowal that empowers us to better bear the otherness in

human life, or a disavowal that aggressively erases the other for the

sake of self-dominance.

[**2 Digital eros**](#index_split_000.html_p12)

Virtual life tends to smooth over the emotionally fraught and un-

predictable nature of self-other interactions as they occur in everyday

experience. Certain aspects of why, at times, it can be so difficult to

bear other people are attenuated by the digital: the physical space of

our fellow embodied beings and how much of it they take up, their

demanding gaze, the inevitable conflict between their desire and ours,

and our aggression towards them.

When we are speaking through the screen, my gaze cannot reach you,

that is, I cannot look you in the eye, which is something we can always

do in the presence of the other. My gaze does not cross the same space as

yours when we are together virtually, nor do my eyes receive the same

light from which you are looking at me. Screen-mediated relations create

[]{#index_split_004.html_p194} *Virtuality and the other* 175

an emotional distance that helps to dampen down affect, diminish

conflict, giving us a new kind of control over how we interact and communicate. Nevertheless, our minds already seem to have settled and

unconsciously convinced themselves that, when we are conversing with

others on the screen we are indeed in the presence of those people.

But while our minds are easily persuaded, our bodies are not. In these virtual interactions, we stop receiving almost all the bodily and

physical signals to which we are accustomed, and from which we

build our impression of reality. However, our growing dependence on

technology forces us to live our relational lives in a world increasingly

mediated by screens. Adolescents spend significantly more time now

with friends online than in their actual, physical presence. And not

only do they not miss much in such virtual interactions, but often they tend to feel more comfortable with them than in actual embodied encounters.

The inherent instability of human relationships is stabilized by a life

extended by the virtual. The anxiety of meeting someone new, for ex-

ample, is vastly reduced by the mediation of the screen. Paradoxically, at

the very same time, the other also becomes more accessible, more

transparent. When he is no longer there, we can bring back his recorded

image and hold it before us, and have as long as we need to take a very

close and intimate look at just who he is. We can make a careful study of

his facial gestures or the definition of his muscles, examining the precise details of any part of the body that may interest us.

The digital gaze penetrates its object and enlivens it more than

photography or painting ever allowed; the still image, now in-

sufficient, is quickened into living video motion by a simple touch.

And if we have sent tiny cameras to film our subject from within, we

can even look inside the body so we can render visible, not only for

the medical eye, but also the artists', what is invisible to the naked eye. As the impulse toward making all representations into some form

of a video-like feed has encroached upon us, we barely notice that the

once motionless and mute photographs have even become in our

phones living moments as well.

The ability to film, edit, and view at will the image of the other offers us a new way of inhabiting him, and holding him in consciousness, often without consent. It is as if today we can safely stalk

whomever we want on any of the trending social media, without

ever having to cross the line and impose ourselves upon them in real

life. Digitization promotes a nearly perfect mode of voyeurism, in that it both holds the other safely at a distance, while at the same

time allowing us to see up-close whatever it is we want to see. By obviating the need for physical presence, and thus transcending the

opposing force of the other's difference, we can innocuously probe

[]{#index_split_004.html_p195}176 *Depth psychology in the digital age*

his inner depths. Abolish the body and you are halfway there to

taming the other.

Digital voyeurism opens up new pathways into the paradoxical

dynamism of approach and avoidance, fight or flight behavior. This

new capability for coming in close while staying distant complicates

the already intractable psychological issue of intimacy with the

other. And since this dialectic is so germane to our sexual lives, the

apotheosis of digital voyeurism is virtual sex. When we enter the safe

and predictable domain of the virtual, the raw, unpredictable, and

affective aspects of sexuality are deferred. Clean and efficient "intercourse" with a virtual image (whether we are watching porno-

graphy, sexting, or engaging in cyber or robotic sex) is less

emotionally complicated than what happens when two bodies meet.

The uncontrollable excess inherent to desire, its wildness and un-

predictability, is reigned in; what is so utterly vulnerable about sexuality is expunged. But no longer constrained by the bodily presence of my partner, I can enter an unencumbered sexual flow as the

erotic frees itself from the limiting effects of the other and becomes

an almost pure act of imagination.

This liberation of the erotic from its rootedness in what is vulner-

able and hence potentially traumatic has radically opened the doors

of sexuality, freeing it from the prison of repression. The digital has

unlocked something fundamental about our sexual lives that, as Freud

noted, when bottled up, consumes a good deal of our psychic energy.

More than just the significant increase in sexual freedom and ex-

pression inaugurated in the \'60s, today, thanks to the Internet, there is

a new mode of access to the sexual imagination in all of its forms and

varieties. A uniquely constituted polymorphously perverse fluidity, in

the best and most creative sense of that term, boosts the possibilities

for living out our erotic lives.

Freud was always more weary than we are today about the negative

effects on culture when sexuality is released too freely. If neurosis is caused by sexual repression, the solution is not simply lifting it with the goal of immediate and unending gratification, but rather reckoning

with this energy, facing inside ourselves what it is wanting. In his ex-

istential reading of Freud, Jean-Luc [Nancy (2008)](#index_split_005.html_p217) suggests that coming to terms with how the sexual drive ( *Sexualtrieb*) lives inside us is tantamount to facing our fate, thus he provides us with an ontological scrim against which to examine what is happening to eros as it makes a

new home in the digital, freed from its repressive confinements.

Man comes from a momentum \[ *élan*\] or a surge \[ *poussée*\] which surpasses him, which surpasses in any case much of what Freud

designates as the "self" \[ *moi*\]. He calls this momentum or surge the *Trieb*.

[]{#index_split_004.html_p196} *Virtuality and the other* 177

Instead of translating it as "drive," Nancy uses the French *pulsion* to re-interpret Freud's Trieb, stressing the fact that we originate from

a movement that has come from elsewhere, from the non-

individuated, from what is the hidden archaic state of our origins,

proliferating and confused -- and that is: nature; the world; the

whole of humanity behind us, and behind it what makes it

possible; the emergence of the sign and the gesture; the call of all of us to the elements, to forces, to the possible and the

impossible; the sense of infinity lying ahead of us, lying behind

and amongst us; the desire to answer to this call, and to expose

oneself to it. We originate from this movement, from this

momentum, from this surge. In the final analysis, it is within

this movement and as such a movement that we can grow.

This active momentum inside us that comes from elsewhere, moving us

forward as the basis for growth, precisely sums up what [in Chapter 4](#index_split_002.html_p110) we were identifying as the (immanent) virtual. Nancy goes on to say:

This surge comes from elsewhere than us. ... This "elsewhere" is

not a "beyond" ... This "elsewhere" is inside us: it forms within us

the most creative and the most powerful engine driving this

momentum, which is what we are. This is because it is nothing

less than our being ... "being" considered in the meaning of the

verb "to be": it is a motion, a movement, an emotion, the shock

and rise of desire and fear, waiting and attempting, trying,

accessing, even crisis and exaltation.

While the particular way of thinking about what is beyond the

human in the digital is given form in the externality of the robot, the

avatar, the cyborg, the algorithmic transmutation of the mind (i.e., a

technical consciousness, freed from the materiality of existence,

which exceeds human awareness), here we are offered a non-

technological ontology for thinking beyond the human subject.

Because the digital is inorganic -- even though more and more we try

to wear it, insert it under the skin, in our brains, replacing parts of

our body, etc. -- it is always extraneous to us. But in his rendering of

Freud's drive as a surge that surpasses what we ordinarily think of as

the self, Nancy -- clearly in contrast to the digital -- locates this nonhuman beyond inside us. It is an outside inside that allows for an

encounter with an elsewhere that is intrinsic to our being. Moreover,

in describing that drive as an "infinity lying ahead of us, lying be-

hind and amongst us" (ibid), Nancy is giving voice to that realm of

infinite possibility that underwrites human subjectivity, the very

virtual itself.

[]{#index_split_004.html_p197}178 *Depth psychology in the digital age*

This non-personal surge strongly resonates with the mad pro-

liferation of the simulacrum that we saw in Deleuze. Although the digital expands the self, giving it more freedom and creativity, unleashing desire (sexual and otherwise), in new and unheard of ways, it

is of a different order than the virtual that lies within and beyond us

i.e., the "non-individuated drive that arises from the hidden and ar-

chaic state of our origins, proliferating and confused." This provides a

clue about why in the example from *Be Right Back* that we analyzed in

[Chapter 3,](#index_split_001.html_p82) the clone lacked the spontaneity without which it could not respond in a human way.

In Nancy's hands, Freud's theory of the drive seems to veer toward

Jung, who equates libido with the psychic or life energy that drives our being. But there's the sense in Nancy that we can only get there by

first coming to terms with this confusing, non-linear proliferation of

desire that has no inherent organization and thus is at some basic level ungovernable, never completely contained by the psyche,

that Freud, in the *Three Essays,* identifies with sexuality. The digital gratification of the sexual impulse seems to be at risk of erasing this

non-human elsewhere of sexuality, its very ungovernability, the non-

individuated drive that destabilizes the unity and coherence of the self. In the name of a freely flowing digital eros, virtual sex can scale

down our erotic lives into something uncomplicated and predictable. [4](#index_split_005.html_p216)

Inside the protective shell of the digital, eros is cut off from the contingency of the world that is the source of its emergence. It is constrained by the flat and frictionless surface of the virtual, where difference and otherness are dampened down, almost to the point of

being mute. Thus sheltered, the other cannot truly make contact with

us, as the immateriality of the medium evaporates their existential density, numbing us to the separateness of their desire. We are thus

sanctioned to pursue the singular quest for gratification. Digital eros

gives succor to the pure pleasure principle which is ultimately turned

in upon itself, unleashing the selfishness of the drive. Freed from the

possibility of harm, we can feel we are living our erotic lives with renewed intensity and immediacy, taking more risks, exploring more

possibilities, yet that smoothing over the psychic turmoil inherent to

sexuality can cast a very potent shadow that haunts eros in the virtual

world.

There is something very difficult to bear about sexuality as it opens us

to forces outside our control, unpredictable and unreliable, and never

fully known. Together with death, sex brings us face to face with our

inherent and unavoidable vulnerabilities, the fragility of our bodies, the demands and strength of our desire. Being vulnerable, being open

to risk, is essential to how we love, just as in the Greek myth, in order to unite with Eros, Psyche has to undergo trials and suffering. But digital

eros seems to disconnect us from psyche, to be devoid of the very

[]{#index_split_004.html_p198} *Virtuality and the other* 179

soulfulness of human love. This impoverishment of eros leads us down

the well-trodden path of the erotic becoming the sexual and the sexual

the pornographic. As Byung Chul [Han (2017)](#index_split_005.html_p217) puts it:

\[A\] sexual object that can be consumed is not the Other. It never

calls me into question. .... The pornographic image emanates no

resistance to the Other or the Real. It is neither upstanding nor distanced. What is pornographic is precisely the lack of contact

and encounter with the Other. Instead, autoerotic contact and

auto-affection protect the ego from being touched or seized by the

Other. (p. 45)

The virtual world indeed provides us with opportunities to do away

with the presence of the erotic other (in the end always an enigma) by

replacing it by various easily controlled digital substitutes. Taken up

with the transhumanist anticipation of the [Singularity,5](#index_split_005.html_p216) the machinic (robots, cyborgs, technological prostheses, etc.) is no longer separate

from our sexual nature. One particularly unexpected and telling instance of this fantasy is found in the glee in which the transhumanists

describe the advent of sexbots, robots that we can sexually interact with, who will be able to provide us with "longevity orgasms":

\[Sexbots will\] be more desirable, patient, eager, and altruistic

than their meat-bag competition, plus they'll be uploaded with

supreme sex-skills from millennia of erotic manuals, archives

and academic experiments, and their anatomy will feature

sexplosive devices ... They'll offer us quadruple-tongued cunni-

lingus, open-throat silky fellatio, deliriously gentle kissing,

transcendent nipple tweaking, g-spot massage & prostate

milking dexterity, plus 2,000 varieties of coital rhythm with

scented lubes. (Huffpost "Sex robot 'longevity orgasms' may help

extend

human

lifespans,

futurist

suggests."

(http:

[www.transhumanity.net,](http://www.transhumanity.net) Nov 7th, 2012 (found 2019)) In this futuristic virtual world, sex becomes a solo, masturbatory act.

There is no need for an "other." In fact, a real other only gets in the

way of the intimate relationship that is portrayed between the virtual

and the self. The virtual, in the form of a sexbot, is the most finely attuned and acquiescent lover the self will ever have. It can draw out

the deepest and most penetrating orgasms, and the self, if it can just

agree to fully give over to its virtual lover, can have these orgasms on

demand, daily, even hourly, if it so desires. We would be then capable

of dosing ourselves with regularly available shots of pleasure, something already pictured in Huxley's *Brave New World* and the social use of Soma.

[]{#index_split_004.html_p199}180 *Depth psychology in the digital age*

The seduction of the sexbot is that it ensures a level of predictability

and control in our relation to the other. But this may very well result

in narrowing the scope and lowering the quality of our subjective lives. The Transhumanist faith in the power of digital technology to

transcend the human is nothing but a skeptical response, a refusal to

acknowledge the loss natural to human existence but also an attempt

to better reality, to replace it. The sexbot is meant to do away with our

dependence on the human other that binds together the complicated

web of human existence and gives substance to life.

We are nowadays moving increasingly toward that fantasy, inviting

the digital into the innermost regions of our sexual lives, thus enormously complicating both love and sexuality. Spike Jonze's film *Her*

\(2013\) strikingly portrays this conundrum. Joaquin Phoenix plays

Theodore, a man who, heartbroken after his marriage ends, purchases

what in the film is advertised as the first artificial intelligence operating system (OS), designed to adapt and evolve like a human being:

an intuitive entity that listens to you, understands you, and knows you. Theodore decides to give his OS a female identity, and he names

her "Samantha," voiced by Scarlett Johansson. He is fascinated by her

ability to learn and grow psychologically, and as the movie progresses,

they fall in love and begin a virtualized sexual relationship.

We remember having experienced the premiere of *Her* with a feeling

of disorientation, conceptually and intuitively; it made no real sense,

yet it captured our imagination. Little did we know that six years later,

as we wrote about it, we would realize that these confusing concepts

and images are now for us so easy to digest, because of the new rea-

lities we have been confronted with in that time. It is no problem, today, to understand Theodore's circumstance, after learning to share

our lives with Siri, Alexa, and so many other artificially intelligent devices, these once unheard of entities that now begin to engage us

and populate our world.

Samantha, the cybernetic consciousness, is fascinated with human

embodiment and longs to have a body [herself.6](#index_split_005.html_p216) Wanting to actualize her desire in the physical act, she yearns to have non-virtual sex with

Theodore. So she contacts Isabella, a young woman who is eager to play the role of a surrogate sexual partner for a human-OS relationship. Theodore does not like the idea; he is content with their wholly

virtual, un-embodied love-making, but reluctantly agrees to the plan

of allowing Isabella to act as Samantha's body, so as to consummate

their love.

When Isabella arrives at Theodore's apartment, she is mute and

emotionally absent, as she prepares to completely give herself over to

Samatha's consciousness. Isabella is eager to escape her own body and

become virtual, whereas Samantha wants to escape her virtuality and

become embodied. Theodore can do neither, and as he tries to make

[]{#index_split_004.html_p200} *Virtuality and the other* 181

love to Samantha's voice, he finds himself unable to surrender to the

illusion that it is Samantha's body he is caressing. Isabella's body, in

its material reality, keeps breaking in on him, interfering with his attempt to ignore it and thus stay inside virtual space. Things break

down on the physical plane and he sends the "real" woman, Isabella,

away in tears.

Isabella symbolizes what is other to the virtual, here in the form of

an embodied self. Her body obstructs Theodore's capacity for dis-

avowal, exposing the limits of the virtual, frustrating its flow. Before

Isabella, Theodore's desire for Samantha was never disrupted. Her

disembodiment freed his imagination and opened up his sexuality.

But when their communion is mediated by a real body, the body of an

other, Theodore finds himself impotent, unable to engage the (virtual)

object of his desire.

In bracketing out those aspects of what may be most problematic in

our relationship to the other, we open up new avenues and possibi-

lities for encounter. In being able to modulate the scope of how much

of the other we are required to contend with, we can see and act in

ways that may have been previously impossible. Something flourished

in Theodore's sexual imagination with Samantha that never came

alive in his former attempts at love and sexuality with a real human

being. Yet the need to control and make the other predictable, losing

the vibrancy and vitality of the unpredictable, is something we all have to contend with today. New possibilities, new problems.

Freud might say that when sexuality is so turned upon itself that difference and contingency are all but abrogated, we are left in a fairly

unstable, perhaps even alarming place. The regression brought about

by the digital echoes a time in our development when we had not yet

discovered ways of bearing our erotic lives that did not rely upon a primitive form of narcissism that kept at bay what was other to the

self. When eros is pirated by the digital, something of this situation is

re-invoked, as the reality of the other no longer serves as a check to

the pure pleasure instinct. We are then more vulnerable to falling into

a purely ego-centered erotics, as we lose our capacity to imagine more

expansive and life-affirming possibilities for bearing sexuality.

In order to emotionally evolve as a human being, it is necessary to

come to terms with the fact of the other as a separate existence, with a

separate center of consciousness and a separate view of the world

[(Benjamin, 1995).](#index_split_005.html_p217) This involves finding good enough ways of binding our narcissism so that we can respect that difference, live with it, and

not cross certain boundaries when it comes to imposing our way of

seeing the world on the other. And nowhere is this more necessary than in dealing with the ungovernability of our sexuality, and the blinding narcissism that rages inside it. [7](#index_split_005.html_p216) In that realm, we must learn to come to terms with the actuality of a "real" other, whose needs and

[]{#index_split_004.html_p201}182 *Depth psychology in the digital age*

desires are different than our own. But when that "real" other is re-

placed by a "virtual" one, what is there to bind the excesses of our narcissism? What guideposts are left to help us distinguish between a

"me" and "not-me" that is so essential for the maturation of our erotic

and sexual lives?

[**3 The absent body**](#index_split_000.html_p12)

A rather broad and unwieldy question is evoked by the phenomenon of

being present with another person virtually, as, for example, when we

FaceTime or Zoom, take part in webinars, or when we participate in virtual communities generally, where our relationship with a group of

people takes place exclusively over the Internet: Does the absence of bodily co-presence in the same space/time coordinates fundamentally

change anything about our encounter with the other? Does it really matter if the body is there, or does something fundamentally change

when the body is absent? This is the aporia of the digital era that we

must face as we are all engaging in a rapidly expanding collective ex-

periment in which more and more of our social, cultural, educational,

and professional interactions are happening in cyberspace.

The question of the body is an especially vexing puzzle for practi-

tioners of psychotherapy and psychoanalysis, as an increasing

number of treatment sessions take place either on the phone or Zoom,

and there is an enormous amount of contention in the field as to what

kind of effects this is having on clinical practice [(Lemma and](#index_split_005.html_p217)

[Caparrotta, 2014; Lemma, 2017; Scharff, 2018)](#index_split_005.html_p217)[8](#index_split_005.html_p216). It also takes on increased urgency when it comes to dating and falling in love. Not only

have dating apps become the central way sex and love is pursued, but

many liaisons that begin in the digital world remain there, sometimes

for the entirety of the relationship. When it comes to sex and romance, the need for the other's actual body seems to be significantly

declining.

In considering the wide spectrum of human relationships, whether

they be between lovers, family members, friends, colleagues, ac-

quaintances, or even strangers, a distinctive bi-personal field is generated when two people come together in the same physical space.

This is a phenomenon of intersubjective life whose early foundations

have been well-mapped out by psychoanalytically-oriented infant

research (Stern, 1985; Lachmann and Beebe, 2014). There is a pro-

found exchange at the psycho-somatic level of experiencing in the

context of the complex and emotionally rich dialogue that happens

between infants and parents. We grow and become our unique selves

as a result of these early encounters that are grounded in the preverbal

intimacy of close bodily relating. Early contact with the other's

embodied presence serves as the placeholder for the desiring self.

[]{#index_split_004.html_p202} *Virtuality and the other* 183

The kind of relating that we do in the digital world, however, is noteworthy for its absence of embodied contact. We can hear and see

the other; indeed, their visual appearance is often brought into

sharper focus than in our everyday perceptions. There is still plenty of

presence, as the other on my screen is someone we can engage with in

conversation, as if they were in the same room, sitting next to us. Yet,

at the same time, we cannot touch them, or smell them, or empiri-

cally register their physical presence; screened out, it is kept at a dis-

tance. We can tell, of course, if they are suffering or in pain, for the

camera picks up the obvious visible signs of whatever they might be

physically experiencing. Telemedicine, for instance, is a burgeoning field, no doubt, in part, because of the immediate feedback it provides

about the state of the other's body, to say nothing of its practicality.

With these new virtual developments, that sense a doctor might have

of being attuned to a bodily reality that exists beyond words and vi-

sual surfaces when sitting in the same room with a patient, is lost.

We would never expect to Zoom with our dog back home and be able

to establish the kind of contact we have when sharing a physical space

with it. Our relationship with an animal is rooted exclusively in the embodied encounter, as it is between parent and infant. The dog cannot

perceive us, recognize our voice, our face on the screen, let alone our smell. So no matter what we do from our side -- we can't stroke them,

snuggle with them, sense their very discernible smell, or feel the attu-

nement of our breathing patterns -- nothing could make that relation-

ship come alive. The absence of our physical bodies to each other, in fact, the virtuality of our presence in this new space precludes any contact with other (non-human) beings. Even a mosquito would not try

to bite us!

When we Zoom, although not many of the usual sensations in

human relating make it through the screen, there is so much clear and

sharp verbal and visual information that the existential pulse of em-

bodied life is not really missed. Rather than an open field of percep-

tion, where we are empathically attuned to the sentience of the other,

screen-mediated relations take us out of our body and into the visual

processing dimensions of the mind where sensations quickly become

concepts. In speaking of the primarily visual experience of being in front of a screen, [Virilio (1995)](#index_split_005.html_p217) writes, "It is the eyeball that now englobes man's entire body" (p. 148). "Come over here and take a look at this," is the plea of whoever is holding a smartphone and wants to show you something. The eyeball establishes itself over the

entire perceptual field. Here the eye's dominion parallels the "I" in cyberspace englobing the entire world. The digital subject, as we have

seen, can be thought of as existing at the center of a mini-universe,

but here we want to notice that part of what makes it easier to

[]{#index_split_004.html_p203}184 *Depth psychology in the digital age*

hegemonically flow through such a universe is that the body, both ours and the other's, is no longer there, mucking things up.

This absence of materiality is what maintains the frictionless flow of

virtual life. We love being able to Skype or text in lieu of actually encountering someone. It makes things run so much smoother. But in

that positivity, the awareness of what is so irresistibly appealing about

being able to see and relate to someone without really having to confront their suffering body in the same physical space as ours, is repressed. In the name of convenience, expediency, and the wonders

of our technological subversions, we are apt to deny that there is another motive at work. Think of the quick, mad-dash entries and

even quicker exits the digital affords us. The cumbersomeness of our

body in relation to another's, that complicated mixture of intimacy

and responsibility, affinity and aversion, is forestalled. At any moment, whenever we want, we can just click off and the "other" instantly disappears. With this act comes an assuaging feeling of being

released from her hold on us. The cool and aloof act of clicking or swiping off, ending the session, moving on, has now displaced what

used to be the adrenalized charge of hanging up on someone. The

digital provides new and more ubiquitous forms for modulating the

level of contact we desire.

This set of reflections about the difference between bodily and

virtual co-presence ultimately brings us to the question of human

aloneness. It has always been the case that to combat the feeling of

loneliness, you find people to hang out with and spend time to-

gether. That's why we like having families where there is always

someone around whose bodily presence engages us and provides a

sense of profound and soothing comfort. What does it mean, then,

to try to deal with our existential isolation by appealing to the other's virtual presence, where this more familiar way of taking

comfort is transformed? The virtual world is changing the ways in which we think about what it means to be alone. [Winnicott (1958)](#index_split_005.html_p217)

saw the capacity to be alone as a developmental achievement rooted

in how the growing child learned to be alone in the presence of the

(m)other. Does something fundamentally change when it is a virtual

other? This question of the relationship between digital technology

and human aloneness creates a confounding pharmacological

paradox. On the one hand, because of our devices, being by oneself is

so much more tolerable; in close proximity to our smartphones, it feels like we are never truly alone. Whether it's Siri\'s voice answering

our questions or the instantaneous immediacy and permanently

available connection that happens on our social networks, they keep

us company and provide comfort. But on the other hand, we have

less and less capacity to be alone. We can't tolerate it. The slightest

hint of it makes us panic. And this is especially evident when we are

[]{#index_split_004.html_p204} *Virtuality and the other* 185

without a device, stranded, as it were, with ourselves, and only

ourselves. [9](#index_split_005.html_p216)

In a commercial for Amazon Echo, a family is seen leaving Nana's

house, hugs and kisses and sad good-byes: "We're going to miss you so

much, I wish you didn't have to go." The scene changes and Nana is

all alone, except for her cat. The doorbell rings and she bends down to

pick up a box that her family has sent containing the new Echo, which looks like a common desk clock. A card instructs her to tell Alexa to call home, which she does, and suddenly the four family members are there again on the round-shaped clock turned screen.

"Surprise!" they yell, and Nana is no longer alone and, we intuit, no

longer lonely, as excited, animated voices and faces fill the room. As

we watch this brief drama unfold, it's hard not to imagine the next

moment, when the conversation between Nana and her virtual family

empties out, turns flat, and the family switches off and Nana is left alone again in her house with her cat. In offering her something that

has never existed before in human history, the virtual presence of her

loved ones now on the screen, is Nana's relationship to her solitude

forever changed? Can the Echo, or any other device, solve the

problem of human aloneness? Or is it all just a gimmick?

[**4 Facing the real other**](#index_split_000.html_p12)

In "The Use of an Object," [Winnicott (1971)](#index_split_005.html_p218) offers a compelling account of how the infant moves from the position of experiencing the

other as a creation of the self (the subjective object) into that in which

the reality of the other as a separate center of consciousness can be psychologically integrated (the object objectively perceived). An apt image for precisely framing this issue occurs at the very start of his essay:

Two babies are feeding at the breast. One is feeding on the self, since the breast and the baby have not yet become (for the baby)

separate phenomena. The other is feeding from an other-than-me

source. (1971, p. 89)

Here, in bold relief, we are confronted with the question of how, at

the earliest beginnings, one makes contact with and takes in what is

other to the self. From what is visually present in this image of two

nursing babies, it is impossible to know which infant is feeding on

the self and which from a source outside of itself. We may well imagine being in the same quandary when we see two young people,

side by side, instagramming with friends and being uncertain whe-

ther there is a difference in how each of them is relating to the other.

How would we know who was narcissistically feeding on the self and

[]{#index_split_004.html_p205}186 *Depth psychology in the digital age*

who was being nourished from an other-than-me source? This is

what makes it so difficult to ascertain, from a purely behavioral standpoint, what kind of relationship any one person has to her

device. The internal, emotional dynamics surrounding their use is as

concealed to the outside observer as the difference between the two

nursing babies.

Early on, in what Winnicott terms "object relating," the infant, in a

state of subjective omnipotence, relates to his mother "ruthlessly."

The mother here is a subjective object, wholly under the infant's mental control. A transition occurs when frustration at the inevitable

failure of the mother to exactly meet the infant's need reaches a cer-

tain pitch and the infant damages the internal image he has of his mother by attacking her in fantasy. The mother's task is to hold the

situation over time, so that the infant can see, on a moment-to-

moment basis, that she is different from the internal mother towards

whom his frustration and aggression is being directed. When the

object is destroyed internally, in fantasy, and yet survives externally

(the actual mother not retaliating or abandoning the baby) the infant

comes to the recognition that the object is not subject to his mental

control. A new state of "object usage" emerges, which revolves around

the infant's dawning awareness of the limitations of his all-out destructive attacks, resulting in a new mode for discovering the externality of the world. [10](#index_split_005.html_p216) Developmentally, the infant breaks out of a state of omnipotent fantasy, where the world is magically under his

control, and begins to come to terms with the actuality of a separate

object.

In one of the most renowned passages in the psychoanalytic lit-

erature, [Winnicott (1971)](#index_split_005.html_p218) vividly describes this movement from object relating (feeding on the self) to object usage (being nourished by

an other-than-me source).

The subject says to the object: I destroyed you', and the object is

there to receive the communication. From now on the subject

says: 'Hullo object!' 'I destroyed you.' 'I love you.' 'You have value

for me because of your survival of my destruction of you.' 'While I

am loving you I am all the time destroying you in (unconscious)

fantasy.' (p. 90)

Michael [Eigen (1999),](#index_split_005.html_p217) in his elaboration of this passage, offers an astute characterization of what it means to make genuine contact with an other:

What is happening is the 'continuous' destruction of the fantasy

objects (the introjective-projective world) and the birth of the real

object, the other subject outside all of one's psychic web-spinning.

[]{#index_split_004.html_p206} *Virtuality and the other* 187

It is an all out, nothing held back, movement of the self-and-other

feeling past representational barriers, past psychic films and shells,

a floating freely in a joyous shock of difference. (p. 8)

How is our relationship to the other affected by the kind of virtuality

that springs forth from the digital? Could we say it becomes "an all

out, nothing held back, movement of the self-and-other feeling past

representational barriers, past psychic films and shells, a floating freely in a joyous shock of difference" (Eigen, p. 8)? Surely, we can see

it this way when we consider the myriad forms of experience that are

available in cyberspace that promote new and expansive modes of

relationality. As we encounter the other in the present tense mode of

the "digital now", there is a receptive immediacy to the interchange

that dramatically breaks down representational barriers. But we must

also consider how the digital blocks access to the other. If the self is

constantly being created anew by psychic fantasy bumping up against

the "real" otherness of the object, and the virtualization of the "other"

erodes that realness, then, are we not more vulnerable to being pushed back into a world of subjective objects, objects, there to satisfy

our needs and sustain the projections of our fantasies?

[**5 Facing the digital other**](#index_split_000.html_p12)

If, indeed, one of the vulnerabilities of digital life is the tendency it

has to propel us in the direction of object relating, where the other primarily serves a mirroring function for the self, then we must learn

to contend with the omnipotence that is intrinsic to this position. The

self that relates to the other as a subjective object collapses the tension between inner and outer reality, such that there is a near total absorption of the other into the self, as the mother was assimilated by

the infant at the earliest stages [(Benjamin, 1995).](#index_split_005.html_p217) Bearing in mind the narcissism involved there, let us return to the myth.

Narcissus was transfixed by his own image in the pond, yet he was

not aware that he himself was the object of his transfixion. Narcissus

could be described as a "monadic self ... encapsulated in a closed system, the omnipotent mind ... \[who\] cannot reach something

outside" [(Benjamin, 1995,](#index_split_005.html_p217) p. 91). This would accord with the more classical reading of the Narcissus myth, as we saw in [Chapter 3](#index_split_001.html_p82) But there is something else at work here, for as Narcissus adoringly gazes

at himself in the pond, he mistakenly believes he is falling in love with a real other. He does not recognize that it is he who is the object

of his own reflection. Here the false consciousness of Narcissus, this

mis-recognizing moment where the self is assumed to be an actual

other, exemplifies how our own concealed narcissism is masked by

[]{#index_split_004.html_p207}188 *Depth psychology in the digital age*

the virtual. This is akin to [Freud's (1900)](#index_split_005.html_p217) description of the inherent egoism of dreams.

Dreams are completely egoistic. Whenever my own ego does not

appear in the content of the dream, but only some extraneous

person, I may safely assume that my own ego lies concealed by

identification, behind this other person. (pp. 322--323)

For Freud, dreams are illustrative of the narcissistic illusion that when we think we are encountering or engaging with someone or

something that we experience as "other," we may actually only be

meeting our own projections. Does the digital exacerbate this fun-

damentally human tendency to collapse the difference between self

and other?

Byung Chul Han, considering depression to be an outgrowth of this

collapse, answers in the affirmative when he writes:

The Internet is a space where above all you encounter yourself.

The other person is long gone. Depression is a disease of the

narcissistic self that has been set adrift from relationships, that has

lost all sense of what is different. The virtual space is a hell of sameness. [(Tollman, 2011)](#index_split_005.html_p217)

One common denominator of all of the technological devices with

which we populate the most intimate spaces of our lives, from Siri and

Alexa to our smartphones and iPads, is how they so adroitly reflect back and thus enhance the self. This corresponds to one of the main

functions of what [Kohut (1971)](#index_split_005.html_p217) calls a self-object, crucial to early development, where the parent or caregiver mirrors back to the child

her qualities and accomplishments, thus laying the foundation for a

healthy source of narcissism in the construction of the [self.11](#index_split_005.html_p216) In other words, in order to arrive later in life with a foundational feeling of self-worth and self-esteem, it is essential to go through a period of development in which the grandiosity and omnipotence of the self is reflected back to the child by a loving parent. [Winnicott (1948)](#index_split_005.html_p217) gives the example of the young girl who says, "I can fly" and instead of the

father saying "No you can't," he picks her up and flies her around the

room like a bird. But one cannot remain in this mode of devel-

opmentally appropriate illusion forever. Without some kind of tran-

sition toward object-usage, what starts off as the psychological

necessity of a certain mode of self-expansive omnipotence sours into a

narcissistic entrapment where the world has to keep feeding one's

illusions for the sake of the self's coherence. The digital, we might say,

reawakens those early strivings for omnipotence and the constant

need to place one's "self" at the center of all things. In this light,

[]{#index_split_004.html_p208} *Virtuality and the other* 189

we might describe the ubiquity of mirroring provided by our tech-

nologies as a Kohutian world of self-objects run wild.

As we move through our digital days, we are immersed in tech-

nologies that offer a ceaseless flood of mirroring, from the specially targeted ads that algorithmically inflame my acquisitive desires, to the

messages in my inbox, all tantalizingly addressed to me, to the flurry

of likes awaiting me in response to my most recent tweets or Facebook

or Instagram posts, to the objects of my desire that come straight from

the screen to my front door. Siri and Alexa answer my questions, as-

suage my concerns, and, in their omnisciently soothing voices, I feel

as if they are there exclusively to help me. I turn on my GPS, and the

coordinates and location of where I am currently situated become the

center of the world. We now rely upon these external devices, as much, and in many cases more than, the actual people in our life, to

maintain what Kohut would describe as the functioning of a cohe-

sive self.

Zadie [Smith (2015, Youtube)](#index_split_005.html_p217) provides a cogent analysis of how this constant need for recognition impacts our relation to the other. She

points to the difference between the kind of performativity that oc-

curs in the world of social media and everyday relational life:

The weird thing about Facebook is that everybody on it is like

their own mini-celebrity. That's what it turns you into. You have

fans, you are constantly giving them up-dates, you are like a little

celebrity. And the relation, no matter what anyone says, is pretty

much one way. And then you are voyeuristic about other people's

celebrity profiles, and how many friends they have. It's one way.

\[Yet\] while being relational, in real life you have to deal with other

people. You have to have some kind of relationship with them

and you can't just perform yourself. You have to look at them,

look at them in the eye, which has become increasingly difficult

for young people. On the Internet it's all self-revelation.

The digital exacerbates our yearning to be seen by the other, to be

mirrored by them, intensifying a wholly ordinary need into a fre-

netic and unquenchable desire. If a parent's face is the infant's first

mirror, our phones are the second (and, in many instances that are of

a growing concern for the fate of the child in the digital age, the first). Hence, the digital becomes a dynamic reflector of the self that,

unlike a parent, never stops giving. It thus aggravates and perhaps hyperrealizes this very basic human need for recognition. Today, we

demand to be mirrored with a ferocity second to nothing else in our

lives, including how we love. The effectiveness of social media, as a

finely tuned instrument for "self-revelation" becomes the means by

which we think we can finally conquer this profound and affective

[]{#index_split_004.html_p209}190 *Depth psychology in the digital age*

hunger for a mirroring recognition that is there from the earliest beginnings and seems now to have become an omnipresent force in

our lives.

Searching, checking, updating and posting, and the ubiquitous

loving or liking become the dominant currency of all social relations.

We are forced to confront the issue of how mirror-hungry we actually

are when we consider that the presentation of self on our social media

accounts is not really us, but an embellished version of how we want

to appear to others so that we can receive the maximum amount of

recognition and acknowledgment. This unconscious, at times despe-

rate, drive to be seen spurs us on to craft the perfect persona -- sexy,

witty, charming, serious, funny, and so on -- one that will get us the

most likes, the most followers.

There is a very poignant scene in Bo Burnham's (2018) movie *Eighth*

*Grade* in which the young protagonist of the story, a girl who is a week away from her junior high school graduation, is sitting at the dinner

table with her father, earbuds plugged in, scrolling through her

smartphone. On the eve of this momentous event, her father wants to

share some important reflections he has about the positive changes that she has made in her life so he asks her to take out her earbuds so

that he can speak. In her initial refusal, we see him desperately entangled in a fight to become a mirroring self-object, as he continues to

insist that they talk. She finally relents and listens for a minute or two, but what the scene makes abundantly clear is that there is absolutely

no competition between the father's recognizing (albeit awkward and

somewhat sappy) words, and the kind of mirroring that she is re-

ceiving from her phone, the self-object *par excellence.* She is impatient with his offerings and cannot wait one moment longer to get back to it.

Who can forgo the urge to click on and enter this miniaturized

universe in which all of its denizens ultimately circle around *you?*

Who can resist that reliable dose of self-recognition that is always there, waiting, that sumptuous gift to the self that never stops giving?

But the paradox is that with this intensification of mirroring, we all

feel ever more desperate to be seen. It's difficult to discern whether the

phone's camera and its link to our social media diet is a symptom of

that desperation or its cause. Either way, the digital has become an unruly pharmakon as we carry this insatiable demand to be recognized, while at the same time having a diminished capacity for offering in return the kind of recognition that does not unconsciously

enact a pernicious *quid pro quo*, a tit for tat: I recognize you so that you will recognize me.

This is the intersubjective conundrum of a mode of object relating

that rests upon an exchange of mutually enhancing recognition,

which never gets beyond what I need the other to do for me, and what

[]{#index_split_004.html_p210} *Virtuality and the other* 191

I must do for the other to keep the attachment going. There is no way

to get outside of myself and no way to get inside what is truly other

about the other. What Winnicott calls object-usage, as we have seen,

is a way out of this trap. It is the process by which we break through

the bubble of self-referentiality and encounter a reality beyond our own mind. In terms of the dynamics of the Virtual Within, the

transition to object-usage is that moment when the omnipotence,

narcissism, and powerful need to perform the self that forms the

building blocks of our inner virtuality is fundamentally pierced by something truly outside it.

Marion [Milner (1957),](#index_split_005.html_p217) who wrote a great deal about the process of self-development in relation to creativity, speaks about this transition

as a re-emergence "into a new division of the me-not-me, one in

which there is more of the 'me' in the 'not-me', and more of the 'not-

me' in the 'me'" (pp. 154--155). Digital life does very well with the first

half of Milner's equation, allowing a surplus of "me" to penetrate the

"not-me," but very poorly with the second, because as the "me" ex-

pands in the digital, it has less and less tolerance for "not-me"

experience, for the other in his or her irreducible separateness. As

[Zizek (1997)](#index_split_005.html_p218) writes:

What tends to get lost in virtual communities is this very abyss of

the other, this very background of undecidability: in the 'wired

universe', the very opaqueness of the other tends to evapo-

rate. (p. 166)

And, as we have repeatedly seen, the narcissistic cocoon offered to

us by the digital, frequently serves as a place of refuge from the not-me.

Because the virtual "other" is so intimately interwoven with our

subjectivity -- yet we are hypnotized by its materialization as something

outside ourselves -- we become blind to the many ways in which our

virtual interactions are a reflection of how we want to shape reality, how we want it to conform and bend back toward us. This is what we

have been depicting as the hidden erotics of the virtual self, how drawn

in we are by the fact that virtualizing the other frees the object to be-

come the ultimate *speculum* of and for the self. If there is an unconscious drive toward the virtual, it may very well have to do with this

newly gained "positionality" that conquers the abyss of the other.

Perhaps the critical challenge of our times is to discover new ways of

relating to the digital that lead us in the direction of object-usage, thus opening up pathways for bringing more of the "not-me" into the

"me," more of the world into the self. This involves learning how to

tolerate and bear the encounter with the radical undecidability of the

other, somehow holding in check the strong urge that arises today to

[]{#index_split_004.html_p211}192 *Depth psychology in the digital age*

evaporate that opaqueness in the digital haze of our devices. We spoke

of this in [Chapter 5](#index_split_002.html_p130) as the maturation of our relationship to the virtual. In surrendering to the "not me," we experience a curtailing of

our omnipotence. The virtual is no longer something I subjectively possess; rather, it reflects an openness to making contact with, and be

contacted by, its transformative force.

[**Coda**](#index_split_000.html_p12)

The *Black Mirror* episode U.S.S. *Calister* poignantly illustrates the impact the digital pharmakon is having on how we bear the differences

within ourselves as well as those between us and others. It tells the story of Robert Daly, an introverted computer programming genius,

who is portrayed as a psychologically damaged man with a limited

capacity to engage with real others. We see him being treated disdainfully by his office co-workers, and cruelly degraded by the man who co-founded the computer gaming company where they work,

James Watson. Watson flagrantly bullies and humiliates Daly in front

of his peers. But Daly takes revenge on them all by stealing their DNA

and creating digital clones of them, which he imprisons inside a si-

mulated Star Trek--like space adventure game. Alone at night, in the

isolated chamber of his apartment, he enters the game as Captain of

the Starship, leading his crew on sci-fi space missions to conquer the

evil enemy. His crew, of course, are the very cloned office workers, including Watson, who have so terribly mistreated him in actual life.

The game offers Daly the perfect space for revenge, for not only can he

act out his most aggressive and sadistic impulses toward them, but he has them trapped, completely under his control, as clones on the

Starship in an infinite, digital forever.

As an alternative to what we might consider the more typical re-

lationship between internal objects (those psychic presences that live

inside us, constituting our unconscious fantasy and dream life) and external objects (the actual people that we encounter in daily life), what this episode brings into dramatic focus is Daly's intense psychological engagement with virtual objects that are neither real nor

fantasy. The people he interacts with everyday at work are trans-

formed into characters that inhabit his private virtual reality world.

What's interesting here is how this portrayal of digital virtuality mi-

mics the virtuality of the psyche. Freud's concept of day residues ( *Tagesreste)* -- as the impressions of the people we have been psychically involved with during the day awakening in the mind during the

night -- points to a very similar virtualizing process.

Without having to steal anyone's DNA, our dreams produce psychic

clones of the other, the *dramatis personae* of our nightly dreamscapes.

So what kind of dream is Daly having when the tumultuous

[]{#index_split_004.html_p212} *Virtuality and the other* 193

unfoldings of his instinctual and affective life actualize themselves in

a realm with many of the same characteristics of his internal object

world, which is now populated by virtual clones? The digital-virtual is

nothing if not a completely new way of dreaming, a form of imagi-

native engagement that we haven't seen before, and one that is very

hard for us, conceptually, to comprehend.

Jessica [Benjamin (1995)](#index_split_005.html_p217) delineates the developmental trajectory of how we come to relate to the fact of the other's independent consciousness and how we, as separate subjects, come to recognize each other as equivalent centers of experience. Along the way, there is often a

breakdown into what she names a "doer-or-done-to complementarity,"

where we cannot overcome the impulse to either objectify the other or

find ourselves objectified in relation to him -becoming the doer or be-

coming the done-to. This is a very common form of splitting that can

potentially dominate so much of our relational life.

In his real life in the office, Daly always appears in the role of being

done-to, a victim of Watson and the others. But on the U.S.S. *Calister*, he flips the script and becomes the towering figure of the captain, doing to

the other what was done to him, though now in a perversely ex-

aggerated and aggrandized form. No longer emotionally withdrawn and

wounded, he is their supreme commander, completely in charge. Here,

we see the pharmacological nature of the digital restructuring the virtual-actual dynamics in such a way that the virtual becomes Daly's compensation for what he suffers in real life. Once ensconced inside his

private, virtual world, he becomes the victimizer, overcoming the daily

onslaught of victimization he experiences at the office.

The ethics of this script-flipping are extremely knotty; they cast a pall over the "positive" uses of the virtual to make up for what we cannot get in the real, as in the many examples we have explored up

to this point. Here, what happens to Daly's mind and behavior, the

extreme ways in which his personality changes when he leaves the

real and enters the virtual, exposes the potential pathology of this kind of virtual compensation. For example, after Watson tears into him in the office for not completing an assignment on time, Daly hurriedly wraps up his day and rushes back home to re-enter the

game. One moment Watson is chewing him out, publicly shaming

and humiliating him, and the next, Daly is viciously attacking

Watson for failing on the space mission. He kicks him to the ground,

savagely beats him and then demands that Watson kneel before him

so that he can use his prone body as a footrest. The digital grants Daly

total control over the other. Because the crew is trapped in his own

secret, self-created, hermetically-sealed virtual chamber, he can do with them what he pleases with no "real" consequences.

The virtual then becomes a territory freed from all ethical con-

siderations, allowing Daly to actualize his sadism without bounds.

[]{#index_split_005.html}

[]{#index_split_005.html_p213}194 *Depth psychology in the digital age*

Its most extreme expression happens in his cloning of Watson's be-

loved young son, Tommy. He brings him aboard the starship and

forces Watson to watch, as he launches the boy into space without a

spacesuit, to see him freeze to death and crack up like a porcelain doll.

Because he possesses his son's DNA, Watson knows that Daly can

bring Tommy back at any moment and make him witness again and

again, a mad proliferation of scenarios, repeating the torture in infinitely varied ways. Not daring to step out of line, Watson is subjected

to Daly's need to devise ever crueler and more horrible scenarios to remain in control.

Here we can usefully contrast the limits of sadism in everyday life

and the limitlessness of its actualization in virtual space. Our sadistic

impulses toward others and equally toward ourselves, have a very

powerful charge. Even though things can and do, on occasion, get out

of hand, there are built-in limits, safeguards against destructively acting on these impulses. Rather than acting them out in shared

public space, our interior representational world, the inner space of the psyche, is where we attempt to contain them. For Freud, this was

one of the functions of the dream in that it allows psychic expression

of our aggressive and sexual impulses so that they do not have to be

split-off and projected back into the relational world with others.

Another conception of containment is offered [by Winnicott (1945)](#index_split_005.html_p217)

with his idea that the subjective world of fantasy needs to be brought

into balance with external reality:

External reality has brakes on it, and can be studied and known,

and, in fact, fantasy is only tolerable at full blast when objective

reality is appreciated as well. The subjective has tremendous value

but is so alarming and magical that it cannot be enjoyed except as

a parallel to the objective. (p. 153)

Virtual space infinitely expands the reaches of one's individual fantasy life. There are no ends to how far we can go in the virtual world.

There is no anchor in outside reality, no balancing of the subjective

and the objective, because the virtual is freed from any real-world effects. It creates its own self-perpetuating container that collapses that tension, and thus activates in us something that, in this story, takes us to the edge of horror. Watson is extremely abusive to Daly in

their interactions at the office; he is a very sadistic man. But nothing

he does to Daly even approaches the constant threat of Daly's forcing

him to bear witness to his child being viciously tortured.

In the virtual we can always find a precise digital image to intensify

whatever we are enraged about in the world, as we are now granted a

near total and immediate access to an interactive archive of our shared

[]{#index_split_005.html_p214} *Virtuality and the other* 195

collective imagination. But it goes one step further, allowing us to live

out the most extreme aspects of our impulses with a simple click.

Sadism and masochism, hatred and aggression are magnified in the

absence of flesh-and-blood "real" others in the virtual. But it is the face-to-face encounter with the other, to use Levinas' language, absent

in the virtual, that is at the basis of our ethical lives. What form of ethics, then, should be required of the virtual self? Does it need to conform to the same ethical standards as any other self? Or, do its actions in a space that does not have any real world consequences, demand that we think of it as morally neutral?

For Daly, it takes a demonic turn, as the virtual frenetically feeds his

angry and omnipotent revenge fantasies. We watch the unfolding of

what eventually becomes his total identification with a malicious and

dictatorial ego that prevents the virtual object from becoming anything other than an evacuative repository for his own hatred and rage.

The crew of the starship, these digital copies of his actual office mates,

are portrayed as sexless, unthinking and unfeeling beings, who

cannot make a claim on their own subjectivity. Rather, they are forced

to stay in role and act in limited and predictable ways whenever Daly

re-enters the game. He becomes increasingly cruel and punishing,

only interested in the continued expansion of his power and ag-

grandizement. If anyone on the crew steps out of line, refuses to narcissistically mirror his god-like greatness, he zaps them and instantly transforms them into the embodiment of the evil-other they

are there to fight, a horrifying and monstrous creature, that becomes

both punishment and threat, warning the others of a similar fate if they fail to submit.

The story takes a dramatic turn when Daly steals the DNA of a newly

hired programmer Nannette Cole, and brings her into the game. Unlike

the others, she continues to think the thoughts and feel the feelings inherent to her actual human self. It is electrifying to watch Cole's refusal to play along the moment she enters the ship. Ultimately, she sees

through Daly's game, and exploits her familiarity with his "real" life to

defeat him and free themselves from his virtual prison.

The play of virtual and real in Cole's engagement with virtual reality

could not be more different than Daly's. Rather than turning it into a

cocoon of revenge, she finds a way of relating to this virtual space that

does not feed her omnipotence, but instead triggers a series of latent

possibilities in herself that, in the end, brings about an empowering

psychological transformation. In actual life, she is meek and fearful,

unable to tap into her own agency, whereas in the virtual she not only

discovers the innate strength of her own mind, but her capacity for

leadership and ingenuity.

We see her on her first day at work relating to Daly in an idealizing

way, as she so admires his programming genius and the stunningly

[]{#index_split_005.html_p215}196 *Depth psychology in the digital age*

intricate code he writes. In her deferential awe, she shrinks in her own

being, losing sight of her capacities. We learn that Cole was victimized

by her former boss's bullying behaviors. When she realizes that she is

Daly's virtual prisoner, she is no longer a victim as her reverence turns

to rage, and she out-programs and out-foxes him, claiming her bril-

liance, and renouncing her idealized notion of him.

Daly is interacting in a one-dimensional realm, where objects are

denuded of their otherness. In the hermeticism of such a space, he does not have to put anything of himself on the line. Because he is

captain, always sovereign, holding the reins of the virtual in his hands, he doesn't have to risk anything. He never has to deal with the

consequences and the self-exposure to someone else actually experi-

encing him behaving in this way. There are no "real" witnesses in his

virtual game until Cole comes along.

She, in contrast, has something real on the line that she is fighting

for, that is, the fate of her cloned self and the threat of its perpetual

suffering in Daly's virtual hell. Rather than demanding false praise from the crew, as Daly does, Cole becomes the legitimate captain, matching her mind against his, as she hacks his code and, at the very

same time, exposes the pathological game that he is playing. Cole's engagement in the virtual makes her aware of unlived aspects of her

own strength and power, and furthermore, makes the crew aware of

their complicity in Daly's demonic virtual world. The digital virtual produces in her a non-disavowing and non self-aggrandizing ego,

whereas for Daly it is the very opposite.

Daly's immersion in the virtual world creates an untenable split

between virtual life and real life. The further he can keep them apart,

the better he can actualize his psychic fantasies. In his actual life, he is completely isolated, deadened in his relation to others, without access

to his own thoughts and feelings. Only inside the game can he find

himself. This severe splitting is symbolized by the sign on his apart-

ment door which says KEEP OUT. The story of Cole, on the other

hand, reveals a profound and intimate connection between virtual

and real. Waking up in the virtual, she sees through its dream-like haze, thus avoiding the radical splitting of virtual from real that plagues Daly. Paradoxically, virtual reality allows her to heal that split, as her own inner virtuality is activated and she is able to live something

out in the virtual that is not yet possible in actual life.

The effects of the virtual on the structures of our relational lives are

both creative and expansive, negating and exploitative. As is so well

illustrated in this episode, it is essential that we pharmacologically avoid polarizing and thus splitting these effects into their usual pro and con reductions.

[1](#index_split_004.html_p188) In his paper "The Splitting of the Ego" [(Freud, 1900),](#index_split_005.html_p217) that horrifying external perception is the little's boy's awareness of the reality of castration when he sees the female genitalia.

[2](#index_split_004.html_p188) Humphrey Morris's (2016) cogent analysis of Freud's concept of disavowal in his paper "The Analyst's Offer" has been crucial to our understanding of the term ( *Journal of the American Psychoanalytic Association*, 64(6): 1173--1187).

[3](#index_split_004.html_p191) "In \[Laplanche's\] 'generalized seduction theory' all parent-infant communication has its inevitable traumatic edge: passionate, exciting, un-translatable erotic messages from the adult other break into the infant,

are repressed or disavowed, and lose their context in any communicative,

(Morris, 2016, p. 1178).

[4](#index_split_004.html_p197) The most obvious example is the profuse availability of pornographic material in the net. The latest statistics is that Pornhub has nearly 120 million visitors per day, more than Netflix, Amazon Prime, etc., combined.

[5](#index_split_004.html_p198) The "Singularity" is a term used by transhumanists to describe the moment in the future where there will be no clear distinction anymore be-

[6](#index_split_004.html_p199) In Wim Wenders (1987) film *Wings of Desire* this longing is felt by Angels in their contemplation of human existence, suggesting perhaps the difficulty or tension implicit in extricating the concept of consciousness from the bodily.

[7](#index_split_004.html_p200) One image, found in Greek mythology, of opening the erotic to the world of imagination and reflection rather than literal action is that of Odysseus blindfolded and tied to the mast of his ship, where he is able to hear and

be affected by the siren's call without being able to literally act on it.

[8](#index_split_004.html_p201) This debate, of course, has intensified since the pandemic, given that therapy is taking place almost exclusively now on virtual platforms.

[9](#index_split_004.html_p204) In the *New York Times*, Richard A. [Friedman (2020)](#index_split_005.html_p217) writes: "Consider the following experiment: Researchers asked a group of people to spend just

15 minutes in a room and instructed them to entertain themselves with

their own thoughts. They were also given the opportunity to self-

administer a negative stimulus in the form of a small electric shock.

Strikingly, 67 percent of men and 25 percent of women found being alone

with their thoughts so unpleasant that they chose negative stimulation over no stimulation (p. 9)."

[10](#index_split_004.html_p205) There is always confusion as to why Winnicott speaks of usage as a development progression following relating, since it has such a utilitarian,

even machiavellian sound to it. He picks the word to emphasize that we

cannot truly make "use" of an object, a person, a thing, that we are invested in, in other words, work with it and engage it in a fruitful way, until we have gone through this process of destruction and survival.

[11](#index_split_004.html_p207) Kohut also speaks of idealization and twinship as the two other functions of the self-object, both of which have implications for digital life, but here we are exclusively focusing on mirroring.

[**Introduction to Part IV**](#index_split_000.html_p12)

We begin this fourth part of the book with Ortega y Gasset's conception of human beings as *ontological centaurs*, creatures caught between the trascendental and the empirical, suspended between a body

that roots us to matter and a mind that extends us to the virtual.

Technology emerges from this paradox; it enacts a radically ambiva-

lent impulse to both acknowledge and disavow time, death and

mortality. The mythological figure of Pygmalion, who preferred the

perfect statue to the goddess he loved, serves as a lens through which

to understand how our relationship to the finiteness of human

existence is fundamentally shaped by technology.

We examine the recurrent sensation that we have been considering,

that the digital modulation involves a flattening of reality, and recognize there the idea of the simulacrum as false copy that we saw in

[Part II.](#index_split_001.html_p80) But we also consider, in detail as well, the many unexpected positive experiences that are already familiar in the virtual, where we

are indeed left with the impression that we are experiencing an upgrade

of the "real." In the end, it becomes clear that every modulation--

digital or scribal, electronic or mechanical -- must always leave out and

yet depend on the non-representational ground of all modulations

from which human virtuality arises.

What our pharmacological stance to the digital brings us to con-

template is a world of incessant change and movement, a flow of

virtualities actualized at every present moment, only to be left behind for an equally transitory new emergence. The most surprising discovery is

that -- once we attain a perspective that does not oppose but holds on to

its paradoxical tension -- the digital becomes, as in the end all technol-

ogies do, a reminder of the illusory nature of every image, whether technical or sensible, virtual or real. The technical representation thus becomes a means to arrive at the limits of representation, and technology a way to face mortality.

[---Agamben (2002)](#index_split_001.html_p58)

[**Prelude**](#index_split_000.html_p12)

If philosophy is a preparation for dying, as Socrates said, its mission

would be to combat our impulse to ignore mortality, and teach us instead to connect to its reality as often as necessary, to make it ever

more familiar as it approaches. It could counter our impulse to stop

life, detain its movement, and control the uncontrollable, which we

have seen propels the technological drive. Philosophy would then

need to renounce the Pygmalionic search for perfection and its

commitment to permanence and immutability that has shaped our

culture; we might then become able to keep open the unpredictability

of the sensible and acknowledge and embrace mortality as an

ineluctable, constitutive reality.

Upon seeing Aphrodite's bare ankle, stunned and overwhelmed by

the emotions that the vision provokes in him, Pygmalion flees and takes refuge in his workshop, where he immediately and obsessively

begins to sculpt an image of the naked goddess. Once in the presence

of the perfect image he had sculpted, he falls in love only to discover

her frigid incapacity to respond to him and, as the myth tells us, it is

the ensuing suffering he undergoes that moves the real goddess to pity

and bring the statue to life.

Technology seen as an attempt to protect ourselves from the over-

whelming reality of death, enacts Pygmalion's stubborn attempt to

shield experience against temporality and change; and just as the

frigid statue is incapable of returning Pygmalion's love and eventually

comes to life precisely because of his suffering her muteness,

[]{#index_split_005.html_p223}204 *Philosophical issues of the virtual*

technology too may through the impoverishment of experience and

its consequent suffering, lead us also to a transformative experience

where we are able to embrace life's imperfection, its fragility, its temporality. Technology may yet become, as Benjamin imagined it,

an awakening to the dynamics of the human psyche and its resistance

to change; no longer propelled by the denial of death, it may serve as a

means of self-reflection and not of power and control. Its blatant triumphalism would deflate once it was grounded in the acknowledgement of loss. It is precisely for that kind of thinking that the philosophers we will consider in this chapter may be seen to have been preparing the way.

While on the one hand thinkers, intellectuals, and artists in the 20th century were experimenting with the limits of writing and

subverting in various ways traditional thinking, on the other, the advent of what Marshall McLuhan called the electric media -- telephone, radio, television -- likewise subverted scribal culture, by gradually bringing in the logic and rhythm of orality back to the

forefront of (the collective mind of) Western culture. There were

winds of change in those times, when the world became, in

McLuhan's famous image, "a global village" and the media our tribal

drums. Nowadays that scenario is magnified by the emergence of the

social networks which, in their promiscuous connectiveness together

with our ability to encounter one another in a common virtual space,

annulling all distance, throw us into yet uncharted territories. Finding

our way within this new medium seems to be an inevitable task for

our time. [Ortega y Gasset (1961)](#index_split_001.html_p59) writes:

Pure reason cannot supplant life: the culture of abstract intelli-

gence is not, when compared with spontaneity, a further type of

life which is self-supporting and can dispense with the first. It is

only a tiny island afloat on the sea of primeval vitality. (p. 57)

Ortega called it spontaneity, but it spans the entire range of sensibility, including feeling, intuition, imagination, and whatever other faculties in our experience that fall outside the capacities of reason.

The task of our age involves the immersion into sensibility and the acknowledgement of the reality of bodily existence and mortality;

nothing less than a radical transformation of our Western worldview.

[**1 Beyond the Pygmalionic**](#index_split_000.html_p12)

The philosophers we are considering in this chapter, -- primarily Giles

Deleuze, Walter Benjamin, and Ludwig Wittgenstein -- anticipated the

need to overcome the "metaphysics of presence," that philosophical

viewpoint that conceives the world as constituted by substances;

[]{#index_split_005.html_p224} *Ontological centaurs* 205

privileging permanence, it valorizes the present now, while shunning

becoming and difference. Each in their own distinct way aims at lib-

eration

from

the

consequences

of

the

representational

W *eltanschauung* that results from that metaphysics. Their common insight is that the prevailing metaphysics no longer holds; so, whether

consciously or not, they prepare the way to the changes that begin to

occur with the new technologies.

As we have already seen in [Chapter 4,](#index_split_002.html_p110) [Deleuze and Guattari (1987)](#index_split_001.html_p59)

are famously known for deconstructing, in *A Thousand Plateaus*, the

rational logic of traditional writing, rejecting its hierarchical, "arbor-

eous" conception of knowledge, and occasioning instead the mad

proliferation of what they call a "rhizomatic" form of thinking.

A rhizome has no beginning or end; it is always in the middle,

between things, interbeing, intermezzo. The tree is filiation, but

the rhizome is alliance, uniquely alliance. The tree imposes the

verb "to be," but the fabric of the rhizome is the conjunction,

"and... and... and..." This conjunction carries enough force to

shake and uproot the verb "to be." (p. 25)

If Parmenides presides over our traditional metaphysics of presence with its emphasis on being and sedentary thinking, Heraclitus, with

his stress on becoming and nomadic thought, seems to preside over

the philosophy that overturns the Pygmalionic impulse of modernity,

and displaces "being" with "becoming." The constant strife between

these two paradigmatic philosophies is always present in --one could

almost say underwriting -- Western thought.

As we suggested in [Chapter 1,](#index_split_000.html_p40) the invention of the photographic camera during the Industrial Revolution revitalizes the visual order in

our experience and processing of reality, complementing -- and even

at points displacing -- the scribal order. Not that images had not played any role in the intervening centuries since the invention of writing (in fact they had been present in the illustrations of the medieval manuscripts, for example), but with the photograph the

image attained a much greater protagonism, becoming an increas-

ingly important element in the everyday experience and collective

consciousness in the following centuries.

We could speculate that the advent of any new technology re-

sponds to a general need of the times that always stands behind it.

[Tarkovski (1994)](#index_split_002.html_p109) believed this was true of the cinema, in its acknowledging the growing importance of time and temporality, but

the photograph was, as it were, the prelude to or preparation for that

invention. In its case, it was perhaps a general need for freedom from

all traditionally imposed (scribal) categories, that prompted the re-emergence of the image during the 19th century, and provoked the

[]{#index_split_005.html_p225}206 *Philosophical issues of the virtual*

many cultural experiments of the earlier part of the 20th century. The

imposition of a scribal tradition -- sequentiality and consistency, lin-

earity and perspective, hierarchy and order -- all came under fire, from

all directions. Impressionism, Cubism and Surrealism in the plastic arts, for example, started to explore the irrationality of the unconscious, struggled with the representation of movement and in-

troduced perspectivalism; atonality in music sought to break free of serialism and tonality. They were all experiments in stretching our powers of expression and thought beyond the limitations of the

rational and logical structure of the traditional media.

This Heraclitean thrust in the intellectual consciousness of the 20th

century also makes its appearance in the writing of literature in authors as diverse as Joyce, Beckett, and Cortázar. But in philosophy as

well, as Benjamin and Wittgenstein begin to produce writing that

does not follow a logical sequence, and diverts from linear thinking.

Benjamin's writing is characterized by Susan [Sontag (1981),](#index_split_002.html_p109) for example, as "freeze-frame baroque" (p. 129), and [Buck-Morss (1999),](#index_split_001.html_p59)

referring to the writing in his late *Arcades Project,* says it forces us to think in correspondences, to proceed through allegorical images rather than through expository prose. One could even say that

Benjamin's text is a proto-hypertext, introducing a logic and dynamic

very much at odds with traditional scribality but significantly approaching the rhizomatic logic described by Deleuze and Guattari that

we will eventually identify with the digital.

[Wittgenstein (2009)](#index_split_005.html_p241) points in the same direction in his *Philosophical* *Investigations,* when he declares in the Preface, that he had failed in producing a book that satisfied the usual criteria of philosophical writing: It was my intention at first to bring all this together in a book

\[where\] the essential thing was that the thoughts should proceed

from one subject to another in a natural order and without breaks.

After several unsuccessful attempts \[...\] I realized that I should

never succeed \[....\] my thoughts were soon crippled if I tried to

force them on in any single direction against their natural

inclination. (p. 3)

The confessed failure of his fragmented writing, however, eventually

becomes a moment of liberation. In following the inclination of his

thought against the grain of linear sequentiality, the disconnection from experience caused by theoretical thinking becomes a topic of his

work. Metaphysical idols and fixed ideas are the perils against which

he proposes a path of thinking, a methodology, that ultimately appeals to our ordinary language, everyday life and concrete experience

instead of to metaphysical abstractions. McLuhan thus identified a

[]{#index_split_005.html_p226} *Ontological centaurs* 207

"strongly oral character" [(Nyíri, 2016,](#index_split_001.html_p59) p. 160) in Wittgenstein's work, which harks back to the logic of a pre-scribal era.

Both Wittgenstein and Benjamin are, to some extent or in some

sense, returning us, through writing, to a mode of thinking or a type

of consciousness that is closer to the oral and which, as [Buck-Morss](#index_split_001.html_p59)

[(1999)](#index_split_001.html_p59) remarks,

to the mind that would comprehend intellectual phenomena in

terms of a logical or chronological development, wherein one

thing leads to another, to use Benjamin's metaphor, 'like the

beads of a rosary,' \[their\] work offers no satisfaction. (p. 7)

The writing of the *Investigations* gave to the Wittgenstein of its preface --

who considered it a failure because of its inability to proceed sequen-

tially and logically -- as little satisfaction as the logic of the web, with its reticular functioning, rhizomatic nature, and "textual promiscuity"

[(Murphie, 2002,](#index_split_001.html_p59) p. 189) gives the typical 20th-century scribal person.

Without knowing the digital world, Benjamin and Wittgenstein

anticipated and prepared us for it. And Deleuze, as we have already seen in previous chapters, introduced concepts that are useful tools to

understand better what is happening with our century. Although he

died on the cusp of the digital revolution, his thought too is deeply

attuned to the changes that have come with technology, even though

he says nothing directly pertaining to it. All three thinkers enact in their writing the demise of the scribal paradigm and anticipate the milieu that digital media will institute, providing the conceptual

means to understand and move with awareness in them.

[**2 Losses and recoveries**](#index_split_000.html_p12)

[***a The aura***](#index_split_000.html_p12)

The gradual narrowing of society to bourgeois interests and practices,

together with the overestimation of science and its rationalistic understanding were responsible, in [Wittgenstein's (1980)](#index_split_005.html_p241) eyes, for an alarming existential impoverishment in Western culture. Everything

appeared to him as estranged and distant from everything that was important.

Benjamin (1973b) noted, in considering storytelling, that there

were less and less people able to tell memorable stories, primarily because "experience has fallen in value":

Never has experience been contradicted more thoroughly than

strategic experience by tactical warfare, economic experience by

inflation, bodily experience by mechanical warfare, moral

[]{#index_split_005.html_p227}208 *Philosophical issues of the virtual*

experience by those in power. A generation that had gone to

school in the horse-drawn streetcar now stood under the open sky

in the countryside in which nothing remained unchanged but the

clouds, and beneath these clouds, in a field of force of destructive

torrents and explosions, was the tiny, fragile human body. (p. 84)

Not just the overwhelming and traumatic experience of the first world

war but also the spirit of the industrial age seemed to have reduced man

to silence and all language into a merely informational vehicle, into what, as we have seen, [Benjamin (1978a)](#index_split_001.html_p58) called "bourgeois" (p. 318).

The emphasis on knowledge and reason that characterized the be-

ginning of the 20th century, propelled by an enthusiasm for scientific

novelty, and a frenzy for industrial production and economic profit,

had thus the effect of narrowing our conception of human existence,

divorcing it, as it were, from its root in bodily experience.

Philosophers, moreover, seduced by the advances in formal logic and

mathematics at the beginning of the century, were able to dismiss the

expressive dimension of language as irrelevant to the accurate re-

presentation of reality, which they made their true purpose in the same spirit as the scientific mentality, with which philosophical

thinking identified.

But in the '50s, J.L. Austin in Oxford and Wittgenstein in

Cambridge questioned the exclusive focus on the representational

conception of language which reduced all linguistic communication

to the articulation of verifiable facts and instead proposed a return to

concrete experience. These "ordinary language philosophers" -- as

they were derisively called -- began elaborating on the expressive and

performative dimension of words, revindicating in this way the

complexity of ordinary language and experience against the objecti-

fying scientific mentality, finding in its neglect of the concrete nature

of human existence a cause of the impoverishment of culture that

Wittgenstein had lamented.

The mass-production of images made possible by the technology of

mechanical reproduction likewise led to the disavowal of the im-

portance of the ordinary, and caused a certain blindness to aspects of

its experience. Gauging its effects on artistic production, Benjamin (1973a) argued that mechanical reproduction stripped the work of art

of its "aura," which he tried to describe with this image:

If, while resting on a summer afternoon, you follow with your

eyes a mountain range on the horizon or a branch which casts its

shadow over you, you experience the aura of those mountains, of

that branch. (p. 216)

The aura of the mountain range or the branch that casts its shadow

[]{#index_split_005.html_p228} *Ontological centaurs* 209

over us in a summer afternoon is the experience we have, in perceiving it, of a temporal and material depth that informs our experi-

ence of those objects and recedes into an unknown darkness.

Benjamin was trying to get at the excess in our perception of the object that makes it point beyond itself. "Not a final determination of

being but an unraveling of its limits," in [Agamben's (1993)](#index_split_001.html_p58) words, a

"tiny displacement \[which\] takes place not in things but at their periphery, in the space of ease between everything and itself" (p. 54).

One could relate that excess, that feeling of something not con-

tained by the object itself as an awareness of the dynamic nature of

experience, and the process-like character of all existence. But what concerns Benjamin is the obliteration of the aura by a technology fueled by the desire to subject things to our control; by the desire, as

[Benjamin (1992a)](#index_split_001.html_p58) has it

of contemporary masses to bring things 'closer' spatially and

humanly, which is just as ardent as their bent toward overcoming

the uniqueness of every reality by accepting its reproduction.

Every day the urge grows stronger to get hold of an object at very

close range by way of its likeness, its reproduction. \[...\] To pry an

object from its shell, to destroy its aura, is the mark of a perception

whose 'sense of the universal equality of things' has increased to

such a degree that it extracts it even from a unique object by

means of reproduction. (pp. 216--217)

Technically reproduced works of art, detached from their spatio-

temporal origin, Benjamin points out, replace that unique existence

with "a plurality of copies," just as representation reduces language to

the mere statement of facts, discarding everything that does not serve

bourgeois practicality, and literally binding its expressiveness.

Representational language, flattening the liveliness of human com-

munication, and mechanical reproduction divesting the object from

its aura, both precipitate the uncanny depth of things into the existential vapidness of information, sufficient to satisfy our modern pragmatism but fatally deficient to the aureatic vision. Both moves instantiate the human reflex that needs to establish and sediment, resisting movement and change.

Digital reproduction seems to complete the dream of bringing

things closer by producing the illusion that in the digital we may conjure up the world without remainder. By closing the gaps of

analogical experience we seem to become capable of enfolding reality

without the unrepresentable excess in perception that belongs to the

realm of the aura. It's obvious that this same desire to bring the object

closer is further indulged nowadays, for example, in the high resolu-

tion of digital images, or in the invention of 3D printers that make it

[]{#index_split_005.html_p229}210 *Philosophical issues of the virtual*

possible for physical objects to traverse space and time and reappear

right next to anyone, wherever they are. This extraction of the object

from its physical singularity is the result of a perception, as Benjamin

adds, directed by a need to universalize things.

Whereas for Wittgenstein the loss of aura is without a doubt a la-

mentable loss, Benjamin resists any judgement in that respect and so

adopts what we could call a much more pharmacological attitude.

But, regardless of whether they point to the changes as negative or positive, there is here a loss we need to acknowledge and grieve.

Disavowing the mourning, however, we lock ourselves in melancholy.

Anchored again as we were in the melancholic *scribal*, where the ephemeral passing present is replaced with the linguistically sedimented past, ours has now become a *digital* melancholy (cf. Frankel (2013)). Both cultures, scribal and digital, it seems, trade fleeting experience with mental representations (concepts or images) intent on

replacing the loss, and so avoiding its suffering, instantiating the chronic oblivion of (human) mortality.

[**3 Mimetic faculty, emergence, and seeing**](#index_split_000.html_p12)

[**aspects**](#index_split_000.html_p12)

Benjamin and Wittgenstein agree in their respective diagnoses of the

impoverishment of experience. But the tendency to homogenize, to

pry the object open and do away with its originality, which we have

seen characterizes the modern ethos, results not only in the loss of the

aureatic dimension of experience; it also brings with it the gradual diminishment of our capacity to imagine, to see beyond mere appearances. It prepares the ground for the eclipsing of the human

virtual by the digital virtual, which we have identified as one of the

perils of the virtual world: the growing incapacity to connect to that

potential space from which creativity arises.

[Benjamin (1978b)](#index_split_001.html_p58) considers this loss in terms of what he calls "the mimetic faculty." He contrasts the naive modern conception of experience which reduces it to its minimal meaning -- as a "reception of

perceptions" [(Benjamin (2010,](#index_split_001.html_p59) p. 163) -- to the vision the pre-animistic people had where the world was not simply registered through the

senses but also experienced through an affective, empathic resonance

with what they perceived. What interests [Benjamin (1978b)](#index_split_001.html_p58) is the pre-rationalistic world of perception, where things are not fully closed off

from the subject by the mechanism of representation, but depend ra-

ther on mimesis, as seen in, for example, those who "identify with animals and plants," or insane persons who "identify in part with their

objects of perception," or clairvoyants who "can at least claim to receive the perception of others as their own" or to perceive magical correspondences between things (p. 66).

[]{#index_split_005.html_p230} *Ontological centaurs* 211

[Benjamin (2010)](#index_split_001.html_p59) is intent on making room for diverse types of knowledge by broadening the narrow conception of experience of the

Enlightenment, which he thought was devoid of spiritual and ex-

istential depth (p. 166). And he finds that depth of experience, which

seems to escape us, not only in the perception of ancient peoples but

in art, where there is also an intelligence that perceives presences (nature's, artifacts', etc.) mimetically and expansively in the identification with them.

The perceived world ( *Merkwelt*) of modern human beings seems to

contain infinitely fewer of those magical correspondences than

the world of the ancient people or even of primitive peoples. \[...\]

Human beings might have perceived \[...\] that objects had a

mimetic character, where nowadays we would not even be

capable of suspecting it. [(Benjamin 1978b,](#index_split_001.html_p58) p. 66)

This intelligence is responsible for creating a space of similarities or continuities that belongs to the realm of the aura, by which we are capable of revealing what lies right before our eyes but escapes us in

the objects of ordinary experience. It is responsible, in other words, for our being able to detect the sublime in the ordinary and the ordinary in the sublime.

In the same way, [Wittgenstein's (1993)](#index_split_005.html_p241) own critique of representational thinking begins also with a criticism of Frazer's attempt -- in his

classical anthropological study *The Golden Bough* -- to understand magic practices and religion as primitive modes of science. Wittgenstein argues that Frazer was able to understand neither magic nor religion, insofar as he attempted to conceive them from a scientific perspective.

Wittgenstein's purpose is to open us to the space of similarities or continuities of the aureatic, that are obviously invisible to Frazer's scientific vision, by breaking with the causal reasoning in his interpreta-

tions of the rituals, inciting instead an associative mode of thinking where he appeals to what he calls the ceremonial creature in us. Telling

us explicitly that his purpose is to teach us to "see connections" he will

do the same that Benjamin's writing did, promoting a mode of

thinking that contrasts with the linear and sequential logic of scribality, and departs from the constraints of (representationalism in) scientific

thought. Indeed, we see this new mode of thought performatively in

Wittgenstein's writing, as we have already noted, where examples

and cases proliferate, continuously reminding us of the manifold of experience and the diversity of modes of knowing -- imaginative,

metaphorical, poetical -- involved in our everyday lives.

This critique comes to fruition in his investigation of what he calls

"seeing aspects," which is the experience of suddenly perceiving

something that has not changed in its empirical presence but does in

[]{#index_split_005.html_p231}212 *Philosophical issues of the virtual*

its appearance of significance to us. We notice an [aspect, Wittgenstein](#index_split_005.html_p241)

[(2009)](#index_split_005.html_p241) says in the *Investigations,* for example, when "I contemplate a face, and then suddenly notice its likeness to an other. I see it has not

changed; and yet I see it differently" (II, xi, p. 193). That experience

involves an appeal to elements in our perception of reality that refer

us to dimensions of experience that involve modes of association and

configuration of the world that are not limited to the causal, rationalistic ways of scientific thought. The phenomenon is well illustrated

by another passage from James [Baldwin's (2000)](#index_split_001.html_p58) *Giovanni's Room*: I laughed and grabbed his head as I had done God knows how

many times before, when I was playing with him or when he had

annoyed me. But this time when I touched him something

happened in him and in me which made this touch different

from any touch either of us had ever known \[...\] Then, for the first

time in my life, I was really aware of another person's body, of another person's smell. (pp. 13--14)

[Benjamin (1997)](#index_split_001.html_p59) reflects on the psychological dynamics involved in such experiences of sudden new awareness, from the perspective of

memory:

Anyone can observe that the duration for which we are exposed to

impressions has no bearing on their fate in memory. Nothing

prevents our keeping rooms in which we have spent twenty-four

hours more or less clearly in our memory, and forgetting others

where we have passed months. It is not, therefore, due to

insufficient exposure-time if no image appears on the plate of

remembrance. More frequent, perhaps, are the cases when the

half-light of habit denies the plate the necessary light for years, until one day from an alien source it flashes as if from burning magnesium powder, and now a snapshot transfixes the room's

image on the plate \[...\] such moments of sudden illumination are

at the same time moments when we are beside ourselves, and

while our waking, habitual, everyday self is involved actively or

passively in what is happening, our deeper self rests in another

place and is touched by the shock, as is the little heap of

magnesium powder by the flame of the match. (pp. 342--343)

Something unconscious seeps in between the crevices of our habits

and sedimented notions, irrupting into our familiar perception, re-

vealing previously inarticulated or unexpected meanings. [1](#index_split_005.html_p239)

These three thinkers, Benjamin, Wittgenstein, and Deleuze, each in

their own way, were interested in conceiving experience more pro-

foundly than what the representational mind allows. And they were

[]{#index_split_005.html_p232} *Ontological centaurs* 213

anticipating, in their methods, the need to recover the capacity to face

a world no longer as static and sedentary, no longer as a unified cosmic substance, but as a series of processes, fragments, intensities,

lines of force, in constant flux. As we will soon come to see, what is

arising here is a world that anticipates and mimetically resonates with

the digital world.

[**4 Beyond representation**](#index_split_000.html_p13)

[***a From scribal to digital***](#index_split_000.html_p13)

The world of representation is defined by the primacy of sameness and

identity. But in a world of change, carried in the unstoppable stream

of temporality, repetition is not the same as resemblance. Nothing that repeats ever repeats the same. Repetition in a world of flux is married to difference, it cannot be explained by the form of identity

locked in by concepts or representations. When we give identity

priority over difference, as we have done traditionally, we are constrained to understand repetition always as a repetition of the same.

It is only when the sedimenting mentality behind the representa-

tional framework brackets that movement, that we are able to slip out

of the flow of history and live in an objectified world, where repetition

is indeed married to the same, change replaced by permanence and

immanent time by a transcendental atemporality. Repetition is a

matter of sameness only within a metaphysics of presence.

Constrained into a Procrustean bed of fixed structures and concepts,

the changing, dynamic nature of reality is concealed. Our need to sediment does away with the depth of reality, making us insensitive to

its aura.

We have seen how intellectuals and philosophers of the past

century were clearing the ground for a rhizomatic perspective on

experience. The break from the limitations of representation that

underwrites their thinking results in the discovery of the vital

forces that swerve under representation, where repetition is di-

vorced from sameness. Identity becomes an "optical effect," as

[Deleuze (1994)](#index_split_001.html_p59) puts it, produced by "the more profound game of difference and repetition" (p. 9). Under those conditions, sameness

serves as a disguise behind which difference erupts and dislocates

experience.

Because repetition differs in kind from representation, the re-

peated cannot be represented: rather, it must always be signified,

masked by what signifies it, itself masking what it signifies. ...

(pp. 18--19)

[]{#index_split_005.html_p233}214 *Philosophical issues of the virtual*

Beyond representation, a world opens where what appears as the

same, is actually hiding an unexpected difference. Under the re-

presentation of the identical, there emerges what [Doel and Clarke](#index_split_001.html_p59)

[(1999)](#index_split_001.html_p59) have called "a wholly transformative production of something other than the same" (p. 266).

We are contending that the digital materializes this shift, opening

up an ontology of flux, that overcomes the optical effect of identity

which results from sundering the world and experience from their

material-temporal existence. No longer tied down to the rigid logic

of the scribal, the virtual world stimulates the kind of associative perception -- seeing connections, producing new similarities, making

differences -- that, Benjamin points out, was powerful in the mimetic

faculty in ancient man. Indeed, Benjamin himself had noted a si-

milar potential in the cinema which may allow, as he said, a new stage in the transformation of the mimetic faculty in modern human

experience. As [Buck-Morss (1999)](#index_split_001.html_p59) explains, in providing the audience with a new capacity to study modern existence reflectively,

Benjamin was suggesting that the new mimetic techniques could

instruct the collective to employ this capacity effectively, not only

as a defense against the trauma of industrialization, but as a means

of reconstructing the capacity for experience that had been

shattered by the process \[of industrialization\]. (p. 268)

The moving image schools our mimetic powers since, as [Benjamin](#index_split_001.html_p59)

[(2008a)](#index_split_001.html_p59) himself noted, "with the closeup, space expands; with slow motion, movement is extended, \[and...\] brings to light entirely new

structures of matter" (p. 36), so that for the first time we were able to

analyze the unconsciously interwoven space:

By its use of close-ups, by its accentuation of hidden details in familiar objects, and by its exploration of commonplace milieux

through the ingenious guidance of the camera; on the one hand,

it manages to assure us of a vast unsuspected field of action. (p. 37)

That same potential is magnified with the powers of "reflection" that

the digital medium provides the common individual nowadays.

Indeed, the digital makes accessible to us a world conceived, not from

the hierarchical Platonic vision of original and copy that binds the world to a fixed and calcified idea, but rather from the horizontal and

fluid environment of the Deleuzian simulacra. Here the world is con-

stituted by processes and events instead of by static objects and quali-

ties, and experience may be able to recover or recreate the aureatic.

The new environment within which writing and speaking are

placed in the digital is no longer conceived as static but as ever-flowing.

[]{#index_split_005.html_p234} *Ontological centaurs* 215

The virtual media train us to see the invisible threads of possibility that now connect everything with everything, perhaps re-igniting the mimetic faculty. The vast scope of the virtual world awakens the vital spontaneity titillating from the infinity of possible connections, where

simulacra are copies without originals, creations that emerge out of no

model, out of nothing except the pure, playful spontaneity that it triggers. This reality, undergirded by an active criss-crossing of forces always in movement, permanently available for the constitution of

new and different constellations, becomes the site for the construction

of innumerable unique and singular worlds.

[Deleuze (1994),](#index_split_001.html_p59) 30 years before the digital revolution, in the wake of the failure of representation already envisaged by the intellectuals of the past century, attempts to provide a metaphysics of difference that accounts for our changing perception. He proposes a conception of reality

and experience that is liberated from the representational yoke that, specifically, gives up on the Platonic notion of an original model (an Idea) to which everything tries to conform. We learn "to think difference

in itself independently of the forms of representation which reduce it to

the same" (p. 9) and instead, think of it in terms of expression.

Although it took some time before film liberated itself from the

subjection to the linear narrative of scribality to discover its rhizomatic logic, once it did, it became the source of "texts" that had to be

read beyond the structures of narrative thought, more according to an

imaginal logic of associations and rhizomatic relations. Screened and

placed now within a digital virtual realm, where time becomes a

crisscrossing of forces always in movement, the digital image can al-

ways constitute different constellations, where the recurrence of

anything will never be simply a repetition of the same. The sediment,

the concept, we could say, is a mask that reality wears.

There is nothing underneath the masks \[... They\] do not hide

anything except other masks ... There is no bare repetition which

may be abstracted or inferred from the disguise itself. The same

thing is both disguising and disguised .... [(Deleuze, 1994,](#index_split_001.html_p59) p. 9) The creativity that is unleashed by this new digital medium awakens

us to what we have been calling (with Deleuze) the simulacrum's

"mad proliferation," which establishes multiplicity and diversity as more real than sameness and identity. Representation is but a mask.

Rather than imagining ourselves passively receiving inert sense-data,

already structured independently of our speech and feeling, we start

to see ourselves as centers of energy, multiplicities everywhere in us,

intensities running through us, always in contact and in movement

together with everything that surrounds them that constitute reality.

[]{#index_split_005.html_p235}216 *Philosophical issues of the virtual*

As [Nancy (2008)](#index_split_001.html_p59) said, "man comes from a momentum or a surge which surpasses him."

There is, however, a strong resistance to shifting out of the scribal paradigm; we cling to it and are still intent on preserving it, as if it were indispensable for our very survival. And this resistance manifests itself at the most practical level. For example, we react to the ecological crisis not by considering changing our techno-scientific habits or attitudes, but, because of our attachment to the scientific vision and its demand for control, by attempting to fix it. We then apply our new technologies with the same purposes. Instead of transforming our awareness to leave

and change our present course, in other words, we seek to solve the problem through eco-engineering, that is, through the same vision of technology that has provoked the global crisis in the first place. Our resistance stems from our inability to deal with the openness and fragmentariness of life, from our deep need to control what is to come.

[***b The symptom of "post truth"***](#index_split_000.html_p13)

Behind the changes we have tried to capture in the ontology of flux that we have distilled from Deleuze, lies the radical subversion that time and space have undergone due to the arrival of the digital virtual.

[Flusser (2011)](#index_split_001.html_p59) claims that these changes can begin to be accounted for in terms of two concepts we have learned from 20th-century science,

namely *relativity* and *quanta*. Einstein's theory weaned us from the belief in the absoluteness of space, and because of quantum theory we

have learned that the world is "no more than a swarm of tiny particles

whirling about at random" (p. 141). From the Cartesian exactness of measured causes and effects we move into no more than approxima-tions, statistics, probabilities. The stringency of physical reality and its logic are dislocated, and space itself, the location of its elements, extended into a larger virtual ecosystem. Physical order is now articulated

not in the single realm marked out by Cartesian coordinates but at different levels and in different dimensions, and not independently of

time. But from quantum physics we know that it does not stop there;

there are further layers of nuclei, hadrons, and quarks:

As bodies we inhabit the molecular level, but as thinking beings,

we inhabit the level of hadrons \[...\] matter and energy swim in the

atomic \[structure\]; causality comes to an end in the nuclear \[...\]

the hadronic \[structure\] requires a new mathematics and logic;

with quarks, it makes no sense to distinguish between reality and

symbols. (p. 142)

In this profusion of levels our world begins to happen, indifferently,

in any and all. We already manipulate bodies at their biochemical

[]{#index_split_005.html_p236} *Ontological centaurs* 217

level, modifying their genetic structure, and we transport them in the

virtual images on our screen that knows of no spatial separation, nor

density or weight, i.e. its zero dimensionality. Technology is already

generating, from the discoveries of quantum science, a myriad of tools

and devices: HD screens and microwave ovens, laser beams, re-

sonators and scanners, and so on. And as much as we have advanced

our understanding of the multiple dimensions of matter, we are also

learning to delve into the various levels of mental activity. In our brains, too, thinking shows itself to occur in processes that involve

electrons, protons, and similar particles \[that\] jump across inter-

vals in the astronomical numbers of nerve synapses \[...\] what we

call an idea, a feeling, a wish, or a decision turns out to be a statistical summary of quantum leaps; what we call perception

turns out to be a summarizing of quantum leaps into a representa-

tion. In the brain, representations are formed from distinct

elements, and from these in turn spring (in quanta) ideas, desires,

feelings, and decisions. (p. 143)

The digital revolution feeds from these levels of matter and space, and

condenses them from what was already the one dimensionality of the

linear thinking in scribality, into the zero dimensionality where the

world is turned into numerical codes. Everything that can be de-

composed into minimal unities -- quantities, images, sounds, colors,

temperatures, words -- can be represented by a numerical sequence.

Everything can be translated to numbers, 1s and 0s, lifted from the physical realm and transformed into information that is easily

transportable: fast as light, weightless, timeless, ubiquitous, stainless.

Everything is transported and stored without occupying any space in

no time. Digital reproduction is Benjamin's mechanical reproduction

on steroids.

Reality begins to acquire a different density, a different feel, once it

is subjected to digitization; it changes the ways in which our bodies

and minds interact, perceive and value it. [Baricco (2020) says](#index_split_001.html_p58) we become lighter, creatures of surfaces rather than of depth.

Depth may seem to us -- as it does to [Carr (2010),](#index_split_001.html_p59) [Vargas Llosa](#index_split_002.html_p109)

[(2012),](#index_split_002.html_p109) and many others -- an unacceptable loss, since we have made it an imperative of our enlightened culture. But regardless, the fact is that the world appears to us now, for the reasons just alluded to, much

nimbler and prismatic than before. And the younger generations

naturally battle the slower, heavier pace and tempo of the previous world and its concomitant regularity, law, authority and depth.

Rooted in the repetition of the same and its resistance to change and

difference, pre-digital mentality restricts the mad proliferation that has become today's experiential imperative. In a virtually connected

[]{#index_split_005.html_p237}218 *Philosophical issues of the virtual*

reality, where the empirical is dissolved into information that whizzes

by at electric speed, extending itself into the zero extensionless space

of the digital virtual, new demands, new expectations, new supposi-

tions come to be. The hybrid reality that results from the digital intervention proves unmanageable for the traditional scribal mindset

and the paradigms we have relied on for understanding and

predicting reality become fruitless and shatter.

The prolific digital (dis)order begins to wreak havoc on our most

established traditions and beliefs, threatening the objective criteria

of truth, which proves insufficient to face the hybrid epistemology

of the virtual screen. As [Weinberger (2007)](#index_split_003.html_p158) points out, we have been taught that "everything has its place \[...\] and we master our

world -- we know it -- by discerning and enforcing those places ...."

(p. 177), so that we have measured our progress by how thoroughly

we are able to tame it. But with the digital we are forced to learn to

think and live with the unruliness, disorder and multiplicity that it

produces in nature and experience, where there are no more fixed

and secure places, where the whole concept has changed. It is rather

like having to swim in water, when all we've ever done is walk

on land.

The transition from a static conception of the world to a processual

conception -- the first consequence of entering the digital -- involves a

radical undermining of the traditional notion of truth as correspon-

dence between mind and reality ( *adequatio intelectus ad rem*). As we already saw in [Chapter 2,](#index_split_001.html_p60) what we think or say need no longer correspond to the facts. For something to be true is for it to become a

#trendingtopic in the virtual media. The spectacularization of culture

and the logic of the reality show, both mainstays of the digital, are responsible for the fact that the truth of an assertion takes second place behind its mediatic and rhetorical effect. The speed of the virtual

cycle "skips over" verifiability and rushes over the facts, blatantly denying -- or even postulating *alternative facts* that will trump -- any other fact. These are the new conditions for the era of post-truth.

Free as they are now from the empirical constraints of actual facts, our

beliefs are, so to speak, different mental creatures than they were when

they resulted from experiences within our actual spatio-temporal context. Now that we are able to modulate the virtual in the virtual world,

our hybrid existence has changed the usual conditions for the constitution of our beliefs, challenging all our criteria for truth and meaning and shattering our old beliefs and certainties. Belief is no longer a matter of seeing what is objectively right, measurable by external standards.

Since, as Stiegler noted, we perceive through the intermediary postheses

of perception, "the conditions in which our beliefs are constituted have

entered into a phase of intense evolution" (Derrida and Stiegler (2002,

p\. 149): Causality yields to free association; temporal actuality is eclipsed

[]{#index_split_005.html_p238} *Ontological centaurs* 219

by the immediacy of the virtual; truth is displaced by affective resonance

and "chemistry." All the conceptual damns we had built since Plato and

consolidated in the last three centuries of modern science, are vexed by

the changes occasioned in our everyday lives by the incessant techno-

logical inventions and advances. The greatest of these is the virtual world, that flows unstoppable.

The virtual has acquired a "materiality" that opens up a new terri-

tory for human consciousness and installs a different kind of relation

between imagination and empirical experience, fantasy and reality,

objectivity and subjectivity, actual and virtual. The virtual world in-

augurates a new psychic territory that begins to reveal levels in human

interaction and communication that depend, to a large extent, on the

random coincidences of a system open to chance and resistant to all

natural necessity. It is not so much anymore the *sequence* of events but the *coincidence of events*; less causality than synchronicity that is operative in this new [world.2](#index_split_005.html_p239)

The social media has facilitated the diffusion of instant information

and potentiated the capacity of individuals to expose themselves to the buzzing energies of the network, providing them unlimited influence and facilitating the spread of fake news. At the same time, individuals and groups become the target of special interests and fall

prey to the collective frenzy that has a tempestuous effect on society.

Facebook, for example, with its new and powerful AI systems - that learn from user behavior and cater individually to users according to

very detailed preferences gauged from the information to which they

have access,- is able to construct *information bubbles* that divide and congregate groups with similar interests and objectives. And YouTube

has recently become the social media platform of the Brazilian right,

thanks to which Jair Bolsonaro, a once marginal figure in Brazilian politics (but a YouTube star in the far-right community) was able to

win the presidential election. The same happened with Cambridge

Analytica and the experience with the Trump campaign in 2016,

where it was through the very demographic information they ac-

quired from individual voters, that they used to feed them with pro-

paganda of the type that would appeal to each and drive them toward

a favorable vote. The rapid spread of practices and companies of the

same sort throughout the world is exacerbating polarization and in-

tensifying the social conflicts that are responsible for most of the present day turmoil on the [planet.3](#index_split_005.html_p240)

The phenomenon of post-truth is so confusing because it is com-

pletely other to truth as we conceive it in our Platonic framework. But

it is also something more complex than the mere devaluation of truth.

It is rather a phenomenon that puts into question precisely the moral

presupposition that makes truth an indispensable value and its loss a

catastrophe.

[]{#index_split_005.html_p239}220 *Philosophical issues of the virtual*

But words, [Nietzsche (2015)](#index_split_001.html_p59) says, are nothing but lies that we assume as truths; each concept by which we articulate reality must

necessarily betray it, generalize it in such a way that it falsifies what it is supposedly representing. Because it is formed by equating what is

not equal, each concept is a lie, but a lie without which we could not

be part of a society or indeed even possess a world. So we repeat our

concepts by agreed upon conventions. Unconsciously forgetting that

they are lies, we arrive at our idea of truth. Language thus establishes

deceit at the very heart of human existence.

In that light it may be instructive to read [Emerson's (1983)](#index_split_001.html_p59) claim that in original and not conventional verses, "the sentiment they

instill is of more value than any thought they may contain" (p. 259).

Post-truth may be a way of coming in contact with that sentiment,

an occasion to cultivate it so as to be able to be impacted by it alongside the assertion of facts. We are already learning to value honest spontaneity over the single-mindedness for truth, which

makes us blind to the fascination of multiple aspects and relative significances. We can see in this strange dislocation of truth, the possibility of a revolt against the rational and its representational rule in favor of the new energies, or rather the insistent energies that

begin to demand from below, something more than what we know

or are yet able to see.

It is of course a fact that the social media can take advantage of the

confusion created by the present crisis. Instead of something beyond

truth beginning to assert its rightful place in human discourse, it seems to call forth our blind omnipotence that runs over reality, so its

first signs are, of course, destructive.

But if instead of fixating on the loss of truth we could learn to contemplate what is actually happening instead, we may find - as we

already said in [Chapter 2](#index_split_001.html_p60) - a new path towards the exploration of spontaneity and a discovery of the potencies of vitality, traditionally

so neglected by our confidence in reason and its lure to sedimentation

and stasis. If we collectively find our way to a new consciousness, however, then perhaps that limbo where post-truth delivers us can

become the prelude for an opening to a new mode of human life,

where the point of utterances is not -- as we have assumed until now --

to reach some stable truth, but something completely different.

[1](#index_split_005.html_p231) As we saw in [2,](#index_split_001.html_p60) Facebook manages this by putting together images of the day in a new way, thus revealing aspects of our experience that had gone

unnoticed, as if the algorithmic were able to take over the mimetic function.

sive content in a effort to gain user's attention and increase time on the platform." As Jeff Horwitz and Deepa Seetharaman reported, in the *Wall* *Street Journal* (26 May [2020),](#index_split_001.html_p59) Facebook leadership ignored the findings.

[**1 Digital transcendence**](#index_split_000.html_p13)

[***a Dataism and the mind***](#index_split_000.html_p13)

When the digital seeks to achieve a perfect world and immortality, it

responds to the wish that has fueled technology always and from the

very beginning. Each new technological modulation has promised to

overcome our natural limitations. Today, when human virtuality is

extended into the bounties of the virtual world, the digital is but the

latest version of that most human pursuit.

As [Yuval Harari (2017)](#index_split_006.html_p263) observes, there is a hidden religious ideology behind this most recent technological promise. He calls it "dataism."

Dataism adopts a strictly functional approach to humanity

appraising the value of human experiences according to their

function in data-processing mechanisms \[...\] In the XVIII century,

humanism side-lined God by shifting from a theocentric to a

homocentric worldview. In the XXI century, Dataism may side-

line humans by shifting from a homocentric to a datacentric view.

(pp. 394--395)

In that datacentrism we find ourselves free to fantasize about leaving

the imperfect, frail body behind, in order to enjoy the virtual eternity

of the Internet. *Black Mirror*'s "San Junipero," an example we have already mentioned, provides us with a version of the digital in its promise of eternal youth and the defeat of bodily decay. There, the self -- identified with consciousness -- is considered a measurable

[]{#index_split_005.html_p243}224 *Philosophical issues of the virtual*

amount of data, which is easily codified and transferred from one material to any other. Upon death one enters into the archives

where the memories of all the dead are kept alive in memory chips where they become immortal. Brooker imagines cold imposing mau-soleums with infinite rows of automatized machines plugging and

unplugging the flickering lights behind which the memories of each

new immortal soul are uploaded into the San Junipero System of

virtual reality. Immortality becomes a matter of digital archiving.

In this religion, flesh may be substituted by silicon or any other matter, as long as it is capable of carrying information. The mind is

nothing metaphysical, certainly not the spiritual substance the

moderns imagined it to be. Souls are condensed into data from which

they can be resurrected and ushered into virtual immortality, through

the Messianic power of digital technology. Cartesian dualism is resolved in this technological fantasy, but at the cost of the physical body. Laced with its blinding hubris and ambition, Prometheus' gift,

then, may come at a high cost.

In turning the mind into data and replacing the body with silicon,

technology enacts a denial of (material) mortality, that numbs us to

the inextricability of death in the reality of human existence, obscuring our understanding of what it actually is to be human. Of course it may be argued that it remains a question, whether the

physical organic body -- the opaqueness of the flesh in all its imperfection and perishability -- is not intrinsic to human life; whether

reducing a mind to data does not inevitably do away with something

essential to who we are. This does, though, appear to be the case with

the numinosity of psychic images (as opposed to technical images)

and the spontaneity of the body. In both, the depth and unpredict-

ability of the lived body anchored in the dynamic of vital organic forces, immune to digital reduction, is erased.

N. [Katherine Hayles' (1999)](#index_split_006.html_p263) distinguishes between the codification or conceptual register of the thing -- which she calls its *inscription* -- from its becoming concrete or embodied -- which she calls its *incorporation*.

What we are saying is that spontaneity cannot be captured in the in-

scription, for it (the inscription) is derived from the codification of what has already happened, that is, from the sedimentation of an

event. James [Bridle (2018)](#index_split_006.html_p263) explains this built-in limitation this way: That which is gathered as data is modelled as the way things are, and

then projected forward with the implicit assumption that things will

not radically change or diverge from previous experiences. In this way computation does not merely govern our actions in the present,

but constructs a future that best fits its parameters. (p. 44)

[]{#index_split_005.html_p244} *Digital pharmacology* 225

Within those parameters we are only able to construct a future that is

a mechanical repetition of a given past, but not the new future that

can come out of the spontaneous unpredictability of existence.

Psychoanalysis studies what we might call the existential grammar

of our subjective life, the ways in which our affects are connected to

the meanings we give to our experience. But this grammar is always

incarnated in a singular vital being. Precisely because the emotions'

draw from a non-representable pulsation, the living grammar of an

embodied person is always open to the [unexpected.1](#index_split_006.html_p262) The very vitality behind our thinking and speaking, always unformed, always in

movement, always in transformation, escapes the algorithm. AI's

capture of experience can only replicate the form of the emergence,

but not the emergence itself.

There is a difference between, for example, the memory that

comes from the body and the conceptual memory of the intellect.

This difference is poignantly illustrated in a scene from the Netflix

series *Living with Yourself*, which tells the story of a man that finds himself forced to share his life with his clone. At some point the clone is trying to convince his counterpart's wife that he remembers everything "they" had done together, so it doesn't make

any difference whether she is with him or her actual husband now,

in the present. The man's wife tries to explain to the insistent clone

that he might "remember" having been on their honeymoon with

her, but that his (cloned) memory is only the mental blueprint of

*that* occasion. Since he had not actually been there, his memories

were lacking in precisely the shared experience that insufflates

memory with sensibility and makes a concept. Representational

memory falls short of bodily experience; it is composed of mere

ideas and mental concepts, empty of emotions or sensible im-

pressions. To confuse one with the other is to obviate precisely that

which distinguishes spontaneous life from its mere mechanical

repetition. As we have often observed, the fantasy of a future where

we overcome the body misses the difference between cognitive

knowledge and actual experience. We can digitally *inscribe* a thing but never *incorporate* it [(Hayles, 1999);](#index_split_006.html_p263) the thunder remains, but the lightning always eludes us.

In our digital re-creation of the real, the otherness that grounds the

self vanishes in the sheer luminosity of the screen. Its density and singularity becomes no different than that of any other. When there is

nothing there to ground the image, it becomes interchangeable, so

that it can be substituted by anything else. The result is a free zone of

random interactions, where everything acquires the same importance,

which means everything loses all importance. Chatroulette gives us a

poignant example. This online chat website, which allows one to

interact with whomever person randomly appears on the other side,

[]{#index_split_005.html_p245}226 *Philosophical issues of the virtual*

turns every body into a specter that is discarded just as easily as it was

brought to being, by a mere click. The advertising for its offer is clear

about this:

Here you can meet a biker, a pop singer, a stamp collector, a

beautiful dancer, someone very intelligent, funny, pleasant,

simply the person of your type; or you can press the "next"

button and continue the search. Random chat is somewhat like

real life: you'll be provided with lots of different opportunities, but the final choice always totally depends on you (Internet

advertisement for Chatroulette).

The irony, of course, is that if you can always and very easily discard

what you have before you in search of another option, you will never

choose: lured by the promise of infinite possibilities it becomes diffi-

cult, if not impossible, to exercise that "final choice," for there will always be lingering there beyond the next click, a new alternative that

promises a better fate. We see this in the increasingly familiar experience people have when, on a meeting arranged by Tinder, they

find their date surreptitiously scrolling through their phone, seeking

the next set of available matches, as they are (supposedly) trying to get

to know one another. This virtual parade may feed the boundless

voyeuristic hunger triggered by its inexhaustible possibilities, but in

the end, it is unable to engage even a fraction of our souls. The digital

screen reduces everything to the same meaningless repetition, where

each new image is nothing but the endless actualization of yet

another option.

[***b Virtual body***](#index_split_000.html_p13)

We all sense, at some level, how the digital thins out the *existential* *density* of things. In "San Junipero," for example, there was a tacit acceptance of this thinning in foregoing death and entering the joy of

immortal life. Despite its realism, experience there is always "merely"

virtual, lacking in the darker dimensions of life, for which a certain nostalgia, even a melancholy sets in. In this story, this nostalgia hovers over the idyllic summer town, in those virtual cigarettes that, as

we are told, have no taste and in the licentious pilgrimage of its in-

habitants to The Quagmire, the sordid nightclub, site of boundless sex

and violence, where people go to feel something who are desperate to

*feel* anything.

How can we begin to characterize the difference between the

sense of physical, lived embodiment and the sense of embodiment

in virtual space? How is our virtual presence different from our

everyday sense of bodily life? [Merleau-Ponty (1999),](#index_split_006.html_p264) as we know,

[]{#index_split_005.html_p246} *Digital pharmacology* 227

speaks of a permanent dialogue that goes on between the body and

the world, a speaking back and forth to one another. But once we

enter the virtual, this dialogue stops. Even if we put on our Oculus

Rift headset and have the experience of actually moving in space,

there is always the feeling -- as there is sometimes consciously, and

always unconsciously when we dream (cf. our discussion of Nancy

[in Chapter 10)](#index_split_006.html_p265) -- that what we are doing is still a little removed from

"real" experience. This becomes clearer when we take the headset

off and our physical self takes charge again and remembers what

was just experienced as being somehow hollow, as if we had been

numbly watching from outside. When we are living a life of drud-

gery or mindless repetition, distant from our real desires, we can have that same sense of an absent world in our actual experience.

Extreme sports, which involve a high degree of risk, have become

such a common practice because it is one compensation for a life so

detached from feeling, where one simply functions in repeated

mechanical routines.

In our society today, mass shootings and mindless violence may be

the price we are paying for our virtual lives. "We become machines at

the price of our humanity," says [Mazis (2002),](#index_split_006.html_p264) commenting on the mindset of serial killers, who report "feeling a great distance from the

experience around them, as if they were watching themselves and

others from afar":

In killing they get to experience the feelings of others: the horror

and pain of the victims that becomes so palpable, so charged, it

can jump the gap they've erected ... \[T\]here is \[...\] a sense

something is missing, something that they are trying desperately

to regain. (p. 15)

When we collapse the (human) virtual into its digital image, an im-

measurable multidimensional organic whole is reduced to measurable

zero-dimensional distances between points, where objects become

binary coordinates in digital space. The entire horizon of subjectivity

is impoverished, for, as [Murphie (2002)](#index_split_006.html_p264) points out, if we are to resonate with the world, we need that density and detail with which

"we introduce elements of chance which molecularize the whole

aesthetic process, throw\[ing\] it open to the full specificity of the entire world, at \[each\] moment" (p. 206).

This zero dimensionality is restructuring the relation between vir-

tuality and the real, between our digital life and empirical reality; in

other words, it is forcing us to revision our whole ontology. [Murphie](#index_split_006.html_p264)

[(2002)](#index_split_006.html_p264) says it is "reconfiguring the relations between micro- and macro-perceptions",

[]{#index_split_005.html_p247}228 *Philosophical issues of the virtual*

bringing to light the possibility that these relations are subject to

change, and that different social machines, different conceptual

apparatus may make it possible to have different bodies, different

souls, or different zones of clear expression.... (p. 204)

Orality, writing and filming all have affected the way in which we imagine the soul and its relation to the body. With the modulation of

modulations available in the digital, that relationship becomes even

more perplexing.

Another episode from *Black Mirror*, "Striking Vipers," gives us a stirring example of this new complexity. In this story, two close male friends in their late 30s play a VR game, where they are able to

inhabit a body of whichever sex they choose. Karl virtually assumes

the body of a woman. In the game he/she finds himself/herself

having erotic feelings for his/her (also heterosexual) friend, Danny,

and eventually they engage in (virtual) sex together. The experience

is traumatic, but at the same time transforming for both. Not only

does Karl experience the particular physical sensations of a (virtual)

female body without undergoing sexual reassignment surgery, but

they both begin to have feelings of lust, jealousy, and desire for each other, which they would have never experienced and are disturbing and incompatible with their actual lives. Nevertheless, in

this narrative, they end up incorporating their video-game life into

their everyday. In other words, they discover in the virtual new

dimensions of themselves, which initially disrupt their lives but

eventually expand them, "without having to submit to a major

reterritorialization" [(Murphie, 2002,](#index_split_006.html_p264) p. 204).

It would seem then that there is something superficial about these

new bodies and souls since there is no real change that has happened. No sex operation was necessary, of course, but not even a significant redrawing of the boundaries in their social lives; no

drastic changes necessary in their living arrangements, merely an

almost perfect assimilation. [William Carr (2010),](#index_split_006.html_p263) for example, sees in this a clear sign of decadence and a gradual watering down of everything we have held dear. In *The Shallows* he makes this case:

Our growing use of the Net and other screen-based technologies

has led to the 'widespread and sophisticated development of

visual-spatial skills.' We can, for example, rotate objects in our minds better than we used to be able to. But our 'new strengths in

visual-spatial intelligence' go hand-in-hand with a weakening of

our capacities for the kind of 'deep processing' that underpins

'mindful knowledge acquisition, inductive analysis, critical

thinking, imagination, and reflection.' The Net is making us

smarter \[...\] only if we define intelligence by the Net's own

[]{#index_split_005.html_p248} *Digital pharmacology* 229

standards. \[But\] if we think about the depth of our thoughts rather

than just its speed \[...\] we have to come to a different and

considerably darker conclusion. (p. 141)

We have already noted, when considering the phenomenon of post-

truth in the last chapter, that we may be overestimating the value of

concepts like "truth" or (in this case) "depth" that are so important to

Carr's analysis; we might do well to try to see these new circumstances

as opening realms of meaning that, rather than competing with the

old values, instead broaden and enrich them.

If the digital solution to this existential thinning is to make the virtual world "feel" even more real, then the non-digital solution would be to reconnect as well to the weight of the body and its inevitable aging, rather than use the virtual to flee from it. But does virtual reality, in liberating us from space and time, not dissolve the

microperceptions of our embodied selves? And in subjecting our

perceptions to digital representations, does it not make us deaf and blind to the subtleties of physical experience? It's not that there is no

body in the virtual world; the physical body itself gives rise there to an

immaterial body. Whether we are sitting before a screen (immersed in

a virtual world) or on a beach (immersed in the natural world), the body is always affecting and impacting how we are seeing, how we are

experiencing the world. Body, affect and apperception are intimately

interwoven, so that our thinking lives and our affective lives, even if

virtual, seem to be inseparable from our physical bodies. But the di-

gital dissociates us from the physical body, fostering a disembodied consciousness that seems to dispense with it. But does it, or can it, really?

[**2 The logic of transparency**](#index_split_000.html_p13)

[***a Newton's sleep***](#index_split_000.html_p13)

Representational thinking brings coherence and order to the play of

differences that make up consciousness and psychic life. In its

structuring capacities, the virtual makes good use of that ordering function. It may foreclose the unpredictability out of which life

arises, but we nevertheless prefer the clean sharpness of a concept to

the messy density of the experience it articulates. We turn to our screens so hungrily because of their power to virtualize the world, to

move from virtuality to actuality, without effort. We have all become

sentimentalists, wanting the luxury of an emotion without having to

pay for it, as Oscar Wilde puts it. We flee indeterminate openness,

seeking security in representational closure; we prefer its shallowness

over complexity and depth; we disavow the negative. So we are

[]{#index_split_005.html_p249}230 *Philosophical issues of the virtual*

prone to falling asleep to reality and then feeling falsely relieved by

the clarity of the very concepts that have sent us to sleep. Nowadays,

we demand not just *images* through which *to view* everything, but *perfect* representations -- images sharper than anything we could ever perceive with our naked eyes. That's how compulsive we are now

about guarding our sleep.

Our contemporary cultural condition is well illustrated by the my-

thical figure of Endymion, the beautiful young astronomer (or hunter),

who chose eternal sleep over death so that he could lovingly gaze forever at Selene, the Moon Goddess. The name Endymion means "one

who finds himself \[closed\] *within,* encompassed \[by the beloved\] as if in a common garment" [(López-Pedraza, 1990,](#index_split_006.html_p263) p. 19). This gives us an image of possession and mimetic stupefaction with one's love, that fairly pictures the way in which representations in our time have us, too, "encompassed \[...\] as if in a common garment" enveloping us in a

cocoon that keeps us closed "within" and separate from the world. It is

entirely consistent then, that in the myth, Endymion is supposed to have received the power to sleep with his eyes open, which provides a

wonderful image of a state of catatonia or catalepsy that also

accurately depicts our contemporary 24-7 digital culture.

In our cultural evasion of everything a-subjective: silence, darkness,

emptiness, indifference, death, we too constantly and collectively go

to sleep. We prefer the mathematical perfection of our artificial inventions to the fateful opaqueness and complexity of the creations of

reality. Screening the world now in perfectly sanitized HD images, for

which we leave reality behind, our consumerist techno-scienticism is

the most recent form of this Endymionic syndrome. [Merleau-Ponty](#index_split_006.html_p264)

[(2007)](#index_split_006.html_p264) again:

Science manipulates things and gives up living in them. It makes

its own limited models of things. Operating upon these indices or

variables to effect whatever transformations are permitted by their

definition, it comes face to face with the real world only at rare

intervals. Science is and always will be that admirably active,

ingenious, and bold way of thinking whose fundamental bias is to

treat everything as though it were an object-in-general -- as though

it meant nothing to us and yet was predestined for our own

use. (p. 351)

We abandon the real and embrace its virtual copy. Concrete, tem-

poral, existential change feels to us like a catastrophe; and the perfect

impassivity of our statues, the eternal immutability of the Platonic forms -- now in the razor-sharpness of the digital image turned into an

idol of our faith in the Saving Power of technology -- is meant as a denial of the unknown that shadows all experience.

[]{#index_split_005.html_p250} *Digital pharmacology* 231

The scanning, spying, sussing out behavior that proliferates in our voyeuristic era is endemic to the Pygmalionic impulse. Fastened by the

safety of the image, we course through the digital, empowered to define

the undefinable, see the unseeable, represent the unrepresentable. Our

reduction of everything to its enframing generates our surveillance culture, its collective omniscience, and the emergence of a stunning kind of intelligence that can see and know everything there is to be seen and known.

As whatever we fantasize about can be virtualized, instantly, just as

we imagine it, the immersive world of digitality becomes exclusively

oriented around our whims, interests and desires, and subjected to

their expectations. Apart from its making us oblivious of what stands

beyond our intellectual grasp, this technological power diminishes

the need for the creative and emotional struggle traditionally connected to the work of the imagination, and instead kindles the hybris

inherent to technological power, the Promethean Titanism that

triggers and is triggered by it. This capacity to have reality conform

to our wishes awakens an insatiable craving that can lead to self-destruction.

It can be a fruitful and enlightening thing to have the virtual world

at our disposal, yet it's a whole other matter when we start to expect or

demand that the outside world also behave that way. This illusion does away with any higher instance than ourselves, divesting the

world and existence of all mystery and transcendence. Having broken

the connection to the unrepresentable, we can more easily think of the world as simply our property and guide all our decisions only in

terms of ourselves. We become numb to our abysmal misuse of nature

that's making the planet unsustainable; and we feed our narcissism,

crippling any possibility of community and perverting all commu-

nication, social interaction, and the human ethos itself.

Western thinking for over 2000 years has indeed been tyrannized by

the Platonic spirit of *sameness*; it is not surprising that philosophy and psychoanalysis are still equally committed to permanence over

change, identity over difference, and immutability over temporal

movement: [Heidegger's (1996,](#index_split_006.html_p263) §6, 26) "metaphysics of presence." In subordinating difference to sameness, however, we are allowing to

escape from our attention what we might describe as the extra-

propositional or the sub-representative origin beyond speech, prior to

conceptual articulation; the void where everything originates. Turned

into theories and arguments, thinking is encased in a bourgeois

language and a mentality for which the unsayable has no use or even

any sense. The result of this is a narrowing of experience and a rickety

conception of the human subject; as long as we fail to find the

"primordial silence" beneath the chatter of words "our view of man,"

[Merleau-Ponty (1999)](#index_split_006.html_p264) says, "will remain superficial" (p. 184).

[]{#index_split_005.html_p251}232 *Philosophical issues of the virtual*

Language is always partial, always fragmented, always dependent on

something lived that it cannot represent. [Merleau-Ponty (1999)](#index_split_006.html_p264) speaks of a primordial silence that surrounds and precedes [speech. Agamben (1995)](#index_split_006.html_p263)

talks of the mute and latent matter from which the word arises.

Representation encircles everything in a single vestment, just as the moon

encompassed Endymion and kept him closed within. Positivistic and to-

talitarian, the all-encompassing perspicuity of representation is no over-

view at all but a solipsistic cocooning, an abstraction to which

[Wittgenstein (2009)](#index_split_006.html_p264) swiftly responds: "Back to the rough ground!" (§ 107).

However, if we consider an ontology of change, movement and

difference, what is decisive is not so much what the concepts grasp but precisely what is beyond it. Shifting the discourse in the direction

of difference, as we have been doing with Deleuze, makes the point of

philosophical understanding no longer about structuring reality, but

deconstructing it. Meaning breaks down, experience turns opaque,

and we encounter indeterminacy. That sudden irruption of non-

meaning, of empty significations feels impenetrable and unavoidable.

It is then that we need to move back from words to life, or rather bring

words to life. As [Merleau-Ponty (1999)](#index_split_006.html_p264) observes:

If every statement is incomplete and every expression is situated

upon a silent tacit comprehension, then it must be that things are

said and are thought by a Speech and by a Thought which we do

not have but which has us. (p. 66)

In the face of the ineffable, we automatically reduce the world to a controllable and predictable object; in other words, we assume the scientific approach, the dream against which William Blake (Ackroyd,

[1996)](#index_split_006.html_p263) warned:

Now I a fourfold vision see

And a fourfold vision is given to me

Tis fourfold in my supreme delight

And three fold in soft Beulah's night

And twofold Always. May God us keep

From Single vision & Newton's sleep (p. 193)

[***b Pharmacology of the selfie***](#index_split_000.html_p13)

The Digital Age with its "black mirrors" makes us lose track of the complexity of our lives by its unlimited representational capabilities.

But digitality, paradoxically, may also help to liberate us from that very fixation.

[]{#index_split_005.html_p252} *Digital pharmacology* 233

As we saw in the example in the Introduction of Frank's dream of

his pre-Parkinson's father, the oneiric image derives its psychic

power from the living source that the digital lacks. Although the

digital image may also be unbidden -appearing unexpectedly as a

"memory" on our screens by the magic of Facebook, for example-,

and have a significant psychological impact, still our encounter

with that random memory produced by the algorithm of the

virtual platform clearly lacks the numinous force of the living

image, its uncanniness and spontaneity. So, although the digital

enhances and enriches our experience in various ways (it even

allows us to replay the image as many times as we want), it lacks

the dream image's autonomous singularity, which stands beyond

representation and -- *a fortiori* -- is impossible to translate into digital code.

"Be Right Back," the episode of the *Black Mirror* series we examined already in [Chapter 3,](#index_split_001.html_p82) illustrates the difference we are alluding to. Not long after the protagonist, Martha, receives the artificial body of her

boyfriend, Ash, programmed to act exactly like the original person, she discovers in the clone precisely the same shortcoming we have pointed out in the digitized image. What has been archived in Ash's

digital footprint may register everything he did and said, so cloned Ash is constituted by everything that made up his actual life; yet being

programmed from what the person already has been, it lacks the open

virtuality that distinguished it from the living person.

What we are is not just that part of us that has already happened

but, more intrinsically, the spontaneous vitality that remains behind

the actual, in the depths of (living) matter. The enigma of each person

is found in her own virtuality, that living potential constituted by all

the forces that sustain her -- from her historical and her genetic past --

which have not yet acquired any actuality, yet undergird the life she

lives as its unfathomable origin. The representation that has been digitized only repeats the same: it fails to capture the potentiality from

which the new can emerge. It misses completely the play of difference

that always stands behind the illusion of a stable identity in the living

person. The person we are in the networks, the identity that we forge

through the screen, insofar as it remains a sediment in the virtual world, a digitized actualization, is rivened from its living source; it reduces bodily experience to bare information.

The digital tempts us into the assumption that what it captures is

the core of what we are, that indeed we are our representations. This is

evident in that epidemic of self-expression and exhibitionism mani-

fested in the Selfie phenomenon. The impulse to constantly take

pictures of ourselves reflects a desperate demand for a permanent

register, foisted on us, moreover, by a growing collective pressure in

[]{#index_split_005.html_p253}234 *Philosophical issues of the virtual*

everyday public life to condense who we are in what we represent for

others. This collective fever seems to be a revolt against im-

permanence, a desire to capture life and save it from the peril of ex-

tinction. It obeys a Pygmalionic instinct.

The phenomenon of the Selfie may work, as we have seen in the

critique of stance two [(Chapter 4),](#index_split_002.html_p110) as a tired and repetitive image, an empty simulacrum that negatively inflates the self. Selfies give us the

illusion of something unchanging. But doesn't the digital also offer a

way to reverse that equation? What if it is exposing us, instead, in its

static and sterile repetition, to the glaring void that is at the center of all representation: what if that underlying oneness turns out to be a

figment of our imagination?

David [Hume (1896)](#index_split_006.html_p263) famously wrote, already in the 18th century:

\[W\]hen I enter most intimately into what I call myself, I always

stumble on some particular perception or other, of heat or cold,

light or shade, love or hatred, pain or pleasure. I never can catch

myself at any time without a perception, and never can observe

any thing but the perception. \[...\] If any one upon serious and un-

prejudic'd reflexion, thinks he has a different notion of himself, I

must confess I can reason no longer with him. \[...\] He may,

perhaps, perceive something simple and continu'd, which he calls

himself; tho' I am certain there is no such principle in me. (p. 134)

We are, indeed, nothing but a running stream, a flux, a flowing col-

lection of different perceptions just passing through. In his words:

\[These perceptions\] are nothing but a bundle or collection of different

perceptions, which succeed each other with an inconceivable ra-

pidity, and are in a perpetual flux and movement. \[...\] there \[is no\]

single power of the soul, which remains unalterably the same \[...\]

There is properly no simplicity in it at one time \[...\] whatever natural

propension we may have to imagine that simplicity.... (p. 134)

As we saw in [Chapter 8,](#index_split_005.html_p222) [Deleuze and Guattari (1994)](#index_split_006.html_p263) claim that identity is nothing but "an optical 'effect' produced by the more profound game of difference and repetition" (p. 4). Identity is but the

fleeting glimpse produced by the play of light and water on the surface

of the river we couldn't enter twice.

So what if the narcissistic love manifested in the selfie phenomenon

-- this need to register one's every moment -- is secretly seeking to return

to that play, seeking to overcome representation precisely by the

oversaturation of representations? In its obsessive need to capture the

self, again and again in every new situation it encounters, it may

[]{#index_split_005.html_p254} *Digital pharmacology* 235

become possible to intuit or see the play of differences that underlies

the illusion of identity.

In her photography, Cindy Sherman is famous for playing with

her own image. Her work is meant to undermine the conventional

ways culture shapes our appearances. Although she has always in-

sisted her images are not to be taken as personal statements, in her

recent incursion into Instagram she has been posting photos of

herself produced by a series of algorithms. As [Andre Russeth (2017)](#index_split_006.html_p264)

writes, these faces that "have inflamed skin, warped noses, piercing

eyes," create "a reality at once disorienting, disturbing." This array

of images conjured by Sherman ultimately questions representa-

tional identity.

That obsessive repetition becomes a new means of exploration.

Each selfie eventually shows that, no matter how many pictures I post

of myself, I am never wholly *this* representation, and I am not *that* representation, or indeed any other. In the constant repetition of the

same, we are confronted with the negative dimension of identity. An

*enantiodromia* takes place again, that reveals the sedimented sameness of identity as ephemeral unrepresentable differences. "All identities are only simulated," [proclaims Deleuze and Guattari (1994,](#index_split_006.html_p263) p. 1) from their vantage point.

As we have pointed out several times already, nothing is more af-

firmative to the self, nothing more inflating, than the ceaseless stream

of pictures produced by our phones. Yet the impulse contained in the

Selfie seems to be, then, also about connecting to the dynamic, un-

nameable, plural forces -- the differentials -- from which consciousness

arises. Where all representation is anchored, we are liberated from all

representation.

We see that unmasking happening in the interactions we have in

the Internet. The color-blind, gender-blind, age-blind web allows us to

present ourselves in any one of many faces without being any one, and at the same being all of them. If we peel the onion of our digital

identity, what we are left with is the abysmal yawning from which the

self emerges. The digital may be helping us come face to face with groundlessness, with what the Eastern mind, in the Sacred Wisdom of

*Sunyata,* identifies as the "emptiness" behind all representation

[(Varela, Thompson, and Rosch, 1993).](#index_split_006.html_p264)

While the digital in its proliferation of images may invite us to encounter the groundlessness of identity, it also does the opposite, providing us the means to disavow it, defensively displacing and

substituting our groundlessness with something fully representable in

its digital rendering. This is the paradoxical power that we have been

calling the pharmacology of the digital.

and already the knowing animals are aware

that we are not really at home in

our interpreted world.

R.M. [Rilke (1989a)](#index_split_006.html_p264)

[***a Towards the posthuman***](#index_split_000.html_p13)

Modern culture is rooted in Humanism, the belief that human being is

the pinnacle of Nature, so that any other species or creature is subordinate to us; that reason is the infallible guide towards progress, so

that anything that does not fit the demands of science's single vision

is not important, and progress is defined in terms of our needs over all

others. We are masters and possessors of Nature, as Descartes proclaimed. Everything is measured according to one single standard:

human being. But even within the human it seeks to define by exclusion, according to parameters set by a biased ideal which rests upon

a conception of humanity made to the image of Vitruvius' man:

white, male, heterosexual, European, and enlightened. "Man" is seen

as the measure of all things and at the summit of an ontological hierarchy that results in the exclusion of all diversity from equal importance: women, non-European, non-white, non-enlightened, non-

heterosexual people.

Humanism has proved to be defective, partialized, distorting of (and

blind to) the diversity of our nature. The proclamation of human

rights, for example, ignores and so deprives all those that do not form

part of the Western establishment. It discriminates and subordinates

animals, plants, and nature as a whole, to human standards. It is tyrannical and exploitative, as it sees nature, merely as "standing reserve" for our needs, as [Heidegger (1977b)](#index_split_006.html_p263) puts it.

The growing new consciousness of our age rooted in feminism and

evolving into the critique of hetero/gender normativity and other

growing minority and civil rights movements, begins to undermine

the very concept of man. The limitations of the model we have taken

for granted for so long, make it suddenly a problem.

[***b Transhumanism and the Singularity***](#index_split_000.html_p13)

Freud claimed that there had been two blows to human narcissism

before psychoanalysis. The first blow was that of Copernicus, when he

demonstrated that human beings are not the center of the universe

and left us thwarted in a new world. The second blow was Darwin's,

when he proved that *Homo sapiens*, allegedly superior to animals,

[]{#index_split_005.html_p256} *Digital pharmacology* 237

actually descended from the apes. The third blow would be given by

psychoanalysis, which revealed a troubling truth (with which we have

had to learn to live all of last century) that we are not masters, not even in our own house, because there's always a self behind the self

that is doing things we do not know and that can unveil truths that

we ignore about ourselves.

Artificial intelligence (AI), however, could be giving a fourth blow

to our narcissism. With AI, it is also possible that a new kind of entity

is being constituted, where human intelligence is not just enhanced

but even surpassed to the point where the very notion of humanity

comes into question. The neuroscientist Christof [Koch (2012)](#index_split_006.html_p263) even speculates that the web might have already become sentient,

and asks:

\[B\]y what signs shall we recognize its consciousness? Will it start

acting on its own in the near future, surprising us in alarming

ways by its autonomy? (p. 132)

Alarming, because in that case Artificial Intelligence would eventually

reveal to us -- again, and perhaps now indisputably -- that human

being, as we have understood it up to this point, may not be the peak

of creation, but merely a step in a process where the products of human technology are extending and reconstituting Nature. They

may be even displacing or just leaving behind our species, over-

throwing it, divesting it of its alleged privilege; perhaps even proving

it as dispensable as all other species that have preceded us. In other

[]{#index_split_006.html}

words, digital technology, and artificial intelligence in particular, may

be subverting the very sense of who we are, showing that life, *zoe*, is unstoppable and chronically mutable, multifaceted and radically

unpredictable; and that we are miniscule in comparison to that "raw

cosmic energy that underscores the making of civilizations, societies

and their subjects"(Rosi [Braidotti, 2013,](#index_split_006.html_p263) p. 55) that is now barging in on our species due to the emergence of the digital.

But perhaps the belief that our technological prowess -- in this case,

our creation of artificial superintelligence -- is a practical danger that

may obliterate us from the universe becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy.

For insofar as mesmerizing us with the fantasy of an enhanced human

future, it stops any reflection about the meaning of these developments, the nature of human life itself, which then makes technology

an actual threat. Taking our relationship with it as a matter of dom-

ination and control delivers us directly into the hands of the beast it

creates and persuades us of a looming disaster. "The superintelligence

explosion," is [what Bostrom (2014)](#index_split_006.html_p263) calls it. But this is still a humanist fantasy. Both as the extinction of our race or as the utopian triumph

[]{#index_split_006.html_p257}238 *Philosophical issues of the virtual*

of human reason, it is a product of the anthropocentic imagination

that blinds us to the import of the present moment.

From the anthropocentric perspective, our technological mastery is

idealized as our (final) victory over nature. This reaches its apotheosis

in what's called the Singularity, a moment in the history of the species

that, transhumanists claim, will mark a new and brighter beginning

for human being (or, if we are pessimistic about the facts, it may be its

utter demise). [Experts2](#index_split_006.html_p262) estimate that it is soon approaching: 2050, they predict, will be the year of its consummation. Enhanced by artificial intelligence, we will become Gods or else, overpowered by it,

we will be extinguished. The [Singularity3](#index_split_006.html_p262) will be a moment

... in which our intelligence will become increasingly nonbiolo-

gical and trillions of times more powerful than it is today -- the dawning of a new civilization that will enable us to transcend our

biological limitations and amplify our creativity. In this new

world, there will be no clear distinction between human and

machine, real reality and virtual reality. We will be able to assume

different bodies and take on a range of personae at will. In

practical terms, human aging and illness will be reversed; pollu-

tion will be stopped; world hunger and poverty will be solved.

Nanotechnology will make it possible to create virtually any

physical product using inexpensive information processes

and will ultimately turn even death into a soluble problem

[(Kurzweil, 2005).](#index_split_006.html_p263)

But this excessively exalted conception of our future becomes a

myopic screen behind which we fail to ask ourselves the transcen-

dental questions that a revolution like the one we are living demands

of us, peremptorily and every day.

This transhumanist fantasy, whether utopian or dystopic, is merely

an exacerbation of the humanist stance. Digital technology may very

well be, not the beginning of a new era for humanity, as transhumanists think, but, quite to the contrary, precisely the "event" of which Foucault wrote in 1966, over 50 years ago, of the end of man or

the beginning of a new conception of what it means to be human:

man is an invention of recent date. And one perhaps nearing its

end \[...\] If those arrangements \[that had made it possible\] were to

disappear as they appeared, if some event of which we can at the

moment do no more than sense the possibility -- without knowing

either what its form will be or what it promises -- were to cause them to crumble, \[...\] then one can certainly wager that man

would be erased, like a face drawn in sand at the edge of the sea.

(Foucault (1989), pp. 421--422)

[]{#index_split_006.html_p258} *Digital pharmacology* 239

Transhumanism seems to rest, paradoxically, on those very "funda-

mental arrangements of knowledge" that are being shattered by the

technological revolution.

The danger digital technology poses is much more fundamental

than what, from the anthropocentric humanist perspective, is vainly

and exclusively seen in terms of human survival and its victory over

nature. Singularitarianism, in conceiving of technology as a mere

instrument (that may, in fact, exceed us), fails to attend to the fact that it is intrinsic to our very nature, a power at the very heart of the

enigma of being human. And it should be obvious that this

Singularitarian vision completely misses the pharmacological nature

of technology as Stiegler conceived it. Technology is not something

that we make or possess but something we grow, or something that

grows from us. By turning it into an object that we can manipulate at

will, Singularitarianism explicitly relegates the task of reflection on the meaning of this "technological merge" to a secondary place,

something we can attend to once we have solved the *real* problems. As

[Bostrom (2014)](#index_split_006.html_p263) suggests,

We could postpone work on some of the eternal questions for a

little while, delegating the task \[which philosophers dedicate their

time\] to our more competent \[transhuman\] successors, in order to

focus our own attention on a more pressing challenge: increasing

the chance that we will actually have competent successors \[and

not destructive to humans\].... We thus want to focus on problems

that are not only important but urgent \[in the sense that their

solutions are needed prior to the intelligence explosion...\] to

expedite the development of *control methods* that could render the

machine intelligence revolution survivable and beneficial. (our

italics, p. 256)

So we need "to expedite the development of control methods" to keep

the danger in check, in order for us to survive the intelligence explosion, where machine intelligence surpasses human intelligence.

Note the way Bostrom separates them from each other and so makes

the machine an alien instead of a natural extension of our bodies and

psyches. Bostrom says we need "the capacity of control able to miti-

gate the risk of an accidental lift-off of superintelligence" (p. 259), but what really matters about technology here is not itself technological,

as Heidegger famously pointed out. It is existential.

We bring words back from their metaphysical to their ordinary use,

says Wittgenstein, talking about how theorization needs to be

brought down to the ground in order to give it life. We could say that

we must bring back our technology from its melancholic entrance-

ment and deliver it to the concreteness of our human condition. We

[]{#index_split_006.html_p259}240 *Philosophical issues of the virtual*

must see technology, indeed, as an extension not of us, but of Nature

that works through us, which we cannot overpass. Not technology as

a tool, as a tool for production, but as a symptom or a screen against

which we can see ourselves. We should see technology, in other

words, not as something we own, but as something that owns us and

is grounded, like us, in the unrepresentable.

[***c Digital ethics***](#index_split_000.html_p13)

*And in the dark crossing of the*

*heart, there is no temple for Apollo*

R.M. [Rilke (1989b)](#index_split_006.html_p264)

[*i Technology*](#index_split_000.html_p13)

If we understand that technology is a means of engaging with the complex constellation of vital energies that constitute Nature, then we need to understand *how* we engage with its manifestations, both

outside and within us. This concerns not only how we treat the earth,

but also how we treat ourselves and each other. We cannot rush to the

future filled with the excitement of transhumanism, leaving reflection

on the nature of technology for later and hence, insofar as it extends

us, reflection on its impact on ourselves.

We seem to think that we can solve the consequences of our

technological excesses by means of more technology, without first

addressing the question of how and why we are using it so self-

destructively. Technology as a symptom can reflect us back to ourselves and reveal what it is we want, what we seek, desire what we desire. It can show us why we do the things we do, suffer and despair,

abhor or revere. It may help us see what kind of creatures we are and

where -- as a species -- we are headed. We need to see through our projections on technology, discern what fears and fantasies lie behind

them. We need to discover under what aegis we have come to this, what conception of ourselves and our place in nature is responsible for our mindlessness. To continue along the same path, without understanding how and why we have arrived at our current crisis, is to

risk blindly repeating what needs to be changed. This is what's most

needed and not mechanical control methods to protect us from

ourselves.

The technological modulation particular to the digital touches

again the very core of the ontological centaur, radically unraveling its

modern encasing, that is, the concept by which human being has

been so far identified. The digital stretches the implicit duality of the

ontological centaur to its utter limits adding to the already complex

[]{#index_split_006.html_p260} *Digital pharmacology* 241

mix of human and animal, the cyborg, which gives further depth to

the paradox.

If the monster we see menacingly approaching is something we

have created in order to escape the confrontation with the complexity

of life, then we will blindly walk into oblivion, inevitably continue along the path towards the catastrophe we imagine. But our technological fantasies are merely distractions to disavow our own mortal nature, merely houses of cards we are always constructing in the air to

avoid coming to the rough ground of our hybridity, especially when

further roughened by artificial intelligence and cyborg natures.

Like scientism, which believes that everything must pass through

the scientific screen to guarantee truth and knowledge and the power

of prediction and control, Dataism (now channeled and directed by

capitalist consumerism) also believes that everything must be digi-

tized, not, however, for the sake of anything as lofty as knowledge or

truth, but for the sake of profit. It is oblivious to any Law that opposes

its course along the craving for both money and power. Genetics,

eugenics, cryogenics, and biotechnology are prey to becoming not

only testaments of our misuse of technology, but also of greed and human stupidity.

[*ii The question of ethics*](#index_split_000.html_p13)

In the dawn of a new technological era endowed with the power of

the digital, it is crucial to provide a new and broader conception of our

species and of its place in nature. Donna [Haraway (2016)](#index_split_006.html_p263) and Rosi

[Braidotti (2013)](#index_split_006.html_p263) bring *gravitas* to the issue, when they replace the detached, transcendental subject of humanism with what they describe as "subjects dying together," emphasizing, not man as the ra-

tional agent but humans that, like any other creature, suffer mortality,

especially aggravated now by these apocalyptic times.

The emboldened virtual self vs. the immanent, here-and-now self of

embodied life, constitutes a central ethical dilemma in our age. How

much disavowal of the other's subjectivity are we entitled to in the name of digital self-expansion? Or, conversely, how much of the situation of our actual, everyday relatedness to other people and our environmental surround should we abstain from disavowing in order

to curb the self-aggrandizing expansion inherent to digitality? In the

present "crisis of humanism" there are various tasks required in view

of a post-human future. One of them, [as Braidotti (2013)](#index_split_006.html_p263) writes, is that of reinventing and reimagining the connection with the nonhuman

that humanism has torn. In general, we need to overcome our cultural

fixation on sedimented sameness and embrace instead the fluid

stream of difference that is becoming conscious in the world. But we

also need to change our conception of and relation with technology.

[]{#index_split_006.html_p261}242 *Philosophical issues of the virtual*

Ruthless discriminating humanism and narrow-minded anthro-

pocentrism, fueled and even further perverted by the greed of capit-

alism, cannot any more underwrite digital technology.

Alejandro [Jodorowski (2007),](#index_split_006.html_p263) the oracular Chilean filmmaker, says a different kind of faith is needed to effect the necessary change at this new crossing. We must not only question everything -- the meaning of

philosophy, of politics, of economics, of morals -- but we also need to be

open to the transvaluation of the values that ground the current system

-- its culture and form of life -- that is quickly crumbling before our very

eyes. He claims we must convert from our staunch rationalism, our long-

standing identification with reason, and begin to believe instead in the

power of the emotions. We need, in other words, to think not (only) with reason, but more than anything *with feeling*: with the heart instead of from the head. This is, indeed, as we may remember, the shift [Ortega](#index_split_006.html_p264)

[y Gasset (1961)](#index_split_006.html_p264) anticipated as the radical displacement of our age, which is already taking place as a response to humanism and in the midst of

digital technology. It involves the dissembling or displacement of the paradigm that has sustained our whole culture until now. As Jodorowski

cleverly puts it, it is not a revolution but a "re-evolution": a change in

our way of seeing, a leap of consciousness, a second birth in language.

This complete reversal in culture will not occur if we are making sure we keep everything under control, busily fixing things "to mitigate the risk of an accidental lift-off," as [Bostrom (2014)](#index_split_006.html_p263) (p. 259) puts it. We need to turn the technological phenomenon into a gateway, an

entrance to a new consciousness, a different way of living. The change

we need, we venture to say, is not only or not so much in the state of

things, but in their meaning for us, because -- in the words of

[Agamben (1993) we have already seen](#index_split_006.html_p263) -- it will not take place "in things but at their periphery, in the space of ease between every thing

and itself" (p. 54). Perhaps [Wittgenstein (1995)](#index_split_006.html_p264) puts the point best, when he wrote in the *Tractatus*,

If the will, good or bad, changes the world, it can only change the

limits of the world, not the facts. \[...\] In short, in this way the world becomes, completely, another. It must, so to speak, grow or

decrease as a whole. The world of the happy is different from the

world of the unhappy. \[ *Die Welt des Glücklichen ist eine andere als*

*die des Unglücklichen*\] (6.43)

The change we need does not belong to our "interpreted world"; it takes

place at its limits, at the point where things stand beyond representation. The task ahead, then, is not only the solution of practical problems, but more than and before anything, the kind of inner transformation that changes the phenomena completely, yet (paradoxically) without

[]{#index_split_006.html_p262} *Digital pharmacology* 243

actually changing them; just like the world of the happy man, which is

the very same world but different than that of the unhappy.

[**Coda**](#index_split_000.html_p13)

As we have seen in our previous chapters, Deleuze, writing just before

the advent of the digital age, allows us to see the virtual as a kind of

immanent emergence in its own right, with its own play of difference

built into it, thus pointing to an alterity or otherness that originates

beyond the human subject. What may be happening in the digital age

is the deliverance into a different topography of human nature, a refashioning of the ontological centaur that may be opening the path

for the task of our age, namely, to cite [Ortega y Gasset (1961)](#index_split_006.html_p264) again, the exploration of the boundless vitality upon which reason stands.

Not only does this task begin to flutter in our new awareness of the

reality of the virtual -- which adds a further depth and complexity to existence -- but also in the dark excesses of a blindly empowered technology. It involves a reconception of human nature -- not only of

the place of the virtual, but also of the place of the vital -- that *extends* consciousness to the negative that yawns beyond our rational grasp and opens up a whole vast territory, where we may find an ampler place to live the paradox of human existence. It may be

nothing other than the return to primordial emptiness, the very silence behind all language. Our immersion in virtual reality may be pushing us to confront the negative anew, the negative that lurks behind the virtual.

The deliverance of this age is to that vitality that stirs beyond our

words and rationally constructed structures, to its ungraspable and unstoppable flux that has always nurtured reason. It is an awakening

to the groundlessness of human existence, to the pulsating depth and

darkness of life, that informs all our categories and ignites the spon-

taneity from which all things are given birth in matter.

(memory) or what we want to make happen in the future (desire).

[]{#index_split_006.html_p265}[**10 The tragedy of the virtual**](#index_split_000.html_p13)

Methinks, by most, 'twill be confess'd

That Death is never quite a welcome guest.

Goethe, Faust

[**Prelude**](#index_split_000.html_p13)

All day and all night, the digital is continuously telling you to leave

whatever you are doing (or not doing) and check in with it. It seduces

with the promise of escape from the dull, slightly anxious moments

that texture the everyday by transiting into a heightened reality that is

undeniably more stimulating and satisfying.

Consider the familiar rote of digital life. At the end of the day, when we

are finally ready to close the laptop for the night, we inevitably hesitate, and check again to see, just in case ... one more thing; the sudden panic

at the apparent loss of our phone, or the urge to check our social media in the middle of whatever we happen to be doing; the magnetic draw that

beckons us voyeuristically to our neighbor's screen, and the allure of its

unknown promise; the abrupt intrusion of someone's voice behind the

digital stream, that forces us to pull out our AirPods and leave the virtual to respond, followed by the anxious [return.1](#index_split_007.html_p296)

For some, the passage into the virtual world involves a loss of rea-

lity. For others, it is because we can finally move into the virtual that

we will no longer have to suffer the limitations endemic to the phy-

sical, the body, the flesh of our existence. We place loss, absence, and

the passing away of things exclusively in one or the other of the two

camps. Each, in their own way, tries to hold on to something that seems valuable and keeps out something that seems dangerous. Pushed

to their extreme, they both lead to the same partition of virtual and real

common to the pro and anti-technological stances.

But the tragedy is that such perfection is impossible, because when

virtuality is actualized something is always lost, a potential must die

for the actual to be born, for that potential to become real. Potentials

are actualized by different technologies, and each involves a loss of its

[]{#index_split_006.html_p266} *The tragedy of the virtual* 247

own. In the oral the virtual is rhizomatically actualized, whereas in the written, narrow paths, linear thinking, mathematics and logic are

often imposed upon it. Each, the oral as well as the written, involves a

loss. Yet each also fulfills its new role.

In our present day, we call the modulation enacted by the digital,

"virtual reality." This term, however, carries within itself a hidden bias

against the digital world. Since Plato, the virtual smells of fakeness to

the scribal mind. But digital virtuality involves a complicated marriage of each of the previous media; it takes us back to the rhizomatic

as well as makes use of rational logic and numbers; with the aesthetic

power of images and sounds made available on screens by the digital

media, it transforms language, both oral and written. The digital has

its peril in its bewitching (hyper)realism, its rising above the transient

with its beguiling power to simulate the empirical without having to

include the body. That powerful mirage is the promised land for

many, and a fake copy for others.

The anti-technologist, for example, wants to protect us from the

invasive force of the digital which tries to replace what can only come

from embodied life and its intrinsic relation to mortality with an in-

authentic hyper-techno virtuality. So the digital needs to be placed under tight supervision and control, its influence diminished, to

prevent it from impinging upon human virtuality. But with such a

paranoid eye, the many ways in which the world today is being im-

bued with virtuality, in other words, how human virtuality itself is being expanded by the digital, is missed.

And then things take an even more complicated turn, as it becomes

clear that part of the motive to see the digital as adversary is the feeling of threat imposed by its particular modulation of the virtual. The digital

potentiates the radical rhizomatic edge that reveals life in movement,

tapping into a virtuality that disrupts dichotomies and hierarchies. The

digital opens and releases things, threatening ordering centers of

power, against which the anti-technologists want to tighten their grip.

At first glance, we might think that the pro-technologists have

found a way out of the rigid division that so clearly plagues the anti-

technologist's position. In Floridi's concept of "on-life", or with the idea of the Internet of Everything, where external reality itself

becomes a digital mirror, the intention to blend digital and actual life

seems to succeed, so that virtual and real no longer oppose one an-

other. But in truth it fails, because it relies upon the same stubborn

opposition, and ends up replacing human virtuality with the digital

virtual, without remainder.

Even though virtuality's inexhaustibility gives us the sense that

there is always more, its very ephemerality is also a harbinger of loss.

In any actualization of virtuality, in the digital no less than in the physical, there is privation. This intrinsic loss of being, touches

[]{#index_split_006.html_p267}248 *Philosophical issues of the virtual*

everything, both real and virtual, empirical world and digital world,

human virtuality and digital virtuality. The tragedy of the virtual is indeed that loss is inescapable, and anything that offers to transcend

it is an illusion.

In what follows, we want to illustrate -from the perspective of the

losses that follow in the wake of the digital-, what we have in mind

when we speak of this tragedy. We tend to assume that overcoming

impermanence, making the world feel more stable and coherent is

one of the great benefits of the digital. However, the intuition behind

our claim that a thinning or flattening occurs in the passage to digi-

tality is also that it can be a detriment that threatens to erase the generative spontaneity of the human virtual.

Since we will be exploring the territory where human virtuality is

nurtured by finitude -- limitations, absences, endings -- it will be hard

for us not to allow what is sacrificed by the digital to overshadow and

thus blind us to what is gained by it. Thus, the peril of this concluding

chapter is to not sufficiently consider the alternative perspective, that

the human virtual can be enhanced by the new mode for reckoning

with loss that is opened up by the digital. Can our tragic vision be large enough, robust enough, to hold and endure the tension between

diminishment and enhancement with the advent of digital virtuality?

Is it possible to hold ourselves open to the tragic condition, without

falling into the dichotomization of virtual and real that we have been

working so hard to deconstruct?

[**Introduction**](#index_split_000.html_p13)

We can view the losses that are incurred in digital life from many vantage points: i) as a relational loss, since the constant preoccupation

with our devices disconnects us from the people around us, especially

those we are most intimate with, ii) as a communal loss, as the digital

bursts into our shared, collective spaces, hampering our capacity to effectively read and empathize with one another, to feel our way into

each other's experience and into what we have in common and iii) as

an existential loss, where our unwitting embrace of digital virtuality

paradoxically diminishes our capacity to access and bear the human

virtual. These are three dimensions of what we are calling the tragedy

of the virtual.

In the Virtual Within [(Chapter 5),](#index_split_002.html_p130) we examined how an inward orientation toward the mind -- which mapped out the role psychic life

plays in structuring how we take in and perceive the world -- is steadily

receding in the digital era. There is a remarkable outward turning of

the very psychic stuff that used to comprise our subjectivity -- fanta-

sies, wishes, dreams -- as we take up residence in the virtual world.

What once found a home in the innermost reaches of the self now winds its way through cyberspace.

Take tweets, for example. Thoughts, fantasies, and ideas that ran

around in our mind are now showcased in a public forum, to

whomever is willing to listen. The inside turned out, for anyone that

wants to see. And what a rush! Bearing witness to the ephemera of our

most private thoughts and feelings, the receptivity of the psycho-

analyst now becomes dispensable, as she is multiplied in the gaze of so

many others in the digital frenzy.

For Freud and Jung, the psyche has a life-force of its own that eclipses the conscious intentionality of the self. Within their own unique conceptual systems, each discovers a non-personal dimension

out of which subjectivity arises. In Nancy's re-transcription of the Freudian drives, as we have seen, it manifests as a momentum that is

inside us yet surpasses us. These depth-psychological accounts, with

their emphases on psychic forces that are other to the intention of the

subject, are one way of rendering this vitalizing non-personal (we might we even say non-human) source of subjectivity that we have

come to call the immanent virtual. But what happens to this ultimately uncontrollable, non-sovereign source of vitality when it

no longer emerges from the spontaneity of the psyche but in the

algorithms of the digital?

In our digital lives, rather than traversing us, this surge is outwardly

dispersed, impossible to contain, over-burdening the metabolizing

function of the psyche. We are more susceptible today of being

thrown off balance by the digitization of the self that encumbers its

functions, as it tries to deal with the impinging demands of collective,

networked experience. Exhausted by its relentless incursions, we

begin to surrender the self's own autochthonous space/time struc-

turings and allow the digital to become the new regulator and container of our psychic existence. What once derived from an energy that is both in us and surpasses us is now external and cybernetically

produced, replacing our organic sense of the flow of existence with a

demanding other, to whose mechanical pulse we must adapt, in order

to continue to benefit from its riches. The virtuality inherent to the

digital disperses our psychic energy into the nothingness of cyberspace, cutting us off from the very source that once sustained us. The

only way to contain this dispersal, reel it back in, is to submit to the

digital's precise ordering of the world. As I finally relent and snap a

smartwatch to my wrist, I am stabilized by its predictable rhythms.

There's a terrible irony here, for the digital fractures the self and then

presents itself as that which can heal the fracture.

Of course, this is a partial description of what the intrusion of the

digital into our normal lives feels like. We want to be careful not to get

caught up in romanticizing the past, a worry we have had since the

[]{#index_split_006.html_p269}250 *Philosophical issues of the virtual*

beginning of this project as non-digital natives facing our own personal and historical sense of loss, in having lived through a pre-digital

era that is now vanishing. For us scribals, there is a sense of being overtaken by external rhythms foreign to what is natural to us. But not for a digital human. We need only think of those babies that before turning two are already conversant with a touch screen and are

learning to interact as easily and smoothly attuned to the digital world, as we claim the mediation of the screen is fracturing. We recently heard of a 6-year-old child who had a terrifying nightmare and,

after describing it to his parents the next morning, visibly disturbed,

exclaimed: "Something is wrong with my computer. It must be

broken!"

In acknowledging the hypnotic power of the digital to turn just

about everything into an easily digestible representation of reality, is

it possible to just stop for a moment and silently feel its weight, how it

immunizes us from the unformed, non-representable aspects of ex-

perience? Can we let ourselves perceive, in that silence, how the di-

gital presses against us, constricting and narrowing our range of

being? That vague and dull feeling of being over-saturated by too much time on the screen alerts us to what is being displaced. When

we replace human virtuality with digital virtuality something is

erased. Encased in its limiting frames, where everything is predictable

and controllable, we yearn for the whimsical spontaneity of non-

digital life.

Yet, at the same time, the vitality of the psyche is not as displaced now as we may think. The digital virtual has its own form of

spontaneity that offers a new kind of food for the psyche. The

unexpected associations and connections that can happen in the

virtual world animate and enrich our experience, opening us to its

prolific rhizomatic expansion. Consider the ever-new combina-

tions behind the undeniable explosion of creativity that we are

witnessing in all of the arts and sciences. The digital becomes a vessel for the very energy that feeds our most dynamic affective

and cognitive life.

It is easy for the non-natives among us to fall into the trap of blindly projecting onto that vitality our fears about what the digital

may be opening up and releasing into the world, like a kind of

modern-day Pandora's box, rather than seeing it as something in-

herent to who we are as humans and what we are potentially capable

of. It might be its de-repressive aspects that we most fear, its freeing

so much of the raw sexual and aggressive energy kept buried in the

culture. This anxiety is not surprising, since things are so radically breaking apart today. The self is fracturing, as the political, legal, social, religious, and ethical institutions that held it together are unraveling. Is it a de-structuring energy that is breaking open the

[]{#index_split_006.html_p270} *The tragedy of the virtual* 251

individual and cultural psyche in the name of new life and renewal?

Or is it a destructive energy, unleashing chaos and mayhem into the

social and political surrounds, as the Other becomes increasingly

intolerable or threatening, and violence inevitable. Are we before the

Apocalypse or is it a Renaissance?

[**1 Personal losses**](#index_split_000.html_p13)

[***a Digital mourning***](#index_split_000.html_p13)

As we have said from the very beginning, the way we deal with

technology -- how we conceive it, how we develop it -- hangs on the

attitude we hold towards loss and the ephemerality of experience.

The role the digital plays in our virtual lives can be gauged by the

ways in which we use it to manage the unpredictability and sheer

unruliness of life. The energy unleashed by the digital takes things

apart, making us ever more aware of the evanescent, while at the same time putting them back together, helping us face loss and

absence.

But, just as it is immensely complicated to know what it really

means to grieve a loss and come out on the other side, we don't know what it means, or if it is even possible, to mourn in the digital.

The digital is a real trickster when it comes to loss, for what better

means do we have today for disavowal than the virtual re-

constitution of the object? We can live in the illusion that nothing

has ever really passed because everything can always be recovered,

virtually. We are seduced by this promise of pure, death-denying

limitlessness, where there is no dispossession and thus nothing to

mourn.

And then, with just a slight shift in perspective, the whole digital

revolution seems at the same time to also be compelling us to wrestle

with the reality of loss and contingency like never before. Virtual worlds appear and suddenly vanish, and new ones take their place,

echoing and resonating with the coming-to-be-passing-away of our

mortal condition. The digital reveals something about the cease-

lessness of things ending. In its always indeterminate flux, it can teach us not how to deny loss, but how to bear it; how to creatively

respond to those de-structuring forces that live inside ourselves and

in the world. Though we have harshly criticized the constant

flooding of the psychic by the digital, that deluge spawns the play

beyond representation, and teaches us to let go; by its unceasing multiplication and generation of new life it leads us to a freer relationship with all that passes.

[]{#index_split_006.html_p271}252 *Philosophical issues of the virtual*

[***b Digital mirroring***](#index_split_000.html_p13)

The sweet melodious ring of the digital pulls us out of ourselves, impinging upon the immanence of our existence, what [Winnicott](#index_split_007.html_p297)

[(1960)](#index_split_007.html_p297) calls our going-on-being. For him, the alternative to being is reacting, which takes us outside of ourselves. "\[R\]eacting interrupts

being and annihilates" (p. 47). From the joyful self-forgetfulness of

ordinary, everyday life, we become reactive to the digital's demand

to take charge and return to the center of things. Yes, of course, we

can lose ourselves in virtual worlds as well, but we have become so

inured to the interruption, that we hardly notice its impingement

anymore.

Over-exposure to the digital can cause what Robert Jay [Lifton](#index_split_007.html_p297)

[(1982)](#index_split_007.html_p297) refers to as psychic numbing, that state of being where ordinary experience can no longer impress itself upon us. Unless it is

pretty hyped-up, it has no chance of getting in. Increasingly

benumbed, we are pulled to open up the most intimate spaces of

the self to the digital (sleep, dreams, fantasy, sexuality, as well as the

internal workings of our physiological life), as we crave its hyperre-

ality to penetrate and break through the very psychic situation it has engendered. In unconsciously seeking to find and recover our

loss of ordinary experience, we re-double our attachment and im-

mersion.

What does it mean to fall asleep while holding your phone (an *er-*

*satz* thumb), to prolong contact with it till the very moment at which you nod off, and then have it there, patiently waiting by your side,

when you wake up, especially if you awaken in the middle of the night? The digital fills the gap between waking and sleeping; it protects against the darkness of night with light and presence; it shields

us from silence and absence, making us less alone with our dark

thoughts, less afraid. The smartphone in our bed is analogous to the

child's teddy bear, helping to calm the distress of being alone while

facing the terrors of the night. It fills in the nearly imperceptible fis-

sures that occur in the transition from one state of being to the next.

But the smartphone, like the stuffed animal, is not only a transitional

object that helps us bear absence and separation. It is also, as we have

seen, a self-object, bestowing upon us an expansive mirroring of the self

that well surpasses what any parent can humanly offer to a child. We

have created an object that attends to you and only you, 24 non-stop

hours every day, awake or asleep. It's hard to let go of it, and no wonder

the panic when it is lost. Indeed, the average smartphone user (and god

only knows the fetishistic perversity implied in measuring this),

touches, swipes, or taps their phone 2617 times a day.

We find ourselves ill-equipped to move beyond this primary hunger

for mirroring. We fail to develop the necessary internal, psychological

[]{#index_split_006.html_p272} *The tragedy of the virtual* 253

faculties to bear and process what is other to the self. The digital, if we are not careful, can promote a self-object way-of-knowing the world,

where virtuality becomes a prop for the omnipotence of the self. We

buy into Facebook/Google/Amazon life because it offers a seemingly

limitless world entirely structured to narcissistically magnify who we

are and what we want. In our digital life, the world itself becomes an

all-giving self-object that creates the illusion that the not-me is eradicated; but it does so at the cost of the plentifulness of the everyday.

As we have seen, a self-object constructively feeds our omnipo-

tence and allows us to grow a self. But in order for development to

proceed, at some point that self-object has to become a transitional

one, so that we can begin to shape our narcissism in such a way that

it does not have to deny the reality of the other, but indeed can learn

to be fed from it. In our exploration of digital adolescence, we saw

this as a piercing by the world (so necessary for growth) of the nar-

cissistic cocoon from which the self emerges. A transitional object always has linkages beyond itself and its local realm; it's what brings

the psyche into the world of externality. Today, it seems we know all

too well how to make a child feel at home in our digital culture, but

we don't know how to help them with the shift from narcissism to

transitionality in life.

How do we bear witness to the spontaneity of our own being as

opposed to the spontaneity that's generated by the virtual? In the unending buzz and dazzle that encircles us, we deafen to the quieter

and more subtle inner voices, the ungovernable elements that are

played out in dreams and fantasy. Given the brightness and clamor

that emanates from the digital, it is nearly impossible to find the dark

vessel of quiet necessary to nurture our interior lives. We no longer know how to protect it -- or the interior lives of our children -- from its

intrusions. Because everything comes at us so quickly and clearly, so

proximal to the central self, the non-egoic dimensions of our psychic

life, that which is eccentric to it, slowly fades.

This infiltration into the psyche of highly concentrated digitized

virtuality, as it is unleashed and played out in the virtual world, causes

a collapse at the border between inner psychological truth and collective consciousness. We are no longer enriched by the meanings

generated from their intimate and kindred association, nor can we

make use of the vitality of their difference.

And to be as fair and pharmacological as possible, the question we keep returning to is whether digital virtuality is the cause of this collapse, or whether the digital is somehow, in some yet unforeseen way,

helping us to deal with a collapse that has already happened.

[Winnicott's (1963)](#index_split_007.html_p297) idea of the trauma that we anticipate, as a trauma that has already occurred, is helpful in seeing the digital as a placeholder for, a symptom of, perhaps a new form of virtuality. And yet,

[]{#index_split_006.html_p273}254 *Philosophical issues of the virtual*

because the digital is such a trickster, we use it to evade the very thing it could be trying to teach us about the mortal nature of the virtual itself.

Perhaps human virtuality is desperately trying to break through its di-

gital vessel, enacting a return of the repressed to which we have not yet

learned how to surrender or, much less even, begin to integrate.

[***c Digital melancholy***](#index_split_000.html_p13)

This paradox of technology that, on the one hand, extends the virtual

while, at the same time, obstructing it, has shadowed every position

and stance that we have explored with regard to the digital revolution.

It might be profitable, then, to take another look to try to understand

existentially how human virtuality is being affected by digital technology. We are indeed ontological centaurs, strange creatures with

one foot in the finite world of material life and one foot in the infinite

world of the virtual. Human being nowadays stands in a place where

the fundamental tension between the infinite virtual, and the finite,

concrete real is coming undone. It is the most paradoxical of circumstances, where what we dream up inside ourselves is threatened

by the unlimited possibilities offered to us in the virtual world.

[Adam Phillips (2012)](#index_split_007.html_p296) explores this paradoxical dynamic as it arises in our mental lives. He calls it "the haunting myth of our own potential", characterizing it in these words:

... much of our so-called mental life is about the lives we are not

living, the lives we are missing out on, the lives we could be

leading but for some reason are not. (p. xi)

Phillips explores the dynamics or grammar of that spectral space, the

haunted relation between our actual lives and their unrealized po-

tential. Not only does imagination craft the life we lead (in the forms

of society, language and culture); it also shadows that life with an unlimited number of unrealized possibilities that stalk it. Digital technology may be a response to (and indeed often a monstrous

magnification of) that very stalking, for it introduces a radically new

way of "actualizing" our unlived desire, where we can lead the lives we

are missing out on, virtually. For instance, in Second Life, I can live as

a man while I am a woman in my everyday experience. Or, as desire

becomes potentiated in the virtual world, it can spill over into real life, with excessive and sometimes destructive effects, as we saw in *U.S.S.*

*Callister* [(cf., Chapter 7),](#index_split_004.html_p186) where someone bullied in real life was able to get back at those that abused him, thus actualizing (virtually) his desire for revenge in ways that were unimaginable before our time.

Thanks to the digital, we can now reach back and re-encounter

moments from our youth and past relationships -- the lost objects of

[]{#index_split_006.html_p274} *The tragedy of the virtual* 255

our college days, for example, that we have been able to locate

from the archival wealth of the web -- and re-live them in the present.

In our virtual life, the object of our melancholic fantasy

("I missed my chance with this person and can never get it back") is

restored and our desires fulfilled (or shattered) in unforeseen ways.

One of the most extreme forms of haunting that result from the social

media is the creeping anxiety we begin to feel, as -- exposed to the lives

of so many people -- we find ourselves continuously and masochisti-

cally measuring our own lives against them, with all the things they

do or have, which we don't. Watching the many stories in Instagram

or Facebook can be a very erosive and indeed often corrosive experi-

ence, because we long to be there and enjoy the wealth of the lives we

are voyeuristically watching, instead of reflecting on that feeling that

we are missing out, alone as we are, on the other side.

The intercourse between the virtual and the actual is intrinsic to who we are today. Neither stands alone. The imagination of possibilities and their digital expression, and the paths we have taken in our

concrete lives to actualize them, are fundamentally and inseparably united. This intermingling of the actual and the virtual involves not

just, as Phillips (2012) points out, our having to live a "double life,"

"somewhere between the lives we have and the lives we would like"

(p. xi), but a "triple life," for in the digital age we are all learning to live suspended in the tension between the virtual, the actual, and the

digital virtual.

For us today, the unrealized potential dwelling in our minds can

now be instantly actualized. Digital technology complicates the difficulty of our dual nature by materializing the virtual in the digital and

interweaving it with the real. The ontological centaur acquires a fur-

ther dimension, so how do we learn to think and live as *digital* centaurs? For Phillips, we need to "think ourselves as always living a double life, the one that we wish for and the one that we practise; the

one that never happens and the one that keeps happening." (p. xviii).

This new tripling of virtual/actual/digital literally casts us into an intensified version of this drama. There is "the one that never happens" (what always stays inside the mind); and now two adjoining

tracks that always happen, in the real world and in the digital.

As desiring creatures, we are always, in some sense, missing out, for

it is lack that constitutes desire. The digital collapses the paradoxical

tension between the virtual and the actual, profoundly affecting the

space between what never happened and what is always happening.

Unable to bear missing out, to tolerate the unlived lives that we will

never live, we turn the digital into an escape or a refuge. In the illusory belief that digital virtuality can overcome lack, we may be enacting the very form of disavowal that is at the core of perversion, according

to Freud.

[]{#index_split_006.html_p275}256 *Philosophical issues of the virtual*

[***d Digital narcissism***](#index_split_000.html_p13)

Digital virtuality empowers a bold and expressive self, hungry for af-

filiation and partnership. It increases the speed by which we can contact the other, making him more accessible, our relationship more

concentrated, more intimate, more focused. It does away with spatial

limitations, brings people closer together, and frees us from being pigeonholed because of our appearance, race, cultural background,

etc. It helps to open the self toward the world, creating fairer and more

democratic spaces, where a fuller relationship to our common

humanity can occur. Our relational lives are broadened, as more and

more people can become important to us, and the events that happen

around us take on ever greater significance. We feel more connected

to our intimate circle of friends and family, our communities (digital

and otherwise), and to the larger social and political movements afoot

in the world. Linked to the same events simultaneously, we are more

than just a global village, we sometimes seem to be a single mind. In

the experience we had with the fire in the Cathedral of Notre Dame,

for example, where the whole world shared their thoughts and feel-

ings over the catastrophe happening online in real time, the virtual

world dissolved the natural barriers that constitute our individualities,

and amplified our experience of the world from our individual corners

into a global space.

The digital takes away many of the obstacles that in the physical world prevent us from taking action. It expands the reach of our agency; it makes it easier to take charge of things and we feel a potent

sense of efficacy in our lives. Because one of its main outputs is affectively charged, life-vitalizing meaning, it is no wonder that we are

so eager to embrace its actualizations. If it is an addiction, it's an ad-

diction to that which gives intensity and passion, and those are

qualities we can never be in too short supply of.

However, this extraordinary sense of agency is shadowed by how

the digital also unleashes the narcissistic strivings of our unconscious

self. The very same appetite for intensive self expansion, can, in nearly

imperceptible ways, devolve into a kind of self-aggrandizement which

pushes us ever further into the all-too-human tendency to diminish,

and even negate, the other. The strivings of the virtual self enact an

expansiveness of the subject that has the potential to do violence to

human intimacy since it depends upon the cues that come from close

physical proximity. In that digital maneuver of being close in yet far

away, we are unable to encounter the embodied presence of others; we

become impervious of them and they of us, for as Gianpiero Petriglieri

says of the Zoom encounter, there is a plausible deniability of every-

one's absence:

[]{#index_split_006.html_p276} *The tragedy of the virtual* 257

Our minds are tricked into the idea of being together when our

bodies feel we're not. Dissonance is exhausting\... It's easier being

in each other's presence, or in each other's absence, than in the

constant presence of each other's absence. Our bodies process so

much context, so much information, in encounters, that meeting

on video is being a weird kind of blindfolded. *We sense too little*

*and can't imagine enough*. That single deprivation requires a lot of effort. (Twitter Feed \@Petriglieri, April 4, [2020)](#index_split_007.html_p296)

Digitality grants us command over the virtual. It allows us to modulate our relationship to the other, to procure through the screen what I want and need from them to feed my own desires. As a byproduct of the narcissism that is its life-blood, the digital becomes a

weapon of subjugation.

Few people write as lucidly of our inalienable self-involvement as the Irish novelist John [Banville (2000).](#index_split_007.html_p296)

There is in me, deep down....a part that does not care for anything

other than itself. I could lose everything and everyone and that

pilot light would still be burning at my centre, that steady flame

that nothing will quench, until the final quenching. (p. 30)

The digital reaches to the core of my being. It fuels that pilot light for

us today in a way that is incomparable to anything that has come before. With my orgy of clicking [(Gertz, 2018),](#index_split_007.html_p296) I become omnipotent and immortal, the other be damned! If the narcissism within us can

never be domesticated, what does it mean for us as a species to finally

have at our disposal near total control of the virtual?

[**2 Collective losses**](#index_split_000.html_p13)

[***a Virtual privacy***](#index_split_000.html_p13)

Derrida (Derrida and Stiegler 2002) remarks on the erosion of our fa-

miliar distinction between public and private by the intrusion of the

"telepowers." That intrusion has grown today, some 20 years later, as

virtual reality has been liberated from its encasement in the private screen to emerge into the shared, public spaces of our lives. Since we

feel freer and at the same time more compelled to expose our inner-

most self within the safe confines of the virtual world, and, since our

devices are with us wherever we go, we find ourselves engaging with

the intimate dimensions of our private digital lives in public, regardless of where we are or who might be around. Since there are very

few, if any, places left where our technological extensions are prohibited, public life and digital life have become nearly synonymous.

[]{#index_split_006.html_p277}258 *Philosophical issues of the virtual*

This ever greater tolerance for the digital presence in collective life is

the counterpart to its seeping into our most intimate spaces and pri-

vate acts. Fantasies that used to be contained within ourselves are acted out, first in virtual reality, and now outside in the world.

An unconscious resistance overtakes us when someone tries to pull

us out of our digital immersion, calling us to the demands of life that

are happening right now, there before us. Once in the grip of

that resistance, we feel empowered to refuse the demand for tolerance

that has always helped to contain communal life and keep our discourse and relational exchanges civil and relatively peaceful. In that

refusal, we liberate ourselves from the frustrating and "annoying" (as

the digital youth call it) impositions that others make upon us. When

the others are virtualized, as we have learned, they do not impinge in the same way. The digital screen becomes a protective layer, a sleeve that precisely allows us to determine how much of the other we

let in and how much we decide to keep out.

In the same way that inner, psychological space has become so

unbearable that we flee to our phones (e.g., in moments of transition)

when we cannot tolerate the impending feeling of absence or emp-

tiness, we are equally compelled to retreat into our private, virtual world whenever we enter public space. This may be an attempt to deal

with the overexposure that we are subjected to, with the omnipresent

camera, always there, just at the edge of our awareness. Enter nearly

any store today, look up, and there you are on the video monitor.

Whatever city street we happen to be walking on, whatever building

we might wander into, the feeling of being surveilled is with us all the

time. Paranoid and suspicious of each other, we retreat further into our virtual worlds, as a response to the dysphoria generated by the ever-present watching eye. The smartphone becomes a line of flight, a

means of escape, in pursuit of the very privacy and internal space that

has been sacrificed.

And paradoxically, that public space seems to have emptied out.

The earbud/screen nature of digital life makes it feel as if there is no

communal space that we are sharing together, each of us is so singularly locked into a world that is always somewhere else. We are not

really there, and there is the growing sense that no one else is either.

Deaf and blind to the aesthetics of shared space, our social surrounds

begin to feel antiseptic and deadened, like the waiting room of a doctor's office.

When we are at the airport, for example, we buy our packaged

drinks and snacks, locate the nearest charging station, and take a seat,

crowded in with everyone else. Needing to disconnect from an in-

creasingly cold, unoccupiable, non-human environment, we dive into

our virtual cocoon. So as to escape from where we are and who we are

with, we psychically anesthetize ourselves in an obsessive engagement

[]{#index_split_006.html_p278} *The tragedy of the virtual* 259

with our devices. Overexposed in our private life due to the digital, we flee further inside it in a vicious circle that starts to seep into collective life as well, leaving the space inside the screen as the only

inhabitable place left.

Look around in a subway car, or a crowded bus stop, and notice the

small crises of dissociation happening. Everyone swept into their own

mini-world of self-interest and concerns that causes our awareness of

the primacy of communal engagement to recede. The polis is erased.

The all-important encounter with the other, at the root of inter-

subjective life, shifts from outside in public space to inside the private-

digital, making the already deadening and claustrophobic outside

spaces to feel even more closed-in and lifeless. Compare, for example,

Starbucks, the prime instance of the sanitized coffeehouse and Caffè

Florian, which, on the contrary, is famous for its bohemian ambiance,

glamour and social effervescence. The exchange between people in a

Starbucks no longer happens in the context of lively shared social engagement as it does in the famous Venetian cafe, but in the private

space of earbuds and screens. In both, talking and gesturing abound,

but in the franchise, nearly all of it is turned inward, toward a ghostly

other, an absent presence.

Although the turn to our screens shields us from the demands and

realities of public life, it should also be noted that the digital has added an entirely unique aspect to private life. Through the security of

our phones we are taken into this new space of connection and digital

interaction. We may be alone and alienated from those that are in our

immediate physical proximity, but inside our shared virtual worlds we

feel closely connected to whomever we might be chatting with. We

experience two moods simultaneously: the intimacy of a living room

and the estrangement of a public square.

Consider the virtual connections that have become an indis-

pensable means to live a social and professional life. The virtual other

is both here in our lives and at the same time not. This new form of

contact engenders a truly distinctive source of intersubjective spontaneity. Whenever I crave the immediacy of the distant other, I can

call her forth and, presto!, there she is, right in front of me. Without

the encumbrance of having to traverse physical space and time, we videochat, in any public space, as, for example, when I am riding the

train, shopping in the market, walking across the mall, surrounded by

actual others who are then compelled to bear witness to this very peculiar display of private/public behavior.

But with a slight change of perspective, nothing that important

seems to be really lost. Instead, we perhaps notice something positive

previously occluded by our bias. New venues for communication with

the other open up, where there is less hiding and more transparency

(even if, at times, involuntary). Nowadays it is common for people to

[]{#index_split_006.html_p279}260 *Philosophical issues of the virtual*

showcase their private interactions with others in a platform where others can enter freely, make comments and interact in various ways

through the open chat room. Little by little, it seems, we are starting

to loose our reservations about letting people witness whatever is taking place in our personal spaces, so that it seems everyone now can

have their own show, as many people do now, for example, in

Instagram Live. And as our portable devices become more sophisti-

cated, allowing us ever more frequent immediacy with the other, the

public becomes private, the private public until, eventually, there is

no difference between them. Indeed, the very boundary that held

them in some kind of livable tension rapidly dissipates.

[***b Virtual containment***](#index_split_000.html_p13)

In its investigations of the unconscious dynamics of our interior lives,

psychoanalysis repeatedly stumbles over the question as to the difference between satisfying an impulse in actual life (reality) in contrast to the mode of satisfaction that is intrinsic to the mind (fantasy).

The actualization of a desire within the realm of fantasy, dream and

memory -- all dimensions of the virtual within -- uncannily echoes its

counterpart in the real. When we dream of doing something we really

want to do, it's as if we have actually done it. But what criteria do we

have for the comparison between actual and imagined gratification?

Virtual satisfaction can match, and even exceed, at times, the satisfactions that happen in the real. But isn't any satisfaction always rooted in some kind of unfathomable mix of virtual and actual?

Fantasies seldom stay inside as pure fantasies. They are most often

accompanied by a drive for action, for some form of actualization outside the mind. We find ourselves caught up in the ubiquitous

struggle to contend with the impulses embedded in our fantasies, that

urge for action. We want something, and become frustrated or angry

when our desire is thwarted. We feel envy when someone else has

what we want and we do not. Desire's lack draws us out toward people

and objects, in a never-ending quest for satisfaction or permanence.

Acting out describes a psychic breakdown in which a person is

compelled to live something out in actual life that cannot, but most

likely should, be held within the space of their own mind. It

represents a failure of containment, where what cannot be psychically

metabolized is unconsciously thrust against the world, often in

destructive and harmful ways. For example, consider the common

experience of discharging one's anger against another person because

of an inability to process within oneself the underlying affects that gave rise to that aggressive outburst, whether it be sadness, jealousy,

rejection, etc. We can't hold something inside, so we force it to the

outside, on to the other.

[]{#index_split_006.html_p280} *The tragedy of the virtual* 261

This characterization of acting out assumes its opposite, that there is

a way of containing (or expressing, satisfying, fulfilling) our instinctually driven lives that converts what we are compelled to express

literally, in an impulsively driven act, into a non-action action. Here,

the impulse is held and experienced as a psychological rather than literal reality. The psychic processes of the mind --reflection, mentalization, metabolization, etc. -- help us de-literalize, and thus contain

our impulses, holding them as metaphoric or symbolic or virtual

realities. The experiential fulfilment may take place in one's dream or

fantasy life, or, in how it changes and affects one's psychological comportment and attunement to the world. Holding the tension of

an impulse and experiencing it as a psychic rather than a literal rea-

lity, opens us to different dimensions of the world, aspects of existence often difficult to bear, yet important to face; these are erased

when the impulse is acted out.

The digital virtual provides us a new means of obtaining the ex-

periential fulfilment of our desires that -like the virtual within -- does

not require an actual other or object or specific place or time. But-unlike the virtual within -- it can happen on-demand, exactly when

we want it to. What does it mean to satisfy our desires in virtual reality, and how do such fulfilments mark the real?

With the advent of virtual reality, the difference between psychic expression and literal action gets terribly obscured. Given how accurate our simulations are becoming, it is now evermore difficult to distinguish whether an experience happened virtually or actually,

online or offline. All sorts of tensions are collapsing and new ones arising. We are forced to re-think what acting out can even mean in

our time, given how the digital is able to provide such a rich and accessible platform for the enactment of our innermost fantasies and

desires. And as we struggle to understand the consequences of this new mode of instantaneous, on-demand wish fulfilment, we have to

come to terms with the meaning of this difference for our virtual lives.

Virtual reality may very well be the preeminent space for the exploration of psychic fantasy and active imagination, which Jung calls

dreaming the dream onward. By granting experiential fulfillment to

our most primordial drives, it lets us live out our impulses as virtual

realities, thus providing a crucial safeguard against their being

(consciously or unconsciously) acted out in the world. Virtual reality

and psychic reality are close and intimate cousins, each mutually

extending and drawing each other out. The virtual can replicate the

inner workings of dream and fantasy only now in a realm outside of

ourselves that is much easier to access and control.

Once again, in the spirit of the pharmakon, we are brought face-to-

face with a central paradox: on the one hand, the virtual world pro-

vides expression and containment for our impulse-driven lives,

[]{#index_split_006.html_p281}262 *Philosophical issues of the virtual*

furthering, as it were, our own psychic virtuality, and thus, diminishing our tendency to act out, while, on the other, it can become the

perfect platform for evacuating those impulses within ourselves that

we are no longer able to contain or bear.

In the course of these chapters, we have made many positive links

between virtual reality and Winnicottian potential space, that bal-

ancing point between fantasy and reality that allows for the actuali-

zation of our inner virtuality. From this vantage point, it seems reasonable to consider the digital virtual as an outstanding form of potential space, which fusing together our most vital desires to this dreamspace of experiential gratification, liberates the imagination,

giving life purpose, direction, and intensity.

Virtual space enlivens and animates the play that is always taking

place between self and other. Since the risk of action in the virtual world is relatively small compared to what we live out in the real, it

offers a powerful mode of containment, for we can be a lot less careful

about our use of the other as a screen upon which to enact our pro-

jections. This protected, sheltering quality engenders a nurturing

space for the free expression of desire to chart its own path, sexual and

otherwise, as we can live out any identification we want, become any

new kind of self or inhabit any new kind of other. We are emancipated from the religious, economic, gender, and political strictures that have so restrained us. Libido, desire, the force of our sexuality and

the play of our narcissism, can be given freer reign.

However, the capacity of the digital for containing and expressing

our impulses and desires can precipitously flip into its opposite, and

empower a highly intensified form of acting out. As we know from everyday life, states of psychic equilibrium, -- where we feel certain that we have a good handle on a particular yearning, and are doing

well at containing it -- can suddenly and unexpectedly devolve into a

moment of impulsive action. The same can occur, in a more magni-

fied and dramatic way, in the virtual world. Desire finds itself narcissistically encased inside a hallucinatory reality that is blindly driven toward its own fulfillment.

The unending possibilities of the digital virtual can suddenly turn

into a dystopian space for psychic disavowal, a crass home for trol-

ling and ghosting, where the worst tendencies in ourselves are acted-

out upon a virtual stage, now shared by all. The virtual world enables

us to blow by the reality of the other in the name of our narcissis-

tically driven satisfactions. We see this emblematically in the eroti-

cally driven, aggressive everydayness of our social media lives. Or, in

an even more sinister way, by the use of Twitter and Facebook for political gains. There is a persistent temptation (or even a habit now)

to use it as an evacuatory chamber for what is most disavowed in ourselves.

[]{#index_split_006.html_p282} *The tragedy of the virtual* 263

[***c Virtual leaking***](#index_split_000.html_p13)

As our fantasy lives take up residence in the actualizations offered by

the virtual, something about the precarious balance between con-

taining an impulse and acting it out is profoundly and dangerously

destabilized. Masud [Khan (1993)](#index_split_007.html_p297) describes how certain individuals who suffer from an incapacity to dream -by which he means that they

cannot actualize within their own psyche the experiential space in which a dream occurs -- find themselves exploiting social space to act

out their fantasies. In the newly proliferating forms of mass violence,

as our innermost fantasies of mayhem, death and destruction are

acted out in the public square, what, for Khan, was exploitation, takes

on a more malignant turn today. The very impulses, aggressive and destructive in their nature, that the virtual has given us so much opportunity to explore safely within its secure borders, seems now to

be escaping from its digital container and entering our shared empirical world.

New forms of mass violence are taking place all over the world: mass

shootings in nightclubs, movie theaters, concert halls, schools, houses

of worship, the proliferation of vehicle-ramming attacks, bombs being

set off at city events, etc. as well as the rising anger and aggressiveness aimed at whoever is different than us (i.e., the denigration of the immigrant, the foreigner, the stranger, the other). The ugliness and destructiveness inherent to everyday social life that has always been

with us is sorely aggravated by the digital.

These new modes of violent acting out and denigration of the other

uncannily resonate with the particular structure of the self-other re-

lationship that flourishes in the virtual world. Rather than un-

consciously turning toward social space to act out my dreams and

fantasies, I can now freely exploit the virtual. In VR I can let loose and

do whatever I want. I immerse myself in a space in which being able to

play-out my aggression toward others stirs up great excitement and passion. I can maltreat and abuse them, and ultimately destroy them

at my will; and, if I am so moved, I can do it over and over again, with

total impunity. But, as we have seen with the protagonist of *Black* *Mirror*' *s U.S.S. Calister*, or with what happens on the dark web, or even Twitter, this can take its own spontaneously destructive turn.

The violence that is opened up by digital virtuality is no longer contained by the screen, it seems to be leaking out everywhere.

Consider this recent story from the *New York Times*:

Duped by a man she met on the Internet who lived nearly 4,000

miles away, an 18-year-old Alaskan woman lured her best friend to

a popular trailhead and carried out a murder-for-hire plot on the

promise of millions \[....\] Six people \[were\] ... arrested in the case,

[]{#index_split_006.html_p283}264 *Philosophical issues of the virtual*

which the authorities described as a catfishing scheme. Catfishing

is when a person uses a false identity online to lure someone into a

relationship. Mr. Schilmiller \[the anonymous figure behind the

scene\]\[...\] directed Ms. Brehmer \[the 18 year old\] to sexually

assault two minors and send him videos of those crimes \[...\]

Mr. Schilmiller told investigators that Ms. Brehmer communi-

cated with him throughout the killing, and sent him Snapchat

photos and videos of Ms. Hoffman \[the murder victim\] when she

was tied up and after she was killed. [(Vigdor, 2019,](#index_split_007.html_p297) p. 23) For the protagonists of this story, it is clear that the distinction between virtual and real destructiveness is no longer operative.

In addition to these overt acts of violence that mimic the ethos of

the virtual world, there are also more subtle ways in which the digital

has become the new carrier of human aggression. Cyberbullying and

trolling are obvious examples. It seems no longer necessary or perhaps

not even possible anymore (as is poignantly evident in the aggression

and verbal violence enacted in the digital networks) to process within

oneself the underlying affects that give rise to our negative feelings,

which we so easily now force on to the other in the virtual space of the

social media.

Moreover, in a kind of everyday posture when in public, we strap

our devices to our belts (like a kind of digital open carry) so that they

are there, ready at hand, to defend or aggress. Whether it's whipping

out our phones to look something up to prove someone wrong when

we are in an argument or precipitously snapping a picture or filming

the action in a tense situation, especially where there is a conflict of

interest. We dissuade or threaten, implying, "I am now capturing your

words (or your actions, or that little piece of reality that is in contention between us), so you better watch yourself." Digital surveillance is not only done by governments and corporations now;

individuals also use their own private tracking devices to spy, ensnare,

and entrap.

When these new virtual rules set the standard for our social beha-

viors, the other in real life becomes as dispensable as the virtual object

on our screen. There is an imperiousness to digital behavior, a lack of

empathy for the other, that threatens civility and abrogates our sense

of what it means to live as a local citizen with neighbors, rather than

as a digital citizen linked to virtual others. Disconnected from our common humanity, we do not know what to do with the odd feelings

that are aroused by the robotic voice that replaces the human, when

sharing personal information on the phone, or when we are having

trouble keying-in our food order on a touchscreen (with the cashier

standing right across from us, sneering, instead of helping). We become victims of digital objectification and as a consequence find

[]{#index_split_006.html_p284} *The tragedy of the virtual* 265

ourselves, unwittingly, objectifying the world around us. Deep down

inside the omnipotent self, we feel entitled, for example, to walk down the street looking at our screens, carelessly bumping into people

as if they were mere objects in our way; or to text and drive, recklessly

endangering not only our own lives, but the lives of everyone else.

What is problematic for the individual, and even worse for the

culture, is when we start treating real others in our lives as mere ex-

tensions of our own selves. We expect the world to behave like the digital, where there are no limits to what we can have, as everything is

repeatable and replaceable so we can casually dismiss the fact that others are separate centers of subjectivity.

Digital virtuality offers a powerful way of enframing experience so

that there is less friction and obstacle between the self and what it desires, as well as what it disdains and wants to assail against. That self-aggrandizing mode of relating to the world has such a powerful

grip on us that though the laptop might be closed, the phone on a shelf charging, somehow the digital is still pulsing through us as we

make our way through the interpersonal spaces of the world. It is not

so simple as just switching-off, or taking a digital-free holiday away from it.

[**3 Ontological losses**](#index_split_000.html_p13)

However lonely in appearance, a color is in the company of its kin

-all its potential variations. The spectrum is the invisible grip

background against which «a» color stands out. It is the ever

present virtual whole of each color apart.

Brian [Massumi (2011)](#index_split_007.html_p297)

[***a Digital transparency***](#index_split_000.html_p13)

[Jung (1971)](#index_split_007.html_p296) is famous for saying: "The psyche creates reality everyday.

The only expression I can use for this activity is fantasy" (p. 52.) As the digital infinitely expands the horizons of our thinking and feeling life,

it serves as a great awakener of psychic fantasy. We scroll through our

social media and news feeds hungry for images and narratives that will set the imagination in play. Whether participating in multiplayer

video games, assuming the role of an avatar in a Second Life--like setting, or tapping into the vast array of erotic possibilities available in the virtual world, the symbolic and metaphorical dimensions of the

mind are emboldened. Like sulphur, the digital ignites fantasy and inflames desire. Psyche comes alive, becomes real, in the virtual world.

The digital opens up shared, collective spaces for dreaming that

approximate the imaginative occurrences within ourselves, as we

fantasize and have reveries about each other and our experiences.

[]{#index_split_006.html_p285}266 *Philosophical issues of the virtual*

Indeed, what would Jung -- who urges us to dream the dream onward

and actively engage with the denizens of our imaginal lives -- think of

the dreamscapes opened up by virtual reality? Would he not affirm their potential for making contact with the creative psyche? And

wouldn't the Freud who wants to free us from sexual repression, extol

the erotic possibilities opened up in cyberspace, as they give expres-

sion to every form of polymorphous perversion, lifting out of re-

pression an unending variety of sexual combinatory practices? The

virtual world provides an immediately engageable, free-associative

platform for fantasy that enables us to become conscious and inter-

active participants in the dreaming experience. And just like the inner

world of psychic reality, where we engage our fantasies without

having to act them out in the world of "real" others, the virtual offers

a parallel mode of containment, where what we most ardently desire

can be lived out "virtually" rather than "actually."

We have been staging the ongoing dialogue between the virtuality

that lives inside us in the form of the virtual within and digital vir-

tuality, where the very fantasies that lie latent in the mind come to life

on the screen, with ever greater immediacy, precision and clarity, as

our technological sophistication advances. We have understood the

irresistible draw of the digital in terms of its capacity to transform the

dullness of the everyday into moments where a passing thought, a

whisp of an idea, can suddenly spring to life, appearing before our eyes, as virtually real. This possibility for instantaneous revitalization

becomes a powerful seduction, an ongoing temptation to turn to the

digital in order to enliven the mind, stir the imagination. What we pursue in the virtual world is not so different, in this sense, from what

we seek with certain mind-altering drugs. With digitality, however, we

are able to deliberately modulate our virtual dreams in a way we are

unable to with anything else.

We have insisted upon keeping an eye on the transit between the

ordinary occurrence of mind in "real" life and this elevated and

somewhat transcendent state of experience, where meaning and

intensity are always ready-to-hand. We have spoken about the losses

that occur in the leave-taking to the digital, which we steadfastly refuse to acknowledge, as we strive to keep those departures veiled

from ourselves and those around us. Indeed as we become more

virtually connected to each other, surrounded by interactive in-

telligent gadgets that begin to make our digital life seamlessly feed

into our "real" life, a hope arises that they will become so well blended together, that we will lose all awareness of when we leave

one to enter the other and thus ultimately arrive at [Floridi's (2014)](#index_split_007.html_p296)

utopian "on-life".

It's as if the ultimate aim of this infusion of digital virtuality into

the everyday real is to reproduce within the experience of our digital

[]{#index_split_006.html_p286} *The tragedy of the virtual* 267

lives the complex awareness that takes place when we sleep. [As Nancy](#index_split_007.html_p297)

[(2009)](#index_split_007.html_p297) describes it:

The quite singular awareness of the dream \[is such\] that this

awareness thinks itself, and does not think itself as awareness of a

world contrasted with it as a waking world is. At every instant the

dreamer thinks he is in the waking world and knows he is in the

dream world, whose simultaneities, compossibilities, confusions

do not escape him, but also do not surprise him enough to make

him emerge from the dream. (p. 8)

We read Nancy's distinction between the dreamer thinking he is in the waking world and yet knowing he is in the dream world, as involving the difference between experiencing the dream (as if you are

awake, and in your actual life), and a kind of pre-knowledge that forms a backdrop to dreaming awareness in which in some sense you

"know" you are in the dream world.

This "quite singular awareness" which does not differentiate be-

tween a dreaming and a waking world, but somehow manages to hold

both together is parallel to what happens for the infant in transitional

space. As Winnicott explains:

the essential feature in the concept of transitional objects and

phenomena is *the paradox, and the acceptance of the paradox:* the baby creates the object but the object was there waiting to be

created and to become a cathected object ... \[I\]n the rules of the

game we all know that we will never challenge the baby to elicit

an answer to the question: did you create that or did you find it?

[(Winnicott, 1971,](#index_split_007.html_p297) p. 89)

This background "knowing" can suddenly emerge when something in

the dream becomes too disturbing and we signal to ourselves that this

is only a dream and wake ourselves up. In that moment, the dream's

simultaneities, confusions, etc. break through the illusion that what is

happening in the dream is actually occurring in waking life. This dexterous singularity of awareness falters, potential space breaks down

and the dream and waking world clash. But then the paradox is

refused, for we do indeed elicit an answer to the question: are you actually awake or is this just a dream?

The aspiration for us today as virtual reality pioneers seems to be to

create this same kind of singular awareness, where real life and virtual

life are held together in some form of potential space where it no longer occurs to ask, "Did you create that or did you find it?" We seek

to effect a transitional space for our digital lives, where we can learn to hold and accept, without challenge, its many paradoxes.

[]{#index_split_006.html_p287}268 *Philosophical issues of the virtual*

One example of such a paradox is that while in virtual space we can

partake of the dreaming experience without being asleep. Virtuality is

akin to a waking dream, where we move around in a fantasied world,

not of our own making, yet we are awake and aware. Any type of imaginative engagement, whether it be art, film, drama, literature, or

music, offers us some version of this waking dream experience. But virtual reality, in its creation of an immersive, three-dimensional world, which fully captures and engages our whole being, is second

only to our actual dreaming life. And here too, we are free to act without consequences, in accordance with our own inclinations and

in total anonymity.

Because of its unparalleled immersive quality, it is easier to lose or escape from ourselves in virtual reality than it is in our ordinary engagement with the arts or in the occurrence of our everyday fantasy lives. Whether watching a show, painting a picture, writing a poem, reading a book, or gossiping with friends, we are inside these activities

at the same time as we are in the world. The ongoing impingements of

life, as our attention wavers or we are brought back to something we

had tried to forget, keeps the two, virtual and real, in some kind of inescapable, dynamic tension. When we engage our virtuality through

the arts, we learn creative and generative ways to cultivate this tension,

what Gordon [Bearn (2013)](#index_split_007.html_p296) calls "life drawing." Even though we have not yet made dinner, or figured out what to do about the children's homework, we struggle to bring our attention back to what we were reading or listening to, the poem that we were writing, the conversations that we were having, etc., re-finding the potential space that is always vulnerable to break-down and loss. Unlike the total envelop-ment of the dream, they remain distinct, and we always find ourselves

with one foot in each world. Other than a nightmare waking us up, there's no real worry about the breakdown of potential space when we

dream. Ordinarily we take it for granted that we stay enveloped inside

the dream, even though there can be a back-and-forth shift of perspectives between being inside the events that are happening to us and

being outside them, as an observer, at some distance. These alterations

of awareness seem to have a life of their own, as different dreamscapes

evoke different moments on the spectrum between identification and

dis-identification with the dreaming "I."

In contrast, in our engagement with virtual reality, our everyday

consciousness is highly involved in setting the stage, choosing which

characters to identify with and deciding from which perspective to view the action. In virtual reality, the ego has near total jurisdiction

over how things happen, how a particular scene will ultimately un-

fold, whereas the events of a dream seem to just happen on their own

accord. They arise "from a situation that I am in and, as I, do not define or create" [(Scott, 2007,](#index_split_007.html_p297) p. 147). As it gives itself over to the

[]{#index_split_006.html_p288} *The tragedy of the virtual* 269

shifting identifications with the events and people on the dream

stage, there is more porousness to the dreaming self than its waking

counterpart.

In virtual reality there is, however, as we have seen in many instances, a similar kind of free and open plasticity at play, a shape-shifting and fluid occurence of our own multiplicity, with many new

possibilities for cross-and-counter identifications that are very nourishing to experience in the world. When we dream, however, we do

not stop and question that this fluidity of encounter, where one

person or event or affective reality can so spontaneously morph into

another, is anything other than an experience of waking life in a dreaming world. The existential force of the dream is an outgrowth of

this highly condensed medium where affect and existence coalesce,

where the dreamer is fully engaged with the expressive singularity of

what he or she is living in the moment.

But in the virtual world, where we leave our body behind, and give

ourselves over entirely to the artificial fluidity of the algorithmic guide, a dissociation occurs. Our engagement is held by a wounded thread that results from the excision of our body from the proceedings

and a full dependence on the structures predetermined by the net.

When we watch our dreams being played out on a screen, especially

one that is programmed for us, the free arising, naturally spontaneous

psychic image is subdued. In order for the virtual to manifest as virtual

reality, an existential thinning of experience occurs, as we have

already seen.

Dreams are not simply a projection, whose every character wears a

mask that hides the self, as we saw with Freud (and which is even more central in Jung). Quite the contrary, the worldliness of the dream and its characters have an autonomy all their own that is not of

our making and certainly cannot be reduced to only a projection of

the self. When we dream, we are profoundly engaged with the

otherness of our existence. Digitally induced virtual worlds try to overcome the unbridgeable gap that separates dream life from waking

life by creating a virtual other that is now under our control. However,

simulated otherness and actual otherness are fundamentally different

and we must come to terms with the existential impoverishment of

the former. Or are they so different? Awake or asleep, we are always

dreaming. It's just that now there is another way.

Dreams are remarkably elusive, fundamentally outside our control.

When we go to sleep at night, we never know where they will take us,

and when we awaken, we struggle to recapture the affective quality of

the events that were lived with such immediacy during the night. Our

efforts at retrieval go only so far, for no matter how hard we try, the

recollected dream is permeated with gaps and absences, the losses of

unrecoverable experience. The impossibility of bringing the dream

[]{#index_split_006.html_p289}270 *Philosophical issues of the virtual*

back into full presence, its withdrawing, evanescent quality, evokes the non-representational dimensions of the psyche that we have repeatedly been calling forth. Perhaps the digital is so gripping because

it persuades us to believe that nothing escapes its representation, that

everything is susceptible to being digitized without remainder; and thus we can finally vanquish, as perhaps no other technology

has so effectively done ever before, the ineffable aspects of human experience.

As whatever we fantasize about can be represented to us, instantly,

just as we imagine it, this mode of virtuality diminishes the need for

the creative and emotional struggle required by the work of the

imagination. But it also activates our insatiable cravings to have rea-

lity conform to our wishes, seducing us into the hybris inherent to technological power. The Promethean Titanism that triggers and

is triggered by it is essentially oblivious of what stands beyond representation.

We see an example of the bewildering places this new-found control

over the virtual may be taking us in Wim Wender's 1991 film *Until the*

*End of the World*. In this story, a new technology is developed that allows people to watch their own dreams. As the main characters experiment with it, we witness them being overtaken by a rapacious

hunger to re-play, again and again, their dream videos. In the end, we

find them glued to their screens, totally bewitched, voyeurs to the inner

workings of their psychic lives, an apt image, if ever there was one, of a

modern-day Platonic cave. Early Hikikimories of the 20th century.

Wender's film can be read as a prognosis for the increasing fervor we

find in the digital era to procure some kind of objective analysis of what goes on inside ourselves, some way of reading the surface to unlock its hidden depths. Of [course, Foucault (1973),](#index_split_007.html_p296) in the *Birth of the* *Clinic*, already identifies this trend to probe beneath empirical perception, as he explores the epistemic changes that occurred in the 18th century when physicians first dissected the human body. They

cut it open in order to make visible what was always hidden to the human eye beneath the surface, what could only, up to that moment,

be inferred. In our era, technology not only makes the body ever more

transparent, allowing us to send exploratory micro-cameras along the

most recondite corners of the organism, but now also seems to pro-

mise overcoming the problem of the inscrutability of the human

psyche, of desire, of who we "really" are emotionally inside ourselves

as opposed to what we present to the world.

The psyche, however, in contrast to the digital self, is fundamentally indeterminate. It can never be entirely known, or made fully transparent. As we have seen, there is an un-representable core to the

self that is active and alive within us, even if ungraspable. We can never truly know ourselves, and in turn, for the same reason, the

[]{#index_split_006.html_p290} *The tragedy of the virtual* 271

people we are most deeply attached to will also always remain, at some core level, a mystery.

No matter which way you slice it, the self-other continuum is encompassed by not-knowing, unpredictability and ex-centricity which

stirs up a terrible anxiety that is baseline for us as humans. In its remarkable ability to bring out of concealment that which resists appearing, digital technology is a balm. We might be seeking a

technological solution to what is not only a psychic condition, but an

ontological one. The obdurate unknowability of the self and the other,

the indeterminacy of human existence, and the unbearable uncertainty

about all things is endemic to being alive. Indeed, [as Žižek (2012)](#index_split_007.html_p297) puts it, one cannot look "objectively" at oneself and locate oneself in

reality; and the task is to think this impossibility itself as an ontological fact, not only as an epistemological limitation. In

other words, the task is not to think this impossibility as a limit,

but as a positive fact. (p. 239)

[***b Digital aura***](#index_split_000.html_p13)

We seek not just technological mastery of the world outside but also

inside, of the self. As we do with nature, we compel the psyche to give

up its secrets. We monitor our sleep to know at what exact points in

the night we are dreaming or whether and how much we snore. We

use brain imaging technology to have represented to us on a screen

what is happening in the dreaming mind. If we do our research right,

we can strip away the many masks of other selves, knowing in advance of meeting them, any troubling or dark life-events that may be

lurking in their background. Our innermost affective states, and these

self-same states in the other, can now be eerily detected and revealed.

In an op-ed for the *New York Times*, David [Brooks (2019)](#index_split_007.html_p296) writes, for example, about the use of A.I. technology to diagnose and predict depression. "\[A\]fter listening to millions of conversations, machines

can pick out depressed people based on their speaking and visual

patterns." (p. A23). Not only can depression be detected, but suicidal

thoughts as well:

In his book "Deep Medicine," which is about how A.I. is changing

medicine across all fields, Eric Topol describes a study in which a

learning algorithm was given medical records to predict who was

likely to attempt suicide. It accurately predicted attempts nearly

80 percent of the time. By incorporating data of real-world

interaction such as laughter and anger, an algorithm in a similar

study was able to reach 93 percent accuracy. (p. A23)

[]{#index_split_006.html_p291}272 *Philosophical issues of the virtual*

The machine picks up clues about a depressed person that we, as fa-

mily or friends or clinicians, with our ordinary powers of empathy and perception, are unable to detect. It reads us better than we can read ourselves. It sees through our masks. No Winnicottian false self,

no Jungian persona, no Freudian ego, is safe. Now we can even be told, similar to how a swab of the tongue can reveal our ancestral DNA, what set of feelings are lodged deep in the core of ourselves.

Better than a lie detector, the digital is becoming an affect and desire

detector, offering ever-new readings to the self. Furthermore, as we make our way into the public domain, we are constantly being

scanned; with the vast and rapid improvements of facial recognition

technology, there is no hiding, cameras everywhere and in every-

thing.

We need only reflect upon the fact that before a child is 2 years old,

typically, it will have been already photographed and videotaped by

ultrasound equipment even before birth, and its every move and ex-

perience will continue to be registered for many purposes. As Marcel

[O'Gorman (2015)](#index_split_007.html_p297) writes:

\[M\]y children live in a culture where their recorded images

circulated in the world before they did, will be disseminated in

multiple locations and contexts while they are alive, and will

remain in databases and media archives long after they die. They

might store their digital assets on a commercially run server to be

opened by their survivors after their death, and as morbid as the

thought may be, their own children may create eternal video

monuments to play at their funerals and store them for replay on

whatever social media outlet is most popular at the time. (p. 10)

All of this behavior that empowers us to define the undefinable,

see the unseeable is endemic to the representational impulse that

courses through the digital and generates a collective omniscience

[(Lévy, 1997),](#index_split_007.html_p297) a stunning kind of intelligence that can see and know everything there is to be seen and known. But the artificiality of such an intelligence -- the fact that all it can see, discern,

detect is of a representational character -- does away with a di-

mension of human experience that should not be forgotten. Since

the agenda is precisely to maintain things under control, tightly

scaffolded within this representational enframing, human creative

engagement with the world is covered over, disavowed and ulti-

mately obliterated. Thus this omniscience, for the sake of a false

comfort, does away with any opaqueness, shrouding existence's

natural (as opposed to artificial) virtuality, making us less and less

able to recognize its aura, and to perceive the existential density

of reality.

[]{#index_split_006.html_p292} *The tragedy of the virtual* 273

This shines a new light on a core difference between human vir-

tuality and virtual reality. If indeed, the unknowable and the non-

representable are the very source of the human virtual, and such a

force is foreclosed in virtual reality, then it follows that virtual reality can only offer a simulation of human virtuality, a knock-off, as

it were. Digital life is enframed, held inside the limits of its own representation, or as [Scott (1996)](#index_split_007.html_p297) put it in his distinctive reading of Heidegger's *The Question Concerning Technology*, it takes place inside a "definitive, ordering center... \[that\] hold\[s\] things

in place according to silent demands for a certain manner of

presentation" (p. 69):

In a time of technology \[especially given digitality\] things are

given to appear and to have significance by their usefulness. They

are fitted to purposes based on our needs, plans, and interests \[...\]

Technology \[...\] names a manner of appearing in which things are

for the sake of something else. (p. 70)

We see this clearly now as every past media is funneled into the uni-

formity of digitization, the enframing of which homogenizes experi-

ence and makes us gradually incapable of discerning anything outside

that enframing. It numbs us to human expressiveness and vulner-

ability. For example, we become deaf to the warmth and timbre of the

human voice that is displaced by the ubiquity of loudspeakers in public

spaces as much as in the private reception of our smartphones, or in the

AI devices that talk to us throughout the day. In growing accustomed to

the voice of our interlocutors' Zoom images fragmenting, spacing out,

speeding up, and de-synchronizing from their gestures, we are gradu-

ally being desensitized to the uniqueness and physical integrity of the

personal. By the constantly running present moment of the digital, we

are distracted from the historical depth that the non-digital brings to us. Even though the digital expands the representational powers that were limited by the materiality of the previous media, it does away

with something of the opaqueness that gives actual experience its

profundity.

If we hearken back for a moment to Heidegger's description of the

technological world as a wish world, Jared [Russell (2020)](#index_split_007.html_p297) tells us that for the philosopher wishing "is about a kind of anticipation that refuses possibility: wishing wishes for something to be objectively

present-at-hand. \[...\] The wish-world is driven to actualize the real, fleeing the reality of the possible" (p. 108). He continues:

This world endlessly celebrates its ability to extract from itself an

actuality that it is driven to prioritize over its being as possibility.

This describes how the scientific spirit is betrayed in being reduced

[]{#index_split_006.html_p293}274 *Philosophical issues of the virtual*

to the production of quantifiable, calculable results, and in such a

way that not only encourages but that insists on statistical

thinking as the measure of understanding and knowledge.

(pp. 108--109)

In extracting from itself an actuality, we want to say, this mode of being loses the virtual as possibility. Just as in Benjamin, the art object loses its aura (the object's density) to mechanical reproduction, in the

age of digital imaging, the image, then, also seems to lose it.

But while it may be true that the digital image has lost the aura of

the material image, it is also true that it generates other modes or types of auras. By magnifying, accelerating, photoshopping, or subjecting it to any of the functions by which we are able to examine it,

we discover new depths that change and extend our horizons beyond

what we might have perceived without digitization. Why not think,

in the spirit of McLuhan that with its amputations, digital life also brings along its novel extensions? Perhaps it is by attending to the new emergences that we may gradually begin to carve out the space

within which to reconfigure our vision of what is to come.

[**Coda**](#index_split_000.html_p13)

We have attempted to articulate a psychology and philosophy that

acknowledge modes of virtuality that transcend digital life, such as those found in the inner reaches of the psyche, in the mind, in the

aura of the object and in the immanence of the world. Perhaps it is

inevitable that this new extension of our virtual life cast a shadow that

paradoxically narrows our access to modulations of the real that stand

outside the digital. After all, this would not be something new for, as

we know, with each new technological addition there is always a

corresponding subtraction.

But in prizing the human virtual against the artificiality of the di-

gital, we fall into the authentic/inauthentic trap we have tried so as-

siduously to deconstruct. The digital gives us unparalleled access to a

mode of emergence unseen with any preceding technology. But, the

seduction of unending potentials offered by it makes us forget the acute sense of loss we feel with its encroachment upon the magical incantation of that existential interface of mind, imagination and

embodiment that is the human virtual, and takes us to the other side,

where it is digital virtuality that now becomes the "real" magic.

If indeed our technologies help us overcome the passing away of

things by giving us access to an infinite realm of emergence, then it is

impossible not to be haunted by what it must at the same time always

foreclose. The effort to not polarize is thus continuously thwarted, for

each new modulation makes us recoil from what seems to threaten

[]{#index_split_006.html_p294} *The tragedy of the virtual* 275

reality. In its foreclosures, changes and movement, something is always left behind to mourn. Ghosts are with us from the moment we

modulate the virtual; every technology builds upon the hallowed

grounds of the immanent virtual.

Nowadays, perhaps because of our unprecedented experiences with

virtual space, it becomes easier to assume there is no loss either when

leaving the empirical to enter the digital, or when forced to exit digital

life and come back to non-hyper realized ordinary reality. Because they seem to have become interchangeable and we can inhabit both

places at once without any tension, we see only differences when

moving from the digital to the empirical. Paradoxically, however, the

virtual -- the very thing we want to hold on to -- can be degraded in

both worlds. Too much time spent in our virtual screens can numb us

to the vitality of the physical world making it feel empty, spent, te-

dious, not exciting enough, not playful or inventive enough. But,

conversely too, the vitality of the digital can also be stolen because of

its own over-exposure.

One would think TikTok knows this, when it warns its users to "go

outside" for a while before coming back, when they have spent too

much time on it, insuring that way that they indeed will return! Play

video-games all day, stay glued to the screen wherever you move --

mindlessly walking through crowds in the streets, oblivious to your surroundings, compulsively checking and updating your feeds, absent

to the world of physical things -- and the digital itself, that area of inventive freedom and spontaneity, dries up.

And then there's the digital at night. Experiments have shown that

the blue light from digital surfaces suppresses the hormone mela-

tonin, which promotes sleep, so blocking our access to the bounties of

bodily rest, replacing them instead with the pixel-flickering infinite light offering. Physical exposure to virtual screens has an Endymionic

effect. Just as Endymion, the mythological ephebe, as we know,

swapped mortal vigil for immortal sleep so that he could permanently

satisfy his desire for the Moon goddess, we also end up in a sort of trance where, stripped of the refuge of sleep, we are rendered numb

and creatively impotent. A knot is tied that stunts the natural course

of the vital flow and hence of human virtuality itself. Instead of en-

livening, that intensity and continuous use deflates or buries us under

the plaque of habit, luring us -- in its eternal promise for something

always better -- to the particular unending quest for the impossible object that constitutes the dynamics of digital-addiction.

Transcending the constraints both of the body and its temporality,

the human virtual constitutes the experience of a dimension of life beyond empirical existence, where we "rise above," as it were, our material nature. A hybrid "of the natural and the supernatural" is how

[Ortega y Gasset (1968)](#index_split_007.html_p297) characterized this duality in our human

[]{#index_split_006.html_p295}276 *Philosophical issues of the virtual*

condition. We want to say instead, a hybrid of the actual and the virtual. The virtual is the human mind churning bits of empirical reality and experience through the mill of the imagination, engendering the unending fantasies that crowd and illuminate our

perception always, whether in vigil or sleep. Memory rides tandem

with these images to conjure virtual life and -- like Dyonisus' wine is

said to have been invented to make humans forget their suffering

mortality -- it brings us peace in the midst of the ephemeral world and

impending death.

What would human life be if memory didn't hold what has already

passed and imagination what is to come? How could we bear human

existence if not? Cut off from the virtual, human experience would be

deadened, and the vibrancy, spark and vitality of the world gone. We

saw this with trauma, where, premature exposure to the virtual

overwhelms the psyche and renders it fragile and impotent to build

the inner structures that would contain it. The power of the virtual is

thus reduced, and as memory and fantasy lose their vivifying influence, imagination itself becomes dangerous, and the passing away of

things unbearable.

Maintaining a connection to that which enlivens experience, as we

have seen with Winnicott, is a life-long task that is tied to learning to

bear our mortality. What animates the virtual, as it moves through mind and world, is its openness to contingency, the fact that things

can spontaneously move in any direction, at any time. Cut yourself

[]{#index_split_007.html}

off from a relationship to the non-governable dimensions of experi-

ence that seeks to unravel what is fixed and stable in our thinking and

living, and the virtual petrifies. A life that is not attuned to them, and

so does not, in at least some of its dimensions, avow the reality of loss

and death, is a life inert and emptied of meaning.

The very life-blood of the virtual, what makes it flow, is this ultimately uncontainable, yet generative force at work in the psyche, in

the world. Jung (quoted in [Edinger, 1974),](#index_split_007.html_p296) in his own idiosyncratic use of the term, calls this vital energy, God. He writes:

To this day God is the name by which I designate all things which

cross my willful path violently and recklessly, all things which

upset my subjective views, plans and intentions and change the

course of my life for better or worse. (p. 101)

The pygmalionic, in its chronic propensity to freeze reality, to stop time, is nothing other than a response to the terror of this reckless and

violent, untameable flow that potentiates life through its destabilization. Insofar as it partakes or even originates as a response to that

terror, the digital can seem as if it were predicated on an unconscious

desire to rid the world of all its uncertainties. But the irony is that the

[]{#index_split_007.html_p296} *The tragedy of the virtual* 277

very impulse to codify the world, make it into a picture, enframe it, as

we saw with Heidegger, confronts us again with the fact that the very

source of the human virtual is the unrepresentable, in its radical flux;

that it has always been there, haunting our certainties with its

ghostlike insistence upon absence, lack and contingency. The virtual,

therefore, is underwritten by a torrent of vital energy that we must sediment but which itself is always de-sedimenting our reality. The danger is to fall into the stultifying expectation of a static, permanent

world and become enchained to it.

Deleuze gives voice to a mad, proliferating energy at work behind

experience, anticipating the utter intensity in which the virtual is actualized in the digital era. As our perception of things changes because of the prosthetics and other extensions of our bodies and minds

through which we now perceive them, the digital (re)introduces the

rhizomatic vantage point from which we can better understand the

paradoxical nature of the pharmakon.

[**time of the pandemic**](#index_split_000.html_p13)

Who would have thought that as we were on the brink of sending our

text to the publisher, the COVID-19 pandemic would strike, stunning

the world and awakening a new kind of collective consciousness. How

could we possibly ignore it, when, making human contact perilous, it

has abruptly thrust us further into the virtual world and intensified the transformation that was already underway in human life and was

the very object of our investigations?

Just before it began, physical space was still sharply distinguishable

from the virtual, or, rather, our physical life was separate from what

was at most a supplementary digital existence. But now, forced as we

are by the circumstances to be more fully submerged, a fusion of ac-

tual life and virtual life is taking place. Floridi's' "on-life" seems to have finally arrived. The pharmacological dimensions of this plunge,

however, could not go unmentioned on our watch.

What could be more disruptive to the comfort and diversions

achieved in our technological era than a pandemic? What could be

more threatening to the sweep of capitalism that has already infected

the planet, subjecting its well-being to the fluctuations of a volatile stock market and human greed, than the dramatic advent of this

plague? It has pushed us all into one single space, where we now hear

the same stories, are obsessed with the same issues, and afraid of the

same dangers. This pandemic has done the unimaginable, halting our

habitual civilized lives, suspending everything we took for granted, and infusing the everyday with a hallucinatory experience of global

proportions. In the numbing pre-COVID anticipations of a comfor-

table, predictable, and controllable digitized world, we had anesthe-

tized ourselves from the unpredictability and uncertainty of actual life. But this sudden jolt, this irruption of the virulent force of nature

has fractured the normality of civilized culture, awakening us to

the fact that we have been living in a bubble, tightly secured by the

technological enframing of the world.

As we finish writing this book, the pandemic rages on; new hotspots

keep emerging in different parts of the planet, second and even third

[]{#index_split_007.html_p299}280 *Postscript*

waves threaten, making the virtual world our inescapable refuge. We

are spending more time now communicating and interacting on

screen than in the physical presence of others. And as we seek shelter

from the virus, our digital devices thrust us into the open space of the digital virtual, and its infinite possibilities. Sociability, intimacy, and close contact are made even more possible now without the

need of bodily co-presence, or geographical proximity. In this new, unforeseen circumstance, we find ourselves suddenly and frantically

betrothed to the virtual world as our bodies become dispensable.

Paradoxically, as our social worlds are rapidly and profusely

expanding, we are increasingly isolated from one another. Those

fortunate enough to suddenly have time on their hands (and the

safe haven of their homes) initially responded to the confinement by

virtually reaching out, manically, to everyone they knew (and many they did not), breathlessly trying to recapture the life, past, present (and even future) that seemed to be rapidly slipping away. Virtual interaction became a safeguard from cultural mayhem and crisis.

Our central concern of the book, the virtual world, suddenly acquires

unprecedented urgency: what happens to us when simulated reality

becomes the order of the day and our social and emotional lives shift to

the virtual? And what does it mean, or what will it occasion, that our

primary contact with our closest friends, colleagues, family, and everyday human interaction is mediated through a two-dimensional flat

screen and digital algorithms? After hours and hours on chat and Zoom

and the Internet, this pandemic plunge into the virtual makes us feel an

increasing sense of disconnection from the outside world, other bodies,

animals, plants, natural and even artificial objects.

Synchronistically, we had already included in our last ruminations

E.M. [Forster's (2009)](#index_split_000.html_p37) story, *The Machine Stops*, written just over a century ago, with a prophetic imagination that conjured up a dystopian society eerily similar to ours today. Set in subterranean Earth, its

citizens are already spending their life shut inside a small cell, never

seeing one another in person, only telecommunicating through

what Forster describes as Zoom-like devices. They were all connected

through a powerful machine that -- by means of a console

complete with all the necessary controls -- supported daily life and made physical contact not only unnecessary but, in most cases, even

inconvenient or undesirable.

Forced by the coronavirus to spend most of our waking hours in-

habiting virtual space, one need not be too pessimistic or have too much imagination to realize that Forster's future may be very close already to our present. What's truly uncanny about this story is how

clearly it depicts the most negative aspects of the technological

pharmakon. A century before the birth of the World Wide Web ("the

Machine" of contemporary digital life), Forster anticipated some of

[]{#index_split_007.html_p300} *Postscript* 281

the most immediate and obvious perils of our present world. His

prophecy is the end of man, the end of nature, and our ultimate submission to the machine. *The Machine Stops* is as striking and tragic as a Cassandrian mirror, and it should give pause to any fantasy of technological liberation.

In this story, humanity has been overtaken by "the Machine,"

which provides all comforts and meets all needs, except the need for

human contact which it seems to have made increasingly un-

necessary. It tells the tale of Vashti and her son, Kuno, who live on

opposite sides of the world. It begins with Kuno beseeching his

mother to visit him in person, and her adamantly resisting the idea,

feeling that seeing each other every day on the screen is quite

plenty. She shuns any disruption of her comfortable life inside the

Machine, which provides for her every need and fulfills any desire

she may have at any time. She sees no need to leave her room,

whereas Kuno, by contrast, yearns for real contact and real experi-

ence. "I want to see you not through the Machine...," he pleads

with his mother, "I want to speak to you not through the wearisome

Machine" (p. 3).

Kuno's mournful words reverberate for us today, as it becomes ever

more clear that even if the virus subsides we can anticipate a future of

sustained social distancing and virtual contact. We are steadily becoming habituated to interacting with small thumbnails, which may

be rarefying our perception and ripping away the aura of things

transformed now into data and information. While good enough for

general communication, in these connections, the non-verbal aspects

of bodily interaction are attenuated in the reduced visages that we become to each other. Forster highlights the way in which the discernment of the other's state of mind through the subtle gestures intrinsic to physical encounters are blunted in the virtual image.

Vashti can only guess about her son's emotional state, as she tries to

read him through the mediation of the screen.

She fancied that he looked sad. She could not be sure, for the

Machine did not transmit nuances of expression. It only gave a

general idea of people -- an idea that was good enough for all

practical purposes.... (p. 5).

But despite this sudden reduction of social interaction to virtual contact, Vashti describes it as an enormous advance in human intercourse, for, as she says proudly, one can be connected to "several

thousand people" (p. 2). But in our situation, with so many people to

snapchat, tweet, or text, this supposed "advance" seems to be a loss

rather than a gain. So much time spent on virtual platforms is having

deleterious effects on our bodies and psyches. Being able to connect

[]{#index_split_007.html_p301}282 *Postscript*

virtually with friends, colleagues and family far away was once a great

luxury and privilege, but now it is fast becoming an oppressive necessity. Every time we are called back to the screen for yet another Zoom session, the space we enter begins to feel like solitary confinement. We experience an expansion of social connection, yet, behind

the screen, we remain (and ever more glaringly in this pandemic)

isolated and alone. It's better than nothing, we keep telling ourselves,

trying to keep our mounting distress under control and feeling indeed

overburdened and exhausted. What is there to do with such a glaring

and unbearable paradox?

It is truly amazing how Forster's description of life inside the

Machine foretells our digital life today, even its ability to soften the

rough edges of loneliness and melancholy, flooding us with its electric

blue light.

For a moment Vashti felt lonely. Then she generated the light, and

the sight of her room, flooded with radiance and studded with

electric buttons, revived her. There were buttons and switches

everywhere -- buttons to call for food, for music, for clothing.

There was the hot-bath button, by pressure of which a basin of

(imitation) marble rose out of the floor, filled to the brim with a

warm deodorized liquid. There was the cold-bath button. There

was the button that produced literature. And there were of course

the buttons by which she communicated with her friends. (p. 6)

In the virtual world, every desire is within immediate reach; in-

stantaneous wish fulfillment becomes the primary mode of digital action

and control. But in this way, we are facing the quickly approaching dystopic future of an "Amazoned" world, filled with smart speakers awaiting our every command, and made possible by a workforce of robots, drones, and low-wage workers monitored by digital surveillance.

What the pandemic is making painfully clear is how Machiavellian our

economic infrastructure has become, unceasingly stimulating us by

offering to deliver to our front porches with warp speed all our wishes

and fancies. "Though it contained nothing," writes Forster of Vashti's room, "it was in touch with all that she cared for in the world" (p. 6).

The digital offers us a world that although virtually plenty, is materially depleted. This is what Flusser is alluding to when he says, as we remember, that the digital renders the one-dimensional world of writing

to the digital's own zero dimensionality; though capable of fulfilling all

our desires, the virtual world is wholly devoid of dimension.

Charlie Brooker imagines that zero dimensionality of the digital

in another Black Mirror episode, "White Christmas." He describes

a future world where it becomes possible to digitally clone an

individual's consciousness, reducing it to "a cookie" which is

[]{#index_split_007.html_p302} *Postscript* 283

simply placed in a virtual limbo. When time bottoms out and space

is voided, the zero dimensionality of the digital becomes a petri dish of sadistic manipulation. The virtual clone becomes a slave

living in a kind of eternal hellscape where nothing ever happens,

and where her sole function is to attend to the menial tasks of life

demanded by her original.

Yet at the same time that the digital seems to be literally emptying

reality of all dimension, something else seems to be taking shape.

Universal connectedness becomes a new reality that is not only

empowering the individual but also forging a collective mind. This

has become poignantly clear in the events surrounding the brutal

death of George Floyd in 2020 at the hands of a police officer, which, captured by the smartphone of a 17-year-old high school

junior, went viral and set off a firestorm of protest and rage. Digital

virtuality has powerfully contributed to a sudden and universal

response -- unheard of in human history -- uncovering the pervasive

problem of police brutality in America and racial injustice all over

the world.

The digital has also made the experience and the struggle against the pandemic a global matter, where we have reacted together, as one

single, albeit fractured, world community. Everyone around the

planet is made privy to the same information (and misinformation);

we simultaneously learn the daily count of infections and deaths in

every country; we witness together the virus's ravaging of everyday communal life and its spread across the surface of the globe, and we

suffer as well the various attempts to contain it.

The interconnected globe has become, after all, already an exten-

sion of our minds, "a virtual world," as Pierre [Lévy (1997)](#index_split_000.html_p37) wrote just before the turn of the century, "which is at the same time a society of

animated signs, a shared organ of perception, cooperative memory,

and space for communication and navigation" (p. 112). He pointed

this out when the digital world was still in diapers, and he added that

we may "have the opportunity to collectively think through our

future and alter its course" (p. xxiv):

Faced with the choice of turning back or moving forward \[...\]

humanity has a chance to reclaim its future, not by placing its

destiny in the hands of some so-called intelligent mechanism, but

by systematically producing the tools that will enable it to shape

itself into intelligent communities capable of negotiating the

stormy seas of change.... even if we manage to achieve a condition

of personal immobility, the landscape will continue to flow and

tumble around us, infiltrate us, transform us from within. We are

no longer in historical time, with its references to writing, the city,

the past, but within a moving and paradoxical space that comes to

[]{#index_split_007.html_p303}284 *Postscript*

us from the future. ... Time is not now anymore a succession of

events ... Time now is errant, oblique, plural, indeterminate, like

that which precedes all origins. (p. xxv)

Lévy's description astoundingly corresponds to the transformation of

time during the pandemic. Days run into nights, as weeks and months

seem to pass without the rhythm and structure of familiar experience

that once anchored life to predictable routines. The temporality

marked by the virtual world has nearly overtaken the internal human

sense of time, transmuting it into something errant, plural, and indeterminate, impossible to keep track of. Something is coming at us fiercely, propelling us into the future, and we are struggling to hold on.

Forster's story offers a more dystopic vision of this future. In the last

remaining book in Vashti's world, she has the means to eradicate

unpredictability:

By her side, on the little reading-desk, was a survival from the ages

of litter -- one book. This was the Book of the Machine. In it were

instructions against every possible contingency. If she was hot or

cold or dyspeptic or at a loss for a word, she went to the book, and

it told her which button to press. The Central Committee

published it. In accordance with a growing habit, it was richly

bound. (p. 8)

In our pandemic times, where we have only limited access to experts

to help us deal with the small material breakdowns of everyday life,

we increasingly depend on the infinity of the Youtube archive for instruction. Analogous to rule 34: "if you can imagine it, there's porn

of it," we might add a rule 35: "if you run into a problem with any of

the many objects that surround you, there is a video for it."

If Lévy is correct, and there truly is a collective mind emerging, a

shared organ of perception, we can almost sense its haunting mani-

festations as Youtube mesmerizes us into thinking and feeling, over and over again, that perhaps there is really nothing unique about us

or any particularity in our life, that individuality may in fact be an illusion. Someone else, somewhere else, has run into the very same problem, and goes to the same source that prescribes the very same

actions to all. Just as Vashti's book, Youtube tells us precisely what button to press.

"The Machine" makes up for the losses of our confinement and the

imposition of social distancing, actualizing our desire with every pos-

sible material satisfaction and the luxury and comfort possible in our

technological age. We no longer need a singular book, a set of books, or

even a whole library, for today the Internet is our shield against con-

tingency. And if, as we have been claiming, contingency underwrites

[]{#index_split_007.html_p304} *Postscript* 285

the human virtual, then the attempt to digitize the physical world, and

thus make everything controllable, is tantamount to its repression.

For Stiegler, moreover, because of our increasing dependence on the

Machine, there is nowadays, in advanced contemporary capitalism, a

growing numbing or "proletarization" of the individual. The digital network has become a black box that hides from all but the specialists

what goes on inside it, or how its algorithms work. The common man

is clueless about how things that happen happen. He slowly sinks into

stupidity.

We have witnessed in the advent of the digital a sort of Copernican

Revolution, like the one Kant claimed he had effected with his phi-

losophy. Kant had said that we could not possibly hope to have cer-

tain knowledge of the world if the subject had to conform to the object, for there was always uncertainty in our encounter with things

when it was on their own terms, with the many opacities inherent to

matter that makes certain knowledge impossible. But if we conceived

of knowledge not as the result of our minds conforming to the world,

but rather of the world, of things, conforming to our minds, then just

an introspective look would suffice for us to discover the mental structures that render knowledge certain. [1](#index_split_007.html_p305)

Forster seems to be echoing Kant when Vashti claims that the civili-

zation before her had "mistaken the functions of the system, and had

used it for bringing people to things, instead of for bringing things to

people" (p. 9). We can now see that the Internet of Things indeed brings

the whole world to us so that we don't need anymore to reach out to it.

This is of course something invaluable for us now, as we can find refuge

from the viral infection in the safe areas of a virtualized world. But in so effortlessly replacing reality with its nearly perfect simulation -- the experience of cycling through the French countryside, for instance, with

the Peloton bike that brings that experience into our living room -- we

may be seduced by the comfort and clarity of the VR screen so that we

begin to value better the constructed world rather than the natural, and

eventually not even notice the difference. So satisfied are we with its virtual replacement that we could, as Vashti did, start to wonder about

"those funny old days, when men went for change of air instead of changing the air in their rooms!" (p. 9):

Few travelled in these days, for, thanks to the advance of science,

the earth was exactly alike all over. Rapid intercourse, from which

the previous civilization had hoped so much, had ended by

defeating itself. What was the good of going to Peking when it

was just like Shrewsbury? Why return to Shrewsbury when it

would all be like Peking? Men seldom moved their bodies; all

unrest was concentrated in the soul. (p. 11)

[]{#index_split_007.html_p305}286 *Postscript*

The Tragedy of the Virtual in a Pandemic Age is summed up very well

at the end of the story by Kuno's admonitory words:

Cannot you see \[...\] that it is we that are dying, and that down here the only thing that really lives is the Machine? We created

the Machine to do our will, but we cannot make it do our will

now. It has robbed us of the sense of space and of the sense of touch, it has blurred every human relation and narrowed down

love to a carnal act, it has paralysed our bodies and our wills, and

now it compels us to worship it. The Machine develops -- but not

on our lines. The Machine proceeds -- but not to our goal. We only

exist as the blood corpuscles that course through its arteries, and if

it could work without us, it would let us die. (p. 26)

Oliver [Sacks (2019),](#index_split_000.html_p37) at the end of his life, also saw this story as a prophetic fable for our own world, in which our digital devices have

made us lose an important part of who we are and how we behave with one another. As he lamented, "This is how I feel increasingly often about our bewitched, besotted society, too."

The great loss in Kant's Copernican turn was that the world as it is in

itself becomes unreachable outside the structures imposed on it by the

mind. The Romantics argued that what had been sacrificed for the sake

of certainty was what was most important to human being, which

happens to always lie beyond the confines of intellectual or re-

presentational understanding. Are we too, in bringing the world closer to

us by digitization, not also losing what is most valuable in human life? In so rapidly replacing a world that required a body to enter it with the disembodied world of the screen, aren't we in danger of disregarding the

imponderable aspects of physical existence that are irreducible to any representation? Or are we not also gaining something that we may be yet

unable to discern in the rarified experience of the virtual screen?

**Note**

[1](#index_split_007.html_p304) Of course we are over-simplifying here. That introspective look is a complex rational task of what Kant calls "a transcendental deduction", where we uncover the necessary conditions for the possibility of our knowledge of things.
