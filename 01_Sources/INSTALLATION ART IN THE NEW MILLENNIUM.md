In it smell becomes a physical object.Here, the skip held pine essence and its scent acted as a memory aid, though pine soap is generally used as a cleaning agent and for evacuating noxious odours. The liquid was bound by its solid container,but its odour evaded such fixed parameters and pervaded the entire space.Memory Skip was partnered by an audio work entitled TheSound of Smell, recorded in a sound studio and consisting of the mechanical grinding and manual chopping of pine needles. This lasted the length of time as it took for the sealed room to be filled with scent.

# introduction 12  

Over the past decade the position of Installation art has shifted from a relatively marginal practice to achieving mainstream status within contemporary visual culture. Its hegemonic presence has given rise to new terms which redefine the art form and impact on a range of other disciplines.  

Artists and works that mark this shift include: Ann Hamilton (UsA), Stan Douglas (Canada), Stefan Bruggemann (Mexico), Steven Pippin (UK), Barbara Kruger (UsA), Hans Op de Beek (Belgium), Rodney Graham (Canada), Michael Landy (UK), Tomoko Takahashi (Japan), llya Kabakov (Russia), Chris Burden (USA) and FrancescTorres(Spain).  

# escape 49  

The new ‘immersive' Installation reflects desire for sensual pleasure. It provides a 'total artwork' which envelops the viewer in a hermetic and narcissistic space. The location of the installation is in the realm of the imaginary, stimulated by theneedfor escape.  

Artists featured include Doug Aitken (UsA), Per Barclay (Norway), Olafur Eliasson (Denmark), Bruce Gilchrist and Jo Joelson (UK), Ann Veronica Janssens (UK/Belgium), Kazuo Katase (Japan), Jaume Plensa (Spain), Ugo Rondinone (Switzerland), Borre Saethre (Norway), Andrea Zittel (USA), Lee Bul (Korea) and Pierre Huyghe(France).

While artists desire autonomy, their installations often require collaborators in the form of museums and curators. The resulting relationships provide a platform for discussion and collaboration. The outcome of this process is the project: Installation as an open-ended experiment which transforms the art institution into a cultural laboratory.  

Artists in this section include: Barbara Bloom (UsA), Martin Creed (Uk), Henrik Plenge Jakobsen (Denmark), Mischa Kuball (Germany), Micah Lexier (Canada), John Newling (UK), Tobias Rehberger (Germany), Navin Rawanchaikul (Thailand), Elmgreen & Dragset (Denmark/Norway) and Thomas Hirschhorn (Switzerland).  

# exchange and interaction 106  

Installation has been defined by its refusal to accept fixed boundaries. Its experimental edge has led artists to examine the boundaries of other disciplines. Practitioners are looking to forge relationships of exchange with other artists on a global level, through the ability of fast travel, information technology and the media. In addition, Installation artists have found opportunities to collaborate with specialists in areas such as anthropology, science and technology, opening the field to experimental strategies beyond the traditionally visual. Installation is thus seen as moving beyond the physical boundary of a single space into a realm of negotiated interactivity and simultaneity.  

Artists are drawn from a broad spectrum of Installation practice and include: Atelier van Lieshout (Netherlands), Jose Davila (Mexico), Alicia Framis (Spain), Carsten Holler (Belgium), the duo Muntean/Rosenblum (Austria/lsrael), Carsten Nicolai (Germany), the Scandinavian group N55, Paola Pivi (Italy), Mark Povell (UK), Allan Wexler (USA) and Keith Tyson (UK).  

# time and narrative 132  

In a rapidly changing world, time and memory are key concerns for contemporary artists.Though borrowing from existing methodologies, Installation artists prefer to construct their own spaces of memory. The singular term ‘history' is under constant threat from the emergence of multiple ‘histories'. Artists have used this concern with remembrance by focusing on official and unofficial means of retrieval in an attempt to question existing systems through more private and individualways.  

Examples are drawn from the works of: Christian Boltanski (France), David Bunn (USA),Damien Hirst (UK), Tadashi Kawamata (Japan), the French duo Loriot/Melia,Mike Nelson (UK),Jason Rhoades (USA),Bob & Roberta Smith (UK), Jane and Louise Wilson (UK), Eija-Liisa Ahtila (Finland) and Joao Penalva (Portugal).  

# the body of the audience 166  

Following an examination of the conditions of contemporary viewing,it is argued that the audience has become the key site of the Installation. This chapter concludes that Installation returns us to the body of the spectator,a space that is sentient and active: The Empire of the Senses.  

Artists include: Vanessa Beecroft (ltaly), Carlos Amorales (Mexico), Thomas Eller (Germany), Gary Hill (USA), Christian Jankowski (Germany),Aernout Mik (Netherlands), Santiago Sierra (Spain), Roman Signer (Switzerland), Christine Hill (USA), Mariko Mori (Japan) and Sylvie Fleury (Switzerland).

# foreword by Jonathan Crary  

For the last several centuries, the most compelling forms of Western visual art were often works by artists who critically engaged with the experience of human perception, who tested its limits and expanded its possibilities. The Scientific Revolution accelerated the search for workable explanations for understanding the interplay of vision and appearance, and the empirical study of perception became a recurring part of the modernization of European thought. With the models of artist-researchers like Leonardo and Brunelleschi available, innovative art has frequently taken shape within an awareness of the double-sidedness of perceptual experience: that it is formed both through external techniques and practices and through the subjective capabilities of the observer's own body and nervous system. For many centuries, representational techniques like perspective and printing exemplified the standardization as well as the replication, storage and circulation of perceptual experience, while devices such as the telescope or microscope functioned as prosthetic amplifications and extensions of human sensory capabilities.  

Up until the mid-1800s the artist operated within conditions of relative equilibrium between the imperatives of external rules and techniques (e.g. academic codes and studio practices, optical instruments like the Claude Glass, and perspectival systems) on one hand and the autonomy of subjective visual experience on the other. But beginning in the late 19th century, intensified technological development triggered the erosion of this reciprocity between individual experience and exterior processes and instruments. The last 125 years have seen a dramatic transfer of human capabilities to machines, especially capabilities involving vision, thought and memory which continues unabated today, in terms of tools for information storage, communication and visualization. We are now in a material environment where earlier 20th-century models of spectatorship, contemplation and experience are inadequate for understanding the conditions of cultural creation and reception. If the diverse artists featured in this volume have anything in common, it is a recognition of this shift and a realization that art must reconfigure itself in relation to transformed modes of cognition and experience. Their work is linked, directly and indirectly, with the activity and imagination of new groups, subjectivities and communities in a conflictridden global environment. Taking place in both art and in diverse cultural arenas are experiments with perceptual and cognitive experiences outside of the dominant possibilities offered by contemporary media and technology. Some of this experimental activity involves the creation of unanticipated spaces and environments in which our visual and intellectual habits are challenged or disrupted. The processes through which sensory information is consumed become the object of various strategies of de-familiarization.  

The continuing proliferation of techniques of perception and information is tied to one of the crucial paradoxes of global present: the greater the technological capacity for connection, speed, for exchange and circulation of information, the more fragmented and compartmentalized the world becomes. Much of our intellectual heritage from the Enlightenment supported the opposite belief: that universal access to knowledge and communication tools ought to have been the basis for conditions of freedom and participatory democracy for example. For those working in the visual arts and new media, there is a particular awareness that the current spread of communication networks is not generating a trans-national community with a shared set of aesthetic and perceptual foundations. lnstead, there has been the spread of relatively self-sufficient micro-worlds of affect, meaning and experience, between which intelligible exchange is less and lesspossible.  

The unfathomable amount of information available today works powerfully against the possibility or even the ideal of shared knowledge. Instead, electronically accessible data can be used in the service of any point of view, regardless of how extreme or absurd. But it is within this generalized epistemological crisis that some of our most important contemporary artists, grouped here under the term 'Installation art', are rethinking the nature of research, challenging hegemonic uses of media and testing out new ways of assembling and presenting information. We encounter here strategies of materializing knowledge through concrete procedures of bricolage, as well as unexpected awakenings of communal memory within a culture dependent on historical amnesia. This is a far cry from the appropriation art of the 1980s when it was fashionable to present virtuoso demonstrations of endless chains of simulation, of the cynical play of signs and images that supposedly no longer referred to anything.  

As the authors of this volume recognize, the appellation 'Installation art' is a paradoxical one in that it too can imply a sense of position and a spatial homogeneity which is alien to most of the examples of work represented here. For, in fact, Installation art directly engages the patchwork, composite character of contemporary experience and it does so with a stunning diversity of materials and practices. In a related sense, 'Globalization' is also a misleading  

term in that it seems to connote spatiality or territory, albeit on a large scale. But as we well know, the workings of capitalism now are increasingly independent of actual territory. There is more and more disconnection of economic circulation from physical space, as abstract forms of wealth have a mobility and fluidity unrelated to what we used to think of as location. This should not lead us to hyperbolic theories about the disappearance of space or the ubiquity of instantaneous speed and so on. We must begin to understand the strange kind of dislocations and associations that now constitute subjective reality. Unavoidably, our lives are divided between two essentially incompatible milieus; on one hand, the spaceless electronic worlds of contemporary technological culture and, on the other, the physical extensive terrain on which our bodies are situated. Much Installation art affirms that experience (and art) is constituted out of the paradoxes and discontinuities of this mixed heterogeneous zone.  

Many of the Installation artists seem to be working with the awareness of how the tangible 'real' world can seem dilapidated in comparison with the infinite phantasmagoria of images and data available on-line or on-screen. The potential decrepitude of our physical surroundings and all the cosmetic, genetic imperfections (not to mention the mortality) of our own bodies are a permanent humiliation in the face of dematerialized digital phenomena. It is of course entirely logical now  

that immense corporate industries are relentlessly trading upon the fragility of the body to expand a central arena of consumption: bio-engineering, cosmetic surgery. psycho-chemicals ever more available for diverse emotional and behavioural needs le.g. an anti-shyness drug now being marketed), anti-aging procedures, and the patenting and commercialization of the human genome, to name a few. But these are some of the issues out of which artists are generating counter-models of the body and its dynamics, which disclose its political volatility and which might work against its fraudulent domestication.  

The cultural changes now underway, however, are not analogous to previous historical transformations. The rise of typographic culture did not suddenly occur after the 15th-century invention of the printing press and moveable type. It took place slowly over several centuries and its effects were not fully in place until the late 18th or early 19th centuries in terms of an extensive diffusion across a social field. Perhaps most significantly though, we are not witnessing so much a change in technological conceptions from one dominant arrangement of machinic systems to another, as the emergence of an unprecedented dynamic of continual innovation and obsolescence. It is not as if we are in a transitional period of adjustment to a new set of tools which will all seem quite mundane in another generation, like the telephone or radio. For the vast majority of people, our perceptual and cognitive relationship to communication and information technology is and will continue to be estranged, because the speed at which new products appear and reconfigurations of technological systems take place precludes the possibility of ever becoming familiar with a given arrangement. What we habitually refer to as photography, film, video, television no longer has a stable identity and is now subject to increasingly frequent mutations as part of larger technological transformations. Whatever is currently touted as essential to our practical needs is always disquietingly close to obsolescence. Perception itself is so closely aligned with these rhythms of change that one of its primary characteristics is  

continual permutation. In this context, aesthetic debates dependent on the notion of ‘medium' are out of touch with contemporary actuality. Much of the work documented here consists of provisional counter-strategies of integrating technological tools into plural zones of creative activity, and of inventing flexible models of imagination and narrative outside of the enforced routines of cultural consumption. It establishes a perceptual field which simultaneously engages periphery and centre, continually revealing multiple routes of entry and exit. Perhaps most importantly, the work is often frankly utopian in its ambitions: it provides a rough outline of alternate forms of living, creating and thinking which might become hopeful anticipations of a highly variegated but more egalitarian global future.

Tomoko Takahashi, Line 0ut, 1999 Referring to an unprejudiced exploration of selection and classification, a cheerful celebration of human organizing tendencies, Takahashi focuses on the retrieval and redeployment of materials in order to integrate the detritus of consumer society into an artistic practice. She creates chaotic tableaux of redundant equipment which can be interpreted as fantasies of neurotic, urban landscapes.

# introduction  

In February 2001 the British artist Michael Landy re-opened the disused C&A department store in London's Oxford Street. Over a period of two weeks all his belongings were publicly destroyed for his installation Break Down. In the catalogue of the show Landy provided an inventory of his posessions: 'Artworks, Clothing, Electrical, Furniture, Kitchen, Leisure, Motor Vehicle, Perishable, Reading Material, Studio Materials'. He described the work thus: Break Down is a bit like a Scalectrix version of a material reclamation facility with all my possessions circulating on a roller conveyor until they are taken apart. I'm building an audit of my life. Objects that have been classified into different categories...are numbered, weighed and detailed on an inventory.... The conveyor is like a plinth in a way, it-er-conveys what's going on.

Break Down provides a useful departure point for reconsidering the nature and form of the artwork at the beginning of the 21st century as it raises important questions about the current position of the artist, material culture, exhibition practices and the role of the audience in Installation art. This book aims to present the diverse practices that have today come to redefine the term Installation art.  

The final decade of the 2oth century saw the passage of Installation art from a relatively marginal art practice to the establishment of its current central role in contemporary art. 'These days installation art seems to be everybody's favourite medium,' wrote the influential American critic Roberta Smith in 1993. She was also critical, stating that ‘installation has become a series of conventions' (Smith uses the terms ‘installation' and ‘installation art' interchangeably). However, as we shall see, in the intervening years Installation has moved from what the American art theorist Hal Foster describes as medium specific' to 'debate specific', a form of art that is not defined in terms of any traditional medium but in terms of the message it conveys by whatevermeans.  

llya Kabakov, The Palace of Projects, [detail),1998  

![images/e0d762115ad53687e3f5252c2fb5c0b6b3cbb078aca2c5365cc68010f3d28930.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/aJyP9my.jpeg)  

Earlier attempts to define Installation art by medium alone failed because it is in the nature of the practice itself to challenge its own boundaries. This questioning process constitutes a discourse which investigates the relationships between the artist and the audience. Installation is therefore defined by this process, something that has led artists to work with materiats and methodologies not traditionally associated with the visual arts. Roberta Smith's assertion that Installation was governed by conventions has been challenged since the publication of her article. Current practice suggests that a more fluid and open approach has taken over from the conventions that attempted to bind Installation art to the medium. This idea of fluidity was already being discussed in relation to Postmodern practice in the 1980s. Moreover, it is in the current period that these earlier theories have become fully integrated into art practice. As the French philosopher Jean Baudrillard noted: 'The medium is no longer identifiable as such, and the confusion of the medium and the message [McLuhan] is the first great formula of this new era.' The Canadian theorist Marshall McLuhan was one of the key theorists writing in the early 1960s to address the impact that information technology would have on global culture. This formula predicts the shift from objective critique towards a new subjectivity which emphasizes uncertainty and brings both artist and viewer together in a discursive environment.  

The practice of the Russian artist llya Kabakov has been emblematic of this move from objective knowledge to subjective experience. His Palace of Projects (1998) presented a vast range of proposals from the  

![images/85ff13b5ce70f554d247e0f124ca094e1eea210b06361e49f6237619205f1d4a.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/2QVuRza.jpeg)  

Russian people, which were then turned into maquettes and drawings. These proposals were the flights of fancy of ordinary people faced with the breakdown of ideological certainties in the wake of the collapse of the Soviet Union. Kabakov goes so far as to state that Installation will take the place of 'the icon, the fresco, and the painting'. He affirms that Installation 'is not a movement in art, not a new or fashionable style? but rather 'a new genre which is still in the very beginning of its development.' Kabakov sees Installation as a genre entirely directed towards the viewer, though the audience's reaction is anticipated by the artist. In generating the work, the artist instills a sense of familiarity in the viewer, directing them to their own everyday experience. Moreover, the demystification of art's content in Kabakov's work is a concern shared by manyartists.  

While referring to the content of Installation art, Rochelle Steiner, curator of the Saint Louis Art Museum, writes that \*museological critique, world and identity politics, and the position of the viewers tend to be preconditions rather than battlegrounds.' These terms, suggested by Steiner, are no longer the subject of installations but constitute a  

Francis Alys, When Faith Moves Mountains,2002  

The Belgian artist Francis Alys' work crosses over between performance, painting, photography and web projects. 0n 11 April 2002, five hundred volunteers were given shovels and asked to form a single line at the foot of a giant sand dune in Ventanilla, an area outside Lima, Peru. This human comb pushed a quantity of sand a specific distance, thereby moving a 16-foot-long $(4.8m)$ sand dune roughly 4 inches $110(m)$ from its original position. The piece functions as a social allegory, infiltrating local history and mythology with the aim of de-romanticizing Land Art.

right Renee Green, Between and Including,1999  

opposite left Meschac Gaba,Museum Shop,2001 The Benin artist Meschac Gaba diagnoses how art history and the museum culturally, ethnocentrically and selectively assimilate nonEuropean cultures. The piece Project for the Museum of African Contemporary Art was made in Amsterdam in 1997 at the Rijksakademie. This museum, organized in twelve different departments or installations (Museum Shop, Museum Restaurant, Museum Discotheque, etc.], was reconstructed and temporarily staged for exhibitions. Gaba playfully confronts his work with the defined mechanisms of business and the rules of the global contemporary art market.  

common ground between artist and audience upon which the work is based. Installation is therefore not specifically charged with addressing the issues mentioned by Steiner, as artists and viewers already understand these concerns as given. In the many contemporary installations that recognize the reality of an information culture the issues are implicit.  

Many artists appear to give credence to Steiner's argument; as the issues are implicit in the work, they can remove the need to remind the audience of their presence. The American artist Renee Green constructs video-lounges and libraries which act as information centres in which the viewer becomes a 'browser' who picks from the available material. Similarly, Meschac Gaba from Benin provided a reading area and a shop entitled Museum Shop (2001), which invited visitors to browse through books and magazines. Both these artists' installations propose informal settings which encourage spectators to relax and enjoy the work without being pressurized by overt messages or ideological stances. The perceived absence of apparent control mechanisms or the lack of

an explicit message in these works suggests an understanding shared between the artist and the audience. The audience is encouraged to choose its own interpretation without relying on that of the artist. Artists and curators are indeed motivating spectators to experience works in an open-ended manner and become authors and generators of their own meanings.  

The relationship between the artist and the audience is closely linked to the continuing debate around 'theatrical space'. If the gallery or site is likened to a stage, the question then arises of how and why the viewer participates in the work. The American curator Robert Storr's exhibition Dislocations' at the Museum of Modern Art in New York in 1992 helped to pave the way for the recognition of Installation art as a mainstream discipline. His article 'No Stage, No Actors, But It's Theatre (and Art), published in 1999, observed that installations have become 'complete immersion environments'. Refering to installations by artists such as llya Kabakov and Ann Hamilton, he asserts that 'the experience they provide is much like wandering onstage and picking up loose pages from a script,  

above right Bik Fillingham Van der Pol, The Bookshop Piece, 1996 This was a recreation of the theory section of the ICA Bookshop in London at the Museum Boijmans van Beuningen, Rotterdam. One of the characteristics of the ICA Bookshop is that the main stock consists of theory-related literature, including sociological, cultural, historical and philosophical works. The Dutch artists Liesbeth Bik, Peter Fillingham and Jos van der Pol, who work collaboratively under the name Bik Fillingham Van der Pol, wanted to create a link between the different collections, which operate in discrete areas such as modern art, classical art, prints and design. The reconstruction of the ICA Bookshop was based with the original architect's plans and included all titles on a sale-or-return basis.  

right Barbara Kruger, Power Pleasure Desire Disgust,1997   
The American artist Barbara Kruger no longer attacks the public's attitudes towards advertising and mass   
propaganda but their zones of intimacy which create claustrophobic spaces. Her signature texts and aphorisms are projected all over the gallery's surface, while on the rear wall, three large-scale video projections of changing heads   
voice her confrontational texts, based on snatches of dialogue overheard by the artist.  

![images/927a75601720860067c7d04a7723bdbfa369e896f461d46968110d2605fdc743.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/oUtALN1.jpeg)  

overhearing bits of recorded dialogue and trying to figure out what the setting is...and what actions might still be taken.' He implies that the proscenium arch has been removed and that the division between actors and audience is no longer clear. The removal of the frame that separates stage from auditorium brings together the spheres of making and viewing. The ‘theatricality' of the work, once seen as a weakness because of the reliance on entertaining the audience, has become a virtue. Rochelle Steiner goes so far as to state that 'theatricality paradoxically outlined the conditions that would come to define installation art.'  

Yet, while the idea of the theatre still provides one of the paradigms for today's installations, its rhetoric has been superseded by other concerns. In Double Bind (2001), the last major work by the Catalan artist Juan Munoz, the idea of the stage remains present through repeated use of framing devices. The installation at Tate Modern, London, provided a labyrinthine architecture of several levels and chambers and introduced trompe l'eil effects which encouraged multiple perspectives. Placed strategically, a series of cast figures, painted the same shade of grey as

the entire work, stood watching. The Turbine Hall, a cavernous and dramatic space combined with the monumental scale of the work to curtail intimacy and to remove the possibility of a single perspective for the static viewer. However, the theatricality of this installation was placed at the service of a dysfunctional play with the conditions of viewing which emphasized the alienation of the audience.  

The British collective Blast Theory have moved away from the constrictions of traditional performative spaces by engaging with the possibilities offered by new technologies. Their 1998 project, Kidnap, followed the popular format of Reality-TV where individuals were invited to compete for their own abduction. Two winners were selected and kidnapped by the group then taken to an undisclosed location where their captivity was filmed and could be watched as a live webcast. This project parallels the shift from static notions of space and time towards multiple spaces and simultaneous events, a move closely associated with the development of 'telematic media'. This term is used to describe the range of new tele-technologies that enable us to instantaneously and simultaneously transmit sound and vision to any number of locations. This simultaneity has a disorienting impact on our experience of space and time and has become an important issue in the development of Installation. Moreover, in recent years we have witnessed the arrival of digital technology, as well as the availability of new means of production and reception based around the processing power of the personal computer as a virtual studio. The virtual studio offers new working tools for artists, and encourages a nomadic and heterogeneous practice. The Mexican artist Stefan Bruggemann stated, in conversation with the authors, 'Who needs a studio? All an artist needs today is a computer and a phoneline.' Thus, these technologies have been instrumental in changing the role of the artist from that of a generator of original or primary materials, to that of an editor of existing cultural

The Mexican artist removed the plate-glass window of the exhibition space from the street elevation, allowing the audience to step through. The window that usually provides the first visual contact with the museum and its contents loses its function as a looking glass, while acquiring a new status as an exhibit.

A cycle of hissing white noise imposed itsetf on the space, only to be counterpointed by moments of pristine silence. The noise plundered one's ability to concentrate or complete a thought, while the silence was accompanied by an acute awareness of the moment of anticipation when thought could be resumed.  

objects to be inserted into new contexts. This argument is echoed in the book Postproduction by the French curator and theorist Nicolas Bourriaud who likens the activity of the artist to that of the computer programmer or the DJ. 'This recycling of sounds, images, and forms implies incessant navigation within the meanderings of cultural history, navigation which itself becomes the subject of artistic practice.  

The British author J. G. Ballard has extensively explored the shifts in cultural experience as we adapt to new technological landscapes. In an interview with the Italian journalist Lorenza Pignatti he stated: 'Our homes are slowly turning into TV studios, full of electronic equipment - camcorders, VcRs, advanced stereo systems - designed to make us the star, script-writer, director of our own continuing mini-drama. Reality is turning into a home movie, in which an infanticized version of ourselves runs across a garden of artificial grass.' However, though the technologies to which Ballard refers are having a deep impact, transforming the private representation of individual identities and the

environment of the home, the cinematic experience continues to dominate the public language of visual culture. Therefore, in spite of the proliferation of home entertainment, the resurgence of cinema-going since the 1980s reveals a continuing desire for immersion in a communal activity with repetitive conditions. The “immersive condition', discussed more fully in Chapter 1 (Escape) clarifies why the cinema has been crucial in the development of Installation. Cinema provides the dominant cultural experience that Installation must explore. Film has been instrumental in setting the viewing conditions and expectations for today's audiences, as it envelops the spectator in an overwhelming spectacle of narrative, sound and vision. Despite the escalation of 'special effects', along with the improvements in sound technology and viewer comforts which have helped to fill cinemas, watching films still relies on the traditional division between screen and audience. This separation provides, on the one hand, a practical viewing solution, while on the other, it allows the audience to focus on the narrative or the unfolding of the plot. Installation, through its use of cinematic techniques both quotes and deconstructs the experience of film: its viewing place and conditions, its narrative sequencing and its use of represented space. To this end, artists such as the American Ann Hamilton and the Canadian Stan Douglas have used the effects of early cinema in their installations.

Jonathan Hernandez, Everything is OK, 2001  

The Mexican artist Jonathan Hernandez confronts the viewer with a glittering statement about existence. His work elicits responses from his audiences, asking them to reflect on his statements, which are paradoxically banal and profound.  

Hamilton's Salic (1995) was staged in a disused passenger carriage and used the pre-cinematic device of the Zoetrope to arrive at flickering projections which simulated the train's movement. Douglas's Der Sandmann (1994-97), used two film projectors to create a split-screen effect. Douglas built two identical filmsets of a civic garden, one showin the garden in contemporary times, the other as it would have been in the 1970s. These were filmed using the same 360-degree rotation in a continuous pan and then projected to form two halves of a screen so that one image always appeared to wipe out the other. The resulting installation uses this complex technique to represent the return of repressed memory and history which the Austrian psychoanalyst Sigmund Freud describes in his essay The Uncanny (1919). Artists are using the physical apparatus of film-making, the language of cinematography and the subject matter of filmic narrative as a means of exploring the conditions of viewing when film is taken out of the cinema and installed in the gallery context. The British artist Sam Taylor-Wood makes multi-screen films, often casting well-known actors and celebrities, in which the camera is used as a static eye and the action unfolds in front of it. The use of recognizable personalities echoes the position of the film star in cinema. In Taylor-Wood's work the viewer remains unsure as to whether the celebrities are playing a part or are simply themselves. In so doing, the artist reveals the way in which life seeks to imitate film. In contrast, the Swiss artist Ugo Rondinone constructs atmospheric filmic installations which immerse t spectator in a repetitive and purposefully nostalgic dream-state.  

The work of the American artist Matthew Barney is emblematic of this confusion of boundaries between disciplines, as he fuses film, installation, theatre and set-design. His epic film cycle Cremaster is characterized by lush backdrops, slick art direction and labyrinthine narratives. On questioning one of his actors, Steve Tucker, guitarist in the band Morbid Angel about Cremaster 2 (1999], Tucker said: 'Dude, it's unbelievable..I could watch it a thousand times, frame by frame and never tire of watching it, but still never know completely what the fuck it was about.' In Barney's work, which operates between film and installation, the theatrical element is always present. 'Character, for Barney,' writes art critic Neville Wakefield, 'is sculptural material."  

While Installation was seen as an emerging practice, many attempts were made to define its ever-growing remit. In the current period,

Matthew Barney, Cremaster 2: The Drone's Exposition, 1999  

Alexandra Ranner, Basement, 2001 By transforming elements of photographs or stills from films into three-dimensional works, the German artist Alexandra Ranner re-creates spatial arrangements. These artificial, model-like replications are often reminiscent of the anonymity of cheap hotel rooms and furnished apartments. The atmospheric suggestion of the photographic or pictorial view is transformed into a bodily encounter.  

![images/5d13a1404170248fd98f1ed7f111dca0f0b03b0299b2048ea75a5a69570f1265.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/45Ffq71.jpeg)  

however, artists and curators make use of the term to describe a wide area of related activities across a range of media. Installation art has come to encompass other terms such as ‘intervention', 'interaction', ‘interior art', 'ambient',‘event' and 'project'. Within the field of lnstallation, such terms have equal standing and may even be interchangeable. They are used by artists, curators and critics to further define specific activities. The practice of Installation, then, is increasingly characterized by its multifariousness and polyphony. Some voices have been raised announcing the demise of Installation, or at least the possibility of it splitting into, or being replaced by, one or other of the terms mentioned above, though, crucially, Installation is seen to be moving from a position of homogeneity to one that stresses its heterogeneous nature. The process, execution and display of works now demonstrates a variety of emphases, each informed by a different context or enquiry. Faced with these changeable manifestations, the British artist Keith Tyson, the Turner Prize winner in 2002, suggests that the encounter with a work of contemporary art should not make the viewer ask 'what is it about, but how do I feel?' Tyson asserts the need for subjective readings as a means of dealing with unstable realities.  

One of the evolving facets of Installation was pointed out by the Canadian art historian Johanne Lamoureux who indicated a change in artists' attitudes towards the idea of site over a decade ago. The relationship between a work and its location, its 'site-specificity'. was once the crucial focus for artists and audiences. Lamoureux stated that ‘Installations today are often movable pieces, not the least ephemeral, transported from exhibition to exhibition, sometimes with slight, timely adaptations to fit a more peculiar context.' Lamoureux foresaw the need for installations to function as packages, to be adapted to the needs of given exhibitions, rather than being dominated by the demands of a non-art environment. The idea of the installation package or module can also be likened to the term 'interior art', suggested by the Dutch art historian Camiel van Winkel. Interior art is discussed as a symptom of the loss of public art by the Dutch theorist Dieter Roelstraete who refers to Van Winkel's term, arguing that 'the individualisation of spatial experience (or privatisation of space) by...young artists results, at a deeper level, in the privatisation of art tout court.' Roelstraete mourns the loss of public space, a place once closely associated with culture, and productive of stable meanings and truths. The move from exterior to interior is typified by the rise of interior art, itself a hybrid between art, fashionable design and lifestyle culture. Furthermore, the focus on internal space allows artists to sidestep the demands for universality inherent in the use of public, or external space.

Though compelling, the arguments for the return of Installation to the protected and internal space of the gailery, do not invalidate a continuing, often parallel connection with public locations. The American art historian Miwon Kwon perceives a change in the fixed reading of the site whether gallery or public space. In her influential book One Place After Another she calls this move away from a fixed reading 'site oriented', suggesting that place is not about fixity, nor the extraction of a definite meaning from a site. Rather, the move gives rise to artists whose practice is nomadic, fluid and sometimes even virtual rather than restricted to a geographical  

Carl von Weiler, Matrix, 1998 In this work by the British artist Carl von Weiler, television sets were installed in a tow dark space, clinging to the ceilings and emitting feeble sounds and light levels from their hanging screens. The images on the monitors were of the artist actually hanging upside down like a bat.

For Cross over he dug up the gravel in his drive which had a depression in it and was collecting rainwater. The puddle was transferred to a showcase with a soundtrack of dripping water.  

below Sarah Sze, Everything that Rises Must Converge,1999 Sarah Sze uses the detritus of everyday life, brought together into organic-like structures which expand vertically and fill the entire exhibition space. These fragile, meticulously arranged constructions are adaptable to largescale sites, merging space and material.

place or institution. If the site is no longer a precondition for the work, it follows that the content of the work is not necessarily generated by the location. On the contrary, it is negotiated by the artist through the dialogue engendered by the project. The context, once a marker of site, has thus been superseded by the notion of mobility, as described by, among others, llya Kabakov and the Russian theorist Boris Groys. The current idea of art as a 'project' requires a pliable time-frame and a flexible or portable site. The freedom to travel without boundaries does have its problems, however. The endless international displacement of artists is likened by the American theorist Hal Foster to the activities of an ethnographer: ‘one selects a site, enters its culture and learns its language, conceives and presents a project, only to move to the next site where the cycle is repeated.' The problem of the location is echoed by the Swiss artist Thomas Hirschhorn:  

It is a provisional location, since the construction will be dismantled after the exhibition. But it is a location which is unequivocal - unequivocal because I am invited to...a city I don't know and whose history and inhabitants I know nothing about. But I come with the desire to make sculptures and show them to the residents and visitors of this city. And so I don't want to make reference to anything that has to do with the city; that would be pretentious... So I selected a location which is a nonplace, i.e. a place where people can or must go for reasons that have nothing to do with the geography or history of the place.   
Hirschhorn correctly identified the problem of immersion in a context   
provided by a location or site, and Foster's comparison between the   
artist and the ethnographer was indeed recognizable in the installations   
by many artists throughout the 1980s and the first half of the 1990s.   
As the context of the site became the content of the work, the artist was   
cast in the various roles of tourguide or archivist. This position proved to

be unenviable, since it did little to 'reveal' what was not already known. Hirschhorn's position is by no means unique among contemporary artists. Eschewing local habits, histories and politics has allowed artists to move from objective knowledge to the subjective and personal. This reliance on subjectivity impacts upon how artists perceive the exhibition context.  

The writer James Meyer echoes Miwon Kwon's earlier point by coining the term 'functional site'. This site, he argues, is 'a process, an operation occurring between sites, a mapping of institutional and discursive filiations and the bodies that move between them (the artist's above all). It is an informational site, a locus of overlap of text, photographs, and video recordings, physical places and things... It is a temporary thing; a movement; a chain of meanings devoid of a particular focus.' Kwon's reading of site states that it is now structured (inter)textually, rather than spatially, and its model is not a map but an itinerary, a fragmentary sequence of events and actions through spaces, that is, a nomadic narrative whose path is articulated by the passage of the artist.'  

The creation by the German artist Olav Westphalen, E.S.U.S., Extremely Site-Unspecific Sculpture (2ooo), a lunar pod-like structure, provides an ironic take on this 'nomadic' tendency. 'The E.S.U.S. - friendly but indifferent...acknowledges any given site and adapts to it.' The work refutes local context as 'being nostalgic, at times even picturesque', preferring mobility above the stasis caused by the overemphasis on local knowledge. The American artist Spencer Tunick uses the mobility of an idea from one place to another. The recurring motif is that of hundreds of bodies lying prone at selected locations, as in Maine [1997]. These temporary events are then documented in photographs and video. A salient feature of these displays is that all the participants are presented entirely naked, arranged in rows, piles or waves. Tunick's human subjects vary from one location to another. As bodies are replaced by new ones, the body itself is transformed into a mere component of theartwork.  

The idea of the public site has become increasingly important to 'regenerative urbanism', which seeks to reanimate post-industrial city spaces. According to the writer Suzanne Lacy, this creates an uneasy relationship between the concept of the public monument and 'new genre public art', with its emphasis on temporary installations and interventions. While the prospect of maintaining relationships with spaces beyond the gallery appears attractive to artists, the latter often seem reluctant to enter into a dialogue with the civic authorities and agencies that traditionally commission such works. However, the art historian Walter Grasskamp persists in arguing the case for public art, since it moves the emphasis from the gallery to the city. Under modernism we see an increasing trend towards an internalization, that is, a return to the physical and institutional sphere of the gallery and the museum. It may therefore be argued that, 'as cultural end sites, museums reinforced the demand for the high degree of protection which art now demanded.'

opposite above Rodney Graham, The King's Part,1999  

This position clearly privileges art of a permanent nature housed indoors over one of a temporary nature in the public sphere.  

It remains to be seen whether these state-sponsored approaches to public space, disguised as sculpture projects or sculpture trails, are a significant alternative to the strictures imposed by the museum, or whether it simply moves the institution outdoors. The British artist Keith Wilson's Puddle (1999] provides a useful counter-argument to this reading of public art. The artist simply created a depression in a path and filled it with water, creating an artificial puddle. The work caused much debate and consternation at the time and illustrates the way in which a growing number of artists are approaching public commissions. It also serves to demonstrate that the internalization referred to by Grasskamp can also be seen as a rediscovery of the artist's and spectator's subjectivity and not simply as institutional pressure. In this instance, both models - public space and the museum - are replaced by privacy and introspection.

Subjective models of space have played an important part in the visual arts throughout the 20th century. Salient examples include Piet Mondrian's studio, Kurt Schwitters' house, Marcel Duchamp's exhibition arrangements and Brian O'Doherty's description of the 'white cube'. All of these have provided readings of spatial concepts which have been of great significance to Installation art. In each case, we find a conflation of real space with the concept of an ideal model. The German art historian Oskar Batschmann argues that one of Installation's key characteristics is the ability to form a perceivable space, modelled or arranged towards the presence of the viewer. The above examples are then reminders of the difference between lived space and experienced, or represented space.  

The King's Part [1999), a mobile installation by the Canadian artist Rodney Graham, provides a complex model for art in which the mechanism is revealed rather than the intended result. The installation

absorbing experience.

The Dutch artist Maurice van Tellingen creates models which include   
photography and video. In this work Van Tellingen uses miniature scenes in which the illusion of space is   
heightened by the combination of   
the two media. The effect makes the three-dimensional image more real and the action of the drama is rendered atmospheric and filmic as the viewer remains unaware of the plot. Van   
Tellingen deliberately leaves the main action outside the frame of the work, thus building tension.

presents a soundproofed box in which the audience can listen to the third flute concerto of Frederick ll, King of Prussia. However, no music can be heard since the flute is not blown, the only sounds is the percussive clicks of the instrument's keys performing the work.  

Ein Haus fur Schweine und Menschen (A House for Pigs and People,1997), a collaboration by the artists Carsten Holler and Rosemarie Trockel, combines a minimalist building with a pigsty. The building is split in half by a glass screen, separating the audience from the animals. The architecture of the work proposes an ironic model for the genetic coexistence of animals and humans. Each of these two examples presents a particular model which questions the viewer's perception of their own presence. The viewer's sensation is heightened by the artwork's ability to propose an altered relationship between the individual and their social environment (Holler/Trockel) and the actual bodily experience through the muting of sound  

(Graham). In each case the model creates artificial conditions and provides an environment separate from the external world. At the same time, it is a functioning environment which offers a parallel experience in real time.  

By contrast, in architecture, models and computer-generated images serve primarily as future projections for buildings, as in the case of the designs for the new Turner Museum in Margate by the Norwegian practice Snohetta. Only the actual building provides the user with a tangible spatial sensation. In Installation, as we have seen, the model supports a particular way of addressing the viewer's experience and ceases to be merely a tool. The Dutch artist Maurice van Tellingen maintains that the scale-model, though a traditional genre, can be a miniature installation which challenges viewers' perceptions of space.

entered to be perceived and enjoyed. Accordingly, the painstakingly assembled works by the Belgian artist Hans Op de Beeck and the Russian artist Alexander Brodsky operate on the principle of drawing the viewer into their reduced, yet highly effective theatrical spaces. The model offers an alternative dimension to the activity of Installation art: the viewer cannot enter it other than by virtue of the imagination, albeit by reducing their own scale. This activity of translating scale, from the large to the tiny, and vice versa, provides an invaluable insight into the nature of the viewing experience.  

This experience is further challenged by the development of Virtual Reality and Mixed Reality, that is, totally or partially simulated environments. This advanced use of computer technology has brought about the simulation of sites and situations, allowing us to experience different spaces at will, and additionally has called into question our perception of what is real and what is not. The idea of the virtual model differs in many aspects from the 'real' miniature, yet both could be designated as 'heterotopias', a term associated with the French philosopher Michel Foucault. Heterotopias are 'something like counter-sites, a kind of effective enacted utopia in which the real sites, all the other real sites which can be found within the culture, are simultaneously represented, contested and inverted. Places of this kind are outside of all places, even though it may be possible to indicate their location in reality. The Swedish artist Sven Pahlsson creates entire virtual cities, while the German artist Martin Dorbaum presents private spaces drawn from the domestic. Dorbaum's spaces are achieved without the aid of photographs. They only exist in the digital realm, rather than being modelled on the basis of photographic representations. Similarly, the British artist Paul Noble's Unified Nobson (2001), an animated video installation, is entirely conceived in the artist's imagination. No pretense of realism

is made, and the projection reads like a black-and-white drawing, which is charming yet carries an undercurrent of menace. In his book Being Digital, the media theorist Nicholas Negroponte states: 'Computers and art can bring out the worst in each other when they first meet. One reason is that the signature of the machine can be too strong..the flavor of the computer can drown the subtler signals of the art. Though technology has become an integral part of Installation art, it is the way in which artists have appropriated these advances that is important. These 'techniques' have been integrated into their work by artists, often highlighting the artificiality of the medium. Pahlsson and Dorbaum's rendering of space has nothing to do with perceived reality; on the contrary, the digital medium is exposed for what it is. The artists revel in the artificiality of their environments, pointing out that the parallel and simulated worlds of gaming are of greater interest than their real counterparts. Negroponte' argument is thus reversed, making the centrality of the computer's signature desirable.

These spaces, like the real miniatures discussed above, might be described as simulations of elsewhere. The real site may indeed exist, but it is replaced by another version, as recalled in the painstakingly accurate scale models of the Dutch artist Frank Halmans entitled The bedrooms in which I still wake up (1996-2002). These installations in miniature, as the artist prefers to call them, are purported to be facsimiles of spaces in which the artist has dwelled. The intimate detail provided by the spaces (individual books on shelves, evidence of tiny hands on distressed paintwork) gives the viewer a sense of familiarity making them almost believable. Their attraction resides in the fact that the viewer is confronted with simultaneous sites: the visible simulation and its real counterpart.  

The French theorist Gilles Deleuze maintains the need to reconcile these two positions: the real and the copy. He suggests that each real thing exists in different formats, including that of the simulacrum. In her book on Deleuze, the writer Claire Colebrook claims that 'each unique work of art...is a simulation.' On the basis of this statement, it might be argued that the virtual is the precondition of the real; the real, argues Deleuze, is an image first, before fulfilling its promise of becoming.

'The idea of "copy" presupposes some original model and Western thought has been dominated by the idea of the copy.: An example of this theme can be seen in Micha Ullman's installation Empty Library (1995) in Berlin, which marks the burning of books by Nazi students, 10 May 1933. The subterranean rectangular room filled with empty shelving can only be glimpsed through a small glass pane inserted into the cobblestones of the Bebelplatz. Here, the temporary installation has given way to a permanent monument which exhibits a 'paradoxical dysfunctionality'. The paradox resides in the fact that the installation is actually an antimonument, it is inaccessible and difficult to view. In addition, it does not attempt to celebrate an event, preferring instead to act as a sombre

Standing back, the largescale models appeared to be the same size as the Tyne Bridge which could be seen through a panoramic window.

above left Francesc Torres, The Repository of Absent Flesh,1998 In this work twenty objects were displayed on separate identical steel tables in a darkened, warehouse-like space. As the viewer approached each table, a beam of light abruptly illuminated the object and a disembodied voice told the story of the display. Each one referred to a fictive character, acting as metaphors of their memory. The Catalan artist Torres created a vast archive of narrations on memory and modern identity, a portrait of our age, composed as a Proustian history.

warning. Ullman's installation provides a model of a library, but not of any particular one, thus eschewing the quest for authenticity.  

As new forms of Installation move into the mainstream, questions of value are inevitably raised and addressed. Museums, commercial galleries and collectors have been instrumental in this change. Since more Installation art has found its way into large-scale exhibitions and, subsequently, into major collections, the relationship between the artist, the curator and the collector has been altered. While questioning exhibition practices, Installation has been central in changing the display and collection activity of institutions. The Swedish curator Maria Lind states, 'lt is about scepticism and enthusiasm, affirmation and critique all at the same time. As the older generation, so to speak, "broke the ice" with their confrontations and polemics it is easier today to be more nuanced, smart and sensitive.' Installation art now combines a flexible approach to display, while insisting on interaction and discussion with the audience as an integral part of the work itself. Though the collection 'remains the key to the museum', according to the curator Hans-Ulrich Obrist, the question arises about its nature and contents. Obrist makes the distinction between objects and ‘life-works'. The latter term refers to artworks involving installations, events and actions in a close relationship with the viewer. Although objects provide the backbone of the institution, it is arguable that new forms will continue to be added to collections which challenge the format and direction of the museum. These new forms may be seen as positively disruptive influences operating within the body of the collection, undermining the educational status of the museum, a development that the British writer Richard Sennett sees as beneficial. He also offers a note of caution, suggesting that participation should not

The artist's preoccupation with turning spaces into photo machines, e.g. laundromats converted into pinhole cameras, explores the issue of the self-sufficient machine, which loses its former function and takes on a personality of alienation.

In one single action, the spectators destroyed the artist's work, while also disrupting the perfection of the gallery space.  

substitute for interpretation, leading to the collapse of critical thinking. However, the establishment of new types of audience interaction proposes a different form of interpretation. Interaction is then not simply an opportunity to ensure the audience's participation, but instead suggests a creative engagement with the content of the artwork which directly impacts on the evaluation of the museum itself.  

These developments and discussions are well under way in many contemporary institutions and have introduced new forms of display. A curious example of these changes can be found in an unlikely setting: the One Picture Gallery in Penza, Russia, can be seen as an institution unwittingly dedicated to the techniques of Installation art. Paradoxically, it shows no installation whatsoever, instead displaying a single painting at a time. Before viewing the painting, the visitors are given a slide-show that contextualizes the work. Finally, the curtain is drawn back to reveal the single painting. The artwork is framed by a theatrical set. In this instance the experience of the work is mediated by the addition of a further frame, the frame of the proscenium arch. This setting points to the problem of attention commonly experienced in museums, as we are distracted by too many works on display. Though showing only single paintings, the museum makes use of the techniques of Installation in creating a setting for the work, thus turning the work into an environment

In a discussion between the critics Jeffrey Kastner and Mary Jane Jacob, we are made aware of a paradigmatic shift which has taken place in the art of recent years, suggesting that 'less emphasis was placed on creating an artifact in the traditional sense, and more on exposing and challenging the processes that create cultural activity, whether or not they create art as an object.' According to Kastner's and Jacob's argument, the creation of objects becomes optional. The nomadic artist leaves no physical trace behind and simply moves on. It is arguable that Installation art, with its shift in emphasis from site to open-ended projects, leads to a ‘belonging-in-transience' for artists, a state that is neither dependent on lasting objects nor on fixed locations. Accordingly. Michael Landy's installation proposes the wholesale removal of the object: the destruction of the belongings that make up the artist's material life presents a vast installation as a process culminating in dust. Break Down suggests a last futile stand of the idea of the Gesamtkunstwerk, the ‘total artwork'. By confronting us with our own conspicuous consumption, Landy suggests that after art's demise there is always shopping. As Landy writes, 'This project is a kind of luxury in one respect. I don't want the work to be seen as purely negative, as a sacrifice. In a sense, it's the ultimate consumer choice.

opposite page staatsbankberlin, Einstein on the Beach, 2002 For this opera/installation at the staatsbankberlin, artists from various fields as well as scientists were included in the cast. All installations assumed functions traditionally assigned to the theatre. Operatic action became sculptural, the installations provided content for the action, and the music interacted with the artworks and the architecture. During the performance - which lasted four and half hours - the spectator was free to move around in the various halls and levels of the building and explore it as an exhibition. The live music was heard throughout the space and video transmissions allowed for constant monitoring of what was happening in the other rooms. The performance space as a whole was considered as a zone of interaction between the operatic action and artistic and scientific ‘intervention strategies'. The participating artists and scientists focused their research either on the relationship between private life and science or on the spectators' attitude towards the music.

# escape  

If a place can be defined as relational, historical and concerned with identity, then a space which cannot be defined as relational, or historical, or concerned with identity will be a non-place. The hypothesis advanced here is that supermodernity produces non-places.  

Describing the sumptuous installations of the Norwegian artist Borre Saethre, the critic Ina Blom uses the term 'immersive mode...a type of experience in which the subjective awareness...appears to merge with the artwork, so as to create a sensation of a new, more powerful, experience of totality.' Experience is mediated through the body: the degree to which our sensory faculties are stimulated is linked to the impact that an experience has on us. An 'immersive' work may be described as a mixture of sensory and narcissistic pleasure offered to the viewer. Saethre's non-places' are part interior design and part filmset. We are cocooned in the lush experience of the work and identify with its retro-futuristic chic, recognizable from film and television. The artwork's aim to elicit sensual pleasure through sensory manipulation is significant as it mirrors developments in contemporary life; the theorist Frederic Jameson states that 'We are submerged...to the point where our postmodern bodies are bereft of spatial coordinates and practically incapable of distantiation.' Jameson  

uses the term 'submerged' to describe a space that leaves the individual in a state of confusion. This lack of orientation returns the audience to a reliance on sensation and subjectivity. The critic Paul Virilio suggests that perspectival geometry, in which space is ordered and stable, has given way to 'the relativity of an accidental, discontinuous and heterogeneous space'. These shifts mark important changes in the development of Installation in recent years, as sensation itself appears to have replaced the traditional art object. The 'immersive mode', referred to above, has become a key condition of viewing: it appears to indicate a withdrawal into the self, to a place of bodily sensation. It allows artists to propose an escape from perceived reality which no longer offers stable boundaries.  

The Chinese writer Sze Tsung Leong suggests that the term 'space' has been superseded by the idea of 'control space'. Space, in other words, no longer exists as a three-dimensional construct, but instead enables the packaging of total environments - the total engagement of the senses - where sights, smells, sounds, feelings are engineered, refined... and deployed for maximum effect. Control space, Leong continues, 'can be anywhere.' Leong's idea of space provides a useful example for the new interpretation of Installation art. The loss of 'site', discussed in the Introduction, can be linked to  

changes in our urban experience: the city is no longer perceived as an entity or object, nor is it based on traditional human relationships. In other words, the city is now marked by discontinuity and uncertainty, it has become a 'non-place'. The way we think about space is therefore wholly experiential and is reliant on a series of stimuli, which renders our perception of it much more fluid and transient.  

The American artist Andrea Zittel's installation Raugh Furniture: Lucinda (1998) provides an ironic look at how we inhabit public and private space. It is a living-room setting in which nature merges with the man-made environment. The gallery in which the installation is presented is occupied by large rock formations of foam rubber, which double as seating and sleeping arrangements. The outside, usually unforgiving and hard, is transformed into a comfortable and relaxing interior fit for human enjoyment. The same artist's A-Z Escape Vehicles [1996], designed like minimalist survival capsules, extend the artist's concern with containment and comfort. While their very mobility alludes to and elicits a sense of nomadism, the displacement also acknowledges a desire for solitude, for withdrawal into the self.  

The themes of privacy and contemplative withdrawal are echoed in the works of artists such as Gregor Schneider, Lee Bul and Absalon. Absalon, from Israel, foresaw the audience's fascination with intimate spaces in the early 1990s. His installations, each carrying the title Cellule (1991-92), took the form of white cardboard and plaster structures, tailormade for the artist. These minimal cells displayed a monastic quality which lent itself to contemplation. By modifying the architecture, I compelled the visitors to be aware of themselves inside my space,' says Absalon. 'Thus, through his vision of a few items meant for his own use and adapted for rest and peace of mind, the artist describes the domestic universe.' By contrast, the Korean artist Lee Bul presents shiny plastic shells which are highly engineered. Rather than inspired by architecture, they are derived from cutting-edge product design. The futuristic pods, cocoon the individual within environments made for single persons.  

If the audience in the work of Absalon and Bul is reduced to the individual, it could be argued that the German artist Gregor Schneider requires no public at all. His work The Dead House Ur, (1985-) often related to Kurt Schwitters's celebrated Merzbau, consists of the endless remodellings of his house in his native town of Rheydt. The work is 'solitary and secretive' and involves covering the interior with a separate layer by copying or doubling what is beneath. The actual work receives few visitors, but, occasionally, Schneider rebuilds sections of it in museums and galleries. His Ur appears to be a celebration and excavation of a specific site, yet on closer examination it is revealed to be a simulation, a situation in which all semblance of the original is lost. As states the  

French theorist Jean Baudrillard, 'It is no longer a question of imitation, nor duplication, nor even parody. It is a question of substituting the signs of the real for the real.' The house, its history and function are obliterated by the installation which mimics the original. Although ostensibly the same, the artwork shares none of the house's characteristics and functions, leading to a clear separation between what is real and what is not. The French writer Bernard Marcade writes of a certain utopia that is 'situated in the non-place of the world'. These are 'locations which of themselves constitute universes provided with an autonomous economy and an autonomous imaginary realm'. Marcade's notion of a 'non-place' utopia might be shared by the Swiss artists Biefer/Zgraggen, whose work entitled God [1998] proposes a parody of a space of worship in the shape of a vast styrofoam dome construction. Lit from within, its surface, rather than being perfectly finished, is roughly constructed in the manner of a stage set. A changing room is provided for viewers to remove their clothes before confronting God. The artists stated: When you look at something beautiful, you also feel as if you are being observed by what you are observing.' The viewer is 'scrutinized' by the work and by other viewers, who themselves are also naked. Although the idea of the 'immersive' may be represented ironically in Biefer/Zgraggen's work, the notion of immersiveness indicates the broadening of references and attitudes towards space and its  

relation to the spectator's body. In the Belgian artist Ann Veronica Janssen's work Blue, Red and Yellow (2001), steam is released into a specially constructed plexiglas space. The external walls are coated with transparent coloured film, which allows natural light to infuse the room. Unable to see the confines of the space, the audience is enveloped in dense fog which generates shifting patterns of coloured light. As the American artist and writer Robert Smithson has argued, museum and gallery spaces could thus become venues for new forms of entertainment, like discotheques'. Janssen's work borrows the sense of euphoria generated by the use of light and sound made in night clubs. Blue, Red and Yellow generates an atmosphere that is reliant on the audience's ability to 'let go' and become 'lost' in the work.  

The connection between club culture and Installation is no accident. The writer Aldo Bonomi characterizes club culture as 'the quest for outer limits and the realisation of fantasies' which 'are at the heart of existential experience...a smooth space where lived time pursues a glimmering trip-hop of impulses and emotions.' The ambience in clubs is at once introspective, immersive and social; these spaces provide compelling examples of human activity which may cross over into the production and reception of art. In galleries and museums we are now witnessing the rise of a new conviviality brokered by the desire to communicate with others. This activity of spending time in the public space provided by art  

ranges from interaction and conversation to simply sharing the place with others, while witnessing an event, a familiar occurence for any theatre, concert or cinema-goer. The installation is therefore a focal point for the viewer's attention, as well as a meeting place.  

The work of the American artist Doug Aitken exemplifies the change in audience's expectation and attitude. In his exhibition 'New Ocean', at the Serpentine Gallery in London (2002), he showed a wide range of large-scale video projections. The interior of the gallery was remodelled to house 360-degree projections of waterfalls, melting glaciers and other natural phenomena. Eschewing the usual formality of the gallery, the audience was invited to sit or lie on the floor in the darkened rooms to enjoy the spectacle. The work created a viewing environment that was part cinematic and part 'chill-out lounge'. Works such as New Ocean are indicative of certain types of installations as 'ambients', relaxed spaces that envelop the viewer while stimulating their senses. Such places are not unique to Installation art, however, and find their counterparts in design and music developments, as well as in 'lifestyle culture'. Other examples of this tendency are found in work by the American partnership Diller+Scofidio whose media pavilion for Swiss Expo 2002 entitled Blur Building (2002) - a platform rising from a lake, and shrouded in an artificial cloud - promotes a harmonic relationship between the architectural space, the surrounding landscape and the audience. Viewers are cocooned in high-tech rainmacs which keep them dry as they negotiate the pavilion, and eventually end up in a bar. Diller+Scofidio made use of extensive sensory stimuli to immerse their audiences in environments that fostered sociability through shared experience.  

A different approach to immersivity was given in the collaboration of the British artists Bruce Gilchrist and Jo Joelson entitled Polaria [2002), the result of a research project in Greenland. On site, over several weeks, the artists recorded natural light conditions. The final work consisted of a white booth with a perspex ceiling which hid an arsenal of fluorescent lights. Viewers entered the space one at a time wearing an insulated white coat and sat in a clear perspex chair. By resting their hands on copper transmitters in the armrests of the chair, the electrical circuit was closed. The lights overhead came on and their luminosity could be controlled by the amount of pressure exerted on the copper pads. The experience of the arctic light was enhanced by the low ambient temperature in the booth. Although the installation referred to a specific site in the sub-polar region, the white booth at its centre merely proposed a space that enveloped the spectator, allowing the individual to explore the changing light conditions. Greenland thus ceased to be a real site and was replaced by the spectator's imagination. The roots of works such as Polaria are arguably to be found in the 'sites' and 'non-sites' of Minimal artists of the 1960s, which traced the relationship between outdoor and gallery spaces as a means of critiquing display'; yet a crucial change in current artists' attitudes has emerged: no critique of the exhibition system is intended, instead, the focus rests with the viewer as a sentient being.

The immersive space remains fundamentally an experiential and sentient place, though it is also a means of escaping our everyday conditions. Often departing from the artist's body, needs and imagination it succeeds in disconnecting the spectators from their everyday surroundings and transporting them to a place of contemplation. This is not a direct contemplation of the world first and foremost, but a viewing of the self contemplating the external world. As Franz Kafka wrote:'It seems to me that I am not in front of my house, but in front of myself, in front of myself sleeping, and that I at the same time have the joy of sleeping profoundly and of guarding over myself as a sentry.'

This installation by the Norwegian artist consisted of two inflatable structures of parachute silk, powered by motorized fans. The envelopes changed form as the supply of air varied, resembling a giant organism. While gently billowing, the structures were nonetheless perceived as invasive and suggestive of coerciveness. Though the audience perceived no threat, its freedom of movement became restricted.

His work articulates the spaces of buildings while simulating bodily membranes. These structures are constructed from polyamide, shaped by being pulled across architectural spaces or gorged with substances like powdered turmeric or lead shot. The process is always intrinsic to the form. Neto has created entire rooms out of polyamide material suspended from existing ceiling structures. The corners are weighted and looped over beams or rings to create a semitransparent cube with concave walls. These walls are disturbingly skin-like, an association that the artist sometimes highlights by embroidering small orifices into the membrane. Other polyamide objects are arranged in clusters, taking the form of soft standing tubes, like fungi or crowds of amorphous figures. In every case the works are highly sensual, an experience heightened by the aroma of·turmeric or cloves, which strikes visitors long before they see the installations.

Based on combinations of the square and the circle, every Cellule was selfcontained and painted pristine white. Combining elements from the ideals of Le Corbusier with the rigours of the Bauhaus, he produced models of mental and physical spaces. The interiors were cramped, the proportions of the spaces exclusively fitted the artist's body.

For the German artist Gregor Schneider the house acts as a mirror, a thin barrier between the world as it is, and the world as he would like it to be. In Schneider's terms the house is a space of reclusion, a shrine for anxieties, needs and   
aspirations. In the late 198ns the artist started transforming his house into a projection of his thoughts. Constantly assembling, excavating, constructing and deconstructing, he has rebuilt   
walls, added rooms, corridors and   
wells, turning his house into a labyrinth.  

The house takes on its own personality and life, claustrophobic and silent, a totally hermetic environment allowing the artist to act out, unseen, his imagined desires and fears. Schneider reconstructs the house from the original as a series of public installations. He meticulously takes apart the original and reassembles parts in public museums and galleries. The overall game of reconstruction, display of the real, or fake, fuses together into a blind Borgian play with no beginning or end.

below Mischa Kuball, 'Believe/ Disbelieve', 1999 Kuball's installation focused on blurring the boundaries of built space. Two large motorized mirror-balls spun in the space, while projectors beamed  

slides with letters from the alphabet onto their surfaces. The room, lit by moving specks of light, appeared to be spinning simultaneously in two opposed directions, producing an effect which was both vertiginous and unnerving.

below right Kazuo Katase, Winterreise, 1998 The installation of the Japanese artist Kazuo Katase made use of elementary geometries and the play of light and shadow. It was built around the Zen  

concept of koan-chaos-satori, meaning 'the way', a term associated with Japanese sites and ritual. He extends this theme to other situations, through contemplation of Western philosophies and an involvement with theatrical  

elements - stage sets and spatial dramatization. His work points out that the meaning of being cannot be grasped rationally, only experienced.

opposite above Pierre Huyghe, L'expedition scintillante, a musical, Act 1, Act 2, Act 3 (The Glistening Expedition) 2002 The French artist Pierre Huyghe set up an imaginary journey to Antarctica as a musical, using spatial stagings which included ice, water, rain, fog and snow. A large ship made of ice slowly melted in one of the galleries, while elsewhere a black skating rink served as the stage for the musical. The entire building was programmed so that light, weather, music and action followed a filmscript.  

opposite below Yayoi Kusama, Dots Obsession,2000 This work was presented at the Consortium in Dijon in 2000. Fifty years of involvement in contemporary art has established her as a phenomenon. Her work, as she describes it, is a reflection of her inner life; it includes poetry. novet writing, sculpture and painting and constitutes a body without limits or boundaries. She has taken up residence in a psychiatric hospital where the calm and solitude allow her dreams to travel.

the participators total sensory overload as if they were physically immersed in the computer game. Finally, they were offered an exit through a faise escape hatch smelling of cherries.

above Julian 0pie, Imagine that you are moving, 1997 This work was installed at Terminal 1, Heathrow Airport in 1997. In a secure enclosure, designed by the architect Richard Rogers to cater specifically for transit passengers making connections with international flights,Opie's commission presented a stylized vision of the British landscape on four massive lightboxes which ran the full length of the atria and dominating the whole space. This encounter with Britain was inverted in the second part of Opie's work; dispersed around the transfer lounge waiting area were a series of closed circuit monitors. These showed the same stylized landscape, but the images travelled across the screens.The viewer was static but the landscape moved on.

Using atmospheric material from retro feature films combined with his own film material and a soundtrack, the Swiss artist Ugo Rondinone created a performative situation of sustained action and enclosed space.

The overall effect of the work gave the feeling of being submerged, like swimming in a weightless space. Surrounded by projections and swallowed by the play of shadows and colour, the disoriented viewer tried to find their own intimate order in this apparently fragmented vision. Literal space was transformed into psychological space.

opposite far right Dalziel+Scullion, Rain, 2000 The structure of this work by Scottish artists Dalziel+Scullion was conceived as a temporary pavilion for the contemplation of rain. A tin roof amplifted the sound of rain, and channelled it into a collecting pool at the rear. The pavilion was entered by a long wooden ramp, and a bench was provided for visitors. The walls of the structure were clad in a cellular plastic material, which reflected light during the daylight hours. In the evening the structure was lit by an animated 'gobo' system which created a stylized pattern of rain on the walls.

A fine mist sprayed through thirteen thousand nozzles created an artificial cloud 300 feet wide $(97m)$ .200 feet deep $(70m)$ and65 feet high $(20m)$ A built-in weather station controlled the fog output by responding to the shifting climatic conditions, measuring the temperature, humidity, wind direction and wind speed. The public approached the Blur via a bridge. The 400-foot long $\{122,m\}$ ramp deposited visitors at the centre of the fog mass on a large open-air platform. Visual and acoustic references were erased when entering the fog, leaving only an optica!

Btur Building, a media pavilion created for the Swiss Expo 2002, was situated questionnaire and received a ‘braincoat' (smart raincoat). The coat was used as protection from the wet and for storing the personality data of the audience communicating with the cloud's computer network. Using tracking and location technology, the position of each visitor could be identified, and as they passed one another, the coats compared profiles and changed colour indicating the degree of attraction or reputsion, much like an involuntary btush. The system allowed interaction among four hundred visitors at a time. Visitors could climb another level to the Angel Bar at the summit. The final ascent resembled the sensation of flight as visitors pierced through the cloud layer to the open sky.

This attempt to discover new ways in which to position the body both spatially and socially focuses on Zittel's preoccupation with the nomadic state of human beings.

# author and institution  

The relationship between art and the institutions in which art is displayed, such as museums, came to play an increasingly important role in the production and reception of art from the 1960s onwards. By the early 1980s, the questioning of the relationships of power between authorship and institutions was seen by many critics as necessary for a postmodern practice, as argued by Hal Foster: ..just as the conceptual artists extended the minimalist analysis of the art object, so too...later artists have opened up the conceptual critique of the art institution in order to intervene in ideological representations and languages of everyday life.' Progressively, artists have come to resist the centratity of the institution in their work. They now tend to move away from projects displayed inside museums, even when given license to critique internal power structures, thus showing their reluctance to participate in arguments formulated by and for museum professionals.  

Although artists acknowledge the importance of the gallery space as a means of disseminating their work, the idea of fusing the exhibition with the concept of the gallery has gained ground. In so doing, Installation artists are able to circumvent the agenda of the institution, albeit by appropriating its language and organizational structures. An ironic example of this appropriation strategy can be seen at the Leytonstone Center for Contemporary Art. This  

organization, launched in 2001, is run by the British artist Bob & Roberta Smith and the American artist and curator Jessica Voorsanger. Leytonstone, a London suburb, houses no significant arts venues. The grandly named Center contains a single skylit exhibition space in a purpose-built shed at the end of the artist's garden. The space may be viewed as a complete artwork or as an art centre in name only, which parodies existing modes of display. It follows that the 'white cube', synonymous with the idea of display, may be removed from the museum or the gallery and reappear in the context of an artist's suburban garden. The Thai artist Navin Rawanchaikul provided an alternative to the standard gallery. His I [love] TAX/ (2001] was an exhibition space in which the emphasis was on its reduced scale and portable nature. Artists were invited to create installations in the back of the cab for future passengers. Thus, the audience was reduced to small numbers of individuals who hailed the taxi for the purpose of transport while witnessing an art event.  

Though alternative display spaces have been instrumental in the presentation of new and challenging works, their strategies have also been adopted by mainstream galleries. Michael Elmgreen and Ingar Dragset, from Denmark and Norway, install Modernist white cubes in galleries, museums and public spaces. These architectural interventions  

betray an ironic return to Modernist, functional desigr principles and simultaneously act as spaces for cruising', that is for sexual encounters. Their exhibit Taking Place (2001-2002] at the Kunsthalle in Zurich, on the other hand, literally tore down the walls of the galleries, disrupting the workings of the institution. Nothing was completed, rather, it was the upheaval generated by destruction and rebuilding that constituted the work. Elmgreen & Dragset's installation echoed the ideas of the architect and urbanist Cedric Price who proposed that buildings should not be long-lasting, but should disintegrate after a few years. Price also argued that the 21st-century museum should use uncertainty and incompleteness as a catalyst for change.  

However, according to Maria Lind, curator at the Moderna Museet in Stockholm, the museum continues to be 'thought of as a place of display, a showroom, and exhibitions are taken for granted as the natural way of dealing with art.' Lind goes on to describe a type of work that is oriented towards the everyday. It generally wants to avoid the solemnity and the static quality that often embody institutions, when it is not downright critical of them. Lind argues that the institution is not dismissed or rejected by these projects, but is problematised'. The Swiss-born curator Hans Ulrich Obrist has suggested a shift in the culture of museums, to transform them into laboratories'. He states that 'the idea of embracing contradictions is very important.. The laboratory is about leaving the museum, is against the museum.' Obrist is known for innovative exhibitions and concepts which have travelled to cities worldwide. These include Cities on the Move Iwith the Chinese curator Hou Hanru) in London, Bordeaux, Humblebaek, Helsinki, Vienna and Bangkok [1997-99)], Unbuilt Roads (1997] with Guy Tortosa and Do It (1994-2001), an exhibition format presented in numerous different cities. Obrist advocates flexible exchange with artists, curators and architects. Influenced by Obrist's working methodology, a group of 105 artists, working under the rubric Morphing Systems took over a former hospital in Zurich (1998] and began to intervene and interact with each other's works over a period of six months. The hospital site provided in the first place a point of reference for the artists, only to be replaced as the focus for subsequent interventions.  

It remains significant that these projects are always accompanied by a publication. Once simply described as'exhibition catalogues'which complemented the exhibitions, these publications have come to alter, add to, and indeed challenge the perception of the work. The photograph, as a means of documenting a work of art, has had an important role in preserving temporary installations. Indeed, it might be argued that the photograph (in books, magazines and on the internet) has become a major means of viewing Installation art, and that it has superseded witnessing the actual work in situ. Walter Benjamin and Andre Malraux wrote extensively about the  

photograph's power to change our perception of art. The result of this technique of reproduction was a waning of uniqueness. While Installation art, through its temporal nature and reliance on place, does not require uniqueness per se, it nonetheless depends on the viewer's experience. The photograph may serve as an aide-memoire, but it can only offer a view, without transmitting the experience of the work. The display of an installation via a photograph certainly alters its reception as we move from the position of the viewer to that of the reader or browser.  

The art theorist Brian O'Doherty refers to the perception of the viewer by stating: 'Avant-garde gestures have two audiences: one which was there and one - most of us - which wasn't.' O'Doherty goes on to argue that the original audience completes the work through memory after seeing the work. 'We from a distance know better. The photographs of the event restore to us the original moment, but with much ambiguity.' llya Kabakov, who arguably wrote the most detailed 'manual' in existence for Installation art, argues that 'any installation is incredibly, impossibly sensitive to the place where it is constructed.' To Kabakov, firsthand experience of the work remains crucial. Although we have become used to the documentary value of the photograph (and video] in communicating installations to wider audiences, rarely do we question how our experience is altered by the shift from presence to reproduction. By placing the work in the context of a publication, the viewer's perception of the work is irrevocably altered. The publication is not simply a means of extending the exhibition's visibility, but it allows curators, artists and designers to rework the context in which the work is shown. This has resulted in innovative ways of displaying installation projects, while allowing the artistic and curatorial processes involved in the work to become revealed. Salient published examples include Rem Koolhaas/Hans Ulrich 0brist's Mutations (2001), Morphing Systems' eponymous catalogue, Damien Hirst's / want to spend the rest of my life everywhere, with everyone, one to one, always, forever, now [1997]. The key difference between the traditional catalogue and these examples, is that the more innovative publication extends the possibilities for dialogue and the remit of the installation itself. The publication has thus replaced the importance of site to become the place and meaning of the work. Countless catalogues and magazines have aspired to present 'exhibitions' on the printed page, as predicted by Malraux, in his Musée Imaginaire: 'A museum without walls has been opened to us, and it will carry infinitely farther that limited revelation of the world of art which the real museums offer us within their walls: in answer to their appeal the plastic arts have produced their printing press.'  

The 're-presentation' of Installation art through a range of different formats confirms its position as a versatile and even unpredictable activity. In his book  

From Subject to Project (1994), the Czech cultural critic Vilém Flusser suggested that the notion of the 'project' defined our identity, as it is engagement in some activity that gives us our place in the world. Similarly, installations have come to be increasingly referred to as 'projects', suggesting a greater emphasis on a work's process, while keeping the production of a work more flexible and open-ended as well as stressing its collaborative nature. Such works now require a range of skills, significant financial input and negotiations to secure a location. Thus the project begins as a collaboration, that is to say that 'interaction' is built into the work from the very start. Funding agencies and institutions need to be secured from the outset, rather than solicited later on out of necessity. Such partnerships are not without their problems and they do impact on the work. As Kasper Konig, director of the Museum Ludwig in Frankfurt suggests: The art museum can act as a producer concerning contemporary art...I think this is an important task.' On the other hand, Jerome Sans, co-curator of the Palais de Tokyo in Paris, continues to question whether the 'museum is really a place for experimentation'. Sans's position is echoed by a growing number of innovative arts organizations which attempt to elude the grasp of the institution. Locus+, founded in 1993, is an organization with networks of artistic centres in the UK and Canada. Its commissioning policy is centred on the artist instead of the institution, 'thus opposing the norm accepted on the UK art scene,' writes Agnes lvacs. While artists struggle for acknowledgment of their authorial credentials, institutions have moved away from being solely collectors to being also producers of new works. However, conflicts of ownership may arise between artists and commissioning institutions. 'The work is indivisible from the persona of the artist, argues Miwon Kwon, 'the intricate orchestration of literal and discursive sites that make up a nomadic narrative requires the artist as a narrator-protagonist.' Having built up the artist's voice, as a means of reaching new and active audiences, the institution will not benefit from its silence.

left Mischa Kuball, Private Light/Public Light,1998   
In this project Kuball gradually replaced public lights on the streets of Sao Paulo with domestic fixtures. In the Private Light phase of the project, Kuball moved to the interior site. Standardized lamps replaced private fixtures, which had   
been removed from different homes   
and exhibited; in a certain way they thus represented their owners. The private settings, before and after swapping   
light sources, were documented in   
photographs. As private tastes gave   
Way to standardized lighting, one   
language to another, individuality   
and identity were brought into conflict with civil society.

His work uses television sets and packing materials, pallets, cables, plugs, etc. The themes of the short video loops were intentionally disturbing. Geers wished to evoke the uncanny and a feeling of danger.

below Billboard Sydney,1998   
Streuli's work is concerned with erasing   
history and difference, changing images  

into a flat universalism. The work deliberately uses the language and techniques of advertising. Duraclear images are usually placed in main urban shopping areas or on building concourses. The works consist of larger-than-life portraits of anonymous passers-by who are depicted in a state of deep introspection and juxtaposed with their actual surroundings.

right Tobias Rehberger, Brancusi, 1997   
Rehberger combines art, architecture and design, focusing on creations for immediate consumption - instantaneous works that paraphrase the dogma of modernistic actuality and question issues of commercialization. The artist designed an advertisement for a Berlin gallery, which appeared in art magazines. He then presented the advertisement to a textile designer,who used it as a pattern for garments worn by gallery staff during an art fair. Subsequently, the gallery used the same advertisement as a model for the exhibition 'Brancusi' in 1997. The two-dimensional layout was translated onto three-dimensional surfaces, which could be interpreted as 1970s-style furniture or as autonomous sculptures. In this work Rehberger renounced his authorship, concentrating like a manager on co-ordinating different processes, thus reducing hierarchies, but also focusing on the variability of interpretation and content.

A number of artists (105 in total) were invited to modify the interior and exterior of a former private clinic in Zurich, Switzerland. These works were then 'morphed' by other artists. One of the participators was the Swiss artist Francoise Bassand, who created a room inspired by the 1970s wall decoration in the staircase of the building. Bassand then invited five more artists, who had been working on the project, to interact with the existing installation.

Fabrice Gygi right Sans nul titre, 1998 below Tribunal,1999  

The Swiss artist Fabrice Gygi fabricates portabte structures such as platforms, constructions of metal and plywood, tarpaulins, tents made from foam rubber padding and inflated, oversized airbags from industrially produced materials. The notion of displacement is aimed at the institution destined to host the pieces. Gygi has acquired a keen awareness of the workings of authoritarian power, the ways in which freedom and control, security and threat interact. His installations communicate a deep-seated mistrust of any form of finality where the meaning of the work emerges from an exchange with the physical and mental context in which they are made.

Vegetation between two private fields was cut down to create an opening revealing a view towards the city. This construction evoked a metaphor of the cinematic frame and revealed the artificiality of perception, thus allowing for the contemplation of landscape to appear as a cuiturally constructed utopia.

Through the use of elements familiar from news stories and historical narratives, the viewer was immersed in a fictional world.

The American artist Mark Dion has been involved with the history of collection, classification and display as practised by scientific institutions such as natural history museums or pre-museum archives (Wunderkammern and Cabinets of Curiosity), often collaborating with museums like the Tate, London. Using the strategy of imitation, the artist assumes the role of a scientific researcher and explorer in order to analyze the ideological foundations and the myths of objectivity and neutrality of such institutions. His environments include 'realistic facts' which are theatrically exaggerated and fictionalized.

Antique sculptures from a museum collection were carried by helicopter from the museum's storage place, located some distance from the main building, to the roof of the museum. Each time, the helicopter carried a new sculpture and took away the previous one. A sculpture stayed on the roof until the next one arrived. This action of the Turkish artist Ayse Erkmen was repeated once or twice a week at Munster Sculpture Projects, 1997.

The work consisted of an installation in the northern open-air courtyard of the Berlin Reichstag [German Parliament building) and a web site. At the invitation of the Bundestag the artist invited the 669 members of the German parliament to fill an oblong wooden trough with 100 kilogrammes of earth from their respective electoral districts. The dedication Der Bevolkerung was chosen to contrastwith the words on the portal of the Reichstag, Dem deutschen Volke (To the German People). The dedication was designed with the same typographic font and size. Haacke interpreted the writing Dem deutschen Volke as 'nationalistic' because it failed to take into account people from other countries. The project sparked debate between the political parties in the German parliament, with 260 voting for the project, 258 against it and 31 abstaining. All the Conservative parties rejected the project.

In 1945, after the battle for Berlin, the Reichstag was in ruins. It was restored however between 1957 and 1971. After the fall of the Berlin wall in 1989, the Reichstag regained its status as the seat of the German parliament. Already in 1961 Christo had created a collage with photographs and a text, entitled Project for a Wrapped Public Building. The idea of the Wrapped Reichstag was developed between 1971 and 1995, during which time the Christos spent many months lobbying in Bonn, talking personallyto $352M P5,$ to convince the German parliament to grant permission for the wrapping of the building. Permission was refused three times, in 1977, 1981 and 1987. Finally, the

Bundestag voted to grant permission on 25 February 1994. On 18 June 1995 at 5 a.m. the unfurling of the fabric began simultaneously on the four facades. Custom-made cushions placed between the cages supported the rolls of fabric, keeping them in a horizontal position and facilitating the unrolling. For safety reasons, every panel was temporarily roped tight in case of a sudden wind. The entire roof and both inner courtyards were wrapped with 100,000 square metres of 70 recyclable, aluminum-coated, fabric panels. The rooftop wrapping was secured by blue ropes which in turn were attached to 270 anchors on the roof and weighted on the sidewalks around the building. The Reichstag remained wrapped for fourteen days.  

Christo and Jeanne-Claude have completed many projects, inctuding wrapping buildings, surrounding islands with floating fabric skirts and fencing in miles of coastline and inland hills. All these have taken years of planning. The sale of early works of the 1950s and 1960s, as well as the preparatory drawings, fund their projects. In fact, drawings and collages add to the development of ideas and serve as pre-documents which can be compared with actuality. The whole process is part of the work, be it meetings with town planners, site owners, court hearings, bureaucratic redtape and the installation of the work. All Christo and Jeanne-Claude's projects are site-specific and time-based loften only being up for a few days or weeks] and can be looked upon as large-scale site installations.

He chooses disposable materials, cardboard, tape and tin foil, which he uses as umbilical cords to connect the environments.The deliberate use of crude materials coupled with the monumental subject matter produces a metaphorically fragile world which questions the hypocrisy of political power structures and the museum as an institution. Hirschhorn deliberately employs what he himself describes as cheap tricks and stupid things in order to humorously undermine power.

During May 1997 the public were invited to fill out ballots which were then entarged and turned into individual tiles. A totat of 3,500 different samples where selected and made into an edition of five tiles. The work played off the dichotomy between community and individuality and was a homage to the unique yet anonymous contribution of those who participated.

Using the elevations of various venues around the world Pflumm installed illuminated signs of his logo. This underlines the artist's mission to include a corporate symbol which lives on after the exhibition is over and leaves a permanent brand on each institution.

The artists had staged unexpected clashes between the aesthetic of the white cube and that of sites of gay sexuality. The work showed not only the powerlessness and flexibility of all structures -white walls do not have to carry the kind of transcendental significance they are sometimes assigned - but also a gay 'infiltration' of   
modernist aesthetic.

The Bunker Project of the Portuguese artist Miguel Leal is an ongoing work which has been shown in different locations around the world, varying its configurations at each site. The Museum of Modern Strategy (MOMS) was set up by the artist as a critique of the museum and its power base. it was planned on the basis of a fictional and heterodox structure, seeking to use its ambiguous status to largely justify its existence. MOMs is part of a vaster project with the generic name of Bunker. The first classification of Bunker included the Analytical Department, the Art Department,the International Department,the Digital Department and also the Revolting Museum Project; the second category included the projects Bird's Eye, Night Watch and Warin Theory.

Dutton/Peacock,Apocotropes, 1996\~97 The British artists Steve Dutton and Percy Peacock began collaborating on projects in 1996. Much of their work had involved the,use of large-scale, often inverted or revolving photographs. Three 6-foot-square $\left(0.5m$ square) photographs on MDF proposed the artist's studio as an artwork in various stages of production. The photographs effectively documented theprocesses of their own production, within which the location of the‘work' is difficult to define. The status of photographs as props, complex artworks, or factuat documents is here problematized.

The busy effect of clutter and excess was accentuated by the incessant flashing of a white fluorescent light and several videos perpetually playing in various corners of the gallery. The sound of frogs emanated from hidden speakers, objects came apart, spilled over, scattered and separated in a series of gestures that explored chaos, order, dispersion and restoration. The installation mirrored the disintegration of the gallery as an inert white cube, revealing the tension and deadening repetition of our daily working lives and finally reflecting a Kafkaesque view of corporate life.

Ten laboratory assistants weighed and cleaned fifty thousand two-pence coins at the gallery, which had been transformed into a wellequipped taboratory. As part of this pseudo-scientific method, tents erected on an adjacent roof acted as evaporation sites for the cleaning chemicals. All the residue of human touch was removed from the coins and stored in jars placed on ten laboratory tables in the gallery and could be viewed at the end of the experiment. Calculations demonstrated that the dirt on the coins had a measurable value, equated to the weight of seven pence, a magic number. Newling's work offered an intriguing exploration of the relationships between people and objects of financial and cultural worth and consequently questioned value systems.

The work counters the utopian expectations of experimental science.Jakobsen's art constitutes a tenacious intervention in the structures that determine systems. It throws doubt on the human body as matter and on its relation to authority and the social context.

# exchange and interaction  

In the seventies and eighties, we lived in a society of spectacle, in the nineties in the society of participants, and we are now developing a society of interactors'.  

It is necessary to explore the assertion that the spectator, the viewer of an artwork, is now an interactor and the ways in which this affects the artist and their chosen forms of address. What strategies do they employ to facilitate the desired interaction and exchange, and in what way does new Installation work address such issues?  

The opening of the Palais de Tokyo in Paris in 2002 was welcomed as a new 'site of contemporary creation'. Nicolas Bourriaud, joint project director, put forward his idea about 'relational aesthetics', which sees art's response to an ever more regimented society to introduce ‘interactivity, conviviality and relationality'. He proposed an art in which objects are catalysts generating communicative processes.  

Rirkrit Tiravanija, from Argentina, is one such artist. According to Paolo Bianchi, co-curator of the exhibition LKW (from Lebenskunstwerke, 'life artworks'), held in Bregenz, 2000, Tiravanija mistrusts objects, putting his faith into that which takes place between people, in communication.' Tiravanija's collaborative installation Bon Voyage, Monsieur Tiravanija. Opel Blitz with German artist  

Franz Ackermann consisted in a remodelled truck containing a library of guidebooks, together with a series of monitors showing videos by the two artists on their travels. 'The truck provides new, more open, more flexible and more spontaneous structures, stated the artists. Elsewhere in the exhibition, the Danish Collective N55 constructed sleeping arrangements, a kitchen and a waste-disposal system. The work focused on the economics and activities of everyday lives and needs.  

A different approach to alternative lifestyle culture is taken by the Dutch group Atelier van Lieshout, who rely on a factory-like environment to generate their projects. Their catalogue raisonne, A Manual [1997], shows their full range of artistic products, along with detailed instructions on their manufacture for the audience. The large, glass fibre, reinforced polyester environments are often portable. The vehicle subject appears frequently and provides an art that makes a virtue of its mobile nature.  

Tiravanija and Ackermann's collaboration focuses on the 'nomadic' element of place, as the site of the work changes continuously and each location visited by the truck relies on a different audience, offering alternative readings of the installation. Van Lieshout's modules also eschew the notion of a fixed site through their utopian living spaces which prioritize human activity. The location becomes simply the place  

where interaction occurs. Indeed, these modules invariably look practical for everyday use, yet at the same time appear as if they do not quite belong anywhere. In this way, their restlessness is underlined by the suspicion that they are 'non-places', totally mobile yet essentially rootless.  

The questions of mobility and exchange with different audiences have come to dominate the practice of Installation. The two terms are linked, since the mobile or flexible site enables artists to reach a greater diversity of viewers. The works of Spanish artist Alicia Framis and Mexican-born Jose Davila provide examples of these developments by involving their audiences in activities and exchanges, which in turn raise questions about the institutionalized behaviour patterns of viewers towards art. Framis's Blood Sushi Bar (2000) invited visitors to partake of food in a highly designed environment, while Davila's 0pen Studio (2000) included discussion on the nature of artistic production in the open air. The installation was a set resembling an artist's private working space. The studio, or indeed its absence, had become the exhibit, as it generated nothing beyond itself, other than a critique or discussion of the traditional studio which has provided a crucial focus for artists over centuries  

Many contemporary Installation artists today have abandoned the studio, preferring to work on a project' basis whenever required. If artists are invited to make installations for a gallery, the given space  

takes on the temporary guise of a studio. This shift from the traditional space where art is produced is compounded by the spread of electronic communication and international mobitity. The result is the production of an increasingly restless kind of artwork. Thus, if the artist is successful,' writes Miwon Kwon, 'he or she travels constantly as a freelancer, often working on more than one site-specific project at a time, globetrotting as a guest, tourist, adventurer, temporary in-house critic, or pseudo ethnographer.  

As Installation has moved into the centre of artistic practice and with it,embraced its constant mobility, it has reached new types of audiences, resulting in different modes of audience participation Installation provides places for exchange in which the audience becomes an integral part of the work, as shown in these examples. The artist, as a rule does not perform to the audience, rather it is this open-ended interaction with the potential of the real-life situation that mark the viewer's experience.  

This theme of exchange may also take the form of commercial activity. The British artist Mark Povell's exhibition Supply & Demand (2001] at the Museum of Installation, London, invited visitors to make drawings on computer terminals, which were then turned into three-dimensional cardboard objects. The transition from drawing to object was cemented by the filling out of a contractbetween the artist and the interactor and on receipt of the object theinteractor was asked to  

pay an appropriate sum to tne artist. Here art pecame a non-essential 'service provision' to the spectator. According to Kwon, 'The artist as an overspecialised aesthetic object maker has been anachronistic for a long time already. What they provide now, rather than produce, are aesthetic, often "critical-artistic" services.'This absence of art objects can be seen in the work of the British artist Simon Moretti. A Space For Conversation (2oo0) consisted of circular carpets laid on the access-ramp of the Tate Modern museum in London. The installation created an intimacy in a busy thoroughfare, as visitors were invited to sit on the carpets and participate in a drawing project devised by the artist. While Moretti asked viewers to participate in producing, the level of public interaction required in Surasi Kusolwong's Happy Berlin (Free Massage/ of 2001, was simply to submit to the free service provided by the artist's professional crew: a massage. Kusolwong, from Thailand, promotes an egalitarian and inclusive art, while looking after his visitors' needs. The participation in a form of 'game' in Moretti's Installation led participants to indulge in seemingly open play which stimulated inventiveness. The media theorist Marshall McLuhan had predicted the growing desire within post-industrial culture for playing games, an argument which he extends into the world of scientific research: 'The world of science has become quite self-conscious about the play element in its endless experiments with models of situations otherwise unobservable.'  

It is through the shared mode of play' that artists and scientists have found perhaps the most intriguing partnerships. The depth of research provided in this field has attracted a number of artists to form new relationships and collaborations. In particular, the absolute necessity of process and play in scientific research provides a useful parallel for artistic practice.The Belgian-born artist Carsten Holler initially trained as a scientist. His installations combine the rigorous language of science with playful experimentation. Wim Delvoye, also from Belgium, shares Holler's engagement with research, culminating in what is arguably his most provocative work Cloaca (2001) shown at the New Museum of Contemporary Art in New York and in Switzerland. The work was a complex machine which commented both on the methods of manufacture, as well as on our revulsion towards bodily effluvia. The machine replicated the human digestive tract and was fed a careful diet of food prepared in the adjacent kitchen. This passed through several chemical stages of 'digestion', each part clearly visible to the audience, until the apparatus produced perfect examples of stools. The work also played with the idea of participation, in that it needed to be continually fed to produce editions which the audience could take away. The audience was offered the very thing it does not want as a by-product of the artistic process. While Cloaca uses scientific methods and manufacturing technology to his own ends, Polar (2000),  

a collaboration between Marko Peljhan and Olaf Nicolai, sought to utilize science as a means of disclosing new relationships between art and technology. Exhibited in Tokyo, it was represented by an installation that revealed the internet in real time. The artists compared it to the sentient sea in the Stanislav Lem story which became the basis for Solaris by Andrej Tarkovsky. Peljhan, from Slovenia, and Nicolai, from Germany stated: 'We wanted to create an interface between the matrix and the human senses and body.'  

To those who would believe that social interactivity might provide an unproblematic solution for the future of art, Bourriaud offers a word of caution: 'Now that the ideology of the internet links and continuous contact has come to pervade the globalised economy...how much critical radicality is left to work based on sociality and conviviality? He champions instead a type of exhibition that addresses 'a new problematic, that of the coexistence of humans, objects and forms, which generates a specific meaning.' The exhibition is not simply a means for conviviality, but to Bourriaud it acts as a cognitive tool', a way of generating meaning and content.  

The German artist Christian Jankowski's installations appears tobear out Bourriaud's argument.The encounterwithothers leads to a series ofdialogueswhich transform the outcome of his works. In Mein erstes Buch:Inszeniertes Schreiben [My First Book: Staged Writing, 1998] Jankowski sits in a gallery and invites a range of specialist consultants to aid him in writing his first novel. The artist is not 'performing', instead he is absorbed in the process of writing or in discussions.  

The question of process as a form of dialogue between artists, collaborators and audiences is of paramount importance to many contemporary installations. What is intended here is to suggest that the form of the artwork has become secondary to its journey and duration. Fluidity has become a buzzword in the new millennium and is indicative of a lack of boundaries. lt is unsurprising that artists are keen to work with flexible boundaries, a desire that begins to explain the rise of the art-project which can take any form, occur anywhere and, as Rirkrit Tiravanija states, include 'lots of people'. Moreover, the development of the audience as a site, that is, the centre and meaning of the work, has resulted in a shift from aesthetic and art-historical issues to a concern with the social integration of the installation. The cross-fertilization between disciplines, the exchange between curators and artists and the interaction with audiences as a means of generating the work itself have all been instrumental in shaping Installation art. The Chinese curator Hou Hanru states that 'we are contributing, directly and jointly, to the development of situations'. Such 'situations' based on exchange and interaction bear witness to the open-ended and inclusive approach to Installation art in the new millennium.

The Chinese artist transported 30 tons of rock from Diangsu in China to New York. Using traditional feng shui on the site, the massive Taihusu rocks were each carefully selected for their characteristics of stimulating the flow of energy in the space, and bestowing beneficial qi on the museum and its visitors. The clusters of rocks aiso contained a Chinese medicinal herbal bath. Cai sees his therapeutic Cultural Melting Bath as a metaphor for social healing. In his work he used the term 'melting pot', inviting individuals from disparate backgrounds to bathe together, fusing East and West.

opposite page Carsten Nicolai and Marko Peljhan, Polar, 2000 This collaborative piece by the Slovenian artist Pelijhan and the German artist Nicolai was produced by Canon Art Lab in Tokyo; they were awarded a golden Nica at Ars Electronica for their work. Polar works as a tool to experience the network in real time. It is a machine that translates and makes visible not only the information flow, but also the meaning of data that is found in the networks. Peljhan described the work as follows: 'We envisioned the space as totally connected, as a complex tactile - matrix.' This enables the audience to experience the data in the global and local networks in a completely immersing yet cognitive way. The work was inspired by the notion of the sentient ocean in Stanislaw Lem's novel and the film Solaris by the director Andrej Tarkovsky. 'We wanted to create an interface between the matrix and the human senses and body.'

This collective WC, an object referring to a kind of minimalism with social consciousness, was created by N55, a Danish artist collective, founded as a group in 1994. The experiments focused on an examination of social conventions and issues of power, which influence the audience's perception. This social experiment in the everyday included confronting people in a combination of leisure and work environments.

above ECM 323, Test Sites, 1999 The group of artists ECM 323 created a set up which surveyed and analyzed experimental sound, virtual imagery and individual perceptions. The primary theme of the project was how sound can influence form and vice versa. The piece focused on the investigation of an audience's response to Binaural brain frequencies, the manifestation of wave forms as visual information, and the production and evolution of acoustic signals realized as electronic feedback.  

opposite above Rirkrit Tiravanija, Untitled,[He Promised),2002 This Argentinian-born artist was brought up in Thailand, Canada and Argentina. His work fuses art and life, from music to cooking. The performative and interactive projects pursue cultural boundaries and themes such as nomadism, globat art and the internet. He has been working on a democratic art magazine in which contributors can publish their own work around the world, without editorial restrictions.  

opposite below Carlos Amorales, Producion/Calidad,2002 The Mexican artist Amorales created a metaphoric maquiladora, a cost-saving business venture which seeks to attract corporations, usually American, to bring manual jobs to Mexican border towns. Amorales's work suggested a warehouse by a geometric grid marked on the museum floor, using famous artworks from the permanent collection, some in boxes for shipping, others on view for the public. The work raised socio-political questions about production and consumption and explored the issue of the museum as a storage area but also as a participant in the globalization of the art trade.

A giant glowing sphere, two metres in diameter, gradually changed colour as it reacted to heating and cooling elements inside.Field of Heaven Long Shot Magnet presented a motorized model which made real pieces of planets and meteorites, including a chunk of the moon. These rotated around each other in an orbitat arrangement that would never occur in reality. Tyson's ongoing fascination with scientific ideas and philosophical arguments leads to a desire to experiment with information, drawing objects and devising systems that question our existence.

Formally, his installations remind us of laboratory structures in which it is possible to fly around in a circle, immerse one's head in an aquarium or to speed down a slope in a soundproofed obstacle course in which visitors see themselves as subjects and conductors of experiments at the same time. For the'Sanatorium'exhibition,he created Riesenpsychotank, a large, semitransparent container, offering the audience the chance to bathe in public.

In this work, commissioned for the 2002 Gwangju Biennale, 'Pause', Kusolwong displayed a stripped-down Volkswagen Beetle which was hung upside down from the ceiling, turning it into a swing. Inside the car a wooden floor was built up with soft mattresses and pillows providing the visitors with a bed to lie on. The visitors were able to watch the film Harry Potter in comfort. The floor was covered with a green carpet and potted plants, creating an artificial city garden, vending machines provided free soft drinks and chocolate and a bank of computers gave free internet access.

The Swedish artist Henrik Hakansson uses video and closed-circuit surveillance systems to record the behaviour of wild life. He incorporates the incompatible combination of club music, youth culture and ritualized entertainment with the natural sciences, and ends up with a visual mix which is at once utopian and dystopic. The environments of this modern-day Doctor Doolittle establish the possible mixing of the characteristics of one subculture with another. In this work the artist proposed the proliferation of roof gardens as‘landing-strips' for insects and other wildlife.

The artist's work for the Liverpool Biennial in 1999 was an extension of his research on the possible bodily effects of vibration. Sampled tones, modem beeps, and telephone clicks were organized into loops to produce minimalist cycles of abstract sound. This resulted in a manifestation of the invisible energy of electricity: the acoustic trace of an intangible commodity.

The artist uses the pixel patterns of selected scenes out of films and television programmes. The basic idea behind these works is that the pixel, normally the smallest component of digital image information. is massively enlarged. Through the exaggerating shift of scale, the grid system of the pixel boxes controls the viewer's visual and kinaesthetic experience, submerging the viewer and the space in a dynamic, coloured luminous space.

Behind modernity's clarity and rationality, these objects and interiors offering optimum physical comfort, are exercises in self-reliance and self-provision; artifacts are intended to facilitate the survival of the fittest. They are objects of personal obsession, buildings and implements, which represent the materialization of hidden but basic drives of society, such as eroticism and power.

The title of his installation, Cloaca, means a cavity in the pelvic region of most invertebrates, or a sewer. Delvoye created a perfect reproduction of the human digestive tract. The machine was fed three times a day in order to excrete once. The final product was wrapped and sold as an edition with a certificate listing the ingredients.

The display contained fish tanks and movement sensors connected to a bank of computers which monitored the passage of the fish between the three different coloured, interconnected aquaria. A soundtrack was also generated by the activity of the monitoring devices. His investigation into neurology and psychiatry and the effects of electromagnetic radiation on living cells, led to the 'Hive', a construct used by both scientists and appropriated by artists through history.  

# time and narrative  

Despite yourself...you're impressed by the fact that you're going to completely disappear.  

In a rapidly changing world, time and memory are key concerns for contemporary artists. Though borrowing from existing methodologies, artists depart from personal experience to construct their own spaces of memory. The singular term 'history' is under constant threat from the emergence of multiple 'histories'. Many artists have shied away from commenting on grand narratives, preferring to focus on the story of the everyday. They have used this concern with memory by focusing on official and unofficial means of retrieval, in an attempt to question existing systems through more private and individual means.  

The exhibition 'Deep Storage - Collecting, Storing, and Archiving in Art' (held in Munich, Berlin and Dusseldorf, and subsequently at P.S.1 Contemporary Art Centre, New York, and at the Henry Art Gallery. Seattle, 1998) concerned itself with an examination of memory. It brought together a wide range of artists and works on the theme of archive and storage, a concern usually confined to museum specialists  

One of the key exhibitors in 'Deep Storage' was the German artist Karsten Bott. His project, Archive of Contemporary History, is an archive in progress, which has been growing for well over ten years, and contains thousands of everyday objects. A selection is displayed at each site and new objects are added to the collection. When constructing installations such as One of Each (2001), the artist chooses objects for temporary display from this vast archive and lays them out in specific configurations. Visitors are prevented from touching the items, as they can only view the exhibition from a raised walkway straddling the space. Once the installations are dismantled, all the objects are carefully wrapped and placed in cardboard banana boxes. Duly catalogued, they are stored on racks in a room dedicated to the collection. This room provides a second site, but one to which neither curators nor audiences have access. The artist has thus appropriated archival strategies, while dealing literally with 'rubbish'. He has turned collector, affording himself the privilege of the museum: to gather, catalogue and selectively display.  

Such displays owe a debt to the celebrated works of the art historian Aby Warburg, Mnemosyne Atlas, and the theorist Walter Benjamin, Arcades Project. Though different, both are linked by a concentration on archiving knowledge and the philosophical readings to which they lend themselves. As the critic Geoffrey Batchen writes in the catalogue for 'Deep Storage', 'Exchange rather than storage has become the archivist's principal function, a shift in orientation that is evidenced in the flurry of networked projects that are under way all around the world.'  

The theme of exchange forms the basis for the installation I feel better now, I feel the same way [1996] by the American artist David Bunn, who uses the discarded card catalogue of the Los Angeles Central Library, which was replaced by an electronic database. Bunn includes the archive in his work to create a poetic narrative from the endless readings provided by the display of the cards themselves. 'The artist as archivist' might be an appropriate way of describing the activity of the French artist Christian Boltanski. His incessant scavenging and collecting has resulted in displays of encyclopaedic proportions. In Les Abonnes du Telephone (2000), Boltanski displayed thousands of international telephone directories which visitors were invited to browse, while a soundtrack played the list of twelve thousand registered voters living within a ten-minute radius of the gallery.  

Boltanski's activities find an echo in the philosopher Vilem Flusser's assertion that we live in a society of recycling. By this he means that our lives are punctuated by objects, feelings and ideas that are endlessly retrieved and re-used. He thus aligns commercial waste recycling with psychoanalysis, both activities that aim to regenerate and to rebuild by sifting through and reinstating discarded and forgotten material. A number of artists have turned to personal recollections and anxieties as material for public displays. The British artists Bob & Roberta Smith, Mike Nelson and the French duo Loriot/Melia have all, in different ways, produced this kind of work, in which Installation becomes a means of gathering objects that evoke personal feelings and ideas to be displayed alongside one another. Loriot/Melia's fragile reflections are arrangements made from broken toys, glass and plastic shards, a world of pathetic cast-offs. Bob & Roberta Smith's Paint it Orange [1997] was based on a childhood memory in which the artist's mother decided to use orange paint on all the furniture. The action was reprised in the gallery which was filled with the adult artist's various belongings, including his car, all of which were painted in the same luminous colour. Mike Nelson creates atmospheric installations in interlocking rooms, sparsely filled with objects from his own storerooms. These claustrophobic spaces give an impression of recent abandonment and melancholy. Such works are not archives in the institutional sense, nor do artists who use archiving methods aim to parody them. It is the emphasis on personal narratives that marks such work, the narrative of objects that have deep, personal associations. Individual memory is thus turned into a disrupted and discontinuous archive of history. Contemporary culture is so saturated with the idea of its historical authenticity that it has become fascinated with endless speculative re-interpretations of episodes in the near or distant past. Subjecting history to constant analysis and counter-analysis has contributed to a mistrust of any unifying historical explanation  

governing issues of identity, politics and culture and to a mistrust of any value systems which provide clear frameworks for moral or aesthetic judgment. Instead, each object, each experience, each incident, each image must be evaluated according to its own particularities and itself constitutes evidence, so that the image becomes as real as the event it portrays. 'There is no higher order of experience or material form that aesthetic practice can offer or separate cultural space in which it can dominate. The real,' states the theorist Peter Osborne, 'now coincides with its image'. The conflation of the real with its images provides the central argument in the installation Garden (2000) by the British artist Marc Quinn, which featured a large glass tank containing a flower garden. The plants were real and were prevented from wilting by the temperature-controlled formaldehyde in which they were immersed. Taken from their original context, they were preserved in the exhibition in what appears as 'archival suspension'. Drawing on the ideas of the French philosopher Michet Foucault, art historian Irit Rogoff writes that 'accentuating the performative aspect of the archive has allowed us to move away from solid sites of accumulated knowledge to a series of "archive effects". While we may understand archives as a 'technology of control', it has also given rise to 'the perception of archives as the construction site of fantasmatic fictions.'  

Ine work ot jane anu Louise vvitsuil iyt ve viewed in this context. Their video installation Stasi City [1997] was made in a former East German secret service headquarters. The secret police files once represented the dream of the perfect record of a nation's private activities and, as such, provided fertile ground for the artists' video works. 'We became focused on the meaning embedded in buildings, that certain sites represented, the artists stated. And yet, the installation did not seek to reveal hidden historical truths; instead, the spaces served as memory triggers for the audience to imagine what remains invisible. The techniques employed by Jane and Louise Wilson are closely related to developments in current filmmaking, in which the image has become progressively unstable and unreliable.'Cinematographic and videographic techniques - the artisanal invention of dissolves, feedback, slow-motion and time-lapse, zoom, live and decayed broadcast - now appear to have been premonitory signs, symptoms of a de-realisation of sensory appearances, writes the theorist Paul Virilio. Location as such has disappeared, since our traditional visual link with place has been broken. The separation between location and viewer is due precisely to the acceleration of contemporary living and the establishment of tele-technologies. Virilio's position is borne out by the contemporary practice of Installation art in which the certainty of location is replaced by the restlessness of the artist and viewer. However, the

Mike Nelson, The Coral Reef, 2000 British artist Mike Nelson creates labyrinthine, large-scale architectural installations. The Coral Reef was a collection of shabby and disquietingly vacant reception rooms where viewing became an act of storytelling as the spectator picked a way through the curious amalgam of identities and histories. Nelson fuses encyclopaedic, continuing popularity of projects based on personal memory, dependent on the artist's ability to recombine familiar elements in unusual ways, points to the need for private worlds with their own logic. In these, the artist's imagination provides stability and purpose.  

The pursuit of memory through archival techniques is invariably a melancholic activity. The current fascination with archives for artists represents a desire to internalize and divert the narrative, rather than a need to critique such structures employing its own methods. It is the archival effect', as Rogoff argued earlier, that remains the key for the artist, along with an engagement with the'slowness'and introspection of such anactivity inwhich theworksearchesfor its own boundaries. The French philosopher Jean-Francois Lyotard explains:  

though idiosyncratic references - which are often defined through the irony and kitsch of his materials - into threedimensionat narratives.  

A Postmodern artist or writer is in the position of a philosopher: the text he writes, the work he produces is not in principle governed by pre-established rules. (These) rules and categories are what the work of art itself is looking for. The artist or writer, then, is working without rules in order to formulate the rules of what will have been done. Hence, the fact that work and text have the characters of event.  

In this way, artists working with the retrieval of memory through found or invented narratives, are creating'events'in which the work searches for its own context and boundaries; it is time itself that is revealed and experienced as the central subject. Since all narratives reference time, the artist uses these techniques to remind the viewer of their own story and experience of time.

The images were projected simultaneously on four screens in the gallery, depicting a journey around abandoned secret service intelligence headquarters in East Berlin. Long corridors with identical offices, desolate spaces and decontamination chambers were revealed. The work was not explicitly political, rather it was concerned with powerlessness and horror. A soundtrack of static interference and clanking added to the drama and the twin artists were filmed keeping guard. This repetitive mirroring and doubling occurred throughout this installation, as well as in other works by the British artists.  

right David Bunn,I feel better now,I fee the same way. 1996   
As libraries replace their card   
catalogues with on-line databases,   
the cards themselves, obsolete, bulky and worn, are usually thrown away.   
For his work, the American artist   
David Bunn rescued two million cards from the Los Angeles Central Library. Using them as raw material, he   
directed the viewer's attention to the poetic trace. The work returned the   
obsolete artifact to the world as a   
living archive of reverie. below Christian Boltanski, Les Abcnres du Telephone (The Telephone   
Subscribers), 2000   
Christian Bottanski transformed the exhibition space into a library of three thousand telephone directories from around the world. Spectators were   
invited to look through them and scan for familiar names. The exhibition   
included a specially commissioned   
sound piece in which the names of   
twelve thousand registered voters living within a ten-minute radius from the   
gallery were read out from different points. This archive of the whole world in the gallery space was fundamentally flawed and incomplete. Over the past four decades, Boltanski has explored archiving and the loss of the individual identity in the midst of collective   
experience and memory.

Cattelan always incorporates a sense of the absurd and humour in his work. Punchlines of laconic narratives   
suspend story endings, as he   
deliberately shows the spectator only a clue or an out-of-context iconic figure. He describes his work in relation to  

theatre, for 'theatre, like art, is a biological function. It's just like everyday, every minute'. Life-size and miniature scenes are presented in which Cattelan is both director and character in his schizophrenic reality. His purpose is to dethrone authority and to play with the notion that in his world,art is condemned to tell untruths while maintaining its sense of the ironic.

Pentonville was a live broadcast of

Visitors entered one of the rooms, climbed on top of a drawing table and put their heads through a trapdoor in the ceiling. A recurring motif in his work is the spectator's ability to observe, while being denied access to proceed.

The exhibition 'Archive', 1995, coincided with the Museum of Installation's move to another location in London, and represented five years of projects. Conceived and designed by the organization's curators, in association with architects Simon Miller and Alain Chiaradia, it featured over thirty artists who were asked to exhibit works, prepared and previously shown at the Museum of Installation, as archive versions. In addition, all other parts of the museum were systematically catalogued and displayed, including its entire office and contents, as well as the walls of the space. The show represented an attempt to present a living and interactive archive of Instaltation art.

First, it was a recollection, filtered through the artist's memory: next, it was performed, with diversionary rhetoric and idiosyncratic tangents; and finally, it was presented to the listeners, who created yet another layer of meaning through their own memories of similar excursions.

His work deliberately accumulates trash of everyday consumerism, found objects or items, some of which are still in their packaging, creating visual archives out of the reminders of the sites of everyday life. Picking up on biographical data The Great Sea Battles of Wilhelm recreated a fictional portrait of a collector's life. Beyond the biographical frame of reference, the installation followed an intuitive and imaginary concept derived from the artist's idea of life on the move - most spectacularly suggested through the giant suitcase structure that housed the piece.

above Ann Hamilton, Mattering. 1997 An undulating canopy of red-orange silk divided the gallery space in half laterally and visitors shared the territory with five male peacocks. Barely audible were the recorded sounds of an opera singer giving lessons to a student -and of the student mimicking the teacher. A wooden pole rose through a large circular hole in the silk and a figure sitting on a seat attached to the pole drew an endless thin blue line from a small white porcelain ink-pot on the ground, wrapping the inked ribbon around one hand until it formed a dense batl. The binding was then cut and dropped to the floor, only for the process to begin anew.

A rotating projector showed a forty-fivesecond film loop. The progress of the image around a cylindrical screen was synchronized to follow a 360-degree camera pan, filmed in the nearby Charlton Park, where, thirty years earlier, Antonioni shot scenes for the film Blow Up (1966).  

The beam from a video projector was split through a system of mirrors to cover the surface of a latex weather balloon suspended from the gallery ceiling.

right Dermot 0'Brien, Untitled, 1995 The installation by the artist Dermot O'Brien dealt with language and its sensory support structures. A pattern of small, coloured air fresheners installed on the wall of the gallery, made reference to written language which remained indecipherable to the sighted but was 'visibly' encoded in braille for the blind. The powerful and sweet smells overwhelmed the space. The discs provided the audience with an olfactory reference to these sample smells, which are usuatly employed to mask noxious household odours.

British artist is extended to the play with animate and inanimate objects. He used the form of the enclosed space to capture objects in a large museum vitrine for this work, creating an estranged and claustrophobic environment from which the viewer was excluded.

above Knut Asdam, Psychasthenia (5). 1998   
Working with the 19th-century notion of Heterotopias, Utopian Sites,   
The Norwegian artist Knut Asdam   
writes that 'Cinematic space is a   
notion of space as narrative, a space as an unfolding of a certain idea of the unconscious'. In this sense he is more interested in looking at and working   
with space as a 'temporality of unfolding intensities...of different velocities; so it becomes a space of velocity, a space in which to fall in love, have adventures or dream.' This is, however, the space in which people experience restriction, suppression or defeat- a political   
space, which is also one of fantasy   
and memory.  

left Phyllida Barlow, Depot, 1995 This work by the British artist Phyllida Barlow related to the gallery as a storage space of lost or forgotten objects and referred to a state of incompleteness and dislocation. Large timber structures were brought together with pliable shapes, which were placed near or attached to them. This created a narrative of remaking and appropriating the originals, which then only functioned as bad copies.  

below Mona Hatoum, Homebound, 2000 A sparse, 1950s living room and bedroom was dimly lit and fenced off by cables, reminiscent of high-security borders. Kitchen utensils were distributed across the furniture and wired to each other and small light bulbs glowed intermittently. The Lebanon-born artist experimented with the alienation of everyday objects, in order to speak of her ambivalent relationship to home and family.

below Alexander Brodsky, Coma, 2000-2001, For Coma, the Russian artist Alex Brodsky created a miniature city of houses and skyscrapers made of clay and attached to intravenous feeding tubes, which nourished the town with a continuous drip of crude oil. His evocative work reflects the idea of a society that has stopped believing in progress and has been captured in a coma-like state of ghostly inertia.  

opposite below Marc Quinn, Garden, 2000 Garden was described as a kind of homage to the 16th-century artist Hans Holbein. Impressed by Dutch art of the period and its preoccupation with the representation of nature and the human figure, Quinn commented: 'it's like the last judgement of the vegetable world'. A perfect image of eternity was provided by the display of flowers, frozen in silicon oil, controlled at a temperature of $.20^{\circ}C$ The artist's main preoccupation was with the process of prolonging the lives of plants in an attempt to freeze and immortalize time and beauty.  

right Hans Op de Beeck, Border, 2001 The spectator enters a vast, darkened room in which a moving image of a small group of people in a confined and abstract space is projected onto one wall. Their strange, whispered, but  

strongly amplified conversation, is hard to situate, but intriguing. Gradually, the group is surrounded by a life-size, X-ray image of a loaded truck and it becomes clear that these people, refugees, are locked in a box in the depths of a cargo lorry. Their conversation takes on another meaning.

Op de Beeck's miniaturized replicas of anonymous public spaces make the spectators feel as though they are inside the models, a moment shared between the artist and the audience. These still and quiet ptaces, which represent a kind of timeless nowhere, carry an atmospheric mood without offering any story.

opposite Tadashi Kawamata, Les Chaises de traverse (The Shortcut Chairs),1998   
A double installation by the Japanese artist Kawamata   
connected two buildings of important historical significance - the Synagogue in Delme and the Hotel Saint-Livier in Metz, France. Kawamata decided to reuse two thousand old chairs and erected a vertical structure into an imposing wall in the yard in Metz. This corresponded to the height of all the chairs laid out horizontally, separating the two floors in the Delme Synagogue. The artist also placed single chairs next to the plastic seating in thirty bus shelters along the route between Metz and Delme. Kawamata is preoccupied with the concept of contemporary chaos theory and issues of urbanism. He also chooses the locations of his works carefully, researching the city, collecting necessary materials and involving   
local communities. below Rosemarie McGoldrick, What Katy Did in 'Day for Night', 1999   
As part of the exhibition 'Day for Night\*organized by the Museum of Installation, London, the British-born artist   
Rosemarie McGoldrick instalted miniature cages in a   
Portacabin. The metal cages contained speakers which   
were connected to a computer programme. As listeners   
approached, the shrill sound of crickets was switched from one cage to another.

left Le Diable Probablement (Probably the Devil), 1993-2000 The French artists Loriot/Melia create optical illusions and tricks of light to achieve cinematic images. Carefully sifted debris is used as material for the production of images   
which are caused by bouncing light through the meticulous arrangement of the debris. The original material appears as if removed from an archaeological dig, while the resulting images take the form of a cinematic light show. The concept of landscape was addressed in Ready Made in China which featured a spinning mountain range diorama, achieved by illuminating a bicycle wheel studded with glass shards.   
The illusion of a distant aeroplane, which appeared to be heading towards this mountain range, was glimpsed in an adjacent work. The resulting overall panorama triggered the memory of a classic cinematic moment where the plane eithe crashes into the rock or disappears into the distance.

above Bob & Roberta Smith, Paint it 0range, 1997 Paint it Orange was based on an autobiographical event of the British artist Bob & Roberta Smith. As the artist's mother painted items of furniture with a coat of bright orange gloss, she ruined a set of Windsor chairs and devalued her son's bicycle. Smith recalls: As a five year old I was instantly taught how art could liberate and emancipate whilst also destroying and humiliating.' The work points to sincerity through failure, to a genuine, obsessional desire to make something, eventuatly leading to misconstrued notions of value or usefulness.

opposite below Markus Wirthmann, The Twentieth Century. Chapter V: The Total Eclipse,2000  

The beam of a theatre headlight hit a turning mirror ball installed in the centre of the room, which cast a shadow on the wall opposite the headlight. The movement of the video camera enabled the apparent passage of the moon's shadow across the viewer's field of vision, and at the same time, the simulation of a total solar eclipse could be observed on a monitor. Simulating the telematic experience of a natural phenomenon, this work by the German artist challenged the cliches of the Western perception of the'dark continent', ironically negotiating issues of Afro-centrism.  

left Jeremy Wood, The Map of Hope and 0ther Improbable Locations,2002 The British artist Jeremy Wood plays with and modifies existing artistic strategies. For this installation, Wood arranged furniture and lighting in a room, taking as reference original archival photographs of its 1960s interior. Visitors were invited to spend time in this retitled Waiting Room, either to wait indefinitely or to watch a short film essay, compiled from the application of Fluxist games of chance to the artist's own home-video footage. An exterior projection window was also set up for the theatre building showing an animation loop derived from Piet Mondrian's Broadway Boogie-Woogie (1942-43). This pseudo-advert would 'hopefully' catch the eye of people on the train passing in front of the theatre.

left Diana Thater, Broken Circle. 1997 The work of the Catifornian artist Diana Thater avoids the comparison with cinema, deliberately ignoring the possibilities of technical perfection. Her coloured projections bteed over the walls and the images look as if they have been projected on top of each other. Her large-scale, overlapping projections juxtapose images portraying animal behaviour in man-made parks and zoos. Her intention is to show that both of them have been artificially appropriated by mass culture.

The work of the Norwegian artist A. K. Dolven deals with stillness, whether in her paintings or her video installations.

above Anne, Aki and God, 1998 opposite below Tuuli/The Wind,2002 The three-screen DVD installation entitled Tuuli/The Wind by the Finnish artist Eija-Liisa Ahtila charted a woman's deteriorating grip on reality as she fell prey to psychosis. A violent wind entered the room, leading the woman to turn her apartment upside down,  

breaking furniture and destroying objects. This gradual mental breakdown was paralleled by the intricate and fluid choreography of the projection. Simultaneous yet different views of the apartment and a disrupted flow of lineal time, along with the de-synchronization of events, contributed to the eventual dismantling of the familiar logic of screen narration.

this page Michaet Petry, Contagion, 2000 Blood-red, hand-blown, human-heartsized shapes hung from the gallery's ceiling in this work by the American artist Michael Petry. Each heart was suspended on steel wire at the height of the artist's heart, forming a large curved rectangle (modelled on the architecture of the rooml which could be entered at any point and, like cell walls, the object was permeable. The gallery was floodlit with red light both day and night, but incoming sunlight meant that, slowly over the day and into the evening, the room dramatically changed colour. Petry had ascertained that the gallery was mainly visited at dusk Ifor theatre and cinematic performances) when the transition would be most obvious. Contagion was evocative of blood-related images, AIDS, hospitalization, transfusions, birth and death. As viewers approached the work they were suffused with red light, and appeared to other viewers as 'contaminated'. Once marked, as through a ritual, like blood brothers, they crossed over the threshold altered.

These photographs are cut out and reassembled among the original objects in the space. The suggestive play between the real and its photographic record immerses the viewer in a tactile environment. The artist's compulsive use of red and beige is employed as a metaphor for the visceral and corporeal illusions created by the work. The resulting effect is both obsessive and uncannily erotic.

This self-taught Congolese artist constructs vibrant and meticulously ornate phantom cityscapes made out of paper and other materials. Models of corporate and public buildings in bright, flamboyant colours, hotels, stadiums, parliaments and other pieces of urban architecture, are integrated into a phantasmagoric and luxurious architecture of everyday travel and consumption. These'architectonic simulations' place relationships of signs and representational systems under the command of a playful and utopian order of social, political and economic equilibrium of wealth. On the other hand, the artist presents a critique of the naive and patronizing attitude of Western visionaries and planners towards the so-called 'primitive'.

below Do-Ho Suh, Seoul Home/L.A. Home/New York Home/Baltimore Home/London Home,1999 This piece hung from the ceiling tike a spectre, swaying with the air currents in the space. Made from green silk, its transparency allowed light to shine through, creating the illusion that it not only floated, but also allowed the surrounding space to be reflected in the work. The Korean artist Do-Hoh Suh's installation was an exact replica of his childhood home in Seoul, and each time the work travelled to another city, the name of the host city was incorporated into the title. For Suh, this is a way of symbolizing his experience of transcultural travel. His work is a compelling statement on his identity and displacement.

Bill Viola, Going Forth By Day, 2002 opposite above The Deluge, panel 3 above The Voyage, panel 4 right First Light, panel 5 The work of American artist Bill Viola investigates the tension between stasis and motion, consciousness and the unconscious. It is described as an anachronistic 'suspension zone'. These transient records of duration, captured by monumental projections, act as a series of metaphors for the time in-between. Going Forth By Day was a five-part projected digital-image cycle which explored themes of human existence: individuality, society, death and rebirth. The five-image sequences were synchronized on a continuous loop and projected directly onto the walls, giving the work the epic character of moving frescoes. The story told by each panel was embedded within the larger narrative cycle.

# the body of the audience  

Western modernity since the nineteenth century has demanded that individuals define and shape themselves in terms of a capacity for 'paying attention', that is, for a disengagement from a broader field of attraction, whether visual or auditory, for the sake of isolating or focusing on a reduced number of stimuli.  

Though audiences have come to expect a level of interaction and entertainment in Installation, other entirely different artistic strategies are emerging. The Mexican artist Carlos Amorales's event, Funny 13 (2001), confronts the spectator with the figure of a devil'. The masked devil is dancing to disco music and attempts to entice the audience to participate; but the conventions of the gallery forbid it, making the spectator unsure about what action to take. Simply viewing might be seen as churlish, though dancing along might lay one open to ridicule. Caught between action and stasis, the viewer is effectively trapped. The trap is all the more effective because the viewers are lured towards a physical activity that promises pleasure. The ability to walk around the space occupied by the work and the possibility of close examination are no longer seen as being sufficient as an experience: the audience expects to play a significant part in the work, in its creation and reception. The artist's promise of participation, and its subsequent withdrawal,create anxiety in the audience. The work of the Spanish artist Santiago Sierra consists in paying groups of people to inhabit his creations. His subjects are often individuals, such as migrant workers, the unemployed or asylum seekers; some of his installations even involve voluntary incarcerations. However, he does not seek to expose the vulnerability of his collaborators, or turn them into performers, but instead focuses on the impotence of the observers, who are unable to alter the participants'predicament.  

The work of the Italian artist Vanessa Beecroft has similar aims: tightly choreographed groups of photographic models, hired especially for the occasion and often naked, are displayed motionless in the gallery. Unlike Sierra's figures, Beecroft's models are at the other end of the social spectrum, their work glamorous, their bodies desirable. The photographic model here can be said to represent the ultimate simulation of a human being: it appears like one, yet its removal from everyday reality is absolute. Such installations have a finite timespan and, during their exhibition, no interaction from the public is welcomed. This lack of engagement is significant in the work and may be seen as its raison d'etre. It would be natural for the public to wish to help the unfortunate asylum seekers, or to touch the beautiful models, yet it is their very proximity or palpability that renders them forbidding. The subjects, immensely real, remain achingly beyond the audience's grasp.  

This position is confirmed by the art historian Jonathan Crary: 'Spectacle is not primarily concerned with a looking at images but rather with the construction of conditions that individuate, immobilise, and separate subjects, even within a world in which mobility and circulation are ubiquitous.' Moreover, as the viewer looks at the objects that make up the installation in a given space, a perspectival shift occurs. Whatever the spectator can see constitutes one point from which he could be seen. The mirroring between the viewer and the viewed becomes endless. The French psychoanalyst Jacques Lacan stated: 'I see myself seeing myself...I see outside, that perception is not in me...it is on the objects that it apprehends.' Lacan's statement pinpoints the predicament of the viewer: one cannot see without being aware of being seen. The desire for a secluded viewing experience is always accompanied by the self-conscious thrill of being caught in the act.  

The video installations of the American artist Gary Hill aptly illustrate the point made by Lacan. Viewer [1996) shows a tableau of people engaged in looking. They are lined up side by side, but are entirely isolated and unaware of one another. Instead, their gaze is directed outside the frame, ahead of them. They are looking at us, the viewers, as we look at them. Here, the wall of the projection acts as a hinge between two worlds; what intrigues and unsettles the viewer is the lack of engagement or identification usually found in the cinematic experience. Instead we are confronted with an endless mirroring between the individuals and ourselves. Installation challenges the aesthetics of frontality, that is, the paradigm of cinematic screen and monitor. This engagement with frontality is expressed in the relationship between viewer and artifact to the extent that the audience participates in the work by becoming fused with it. Here, what is important is not the audience's ability to circulate round the figure or an object, but, on the contrary, the challenge to spectatorship by focusing on the viewer's frozen immobility. It may be argued that such installations act like surfaces, endlessly returning our gaze, rendering viewer and viewed the same. Similarly, the authorship of the work passes from the artist to the viewer.  

From the Renaissance onwards, the position of the 'I' is central to perspective, and is privileged above all others. The world then becomes a picture or object to be viewed from a single angle. Thus, perspective suggests that the world circulates around the eye of the observer. Gilles Deleuze argues that cinema provides the opportunity to disrupt our self-centered perception, by providing competing viewpoints. The moving image challenges a view of the world that is entirely arranged around each individual. The filmic installations ofthe British artist Tacita Dean serve to illustrate Deleuze's point. Fernsehturm (Television  

Tower, 2001) shows a view from the observation deck of a television tower in Berlin. The camera appears to turn in a panoramic sweep, but it is the room that is turning slowly on its axis. The camera's viewpoint remains static, but the space provides the movement through its rotation. In Fernsehturm the world rotates around the individual spectator, eliminating the need formovement.  

The works of the Canadian artist Stan Douglas also require a static viewer. Stillness is conducive to 'paying attention', as argued by Jonathan Crary. However, Douglas's film projections hide intricate spatial arrangements and camera settings. The apparent simplicity of his footage is only made possible because of complex sets specially built for the works. As in Dean's work, the position of the spectator is questioned: the viewer is seduced by the film, yet has difficulty in working out how the scene is shot. These artists' installations require patient and concentrated viewing.  

Writing on films and panoramas, the American academic M. Christine Boyer asserts that 'we begin to be faced with the absent-minded viewer who is uncritical of conventionality yet slates any innovation since it changes the format of endless repetition.' The waning of the unique artwork comes about through processes of replication and repetition of images. Repetition has become ubiquitous in contemporary art; indeed, it has become an essential condition of production and reception. The filmic  

installations of British artist Douglas Gordon disrupt the inertia generated by repetition in works such as Twenty-Four Hour Psycho (1993) which slowed the classic Alfred Hitchcock film down to occupy a whole day. The installation Feature Film (1998-99) showed the same director's Vertigo (1958), along with footage of Bernard Herrmann's celebrated soundtrack of the movie being conducted by James Conlon of the Paris Opera. The conductor's actions were projected onto an enormousscreenwhile themusicsurrounded the viewer in a wall of sound. The spectator was literally immersed in sumptuous sound and vision and the public's critical distance is eroded by the spectacle, sweeping away the viewer's bodily resistance.  

Stanley Kubrick's 1968 film 2001: A Space 0dyssey provides a final example of the viewer's predicament. In the culminating scene, the spacepod of the astronaut Bowman, played by Keir Dullea, is transferred from outer space to an interior. The dwelling has no windows but is lit by an opaque glass floor, an arrangement usually found in suspended ceilings in museums which filter sunlight: the museum space is turned upside down. This reference to the museum is important, since it turns everything within the space into an exhibit. As the  

character appears in the room, dressed in a red spacesuit, he is confronted with his alter ego, albeit as a much older man, who, in turn sees himself as an ancient bed-ridden figure facing a floating, black, stone wall. The film set combines the aesthetics of the museum, that is, the past, with the technology of the future through the spacepod. Furthermore, the viewer's attention is directed from one viewpoint to another in a linear progression, a technique also used in the 19th-century museum, in which the spectator's attention is handed from one character to another as in a relay-race. The progression of shifting viewpoints follows the ageing process towards death and rebirth.  

In Jean Baudrillard's description of ‘private telematics' the author explains that'each person sees himself at the controls of a hypothetical machine, isolated in a position of perfect and remote sovereignty, at an infinite distance from his universe of origin. Which is to say, in the exact position of an astronaut in his capsule, in a state of weightlessness that necessitates a perpetual orbital flight and a speed sufficient to keep him from crashing back into his planet of origin.' In 2001: A Space Odyssey the space-shuttle turns into the museum. The figure in the set replaces the viewer, who thus witnesses his own self in stages of progressive disintegration. The end of the viewer's journey is the realization of his own disappearance. The more we look, the less we see ourselves: the Empire of the Senses masks our own vanishing.

Draeger approaches the distressing subject matter through strategies such as the re-enacting of thrillers or action films. He creates photographs, video installations and complex gallery environments which replicate ruined sites, destroyed houses or burned trailer parks. All involve a resounding critique of the preponderance of massmedia coverage of catastrophic events.

Within a domestic setting, the actors destroyed anything and everything. The concern of the Dutch artist Aernout Mik was to provide a platform on which the body became the situation or site, acting out a game plan of interaction and passivity.

right Douglas Gordon, Feature Film, 1999 For his installation the British artist Douglas Gordon filmed the conductor James Conlon teading a performance of Bernhard Hermann's musical score for Alfred Hitchcock's film Vertigo. The conductor's movements were synchronized on screen with the soundtrack. The artist addressed issues of guilt and fear, exploring them through repetition, enlargement and slow motion. The memory of the classic film, which was screened separately from Gordon's, conflicted with the actuality and scale of the conductor's image.  

below Terry Smith, Marking Time, 1999 The video work by British artist Terry Smith was developed in Rome and filmed in London, and focused on the time when Casanova was alive. It was projected onto the walls of the Ca Rezzonico Museum, Venice, before its temporary closure. One screen depicted a game of poker in progress, the second showed a portrait of a woman's face,.and each of.the screens was shot to resemble a Caravaggio painting. The voice-over narrative consisted of a man describing the rules of poker, and a second voice stood in for the audience, asking questions about what was represented.

The Dutch artist Eric Steensman uses computer-generated video projections which are transformed using the theatrical illusion called 'Pepper's Ghost'. In Roadmovie a sheet of glass was placed between a number of monitors and the space, creating the illusion of miniature figures. The protagonists in this magical environmentwalked around and interacted with actual toy cars and other objects, while appearing   
suspended in mid-air.  

fleetingly before disappearing, leaving only the outline of a grin. Derived from her long-standing fascination with late-19th-century theatrical phenomena, such as seances, freak shows, circus and magic acts, Lane created a funhouse of absurd narratives.

left Eric Duyckaerts, How to draw a square,1999  

The Belgian artist Eric Duyckaerts has a background in both law and philosophy and his work contains a humorous play between art and pseudo-scholarly discourse. He is interested in the fusion of reality and fiction and uses the device of the lecture as an ironic critique of the authority invested in the speaker. In his video lectures he takes on the character of the professor or logician. Duyckaerts's works explore the rhetoric of experimentation and pedagogical discourse.  

opposite below Santiago Sierra, Trabajadores que no pueden ser pagados remunerados para permanecer en el interior de cajas de carton (Six workers who cannot be paid for sitting inside cardboard boxes), 2000 This Spanish artist's work deals with political and social comment and the gap between the 'first' and Third World. His work challenges issues of employment, health, nationality and social origin, examining different political and economic systems and their consequences for individuals. During the project, asylum seekers volunteered to sit in narrow cardboard boxes for four hours daily for the duration of the exhibition. The boxes were closed and hid the participants from the viewer's gaze. The invisible silent presence was a shocking reminder of the predicament of asylum seekers, who are powerless because of the official restrictions imposed by the state on their ability to work and travel.  

below Nicolas de Oliveira and Nicola Oxley, Burg Weogaran Dyreby, 1996\~98 Based on Wheatstone's 19th-century stereoscope,this work examined the relationship between the space and the audience. Two identical viewing devices were set up opposite one another and viewers were encouraged to interact with them. The mirrored tables allowed viewers to transform their perception of the space, culminating in their own visible removal.

pieces based on the literary figure   
of Gulliver. Like Gulliver, the artists are caught up in new contexts

opposite page Michael Landy, Break Down, 2001 Michael Landy's work explores aspects of contemporary consumerism. Three years in the making, Break Down is the British artist's most extreme project. He made an inventory of his life, of everything that he owned: pieces of furniture, records, articles of clothing, his car, books, gadgets and works of art. Over five thousand individual items were drawn up and catalogued. During a two-week period, Landy and his team of workers, installed on public view in a disused department store on London's Oxford Street, proceeded to systematically number, dismantle and weigh every item. These were then placed onto a specially constructed conveyor belt -  

a production line of destruction. What was left at the end of the elaborate process was powder, which the artists intends to bury in a capsule under a shopping precinct. The only physical evidence that survived the process was an artist's book which acted like an inventory and included the complete list of contents and an accessible public database. Landy described the work as an audit of his life. He is fascinated by the common currency of marketing information which profiles and classifies individuals through 'data mining' Left with nothing, Landy escaped consumerism, only to admit ironically that he is now the perfect person to sell to - the ultimate consumer.  

opposite Christine Hill, Volksboutique Organizational Ventures, 2002 The American artist Christine Hill dissects the institution of work, both in and outside the art context, appropriating daily influences to which an artist is constantly exposed. Hill portrays herself as living a variety of identities. She does not role-play. but performs in order to make a living. taking jobs that are often poorly paid and exploited (masseuse, shoeshine, striptease dancer). This project exhibited and sold the production of the work that took place in it, while attempting to create a space of discussion and a situation of exchange with the audience.

While the actions remained the same, the dialogue Ico-scripted by

opposite below John Bock, Lombardi Bangli,1999  

The German artist John Bock chooses the form of the lecture as his artistic medium. His aim is to transform simple structures and artistic tasks into abstract and absurd scenarios, which function as models of society. In his lectures, Bock combines language, dramatic elements and sculptural objects. He acts on 'stages' built from tables, cupboards or muitilevel wood constructions. The objects are handmade or re-modelled accessories of the lecture, made out of clothing, electrical equipment, such as hoovers and mixers, or 'plastic diagrams' illustrating his mathematical explanations. After  

the lecture, they are left on the stage to form 'theatrical collages'. The lectures are structured through different scenes in which Bock sometimes works with [non-professional] actors. Frequently he plays pop songs or classical pieces from a record player. The lectures are mostly recorded on video and later integrated into the installations.  

below Christian Jankowski, Rosa, 2001 The artist's narrative video installations play a central role in his strategy of setting up complex scenarios around encounters with'normal',mundane behaviourat patterns [supermarket shopping becomes a hunting expedition, the exhibition becomes a magician's act), transforming the ordinary into  

filmic fantasies. Documentation and magic, reality and fiction can hardly be separated. He observes life as an open-ended set of adventures - which can have absurd consequences - and is narrator and observer, a commentator and prankster. Despite its hilarity. Rosa had a dark side, dwelling on the cruelty of seemingly normal situations. Set deliberately in the business world of art, the burlesque situations provided built-in-failure elements, although the bittersweet ending ultimately gave the spectator a feeling of redemption.

The hightech city centres with their Utopian architecture, hybrid forms and atmosphere of futuristickitsch were parodied in the work. The constructions were like a children's building game, a comment on how useless design can be when confronted with an irrational and playfully anarchic vision.

His materials are ordinary and infused with practical experience, yet in the context of his performances they take on a life of their own, flowing and forming responsive patterns. In Kabine the artist exposed himself to an explosion inside a specially constructed shelter. The remains of the event became part of the subsequent exhibition. Signer describes his work through a feeling for tragedy, for the absurd, the senseless and the useless that we humans inflict.

opposite above Patrick Tuttofuoco, Velodream,2001 For Tuttofuoco's work, the SMAK galleries in Ghent, Belgium, were turned into a Velodrome. The exhibition featured a series of vehicles designed by the artist as portraits of his close friends which viewers were able to take for a spin. Tuttofuoco's work is  

Charles Long and Stereolab   
right The Amorphous Body Study Centre, 1995   
right below Charles Long, Holidays   
Situations,1999   
The American artist Charles Long has collaborated with various artists and musicians to complete a series of   
complex pieces. The Amorphous Body Study Centre consists of a series of podlike, organic forms with headsets for the viewer to listen to the songs of the   
British pop band Stereolab. it revealed the importance of the tangible in the emerging information-based reality.   
For Holidays Situations, Long created a tableau of male and female mannequins in the window of the Saks Fifth Avenue store in New York. These acted as   
stand-ins for the viewer and posed in attitudes of fashionable boredom in   
opulent living rooms invaded by snow drifts. The work exuded humour, but masked a darker mood. One of the   
scenes referred to the claustrophobic landscapes of Stanley Kubrick's film The Shining. In another window,a snow globe, reminiscent of Orson Wells's   
Citizen Kane, was perched on a baroque foam structure. The tension between the mimetic shapes and posed figures was heightened by the electronic,   
upbeat mantra of the audio artist Mark Mothersbaugh, which included laughing, purring and ringing bells.  

concerned with play, entertainment, youth culture and sport.  

opposite below Chinese Cartoon, We Are the Kids Who Never Grow Up, 2001 The work of the collaborative artists group Chinese Cartoon takes its inspiration from the artificial world of computer animations, games and toys. In this installation the Chinese artist Huang Yihan refers to the conflict of the younger generation who remain physiologically immature in spite of being socially grown-up.

Mariko Mori, Beginning of the End, Shibuya/Tokyo,1995 Mori's work presented a series of photographs showing her suspended in a plexiglas body capsule in urban public spaces all over the world. Mori believes in the necessity of Utopias, conveyed in works that are neither ironic nor naive.  

The implication is that we already live in a world where the machines are on the whole more colourful, lively and interesting than people.

right Mariko Mori, Body Capsule, 1995 The Japanese artist Mariko Mori celebrates herself as an art product, as a star born out of the world of image streams, who cleverly succeeds in mixing visions of fashion and architecture transforming them into virtual environments. She appears in her photographs dressed as a futuristic comic book figure or a sweet and harmless cyborg. For her work Beginning of the End (above), Mori encased herself in a Body Capsule to express a transcendence over spacetime.

Thomas Eller, THE Human Re-entering Nature, 2000 The work of the German artist Thomas Eller responded to the problems of the Japanese location in which it was exhibited. Extreme seasonal conditions - an average of more than two metres of snowfall in winter - and the pull of the big cities, led to an increasing depopulation of the area. The artist symbolically repopulated it with three figures mounted on aluminium sheeting. These were covered in snow in the winter and overrun with plants in the summer.

below Momoyo Torimitsu, Miyata Jira, 1997 The Japanese artist Momoyo Torimitsu describes her work as focusing on the tension between reality as perceived through the senses and physical or objectively real experience. The crawling robot Miyata Jira looked exactly like an ordinary Japanese businessman. Torimitsu, dressed as a nurse, assisted it as it crawled along the pavement. The work was a statement on the predicament of the Post-1960s economic boom,when individual identity became subsumed into a uniform collective. The artist takes general themes hightighted by Japanese culture and comments on the difficulties experienced when a society is so over stimulated by commerce and fantasy that common values and reality are overlooked.  

above Vanessa Beecroft, VB46.026.ali, 2001  

Since the mid-1990s the Italian artist Vanessa Beecroft has disptayed a succession of scantily clad or naked women. All the women are made up and dressed in a similar way, resembling shopfront mannequin or models in fashion shoots. Standing before the public like living pictures, these set-ups are not performances; the figures do not move, they only take up a position. Neither the models, nor the public show any emotion and no comment is made. Derived from media images of commodified beauty, these ensembles suspend human communication, emasculating the charm of the erotic interplay.  

![images/665347f07a56a494f799a177ed5d05a9efc3eb785372d3c09abd01e671974df6.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/xY0VdFC.jpeg)  

Gary Hill, Viewer, 1996 Slightly larger-than-life colour images of seventeen labourers facing out from a neutral black background were projected onto a 45-foot-long wall. For this, five laser discs were synchronized So that the figures appeared to be standing side-by-side in a line. The men stood almost motionless, their movement limited to invotuntary stirring - an incidental shifting from foot to foot, slight movements of the hands, and almost imperceptible changes in facial expression. There was no interaction among them, each man stood alone and gazed out from the plane of projection towards the viewer.

this page Tacita Dean,Fernsehturm (Television Tower], 2001   
The British artist Tacita Dean's work is a $16-m m$ film made on location in Berlin, several hundred metres above ground level in the rotating room of the old East German television tower. Dean used the slow pan of the tower turning full circle as a metaphor for the reunification of Germany, a meeting of both cultures, old and new establishing a new world order.

Over the past decade Installation art has achieved mainstream status within contemporary visual culture. Its ascendancy has given rise to new critical terms and has stimulated wide-ranging developments not only in art but also club culture, fashion, film and retail design. This volume surveys the inovative ways in which Installation has evolved,embracing different and often unexpected media,and its far-reaching influence worldwide.  

Installation has opened art to experimental strategies beyullu the traditionally visual, as impressively illustrated here in over 300 reproductions of work by artists as diverse as Doug Aitken, Vanessa Beecroft, Santiago Sierra and Mariko Mori. Its constant development, its refusal to accept fixed boundaries and its creation of new dynamics between the artist, spectator and the museum have given rise to astonishing and challenging results.  

Nicolas de Oliveira, Nicola Oxley and Michael Petry are directors of the Museum of Installation in Lonaul.   
Foreword by Jonathan Crary, Professor of Art History at Columbia University.
